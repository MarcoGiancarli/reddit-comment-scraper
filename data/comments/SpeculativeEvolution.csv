But, if we were to assume if such a planet could exist naturally, the planet would not have a magnetosphere, so the atmosphere would be lesser compared to that of Earth. In some areas, it may well never be daytime, because sunlight would be mostly blocked by the other side of the planet. As a result, species living on the inside of the ring would be unlikely to have eyes, simply owing to it always being in a state of darkness in the inner side of the ring. There would probably be more plant/photosynthetic life along the outer edges of the ring, and fewer in the middle."

You'll still have probably have fish-like and jelly-like lifeforms in the lower atmosphere and maybe something bird- or bat-like in the upper atmosphere but in between you will have more intermediate forms, maybe looking like rays, which have lifting surfaces for thin atmosphere movement, but also rely on buoyancy more than aerofoils most of the time."
SpeculativeEvolution,3dtzgx,LooksatAnimals,3,Sun Jul 19 18:45:07 2015 UTC,"it's a bit hard to do any meaningful calcs without knowing gravity and gas content of the atmosphere:  BUT.  I happen to know that 1 bar pressure on mars requires an atmosphere 4 times the height of earth (because mars has weaker gravity). Your planet is three times the size (diameter or volume?) AND also has an atmosphere 4 times the height of earth.  Conclusion, surface pressure on your planet is a LOT more then 12 times that of earth - it scale exponentially with height at constant g and will be much much larger due to the extra grvaity on your ice planet. http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algtrig/atp8b/exponentialresource.htm  Lets assume your planet is still cold, the atmosphere is the wrong mix for a greenhouse effect or the planet is further out, beyond the goldilocks zone, but with very high surface pressure and aerial life.  Well, life might not have much choice in the matter. In those densities and with that size atmosphere winds are going to be like being hit by a freight train. That breeze has more then 12 times as much momentum and kinetic energy at the same speed on earth.   energetic flight (flapping wings) will be made a bit harder by the extra gravi9ty, but much easier by the extra dense atmosphere. Look at the size of 'wings' penguins need for water for example. Flyers might have smaller stubbier wings and bodies, more like insect shapes but possible at larger sizes.   the higher density makes blimping possible. fish use an adapted lung as a swim bladder to control buoyancy. I think the higher density also increase the weight of dust/algae that can float around on air currents and brownian motion, but you might need a physicist to confirm."

Gandalf would also fall into this category since wizards in Tolkien's world aren't human, they're Maiar, sort of a low level angel.  Elves on the other hand are magical but clearly have DNA as well since they're capable of interbreeding with humans. Aragorn is a Dúnedain, a race of men with some elf blood which causes them to age slower than normal humans.

The rhombohedron looking creature is the equivalent to algae on this planet. It's silicon based, and therefore takes on a very crystaline structure.  The planet they live is quite cold, and has alot of wet liquid in the air due to the large volcano-like spires that spew water out of their openings. It takes the frozen water and heats it up inside of it's body, and exctreets air to escape predators, and in worse-case scenarios, it super heats the ice crystals, and spews it out as scalding steam in all directions.    The arthropodic creatures seen swimming are dubbed: 'Insect Sharks"" Due to covalent evolution, it evolved a similar body shape. Though it has 8 fins on the sides of it's body.  The fin-like claws in the front are used to climb up the spires in cases of low food supplies. Once up there, it will eat the broken glass resembling coral. Though in normal circumstances, it will eat the rhombo-algae.    ""The Striders"" as they are called are very tall beings, reaching an average size of 4.3 meters tall. They hang around the spires, always having their electroreceptor under the water. It mainly feeds upon  the Insect Sharks, usally when their about to climb the spires, but the do catch the odd swiming one.  These creatures stand very still. Only moving to strike their prey. They have been know to eat a wide range of creature as well.    The planet these creatures live on used to be a moon for a gas giant, but it dispated as the core of the giant eroded away from heavy rains. Some of the smaller satellites became moons for this planet, it has four moons, so tidal activity seems to be very heavy in some areas, but overall the seas that cover most of the planet are calm.  There's so many clouds in the air that it's cuts the total 'direct' sunshine by 15%. Furthermore, the four moons cause many nights, varying in length based on their size.

Any processes would be confined to the same conditions as the theoretical hyperpsychrophilic  organism.   This brings to mind an organism who evolved as a food source. So much so that it is capable of losing large percentages of its body mass without significant harm. An organism that moves at rates so slow, it appears still to anyone around it without technology to keep a steady watchful eye for days at a time. Large trees. If we could experience time at the same pace, the world would appear very different. Time is all relative. Responses are all relative.

SpeculativeEvolution,3d6vyk,Naliju,2,Tue Jul 14 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: this is all total speculation.   I imagine that during the Cretaceous, the Kerguelen microcontinent's inhabitants may have descended from the South Polar dinosaurs. Due to its isolation, the main inhabitants might have been primitive, non-feathered dinosaurs descending from Jurassic lineages.  If any birds arrived, however, they could easily evolve into flightless birds and replace the non-avian theropods there, due to their feathers providing better heat regulation in such a cold area. Some flightless birds appeared very soon after the evolution of birds, so it's possible there could've been toothed, clawed flightless birds roaming about. If any birds in the Kerguelen microcontinent survived the K-T extinction, they could have become similar to terror birds that evolved in the Paleocene. If not, a new group of birds would quickly colonize the island and could still do the same thing. Other birds would become flightless, but remain small and evolve into many different niches, like some of the native birds of New Zealand. Before and after the K-T extinction, monotremes and marsupials definitely could have been a large segment of the vertebrate population. Something would have to explain their disappearance by the modern day, though. Maybe they died out in the K-T extinction, maybe in the Ice Age, maybe they were all apex predators and during one of the times where the island flooded they were left without food. There may have been particularly large insects in the periods where few vertebrates were present on the island, due to lack of predation and island gigantism. Giant walking sticks or giant wetas, maybe.  Coniferous forests seem likely as the main flora, although angiosperm grasses could have colonized the microcontinent easily. Mosses would be a large component as well. It's possible that marine turtles or crocodiles could have arrived, but then died off or moved to other areas during to the Ice Age. If any lizards made it to the island, they might resemble convergent marine iguanas, or possibly the giant monitor lizards of ancient Australia and the modern Komodo Dragon in Indonesia. Closer to modern times, penguins and primitive pinnipeds would have been a significant segment of the population."

Assuming there were no mammals left due to the fact it sunk at least three times before it disappeared, there is already a big difference regarding size and climate. therefore I imagine that its big flightless birds wouldn't be exactly like the forest adapted Moa, but rather more adapted to toundra or taiga like environments. It should obey to the Allen's rule as well, so I imagine they shouldn't have long necks and long slender limbs, but rather to be stocky built and resistant to annual low temperatures and strong blowing winds.   I mostly imagine a bird like the Dougal Dixon's tromble. http://speculativeevolution.wikia.com/wiki/Tromble Musk ox like, furry, stocky built, and migratory ; here from the south east to the north west. Kiwi like toundra dwellers similar to the one imagined by dixon could be a good option as well. There should be also another group specialized in a forest like environment, which I imagine as less stocky built and more adapted toward eating leaves and twigs than grazing, and more similar to a moa or a modern cassowary.

I do however believe learning said languages would be difficult. squiddie changes colors to say hello. Monkey see's red as posturing and strikes the squid with a coil of poo. squid turns brown to conceal poo and in turn inks the monkey thinking this is an appropriate greeting based on the monkey's response to hello coloration.  and thus a transition language is born for both sides to communicate.

Primates we already see why. A tentacle is lined with little suckers which work as a grasping hand much the way someone holds an upside down football with one hand. The crow would have to evolve such appendages and is a few rungs lower on the intelligence scale than a cephalopod or primate."

I agree with your point about the evolution of appendages. But some birds may actually be closer to our level of intelligence than primates are. Alex the African grey parrot was the first non-human to ask an existential question (a sign of abstract thought) when he asked what color he was. However, apes who have been trained to use sign language have yet to ask a single question.   Alex the parrot also demonstrated other examples of abstract thought, like inventing a new word, ""banerry"", to refer to an apple based on his experiences with bananas and cherries, and he also understood the concept of zero."

Using a video game example here, Floran from Starbound didn't invent any of their advanced tech, just stole it  So crows could steal bits here and there and find novel ways of noticing, primates notice this and perhaps one group realizes that intelligent flying animals could be helpful, so they form an alliance. Crows do heavy thinking, spying, etc. and primates, while still doing thinking, do more of the building  Could eventually lead to stereotypes of crows doong teaching, politics, etc. while primates do more physical labour, maybe leading to civils rights issues where crows show they are just as physically capable and primates just as mentally"

SpeculativeEvolution,3cx0wu,UberMcwinsauce,4,Tue Jul 14 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"The main problem I see with Octopi/Squids this is their short lifespan - usually only around 5 years.

SpeculativeEvolution,3cx0wu,olindblo,8,Sat Jul 11 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"I would dispute that. Chimps in captivity have a lifespan comparable to our own (up to about 60 years), which implies a longer history of our ancestors being capable of living such long lives.  And I would definitely dispute that it's due to passing on more knowledge. I don't know that any such cause has been identified.  Humans are an example of what can be referred to as a ""K-selected"" species. We're large, produce few offspring, and we expend lots of energy in rearing each one. This keeps our population close to the carrying capacity of our environment, allowing us to avoid the wilder population fluctuations that r-selected species (the opposite of K-selected species, usually with small sizes, short lives and many offspring) have to endure.  I would suggest that rather than any need to gather and pass on knowledge, instead the same forces at work which made species like elephants live long were at play with our own ancestors, leading to our current long lifespans."

SpeculativeEvolution,3cx0wu,Splorz,4,Tue Jul 14 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"In most to least likely, in my opinion:  Apes: It happened once, it can happen again.  But that's boring.  Elephants: Aside from apes, these seem to be the most likely.  They are already highly intelligent and social.  They pass down information both from parent to child and between social groups.  Their trunks are dexterous enough to serve the function of hands.  Although they are herbivorous and therefore unlikely to develop the pack-hunting strategies that may have played a strong role in human evolution, elephants have their own challenge that could pressure them into building a civilization: they need a lot of food, which means they would benefit greatly if they could figure out agriculture.  They are also long-lived enough that it is conceivable for them to recognize that plants grew over a spot if their seeds were dropped and buried.  Elephants who figured out how to plant crops and return later for the harvest might very well develop from matriarchal nomadic tribes into queendoms ruling over walled city-states where a central government controls the food supply, leading to a very human-like civilization.  Corvids or other smart birds: They get points for smarts, but their lack of hands give them a distinct disadvantage when it comes to building a civilization.  However, they can and do make simple tools, and ravens have been known to communicate information about non-present objects - it may be possible for an advanced corvid to develop a writing system.  Many birds also collect interesting items, and it isn't hard to see how this might evolve into a currency system.  They may also be smart enough to work out agriculture.  However, one of the problems in an avian civilization is that their three-dimensional mode of movement makes it easy to get into places and hard to keep thieves out of your own cache.  Civilized birds would have to spend so much time and energy keeping other birds from stealing their things that it might be easier for everyone to just steal, and the fledgling civilization would quickly collapse into anarchy before it got off the ground.  Dolphins: They're smart, they're social, they even have names.  But their lack of fine dexterity puts them at a major disadvantage when it comes to tool-making and writing, two major tenants of what we would call civilization, and they've got the same problems of birds with regards to three-dimensional movement and keeping thieves out of their possessions - while a bird could conceivably live in a cave with a defensible entrance, dolphins need to come up for air.  Any civilization that dolphins could build would look nothing like that of humans.  Octopuses: Their intelligence is impressive, their arms have great dexterity, and their curiosity is surprisingly humanlike.  But as appealing as the idea of a cephalopod civilization is, I just don't see it happening, for one simple reason - they are solitary animals whose entire biological niche is built around a solitary lifestyle.  They are carnivorous, and their intelligence seems to be mainly directed toward figuring out how to open up shelled creatures and get at the food they know is locked inside - I very much doubt an octopus would think of an idea as abstract as farming clams - and if one of them did, it would just encourage its rivals to come in and eat them all.  Beyond this, there just isn't much benefit that an octopus would get from civilization.  Trade?  They're too short-lived to acquire many possessions anyway.  Writing?  Why, to teach their rivals new clam-opening methods in order to make life more difficult for them?  Availability of nearby mates?  They die right after mating anyway.  Basically, octopuses are smart, but fundamentally selfish, and just wouldn't benefit much from having friends, so I doubt that an octopus civilization could arise.  However, solitary octopuses figuring out how to make more complex tools doesn't seem too unreasonable, so this forum's lovely mascot might still be on the table - I just wouldn't expect to see more than one at a time."

SpeculativeEvolution,3d03ng,JennaZant,4,Sun Jul 12 10:23:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by ""possible"".  There are actually parasites that, Yeerk-like, control the brains of their hosts.  Lancet liver flukes might command ants to climb to the top of a grass stalk in order to get it eaten by a cow.  Toxoplasma makes rats sexually attracted to cats.  One kind of wasp not only lays its eggs in caterpillars, but causes the caterpillar to actively defend the larvae; another kind causes spiders to build a protective web for its offspring.  HOWEVER, it must be noted that all of these interactions are highly specialized.  You won't find a parasite that can attach itself to a completely new species and have an effect on it, at least not one that makes sense (humans are affected by toxoplasma, but it doesn't make us attracted to cats - it makes women more compassionate and men more aggressive.  Seriously.)  You'd be hard-pressed to explain how Yeerks can link with practically any living creature on their own planet, let alone those from entirely different planets, who would probably have completely different biochemical pathways.  As for Andalites, as strange as their body plan may be to an earth creature, there doesn't seem to be anything about them that couldn't be explained, aside from the telepathy.  Absorbing grass through their hooves is probably the strangest thing about their body plan.  Earth animals have evolved heads (body parts positioned at the front of the body that contain most sense organs as well as mouths) for a reason, mainly so that they could identify something before eating it.  It's pretty implausible that an earth-like creature could go from having a mouth on its head to having mouths on its feet, since the entire body plan is usually built around the digestive system, but there could be an alternate explanation.  Maybe a primitive ancestor of Andalites was a scuttling four-armed starfish-like thing that had a mouth at the end of each 'arm', and the rest of their body grew out of that plan, winding up with a horsey shape due to convergent evolution.  Or maybe they have a simple digestive system in each foot and absorb the crushed food directly into their blood."

What if it's chasing prey and it has the wrong end in front when it catches up?

SpeculativeEvolution,3ctxlr,truncatedChronologis,10,Fri Jul 10 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to speculate on the evolutionary consequences of a world without wood, but there have been some historical analogs on earth.   During the ice ages, the global climate became too cool and dry for large forests to exist. The last ice age was especially bad. Instead of today's arctic boreal forest there were plains, with tundra moss or grass. Instead of tropical rain forests there was savannah. Bad for forest species, but good for large grazers such as mammoths, mastodons, elephants, horses, woolly rhinos etc, that thrived on the vast supply of grass or tundra moss. With warmer temperatures in the holocene, forests returned, and these large grazers lost their niche.   As for tool use; native Inuit people in the arctic had no access to wood other than the occasional driftwood. They famously made houses out of blocks of snow. Kayaks were made entirely out of the skin and bones of seals, and here is an image of an inuit lance made of a narwhal tusk with a tip covered in meteoric iron.   edit: Some more examples just occurred to me. The native inhabitants of Easter Island found themselves without any large trees after their civilization had apparently felled all trees on the island. They became isolated, as they were no longer able to build ships.       Settlers on the American prairies in the 19th century started building houses out of sods because wood was too rare and precious to use."
SpeculativeEvolution,3ctxlr,Splorz,7,Fri Jul 10 20:21:25 2015 UTC,"Going off this, if you wanted to worldbuild a planet without trees (because it is cold and dry specifically), there could be some massive migrating herbivores, and vast villages of bone and skin.

There are tons of flammable things in our environment besides wood, but the abundance of lumbar in our civilization has definitely allowed us leaps in technology and given us the security of always having a fire roaring."
SpeculativeEvolution,3ctxlr,1Cornholio5,2,Fri Jul 10 21:49:03 2015 UTC,"People  As another commenter said, Bamboo. I did a whole report on the shit in 8th grade and the stuff it can do is crazy. But let's consider that lumber for this instance.  There was a native american tribe on some islands near California (Can't remember the name, but there was a famous novel written about them) who used a variety of methods   Whale bones, sinew, and other materials from creatures around them. (Keep in mind, in this area, there were no real trees, just small bushes stunted by the wind.) Rocks and stones Tall grasses, used to weave baskets and such. This in combination with mud could make water tight surfaces, so essentially basket buckets and huts on a larger scale   And up until they were discovered by colonizers (from Spain IIRC) they were thriving. So I believe humans would continue on without lumber, as our ingenuity is what sets us apart from other creatures.  Animals  My best guess is many more animals would not only get accustomed to using four legs, but more animals would utilize burrowing as well to hide from predators, spawn, etc. Think about animals you would typically find in trees (These are just a few example)   Apes / Monkeys would either become bipedal like us eventually, or go the other way and as I said, use all four limbs as legs to hunt and run with better speeds.  Squirrels would become accustomed to the ground, burrowing like ground hogs and such other subterraneans rodents. There are ground squirrels now, so I would guess the other species would have to adapt. Birds are the big one. They really utilize trees. But I doubt they would change much as flying would be an enormous preceptorial advantage, few other animals would be able to utilize height without assistance of a branch. I would say they would either accustom themselves to an area with high rocks, or mountains, etc. Or burrow just underground, and hunt during the day.   Those are my guesses. Keep in mind it's all speculation."

SpeculativeEvolution,3ctxlr,MrHobbs71,4,Sat Jul 11 06:18:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not an ecologist, biologist, or any other ""ist"". Just putting that at the top.  I think that if you are considering this treeless planet to still have plant life, which still needs light to survive. There would need to be a reason for tall growth to be discouraged. If tall growth is at all an evolutionary advantage, I would assume it would always become an evolutionary trait. The ability to steal the life giving light from your competition is too great of a evolutionary advantage to go ignored.   That being said, you could assume that some unknown is causing a reason to avoid height. Possibly a lack of biodiversity causing a dominant plant species to spread along the ground and not need to compete. Or possibly animals exist that gain efficiency at killing off the plants when they grow taller. Maybe the atmosphere, or soil, or water, either lack resources the plants can use to create strong structures that support growth, or hinder the plants ability to create those structures, forcing smaller growth.   It's hard to say what animals would evolve in that world, but you can assume they would evolve strong UV resistance. I doubt tall growth would be encouraged in animals, the herbivores would stay low to the ground, to get to their food sources, and the predators would evolve to kill them accordingly.   It's possible that height in animals could still create an evolutionary advantage, maybe for finding mates, or winning fights. I doubt you would ever see something as tall as dinosaurs, but who knows.   I doubt that flight would be heavily used. It may still exist as an advantage for hunting, or escaping, or for migration or something. I just don't think it would be as much of an advantage in a world where you absolutely were going to be sleeping where the predators could reach you.   As for tools, it would be hard to do much without wood, but where there is a reason, and an ability, there could be a way. Maybe the civilization starts with stone hand tools, and learns to make fire using plants, maybe they develop metallurgy and replace wood with metals."
SpeculativeEvolution,3ctxlr,Troll_Bater,0,Sat Jul 11 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"An interesting point. We do use wood for a lot, it would be hard to replace. You could make a completely stone spear, but it would take a looong time, would have to basically replace the whole thing when it broke and would be heavier and harder to throw, but would be doable. Archery, is right out, but could still sling stones. Shelter would have to use stones, early humans lived mainly in caves for quite some time, a lack of wood to build shelters would have expanded that time. Sea travel is right out without wood, unless their is some sort of similar buoyant material, or some kind of large sea animal that can be domesticated. As for the world, without trees or large vegetation you also don't get any exceptionally tall/giant animals, though as long as there is still grass you can support herds of animals but nothing larger than a bison or rhino most likely. Soil can erode faster, and deserts spread farther."

African elephants, and pretty much all other large grazers I can think of, prefer the grass land, and even maintain and expand these grasslands by pushing trees over.

SpeculativeEvolution,3cr14d,jayjohnbert,19,Fri Jul 10 02:11:06 2015 UTC,"There's no way of knowing for certain, but it seems likely to me. Birds are dinosaurs, and many birds, like crows and parrots, are quite intelligent. Crows make tools, understand analogies, and can problem-solve to reach food. Parrots are capable of logical thinking, and obviously, mimic speech. Alex the African grey parrot had a sophisticated understanding of communication and was the first non-human to ask an existential question by asking what color he was.  If non-avian dinosaurs had survived, the 65 million years of additional evolution could easily have allowed some to reach human-level intelligence. Troodon was a dinosaur with a particularly large brain to body mass ratio, and could have been a good candidate.  If non-avian dinosaurs evolved human intelligence, they probably wouldn't look like us--they'd still look like dinosaurs, standing horizontally and using a tail for balance. Like birds, they'd use their jaws and feet to manipulate their environment. Unlike birds, they'd also be able to use their hands.

SpeculativeEvolution,3cr14d,Splorz,2,Sat Jul 11 07:15:29 2015 UTC,"Given the chance, I'm inclined to think so. The course of biological progression on Earth has always moved from simplicity to complexity, with the extinction events causing periodic setbacks to that progression. So, with enough time unbroken by catastrophe, who knows what the dinosaurs could have become. After all, their extinction was what set the stage for the proliferation of mammals to become the dominant organisms on the planet. Then again, our distant ancestors had to be problem solvers because they were smaller and weaker. Would the dinosaurs have needed higher intelligence to increase their odds of survival, evolutionarily speaking? It's the same question we can ask of birds: why would you need to think when you have the power of flight? An interesting proposition, to be sure"
SpeculativeEvolution,3cr14d,Splorz,3,Fri Jul 10 02:33:03 2015 UTC,"The course of biological progression on Earth has always moved from simplicity to complexity       I'm sorry but that is not how evolution works. You can't say earlier species were more primitive or less complex, they were adapted to a different niche. An otter isn't a primitive seal, a seal isn't a primitive dolphin, they live different lives and are adapted to such a life. Eohippus was adapted to a densely forested earth: hot, humid and grasslands did not exist. The horse as we know it is adapted to a cooler, dryer climate with vast grasslands. It would do very poorly in a jungle. Evolution doesn't always go from simple to complex, but also the other way around. There is evidence that sponges evolved from a free swimming ancestor that had a kind of nervous system.   Life on earth existed for more than 3 billion years before multi cellular life appeared. Even today most biomass on earth in the form of single celled organisms. Animals don't seem to be a necessary result of evolution, but even then, animals did just fine without a large brain for more than half a billion years. As far as we know, this large brain only evolved once, and it wasn't terribly successful, and indeed almost went extinct at least once, with all large brained bipedal ape species going extinct except for one. This only changed near the end of the last ice age. If that last species of large brained bipedal ape had gone extinct at that time as well, a possible future (alien?) paleontologist would have found little evidence of its intelligence beyond  some crude stone tools in Africa and southern Asia."

The reason that plants themselves do not move is because of the amount of energy that would be necessary.  They have the necessary starting points for movements and some have rudimentary movement like some carnivorous plants. You forget one thing in your argument why everyone would have chloroplasts those things kept in phylogeny are either structural like the vertebrae or without effect.

SpeculativeEvolution,3co6so,Brave_Horatius,14,Thu Jul 9 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"If this creature has any sort of metabolism it would need to breathe in a catalyst that aides in its metabolism. What immediately comes to mind is whales. Whales are able to breath in air, store it in their lungs and dive for up to 20 minutes. There is also a species of spider that creates a bubble of air with silk and carries this bubble along with it underwater to breath.  That’s what I would imagine this space “breather” would be like. Whatever catalyst it requires it would have the ability to store it for some time.  As for its physical appearance. Space is cold and this creature would need to absorb whatever radiation it gets. I imagine it would be colored dark-gray to black. To aide absorption of radiation (at least in the infrared range).  Think of the Xenomorph from the aliens. Something like that I guess, but with “humps” to carry its breathing catalyst.  Unless it’s a spore of some kind that only activates once it is in contact with an atmosphere."

SpeculativeEvolution,3co6so,Tijuano,7,Thu Jul 9 21:24:39 2015 UTC,"Well, space isn't actually cold. In space, significant heat loss can only occur by radiation, which takes a while compared to the convection that occurs in an atmosphere. At Earth's orbit or closer, radiation incoming from the sun overcomes radiation lost to the vacuum. As a result, most spacecraft are designed to radiate as much heat as possible to avoid overheating.  A hypothetical space organism that lives in the habitable zone would probably adapt to lose as much heat as possible, absorbing only as much heat as is necessary for photosynthesis. Also, it would need an extreme way to lose heat when it returns to the upper atmosphere. Maybe it spends months or years building up an exoskeleton, which burns up while it re-enters the atmosphere and takes a breath."

The crystal could have a sensory function that would allow the comet to feel the total of the gravity in our solar system, predicting or just sensing the right spin and boost that it needs to get where it wants. The crystal could leave a never ending trail of potential child - nuclei together with a tiny first first culture of cells. Maybe the early solar system was full of those until the dust settled more and more and the planets were eating up more and more of the poor fellas. Now we might only see the brittle remains of a once unimaginable huge herd of early comet creatures traveling the young star in majestic happy clouds.  TL;DR: I should take my pills ..."

Such balloons, when pierced, would take a desperately long time to deflate because, again, few particles are used to keep them inflated and thus it is improbable under a certain threshold of punctures that any of the particles would find the puncture and escape.  In a similar way that jellyfish can survive with a relatively simple structure and high water composition suggests a similarly sparse creature could survive, perhaps inflated by the rarefied leavings of passing bodies like comets. Puncture by high speed debris might actually be a means of acquiring sustenance if the structure of the creature made it more difficult for particles to escape by puncture than enter that way.   A large balloon could in fact use its internal supply of gas and dust in a similar way to ballistics test equipment that uses a water tank to catch bullets. The gas and dust would slow particles that had punctured the balloon enough that they would not simply go all the way through."

Some people would debate that position, but I personally consider technology based AI to be an extension of evolution.  After all, we are all just little bits of energy arranged into patterns that combine to form an organism. In the case of AI, the bits of energy that were in the form of a biological organism, created a new thing made of similar energy but with new advantages for survival. That's evolution, that's life.  So that said, I'd assume that the most capable creature to exist in space would be some sort of technology controlled by a sapient AI.

My guess is that any large space-dwelling creature would have to be very, very thin and stretched-out, like a living solar sail, absorbing sunlight for energy and scooping up gas and dust for 'food' within its 'wings'.  The hardest thing to figure out would be how a 'space dweller' would evolve in the first place - as far as we know, life on earth evolved in very small 'micropuddles' with extremely high concentrations of complex molecules, all interacting with each other frequently enough for complex patterns to form.  In interplanetary space, that doesn't really happen.  I guess it could be artificially created by an existing species."

It is a therapod, but since it is imaginary I didn't immediately think therapod.   And while yes, it is not a saurischian, it's body shape and leg shape just don't work with arms like those.

They filter feed off of small krill-like arthropods nay larger then most flying insects on earth. (more on those later)  Though being the largest creatures out of water, they do not actually walk, and instead hover using the high amounts of hydrogen in their atmosphere. They intake it trough the filter feeding oraphuses, and excrete it through macropores in the sacks on their sides. They also store some in a sack on the backs of their bodies.  Their arms are very flexable, having no muscles at all in them.  Instead opting to use osmosis to move their arms. Usually doing this to investgate smaller objects, such as the small mammalians and avians that roam the planet.    The creatures that they feed off of have a similar cast system to bees.   Fig.1 is a male version, mostly doing the pollination and feeding the larvae. They're not quite as fast as their female counterparts, and do not initiate incourse.  Fig.2 are the females. They're much more aggressive, and are tasked with protecting the hive. Though if the hive is starting to starve, they can also pollinate.  Fig.3 is the Hive Master. Not being male or female, it is instead both, and can and will breed with itself or other workers if the hive population begins to plummet. They also create the hive it's self.    The plants you see in the background are one fruit bearing plants of that planet (though these are more like cacti.) They grow to be about the average size of a house, but can their size can vary.  Their seeds, while i can be past through defication, can also be shot out by the tree. If the fruit is not eaten after a seemingly random amount of time, the will explode, sending seeds flying everywhere.    The small crab-like creature seen in the front is infact a mammal. It does not grow to be a very large size, and lives near shores or forests to eat the algae, fruits or other excretions/secretions the plant can create.  These creatures tend to live alone, but may find a family here or there.  Their size can vary from the size of an (average) crab, to the size of a domesticated cat.

SpeculativeEvolution,3cbxc5,Jimm607,5,Sat Jul 11 06:06:15 2015 UTC,"It has produced chimeras. Nothing as distinct as a half-cat half-bird, but it occurs. Its pretty common in Marmosets, they almost always produce fraternal twins, which often leads to reabsorbtion, which produces an animal with organs (including often reproductive organs) that are genetically different.  Of course, just on a speculation point, a chimera could make sense without breaking evolution. An evolution on symbiosis. Again, this has happened in real life. Albeit much earlier in evolution - mitochondria. Mitochondria were originally a separate 'organism' that bonded with single cells organisms, this symbiosis allowed the production of energy that was essential for development of life, and now they just grow within us as one organism. Obviously, it would take a much more dramatic overhaul, but two early organisms that evolved closer and closer, to the point where they were essentially attached, eventually fusing reproductively, producing sperm and ovum that had two sets of DNA, from each part of the creature then then grow as one creature of two sets of genetics.  An alternate would be taking from the Platypus, an animal isn't limited 'mammal features' or 'bird features'. And front/back aesymmetry is pretty much standard in most animals, it wouldn't be impossible for an animal to simply evolve, normally, with bird-like features up front and cat-like features out back."
SpeculativeEvolution,3cbxc5,IndigoFenix,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:38:12 2015 UTC,"Given the existence of the platypus, I wouldn't say than any combination of features is particularly unlikely - and a bird-cat would make a highly effective predator.  The most implausible thing about the Griffon is its six-limbed body plan.  You'd need either a completely separate vertebrate lineage or an extremely lucky homeobox mutation that not only produced two extra functioning limbs, but happened twice, to two members of the species that lived near each other to interbreed.  Pretty unlikely.  If it did happen, though, it would suggest that griffons, (Western) dragons and centaurs were all more closely related to each other than any of the creatures they resemble."

The author has some... unusual ideas about exactly how comedic timing is supposed to work, yeah, and you probably already saw the art, but just try to go at least a couple of pages in and see if it gets interesting.  Also, see for instance this introduction by /u/gwern:   The Accidental Space Spy: an earthling is accidentally impressed into chasing after an anthropologist and thrown into exotic (and deadly) alien cultures, where he struggles to understand their biologies & reproductive strategies & evolutionary pressures while staying alive. He does, most characters don't.  The art is best described as 'dire but it may grow on you', and the real joy is just the sheer variety of aliens on offer (a bit like Stapledon's Star Maker) and trying to figure out what evo biology scenario has been pushed to the max by the author - costly signaling of fitness, mate guarding, short-term memories, placebo effect etc. Some are pretty cool (I really liked the Invisibility Zone one), others not so much (placebo effect scenario less convincing than Robin Hanson's).   ... or this review: http://www.inbreak.ca/?page_id=504.

You could pick any ecological condition found on Earth, extrapolate it to cover the whole planet, observe the species we already find in that environment and speculatively specialize them outward in branches to form a theoretical ecosystem."

Would life rely more on geothermal energy?"
SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,GeebusNZ,6,Tue Jun 30 10:47:03 2015 UTC,"Hokay, so, you're going to have to start immediately in some pretty heavy science-fiction by setting the sunlight to 3%.   In that sort of space, going from what we already have, things are going to grow very very slowly. Bacteria are going to accumulate on water surfaces as best they can in lattices which give them as much possible access to sunlight from above and nutrients from below.   So from there, you ask where would you expect the bacteria to accidentally come of advantages? Maybe it's ones which have greater surface. Or another which has smaller surface and greater networking, intrinsically guiding themselves around obstacles or other bacteria colonies. Could be that you have predators which supplement their core of sun-collectors with aggressive external biological-matter consuming extremities which keep other, wandering species at bay.   Extrapolate. Use the process nature has of propagating species. Invent. Imagine."

SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,Hairless_Talking_Ape,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:21:13 2015 UTC,"I think insects and arthropods in general are a great design for animals. I believe that if they had no size restriction they would easily outcompete mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. If they had evolved similarly on a different planet but without the poor design for breathing that limits their size, they would dominate an alien planet."
SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,Rauisuchian,2,Tue Jun 30 13:49:15 2015 UTC,"Well, oxygen isn't the only factor limiting insect/arthropod size. Because of the way their legs are structured, they support themselves at a crooked angle, with their joints going out, up, down, and outward again. This means their legs have to deal not only with gravity and the forces from walking, but they also have to manage the swinging body between them. This works just fine at smaller sizes, and in fact provides more control while walking and climbing. But eventually, at vertebrate-like sizes, the weight would become too much to bear.  In addition, the segments of insect legs connect at a screw or pin joint, which has a very small area of contact. This allows them to rotate their legs more freely, but also places a great deal of stress onto a small area compared to vertebrate joints. At large sizes, insects' joints might just collapse due to the greater and greater stresses placed on them."
SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,Hairless_Talking_Ape,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:45:03 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be feasible to have an insect with differently angled legs and tougher joints?
SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,Rauisuchian,2,Tue Jun 30 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"Possibly. But the heaviest insects living today, beetles and weta, show no signs of evolving in that direction. In some large beetles and mantids, the farthest segments of the leg are used together as a larger ""foot"", but the legs themselves still reach far from the body. For a speculative giant insect, the joints might be larger, but they couldn't scale up in size as fast as the mass of the insect would. The same square-cube law that makes ants strong for their size would make survival difficult for giant insects."

SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,Thanes_of_Danes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:54:55 2015 UTC,We are the top species by a long shot. Other animals exist at our whim. If we wanted to we could exterminate almost all life on earth and we have the ability to manipulate our environments on an unprecedented scale.  We are extraordinarily powerful and vastly successful from an evolutionary standpoint.
SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,jonygone,0,Thu Jul 2 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"top species? in what way? we are not the most numerous, nor the most biomassive, nor the most resitant to elements, nor the oldest, nor the most pervasive in all enviroments. other animals exist at our whim? what is that supposed to mean? that we control everything other animals do? obviously not true. that other animals only exist cause we let them? obviously also not true otherwise there would be no mosquitos, rats, cockroaches, pathogens, and countless other life forms we would like to get rid of. so what do you mean with being ""top"" and other animals existing at our whim?    If we wanted to we could exterminate almost all life on earth   hurray? we could actually exterminate all life by dropping all the atomic bombs and turning it too radioactive for life on this planet; but that would include exterminating ourselves as well. there is no way for us to exterminate all life exept ourselves, not even close; there are countrless organisms that are far more resilient to cataclismic changes then us.   we have the ability to manipulate our environments on an unprecedented scale.  We are extraordinarily powerful and vastly successful from an evolutionary standpoint.   sure. but that doesn't make us dominant or top. it just makes us relativilvy succecfull in this short sliver of life-time on earth.  other organisms would better survive meteor impacts, radioactive increases, temperature increases and decreases, etc.   we are extraordinarily dependent on technology, namely electric and computational tech. if there were a sufficiently strong Coronal mass ejection hitting earth that would destroy all electrical things, we would not be able to heat and cool our homes, our food, or transport anything, or use tractors, or use irrigation, sewage, water, all that is dependent on electric technology. we would be instantly thrown back into pre industrial era and as a consequence about 90% would die in the first month due to food and water shortages. and there's really nothing we can do about it nowadays. another example is our food has become very monoverse(?). we live basically on wheat and rice; if some disease would wipe out these two species of grain (as happened IE in ireland with the potato) we'd be doomed to starvation. speaking of diseases, we have never been as susceptible to a global epidemic  as today. before tribes used to get wiped out by disease, but it would not spread to other tribes due to the isolation; nowadays there is no isolation, if one part of the world gets it, any part of the world can and does get it; and nowadays all it takes is some madman with a biology knowledge and some very basic equipment to engineer some super bacteria or virus that could easily wipe us all out. we are threading a thin line; building magnificent castles on wooden foundations; all it takes is a little shake and it all comes crumbling down. also it's a simple matter or evolution that as a species become more numerous, so do the species that can benefit from that species (IE predators, parasites, viruses, etc).  I don't see how you can call a species that only existed for 0.1M years successful. there has been literally countless species that have thrived for much longer then that and have gone extinct later on.  so again, I ask, how exactly do we ""dominate earth""?"

SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,Hairless_Talking_Ape,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"My point is that if beetles, ants, spiders and insects of all kinds were scaled up to the size of deer, canines and birds, they would dominate life on this planet. Their hard exoskeletons, strength and many other unique features would allow them to not only dominate the world under our feet, but our forests, plains, mountains and deserts."
SpeculativeEvolution,3bluvi,Wulf_Star_Strider,2,Tue Jun 30 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"The exoskeleton is a huge limit to growth.  A. It needs to be shed for growth to continue. That means for a time the animal has no skeleton. On land that means beyond a certain size the animal is crushed by its own weight when it molts.  B. The exoskeleton, while providing armor as well as support ends up weighing more than an internal skeleton for a given amount of support. This soon results in appendages that either cant support the animal or dont have enough room inside to contain the muscles needed to move them.  Naturally both problems can be partly overcome by being on a planet with low gravity, but animals with internal skeletons would also be so advantaged and still be able to grow bigger than creatures with exoskeletons."

They sort of stair-step from her hips and converge towards each other near the tail's tip. It's not apparent here (cuz she's all contorted) but in the book there are full layouts that show all the muscles and a definite lack of knee-tail.

The book also goes into the evolution of these species in a larger context, so you'll see homologous structures throughout certain branches of this world's life.  Since centaurs cannot easily stoop their upper body to reach low lying plants they rely on a peculuiar method of ingestion to eat while on the move. Centaurs graze through grasping mouths on the base of their four hooves.  These toothed orifices are attached to a length of esophagus-like tissue that runs the length of the centaur's limbs.

SpeculativeEvolution,3b58hl,Rauisuchian,11,Fri Jun 26 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"Seems very ambitious. Despite my sympathy for the brand, I'd say it's a desperate move from an archaic evolutionary line struggling in a changing market. Amphibians' share is dwindling fast, as they are particularly vulnerable to climate change and pollution, and have difficulties moving into new ecosystems. The economy is just changing too fast. This jurassic business logic of expanding at the top of the pyramid just seems to confirm that. Despite this, there might be some opportunities for restructuring - but there is no time to lose.  I think they will change their mind on the pack-hunting, it seems more for fit for a stalking type of creature, and frogs lack the mobility, having to stay wet and not being very fast, even with a 400% increase in muscle mass they will still have an amphibian waggle or a tiring jumping gait and most importantly rely on a local, wet environment. Instead it seems more efficient to focus on metabolism and pollution first. As it stands now, they're doing bad where they should be doing well and there are even parasitic fungi getting the better of them. Step up your game, frogs.   After this internal restructuring, I think there are three niches where their plan could work out. One is an evolution from tree-climbing frogs. Bats are the most common mammals, and have proven to be mobile and adaptive to the changing world. Becoming larger and camouflaged frogs might be able to catch bats with their tongue. Fangs could indeed come in handy and have proven feasible for limnonectes already. Another niche is that of the waterside, where they could be a sort of mobile, r-selected lurking predator of birds and small fauna and fish. While most frog ecosystems are dwindling, with some adaptations they could maybe eat gulls and rats in freshwater docks, ducks and water fowl in parks. A mini-crocodile for a human and post-human world, if you will. The third niche is a very short term plan that could nonetheless boost their numbers immensely. It relies on muscle mass and self loathing alone. This could enable a symbiotic relationship with homo sapiens sapiens, who'll feed them the last fish, and later on jellyfish to breed them for their tasty hind legs."

Though only four feet tall, they hunt down any creatures they think worth their while. While juvenile specimens hunt only small animals, the adults are known to execute several extraordinary tactics. When hunting, they will often send scouts to find an animal that would be a worthwile target-as their attacks are planned over the course of days to sometimes months. After the scouts select a target, the hunting group will emerge from the den and track it- learning what it eats, where it moves, what lures it in, and any routine the creature has. The raptors will then use whatever resources available to them to create a trap suitable for the creature, using their claw tools to drag logs and other large objects around, then using a specialized saliva to adher then together. They commonly make walls in this way, forming guided paths, then dig trenches so that the paths are lowered. These paths can lead to any number of things, such as an enviromental hazard put to use, an inescapable dead-end (For larger dinosaurs that need space to turn around), or an ambush. Methods of getting the dinosaurs there often include using either a bait (Stolen eggs/ offspring of the dinosaur, meat or live prey, a member of the creature's pack or herd, etc.), by chasing them in (If they are threatened by them), or building the paths in an area the dinosaur would normally walk. After the prey is dispatched of, they will drag it to an area nearby their den to allow the non-hunters of their pack to feed as well. These raptors prefer to stay out of pure combat situations, because their skin is soft compared to most dinosaurs and is easily gripped and torn by claws. However, if forced into such a situation, the raptors will first attempt to make scratches or punctures in the flesh of the attacker, then spray a highly painful poison into the wound. If this does not work, and one is eaten, special predator wards line the underside of the raptors, which release the  same poison into the mouth of the attacker when punctured. Ars Imperatoriaraptor is also known to modify territory surrounding the den, putting up walls with gaps between only dinosaurs their size or smaller can get through, building platforms that only their great vertical springing legs can reach, or digging pits in hopes of catching smaller dinosaurs running through. If one gets lost from the rest of the pack, they will build walls around themselves and begin making a series of clicking sounds, as is their means of communication, calling to the pack to come their way.  The main threat these creatures face in the wild is other raptors. Many other raptors are pack hunters, and most others are suited to all-out combat. A more aggresive species in a similarly sized pack can easily take out the Imperatoriaraptors."

The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins explains the process of evolution from a gene-centered perspective: Organisms are actually just vehicles for genes to propagate themselves, and we should see genes, and populations of related genes, as the main units of evolution. The Dinosaur Heresies by Robert T. Bakker, argues that dinosaurs were warmblooded, agile, birdlike creatures. This was revolutionary when the book was first published, but is now widely accepted. The blog Tetrapod Zoology by paleontologist Darren Naish has many posts about the taxonomic relationships of modern animals, and evolutionary histories of prehistoric animals.   Documentaries:   The BBC documentaries Walking with Monsters, Walking with Dinosaurs, and Walking with Beasts (all of which should be on Netflix) are great shows about the evolution of life and prehistoric animals. Some interesting topics include the arthropod-dominated Paleozoic and the migration to land, the early dinosaurs and mammal-like reptiles of the Triassic, the ferocious marine reptiles of the Jurassic, and the evolution of whales from land animals. Some of the information is outdated by now, but not much--all the corrections should be in the Wikipedia articles for each series. First Life by David Attenborough discusses the origin of life and the Cambrian explosion. Life of Birds (on Netflix and Youtube) is an excellent documentary series, also voiced by David Attenborough, about the attributes of birds and how they evolved. It describes the existence of birds as a struggle for supremacy between birds and mammals for the past 65 million years, making evolution into a compelling story. Cave of Forgotten Dreams (should be on Netflix as of now) is an awesome documentary about the oldest cave paintings in the world, preserved for tens of thousands of years in a cave in France. The cave paintings are a window into the culture of Stone Age humans, Cro-Magnons, and the world they lived in."

I'd imagine some form of little wriggly thing or bacterium-analogue that's constantly on the move breaking down silicon based materials and excreting silicon dioxide based ""shell"" as it moves on.  Metabolic problems to overcome - there are few if any gaseous sources of silicon to use, and thus you may be restricted to what you can harvest from surfaces.  An alternate possibility involves it breaking down silica (silicon dioxide) for the oxygen and expelling the silicon as a waste product, possibly combined with a different gas from the atmosphere, possibly as the metal.  Provide a way for the original beast to get the oxygen from the second, and you've got the start of a silicon/oxygen breathing cycle to compare to a carbon/oxygen one.  Alternate:  Organism 1 - looks like a tree, absorbs oxygen from the air, and uptakes silicon from around its ""roots"".  In its ""leaves"" it combines the silicon and oxygen and harvests energy from the process to live on.  In the process the leaves grow until they're too heavy and break off, falling to the ground.  Organism 2.  Uses energy obtained from an external source (heat, sun, radiation) to break down silicon dioxide into silicon and oxygen, storing the silicon as growth material - a shell perhaps, or the equivalent of bones?  It releases the oxygen as waste, and eventually when it dies, the silicon rich body is deposited amongst the ""roots"" of Organism 1."

This is its powerful affinity for oxygen. When carbon is oxidized during the respiratory process of a terrestrial organism (see respiration), it becomes the gas carbon dioxide – a waste material that is easy for a creature to remove from its body. The oxidation of silicon, however, yields a solid because, immediately upon formation, silicon dioxide organizes itself into a lattice in which each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygens. Disposing of such a substance would pose a major respiratory challenge.""  So, you'd probably need something in the organism with an even high affinity for oxygen than silicone.

SpeculativeEvolution,3akydn,comkiller,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:14:45 2015 UTC,"Insufficient information.  What the environment and such is for the hypothetical silicon based life forms is absolutely critical to for answering your question.  For instance, if people sat down and built silicon based life forms for our world (the oxygen laced portion, different answer for the other portions), their metabolisms would probably be pretty similar: hydrocarbons to CO2 and H2O because it is a damn good idea as far as getting a significant amount of energy out of said environment in a rich and renewable way.  The only difference there would be they would probably be slow growing and slow healing – requiring large quantities of energy to process sand and the like into their usable body components.  Large quantities of ATP (or an equivalent quick energy storing/releasing small molecule that can be used to phosphorylate or otherwise convert –OH groups on carbon, and especially on silicon, into good leaving groups), and Large quantities of NAD(P)H (or equivalent small chemically reducing molecule ... perhaps preferably a MUCH stronger reductant as silicon oxides are involved) would be needed to process clay, sand, or perhaps even rock (bad investment on biological energy though) into usable silicon, silica, silicone, and other silicon based small molecules used for assembly of their body and their critical macromolecules, like whatever silicon based materials they use for DNA, proteins, etc....  A lot more can be done chemically speaking with silicon when more then just Si(x)O(n)H(m) is used.  Getting nitrogen involved greatly opens the prospects for more stable and interesting silicon based molecules, so I would suggest in the open air atmosphere part of our world their would be good selection pressure for them to be nitrogen fixing or rabid consumers of biological material high in nitrogen (they might like animal urine if that is the case).  The true possibilities of silicon open up much further still when it is allowed to incorporate large quantities of carbon into the molecules it is making.  In other environments outside our world that may not be possible – so again you need to specify the environment you are talking about here, but in Earth's oxygen and carbon rich surface world, there is so much easily available carbon about it is impossible to imagine they would not be incorporating large quantities of it into their bodies.  When you allow for high carbon and silicon containing molecules, amazing things are possible: you could have creatures with moissanite skeletons or scales/shells (these will be about as indestructible as biological organism even vaguely resembling what we now consider biology could possibly get), and could theoretically produce thermally resistant silicone based hides and organs, possibly allowing them to fill strange ecological niches far too hot for carbon based lifeforms such as in and around thermal vents and active volcanic cones (but not all the way in swimming in the lava – that is still too hot – just really close to it, and perhaps even able to walk over it for brief periods).  Of the many unanswered interesting questions by OP, is are the creatures we talking about still water based?  There is a lot of possibility for non-water based creatures with silicon.  If we are allowing lots of carbon and nitrogen (again highly recommended for interesting creatures) you could build entire creatures whose fluids were based on silicone oils and ionic liquids.  Such creatures could do very well in the deepest driest deserts in the world as their is almost no evaporation of such liquids at even the worst of those temperatures.  Their excretions would still probably need to be relatively concentrated and preferably dry, and they would need to be regenerating their (admittedly minimal) fluids loss metabolically through the silicon they consume (lots of sand around for them to eat!)  The only thing they would be hard up for in the deep desert is a good energy source, and good carbon sources (though it is possible they are solar powered and can fix any carbon they need from CO2 like plants.  So much high energy activity though would predict that these are extremely slow growing and moving creatures with little energy to spare for movement beyond their base biological functions).  If you want examples of organisms that already exist in our world that have silica metabolisms (though not their primary function or metabolism) there are plenty of plants that fill that roll:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759229/  But again, for me to be more specific (in speculating) I need to know what environment OP is imagining silicon based life in."

In addition to electric eels and electric bacteria like you mentioned, there are hundreds of species of electric fish. The electric eel is actually just one of many fish who have evolved electrogenesis, the ability to generate electric fields, and this ability has evolved several times independently. Electric fish are also capable of electroreception--detecting electrical fields. Notably, electric eels use these two abilities hand-in-hand, creating electrical pulses and then seeing if they bounce back from anything, to hunt for fish and locate objects. This is actually the main way the electric eel senses its environment.  Many non-electric fish also use electroreception to locate predators and prey. Sharks and rays are a notable example. Some mammals, like dolphins and platypuses also have evolved this ability.  So a speculative world full of electric organisms seems totally plausible. Yet there is one limitation to a world of electric organisms: Air is not nearly as conductive as water. Water (unless distilled) has an abundance of free ions that conduct electricity, allowing electric fish to do what they do. Air doesn't tend to have these free electrons floating around unless a very high voltage--think lightning or a Tesla coil--ionizes the air.  On land and in the air, only the largest, most energetically expensive organisms could send electrical pulses outside of their body. Even then, they aren't likely to travel very far. Some organisms might evolve the ability to shock predators and prey by touching them, but animals that shoot lightning aren't as likely, at least in an Earth-like atmosphere. Spending all that metabolic energy on creating electricity might be less advantageous than just having sharp claws.  That being said, there are some animals on land with limited electrical abilities. Some bees and echidnas can sense electrical fields from a short distance. Echidnas however can only detect electricity in damp soil. So the ability still appears to be limited outside of water."

Most common bony fish (teleosts), including most fish kept in aquaria or caught for food, are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive.

Not in a manner that could plausibly evolve.  Firstly that would be a lot of information to transmit, and would take a long time.  But more importantly: How does it get started? You clearly macro-organisms before it's possible.   In fact, you clearly need quite advanced eyes, with well-developed lenses, in addition to highly evolved laser emission.  So you've got this very evolved species, how does it start having laser-sex?

The tricky thing would be to make sure that it doesn't kill the creature, but stranger adaptations have happened.  Also, let's not be kingdomist.  Eucalyptus trees secrete flammable oils and resist fire in order to burn away competition, though they need to wait for an external spark.

The resultant pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close, thus protecting the beetle's internal organs. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid partially becomes a gas by flash evaporation and is expelled explosively through an outlet valve, with a loud popping sound.

SpeculativeEvolution,3ah0w7,Menno_Ghetto,7,Sat Jun 20 02:37:58 2015 UTC,"Why must they be bipedal? Animals can be sapient without walking on their hind feet. The main things that are required are big brains, manipulators, access to resources, and an incentive to evolve intelligence. Manipulators can be hands, beaks, mouthparts, trunks, tongues, etc. Think of what a technologically advanced crow species would use. Not its wings, certainly. More likely its beak and feet.   Access to resources doesn't limit sapience but it does limit technology. Arguably the some of the most importaint technologies are metallurgy and fire, which can't be used underwater. A race of dolphins will probably develop sophisticated oral tradition, language, and agriculture.  Evolution doesn't have ""goals."" It must be considered as a pushing force, not a pulling force. Dinosaurs didn't evolve feathers because they might want to fly someday. They evolved feathers for other reasons we're not 100% sure of and flight was just a logical way to use them. Likewise, intelligence will evolve first to be used for specific purposes - pack hunting, memory, socializing, finding food - and only when the species comes to rely on it more than any other asset of theirs will they develop advanced technology and culture. Intelligence tends to evolve more easily in generalist omnivores and occasionally carnivores like rats, crows, dolphins, pigs, and primates, so keep that in mind.  Mind you, if you want humanoid beavers then by all means have humanoid beavers. But if you're looking for realism, these tips will help you make believable sapient races.  You don't have to write their evolutionary backgrounds into your setting. The reader doesn't need to know the details, but they can tell when you've put thought into it. That's what gives a story and setting depth."

SpeculativeEvolution,3ah0w7,malicious-monkey,7,Sat Jun 20 05:53:46 2015 UTC,I disagree with NDR700. Kangaroos are bipedal and have tails. So are birds and so were many dinosaurs.

SpeculativeEvolution,3ah0w7,rathat,5,Sat Jun 20 06:06:20 2015 UTC,"The tail rule depends on whether the animal stands pillar erect like a penguin or human, or therapodal like a kangaroo or velociraptor. If it's pillar erect, a thick tail will just get in the way. If it's therapodal, a tail is almost always necessary to keep balanced. When designing creatures you have to ask yourself, how does this animal stay on its feet? Where is its center of mass? The center of mass should lie directly above where the feet touch the ground when the animal is standing still. A common mistake is to have a creature standing on two tiny hooves with nothing to balance it on the tail end. A person can look at a creature and, knowing nothing about this stuff, still intuitively tell if the creature's going to topple over."

SpeculativeEvolution,3a8u9x,Rauisuchian,26,Thu Jun 18 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"I think that a surviving ceratopsian might be able to take the niches that the hooved ungulates do in our world. Dinosaurs, having hollow but reinforced bones, and a more efficient respiratory system, can grow larger than mammals, and probably could run for longer periods of time. Both of those abilities help a grazing herbivore evade predation, so instead of proto-horses and proto-deer, we might see dinosaur equivalents.  Among these dinosaur-ungulates, some pretty interesting animals could appear. Whales and dolphins, for example, evolved from ungulates. If whales evolved not from mammals but from ceratopsians, they might have horns for attack and defense. Their more efficient lungs might allow them to become even larger than real whales. However, they might not develop echolocation as advanced as the real, mammalian whales, due to more primitive ear bones.  Among other ungulates, a chasmosaur-like lineage would probably evolve, diversifying in different ways and preempting the niches of horses, rhinos, and bovines. They would be tall and possess some level of armor, but not like their Mesozoic relatives. Due to competition from mammals, these chasmosaur-ungulates might need to evolve a more mammal-like posture and skeletal structure for faster running, and in a world of more and more familiar, angiosperm plants, especially grass, neck flexibility would be important so that they could access their food. These dinosaurs couldn't be as bulky as Triceratops, but they would still have the familiar face crests and horns.  Deer, antelope, and similar animals would instead be ceratopsians who retain their bipedal lifestyle, never re-evolving their heavy face crests, and becoming long-distance, high-speed runners who easily escape predators."
SpeculativeEvolution,3a8u9x,cromlyngames,7,Thu Jun 18 04:18:36 2015 UTC,there was a long phase of heavier and more defensive herbivores and predators co-evolving - things like smilodon. IIRC the balance only swung to light and faster vs faster co-evolution when the various proto-humans started to wiping out the slower defensive ones.
SpeculativeEvolution,3a8u9x,malevolent_moose,3,Thu Jun 18 12:23:09 2015 UTC,"True, but the two strategies (heavy and defensive/offensive vs light and fast) have always coexisted, even if one was more prevalent than the other.   In the Pleistocene there may have been fierce and powerful saber-toothed cats hunting massive, aggressive mammoths and mastodons... but there were also small foxes chasing familiar-looking rabbits, and medium-sized cheetahs and antelopes engaged in lightning-fast pursuit. Although most megafauna were killed off or outcompeted by humans, small and medium-sized animals have always had a significant role in ecosystems. They tend to be more numerous than big, impressive megafauna which require more food and biomass to exist.  So even in this alternate scenario--where animals evolve to become far different and some of them descend from ceratopsians--the speculative equivalents of deer would be evolving to more easily escape wolves, just as the equivalents of mastodons would be evolving to more easily defend against sabretooth cats. Both evolutionary arms races would be happening at the same time, for animals of different sizes and niches."

SpeculativeEvolution,38i5r7,MudnuK,6,Thu Jun 4 11:13:06 2015 UTC,"Biochemist here.  Ok I'm on mobile so this might be a bit of a hash.   The process you're interested in here is one in which ammonium and its derivatives is used analogously to oxygen in humans, where electrons are added to the ammonium along with an oxygen source to reduce it to nitrate. This is perfectly feasable and is done by many organisms already.   The idea of using hydrogen sulphide (H2S) as a reducing agent is also fine - there are also bacteria that do this!  As for the sulphur ions being converted to sulphate upon reacting with oxygen, this is even better! That big energy release doesnt have to be released as heat, it can be stored by the cell just as other forms of energy can. I can explain more if you like but i dont want to bog you down with the nitty gritty just yet.  There are also bacteria that do this.   The issue is scaling up. This is because ammonia is somewhat toxic to cells. Not an issue if youre a bacterium living in an acidic environment (NH3 is toxic whereas NH4+ is not, again i can explain if you wish), but once you get bigger and bigger this ammonia issue becomes more significant. In our own bodies, we have a very expensive (in energy terms) pathway that converts ammonia into urea, whilst birds have a similar thing that converts it to uric acid.  Another note is just because you have this system, doesnt mean you dont need to eat other things. Having energy from this system is great, but you still need carbon to make all those big molecules necessary for complex life!  So to summarise what we have so far: this organism gets its energy from hydrogen sulphide and uses ammonium as an electron acceptor. It requires a carbon source, either complex such as carbohydrates or something simpler like fats, oils, or carbon dioxide if it posseses a mechanism for removing it from the atmosphere. If it is multicellular it will likely require some sort of adaptation that lets it deal with the masses of ammonia in its system, which leads me on to more speculative points...  So here are things that are really just ideas or opinions that I cant really say for definite because that science doesnt exist as far as I know:  A method for dealing with ammonia could be a capture-and-store idea. Some mechanism exists that ammonium entering the body is captured and attached to another molecule, and can then be released as needed. This is actually done by bacteria using glutamate/glutamine.  Ammonia and hydrogen sulphide arent as good at their jobs as oxygen and carbohydrates. Maybe your creatures are slower growing because of this?  As for the reverse reactions with photosynthesis-like chenistry, theres no real reason why not! The hydrogen sulphide to sulphate pathway can definitely go in reverse with the right energetics, but this really depends on environmental factors. This might be how hydrogen sulphide and ammonium are regenerated in the atmosphere.   Then the big problem of waste management. Your substrates are found usually gaseous or dissolved in water, whilst the products (nitrate and sulphate) are pretty much exclusively found dissolved in water or as an ionic salt solid. Therefore these creatures are going to need a very efficient way to deal with salts in their bodies.   Ask away if theres anytging I've missed!"

SpeculativeEvolution,38c23q,Rauisuchian,4,Wed Jun 3 06:37:47 2015 UTC,How about we discuss the possible evolutionary paths this creature could have taken?  What would be the necessary environment for this organism to have evolved?
SpeculativeEvolution,38c23q,rafaelhr,3,Wed Jun 3 14:23:44 2015 UTC,"Camouflage, darkness and mating comes to mind.  Maybe it lives in a environment where plants glow (for some reason) and it decided to grow large glowing lumps, to blend in.  It could use its lights to attract prey, if it's a predator.  Or maybe, it's just a very elaborate ornament to impress the ladies."
SpeculativeEvolution,38c23q,JesterOfDestiny,5,Wed Jun 3 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"I like the sexual selection hypothesis. Maybe this is a female specimen, and the glowing orbs are unfertilized eggs. The males then see her, grab an egg and put it inside their gestational sacs. They then fertilize the egg and lay it. Females of this species would be migratory, seeking new males to fertilize their eggs, and the males would be the sex that raises the hatchlings.  Maybe they could use the eggs both as camouflage on their migratory routes in huge subterranean complexes and also for sexual selection, given that only fertile and healthy females would be able to display the eggs."
SpeculativeEvolution,38c23q,rafaelhr,3,Wed Jun 3 17:35:43 2015 UTC,"I like that idea.  I do wonder what kind of rituals they would have with the fertilization. Does the male just rip an egg off, or does he need to impress the female in some way? Is it painful? How many eggs do the males carry? Is the female involved with raising the child in some way, or does she just wander off after the act?  How do they even move with those on their backs? Are those eggs grow on the ends of little arms, or do they just jiggle around?"
SpeculativeEvolution,38c23q,JesterOfDestiny,2,Wed Jun 3 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"I guess a mating ritual to prove you're a worthy male would be needed. Regarding the pain, let's have its eggs be like chicken ones, only firmly held on tissue overgrowth. So, no pain at all. The male comes, impresses the female. Then, she lets him take one egg. He snaps it off one of her tendrils, puts it into his sac, and then she wanders off seeking new males. This would only happen in the mating season. The female probably spends her non-fertile days in an all-female haven.  As for locomotion, I'm guessing she moves very slowly to balance her body. There could be massive sexual dimorphism, where the females are big and slow, and the males are smaller and quicker. There could even be a stealth tactic among non-worthy males of quickly stealing an egg and running away."

I think you might be able to justify these creatures evolving an upright or sometimes-upright torso posture under the right conditions.  Perhaps, like humans, they started out arboreal, using their hands and arms to grasp branches and pick fruit, then began hunting and found holding their head and shoulders upright to be useful for throwing things and peering over undergrowth.  I don't know about your species, but mine will also be closer to mammals than reptiles, and produce milk, so holding their torso upright has the additional advantage of allowing newborns access to the breasts (especially when held in the arms), and saving females from dragging the sensitive, unscaled area over the ground."

I can't think of any that would inhabit all three, though. (edit: except the giant petrel)  Terrestrial and aquatic:   Most crocodiles are unchallenged in freshwater and/or coastal saltwater ecosystems, and nearby river banks and coasts. They generally feed on whatever they want, and even on land they are fast runners and strong enough to defend against pack carnivores (e.g. lions).  Killer whales can kill sharks, and have no predators when they remain with the rest of their pods. They also jump onto ice floes and slide along short beaches to hunt seals and walruses. Prehistoric Spinosaurus was a semi-aquatic apex predator but large enough to have no predators on land either.   Terrestrial and aerial:   Large eagles are the apex predators in many ecosystems, preying on most of the land animals in these ecosystems, and being unchallenged in the air. Prehistoric azhdarchid pterosaurs like Quetzalcoatlus were so large that they would have had no natural predators on land or in the air, although probably would've spent most of their time on land.   Aerial and aquatic:   The bald eagle hunts fish and has no natural predators. The similar African fish eagle does the same, but also hunts animals as tall as flamingos. The albatross feeds on fish and other marine life, while being one of the largest birds in the sky."
SpeculativeEvolution,36yiuu,polistes,3,Sat May 23 05:38:09 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I'll have to look into the rest of these examples, but can we just talk about Crocodiles for a minute.  Crocodiles are considered Aquatic Apex Predators, by the only list I can make reference to, Source. (If anyone has a superior list, I'm all ears.)  As far as my information goes, Crocodiles live almost exclusively near water, and despite not being commonly preyed upon when they are outside of the water, they don't appear to be very efficient land predators. Generally their fighting tactic is an ambush approach, using the water to hide, and despite their bursts of speed on land, the largest portion of their hunting still appears in the water.  By my standards, it appears to be more of an Apex in the water, but lacks the ability to actually survive effectively if it were to be without water, be it due to body temperature or what have you. On the other hand, Lions are much more effective land predators than crocodiles.

Larger species of crocodiles are predators, and are generally not preyed upon as adults. They may rely on ambush to hunt, but as long as they hunt for their food, and nothing eats them, that makes them an apex predator.   Some crocodiles, like the black caiman, also hunt terrestrially at night."

Hunting and diet of article  Black caiman:       Hatchlings mostly eat small fish, frogs and invertebrates such as, crustaceans and insects but as juveniles graduate to eating larger fish, including piranhas, catfish, and perch, which remain a significant food source for all black caiman, including adults. Current known dietary studies have focused on young caimans (due both to their often being more common than large adults and easier to handle), the largest specimen examined for stomach contents in one study being only 1.54 m (5.1 ft) notably under sexually mature size, which is at a minimum 2 m (6.6 ft) in smaller females. Although diverse prey is known to be captured by young black caimans, dietary studies have shown snails often dominate the diet of young caiman, followed by quite small fish.     Various prey will be taken by availability, includes snakes, turtles, birds and mammals, the latter two mainly when they come to drink at the river banks. Mammalian prey mostly include common Amazonian species such as various monkeys, sloths, armadillos, pacas, agoutis, coatis, and capybaras. Larger specimens can virtually take any South American terrestrial or riparian vertebrate unfortunate enough to encounter them. Large prey can include smaller species of caiman, deer, peccaries, tapirs, anacondas, giant otters,  and domestic animals including pigs, cattle, horses and dogs. Where capybara and white-lipped peccary herds are common, they are reportedly among the most common prey item for large adults.   Evidence has suggested fairly large river turtles can be counted among the prey of adult black caiman, the bite force of which is apparently sufficient to shatter a turtle shell.  Scars on Amazon river dolphins suggest they may occasionally be attacked by black caimans.  Compared to the smaller caiman species, the black caiman more often hunts terrestrially at night, using its acute hearing and sight.  As with all crocodilian species, their teeth are designed to grab but not chew, so they generally try to swallow their food whole after drowning it. Large prey that cannot be swallowed whole are often stored so the flesh will rot enough to allow the caiman to take bites out of the flesh.

The differences between the three is entirely dietary, which in turn depends on their location.   Diets most certainly affect their society, as they quite literally are what they eat. If they survive of of a purely vegetable diet, there will be very little in their to supplement their (unusual) brains. Metals provide a good base, and eating living things (yes, their brains) also forms a great supplement. This means that Dryads are about at the level of a gorilla, trolls aren't that bright, but are functional, and Orcs are scarily sharp. (This of course is stereotyping, as it's rare for a troll to eat ONLY one thing.)   Orc society is mostly nomadic, although there are a few small settlements on the plains (Domesticated goats)  Trolls are the most common variant, for a given level of ""trollishness""   Trolls do not eat ONLY rocks, but do get a surprising (i.e. bullshit) amount of energy from the local strata.

SpeculativeEvolution,36f229,autowikibot,1 point,Mon May 18 22:51:42 2015 UTC,"Section 5. Mechanism of trapping of article  Venus flytrap:       The Venus flytrap is one of a very small group of plants capable of rapid movement, such as Mimosa, the Telegraph plant, sundews and bladderworts.  The mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. The trap only shuts when the trigger hair is stimulated twice: this is to avoid that the mechanism be triggered from dust and other elements brought by the wind. In the open, untripped state, the lobes are convex (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are concave (forming a cavity). It is the rapid flipping of this bistable state that closes the trap,  but the mechanism by which this occurs is still poorly understood. When the trigger hairs are stimulated, an action potential (mostly involving calcium ions—see calcium in biology) is generated, which propagates across the lobes and stimulates cells in the lobes and in the midrib between them.  It is hypothesized that there is a threshold of ion buildup for the Venus flytrap to react to stimulation.  The acid growth theory states that individual cells in the outer layers of the lobes and midrib rapidly move 1H+ (hydrogen ions) into their cell walls, lowering the pH and loosening the extracellular components, which allows them to swell rapidly by osmosis, thus elongating and changing the shape of the trap lobe. Alternatively, cells in the inner layers of the lobes and midrib may rapidly secrete other ions, allowing water to follow by osmosis, and the cells to collapse. Both of these mechanisms may play a role and have some experimental evidence to support them.

(Ilion is a good example of this)   On a tidally locked planet, definitely. On a very slowly rotating planet, this would also be the case, but there may be a large landmass stretching from the far north to far south (like the Americas or Afro-Eurasia on Earth), which would provide a large physical barrier. Sea life that stayed put would have to go dormant to survive changes, or die and release spores. The only way to reliably stay in the irradiated side would be to migrate around the continent each rotation. But since the oceans are a good insulator, many organisms could probably survive under the ice.   This is all extremely interesting, but I highly doubt evolution would reward migratory species.

But it wouldn't be common at all, since only large herbivores and top-chain carnivores could afford to spend all that energy on being constantly on the move.   Very valid points--such a migration would take a significant amount of energy. Early life forms would have a pretty difficult time of this. More complex lifeforms, if they can't move as fast, have a slower metabolism, or don't receive a lot of energy would also have to find other solutions than migration. As you said, large herbivores and the top level carnivores that hunt them would, most likely, be the most prolific migrators with other species finding other solutions.  However, the inspiration for this scenario was the diurnal vertical migration in the ocean. Every day and night, plankton use currents to migrate from shallow waters to deep water and back. This allows them to feed in ideal areas, avoid predation, or possibly avoid too much light exposure. The lanternfish is one of the most common fish in the ocean and makes this same journey daily, from 10-100 m deep at night to 300-1,500 m deep during the day.  On a slowly-rotating planet, the twilight zone may move far slower than the solar terminator on Earth. The slower the rotation, the easier it would be for smaller animals to make this migration. An Earth-sized planet with a rotation of 2 weeks would have a scorching day side and freezing night side like a tidally locked planet, but the speed of the rotation would make migration impossible for anything but flying seabirds. A planet with a Venus-like rotation of 116 days would allow animals to migrate at a more manageable pace, but they would have to be good long-distance runners on land, fast fliers in the air, or plankton/small fish that can follow currents with little effort of their own. A planet whose day lasted 365 days or more, would allow most organisms to migrate to stay in their preferred climate, especially if they can drift in oceanic currents, fly in air currents, or if they live as parasites inside, or commensalists on the outside, of another creature.   Migration would also be easier for organisms that don't live at the equator. The closer they live to the poles, the less they have to move to stay within the twilight zone. But the planets would have to have a quite slow rotation for equatorial organisms to be able to keep up with the sunrise/sunset.  TL;DR: You're right, but it depends on how fast the planet rotates. Also creatures as small as plankton migrate from the sea surface to sea floor every day showing that migration is possible by simple organisms."

There is no way for this to be a natural process; on the other hand, the technology that would allow for this is not that far in the future (see for yourselves if you don't believe me). Out of the bunch, telepathy is in fact the most rudimentary level of universal comunication, although it would also be the most accurate: Babel Fishes and Universal Translators, while more complex and at times more convenient, may have serious issues dealing with logical, morphosyntactic and structural differences between languages. This is already true on Earth: when translating from a language to a structurally different one, you may need to completely deconstruct and restate an entire paragraph in order to deliver a message close to the original one. For what is worth, I'm an Italian student in Translation Studies, but really, anybody who speaks deeply different languages will tell you the same.

If you're trying to convey a concept (what else would you do, when communicating?), by definition, concepts are more than the sum of the words used to define them. Why yes, written sentences can't be as obviously translated into wordless/grammarless thoughts, but that's because, while they started as thoughts, they are now an entirely different beasts. On the other hand, if you're trying to get a thought to be a thought in someone else's brain, and you do that using a language, you're doing this: your concept -> sentence in language A -> sentence in language B -> your interlocutor's concept.

I have a really hard time imagining how telepathy is supposed to be experienced.  I usually think of it as transferring imagined sensations and stimuli (sending whatever you ""see"" in your mind's eye to someone else, for example), as well as emotions (which I always think are kind of like sensations)...

SpeculativeEvolution,35sy6g,Tijuano,3,Wed May 13 07:00:42 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I'm mainly asking to look for some ways that organisms on a high-gravity planet could make themselves as light as possible.  Do you know of any other interesting materials they could use for support structures?
SpeculativeEvolution,35sy6g,Tijuano,3,Wed May 13 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"Well, let's look at the problem like a buoyancy problem. You could make yourself as light as possible, or you could make yourself the least dense as possible. On a hyper-gravitational planet, you could have organisms with natural bladders of helium or nitrogen, which would not necessarily make them lighter but they would be able to stand. Furthermore, in a hyper-gravity environment, atmospheric density is much greater because the weight of the atmosphere compresses it, so we'd also need to be able to withstand these pressures.    Imagine, if you will, a large, bulbous sac, with maybe a beak or jaw of some sort, standing on two to four long spindly legs, where everything below the knee is actually a carbon reinforced talon of bone (essentially claws coming from its underside, where the phalanges themselves are not too long, but the flesh only reaches slightly past what we would call a knee, which then extends to a long growth of reinforced bone. It's head is full of helium or hydrogen it produces because of a symbiotic bacteria, and it feeds on various forms of plant and minerals in order to sustain its largely elemental diet.    I'll edit with a picture soon."
SpeculativeEvolution,35sy6g,Tijuano,3,Wed May 13 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to that picture.  But I'm trying to design a sapient species from a higher gravity planet for a story set in a future where they've more-or-less taken over Earth, and I already have a vague notion that they'd be roughly the size of cats, with 4-6 ""walking"" legs and maybe additional limbs for manipulation.  (All of their limbs would be somewhat dexterous and grasping, since I imagine them moving mainly by brachiation in their natural habitat.  I figure, if an orangutang can do it on Earth, something cat-sized could do it on their planet.)  So right now I'm focusing on figuring out the finer details of their biology, like what sort of structures and materials they'd use for support, how their muscles could work, that sort of thing.  I'd like to make them as light and low-density as possible, but I'd rather they not be walking gas-bags.  You're design sounds really cool though.  It would definitely be good for some other fauna on their homeworld.  For my sapients, I'm thinking of maybe using compressed gas as part of a support structure in the same way that animals on earth use water in a hydrostatic skeleton.  These guys could have an ""aerostatic skeleton"".  I'm assuming that the compressed gas would weigh a lot less than water, but wouldn't provide any kind of buoyant lift."
SpeculativeEvolution,35sy6g,Rauisuchian,3,Wed May 13 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"Here's the picture.    I was thinking that any species evolving in a hypergravitational environment would develop in a rather insectoid manner, at least in that they would have a hard carapace or exoskeleton. Atmospheric pressures would be much higher, and an exoskeletal structure would certainly help protect the internal ""squishies"" and such. I like your idea of bladders as as musculoskeletal structure (like spider legs). It would certainly shed a lot of weight. Now, the picture above shows external gasbags, though I'm thinking perhaps your sapients could have something analogous to a swim bladder in fish: a small compartment of lighter than air gas, perhaps derived as a waste product of a symbiotic bacteria of sorts? It would not only provide internal pressure to counter the immense external pressure, it would also provide for some upward force (buoyancy) to counter gravity."
SpeculativeEvolution,35sy6g,Tijuano,2,Wed May 13 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"Here's the picture.   Interesting creature. Reminds me of Half-Life aliens. The external gas bag and armored lower body definitely seem like viable strategies for an organism like this.   I was thinking that any species evolving in a hypergravitational environment would develop in a rather insectoid manner, at least in that they would have a hard carapace or exoskeleton.   However, in general, I think a higher gravity world might have fewer arthropod-type creatures than Earth. Crustaceans and insects both have significant troubles breathing and molting the larger they grow. Lobsters, coconut crabs, and other relatively massive arthropods often die trapped in their own heavy exoskeleton, because it takes so long and takes so much energy.  A half-armored creature like the ""Gasbag"" deals with these issues well, because it could crawl out of its lower half while molting. The partial exoskeleton is also less heavy than a full exoskeleton. On the other hand, with an arthropod covered entirely in its exoskeleton, mass becomes even more of a problem on a high-gravity planet. Large insects in our world need extensive respiratory systems that limit the room available for organs. Pseudo-arthropods with gas chambers on this high gravity world would need more and more gas chambers the larger they grow, until almost all of their body is filled with buoyant gas, with little room for other structures.  The majority of large creatures on this planet would probably be like the ""Gasbag"" and have an external gas bag on their upper body, and an armored lower body. Others might simply have thick, elephantine skin and a vertebrate skeletal structure."

SpeculativeEvolution,353qz8,Yanako,9,Wed May 6 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"If we were to find an alien species with technology and civilizations, I think they could easily be wildly different from humans and our hominid cousins. If we take a look at our own planet, there are many examples of animal intelligence across radically different organisms. Many of the animals exhibiting intelligent or social behaviors aren't closely related to humans.  Some examples:   Crocodiles use sticks as tools to catch birds. Crows, especially the New Caledonian crow, are able to make and use tools. Elephants use unspoken signals, like pointing, to communicate. Leafcutter ants don't eat the leaves that they harvest directly--they use them to cultivate a species of fungus. Orca have learned behaviors approximating culture. Bees communicate to each other specific information about food sources and their location.   So intelligence and tool use across different species is clearly possible. But that doesn't bring us all the way to civilization, just intelligence.   I would say that the real restriction to whether a species can develop urban civilization, and technology more advanced than sticks and stones, is the diversity of species of plants that are available to them. Almost all agricultural crops are angiosperms, flowering plants. Without the evolution of flowering plants, there would be very few vegetables, grains, fruits, and other edible parts of the plants that are cultivated for food here on Earth. There wouldn't even be grass for livestock to graze on marginal land. This would make getting enough food to support towns and cities very difficult, and populations probably wouldn't become large enough for civilizations and advanced technology to really rise except for a few isolated, seasonal settlements.  So really the evolution of societies and civilizations would have little to do with the shape or anatomy of the species we’re talking about, instead it would be mainly based on their environment, and whether it can support a civilization. Obviously the species would need a basic way to manipulate its environment, but that could be as simple as grabbing things with their mouths like birds. What matters is that there are edible plants, fungi, or some analogue that can be cultivated easily to support large populations in a concentrated area. Add a species with intelligence to that environment and you might see a civilization rise up after a few million years."
SpeculativeEvolution,353qz8,Rauisuchian,6,Thu May 7 05:27:14 2015 UTC,"Conceivably they could be incredibly different. We could go down the silicon based life route, or we could just get a bit strange.  Imagine an ecosystem in a gas giant. What might that look like? Various organisms utilising various buoyancy techniques to maintain themselves in the upper reaches of the thick atmosphere to avoid being crushed. Or maybe just evolving flight and limited or non existent sleep cycles.  Maybe we're talking about highly evolved single celled organisms whose intelligence is emergent when such highly social single celled organisms amass en masse? Such things are known to live here (look up slime molds) and exhibit great problem solving capability for amoeba.  Perhaps we could even look at a technologically advanced species that's almost like us and a little bit different to examine how little changes to physiology could drastically change the course of technological development. Take an aquatic species that roams over great vertical ranges in the sea, adapted from benthic to surface. Maybe they'd build nomadic structures, things that move with the tides, or maybe, devoid of a solid manufacturing base they never developed industrialisation, so that all their technology is the result of individual effort. To have a depth of technology on a scale with us today they'd probably have to have to have worked on their tech, evolved with it much longer than we've been able to bootstrap ourselves up. Maybe they evolved so that they used their bodies and understanding of science to create the effects they desired?"
SpeculativeEvolution,353qz8,Chaos_Philosopher,4,Thu May 7 09:13:39 2015 UTC,"They would have to be terrestrial, as underwater life would prohibit or limit things like tool-making, use of fire, agriculture, and creating various compounds, alloys, etc for tech.   Going by the evolutionary patterns of most intelligent species on earth (except for cephalopods, in some ways), an advanced alien species would most likely have bilateral symmetry, a head in the front of its body where the sensory/nerve systems are centralized (including a single pair of eyes, as well as a mouth)."
SpeculativeEvolution,353qz8,malevolent_moose,9,Fri May 8 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think underwater life would be a problem per se, the tech would just be different. There are already examples of octopodes using tools (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DoWdHOtlrk). However they don't live long and live in solitude so there is no social life to make much technological progress. Meanwhile, dolphins and other whales have social lives and are quite ingenious when it comes to hunting techniques, but they don't have hands or tentacles to make lasting symbols or tools.  Just my theory, but I think if by chance any creature evolves that is both social and can manipulate its environment, and you then give it an incentive to make technological progress (which is not always personal/group progress) you have a candidate for civilization, although just like with humans it could go very slowly at first.  If we interpret 'social' and 'manipulate its environment' and 'incentive' in the most different yet plausible ways we can find, I think that's a possibility for an alien species.   For example, it could be little sticky sea anemone type parasite that lives in colonies on top of enormous airship-like balloon organisms that do photosynthesis on a small planet with a super dense atmosphere. If the anemones breed too much their ship sinks and they dies off due to lack of light, if they grow too little they can be conquered by another colony. So they form a neuron network colony together, that keeps population in check, but also tries to keep outsiders away (they procreate asexually so outsider genes have no advantage but cooperation with your own colony is the same as protecting your own genes). They adapt biologically to become curious and culturally to steer the fins of their airships and make long chains to harvest rocks and stick-like waste from the surface, which they then use to make hooks and other weapons that would win them the arms race against other airships. Fast forward a couple of thousand years and the planet has only a couple of large ultra-intelligent neuron anemone networks that have airship enhancement factories and are plotting how to adapt their vessels for floating higher and higher, receiving more and more light and energy, making themselves to become more resistant to the cold and radiation,  and eventually making the leap to escape gravity and bring with them the solid materials they need to get to other planets. Sounds weird but not more weird than the story of humans."

SpeculativeEvolution,2ssd0x,cavemanrogers,5,Sun Jan 18 01:06:17 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it's hard to be sure of the long term effects. People in the past tried to help out ecosystems by introducing foreign species and it didn't always go so well. For example, the introduction of the grey squirrel into the UK has pretty much wiped out the native red squirrel and has damaged the oak tree population. Or the introduction of the cane toad to Australia, which became a massive crop pest.  It would be incredibly awesome to mess around with genetics on this sort of scale in a controlled environment though. Maybe it'd be useful eventually for terraforming planets."

SpeculativeEvolution,2ssd0x,pivazena,4,Sun Jan 18 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"All of my knowledge of the state of genetics is second-hand (and from a person who is at an undergraduate level in the field), but my impression is that genetic engineering is in its infancy. The kind of genetic engineering that you see the more out-there transhumanists talking about (as just one example of many) is, simply put, magical from our current perspective. Genetic engineering is a buzzword now, just like ""atomic"" used to be.  Genes are complicated. There's no such thing as a trait or structure that exists by virtue of a single gene. Everything that keeps a person (or a tree, or a muskrat, or whatever) alive exists because of many genes working together in complex ways that some extremely bright people are only just beginning to understand. Simply recombining the things in weird ways is much more likely to create unviable seeds or dead embryos than to accomplish anything of note. This goes double (or triple) for any attempts at crazy-ass hybrid organisms.  This is not to say that things won't ever change, or that relatively simple changes won't be possible in the near future, but I don't think anyone should be worried about anything too crazy right around the corner. For fictional purposes, of course, you are free to postulate multiple fundamental breakthroughs in the field of genetic engineering, or to ignore this problem altogether, but by that point you're better off deciding what to do by thinking about it in literary terms (or simply fitting it to your plot or characters) than consulting science about it.  With that in mind, if you've got animal-trees, why not go all out and have the things walk?"

SpeculativeEvolution,2qgiom,mtwara,8,Fri Dec 26 17:31:58 2014 UTC,"It's possible, but unlikely that they would look like people. Most bipedal organisms, both extinct and modern, have stood horizontally, using their tails for balance. Birds, bipedal dinosaurs, prehistoric crocodilians, kangaroos, squirrels, and others evolved along these lines.  Only humans and our immediate relatives stand vertically for a majority of the time. This behavior arose due to a particular set of circumstances that our evolutionary ancestors were exposed to. Primates evolved to live in the trees, so they were accustomed to reaching between branches. Hominid ancestors lost their tails, so to stand upright they had to actually stand upright and not just balance horizontally. And visibility was important among the tall grass of the African savanna, so standing vertically allowed Australopithecus and the like to see predators and prey from a distance.  So for a bipedal species to evolve to stand vertically, they would have to live in trees, lose their tails (or lack them in the first place), and then abandon the trees for grassy plains so they become permanent bipeds."
SpeculativeEvolution,2qgiom,Rauisuchian,3,Fri Dec 26 22:23:05 2014 UTC,Interesting. So a hyena-person with a tail would be basically impossible to occur naturally?
SpeculativeEvolution,2qgiom,Rauisuchian,5,Fri Dec 26 22:33:42 2014 UTC,"Most likely. If a group of hyenas evolved bipedalism but retained their tails, a horizontal stance would allow them to use the tail for balance, while a more vertical stance would make the tail less and less useful until it becomes vestigial or nonexistent. The former would be more advantageous and the evolved hyenas might look more like a bizarre mammalian version of a dinosaur, rather than a human."

SpeculativeEvolution,2icgdq,Rauisuchian,4,Sun Oct 5 09:02:01 2014 UTC,"The ocean is a vast and fertile collection of vacant niches, the first ants who manage to get a foothold there are going to radiate like gangbusters. They'll probably come up with something akin to the body plans of crustaceans to begin with, shrimp-ants and crab-ants and such, and then neotenous soft-bodied ones who retain their larval forms will take up the mantle of the fish. From there they can develop internal skeletons and scale up to larger sizes, maybe even wind up with vertebrate-like land animals again in the long run. An internal skeleton certainly seems to be necessary to get up to larger sizes, nothing exoskeletal has ever managed to get really big in the course of life on Earth.  On land, non-colonial species will also quickly radiate to occupy many of the niches that were left by solitary insects. Niches left by larger animals will have to wait, though, since ditching exoskeletons is not an easy evolutionary feat in a world already filled with competitors."
SpeculativeEvolution,2icgdq,FaceDeer,1 point,Sun Oct 5 16:19:54 2014 UTC,"I agree about oceanic evolution. And an endoskeleton is definitely the way to go for larger creatures. However, exoskeletal organisms can still get large until similarly-sized vertebrates appear. Jaekelopterus was a sea scorpion up to 2.5 meters long, and Arthropleura was a millipede up to 2.6 meters long.  The main limiting factors their exoskeleton will pose as they evolve to be larger are oxygen, moulting, and the structural properties of their legs. These will place an upper limit, but that upper limit will be pretty large.    Extra oxygen helps arthropods grow larger, but the last Meganisoptera giant dragonflies survived into the Permian, which has modern oxygen levels. Of course, air breathing adaptations would still help. Moulting will make large arthropods vulnerable to ants, wasps, and exhaustion while they are trying to crawl out of their old shell. Arthropods have a very sprawling posture as they move around. If they become large, they have to either rest on the ground most of the time like a tortoise does, or evolve a more erect posture (slightly less sprawling than a lizard, more so than a mammal) with strong legs.   But being ants, bees, and wasps adds extra challenges. As colonial organisms, it will be hard to feed every member of the colony if they are all giants.   So in order to be large they first have to become solitary, and then they can start slowly adapting within the constraints of their exoskeleton.  I would guess that the largest solitary ants will diverge into taller, praying mantis-like predators, and low-lying grasshopper-like herbivores. Large solitary bees will continue to fly and feed on nectar and pollen, but they will bully away smaller colonial bees. Large wasps will remain stinging predators, but they may lose flight and solely raid ant hills."
SpeculativeEvolution,2icgdq,FaceDeer,1 point,Sun Oct 5 21:13:03 2014 UTC,"Some thoughts as to the ""immediate"" aftermath (thousands of years):   The excess of plants in the ocean, with no predators, will cause an excess of oxygen. This will cause the insects to increase in size (no genetic change required, at first) exhaling more CO2. They will eat more terrestrial plants, and the atmosphere will gradually go back to normal--perhaps with a higher balance of oxygen. Other than the lower levels of CO2, most land plants will be fine, thanks to pollinating bees. Most parasitic wasps, except those that target ants, bees, and other wasps, go extinct.  Most carnivorous ants and wasps go extinct, but some of them continue to prey on each other, and detritivorous ants. Also, some resilient, generalist ants may be able to raid bee hives. Leafcutter ants will be disadvantaged at first by the low amount of CO2, but when atmosphere conditions return to normal, their secure source of food will make them highly successful."
SpeculativeEvolution,2icgdq,Pperson25,2,Sun Oct 5 09:10:55 2014 UTC,"A lot of plant species depend on large animals to transport their seeds, they'll probably go extinct pretty quickly. But there are other plant species waiting in the wings to take over their turf so that won't have much effect on the overall situation.  Some biomes are very strongly influenced by the large animals that live in them, we'll probably see forests spread as there are no larger herbivores keeping them trampled and trimmed in the prairies any more. Increasing oxygen levels could result in some impressive forest fires, Earth has had similar situations in the distant past.  A drop in CO2 will also make Earth colder overall, an ice age may ensue."

SpeculativeEvolution,2gcchv,Rauisuchian,3,Sun Sep 14 03:23:58 2014 UTC,"Some real organisms with interesting implications for this scenario:   The Diving Bell Spider can breathe underwater using air bubbles. Jaekelopterus, was a sea scorpion that grew to 2.5 meters, so large arthropods are definitely possible. While oxygen does put some limit on arthropod body size, it is not the only factor. Meganisoptera, giant prehistoric ""dragonflies"", survived to the end of the Permian, which had oxygen levels similar to today. Dragonfly larvae are effective carnivores that are capable of hunting small fish. Crustacean gills are more efficient than insect trachea."
SpeculativeEvolution,2gcchv,FrozenSeas,2,Sun Sep 14 03:31:19 2014 UTC,"Going from the past? I'd say trilobites stay as a major class, probably covering the niche of a number of modern crustaceans (bottom-dwelling omnivores), while crustaceans and Anomalocaridids expand into more predatory and free-swimming roles. Eurypterids probably show up in a similar capacity as sharks, splitting into active predators and passive filter-feeders.   From the future, things are a bit more complicated. The question there sorta becomes whether or not the terrestrial species start moving back to the water or not. In either case, I honestly don't know enough about arthropod biology to guess as to what happens. To my rather untrained eye, most crustaceans seem perfectly adapted for what they do, so I feel like diversification there would be slow. The other arthropods would be even more difficult, because as I understand it they'd be amphibious and not purely oceanic."

SpeculativeEvolution,2f5jlr,CowboyBoats,1 point,Mon Sep 1 12:03:24 2014 UTC,"It's extremely unlikely for such a creature to evolve. Flying animals can only be so large before they're unable to get airborne. Even if they're extremely large, their bones would most likely be hollow, which would be detrimental to combat on land and in the ocean. Large wings are unwieldy on land, especially if you're trying to move around quickly as hunting requires. There's a reason most animals are specialized to one or two of these environments. There's simply not enough evolutionary imperative to conquer land sea and sky, and specialization allows greater mastery of the environment."

SpeculativeEvolution,2e8hht,Rauisuchian,3,Fri Aug 22 01:08:49 2014 UTC,"Future Evolution by Peter Ward goes over this:   Between 500 and 1,000 million years from now there will still be clinging survivors of the Cambrian Explosion of 500 million years ago, the last twigs of the once vigorous tree of life. Let us imagine a stroll along the seashore in such a world. The sun is gigantic, the heat searing. The equatorial regions are already too hot for all but microbial life, and it is only in the cooler polar latitudes that we can see the ends of animal life on Earth.   Plant life is still present, but the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has shrunk to but a trace of its level during the first evolution of humanity. Only those plants evolved for life in this low-carbon-dioxide environment can be seen: low shrubbery with thick, waxy cuticles to withstand the searing heat and desiccation. There are no trees. Gone are the forests, grasslands, mangrove swamps, and meadows.   The oceans are in the process of evaporating away, and huge salt flats now stretch for untold miles along their shores. There is no longer animal life in the sea, save for crustaceans adapted to the very high salt content. The fish are gone, as are most mollusks and other animals without efficient kidney systems, such as echinoderms, brachiopods, cnidarians, tunicates, all the groups that were never good at dealing with changes in the saltiness of the sea, or at moving into fresh water. There is still land life, for animals can be seen along the shores, but they are low, squat, heavily armored creatures, and their armor is not for protection from predation, but for protection from the ever-present heat, salt, and drying.  Inland from the sea there is a different vision. Lichen, a few squat low plants. Other desultory animals, some of them arthropods, a few of them vertebrates. All the rest of the world is a desert, a place of heat and dying.  The birds are gone. So too are the amphibians. Whole classes, even phyla, are now disappearing from the Earth like players from a stage when the play is ending. There are still lizards, and snakes, and scorpions and cockroaches."

SpeculativeEvolution,2d3jd9,Kiloku,4,Sat Aug 9 21:22:47 2014 UTC,"Alright, fine you guys. I'll comment first (shame an interesting 7 hour old post has no comments). I'm not sure how several moons would affect tides and such, but I can really imagine what culture would be like for a certain group of semi-intelligent beings.  Let's say Earth had as many and similar diversity of moons as Jupiter does. History happens. Crops would be farmed only when the blue moon was out. When the red moon came out, it was time to take in the harvest. Like you said, we used to worship our one moon. Now imagine more than one! The ancient Greeks and Romans would say that each god lives on their own moon. If anyone did evil in their lives, they were sent to the moon of Hades and had to cross the sky and stars to get there. In the 60s JFK would promise that we would go to all our moons by the end of the next decade. The biggest (maybe brightest?) first. We'd collect rocks and study them here on Earth. We'd sit in the moonlights with our loved ones. We'd tell our kids stories about the men in the moons. And once in a blue red moon we'd get curious enough to go back. Then people start to colonize the moons. The only thing is, we don't colonize them as a whole united Earth. Countries become overzealous with their need for territory in space. I mean, where better than space to build an army? The U.S. starts the space race and claims a couple of moons as US territories. Russia doesn't fuck around so they head out too. The second space race. China joins in, and shit, Lil Kim comes to his senses and North Korea joins in. Soon all of our moons are colonized and claimed by different countries.  These are just my thoughts on it. Lots of moons would be awesome. Please someone else join in."
SpeculativeEvolution,2d3jd9,sikakanotna,3,Sun Aug 10 05:37:04 2014 UTC,"I think we could go further away from thinking in Earth terms (Greeks, Romans, U.S., etc., maybe even ignore ""humans"" and just think ""sentient species in an hypothetical planet"").  Anyway, I think the first moon to be targeted for landing would be either the closest one, or the one with the easiest to intercept orbit. Maybe there'd be more of a drive to colonize them, considering they'd be more important culturally and would offer a larger pool of resources."
SpeculativeEvolution,2d3jd9,Rauisuchian,2,Mon Aug 11 04:42:00 2014 UTC,"If one of the moons is big enough, or has a thick enough atmosphere, it might be suitable for life just like the main planet. If microorganisms evolve that can tolerate adverse conditions, like Archeans or tardigrades, then they might be transferred from planet to moon, or moon to planet, by asteroid and comet impacts. Maybe an Earthlike planet and a few of its moons could have life that shares a common ancestor."
SpeculativeEvolution,2d3jd9,Wabooti,3,Mon Aug 11 02:38:19 2014 UTC,"I didn't think about that, but makes sense and I love it. Maybe even have some sort of extremophile that lives in orbit between the moon and the planet, due to the many transfers."
