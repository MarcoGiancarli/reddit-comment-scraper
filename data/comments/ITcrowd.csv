ITcrowd,3dswg1,itsaride,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:46:06 2015 UTC,Full panorama of the office I can't see a purple squirrel.
ITcrowd,3dswg1,LoganPhyve,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:24:14 2015 UTC,"Weird that it doesn't appear in this pano. I've seen it before between the red door and break room door in the earlier seasons, I think.  See here:  http://www.toplessrobot.com/ep4-3-frank%20and%20eightball%20posters.jpg  Found it, it's ""Frank"" by Jim Woodring.  Further edit: Found the exact poster - Frank In Pond"

ITcrowd,3cboy0,LFClaird,3,Mon Jul 6 18:12:02 2015 UTC,I thought the bit at the end was a reference to Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.
