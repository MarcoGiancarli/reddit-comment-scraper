BABYMETAL,3e0w5u,DangerInTheHood,5,Tue Jul 21 06:44:43 2015 UTC,That was funny! Thanks.  I would LOVE to see 3 Sumo wrestlers dancing to Megitsune in some commercial or just them cosplaying the girls somehow. Many of their dance moves belong in the dohyo.

BABYMETAL,3e06pj,kinzokumetal,4,Mon Jul 20 23:08:07 2015 UTC,Hmm it seems like its better to just put one song from them. I wanna put Akatsuki but it feels like that song isn't as recognizable for any common people. I think Gimme Choco is a better choice. ROR will be mindblowing too.  Also I didn't play RB since RB2 so can someone tell me if any non english song make into RB3 including the DLC?
BABYMETAL,3e06pj,InC_Scratch,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the whole  DLC listing but Du Hast by Rammstein, Me Enamora by Juanes and Oye mi amor by Mana were in the main game."
BABYMETAL,3e06pj,inkybloaters,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:25 2015 UTC,Cool to hear. Kinda skeptical at first if Harmonix wanna put BM in the game since their songs is in Japanese.

BABYMETAL,3e06pj,DiegoAlonso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:58:34 2015 UTC,"I feel it would make more sense to put a more melodic song. Akatsuki, IDZ, and maybe RoR wouldn't be bad choices at all."

BABYMETAL,3e06pj,X_iDubstep_O,4,Tue Jul 21 00:16:55 2015 UTC,I can't wait to fail out to Road of Resistance!  Also I hope any song that doesn't make into the main game (likely all but one or possibly all of their songs) will make it as DLC!
BABYMETAL,3e06pj,DangerInTheHood,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:22 2015 UTC,I couldn't decide which one to pick so I just submitted all of their songs =]

BABYMETAL,3dyx26,Yarbaek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:39 2015 UTC,"Also funny to listen to DDM from the original video and then listen to it from these days, Su's vocal changed a lot"
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,kinzokumetal,3,Mon Jul 20 15:37:32 2015 UTC,It is only a temp one.  Her friend is working on a Moa one for her other arm but it wasn't ready for the Makuhari show.  I got some better close up photos of it at dinner after the concert but as chibistevo can confirm she's not typically keen on photos of herself being posted.
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,_gorthaur_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"This was my photo... I guess it got spread around further that I thought. I asked her permission and she seemed okay with it. Chibistevo said she wanted her face blurred, but she never mentioned that to me when I asked for her permission. :\  Now that it's making its rounds I kind of regret posting it (I only posted it on Newswire) because I know she's shy."
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,missingreel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:22 2015 UTC,:X  i meant to ask you if this was your photo because you guys did spend some time with her xD  Sadly in the internet things get spread fast! a google search bot will eventually find the picture xD
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,ReneColorado,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:38 2015 UTC,Don't feel bad or regret it.  I know you're her friend.    We were all there together after all.  :D  If you asked and she didn't mind that's cool.  I didn't ask her about the photos I took so I've only shared them with her.  I know she's quite shy like you mentioned.  I'm not sure if it's because of shyness or general privacy that she blurs her face in posted photos as chibistevo mentioned.  Even if you did ask her she's so quiet it would have been quite possible to misunderstand her.  Even one of the guys that was with us who is fully fluent in Japanese had trouble understanding her because of how quiet she talks sometimes.  It was a very cute temporary tattoo so you only wanted to share something cool.  It's all good.
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,_gorthaur_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:39 2015 UTC,Its a great photo. She's pretty - diminutive and elfish. I hope she loves the photo. Many of us do.
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,gerduhbear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:09:59 2015 UTC,It is only a suggestion but perhaps the honorable thing would be to respect her wishes and blur her face for future postings. It really is a nice tattoo.  The cat is out of the bag on this post. Maybe shutting down this thread would be one option to honoring her wishes.
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,14fore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"I just meant in general she seemed to ask people, so I assumed this was the same. I think she's smart enough to realize logically in this day and age, your face can't escape the net. I wouldn't feel bad about it. If she didn't say anything to you then there's not a lot to be sorry for."
BABYMETAL,3dyfjy,chibistevo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"She did request her face be blurred, so Im not sure why the taker put it on Twitter like this, but it's not your fault if you found it by searching."

BABYMETAL,3dychb,CaptainValence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:11 2015 UTC,"Hi, I haven't ordered one myself (they were sold out before I had the chance) but I can only imagine that what has caused the amount of yet undelivered issues is because of the sell-out.  I don't think they were prepared for this and as a consequence everything has went bananas so to speak. Then again, that is just my theory so don't go finding holes in it.  :) I hope you receive your copy soon."
BABYMETAL,3dychb,plumar,2,Mon Jul 20 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"I bought mine quite a while before they sold out, but that could be a reason. What confuses me the most is the fact that I was never sent a proper customer service number or whatever it's called.

The first time i tried to order i got an error message, i guess there was so much traffic. I did get charged but then later refunded. I then tried again a few hours later and order did get thru the second time. I got charged then i received that email that said this:  THANK YOU  Your Metal Hammer order has been successfully submitted.

Please bear in mind that it could be entirely out of their hands. The delivery company may be to blame; things do, rarely, go missing in the mail.   Another thing to note is that subscribers get their copies earlier than one-time purchasers. I'm not entirely sure how it works, but one-time online purchases may not get their copy until the release date, or it is sent off in the mail on the release date.  Just be happy you got a copy; I have to head down to WHSmith's first thing tomorrow to get mine :P"

BABYMETAL,3dychb,Moaiine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:03 2015 UTC,They sent an email when you order it saying they will send a second e-mail for when it has been sent so it is nothing to do with the delivery company

BABYMETAL,3dxvtq,inter080,8,Mon Jul 20 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"I attended Summer Sonic on 2013 and I got to see Babymetal, Maximum the Hormone, and some other bands perform. And I must say, it was totally worth it even if it was just for Babymetal.  First of all, you don't have to fight your way to get your ticket. The chance of obtaining a stand alone Babymetal ticket is getting worse every year but getting one for these giant music festivals are pretty easy.  Second, you will have a better chance of seeing them up close. At these music festivals, there are many people who just wants to surround themselves with music or just want to check out something new. If you want to get a front row, you may have to hug the front gate for couple hours but if you just want to get a decent view, just show up half an hour before their show begins and you should be fine.  And lastly, music festivals are always super fun. It will be hot as hell in Japan but you will discover lots of new music, you will see lots of delicious food stands, and you might make some new friends there.  One piece of advice if you are planning to attend; their merchandise will sell out FAST. When I saw them in 2013, I think all of their T-shirts were gone. So you'd better be there early if you want to pick up their gears.  So yes, it was totally worth it for me when I saw it in 2013. Ticket was easy to get and showed up 10-15 min before their show started and still managed to get to the front row. So if you have time and money, GO FOR IT!"

In the end, Rock on the Range was the highlight of my whole trip. Toronto and Chicago were amazing, but RotR was just something else.  My advice: see BABYMETAL every single chance you get."
BABYMETAL,3dxvtq,DaemonSD,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:48 2015 UTC,I will say one thing. Summer sonic is Bloody hot. If you go. Take a hat. Sit in the shade. Drink lots. Last few times i went i nearly collapsed. Japan that time of year outside is literal suicide. Stay safe and youwill have a blast!

Still, worth it. Especially if you consider how many other cool bands are going to attend to the Summer Sonic. The thing I regret most is that I was unable to see everyone perform."
BABYMETAL,3dxvtq,chibistevo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't waste my money just to come see them at a festival in Japan, but it depends how far you're traveling, the cost and other variable context. If you're planning a general Japan vacation, go for it. If you're just going for BM, there are better options."
BABYMETAL,3dxvtq,KitsuneDaO,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"True. We may need more information to give a real recommendation:  OP, when you say, ""go to Summer Sonic"", do you mean travel half-way around the world?

BABYMETAL,3dyc5r,Kitsunetsukii,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:30 2015 UTC,"Grammy and Billboard seem to have different ideas of what ""world music"" is.  For Grammy, ""world music"" means indigenous music.  You can see it from the list of the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album winners.  Babymetal is not in this category.  What's interesting about Grammy is that, they have 4 award categories in rock/metal music,   .  Best Rock Performance  Best Metal Performance  Best Rock Song  Best Rock Album  .  and only one of them is appropriate for metal bands.  Just only one.  It's interesting because R&B has 5 categories, hip hop has 4 categories, country music has 4, jazz has 5, EDM has 2, gospel/Christian music has 5, latin music has 5, American folk music has 6, classical music has 8, but heavy metal has only one category: Best Metal Performance.  Very tough competition :)"

His interviews are really interesting if you can read Japanese:  http://www.lifehacker.jp/2014/09/140914sadaharu_yagi.html  In the interview, he says one of his goals is to help produce a globally super-popular Japanese band.  As Babymetal are steadily becoming popular worldwide, I wonder what he thinks about Koba and his project."

The Special includes an Idol Fan, a J-Rock specialist and a BABYMETAL fan to discuss the BABYMETAL's phenomenon while they play some songs selected by the audience via Twitter.   Also the show includes a raw interview with the girls before the Show.  Since this is in spanish with my friend Daniel (who was the BABYMETAL fan in the program) did a summary and trascription of the interview.   If you don't want to listen the full program, i also edited the audio to let you guys listen only the Interview.   Very interesting stuff about Kirk Hammet and Cannibal Corpse.

And i Finally bought a few frames for some posters i got  As mentioned before, the only way to get the previously released Tower Record's posters is from auction sites such as Yahoo Japan, and for overseas buyers we must use a third party company such as Buyee or ZenMarket. They do go for a high price (some of them). I got several BM Tower Record's posters for less than 4,000yen and the most expensive was 9,000 yen.

The MH staff should  all be sent to Tokyo to cover the next big BM gig at Yokohama. As soon as they saw the feeding frenzy that is a BM gig merch queue they would understand why this issue is going to outsell all its predecessors. I think the interaction between magazine a fans is brilliant. Even though I suspect a few heads are melting somewhere

And that will draw in new fans, some of whom will end up in sub-genres far from kawaii-metal. Right now Babymetal seems like the spearhead rock needs, to recapture the mainstream from the dominant EDM genres.

But turns out, she isn't. She's a cydol (cyborg idol) who feeds merely on tomatoes and the increased heart rates of fans she throws her kawaii poses at. Since they are always so busy it's hard for her to maintain a proper level of tomato-energy, even with the suitcase full of tomatoes with them. So especially during interviews she sometimes has to go into rest mode and boots down a bit.     (can I request this to get turned into a comic just like the skateboard + suitcase story? xD)"

They will either have to keep the girls out of sight or let them be more approachable. I can guess which option they will choose. :(

BABYMETAL,3dtphb,jamiejamez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Mr. Malone uses iMovie which (I assume) does not have a subtitle feature. Instead, he uses the Title Text feature, which is obviously supposed to be used for creating titles. Hence the text are often too big and the fade in/out effect cannot be turned off.  I've mentioned to him about it before (text too big), but it doesn't look like he really cares about how he does it and I'm not the one to pass judgement on fan services like making subs. *shrug"

BABYMETAL,3dtphb,bebii-metaru-desu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:02:02 2015 UTC,It's amazing how Japan (generally) tends to ignore idol groups whose producers treat them as human beings and artists rather than only eye candy.  (You'd need to have some REALLY big horseblinds on to miss your artists hitting that high on the Billboard World Album charts.)
BABYMETAL,3dtphb,GESOMETAL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:33:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Japan is one of the worlds biggest music markets. Keeping up with everything is impossible.

BABYMETAL,3dtphb,jabberwokk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's a typical / annoying / useful technique. If you watch major Western sports, you see it all the time -- of course the person doing the interview knows about the subject, has probably walked through some of the session already; they may keep up with each other outside of ""work"" even, or be part of the same social circle. With that level of information intimacy, you have no choice when doing a segment but to pretend like you know nothing or at the very least convincingly act as if the question has weight even though you know the answer."

I'm waiting for Koba to start finally seeing a true artist in Su, and a true authenticity in her :D  When Su, Yui, and Moa find their true authenticity, find what they really want to do and find what they really want to sing on stage, that’s when they will be ready to break into the top 50 of Billboard 200, top 30 of the UK chart, the German chart, and many other charts all over the world :)"
BABYMETAL,3dtphb,volkyri,2,Sun Jul 19 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"Well, general Japanese people do care nothing of idol groups, rather any bands.  I don't think people know a bit about how X Japan, One OK Rock, Crossfaith or any other bands are doing well on western music scene, but because of its Idol group nature, BABYMETAL is getting much more exposure and spotlight on their activities.  Also In Japan, no one cares Billboard chart, but even so, if BABYMETAL hit top 10 on main chart with upcoming releases, it will give a huge impact I believe."
BABYMETAL,3dtphb,Jedrus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:31:37 2015 UTC,"Also In Japan, no one cares Billboard chart     Right, I think it's all about Oricon there? The domestic market.

In case you grabbed the TV version, you can go with the Makuhari Messe SSA 2015 (January) concert too but sound isn't as good.    As for the other options you have, Budokan looks good of course, but for my taste there was too much going wrong (and risky performances that somehow went okay). If you still feel like going with Budokan, make sure you choose Black Night. As for Forum vs. O2 it's hard to choose because both are really good. O2 sound was too clean for my taste, it was almost like studio audio because you couldn't really hear fans or the little explosion in the beginning. But it had Takayoshi & Yuya as well as a bigger stage and RoR. Forum on the other hand had Mikio (clean and effortless playing never fail to amaze), better sound and the girls with incredibly happy faces."

But since the latter features babybones mostly it seems like not the best idea for new (western) fans.    Thanks to the power of the Internet you should be able to find a Blu-ray rip for MM 2014.

I think O2 sounds the most like a live performance. The chorus to DDM, for example, sounds like it's almost all bass (at least on my system) and much rawer than a studio recording.   And as for being able to hear the fans, one of the best parts is at the beginning of BABYMETAL DEATH when the crowd cheers as the girls first appear on stage. I can't think of any comparable recording that captures this kind of audience excitement. Gives me goosebumps everytime. And I was there. I know how awesome that moment was :)"

I'm still leaning towards the Forum show for an introduction though...the fact that it's a London crowd showcases how big the band is on the international stage, and the English crowd interactions are fun.  And it feels more intimate than the big arena shows."

The other thing is a video I recorded of the girls stretching in casual clothes in italy, I thought it was really amazing and cool to see that kind of ""behind the scene stuff"" because they were just preparing themselves for the show but a lot of people said it was really bad and that I entered their privacy... and things like that, so I don't want to show this video anymore, but I guess in some years it will not be a big deal anymore hopefuly :/"

BABYMETAL,3dpzho,perkited,2,Sat Jul 18 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, BABYMETAL, Obviously I still love them and my fandom won't stop, but for me the Kami Band is one of the main reasons I look forward to their concerts, and the fact that my favorite member were to leave, it makes me lose my interest.   I was in shock when LEDA left but I guess it didn't had a big impact because Mikio took his place, but for Ohmura is a different history, I doubt that there is someone with the skills and charisma that could fill the emptiness."
BABYMETAL,3dpzho,xIAlexanderIx,5,Sat Jul 18 19:00:05 2015 UTC,After watching a few of his YT videos. He's a more diverse guitarist (like Mikio) and has a pretty interesting technique (especially the bass style slapping). I could see him fitting well in a heavier Frank Zappa band (I feel a little Steve Vai vibe from him sometimes as well).

It's possible he has conflicts this fall.   But this is also the same guy who payed two gigs with two different bands on the same day at Loud Park '13.

BABYMETAL,3dpzho,DaemonSD,2,Sat Jul 18 13:32:45 2015 UTC,I just stumbled across Ohmura's schedule through December although it's probably been posted forever. The only conflict I see is Yokohama on 12/12.

BABYMETAL,3dpzho,iwabo-fukei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"High probability because? All ISAO does is meet up with a guitar teacher. Is there even any reason to change the lineup right now? I don't think there are any scheduling conflicts at the moment (but we would be last to know about that of course), plus there is always the guitarist who was with them for some US shows. I'm not saying ISAO will never be a kami-band member, and surely he is quite high up on the list of ""replacement"" guitarists, but jumping to conclusions simply because he meets up with Mikio is a bit far-fetched. The Japanese guitar scene is crazy, everyone is in like a hundred bands at the same time and almost everyone knows each other hahaha    What I do find interesting is that he is an 8-string guitarist. While I think Mikio owns an 8-string too, it would surely be interesting to hear them go down to F# or even lower in BABYMETAL songs."
BABYMETAL,3dpzho,iwabo-fukei,3,Sat Jul 18 09:37:43 2015 UTC,"The very strong evidence is the 2nd tweet I linked. He says ""I'm changing into KAMI-mode little by little from tonight."""

About this image, though: I thought that the top of a skateboard would be the surface that you would ride on. And having the suitcase attached to the skateboard suggests a very large skateboard (one of those long boards that are used for downhill racing?) or a very small suitcase.   Maybe they meant to say that she was riding a skateboard but well back on it (using her superior sense of balance) and that she was holding on to her suitcase very tightly. Adding a comma, as follows, would result in this interpretation:  ""Yuimetal will fly out of the dressing room on the back of a skateboard, attached to her suitcase.""  No big deal - thank you MH for all the wonderful work you have done."
BABYMETAL,3dp7et,Vinyalonde,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:15 2015 UTC,No comma. That was taken straight from the text. Monsterpanda sent a link on this thread on how it might look like. I was thinking the same thing.

BABYMETAL,3dph26,des-metal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:17:57 2015 UTC,And the wings seem to originate from Karen Girl's My Wings. It was from Su's former group so it kind of make sense.
BABYMETAL,3dph26,JalmarY,3,Sat Jul 18 05:39:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. -- More history details:  Su-chan had a sunflower-based design with a smiling face (inspired by her sunny/happy disposition, a.k.a. Happy-Su persona) and also a musical note to represent her passion for singing (plus a tiny heart). That did not fit well with the BABYMETAL logo. A preliminary version of the BABYMETAL logo (shown in the scoopers BM interview video), featured instead the lightening bolt she often use in her signature instead. A remnant of the lightening bolt shape can still be seen in the sides of the name part of the logo.  But the wings seems to be inspired from the Karen Girl's ""My Wings"" video as you say; At least no one has offered a better match/explanation AFAIK. Additionally Su has appeared in commercials with angel wings, and corresponding behind-the-scenes videos. The wings probably have some additional symbolic meaning as well (maybe shared with the ""My Wings"" song or maybe not) since an awful lot of BM stuff has more-or-less hidden meanings and references.  There are earlier threads here like this one from some time back that discuss this more.  Edit: detailed Su design description more + Added links to previous thread and My Wings GIF."
BABYMETAL,3dph26,Greybeard_21,3,Sat Jul 18 13:32:10 2015 UTC,I liked the theory that the wings represented Su-metals ears...
BABYMETAL,3dph26,AsABoxer,2,Sat Jul 18 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"Now consider the end of ""Legend D"". Su is set to graduate in 3 months and, as far as anyone knows, this is one of her last performances with BABYMETAL. Su's symbol is wings, and she sings ""Tsubasa wo Kudasai"" which goes    If I can get one wish To come true right now, I want a pair of wings Please grant me white wings On my back like a bird     Before laying down her microphone and symbolically sacrificing herself. No wonder Yui and Moa cried."
BABYMETAL,3dph26,MightyLongFall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:09 2015 UTC,I wonder if the guy in the white shirt dancing his heart out is doing the same at every BM concert..
BABYMETAL,3dph26,andy1295,5,Sat Jul 18 07:43:51 2015 UTC,I met a guy in Zurich that knows white shirt guy and was at this concert and he said that he still goes to shows i think. But White shirt guy wasn't in Europe for them shows. We were both very happy to be directly in front of Moa's podium at the Zurich show and got a intense stare from Su metal as well as the usual deadly smiles from Yui and Moa haha :D

BABYMETAL,3dp5ys,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"The eye placement on the HT shirt still bugs me.   My gut still tells me they worked something out due to it not being exact design and the previous history of vendor scapegoating at HT, rather then a direct license.   There are other connections with vendors and BM, when you start tracing the lines make sense… but I really hope BM is getting a cut. I seen this JPN/US tense business practice relations and been in the middle before… and what I am seeing on my peripheral vision is making me a bit nervous."
BABYMETAL,3dp5ys,monsterpanda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"It's official. The only reason I purchased two of these, (one for me, and one for my son) was because it was authorized and plugged by BABYMETAL from their Official FB page. No reason to have doubts due to HT past track record, when BABYMETAL approved, collaborated, and linked the product. Also, it is the exact design. Not sure what difference you're seeing from it aside from the splotches on the background."
BABYMETAL,3dp5ys,MoonDevyl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"Look at the position of the eye. There are other parts like logo size to skull… but the eyes are the give away.  The original is a gachya eye (cross eyed) the HT shirt is more western with the pupil centered in the socket instead of towards the center.   … I know it is official and endorsed by BM. Never said it wasn't, but something about this deal just does not feel right…  I played this game before with US/JPN vendor relation and business dealings. The timing and the way it played out in the community was reactive. Connect the dot's and I see patterns I exp before, which also makes the Funko shirt rumor that much more interesting to watch as a bystander. But hey, it's business… I don't need to like it, just weary like with any business transactions."

And you're doing Fox God's work in promoting Babymetal to the metal masses. For this alone you have my eternal thanks.  I fondly remember buying the first local Metal Hammer issue in my country back in 1990. Sadly this and the first few year's issues got lost due to circumstances. But I remember the whole cover was a picture of Eddie smashing stuff with, guess what, a huge metal hammer.  This was years before Japanese music found a permanent spot in my life, and I would have never thought that 25 years later the cover would be graced by 3 amazing Japanese performers. What a time to live in.  Anyway - keep up the good work. And please give some love to the Kami Band behind Babymetal, they are equally amazing and deserve as much credit. Same goes to their mastermind Koba-metal - I'm sure with your contacts in the industry you could arrange an interview with him."

If Babymetal had appeared 10 years ago, I would have been one of those people bashing them for ruining metal.""   It's not metal as we know it (knew it?), but it is metal-ish.  25 years ago (rather than 10 years),  when I was listening to a lot of music, I would have been quick to bash them.  And then probably just as quick to recognize the awesomeness, and fall in love.  BABYMETAL is BABYMETAL.  Just like Willie Nelson is Willie Nelson, or Aretha Franklin is Aretha Franklin, or Silent Siren is Silent Siren (see what I did there).  Point is, it's talented people doing their thing and you either like it or or you don't.  A label is not necessary.  Enjoy the things that make you feel good, and let other people to do the same.

YUIMETAL really loves Karen Girl's, so being able to dance Karen Girl's song on stage was like a dream! For YUIMETAL it's the best memory (DEATH :p)  Q3: Tell us about BABYMETAL's trademark pose ""Fox sign""  [MOA] actually that pose was born from a misunderstanding from BABYMETAL! We were told ""Try and do this pose"" and shown the horns sign but, we didn't know anything about metal (even now I [we?] don't really know [laughs] ) so after saying together ""it's Kitsune san!"" it was decided because of that [laughs] I wish many people will do the Fox Sign for us  Q4: tell us about BABYMETAL costumes  [SU] A cool and cute costume in red and black DEATH! The current costume for Megitsune is based on a cool Japanese style black kimono and a cute red sash  Q5: Last year you also did lives abroad. What was the reaction from foreign fans?  [YUI] I was able to meet foreign fans I couldn't meet up to now, so I was really happy! We did a live in Singapore, but it wasn't just people living in Singapore, I was surprised  people came for us from Hong Kong, Malaysia... People who had learned Japanese and said things like ""Ganbatte!"" or ""Arigatou!"" left an impression on me"

Q8: from now on, what's the challenge you'll try to accomplish as BABYMETAL?  [MOA] as regards MOAMETAL's personal objective... I would like to make a BABYMETAL anime!

Then back to how you see it now.    It's possible the available quantity is small, from cancellations, or from the rounding up of pre-orders to the nearest 100 or 1000, or they have more time to increase the run than their intentionally conservative deadline."
BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,hanspree13,12,Thu Jul 16 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"What does ""キツネ様のみぞ知る"" mean?    Only The FOX GOD Knows!!    I'm sorry that I wasn't witty, Jabberwokk ;-)  originally: FYI, ""キツネ様のみぞ知る"" means ""Only The FOX GOD Knows""."
BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,okapon,5,Thu Jul 16 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"Quit teasing, what does ""キツネ様のみぞ知る"" mean?!?!  I'm tired of these OTFGK answers to questions!   On a less serious note, is there any significance to using キツネ instead of the 狐 which was used for the super-premium SSA t-shirt?"
BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,jabberwokk,2,Thu Jul 16 21:33:57 2015 UTC,Probably because the official lyrics tend to use キツネ whenever the word shows up. (Although I'm wondering why they used 様 instead of 神)
BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,kinzokumetal,3,Thu Jul 16 22:12:24 2015 UTC,"They always use キツネ様, not キツネ神 in Japanese. You usually use '様' when the person is at a higher position than you. So why a fox - an animal should be called with '様'? It implies the fox is not just an animal but a higher power.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics#Sama"
BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,okapon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, the best choice is キツネ様, not キツネ神.  The reason is that when Japanese people refer to the God they revere from their hearts, they say, ""神様,"" not ""神.""  They refer to a god in general as ""神,"" but adding the word ""様"" emphasizes their awe, reverence, trust, and love toward the god.  The word ""キツネ様"" means that people have these feelings of awe, reverence, trust, and love toward this particular fox.  This is traditional Japan.  In traditional Japanese culture, the God is considered to reside in everything in this world.  This idea comes from the religion of Shinto (or Shintoism).  So, here, this particular fox is treated as a godlike figure, and people worship and love this fox. .  In fact, I am not confident if the Fox God is the best translation of ""キツネ様.""  The best translation of ""キツネ様"" might be something like ""the revered old fox."""
BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,bebii-metaru-desu,2,Fri Jul 17 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"okapon is not joking and already gave the correct translation.    I see people using キツネ in written form more often, but don't know why too."
BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,Redeared_Slider,4,Fri Jul 17 00:42:45 2015 UTC,"There are two reasons.  One reason is a stylistic choice.  There is a difference in how to express words in Japanese between the ""light entertainment"" community and the more classic entertainment community.  By ""light entertainment,"" I mean anime, manga, light novels (just google search if you've never heard of this word).  By ""more classic"" entertainment, I mean traditional literature, such as mainstream novels, poems, etc.  In traditional literature, you would generally choose a Chinese character whenever it is available.  If you know a lot of difficult Chinese characters, use them as much as you can in writing traditional-style novels!  In ""light entertainment"" such as anime, manga, and light novels, it is stylistically often considered cool to use Katakara instead of Chinese characters.  Amuse and Koba want to add to Babymetal's kamishibai a feel of anime and manga, a feel of pop culture.  So, they use キツネ.  Instead, if they wanted to add to their kamishibai a feel of old-time Japan, or a feel of classic literature, then the word 狐 would be their stylistic choice.  You can think of this as a stylistic difference between the anime/manga contemporary pop culture and the traditional culture of literature.  .  There is actually another reason, though.  The other reason is that, recently, it has become somewhat popular to use Katakana to refer to animals, instead of Chinese characters.  For example, Japanese people these days might opt for using ""サル"" instead of ""猿"" to refer to monkeys, they might opt for using ""クジラ"" instead of ""鯨"" to refer to whales, and so on.  This a general trend for the last couple of decades.  Wikepedia might be helping this trend because Wikipedia uses Katakana at the top of each animal's description page."

BABYMETAL,3dj7yy,jabberwokk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"狐 often mean animal, not the Fox God, while キツネ feels more of unreal entity and gives less impression of the animal for us Japanese, I guess. Katakana like キツネ have been used for imported foerign words or new concepts."

I've been to see bands where screaming teenage girls sit next to elderly people and they both have just as much fun, but Babymetal seems to push into so many different overall fanbases. They have a massive following from both J-Pop and Metal crowds, so it's really everything from young girls with lots of girly things to burly biker men with amazing beards, and everything in between.  Most of the people I know who like em (very few outside of the subs) are all in their 20s, and usually on some level anime fans and thus fans of a few anime related songs. I get judged a lot by tonnes of people like my co workers, and even some of my closest friends, and I just have to ignore them. Can't help what you like, and Babymetal (and Sakura Gakuin) is literally the perfect kind of music for me. The kind I've waited my whole life to hear."

BABYMETAL,3dir9h,MM305,3,Fri Jul 17 01:17:22 2015 UTC,These should help: 1 2 3 4  Leave it to the band with 3 adorable teenage girls to have more male fans in  than:   One Ok Rock  X Japan  and freaking Dir En Grey
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,Mindflizzle,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"Ugh, as a long time Diru fan, it's the goddamned fangirls that are the worst. Jesus Christ, all that banshee wailing. They ruin all the shows."

BABYMETAL,3dir9h,InC_Scratch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:08 2015 UTC,Here's one more: fan interviews from their US debut https://vimeo.com/102575286
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,polfus_spark,2,Thu Jul 16 19:56:44 2015 UTC,"Its fairly spread out. While it will be mostly guys who is metalhead/music fan, some girls are into BM as well.  I also remember certain thread on one of BM show that the age range is between something like kids to grandparents age which is around 60 plus."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,Dalrath,2,Thu Jul 16 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"In recommending your peers to BM, ii they are bit sceptic tell them to check out the youtube since the count is closing in on 30,000,000. That how I got the recommend,before from the man that books them for Europe. Crowds in London last where all types old and young (mainly young bucks). In Zurich the crowd was definitely young,although after Reading and Leeds festival I reckon Maiden to Metallica true fans will welcome this as metal is getting on now 40 plus years and they don't want to see Metal archived just yet."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,rezarNe,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:25 2015 UTC,"I've not poked my head into what's going on in metal in 7+ years, but is the worry about metal falling away a real one? I was on some metal news site today (first time in years, looking for BM info, obvs), and there was some article about the old guard needing to hand over the reigns. Is that a general worry these days?"
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,dick_stalls,7,Thu Jul 16 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is Metal got stuck in a groove. There are a lot of new metal bands out there, but it all started to sound the same in some way, much to the delight of eliteists.   But along come's BM and started to smash away at the groove with a Hello-Kitty sledgehammer.  I was at Sonisphere last year, and at the time I was thinking who they could get to headline next year (2015) as almost all the big metal bands had played that year, ex Slipknott. And with Download trying to get the same bands it really becomes a very small pool for top bands. Yes there are a lot of smaller bands, but they sound like a mix of what's gone before."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,Dalrath,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"Same, to me metal hasn't been too interesting in this century at all, the whole metal-core thing is boring as hell (although BM is somewhat metal-core inspired they at least do it right), but I think there is a reason that many old thrash groups have now reformed and there is a new-Thrash movement.  While it might not be your style I recommend checking out Band Maid and Mutant Monster (punk) if you want to get into more Japanese music, also check out the Kawaii Metal sub"
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,perkited,2,Fri Jul 17 04:11:22 2015 UTC,The fans are still mainly Japanese but us foreign fans are growing every day. In terms of an age range; It's crusty old dudes and tween girls and everything in between. I don't know the break down between metal fans and J-pop fans but there is a good mix
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,Captain_Username,2,Thu Jul 16 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think that there is a general demographic for BM. The age range is wide, I'm 53 and I know I'm not the oldest by a long way. I met a couple who had taken there 7 year old to the gig in France this year for her birthday present. The musical tastes of people is also as wide, from heavy metal to pop fans.  Just recomend them to any one, then take them to a concert and they'll be hooked."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,perkited,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:43 2015 UTC,The Japanese Idol community in the west tends to be more young female and of course the metalheads are mostly male (8 to 80). That's definitely the mix you're seeing in BABYMETAL fans.
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,rezarNe,2,Thu Jul 16 18:30:01 2015 UTC,The Japanese Idol community in the west tends to be more young female   Uhhh what
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,KitsuneDaO,2,Thu Jul 16 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"My use of ""more young female"" was probably not the right way to word it, I don't know if they're an outright majority. I remember some forum surveys done a while back (I believe on the Hello! Online forum) and it was about a 50/50 male/female split, I'll have to see if I can track it down. The reason I think it's mostly younger females is that you don't see very many 40+ female Japanese idol fans in the west, but there are quite a few 40+ males so that would make younger females the most populous (if broken down by age and gender).  There aren't official numbers anywhere and I'm sure different idol communities have different user breakdowns, but I do get that feel."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,billm99uk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"I think they like different kinds of J-Pop which isn't really a genre in itself, the girls seem to fall in different categories the anime groups (like say Iris), rock bands (like Scandal) and dance music (like Perfume) whereas the male audience tend to favor the traditional J-Pop stuff (like the numbers groups).  At least that my perception."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,WireOne52,2,Fri Jul 17 04:20:48 2015 UTC,It's an incredibly diverse fan base. From metalheads to idol otaku and everything in between. Here's the line of fans that showed up for the Toronto show.
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,StarKobra,2,Thu Jul 16 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"I remember standing in the queue at Brixton in the rain trying to work out what ""the Babymetal demographic"" was.  I really couldn't do it. Old metalheads, cosplay girls, general rock kids, dating couples, anime geeks. You name it, it was there. All you can say is that seem to have a very broad appeal. Anyway, it's safe to say you're never going to look out of place at a BM gig."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,amadiGW2,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"I attended the Chicago House of Blues Concert. There were a lot of hard core Metal fans. The fans I spoke with during the day (waiting in line), were very knowledgeable about music in general. There was a small group of fans from Japan. They came to America to see BM at a small venue. They sellout 20,000 seat areas in Japan.  I did an informal survey of 26 BABYMETAL fans one time. Many of them were also fans of Metallica . Check out the Legend D and Z BABYMETAL concerts if you can. Some of those concerts are on YouTube. You can also purchase the DVD."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,amadiGW2,2,Thu Jul 16 22:10:14 2015 UTC,"It seems to be mostly middle aged men, like pretty much every Japanese group with young females."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,TheThrawn,3,Fri Jul 17 05:22:04 2015 UTC,I think this'll give you the general idea

BABYMETAL,3dir9h,wasneeplus89,3,Thu Jul 16 17:22:01 2015 UTC,This might help you.
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,aokimasaru,3,Thu Jul 16 17:22:01 2015 UTC,Maybe someone should do a new poll sometime. It's been a while since that one.
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,RBS-METAL,2,Thu Jul 16 17:30:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I think we had less than 2000 subscribers at the time.
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,BLAKEPHOENIX,2,Thu Jul 16 17:33:21 2015 UTC,A little over 1500 if I remember correctly.
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,Deadmansplat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"Babymetal's fan base consists of girls as young as 5 years old, teens, young adults and grown men and women."

Although, my metal head friends give the band grudging respect and my friends in the music industry have gotten the bug once I forced it on them at parties (Chokotto Love and the Headbanger remix from Legend 1997 seem to be favorites). I do have to admit outside of the LA concert I've never met another true Kitsune IRL. Once the album has released its hold on you, I'd suggest the Legend 1997 and Legend 1999 shows as the next step, lots of awesome stuff not on the album."

BABYMETAL,3dir9h,rockadilla1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:39:21 2015 UTC,"I am an early 40s white male, but met people from 18 to late 50s and Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, etc. at the NY concert. As for who to recommend it to, I have mentioned it to almost everyone I work with, and yes some have jokingly called me a pedo for liking it, but I got them back by showing them another J-Pop Idol group I found and liked around the same time. Warning: prepare yourself if you have heart issues these girls can give you a scare.  If your peers like metal, get the ""air vocal"" versions of the songs from the singles, if you can.  I have introduced two people to them that way, they liked the music but had a harder time liking the vocals.  At least one of them ended up buying the album after two or three weeks.  If your peers like dance music have them listen to iine. If they like a wide variety, show them the official youtube page.  And, if they like odd things"
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,rezarNe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:53:37 2015 UTC,Wow... u r the first... lol.. ladybeard is a fan of BABYMETAL
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,rockadilla1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a 23 year old male and when I saw babymetal I was kinda disappointed in the crowd, not to say that their fan base is all the same, especially on reddit and stuff the demographic is probably a bit different, but when i saw them live, most of their fans seemed old... like in their 30s/40s which may partly be the $100 ticket prices younger people cant afford. But because 75% of the people there were close to twice my age made me feel a bit awkward, I saw around 4-5 others around the same age, and like 10-15 kids <14 that were probably dragged there by their parents."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,rezarNe,2,Thu Jul 16 23:48:09 2015 UTC,I'm 48. You're gonna find calling people my age old pretty silly in a few years. :)
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,Dead_Poets,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"Haha I don't doubt it, but I already consider myself old.  Time flies, I don't feel like I should be my age already."
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,aleste2,2,Fri Jul 17 06:29:20 2015 UTC,If you think 30 year olds are old I would say you seem pretty immature for a 23 year old.
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,rockadilla1,0,Fri Jul 17 04:23:05 2015 UTC,"Based on who I consider ""old"" you think I'm immature? lol"
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,aleste2,2,Fri Jul 17 06:31:27 2015 UTC,I believe that was what I said!
BABYMETAL,3dir9h,Ghost_t,3,Fri Jul 17 07:44:09 2015 UTC,And I will second it.
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,44444444four,16,Thu Jul 16 10:56:40 2015 UTC,"https://twitter.com/hanitaro0813jp/status/621558122604146688/photo/1     translation of Interview article of Herman Li,    ...half so far XD       At first, Metal Hammer offered BABYMETAL to play at Golden Gods, which was so sudden request that BM couldn't afford to arrange Kami Band.     We happened to be in London to prepare for Download Festival.  Then when asked to perform together, we accepted the original offer to play only Gimme chocolate at Golden Gods.     But I said because we made Road of Resistance with the BM project, I felt good if we played ROR together with BM on stage for the first time, convinced to bring something special to our and BM's fans. Most of all, Sam and I joined all the guitar parts of ROR.     It was concluded to invite BM as a guest of Download Festival to play only one song with us WITHOUT any rehearsal, and finally played Gimme chocolate.     Acually we were scared because it was the first time to performe with BM ever, moreover there were no rehearsals.     On the other hand, we and BM rehearsed all the day for Golden Gods. ** **We and the BM project worked out the details; when and how for BM girls to dance, which guitar part to go front at the stage and to play solo. That show was huge success.     In England the show was broadcasted on TV, so I hope the other fans of DragonForce and BM watched it.     Before the lives, we made a lot of arrangements with BM staff by both meeting directly and e-mail. It was very comfortable to work with the BM project.     The responses of fans at the both shows were not so different from ours, and we felt good response.  I think BM suited our audience taste at the shows.  I won't dare to say BMs have similar music tendency to us, but we both share many musical elements in common.  I like BM album and listen frequently.  The album ‘BABYMETAL’ is the one of my favorite albums in 2014.     Before the beginning of stage at Download, all of us felt very nervous, because BM members had never danced to our play.  Anyway everything went well in the end.  We tried to synchronize our play to the dance of BM girls with communication and interaction with the girls, exhibiting a feeling of unity between us and girls."
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,zetka,3,Thu Jul 16 11:01:20 2015 UTC,I didn't think it's been broadcasted yet?
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,Captain_Username,2,Thu Jul 16 11:40:39 2015 UTC,AFAIK it hasn't been on

BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,maikgianino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:01:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for the translation. Really interesting read.
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,BM4ever,3,Thu Jul 16 16:30:09 2015 UTC,Going onstage in front of thousands with no rehearsal...wow...
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,kinzokumetal,7,Thu Jul 16 14:58:39 2015 UTC,That...is METAL.
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,IfTheseTreesCouldTal,2,Thu Jul 16 15:31:11 2015 UTC,That's incredible! I guess they have faith in their skill and practice. Mad respect.
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,Sabaneko,3,Thu Jul 16 16:02:54 2015 UTC,"At first, Metal Hammer offered BABYMETAL to play at Golden Gods, which was so sudden request that BM couldn't afford to arrange perform with Kami Band.   Very interesting. Later part of the interview is also interesting, good to know. Thanks for this and the tweet."
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,robjapan,3,Thu Jul 16 12:01:16 2015 UTC,"I think the trouble with arranging everyone's schedule at such short notice would be impossible, all of the Kami Band are very busy guys doing other stuff."
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,Sabaneko,4,Thu Jul 16 12:22:40 2015 UTC,"Troubles come, and as the consequence, we had DragonForce and Babymetal on the same stage of Download. How exciting!"
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,robjapan,3,Thu Jul 16 12:49:48 2015 UTC,It WAS amazing :D
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,maikgianino,2,Thu Jul 16 12:51:53 2015 UTC,"I was told by someone from the band that they actually rehearsed a couple of times before Download. Anyway, i don't care if they did it or not, was a risky business playing at Download with a couple of days of rehearsals of without any rehearsal. I'm glad that actually DF community received very well the live collaborations."
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,ginger_metal,4,Thu Jul 16 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Could mean that they rehearsed playing the song (which they'd have to, obviously), but they didn't manage to do a rehearsal together with the girls..."
BABYMETAL,3dhq3r,maikgianino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"True, also i remember Herman said that they did a live rehearsal ""dressed"" at Download. That comment received thousands of funny comments on their Fan Page xD"
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,Azza-T,15,Thu Jul 16 12:41:06 2015 UTC,"Better than I expected. The mask doesn't require me to cut it out myself so I'm relatively happy. But come on, even without the mask, that front cover is worth the price of the mag alone. MH put proper effort and thought into that cover so I'm impressed."
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,BM4ever,6,Thu Jul 16 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, anyone who was expecting anything more than this wasn't thinking sensibly. Of course they weren't gonna include a 3D plastic mask that would likely get flattened in the post."
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,MakesYuSmile,5,Thu Jul 16 15:13:36 2015 UTC,+1  I expected just like this.
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,ainky,7,Thu Jul 16 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"Totally expected this, however thought i'd show you guys who may still want to know more about it. Still buying it though! \m/  Source: yotty-metal (Instagram)"
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,jabberwokk,3,Thu Jul 16 12:44:18 2015 UTC,"What I expected, too, though it could have been an insert using heavier card stock, like some ads are. If the chin of the mask is cut off like that, though, that is bad. Probably that's the Instagram photo itself cropped.   I'm not sure what I'm seeing with the eye holes, though, something is strange there."
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,ShadeSlayr,2,Thu Jul 16 12:55:56 2015 UTC,What you see in the circles for eyes is the page underneath.

BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,jabberwokk,3,Thu Jul 16 14:16:08 2015 UTC,Only sold out for single issue pre-order direct from Metal Hammer:  https://subscribe.teamrock.com/metal-hammer/issue-273    Reportedly it will be on newsstands in the UK on Tuesday.
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,SuckMyAshleigh,2,Thu Jul 16 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah it'll definitely be in UK stores, just online stock has sold out."
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,faygo5000,9,Thu Jul 16 14:20:26 2015 UTC,I expected as much. I'm still glad I got a copy. I would have ordered it even without any extras. That cover alone is worth the costs.
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,RemyRatio,4,Thu Jul 16 12:52:12 2015 UTC,That's pretty much what I've expected. Btw are they already shipped?
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,bouketenvoorde,2,Thu Jul 16 12:59:49 2015 UTC,I think mine arrived as well... not sure.. Have to go to the postoffice tomorrow.
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,plumar,5,Thu Jul 16 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"It was obvious, I mean Asmart sold the mask only to THE ONE members for 2000yen, you cannot expect a similar mask in the magazine. The cover, the poster(s) and the article were my reasons to buy it."
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,InC_Scratch,4,Thu Jul 16 15:53:20 2015 UTC,I know the moment I saw the mag price it will be something like this. My reason of buying this is just the cover and the article. Besides MH has been supporting BM so I thought they should deserve some money at least from me.
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,ReneColorado,5,Thu Jul 16 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what i expected xD i have purchase magazines with these kind of cool extras and they are not bad, they are great to collect :D i already have a frame to put this on :P glad i order 2 of them before they ran out :P :P"

BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,jabberwokk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"You mean the fire logo on the forehead of the mask? That replicates the real plastic mask which they debuted at SSA, no longer available at Asmart. Before they came out with their custom one, they sold a generic kitsune mask (common in Japan) which itself wasn't directly connected to Babymetal and which could also be found elsewhere.      If you mean the page itself in Metal Hammer, it's a page in Metal Hammer, not Babymetal merch, so it's natural for them to identify what's on the page for all their readers."
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,Kitsune_Gakuin,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:16 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I was lucky enough to meet up with a guy (sorry, I suck at remembering names) in line at the Toronto show who had about 15 or 20 he was selling that he'd brought back from Japan. They're not the BABYMETAL ones, but I don't even mind. It still looks awesome, even if it did get a little cracked by the brutal crown once the show started."
BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,IfTheseTreesCouldTal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:01:24 2015 UTC,It had lights on the eyes area right>?

BABYMETAL,3dhyw5,Tarumo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"An Asmart type mask would probably have been way more expensive to ship as it is a) not a print product (many postal services have lower prices on books, magazines, etc.) and b) would not fit into a magazine sized envelope.  I like the initial idea by Metal Hammer. How about printing a hundred of those and use them for the Megitsune entry at the next live show?  :)"
BABYMETAL,3diol9,kinzokumetal,7,Thu Jul 16 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"Gloves - Yui on her right hand, Moa on her left hand - This rule applies only religiously post-Budokan, before they alternated.  Hair - Koba/Amuse are developing individual/recognisable hair for each member...  Su - Single hair tie, with two long side bangs to frame her face always  Moa - Twin tails but with a definite tightly curled style  Yui - Twin tails but loose and free.  Another way to tell them apart...  Yui - has arms Moa - has bendy arms Su - has reallyyy bendy arms"

I've watched almost all of their past concerts chronologically and I can see their growth throughout each concerts.

BABYMETAL,3dhxvs,jabberwokk,2,Thu Jul 16 14:00:48 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I doubt they need too much prodding to stay in shape anyway. There's no way they'd settle for giving anything less in their performances than everything they've got.

Dancing for that long all at once has to be pretty rough, so they've at least got endurance.  Edit: Also they're 16 years old and either their diets are good or they have fantastic metabolism.

BABYMETAL,3dhxvs,gdscei,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:23 2015 UTC,They also said that they only had 2 weeks of rehearsal for the tour. Maybe the 4 hours a day is only exclusive for the tour since they need to cramp as much rehearsal time as possible due to time limitation.

BABYMETAL,3dhxvs,echospectre,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"17 here, my diet has been awful (way too many donuts and cheeseburgers) for the past couple months and I don't really work out besides walking places. Somehow I have muscle and weigh 135 lbs, though that muscle wouldn't be visible if it weren't for me being light. So it could also be genes that are causing them to be so fit/muscular.  Either way a combination of working out, being a teenager, and having good genetics will definitely make you fit. Not to mention Yui eats raw tomatoes so her diet would be alright at least I'd imagine, and that only helps her further."
BABYMETAL,3dhxvs,DangerInTheHood,3,Thu Jul 16 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they (including Su) do work out a lot.

Entertaining. You bet.    DragonForce’s skill merrily dances between madcap and genius. “This song is about blood, vampires and darkness,” they explain at one point before leaping into an electric ‘Symphony of the Night’. Carrying themselves with such joy though, it’s never anything but a pleasure to witness.    Joining with Babymetal may seem strange but that message of entertainment through music and fantastical storytelling is not only empowering, but shared. Running onto the stage to create Baby Dragon Metal Force, the super group lean into a playful rendition of ‘Gimme Chocolate’ that sends waves of excitement through the overflowing tent. They came, they conquered then Babymetal are off, smiling and waving at the biggest reaction of the weekend yet. It’s left to Dragonforce to follow that.    There’s only one song for it; the epic ‘Through The Fire And The Flames’ ensures that not a single person escapes without a grin."

BABYMETAL,3ddaja,krackythehoodedone,8,Thu Jul 16 00:30:40 2015 UTC,Well they are getting all growed up real fast. Funny this should come up now because I just changed my work computer screen saver from the brilliant Forum shot by Dana of the three girls in mid air at the end of the show to this  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJe3NoTUsAAZfrU.jpg  And for the first time I did not see a beautiful young girl but a women
BABYMETAL,3ddaja,Vinyalonde,5,Wed Jul 15 12:33:57 2015 UTC,"What a cool guy Hammett is! There was a documentary on Metallica several years ago on how the band was coping with some internal division and how they went about sorting out their problems. The lead singer (sorry, his name escapes me) was conflicted and in doubt of his ability; the drummer (Lars?) came across as one the most confident and driving people on the planet; the new bass player was in a state of awe because of his good fortune to join the group. And there was Hammett - confident, calm and a genuinely nice guy who seemed to be a stabilizing influence in his quiet, understated way.   What you describe seems entirely in character for Hammett."

BABYMETAL,3ddaja,MoonDevyl,0,Thu Jul 16 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"the drummer (Lars?) came across as one the most confident and driving people on the planet   Which is funny, because he's one of the worst drummers in all of metal."
BABYMETAL,3ddaja,MoonDevyl,3,Wed Jul 15 12:37:23 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I would have had taken the board out of the box and had him sign directly on it! Very cool though! I couldn't find a time frame when he was signing at the booth, and forgot what the booth number was. Otherwise, i would have loved to have stopped by, dropped some cash, had him sign, and greet him as well. Glad you had a good time at SDCC!!!"
BABYMETAL,3ddaja,koeleskab,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Ah, yeah he's usually jumping booths every year. But hopefully next year if you go to SDCC again you can catch him."
BABYMETAL,3ddaja,steelydancel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"First I have to be lucky enough to get a badge for whatever day he's signing! This was my third SDCC, but only the first time I was able to get a 4-Day badge. Also got preview night with it. Before, I was never able to get a Saturday badge. Last year, I was only able to get Thursday and Sunday, but couldn't go on Sunday because I had tickets for BABYMETAL at the Fonda. I'll try again this November for pre-reg, and hope I can have luck on my side again."

Official Merchandise.          Japanese metal band Baby Metal have finally arrived at Grindstore! Taking inspiration from the Fox God or Kitsune the three totally crazy girls, Su-metal, Yuimetal and Moametal, are pictured wearing fox masks against a background of skulls and horns in this awesome tee advertising their Back to the USA/UK tour 2014."

Same deal as Grindstore, also confirmed as official, also no print on back, although Ripleys is one up them by also having Ladies' versions of the shirts, which is very cool.    I guess the Ripleys shirts never got a post with a clear-cut title, they first appeared in this thread and then in follow-ups."

Some japanese fans were confused because the Comic book tee doesn't have the Tour dates in the back. This is just a different edition like 3Foxes."
BABYMETAL,3ddeu8,maikgianino,2,Wed Jul 15 12:57:15 2015 UTC,"These are the same shirts that are supplied to Ripleys, this is the response I got from Ripleys when I emailed them about whether they are official or not.  https://i.imgur.com/eBXkaS4.png  The shirts are also on Amazon."

BABYMETAL,3ddeu8,plumar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"Bought both shirts, shipping for 2 shirts was decent with 6 pounds instead of freaking 19 pounds at Ripleys. Hopefully L will fit (M from Rock im Revier was a bit short and tight, but if the shirts are also from GILDAN(?) it should be fine).    EDIT: Just checked and I have a lot of GILDAN shirts, all in M and they fit very different. Why are even shirts from the same label in the same size not exactly identical?"

Ah, good to know it is a useful alternative.     Why are even shirts from the same label in the same size not exactly identical?      That sure doesn't help. I guess it's the nature of the global apparel industry today, shifting supply continually. Do they have country of manufacture listed?"

BABYMETAL,3d92g2,SirAwesomecake,7,Tue Jul 14 22:11:53 2015 UTC,"They have time to print more, i hope they will for those who couldn't find the way to order one. Also, the Kitsune-Mask was a huge boost to sold out the magazine so fast."
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,andy1295,5,Tue Jul 14 14:15:26 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, they probably sold out of the masks rather than the magazine itself. They'll probably resell an alternative version with no mask or an alternative gift. They don't grow on Kitsune trees after all."
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,SirAwesomecake,7,Tue Jul 14 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, the mask comes with the magazine which is part of the magazine in the same way posters are. It hasn't released in shops yet so still a chance"
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,Captain_Username,4,Tue Jul 14 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"I hope that doesn't mean it's one of those cut out masks where you put it on your face with a bit of string haha. Either way, I'm glad I spent literally the last £5 in my account on one when I did then."
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,SirAwesomecake,7,Tue Jul 14 17:39:04 2015 UTC,I think that's most likely what the mask is.
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,Greybeard_21,6,Tue Jul 14 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"I'd like to hope it's not. Metal Hammer isn't some kids magazine. That being said I've never bought any issues from them before.  Babymetal colouring pages, mazes and activities with red and black crayons included coming right up!"
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,SirAwesomecake,5,Tue Jul 14 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"In some ways Metal Hammer is a kids magazine; last time they included BM related stuff you could cut out your very own ""Metal Elitist"" badge...."
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,Greybeard_21,4,Tue Jul 14 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"I'll pretend and hope that that was some kind of joke they tried to do. I'd like to hope since it's a bigger issue for summer, rather than a monthly one, it'll be a proper mask. If not, at least it was only £5."
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,SirAwesomecake,3,Tue Jul 14 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"It will (probably) be flat, to ship it in a magazine. It could be cardboard, but my guess is the same material that they print posters on. So: Not for wearing - for display only...."
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,Aka-oni-san,5,Tue Jul 14 21:00:25 2015 UTC,My dreams are slowly dying.
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,jabberwokk,2,Tue Jul 14 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"Don't give up hope, magazines are often shipped in big plastic bags with all sorts of extras. It could be a simple (cheap) full size fox mask, a mini fox mask.. and i think the cardboard cut out fox mask isn't likely at all."

BABYMETAL,3d92g2,BM4ever,2,Tue Jul 14 22:59:59 2015 UTC,"That would suck.  When they say free mask while showing a cover of the mask on the magazine, I expect it to look exactly like the one they're showing!"
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,inkybloaters,3,Wed Jul 15 03:28:35 2015 UTC,Can't see it being a real mask. How difficult would it be to ship the magazine with that massive mask protruding from the surface? Would be very bad economically.  I fully expect a template that I cut out myself then have to tape to my own face.
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,BM4ever,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:45 2015 UTC,I get magazines in my store with gifts as big as a mask would be all the time. I didn't order online so I don't know if there was a P&P charge. If there was then they're covered. I'm expecting a full-sized mask but made of fairly thin plastic.
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,inkybloaters,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"But how would it work with shipping overseas? Presumably, it wouldn't go down well if the masks arrived crushed during shipping."
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,BM4ever,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:02 2015 UTC,That I don't know but a bit of bubble wrap inside a Jiffy bag (which already has padding) should be enough. It's not that expensive when bought in bulk. You can get a 30 metre roll of the large bubble type for about £16.   Edit: Seen the actual thing now. I still think they could have done a plastic one but hey ho!
BABYMETAL,3d92g2,plumar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I would have loved a proper one but I'll take this. I'm just very glad that Metal Hammer are making an effort."

BABYMETAL,3d92g2,WireOne52,5,Tue Jul 14 18:00:38 2015 UTC,In the UK it will be on shop shelves on the 21st of July.  I'll probably just pick it up while I do my shopping at the supermarket.

BABYMETAL,3d92g2,ein_myria,2,Tue Jul 14 22:01:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they just import news stand copies then.

In the UK we have a lot of indepent radio stations, which are local or they are found on the internet. Now we also have national radio, run by the BBC you can hear in anywhere in the UK and the top of that list is Radio 1. Now normaly to get played on Radio 1 you need to be in the charts or to really be heavly pluged by your record company, believe me they are verry picky about what gets played during the day time weekday. Looking at the time stamp it was almost 11 am, so your looking at between 8 - 10 million people hearing Give me choc. So that's one hell of a plug for BM."

Su could learn a lot from Amy Lee, Floor Jansen, Cristina Scabbia, and many other great female metal singers.  Su's voice has angelic, lyric quality like no other, which is great, but Su would be amazed to see how these top-notch singers can move from chest voice to chest-dominant mix to head-dominant mix, and then to head voice so smoothly and without strain.

I want Su to learn from them right now I dont know who is Su's inspiration in her style (could be an idol) but its going to perfect for her to learn from these singers, with Su's charisma and those singing techniques su gonna be beyond perfect!"

BABYMETAL,3d82km,BM4ever,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"Ozzfest should be performed inside and that's probably the better choice if you like metal music in general.  It looks like they will be performing at Mountain Stage for Summer Sonic Tokyo so that is actually inside (Marine stage is the outside one). If you want to listen to lots of different style of music, Summer Sonic is the better choice."
BABYMETAL,3d82km,moeffin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:16:26 2015 UTC,Depends on your taste in music. I would probably go to summer sonic because it seems really cool and many other big groups are playing. But if your like ozzy then probably there although it does seem they will have a longer set.

BABYMETAL,3d8clc,jabberwokk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"I notice Su said ""Mexico"" with the English ""x"" sound in her ending segment in English. In concert, when she said ""Gracias, México"" in Spanish, she used the Spanish pronunciation."
BABYMETAL,3d8360,Kitsunetsukii,4,Tue Jul 14 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome translations!    From the very first time i heard it, even though it was a kinda crappy bootleg and my Japanese level is very low, i got the distinct feeling that it was about genre classifications in music. I don't know why. And if you take some of the chigaus to mean ""wrong"" more than ""different"" it could be seen as being sung from the perspective of a metalhead confused by BABYMETAL.    That's my interpretation anyway. I guess that's the beauty of ambiguous lyrics."
BABYMETAL,3d8360,Mudko,2,Tue Jul 14 09:28:55 2015 UTC,"And if you take some of the chigaus to mean ""wrong"" more than ""different"" it could be seen as being sung from the perspective of a metalhead confused by BABYMETAL.    Yeah I got that felling too. mainly from this section. lol   [ Even so, ]  They are different. They are different.  [ Even so, ]  They are different. They are different.  [ Even so, ]  They are different.  They are too different, so I am at a loss."
BABYMETAL,3d8360,TheThrawn,4,Tue Jul 14 10:03:53 2015 UTC,"Same here. If many fans get the same impression, it's probably what was intended? I really like the idea that it's kind of making fun of people who are too serious about it all instead of just enjoying fun music. When I read the translation, in my head I had the image of some pseudo metal elitist in the manner of a mad scientist running in circles in his lab being all like ""no this is wrong, this can't be it"" while trying to figure them out and losing his mind lol"
BABYMETAL,3d8360,iwabo-fukei,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:14:04 2015 UTC,I interpreted it similarly with the lyrics as a comment about people saying they aren't metal and the girls noticing the many types of metal out there. More of a confusion or observation on the girls part about someone saying they aren't metal yet them noticing the many types of metal and the same sounds they have.
BABYMETAL,3d8360,futonsrf,3,Wed Jul 15 22:56:35 2015 UTC,Wowowowow hold the fuck up! What is Chigau?? Did I miss a new song?

BABYMETAL,3d8360,jabberwokk,2,Tue Jul 14 15:02:14 2015 UTC,"I too thought that it might also refer to music but Du-Enki's interpretation is a sound one (no pun intended).  In a general sense, perhaps the song is about how much people equate their sense of identity (who and what they are) with what they choose. And, in perhaps a small way, some might think that they can define themselves through the things they buy."

If necessary, you can find the resolution at the specs website of your phone. Just find a photo you like and crop it the way you like, then send it to your phone and you're done.

BABYMETAL,3d77ob,Squall21,3,Tue Jul 14 04:39:57 2015 UTC,"There was a whole 8 month period where I only heard them once. Then I became an actual fan of theirs and now it's BABYMETAL all day everyday :P  Edit: Oh wait, there are ~10 minute intervals where I'm playing Smash and the stage I'm playing on doesn't have any BABYMETAL tracks on it."
BABYMETAL,3d77ob,wasneeplus89,3,Tue Jul 14 04:45:45 2015 UTC,"mayyybe 48 hours. It's hard to say. Even when I'm on a trip, I have BM on my phone or be able to find wifi to check the sub."

BABYMETAL,3d77ob,ZeusAllMighty11,2,Tue Jul 14 06:39:34 2015 UTC,A few hours whilst on holiday fishing in the keys. Mind you this was a few days after I had gone to Toronto and Chicago so BM was the only reason I was in the US to start with
BABYMETAL,3d77ob,MoaMaestro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:12:02 2015 UTC,You really had to give yourself time after those concerts to process all of the details. There is so much going on your brain goes into overwhelm. It's almost like pealing an onion. You find layer after layer of musical nuance.
BABYMETAL,3d77ob,ainky,2,Tue Jul 14 13:32:31 2015 UTC,"When Black Night  / Red Night happened, I waited a good 3 or 4 days before reading anything about it. I was really busy with other things, I kind of forgot.. but I won't forget again!"

BABYMETAL,3d77ob,Dwarfda,2,Tue Jul 14 14:07:41 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I never really pay attention to such a thing. When you have shirts to wear, music to listen to, and blogs/forums to read, and updates...it's hard to imagine not thinking/keeping up with BABYMETAL!"
BABYMETAL,3d77ob,Spifffyy,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:44 2015 UTC,sleep times? rest of the day filled with bikes and babymetal...

BABYMETAL,3d7l9l,chibistevo,2,Tue Jul 14 05:51:47 2015 UTC,My guess is August or September. Either before Reading&Leeds to build momentum or after to capitalize on momentum they will hopefully get from there. **Edit: I somehow forgot about Summer Sonic? So they have that to potentially use momentum from as well.
BABYMETAL,3d7l9l,Mudko,2,Tue Jul 14 03:35:11 2015 UTC,We will know more after August 28 i think
BABYMETAL,3d7l9l,Nabazul,2,Tue Jul 14 04:33:02 2015 UTC,Who's to say that it's going to be a single? It may just be 1 song from a new album.

BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,DangerInTheHood,2,Tue Jul 14 04:37:47 2015 UTC,I used to always skip Onedari but once I gave it a good listen I came around
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,TheFrozenEmpire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"I still find myself skipping that sometimes. Especially when I play all the BM songs playlist on my iPod, with multiple different versions of many songs - I usually skip the studio version of OD in that scenario."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,Jedrus,2,Tue Jul 14 13:33:58 2015 UTC,"For me it was actually 'Gimmie Choco' that I didn't really like at first, followed by '4 no Uta'. Now I actually like both songs. It's like when I listened to Nightwish the first time, I was introduced to 'Wishmaster' and I did not like it at all but after sometime and listening to the band I actually began to like it."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,lifemusic1-2,2,Tue Jul 14 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"I would skip Catch Me If You Can and Akumu no Rondo when I first started listening because Headbangya and Ijime, Dame, Zettai were/still are my favorite songs. I love them all now and only wish there were more songs to love."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,androph,2,Tue Jul 14 00:52:01 2015 UTC,"Gimme Chocolate and Doki Doki Morning. I had my reasons for disliking them at first, but when I was fully addicted to BM, I really ended up liking them. Still do."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,DethMetLKhaos,2,Tue Jul 14 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"Rondo of Nightmare, Akatsuki and Gimme Chocolate.   After seeing RoN and Akatsuki live, I've gotten to liking them more. It may be due to Su's vocals now vs then. I still skip these songs frequently while listening to the album.   Gimme Choco is just a weak song to me. I like it more when performed live with Kami Band.  Of the 3, probably RoN was the biggest change."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,faygo5000,2,Tue Jul 14 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"GC, which was also the first song I heard from them. To this day, it is my least favorite song, but I love it."

BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,MM305,2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:26 2015 UTC,"all the hate on iine.  i mean i understand hating the rap part but at the same time thats kind of what ive always loved about the song is just the fact that its 5 genres in one.  Still dont really like 4 no Uta that much (all the repetition gets annoying after awhile).  But i originally wasnt much a fan of Gimme choco and Uki Uki Midnight, but ive warmed up to both."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,poleosis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"Damn I forgot Uki Uki Midnight! The dubstep was such a huge turn-off, but I've learned to really love that song!"

BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,dick_stalls,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"Mine is probably 4 no Uta. I just couldn't get into it. I'm all for (hue) silly songs with pointless lyrics and such, but a song that was literally about the number 4 just didn't gel with me.  After a few runs through the album it's grown on me, but it's probably my least favourite song of theirs. I like the music, and the live versions with the call outs and such are really good.  I'd say I'm a fan of Black Babymetal with Onedari Daisakusen and such, but yeah, 4 no Uta was the one I didn't like."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,SirAwesomecake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:52:58 2015 UTC,"Rondo for me. At the start, i thought the song was chaotic and didn't contain a rhythm i could follow. When i then found that rhythm i loved the song."

Until now I still skip that part, I still find it over the top. But I love IDZ as a song and especially when they do it live."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,bloodycow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:22:10 2015 UTC,"When 4 no Uta first came out I was quite upset with it because at that time I didn't understand the concept behind it. At first it felt like ""trying too hard to be witty and different"" to me. But once I understood the meaning I was able to enjoy the song, even more so after I realized YuiMoa actually wrote the song.  That's the only song I had such experience with. Everything else I loved from the start."

BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,Deadmansplat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"Hated the rap part of iine at first, and the reggae bits of Uta.  Mostly because of what the genres focus around.  Rap glorifies violence and even the female rappers I have heard put down women, not all of it is that way, but enough to make me dislike the genre.  Just like how most reggae I have heard pushes Jesus, religion, and God.  After hearing the live version of iine enough it just seemed to be missing something though, and once I thought about the translation for Uta I just couldn't hate kids poking fun at superstition.  Now iine is probably my favorite, especially the vega mix, where they poke fun at themselves."
BABYMETAL,3d6ukd,maikgianino,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:29:07 2015 UTC,"None, but probably the ""least"" favorite is Doki Doki Morning. I need to listen Awadama Fever in better quality to give an impression but at the moment is my least favorite with Doki Doki Morning, but actually Maik loves all the songs."

Known for their quirky approach to songwriting,  Sparks' music is often accompanied by intelligent, sophisticated, and acerbic lyrics,  and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's wide-eyed hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's sedentary scowling. They are also noted for Russell Mael's falsetto voice and Ron Mael's keyboard style.

BABYMETAL,3d0x51,G-METAL,7,Sun Jul 12 16:27:23 2015 UTC,Hi-chan!! I love how she is always showing support for BABYMETAL. She's one of my favorites from Sakura Gakuin. Would be cool if she did some guest vocals one day. The girl has a great voice.
BABYMETAL,3d0x51,MoaMoney,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:08:13 2015 UTC,Hell ya.  Like a live vocal on the 'outtro' (assuming they ever do it again).
BABYMETAL,3d0x51,reddit41craig,4,Mon Jul 13 21:24:48 2015 UTC,"HI-METAL Death!!!   :D  But more seriously: When I first got to learn about the SG girls I thought if any of the other girls were to join BABYMETAL, it would have to be Hinata. She seems to sing a bit better than Yui and Moa (see this and the newer clips in this) and while she is not quite as kawaii as them, she has plenty of appeal in her own more unique way and she has a fairly strong presence and a kind of coolness that I think could fit in pretty well. She is a god dancer too, but hypothetically, if she started now, she would have a really hard time building up the necessary stamina and proficiency to keep up with all the insanely complex and exhausting dance routines... but she might well have succeeded in the end."
BABYMETAL,3d0x51,JalmarY,3,Sun Jul 12 19:27:38 2015 UTC,Not as kawaii??? Blasphemy!!!!! Lol  Her English is very good in singing reading and writing I think you can have a full convo with her and she would understand everything

BABYMETAL,3d0x51,JalmarY,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:23:18 2015 UTC,Hinata is my favorite singer. IMO she has best voice in SG.
BABYMETAL,3d0x51,RickRiko,3,Sun Jul 12 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"Except Suzuka, I assume. Su-chan is in a league by herself IMO."
BABYMETAL,3d0x51,JalmarY,3,Sun Jul 12 20:13:54 2015 UTC,Su Ayami
BABYMETAL,3d0x51,zahrul3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ayami has a really wonderful sweet voice, to match her wondefully sweet presence. For Idol/Jpop vocal stuff she is up there with Hinata. However, I have not listened enough to them to make up my opinion yet on how the 2 rank against each-other in that context...   But for more vocally challenging stuff, Hinata is the only one (except for Su obviously) I have recognized potential in to successfully  take on challenges that go beyond Idol/Jpop. But, I would really be happy to be surprised by some other SG girl showing such potential too."

BABYMETAL,3d092p,bebii-metaru-desu,6,Sun Jul 12 12:57:24 2015 UTC,No i really dont think i did. You maybe right though because i was looking at her for a few seconds to confirm it was her.
BABYMETAL,3d092p,Xanthon,3,Sun Jul 12 12:59:57 2015 UTC,"Well, most idols keep their parents' identities secret. It's probably one of the reason she have them turned around too."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,wasneeplus89,5,Sun Jul 12 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"You know, I have always wondered what kind of parents would allow their children to enter the idol industry at such a young age (something I would never ever allow with my children). It strikes me as kind of silly to be so protective on the one hand and still have that to look back on. Like momma Mizuno never considered the possibility that her daughter might actually become really successful with what she does. Yeah you'll encounter staring fans with your daughter's face on their shirts from time to time, what did you expect would happen?"
BABYMETAL,3d092p,Aka-oni-san,7,Sun Jul 12 13:16:06 2015 UTC,"I think her parent was just being protective, parents think of worst case scenarios and pretty much always choose to be 'better safe than sorry.'  Bad scenarios in this case would be something like.. foreigner fan scares Yui,, or more Japanese people notice Yui because of the fan in Babymetal tshirt and surround them, clambouring for autographs or photographs...  And so on. Better to just avoid the one person in 20,000 people that recognised her. Like the op said, I think Yui will be happy a fan was representing BM and maybe she'll chuckle at how shocked he looked when he saw her :)"
BABYMETAL,3d092p,wasneeplus89,3,Sun Jul 12 13:26:04 2015 UTC,"You can't fault her for being protective, it's just that I'm wondering if she was seeing this moment in her mind's eye when signing Yui up for audition."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,Aka-oni-san,3,Sun Jul 12 13:32:00 2015 UTC,"I can kind of imagine Yui pleading to be allowed to audition :) In lots of cases of child stars the parents are the ones pushing and demanding, but Yui's ambition seems to have been born from her own enthusiasm. Well that's the story we have anyhow. I hope Yui writes an autobiography one day, maybe her mum has always been the worrier, who knows."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,wasneeplus89,3,Sun Jul 12 13:38:46 2015 UTC,"That we won't know until the aforementioned autobiography comes out. Whatever the case, Yui needed permission from her parents. A young girl with dreams of being a pop star is the most common thing in the world. Parents who would actually go through with that are a lot rarer. I would be genuinely interested to hear how they feel about the whole thing some day."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,zahrul3,2,Sun Jul 12 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"There's an (once)translated, 20 minute long private fan session where Sakura Gakuin fans and one fan asked one of the girls(moa?) about what you just said."

BABYMETAL,3d092p,CHARLIE-METAL,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"That we won't know until the aforementioned autobiography...some day.   It is clear you guys (Aka-oni-san and you) have only been following this sub-reddit recently.  It is already known through Sakura Gakuin diaries that Yui-metal's family discouraged her from SG saying that it would be 'hard work'.  But Yui-metal saw some SG performance in person and became adamant in joining SG.  Her diaries mentioned how long and hard she practiced for her audition.  Also, Yui-metal detailed extensively about why she joined SG.  If you really want to know the details you can do a ""site: www.reddit.com/r/sakuragakuin"" search in your chosen search tool."

BABYMETAL,3d092p,perkited,2,Wed Jul 15 06:52:47 2015 UTC,"I think her mother knows how a native Japanese person would normally react in that situation but she has no idea how a foreigner would, so she's just taking the safe option."

BABYMETAL,3d092p,FlipperWolf2,5,Sun Jul 12 12:10:03 2015 UTC,Quick Question: Was Yui like this when you spotted her?

BABYMETAL,3d092p,Aka-oni-san,3,Sun Jul 12 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! You got very lucky. And it sounds like Yui's mum is just being a mum.   At Golden Gods part of the Babymetal entourage were getting sushi, they looked like one of the girls' mum and a sister/friend. Then later there was talk Yui was travelling with family. I wonder if they were the same people you saw.  Were the stairs they were walking down the same stairs you were on? Imagine if you hadn't noticed until she was 2 foot away from you :)"
BABYMETAL,3d092p,rezarNe,3,Sun Jul 12 13:04:56 2015 UTC,"looked like one of the girls' mum   It's most likely their translator, who is a 30 something female"

BABYMETAL,3d092p,Swissmountainrailway,3,Mon Jul 13 00:20:07 2015 UTC,How can you be sure that she was Yui's mom?
BABYMETAL,3d092p,SirAwesomecake,2,Sun Jul 12 15:35:21 2015 UTC,I cant be but she had no bodygaurds and they were walking together at a large concert so most likely her mom.
BABYMETAL,3d092p,zahrul3,3,Sun Jul 12 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much why I'd never want to see them in the open. Its hard not to take that kind of reaction as an insult, regardless of the good intentions of parents I bodyguard teams."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,SirAwesomecake,3,Sun Jul 12 17:00:33 2015 UTC,Yea. And i easily could have gone up the stairs to follow them but leaving them alone seemed like the right thing to do.
BABYMETAL,3d092p,okapon,2,Sun Jul 12 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think it's kind of sad, that the t-shirt which in fact you wore in appreciation of BABYMETAL was the thing, which actually scared them away. But I guess that is how the world of popularity and stardom works these days.  Of course on the other hand, I understand the mother being protective of her child, but as far as I understood you weren't poking a camera around or asking for something..."

BABYMETAL,3d092p,SirAwesomecake,2,Sun Jul 12 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"That's pretty damn awesome!  She was probably trying to prevent any photos from being taken. Keeping ones family secret/out of the way for Idols is a big thing in Japan. You'd be hard-pressed to find any information on any of the family of any Idol singers unless those family members were already some form of ""celebrity"".  Kind of how no one actually knows anything about Suzukas family past Himeka because she's already an Idol herself. The only other thing that's absolutely known is that she has a mother because she's spoke of her, but beyond that, nothing.  I don't think there would have been much thought of there being a danger past you wanting to actually go up and meet Yui, but I doubt any self respecting fan would actually go out of their way to approach a member who is clearly out with their friends/family."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,ginger_metal,7,Sun Jul 12 14:32:21 2015 UTC,"""The only other thing that's absolutely known is that she has a mother""  Don't we all have one? ;-)"

BABYMETAL,3d092p,Dead_Poets,3,Sun Jul 12 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"Idol singers unless those family members were already some form of ""celebrity"".   Ayami Muto's father is known, full name included, a horse trainer, not exactly a celebrity but there it is, probably because he wanted himself to be known."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,Moaiine,3,Sun Jul 12 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"Most likely wanted to be known, yeah. It happens, but most of the time Idol's families remain a complete misery. I've known people who actually ended up being under NDA agreements because they knew a famous persons family members' names and they wanted to keep the information protected. I'd imagine people like Koba are under similar, unwritten agreements, because he must work alongside the families in some way to get them show tickets or inform them of where they are going to be."

BABYMETAL,3d092p,Moaiine,2,Sun Jul 12 20:39:58 2015 UTC,"yea that seems to be the case i would of thought, its nice to see her chilling out and having some well deserved time off :).  What i loved about the team Rock radio thing was it was actually them talking on a show and speaking of experiances of meeting bands, it would be awesome to see them appear on some more TV shows like Music Dragon, Hotwave and the Taiwan TV show Part 1 and Part 2 as they were great fun and we learned a lot from them as well :)  Also i think we know that Yui has a younger brother as well as i believe she said in an SG diary entry somewhen but we know very little which is normal in Japan for Idols"
BABYMETAL,3d092p,Spifffyy,2,Sun Jul 12 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"Because of the places I tend to frequent and the events I often go to, I often see a lot of people who could kinda be considered ""celebrities"" just out and about, doing their thing. It's always somewhat humbling to remember that that guy you like the work of really is just a guy who does normal guy stuff. It's always nice to know that even in the middle of a massive surge in international popularity, the members of Babymetal have time to just be guys too.  That video of them on the plane after a show, I think it was after Singapore, was adorable, but pretty rude to have been done. Things like that are seen as incredibly invasive, even if it's literally done nothing negative to them. I'm glad that Babymetal hasn't been subjected to the Western Paparazzi culture and have had their lives ruined by people trying to get tonnes of pictures of them everywhere.  I'd love them to do more of that kind of thing. It was nice to see just how far their English has come too. It never feels like they are being overly forced or restricted in what they can say. It's probably not the case, and they really are, but it's nice to see how humble they are regardless.  I think Suzuka is known to have another sister too, but I'm not entirely sure.  It's a very Western thing to want to learn more about a person's family when they are famous, but the exact opposite in Japan. I'm perfectly happy not knowing anything about their personal lives."
BABYMETAL,3d092p,LehmannDaHero,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:49:09 2015 UTC,Suzuka and Himeka have an older sister who isn't in showbiz. There is actually a picture of the three of them at 11:42 in this video (found this again via /u/jabberwokk) - it's a segment on Himeka's birthday (starts around 10:30).

BABYMETAL,3d092p,BM4ever,2,Sun Jul 12 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the fact that you left the concert early and appeared to be waiting at the stairs made Yui's mom (or whoever she was) suspect you had been watching Yui and possibly following her. And you aren't Japanese? That and the BM shirt probably sent up another red flag of suspicion. If there was no adult male with them, the mom probably made a quick decision to play it safe rather than risk an encounter with a possibly fanatical fan. That's the price of fame, for both Yui and sincere fans like yourself.  Sad that you didn't get to at least smile at her or say hello in passing. But cool that you saw her in person."

BABYMETAL,3czstj,IdolMetalheadDEATH,2,Sun Jul 12 07:16:48 2015 UTC,Great work! I love the old custom decorated battle jackets so much more than just buying a t-shirt.  Still missing mine lost to a fire a decade ago. :(
BABYMETAL,3czstj,Tarumo,2,Sun Jul 12 10:45:01 2015 UTC,"I lost mine at a Machine Head gig :(   Had loads of patches on it that I'll probably never replace.  I had it pulled off me when I fell in the pit, all I was left with is the patch I tore off as I tried to hold onto it."

BABYMETAL,3czstj,Mindflizzle,2,Sun Jul 12 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry mate i don't have it,  it was a replica t-shirt that i bought in Mexican online shop, but I think that the design is called budokan you can try and searched on google"
BABYMETAL,3czstj,bouketenvoorde,3,Sun Jul 12 20:16:44 2015 UTC,how did you get that large patch?? I need that image !

BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,okapon,14,Sat Jul 11 17:19:44 2015 UTC,Now that looks absolutely spectacular. Watch for the massive spike in sales for this issue.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,BM4ever,13,Sat Jul 11 17:44:26 2015 UTC,Ordered mine :)  You can bet if there is a spike in sales that we'll be seeing a helluva lot more BABYMETAL in Metal Hammer from now on.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,Captain_Username,7,Sat Jul 11 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"Which I think, we can all agree, would be a very good thing."
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,BM4ever,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:53:09 2015 UTC,To be fair i dont think Metal Hammer could have been any more supportive of BM if they tried. They have been brilliant to them. Ok if you were slightly cynical they have certainly played the ''print stuff'' and wait for the explosion of protest and counter protest to boost their hits but they are a business after all
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,krackythehoodedone,3,Mon Jul 13 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I still love watching Dom Lawson's review of the album and his preview of Sonisphere. In both cases, you can see that he genuinely likes and is supportive of Babymetal. He can be pretty harsh at times (watch any of his Nickelback reviews) so to see him praise Babymetal was a relief."
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,BM4ever,10,Mon Jul 13 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's an epic image and deserves a huge poster treatment."
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,FrankyFe,9,Sat Jul 11 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Well I've ordered it. First time I've ever ordered Metal Hammer. When they're getting their record breaking end of year bonuses, they should thank Babymetal."
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,BM4ever,5,Sat Jul 11 17:57:20 2015 UTC,I've never ordered an issue of any magazine ever. That just changed with this issue of Metal Hammer.

BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,TweetsInCommentsBot,12,Sat Jul 11 18:14:45 2015 UTC,Holly crap.  I just bought a paper magazine.  First time in three / four years.  I'm really glad they didn't force a 12-month subscription on you to get the BM issue.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,RS-METAL,9,Sat Jul 11 20:50:35 2015 UTC,Just the cover is enough to tempt me. Probably the most affordable thing since the global release of the album. Take my money!
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,Squall21,10,Sat Jul 11 19:24:29 2015 UTC,BEST. COVER. EVER.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,zetoberuto,17,Sat Jul 11 19:51:40 2015 UTC,That was the easiest money they ever made.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,DaemonSD,6,Sat Jul 11 18:03:10 2015 UTC,Yep... caved in to that in seconds.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,gdscei,4,Sat Jul 11 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"Never bought a copy before, That didnt take long :)"
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,ravasempai,4,Sat Jul 11 22:28:30 2015 UTC,I was actually surprised that it was cheaper than buying a copy at B&N. Gonna have to order online from now on.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,Mindflizzle,2,Sun Jul 12 05:21:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, really? Is it because of the sale tax in your state? Or the base price itself is already higher than buying online?"
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,Mindflizzle,5,Sun Jul 12 05:27:43 2015 UTC,The base price is like 13 bucks or something. This was only 10. Saves me on gas too.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,mangdidge,2,Sun Jul 12 05:28:59 2015 UTC,yep gonna get mine hehehe
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,Buckaroo_Banzai_,7,Sun Jul 12 02:37:31 2015 UTC,Good for them. The band gets more exposure and the mag makes more sales. Happiness all around.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,inkybloaters,7,Sat Jul 11 18:09:08 2015 UTC,This is one of those times when working in a shop that sells magazines is a bonus.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,LordofChaDance,9,Sat Jul 11 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, I just had to order this one. They certainly know how to run a business."
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,TheThrawn,15,Sat Jul 11 19:52:38 2015 UTC,Well deserved.  Edit: The magazine will be on shelves on the 21st of July btw.

BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,RemyRatio,11,Sat Jul 11 21:20:59 2015 UTC,The haters probably puke blood with rage when they see this.
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,TheThrawn,15,Sat Jul 11 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest here, none of the edgy ""Trve Metal"" people actually do something as conformist as buying a magazine.  They probably just gain all new metal knowledge from the metal gods that talk to them through a spirit animal of some kind.  Oh wait..."
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,RideTheWingsOfDeath,3,Sat Jul 11 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"Something stupid like a ""Wolf God"" or some such nonsense."
BABYMETAL,3cxgdi,TheThrawn,3,Sun Jul 12 09:09:55 2015 UTC,They probably call it Fenrir or something  Only the Wolf God Knows tbh

BABYMETAL,3cxomi,MoaMaestro,2,Sun Jul 12 05:03:40 2015 UTC,This needs to be a thing.

And the full sleeves makes her look like a hybrid magical girl and power ranger, love it! :)    Aaah i just got really eager to see new costumes, hope i don't have to wait too long."

BABYMETAL,3cxomi,MoaMaestro,0,Sun Jul 12 06:40:56 2015 UTC,I guess Moa is one step closer to achieving her dream of being a voice actress in an anime..
BABYMETAL,3cxomi,MoaMoney,0,Sun Jul 12 08:46:28 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Reminds me of Bubblegum Crisis in a way. And for those who remember the anime, remember that Priss was a rock singer as well. This would be dope as an anime movie or OVA though. As many fans that go to live shows and even to the theaters just to watch the concerts I can see it being a huge success. And imagine a soundtrack with original songs!!!"
