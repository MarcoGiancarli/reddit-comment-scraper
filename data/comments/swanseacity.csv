swanseacity,3e75e6,jimmithy,3,Wed Jul 22 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"No reason for us to sell him. Maybe if Mitrovic was still on the market, but then we'd be going into the season with two unproven prem strikers.   We know what we've got with Gomis, and if his form carries over from the end of last year, he could bag us 15-20 goals this year."
swanseacity,3e2klb,xuz,6,Tue Jul 21 13:50:23 2015 UTC,Glad to see a manager making them earn their tens of thousands per week! I had no idea it was this focused though. Excellent read!

It is now getting on for 6.30pm, another day’s training is coming to an end and the Swansea manager heads back to the changing room, removing the microphone he was wearing during the session. “That’s more for myself, just to make sure that I’m clear with my points, it’s about development of yourself, really,” he says. “I’ll watch the session back when I get home tonight, see if I repeated myself too much on one point, or if I gave the right information. The bottom line is they’ve got to go and deliver it, so it’s got to be spot on. It comes back to accountability. Make everyone as accountable as possible.”   Is that normal? Either way, I respect that Monk is taking it on himself to train and improve not just the team, but himself. It's intense, but really cool."

swanseacity,3dqtch,spw79,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:40:04 2015 UTC,One big positive I'd take from the first half would be the way that the defense have responded well to high pressure going into transition. Midfielders and even wingers coming back to help relieve pressure is big... because high pressure is how many teams try to break down our possession when we play from the back. Good stuff.

swanseacity,3dnujh,colinaosurf,7,Fri Jul 17 22:44:57 2015 UTC,Looked around at clubs in the premier league on Wikipedia. The story of Swansea felt too good to be true... and it seems to be getting better! Still reeling after last season's success.

Far fetched I know! It would be as ridiculous as a team rising from rock bottom all the way to the top league..."
swanseacity,3dmod3,AlexSilvaGavan,3,Fri Jul 17 14:48:42 2015 UTC,"We were linked with him in the past but this makes absolutely zero sense, considering we've already got Eder. Why would we pay for a 30-year-old striker when we've got two over 27 on the books already?  Also, he's been linked to a move with Beskitas and Palace in the past two days. Hot air."
swanseacity,3dmod3,Swanseaa,2,Fri Jul 17 15:33:47 2015 UTC,Palace I could see happening but he just isn't coming here. It makes zero sense.   If anything I'd like us to sign someone like Mitrovic who is young and talented rather than someone coming to the end of their career.
swanseacity,3dmod3,MasonXD,3,Fri Jul 17 15:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and tbh Mitrovic doesn't make much sense now that Eder is here. That's a lot of competition for three guys that have played Champions League/ Europa League football.  I'd rather sign someone like Santos Borré, less-known, cheaper, young and heaps of potential."
swanseacity,3dmod3,Swanseaa,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"That is true, it seems like we've got an up and coming player in almost every position apart from striker. What really makes me want to grab Mitrovic is that I'm sure if we wait any longer he will go to someone else and I've really had my heart set on him all year."
swanseacity,3dmod3,MasonXD,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:22 2015 UTC,I'd love him too... I think he's a safer bet for us than Eder.
swanseacity,3dmod3,Swanseaa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Only problem is that its a significant investment, even if Mitrovic is a fairly safe bet as young strikers go. Oh, and not wanting to piss off Gomis again."

swanseacity,3dmod3,Swanseaa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:34 2015 UTC,If we get the next big striker for only 3 years at a time consistently then I'd probably be okay with that. So long as he leaves on good terms like Bony.

Fabianski was great at the start of the game. Defense was a bit sloppy but it seemed like we wanted Bartley in there for corners — Siggy was always targeting him in the box.

swanseacity,3de2nm,Semper_nemo13,4,Wed Jul 15 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"Gladbach played in half 1 with maybe 3 starters with jantschke, stindl and raffael.  In half 2 with only one potential starter, drmic. So not the best squads on the pitch"

swanseacity,3de2nm,Semper_nemo13,6,Wed Jul 15 18:15:54 2015 UTC,"My summary of what I saw.  You can tell it was our first game and that BMG had played a couple already (so I believe). But we started to dominate more as the game went on, very optimistic start! Grimes had a good game, lots of potential there. Emnes surprised me and did pretty well. Shelvey looks like he might cause a lot of problems to a lot of teams.  Dyer didn't seem to gel, his final touch is lacking but I don't mind so much because he has done so much for the club. Ayew and Eder have a lot of potential... I think Ayew will perform as expected and Eder will outperform expectations. Routs looks dangerous with his runs...  as usual.  As the games keep coming, I think we will go from strength to strength. I'm positive of a top half finish and hopefully go a bit further than last season.   Also, the 11 man switch was amusing to watch. You could see the hunger within the team."

Maybe a loan striker just in case but I don't think we need anymore really."

swanseacity,3d9p5v,Swanseaa,4,Tue Jul 14 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda sounds like GM has nothing to do with it.

swanseacity,3d66v8,PagingDrFreeman,9,Mon Jul 13 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"You cannot sit in the Liverpool fans end unless you buy the tickets for that away section specifically. You can only buy these from Liverpool, not from the Swans. However this is a moot point because you simply will not be able to get tickets for a Liverpool away game, such is the demand.  You can buy a home ticket (although you will need to be a Jack Army member to be sure of being able to purchase one, this costs 25 GBP and give you the chance to buy match tickets before they go on general sale and I imagine you'll need to do so to watch Swans - Liverpool. You must not cheer for Liverpool or wear Liverpool colours or give any hint you are a Liverpool fan. If you are sitting in the South (family) stand and you let a cheer slip, then you will get many dirty looks and may get kicked out by the stewards. If you are with the more hardcore Swans fans, you may find yourself targeted after the game. Also, I would find it really annoying as a home fan if someone did this.   Don't lemme put you off, it's not like the 1980s or anything, but you need to keep all this in mind. My advice is to come and watch and enjoy world class football, just think before you cheer :)"
swanseacity,3d66v8,electricsheepandroid,4,Mon Jul 13 21:14:10 2015 UTC,Just don't wear your shirt and sit in a more civil stand and you'll be fine.
swanseacity,3d66v8,MasonXD,5,Tue Jul 14 14:42:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know what part of Canada you're in or if you've ever been to a game in Canada, but it's very different. I can only speak for BC Place, but the difference is that it's a loss less ""hardcore"". At a whitecaps game, even against someone like Seattle, you'll people from both clubs, in pubs drinking together and having a good time. There is usually no feeling of hate between them and it's basically just a good day out. The stadiums typically filled with young and old, a lot of kids and a lot of families. The atmosphere is not hostile, ever.   In Swansea, yous shouldn't feel threatened by people, but you should know that they most likely won't appreciate an away supporter very much. I wouldn't go wearing a Liverpool kit, just in case you get that idiot who does something stupid. Then there's the chance that Liverpool wins or something controversial happens, you don't want to be in the middle of that. Chances are, nothing will go wrong, but there's a different mentality in the UK of what football means to the supporters. I'd say there is a lot more passion and commitment to the club."
swanseacity,3d66v8,Cant-Find-Username,3,Tue Jul 14 03:14:45 2015 UTC,"On top of what everyone else has said:  Don't wear Liverpool colours and don't show any support if you sit in the home end. That's culturally disrespectful. Remember we sell out every game and, particularly at a bigger game like one against Liverpool, you have to remember that if you manage to get a ticket you've got one ahead of a Swans fan. That kind of behaviour will harbour resentment.  If you do show colours in the Swans end, you likely would be quickly removed by stewards both for your safety and for the purposes of not spoiling the game for others. You'd be completely safe sat in the the West or South stands, but you would cause a lot of irritation and would be reported pretty quickly for that kind of thing. If you sat in the East end, I'd like to say you'd more than likely avoid getting into a fight, although if the stewards don't get you first a more boisterous fan might force you to remove your colours. Remember that fans here often don't see themselves as spectators, but as part of the club and as such a Liverpool shirt sat in the middle of the noisiest part of the ground is going to be seen seen as an attack on that concept. You'd be seen as actively hampering the atmosphere by many.  I don't mean the tone to sound threatening or anything, I just think you don't have a handle on the cultural side of the British game and you will cause a lot of problems for yourself and others if you aren't mindful of the fact that you're a visitor in a foreign country that is different to your own.  I'm really not a fan of your plans, the idea of someone in the home end actively being a supporter of the opposition doesn't sit well with me at all. However, if you're going to do it, be respectful and be invisible! I understand that as your relationship puts you and your partner on opposing teams its a bit more complicated, so I hope you can take what I'm saying as cautionary advice rather than an attempt to scare you off.  Also:   I swear I really do like the Swans, I just happen to love the reds a little bit more. Go easy on me.   I think telling people that would do more harm than good! You're better off telling people you're a good husband treating his lady than you are saying that."

swanseacity,3d66v8,sininc,2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"I certainly don't think you came off sounding. Most Swans fans would be quite welcoming at the ground of your situation. Away fans have sat in the stand near me without issue, though they didn't get too excited which helped. There would unfortunately be a small minority who would give you hassle.  As for the shirt issue, if you did wear an away shirt to the ground you would be denied entry, this came into force a few years ago after some complaints after we player a few bigger name teams who wore away shirts in the home stands.  I do hope you get to watch the Swans at some point. I was in Canada when the Swans played Cardiff for the first time in years and managed to find a sports bar showing it, had a great time."

I'm excited to see it play out this season.  Also I thought Barrow looked quite sharp in the 2 v 2's, he's seems to have gotten even quicker over the summer.  Lastly, Swanasea has to have one of the best youtube channels in the Premier League. The music and video editing is always absolutely fantastic, I genuinely look forward to the training videos.

I just hope he is still here for the Deportivo game so we can give him a proper... not 'goodbye', but 'see you soon'. I think he still has a lot to offer the club in the future. A player of his work ethic and passion for the club would hopefully be a key part in a transition to coaching."
swanseacity,3cxa2i,Jamaicaman90,6,Sat Jul 11 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"Leon was phenomenal for us during our rise from the Championship, he put in some great seasons in the Prem too, I wish he would have been given a chance in the England squad, at times I thought he was more deserving than others but being at Swansea held him back.  Phenomenal player, I would love to go see him over in America and pick up some nice money, would be great to see him shutting down the likes of Kaka and Villa."
swanseacity,3cxa2i,JamieKThomas,3,Sat Jul 11 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm a bit bias, but he's got to be the most underrated midfielder in the premier league for the last couple years. He's an essential part of the team, he's small but tough and one of the best passers in the world. He's one of those players that does nothing on paper but does everything behind the scenes. I'd love him to stay and retire, but if he wants game time then he deserves it. I don't think any true fan would be against the idea of selling a guy like that to give him some time before he retires. He just can't compete against the likes or Cork, Shelvey or Ki, fitness wise."
swanseacity,3cxa2i,Cant-Find-Username,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:02:33 2015 UTC,"He and Allen were a hell of a team our first PL season, but the decline has been evident in the years since, especially now when we've got quality alternatives. Cork was really the guy that sealed it, after years of looking for an adequate successor.   I argued during Laudrup's second season that he was playing Leon too much, that he was really most useful as a closer rather than a starter, and that was in a team that was generally slower in midfield than we are now, especially since Bony left. I'd never be disappointed to see Leon around, but sentiment aside, we've reached a level that he currently can't match."

Dave Adams is a top, top guy, and the U21s are in good hands. I interviewed him a while back - his level of knowledge on, well, everything is excellent and I can't wait to see what he's able to achieve with a few more years at the Swans under his belt:   http://theswanseaway.co.uk/2015/06/david-adams-academy-head-of-coaching-interview-conveyor-belts-cat-one-status-creating-the-right-environment/"

swanseacity,3cn4pn,BlazeMasterFunk,4,Thu Jul 9 04:57:16 2015 UTC,"442s a rare breed in modern football, gone are the days of strike partnerships.   Everyone's main focus these days is 'controlling midfield', a philosophy that we used to great effect in our ascent from league one.    I think we'll continue to play our 4-5-1 and rotate between Eder and Gomis up top,  I assume ayew will be out on the wing."
swanseacity,3cn4pn,Ferrisuk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:50:19 2015 UTC,"a philosophy that we used to great effect in our ascent from league one.   We were definitely early adopters, at least in the English leagues. I recall someone (perhaps Britton in Jack to a King?) saying that half the opposition we played between Martinez taking over and promotion to the Premier League couldn't work out how to play against us, and we threw all their marking systems out the window.  It's done us well so far and I don't think now is the time to change it - although there will become a time where, like all popular formations before it, the counter formation will take hold and we'll have to adapt."
swanseacity,3cn4pn,Jamaicaman90,3,Thu Jul 9 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"I very much doubt it. Chances are there will be plenty of time when 1 of those 3 are unfit anyways and as you say Ayew and Eder can play wide, so I just expect rotation.  3 decent strikers is just good depth for a 1 striker formation IMO."
swanseacity,3cn4pn,j1202,3,Thu Jul 9 10:43:06 2015 UTC,"Kinda, the ""diamond"" we played more or less from February on is a riff on the 4-4-2 but I doubt Èder and Gomis would play together, probably Ayew in the role Roteledge played; more of a free wing than a second striker.  Our 4-5-1 is a flexed 4-3-3 and I could see us playing that a lot as well, it is how we ended most of those matches, that formation would allow us to play Montero/Ayew together and just run at teams very wide, this formation sacrifices a midfield player for Montero. Which of the four depending on the match and the opposition. This is probably our most flexible formation, and the one that looks the most ""Swansea"""
swanseacity,3cn4pn,Semper_nemo13,2,Thu Jul 9 12:28:35 2015 UTC,I don't think we will play a two striker formation. Personal preference just says that I don't like them or believe in them working all that well.   The major change I can see would be that we are planning to play much more attacking this season and aim to score much more.
swanseacity,3cn4pn,MasonXD,2,Thu Jul 9 10:33:11 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for  442 diamond - like what worked a few times last season. With Bafe and Routledge the furthest forward but perhaps Ayew instead of Routledge now.

swanseacity,3cfpd4,Swanseaa,3,Tue Jul 7 23:50:07 2015 UTC,Barrow was a second striker/10 with the youth kinda like Michu when he played with Graham.
swanseacity,3cfpd4,Semper_nemo13,6,Wed Jul 8 00:02:51 2015 UTC,"Get me a Gorre Den Haag shirt, I'm all about it."
swanseacity,3cfpd4,Jamaicaman90,3,Tue Jul 7 17:03:26 2015 UTC,"I'm loving these loan moves. Ship off every one of our youth players to teams that will actually use them and they come back as better players, win win."
swanseacity,3ce5f7,GoodSamaritan_,2,Tue Jul 7 05:16:09 2015 UTC,"This was actually a very interesting read. God knows who could be in that book being scouted for the future. I liked the bit about having less people than a transfer committee too, it makes sense. Too many cooks and all that."
swanseacity,3ce5f7,genteelblackhole,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:02:12 2015 UTC,"I think something that should have been noted was that we aren't stupid with our money or the transfers.  Granted, we've made some questionable signings, they're heavily outweighed by good ones.  We've only sold players in the aim of progressing our club as a whole, take Ben Davies and Bony for example. Davies got us sigurdsson and created a good relationship with Tottenham which enabled us to get Naughton later on.  Bony's money has got us all of these exciting signings and enabled us to build squad depth. I can't recall the last time where we've had this squad depth.   Furthermore, I think there's currently a rumour circling that Huw Jenkins has said we have to sell one of our players and its pointing towards a midfielder (Shelvey/Ki). I would be upset with either of them going but its in the name of progressing our team.  Also I think Monk recognises value for money aswell, in the winter transfer window he stated ""[It's] a cattle market and everyone's selling all their cows and they're overpricing the cows - some of them are bad"""
swanseacity,3cb0c7,jimmithy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:34:50 2015 UTC,Crewe have a good reputation developing youngsters recently so I'm all for this. We seem to have a good relationship with Crewe too with other players going there so that can only be good for the future.
swanseacity,3cb98y,severedfragile,6,Mon Jul 6 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"Because of the way we've been as a club, I never know if I'm supposed to rank players based on objective quality or on club impact. I usually go for the latter.  EDIT: I badly wish these polls let you pick one substitute. I feel disucsted with myself that I haven't give nTatey a vote, but when he's competing with Williams, Monk and Rangel there's nowhere I can justify. He was our utility man all over the pitch and while he wasn't the best at any, his contribution to the club has been massive in my eyes."
swanseacity,3cb98y,Jamaicaman90,2,Mon Jul 6 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"They needed to specify what the actual criteria was. I went for the best players overall but that meant I had to leave out anyone who was great for us in the lower leagues. Trundle was our main man in league two and has done a lot for us, but I wouldn't say hes a better player than Bony."
swanseacity,3cb98y,MasonXD,3,Mon Jul 6 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"That means we've probably picked two very different teams, even though we probably have reasonably similar opinions."
swanseacity,3cb98y,Jamaicaman90,3,Mon Jul 6 22:04:22 2015 UTC,"I tried to value both equally. Monk still got in over Fernandez, but Trundle lost to Michu because of that one season."
swanseacity,3cb98y,MasonXD,2,Mon Jul 6 22:10:15 2015 UTC,"See, I had to go for Trundle over Michu because it was just one season. I also went for Doris over Fabs because even though he didn't leave on the best of terms, he did a lot for us getting from League One to the Premier League. That, I can still hear the echo of him bellowing at his defensive line to this day."
swanseacity,3cb98y,Jamaicaman90,2,Mon Jul 6 22:12:46 2015 UTC,"I gave it to Michu because of the trophy more than the season, first trophy is a pretty big deal. I wanted to choose De Vries but I apparently hold a grudge and couldn't let myself.   The choice of left back was tough but I chose Davies. The other area that I couldn't decide was the second centre mid after Britton but I settled on Siggy.   Its a really poorly designed survey, we currently have Sinclair winning both of the winger votes."
swanseacity,3cb98y,MasonXD,3,Mon Jul 6 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"we currently have Sinclair winning both of the winger votes.   I think the multiple positions are actually the same vote, but you get to cast two.   I gave it to Michu because of the trophy more than the season, first trophy is a pretty big deal.   Never forget."
swanseacity,3cb98y,Jamaicaman90,2,Mon Jul 6 22:41:05 2015 UTC,"I think the multiple positions are actually the same vote, but you get to cast two.   That was what I thought but the numbers are different on each. I think Butler deserves more than a single vote but I couldn't justify it."

swanseacity,3caxic,AlexSilvaGavan,3,Mon Jul 6 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"A next-to-nothing deal for him would be great if his wages aren't crazy. It'd be nice to have depth, and La Liga is valuable experience."
swanseacity,3caxic,papajuevos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"This would be a great move. He'd comfortably slot in at 4th choice centre back and on his day could challenge for 3rd. but I am basing this on his 2014 season, I don't think I watched more than 2 or 3 Bilbao games last season and he didn't catch my eye in any of them. The article did mention a struggle last season so that might have something to do with it.   I could see a defender leaving if we go in for him though and I just hope it isn't Fernandez, Amat or Williams."

If Britton's whereabouts don't end up being as much of a consideration, I'd like to invite you to check out Portland Timbers.

swanseacity,3c9078,cwmdulais,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"Not great options for MLS in SC. Orlando, DC, or Atlanta (entering the league in 2017) may be closest. I'd feel more comfortable encouraging support of DC now that Eddie Johnson is retiring due to medical reasons. I don't know what to expect from Atlanta. Orlando's fans aren't making a great impression so far. They show up in numbers but are getting a reputation for hooliganism. The major knocks against NYRB are being owned and branded by an energy drink company, not being the New York Cosmos, and having their stadium in New Jersey. Sacking their manager before this season seemed like bad form but they continue to perform well enough.   I'm hoping Britton doesn't end up with an MLS side I really dislike - Seattle, Dallas, or San Jose maybe. If we didn't have a good central mid pairing already I'd like to see him here.   Timbers supporters are all over so you might be able to find a good group to watch games with at least:  https://timbersarmy.org/aboutus/ta-worldwide  I just found out about @LondonTimbers last night. :-)"
swanseacity,3c9078,ClayKavalier,2,Wed Jul 8 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a Swansea veteran going abroad and if he wants to he could run that midfield for a few years yet which is something he couldn't do here anymore. Good luck to him if he leaves, he deserves first team football somewhere if he can't get it here and he'd be valued much more in MLS than he would by dropping to the championship I think."
swanseacity,3c8i6i,severedfragile,9,Sun Jul 5 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"Ash leaving is a laughable idea, he's the heart of this team. I do feel like Jonjo or Ki could leave though. I wouldn't be happy with less that  £15 million for Ki and £20 million for Jonjo (English player tax haha)  If we hold onto everyone that would be an incredible victory for Huw and co."
swanseacity,3c8i6i,Humanatee69,6,Mon Jul 6 05:15:05 2015 UTC,"No way we'd get £20m for Jonjo, much as I love him. Could see him going for ~12m."
swanseacity,3c8i6i,JamesOCocaine,5,Mon Jul 6 12:42:31 2015 UTC,"To risky and not enough caps, though I do think he deserves them more than some. 12m for jonjo seems right. The £5million for Ki, and £8 million for jonjo that have been in the press are ridiculous"
swanseacity,3c8i6i,Semper_nemo13,4,Mon Jul 6 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"I agree it is a ludicrous fee for Jonjo, but given the rate that English players have been going I could see us pushing. Remember that English Championship talents are being valued at £12m (Troy Deeney, Will Hughes, Jordan Rhodes) and talented English wingers like Lallana for £31m.   So as crazy as it seems, £20m isn't too farfetched for a capped English midfielder who is a proven Premier League threat. It is a high price, but we have no 'need' to sell Jonjo. I wouldn't be happy selling unless we get one hell of an offer."
swanseacity,3c8i6i,Humanatee69,5,Mon Jul 6 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"I've still got the feeling someone will leave.   If no one leaves, Huw and our front office did a hell of a job because you know there are teams poking around."
swanseacity,3c8i6i,Swanseaa,6,Sun Jul 5 22:14:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'm very worried either Ki or Shelvey may leave but if we can hold on to everyone then mission well and truly accomplished."

swanseacity,3c8i6i,Semper_nemo13,3,Mon Jul 6 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"I don't see any of our players pushing for the move but we'd accept £20m for either Shelvey Or Ki without too much thought. You are right though, especially after the season we just had and our chance to get Europe next season."
swanseacity,3c465k,jimmithy,4,Sat Jul 4 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"I know but you put me on camera, I just started talking   Most Neil Taylor Quote ever."
swanseacity,3c1w8g,AlexSilvaGavan,4,Sat Jul 4 00:14:20 2015 UTC,I think this was the right choice in the end. He really wasn't that prolific in Holland with 10 goals in 26 appearances. Bony had 31 goals in 30 games. That is the level of quality we should be looking for.   Additionally he isn't strong enough in my opinion to be the target man in our possession system. I'm much happier with Eder who has a similar goal scoring record in a better league and is a much more formidable player physically.
swanseacity,3c1w8g,Humanatee69,3,Sat Jul 4 01:18:04 2015 UTC,I think we aren't bluffing and are done unless Shelvey or Ki leave. Though are RB might be needed.

swanseacity,3bzzww,genteelblackhole,6,Fri Jul 3 15:07:51 2015 UTC,Excellent to see the lads out and about with the ball at their feet again!
swanseacity,3bsxhl,Jamaicaman90,7,Wed Jul 1 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in what people think of this as well.  I think we'll have two formations: the diamond and our standard 4-2-3-1. For the diamond, I think it'll be Tabanou primarily starting in the back, because it is a more defensive formation and we need to make the most of our chances.  I think we'll start the year primarily using the 4-2-3-1, with Taylor starting at LB. He knows our system well and that's why he gets the nod.  By the middle of the year I think we'll see Ayew and Tabanou consistently starting together on the left (or Ayew near the top in the diamond).   With the moves we've made we have solidified ourself in the ""next-best"" portion of the table, and I don't think there's any reason to believe we can't reach Europe if we stay healthy and our signings come off as intended.  Of course, that's a huge if, and we'll have to prove it on the field, but I love what we've done this summer. Éder is a huge question mark, and I'd still like to bring a ST in on loan.   That's probably my biggest worry going into the season — our strike force. Bafé is slowly winning me over, but what if he has a run of bad form to start the season?"
swanseacity,3bsxhl,Swanseaa,3,Wed Jul 1 22:33:35 2015 UTC,I think we use both the diamond and 433 formations quite a lot depending on the opposition. This how I see our strongest lineups at the moment.  http://imgur.com/a/oaRim  I've gone with Taylor rather than Tabanou as we yet to see how he fits in.
swanseacity,3bsxhl,jrodjonny,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:48:12 2015 UTC,The pace on the wings of the 4-3-3 should certainly be interesting. It's exciting to think about how strong we can be both narrow and wide in style.
swanseacity,3bsxhl,Swanseaa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting to see what we do on the wings. I'm not sure Ayew has ever played on the right (but I'm sure he could adapt), and I'm not sure that Montero could be counted on as a starter.  I think I'd prefer Montero on the right (he's right footed, and he's played there before).   Honestly, I love having these multi-talented guys that can play on either side. We can play matchups — Ayew can cut in against guys that favor playing wide, Montero can blaze past slower defenders.  A lot for opposing teams to look out for."
swanseacity,3bsxhl,Semper_nemo13,2,Thu Jul 2 19:27:28 2015 UTC,I want him to be a starter so badly though. He just torches teams.
swanseacity,3bsxhl,onheartattackandvine,2,Fri Jul 3 10:48:05 2015 UTC,"For me it's a great transfer window. Our team insofar has already shown that it belongs it the top ten. New signings is one thing, but no one have left except for Bony, which contributed greatly of course. Gomis showed, on the other hand, that he has the potential to do good in the premier league and I don't think the trend will stop. Having Eder, which might  not be a spectacular signing, will be much better than the top-portugal-league-circlejerk's opinon.   Tabanou which I've gathered is best at offensive duties will start against teams we are believed to win against, but Taylor will start against stronger opposition. The Ayew signing has strengthened us on all fronts offensively, the growth of Grimes. Fulton, and  Barrow might be a strength coming next season, and the whole team's solidifying properties is what makes me believe we'll stand our ground coming next season.   I expect someone to leave still, although I'm hoping not. The rumours going around about us signing a midfielder with experience tells that there's a possibility of us losing one. But the core remains, and the core is what got us here.   The point being, there's not much restructuring in team in the team so far, and I think that'll be one of our strengths going in to the new season. The solidity and team spirit will remain, and the new signings will fit right in to the existent team, whilst others may try to hard to change everything."
swanseacity,3bsxhl,Semper_nemo13,2,Thu Jul 2 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"Well as of right now, we need a RB, so I am praying Naughton doesn't get hurt again. Myler tackle still fucking despicable"
swanseacity,3bsxhl,MasonXD,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:15:35 2015 UTC,I think we would all love to close it here. I don't see us making anyone that will significantly improve us and I can see us losing someone important.
swanseacity,3bsxhl,BlazeMasterFunk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like the connection between Ayew and Gomis is going unrecognized. I think Ayew was brought in to give Gomis more confidence and i believe it'll work. I see Gomis up top with Eder, (I know it sounds crazy but Monk's a crazy guy) Montero and Ayew on wings, Gylfi top of the diamond and Cork on the defensive(though I prefer Jonjo). I don't know much about Tabanou but I think we'll start the season with the same four from last year until Monk feels Tabanou and Naughton are definite starters. And as for the diamond I've suggested, I think we will start the season with it but still play our one striker system on most days"
swanseacity,3br2c2,Swan_Z,8,Wed Jul 1 13:39:06 2015 UTC,Hope he overcomes the hate he's getting. Would be good to see him do well. We just need one more striker and I think we might be done.
swanseacity,3br2c2,nnn2,2,Wed Jul 1 13:46:30 2015 UTC,We'll probably stick with these for the time being then come winter transfer we'll probably get someone on loan. I think we need a 3rd choice keeper and no one to leave and we've got a solid squad with a lot of competition
swanseacity,3br2c2,nnn2,3,Wed Jul 1 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"Plus Barrow , Emnes and possibly Routledge could also play a striker role. I think we are getting this Barcelona lad as 3rd choice."
swanseacity,3br2c2,DeFunktRhodz,5,Wed Jul 1 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"Didn't realise someone posted it.   Theres a lot of negativity floating around him but I think its a decent signing. He has a decent track record and seems like a reasonable sub. Our kind of signing, safe and cheap.   Much rather this then cashing out on Oliveira or possibly gambling on another new striker when we've not really given Gomis a full season"
swanseacity,3br2c2,DeFunktRhodz,4,Wed Jul 1 13:42:15 2015 UTC,I think he'll surprise a few people this season come January

swanseacity,3br2c2,MyHatGandhi,5,Wed Jul 1 15:13:49 2015 UTC,"Same as Bony.  There will be some fans that will be ready to crucify after one game. Or two. Or three. Or a couple months.   We just need to be patient. I probably won't, but I should."
swanseacity,3br2c2,luisduarte35,4,Wed Jul 1 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"At first when I saw all the negativity, I started to wonder whether this was a below average signing... even for a second place striker.  I've now watched a large number of clips of him on YouTube... I know it's only clips but still... it's more than I had previously seen of him. My opinion is the guy has really good potential and will fit well into the team. He's produced some magic moments of skill, appears quick, and has made some really good goal scoring opportunities, some went in, some missed, some saved by great goal keeping.  I am now very optimistic of Eder and will support him."
swanseacity,3br2c2,Semper_nemo13,3,Thu Jul 2 12:08:42 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if he'll keep the #17 ?
swanseacity,3br2c2,Semper_nemo13,3,Wed Jul 1 18:41:30 2015 UTC,Well number 9 will be freeing up and he's number 9 in the portugal squad right?

swanseacity,3br2c2,Semper_nemo13,2,Wed Jul 1 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"I've been interested in this guy from the first time we were linked to him. He's not the youngest, he's not the most prolific, he carries with him his own circlejerk subreddit (which I'm sure was considered by GM and Huw).  But our style needs that big, strong striker up front, and he fits that bill. He doesn't need to be a distributor; we've got the distributors behind him — and with Tabanou and Ayew coming in, we've got even more distributors on the outside as well.  I'm more interested in this guy and how he turns out than Ayew or Tabanou (two guys who I'm almost positive will fit)."
swanseacity,3br2c2,jmariorebelo,2,Wed Jul 1 14:03:09 2015 UTC,"It's good that more strikers are being bought, it means Ayew will get to stay out on the wing where he will be most effective."

Wales Online: http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-city-starlet-james-demetriou-9560205  Just silly to place bets on football matches when you're a professional footballer. Makes no sense.
swanseacity,3bmdk4,Semper_nemo13,12,Tue Jun 30 11:37:07 2015 UTC,Just for convenience if anything. You could either put Bayern Munich up in a fancy hotel or just let us play it and everyone can go home afterwards. It's a no brainer.
swanseacity,3bmdk4,genteelblackhole,9,Tue Jun 30 15:43:23 2015 UTC,I think a petition is in order.
swanseacity,3bjheb,AlexSilvaGavan,9,Mon Jun 29 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"I'd still prefer shelvey over this guy, shelvey will only get better"
swanseacity,3bjheb,Swan_Z,3,Tue Jun 30 00:24:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Doesn't make much football sense, but money talks. If we get this guy for 5 mil and sell Jonjo for 15-plus, that's money we can invest elsewhere (ie, other young players - possibly later on)."
swanseacity,3bjheb,Swanseaa,4,Tue Jun 30 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"If Jonjo's leaving, it better be at least £15 Mil."
swanseacity,3bjheb,miloheej,2,Tue Jun 30 01:07:23 2015 UTC,"I constantly have to remind myself that Jonjo is only 23.  That being said, I think 29-year old Cigarini won't be Shelvey's replacement - rather I think he'll replace Britton as a role player off the bench."
swanseacity,3bjheb,Lambchops_Legion,6,Wed Jul 1 14:42:12 2015 UTC,Dude had 10 yellow cards last year.   Reminds me of Jonjo... Guessing he could he be Jonjo's replacement?
swanseacity,3bjheb,Swanseaa,3,Mon Jun 29 19:13:57 2015 UTC,Definitely seems like more like Jonjo is leaving.
swanseacity,3bjheb,Semper_nemo13,7,Mon Jun 29 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"No other reason for us to be in for a 29-year-old midfielder, to be honest."
swanseacity,3bjheb,Swanseaa,5,Mon Jun 29 23:24:26 2015 UTC,Hopefully he will just come to add depth and experience as I personally think Jonjo is a huge asset/talent for us.
swanseacity,3bjheb,AFairGoat,2,Tue Jun 30 14:16:32 2015 UTC,This would be a quality signing. He's very creative in the midfield and can get the ball into Gomis or Eder to knock it home.
swanseacity,3bjheb,Cazeltherunner,5,Mon Jun 29 19:11:44 2015 UTC,Have you watched him in Serie A? What can you tell us uncultured folks about him?
swanseacity,3bjheb,camdev03,6,Mon Jun 29 22:12:29 2015 UTC,I've watched his highlights from the past couple of seasons and his strengths are finding people in the box or playing good one two passes to score.
swanseacity,3bezv7,AlexSilvaGavan,12,Sun Jun 28 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"The FA is convinced that Swansea don't belong in the PL. See: Atrocious Refereeing, see the year, YEAR that no PK was awarded. Borre will go to Spain for less money for his parent club."
swanseacity,3bezv7,Semper_nemo13,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:10:11 2015 UTC,Isn't it just because Bertrand has a bigger international profile?
swanseacity,3bezv7,MasonXD,5,Sun Jun 28 19:41:12 2015 UTC,"Which is because he is from such a low ranked nation, hence why he went to the special council. It is significantly harder to get play time up front for Colombia, currently ranked fourth in the world, which is supposed to be taken into consideration."
swanseacity,3bena3,jimmithy,8,Sun Jun 28 14:59:12 2015 UTC,Gomis playing the welcome buddy there
swanseacity,3bena3,RedFlagToYou,3,Sun Jun 28 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"Why are the training outfits not the second choice kits, that is almost as perfect as you can get with the sponsor logo!"
swanseacity,3bena3,Semper_nemo13,3,Sun Jun 28 16:28:30 2015 UTC,"I've been saying for a while that I think an all black away kit would look amazing. With the logo in white so it's all black and white, kind of like the opposite of Frankfurt's away kit."
swanseacity,3bena3,genteelblackhole,3,Mon Jun 29 14:01:45 2015 UTC,It is just so clean looking
swanseacity,3bena3,Semper_nemo13,3,Mon Jun 29 17:16:37 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, it feels so good to see everyone back! It's been too long!"
swanseacity,3bbm2h,AlexSilvaGavan,5,Sat Jun 27 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting coincidence, on topic of the Play off final, I stopped someone from throwing:  http://gyazo.com/863a06145abceeda2dff35af0490c8a7  that away at the dump in Llansamlet today."
swanseacity,3bbm2h,SlutMcFuckNut,2,Sat Jun 27 23:01:20 2015 UTC,Good stuff.
swanseacity,3b7roy,severedfragile,8,Fri Jun 26 17:31:56 2015 UTC,"Can't say I'm particularly excited about this, still kind of had my heart set on Mitrovic or Ciftci to be honest.  My feelings about a striker aren't really improved when their highlight reels on youtube has one goal replayed 6 times,  and most of the video taken up with ""Near misses"" and saved chances.  I don't know, I trust Gary's judgement, we'll have to see I guess."
swanseacity,3b7roy,SlutMcFuckNut,5,Fri Jun 26 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"He'll be back up for Gomis, these days £5m is considered a cheap signing for Premier League sides. He seems like he is in the same mold as Bafe so I can see why Monk would be interested in him."
swanseacity,3b7roy,jrodjonny,2,Sat Jun 27 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, everyone on r/soccer seems to think 5m is 15m"
swanseacity,3b7roy,MasonXD,5,Sun Jun 28 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"Not prolific, but potential and under the right people might develop. Braga don't exactly have the best players around to give him assists, and hard to find goal with out Nani or Ronolodo on your shirt for Portugal these days. And that was a pretty good strike against Italy a few weeks ago.   Trying to be as positive as I can be."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Semper_nemo13,7,Fri Jun 26 23:54:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting to say the least.   Is he expecting first-team minutes? What's his wage?   Needless to say, this seems like our kind of signing. No talk about it until today, then it happens."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Swanseaa,8,Fri Jun 26 18:00:06 2015 UTC,Business really swiftly this year. Just a RB if Jazz leaves left on the table? Possibly loan striker?
swanseacity,3b7roy,Semper_nemo13,9,Fri Jun 26 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"That's the only two left for me, and honestly, a loan at each position would satisfy me.  I'm still pessimistic about who will leave, though. I think someone will get bought."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Swanseaa,5,Fri Jun 26 18:13:50 2015 UTC,"It has to be one of: Shelvey, Ki, or Gylfi, right? We never go a season with a least one top player poached. Maybe Fernandez tries to get back in Argentina by going to a top 4 club in some league on the continent? Maybe someone just blows away an offer for Montero?"
swanseacity,3b7roy,Semper_nemo13,7,Fri Jun 26 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"I think if one HAS to be sold, it has to be Shelvey. I'm OK with a starting midfield of Cork-Ki-Gylfi."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Lambchops_Legion,5,Fri Jun 26 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"Shelvey would be the most expensive with the English Player Tax, Ki is probably the most marketable for a big club. I think Gylfi stays.  I think Fernandez is the most likely to leave, though. He's wanted in Spain, wanted in Italy, and we still have Amat as cover, so I could see us tempted by an offer over 10mil.   Wouldn't shock me if Montero/ Fabianski left, either, although I think it's far less likely than the previous few. Both had breakout years with us.  Also could see Taylor leave now that we have Tabanou, could see Britton going to the MLS. A lot of ""potentials"" out there."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Swanseaa,3,Fri Jun 26 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"Tays signed the new deal and said he wanted to stay in Wales, could be a bit of a Bony Situation to drive the price higher, but I think he stays for the next year at least. Fabs probably won't leave just yet having been the number 2 at a big club for so long and now finally being the true #1. Who are a Champions League team looking for a GK? only ManU really and they wouldn't buy him.   If Britton went to Sounders, Timbers, or Real Salt Lake, I'd go to some MLS games for once, that'd be exciting at least. But I think that was just his agent throwing it out there. Gutted if he leaves though, I think since he came back after Sousa forced him out I saw him retiring a Jack and transitioning into coaching here.  Shelvey has the most incentive to leave, you can't tell me he wouldn't be better for England than Wilshire and he'll never get the call up from the SA1."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Semper_nemo13,5,Fri Jun 26 18:42:25 2015 UTC,"That's true about Taylor, and I've always thought he performed better with competition (ie, Ben Davies).   I think Fabianski wouldn't mind a move to the Bundesliga, but you're right, he's not going anywhere to be second-fiddle.   With the rumors that Britton (and Rangel?) are doing coaching classes, I (really) hope that they stay and join the coaching staff. I see them as Jacks for life."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Swanseaa,5,Fri Jun 26 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"Rangel has deep roots in Swansea, he married a girl from here, became a citizen, and as said (like Monk) he considers his children Welsh."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Semper_nemo13,3,Fri Jun 26 18:54:34 2015 UTC,and Ashley Williams!
swanseacity,3b7roy,Lambchops_Legion,8,Fri Jun 26 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"Also, €7 mil = £4.97 mil. I'd say that may be worth the punt."
swanseacity,3b7roy,Swanseaa,6,Fri Jun 26 18:42:26 2015 UTC,Sounds like good competition for Bafe.
swanseacity,3b7roy,jrodjonny,5,Fri Jun 26 20:31:30 2015 UTC,Great comment here explaining the fiction and reality of Eder: http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2kg9cl/amazing_counter_by_braga_against_benfica_last/cll571y
swanseacity,3b7roy,Humanatee69,4,Sat Jun 27 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago I literally was thinking that Eder would make a good signing, but decided to keep it to myself because I'm not the best elevator of foreign talent and how much they would cost. I would be really happy if this rumor turned out to be true."
swanseacity,3b7roy,HighOnWinning,3,Fri Jun 26 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"I just found out that John Guidetti's contract up and he's going to be a free agent. Doubt it's going to happen but do you guys think he would be able to play in the premier league? Scored 20 in 23 for Feyenoord, Bony scored 31 in 30 in the same league."
swanseacity,3b7roy,NYSWANS,2,Mon Jun 29 02:26:40 2015 UTC,Would be a solid free agent though as back up.  He was a Man City wasn't he?
swanseacity,3b7roy,bme500,2,Mon Jun 29 10:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, constantly loaned out, most recently to Celtic"
swanseacity,3b840c,Humanatee69,3,Fri Jun 26 19:00:09 2015 UTC,One of those players I know almost nothing about apart from him being good on Fifa. I guess he would be seen as a Britton replacement?
swanseacity,3b840c,MasonXD,2,Sat Jun 27 08:21:17 2015 UTC,The new Pirlo? He is 29...
swanseacity,3b840c,ole85,2,Sat Jun 27 14:00:12 2015 UTC,"But Pirlo is 36, he's got 7 years to reach the level of Pirlo, that's how it works right?"
swanseacity,3b840c,Cant-Find-Username,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:03:14 2015 UTC,I'm sure we were linked with him last summer.
swanseacity,3b6g20,AlexSilvaGavan,5,Fri Jun 26 10:26:40 2015 UTC,"I hope this goes through, right in the price range. And some one is talented and can grow. Absolutely chuffed if this comes off."
swanseacity,3b6g20,Semper_nemo13,6,Fri Jun 26 10:55:04 2015 UTC,Isn't the joke between Portugal National team fans is that he never scores?
swanseacity,3b6g20,jimmithy,4,Fri Jun 26 12:51:13 2015 UTC,"18 appearances, one goal (which was nine days ago).  Seeing the reaction comments, yeah, your statement seems accurate."
swanseacity,3b6g20,Swanseaa,5,Fri Jun 26 13:48:08 2015 UTC,The guy has his own circlejerk subreddit: /r/eder  :/
swanseacity,3b6g20,jimmithy,3,Fri Jun 26 13:54:35 2015 UTC,To be fair that mostly seems to be one guy.
swanseacity,3b6g20,Semper_nemo13,2,Fri Jun 26 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"Right now, this transfer seems more likely than any other striker we've been linked to this window"
swanseacity,3b5cmf,Semper_nemo13,12,Fri Jun 26 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"This is nonsense. I could understand if it was a team above us, but it's Crystal Palace and they want our captain. Will never happen, it would be a downgrade for him and a pretty pointless move.   Where does The Mirror get these things? They probably just saw a FIFA career mode screenshot during the transfer window and thought the articles were real."
swanseacity,3b5cmf,Cant-Find-Username,7,Fri Jun 26 05:32:19 2015 UTC,In other news Messi and Ronaldo want to come to Swansea on Free Transfers and are going to donate all their wages back to the club.
swanseacity,3b5cmf,bme500,3,Fri Jun 26 11:04:19 2015 UTC,I find these humorous.
swanseacity,3b5cmf,moomilkmon,3,Fri Jun 26 06:36:43 2015 UTC,When Williams signed his last contract with us and after last years speculation of Arsenal wanting him didn't he make it clear that he would retire at Swansea? I wonder who makes up this kind of b.s.
swanseacity,3b5cmf,MasonXD,3,Fri Jun 26 10:17:14 2015 UTC,Captain of the top club and the nation of Wales for the foreseeable future.

swanseacity,3ayz2e,TweetPoster,2,Wed Jun 24 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"I just rented the movie last night and I really gained an appreciation for the history of the club. Only having supported the club for the past couple years I never knew all of the key players (and supporters) that attributed to the rise to the premiership. As I was researching -- yes I researched -- which EPL team I wanted to support when NBC bought the rights to broadcast every game in the States I liked how the Swans were partly owned by the city. They were the exact opposite of teams like ManU, ManCity, or the Yankees in MLB. I'm going to recommend the film to my buddies since even the story itself is entertaining in the least. Hopefully I'll gain some new Jacks to watch the games at 10 am on Saturday mornings EST."
swanseacity,3auav2,Gadarat,8,Tue Jun 23 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say sign a good striker, loan a serviceable striker, and look into either bringing in an additional player for right back or deciding we're sticking with Jazz for cover (Rangel is also there but I don't know if I'd be comfortable with him being the only cover in that position).  Britton may leave, but we've still got Tabanou who can fill in for Cork, as can Ki. We've also got Jay Fulton who I think might make a further push towards the first team, with more cup appearances at least, in that position.  I think we're set for centre backs, wingers and central/attacking midfielders. Assuming no more sales, I think we only really need to buy one and loan one to have a good, reasonably deep squad. I've no doubt we'll be stretched thin at some point during the season but we've got limits on how many players we can realistically have, and I like what I see currently."
swanseacity,3auav2,Jamaicaman90,5,Tue Jun 23 16:01:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be opposed if we loaned out Jay Fulton for the year and bought Tom Carroll.
swanseacity,3auav2,Lambchops_Legion,3,Tue Jun 23 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"I'd really prefer to keep Jazz... I understand his desire for first team football, but we could use the cover. I'd say a half season loan with an agreeable championship side, with the option to recall if need be."
swanseacity,3auav2,Semper_nemo13,2,Tue Jun 23 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"Altering seeing how well Jazz played for Wales, I am conflicted about selling him. I do think he needs first team football, but I don't want to him to go :("
swanseacity,3auav2,camdev03,5,Tue Jun 23 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"I would honestly be satisfied if we took a punt on one of these promising Championship strikers that we are linked with week in and week out or brought back Nelson. If we could make an affordable signing that we could maybe just get 7-10 goals out of, I wouldn't be too disappointed. I think the people that are saying that we need at least two more strikers are underselling Emnes. He might not be the prolific target man that our 4-2-3-1 calls for, but he's been proficient enough for a third choice striker. In the bit part role that he's been given in the league, he's scored one goal and drawn three penalties that resulted in goals. Not to mention last season in the League Cup, the beautiful finish against Everton and he put us up 1-0 against Liverpool, in a game that, if not for some awful officiating, could have been memorable. Also, we need at least 2 players with those dreads on the roster at all times."
swanseacity,3auav2,Swanseaa,4,Wed Jun 24 01:45:08 2015 UTC,"My dream:  We finish the window signing Mitrovic and bringing Oliveira back on loan. Think Gomis would start at the beginning of the season, but Mitrovic would earn a spot in the starting XI by December, at which point we'd sell Gomis and pick up Luc Castaignos for < £4.   Unfortunately (and probably the thrift way to go about it), I don't think we'll shell out the cash for Mitrovic unless we sell someone like Jonjo.   We definitely need at least one more striker on the books, and preferably a loan striker (Oliveira) as well before the season starts. Wouldn't be all that confident in starting the season with just Gomis and Oliveira up top."
swanseacity,3auav2,Semper_nemo13,3,Tue Jun 23 17:14:44 2015 UTC,How do you feel about Kenji if the rumors aren't true and Nelson Oliveria isn't coming back--I think we are at the point with him where we need to see if he can play in the first team.
swanseacity,3auav2,Swanseaa,6,Tue Jun 23 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"Really hoping we see him in our summer games.   I think he deserves a look, but I'd prefer him being our third choice ST at the start of the season rather than our second."
swanseacity,3auav2,Semper_nemo13,3,Tue Jun 23 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, we need a second striker for cover for Gomis, And worst case seems to be the Triumvirate of Olivera/Gorre/Barrow who did play 9 in the youth squad. That is both very exciting, and terrifying."
swanseacity,3auav2,Swanseaa,4,Tue Jun 23 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  I'm very happy we have a youth squad we can rely on. I honestly think Gorré, Barrow and Oliveira could all hold their own in the Prem for us. They're not top half of the table good (at least not yet), but I think they'd keep us afloat — and I think they'd be fun to watch."
swanseacity,3auav2,dat_bird,2,Tue Jun 23 19:07:32 2015 UTC,Cannot understand why you would want Olivera back.. Looked pretty miserable and scored a couple clumsy goals. We need to invest in in good striker who is at the very least on par with Gomis
swanseacity,3auav2,Swanseaa,3,Wed Jun 24 20:46:58 2015 UTC,"I'd want Oliveira on loan as a third option, not second.  I think Oliveira tried hard, he really seemed to enjoy being with us and I never heard of him being a poor teammate in the clubhouse.  He had 10 league appearances for us — hardly enough to get his footing. Bony and Gomis didn't look all that great after 10 games, either."
swanseacity,3auav2,NYSWANS,9,Wed Jun 24 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"Avoid Mitrovic, bring in someone a striker under 10 million. Let go players like Richards, Britton, Dyer if the price is right"
swanseacity,3auav2,WallStar206,6,Tue Jun 23 18:12:28 2015 UTC,Why would you avoid Mitrovic. He has the potential to be an elite striker
swanseacity,3auav2,NYSWANS,3,Tue Jun 23 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"I kind of like him, but I agree that I'd rather not see us buy him.   He's young. Obviously, lots of room to grow, but we're also paying for that potential with no guaranteed return. His proposed cost. If we're not selling, than this is all out of pocket. Not to say that we can't afford it, but we're talking about 2/3 of our Bony money for just one player. His attitude. I've heard conflicting accounts, but, as we've all seen, the locker room can have a serious effect of results.  The minutes. He wants to be at the top, and he's not going to get there by sitting on the bench. While I admire ambition, Gomis has made it clear that he did not come here to play second string either. And even with a two striker system, they then face competition from Ayew and all our wingers.   If we do choose to get him, I would applaud our ambition. However, Monk would have some serious man management work cut out for him."
swanseacity,3auav2,Semper_nemo13,2,Tue Jun 23 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"He has the reputation of having a bad attitude, and bringing in someone that hyped up, in my opinion, A) is not the Swansea way and B) can bring in high expectations that might not be met. I would rather Monk go with a cheaper signing to compete with Bafe, not overtake him."
swanseacity,3auav2,NYSWANS,3,Thu Jun 25 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Britts, and to a lesser extent dyer are legends and need to be taken care of. I would like to see Britts transition to coaching if he doesn't take on a new challenge."
swanseacity,3auav2,Semper_nemo13,2,Wed Jun 24 05:53:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that they deserve something more, but for the better of the team they won't receive the play time they always have. This is a club moving forward, and in order to move forward we must thank them for all that they've done and move on. It should be up to them to either leave the club, retire, or stay in the squad with limited playtime and help the younger players develop into European Cup level players."
swanseacity,3auav2,NYSWANS,2,Thu Jun 25 21:37:18 2015 UTC,"You don't just cut ties to players that have put in so much service, if they decide to leave that is fine, but it is heartless to actively try to sell them and force them out of the squad. Football isn't like American Sports, particularly at clubs like Swansea and Britts in particular can't just be discarded."
swanseacity,3auav2,electricsheepandroid,2,Thu Jun 25 21:42:07 2015 UTC,"Like I said, they don't have to cut ties with him, but he shouldn't be getting more playtime than others if they can do a better job for the squad. Britton of all people should understand that as he has dedicated so much to the club himself."
swanseacity,3auahh,Jamaicaman90,2,Tue Jun 23 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"This is definitely one of the more interesting first interviews that I've seen. Remember, this is a Swedish international with plenty of match experience behind him, he's no kid looking to get a break. He explicitly states that he has joined because it's Swansea, not because it's a Premier League club, which I think says a lot about where we currently are.  Usually, the line is that the Premier League is a great league and Swansea are a great way to get involved - we aren't written off as irrelevant but the league we're in appears to be the main draw. It's exciting to see we have pulling power of this kind on our own, and the reputation of Monk, his team and our facilities have obviously gone through the roof within the football world."
swanseacity,3atlkq,AlexSilvaGavan,6,Tue Jun 23 12:12:50 2015 UTC,Stick him on ebay
swanseacity,3atlkq,Ferrisuk,6,Tue Jun 23 16:23:51 2015 UTC,Can you imagine reading this two years ago?
swanseacity,3atlkq,Seven-Force,5,Tue Jun 23 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"Does anyone think we can get £4 million for him though? I think we'd be lucky to get two. Considering that is what we bought him for, the injuries, and the success he had, that would be great business."
swanseacity,3atlkq,Semper_nemo13,9,Tue Jun 23 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"Anything we get seems almost like free money to me, because I assumed we would let him go on a free."
swanseacity,3atlkq,Jamaicaman90,2,Tue Jun 23 15:22:59 2015 UTC,Why can't we keep him around for a Gomis backup? Is he poor for the locker room?
swanseacity,3atlkq,BlazeMasterFunk,5,Wed Jun 24 05:36:43 2015 UTC,"It's really sad to see a story like his as I really liked him but to even have him in the squad would be a wasted spot, especially with the goals we are aiming to achieve next season. I would much rather hae another oliviera, upcoming striker, or a promising youngster take that slot in the squad. Best outcome: somthing in the welsh water 100% fixs his injuries and he finds his amazing form again."

Here's Krisoffer Nordfeldt profile, more reaction to his move to Swansea next pic.twitter.com [Imgur]     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
swanseacity,3aqh0k,Swanseaa,7,Mon Jun 22 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"With the Ki rumors dying down, and the signings we've made, it does look like we will push hard for Europe this year. And why not? A little bit better officiating last year and we would've made it."
swanseacity,3aqh0k,Semper_nemo13,2,Mon Jun 22 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"At this point, as long as we add another striker and backup GK, I think we could make that push.   But we're going to lose someone, right? Whether it's Ki or Fernandez, It feels (unfortunately) inevitable to me.   If we finish 8th and keep our entire starting XI, I'd be shocked."
swanseacity,3aqh0k,Semper_nemo13,3,Mon Jun 22 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"I do think Arsenal are looking for other CMs, Fernandez doesn't seem near as big of a loss to me because of Jordi Amat, and Kyle Bartley playing so well. Painful, but damage that could be accounted for.   What scares me is Shelvey leaving, I think that has the most legs right now.   I am fully confident a backup GK will sign in the next 3 weeks, and a Striker doesn't have to be splashy, a serviceable guy in the 5-6 million range that will train hard and can spell Gomis and the loan back of Olivera/or similar type with Ayew/Dyer as an emergency third choices, feels like that will get that accomplished."
swanseacity,3aqh0k,miloheej,3,Mon Jun 22 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And even having just Gomis/ Oliveira would be serviceable.  I'd sorely miss Jonjo — but he might be our most valuable player, being young and being English."
swanseacity,3aqh0k,Semper_nemo13,2,Mon Jun 22 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're losing anyone, there hasn't been any solid believable rumours."
swanseacity,3aqzly,AlexSilvaGavan,3,Mon Jun 22 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"Would love a Gorre loan to either of these clubs. We'd get to find out whether we've got a real PL striker on our hands.   That said there is no way he'll start at Leicester (Kramaric, Ulloa and Vardy are too good) and Defoe will likely keep him on the bench at Sunderland. I'd love to see a Championship loan for him next season."
swanseacity,3aqzly,Humanatee69,3,Tue Jun 23 01:56:41 2015 UTC,They are talking about transfer not loan I believe. We are being linked with a lot of U21 players as we have just signed a couple of scouts from Everton and Man Utd and focusing on bringing talent in at a young age and developing it. But I think this Gorre story is made up by his agent to negotiate a new contract for the kid.
swanseacity,3aqzly,Moonfireworks,3,Tue Jun 23 08:38:08 2015 UTC,"The Leicester interest is real, SWEP had a quote from their manager, but this does seem like a play for a better deal. No way we let the best youth player go on a 1-3 million pound deal, particularly without seeing if he can hack it with the senior squad. And when we are so week at the position he plays."
swanseacity,3aqzly,Semper_nemo13,3,Tue Jun 23 14:52:28 2015 UTC,I'm sure both interest is real but we all know the rules about registering interest with U21 players. Of course Congerton has massively extended Sunderland's scouting network and the new scouts signed are specific to Youth. He seems a very good prospect and more than likely the agent help publicise this for pressure. I'd be surprised if he left Swansea.
swanseacity,3aq3s3,MinnesotanJack19,4,Mon Jun 22 16:21:19 2015 UTC,"I'm from NYC, I was studying in Spain last fall and made the trip up to Wales to see Swansea play Crystal Palace at the Liberty. In terms of tickets for teams that aren't ""big teams"" the tickets aren't terribly expensive by any means. However, you need an account if you want tickets for games against the ""big teams."" They offer student tickets for £17.50. You're best bet for getting from London to Wales on the cheap is taking a National Express bus. If I recall, I paid £22 each way, but you can find cheaper. However, it is a 5 to 6 hour ride with a few stops along the way. If you're a student and will be poorer than poor, as I was, you'll wanna become familiar with hostelworld as well as AirBNB. If you intend on traveling a lot, finding cheap accommodation in each city will save you a lot of money in the long run."
swanseacity,3aq3s3,camdev03,2,Mon Jun 22 17:35:27 2015 UTC,You could also try Couch Surfing.  When I travelled OZ a few years back I rarely paid for accomodation if I was just in the area a day or two.  Then when I lived in Manchester in the city centre I hosted loads of people who came to watch City or United.  All they had to do was buy and cook dinner the night they were staying (this may be why I'm so fat now).
swanseacity,3aq3s3,bme500,3,Tue Jun 23 09:47:35 2015 UTC,"A home ticket is the same price no matter who is playing. Getting a ticket will be a challenge though, but possible. Tickets are around £35 ($55). I'm not really sure on the price of travel from London to Swansea, but a Greyhound bus or train would be the best option. I don't know the price of a Jack Army membership, but I don't think its more than £10 ($15). But You do get early access to Home and Away Tickets, so it's pretty good.  Anything else, let me know."
swanseacity,3aq3s3,xOMGaShoe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"Jack Army membership is just over £20 now I believe?  Cheapest way to get to Swansea from London would be on the Megabus too, book it early enough and you'll get it for under £10 each way. Don't even entertain the idea of our overpriced train fares!  As for tickets, as said all games are £35 EXCEPT category A games  (essentially, top 6 teams) which are £45."
swanseacity,3aq3s3,Bauza23,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"Just a note on the train fares... If you are doing a lot of travelling and value your time you should get a rail card, its an investment to begin with but then you get discounts on all your tickets from then using it."
swanseacity,3aq3s3,MasonXD,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:22:03 2015 UTC,I thought this too but the rail passes i saw seemed to be for semi limited ranges of times and i am hoping to go to several games in wales over my 4 month stay. any tips?
swanseacity,3aq3s3,xOMGaShoe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:30:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info! So I am thinking I’ll get the membership since its pretty reasonably priced, i will use the bus, and i have contacted the ticket office to ask about the student discount.  Do away game prices depend on the pricing used by the away team? I am not too interested in seeing a top 6 team so I won’t need to worry about the price increase.   Also are there Swansea supporter pubs in the London area  I could go to?"
swanseacity,3aprfj,Swanseaa,3,Mon Jun 22 14:43:45 2015 UTC,Seems like we're looking at two GKs:   http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33226578  Think I'd prefer Nordfeldt for his experience.

swanseacity,3ai76f,severedfragile,7,Sat Jun 20 12:32:07 2015 UTC,It's funny all the players we scout out and don't end up getting still end up being stars. Payet and Tadic specifically were both on our radars for ages we just couldn't finish the deals.   I feel like clubs are going to start poaching our scouts soon because so far they've been brilliant. Ayew and Tabanou both seem like absolute class signings as well.   I'm already happy with this summer. So long as we don't sell off players the squad looks even stronger than it was last year!
swanseacity,3ai76f,Humanatee69,4,Sat Jun 20 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"The graph of Taylor and Tabanou's touches is pretty surprising. Note how Tabanou was almost never touching the ball behind the 18, whereas Taylor has a clear spot where he did.   Obviously Tabanou is more attacking, now we have the statistics to back that up."
swanseacity,3ai76f,Swanseaa,4,Sat Jun 20 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"Taylor seems to cut more in, I wonder if that is a system thing or a player thing?"
swanseacity,3ai76f,Semper_nemo13,6,Sat Jun 20 15:48:01 2015 UTC,I think that's more him not being confident in making longer crosses with his left foot
swanseacity,3ai76f,Swanseaa,4,Sat Jun 20 15:50:17 2015 UTC,Even though a lot of those moves in our in our half? Neil ends up in the six yard box on our own side fairly often just marking his man
swanseacity,3ai76f,Semper_nemo13,5,Sat Jun 20 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should've said passes as well as crosses. I think Taylor just likes making shorter passes. Our system would benefit more if our full backs were wider — spreads the defense, clears passing lanes, etc."
swanseacity,3agbbp,cameron_0,13,Fri Jun 19 22:28:23 2015 UTC,I've criticised his England callups too much for this.

swanseacity,3agbbp,onheartattackandvine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:34:50 2015 UTC,"Too inconsistent. Sometimes it seems like he's a future star, then he's just an average winger. I'm sure he'll cost more for being English too."
swanseacity,3agbbp,Cant-Find-Username,5,Mon Jun 22 02:36:21 2015 UTC,I've read him plus 3 mil for Shelvey. What do we think of that?  I still feel Shelvey is worth more tbh.
swanseacity,3agbbp,Swanseaa,3,Sat Jun 20 15:49:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't do it personally
swanseacity,3agbbp,Cazeltherunner,3,Sat Jun 20 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"That is a shite deal, I hope someone else takes this problem away from us."
swanseacity,3agbbp,Semper_nemo13,3,Sat Jun 20 21:50:17 2015 UTC,"Really doubt it happens. I think Townsend is an upgrade over Dyer, but not that much."
swanseacity,3agbbp,Swanseaa,4,Sat Jun 20 22:17:50 2015 UTC,Fuck no.
swanseacity,3agbbp,severedfragile,3,Sat Jun 20 12:33:21 2015 UTC,"I would prefer him to being 3rd option over routledge and dyer any day. He is faster, stronger, better on his week, and better at finishing than both of them. All he lacks is crossing, but if he plays lw he is more than good enough.  He wont get realistic minutes with us unless ayew is moved into cam or there are injuries to montero/ayew"
swanseacity,3afta2,jimmithy,2,Fri Jun 19 20:02:43 2015 UTC,"This gets brought up every time, but I do really like the music under this."
swanseacity,3ae5rs,awenga21,10,Fri Jun 19 11:38:06 2015 UTC,"About dang time we replace Ben Davies on the roster.  Now we've got some great competition at LB. I personally see Tabanou starting, but Neil has shown he belongs on the field as well."
swanseacity,3ae5rs,Swanseaa,7,Fri Jun 19 12:24:26 2015 UTC,"I've yet to see Tabanou actually play, except for a goal he once scored. But we didn't buy him for the goals. From the different statistics it looks as if he overshadows Taylor in most offensive aspects, but is he better defensively? I don't really know.  Maybe the plan is, or might manifest itself later, is to play Tabanou against on paper weaker teams, while Taylor gets the job when it's against stronger opposition. Then again it can be that Tabanou just is a better option in general."
swanseacity,3ae5rs,onheartattackandvine,5,Fri Jun 19 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be fluid.   In our standard 4-2-3-1, I give Taylor the nod. Been with us, knows the system well.   But in the diamond, I think Tabanou starts. Easier for him to get up the flank than one of our mids.   Maybe Tabanou starts with Ayew on the left in our standard 4-2-3-1. They are familiar with each other.  Who knows? What is clear is that we've got loads of options, which makes us tougher to prepare for and helps us in terms of quality depth."
swanseacity,3ae5rs,Swanseaa,3,Fri Jun 19 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"Some of the guys in /r/soccer also say he makes a good DM if needed, which solves the Cork depth too."
swanseacity,3ae5rs,jimmithy,8,Fri Jun 19 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"Seems like GM likes the guys that can play multiple roles... Ayew, Tabanou, moved Routledge to each wing and up top last year; Shelvey in a F9 two years ago, back at CDM; Barrow, Emnes known for playing up top as well as on the wing.  Versatility never a bad thing."
swanseacity,3ae5rs,Swanseaa,3,Fri Jun 19 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"Neil has played very well for Wales and committed here long term, it seems like an open competition, which we needed.  Fullbacks have gone from a disaster 6 months ago: Aging Rangel, badly out of form Taylor, terribly inexperienced Jazz, to Kyle Naughton, Frank Tabanou, in form Taylor, just contained Eden Hazard for 90 mins Jazz, Jack legend hopefully transitioning into the coaching staff Rangel."
swanseacity,3ae5rs,Semper_nemo13,3,Fri Jun 19 16:48:10 2015 UTC,Love that Tabanou can play on the wing as well. Makes me think we could see him and Taylor in the starting XI a few times.
swanseacity,3ae5rs,Swanseaa,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:52:38 2015 UTC,Tabanou actually started as a left winger then got reconverted as a left back.

swanseacity,3abgzg,miloheej,6,Thu Jun 18 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"Well they wanted to pay boat loads of money for Schneiderlin, and are targeting Shelvey because they can't get him."
swanseacity,3abgzg,miloheej,7,Thu Jun 18 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"Schneiderlin's price is around 25 mil, right? I would expect somewhere around 15 to 20 mil for Shelvey at the moment. Maybe Carroll + 10 mil.   Yes, it is a lot of money, so that's why they should stay away."
swanseacity,3abgzg,miloheej,6,Thu Jun 18 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"That is more than I rated shelvey at so I hope you're right. And I do think if this happens Carroll will come back. I like him, kinda anonymous for England u21s today though."
swanseacity,3abgzg,HighOnWinning,4,Thu Jun 18 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't been too impressed with Carroll either, but everyone seems to rate him pretty highly (at least higher than I rate him). If you really think about it, the price could be justified for Shelvey - he's young, English, and the goals he score are just ridiculous."
swanseacity,3abgzg,camdev03,7,Thu Jun 18 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"I would be gutted if he left us. Without him we will still have a great trio in the midfield, Cork, Ki, and Siggy, but Shelvey is the most fun to watch in my opinion. He has amazing upside and can score anytime and anywhere on the pitch (and pick out a pass too). His biggest downside was his temper and aggression, but he seemed to dial that back a bit during the second half last season. I think it is worth waiting to see how he matures.  Hope this is only a rumor or they have to massively overpay."
swanseacity,3abgzg,cwmdulais,7,Thu Jun 18 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"I really rate Shelvey and Monk has really helped him calm down, he is a father now and got the England Cap, so that likely helped as well. I hope Spurs keep there hands off, but everyman has his price, and I can see Huw selling for a 8-12 million pounds. If it did happen I bet it will be the Davis/Vrom/Gylfi deal last season, where two rapid cash transactions that are really a Player swap with cash considerations take place, likely with Tom Carroll coming back. but that is just speculation."
swanseacity,3abgzg,Swanseaa,8,Thu Jun 18 20:34:59 2015 UTC,Tottenham oughta keep their grimy paws away. I'd cry like like a big bitch if Shelvey leaves and I'd throw a toddler-like temper tantrum if he leaves for Tottenham.
swanseacity,3abgzg,miloheej,6,Thu Jun 18 22:22:38 2015 UTC,Just checked the Spurs sub out and they seem to utterly hate the idea. I know that doesn't mean much in reality but i think it throws doubt on this move
swanseacity,3abgzg,nnn2,11,Fri Jun 19 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"I think I was one that called for Shelvey to be benched (or leave) back when he was really having a rough stretch of games in winter. We picked up Cork and I thought it was the end of Jonjo in Swansea.  But by golly he proved me wrong, and I love him because of it. He provides character to our team - and he might lose us some games, but he'll win some too. He's a competitor through and through."
swanseacity,3abgzg,DeFunktRhodz,6,Thu Jun 18 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"He is the type of player Americans call a ""Gunslinger,"" I think it is most type of player clubs need even if it sometimes burns them."

swanseacity,3abgzg,hipitywhopla,4,Fri Jun 19 01:11:32 2015 UTC,I'd be gutted if he went but I can't see it without a hefty fee or a player in return. Top quality player and still only 23. Would be completely wasted at spurs but it might revive his England career as woy loves a big club hype player (mason/cleverly/delph).
swanseacity,3aaaxm,jimmithy,5,Thu Jun 18 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"Huge signing, and I think this will help Taylor. He clearly improved with Naughton coming in and I think he will battle for playing time with Tabanou.   GM on a mission this summer."

We always play better with him compared to naughton/rangel."

Unfortunately, with Neil back in the fold, he doesn't have a spot in the team, and will never be polished without first team football. He played pretty well on that garbage fire Fulham squad. I want to see Jazz Loaned to a Championship team he will start on, that is best for Wales and his career, and doesn't end with us selling too low on someone I think can be a serviceable PL FB."

swanseacity,39n1l2,robg485,5,Sat Jun 13 16:26:48 2015 UTC,"This is the largest British order of chivalry, given to people who somehow severed the Empire, usually culturally with this one but there are always exceptions, there are 5 ranks the top there of which have a limited number of members that one can't be promoted to unless someone else dies, usually. The bottom two Member of the British Empire (MBE) and Order of the British Empire (OBE) have no max limit, but only a set amount are given out each year, on the Queen's Birthday.   Basically it is a large honor given to some one because of actions that the Monarch, but in practice a committee, gives out to people who have serviced the Empire. It is slightly uncommon for some one like Huw to get an OBE before first being made an MBE, but like all ranks it entitles the recipient to add the numerals to the end of their name. The top two ranks are knightly ranks, which are relatively rather limited entitle the recipient to use Sir/Dame before their name, if and only if, they are a subject of the crown. Americans are likely familiar with a few Knights of this order Paul McCartney, Judy Dench, Alex Ferguson. Interestingly Bill Gates because of his charity work is a Knight Commander of this order, but isn't a British Citizen or Crown Subject, so he is Bill Gates, KBE but not Sir Bill Gates."

swanseacity,39l317,MasonXD,5,Mon Jun 15 11:14:14 2015 UTC,Remy but his wages would cost too much.. Jordan Rhodes really impressed me this season and we've been linked a few times to him but would he really be able to keep that form up in the prem? We need a proven striker that doesn't mind playing second fiddle to Gomis so maybe like ciftci? If we do go in for someone I hope they are fairly young and can grown into the squad
swanseacity,39l317,Swan_Z,4,Mon Jun 15 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether Bafe is going to be used as the first choice striker. If he is, then a low-priced but reliable backup, like Borini. If not, then I'd like to see Remy or Rhodes come in, with Bas Dost and Batshuayi (not in the aforementioned list, but players we've been linked with in the past), or maybe even Jovetic."
swanseacity,39l317,ICanHazReddits,3,Fri Jun 12 22:27:15 2015 UTC,"I'd go in for Fabio Borini. He revealed today he wants to leave Liverpool, and I would have him back no questions asked. Would cost about the same as Remy or Ighalo, but worth it imo. Once a jack, always a jack."
swanseacity,39l317,AlexSilvaGavan,2,Fri Jun 12 23:32:29 2015 UTC,I like that idea too. I wonder why it hasn't been discussed? Does he not fit our system well or does his recent abysmal form scare us off?
swanseacity,39l317,AlexSilvaGavan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"You never really know who's been discussed but I think he would fit our system. He's versatile and that's great for us, with the 4-2-3-1 or the diamond. Form is temporary, we know what he's capable of."
swanseacity,39l317,MasonXD,3,Fri Jun 12 15:13:55 2015 UTC,On skill? Remy is the best there.   Factoring in cost? Ciftci is probably the best option.
swanseacity,39l317,MasonXD,3,Fri Jun 12 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"For some reason I don't love Çiftçi.  I don't think he's played against great competition and lacks creativity.  That being said, do you think bringing in a guy of Remy's caliber would throw Gomis? I almost think a guy like Çiftçi would be better for Gomis' confidence/mood.  Although, if Gomis went down, we'd be a whole lot of trouble."
swanseacity,39l317,tajestic,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"Remy would be a different kind of striker than we'd usually go for but I'd say he's better than Gomis. Huge wages would ruin that move though, and the last thing Gomis needs is to be dropped again."

swanseacity,39bkly,MasonXD,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:28:14 2015 UTC,I cannot wait to start singing this when he scores
swanseacity,39bkly,Swan_Z,12,Fri Jun 12 01:02:54 2015 UTC,How many guessed Ayew would be our first signing of the season? This is so great I'm getting giddy for the season to start!
swanseacity,39bkly,onheartattackandvine,4,Wed Jun 10 17:48:39 2015 UTC,He wasn't even an option in our poll!
swanseacity,39bkly,MasonXD,4,Wed Jun 10 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"I know! I remember the club approached him right after the season ended, but after seeing the other clubs interested I figured that was never going to happen. Thought of it as a parallel to Stoke bidding for Shaqiri earlier, you miss all the shots you don't take type of scenario. If Tabanou comes in I would be more than pleased with the transfer window already."
swanseacity,39bkly,onheartattackandvine,11,Wed Jun 10 21:47:38 2015 UTC,Get in!!! What an immense signing.

swanseacity,39bkly,Humanatee69,7,Wed Jun 10 19:21:00 2015 UTC,Absolutely mental signing. If we can get Tabanou aswell we've immediately addressed our most pressing needs and improved our team in the process.
swanseacity,39bkly,premature_eulogy,5,Wed Jun 10 17:44:57 2015 UTC,Fantastic news!  Hopefully we'll go for a striker or fullback next.
swanseacity,39bkly,jimmithy,6,Wed Jun 10 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"Thing is, *I believe* this guy can play as a striker comfortably.  Hell, he's almost perfect to be up top with Gomis when we play the midfield diamond."
swanseacity,39bkly,premature_eulogy,2,Wed Jun 10 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, didn't know that. Excellent!"
swanseacity,39bkly,AbideMan,2,Wed Jun 10 18:14:48 2015 UTC,"He can, but you would be better off not forcing that. You'll get the most out of him in his natural position. He can be indecisive at times when in the center."
swanseacity,39bkly,jrodjonny,2,Wed Jun 10 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Me too,  I'm thinking we might see him playing off Gomis in the diamond formation."
swanseacity,39bkly,AlexSilvaGavan,6,Wed Jun 10 20:40:12 2015 UTC,Great signing. Next season will be better again with transfer business like this. Delighted
swanseacity,39bkly,moomilkmon,3,Wed Jun 10 17:41:28 2015 UTC,Best thing to see when you look up from your pint when your mate has gone to the toilet. Need to now get another round in for celebration!

swanseacity,39bkly,severedfragile,2,Wed Jun 10 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"We apparently offered terms to him a few months ago, getting in early and guaranteeing play-time would have helped the deal get done. For the people criticising us for not spunking away the Bony money right away, this is a great example of the plan coming together. Excellent signing, good enough to raise our standards across our attack and young enough so if we have to sell him we can make some good money. Really happy we got this one done, now on to Maxim/Castaignos and Schlupp."
swanseacity,39bkly,BlazeMasterFunk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"What about Remy? Is that a serious possibility? If we got Remy, Tabenou, AND Ayew. We would have all concern positions covered and we would be golden for next season"
swanseacity,39bkly,sammyedwards,2,Wed Jun 10 23:31:57 2015 UTC,Chelsea will let Remy go only if they buy a couple of strikers. Mourinho likes to have 3 strikers in his squad.

swanseacity,39bkly,throttlebottles,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"I can't see Ibra moving to Chelsea, but Falcao on the other hand is heavily linked to them. But at this point, I'm just crossing my fingers; remy would be a fortunate transfer for us."
swanseacity,39bkly,syhr_29,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:09:14 2015 UTC,"Falcao to Chelsea seems to be really close now, and if Mourinho decides to keep Bamford around next season instead of sending him out on loan then he might want to get some money from Remy. So you never know!"
swanseacity,39bkly,Rinpoche8,-2,Thu Jun 18 12:52:52 2015 UTC,I hope the club where he came from doesnt have a clausule like your old Goalkeeper from Swansea city (Vorm). You gave him away for 'free' (while you traded another player to go to your club) to Tottenham so you didnt have to pay the 30% clausule to FC Utrecht.  Fukking lying scymbags. With all the help you got from Holland you treat the clubs from my country this way. Well fuck you too. You lost a lot of dutch supporters with this classy move
swanseacity,39d4fg,Swan_Z,8,Wed Jun 10 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"I like it, there's never been much consistency with our away kits, plus this is kiiind of similar to one of my favourite Swans kits, the third kit from our League One title winning year under Martinez, what a beaut."
swanseacity,39d4fg,Bauza23,3,Thu Jun 11 07:01:17 2015 UTC,I think it looks fantastic!
swanseacity,39d4fg,as_hagi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:39:43 2015 UTC,Well they are usually black... I like the first and last championship away kits where is just plain black and white with a red sponsor logo the best of recent ones. I really hope this isn't real.
swanseacity,39d4fg,Semper_nemo13,3,Thu Jun 11 07:46:49 2015 UTC,"In recent years I'd say we had red more than black:  14/15: Red and black,  13/14: Purple and yellow,  12/13: Red, white and green,  11/12: Orange and white,  10/11: Black,  09/10: Red and white,  08/09: Grey and navy,  07/08: Navy and light blue  struggling to remember before that... but yeah, recently we haven't had much continuity there. But I guess that's the freedom you have with away kits, it's either that or inverse your colours."
swanseacity,39d4fg,Bauza23,2,Thu Jun 11 12:49:36 2015 UTC,"I guess I am biased from when I was a kid and my strongest memories are black, but that could well just have been a season or two."
swanseacity,39d4fg,Semper_nemo13,3,Thu Jun 11 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"I honestly never put too much emphasis on the away kit's importance. I mean how many times did we wear the away kit last year? I think it was only worn 4 times. Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, away to Tranmere in the FA Cup, away to Blackburn in the FA Cup, West Brom at the Hawthorns?"
swanseacity,39d4fg,camdev03,5,Thu Jun 11 14:23:35 2015 UTC,"Well we only wear it when it when white conflicts with the opposition kit, after the set number of appearances for the sponsor. I wouldn't be shocked if we wore it away to Spurs or away in the League cup.  Edit: the only away league cup match was Liverpool, (i couldn't remember about Rotherdam) but we did wear the red/black kit away to spurs"
swanseacity,39d4fg,Semper_nemo13,3,Thu Jun 11 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the design, don't like the choice of colours though."

swanseacity,39d4fg,eksuberfail,3,Fri Jun 12 07:35:23 2015 UTC,"This. I don't mind how it looks now, but seeing the Jacks in it might throw me a bit."
swanseacity,39d4fg,MasonXD,3,Sun Jun 14 19:44:31 2015 UTC,I like the design but there is so much wrong with it that I'd doubt it being real. Its definitely one of those away kits that seem like its designed with the goal of looking better with jeans.  Problems   Sponsor and logo look better in white. Colour scheme is all over the place and very not us. The stitching on the bottom and sleeves is a nice idea but it just makes it look like its inside out.
swanseacity,39d4fg,AlexSilvaGavan,2,Thu Jun 11 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"The 2009/10 and last seasons away kits were my favourites. Not a fan of this one, definitely getting the home one this year."

swanseacity,39bmcn,jimmithy,7,Sat Jun 13 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"The more and more I see the more this seems like a simply game changing signing. He is a cracking player, but what really shines for me is his attitude. He sprints every second of every game, is unselfish in the final third and signed on for us because he wants to be a part of this historic rise.   Also, him and Bafe are apparently quite close, which bodes well for the locker room.   I'm over the moon, what a signing."
swanseacity,39bmcn,Humanatee69,2,Wed Jun 10 17:59:56 2015 UTC,I dont understand where the relationship between Bafe and Andre started.   Maybe a more enlightened individual than I could explain?
swanseacity,39bmcn,BlazeMasterFunk,2,Wed Jun 10 23:44:31 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken , I think they share the same agent."
swanseacity,39bmcn,nnn2,2,Thu Jun 11 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"The soundtrack really makes the interview. Exited to see how he does, just looked into his prior career and so far the transfer looks like a steal."

swanseacity,39bmcn,Semper_nemo13,3,Fri Jun 12 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"They really do their homework too. I remember they had a Ki interview and they'd managed to dig up a new kpop release that had literally dropped that week. Wasn't even a single, it was an album track. That impressed me, they could just go down the royalty free route, but they put in some work."

swanseacity,39cqej,MasonXD,3,Wed Jun 10 22:03:32 2015 UTC,I completely agree with the sentiment but Laudrup is managing a team that since being founded 6 years ago have won the league 5/6 times.

swanseacity,39aod7,Swan_Z,2,Wed Jun 10 15:56:34 2015 UTC,Is it his personality too or just the fact he's a mediocre defender? I don't know anything about him off-the-pitch.
swanseacity,39aod7,ICanHazReddits,4,Wed Jun 10 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"Not sure about his personality, but nowhere near good enough to compete with Naughton and Rangel. All the best to him if he goes though"

swanseacity,39aod7,Semper_nemo13,0,Sat Jun 13 09:53:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think his mistakes were as bad as people seem to think, it is just our system leaves fullbacks on an island. He is faster and stronger than Rangel is anymore. I am sad to see a local lad go, but he needs to be playing regular first team football, I hope he succeeds and can work his way into the national side more often, (but I do like our current RBs, despite their being bluebirds, ugh)"
swanseacity,395jtw,AlexSilvaGavan,4,Tue Jun 9 12:16:16 2015 UTC,"Personally think Southampton vs Swansea was one of the best games of the season. Don't get me wrong, the articles listed 5 games are all worthy of being there, we've had a fantastic season and so its only right we have a lot of games we're proud of.  Southampton were in good form, and we were using a considerably weakened team. It didn't seem like it on the day.   Fantastic defensive performance and moments of sheer brilliance won us the game. Not to mention solid performances from some young players, barrow, caroll, fulton. Just to mention a few off the top of my head"
swanseacity,395jtw,DeFunktRhodz,0,Tue Jun 9 12:52:37 2015 UTC,Very good point! Went nuts when Shelvey scored. What a game! So many good things to look back on this season

swanseacity,38n5xa,Meliv23,3,Fri Jun 5 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"Very interesting indeed. The influence of the Cornish immigrants here was quite large as well. Pasties are a very common meal still and I've always got a few frozen in the freezer. The architecture of the copper works is very familiar to me from home, even though most of it has been knocked down as well.  For example: http://www.pasty.com/reflections/bfb82410.jpg   We've also had lots of issues with land reclamation as well and the old smelting and mining works were EPA superfund sites to allow for a focus on cleaning the pollution up.  I did notice it mentioned in the ad that they were the leader 160 years ago in copper production, I'm not positive, but I do believe that number would correspond to production ramping up here and taking over until Arizona and Montana took over from us before Chile's rise."

swanseacity,38n5xa,MasonXD,5,Fri Jun 5 20:53:51 2015 UTC,I love the irony of having a copper kit and a sponsor with a gold reference in its name.

swanseacity,38n5xa,moomilkmon,2,Fri Jun 5 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"So I've been snooping about to see what the away kit will look like, apparently it's going to be a dark blue/green with hoops around it..But for some reason I don't believe it will be. I've been looking on the online shop and they're selling a lot of accessories with the new Copper Design but the other is a black/grey so maybe the away kit might be Black with a grey design but that's just a thought"
swanseacity,38n5xa,eksuberfail,2,Sat Jun 6 00:27:49 2015 UTC,I mean.. I get where they were coming from with all the copper stuff... But it would be nicer if we had mined something cleaner.

I can only hope it's one of those kits that look better in person - I realised I use fl.ux at night to dim the harsh lighting so my view on it might have been corrupted a bit.  Blue and green hoops sounds a bit risky though. Not two colours in my head that go well together. I'd assume navy and luminous green if so."

Getting the elite prospects within Wales could be pivotal going forward.   That said I fully trust our board to do right with it. They've done incredibly well to get the club this far and I don't see the addition of £80 Million changing that in any way."

swanseacity,38d920,jimmithy,9,Wed Jun 3 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"Like Tate I'd be gutted to see him leave, but at the same time I wouldn't resent it. If he wants to be playing football then it's fair enough - it won't hurt his legacy with us and I'll wish him the best, even if he stays in the top flight. I'm sure the club will always welcome him in the future, and he'll most certainly always be seen as an honourary Swansea boy in the city.  Its the end of an era though - he's the last player at the club who saw the shit times, when moving to us wasn't seen as joining a club on the upward trajectory. Our entire story of this generation can be followed through his career.  I wonder how his career would have gone if he'd been identified by Arsenal or West Ham as a central midfielder rather than a winger?"
swanseacity,38d920,Jamaicaman90,4,Wed Jun 3 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"I've wondered that as well, and I wonder what kind of calls he received after we were promoted to the prem. I'm sure there were some smaller clubs calling.  I only own one Swansea jersey, and it's his. He's a guy that I will support no matter where he goes because he's meant so much to our club."
swanseacity,38d920,Swanseaa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"Watching him speak in Jack to a King it brought a tear to my eye.  Seeing him express how that if we hadn't beaten Hull on that fateful day he probably wouldn't have met his wife, had his kids and shared all the wonderful experiences we've had along the way.    He's a Jack through and through."
swanseacity,38d920,bme500,3,Thu Jun 4 09:21:35 2015 UTC,"Jesus this is a tough one to deal with. Let's consider our Midfield depth in the CDM positions:   Jack Cork Ki Leon Britton   Putting Jonjo or Siggy that deep would be reckless and wasteful. In fact even Ki would be better off playing higher (as his 8 league goals prove). That leaves Jack Cork as the only person really above Britton for that position.  Unfortunately for Britton, Cork has been ruthlessly efficient so far and he's really left little to no room for Britton to step in. That said, I think this shows there is room for Britton on this team. He won't start, but he would be a great secondary option at that position. I reckon he could muster 10< appearances next year in this role.  This puts the ball completely in Britton's court though. Would he prefer to spend his twilight years getting consistent play time? or transition into a coaching role while grabbing appearances here and there for his favoured club?   Can't fault either decision, but I'd love to see him stay."
swanseacity,38d920,Humanatee69,3,Wed Jun 3 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"Jay Fulton may be ahead of Leon, purely because at this stage he has more potential."
swanseacity,38d920,Semper_nemo13,3,Wed Jun 3 18:32:07 2015 UTC,That is fair. If it is an important game though I'd pick Britton over Fulton right now. Not to take away from Fulton who I see as a future First Teamer for us.  We still don't have a game manager like Leon. If we have the lead sitting back with Cork and Britton as two deep midfielders would be about as safe as I'd ever feel.
swanseacity,38d920,Humanatee69,2,Wed Jun 3 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"Kind of sad to see this especially since it's true, with the likes of Shelvey, Cork and Ki playing their best football and with Grimes and Fulton pushing their way through game time for Britton might not happen unless there are injuries. Hopefully we don't get rid of him.. I wouldn't mind him go out on loan at least then if there are injuries he'd be able to come back and he'd be able to play regular football which he wants"

swanseacity,387qjj,Jamaicaman90,7,Tue Jun 2 15:23:41 2015 UTC,Same here the diamond looks a bit odd.  The kit is ok though as long as our home kit is white and our logo is a swan of some sort I'm not overly bothered.  It's not like we're being made to change our emblem and wear a totally different colour like red.  I mean who would do that...
swanseacity,387qjj,bme500,3,Tue Jun 2 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Contender for worst sponsorship logo with Man U again if this is real, just get rid of the diamond and it will look at least decent"

swanseacity,387qjj,epicguy23,5,Tue Jun 2 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"As last season, the sponsor is horrendous and far too intrusive. The detailing colour also looks like it's been made to fit with the sponsor logo than with Swansea City. I personally think this isn't the real thing but what I do know is I hate it.  It would be slightly redeemable if the detailing is tangerine orange rather than dirty gold matching the sponsor as it would hark back to some of our kids from decades ago, which if real could be the case when you see it in person."
swanseacity,387qjj,Jamaicaman90,2,Tue Jun 2 15:18:20 2015 UTC,Can we please get rid of the diamond? :(
swanseacity,387qjj,RedFlagToYou,2,Tue Jun 2 15:03:06 2015 UTC,Adidas is making the kit again this season? I thought they had switched over to New Balance.

swanseacity,387qjj,nnn2,3,Tue Jun 2 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"Yea. New Balance is taking over for the squads that had Warrior kits because Warrior is discontinuing their soccer line. I certainly wasn't looking forward to New Balance kits, glad to hear that's not happening"
swanseacity,387qjj,camdev03,2,Tue Jun 2 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"I hope we dont get New Balance, their kits look unappealing"
swanseacity,387qjj,epicguy23,2,Tue Jun 2 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of the diamond, again. The kit itself isn't bad but I'm not sure what I think of the colour scheme, specifically the brown parts. Nothing compares to our white/gold kit."
swanseacity,387qjj,Cant-Find-Username,2,Tue Jun 2 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the diamond, I hate that they don't have black detailing. That matte rusted/bronze is not good. Is this the last year of GWFX? I hope so. If the away kit is the same design with Black everywhere white sponsor logo, white badge, and white trim, it would be our best away kit since the 32 RED/green/white the first year in the PL. I am not holding my breath though."

Competition in the starting eleven is good news for the team, I hope the players feel the same way."
swanseacity,382ko2,onheartattackandvine,5,Mon Jun 1 12:02:39 2015 UTC,"Neil greatly improved when Naughton arrived - and Naughton played on the right. I think Neil is someone that just needs that competition to keep pushing himself daily. He had it with Davies, now he'll have it with Tabanou.   Hate to play devil's advocate here, but this could be like Bony's one-year extension, too. A deal like this could be prefacing a sell to another club.  Hope that's not the case though.

swanseacity,382ko2,Swanseaa,2,Mon Jun 1 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"I Can't imagine him leaving, he's not good enough for a top 6 club, and Swansea are on par with all the other sides, so surely he'll want to stay in Wales."

Also what language are they afraid of? Welsh? Yn bersonol nid wyf difaru meistroli ei, pam annog pobl i beidio Cymraeg? (that is bad I know, i am so out of practice.) Also, everyone is bilingual anyway why would they even write it out more difficultly? If not who else is reading a Swansea blog? Some fan of a foreign player, or a foregin fan who is trying to follow the club that you might scare off? That seems unwelcoming in an off putting way as well.

If we lose Ki, bring in someone slightly less good but also strengthen another position for example, that can be seen as overall progress.  As Ki is one of our best players (the best according to this subreddit!) I think to replace him competently it will take at least £8m, and we'd need to buy another £8m player for another position for the team overall to continue moving forward. Based on that, I'm saying starting bid at £16m."
swanseacity,37xxpz,MasonXD,3,Sun May 31 17:10:32 2015 UTC,then more on top of that because he is easily our most marketable player... I'd like to think that puts him to a price range that nobody is going to pay for a bench player.

It's also interesting from my perspective looking at the results that I don't think anyone voted for games that weren't against those two clubs (off the top of my head).
swanseacity,37u2hq,MasonXD,3,Sat May 30 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"The really amazing part about all this is that I had forgot just how young Jonjo is, he could really still turn into a great player yet."

swanseacity,37rav6,nathancox33,3,Fri May 29 19:33:31 2015 UTC,"How many years are left on his contract with Benfica? If its a free transfer then that's a great transfer but if not, how much would we spend for him?"
swanseacity,37rav6,BlazeMasterFunk,3,Fri May 29 21:43:07 2015 UTC,We'd be crazy to spend more than 5m... About the same price at Montero...   I saw a Benfica fan on R/Soccer thinking they would get 15m. Personally I think he just forgot that not all of his players are top prospects.
swanseacity,37rav6,MasonXD,1 point,Sat May 30 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"Transfermarkt says his contract lasts until June 2017, so we're definitely paying for him. His market value is also listed as 7 million euros, so more or less £5m."

Not a ""wow"" transfer but one that does add depth which is what we need to progress to the next level if we want to be Europa league contenders!"
swanseacity,37po9i,Swan_Z,3,Fri May 29 13:36:54 2015 UTC,"Never trust a man with two first names?  According to some random guy in /r/soccer he's not regarded as a footballing intellectual, but he's fast, quick and got pace. Still young though, and more established on a higher level than Barrow. Might look like Dyer's role is further minimized?"
swanseacity,37po9i,nnn2,3,Fri May 29 12:35:16 2015 UTC,"Not too sure of what to think of him.  Have heard some bad things about him in the bundesliga. Plus we already have montero on the left and If we get tabanou , we already have cover.  I would also like to see Gorré given a go."

swanseacity,37po9i,xosuperior,1 point,Fri May 29 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"Updated in the Summer thread.  Kind of reminds me of Montero, and considering he's playing on the left as well, makes me skeptical, but my guess is one of them would move to the right. I think we'd be paying over 5 mil, which is about what we paid for Montero.  Everything about him reminds me of players we've picked up in the past — bright, pacey, hasn't quite found his way at other clubs.  I'm personally all for this signing. Would have preferred a winger known for his final ball rather than his pace, but Montero was (is) in the same mold and he has been immense for us."

swanseacity,37g3hc,Humanatee69,4,Wed May 27 15:56:16 2015 UTC,"I believe his form has dipped slightly from last season, which is why bigger clubs are a little hesitant - exactly the kind of thing we've had a lot of success with lately.

swanseacity,377xjd,nnn2,5,Mon May 25 19:33:13 2015 UTC,Bony vs QPR ?
swanseacity,377xjd,onheartattackandvine,4,Mon May 25 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"I think that's my favourite. All though long range shots are beautiful, there's nothing that appeals to me as quick and clever footwork in the box creating a goal out of nothing. Warms my old striker heart."
swanseacity,377xjd,HighOnWinning,5,Mon May 25 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all of Bony's goals were tidy this season, so you'll have quite a few to choose from."
swanseacity,377xjd,onheartattackandvine,4,Mon May 25 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's true. But the one against QPR, came on late too didn't he? Got us a point from a match we should've had all three, but in the end struggled to get even."

Their probably just getting Castaignos and maybe another free signing or a loan at forward. I think he is going to look towards some youth next season in Grimes, Gorre, and Barrow to step into their roles on the squad."
swanseacity,373n0j,BlazeMasterFunk,2,Mon May 25 03:16:17 2015 UTC,I expect a lot of free transfer signings to come in. All season long Monk has talked about how small the team is and how he is planning to build in off season. Jenkins said he was willing to fund a big purchase so Castaignos is looking good for me but no others. I doubt many sales unless someone is very unhappy. Maybe Michu but it is still possible he stays

Top priority has gotta be the Tabanou deal though, for me. I'd say if we could get both for around 10 million pounds, I think it'd be a good stroke of business.

There are some good away deals these days, and I don't tend to go to the 'big' clubs as they tend to refuse to engage in the mutual deals (although Arsenal recently was quite cheap, but also a Monday).  The Leicester fans were so loud, I couldn't hear our own fans singing even when I was looking at a group of about a hundred of them the other side of our end clearly doing so. I've never seen a home crowd so behind their team and I don't take too much disappointment in us struggling to compete with that, given the circumstances of us both at the time."

swanseacity,36spip,M1sterPig,2,Fri May 22 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"Gah, you know what I mean"
swanseacity,36spip,MasonXD,2,Fri May 22 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"I just got home from work (2am in LA). I don't know if I'll actually be able to physically get up for the game later (7am), but I'll at least set my alarm."
swanseacity,36spip,Swan_Z,4,Sat May 23 09:41:30 2015 UTC,I'm dumb (again). The game is Sunday. I get to sleep.
swanseacity,36oh87,miloheej,6,Wed May 20 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"No argument here. Fab, gylfi and Ash is up there, but Ki really has taken steps forward this year. Solid defensively, a threat offensively, confident on the ball and a cool decision maker. Hope to see him progress next season."
swanseacity,36oh87,onheartattackandvine,6,Thu May 21 05:41:59 2015 UTC,"Man I love Ki. Dude's quote (from the club's Instagram account): ""Swansea City has been the best team of my life.""  Really hoping we see him play for us for a long time. He's got the skills that don't deteriorate over time - knowledge of the game, patience, knowing when to take chances, etc. He's so technically sound. I hope he's a staple in our midfield for years to come."
swanseacity,36oh87,Swanseaa,4,Thu May 21 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"It could have gone to one of any four or five players and I wouldn't have complained about any of them getting it. We have had so many of our players step up their game under Monk, its been a fun season to watch."
swanseacity,36oh87,MasonXD,3,Thu May 21 07:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. For me, it was between Ash and Ki. Wouldn't have really cared who got it."
swanseacity,36oh87,Syn_EUW,3,Thu May 21 07:33:37 2015 UTC,Well deserved!

swanseacity,36ofsq,hipitywhopla,6,Wed May 20 21:36:58 2015 UTC,I watched it a few weeks back and thought it was outstanding. I managed to convince my partner to watch it (she doesn't really like football that much) and she loved it too.
swanseacity,36ofsq,MyHatGandhi,4,Thu May 21 08:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, really captures some of the best moments of their redemption story. Truly a bottom-to-top tale and I was honestly shocked how much quality footage they had throughout."
swanseacity,36ofsq,PagingDrFreeman,3,Thu May 21 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to watch it for so long, been tied down with A levels but once they're finished I'll watch it"
swanseacity,36ofsq,ICanHazReddits,2,Thu May 21 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"me and my pops (swansea native and fan for 50+ years) watched this over xmas by using the guide that legend posted here to watch in canada. followed them my whole life so i know the story and lots of the people, thought it would just still be a neat watch.  it's incredible. production is fantastic, great variety of content, just an overall great job and anyone who considers themselves any type of swans or epl fan will enjoy this"
swanseacity,36ofsq,dat_bird,2,Thu May 21 18:51:20 2015 UTC,It's on the way here with my new jersey. Looking forward to watching  it!
swanseacity,36npq9,severedfragile,8,Wed May 20 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"Not much of shock. I'm sure everyone on here would take a fit and happy Michu back in a heartbeat, but neither of those criteria seems to be met. Will never forget the amazing season he had though."
swanseacity,36npq9,onheartattackandvine,4,Wed May 20 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially when our energy in that are is so vital these days. After 2 years of constant injuries, just hard to see him being fit enough to take a consistent place from anyone else. Real shame, but what a player he was for us and Rayo."
swanseacity,36nkvn,jimmithy,3,Wed May 20 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"Much deserved, I hope he wins the Golden Glove too!"

swanseacity,36nput,severedfragile,3,Wed May 20 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"Castaignos becomes less exciting a prospect every year, but I still think he'd be a good signing. Maxim doesn't seem to have lived up to the excitement of previous seasons either. Both seem like smart deals though, still lots of potential in both to overachieve for us.  No mention of Jeffrey Schlupp, who I think would be a really, really good signing for us. He's my first choice left-back signing."
swanseacity,36mudq,Colonel_Blimp,7,Wed May 20 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"His popularity in South Korea is phenomenal, all you have to do is look at the views for his interviews on the Youtube channel. After the Stoke game, Taylor's interview got less than 1000 views, Monk's was barely over 2000 and Ki's is at over 108,000."
swanseacity,36mudq,ICanHazReddits,5,Wed May 20 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"He's a total celebrity over there, dated some K-pop star and then married an actress."

swanseacity,36mudq,DeFunktRhodz,4,Mon May 25 23:23:00 2015 UTC,I still can't get over Laudrup loaning him out. Fucking insane.
swanseacity,36mudq,severedfragile,4,Wed May 20 18:38:21 2015 UTC,Shelvey had a played a part in almost all of his goals..great partnership
swanseacity,36mudq,Swan_Z,1 point,Wed May 20 20:22:56 2015 UTC,Shit I am glad we stopped wearing the alternate kits.
swanseacity,36mfrm,jimmithy,2,Wed May 20 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Two club legends, in very different ways. I look forward to the game, it was a good laugh last year."
swanseacity,36hm8l,jimmithy,7,Tue May 19 13:25:11 2015 UTC,"Think this is a testament to the way Monk has got us working and his man management, especially in cases like Shelvey.  Hell, a few more goals (perhaps if Bony had stayed?) and we'd have beaten Chelsea in this ranking."
swanseacity,36hm8l,Semper_nemo13,4,Tue May 19 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"Kinda feel that was rigged so chelsea would win, and lord knows the Fab red puts them over us."
swanseacity,36hm8l,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Wed May 20 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"tbf I think most of the metrics used are pretty good measures of ineptitude until you get to goals scored.  Obviously scoring goals is important but QPR scored 41 goals and got 30 points, Liverpool have just 51 goals and are in 5th.  So I guess what I'm saying is if we changed these bullshit metrics to some other bullshit metrics we would be top/bottom of a different unimportant (but interesting) table  The fact that palace have thrown the ball to the wrong player 266 times is astonishing, even more surprising that at least 5 teams did over 200 times so far - that's 5+ times a game"
swanseacity,36hm8l,Doppies,2,Wed May 20 05:32:16 2015 UTC,Still beat Arsenal
swanseacity,36hcz6,MatthewJohn48,3,Tue May 19 12:03:45 2015 UTC,"Here to give the important insight as usual.... he's pretty good on Fifa. 90 strength and 5 star skills <3 but seriously, hes an important part of an impressive Dundee team, until they lost some players to Celtic, but still a good striker. I'd guess he is below our level and a move to the championship would be a better fit. However, he has the right attributes to become a good striker so I wouldn't mind him as back up and it could pay off for us."
swanseacity,36hcz6,MasonXD,1 point,Tue May 19 12:18:40 2015 UTC,"Haha! To improve on this season, we obviously need a quality striker that's guaranteed goals in the Premier League. Ciftci's not the answer to that. However, he would be good back up and could contribute well in league cup and fa cup."
swanseacity,36d4rs,Meliv23,11,Mon May 18 12:58:13 2015 UTC,Anyone wanna fly me in from New Jersey?
swanseacity,36d4rs,fronteir,3,Mon May 18 13:48:25 2015 UTC,And me from [Flair]
swanseacity,36d4rs,tajestic,8,Tue May 19 00:32:35 2015 UTC,They're only like 15 quid on the store too.
swanseacity,36d4rs,jimmithy,5,Tue May 19 03:34:58 2015 UTC,"What a great way to move out the rest of their stock! They even sent a bunch to the US to be given out at the premier of ""Jack To A King"" in Portland."
swanseacity,36d4rs,Seandoeslights,3,Mon May 18 14:05:15 2015 UTC,Good incentive and very little cost given that their stock needs to be gone within the month.
swanseacity,36d4rs,MasonXD,2,Mon May 18 23:27:26 2015 UTC,A mate of mine ordered me a ticket. Do you need to get the shirt before Sunday?
swanseacity,36d4rs,Fingers_9,1 point,Mon May 18 15:48:38 2015 UTC,It seems like i'm just jumping on late but does this deal still qualify if I bought a ticket now?
swanseacity,36d4rs,MasonXD,2,Mon May 18 22:37:51 2015 UTC,Apparently you should have had a voucher come through with your ticket. If not I suppose you'd be contact the ticket office
swanseacity,36d4rs,MasonXD,1 point,Mon May 18 15:50:53 2015 UTC,I haven't got a ticket yet but I saw they are still available. Was considering picking one up.
swanseacity,36d4rs,M1sterPig,1 point,Mon May 18 16:05:34 2015 UTC,"So I'm in London visiting from the States, and I just got my voucher. I'm not gonna be able to make it to Swansea before the match, and I only have my black Swansea training jersey. Anybody know if there's a way to get this in London?"
swanseacity,36dacr,siddhantprakashsingh,11,Mon May 18 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"And there was me anxious about the exit of Michel Vorm... Fabianski has had a terrific season, what an acquisition he's been!"
swanseacity,36dacr,ICanHazReddits,3,Mon May 18 16:39:23 2015 UTC,And on a free!
swanseacity,36dacr,Hindugod,1 point,Mon May 18 19:18:09 2015 UTC,Doubt he will go. Wasted many years at a big team with Arsenal and wont make the same mistake. Quality keeper! YJB
swanseacity,369iuu,jimmithy,15,Sun May 17 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"So, 8th place it is. Although I wish we could've moved up to 7th, if I was told we would finish 8th at the beginning of the season, I would have taken it in a heart beat.  Bitter sweet seeing Bony seal the deal. Miss him a lot, but I'm glad to see Gomis in spectacular form. Hopefully it can carry on into next season.  Time to go back to bed."
swanseacity,369iuu,HighOnWinning,11,Sun May 17 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"Lovely wide open game, 8th place is nothing to scoff at, clear penalty at the end but in the grand run of things it didn't matter.  Play young players at Palace and see you lads next season?"
swanseacity,369iuu,Semper_nemo13,12,Sun May 17 14:30:15 2015 UTC,"Gutted but probably the right result, should've been a penalty at the end there but ah well it wouldn't have made much of a difference. Glad Gomis scored really coming to his own now which is great..Hope he keeps it up for the last game."
swanseacity,369iuu,Swan_Z,10,Sun May 17 14:26:56 2015 UTC,"Proud of the squad. Put a great effort in and didn't deserve to lose 2-4. World class save from Hart kept it at 2-3 and if that had gone in god only knows what would have happened. We played well, Gomis scored a fantastic goal and contributed to what was a fantastic match of football. Let's hope we can win on the final day at Crystal Palace and make this season even better than it already is."
swanseacity,369iuu,GuzBear,9,Sun May 17 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"Should have been a penalty at the end.  I think what's frustrating is that we had the chances to win the game. Dyer should have done a lot better in the first half. Hart did very well to save Gomis and Fernandez's headers.  All in all, good season. Good stuff."
swanseacity,369iuu,ole85,1 point,Sun May 17 14:34:01 2015 UTC,So frustrating to see Dyer nowdays. It seems like he hang on to the ball too much. I'd like to see Barrow alot more next season. Imagine the pace down the corridors with him and Montero on the field😁
swanseacity,369iuu,MayorShreeves,9,Tue May 19 10:21:00 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/LszsPP5  Ash and his kids leading the lap of honour.   What a captain, he's had an amazing season and I couldn't fault his effort or play at all"
swanseacity,369iuu,MasonXD,9,Sun May 17 15:27:50 2015 UTC,Just a shame that Hart and Yaya choose this game to get into form. Both had average seasons but amazing games.
swanseacity,369iuu,redragon11,9,Sun May 17 22:49:44 2015 UTC,"I know 8th place is in no way, shape, or form a bad result, but I feel we could've at least tied with City and been able to place 7th (with the 25 goal lead over Crystal Palace that I'm calling now)."
swanseacity,369iuu,MasonXD,6,Sun May 17 18:02:15 2015 UTC,If we beat Palace by 25 goals I will without a doubt have a mental breakdown of some kind.
swanseacity,369iuu,ole85,7,Sun May 17 22:52:32 2015 UTC,"I think we did great today.. And what is really nice to see is that we are constantly improving. Barrow is gonna be huge next season! I hate losing, but today I still have a smile on my face!"
swanseacity,369iuu,onheartattackandvine,4,Sun May 17 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Who wants Europa League anyways, great season no matter what."
swanseacity,369iuu,SlutMcFuckNut,4,Sun May 17 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"Overall a very entertaining game, not overly disappointed  with the loss, I'm just pleased that we seriously looked like we were supposed to be there. Very happy I went.  Edit: Also I may or may not have yelled ""IT HAD TO BE FUCKING WILF"" when that Man city 4th went in."
swanseacity,369iuu,moomilkmon,5,Sun May 17 15:36:38 2015 UTC,The one day heart and yaya descide to play in super form has to be against us. Heart saved some ridiculous balls could have easily been a draw if anything.
swanseacity,369iuu,Swan_Z,3,Mon May 18 07:06:38 2015 UTC,I just hope Villa beat Arsenal just to spite S'ton since we can't get Europa now
swanseacity,369iuu,MasonXD,5,Sun May 17 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"You would rather Villa get it than Southampton? Id rather have the team that actually deserved it get in. Besides, Villa getting in would be a death sentence, they'd be relegated by December."
swanseacity,369iuu,MyHatGandhi,3,Sun May 17 22:51:26 2015 UTC,I'd like Soton to get it... maybe their form will dip giving us an even better chance of Europa next season 😊
swanseacity,367p12,SlutMcFuckNut,4,Sat May 16 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's just those two that are our competition..."
swanseacity,367p12,miloheej,4,Sun May 17 07:09:03 2015 UTC,"Can't say that I have any idea who he is or what he is capable of, a little underwhelming none the less."
swanseacity,367p12,onheartattackandvine,3,Sun May 17 08:21:14 2015 UTC,"Watch some clips of him on youtube. He looks really quite good. Got good strength, skill and composure in front of goal. Assists a lot too. Then again, this is in the Scottish league, but still, could be a worthy purchase. He's young and got time to improve."
swanseacity,367p12,GuzBear,2,Sun May 17 11:31:55 2015 UTC,"Still, it's good to see us being linked to many players. Shows that there are solid backup plans even if the dream transfers don't happen (Mitrovic to Swansea is looking uncertain)."
swanseacity,367p12,premature_eulogy,3,Sun May 17 11:16:19 2015 UTC,"All I know of him is from FIFA, and I'm not going to pretend that's accurate information, but skill and strength seem to be his forte.  However the transition from the Scottish leagues to the Premier League is often a tough one..."
swanseacity,367p12,Bauza23,2,Sun May 17 13:45:18 2015 UTC,"It took Ki awhile to find his feet, but look at him this year, or really last on loan."
swanseacity,367p12,Semper_nemo13,3,Tue May 19 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"Here to give the important insight as usual.... he's pretty good on Fifa. 90 strength and 5 star skills <3  but seriously, hes an important part of an impressive Dundee team, until they lost some players to Celtic, but still a good striker. I'd guess he is below our level and a move to the championship would be a better fit. However, he has the right attributes to become a good striker so I wouldn't mind him as back up and it could pay off for us."
swanseacity,367p12,MasonXD,2,Sun May 17 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"This is the third 5 star skiller (Ciftci, Mackay-Steven, and Alexandru Maxim) we have been linked to since Gary Monk took over.  Coincidence? I think so."
swanseacity,367p12,SwanseaScheme,2,Mon May 18 12:22:57 2015 UTC,And more surprisingly all are from Europe! Does Monk hate Brazil!? What did Neymar do to his wife!? Find out here next....  No.
swanseacity,367p12,MasonXD,2,Mon May 18 12:28:27 2015 UTC,Can't we just spend a bit of that proverbial 'fat cash' and buy some top class players....
swanseacity,366b6d,Swan_Z,10,Sat May 16 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, we have to beat both due to Southampton having the goal difference advantage. 4 points won't be enough."
swanseacity,366b6d,premature_eulogy,13,Sat May 16 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"Unless we win by 25 goals, then we're set."
swanseacity,366b6d,Swanseaa,8,Sat May 16 16:58:16 2015 UTC,Against city? no problem
swanseacity,366b6d,onheartattackandvine,6,Sat May 16 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"I've lost by similar amounts of goals before, its the first 24 that hurts."
swanseacity,366b6d,MasonXD,8,Sat May 16 18:13:43 2015 UTC,15 tomorrow and 15 next week. No need to be greedy.
swanseacity,366b6d,jimmithy,9,Sat May 16 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"On a positive note, Stoke can't catch us now. We've finished at least 8th, and should be very proud of ourselves"
swanseacity,366b6d,Semper_nemo13,5,Sat May 16 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty depressing today, but if somehow we beat city we're going to be jacked again tomorrow"
swanseacity,366b6d,epicguy23,3,Sat May 16 17:20:16 2015 UTC,well next year we totally have Europa League unless everyone gets Dyer Syndrome.
swanseacity,366b6d,BlazeMasterFunk,1 point,Sat May 16 17:13:49 2015 UTC,If we tie city and beat cp by 20 and southampton lose to city next week by 5 then we have definitely got Europa next year
