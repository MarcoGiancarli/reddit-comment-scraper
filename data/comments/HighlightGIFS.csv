HighlightGIFS,3beljb,lukejames1111,2,Mon Jun 29 12:18:47 2015 UTC,He is not 'active' until he plays the ball or has a direct influence where he is interfering with the ball or an opposing player on the ball. In the build up he is not interfering with play and is therefore not offside. He isn't flagged offside when the ball is headed across goal as in that phase he is behind the ball so can't be offside.

HighlightGIFS,3aec9y,esjay_,28,Fri Jun 19 12:54:39 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me how surfing competitions are judged? Why is this a perfect ride as opposed to another?
HighlightGIFS,3aec9y,themohammad,14,Fri Jun 19 15:11:53 2015 UTC,"It's kinda like figure skating, or high diving, or half pipe. They give out a basic criteria of things they're looking for (deep barrels, big carves, airs, floaters, cutbacks, etc.). And since everyone is an expert, both surfers and judges, they know what the hardest things to do are and those get more points. But there's also some room for artistry and style and ""maximizing"" a wave. Then it also depends on the spot they're at and what the potential of those particular waves are.  This wave is Cloud Break in Fiji and it's known as a tricky large barrel. So on this one Owen got particularly deep and beat multiple accelerating sections (parts of the wave breaking a bit early). He was about as far back and deep in the tube as you can get but he still made it out perfectly. Hence, a 10.  It might not look as impressive to the non-surfer, because he's kinda just going straight, but believe me there are VERY few people in the world who could do what he did on that wave.  (here's his other 10: https://youtu.be/ky_f8PZ9cZk?t=46)"

HighlightGIFS,3aec9y,drfacebutt,2,Fri Jun 19 18:45:44 2015 UTC,Xgames? Bull riding ?
HighlightGIFS,3aec9y,iamoz,10,Fri Jun 19 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"Those are competitions, but not sports.  A competition is when two or more parties engage in an activity and there will be some victor(s) and defeated.  In a sport, this victory condition must be attained solely by the actions of the involved parties, not the opinions of others.  Sports:   Basketball Baseball Soccer Football Tennis   Competitions:   Marching Band Bull Riding Cheerleading Surfing   Boxing:  The victor can be determined by the judge's cards; however, a KO or TKO is also a sport-qualifying condition as well.  Unlike most competitions, it does have a quantifiable sport-condition, and its therefore a sport.  There may be individual X-Games that are sports, I'm not familiar with all of them.  Isn't there a vertical jump?"
HighlightGIFS,3aec9y,MrSilkyJohnson,5,Fri Jun 19 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"When defining sport vs competition, I also like to include something along the lines of ""each side takes direct action to deter the opposing side from achieving its goal"".

HighlightGIFS,3aec9y,iamoz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"I think you are imagining that these sports are entirely subjectively judged, but they aren't.    In a sport, this victory condition must be attained solely by the actions of the involved parties, not the opinions of others.   What about, say, gymanstics? In olympic gymnastics, competitors submit their routines ahead of time, and there is a point value assigned to each possible move (made part of the rules beforehand, much like the 2 and 3 point lines in Basketball) that adds up to a total possible point value for the routine. After that, it's just the judges watching to see which moves are completed and if not, to what extent they deviated from their planned routine.   It's not AS subjective as saying whether a basketball went through a hoop, granted, but there are subjective elements of judging in all sports. How are personal fouls determined? How about unsportsmanlike conduct penalties?"
HighlightGIFS,3aec9y,frotc914,3,Fri Jun 19 19:34:44 2015 UTC,"It's not AS subjective as saying whether a basketball went through a hoop, granted, but there are subjective elements of judging in all sports. How are personal fouls determined? How about unsportsmanlike conduct penalties?   Fouls are not the final outcome of the game, only a consequence of human error and all parties are normally under equal scrutiny.  In the end the number of times the defense of the other player was penetrated for a score is what determines the outcome.  In your example of a gymnast, it is undeniable that 10 different judges would not produce an identical score for the same routine.  If this were true, only one judge would be necessary.    There are several factors involved, including having seen a perfect ""10/10"" performance just before, the next competitive performance is placed under a different scrutiny than having just seen a ""4/10.""    External human psychology determines the outcome there, not the actions of the players; thus, it not a sport.  Best example is listen to the crowd for a close competition.  When the Warriors beat the Cavs in game 6, no one questioned who the victor was.  When Dennis Wolfe got fifth place at the 2008 Mr. Olympia behind a retiring Ronnie Coleman, the crowd chanted ""BULLSHIT""."

HighlightGIFS,34rufv,esjay_,4,Mon May 4 01:57:51 2015 UTC,Where can I start watching rugby?
HighlightGIFS,34rufv,LOLingMAO,8,Mon May 4 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"theres 2 main codes, rugby union and rugby league   rugby union is the originator. it has complexities that take a while to understand but is viewed as the more ""pure"" game. super 15 is a good competition to start watching. also /r/rugbyunion rugby league is simplified, and has a similar ""6 down"" format to american football. personally i prefer watching this code. best place to start is the NRL. and of course /r/nrl the game in the OP is touch rugby or touch football. its  a variant of rugby league, main differences being touching instead of tackling, and 6 people per side. super popular game in Australia and New Zealand. its also one of the rare sports where women play at the same level as men. probably a good place to start watching is the Touch World Cup youtube channel, or /r/touchrugby"
HighlightGIFS,34rufv,esjay_,6,Mon May 4 02:26:50 2015 UTC,"/r/nrl (which OP and I both come from) is a bloody good community mate, both supportive and full of content..  Get on it!"

HighlightGIFS,34onhm,Looorney,2,Sun May 3 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"Obviously these are highly skilled professionals and I'm just some guy typing on my computer, but...  As much as this is a good goal, I think it's a massive error by the defence. The wall is placed very badly and the keeper really should have this sighted. The fact there is zero curl on the kick cements this for me. The striker doesn't even have to use any trickery or ball flight calculation - he literally hits it in a straight line.  A good player taking advantage of a defensive error in my opinion."
HighlightGIFS,34onhm,Womjack,0,Sun May 3 11:55:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right the wall is in place but it just falls apart. They don't even all jump. There is dip yeah, but considering it's not struck extremely hard and the distance away, I really am surprised the keeper is so stretched. The dip doesn't change what he should have covered on the horizontal plane. I do take your points, but still a very soft goal in my view in spite of the striker's skill."
HighlightGIFS,34onhm,Womjack,-1,Sun May 3 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"He's at least 35 yards out.  To beat a keeper from that distance you have to kick the ball really fucking hard.  This tends to make the ball rise.  He put a TON of downspin on the ball, which is the hardest curve to get.  That in itself took a ton of skill.  The wall just jumps and hopes to take a chunk, they don't have time to react and actively move towards the ball."

HighlightGIFS,33s19f,DJ_ChuckNorris,13,Sat Apr 25 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"this is a thing of beauty in slow-mo    For those unsure what is going on.  The tigers have placed through a kick into the in-goal area where you need to place the ball on the ground to score.  The kick has slightly gone too long and if Kevin Naiqama (the fresh prince in the title) places the ball down it will be out of bounds, so on one motion he grabs hold and flicks it back while diving."
HighlightGIFS,33s19f,esjay_,4,Sat Apr 25 03:00:12 2015 UTC,yea but then the other dude cant even make a simple try lol
HighlightGIFS,33s19f,CrazySumo,5,Sat Apr 25 03:12:22 2015 UTC,What do you mean?  James Tedesco did score from the flickback.
HighlightGIFS,33s19f,esjay_,10,Sat Apr 25 03:39:02 2015 UTC,WOW I'm such an idiot. I thought the line Naiqama was diving over was the try line. I was wondering why he bothered to flick it back instead of just scoring. My bad.
HighlightGIFS,33s19f,CrazySumo,8,Sat Apr 25 03:51:09 2015 UTC,Don't worry dude that's exactly what I thought was thinking what are these guys doing he was over the try line is he just showing off?

HighlightGIFS,31wzz2,chas11man,5,Wed Apr 8 23:51:19 2015 UTC,He is out of the basepaths. I've read the umps gave him leeway because the fielder's kept attempting the play.
HighlightGIFS,31wzz2,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,9,Thu Apr 9 00:04:17 2015 UTC,You have 3 feet both directions once the tag attempt is made and you have established a path to the base. Each time a new tag attempt is made that 6 foot wide path is reestablished from the runner to the base he is headed towards
HighlightGIFS,31wzz2,chas11man,-1,Thu Apr 9 00:12:14 2015 UTC,"Read the original thread on /r/sports  Multiple very experienced umpires at many levels unanimously agree that he was obviously out.

HighlightGIFS,2zydjv,Tammylan,5,Mon Mar 23 03:52:50 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, if you don't use the proper technique. A cricket ball is slightly heavier and much harder than a baseball.  The secret is to cushion the ball, much like receiving a pass in soccer.  Imagine a friend throwing a rock at you. If you just stick your hand out in front of you to catch it, then you'll probably break your hand.   But if your hands first make contact with the ball a foot in front of you, while only fully stopping the ball's momentum when it's a foot behind you, then your hands will be fine.  In this catch Vettori is using much less than those two feet to slow the momentum of the ball to the point where he can catch it without hurting himself."

HighlightGIFS,2ykrq8,kcweathers2012,26,Tue Mar 10 17:11:35 2015 UTC,"Anderson Silva at his prime was truly an awesome spectacle, you could fill this subreddit with his highlight reel. But none of his videos are as amazing as the one time he lost to a random japanese dude"
HighlightGIFS,2ykrq8,MNameIsNotTracy,7,Tue Mar 10 18:20:24 2015 UTC,what did that move do?
HighlightGIFS,2ykrq8,Colts1984,13,Tue Mar 10 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"That was a heel lock. Or, more specifically, a flying scissor heel lock. You control the opponents movement with your legs (locking them in place), and put twisting pressure on the ankle, which travels up the leg and puts severe pressure on the knee.   It's highly effective once in place, and has a high injury rate, especially for the knee ligaments (which is why Silva tapped so quick). To illustrate how potentially damaging this move can be, the UFC released their fighter, Pilhares, after he didn't immediately release this move when his opponent tapped."
HighlightGIFS,2ykrq8,SloppyJoMo,2,Tue Mar 10 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's particularly dangerous because there's not much pain until damage starts to be done so really once you feel like you need to tap it's too late. If it's put on more slowly in training or practise it's a bit safer but still a bit dangerous. It's banned in a lot of competitions because it can put people out for a long time."
HighlightGIFS,2ykrq8,Ocean_Squeeze,9,Tue Mar 24 23:52:13 2015 UTC,"Isolated the knee and torqued it in a really awkward/painful way that, if sustained, would cause some pretty serious/permanent damage to your leg.   Craziest part is he did it from a standing position…like, he went parallel to the ground, wove his legs through Silva's, and got control of the heel…all in a matter of half a second. If that didn't work, he would've been on his back against one of the best wrestlers in the world"
HighlightGIFS,2ykrq8,compto35,2,Tue Mar 10 19:04:32 2015 UTC,Strikers. Far from one of the best wrestlers. He's been wrestlefucked by almost every wrestler of note he faced (making his wins against them even more impressive).

HighlightGIFS,2q95az,esjay_,4,Wed Dec 24 05:53:16 2014 UTC,It's time like that where your eyes go wide and you jump out of your seat.
HighlightGIFS,2q95az,A_Giraffe,1 point,Wed Dec 24 09:31:28 2014 UTC,"very much so, especially considering GSP had been controlling the fight and looked like he was heading to a comfortable victory, it took something special to give Carlos even a chance"
HighlightGIFS,2q95az,A_Giraffe,2,Wed Dec 24 09:36:55 2014 UTC,"I think the biggest pop I had watching a fight was when Randy Couture landed that punch that floored Tim Sylvia. My friend and I had actually counted out Randy leading up to the fight, thinking that Tim was going to use his size and reach to win a very slow, uninteresting win. We wanted Randy to win, but, y'know...  Then that punch landed, and I think I lost my voice."
HighlightGIFS,2q95az,mywifeletsmereddit,3,Wed Dec 24 09:39:59 2014 UTC,GSP described that as the hardest he'd ever been hit. He was completely on autopilot for a while there defending himself
HighlightGIFS,2q1egu,seagalogist,54,Mon Dec 22 04:35:22 2014 UTC,Look at #83's blocking during this play too. He might have run more than Lynch!
HighlightGIFS,2q1egu,ManBearPig92,22,Mon Dec 22 10:28:40 2014 UTC,God DAMN that dude did his job.
HighlightGIFS,2q1egu,alfonsoelsabio,16,Mon Dec 22 16:14:16 2014 UTC,There needs to be an assist category. Give this man some tangible credit for that td.

HighlightGIFS,2q1egu,JV08,7,Mon Dec 22 10:07:00 2014 UTC,Best part of the whole clip for me: he switches the ball to the hand closer to the sideline when he approaches the boundary. Fundamentals.
HighlightGIFS,2q1egu,SmithFire13,7,Mon Dec 22 16:43:08 2014 UTC,"Good run, he has great manoeuvrability, and power."
HighlightGIFS,2q1egu,phixional,4,Mon Dec 22 04:53:20 2014 UTC,He may not be the fastest but good fucking luck when you catch up with him. Full head of stem that dude is scary.

Just seems like pro frisbee players should catch that. I mean, it's a slowly hovering disc. I do wish I could throw a frisbee like that though, damn."

HighlightGIFS,2ools4,Fpb1677,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:08:41 2014 UTC,Foster has never really had a problem holding on to the ball.   Earl Campbell was even worse.
HighlightGIFS,2ools4,compto35,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:09:52 2014 UTC,Pretty sure your old coach wasn't screaming at a grown-ass man with years of experience professionally running with a football

HighlightGIFS,2nyj7v,FacId,9,Mon Dec 1 22:46:17 2014 UTC,"That was not a scoober, that was a standard forehand, also known as a flick."
HighlightGIFS,2nyj7v,Reedfrost,3,Tue Dec 2 00:59:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm more impressed by the throw than the catch."
HighlightGIFS,2nyj7v,boner_macgee,1 point,Mon Dec 1 23:58:12 2014 UTC,Play it on backward. I beg you.

HighlightGIFS,2nxhcc,Chidar,3,Mon Dec 1 13:45:49 2014 UTC,Never ever give up home in the weighted random number generator that is basketball.
HighlightGIFS,2nxhcc,Ultramerican,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:15:33 2014 UTC,Literally everything is a weighted random number generator
HighlightGIFS,2nxhcc,timeel39,0,Wed Dec 3 20:30:29 2014 UTC,"No.  There are 2 outcomes: make basket or not make basket.  No other sports are that binary.  You can't block the ball once shot, so its literally a RNG."
HighlightGIFS,2nxhcc,Ultramerican,1 point,Wed Dec 3 21:02:04 2014 UTC,Never giving up would mean following your shot for a potential rebound instead of just standing there and watching it.
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,gr3yh47,14,Sun Nov 30 18:23:25 2014 UTC,That's not a one-handed catch...
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,CornerSolution,-9,Sun Nov 30 19:59:16 2014 UTC,"He reached out with one hand to pull it in, which is regarded as a one handed catch by, well, anyone who isn't some random redditor with no football knowledge  Edit: lol downvotes. I guess all the previous professional football players who are now sportscasters are all wrong."
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,CornerSolution,5,Sun Nov 30 20:13:28 2014 UTC,"I guess it's ultimately a matter of opinion, but to me it's pretty clear that he does not gain possession of that ball without using both of his hands.  Let me put it this way. If he drops the ball anywhere between the time his left hand first makes contact and the time his right hand first makes contact, is that a fumble? To me, clearly not, because he doesn't have possession: the ball is bouncing around, and he absolutely needs the second hand to get it into his possession.  In other words, without using a second hand, he drops that ball for an incomplete pass, and thus the ball was not caught with one hand."
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,CornerSolution,-9,Sun Nov 30 21:05:51 2014 UTC,"Everything you said is true, but again, when a ball is brought into the body with one hand it is generally called/regarded as a one handed catch even when two hands are ultimately used to control it"
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,boobie_squooze,4,Sun Nov 30 21:12:32 2014 UTC,"when a ball is brought into the body with one hand   Again, the ball was not brought into the body with one hand. The left arm remains extended the entire time. It's the right arm that ends up pulling the ball into the body."
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,CornerSolution,-10,Sun Nov 30 21:36:23 2014 UTC,he reached out with one arm and pulled it in before working to control it.  it was announced and recapped as a one handed catch by multiple professional sportscasters who were previously professional football players  many catches like this one over the years have been called one-handed. you are arguing semantics and ignoring common professional use. kindly go away.
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,boobie_squooze,-4,Sun Nov 30 21:38:14 2014 UTC,"Interesting...  So, since using one hand to catch doesn't count as a one-handed catch...what would you call a one handed catch? Using no hands? Using your face?  When Harry Potter caught the snitch with his mouth, did that count?"
HighlightGIFS,2nv037,bandalooper,6,Sun Nov 30 20:46:01 2014 UTC,"Copy-paste from my post above:   I guess it's ultimately a matter of opinion, but to me it's pretty clear that he does not gain possession of that ball without using both of his hands.

HighlightGIFS,2nc3pg,GoalieSwag,2,Tue Nov 25 03:47:16 2014 UTC,That first pass by Soderberg was ridiculous. Video here.

HighlightGIFS,2na1i8,JustCallMeEro,2,Mon Nov 24 21:53:08 2014 UTC,"Penalty was declined and the touchdown stood. If a play goes in your favor, but the opposing team draws a penalty then said penalty will be declined or nullified in other words."

HighlightGIFS,2na1i8,chillywilly29,1 point,Tue Nov 25 02:49:16 2014 UTC,"It means the defender interfered. If he had not caught it the ball would have been placed where the penalty occurred.  In this case they take the result of the play (catch, touchdown) and decline the penalty."

HighlightGIFS,2n81pf,omgimonfire,4,Mon Nov 24 03:01:11 2014 UTC,I have been a diehard Dallas Cowboys fan since I was five years old in 1993. My girlfriend of seven years dumped me for another guy this past May and she was just as big a fan of the Giants. I hate this man's team from the absolute blackest depths of my heart and they deserved more than a touchdown for that catch.  The most amazing thing I have seen in my 21 years of watching this game. Collinsworth called that shit right.

HighlightGIFS,2n81pf,klancy05,3,Mon Nov 24 16:41:13 2014 UTC,Defensive Pass Interference. Makes the catch even more impressive considering the DB was holding and trying to drag him away from the ball.
HighlightGIFS,2n81pf,Fluffhead1217,0,Mon Nov 24 17:01:36 2014 UTC,Was the flag for offensive pass interference?  Pretty sure grabbing the corner's jersey is worthy of sending that back.

HighlightGIFS,2kk8wz,Madonkadonk,3,Tue Oct 28 16:06:56 2014 UTC,That was incredible.
HighlightGIFS,2kk8wz,classicdms,7,Wed Oct 29 00:55:22 2014 UTC,"Some more context on some things that might not be immediately recognizable from the video.    The man making the tackle is Scott Sattler, a backrower in rugby league who's job is to play as a 'workhorse' tackling the opposition and making meters for the whole game (which he had been doing impeccably.)  The player making the break is Todd Byrne, a talented winger with plenty of speed who until that time had been fairly quiet in the game.    You can see when the play breaks down and the ball comes loose that Sattler is one of the only players to react and start sprinting into a position where he could be helpful if needed.  This in itself is an amazing feat for a player who is heavily involved for the whole game without breaks.    The match itself as you can see was tied at one coverted try a piece.  Due to the slippery conditions tries were a rarity and if the Sydney Roosters (white team) had scored then it would have gone along way to assuring a grand final win.     As time will show after that tackle Penrith were inspired to go ahead and win the grand final and I think that Scott Sattler probably had a lot to do with it."

Walker, who was born in Wales, grew up in Australia and first played ice hockey there. He moved to the Czech Republic in 2007 in order to further his career, and joined the junior program of HC Vítkovice, a member of the Czech Extraliga. He first played for the senior team in 2011, becoming the first Australian ice hockey player to play for a professional senior team in Europe. Along with HC Vítkovice, Walker was loaned to several lower-level Czech teams. In 2013 he signed with the Youngstown Phantoms of the junior United States Hockey League, moving to North America for the first time. He attended the training camp of the Washington Capitals in 2013 and signed with their AHL affiliate Hershey. Walker represents Australia internationally, and first played for them at the 2011 IIHF World Championship Division II tournament, where he helped his team win their group and earn a promotion to Division I for the following year. Passed over in the previous two NHL Entry Drafts, Walker was selected by the Capitals in the third round of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, the first Australian selected in an NHL draft.

HighlightGIFS,2gtugr,in_da_tr33z,13,Fri Sep 19 13:32:45 2014 UTC,What in blazes is going on here? (Australia)
HighlightGIFS,2gtugr,mywifeletsmereddit,9,Fri Sep 19 06:35:36 2014 UTC,"The pitch appears to be going towards the batter's head or shoulder, so the batter leans away. But the pitch curves into the strikezone instead."
HighlightGIFS,2gtugr,StumpBeefknob,7,Fri Sep 19 06:52:11 2014 UTC,I really want to see this in slow motion. It looks like the curve/drop back into the strikezone takes about 1/10th of the total flight time
HighlightGIFS,2gtugr,zeusisbuddha,5,Fri Sep 19 08:20:56 2014 UTC,"You can do slow motion on gfycat, just click the minus button below the video"
HighlightGIFS,2gtugr,SwiftJudgement,3,Fri Sep 19 18:24:24 2014 UTC,"To further explain: The strike zone is between the batters waist and knees vertically and the width of home plate horizontally.   If the pitcher throws three strikes past the batter (without the batter putting the ball in play), the batter is out. If the pitcher throws 4 balls outside the strike zone, the batter goes to first base.   The batter thought the ball was way out of the strike zone, and was worried it might hit him. Instead, the ball curved for a strike 3, and the batter is now out. You can tell this was the third strike from the motion the umpire makes with his hands."
HighlightGIFS,2gtugr,the_dinks,2,Fri Sep 19 20:06:44 2014 UTC,"Also, it's really much more deceptive in person, plus the ball is probably going about 132 km/hr"

HighlightGIFS,2glrlp,weapon_VII,1 point,Wed Sep 17 17:22:03 2014 UTC,It doesn't take much to understand that helmets don't offer much protection from concussion. A concussion is caused when a sudden stop of the head causes the brain to 'smash' into the skull. A helmet isn't going to stop this.

HighlightGIFS,2g3e9s,axolotlking,0,Thu Sep 11 15:13:23 2014 UTC,"Actually yeah, same here. I don't know much about rugby. The players don't seem to get hurt as much and they have no pads...where it's the opposite in the NFL. Do our guys hit harder? And thus I've found a site that mentions something ""“NFL players are bigger, stonger (sic), faster. Almost all of them have college educations. The average NFL player could pick up the average Super 14 player, turn him upside down, and shake him like a piggy bank."" (http://www.smithsonianmag.com/) It seems this site is more like a magazine but it's not hard to notice physical differences, therefore I recognize this site (personally) as a credible source."
HighlightGIFS,2g3e9s,sterlinglock,5,Thu Sep 11 15:25:32 2014 UTC,"I think it has more to do with the fact that, in some of the positions, most of these guys play for a full 80 minutes.. Also some of the bigger guys in the NFL only play defensive position and vice versa for the running backs etc, whereas in rugby you have to do both with very little breaks in play."
HighlightGIFS,2g3e9s,Rational_Consumer,2,Thu Sep 11 19:23:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah dude, those big defenseman pretty much have to use an oxygen mask when they run 100 yards... let alone play and run for 80 minutes... Rugby sounds a lot like soccer and american football mixed with a little hockey. That's nuts, I'd be a fan if I had grown up with it in my culture."

HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,xenodochial,14,Mon Sep 8 00:00:37 2014 UTC,"It was ruled a penalty and cost the team 15 yards.   The penalty was ""unnecessary roughness"".    I doubt that there will be an additional fine imposed by the NFL but it's a possibility.   Edit: just for clarity...this is very far from legal and you could hear the crowd ooh'ing and ahh'ing while they were playing back the replay on the big screen."

HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,icu_,-1,Mon Sep 8 14:39:36 2014 UTC,"It has to be a fine. If Suh's flipping kick to the groin is a fine, surely that has to be."
HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,Dysalot,6,Mon Sep 8 11:36:50 2014 UTC,"Antonio Brown isn't Ndamukong Suh though. Antonio brown was trying to hurdle the kicker, but the kicker instead of trying to go for a tackle decided to go back on his heels."
HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,Z504,7,Mon Sep 8 14:09:12 2014 UTC,"Execpt that this seems unintentional. He was trying to jump over the guy. This looks like a classic hurdle move that went wrong.  Brown was penalized because when you make a move like that, the consequences are on you. He shouldn't be fined, though."
HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,TheReaver88,0,Mon Sep 8 14:14:34 2014 UTC,"That doesn't look like a hurdle to me, it looks intentional to me. That's why I make the comment about Suh, it is impossible to tell if it was intentional either way."
HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,Dysalot,1 point,Mon Sep 8 14:23:05 2014 UTC,"You're watching in slow motion. There's no way at real time he can jump, then think ""oh, I should kick this guy in the face"" and do it. He thought the kicker would do a dive tackle, which is why Brown attempted a hurdle."
HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,R99,0,Mon Sep 8 21:55:24 2014 UTC,Exact same thing with Suh. That's why I find it comparable.
HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,Dysalot,2,Mon Sep 8 22:32:12 2014 UTC,Suh's is way different. Brown's was during the play and you don't have as much time to think when you're doing everything to avoid going down. Suh's stop was pretty clearly intentional.
HighlightGIFS,2frf3n,R99,2,Mon Sep 8 22:42:50 2014 UTC,"I am not talking about the stomp, I am talking about the time he was being flipped over a lineman and hit the QB in the nuts. He was fined $30,000 and if you watch it at regular speed, it would be impossible to say it's intentional."

HighlightGIFS,2f7ano,ManBearPig92,1 point,Tue Sep 2 04:02:06 2014 UTC,"Snooker.   From wiki:  The game is played using a cue and 22 snooker balls: one white cue ball, 15 red balls worth one point each, and six balls of different colours: yellow (2 points), green (3), brown (4), blue (5), pink (6) and black (7).[3] The red balls are initially placed in a triangular formation, and the other coloured balls on marked positions on the table known as ""spots"". Players execute shots by striking the cue ball with the cue, causing the cue ball to hit a red or coloured ball. Points are scored by potting the red and coloured balls (that is, knocking them into the pockets) in the correct sequence. A player receives additional points if the opponent commits a foul. A player (or team) wins a frame (individual game) of snooker by scoring more points than the opponent(s). A player wins a match when a predetermined number of frames have been won."

Basically, if the pitcher screwed up and made a bad pitch, we are not penalizing the batter for it.""

Anyway,  watch any video of the player hit by more pitches than anyone (Craig Biggio if you didn't know that), or any other player for that matter, and it doesn't matter, that ball hits you, it's your base.

It's how I learned it was a rule: I'd always assumed that if you got hit, you took your base. But the ump ruled the batter had an opportunity to move away but didn't try to not get hit. It was an A's game in the mid-00s.   Generally, though, the batter won't just let themselves get hit. They'll motion in some way. Also, if there's no opportunity to get out of the way, no ump will call it anything but hbp."

He managed to get back a little and his opponent therefore didn't hit him properly. But a full one to the side of the face would have disrupted him enough to not land his hit.  Or am I seeing that wrong?"
HighlightGIFS,2btylv,Gandzilla,1 point,Sun Jul 27 12:58:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that would've been a sock to the face if he hadn't moved. Also, the punch was much less effective since he moved his head with it, making the blow less severe."

HighlightGIFS,28u3wv,Heratiki,2,Mon Jun 23 03:15:13 2014 UTC,"You see this kind of thing a lot in ice hockey, where obscuring the goalie's  line-of-sight (a 'screen') is an effective tactic which often leaves the goalie 'looking.' Still, it seems to me that the goalie here clearly saw the ball but lost track of where he was in the net and thought the ball was sailing wide and decided to let it go."

HighlightGIFS,28u3wv,SwedishLovePump,3,Mon Jun 23 14:33:15 2014 UTC,I think the wide open shot that he put right at the defender playing goalie is a representative play of Bradley this year. He has been in the right spot and had the right ideas but just can't get any sort of luck/good bounces.

HighlightGIFS,28ilji,kvnryn,2,Thu Jun 19 11:21:17 2014 UTC,What type of rules do you mean?
HighlightGIFS,28ilji,highlight_gif_bot,6,Thu Jun 19 12:24:39 2014 UTC,"This year for example, they've removed home plate collisions by requiring the catcher to get out of the way of the plate and also made faking a pickoff to third and throwing to first a balk.  Edit: There was also a changed rule for the first few weeks that they ended up changing where if you dropped a ball transferring it from your glove to throwing hand it counted as not having caught it like on a put out at a base or a fly ball. Adam LaRoche pointed out to them that this would mean an outfielder could catch a ball, run into the infield, drop it on a transfer to his throwing hand, and turn a triple play, similar to what the infield fly rule tries to prevent."
HighlightGIFS,28hkqb,Dunni-,3,Wed Jun 18 19:51:49 2014 UTC,So sick.  I do see some people saying that this is better than Van Persie's header and I just don't think that's true.  The cross was from a further distance and he used his fucking head to put it over the goalie and into the net.
HighlightGIFS,28hkqb,dynamicSmurf,1 point,Thu Jun 19 01:37:29 2014 UTC,"Header is easier to aim in my opinion, but both crosses/goals are fucking crazy."
HighlightGIFS,28hkqb,zaswsaz,3,Thu Jun 19 03:08:14 2014 UTC,http://gfycat.com/PersonalFakeChital  I agree that headers are probably easier to aim on normal crosses like from corners but the distance and direction the ball is going completely changes the difficulty in my opinion.  He has to time his run with where the ball lands as well as make sure he gets enough of his head on it so that it goes straight forward.  I would imagine 2 inches to the right on his head and that ball is going wide.
HighlightGIFS,28hkqb,dynamicSmurf,2,Thu Jun 19 04:13:06 2014 UTC,"To be fair more like 2 millimeters :P. Though I think that is the case in both cases really. With the header, the change in direction is definitely crazy hard to do but you don't have to worry about over kicking it as you do with the volley. In all honesty I am not qualified to start comparing all the differences :p. They are both pretty damn sick goals, but the header is definitely cleaner and more satisfying to watch."

They hit high, throw elbows, knees. Even with gear on that shit hurts and bones get broken."

A professional human yes, but not a human with clairvoyance. Part of why this hit is so impressive is that it was unusual/unexpected, and given that the cameraman actually responded very quickly"
HighlightGIFS,271mjb,Halefire,3,Sun Jun 1 18:57:15 2014 UTC,"After looking at it again, you are right. The score and channel logo don't move. So it is in fact the broadcast that made the bad decision, not OP."

HighlightGIFS,24lvgy,ThatGuy69696,13,Sat May 3 07:14:36 2014 UTC,"For those who don't know. In the NBA playoffs teams are pitted in a best of seven series so the first to win 4 games moves to the next round. The team that won (Portland Trailblazers) were underdogs but were leading the series 3-2. Just that before that shot the losing team (Houston Rockets) scored a basket that put them up by two with only 0.9 seconds remaining (hence the quick shot). Had Lilard missed, the final game of the series would have been played in Houston and given the rockets a slight upper-hand to win the series."

HighlightGIFS,24lvgy,lookallama,5,Sat May 3 16:49:16 2014 UTC,I don't think they can really be considered underdogs like that. It was a 4-5 matchup  pretty evenly matched and Portland was the #1 team in the West and the league for a good amount of time.
HighlightGIFS,24lvgy,lookallama,2,Sat May 3 19:20:53 2014 UTC,I would think that the expirence of Harden would trump the skill of lillard but I was wrong. Heading into this series I thought that It would go to 7 because only the home team would win every time

HighlightGIFS,247rz4,CPTherptyderp,2,Mon Apr 28 23:52:23 2014 UTC,"I have never heard of it until now, is it different from normal football?"
HighlightGIFS,247rz4,1nate146,3,Tue Apr 29 02:46:49 2014 UTC,"tons of fun  they play in a hockey rink, so a much smaller field.  Crazy fast game play because these guys are basically pros/post college players.  There's no real out of bounds (its about 4 inches wide) so lots of board hits.   My uncle played for few years, even played with Kurt Warner.  Live games are just a blast."
HighlightGIFS,247rz4,CPTherptyderp,2,Tue Apr 29 03:00:37 2014 UTC,"Yes, the basics are the same but there are a lot of differences.  The field is much smaller (50 yards + 8 yard endzones long x 28 yards wide) and it's exclusively indoor. The field goal posts are a lot taller and narrower, and there are nets behind each endzone that are live. In other words, you can throw the ball and if it's caught after bouncing off the net it's a legal catch. There are walls along the edge of the field that act as an out of bounds barrier.   As far as actual play goes, there are only 8 men per side and you're allowed to move forward before the ball is snapped, so it's very common to have a player sprint towards the line of scrimmage and snap the ball just before he gets there to give him a running start. There are weird rules about alignment and blitzing on defense that I don't fully understand.  Because of these rules, passing is dominant in this league and throwing for 100+ TDs in an 18 game season is normal. It's basically a  more action filled version of the NFL.  edit: They're about 7 weeks into the season right now. If you have a team near you, you can pick up tickets for dirt cheap and it's a fun way to get your football fix in the offseason."

Edit: Downvote if you choose, but I'm an American and (almost goes without saying) an American football fan. Our football is based on rugby league football. Look up the history of the sport. We were playing a deadly version of rugby league at the turn of the twentieth century. So the NCAA was formed, our colleges met with Canadian colleges, we each added the forward pass and protective gear, and thus ""gridiron football"" was born and became the most popular code of football in America and Canada."

HighlightGIFS,2441k3,RsonW,2,Thu Jun 26 18:26:09 2014 UTC,"More room to show off skill than many other sports.  Football is really just a bunch of small plays so something major happening is very low. Often it's just a ton of small running plays, nothing impressive.  Baseball doesn't really have anything exciting except statistics since one homerun is the same as any other (without context, like bases loaded to win the game, it all looks the same in a highlight gif).  Soccer has a chance since there's more back and forth. Hockey too, but that's more about passing it well than skillful control (from a spectator's point of view).  Rugby is one big play, back and forth (more or less) so there's constant examples of skill.  It's pretty obvious if you just think about it."
HighlightGIFS,2441k3,hounvs,3,Sun Apr 27 22:14:19 2014 UTC,"In defense of baseball:  It's a defensive game (the defense possesses the ball).

Crazy catches, incredible throws, that sort of thing.  Edit: DIRTY PITCHES!  How could I forget dirty pitches?"

HighlightGIFS,240sv9,The_Comma_Splicer,2,Sat Apr 26 22:57:12 2014 UTC,"Forward passes are indeed not allowed, but as long as the ball leaves the players hands in a backwards direction, the pass is considered legal.

In contrast, in the NFL, the specific, not the relative motion of the ball is all that matters. That is, even if you're running, if you ""lateral"" the ball at the 35 yard line, the person receiving the ball cannot catch the ball past the 35 yard line.   Such a great video/explanation.

HighlightGIFS,23z2ly,CapitanPeluche,5,Fri Apr 25 20:58:21 2014 UTC,"This looks brilliant, what are the rules? Score points by completing passes?"
HighlightGIFS,23z2ly,Grealish,6,Fri Apr 25 23:17:13 2014 UTC,Kinda like American football. Score within an endzone. You can't run once you catch a pass but there are unlimited passes. If the defense intercepts or knocks down a pass (a.k.a. if the offense doesn't complete a pass) it's a turnover and the disc immediately goes the other way. First to 15 scores wins. It's really fun especially when you have a team that knows what they're doing!

HighlightGIFS,23z13i,mywifeletsmereddit,6,Sat Apr 26 07:04:36 2014 UTC,"This is actually a game of ultimate being played on a football field, so the colored endzones are misleading. In this version of ultimate the field is 80 yards long and has 20 yard endzones. So yes, it is only a callahan if you catch it in the endzone, but here the endzone starts at the football field's 10 yard line. You can see a small pylon on the sideline at the 10 yard mark to note the endzone boundary."

HighlightGIFS,228wk1,MrTurkle,5,Sat Apr 5 14:10:30 2014 UTC,"If you notice, he doesn't hit with the knee itself, rather the area of the thigh above his knee.

When you have broken the defense you can use the space and your speed to get around a player one on one. In rugby that is illegal, to beat the line of defense without blockers it would have to been set up by quick ball from the ruck, or the player has to be very good. Especially with modern defense patterns adopted from rugby league."

HighlightGIFS,212jeg,Intensive__Purposes,3,Fri Mar 28 19:46:22 2014 UTC,That's pretty much it. You can't pass the ball forward but you can kick it forward to a player who was behind you when the kick happened. This guy caught one such kick and planted it in 'end zone'.

HighlightGIFS,20zcd8,TheCaringAsshole,-1,Fri Mar 21 11:25:48 2014 UTC,"I know I am in the minority but for me this isn't a red. To me Hogg didn't aim to connect his shoulder to Biggar's chin, that was just an accident which made the whole thing look much worse than the actual offence was. He turns his head and back away from the man and was 'unfortunate' enough to connect badly.   Yes it was peanlty for checking him and yes it was a yellow as it was bloody cynical, I just can't see that there is that much malice in there.   and this comes from an englishman!"
HighlightGIFS,20zcd8,pipboon,7,Fri Mar 21 09:32:19 2014 UTC,"I'd have been happy with a yellow, but it's not hard to justify it being a red. He jumped after the kick and it was both reckless and unnecessary."

HighlightGIFS,20zcd8,ruzmutuz,2,Fri Mar 21 11:30:52 2014 UTC,"Bullshit, if you watch from other angles you can see that Hogg is waaay off blocking the kick. He was so late to it that he had no chance at all. The fact that he jumped is ridiculous, he could easily have not done this, just by not jumping and stopping running.  It's a red because it's fucking dangerous."
HighlightGIFS,20zcd8,pipboon,5,Fri Mar 21 10:10:45 2014 UTC,"Hey - let's keep calm now. It's just my opinion.   As I stated I know it's a penalty, he's definitely not trying to block the kick in any way, I'm just saying that if the shoulder hadn't hit his chin then it would of never of been a red .... AS IT WASN'T IN THE FIRST PLACE.   For those who didn't see it live the ref gave a yellow and then saw the reply on the screen and changed it to a red.  If there was malice in there and Hogg was aiming for the chin then it's a red all the way, however I don't believe there was and the punishment should relate to the offence, which was the late tackle/blocking.  EDIT: Grammar"
HighlightGIFS,20zcd8,mmmMike,1 point,Fri Mar 21 10:25:58 2014 UTC,It's not about what he intended to do it's about the danger of what happened because of his actions.  If it was an accident it was extremely negligent of him.  Players have to learn that those situations are probable of serious injury and they should not even attempt them.
HighlightGIFS,20zcd8,ruzmutuz,-1,Mon Mar 24 15:07:56 2014 UTC,"The thing is though, if Hogg had either stopped, or bumped into him it would have been fine. But he jumped and turned, and that is where I think the malice lies. There was no potential for anything constructive to happen from him jumping after the kick, no block, nothing. So why did he do it? He was far enough that he could have stopped, but close enough that carrying on would certainly led to off the ball contact. I think it's lucky there wasn't a serious injury or knockout. And the thing is, you said it's a red only because of the contact with the chin, but surely red's exist for this reason too, to deter players from doing stupid things that potentially lead to serious injury.  As said elsewhere, it was both reckless and unnecessary, and that is why it deserves a red card."
HighlightGIFS,20zcd8,Smone777,-1,Fri Mar 21 11:32:57 2014 UTC,"The thing that I didn't like about this was that the ref made his decision to give a yellow card, and then without going to the video ref changed his decision to a red after seeing the jumbo screen in slow mo. To me that isn't really fair. The ref should have gone straight to the video or stuck to his decision."

HighlightGIFS,20r788,LivinWithMom,1 point,Wed Mar 19 15:53:26 2014 UTC,"Making saves helps a team, but field coverage is also an important tool to a good defense and a good team.  A goalie balances these things.  When he's more confident the other team can't beat him with a shot he can move out and otherwise help his team.  Of course then you occasionally get a goalie just getting beat on a really great shot or what this is.  For all intents and purposes to the goalie here, this was a fluke, even if the player did it purposefully."

HighlightGIFS,1yzsdw,Fudge_is_1337,9,Wed Feb 26 19:27:45 2014 UTC,The illegal part is the fact that he starts to invert him. Necks are broken like that.

In this case, the tackler not only takes his man past horizontal so his head is pointing towards the floor, but then power drives the guy into the floor"

HighlightGIFS,1yzsdw,sberder,2,Sat Mar 8 14:04:46 2014 UTC,"The other replies talk about the fact that the tackler is actually manipulating the receiver to go past vertical (would get called for unnecessary roughness), but there'd also be perhaps a smidge more leeway in the NFL because there are pads and helmets. Dropping someone on their neck is slightly less dangerous because there's a helmet and shoulder pads which help to limit the range of motion, but this would still get called."
HighlightGIFS,1yzsdw,sberder,3,Thu Feb 27 05:00:20 2014 UTC,There is a HUGE difference between tackles in rugby and tackles in NFL. Tackles in rugby are defined by the laws as a player grasping another player and bringing him to the floor. Tackles in NFL would more accurately be described as hits. If you take a look at the rugby union laws for Dangerouse tackling you'll see a list of moves you routinely see in NFL.  I think that the fact that NFL players wear heavy protections allows for those huge hits and put them at more physical risk than rugby players.
HighlightGIFS,1yzsdw,Stoned_lebowski,9,Thu Feb 27 05:44:52 2014 UTC,"There are loads of inaccurate answers to your question here. There are several points that make this action illegal:   Offense 1: The ruck is formed and the tackler comes from the side of it which is illegal (16.5.c) Offense 2: The tackler is engaging in dangerous play (16.5.j). The sign a referee will look at is hips above shoulders, otherwise called spear tackle. Offense 3: while I would agree there is no malice in this move, the tackler destroys the tacklees face when they hit the ground. Just a byproduct of this dangerous tackle I'd say."

This particular bowler is Mitchell Johnson, who is currently in the form of his life, bowling at seriously express speed. He caused serious problems for the English side that recently toured Australia and is now terrorising the number one test side in the world, South Africa."
HighlightGIFS,1yaew6,aw3man,2,Wed Feb 19 02:01:43 2014 UTC,"but is there any compensation to the batting side? like in baseball, you'd be awarded first base on any ball that hits the batsman/batter.

HighlightGIFS,1yaew6,aw3man,2,Wed Feb 19 15:34:53 2014 UTC,"No i think I understand it.  Also, explanation of scenarios of RBIs: If a runner is on base (however that happens: gets a hit, gets a bases on balls (walk), or whatever), and my actions in facing the pitcher cause that runner to score, I get credit for getting that runner in.   examples:   if my teammate is on third base, and I hit a single, he decides to run home and score, I get a credit for an RBI.  If there are runners on all three bases, and I hit a home run, I get credit for 4 RBIs (each runner, including myself, that crosses home plate counts for one).  If I get a base on balls (walk) and all three bases have runners aboard, I get credit for the run that scores in the form of an RBI. If I get a hit and the runner wouldn't normally get to home plate, but the fielder misplays the ball, and then the runner scores, I would not get credit for that run batted in."
HighlightGIFS,1yaew6,ieuano,2,Wed Feb 19 16:02:51 2014 UTC,"ok, and it is averaged against each time the batter goes out to bat? Is there any distinguishment between an RBI from a home run to one from a walk with someone on third?  There is no misfield count in cricket, the runs extra you score due to it count for the batsman and against the bowler, but bad deliveries (too wide, illegally bowled) form part of the 'extras' count on the scoresheet.  Thanks for the explanation, i think I've got it now!"
HighlightGIFS,1yaew6,aw3man,1 point,Wed Feb 19 16:24:29 2014 UTC,"It's not averaged, it's just a running total. There is not distinction between a walked in RBI or a solo home run RBI.  That makes sense as well.  Glad we can help each other!"

HighlightGIFS,1xx462,CapitanPeluche,3,Fri Feb 14 22:03:15 2014 UTC,"all good. what's a ""short period""? seems like it would be too vague for watchers of american football to not cry favoritism every time."
HighlightGIFS,1xx462,CapitanPeluche,4,Fri Feb 14 22:53:04 2014 UTC,"Once a player goes to ground one of several things happen immediately: if they aren't held they get up and keep going or pop the ball up to a teammate; or an opposition player will be on them immediately trying to steal the ball while their teammate/s will be trying to protect them - this is called a 'ruck'.   Basically there is rarely a scenario in which a player would break this law, to the point where I've never seen it broken."
HighlightGIFS,1xx462,CapitanPeluche,3,Fri Feb 14 23:41:31 2014 UTC,So does possession only change when a pass gets dropped and the other team picks it up?
HighlightGIFS,1xx462,davo_the_uninformed,4,Fri Feb 14 23:53:21 2014 UTC,"Possession can be lost/gained in many ways.   Teams often kick possession away to either gain territory or relieve pressure. You can also steal the ball from players on the ground, if you are the first player there, or by pushing the opposition away from the ball (rucking). You can also steal the ball by ripping it away from a player who is on their feet. You can hold a player up (choke tackle) and be awarded a penalty. You can intercept a pass.  The opposition can make mistakes, like obstructing, dropping the ball forwards, passing forwards etc. whereby you are awarded possession."
HighlightGIFS,1xx462,CapitanPeluche,1 point,Sat Feb 15 00:09:33 2014 UTC,Thanks for the detailed response. Are there no limitations to how physical you can be in trying to take the ball away?
HighlightGIFS,1xx462,davo_the_uninformed,2,Sat Feb 15 01:53:32 2014 UTC,"You're not allowed to stomp, eye gouge, etc. There are also a bunch of more technical restrictions like intentionally leaving your feet in a ruck or collapsing a maul that are more difficult to explain adequately to a newbie.   In general you just get as low as you can and hit the other dude as hard as you can to get him out of the way, so your teammate can follow you in and steal the ball.  David Pocock, Richie Mccaw, Liam Gill and George Smith are IMO the best pilferers in the world. But then I'm a biased Australian."
HighlightGIFS,1xx462,real_nice_guy,1 point,Sat Feb 15 04:22:50 2014 UTC,"Right, that makes sense. I can't believe anything goes at all times though. Sounds unbelievably awesome and much more fluid of a game as an avid American football fan  Edit: I'm watching some of these awesome videos you linked... My god, I would expect 100+ on each team's roster with those hits."
HighlightGIFS,1xx462,_br1Ck,3,Sat Feb 15 04:52:51 2014 UTC,"Its not that anything goes, here is a good example of a thing that does not go (incident happens at about 0:30 replay at 1:40). It really is the technical stuff that is the biggest limitation. For example, in a tackle you cannot hit them above the shoulders, but when they are bent over the ball it is almost impossible not to. But you must enter a ruck 'through the gate', ie, from directly in front. This means that the vast majority of hits come from infront of you which reduces the danger somewhat. Entering a ruck from the side is one of the most common infringements in rugby.   As for fluidity, there are two broad styles to the game. The southern hemisphere teams tend to play a more flowy and expansive game (the teams in this gif are from Sydney (Aus) and Auckland (NZ)) with lots of passing and counterattacking. Northern hemisphere teams tend to kick more and are more restrained in their attacking movements, as a result their games are more stop-start and, IMO, not as exciting.  If your interested, here are some of the best games from last year.  South Africa vs New Zealand. These are the 2 best teams in the world and this match was to determine the winner of the Rugby Championship.  Australia vs New Zealand. From the same competition as SA vs NZ. Australia had been pretty shit all year and this is the first time they actually played well.  Ireland vs New Zealand. Sensing a pattern here? New Zealand were aiming to become the first team ever to win every match in a year. Ireland played incredibly well.  Highlanders vs Chiefs. Not the All Blacks this time but both sides are from New Zealand. The chiefs went on to win the competition last year."

If you watched the videos he hugged Erin Andrews before she interviewed him. It was IMMEDIATELY after the game. He also came out and said he should have handled it differently. I have nothing but respect for him, he talks a big game and backs it up. He is the BEST corner in the league. There are tons of shit-talkers in the league (i.e. Crabtree) but they can't all back it up. He has. If you have ever watched Steve Smith play WR for Carolina you will see that Sherman is doing the same thing he does on the other side of the ball. Smith talks a big game, gets in DB's heads, and then burns them. Sherm talks a big game, gets in WR's heads, and burns them."

This is the best video I can find that shows off the basics. It's all perfectly legal to do in a match as long as you keep the stick below the allowed height. It's obviously harder to do that stuff in hockey because you need a special kind of blade to do it in floorball, but it can still be used for some fancy stuff.  Original video here"

A rugby ball is bigger and rounder than a football, its not as hard and in my opinion the grip surface is better, so its not as easy to strip it out. You can sort of wedge a rugby ball between you palm and wrist in a way that its very difficult to jar out. One of those defenders got a pretty decent grip on it but couldn't rip it free.   Also, once you make a tackle, as soon as the runner hits the ground he has to let go of the ball, so you can just pick it up. Its generally a safer tactic to just make the high percentage tackle and win a turnover like that then to make a riskier play on the ball."

It is thrown by a Team A player whose entire body is beyond the neutral zone when he releases the ball. b. It is thrown by a Team B player. c. It is thrown after team possession has changed during the down. d. It is the second forward pass during the same down. e. It is thrown from in or behind the neutral zone after a ball carrier’s entire body and the ball have been beyond the neutral zone.   Going by e, it looks like while the ball carrier had been beyond the neutral zone (Line of Scrimmage), the ball had not yet crossed, and therefore, a legal pass.  From the NFL rulebook, Rule 8, Section 1, Article 2, Item 1: Illegal Passes:   Illegal Passes. Any other forward pass by either team is illegal and is a foul by the passing team, including: (a) A forward pass thrown when the passer is beyond the line of scrimmage. Note: It is a forward pass from beyond the line of scrimmage if the passer’s entire body and the ball are beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released, whether the passer is airborne or touching the ground. The penalty for a forward pass thrown from beyond the line is enforced from the spot where the ball is released. (b) A second forward pass thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. (c) A forward pass thrown after the ball has crossed the line of scrimmage and has returned behind it. (d) A forward pass thrown after there has been a change of possession.   In the NFL rules, going by (c) it also looks like it doesn't matter if the passing player crosses the line of scrimmage as long as the ball does not fully cross the line and is then thrown. Legal forward pass."

The most impressive part of this play is the block by Kuhn to keep Peppers off Rodgers which allowed him to get out of the pocket.

Sure, it wasn't a deep bomb and may have been under thrown. But factor in that the margin of error was little to none, considering it was 4th and 8, and Aaron Rodgers was facing a ton of pressure.

HighlightGIFS,1tl1m2,tjb_32,3,Tue Dec 24 04:24:42 2013 UTC,"This is not a charge because the defender must stop moving (plants feet) before the offensive player attempts the shot. PM was still getting into position so its not a charge.   Here is an explanation & Here   Blocking/ Charging Foul  This is THE most difficult call to make in basketball. A lot is left up for interpretation, and referees blow this call more than any other. Blocking, by definition, is personal contact which impedes the progress of an offensive player. This call is made when a defender bumps into, or impedes an offensive player's progress with their body. Charging is personal contact called against the offense, with or without the ball, usually because the offensive player pushes, or runs through a defender. When judging a block/charge, officials are supposed to use the following principles: 1) Does the defender establish an initial legal guarding position? 2) Does the defender remain stationary or does he move laterally or backwards in order to maintain the guarding position? 3) In moving to maintain the guarding position, are one or both feet on the floor while doing so? 4) Is the defensive player on the spot first? Basically, everyone has a right to their position on the court, whether it's the offense or the defense. If either one violates that space, then a block/charge will be called.   &   Blocks/Charge: A block/charge foul occurs when a defender tries to get in front of his man to stop him from going in that direction. If he does not get into a legal defensive position and contact occurs, it is a blocking foul. If he gets to a legal position and the offensive player runs into him it is an offensive foul. In both situations, if the contact is minimal, no foul may be called. To get into a legal position defending against the dribbler, the defender just needs to get in front of him. On a drive to the basket, the defender must get to his position before the shooter starts his upward shooting motion. For most other cases, the defender must get into position and allow enough distance for the offensive player to stop and/or change direction."

HighlightGIFS,1tinhe,rav-i,1 point,Fri Dec 27 05:25:55 2013 UTC,"No, OP has it right. The flow of the play starts off to the left with a fake handoff. When he hands it off on the WR coming back around going the opposite direction, that's a regular reverse. The pitch to the other WR coming back again across the flow of the play makes it a double reverse."
HighlightGIFS,1tinhe,THEsolid85,2,Mon Dec 23 10:16:03 2013 UTC,Incorrect. When he hands off to the receiver the first time it's called an end around. The running back is just a mis-direction The second receiver receiving the hand off from the other receiver is the reverse. Just a reverse not a double reverse.
HighlightGIFS,1tinhe,rav-i,1 point,Mon Dec 23 23:12:16 2013 UTC,is a reverse a lateral like passes in rugby league?
HighlightGIFS,1tinhe,pHyR3,2,Wed Dec 25 06:38:00 2013 UTC,"A reverse is specifically when a player makes it look like he's going to rush up one side of the field (usually behind the line of scrimmage), but then passes or hands off to somebody going up the opposite side.  A lateral pass is still called a ""lateral"" or ""backwards pass"" in American football."

Your argument is childish as well, when did I say that they shouldn't be entertaining? I stated that it is more focused on the entertainment aspect than the sport at this point. It it turning into the WWE. Watch almost any highlight involving a dunk with a defender within 3 feet, there will be a foul, be it over the back or stiff-arming or anything else. Or if that isn't enough, try this. This is considered a wonderful play by Blake as he forearms Gasol in the head. I can't stand the Lakers but this is still a foul."
HighlightGIFS,1tdmfr,TexanHoosier,1 point,Sun Dec 22 07:27:10 2013 UTC,"The gif above is of HIGH SCHOOL basketball. The NBA, Blake Griffin and your opinion thereof are all irrelevant. The gif above is NOT an offensive foul.   Fact of the matter is, in those Blake Griffin dunks, the defender is in the restricted area so they give the advantage to the offensive player. The defender is usually the one initiating contact, even in the Pau Gasol clip, and when you're inside of the restricted are and you're not going up vertically then you're gonna get called for a foul every time. Gasol's arms are not vertical and he hacks Griffin well before he gets elbowed in the face. A lot of smarter players just get out of the dunker's way. That's not a testament to the game favoring entertainment over the sport, whatever the fuck that means, it's just what the rules are.   It it turning into the WWE.   It's really not and I find it hard to take a discussion seriously when you speak in retarded hyperbole like this. You're free to NOT watch basketball if it's such a horrible disgrace to sports."

Also, didn't you just have the fifth overall pick in the draft like two years ago? I'm sorry you drafted Claiborne. You should be more angry with your defensive coaching, head coaching, and GM-ing. Maybe if you drafted better and coached better, you'd be better. You guys would be a really good team this year if your defense didn't suck. The draft doesn't keep teams down.

Until then he is going to assume we are only winning seven to nine games every year because the coach isn't doing his job and so we will rotate coaching staffs. A new Jerry puppet comes in and the ysame thing happens. That's purgatory. The middle of the pack/draft thing was more for a comparison with middle of the pack teams in basketball."

The point after touchdown is a ~20 yard field goal and basically a formality at this level.

HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,philclarke0,12,Mon Dec 16 03:56:23 2013 UTC,I'm pretty sure that should have been a penalty.
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,Corryyyy,3,Mon Dec 16 04:21:22 2013 UTC,"If so, won't he be fined after the fact?"
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,flapsfisher,7,Mon Dec 16 04:43:21 2013 UTC,He'll definitely be getting a fine and possibly a suspension
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,BigAngryMoose,-3,Mon Dec 16 05:14:48 2013 UTC,I sure fucking hope so. That was just poor sportsmanship!
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,Corryyyy,6,Mon Dec 16 07:39:28 2013 UTC,"That's not really poor sportsmanship considering it was a block directly in the path of an oncoming ball runner.   Also, Not entirely sure the block was illegal due to the target being the chest though I could agree that incidental contact to the head may play into a fine.   I see more of a scenario where the punter isn't prepared to be hit even though he's in a direct line of where the hits are coming.  The punter is attempting to make a tackle and the blocker is attempting to stop him from doing so.  A professional tackler, or a non-punter, wouldn't usually be caught unaware like that.  This scene is because a punter isn't prepared to take a hit and is hit hard."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,flapsfisher,2,Mon Dec 16 12:33:54 2013 UTC,"No, definitely an illegal hit. They've come out and admitted it was."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,maniacalxmatt,2,Wed Dec 18 21:04:11 2013 UTC,"I agree that the helmet connecting with the chin/lower portion of the facemask is an illegal hit and should have been flagged.  I do not think it intentional when talking about the situation where men running top speeds around multiple blocks and changes of direction are being performed at unbelievable speeds.  The blocker saw the balls direction and in a split second finds a ""target"" to remove from the alley the ball is headed.  This happens almost instantly.  So while illegal and the player has been fined 25k $, I lay an equal amount of blame on the punter himself for putting his self in the line of fire.   He isn't good enough to he in that moment and payed for it.  A better tackler would have noticed the blocker and made attempts to counter the blow.    If punters are ""defenseless"" get them off the field after they kick."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,flapsfisher,3,Thu Dec 19 12:43:27 2013 UTC,"It's still the definition of targeting. And while targeting has been controversial so far, it's plays like this that make the rule a necessity.  No player shall target and initiate contact to the head or neck area of a defenseless opponent with the helmet, forearm, fist, elbow or shoulder. When in question, it is a foul.  Borrowed picture from /u/jman00555 comment"
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,kakanczu,4,Mon Dec 16 14:35:01 2013 UTC,"The only reason it would be considered ""the definition of targeting"" in this isolated case is due to the person being hit being a kicker which a rule has been made that a punter/kicker is always a defenseless player.  HOWEVER, when that punter attempts to make a tackle, he is no longer a punter, he is a defensive tackler and is treated with the same respect.   The punter was attempting to stop a runner from passing and was hit by a player clearing the lane.  There might be a fine, but I believe it would be because the nfl is scared of the new (and large) ""I want football to be less violent"" crowd, but if that is the case I think you'll also see a change in the rules wording where when a punter/kicker becomes a potential tackler, he is no longer a defenseless player.  Just my opinion."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,flapsfisher,0,Tue Dec 17 12:57:14 2013 UTC,There's no targeting rule in the NFL. That's college football.
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,shadowbannedlol,-3,Mon Dec 16 22:25:49 2013 UTC,"yeah, it's poor sportsmanship to hit someone that's unaware, and as kakanczu pointed out, it's also against the rules."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,AkilesOfCydonia,0,Mon Dec 16 15:46:16 2013 UTC,Poor sportsmanship? The blocker was opening a hole for Antonio Brown by blocking an opponent. What is he supposed to do? Ask the man if he's ready to be hit?
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,palerthanrice,-9,Mon Dec 16 18:11:40 2013 UTC,Just because it's a big hit doesn't mean it's illegal. He lead with his arms and he hit him in the strike zone. I'm not sure what else you want.
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,jman00555,13,Mon Dec 16 05:25:01 2013 UTC,The first contact was the crown of the blockers helmet to the head/neck area of a defenseless player. http://i.imgur.com/NZ5fC0W.jpg  The blocker even launches at/through him. This is the textbook definition of targeting.
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,baconhead,7,Mon Dec 16 06:42:48 2013 UTC,...he lead with his arms? Are we looking at the same gif?
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,StracciMagnus,1 point,Mon Dec 16 06:40:56 2013 UTC,You don't lay out a big hit on a punter when a simple block will do.
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,JCMB,-1,Mon Dec 16 06:36:21 2013 UTC,"you've never actually played football, have you?  I did for many years, and when you get a chance to make a big hit, you take it.  Its even better if it's a position player (QB, kicker, or DB) that isn't used to, or doesn't like being hit."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,alphadelt,0,Mon Dec 16 15:07:23 2013 UTC,"Football is fast, and I don't know that guys are consciously aware on big-play runbacks that the punter is the punter.  Let's give them different jerseys while were at it."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,OleicAcid,11,Mon Dec 16 17:18:26 2013 UTC,"I know it's football and it's all about being a badass and yadda yadda.  But the dude was a punter who probably couldn't tackle the guy even if he was a yard away.   I totally understand the 'sending a message' thing, but now this guy's gonna need facial reconstruction surgery because some linebacker had to go all gung-ho on a punter.  What a big man he is.  I hope he brags about that sweet hit later that he laid down on the unassuming punter.  **EDIT The punter is now out for the rest of the season with cracked neck vertebrate and a dislocated jaw."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,AkilesOfCydonia,9,Mon Dec 16 05:40:09 2013 UTC,"I don't think it has anything to do with 'sending a message.' The ball carrier was running up the field towards the blocker and defender. Brown's teammate proceeded to block a would be tackler. Also, the punter is a football player just like everyone else on the field; he signed up knowing the risks involved."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,has_six_fingers,3,Mon Dec 16 18:14:29 2013 UTC,"Not defending the hit, only punters.  Here is Pat Mcaffee laying the boom on a returner."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,baconhead,0,Mon Dec 16 18:48:43 2013 UTC,And the punter wasn't even looking. Really shitty play right here.
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,flapsfisher,-2,Mon Dec 16 06:39:59 2013 UTC,"a shitty play on the punter?  I agree.  Seriously, every single professional football player has played long enough to know ""head on a swivel"".   Fuck, I know that shit and I never made it out of jr league.  You'd have to be a moron to run toward the football as a tackler and expect NOT to be ""targeted"" by a 220 pound, 4.6 running, professional football player trying his ass off to get his team into the playoffs in a win or die game against a top rival.  The scenario in this game is ALWAYS going to lead to big hits and you have this punter frolicking down the middle of a field thinking he's going to tackle a punt returner?  What a fucking idgit.  People, this is the nfl.  It's brutal and always has been brutal.  You dont want to get hit like that punter was hit?  Two things....either don't run toward the football, or don't play."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,bwill05,-1,Thu Dec 19 12:34:33 2013 UTC,"Dude gets paid millions to be on the field 5-10 times per game, they are fully aware of the violent nature of the sport.  Its football, the guy laying out the poor unassuming punter was doing his job. Just like punter was attempting to do his, which one he kicks the ball, is to be just another player on special teams trying to make a play."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,OleicAcid,-1,Mon Dec 16 20:17:25 2013 UTC,"Are you trying to tell me that the blocker couldn't have done his job the exact some way without leading with the crown of his helmet into the unassuming chin of the least prepared player on the field?  He literally could have just bumped into the guy.  Heck, if he had put his shoulder into the punter's chest and destroyed him that way, I wouldn't have been angry."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,bwill05,2,Mon Dec 16 20:28:37 2013 UTC,"That guy doesn't devote his life to keeping his body in good enough condition to play in the NFL to go out and ""bump"" people. Plus he's a special teams player, so plays like that could be the difference in keeping him on the team or being without a job. If it was an illegal tackle it will be reviewed by the league office and he'll be fined for it. If he doesn't want to get hit, he got into the wrong sport."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,OleicAcid,-1,Mon Dec 16 21:20:42 2013 UTC,"There's a difference between putting a solid hit on a man that takes him out of a play and decapitating a hapless punter.  I think he likely will be fined, seeing as he lead with the crown of his helmet and hit him in the neck area."
HighlightGIFS,1szdxe,AkilesOfCydonia,2,Mon Dec 16 21:30:36 2013 UTC,The play wasn't dirty. Antonio Brown is running in the direction of the would be tackler and his teammate blocks the punter. The punter is a football player and will take hits every so often just like every player on the field.

HighlightGIFS,1sxjsl,Halefire,3,Sun Dec 15 17:03:21 2013 UTC,"One thing I can't help but wonder when I watch a rugby video/gif is how on earth there aren't injuries all the damn time. These guys are enormous and are blasting into each other sometimes with what I imagine must be immense force.   I know they're not crashing into each other like in American football but still...there's no protection at all and they're diving, sliding, tumbling, etc and barely bat an eye"
HighlightGIFS,1sxjsl,real_nice_guy,2,Sun Dec 15 18:31:12 2013 UTC,"They condition their bodies to cope with the stresses of the game, and there are tackle laws in place which minimise dangerous collisions:    Must tackle below the neck Must wrap arms (no shoulder charges) Must not tackle a player in the air   etc.  Despite the safeguards injuries do often occur - it's a rough game."
HighlightGIFS,1sxjsl,real_nice_guy,3,Mon Dec 16 13:50:26 2013 UTC,"Excellent question.  First of all, it would be a disadvantage for the player tackling to tackle someone else in a harmful way, because it will often times hurt them too. For example, tackling them too hard, even the correct way, can result in clavicle fracture and shoulder dislocation/separation. Also, because rugby doesn't constantly stop, if you do tackle someone else hard enough to injury them, you're going to go down too, and those few seconds that you're down, and not up again with your team, could mean the difference between a try and not getting one.   Secondly, one of the easiest ways to stop someone running is to tackle them somewhere nearer their feet (without getting their spikes in your face) but not tackling their actual feet, so the runner will end up just falling pretty harmlessly most times and easily (unless they have more powerful legs than the tackler's upper-strength and coordination can handle, then they'll just shake them loose and keep on running). If they tackle is to the mid section, this just take a little more strength to bring them down.  Thirdly, most of the guys are pretty thick and incredibly strong.  Fourthly, most of the guys will have been playing rugby since they were scrawny 8 year olds, all the way through their awkward reedy teen years until they hit the 16/17/18 year old stage and then began to really beef up, so they know how to take a hit without too much damage, and they also know how to tackle someone else, if they are able to, without harming them. There isn't any pride in smashing someone as hard as you can, it's all about being as quick with your feet and hands if possible.   One of the worst types of tackle, and one that happened to me once and resulted in a really awful injury, is the tap tackle, which means you're ahead of someone, but they can't catch up, so they dive and just hit your foo/anklet, so as that foot goes down, it lands awkwardly, and bad things can happen. Same with shirt pulling, it's just not sportsman like but people do it from time to time. I think someone did that in one of the gifs."

HighlightGIFS,1s0wy6,MangoesOfMordor,2,Wed Dec 4 06:45:38 2013 UTC,"Yeah i figured.  My point was that strategies that work in Rugby don't work in Football, and vice-versa.

HighlightGIFS,1s0wy6,JoDoStaffShow,0,Tue Dec 3 23:22:32 2013 UTC,If there is an overlap man with the ball is your primary concern.
HighlightGIFS,1s0wy6,SwolberhamLincoln,5,Wed Dec 4 04:32:34 2013 UTC,"That's might be the case if it was 3 on 2 or 4 on 2, but here it was 2 on 2. Cooper was Halfpenny's man. 14 trusted his inside man to make the tackle and keyed on 11 like he was supposed to do. If he would have collapsed and tried for a double tackle, Cooper would have made an easy offload to 11. It's just a great play by cooper and missed tackle by halfpenny"
HighlightGIFS,1s0wy6,mpg1846,1 point,Wed Dec 4 04:45:25 2013 UTC,"Wouldn't you want to get it out of Cooper's hands though? So hedge towards him like you're gonna double, make him pass and try and recover. Make someone other than that freakishly quick guy beat you."

HighlightGIFS,1rt1pc,tnargsnave,14,Sun Dec 1 23:58:41 2013 UTC,It wasn't just the play. It was the tension built up. The stadium booing the ref's decision. It was so unexpected.

HighlightGIFS,1qc32i,onlyforaminute,2,Mon Nov 11 16:49:06 2013 UTC,I cant throw as far as someone paid to do it professionally and that makes it impressive? By that logic you couldn't have run down the field that fast to get to the end zone so the catch is more impressive.

Either you don't understand what I said in my original post, or you just get your willies off of making replies filled with whatever words you can think of. What you're saying neither agrees nor disagrees with what I originally said, I honesty have no idea why you're replying to me, as you don't make any sense... at least in relation to what I have said.  You tell me its a highlight... I never said it wasn't and I'm certainly aware its a highlight as I'm aware of the subreddit I'm browsing. What I said is that it's not that amazing. I jovially stated that the lackluster ""throw"" where he chunked the ball blindly down the field was more amazing than the catch where he happened to be standing in the right place... and you tell me something about my inability to run down a field.  You seem to think that some phrase I choose to use gives you the right to make an ad hominem attack and implies that I fall into some sort of age group that gives you the right to call me a kid. I can assure you that I probably have grand children that are older than most reddit users, but again I don't see what age has to do with anything I said in my original post.

An ad hominem is when you dismiss someones argument because of some attribute about them (i.e. You're wrong because your face is ugly). I didn't use the word ""kid"" to dismiss your argument.

Are you a foreigner or just really drunk and/or unable to process words?  Read it again, this time very slowly.   If you choose not to read it, I will explain it again, this time in a much shorter manner. You are ignoring and/or lacking comprehension of what I am saying. You aren't replying to what I have said, you seem to be replying to what you think I have said. I have never had someone of such utter incompetency reply to me before. You say one thing, in reference to some point you've made up (that you imagine I said), then contradict it with your own statement again. Its amazing.    Actually I didn't even use it to attack you at all, I just did it to make fun of your word choice of ""on my dick"".   This is the shit I'm talking about... an attack on my choice of words IS an attack on me and therefore an ad hominem attack by definition. Jesus Christ man. I'm actually hoping you can reply again as I know it will be a complete surprise as to what you interpret out of this and how you reply to that interpretation."

HighlightGIFS,1pw1bp,grangry,8,Mon Nov 4 20:56:11 2013 UTC,"Does it really have to be something super skillful to be a highlight?

Everything else about his game is about expected for the level he's on. He's not overwhelmingly fast, his moves can be flashy but so what, really... As an overall player Messi is just leagues better than him, and Neymar is closer to his level."
HighlightGIFS,1pt2mp,x_x_x_x,3,Sun Nov 3 19:44:50 2013 UTC,"Ronaldo has outplayed Messi in the last 8 clasicos he has played. He was champions league top scorer, and is top scorer in La Liga and the UCL this year. Saying Cristiano is overrated is a completely delusional statement, whether you like him or not, you can't deny that on the form he's on, he's hands down the best player in the world. The same can be said for Messi when he's playing extraordinarily well. Neymar, while having played well for 8 games, has done just that, played well for 8 games. There is no way you can say Neymar is closer to Messi's level when he hasn't done it over the course of years of his career. Like I said, he has the potential, and it wouldn't surprise me if he becomes one of the best players of this generation, but Cristiano and Messi are miles ahead of everyone else."

I'm just a guy that likes soccer. That being said, my personal opinion is that the Ronaldo is currently the most valuable player you can have in your team. By far. I kind of dislike him for using his ""influence"" on referees, but every player has done that and will do it in the future. Second to Ronaldo will arguably be Ribery or Iniesta. I'm just being realistic. Messi is a beast who plays brilliant games with his teammates, but Ronaldo.. God damn, he's good. (Also, third spot on my most-valuable-players list is taken by Messi/Ozil/Ibrahimovic..... hmm should I add Xavi there?)"

HighlightGIFS,1pqswg,jzoobz,2,Sat Nov 2 14:03:36 2013 UTC,"Yup! It's usually referred to as a grub kick or grubber. It is one of a few kinds of kicks used in rugby. The only way to pass the ball forward in rugby is by kicking it, and kicks are usually used to break through the line of defenders if no one is covering behind them or to improve field position when your team is deep in their own territory."
HighlightGIFS,1pqswg,Barnstorm111,1 point,Sat Nov 2 14:16:38 2013 UTC,"And regarding the shape, it does affect the bounce a lot but a good grubber kick will tumble end over end which will carry on going straight forwards more often than not. It will however often veer off once the tumble of the ball starts to slow"
HighlightGIFS,1pqswg,ShlawsonSays,1 point,Sat Nov 2 15:53:09 2013 UTC,Its a common Rugby technique. It's called a Grubber kick. It's often used when attacking like this as it's hard for the opposition to regain possession as the ball can be unpredictable.

HighlightGIFS,1peu90,jerryw,4,Tue Oct 29 01:52:23 2013 UTC,"All scoring plays are reviewed. How much time that takes varies significantly. The officials are blowing the play dead on the initial lunge upon ruling a TD, so what happens after that doesn't really matter, the play is over when their whistles blow."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,THEsolid85,1 point,Tue Oct 29 03:23:07 2013 UTC,I'm not so sure about that. I don't think they would have made them replay the down had he not crossed with the initial lunge.   I'm not so sure they even blow their whistle when a TD is scored.
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,onlyforaminute,2,Tue Oct 29 11:11:04 2013 UTC,"What? A play is dead when the ref blows the whistle, nothing that happens after that matters. In the 2008 bronco vs chargers game Jay Cutler fumbled on an attempted pass, which the chargers then recovered. However, the refs were unable to give the chargers the ball. You know why? Because ed hochuli wrongly thought it was a forward pass and blew his whistle a second before the chargers recovered.  Also the refs will blow the whistle at the goal line if they need to signal to the players that the play is dead."

HighlightGIFS,1peu90,SirWilliamScott,35,Mon Oct 28 22:31:30 2013 UTC,"The lions are down by 6. They just got the ball to the one yard line but time is running out and they have no time-outs. Usually in this situation, the QB will spike the ball into the ground as fast as possible to stop the clock and try another play. However, Stafford noticed the defense ""sleeping"" and after he got the ball in his hands he jumped and lunged the ball forward across the goal line ftw."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,HappyAssHippo,18,Mon Oct 28 22:44:34 2013 UTC,"Oh... I'm British... Never watched more than some random clips... But fuck me!  So you're saying that when these American football players throw the ball down over the goal line, it's actually unnecessary?... They just have to carry it past the line?  Before I read your comment I thought the ""fake"" was when he seemed to try and fail to jump over the crowd of players... And then he sneakily went round the side to score..."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Womjack,20,Mon Oct 28 22:53:21 2013 UTC,He scored as soon as he lurched the ball forward over the goal line. When he was rushing everyone up to the line of scrimmage he was motioning to spike the ball (stop the clock) and then it was a fake spike and lurch score. Yep.
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,HappyAssHippo,5,Mon Oct 28 23:34:06 2013 UTC,So if you throw the ball down during play then the clock stops?
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Womjack,15,Tue Oct 29 00:44:15 2013 UTC,It counts as an incomplete pass which stops the clock. The spike has to be intentional and at the line of scrimmage
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,pezdeath,4,Tue Oct 29 00:55:21 2013 UTC,"So if you just drop the ball it's different? And if so, the distinction is based on judgement of the ""throwers"" control as opposed to presence of an intended target...?  Is there ever a time when it's a blurred line?"
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Womjack,8,Tue Oct 29 01:30:32 2013 UTC,"If there is forward movement of the arm and the ""thrower"" (quarterback) is behind the line of scrimage, it will be ruled a pass. If a ball is dropped (fumbled) or stripped it is a live ball which may be picked up by anyone.   The main thing with a spike is that a quarterback will be snapped the ball and immediately upon receiving the ball, spikes it down in front of his feet. If he backs up, is not directly snapped the ball (such as in a shotgun snap), or does something other than direclty spiking the ball he can be called for intentional grounding which is a spot penalty (the ball is moved backwards to the spot of the quarterback spiking the ball).   And there are plenty of times when it is a blurred line which is usually where instant replay comes in.   And if I am not mistaken anytime the ball hits the ground, the clock stops."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,pezdeath,5,Tue Oct 29 01:40:56 2013 UTC,Ah ok so the spike has to be shown to be completely intentional and pre-planned as opposed to a reaction to how the play develops after the scrimmage?  I'm still a bit confused as to why you would do this. Is the clock running when preparing and during the scrimmage?
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Womjack,8,Tue Oct 29 02:10:33 2013 UTC,"The clock is always running unless the ball hits the ground (causing a play to be called dead) or a player goes out of bounds.   The most common times for a ball to be spiked are towards the end of each half (2nd and 4th quarters). When the team is out of time outs and a player caught the ball but did not get out of bounds, the clock is still running. At this point, the team can either quickly run up, set themselves, and run a play or set themselves and spike the ball. Spiking the ball will stop the clock immediately while running a play poses a lot of risks including the players not knowing exactly what play is to be run, having the clock not stop, etc.."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,pezdeath,3,Tue Oct 29 02:17:24 2013 UTC,"Also a ""spike"" is a specialty play in the rule book. Normally you can't just throw the ball down to stop the clock. Passes are supposed to be near an intended target (for the most part*), but special allowance is given to ""spike"" the ball right after the snap with no target to throw to.  *It gets a little more complex than that so if you want to know more let me know, but I left out that information to avoid causing confusion."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Dysalot,4,Tue Oct 29 11:27:32 2013 UTC,I think I understand the principle now. Any more complex details will likely curb my newfound enthusiasm.
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Womjack,6,Tue Oct 29 12:00:33 2013 UTC,"Looks like pezdeath explained the clock rules, but also of note here are scoring rules.  For touchdowns, the only thing that matters is the ball crossing the plane of the goal line while the offensive player is holding it. You can run/pass or whatever to make the ball cross the plane. That's why the quarterback just jumps up and throws his arms out.  The risk here was that if the defense saw what was happening, since that's a vulnerable way to hold the ball, they could have ripped the ball out of the quarterback's hands before it crossed the goal line."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,qweoin,1 point,Tue Oct 29 02:50:56 2013 UTC,Yes. It counts as an incomplete pass which always stops the clock.
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,HappyAssHippo,6,Tue Oct 29 02:08:10 2013 UTC,"I'm guessing that when you say ""throw the ball down over the goal line,"" you are referring to spiking the ball in celebration. When they do that, they play has already ended and they're just being enthusiastic."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,GroupDrink,4,Tue Oct 29 00:16:16 2013 UTC,Yeah it makes so much sense now I think about it
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Womjack,5,Tue Oct 29 00:45:01 2013 UTC,"Rugby requires you to put the ball down, football doesn't- just have to get past the line."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,FUCK_YEAH_BASKETBALL,1 point,Tue Oct 29 00:44:39 2013 UTC,Throwing wasn't even an acceptable part of the rules until the early part of the 20th century... and it was decided in that moment on a coin-toss. You don't even have to run over the line if you can extend the ball past the line while maintaining control.
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,dafragsta,2,Tue Oct 29 14:24:08 2013 UTC,"I'm confused. I thought both feet had to touch the ground inside the endzone for it to be a touchdown.   Nevermind, that must be for passes... I just remembered I've seen guys stretch the ball over the line to get a touchdown."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Static_Line_Bait,6,Mon Oct 28 23:16:34 2013 UTC,"Right. The pass isn't complete (with some exceptions, I think) unless both feet (NFL rules) come down in-bounds and the receiver is determined to have control of the ball. I believe there is an exception when a defender pushes the receiver out of bounds in mid-air, but I could be wrong."
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Kitchens491,2,Mon Oct 28 23:31:39 2013 UTC,You need two feet in bounds for it to be a catch regardless of if the defender pushes you out
HighlightGIFS,1peu90,Dysalot,1 point,Tue Oct 29 00:44:48 2013 UTC,"In the NFL if you would have come down in bounds (by decision of the ref) and you are pushed out before landing it is a complete pass. Never mind, rule was changed in 2008, it was never a call I saw in action anyway, just one of those it exists rules.  In college it remains an incomplete pass."

HighlightGIFS,1pb9o4,JoDoStaffShow,1 point,Mon Oct 28 17:20:00 2013 UTC,"Except in American football obstruction is legal. So when you see a highlight of rugby you can't understand that its incredibly hard to side step and tackle man on man, without the help from your team mates and without taking a break every minute. Makes rugby better and AF lame. AF players can't tackle either, they just run into each other."
HighlightGIFS,1pb9o4,compto35,2,Tue Oct 29 06:30:45 2013 UTC,"American football players can't tackle? Most tackles in every game are 1 on 1 where the runner is wrapped up by the defense. The only time they don't tackle correctly is when they go for huge, injury inducing hits.  And what do you mean obstruction isn't legal? Like the offense blocking for the runner? That makes American football more tactical since formations matter and every block is important on the smaller field, and Rugby a bunch of dudes just running around with a ball.   Nevermind the fact that every side step I've seen a rugby player do on this sub is telegraphed worse than a middle school football team.

Barehanded catches are pretty difficult (usually use a glove) and catching it at the mound takes very good reflexes since it's so close to the hitter (moving very fast at that point).

HighlightGIFS,1p7f1q,EmeraldRaccoon,1 point,Fri Oct 25 22:00:39 2013 UTC,To clear it up...The ball is often going to travel forward when both players are travelling in that direction but as long as it leaves the players hands in a flat or backward direction the pass is fine.  This is one hell of a pass and the reason I love watching Cooper.

HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,teh_hasay,28,Mon Oct 21 10:27:44 2013 UTC,If he had waited any longer he'd be lucky to not clip the long snapper in the head on the way over.  Great idea though.  No way to get that kick off if he clears the line.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,indoninjah,8,Mon Oct 21 14:04:40 2013 UTC,I don't think so. I think long snappers usually just keep their heads down because they so often get blown up if they try blocking. It's why nobody is allowed to line up directly across from them.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,e8odie,36,Mon Oct 21 22:00:59 2013 UTC,That is just insanely intimidating.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,keyNONE,16,Mon Oct 21 14:00:11 2013 UTC,What keeps him from trying over and over gain?
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,GameFace92,12,Mon Oct 21 14:10:09 2013 UTC,They know its coming.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,THEsolid85,6,Mon Oct 21 17:17:23 2013 UTC,Risk of injury. Not being a dick. It only works because of the element of surprise. He tries it again and he gets flipped like a rag doll. And also because it's half the distance to the goal each time he fucks up. Once more and they might decide it's close enough to go for 2.  I don't believe there's sufficient evidence to say he would get called for unsportsmanlike conduct or even delay of game. It would never come to that anyway because of the reasons above.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,n8wolf,15,Tue Oct 22 02:47:11 2013 UTC,"Unsportsmanlike conduct, delay of game, fines...  Not much other than some 5 or 15 yard penalties and ""the spirit of the game."""
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,COto503,18,Mon Oct 21 15:00:20 2013 UTC,"""Unsportsmanlike conduct, delay of game, fines...""  To my my knowledge none of these things would necessarily result from repeated offsides penalties.  Not positive though."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,RsonW,4,Mon Oct 21 16:13:07 2013 UTC,"Yeah, they'd just get closer and closer to the endzone. If he kept doing it, the kicking team would probably just go for a fake."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,taiwanterror,9,Mon Oct 21 16:50:24 2013 UTC,No actually they assess the penalty on the kickoff.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,Z504,6,Mon Oct 21 19:17:04 2013 UTC,"Not if they don't want to. In this game the extra point tied the game, if the ravens wanted to they could have moved closer to the endzone and then tried to go for a 2pt conversion for a win, but that's one of those plays were if they get it the coach is a genius if they miss it the coach is an idiot and should be fired."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,THEsolid85,2,Mon Oct 21 21:06:45 2013 UTC,"No, when it interrupts the play like this then it's applied to the PAT. There's no play, in order for it to apply to the kickoff the try has to be successful and it was never attempted. Half the distance to the goal and retry."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,Peace_Unleashed,5,Tue Oct 22 02:45:09 2013 UTC,"Wouldn't that be a penalty for lining up opposite the long snapper, even if he had timed it right?"
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,Im-in-dublin,4,Mon Oct 21 17:16:17 2013 UTC,Not exactly because he is in the safety/Linebacker position rather than alongside the other defensive linemen.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,griffy013,7,Tue Oct 22 04:25:25 2013 UTC,"So if he would've done that like two seconds later he could've legally tackled the shit out the guy? How could his plan have worked, is it legal?"
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,dakoellis,50,Mon Oct 21 17:05:14 2013 UTC,"Yes, it's legal.  And it works.  Here is a gif of the same player, except this is against the offense instead of special teams.  http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/3181615/polamaluHOF.gif"

HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,BJEdwards,5,Tue Oct 22 11:23:40 2013 UTC,"It's not legal to line up opposite a long snapper.  The defender's pads must be outside of the long snapper's pads.  It's hard to tell, but I think he went right over the long snapper, but I don't know if that counts as lining up over the long snapper."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,stillakilla,1 point,Mon Oct 21 17:22:50 2013 UTC,Why?
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,stillakilla,2,Tue Oct 22 01:11:16 2013 UTC,"Why is it a foul?   Safety, I guess.  It's been like that on punts for a while.  I think they extended it to field goals and extra points this year.  There was another rule against overloading one side of the line on field goals as well."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,BJEdwards,2,Tue Oct 22 03:43:13 2013 UTC,"Its similar to the whole defenseless receiver thing that's become the catch phrase the past couple of years. Long snapping is different from snapping the ball like a regular center would. He's not as well positioned to defend himself in blocking. I think their legs are spread a little wider, and their head is down more, since they're watching for a signal to snap."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,stillakilla,2,Tue Oct 22 08:36:02 2013 UTC,"What would be considered good timing in regards to this snap? Would it be where the ball leaves the snappers hands, or is caught?   Like say Polamalu was right behind the ball as it was flying back, would have have not counted as a penalty? Or does it have to reach the holder before someone cross the line of scrimmage?"
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,motocyclisme,4,Mon Oct 21 17:32:46 2013 UTC,All he would have had to do was not cross the line of scrimmage before the ball was snapped. As it happened he was flying somewhere in line with the snappers shoulders/back when the play began. He was only offsides by about a foot or so.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,MisallocatedRacism,2,Mon Oct 21 17:56:56 2013 UTC,"Looking at the gif more carefully, that makes sense.  Has he ever successfully done this? Has anyone?"
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,n8wolf,9,Mon Oct 21 18:04:12 2013 UTC,"He's done something very similar to this against offenses multiple times, but I don't think he or anyone else has ever even attempted anything quite like this against a field goal unit before. Troy has made a career out of incredible plays that don't seem humanly possible. He's worked himself into a unique position so that Dick Lebau, the defensive coordinator just kind of lets him do what he wants, and over the years he's just gotten a little more creative with his freedom."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,refrigeratorbob,2,Mon Oct 21 19:00:38 2013 UTC,"I could see the league making this illegal, either with a specific rule or modifying the one about lining up over the long snapper. If Polamalu screws up and doesn't get as much air, or is later rather than earlier as the long snapper starts to stand up, he could knee him right in the head. The long snapper is already some what protected, due to them being in a more vulnerable position (head down, legs more spread I think).  And at least when and where I played in high school, it was illegal to hurdle a player because of the risk of hitting the guy in the head, as well as for what can happen when you leave your feet.  As for Polamalu doing it against the offense, I think he'll be fine. Those are more of dives to get the QB or RB right at the line than the hurdle you see here, and the linemen aren't considered in such a vulnerable situation."

HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,n8wolf,19,Mon Oct 21 14:38:07 2013 UTC,"Not in the slightest.  As long as you don't pass the line of scrimmage before the snap.  Polamalu had a similar play where he took down the running back within half a second of the snap.  For a while now, he's been the best at timing snap counts and play clocks to make sure he's moving at full speed toward the ball once it's snapped."
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,dakoellis,5,Mon Oct 21 15:05:35 2013 UTC,You are thinking of 'leaping' which is using a teammate for leverage.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,GreenerThanYou,1 point,Tue Oct 22 07:46:51 2013 UTC,Or the long snapper hiked the ball after he jumped over.
HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,griffy013,1 point,Mon Oct 21 20:04:49 2013 UTC,"Not hard to judge a visual cadence. Still pretty bold. In the NFL though when things are constantly judged by tenths of a second, he was pretty far offsides. Most offsides, at least by DLinemen, are much, much closer."

HighlightGIFS,1ow6cz,GreenerThanYou,17,Mon Oct 21 13:01:07 2013 UTC,I believe it was encroachment (he came in contact with another player in the neutral zone before the snap)  edit: offsides doesn't stop play.  encroachment does.

HighlightGIFS,1nd4t8,dakoellis,6,Sun Sep 29 17:17:23 2013 UTC,"Someone else can probably explain it better but in the early days of rugby union when you planted the ball in-goal (in your endzone) you didn't actually score any points, but you were given a ''try'' at kicking a goal. Obviously the rules changed and you now get 5 points for a try in union and 4 in league and you also get a chance at a conversion, which is worth 2 points in both codes. The terminology carried over when rugby league was invented."

HighlightGIFS,1nd4t8,sterlinglock,2,Sun Sep 29 11:12:06 2013 UTC,So I'm not up on the rules of rugby. I know you have to touch the turf with the ball (is that what it's called?)  but what happens if you lose control of it before crossing into the goal area?
HighlightGIFS,1nd4t8,dakoellis,2,Sun Sep 29 16:12:28 2013 UTC,"If you drop the ball forward (As in, towards your try line), the opposition is given the chance to place the ball into a scrum (basically just all the fat guys pushing against eachother) and they try and contest to see who can get the ball to come out their end. However in rugby league it's basically just a changeover if you drop it forward because the scrums aren't contested."
HighlightGIFS,1nd4t8,Ajinho,1 point,Sun Sep 29 22:33:37 2013 UTC,is it not contested because of player safety?
HighlightGIFS,1nd4t8,fernta,4,Mon Sep 30 05:58:49 2013 UTC,"They just wanted a different dynamic to the game. The rugby union scrum is sort of like a horizontal squat, so the best guys at scrummaging are built like powerlifters or offensive linemen. They are huge, powerful guys but quite cumbersome and slow around the field.  In league they wanted the game to be faster and more athletic. So by taking out the scrum, the advantage of having big slow guys is taken away. That makes it so that all of the players are big but also fast, built like linebackers."

So Emirates Team New Zealand started the regatta up two races, and subsequently ended up 8 wins to 1 (really three) on Team USA. Then Team USA completely turned things around and won 8 races in a row to win the regatta, an unheard of comeback.   Also, there is only one American on Team USA."

HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,iamoz,1 point,Fri Sep 27 03:58:33 2013 UTC,"The America's Cup is held once every three years in the location the previous winner chooses. So Team USA won in 2010 so they sailed on San Francisco, and the won again so the regatta will be somewhere in the US in 2016. The winner also chooses which type of boat is sailed, which this year caused some controversy, because the boats were so expensive almost no one could afford to race in the regatta making for limited competition for Teams USA and New Zealand."
HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,uprootsockman,1 point,Fri Sep 27 18:03:59 2013 UTC,"i think the winner chooses the location, anywhere in the world. doesn't have to be their home country. and it's not run every 3 years... more like 3-5, depending on who wants to do what."

HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,alfonsoelsabio,8,Thu Sep 26 02:31:34 2013 UTC,So here's how little I know about yacht racing...why would their paths ever be perpendicular?
HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,RichieMcCaw,11,Thu Sep 26 02:48:49 2013 UTC,Sailing into the wind they have to tack which means sail as close to the wind direction as they can. Oracle gave way to tnz because they were on starboard (right) tack and tnz was on port(left) tack.
HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,IAmAHat_AMAA,3,Thu Sep 26 02:57:01 2013 UTC,So are they like weaving helically sinusoidally down the course?  Is course even the right word?
HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,IAmAHat_AMAA,3,Thu Sep 26 02:59:07 2013 UTC,Yep. Wind would be the x axis. Course is the correct term.
HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,RichieMcCaw,3,Thu Sep 26 05:21:20 2013 UTC,Nah it would be more like a triangle wave. You'd want to minimize any time pointing directly into the wind.
HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,CitizenPremier,2,Thu Sep 26 07:05:22 2013 UTC,"But Oracle's on starboard tack and TNZ's on port. I think this must be wiindward rule, but its really hard to tell."

HighlightGIFS,1n5bkt,rickjamesbeach,3,Thu Sep 26 04:24:24 2013 UTC,"about 5 years ago. It was in a race between alinghi and Oracle (one of the teams in the above gif) Oracle challenged every decision and had the charter reverted to the original (Rules are complicated for AC, i can explain but it will wall of text) so both teams built multihulled boats, alinghi opted for a trimaran (three hulls)  with a spinnaker (a kind of sail) the size of a baseball diamond, Oracle built a hydrofoiling (means it rests on those blade things instead of the hull) catamaran (two hulls) with a solid carbon fibre wing instead of a sail. The races are usually fairly close but in the first race of this series Oracle beat alinghi round the first mark by 2 kilometre and won 9 in a row to win the series, and ever since then the designs have been in that vein. Amazing sport, and the broadcast this year has been phenomenal"

New Zealand had the same opportunities but chose to continue with what won them the first 8 races. New Zealand failed to adapt and it cost them"

HighlightGIFS,1loqdr,CrispyButtNug,7,Wed Sep 4 21:17:04 2013 UTC,"Well he couldn't hit it on the ground or else it'd be stopped, so instead he needed to get it over. Why doesn't he just chip it, you ask, well a chip would not achieve the front spin necessary to drop onto his teammates foot like that, nor would it keep the necessary speed. Above all of that, striking the ball like he did to get it to bounce like that is extremely advanced ball control. I've literally never ever seen it done in real life."
HighlightGIFS,1loqdr,FlockFlow,5,Wed Sep 4 22:57:08 2013 UTC,"He's basically doing a difficult pass at full game speed, and leading his teammate who is making a run.

HighlightGIFS,1loqdr,BabyEatin_Dingo,2,Wed Sep 4 21:52:46 2013 UTC,"If you look closely you'll see he is striking the ball downwards into the turf to create a lofted pass that travels up and down quicker than a chipped or scooped pass (that would hang in the air longer).

I think the goal line thing is for increased accuracy and won't effect GPM.  The new goalie rule would seem to want to speed up play, decrease defensive options... overall a change for more offense.  I just like the breaking soccer ball (as in breaking ball in baseball) because I like watching a junk baller more than a power pitcher."

However, when your team just drafter one of the top QBs in the draft, and there has been no certainty of your starting, extra effort is much appreciated. More so after a play like that.  3) That being said, Marky Mark will still most likely be the starter come the beginning of the season. Geno is good, but still has a long way to go and could greatly improve with a season on the bench. Also, it's obvious the Jets are in need of re-building. No need to throw your star QB out there when there aren't any playoff expectations."

Most times this is just on serves (so you can't have your paddle below the table or behind your back to hide what angle you'll be approaching the ball) but he's most likely just hoping there was something illegal about it.

HighlightGIFS,1jpvut,dizzle18,10,Mon Aug 5 08:53:25 2013 UTC,Not really. For example if you are playing soccer and it bounces off a fence out of play then back into play it is still out of play. If you fumble a ball in football and it hits a yard marker but bounce back into the field then its still out of play. Seems like a basic sports rule.

HighlightGIFS,1jpvut,wild-bill,1 point,Tue Aug 6 01:05:01 2013 UTC,That's not true. Foul is based on where the ball was when the fielder made contact. It looks like it might be a fair ball but it's hard to tell from this angle
HighlightGIFS,1jm3qw,pcgamertemp,29,Sat Aug 3 05:51:42 2013 UTC,"Interesting bit of trivia about this play: the fielder couldn't throw the ball back to the diamond until he had climbed back over the wall. If he had thrown it when he was still in the stands, it would have been considered a home run, as he didn't retain possession while out of play. The runner on first had free reign to run while the fielder struggled.  Edit: typo."
HighlightGIFS,1jm3qw,A_Film_Major,1 point,Sat Aug 3 08:48:50 2013 UTC,"a very late reply, but does that apply to catching foul balls as well?

HighlightGIFS,1jm3qw,cmdrxander,10,Sat Aug 3 09:51:10 2013 UTC,"That's different to cricket then. In cricket, if any part of the fielder touches the rope or the ground past the rope while they're touching the ball, it's a boundary."
HighlightGIFS,1jm3qw,WE_KILL_THE_BAT_MAN,13,Sat Aug 3 10:11:21 2013 UTC,"So if the fielder jumped over the boundary, caught the ball and managed to throw it before landing, that's fine?"

HighlightGIFS,1jm3qw,cmdrxander,2,Sat Aug 3 15:47:24 2013 UTC,"That's a bad example. He's out of bounds when he hits the ball a second time. I don't know the specific rules but any other sport you have to re-establish being in bounds, otherwise the ball is out when you touch it. Jumping up from the ground shouldn't make a difference.  That's like an outfielder missing the catch and hitting it into the stands, then climbing into the stands and then catching that homerun."

I'm not saying he isn't talented, I just think there are so many better rugby moments than a dude stiff arming a guy and then getting tackled."
HighlightGIFS,1jm7qd,compto35,6,Sat Aug 3 21:15:36 2013 UTC,"I have indeed played both. You make it sound very trivial to do these things…especially when you're running full-bore in a game where everyone is of professional caliber. Timing and placement are still bloody well difficult to manage, and to have the presence of mind to actually toss the ball behind him like that right to his mate? A sign of a really great player is to make very difficult things look easy.   My ass that wasn't spectacular."
HighlightGIFS,1jm7qd,TJMilkshake,-4,Sat Aug 3 22:03:21 2013 UTC,"Again, I'm not saying he's not good I'm saying that there are WAY more exciting and skillful plays than this.

HighlightGIFS,1jm7qd,TJMilkshake,3,Sat Aug 3 22:33:56 2013 UTC,"Have you ever played rugby? Obviously the act of handing off isn't hard, but he's handing off professional, even international rugby players. You also missed his sidestep and ridiculous reverse offload to set up a try."
HighlightGIFS,1jm7qd,TJMilkshake,-5,Sat Aug 3 22:06:46 2013 UTC,"What sidestep? I only see him breaking the tackle of a much small defender. Also if you have any awareness at all you could make that pitch. Yes it's a good play, is it HighlightGIF worthy? Probably not."
HighlightGIFS,1jm7qd,sterlinglock,2,Sat Aug 3 22:23:55 2013 UTC,I said sidestep because it's a simple explanation and I assume you don't play rugby - his angles of running were excellent.
HighlightGIFS,1jm7qd,TJMilkshake,0,Sat Aug 3 22:43:49 2013 UTC,"I have played rugby and football, and while they were good, that's incredibly fundamental. Running angles don't make a highlight."

HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,davo_nz,18,Mon Jul 29 11:54:32 2013 UTC,"Just for people unfamiliar with Rugby League, if any part of his body, or the ball had touched the sideline, it would have been no try.  This is absolute pinpoint stuff, especially in mid-air at speed."
HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,adomental,7,Mon Jul 29 12:22:06 2013 UTC,"Had he not scored would it have been a penalty try? The guy just pushed him out while in the air, without any semblance of a tackle, seems pretty illegal to me?"
HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,ruzmutuz,7,Mon Jul 29 13:00:13 2013 UTC,"That's a good point. You can't tackle a player when they are in mid-air, although you can collide so long as you are both making a play to catch the ball.  Penalty tries are rare though. They only award them if there is no doubt the player would have scored if not for being taken out."
HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,adomental,3,Mon Jul 29 13:09:28 2013 UTC,Yeah I suppose a penalty trie is probably a bit far isn't it. I definitely think something should have happened to the offending player had the scorer not actually scored - could have been a nasty injury!
HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,ruzmutuz,1 point,Mon Jul 29 13:34:01 2013 UTC,"What happened is the definition of ""would have scored if not for being taken out."" He was jumping into the endzone box thing!"

HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,davo_the_uninformed,3,Mon Jul 29 13:05:36 2013 UTC,"Actually, tackling a defending player in the air is illegal. An attacking player can be tackled in the air provided they are not put in a dangerous position, which he wasn't in this gif (never got past horizontal, etc)."
HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,weapon_VII,2,Mon Jul 29 14:06:31 2013 UTC,NRL Rules:  Mid-airtackle 1. (b) It is illegal to tackle an opposing player attempting to field a kick whilst the player is in mid-air. The catcher must have returned to the ground before being tackled.
HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,2bfersher,2,Mon Jul 29 14:11:02 2013 UTC,"I'm sorry but he is right. I have seen it called many times, a defender is allowed to tackle an attacking player in the air, otherwise a defender would have no hope at stopping a try once a bomb was caught. The most recent example was in the Sea Eagles vs Titans game, David Mead tackled Jorge Taufua."
HighlightGIFS,1j9rvh,icu_,2,Tue Jul 30 00:14:11 2013 UTC,I thought in League you could tackle people in the air? I guess that applies for both Union and League.

HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,VideoLinkBot,-9,Thu Jul 25 22:22:21 2013 UTC,"(In reference to the discussion from where this link came)  Cricket is very similar to a Martial Art... If you've ever watched The Last Samurai film with Tom Cruise, then you'll probably know what I'm referring to...  Imagine the BALL as an attacking weapon and the BAT as a defensive weapon...    BATTER:   Weapon = A thin narrow piece of willow (wood). Protection = Leg Pads, Gloves, Helmet.   Must choose between...   Defending himself 1 2 Defending his wickets (aka 'Stumps') 1and a BAD EXAMPLE Counter-Attacking! 1     BOWLER: Eg.1 Has the option to aim for the batters head/body or the the 3 stumps he is also trying to protect!  Weapon = 160g solid red ball. Can kill/injure! Top speed 95mph Protection = A wicket keeper and 9 other fielders   Must mainly choose between the following 3 techniques...   Attack the Batter! (Hoping the batter mistimes their defence, thus offering a catching opportunity) Attack (hit) the stumps (Most direct route) Even if the batters leg gets in the way you succeed. Disguise an attack as a counter-attacking opportunity. Then outwitting the batter with the help of strategic defensive fielder placements.)     The bowling side are considered to be at an advantage due to the batter only having 0.7 seconds to decide upon (and execute) the 'manoeuvre'!   The bowler will desperately try to outwit or outpace the batter. Every victim is a 'scalp' from the 'defenders army'!  Add the points (run scoring); a few other minor rules; a reversal of play (role switch) and you've got yourself a sport/martial art called CRICKET!"
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,6,Thu Jul 25 17:20:16 2013 UTC,"Baseball player here...Basically everything you said is also found in baseball. However, the baseball can be thrown at a batter at 105mph , the batters only wear a helmet and sometimes an ankle guard as protection, and we get to swing a thin cylinder rather than wide willow-paddle. And saying ""Baseball is to cricket, what checkers is to chess"" simply isn't true in that both are just a strategic, mental games as the other."
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,toowhiteforblack,0,Thu Jul 25 21:48:00 2013 UTC,everything you said is also found in baseball   So can you try to 'kill' the batter with a bodyline or bouncer?
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,4,Thu Jul 25 21:57:28 2013 UTC,"That's not really the point of baseball. The point is to throw the ball PAST him, not at him. The sports are different, and just because cricket is more violent than baseball doesn't mean it's better."
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,mpavlofsky,-7,Thu Jul 25 22:27:21 2013 UTC,"I've never stated 'one is better than the other'? It's just that cricket is without a doubt, definitely more technical and strategical than baseball..."
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,3,Thu Jul 25 22:43:38 2013 UTC,"We made it so that if you hit the batter with a baseball, you are at a disadvantage. He gets to walk a free base.  How does that make cricket more strategic? It just endangers the safety of the batter."

HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,-1,Fri Jul 26 07:17:31 2013 UTC,"Yes. It's called a dustoff pitch. There's usually a big fucking fight afterwards. Earlier this year a pitcher got his collarbone broken in a fight after hitting a guy who likes to scrap.  And on a side note, Its pretty obvious that you know jack shit about baseball yet you still seem pretty confident that it is inferior to cricket in every way, shape, and form. I came back to this thread in hopes of seeing a nice little discussion about cricket and baseball but I guess not. Maybe if you did a little more reading on how baseball and cricket are similar and a little less preaching about how cricket is ""like chess"", people wouldn't be calling you an elitist and you wouldn't have been downvoted each of the five or so times you posted this biased little rant of yours."
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,DroopyMcCool,6,Fri Jul 26 01:43:17 2013 UTC,I think you're understating what goes on during a baseball at-bat just a little bit.

HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,6,Thu Jul 25 18:36:12 2013 UTC,"Baseball is to cricket, what checkers is to chess.  I thought your post was reasonable until this line. Your comment reeks of elitism. As does your sport."
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,StationaryNomad,12,Thu Jul 25 20:27:05 2013 UTC,"to be fair, modern baseball was heavily influenced by cricket, but was designed to be shorter, and employ less long term strategy in favour of more exciting plays."
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,flamingtangerine,3,Thu Jul 25 20:39:43 2013 UTC,I didn't mean to sound elitist... I still enjoy playing checkers. It's just that chess is more technical and strategical.
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,3,Thu Jul 25 21:04:03 2013 UTC,"Where is your comparison? I just see a bunch of metaphors concerning one sport, and a single sweeping statement about the other.  Could you compare the differences in speed, primarily of the ball, between the two games, or explain what experience you have with trying to hit a fork ball with intent to keep it grounded, and the difficulties involved in such? If I were making similes, I'd say that croquet is to golf what cricket is to baseball, but I know it would be an unfair comparison because each sport has particular, impressive nuances.  0.7 seconds can also be applied to a pitch in baseball. For some reason, I don't think you have ever felt the difference between an 80mph knuckle ball, a 94mph slider, and a 102mph fast ball.  *strategic"
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,merrickx,-2,Thu Jul 25 21:47:08 2013 UTC,"I mention the weight of the ball and the top speed above... BTW: Why would you want to keep a baseball grounded? Also, how many different styles of pitching a baseball are there?"
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,2,Thu Jul 25 21:51:56 2013 UTC,"You mention the weight and top speed of cricket, and don't compare any of it to baseball. Pitches and hits in cricket yield much slower speeds, which is also why the field is so much smaller, and IIRC the balls weigh the same.  Baseball pitches:  some another some more  ...and others. I'm not sure you've ever actually watch a ball completely flutter and change direction in-air from a batters perspective.  One would want to keep the ball grounded because putting it in the air, with certain pitches etc., would make for an easy catch most of the time. There is a relatively narrow funnel in which the batter can hit the ball, and he has to do so in a way that keeps the ball from being fielded too quickly.  edit: this is what a perfectly spinless knuckle ball looks like lol"
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,merrickx,2,Thu Jul 25 21:56:51 2013 UTC,What's a 'Changeup' do?
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,2,Thu Jul 25 22:03:52 2013 UTC,"Actually, that first link is a horrible example, but a changeup is just typically throwing a ball much slower. Some pitchers do it very well by appearing to throw the ball at full speed (body is making all the same motions), but the ball leaves the pitcher going much slower, often causing batters to hesitate or swing far too early altogether.  When a batter goes up against someone who's been pitching 96mph fast balls all day, striking people out along the way, a changeup, while pretty simple, can mess up a lot of batters pretty bad. Batting style, skill and preference, vs. pitcher's specialties kind of determine how well someone might do at bat. If you've got a pitcher that likes to throw to the inside, he might have a hard time striking out a switch hitter (left-handed batter)."
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,merrickx,2,Thu Jul 25 22:11:17 2013 UTC,"Is there any benefit to shining a particular side to a baseball? Ie. Does it swing more?  How much effect does the seam have? In cricket we rely a lot on shining one side of the ball, like here"
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,gripmyhand,2,Thu Jul 25 22:14:17 2013 UTC,I'm not sure what you're referring to.
HighlightGIFS,1j0lx4,merrickx,2,Thu Jul 25 22:16:04 2013 UTC,"Ah, okay. The seams and textures on the balls are used in similarly. The seams, and a lot of other factors from the pitchers arm, wrist, grip, and release determine how the ball will move in the air. Some throws can be completely fucking jarring.  It's difficult to see because of the angle and panning of the camer, but I always hated batting at a pitcher that could throw a good knuckle ball."

HighlightGIFS,1iyx4l,peitsad,4,Wed Jul 24 21:25:59 2013 UTC,"Most, if not all, teams no longer use a lollipop man. The chief mechanic aka lollipop man used to have to check that all four wheels were attached (wheelgun guy used to raise his arm to say he was done) and that the pitlane clear, which meant watching five things at once.  Back when they refueled and pitstops took around 10 seconds, this worked fine since the tires change was almost always finished well before the refuelling, but nowadays the teams are going for sub three second stops and this extra thinking time is too long.  Nowadays each wheelgun guy signals his job is done by pushing a button, and the chief mechanic is only responsible for watching the pitlane for oncoming cars (teams can get a penalty for releasing their car too close to oncoming traffic, even if there is no crash). Once all four buttons have been pressed the traffic light (visible in the gif above the car roughly between the two front wheels) changes to green and the driver goes.  Sometimes one of the wheelgun guys will fail to attach the wheelnut properly but press the button anyway (they will drill to the point where pushing the button is automatic, again to save thinking time) and you will see them waving their arms to try and get the chief mechanic to hold the car, but of course he is only watching the road so they go anyway.  The teams have really been pushing to save time in the stops for the last few years, and sometimes I wonder if they have the right level of risk vs reward. In some cases when they're trying to get the car out in front of a rival taking these risks is absolutely justified, but sometimes they have a comfortable gap and can afford to take a second or two longer to make sure the job is done right, but still push the limit. The opposing argument would be because they've trained to do it flat out and to try and go slower might actually increase the chance of making a mistake.  I realise this post has turned into a rambling mess, so I'll leave you with a video of when it all goes wrong (incidentally the same team as the gif with the world record)."

HighlightGIFS,1iu308,iamagainstit,3,Mon Jul 22 21:15:27 2013 UTC,"for those that are unfamiliar with rugby, the kick has to be taken form a point parallel to where it was touched down in the endzone. so the extra points are harder to get when the try was scored along the edges of the field instead of in the middle."

HighlightGIFS,1irhqz,pocketweed,3,Sun Jul 21 19:30:17 2013 UTC,Keeping your eye on the ball is good. It's unusual for two players to be running to catch the ball (usually the defending receiver is stationary). Perhaps he should have been more aware of the oncoming player but it was just unlucky and not well deserved as you seem to think.

In Major League Baseball, players considered five-tool players have included Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Andre Dawson, and Duke Snider, as well as Barry Bonds, and Ken Griffey, Jr. Active players who have been described as possessing the five tools include Carlos Gonzalez, Alex Rodriguez, Mike Trout, Matt Kemp, Carlos Beltran, and Ryan Braun. Baseball Digest has argued that the five-tool-player label is overvalued. However, the five tools continue to be the things professional scouts consider when evaluating young players' potential.   I'm not sure I'd call Puig a true five-tool player; he's made some pretty dumb baserunning mistakes."

If a batter hits the ball and someone makes a mistake in the field, like dropping the ball when they should catch it, it's an ""error,"" but not a ""hit.""  So two walks in a row, plus an error by an outfielder, and a pitcher could be celebrating a ""no hitter"" when the other team still has lots of baserunners and possibly scored runs during the game."

Since each batter will see about 3-4 pitches, the pitcher will will need to throw anywhere between 80-100 pitches in a perfect game.    Pitching professoinal baseball is closer to paper-scissors-rock.  Major League pitchers throw so fast that the human body cannot react fast enough if you start swinging after the ball leaves the pitchers hand.  That means that both the batter and the pitcher need to guess where each other is going to swing/throw.    Perfect games are so rare and special because that means the pitcher has essentially won 80-100 rounds of paper-scissors rock without making single wrong guess or error in execution.  It's pretty awesome."
HighlightGIFS,1i9k0r,Forscyvus,0,Mon Jul 15 01:07:51 2013 UTC,"This is not very true at all.  First, you describe a perfect game, not a no-hitter. Errors and walks are allowed in no-hitters.  Second, double plays allow for games in which there are only three batters per inning but aren't perfect games or even no-hitters.  Third, a batter reacts to a pitch after about a third of its flight. It is not a game of random chance. Batters can punish pitches like hanging sliders because they can read them.  Fourth, perfect games are rare and special because it requires exceptional control and composure from the pitcher for 100 pitches."

He even played as a part owner of the Penguins. Most of what stifled his comeback was bad team management. Not as fruitful of a career as Gretzky, but definitely a lot longer than Bo Jackson got to play. I think Bo was done in 1990?

HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,Daymang,15,Sat Jul 13 05:08:12 2013 UTC,What's the context? Why does everybody look like they are just standing around waiting for the game to start?
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,frotc914,4,Sat Jul 13 13:50:36 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure about footy rules or regulations but from what I knew, players usually held the ball waiting for their teammates to find a better position to receive the ball. I think this is what happened here. While the Essendon player found an open man and trying to blitz-kick it, the Port Adelaide (?) guy realised it and do his flying thing."
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,devito19,3,Sat Jul 13 17:14:07 2013 UTC,"Close. The Essendon guy marked it or got a free kick so play was stopped and he would line up for, what I'm assuming, an easy goal or like you said to kick it to someone real quick. Rather than go back and give everyone a chance to set up."
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,perfsurf,1 point,Sat Jul 13 18:16:46 2013 UTC,Essendon (the guys with the cute sash) got a free or a mark meaning that play stops and they can back up and take a kick. Where that free or mark took place is where the dashingly well skilled Port Adelaide player on the opposition would stand. Everyone was so chilled because they just assumed he would be going back for an easy kick at (assuming) goals. The Essendon guy spun around real quick because he saw someone in a better spot than he was or decided to just have a go at the goals cos that's what some numpties do. The guy on the mark's Spidey Sense tingled and smothered it which is what you can do as long as you don't go over the spot where the mark or free kick occurred. From then it's play resumes and it's anyone's ball.
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,perfsurf,1 point,Sat Jul 13 18:21:47 2013 UTC,It was a free kick and the guy with the ball played on thinking the other guy wasn't concentrating. This was like 3 weeks ago
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,anonadzii,-1,Tue Jul 30 03:28:52 2013 UTC,"Yeah, it's cool to see but I have no idea why it happened.  Was the kicker trying to be a dick and kick the ball into the other players?"
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,stillakilla,6,Sat Jul 13 15:42:46 2013 UTC,"Haha, he baited that perfectly. You can see he was waiting for that to happen by the way he stops and tenses before the kicker even starts his run-up."
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,JobblesYeah,2,Sat Jul 13 08:12:26 2013 UTC,Why did he punt it so far to the left? it seems like that might have been a mistake.
HighlightGIFS,1i7c00,heyitzclint,2,Sat Jul 13 15:43:15 2013 UTC,it's called a 'snap'. You intentionally kick it across your body if you are on a tight angle from the goals or are not facing directly at the goals and want to take a shot at goals quickly. The latter is the most common use of the snap.

HighlightGIFS,1he1u5,My_Socks_Are_Blue,4,Mon Jul 1 19:28:01 2013 UTC,Why do goalies always fall down? Even if they are trying to block a shot right above their head?  edit: two well thought out and presented reasons... am I still on reddit?
HighlightGIFS,1he1u5,hyoorist,15,Mon Jul 1 00:24:22 2013 UTC,"They don't, but it's entirely dependent on the scenario when they do. Goalies will fall down on shots near their bodies, but not directly at them, because it's preferable to have hands and body between the ball and the goal rather than just hands. In this scenario, it looks like Spain's keeper wasn't prepared for the force on the ball (it was an absolute rocket), and his feet were too far spread to make a better effort towards the ball. He may have even misread the shot and first went slightly left, then tried to correct his mistake by shifting his weight to the right, hence the fall. You'll see that right as Neymar shot, the keeper moved his right foot."
HighlightGIFS,1he1u5,Forscyvus,10,Mon Jul 1 02:16:51 2013 UTC,"Blocking a shot like that is largely a guessing game. You have to be very very good at reading players to tell where a shot is being aimed. If you make a read and it's wrong, trying to adjust on the fly can easily put you off balance."

HighlightGIFS,1hd18l,Penfolds_five,7,Sun Jun 30 22:17:30 2013 UTC,To be counted as tackled the opposition player has to have hands on ball carrier while he's on the ground. So if the tackler falls off while the carrier is still ruled to have momentum the tackle is incomplete and he's allowed to play on.

HighlightGIFS,1h7a3s,irrobin,8,Fri Jun 28 01:32:16 2013 UTC,"So in a lineout, the basic objective is to get the ball back in play, preferably to your team. The hooker (fella throwing the ball) has to throw it in the channel created by the two teams.  To throw the opposing team off, the offense may move their jumper to a number of places to make the defense guess where the jump will be. This particular play made the defensive lineout split in two groups to respect the front and back pass, leaving the middle open. All the hooker had to do was float it over the middle for the scrum-half to take. Well executed play.  Tl;dr - Fiji split their lineout in two and left their middle open for a cheeky throw in to the scrum-half.  *Edit: Spelling"

HighlightGIFS,1h7a3s,Bigeasy600,-3,Fri Jun 28 00:11:49 2013 UTC,"American Football came from Rugby. This Rugby play is much like a NFL play in the sense that play does not start until the ball enters the field. It is essentially hiked into play.  The Rugby play is well organized and perfectly executed. The right half of the line separated and split the defense, opening a natural gap the that runner was able to exploit.

HighlightGIFS,1gqtg1,Comments_Sometimes,6,Thu Jun 20 23:21:55 2013 UTC,I don't see what makes you think he's offsides.
HighlightGIFS,1gqtg1,Comments_Sometimes,2,Thu Jun 20 23:25:35 2013 UTC,I thought if you were behind the last defender without the ball or without the ball being passed your way it was offsides.. just tryin to learn
HighlightGIFS,1gqtg1,TJMilkshake,2,Fri Jun 21 00:02:38 2013 UTC,"Haha, it's ok. If you are passed the last defender and have the ball passed UP to you from the back you're offsides. Also, if the ball ricochets off of something like the post or another player and you were ahead of the last defender and you get it, you're offsides. It also is viewed by when the ball is passed or shot, NOT when you receive it."

HighlightGIFS,1go3xi,thombsaway,4,Thu Jun 20 19:02:19 2013 UTC,Great strike!  Not a half volley though...
HighlightGIFS,1go3xi,dumkopf604,1 point,Wed Jun 19 23:02:54 2013 UTC,I'm confused. Isn't hitting it after it takes a bounce a half-volley?
HighlightGIFS,1go3xi,Kahuna28,1 point,Thu Jun 20 09:07:56 2013 UTC,"My understanding of a half volley is hitting the ball after it's only bounced off of the ground once, no matter which direction the ball is travelling"
HighlightGIFS,1go3xi,thombsaway,1 point,Thu Jun 20 16:17:57 2013 UTC,"Pretty sure half volley is hitting it just after the ball hits the ground, so while the ball is still moving up. Like a drop kick.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_volley"
HighlightGIFS,1go3xi,thombsaway,1 point,Thu Jun 20 09:45:02 2013 UTC,There's different definitions of what a half volley is - your source is a tennis definition. Many people refer to a half volley as simply hitting the ball after one bounce.
HighlightGIFS,1go3xi,thombsaway,1 point,Thu Jun 20 19:08:42 2013 UTC,Could I have a link to that definition? I've only ever heard it used with respect to any sport to mean striking immediately after touching the ground.
HighlightGIFS,1go3xi,Comments_Sometimes,1 point,Thu Jun 20 21:55:08 2013 UTC,"There are many definitions, none of which are definitive for football. Read this article from the Guardian called 'What is a volley?'. It mentions your point too."

HighlightGIFS,1glofz,StannyNZ,8,Wed Jun 19 03:10:06 2013 UTC,"In Rugby Union, play doesn't stop when the ball carrier is grounded, they do have to release the ball though."

HighlightGIFS,1glofz,ShlawsonSays,4,Thu Jun 20 03:08:29 2013 UTC,Ah c'mon it's just hyperbole. Anyway I agree with you to an extent in that offloads like this are fairly common in top level rugby union and that this isn't hugely special but it's still a nice bit of skill.   Anyway it's tough to argue that an accurate backhanded pass thrown while the passer is getting tackled by 18 stone of muscle is the reason you don't like watching rugby union. I imagine that's more due to the current state of the scrum and the instances of full backs exchanging kicks for 5 mins that's doing that.
HighlightGIFS,1glofz,ShlawsonSays,2,Tue Jun 18 19:19:39 2013 UTC,"Fair enough, each to their own :)"
HighlightGIFS,1glofz,ducksa,1 point,Tue Jun 18 22:12:17 2013 UTC,I don't know about rugby as a spectator sport but there's nothing incredible about this.
HighlightGIFS,1giwhl,ail33,4,Mon Jun 17 16:53:10 2013 UTC,This was such a gorgeous goal. Pirlo the master
HighlightGIFS,1giwhl,vizzlebizzle,3,Mon Jun 17 18:38:43 2013 UTC,"From this angle it looks like the keeper has it, but at the last moment tucks his hand back and lets it by.  What I assume happened is he jumped too far and the ball goes behind his head."
HighlightGIFS,1giwhl,PishP0sh,2,Mon Jun 17 17:14:09 2013 UTC,"It looks like he jumped over the ball to me, like perhaps the ball was curved down as strong as it was left."
HighlightGIFS,1giwhl,dadrew1,3,Mon Jun 17 18:46:54 2013 UTC,"I can't even count the number of times I've watched this and at first I agreed with you (I thought the ball dipped down below him)....but after watching it more, it looks like the ball hits the top part of the back of the net...which makes me assume the keeper thinks it's going to hit the crossbar, but simply mis-judges it...  As my former assistant coach (and keeper coach) always said to the keepers, ""When in doubt....parlay it out"""
HighlightGIFS,1giwg0,ail33,3,Mon Jun 17 16:52:44 2013 UTC,"I do not like him as a person, but he is too good to hate as a player."

HighlightGIFS,1giwg0,vizzlebizzle,1 point,Mon Jun 17 18:47:10 2013 UTC,Am I right in thinking the frame rate is weird on this? Like too fast before he hits the ball then too slow after?

HighlightGIFS,1ggcas,kitspark,2,Mon Jun 17 07:14:48 2013 UTC,The 1st and 3rd base coaches wear them as well.
HighlightGIFS,1ggcas,x3knet,-6,Mon Jun 17 03:37:11 2013 UTC,"This is been explained before, but the reason players get hit in the head is because they follow through improperly, any pitcher who pitches the ball with correct form will never been any serious risk of getting hit in the head"
HighlightGIFS,1ggcas,jtmalone,8,Wed Jul 3 19:15:19 2013 UTC,"That's bullshit.  The pitcher is 60 feet from home plate. First/third base are 90 feet. Hard line drives are a hazard to both of those bases and they're 30 feet further away. A ball coming off the bat at 100 MPH (such as the one that hit Cobb) takes less than half a second to reach the pitcher mound. The pitcher has more to worry about beyond blocking a come-backer. Is the runner stealing? Can I make a defensive play? Getting your glove up in 500ms is hard enough on its own.   If you've never pitched and been hit you can't know what it's like. I got hit by a softball off an original Miken Freak several years ago. I had my glove at chest height after I pitched and I literally couldn't react in time to stop the ball from hitting me. Caught me square in the upper thigh and I consider that to be pretty damn lucky. The ball was probably coming at over around the speed mentioned above. You can block most shots up the middle, but when they really connect I don't see how you can possibly be expected to react in time always"

HighlightGIFS,1ggcas,stuffandotherstuff,7,Sun Jun 16 18:19:40 2013 UTC,If you're paying attention to the ball you shouldn't really be worried about this. If you can't dodge a foul ball just get your hand in front of it or take it in the back. The problem with pitchers is that they have almost no time to react.

HighlightGIFS,1gedxq,DJ_ChuckNorris,3,Sun Jun 16 17:37:45 2013 UTC,30 - 0. They are usually quite a bit better than that. It's well known that French rugby is either sublime or awful.
