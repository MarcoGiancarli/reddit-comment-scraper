mealtimevideos,3dnbq2,fathernicolow,4,Sat Jul 18 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"Smite looks pretty interesting. Gonna check it out. Thanks for the intro.   I'm torn on this ""debate"". I love games and I love sports, but I'm still not sold on the idea that ""eSports"" are ""Sports"". I also play chess and poker and I've never been crazy about the idea of them being called sports. And I realize the manual dexterity that goes into high level gaming, especially for MOBAs and RTSs, and I realize how much that youth and quickness plays a part in high level eSports. But I still don't quite see them as ""Sports"". That isn't in any way negative. In fact, I've had debates about if Bowling is even really a sport.   Ultimately, I think they're something different. They are games that require a high level of manual dexterity and speed to play well. But I think calling them ""eSports"" does a disservice to the uniqueness of the medium and I wish another name, besides ""games"", was popularized from the outset. I think the fact that it's being called eSports is half the problem in itself."

And he is a talented script copier. When he has his back to the audience you're focused on the card in his right hand slipping in and out of his vest, while in front you can see his left arm is working against his chest (copying the script) and then slides up a bit, putting it into his mouth to prep for the copy's appearance there later. It's some damned brilliant slight of hand and takes a lot of talent to do that, especially with both hands moving so finely and independently of each other.  Good stuff."

So imagine it from the perspective of being one of his friends?  He remembers them, includes them and basically is a provider for the people he cares about.   I saw him on the Norm MacDonald video podcast and he seems like a down to earth, genuine guy.

mealtimevideos,3d3vhj,amberwavesofglass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"stadium situation is the way it is because of democracy and capitalism... the huge swaths of people who don't care about local politics would go vote ONLY on this issue if a local politician allowed a team to move away, so politicians need to give lots of money to keep stadiums around, or they'd never get elected / re-elected.  pointing out that stadiums don't help the local economy and cost a lot of tax payer money can be funny, but it's not something that's going to change, nor should it.  It's one of the side effects of our democracy... You don't need a majority of humans to support something for it to be political capitol, you just need enough people to feel strongly enough about it in one direction while others are apathetic in the opposite direction.  People who don't think we should be spending a bundle on stadiums aren't going to show up in droves screaming about it."

There are plenty of forms of government, and they all have different pro's and cons, you can't take something like this out of context and just be like ""I don't think it's good."" you have to see this as an inevitable side effect of our chosen form of government, and weigh weather or not you think the whole govt is better or worse than some other achieveable form... i think the likelihood that we'll be changing any time soon is 0, and so i look at this and say ""yup, working as designed."""
