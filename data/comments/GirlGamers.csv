GirlGamers,3dz1n6,wootevi,10,Mon Jul 20 19:04:35 2015 UTC,Seeing all of them together just reinforces my initial impression that it's a really bad picture of Messi.
GirlGamers,3dz1n6,missinfidel,17,Mon Jul 20 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"This is gonna sound mean, but I've never seen a good picture of Messi. He just... sorta always looks like an action bird from a Nat Geo shoot."
GirlGamers,3dz1n6,Koopa_Troop,4,Mon Jul 20 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"I've noticed some people are photogenic in motion but not in still images. I think Messi generally looks pretty good during matches, but  somehow he looks off when perfectly still."

GirlGamers,3dz1n6,Lanthalona,28,Mon Jul 20 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"This is wonderful news!  I never was much of a football fan, but from what I've played of FIFA over at my friends' the game is genuinely fun even if you're not into the sport.  To see female football players FINALLY properly represented in the game (although, from what I've heard, not all of FIFA's features will be available for the women's teams) and on its regional covers is fantastic, to say the least.  Sadly, it seems that there won't be a woman on the European cover, which is by far the biggest market for FIFA. Nonetheless, this is a victory for women's sports!  Also, a friendly reminder: Don't read the Twitter comments"
GirlGamers,3dz1n6,Silaryia,5,Mon Jul 20 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"This is awesome! :D  I normally don't buy FIFA games but I think I'll pick up this one, since you and others have said its actually a really fun series."
GirlGamers,3dz1n6,Koopa_Troop,4,Mon Jul 20 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"I actually just got Fifa 15 for my iPad and it is surprisingly fun. I never thought I'd enjoy a sports game that didn't have Mario in the title, but I've spent the last week engrossed in it. I think I get more excited when I score in the game than when I watch actual games on TV, and that's saying something.   I really hope they make an app version of this one so I can build a Women's team and kick some ass."

GirlGamers,3dv8dn,lololololoololololol,4,Mon Jul 20 13:07:50 2015 UTC,"I wish there were more ""artsy"" Dragon Age wallpapers. The Flemeth one is nice but every other one I've ever seen is ugly. Especially those official DA:I ones.  Does anyone have any pretty Dragon Age wallpapers? :("
GirlGamers,3dv8dn,lololololoololololol,4,Mon Jul 20 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"I've found it very hard to find decent quality wallpapers unfortunately. By far the nicest one is the Flemeth one, although the last feast table also looks pretty good. Most of the images aren't anywhere near the full resolution they've been scaled up to (and I agree, the official backgrounds are probably the worst!).   I actually have quite a lot of dragon age images so I'll dump them into an album. Not many are good quality at all, but I'm such a DA fan I've been keeping them anyway in case something better doesn't crop up. Here is the album.   Note: Image number 16 is a spoiler for the final post credits scene so if you haven't finished the game skip that one.   edit: forgot to add the number, whoops!  Bioware needs to take a class in making desktop backgrounds from SuperGiant Games, that's for sure."
GirlGamers,3dv8dn,Quietkitsune,2,Mon Jul 20 16:59:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for linking the album. I found a few wallpapers I like! :D  Edit: I was looking for more DA wallpapers. I found this website. It's got a few I haven't seen before. Click on the Dragon Age categories.

I currently have 196 desktop wallpapers because I couldn't settle (although I am suspicious that my 'random' feature isn't actually random since it repeats many before I even get to see some of the others....)"
GirlGamers,3dv8dn,Daniellynet,2,Mon Jul 20 08:23:41 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is I need many more wallpapers, then I won't have to choose? I like this plan"

GirlGamers,3dqwoz,Lanthalona,3,Sat Jul 18 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Chun-Li player (albeit a really bad one), this was such a joy to finally get to watch. Street Fighter is always fun to watch, but it's oh so much better when someone's playing your main character and you know just how much skill it takes to pull off the things they're doing.  I only caught the very end of the match because I was watching the second Street Fighter live stream (capcomfighters) and tuned into the main stage a bit too late. The dude was so salty after he lost, it was brilliant.  The ""It's hard to concentrate when you're playing against a cute girl"" comment was a bit uncalled for, though. I mean, using this logic, imagine how difficult it would be for gay guys to play Street Fighter. These people are professionals and if they can't treat their opponent with the respect she deserves - the respect you should have to someone who is equally or more skilled than you - then they absolutely deserve to lose.  In addition to this, I've been really pleasantly surprised watching EVO this year and seeing how varied the Street Fighter player base is in terms of race. Tons of Asians, tons of black guys. Really cool to see.

GirlGamers,3dqwoz,Maskerad,5,Sun Jul 19 08:37:10 2015 UTC,"That was so insane. Still hilarious with the ""not trying to be sexist but [totally awful sexist statement]"" ^ EVO can be awful with that stuff."
GirlGamers,3dqwoz,Maskerad,2,Sat Jul 18 23:48:14 2015 UTC,Which is weird cause Spooky is pretty good about squashing that stuff on his streams.

GirlGamers,3dqwoz,jetanders,6,Sun Jul 19 08:30:25 2015 UTC,"I don't really follow fighting games at all, and only know that EVO is a big deal, so I would definitely appreciate anyone with an explanation of the context -- is this some kind of comedic thing, the commentary? Or is the situation so dire in the Street Fighter community that it actually warrants game-commentary getting put on hold for a speech about how the commentator totally understands how surprising and distracting it is to play against girls but you should treat everyone the same way? I was puzzled and without a frame of reference."
GirlGamers,3dqwoz,Lanthalona,6,Sat Jul 18 20:45:13 2015 UTC,Basically Spooky was being dumb and Mike Ross shut him down there aren't a ton of girls in the FGC but they are there and Mike was just telling Spooky to worry about how well they play and don't worry about who they are.
GirlGamers,3dqwoz,chainedwind,3,Sat Jul 18 21:35:07 2015 UTC,Yeah it wouldn't have been so bad if it were presented better and actually was brought up to shed light on an issue rather than give a excuse for why the guy came out losing.
GirlGamers,3dqwoz,jetanders,3,Sun Jul 19 05:03:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not too familiar with Street Fighter commentators, but Mike Ross was on point from what I've seen over the weekend.

GirlGamers,3dqwoz,jetanders,2,Sun Jul 19 19:57:00 2015 UTC,I mostly watch smash commentary but it seems in most fighting games play-by-play commentary is very uncommon so they use the time to talk about narratives or whatever else.  It's totally common for them to derive some narrative that depicts a fighter's internal monologue or the struggle they might be facing... it's just usually not so shallow or based in misogyny.
GirlGamers,3dqwoz,capslock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:02 2015 UTC,"I see. Thinking about it, the race-format commentary I've listened to is similar in that regard; I automatically evaluated this according to certain types of competitive FPS commentary instead, probably because of the fighting and the direct matching of player vs. player... but it would have made just as much sense to treat it like race-style commentary since it's 1v1!"

GirlGamers,3dqwoz,lloorren,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:18 2015 UTC,"To make sure I am communicating clearly: I don't mean race-format as in games about racing, but rather a competitive format in which players race against each other to finish the game (or some portion of the game, etc.) before the other player(s) can do so -- similar to speedrunning, but since you have competitors going in realtime, there's pressure to get it right in one go without running into any fail states.  Crypt of the Necrodancer races got me into watching that kind of format -- the community is pretty nice -- but apparently it is something that rogue(like)+s gravitate toward? That was my impression, anyway!"

GirlGamers,3diaaj,sodium18,125,Thu Jul 16 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"For clarification, ""Low status"" in the context of this study mean men who are performing poorly at video games.  From the abstract:   We show that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly. In contrast, lower-skilled players behaved submissively towards a male-voiced player in the identical scenario. This difference in gender-directed behaviour became more extreme with poorer focal-player performance. We suggest that low-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status as a consequence of hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena. Higher-skilled players, in contrast, were more positive towards a female relative to a male teammate. As higher-skilled players have less to fear from hierarchical reorganization, we argue that these males behave more positively in an attempt to support and garner a female player’s attention."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Koopa_Troop,61,Thu Jul 16 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"To me this translates to primal behaviour.  ""I'm feeling embarrassed in front of a potential mate, must bash chest harder to look tougher and make it seem that I am rejecting them, not that I am weak (aka, not the better candidate).""  Even though in gaming, we're not doing a mating dance, but it seems to be a reaction due to embarrassment. Acting like an ass because you aren't the one shining in the arena."

If that were the case, male-on-male trashtalk would increase.  Instead, it's a hierarchy of high skilled male -> low skilled male -> women (in the eyes of ""low skilled male"") and it's his nonsexual social status that's in danger."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,ZapActions-dower,67,Thu Jul 16 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's about their masculinity being threatened because they're being beaten by a girl (because masculine socialization teaches boys that femininity is inferior and inferiority is feminine).  While I appreciate that you think it's about female attention, you're assuming a lot about male sexuality: (a) that these men are overwhelmingly heterosexual, and (b) that our primary behavioral motivator is female sexual attention. (a) is not likely and (b) is demonstrably untrue; the apparent obsession with female sexual attention among dudes is 99% actually a masculine power play (the message is not ""I am successful at mating!"" but ""look how much power I can exert over women! I am a powerful person and you should follow me and give me things!""; humans don't breed often enough to have attraction be the primary motivator behind behavior.)"
GirlGamers,3diaaj,utopianfiat,10,Thu Jul 16 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"(a) that these men are overwhelmingly heterosexual  (a) is not likely   how do you figure this?  it isn't an absurd assumption; the sample size of the study was:   A total of 189 players spoke in these 102 games; all of them were male   from here it says that for Australia for example:   Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population   which means on average they had 3-4 gay people.  3 or 4 out of 189 people i think is 'overwhelmingly heterosexual', don't you?"
GirlGamers,3diaaj,doesntrepickmeepo,10,Thu Jul 16 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"Australia's numbers are way under the US's, but even then, ""heterosexual"" and ""homosexual"" are not binary. The men would have to be exclusively heterosexual to the point where male affection was worthless in order for sex to be the primary motivator. In a sample of 189 players, the chance that men who are more motivated by male sexual attention is too significant."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,utopianfiat,4,Thu Jul 16 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"Australia's numbers are way under the US's   you're wrong.  are you intentionally lying or just misinformed?   In the first large-scale government survey measuring Americans’ sexual orientation, the NHIS reported in July 2014 that 1.6 percent of Americans identify as gay or lesbian   that is lower than Australia.   (a) that these men are overwhelmingly heterosexual  (a) is not likely   you're factually wrong, males in society identify overwhelmingly as heterosexual (?98%),   hence your statement that:   In a sample of 189 players, the chance that men who are more motivated by male sexual attention is too significant.   is also wrong, assuming you mean 'significant' in the statistical sense, and assuming the orientation of this sample reflects the national average.  if you don't mean 'significant' in the statistical sense, your assertions about the study are baseless, and consequently worthless to the discussion.    especially when you wrote:   humans don't breed often enough to have attraction be the primary motivator behind behavior.   stop presenting your own opinion as fact.  actual frequency of breeding in today's society is unrelated to our biological desired frequency, why do you think people have sex all the time.  American psychologist Abraham Maslow disagrees with you, asserting that:   3) belongingness and love (participating in affectionate sexual and non-sexual relationships, belonging to social groups)   is a higher priority on the heirarchy than:   4) esteem (being respected as an individual)   whereas you said the opposite:    the message is not ""I am successful at mating!"" but ""look how much power I can exert over women! I am a powerful person and you should follow me and give me things!   furthermore, it is not about ""I am successful at mating!"", but ""I am a worthwhile candidate for mating!"", which is the whole point of vying for female attention you dingus."

If it's the latter then it could be:  - I feel that I'm the lowest/loser and I think the woman should be lower regardless of what her skill is [ie I want to look good in the eyes of the males who are better than me]   My lizard brain tells me that if she was looking for a mate he would choose any of the guys who have better match making, so I'm so low in the dating totem pool I have no reason to be nice to her/I'm venting off the fact that I'm so low by being mean in a sour grapes kind of way.

Doesn't even have to be strangers online, it can be your own gamer friends.   I have this ""friendly"" pact (we made this like 4 years ago) with my friend online that we will get married by 30 if we're both single at the time. It's a joke and he knows it. But if I make friends with other guys he HAS to bring that up, esp if the other guy surpasses him in gaming-skills regarding the game we are playing at the time (LoL mostly so hes gold and the other guy is like diamond). Then he'll order me around, demanding we do something instead of asking, to show dominance I guess. I of course ignore him. Fuck that. But I had to apologize profusely once because my friend was so fucking rude and arrogant. I was embarrassed and ashamed. I'll never understand the desire for men to compete against each other for shit like this. (I watch enough animes and Kdramas to get my love triangle-fill LOL)   Shit doesn't happen anymore (with my friend anyway), partly because I dont mention if I have new guy friends or anything, but if it does, I won't be so nice.

GirlGamers,3diaaj,maleia,59,Fri Jul 17 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"I like this comment from /r/science    You can also see similar tendencies among low-income Americans who can be hostile to other low-status groups like immigrants or minorities.   In context of the discussion: lower-performing (status) men target women because they (women) are expected to be lower-performing (status) by default (sexism). When they don't meet that expectation (i.e. When the women are doing better than the men) the men target women with hostility. This doesn't account for high-performing (status) men targeting women positively, while remaining neutral toward other men, though."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,saracuda,23,Thu Jul 16 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"This doesn't account for high-performing (status) men targeting women positively, while remaining neutral toward other men, though.   The difference is probably that Xenophobia is very ""Us vs. Them"" whereas sexism is more often based on ""you shouldn't be here"" but more ""I get to define your role here"". So while high-income/high-status groups won't tend to support low-status/low-income groups, because masculine status defines itself in relation to control/protection of ""femininity"", high-status dudes are gonna be more likely to try to cash in on their status in a way that makes them look more masculine."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,utopianfiat,12,Thu Jul 16 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"It's still ""Us vs. Them"" (or else the rampant fear and hatred of feminists wouldn't exist) but high-status males don't (normally) feel threatened by women.  In the game situation, even if a woman is beating them, they're still in the top three on their team.  They still have power and respect.  It's the ones that don't have anything that fear losing what little they have left."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,ZapActions-dower,17,Thu Jul 16 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"If the women are better than them, they they're the worst, and that's unacceptable.  It's the same explanation as to why there's such racial animosity from low social status whites to blacks.  If blacks are still below them, then they're not the lowest rung, so they work hard to beat them into that role.  It's this tendency that was the basis of Nixon and Goldwater's ""Southern Strategy:""  They sacrificed the black vote they formerly had for the much larger poor white vote (as whites outnumber blacks by quite a bit nationwide) on a platform of very thinly veiled racism.  This isn't even a conspiracy theory, it has been admitted to and apologized for by the RNC chairman Ken Mehlman."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,ZapActions-dower,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:00 2015 UTC,In my experience most men don't view women as legitimate competition no matter how skilled they are. So I could easily see a skilled male player enjoying seeing who he (consciously or subconsciously) views as his actual competition being challenged or beaten by a female player who he personally doesn't feel threatened by. In that case he probably wouldn't have much reason go target the female player since he's benefiting from having her around.

GirlGamers,3diaaj,jaodoriko,51,Thu Jul 16 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"I don't really think this article is accurately portraying the study. The very beginning seems to claim that ""it's not a bunch of misogynists! It's just the people who suck at video games bullying other people!"" They try to water down legitimate misogyny to a case of hierarchical status and ""really just a form of bullying"".  It also still talks about gaming spaces as if they belong to men and that positions of power or skill in gaming are a man's entitled role: ""the men most likely to have their position in a hierarchy usurped by a woman turned out to be meaner.""  It also tries to give a bland biologically reductive explanation that almost seems to offer allowance for men who get angry when a woman is better than them at something they enjoy: ""Since a man’s mating chances are better determined by his status than his looks, if a woman is usurping a man’s status by outperforming him, it means that he is less likely to be attractive to a potential mate, especially one that is higher than him in the hierarchy."" Claiming that it's just ""nature running its course"" and acting like men are no better than horny, aggressive apes trying to mate is ridiculous. Men have culpability for their actions regardless of how much or little they're willing to attribute it to hormones or social order.  Misogyny can't be boiled down to a simple case of ""sore losers"". The article neglects to focus on real reasons why aggression and bullying towards women are permitted and normalized in these spaces in the first place."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Soycrates,23,Thu Jul 16 18:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think you've hit the nail on the head. It was weird how the article would note that gaming hierarchies are purely skill-based, yet neglect to explore why low-skill male gamers would perceive women as naturally falling beneath them in that pecking order. Yes, it may be true that low-skill male gamers are lashing out more at women as a form of hierarchical bullying, but the system of social status that they're trying to maintain is still informed by sexism and misogyny."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,pyrrhy,12,Thu Jul 16 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"""Since a man’s mating chances are better determined by his status than his looks, if a woman is usurping a man’s status by outperforming him, it means that he is less likely to be attractive to a potential mate, especially one that is higher than him in the hierarchy.""   To add to your point, this quote completely bypasses the fact that this same hostility doesn't seem to be directed at the other men also surpassing them. He's less likely to attract a potential mate anyway since the competition is better, but it's the fact that suddenly it's a woman that sets off the hostility."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Koopa_Troop,9,Thu Jul 16 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly - if this were really about ""a man's mating chances"" we should see him enact more hostile behaviour towards other men when women are around. Because it's those men who are doing better than he is that ""threaten"" his mating chances. A woman being better than you is only a threat to your male mating chances if everyone suddenly became a lesbian.  Additionally if we just dress down the statement they made trying to seem overly clinical and biological about this, what they're saying is that men have an almost innate tendency to demean women that are better than them solely for the sake of mating with them. That sounds about right, but this isn't some biological trait or serious anthropological find - it's called negging, and plenty of douchebags do it."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Soycrates,0,Thu Jul 16 20:04:50 2015 UTC,I think its possible that by showing aggression towards a woman is a way to devalue her to other men who may be more successful 'mates' so it would make sense that in a 'mating' scenario for a lower status man to be agressive towards a woman than I higher status man.
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Lambister,4,Thu Jul 16 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"Understandably gossip may devalue a woman in the eyes of other men (like passing around stories about them behind their backs, calling them ""crazy"" or ""slut"") but I find a lot of guys say that they want to protect women from other men. By attacking a woman you're not really showing that she isn't valuable, you're showing that she's vulnerable. I feel like that would really backfire if you're trying to make her look undesirable in the eyes of the average male.  This is especially why men in real life tend to only approach women, positively or negatively, on the street if they are alone as opposed to when they are with other men."

Racism among lower social classes, or even classism displayed by the middle/lower classes (hello, middle america), can be intense and has nothing to do with attracting a mate.  It's the same principle, people are nasty to those who they perceive as being worse off than them because they need to feel like they're better than SOMEBODY at least."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Drakkanrider,2,Fri Jul 17 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"A study with monkeys was done about hierarchy and bullying.   It's common for a higher up monkey to attack a lower one who will then in turn bully a monkey underneath their low status.   It just happens that in our society women are still seen as 'second' class citizens in some ways.   This is saying the same thing the monkey experiment showed. Highest-ranking man makes the lower one feel inadequate so the lower one looks for who is lower than them on the list to make feel more inadequate than they originally felt. For a lot of men, it's women.  Or at least how I saw it."

GirlGamers,3diaaj,Drakkanrider,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see their ""bland biologically reductive explanation"" and I don't see it as a justification for the hostile behaviors. They didn't do the naturalistic fallacy; they didn't say what is ought to be.   One must understand the reasons for their emotions and impulses if one wishes to change them. Its like how I have a taste for sugar even though I rationally know I shouldn't eat tons of the readily available sugar. The impulse, to eat tons of sugar, was useful in a world where sugar and food was a very scarce resource but we don't live in that world anymore. This creates evolutionary mismatch.   I don't think anyone would argue you should eat sugar because you have the impulse to, just as the article doesn't say one should be hostile towards women because one has the impulse to.  Also it is disingenuous to say their reasons are not ""real"" With any complex topic, there will be multiple factors. Biology is a very valid factor. It could be said you're trying to boil down a complex topic to a simpler case."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,shadowwada,11,Fri Jul 17 02:18:03 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, higher-skilled men were more positive towards women, but not men.   That point right there fascinates me more than the entire article. In my personal experience, I haven't found anything that goes against that. If we're looking at this from the study's primal perspective, perhaps higher status males are more confident they can fluff their feathers and attract the females so they are more positive to females. In my opinion though more intelligent, better skilled men tend to just be more mature and respectful of people in general.   So this really all boils down to being: People who are insecure and unhappy in their lives tend to bully others. Bullies pick on the seemingly weak, to separate them from the herd as an easy target. In video games, women are less common and therefore the simplest targets for bullies."" I think that's all that's really going on here."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Cronoan,9,Thu Jul 16 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"Bullies pick on the seemingly weak, to separate them from the herd draw attention away from themselves as an easy a potential target.   Someone who views themselves as failing is going to seek to get out of that spotlight, and it's far easier to shift the center of attention to someone perceived as weaker than to improve...and when we get to brass tacks, 'failing' and 'weaker' are relative.  That's not unique to men, or gamers, or low status...that's human nature.  The #9 in the world could still be a raging asshole not because they see themselves as #9 out of 2,000,000...but because they see themselves as #9 out of 10."

GirlGamers,3diaaj,foxden_racing,4,Fri Jul 17 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. It's more likely that the low-skill men were angry at women and not men because they saw women as lesser than themselves, and they were angry to be beaten by a girl, than some primal thing, or a matter of maturity.   Trying to justify it as some primal thing takes away the element of choice, and the decision to be an asshole is no longer the bully's."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,dragonzflyte,3,Thu Jul 16 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think it's something to do with the low-skilled men being able to idolize and admire the higher skilled men, but a total failure to imagine that a woman's skill could be something they could admire--> sexism (the conscious or unconscious belief that, by nature, men must be superior to women)."

How does ""men bullying women online"" equate to misogyny? From my experience playing games online, men bully women because they want to genuinely have sex with them and must stand out among the other men to garner their attention. Getting someone's attention doesn't always have to be a positive experience. Some women enjoy being berated because they are smart enough to not take it seriously, especially IN A VIDEO GAME.   Specifically alarming was   men bully women because they want to genuinely have sex with them and must stand out among the other men to garner their attention.....................  ...........Some women enjoy being berated   So this is where a culture of telling kids that that boy punched them because he likes them has gotten us."

Also, as noted with the, ""inflammatory subject,"" the amount of emotional investment affects it, too.  I've also read that intelligence can actually increase this sort of behavior because intelligent persons can better defend their positions and rationalize it to themselves."

GirlGamers,3diaaj,Nerobus,10,Thu Jul 16 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see that a lot when this topic comes up. The most popular argument I've seen is ""everyone gets harassed/abused!"" even when you show evidence to show women get far more (even from their own teammates, which isn't something men typically have to deal with). Second only to ""people attack anyone who is different - women get it because they're a minority in games"" ... like, as though that's supposed to make it ok? Or not a big deal?   BTW, thank you for what you do. I imagine moderating that sub would be a pain in the ass - not only is it huge, but without careful monitoring it would turn into a huge agenda-pushing shitshow."
GirlGamers,3diaaj,Leagle_Egal,3,Thu Jul 16 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"I had a really hard time convincing my boyfriend that I (and other women) get harassed ALL THE TIME in games. He said he hardly ever sees women being harassed, and when he does, most of the other players call the guy out. I had to explain to him that most of them don't do it in public chat in front of the entire group. When he asked for examples, I started telling him about some of the things that have been said to me (almost all of which were whispers/PMs), and he said ""no, tell me something that happened to you, not just a bunch of stories you saw on Reddit.""  People just don't believe it happens that much. Which really, is a credit to them because it means that they're decent enough people that they have a hard time believing others would act that way. But there's still a huge problem with guys doubting women when they share their experiences, and I think sometimes that can be just as bad, or in some cases even worse than actually being harassed. I mean, I'm used to dealing with basic harassment at this point. They're really not as creative as they think they are. It's just the same 10 lines over and over again.   But I don't think I'll ever get over that feeling of having to fight to prove that this very common, very shitty thing is happening to me before people will even do something as simple as just acknowledging that it happens."

Two players responded with more than 20 negative to the female voice player that the researchers had to exclude them from the analysis because they're so far off the average which could skew the results.

GirlGamers,3diomd,meatwhisper,7,Thu Jul 16 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, so Splatoon is obviously a bit of a non-interactive space thanks to the lack of voice chat or player comms of any kind... but I love the playerbase anyway, if only for the enthusiasm that has spilled onto social networks and Nintendo's own Miiverse (which has a simple black and white illustration posting option that puts graffiti around the hub world and in actual match maps). Sure, there's been a lot of bad punning and cartoon sea-life illustrations, but... ah  come on, stop taking it so seriously :P"
GirlGamers,3diomd,kupocake,4,Fri Jul 17 23:24:28 2015 UTC,Came here to say Splatoon too.  I actually really like the subreddit as well and don't think I've seen any insane stuff like a lot of the other gaming subreddits.  Really sad I have to be in a wedding today instead of playing Splatfest ;-;

It's mostly dudes, but I think their games tend to hit an older age group and everyone I've talked to about it has been pretty chill and welcoming  bioware fans apparently have a reputation online (I'm not a big fandom-type person so this is hearsay) but almost every bioware fan I've met in person has been wonderful  I don't play a lot of multiplayer so I'm not sure how helpful this is, but there you go"

It's really only happened once, and I'm a day 1 (Sept. 2015) player.   I'm fairly active in the /r/destinythegame community, which is likewise pretty great. You get people grumbling about weapon nerfs and whatnot, but nothing like putting down female gamers, or gay/trans players, or players of other races. Hell, you constantly see posts about players helping the community out by sherpa-ing raids and other events, and playing with those at a disadvantage (like deaf players), because other groups will just drop them.   Over all, the community feels incredibly friendly :) It helps that the game itself treats it's female characters very well."

Then once you get in game combine 12 year olds who want to fuck your mother with being able to physically restrain your character and its all downhill from there. I have had a lot of good experiences with people and I have a great group I play with regularly who do not put up with that shit directed to anyone, but overall the community is one I try to avoid."

And the character designs are not bad either. I wonder what ""shooter MOBA"" even means, though -- just that you have to aim?   edit: One of the trailer videos included some gameplay footage -- apparently it's actually first person. Huh.   and edit: Not that I'm likely to be able to run it either way, but I dearly hope they keep the 2D special effects in the final game. They're so stylish."

GirlGamers,3df6z4,chainedwind,3,Thu Jul 16 09:13:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't just mean fantastical vs. realistic themes and colors, I mean the actual style of the art or animation. Looking at these Googled screenshots, Diablo 3's style in that sense just looks the same as WoW or GW2 or any of a large number of big fantasy-themed games out there. There may be differences, certainly, but not to the point demonstrated by Gigantic with its 2D effects, matte shading, simplification of detail, extreme exaggeration of the shapes of human(oid) characters, etc."

GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Elaine_Benes_,72,Wed Jul 15 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"Our game is about story, not characters   Diversity aside, that's a huge red flag that the game in question will have an atrocious story.  Stories are about characters. If a game is ""about story"", then it is about characters - or it's a poor story. There are few (if any) absolutes when it comes to storytelling, but ""stories are about characters"" is as close to an absolute as you can get.  If someone had examples of when this phrase had been used, I'm sure the resulting games were either not very good (in terms of story) or indeed about characters despite the developer's protestation."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Tonkarz,39,Wed Jul 15 09:38:36 2015 UTC,"The instant example of this in my mind would be Game of Thrones.  If you take a few steps back, you could argue it's about the story of Westeros and the east and just the world in general; as it follows world events as the main story arc.  BUT IT IS ALL TOLD THROUGH PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES OF CHARACTERS."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Tsumei,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:00:41 2015 UTC,"It's more significant than that.  Plot is not story, which I want to say because it's often used synonymously. Plot is nothing more than a sequence of events, and in a good story, what those events are and how they're conducted will be determined by what the characters do. As if they're living beings that write themselves. Without good characters, the scenery essentially falls down even on the most spectacularly dazzling epic, because I cannot relate to or empathize with a sequence of events. I can, and do, do that with good characters. It's why I can't care about the Witcher games despite its well-crafted world: their main character is a boring, conflict-less Marty Stu. Conversely, it's why I can enjoy The Last of Us despite it having an unoriginal and somewhat predictable plot: because the characters are engaging and relatable enough to keep me invested.  Removing good character from your story means cutting out its heart. The number of exceptions to that rule can be counted on one hand, and the writers in question would make every video game story look like copies of The Gruffalo written in crayon."

GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Tsumei,11,Sun Jul 19 09:42:15 2015 UTC,"A fun little example of this is Portal 2.  The puzzles were really fun, but there was actually a decent story.  You know what made that story decent?  All seven characters that appeared in the game.  One of whom was mute, three of whom only showed up at the very end, and one who was technically a series of pre-recorded messages considering he'd been dead for years.  But they were all still engaging, and added to this strange little world."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Zammin,15,Thu Jul 16 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"Which is why I never really loved Chrono Cross. The characters were just cardboard cutouts to advance the convoluted plot about the world. They had personalities before they joined you, but once they did they parrot the same lines no matter who you choose to take with you (many even losing their accents)  By comparison Chrono Trigger was 100% about the characters and their personalities, with different responses depending on who you take with you at times."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,paul_33,5,Wed Jul 15 12:36:04 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same problem.   There were far too many characters in Chrono Cross. The most compelling part of Chrono Trigger was its characters and their characterization.   But Chrono Cross cut that out in favor of nothing. The game gained nothing from having so many npc walk-on party members and lost a great deal.   One thing I missed in particular were the unique techs, dual techs and triple techs from the first game. They added character to the characters in a compelling and unusual way, but were also an interesting game mechanic.   The element grid from CC was generic and permanently made me prejudiced against highly original and experimental JRPG game mechanics."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Tonkarz,7,Wed Jul 15 12:47:46 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting contrast with Suikoden, which has famously 108 characters, plus villains, yet they each get a smidge of color of their own."

Oh, so your game is not incidentally a perfect example of the industry's problem with diversity, but a deliberate one? Cool.

GirlGamers,3dd0dc,-Sai-,3,Wed Jul 15 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"Game with the best future story?  Assassins Creed 3.  Those segments were also, not coincidentally, the best part of the game.  So Assassins Creed 3 could've done a few things: they could've had Desmond survive and the next game focus solely on him and the future without a jump to the past at all, they could've had a completely new protagonist that wasn't just another white-ish guy (technically Altair was Syrian and Connor was half Native American, but only Connor actually looked as though he might not be completely white), or they could have actually ended the series on that note.  But nope.  Horrifically bland future storyline that seems less like they're ""building up future events"" and more like they're stalling for time while they try to figure out something even halfway interesting there, a bunch of random white dude protagonists with British accents that nobody actually wanted to see, and the only slight concession towards actually having a non-Western character was AC Chronicles: China.  Which isn't even a proper AC game, but a side-scrolling platformer.  It's just sad."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Zammin,6,Thu Jul 16 00:12:40 2015 UTC,"AC3 had a number of problems story-wise, though the most glaring to me was I was fully expecting Connor's Assassinness to come from his Native side. I mean, it seemed to heavily imply that Native Americans were another strain of hybrids of humans and Those Who Came Before.   But nope! His Assassin line was of course paternal and from his white side. That... hah, well, Unfortunate Implications.  And if the Natives, or at least Connor's tribe, weren't naturally Assassin-predisposed then were we just doing a noble savage Natives-are-just-mystical type thing? Hooboy."

From left to right top to bottom   Diversity in stories makes a much richer story by possibilities. ONLY if you choose to have wild variation in races like say Charr and Norn, and Asura in GW2, but they figured it out just fine. Sidekicks aren't the main focus, so that's kinda a poor arguement. As the market grows people are heralding diversity as a reason to play a game. Look at Mirror's Edge for example. A game would be a much easier sell if it appealed to MORE people. Yeah more relatable characters, to whom? There's more than just white guys playing games now. We want fans to relate to the game? Diversity is a pretty damn good idea. Plan from the start, PROBLEM SOLVED. No diversity is a trend, Insert foot into mouth.  Refer to 1, Diversity makes better stories. Too lazy to pick up a book? Or read something related to said group? Oh maybe ask said group? Debatable, but again plan from the start, and this doesn't become a huge expense. Oh just one person? Are they paying all the money need to staff the dev team? Probably had nothing to do with the chosen character and everything to do with crapass design. Refer back to stories comment. Lore=Stories! Hurray! Yeah Heroes are more than just one kinda person. Leave the choices generics don't make them only pertain-able to one specific attribute. Oh based on what now? Strong characters exist in good stories, and good stories are amoung all peoples and nations. NPCs=/=player experience. That's a problem from the start then wasn't it? Empty promises a good game does not make. Erm what? Probably should have been  YEah you realize that Diversity probably would give players the higher possibility of having the best possible experince, it appeals to more people, just saying. The natural order of things is Diversity.  Maybe, maybe not. But defining your goals from the start to be inclusive would have made the work load a lot more fluid and less impactful."

GirlGamers,3dd0dc,yuudachi,2,Fri Jul 17 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"Train of thought rant:  I never really got the quips people made againt The Witcher for not having any racialised characters. The way I see it that was alle the first two games were about. Sure, there weren't any actual pocs in the games, but it's kinda like saying that Narnia isn't Christian propaganda because it's not literally God, but a Lion named Aslan, or that the muggle themes in Harry Potter isn't a way of describing racism.  It seems to me that The Witcher is very much dealing with racial issues, much, much more than any other large games in recent memory.  Edit: I know it's not perfect. White people get to identify with the humans and elves and dwarves (if they choose to do so). Poc is supposed to identify with elves and dwarves and be happy about it. It's not ideal."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,aaktor,8,Wed Jul 15 17:03:46 2015 UTC,i can understand how it can be frustrating though when so many games (or fantasy series in general) that deal with racial issues do so through a lens that doesn't involve any actual poc  personally i'm holding out hope for some zerrikania dlc (or an appearance in future(?) games) - i think it would fit with the new open-world feel of the third game
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,ebeth,0,Wed Jul 15 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand that too, but there are so many other games that doesn't do half of what the Witcher does with racial issues."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,aaktor,3,Wed Jul 15 18:45:11 2015 UTC,"My own thought on this (as someone who's dabbled in Witcher 2 but never really got into the series) is that it's not surprising the first games are very white, made by Polish developers in a mostly white country. But I think that after they got such a global response and Witcher 3 was so anticipated by people in the U.S. and elsewhere, it would have made sense to reassess and think about ways to make the world appealing to a wider audience. But they didn't, and here we are. I just started DAI the other day though and it's a totally different feel to playing Witcher 2. You really notice the lack of diversity when you get put into games that do it better."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,Elaine_Benes_,-2,Wed Jul 15 21:22:31 2015 UTC,"But then again The Witcher games are based on books (yes I know that fits the bingo of this post), and on Polish/northern folklore. Again this is speaking from a priviliged position, but if I played a viking RPG set in a world based on Scandinavia poc wouldn't make sense (perhaps like one middle eastern person), and would break the illusion - at least for people interested in that setting.  DA-games are different because they're set in a more generic fantasy world (like Pillars of Eternity, Baldur's Gate or something), but The Witcher is very localized to Poland, and is trying to stay true to the books."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,aaktor,2,Wed Jul 15 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"not sure why these are being downvoted but as someone who is a huge fan of the series (played the hell out of the first two games, currently on the 3rd and read most of the books) I get the polish defense. I really do. It's very heavily steeped in polish folklore. The problem is the witcher has become a big, front-and-center AAA game and when you look at their cultural focus within the broader scope of the videogame scene, it's not doing much of anything to alter the ubiquity of the white male protagonist. With great power (/success) comes great responsibility, and I think they are going to have to think about these issues in a way they could afford not to before  CDPR has a decent track record at taking criticism into account (anyone remember the sex cards?) and I'm hoping they address this, either with dlc or in future games. They have poc built into the lore, so it's really not a huge stretch"

As in like 1/1000 tops (I'm pulling this number out of my ass), so yes it would make sense, but if it had to be historically accurate that person would gather A LOT of attention as well, which could just turn into othering, because this person would be highlighted as something different."
GirlGamers,3dd0dc,aaktor,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"In the context of the Witcher, as often as Zerrikanian ale is found, you'd expect to have seen at least one Zerrikanian in Novigrad or Vizima. They're not the metropolises of the south, but still--they're large cities that see a lot of trade--particularly seagoing in the case of Novigrad.

GirlGamers,3dd0dc,aaktor,0,Fri Jul 17 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe? The geography makes it so that south of Poland and Scandinavia you have the Holy Roman Empire, and Zerrikania is somewhere east of that, though fairly far south, I think.

Most people who play AAA games are men, so they do sell to men. Lower budget games though, you definitively see more that cater towards women, as though the marketplace is smaller, you aren't putting as much money into it and get a sizable chunk of women (and men) who would play it.  Edit: Sometimes it's just bullshit in AAA games that they didn't add in something though. Why can't you play Assassin's Creed, for example, as a woman? I'm not saying this ""legitimizes"" all games that have issues representing women in the slightest.  Edit: And at the same time, we have games like Tomb Raider. Who knows."

I'd be happy to join your tournament (or just play the game by myself), but the game's 20 euro pricepoint is, sadly, a bit steep for me at the moment (and I'm not saying this just so that someone would take pity on me and buy me the game).

It helped me to look at it from a different perspective... Video games are re-playable. The first playthrough is the tutorial, i.e. I would allow myself to experience the first playthrough as a complete noob. Make whatever choices I wanted and literally, just play, learn the game.  Then if I wanted to go back and perfect (or platinum or whatever), I could go back. :) Most of the time I just ended up moving on to the next thing."

I also try to focus on the story, characters, roleplaying when applicable and gag that voice in my head telling me, ""think about all of the unique loot and secrets you might be missing. You must make your characters as strong as possible and complete ALL THE THINGS!"" For RPGs, I found it's more fun to play like this, so I discover new things when I replay.  But, I suck at combat and have little patience, so if I'm struggling a lot, then I look up builds and pick one to follow. Most recently for Pillars of Eternity, I did this for my character and the wizard in my party because they kept dying.  I'm tempted to do this for Apotheon right now, because I'm in Hades and I'm so scared that I just run away from everything."

For me a huge part of those games is doing research on strategies, tactics and player builds. In an RPG, I like to pre-plan the majority of my character progression before going into the game and I want to make sure it is at least feasible before I get halfway into the game and end up being stuck because I'm way too speak in some aspect. In strategy games, I like to look up general knowledge stuff within that particular game so I know how the game plays and maybe even look up some specific strategies and then adapt them to my own play style."

I personally like doing a ""quality build"" (points in strength as well as dex) since I like swordfighting (not with greatswords I mean). You really don't need a shitton of points in strength unless you're doing a strength build, where you basically dump as much of your points there as you can and rely on making powerful single blows with those giant weapons. (In my opinion, a pretty boring way to play.) What I usually do is set my dex and strength at the minimum to use the weapons whose movesets I like, then add from there. 40 points in one trait is the point where you start to get diminishing returns.  Even without a wide-ranging weapon in the fog, you can just run up to where you think the ghosts are and start bashing them until their health bar appears. Your goal is to get out of that area, so just run around looking for exits and then come back to explore more maybe?"

But this looks an awful lot like a zentai you can buy from (ok, under NO circumstances should you follow this link at work, NSFW) zentai zentai or a similar site.    Zentai zentai sells a lot of full body skin tight super hero costumes (including spider Gwen) for pretty cheap.  What they make their money on are the accessories.  Those accessories are the not safe for work part (they are sex toys).  So the suits themselves sans accessories are safe for work, the main site not so much, so check out the site when you get home.  I found out about the site when last con I went to I ran into a great spider Gwen and asked where she got her costume.  She apparently didn't know what kind of site it was until checking out when it tried to sell her on some particular accessories.  So I thought I'd warn you all first.

GirlGamers,3d32nn,msmartin2014,7,Mon Jul 13 03:19:23 2015 UTC,"Some tips I would give would be the following:   There are two types of twitch streamers, the pro-players and the entertainers. They cater to different audiences. You don't have to be good at the game BUT you have to be entertaining to watch. The question anyone should ask is ""Why should I watch you over someone else streaming the same game?""  As far as MMOs or grinding games in particular... most streamers either grind during their offline time or offer other forms of entertainment / commentary value during the grind. Something to keep in mind because grinding can be pretty boring to watch. Schedule your stream to something as close to consistent as possible. Everyday at so-and-so time for 2 hours a night, or every other day for 5 hours a night, or any other combination there. How often you should be on should be as often as you are able to with the energy required for it.  Most streamers, unless they have a studio set-up use the Logitech c920. As far as whether you should have a camera or not, that is sorely up to you. Most viewers nowadays will prefer a cam than without. Yes, there are certain streamers that stream without cam but carry the entertainment value hard. Lirik is the go-to example but isn't the best example because he also started streaming in JTV days.   One thing to keep in mind, is to have thick skin. You will always get trolls. Comments about your gameplay, voice, appearance, no-cam/cam-whore, no-boobs/boob-stream, etc. There is no pleasing everybody. The bottom-line is YOU need to figure out from the get-go how you want your streaming experience and your viewer-base. Some streams never/rarely ban, while others keep a tighter control of their chat. Learn which one you want your stream to be in and go from there.   Also, something that others tend to forget, streaming is about entertainment value to yourself and the viewers first -- shockingly enough, gameplay is second. Why is that? If you create an audience who only watch you for the video-game you play, the day you decide to switch it up and play another game, some of those viewers won't follow. You know things are great when you start to build a viewership based on yourself versus the game you play because that is the audience that will follow you no matter what game you're playing. Just keep  that in mind when you stream.   Hope this wall of text is helpful."
GirlGamers,3d32nn,sajedene,2,Mon Jul 13 05:21:38 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind, is to have thick skin.    ^ This. Absolutely."
GirlGamers,3d32nn,DeyCallMeTater,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:38:54 2015 UTC,Very helpful! Thanks so much.   I have the tough skin factor pretty much down. Lol. I did plays in hs and now am in some of a friends short films.   I just plan on being me and start my followers out slow. I don't want to be famous or get donations or be on t-shirts. Just looking to have fun!
GirlGamers,3d32nn,StrykerNoStriking,6,Mon Jul 13 13:17:05 2015 UTC,"tough skin factor pretty much down   Just a note: I think it's different with the anonymity factor and the written vs impulsive shout medium. I thought I had a tough skin, too--my day job's in writing, so I'm used to my stuff getting torn to shreds--and some of my first casual trolls hit me really damn hard. (There was also a misunderstanding of my friend group about what sort of channel my channel was like, which led to some weird-ass catfishing by them and some other stuff.)  Point is, trolling when you're live streaming feels really different than ""official"" critiques or other art forms which require acquiring that ""tough skin."" (Not to say that you don't have one, but... yeah. Get a modbot as soon as you go live--they help a lot.)   I just plan on being me and start my followers out slow. I don't want to be famous or get donations or be on t-shirts. Just looking to have fun!   That's why I'm doing it, and I'm still having fun, warts and all!"
GirlGamers,3d32nn,sajedene,2,Mon Jul 13 19:04:22 2015 UTC,"Doing it for fun is great. A lot of people who come in thinking that they can make a career out of this are shocked at how hard it can be. I'm pretty happy I make some money off of twitch but it's a lot of time and energy invested.  As another user mentioned, live trolling is a whole other beast than just critiques or negative comments. The trolls will stop at nothing to tear you apart. 4Chan raids can get you literally hundreds of trolls at once calling you names. They can dig up your personal contact info and spam it in chat. I recommend you looking up some YouTube clips on it to get an idea.  Another thing I recommend for anyone who streams is to put any personal info they don't want outed (last names, addresses, phone numbers) in the banned word section. If you can afford to get a VPN or proxy later down the road, consider it.   Best of luck."
GirlGamers,3d32nn,LlamaDownUnder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:55:05 2015 UTC,Yea not looking for a career. haha.  I did not display my real first or last name in the account that I do have that I use to watch stuff. I also have a VPN.
GirlGamers,3d32nn,sajedene,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm also a new streamer. Do you have any advice on how to get more involved in the twitch community? I've heard that hosting other streamers is good, but now I only have ten viewers (on a good day and all good friends who come and watch) and I don't know if that's enough for my hosting to really be considered... anything."
GirlGamers,3d32nn,LlamaDownUnder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:48:25 2015 UTC,"Hosting is best used for two ways, the first is to let your audience discover someone new and the second is to show your audience a streamer you enjoy watching. While both benefit from having a lot of viewers to send, it isn't a requirement either.  The most obvious thing to get more involved is to watch other streams and participate in chat. Follow the Twitch chat etiquette rules and don't promote yourself or your stream in their chat. Pretty much don't do anything you don't want others to do in yours. If the topic of you streaming comes up, sure, mention it. But don't start linking your Twitch stream. Stuff like that. Meet the people in chat, interact, etc. Make friends. Friends will be the ones to jump to your stream. The streamer will be more likely to support a friend than someone they don't know.  From my experience, my regulars have hosted me with as little as zero viewers. I still appreciate it and thank them profusely. And it goes both ways, when I can promote or host them, I do. Easier than some random person."
GirlGamers,3d32nn,Nyaliah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Yeah I was a bit worried as being seen as silly hosting a channel when I have few viewers, but it's great to hear that it's always seen as a good thing."
GirlGamers,3d32nn,Danorexic,6,Thu Jul 16 00:26:16 2015 UTC,"You really have to see what works for you and what you enjoy to do.  I started streaming 2 months ago, I average 10viewers (just shy of 400 followers) which is small but I have awesome regulars I am looking forward to talk to.  I don't stream with gigantic cleavage and get comments about that. I tried the cleavage thing and didn't like it. My viewer count was obviously higher but a lot of immature boys trolling around. I rather grow slower and have a relaxed chat than getting annoyed at children all day. And personally I don't feel comfortable with my boobs hanging out. I have my personal rule of ""would I go to work like this?"" to determine if I can stream with what I am wearing.  Get mods. There are trolls, what ever you do, there will be trolls. I still didn't figure out why people troll and troll so much, but they do. Seems to be fun to go in a 10 viewer channel and post hitler asciis or what ever.  And as a female streamer, be cautios. Don't ever give out your skype contact, don't join TS server you don't know, never make your IP public in any way. 4chan/raid forums user have too much time on their hands and most likely some issue, but they like to raid streams, especially female streamers.  Most importantly: Have fun."
GirlGamers,3d32nn,cerulean_skylark,3,Mon Jul 13 08:22:30 2015 UTC,"Since you mentioned trolls. Be sure to have a good password. And make sure all your other accounts have good passwords.

GirlGamers,3d32nn,unusualfowl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:46:54 2015 UTC,This is true. Often i am the only one streaming whatever i stream. So most of my viewers are super-fans that followed the game and see me pop up randomly after 6 months haha
GirlGamers,3d32nn,StrykerNoStriking,4,Mon Jul 13 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"I've only been streaming for a little while and it's kind of more of a when I have time hobby (so I only have a handful of followers) but I've learned a few things that I think seem to make it better.    Consistent schedule seems to help. I'm always a little late, but I stream 3 times a week. Mondays: Wild Card night, usually something I've never played before but looked interesting. Thursdays: Nintendo Multiplayer (Smash, Splatoon, etc). Saturdays are Turn-based strategy and 4X's. So being a variety streamer kinda seems to work. I was doing Tuesdays, but I just dropped them for various and sundry reasons. Enjoy what you're streaming. I tried streaming TES:O, and I just didn't like it. There wasn't enough action happening, all these fetch quests, not enough monster slaying, and I didn't feel like it was very fun. I was streaming Witcher III for a bit, and that was fun at first, then it got frustrating because I just wanted to FINISH THE DAMN GAME (which I still haven't b/c life). I've also tried streaming Skyrim, Niehr, and the Stick of Truth, and they didn't really seem to feel right. RPG's just don't do well, which is a shame because it's half of what I play just as a gamer. I try to pretty much always be saying something of some sort. I play a lot of strategy games, and I've gotten the feedback that it's interesting to hear someone ""more strategic"" explain their process. So I talk about where I'm moving my units, why I'm choosing to focus on a certain resource, my multi-turn plans, how I might be able to move through a certain space, whatever. I'm also, just, naturally vocal when I'm playing something competitive, so that's really easy to move into the stream. Kinda like ""where are you blue team? WHERE ARE YOU? I sniped him off the tower. TAKE THE FREAKING TOWER!"" kind of stuff. Or I'll just have general conversations about nothing, tell a story about Smash or something interesting that happened to me that day that was funny. I got into a REALLY great discussion while playing Endless Legend with someone in chat about the economic ramifications of creating a trade system with an alien race. I've watched streams of other players (Hearthstone seems to be the worst offender) where they have cams and are kinda sorta talking but they aren't SAYING anything, and it drives me crazy. But then they have like 1000 followers and I'm like what?  Try co-op on occasion, maybe? I play with my husband sometimes, and just talking to each other and maybe trash talking the other team (they can't hear us, because that would be awful) together has made for a handful of pretty funny/interesting streams. One time he just hopped on a mic while I was playing TES:O, and that made it slightly more interesting. He had been playing for about two days longer, and had a few tips and tricks.  Camera: I started not using a cam simply because I didn't have one. I got one to use for another project, so I gave it a little bit of test run. I didn't see much difference until one particular night which I told r/girlgamers about once before where I got a shitstorm of negative comments. Well, I'm pretty vindictive, at my core, so I've kept using my cam to be like ""HA! You thought you could tear me down. Nope! I'm here, and I play games, kiss my ass."" However, if I'm streaming straight from my PS4, I don't have a cam (because I'm not shelling out the money for it) or if I feel like it's going to take up too much of the gaming space on the screen. This is especially relevant for 4X's where you really need to be able to see everything. Because for me, as much as I want us all to be entertained together, I also don't want to detract from the game itself. That's just kinda my style, though.    Things I know that can be improved upon:    I only stream three days a week, now, and generally only for two hours (four on Saturday if I'm in a ""thing""), so only six to eight hours a week. For me, that's just about as much as I want to do because I have two part time jobs, a spouse, a kidling hopefully in the next few years, and other hobbies and blogs I'm working on. I also have to cancel streams because I'm busy doing IRL things, sometimes. I recognize that this means my channel will probably stay small, but I'm okay with that. I still have fun doing it and engaging with people, and I get a trickle of new followers every week. I'm not 100% the games I choose to stream are games that anyone gives a crap about. I don't play MOBA's or MMO's, really, and those seem to be the biggest draws. I'm also still working out when I should play what and timing and such. Like, I was playing Endless Legend on Saturdays for about five weeks straight, and I was getting the same little group of 3 each time. That was cool. Then there was one week where I just didn't feel like playing Endless Legend so I switched to Tropico 5. I got other viewers, but my EL guys didn't come to Tropico with me.  I have a really hard time just picking one game and playing that week after week. I tried doing TES:O Tuesdays, and after about three weeks it was just boring. I didn't want to be playing TES:O every Tuesday from 8-10. Same thing when I tried Rogue-like Thursdays and Platformer Mondays. I wanted to be playing something else or sewing or reading manga or something. That's kinda why I settled into this kinda style-oriented three day a week model. It gave me structure, but also wiggle room to play what I wanted.    That's all I can think of, and I hope it helps.   My twitch is in my tag, but I also export most of my VOD's to my youtube.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPFxp3aJKSjQJo5W0KSNEkQ  It's a little unorganized at the moment, because I just did some exporting, and I need to go through and fix my playlists. Just haven't had the time."

GirlGamers,3d32nn,ArchCypher,2,Wed Jul 15 16:45:54 2015 UTC,"Personally(!) I prefer watching people who are good at whichever game they choose to play, however there's a market out there for everyone, and if you're entertaining, people don't need you to be great. There are even streams around people who are terrible but they make their failures entertaining.  About levels, if you don't make the leveling process boring (""Just watch me while I kill a couple of mobs... and same... and same..."") then you can easily stream leveling, it will also attract more people who are newer to the game and might not always understand what's going on in the high level streams and hope to find more information on lower level streams.  Get a regular schedule, I do weekday daytime streams, but due to my sleeping i rarely start on time. For example, I shouldve started 5 minutes ago, but im waiting for breakfast to get ready because I hit snooze for 3 hours. Don't be me.  Camera only if you're comfortable with it, though it'll be easier to get a following if you do have a camera. You're also giving something else for the harassers to focus on, but eh, there'll always be something, and as long as you're comfortable with your looks and capable of deflecting/not shy of banning, it will be fine.  I stream Dark Souls 2 atm, though I'm going on a week break on wednesday because I'm visiting my parents. Still, feel free to toss me a follow if you want: http://www.twitch.tv/genfaux I stream during daytime EU."

Yeah, once you find the perfect character for yourself, the game just becomes so much more enjoyable. I tend to get a tad obsessive about perfection in character customization, but it's important to me... especially for FFXIV since you can just switch classes on one character."
GirlGamers,3d1fmg,risky-pixels,2,Wed Jul 15 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely. On one hand I love that I can get really attached to one character and play multiple classes but on the other hand that just makes it more important to get them right.   Elezen and Lalafell are fairly rare, Hyur and Miqo'te are most common, and you hardly ever see Roegadyn. I started as Miqo'te but fell in love with Elezen after playing the game. I spent so long in character creation my friends were making fun of me for not actually playing.  I'm surprised Highlanders are not more popular, I find they look way cooler than Midlanders."

I think it's stupid because I'm not really looking for the player's reaction on cam since I don't really focus on the face of the player. Their voice is enough for me.   I look for games that I want but I stay for the commentary.   The best way to look at it is that if I'm just listening to the video and I'm still entertained, it has awesome commentary.   I think for an average let's play, I think 30 min part a video is great  But for uploads that just focus on a summary of a game, 15-20 minutes is fine."

Having your face up there in front of people is one more way to show that there's a ""real"" person up there, rather than hiding behind the typical internet anonymity.  For example: It's harder to gain a following here on Reddit than it is on LinkedIn, due to the anonymity factor. That, and most marketing people understand that, while Reddit has a huge potential, pre-segmented audience from which to benefit, they totally don't get the culture.  So generally speaking and barring random acts of RNGesus, using a cam is one of the ""standard"" streamer things to do to build up a community & trust. That and Twitter.  Edit: Downvote for... what? Explaining?"

GirlGamers,3czwyb,LolaRuns,14,Sun Jul 12 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'm probably not a very representative viewer. If you look around, who gets the most views, certain styles are more popular.   Personally, I don't much care for camera view (note this goes for youtube let's plays, I watch a lot more of those compared to twitch and to me twitch isn't really the best medium there, I prefer twitch for more rounds based games a la Hearthstone or the various MOBAs), imo the only one where it really makes sense are jumpscare style horror games. But for anything where the game actually has a story? I prefer the game and the characters to be the focus, no the person playing it.   I personally like people who talk really in depth about their decisions and what they are doing and people who display in depth knowledge about the game compared to people who go off on tangents or who are making fun. => again, if you look who is actually popular, this is a minority opinion.   I also really like people who will laugh spontaneously when they fail compared to people who will rage. Dodger's ""They Bleed Pixels"" let's play is a good example of it.   I'm not the biggest fan of LPs where two or more people are talking, outside of certain genres (it works for dating sims for me, because those often have quite shallow gameplay)."

GirlGamers,3czwyb,DigbyMayor,10,Sun Jul 12 15:00:14 2015 UTC,"I'm personally a big fan of more critical Let's Plays, people that really know the game better than regular players where they take the time to get into the nitty gritty and tinier details of a game. Some good examples are MatthewMatosis and his Demon's Souls playthrough or Super Great Friend and his Deadly Premonition playthrough. As a result I'm a fan of longer videos that really give the player the time and space to talk about as much as they can, although if you're thinking about doing it professionally I really don't think this format is as commercially viable as shorter and quicker to put out videos.  For me face cam is usually a big turn off. I like how a few live streamers utilise it, more as a thing to switch on after big moments or for direct commentary/discussion with the viewers. But as a regular little box in the bottom corner, it usually distracts and detracts for me.  I frequently watch recorded live streams, if you do take that route and end up interacting with chat at all please take the time to record the chat alongside the gameplay video. It's very frustrating to watch a recorded stream where the player is having an indepth discussion with the viewers, and you only get half the conversation watching it later."

GirlGamers,3czwyb,kezza596,3,Sun Jul 12 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"Cam view: I don't really care about it, sometime its fun but most of the time I find it distracting.  I'd say I like to watch the entire game, not necessarily the entire stream. Like, if you have to retry several time or you spend a lot time figuring things out, I'm usually the kind of watcher that get bored. It does not mean you have to play fast and not enjoy the game, but it might be interesting to have a ""recut"" of the stream later that exclude the try and fail process and that show the plot of the game at a good pace in your lets play. Don't know if I make any sense, tell me if you need me to reword that bit.  Usually around 20mn is good for the length.    Cutting your lets play and uploading them on YouTube would be a very good idea I think.   As for the genre mashup, I watch the LPers I watch for themselves. Because they have a great personality, because I like to see what they think of the game or their reaction crack me up. Stay true to yourself I'd say, don't think too much of the genre.   Also, most LPers I watch really bring something more to the game. Sometime its history of video games, when they tell you anecdotes and fact related to the game. Sometime its a reaction really different from mine but that I find interesting. Sometime its just they are really good and I can improve myself thanks to them.  Added value, in short."

Be at an angle, be well lit, and only occasionally look into the cam.  Never take up too much of the screen. I'm here for the content, not for your face.   I like my episodes between 15-30 minutes, this is enough time whilst I'm doing other things (most of my YouTubing happens whilst I'm cooking, eating, cleaning, etc). However I don't mind longer ones that I can click through.  If you've got face cam, keep talking, particularly in live streams. I'm looking at you, I naturally want to feel engaged. I don't want you staring gormlessly out of the screen at me for periods of time. Without face cam, there's no awkward staring if you fancy being silent.  Your gaming needs to be entertaining and engaging if you want people to stream it. YouTube and Twitch have entirely different audiences and styles. You can get away with silly behaviour and fancy editing on YouTube, you can't on Twitch. Twitch is purely you and your current activity. Talk to me, but don't ramble. It bores me. Tell me about the game, what you know about it, experiences you've had with it or other similar games before. Tell me your theory on the story, or the lore, or your plans for character development. I hate to sound harsh, but until you build up a loyal following, no one cares about what you had for dinner, or that funny story about you and your friend that one time.   This is just me and my opinion. I've tried to be as factual and honest as I can. I am only one person, one viewer, and I may like what others hate, and vice versa. But I hope it helps to shape the general consensus.  YouTubers I watch are: Markiplier, CinnamonToastKen, Cryaotic, RaedWulfGamer, Jacksepticeye, muyskerm, Ohmwrecker, and LordMinion777. Like I said, a lot of my YouTubing is done in the background whilst I'm busying about. I want it to be entertaining, humorous, engaging and interesting to watch.  I used to watch Pewdiepie but he got too shrieky for my liking, and all videos became the same. I used to watch TheRadBrad, but he uses the same 3 or 4 catch phrases over and over and it just annoyed me too much. I used to watch some guy I've forgotten the name of, but his face cam was direct on and he just made unfunny, poor jokes that pulled me out of the atmosphere."

I also watch League VODs that are collected and organized from streams.  What do you mean by the last question, length of each part or length of the entire letsplay? For the latter I'm good with anything, for the first I like decent length so I can sit down, relax, and not have to load another page for a while. 30 minutes - an hour is ideal for me."

Want to binge a game for 4 hours and just stream it? Go for it. Want to play 15 minutes? Go for it. Just choose a setup and keep it relatively constant and give some indication of when the next episode will broadcast and you'll probably pick up a few regular viewers.   I don't personally watch let's plays but if you aren't looking to go viral or anything then it should be your opinion which comes first. And remember you can always change the nature of your channel if you want to change it to go in a different direction if gaining viewers becomes more important to you.

GirlGamers,3czwyb,CupcakeKazu,2,Mon Jul 13 13:28:51 2015 UTC,"I personally don't like cameras unless there's going to be a significant amount of expression. Most of the time, it's just watching someone stare at a screen and occasionally look around. It somehow manages to be boring and distracting at the same time.   I prefer let's plays over saved live streams. The chat is nice when it's live, but when it's recorded, it feels kind of irrelevant and distracting. Especially when there's a bunch of completely unrelated conversations going on.   I'd say 20-30 minutes is a good length. Shorter is okay too. I don't usually plan my evening around watching let's plays, so if it's much longer than that, I won't bother clicking on it. This also depends on what kind of demographic you're going for though. I know some people who just LOVE gaming who will sit down and watch hours of livestreams or let's plays at a time.   This is unsolicited, but one of the biggest factors for whether or not I'm going to watch a let's play is the audio quality. Some of the things that bug me the most are frequent mic popping, audio way too loud or quiet, and bad balance of voice and game audio in either direction (if the game audio is relevant). Spend a little bit of time recording yourself and experimenting with volume, balance, and mic placement (and even your tone and inflection if you want), and it'll go a long way."

Anyhow, my preferences:  I like face cam small enough to not obscure game. I slightly prefer having cam to not having it, but it's also nice to have it just be the game on screen. I respect channels more without face cam, but getting hyped for a game is better when you see player getting hyped as well.  I watch archived let's plays about as often as I watch live streams. I don't really care that much about interaction with the player most of the time. Sometimes its nice.  Individual video length doesn't really matter that much, +25min. Shorter than that makes it kinda annoying since usually you don't have much happening in that short time."

It can be nice for blind LP's (the only kind I watch, really) for certain story heavy games where you can watch the genuine reaction on the face of the player when things unfold. But I'm generally just as happy to just have commentary.  I watch saved streams sometimes, but the chatting with the viewers is a little distracting. It's not an ideal situation. But generally I don't mind it.  The longer Let's Plays the better, as far as I'm concerned. :) But I get that it's not always practical to record, encode and upload 1 hour+ streams though, depending on schedule and if you LP more than one games.

GirlGamers,3czwyb,Cherrysmurf92,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"I don't watch a lot of gamer channels, but the ones I do watch are TheRadBrad, Vinesauce and Jerma985.   I particularly like TheRadBrad's playthroughs and watch them a lot. There's no cam view. He actually does play mostly horror games but I'm not watching because I want to see a person's  reaction so I don't really care about faces. I feel that his comments are relaxed and unobtrustive, even when he's discussing things that arent about the game at times. When he does comment I just like it because it enhances what I'm seeing and lets me know how he's feeling about certain parts.  I watch Vinesauce's past livestreams. Vinesauce tends to post their past livestreams but they usually advertise the cut and edited versions of those streams. Usually if I like the edit enough I'll go back and watch the stream too.  With Let's Plays I guess it depends doesnt it? If you're doing a stream, an hour seems okay. I like TheRadBrad's because he usually posts full series to youtube and they're in parts. If I can't finish watching the whole thing, I can remember what part I was on and go back to it."

More importantly -- you can be found using your IP; basically the person trying to trace you would call up your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and pretend to be a technician. Said bad guy would then spout enough technobabble to convince your ISP that he's one of their tech guys and that he needs access to your account information. The manager then hands over the information, and the hacker has all of your details -- like your home address.   It's scary stuff, so if you might be singled out for some reason (like you're a streamer on twitch) I highly recommend taking some security precautions."

I'm gonna just drop a bunch here -- I'm pretty sure you can get most of these through Steam:  Ones I've played and loved: Psychonauts, Broken Sword 1-4, Dreamfall:The Longest Journey, Portal and Portal 2, Syberia and Syberia 2, the entire Gabriel Knight series, Grim Fandango, Runaway, the Black Mirror series, all the Bioshock games [especially Bioshock Infinite], Dishonored, all of Jonathan Boakes's games (the Dark Fall Games and The Lost Crown), of course the Myst series, and, a little off the beaten path, but fuck it, you basically roll a ball around big awesome worlds --> any of the Katamari games.  Also, have you considered a MMORPG?  I got sucked into World of Warcraft for a LONG time, mostly just walking around and doing random stuff like fishing + gathering herbs.   Also, things I have but haven't got around to looking at yet but are in my stash: Broken Age, The Wolf Among Us, Game of Thrones, Broken Sword 5.  If you've played any of these already and liked/not liked them, I can probably give you even more refined suggestions, because I'm leaving out a ton.

GirlGamers,3cyetn,Elaine_Benes_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:11:03 2015 UTC,It looks like such a rip off of Gone Home   They're not the same. Life is Strange is more of a traditional adventure game in the style of Walking Dead or Tales from the Borderlands.

I'm running on 3h sleep so I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot and/or giving some poor recommendations, so apologies if these aren't what you're at all looking for. The games you listed are all pretty different from one another so it's hard for me to know quiet what you're after.  If you are just interested in more episodic adventure games which play similarly to DC, Life is Strange, The Wolf Among Us, Kentucky Route Zero (kinda), and The Walking Dead are worth checking out. All fairly linear, but might still interest you for other reasons."

Don't get me wrong; I love DnD and I have played in some very interesting, original, intricate and mature campaigns.

GirlGamers,3cszrd,JRutterbush,4,Fri Jul 10 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"It's the fantasy opposite of Conan the Barbarian style sword and sorcery. The pantheon includes gender diversity and sexual preference diversity. So do the social cultural settings. There's a strong sense of corruption when doing morally questionable acts. There are strong themes of doing good in a world where the answers of what ""good"" is aren't easy or clear.

Besides the diplomacy, there's also a strong focus on character relationships, like friendship and romance. There's also rules written to include gay and trans characters and NPCs. The setting also seems to be a bit more modern than DnD. (I've never played Pathfinder, so I can't speak to that.) There's also a focus on more complicated and larger civilizations, where DnD is pretty focused on kingdoms and small villages."

I get that LGBT folk being included is good... what I want to know, though, is what rules could there be regarding it? Do gay people get a +2 bonus to Fashion Sense checks? Do trans people have a bonus to Empathy checks against people of their original assigned gender because they lived that life for a while? Obviously, these specific rules examples would come off as pretty offensive, but that's kind of my point: I can't think of any actual game rules that would do anything other than play into played up stereotypes.  Or did you mean to say ""They're explicitly written into the setting."" rather than ""There are rules written to include them.""?"

I believe you once said that you live in a cave. How do you get electricity there?  As a dragon I believe that you are a rather solitary creature. How do you deal with loneliness?  If you could take care of pets, what type would you wish for?  What media portrays dragons accurately? What portrays dragons poorly?  What would you say to young children who are beginning to lose faith in magic, magical creatures and fantasy being real? I was one of those young girls who was particularly hit very hard when I realized that magic wasn't real. I read too much and I think I was maybe 14. I clearly remember crying when I came to the conclusion that I will never actually go on a daring quest, fight monsters or duel with witches and wizards.  So, what would you have said to me and others like me who still hope to someday find such a place? ( think it might be in a book... Maybe I should take a look...)

Sure, there are those who consider game making ""merely entertainment"", but every game maker I know don't consider themselves making entertainment, they make an amazing idea that they're passionate about.

Does anybody else just get angry at advertisements for video games that show you almost no actual game play? It seems like video game commercials are crazily overdone these days and while they can certainly look cool sometimes, seeing ""live-action"" commercials like these tells you absolutely nothing about what the game looks like while you actually play it. I seriously can't stand most ads for video games because of this. I would never purchase a game without seeing some actual gameplay but the commercials on TV certainly don't give you that.

I find more friendly/neutral people than negative people, and the negative people are always called out.   I tried ranked for the first time at the end of season 3, and I won 9 out of my 10 placement matches. The 1 game I lost was the only game with a negative player.  People who play ranked think they're the only ones taking it seriously, when like 90% of the time, everyone else on the team is too.

GirlGamers,3ctgic,Dr_Trixie,50,Fri Jul 10 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"The game industry actively breeds a group of belligerent hooligans for profit. And the longer this process continues, the tighter the vicious circle becomes: only violent games sell well, so only those get made, so only violent people buy games, and so on.  A game developer who claims to be a peaceful tolerant person while producing murder simulators is a hypocrite. I will not accuse them of being directly responsible for mass shootings and online harassment. But they are beyond a doubt guilty of neglecting to prevent such things.   The author is a complete nutjob.   But they are beyond a doubt guilty of neglecting to prevent such things.   Neglecting to prevent mass shootings? How the fuck does a game developer stop a mass shooting.  By this insane ""logic"" an author who writes a book with violence in it cannot be a peaceful tolerant person. An actor who stars in a TV show with violence cannot be a peaceful tolerant person.   We don’t need theories about the correlation between violent games and violent behavior. Many players of violent and antagonistic games engage in violent and antagonistic behavior. Whether violent people are attracted to games or games arouse violent emotions is irrelevant. Anyone who has ever been attacked by a gamer lynch party knows that a certain number of people who play antagonistic and violent games are aggressive, intolerant, reactionary, misogynist, and so on.   He makes the ignorant assumption that there is a correlation between violent video games and violent behavior being linked together(Something that has been proven to be completely untrue), and bases his ENTIRE opinion-vomit on it?   the tighter the vicious circle becomes: only violent games sell well, so only those get made, so only violent people buy games, and so on.   He even theorizes that everyone who plays violent video games is or will be a violent person.   And they can easily offload their responsibility onto each and every individual player of their games in an appropriation of the “guns don’t kill people” mentality of the American weapons lobby. True enough, a gun does not cause murder by itself. But equally true is that the absence of a gun can prevent murder.   And he tries to make the argument that without violent video games, there would be less violence in the world. Something that is inherently untrue.   This article, the author and his logic are all fucking insane.  As to the OP;   All well and true. Gamers shouldn't hide behind flimsy studies made in academic environments because there's very much a seed of truth in this article.   No. There was no ""seed of truth"" in this article. It was all speculative bullshit and factless/baseless assumptions."

I'd recommend following the video link to youtube instead of watching it embedded here with RES, there are some time stamps around a disturbing section of footage (a real suicide) in case you want to skip it.  As someone who has played hours of violent video games nearly every day since I was 6 years old, I couldn't watch it.  But the points he makes during the rest of the video are worth listening to.  However, I think that many violent video games are an expression of American culture and our obsession with war.  Art games can certainly thrive and many good ones have proved to be very popular.  But triple-A companies are only interested in marketing to groups of teenage boys under social pressure to conform to American ideals of stoicism and aggression, so that's the kind of video games those companies are going to keep making until they pull their heads out of their asses."
GirlGamers,3ctgic,Drakkanrider,24,Fri Jul 10 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"Dear Op  I just defended my BA thesis about American censorship during the occupation of Japan. I can assure you that violent media has been blamed for everything since ever. Once Americans decided that Japanese culture has to be purged of everything violent and feudal, they culled Shakespeare with the same stroke of pen they crossed Nazi propaganda. At one point censor decided that all public transport tickets should have equal price, because  Japanese are not capable of disconnecting class inequality from feudalism.  No to censorship. Never. Adult people should be able to recognize fact and fiction. And children should be educated by said adults."
GirlGamers,3ctgic,Vykoso,14,Fri Jul 10 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"Not that I  at all agree with the absurdity that is the linked article, but there's a clear line between actual censorship and societal forces just pushing media away from one particular form of expression.  It's a wholly different thing to say ""We should make fewer violent games"" than it is for the government to say ""You are not allowed to make violent games.""  This comes up pretty frequently with regards to better portrayals of women in video games, so I'm a bit surprised the censorship topic came up."
GirlGamers,3ctgic,CJGibson,4,Fri Jul 10 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"Ok so since i started with my thesis, I will give you another example from it.   American censorship was ( to simplify) organized by 2 units: Civiil Intelligence Section (CIS) and Civil Education and Information (CI&E)  The first one was banning stuff, invigilation and so on. The second one was more propaganda, and advising.  CIS were pretty straightforward - this is banned, you can't print/show that.   CI&E were in no position to ban anything, they were analyzing and then advising.   Guess what happens when some guy who has any authority behind him start bouncing ideas off someone who is afraid of potential consequences of not agreeing with them. And mind the fact that since our censor does not explicitly order anything, he may say something without thinking twice.  If there is a problem with violence in our culture lets discuss our culture. If there is some particularly outrageous work, lets discuss that piece. Or even better, lets take a closer look on controversial fragments in context of the whole work.  Pointing the finger towards any broad category, be it demographic or else, and saying some truism leads to crying wolf, scapegoating, and generally derailing discussion.   New media are always criticized. Ancient philosophers complained that people not memorize everything by heart, but rely on notes. They literally believed that writing things down make people stupid."
GirlGamers,3ctgic,Vykoso,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:24:49 2015 UTC,No it's my fault. I put:   So what do you guys think? Violent games = violent thoughts?

I think a lot of this article sounds like any other article during the time when banning violent games was actually something people debated for real.
GirlGamers,3ctgic,CJGibson,6,Fri Jul 10 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"Fair.  Even so, I generally think ""we"" is pretty vague there.  ""We"" as a society could say ""We've moved past this form of entertainment.""  ""We"" as game developers could say ""We aren't interested in making these kinds of games any more.""  There are lots of ways ""we"" could ""do away with"" violent games beyond true censorship.  But I do see how one could interpret your statement as a call for censorship."

GirlGamers,3ctgic,dragonzflyte,5,Fri Jul 10 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"How are games any more influential than any other type of violent media? Watching a show about a serial killer or a drug dealer - well, that's alright, but playing a game about such things? Open the flood gates! Fox News Ahoy!  People say games have more impact because it puts the player in control - YOU shot that guy, YOU robbed that bank, but it's no different from the brainless action movies we're surrounded by. The movies ask you to delight in the fact that that explosion happened, that that guy got shot, that that robot just ripped a car in half in the exact same way games have you interact with those actions. You do it do in a video game to have fun, but you also watch it in a movie to have fun. The pleasure is derived from the same thing. Violent movies and games and entertaining for the same reason.  Games get the brunt of the complaints because they're a more recent invention, and so it's easier to make these claims about them when you don't have 100 years of evidence that monkey see monkey do doesn't apply (in the case of games - avatar monkey do, monkey do?).  I do take issue with rising levels of violence in the media but I don't think games are any more responsible than any other medium for it, or for any violence in the real world. The topic of what violence in the media really does is a whole other barrel of monkeys that would take a whole book to try to delve into, but for now, my TL;DR is that games get a bad rep when it comes to the monkey see monkey do violence argument."

And the premise that violent games have impact on non violent games makes me think that perhaps the author has some sort of mental deficiency to put it gently.  Games like Doom or GTA have coexisted with Kyrandia, Sam n Max, Sims, Rayman and about a shit ton of other games since the dawn of games. I smell this obsession with ""games need to grow up/we can do better"" rhetoric, and for some reason in case of games people give it credit, while i assume the same people would just shake their head in disbelief if the same was said about books, movies or music.   I think game developers, as creative people, probably middle class, probably intellectuals, underestimate how unstable some members of their audience are, how isolated they live, how little access they have to education and broader culture, how little context to place these games in that are so important to their sense of self.   Well, what do you say to someone who pens a paragraph like that? Help me out because i sure as hell don't without making the response 90% profanity."
GirlGamers,3ctgic,Myuym,3,Sun Jul 12 11:56:01 2015 UTC,"I feel as if the article suffers more from using terms poorly and lacking support rather than missing an actual point. He shouldn't have used ""violence"" when he seems to refer more to aggression and toxic behavior. So it's less violence begets violence, and violence begets aggressive behavior. There are numerous examples he could've brought up about this: SWATing, sending threats, harassment in general, but didn't. Furthermore, is he talking about all violent games? Or just violent games with a competitive aspect? Again, he falls short on defining his terms. There is a definite point that competitive games often become breeding grounds for harassment and aggressive behavior, but Samyn doesn't specifically say that. Instead he compares it to breeding violent behavior in general which has been overwhelmingly disproved by studies. It doesn't help that he's written a scant few paragraphs on something that could probably be better defined and examined in 20 or more pages. Also from the title I figured that this article was going to be more about how violent games are giving little room for more innovative game concepts to arise which would have been an interesting read. Overall, I feel like his point gets convoluted in poorly defined terms and trying to be all over the place with his unclearly defined argument."
GirlGamers,3ctgic,ender1200,2,Fri Jul 10 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"The reason there's so much violence in games is... what else do you do? I'm serious!  Games are, first and foremost, a medium of storytelling and expression. In any given book/movie/etc, there's an interest curve. A hook, exposition, people talk and swagger and things happen and build. The unique challenge of games is to make every single goddamn moment of that curve exciting and interactive, because anything less makes for poor gameplay.  Well, what can you really do to suss up the gameplay of, say, Star Wars? Sure, there's plenty of action, but not a lot of it would be terribly engaging to take part in. There are meetings, there's training, and then there's legitimate just travel from places of interest. And you can't give the player control of most of these incidents, because then you have to come up with branching paths for the story to take.  So, and to the industry's utter shame, the only real answer we've come up with thus far is combat. Throw in random monsters along every path, and suddenly every single part of the game can be interactive without completely designing a new activity for the player.  Which is pretty much why Sunset failed so abysmally. They came up with a reasonable story and set pieces, and then they have no way to make them interactive in an interesting way. You spend the entirety of the game cleaning, which in this case is just walking around an empty apartment pressing A on things. Maybe it does look a little worse for wear when compared to the high-octane violent games we love, but it didn't have much going for it in the first place either.  We're in luck though. Despite being limited to very few ways to make every moment of a given story interactive, all of the violence in these games doesn't breed a generation of hyperaggressive little bastards."

I'd prefer not to say my actual town, so I'll give a town near me, Pensacola.   I started playing around 5 or 6.  Yes, I was encouraged to play; by my father and two older brothers.   I play about, hmm, I'd say 50 or so hours a week. Since I'm young, my school affects how much time I play. Since I'm on summer break right now, I play significantly more than I do while it's the school year.   My brothers are usually nice enough to buy me a game or two every few months. So, none.   It changes with the games I play. You can't play the same game allll the time. It changes only because I get bored of it, really.  I play a mixture of singleplayer only games, and multiplayer games. Also depends on my mood. I play online video games, if I do play multiplayer. The people I play with on these games are friends I've made through the game. So I've never actually met them. Lol   I have, from my brothers a couple times, but more often from the friends I made through the games I play. Sometimes it's a trading thing, where if they buy me a game or something of the sort as a gift, I buy them something back. One particular friend is really just the most amazing and he'll buy his friends games just because he likes that it makes them happy. He's bought me 4 or 5 games in the past couple of months.   Yes, I do. Sort of. Steam, a platform for distributing games has a strong online community and I usually only use that since I play only on PC.  Pretty good. The majority of the time, if you're nice to them, they're nice to you. You get the occaisonal jerk who just likes to rain on other people's parades.   Sometimes. I must say, I welcome it. The earlier they somehow find out I'm a girl, they're much more forgiving if I mess up, or say something stupid; since there's usually a conversation going on during a game. Sometimes, there are the guys who find out you're a girl and just harass you about it. Calling you horrible names and such. The majority the time, it doesn't change anything once they know I'm female, unless I get flirty. Then they warm up to me quickly and treat me like gold, pretty much. Lol  Like I said in the last one, I've experienced it before. But I haven't seen it. Well, verbal abuse to another female at least. Gamers are pretty harsh on each other. I haven't really seen many women game before. Occasionally, yes. But not very often. Could just be the games I play though.   PC. So much more customization, better graphics, and I can listen to music much easier than on xbox or something while playing video games.   The Elder scrolls: Skyrim, Robocraft, Warframe, Fallout: New Vegas and Batman: Arkham Asylum  I always choose a female character. Just nicer to look at. Especially since some of the games you can create a character in, are very long games. it's nice to be able to look at something pretty for a long time.   Not really. I go by what the developers have made in the past and if it was good, most of the time. If not, I go by if it sounds fun. Nothing really controls what sounds like fun though.   I like them. Yes, they're sexualised. But so are the guys! They have huge buldges and giant muscles. I feel like the female characters are potrayed well, most of the time.   Well, it depends on the game. Not all games have people in them. But if they do have people in them, I like there to be women in them. It creates diversity and let's be honest; girls are pretty. They're nice to look at. It's a nice change from (most of the time) bloody and dirty guys.   If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask me! I don't mind and I'd love to help some more!"

No one encourage me to play when I was younger..I just like playing the games.   On average, how many hours a week do you play? I play up to 8 hrs a day on playing games.  On average, how much money do you spend on gaming related items a year? well I try to limit my self to 100 bucks but sometimes I get a little carried away..lol Would you say that, with time, your interest in the activity has increased, decreased or remained the same? If there was any change, why do you think this happened?  My interest grew threw time..when I realized I could use gaming as a way of keeping me out of trouble. Do you prefer to play alone or with others? If you prefer to play with others, with whom do you usually play? I usually am playing alone but often times I play with others. Usually with clan mates or friends. Do you usually get or have you ever gotten gaming related items as gifts? Never have I gotten gaming related items as gifts unless you count me giving myself said gifts. Do you have an account on online platforms, such as X-box live or gaming forums? Yes I do..i have accounts on steam, xbox, and psn If yes, how do you rate your relationship with the other members of the community? not that good im more of the listener then the talker..lol   10.Did you ever feel you were treated differently by other (male) gamers because you were a woman? If yes, how?   yes very much so once they realize that your a girl some would call you names or just bitch. Others will say its cool or want you to play with them. But the majority really don't like girls playing games.  11.Have you ever suffered or witnessed any case of verbal abuse? If yes, please discuss it.   of course pretty much most of my gaming life.   12.What is your favorite gaming platform? (X-box, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, smartphone or tablet, etc.)   mine is playstation..it use to be sega but they don't make consoles any more. I also would say xbox but the controllers are a bit too big for my small hands.  13.What type of games do you usually play? Name your favorite games. (maximum of 5)   call of duty series   resident evil series   final fantasy series   metal gear solid series   infamous series  14.When given the option to create/choose your character, do you have any preferences between male or female characters?  actually yea I love to use the male character and then when they hear me talk they are like wait a minute that's a chick talking..damn I thought it was a guy cause of the avatar.   15.Would you be more inclined to buy a game if it had a female character as the lead?  No I wouldn't   16.What is your opinion on the female characters we currently have in games?  I have no opinion on that one  17.Do you believe it is important for women to be represented in games?  yes cause its always been males are better then females and females aren't supposed to be playing male type games but of course we do and some do it even better then males.   Any more questions don't hesitate to ask."

GirlGamers,3cl0wf,pplandtheirair,5,Wed Jul 8 19:02:08 2015 UTC,My boyfriend and I are currently (and very slowly) playing through Borderlands 2 and Portal 2 together. I also watch him play WindWaker on wii u occasionally.  I've never played borderlands and I freaking LOVE IT!
GirlGamers,3cl0wf,erissaid,3,Wed Jul 8 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"I got it into my head to go back to all my old Pokemon games (that I still have hardware for), get them past the Elite 4 and move as many as I can over to ORAS.  I've got Pearl ready to transfer and finally moved my Y-mons over, so the next on the list is HeartGold...  ...and I have no idea what the heck my plan was when I was playing so long ago! I had the fire-type started, which I never do, and the only thing on my team that is even remotely my style is the Graveler (I think I've had one on every first clear team I've had since Gen 1). But there's like...an unevolved Staryu...a Togetic as my flier AND my psychic...goddamned Magneton is my heavy hitter...  I wouldn't even believe that it was my save file if the trainer didn't have my traditional name and all the pokemans have nicknames that I would totally give them. What were you trying to tell me, past self? Was this a warning about my sanity?"

I am still unsure what I want to do with it, but my partner and I are thinking about connecting it to a projector and building a device that projects maps for D&D (and pen and paper RPGs) directly on the table, with some kind of software the GM can use to hide the ""fog of war"" whenever new bits of the map are explored."

I'm over on Balmung -- so same data center, different server. I've been leveling from 50 since the 18th but I'm still only at 55 xD  I love the story, though. No spoilers, but I do sympathize with the dragons in it."
GirlGamers,3cjn7i,Silaryia,2,Wed Jul 8 13:16:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, we're doing our best. :(  Yeah, I've been taking my time and thoroughly enjoying it. Even the moogle quests only barely managed to annoy me, and that was only because of Mogkun hiding under that esfkjdhfs pillar, took me forever to find him. For the most part, I'm actually thoroughly enjoying the sidequests, and have only hit a gated wall in MSQ once or twice. Grinding a dungeon or two has fixed that pretty quickly.  I actually got into an argument with a friend about that. Hraesvelgr is my favorite character ever (my 'bo has been named Hresvelgr since I got her from my GC months and months a go), and while they seem to have made Nidhogg black and white Evil in traditional FF style, I still see his point. :( Haven't finished up MSQ yet, so maybe we'll still get more infor later."
GirlGamers,3cjn7i,Zyrusticae,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:27:35 2015 UTC,"My deepest condolences to you. Undergoing the possibility of losing a loved one is never easy.   If FFXIV talk helps keep your mind off of it, then I'll gladly engage in some.   Thanks to my part time employment and lack of summer classes, I've been able to hit 60 within the two weeks since Early Access. I've already geared out my MCH (mostly, anyway - I refuse to engage with the toxicity that is The Hunt), and now I'm working on leveling my WAR, which is going surprisingly quickly thanks to the armory bonus and the infinite rested bonus XP (which they seem to have lifted the cap on, because I've had entire levels with the green bar).   MCH has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride as people dove into the job to figure out whether or not it actually sucked or the players who played it just sucked. Consensus at this point seems to be that it's actually a bit of both and MCH players just have to work that much harder to keep up. Which is fine for me, really, but it does mean that players of the job are going to be looked at with wary eyes, which is not so fun. Regardless, I enjoy the flavor of it (GUNS! Shootybang! EXPLOSIONS!), so I'll stick with it through thick and thin.   I've messed about with Bismarck EX and Alexander but have yet to get a clear on either of them, though to be fair, I've only made a couple of attempts on each. PUG life is hard, yo. I've been so busy trying to keep up with the leveling that I've scarcely had time left over to try to progress, heh.   My chocobo is soot black, by the way. Thus, it only made natural sense for him to learn to fly (though I know it means nothing in FFXIV because for some reason every chocobo can learn to do so, which as a long-time FF fan kind of weirded me out, but hey, things change).    And yeah, the story is good. And it only escalates from where you are now. Please look forward to it. :3"

GirlGamers,3cjn7i,IronPandemonium,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:53:39 2015 UTC,"I have no sympathy for Nidhogg, though it may be partly because Ishgard is essentially the XIV equivalent of San d'Oria (FFXI)... albeit, a more corrupt version of San d'Oria; that, and I'm elvaan, so teehee i r haet durgunz etc.  I suppose I do have to thank Nidhogg to some degree though, for providing many-a-laugh back in the day in the Dragon's Aery on FFXI, causing many-a-wipe for a variety of scrub-tier linkshells over the years; oh, what fun it was, to intentionally Spike Flail the entire area, so as to cause a multitude of de-levels, due to people never bothering with experience buffers back at level 75.  All this aside, I'm truly sorry to hear that about your little buddy... :/ I still sorely miss my cat from a year and a half-ish back, where he more-or-less passed away from old age; I miss him every single day of my life that passes, but at the same time, I would never, ever want to live a life that didn't include my kind, gentle and loving tuxedo cat."
