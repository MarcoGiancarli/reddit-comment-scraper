His understanding of what makes songs not only melodically but also sonically good is really inspiring. Stadium Arcadium will always be my favorite Chili Pepper album because it reveals these strengths at their upmost. The songs really do grow as they play, and after repeated listens you begin to hear so much more than the time you listened before, even after 9 years. It truly is a masterpiece."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3e0bzg,facial_issues,3,Tue Jul 21 00:05:53 2015 UTC,"You know, there is a common misconception that the chili's view their drug addictions as a bad period of their life. If you look more deeply into their songs, watch some of their interviews and read their autobiographies, you will see that they are very grateful for those dark periods of their life because it brought them happiness and creativity that otherwise be lacking.  For example, in the song Snow, Anthony talks about the social stigma surrounding drug use. In society, people generally look down upon drug use, however, they look up towards drug induced music such as Jimi Hendrix. The resulting loneliness from this hypocrisy is  captured in the line: ""Privately divided by a world so undecided and there's nowhere to go..."".  For this reason, I think you should go with the line: ""I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl."". He isn't just talking about trying to get high by ""making it to the moon"", he's talking about getting to a place that makes you happy and that is fruitful.  That's what I believe anyway, it's up to you at the end of the day."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3e0bzg,cheekymonkey52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:57:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's really changed my view on that line and that's gone back to being top of the list at the moment.   While I don't personally think about drug use as bad, a lot of people that surround me, do. However, relating that line to mean trying to get to your ""happy place"" has given extra reasoning behind it to explain to the ones who look down on the drug use.    That's what I believe anyway, it's up to you at the end of the day.   Thinking about it, you can take that stance with lyrics as a whole. While they do obviously have their meanings behind them from the artists perspective, they're also open for interpretation to the listener to mean what they want them to mean."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3e0bzg,NakedBryan,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:44 2015 UTC,"It kind of sounds like, with the ""Three fingers in the honeycomb"" line, especially, that it means, no matter how much you may struggle at times, and be burnt by those struggles, you're committed to what you believe is who you are, knowing that you can't go back home without knowing that you've at least tried to make your dreams come true."

SA on the other hand was a guitarist's wet dream, and I'm not even a guitarist!  I really thought that was the pinnacle of their work and the blatant hole in the album after was just too big a deficit for me to accept."

Do whatever keeps you improving in the world of music, and be shameless about it!  Philosophy aside, the cover was very good and I enjoyed it. I'm primarily a bassist/pianist so I can't be too much of a judge on the actual technical side of the guitar playing, but I did notice there were a few hiccups/stutters in the rhythm and you were playing slightly in front of the beat quite a lot. While playing in front of the beat can create nice effects, there are some moments in that song where (to my ears) it sounds much better playing tight with the rhythm section.   A great cover though, keep them coming!"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dry3o,phongy,2,Sat Jul 18 22:38:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely messed up spectacularly a few times - Due to the awkward recording set up I had at the time I had a 'that'll do' attitude because i'm lazy haha.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3dry3o,mclollolwub,3,Sat Jul 18 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, never have a ""that'll do"" attitude when recording. Always remember that saying that some guy or girl may or may not have said ""A good musician practices until they get it right, a professional musician practices until they can't get it wrong.""  Also, here's a bit of advice that I should have probably mentioned earlier. When there's bits where it's supposed to be super tight, where you're playing with the rhythms section and not on top of them, know these sections inside out to the point where you're not concentrating on your bit, but how the band sounds as a whole. Really focus on that hi-hat and the strong bass beats. Obviously with a recording this is harder, but it's something to think about.  Anyways, I'm waffling a bit to much."

John never did play a strat with a pearl pickgaurd though. And besides I'm pretty sure he'd never touch active pickups with a ten foot pole.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3dl1qe,ramirof1,8,Fri Jul 17 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"What does everyone make of Josh's song ""teases""? I think something like this (a quick recognizable riff thrown into a jam) is fine and is a nice little bonus for anyone who knows the band's deeper cuts and is paying close attention. However, I feel like I get the equivelent of musicical blue balls when Josh starts playing something rare and the rest of the band just sort of ignores it and moves on. I said in another thread recently that I thought the teases could be a sign of Josh getting frustrated with the lack of diversity in the setlists. I've played in bands and starting to play the riff from a song that everyone is familiar with is generally an invite for them to join in. I do wish they'd mix up the setlists more, but at the same time I wouldn't expect them to bust out an obscure and unrehearsed song live in front of thousands of people on a whim just bc Josh randomly played a second or two of it.  I guess I just wonder what intended purpose of the teases is. If it's Josh's way of saying to the band, ""Let's be spontaneous"" then it's kind of a bummer knowing he feels that way when the rest of the band is content to stick with greatest hits set lists. If they're meant as nods to the hard-core fans that would recognize/appreciate hearing the riff from a rare song, then again I'd say that I personally just end up feeling ""teased"" by them. It's fun hearing the riffs, but it just makes me want to hear the whole song."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dl1qe,DamnHellAssKings,6,Fri Jul 17 13:02:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of Josh being a little tongue-in-cheek with the other members. To fit into his new role, Josh probably spent countless hours learning their material. I believe he has just picked up certain riffs while fiddling around and likes to pop them into live performances while making sure he has the right effect on.  Many of the songs he normally plays are ones that the band has probably forgotten enough of to be played on the spot. (such as Dosed)  It takes a lot of preparation to play a song live that hasn't been played in forever, so the likelihood of an impromptu song is quite slim."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dl1qe,BadcaseofDTB,2,Fri Jul 17 17:34:01 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dl1qe,rhcp192837465,2,Fri Jul 17 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Considering their Setlists very very rarely have any surprises pre 1999 a tease like that is just cruel! Like his stone cold bush tease before 'Look around'. Kills me. Even just one surprise like stone cold bush or backwoods or funky crime, never mind one off One Hot Minute would be amazing."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dl1qe,Tenvsvitalogy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I dont think anyone would want or expect them to start doing exclusively or even mostly pre-1999 material, but to flat out ignore more than half of the music you've released as a band is really limiting. There are so many great RHCP songs that the majority of us will never get to experience live."

Seeing Chad drum live is a thing of beauty. I think it was literally the only thing that could have made the show better. Even my wife, who's not really a rock fan but had a great time at the show, said to me afterwards, ""Chad looks like he has so much fun doing what he does."""

RedHotChiliPeppers,3dhjqv,Asha108,5,Thu Jul 16 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"Long story short; a little more than a month ago they were in Sweden and Dave fell off the stage and broke his leg, but continued the show, so later on they cancelled the UK dates which were like 2 Wembley shows which were sold out and a headline spot at Glastonbury.  Their first date was 4th of july, and while Dave was in the hospital he designed a ""throne"" so he can play the US/Canada dates.   Here's the paper it was designed on  Since obviously his leg will be broken for a while they built that throne so he could play the shows"

My favorite would probably be Californication though.  It was the album that got me into the peppers and it is an iconic cover that I think most people would recognize instantly."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj9zx,rhcp88,9,Thu Jul 16 18:53:08 2015 UTC,One hot minute. Love the inlay card and how the lyrics are written out as well as the cover

I will never hate on it."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj9zx,jakedeva,3,Thu Jul 16 22:39:24 2015 UTC,Same here. I listened to that album almost every day on my bus commute to NYC for my first job after college. I associate that album with finally becoming an adult.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj9zx,DayOff4Superman,3,Fri Jul 17 01:39:58 2015 UTC,"What sucks about Stadium Arcadium's cover is that they passed on Storm Thorgerson's entry for the album cover. I'm sure that would have been amazing, but they went with what we know today.  Storm's opinion on the matter: ""For the Stadium Arcadium cover they elected to feature the title in 'superman' lettering which was already old fashioned in itself, plus some ""planetary embroidery"" and that was it! It was trite, dull and derivative completely unlike the music, which was colourful, eclectic, imaginative, positive, and endlessly inventive. I am not often inclined to publicly criticise the work of others for I see little purchase in it, but there is, in this instance a vested interest, for the Peppers turned down our offerings in favour of this piece of unadventurous graphics. How could they?"""

RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj9zx,nufcneilo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:57:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I had the same response. I really thought that the fly cover was too esoteric for the peppers. The space theme was super cool and I thought was really appropriate for the title track. The reverb on that track just made it feel like you could float around in space and just hear it.

Their original album is a pretty trippy piece of work also.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj110,matthewcovers,11,Thu Jul 16 17:44:14 2015 UTC,I dont listen to the radio so it doesnt bother me. The only thing that sucks is that most people wont hear their best songs because they settle for their singles
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj110,Jibbs74,4,Thu Jul 16 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't get into RHCP until the SA era, so I can't speak so much to the earlier songs, but I definitely got sick of Dani California while it was being blasted everywhere. However, I don't find that it ruined my enjoyment of the song nowadays- almost a decade (!) out from then."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj110,justforviewing8484,4,Thu Jul 16 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"yup. that's why I think that most of the best rhcp songs are the ones that aren't well known. But if you look past the popularity of the songs and the overplayedness and just see them as any of their other songs, they have really good qualities. the californication riff has some of the best chemistry between flea and frusciante. the bass and guitar just complement each other, one wouldn't be if it weren't for the other. the song also shows a more serious side of Kiedis that hadn't been seen that often before. Under the bridge has one of the most beautiful hendrix-inspired frusciante guitar lines in all of rhcp in my opinion. I mean just listen to the part where kiedis begins with ""I drive on her streets..."", it's fucking beautiful. When I first got into rhcp, that was one of the songs that began showing me what frusciante was truly all about, before I really knew who he was. Kiedis also takes a very reflective approach to his lyrics which he begins to do more from that point on in his career. I think if those songs weren't singles they would be one of those hidden treasures that only ""true fans"" cherish and appreciate, like quixoticelixer."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj110,mclollolwub,3,Fri Jul 17 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"Its easy to forget that the peppers are one of the best selling bands of all time. I can do without a lot of their hits and sometimes will skip them, especially 90's era, but without radio exposure I doubt a lot of us would have discovered the peppers. Plus as a fan once you find those magic deep tracks it feels like you experience something special that casuals won't ever know!"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dj110,seqwood,8,Thu Jul 16 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"No way.  In fact I feel quite the opposite.  Some of the radio singles are some of my favorite RHCP songs.  Partly because of nostalgia, hearing them on the radio when I was growing up, it just takes me back to better times."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3dfz8f,Makarios95,11,Thu Jul 16 00:17:28 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that this could be interpreted as ""I'm not making music with the public's opinion in mind anymore, but I still might release some of it."""
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dfz8f,FlyingPandaRape,12,Thu Jul 16 04:39:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think John will stop making music for a long time. He said a while back that he ""didn't have an audience"" meaning he wasn't making music for people to hear. However, he's still making music and he'll probably release again in the future."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3dfz8f,Vernon106,9,Thu Jul 16 00:19:22 2015 UTC,"Doubtful. I'm pretty sure John makes music in the same way that writers constantly jot ideas in journals, or artists doodle in sketch books, or chefs fiddle with new flavors. It's just in the fiber of his being. As a musician, sometimes you just have to play for no reason other than the fact that it's therapeutic. It doesn't all have to be for the consumption of others. He knows he has a dedicated fan base and I'm sure he'll release material again when he finds another new niche in the music world to conquer. He has every right to take a little hiatus, and this should come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about John. We just have to be patient and let the man do his thing."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3dfz8f,porpoiseslayer,4,Sun Jul 19 05:25:41 2015 UTC,"People say he changes his mind a lot, which is true, he went from 'fans are half the music' to 'I don't care about releasing music to them'. So I presume he wants some time to learn, and master all this new technology, and then slowly come back into the music scene, Omar said that 'he is in a bit of a weird spot right now' and we need to wait to see what happens"

The head mod (is that an actual term??) sidewinder hasn't been very active on it, and the website requires a certain amount of money to stay online. My guess is he decided to stop paying and now the website is offline. Truth be told, that site died between six months and a year ago. A lot of dedicated users stopped posting. I lasted a little longer, but I, too, stopped posting. The site had gone downhill with constant bickering about Josh and John. Then spammers kind of took over in a wild west of unmoderated spamming. It's unfortunate because that site was great at its peak, but it's well past that by now."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3dfsfr,smithzacharys,6,Wed Jul 15 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"I believe I remember reading that Josh is influenced by country, and that he enjoys the music of Mumford and Sons, which is kind of how I think this song came to be. I like the song, though it isn't one of my favorites. I go back and listen to it every once in a while, it's a good change of pace. I do agree with, that chorus is kick-ass, especially the second chorus when Josh brings in that funk guitar riff. The one thing I really wish was emphasized more on the track is the piano, and I would have loved it if Flea played a piano solo. Overall, good song, and an oddity when compared with the band's discography."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0gzp,drpooplol,2,Sun Jul 12 15:50:57 2015 UTC,"I love the disco-funk feel of this song. The bassline is absolutely stellar, the most powerful on the album in my opinion. I love the stomping feel of the drums, it gives the song a rock and roll edge. The chicken scratch guitar is subtle and perfect, not to mention during the second verse when Josh plays that atmospheric solo I get chills every time. In fact, this song had probably my favorite guitar work on the entire album, mostly due to Josh's funky ass riffs during the outdo jam. Anthony's lyrics are goofy yet introspective, and his vocal delivery gives a nod to his style from their earlier albums. This song to me is a modern take on their Hillel-era style, and I hope they experiment more with this sound on the upcoming album."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0gzp,rhcp88,4,Sun Jul 12 19:58:08 2015 UTC,Probably my favorite as well. It also really feels like the first track to the second side of the album to me.

All about that freaking bass solo and that insane outro that Chad slays. Either that or Brendan's Death Song which might be one of the most powerful Chili songs ever.  Honorable mentions: Factory of Faith, Police Station, and surprisingly, Rain Dance Maggie, which is unstoppably catchy and that outro, along with Factory, really convinced me of Josh's chops."

The guitar lick, and the tone of it, is just so warm and inviting, while being infectious and driving at the same time. I love the trumpet solo, the funky percussion on it, and Josh's backing vocals.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,Slothulhu_,10,Sun Jul 12 14:35:03 2015 UTC,"Nothing other than what we have. Probably won't come out till after the band has been gone. Even then, there's a chance that John (who is why the album never came out) will block the release of it, seeing as he never really liked his work during that time."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,J0K3R2,12,Sun Jul 12 15:24:21 2015 UTC,Kind of getting sick of John's crap
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,Rasengan2012,10,Sun Jul 12 23:01:33 2015 UTC,Glad someone's not afraid to say it
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,outroversion,0,Mon Jul 13 00:47:18 2015 UTC,What did John do?? It's not like what the dude above said he might do actually happened.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,mclollolwub,3,Tue Jul 14 22:11:25 2015 UTC,"Lots. Didn't invite the band to his wedding, didn't go to the rock n roll hall of fame induction ceremony, he only refers to RHCP as good ""performers"" or ""entertainers"" and will only acknowledge them by calling them ""my past band"". On top of that, he's decided to not release any more music for the public but only for himself- which would be okay if it weren't for the fact that we as fans are the ones who gave him the financial stability to do so."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,Rasengan2012,4,Wed Jul 15 06:47:45 2015 UTC,Theoretically they could scrap John's parts or rerecording them with Josh and there's nothing John could do to stop the release of that. As long as he's given writing credit. Unless there's some clause in his contract that says if RHCP material gives him writers credit they can't release it without his consent or something.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,Taydolf_Switler22,2,Mon Jul 13 05:45:05 2015 UTC,Hopefully all those unknown tracks will be released when the band breaks because as much i also want to hear to unreleased album I'm dying to hear Circle of a Noose :D
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,Jdcarty,2,Sun Jul 12 17:42:06 2015 UTC,I just hope there exists a higher quality recording of Bunker Hill.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3d0leq,yodawg111,2,Sun Jul 12 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Do they need John's consent to release it? I remember it was him who originally wanted to scrap it because he didn't like his guitar playing on the album. I doubt he would want it released, especially considering how he isn't releasing solo albums for the foreseeable future"

RedHotChiliPeppers,3czy99,Michaelthebromo,2,Sun Jul 12 08:45:15 2015 UTC,Thank you
RedHotChiliPeppers,3czy99,notwhomyallthink,2,Sun Jul 12 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for these rare gems.  I just watched the first and it seemed like initially River was a bit lost and I thought he was a bit intimidated by Flea or something but then he really found his own and I think they created something beautiful.  There must have been so many sweet sublime jams that have happened and weren't recorded.  It's nice to hear this one.  I read a quote by Flea in which he said that playing music is just the the thing he's done which makes most sense.  Like out of all the stuff he's done in his life, making music just seemed so right.  I mean, this jam was never to make a famous song or anything but it's beautiful, and they're doing something that makes sense.  Edit:  so I'm up to jam 3 and it just gets better!  I am so impressed by River I'm going to check out some of his movies.  Edit 2:  so this auto plays into river interviewing guys who've prostituted themselves like as investigation for a role or something.  It's full on with guys talking about whoring themselves out as underage teens.  Damn hard stories, I'm still watching though."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3czwg1,mjj1492,2,Sun Jul 12 08:14:10 2015 UTC,Hope this is his new look for the new album. He looks good.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3ct7q0,mclollolwub,2,Sun Jul 12 19:23:40 2015 UTC,Saw them one time at a club in Minneapolis. Their stage monitors hadn't arrived by the start time of 9:30. They ended up finally starting at 11:00. They still went on to play their 4hr 20min show. By the 3:00 am there were only like 50-100 people left. It was awesome. Felt like a personal Clinton show.     True funk from the masters. That's awesome that he can still go at this late of an age. Glad you got to see him before it's too laye
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ct7q0,seathian,2,Fri Jul 10 23:22:58 2015 UTC,They were late as hell for my show too! 4 fucking opening acts! But they did do a whole 4 hours show till like 2:30 am

RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,notwhomyallthink,3,Sat Jul 11 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"Probably says more about me, but back in the day I was like the only one in my group really into them.  I mean, everyone knew Under the Bridge and Give it Away but I had all the 80s stuff and even knew the B-sides.  Next thing I'm finally old enough to go out to clubs and all these ditzy chiks are singing Otherside.  Damn, like that was my thing.  Do you know Soul to Squeeze or Knock me dowm... fuck...  This was my thing.  It was late 90s and I was ticked off because everyone was now on the bandwagon but I got over it.  Still.. every time I hear Otherside I get this grating feeling."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,mclollolwub,2,Sat Jul 11 22:28:30 2015 UTC,Soul To Squeeze is a pretty mainstream song by them.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,JSono69,13,Sun Jul 12 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Early chili peppers (RHCP,FS,UMPP and MM) are just as good, if not better than, all their albums since then. The raw energy, punk funk from those albums is really an awesome vibe, and more to my taste. I'm disappointed they will more than likely never go back to being the band they were back then, as it seems they have slowly been mellowing out over time (although they still kick-ass, just with less raw energy imo.)  Although keen as a bean to see what the new album brings, especially for Josh. Will be interesting to see what new vibes they can bring to the table."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,rolldownthewindow,7,Fri Jul 10 13:30:57 2015 UTC,"I was going to say the opposite actually. I thought amongst fans the popular opinion is that their early stuff is overlooked and underrated. I disagree, I think it's rated just about right. It's OK, but not I'm not that into it. I do like the energy on those albums (except the first album where the energy was sucked out of it by production - listen to the demos if you have the special edition). But I think they really hit their stride on BSSM. They made much more quality music from BSSM-SA than they did in the 80s."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,JSono69,3,Fri Jul 10 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"personally I think you are in the majority, which is cool. Just seems to me like the early albums really don't get much love compared to the later ones, bar maybe a few of their early singles, especially on this sub."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,DayOff4Superman,4,Fri Jul 10 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"I think the albums are still interesting to hear just to see how they've grown up as a band. I love Coyotes, Knock Me Down, Higher Ground, and a few others, but personally I can't listen to the whole albums from beginning to end like I can with BSSM and beyond.   As I've said before, it's like comparing Fight for Your Right to Party Beastie Boys to Sabotage or Intergalactic Beastie Boys. They've just changed so much."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,JSono69,2,Fri Jul 10 14:11:16 2015 UTC,"yeah it's awesome their evolution as a band, especially considering in my opinion every one of their albums is great to listen to as a whole, but some of them are definitely not for everyone."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,ChunLiSBK,4,Fri Jul 10 14:20:45 2015 UTC,I thought my opinion that newer (BSSM to Stadium) Chilis is better than the old stuff was the unpopular opinion in fan circles.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,JSono69,2,Fri Jul 10 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"I was unaware of that, I was going mostly by this subreddit which the majority froff over pretty much everything post-BSSM minus OHM. (all chili's albums are awesome so please don't hate me guys, but it's true.)"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3cslob,mclollolwub,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:55:39 2015 UTC,No that's a pretty popular opinion. Most people aren't even aware of their 80's material's existence

It also has a cool behind the scenes featurette with Chad playing dominos with old black dudes and a teenage cheerleader trying to flirt when she's standing next to a buzzcut Frusciante. They look like they're having such a blast doing that video."

For a band which such talented musicians surely you could bust out a cracking surprise now and then. Backwoods, stone cold bush, aeroplane......plenty of songs pre 1999 for them to choose from and it's usually just give it away, under the bridge and every now and then power of equality and sir psycho sexy (LOVE those two songs), and maybe Higher Ground, Me & My Frienss plus a couple of others. Even the brilliant Blackeyed Blonde has disappeared. It can't be hard to please old school fans!"

Warm Tape is actually a pretty damn good song.    The B-Sides are good, but nowhere near as much as this sub hypes them up to be.  Outside of Quixoticelixer, they're perfect fits as B-Sides.    If You Have to Ask is one of their best songs of all time."

Stadium Arcadium should've been 15 songs or less with the rest on an I'm Beside You type compilation.   Freaky Styley is the best RHCP album of the 80s. Uplift Mofo is the worst.   I'm With You is pretty damn good and Josh is a great guitarist.   John's solo material is mostly mediocre.   BSSM is incredible but could've been just as good at 15 songs.

It's the same hits over and over. They ought to mix it up a bit like Phish, The Dead and Pearl Jam."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3crdo5,3006MA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"wow they still play mainly the more popular songs from bssm, they were probably a lot more fond of their older material with hillel i guess"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3crdo5,mclollolwub,5,Thu Jul 16 01:53:48 2015 UTC,"Probably the same reason you don't see songs like someone, the bicycle song and various other B-Sides on the set. Especially with a band like chilis they have so much material that they have to chose a 20 song set from people would complain if it was B-Sides. Also they're B-Sides because they didn't think they'd be good enough/fit on the album so maybe that transfers to shows as well. Shame though"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3crdo5,GarthFitzgeraldIV,5,Fri Jul 10 08:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think not playing any of the IBY stuff is different than not playing songs like Bicycle Song or Someone bc when those songs were released, the band had already written/recorded multiple albums with John so at least they were playing a lot of songs that he'd helped write. Josh has been in the band since 2009, but their average set list still only includes at most 3 songs that he actually helped write, and 1 of those 3 is always Rain Dance Maggie. Knowing that they've released at least 31 songs since Josh joined the band 6 years ago, that's got to be frustrating, and like I said above, his ""teases"" of IBY songs would seem to confirm he is anxious to play them.  Also, although the collection is called I'm ""B-side"" You, those 17 songs really aren't true b-sides considering the way the were released. If they didn't think any of those songs were good enough to play live even once, then why even release them at all? They play a lot of random cover songs at shows and no one complains that those spots on the set list aren't filled with more radio singles. If you're a casual fan of the band and are only familiar with radio singles, then you really can't expect to know every single song on the set list at a show. If Anthony were to announce, ""hey everybody, we're gonna play a new one from the collection of 7-inch singles we just released,"" I can't imagine the audience would complain."

Don't get me wrong, BSSM is definitely THE Chili Pepper album, and Stadium Arcadium had the diversity, but this is definitely my favorite.  It shows so much more of the bands soft side; it feels comforting, where BSSM feels like the make you jump around kind of funky album, and Stadium Arcadium is almost like the RHCP sampler that pushes the Frusciante magic. The later two have their own perfect times and places, but I can pop By the Way in the radio whenever I feel like it, and love it every single time.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3ciuh2,World71Racer,6,Wed Jul 8 06:34:57 2015 UTC,PJ vs RHCP? But..but.. They're both so on another level of fuckery and Vedder and Anthony are on the same level of sexiness. Obviously RHCP could be ranked the more technical and accomplished band but we can't deny that pj were more killing the nineties scene more than we did. Plus these pj vs rhcp and pj vs Nirvana are just childish games and we should love both!

RedHotChiliPeppers,3ciuh2,YoghurtEater,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:14:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd say the RHCP are obviously a more technical and accomplished band than PJ. Arguably yes, and I'm personally a much bigger fan of RHCP's music, but PJ definitely brings the heat for live performances and both guitarists in that band are incredible.   Also, as someone mentioned below, PJ mixes up a their set lists a lot more than the Chili Peppers, which is probably my biggest issue with RHCP as a live act. I don't know how much longer I'll be willing to shell out $70+ to watch them play the same 14-16 songs I've seen before, plus a few cool jams and maybe 1-2 ""rare"" songs that I haven't heard live yet. They really need to start expanding their repertoire and catering to more than just the casual fan who only knows the radio singles. I have more than 200 different songs by the Chili Peppers in my collection and it's a bummer knowing there's basically no chance of seeing the majority of them live even though the band is still together and touring. I'm not saying they need to do a 180 and only play rare album tracks from now on, just to start expanding beyond the greatest hits set lists at every show."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ciuh2,DamnHellAssKings,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"That list of bands is so stupid IMO. This should have been the finale (RHCP vs PJ). The others don't live up.  Anyway, I think I have to go with PJ on this one, because even thought both bands have been around for over 25 years, PJ still give 3 hour shows, with a variety of songs including b-sides and rarities and they change the setlist from night to night.  RHCP, while they do give the insane energies and vibes they always do, give the standard 1.5 hour hit-filled routine setlist. It's fun and incredible every time over, and their jams are incredible, but PJ consistently change things up and keep it fresh."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,BrendanH117,49,Sun Jul 5 07:55:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a drummer, and I pretty much based my style off of Chads early on in my drum instruction.  I don't know if he's one of the best technical players out there, but as far as the feel of a song goes, he's fantastic.  My drum teacher always would say to play for the song, and I think Chad is one of those kind of guys.  He doesn't over-do it, he gets creative when he needs to, and rides the groove in all the right places.  He's not like a Thomas Pridgen gospel chops type, where sort of going over-the-top seems to be the point (which is not to say I don't have respect for those guys, they're phenomenal), but Chad is more a team player, and does what a team-playing drummer should do: hold the beat down and let the band shine.  And when it's his turn to shine, he fucking shines.  Also, he eats drums for breakfast."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,MrMexicanJumpingBean,3,Sun Jul 5 08:47:46 2015 UTC,"I want to add-on to this ""team player"" thing which is spot on  He talks about it on his teaching video on youtube - he listens to what flea or the guitarist is doing and accents what they are playing. This really helps them flow so much better together, and not just with a kick-drum crash combo like most drummers would (especially beginners)   He also tends to start off simple and build on the complexity of his fills and frills as the song calls for it - he's very aware of dynamics and tones it down for the slower parts but goes bananas at the fast part of a solo (dani california is a good example)"

When I started learning drums the teacher had a choice of songs, and Can't Stop was one of them. I thought that sounds pretty good, let's have a go at that. Fast forward 15 years and I'm hooked on the Chili Peppers and have always styled my drumming after Chad.   My drum teacher once said to me, ""You've got to feel the music, become part of it!"". When I'm playing in my band I still use this mantra, drumming whatever 'feels' right and fits the other guys. Each time is a different beat!"

RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,finnmcd,3,Sun Jul 5 12:16:35 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""ghost"" and what is a snare roll?"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,elmerion,2,Sun Jul 5 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"'ghosting' is where you hit the snare softer than on the main beats, which Chad tends to do on the off beats, it's a lot quieter than when he hits it on say the 2nd and 4th beat (listen to californiacation, you can hear it used there). Snare roll is like at the beginning of dani California, like a drum roll, where he hits it several times fast, creating that drum roll sound, which he uses often."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,mclollolwub,2,Mon Jul 6 22:46:26 2015 UTC,"I never really heard of grace notes in drumming. But in guitar, a grace note is where you play a note and move on to the next one straight after, so you play it really fast, like in the I could have lied solo, right at the beginning , it has a few. I've read a few drum books and when they get onto to Chad they explain ghosting how I did."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,finnmcd,6,Tue Jul 7 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"If we're looking at his technical skills I'd say Chad Smith is a good drummer but not a great one. He's a good drummer and he certainly knows how to play his instrument well, but he's not a virtuoso like Flea and John. But if we look at what sort of drummer he is for the RHCP, he's a great drummer. He fits with their style perfectly, locks in the bottom end with Flea flawlessly, and knows exactly how much is the right amount of space for the drums to occupy in any given situation in a song. There's hundreds of drummers that you could rattle off names of who are better technical drummers than Chad Smith, but none of them would be a better drummer for the RHCP than Chad is. Technical skills are just one facet of being a great musician."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,BillW87,2,Sun Jul 5 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a drummer. I don't consider him near the best drummers of all time technically, but his attitude, feel and funk are unparalleled."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6gyo,Faemn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"Im not a drummer, but he seems to be incredibly versatile in his technique. He can go from funk beats, to metal, to hip hop, to pop rock, and incorporate each of them in the other.   If you can, watch the Fallon performance where they covered funkadelic. He gets a little solo in that he almost looks like he's about to start crying. That's fuckin passion.   And he seems like he's always trying to improve himself. He said when he joined the chili peppers, he couldn't do a reggae beat at all. He knew that their sound might incorporate that laid back groove in the future, and he made it a point to learn.    One of the things that I tell people I love about RHCP is that you can hear a song, and it becomes really fun to break down what each musician is doing. Really pay attention to what Chad does on a song like Monarchy of Roses. Every verse he adds a little something to it, till the end where the drums just sound like a war going on. It's very different than say, phill rudd did on AC/DC  (my second favorite band)."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3c6s0r,BKranny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:08:14 2015 UTC,This doesn't answer if he wrote the bass progression for Don't Forget Me but your comment about how you thought John was playing it on guitar reminded me of  this interview. He goes into a little bit of depth on how the simple solo melody works with the chord progression and plays them at the same time on his guitar.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3bxjyk,Chocolatedippedbacon,2,Fri Jul 3 00:54:22 2015 UTC,"You could write any song with the G, C, D. chord progression and say it sounds like Cabron."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,brockthesock,42,Thu Jul 2 10:46:34 2015 UTC,"I can't believe so many dislike porcelain, I feel like if it'd been on a slower album such as by the way it wouldn't get nearly as much hate."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,ILIKEGAMESOK,8,Thu Jul 2 12:11:16 2015 UTC,It appears as if slow songs are frowned upon among a majority of the fans which I think is surprising.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,Collotto,6,Thu Jul 2 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"Wet Sand and Under The Bridge seem to be two of the most loved songs by fans, so I'm not quite sure.  Having said that, Porcelain and If are even slower than those two, so maybe it's the really slow ones that people dislike."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,ILIKEGAMESOK,3,Thu Jul 2 17:37:26 2015 UTC,"I think you nail it on the head. Put Porcelain on BTW maybe (spitballing here) and it instantly becomes far better of a song. It got thrown in there on Californication amidst its distorted, loud awesomeness. Part of it is also the high quality of the b-sides that got left OFF the album-Gong Li, Bunker Hill, Quixoticelixer, the like. Porcelain was a good song at the wrong time."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,J0K3R2,2,Fri Jul 3 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"Nah.  I don't listen to albums in their entirety or anything, and I really don't like Porcelain."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,invisiblemovement,2,Thu Jul 2 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"I love Warm Tape, was really surprised to see it on here."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,JSono69,9,Thu Jul 2 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"I think it is a truly amazing feat for a band having released such a large amount of songs, that even in the top 10 most disliked songs from a community such as us, that there are still many quality songs in the most disliked list, some that would be in some people's top 10. Just goes to show the amazing quality and longevity of the band over the years really."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,World71Racer,2,Thu Jul 2 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. Porcelain was the first song I learned on guitar, so I rather like it."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3buyk7,idea-man,7,Thu Jul 2 13:31:03 2015 UTC,"Cabron with 15 votes? Warm Tape with 19 votes? If with 29?  I mean, I understand that Cabron basically just repeats ""asshole"" in Spanish a lot, and that Warm Tape is a bit quirky for the Chilis, and If is a short song that doesn't quite go many places, but there are positives to all of those songs. Cabron has a nice summer vibe to it, Warm Tape is unique for its quirkiness, and If is a sweet little song with some beautiful lyrics (similar to how Porcelain is, but cleaner in production). I don't get the hate for those three, and how If beat out You Always Sing the Same, which is barely even a song, to me."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3bor1j,Im_probablystoned,8,Wed Jul 1 11:06:59 2015 UTC,Flea and Anthony seemed to be around Hillel more around the time of his death. A time when they were all seriously into heroin and (somewhat into cocaine) were often disappearing without a trace for days at a time.   They were all lost at that time and some of them learned more quickly that the drugs were controlling their lives. They new that it had killed their friends and that it would continue.   Jack was smart to get out when he did.  He could have been the next one to go. The band hadn't attained it's legacy yet and his life was more important to him.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3bor1j,grifmasta,3,Wed Jul 1 03:10:16 2015 UTC,Probably that Jack had a strong relationship with Hillel more than Anthony.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3bor1j,BullNiro,3,Wed Jul 1 12:06:31 2015 UTC,"People really overstate his actual role in the band  ""founding member"" sounds like a big deal but in the context of the peppers it really wasn't. He played a few shows with them but his main band always was anthem (what is this). Once flea and Anthony got serious and were signed they had to find a drummer and guitarist. Hell he only really played in one record. Irons was prt of the early history of the band but not an important part. He'll be remembered for his contributions to pearl jam."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3bor1j,helptheunderdog,0,Wed Jul 1 18:02:20 2015 UTC,Maybe. Maybe not. I think he got into scoring films which isn't a bad paying job I'd say.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3bor1j,Hnuggets,4,Wed Jul 1 11:29:50 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? Jack Irons is an incredible drummer! He has definatly earned his place amongst the top rock drummers of our time.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3bor1j,Hnuggets,4,Wed Jul 1 12:48:58 2015 UTC,"I just listed some of the great musicians Jack Irons has played with and your response sounds like you're defending him as if I insulted the man.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3b6s6v,kilbaCZE,9,Fri Jun 26 12:52:32 2015 UTC,"I don't really see it happening for awhile at least. It would only pull from SA, I'm With You and the upcoming album, and if we're being honest I don't think they've accumulated enough ""hits"" in that time to warrant a new greatest hits album. They released a bunch of singles, but other than Dani California, Snow, and maybe Tell Me Baby or Rain Dance Maggie, I don't think any of them were really successful enough to be considered ""hit"" singles, at least not on the level of Give It Away, Under the Bridge, Scar Tissue, Californication, By the Way, etc. Just putting all of the singles from the last few albums together on one disk would feel more like a ""best of"" than a ""greatest hits"" and I think a ""best of"" compilation of the most recent 3 albums with a couple of new tracks thrown in would be frivolous.  If for some reason they did do a new greatest hits album, I would actually hope that it didn't contain any unreleased material so people who already have the studio albums wouldn't have to re-purchase an album's worth of songs just for 2 new ones. Even if they remastered the songs I don't think it'd be worth it bc I doubt they'd sound that much better/different considering how recently they were all recorded and released. I'd much rather get a box set of all the non-album b-sides remastered in chronogical order."

Although I think the whole band enjoys playing enough to put out the same energy. Flea is constantly doing something funny looking or hand standing and Chad never stops with the flow. Although Josh might be a little more laid back I think he balances everything out. But as a whole they all work so well  together on stage it's just a pleasure to experience."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ayux9,sandman98857,20,Wed Jun 24 16:51:53 2015 UTC,i feel like josh just sits back for the most part until a solo comes along and he just goes batshit crazy haha

RedHotChiliPeppers,3ayux9,YoghurtEater,4,Thu Jun 25 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love his energy, and without it live performances would indeed be more dull."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ayux9,cagethepepper,8,Wed Jun 24 20:42:48 2015 UTC,"Been a fan for over a decade now, and I'm not huge on his stage presence. He's not the greatest singer, which is fine, as his ability fits the band and their music wouldn't be their music without him, obviously.  But, what bothers me isn't his jumping around, that's fine (I personally can't stand Oasis cuz whatshisname just stands there singing), but I wish he'd interact more with the crowd. Dave Ghrol for example, can't jump around because he's got to play his guitar, but he exudes this energy of wanting the crowd to be involved and everyone to have a good time. AK is just too serious sometimes.  AK doesn't do that, and I think it's a shame, cuz I think it would otherwise take their live performances one step higher and make them better.  And I know I'm not the only one who thinks this, cuz I've heard big music fans saying the same about him without starting the discussion myself, so I reckon quite a few people who are ""so-so"" on the chili peppers don't end up as drawn to the band as they could be."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ayux9,kestrel_rises,3,Wed Jun 24 22:31:57 2015 UTC,"I can't even begin to tell you how much I love his on stage movement. It's so energetic and you can tell the music, the funk is really flowing through his being. It fills me with such a great joy, I can't help but mirror him whenever I'm getting down to an RHCP song."

Like they weren't afraid of what they were putting out, the were confident in themselves and in their music, and so they could express themselves to the fullest."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3asg78,Walrus13,2,Tue Jun 23 09:13:26 2015 UTC,Very underrated album.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ar4b1,Jdcarty,12,Mon Jun 22 20:52:56 2015 UTC,I don't recommend watching the whole thing because it's the end of a very long tour and their performance may just seem quite the same as every other. But it isn't. John knew it's his last performance so you can definitely feel his extra push and extra burst of energy throughout the show such as the solo on Otherside and She's Only 18. Even his little speech in the beginning is very touching to me because in a way his saying thank you to everyone who got them to where they were at that point. Hope you guys felt as sad and happy as I did watching it!
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ar4b1,knibby1,4,Mon Jun 22 21:00:44 2015 UTC,I was there and I felt sad  Edit: I didn't know it was going to be his last performance but it was as emotional as always. I saw them at the start of this tour and then this show at the end and they were obviously winding down.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ar4b1,LiteNorsk,2,Tue Jun 23 10:42:44 2015 UTC,"Same here. Ricoh in 2006 and Leeds in 2007. I remember Anthony looked tired and Flea spoke about the moon. John was unchanged and Chad was in red, not in blue as we'd first seen him. Josh was off to the right and jamming on the keyboard, we had no idea that he'd be stepping in but I'm glad there was a changeover period.   I'd lost my friends, as festivals tend to separate you, so I just watched closely and I just wanted them to stop. You could see the exhaustion in them."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ar4b1,knibby1,2,Tue Jun 23 19:08:30 2015 UTC,Yeah the exhaustion was obvious. I saw two shows over a year apart on the same tour. First one in Manchester was amazing full of energy and new music. This Leeds show was emotional and withdrawn but still amazing. I took my younger brother to watch them for the first time and was really selling to him how awesome the live shows were but then they played like they were so tired. I really really miss John being part of the band.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ar4b1,mclollolwub,3,Tue Jun 23 22:28:36 2015 UTC,You can tell something's different about John's energy in this when he decides to once again use his Gretsch to play Otherside after having long decided to stop using it
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ar4b1,amrhik10,2,Tue Jun 23 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are right because he stopped using the White Falcon at this point."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3ale3d,noticeperiod,7,Sun Jun 21 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"I was never a fan of Look Around, it just feels too generic, nothing about that song stands out to me as unique. The verse is very typical sparse Chili Pepper funk and Anthony's lyrics don't seem to be about anything in particular (I don't always mind this, but in this song the lyrics come off as uninspired to me). The chorus is just lazy writing all around imo and during the bridge, Anthony is basically just singing the bridge from By the Way. I feel like this song was obviously written to be a single, trying to be very by-the-numbers and easy to sing along to, but it just ended up being kind of boring. Purely my opinion obviously."

It might not be my absolute favorite cover they've done, although it is up there, but it's definitely the most interesting to me bc of how far it strays from the original."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3aj5it,Yakobi0919,16,Sat Jun 20 21:00:51 2015 UTC,"As a fellow guitarist, I sympathize with your problem. I've always been a huge Chili Peppers fan, and never got to play with another guitarist who is so into them like I am. Which is a shame because they have a HUGE amount of songs that are a perfect fit for 2 guitars. this list only consists of songs from studio albums, but plenty of B-Sides will accommodate 2 guitars as well.  Note that the first 2 albums from the chilis are absent. The songs on those albums were mainly rough, punky little ditties with 1 line of guitar, no layering or almost none in most cases; I just feel like 2 guitars wouldn't mash too well with them, so i just skipped them.  Uplift Mofo Party Plan  -Party On Your Pussy  Mothers Milk  (this album stands out as one of the most friendly towards bands with 2 guitars, because the producer made it a point of all the tracks having layers upon layers of guitar, distortion and the like, which frustrated Frusciante a lot, he later would resent his playing on this record. Almost all songs from this album will fit your criteria.)  -Higher Ground, Sexy Mexican Maid, Knock Me Down, Stone Cold Bush, Nobody Weird Like Me, Good Time Boys, Subway To Venus, Taste The Pain  One Hot Minute  (This album is also easily adaptable for 2 guitar players, because it leans towards a heavier sound like in Mother's Milk. Dave Navarro's made sure to include lots of interesting layers of guitar on each track, part of his style of playing. almost all the songs will fit for 2 guitarists easily.)  -My Friends, Shallow Be Thy Game, Tearjerker, Coffee Shop, Aeroplane, Walkabout  Californication  -This Velvet Glove, Scar Tissue (One playing the verses/rythm, second guitar doing the solo)  By The Way  -Cabron, Venice Queen  Stadium Arcadium  (pretty much any song from this album will do, here are some I thought 2 guitars will fit best)  -Dani California, Stadium Arcadium, Torture Me, Especially in Michigan, Warlocks, C'mon Girl, Wet Sand, Desecration Smile, 21st Century, Readymade, She Looks To Me, Storm In a Teacup, Turn it Again, Death of a Martian  I'm With You  -Did I Let You Know, Ethiopia, Factory of Faith, Goodbye Hooray, Look Around  well, that about does it for me, I hope this helps out some. Rock on dude!"

RedHotChiliPeppers,3ah9yz,Jeremyr47,12,Sat Jun 20 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"Listening to the whole of By The Way and Stadium Arcadium is a good place to start. From BTW check out Dosed, Don't Forget Me(one of there best live songs) and Vencie Queen for starters. I can't even begin to describe Stadium Arcadium because it is so large and vast so I suggest you just play the whole album over the course of a week and see how you feel. Personal favorites are Slow Cheetah, Wetsand, Tell Me Baby And Readymade. Californication is also a masterpiece worth checking out (around the world, Get on Top, I like Dirt and Porcelain). Check out IWY as well while you're there (even you Brutus,Annie Wants A Baby, Adventures of Raindance Maggie and Monarchy of Roses)  Once Comfortable with their top three move on to BSSM. There's no one to song to reccomend but just take the time to trip out to this masterpiece late at night. Personal favourites (Breaking The Girl, If you have to ask, Funky Monks)   Only after spending a fair amount of time listening to each album carefully do I reccomend checking out One Hot Minute. Many describe it as their messy and lowest album because of the state of the band and lack of John Frusciante. But I love that album so much because there's so much emotion to feel. Personal favourites (Falling into Grace, Walkabout, shallow be thy game and aeroplane)  Now on to Mothers Milky. This is also a great album full of funk and kickass riffs but again isn't their best composition of work because the band was still getting a feel of each other at this point. Favourites- Good Time Boys, Knock me Down and Higher Ground"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ah9yz,Jdcarty,6,Sat Jun 20 05:18:49 2015 UTC,Don't forget to listen to Subway to Venus on Mothers Milk!
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ah9yz,Rawdreago,5,Sat Jun 20 05:40:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty Little Ditty, Sexy Mexican Maid and Johnny Kick a Hole in the Sky are awesome as well! (The whole album kicks ass though)"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ah9yz,JSono69,7,Sat Jun 20 08:28:09 2015 UTC,"Only going to mention stuff I don't see here  Warped:  Prepare for a dreamy opening, then submerge yourself in frenzy and then finally peace out in a psychedelic stupor. One of their darker, harder songs.  Purple Stain: This song has got a killer guitar and bass hook,  it's basically the If You Have To Ask of Californication. Don't be afraid to bob your head.  Make You Feel Better: A light, fast paced song that does what it says on the box. Prepare for the lyrics to be catchy and actually make enough sense that you won't be embarrassed to sing it out loud in public."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3ah9yz,Hally_,2,Sat Jun 20 08:38:53 2015 UTC,"No, I slowly began losing interest after Californication came out. I enjoyed By The Way though, but after that I have barely listened to those albums, as much as I'd like to enjoy them I just can't in the same way as pre-1999. They just seem to lack the same depth that everything before it had, and I don't want to sound like I'm condoning drug use but I think their music was better when they were all high."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3ah9yz,pigandpepper,2,Sat Jun 20 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I really enjoy all of their post BSSM stuff, even the less popular or critically praised. Their funkier stuff just makes me feel some typ'a way."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3aebtg,1TNM1,9,Fri Jun 19 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"Alright. I'll out myself for lack of musical knowledge. What exactly is he opening here?  These are the same notes, but the key is shifted - wouldn't that make them different notes? Or is it a relativity thing - as long as it's the same positions relative, the same thing can be played a number of different ways?"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3aebtg,Max_Powers08,12,Fri Jun 19 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"Majoring in Music Composition:  Essentially most of the notes are the same but certain tones and scale degrees are what define something being major or minor. For example a C minor chord is comprised of a C, E flat, and a G. To change this chord to a major chord you only change the 2nd note (which is the third scale degree of the chord but that's not important) to make it C, E natural, G. So basically they go in and change the minor thirds into major thirds (there's more in depth definitely but this gives you a general idea).  Tldr: Most of the notes are the same but changing certain ones changes the tonality."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3aebtg,Tiger21SoN,4,Fri Jun 19 17:49:46 2015 UTC,I've always thought that when a key is changed the scale is changed. So this means the notes do change.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3aebtg,nufcneilo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:31:10 2015 UTC,The original is in a minor key (which tend to sound sadder) and they digitally reworked it into major key (which is half the reason it sounds wierd - it wasnt recorded in major key)

RedHotChiliPeppers,39oxer,Squirrelbacon,3,Sat Jun 13 14:06:28 2015 UTC,Maybe because it differs from the overall sound? Most of them are pretty emotionally charged while Hump de Bump is a big party jam

Not that I don't like it, but if there is one thing I don't like about Stadium Arcadium it is that alot of the songs have a heavy, four chord chorus (Storm In A Teacup, Dani California, She's Only 18).

It's all opinion of course but 21st Century is one of the worst songs they've ever released. I always felt like they only put it on the album because they had played it live earlier and thought fans wanted it but that theory goes out the window because Mini-Epic is one of their coolest songs I've heard and it wasn't on anything ever.
RedHotChiliPeppers,39oxer,WrongProgression,0,Mon Jun 15 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"Voted for Warlocks. That song seems so unbearably pop-y to me, and the vocal melody screams that so much.   She's Only 18 and C'mon Girl would be my next two.  (BTW, I'm quite surprised at so many people voting for Hump de Bump and We Believe. HDB harkens back to the days of some real raw funk, while WB seems a bit psychedelic & John's guitar tone on it is silky smooth.)"

It's not that I don't believe it, I would just like concrete proof because I have not found any myself.  Moreover, listening to OHM I have been noticing a trend. It seems that many of the songs end without a huge collaborative finish. Listen to the end of Deep Kick. Same with Walkabout, Aeroplane, Transcending, Tearjerker ect.  To me they seem to have a tentative ending where it either fades out or each instrument either lingers longer/shorter.  OHM is one of my favorite albums, it's just a motif I've noticed in recent years."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39nba2,BadcaseofDTB,2,Sat Jun 13 05:06:17 2015 UTC,"There's a full unmastered tape out there somewhere, without the fadeouts and cuts.

It's taking up all this space and making everything sound murky, you lose definition in the sound when it sustains your notes for so long, especially when a solo is meant to sound speedy.    Also before you improvise you're missing quite a few of the slides john does on the phrase when he goes down to the 1st and 3rd frets.    Chuck a wah-wah on in the final part too!"

RedHotChiliPeppers,39jik8,DayOff4Superman,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"Anthony's written some hilariously sexual lyrics over the years. Nice to see some get the spotlight.  Not sure I agree with the point about SA and IWY having no sexual lyrics. The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie can be interpreted as trying to make a girl squirt and Did I Let You Know is about getting with a prostitute. There are still sexual references, it's just that the references themselves are less overt."

RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,stormy83,7,Thu Jun 11 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"You have to pick a least favorite song. With that said, Porcelain is entirely unlike all of the other tracks, and, in my mind should have sat out for one of the stellar B-sides."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,dragery,5,Thu Jun 11 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"I love Porcelain, but I do think Quixotelixer should have been on the album, and I think that would be a good substitution."

RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,picasso_penis,8,Fri Jun 12 04:10:34 2015 UTC,"It was Right on Time for me.   I'm also asking that you judge according to the song itself, not how it fits in the album."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,Air_M_Jordan,7,Thu Jun 11 16:01:12 2015 UTC,johns vocals are the best thing about that song
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,MysticalTurban,3,Thu Jun 11 17:29:37 2015 UTC,yup same here. Except I love when they play London Calling right into Right on Time live

RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,AvereyK,4,Fri Jun 12 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"For me, it's Porcelain. The rest of the album has this drive, this ""Right here, right now"" feel. It's great rock and fast paced.. until you reach Porcelain. It just completely kills the mood. In my opinion, Porcelain would have fit better in By The Way."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,Baseball157,2,Thu Jun 11 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"Porcelain is my overall least favorite Chili Peppers song, so this one was easy."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,Marcopolio5,2,Thu Jun 11 21:21:38 2015 UTC,lololol as if it was a surprise that porcelain would top this
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,8point,2,Thu Jun 11 21:45:12 2015 UTC,So far two of the songs I really like from each album are the ones least liked :(
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,Oggie243,2,Thu Jun 11 22:24:01 2015 UTC,I hate that nobody seems to like Get On Top.  It's one of my all-time favorites.  I love how Anthony goes back and forth between rapping and singing.

RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,SaltyFoam,4,Thu Jun 11 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"As a non-Porcelain copout, Get on Top   It's a hell of a jam, but then you get Anthony into the mix, and it all gets fucked unfortunately."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,World71Racer,3,Thu Jun 11 23:42:01 2015 UTC,I think Anthony is the best part of Get On Top!
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,JV19,2,Fri Jun 12 18:40:22 2015 UTC,I selected Porcelain as well. It's not that it's a bad song. It's just that I feel like it ruins the flow of the album.
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,BoulderFreeZone,2,Thu Jun 11 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"TIL People actually like Porcelain as a song.  Personally I hate it, it's pretty much the only song I consider skipping when listening to RHCP."

RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,hoss1138,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"To me Californication is nothing special and I almost always hit skip. The lyrics are boring, predictable and repetitive, and the music is not exiting enough by itself. I get chills when John breaks into a solo in songs like Dani California, Slow Cheetah, Fight Like A Brave etc. Californication suffers from a lack of their usual flair and excitement."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,FunkyMonk707,2,Fri Jun 12 05:45:13 2015 UTC,"To me, californication isn't meant to be an exciting song. To summarise the feeling of the song would end up like this:  ""Take a fucken look at this mate""  If something says that to you in a stern manner, it's probably not gonna be exciting. But you will still get blown away by it. You feel me?"
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,JV19,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:42:31 2015 UTC,John isn't on Fight Like a Brave.  Unless you're talking about live performances.

RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,MusicNerds,-1,Sat Jun 13 06:47:30 2015 UTC,I honestly just don't like porcelain. I don't think it's a very good song. I think Anthony's singing is weak. I don't think it fits the album.
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,DayOff4Superman,0,Thu Jun 11 14:54:59 2015 UTC,I will either have to go for Porcelain or I Like Dirt. Every other song on the album I can sit down and listen to all the way through but I find it hard to sit through either of the two songs.
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,Puqo,-1,Thu Jun 11 16:09:57 2015 UTC,Either porcelain or Road Trippin.
RedHotChiliPeppers,39fcg4,WrongProgression,-2,Thu Jun 11 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"Porcelain, Get On Top, Emit Remmus? C'mon guys those are all fantastic songs. Personally, I chose Californication. It's too drawn out and just gets boring after 3 minutes."
RedHotChiliPeppers,39hdf8,CowardlyJohnny,5,Thu Jun 11 18:51:40 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they don't have any scheduled concerts. They are working on their new record now but they don't have plans on releases yet.

RedHotChiliPeppers,39d5fh,kilbaCZE,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:55:50 2015 UTC,I agree that it fits the OHM vibe more than any other album. But it sounds so Frusciante that it doesn't surprise me.

His live performance prime may have very well been around Slane and even his younger days. And hell, nothing compares to Slane as a complete package.

I thought a good way to judge that would be to poll people by the album and then put them all together in one big poll at the end.

Could somebody please compile a list of all the B-sides and whatnot that this band has made? would be much appreciated.  Anyway, hope you enjoy the polls."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,erfklein,9,Wed Jun 10 09:09:56 2015 UTC,"Here's my thing with They're Red Hot. I don't see it as an individual song. I have never once just listened to that one song. I see it as an ending to Sir Psycho Sexy. In that case, I actually like it."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,HunterHx,3,Tue Jun 9 11:59:47 2015 UTC,Exactly. Whenever people list either that or Pea as least favorite RHCP songs it's such a cop out.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,AvereyK,7,Tue Jun 9 15:35:49 2015 UTC,Pea is so awesome IMO.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,steven_mctowlie,5,Tue Jun 9 16:03:20 2015 UTC,Not surprised funky monks has no votes it's just like john said you can't not love that bass line.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,RHCPThom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:57:40 2015 UTC,Two people voted for it.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,pooponapoptart,13,Wed Jun 10 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like people only vote for the Greeting Song because Anthony wrote in Scar Tissue that he didn't like the song. It's bullshit not to like it for that reason, the guitar in it is great! Look up ""Sound of Music"" by Nick Weir on Youtube, the riff which he uses in that remix is amazing"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,RHCPThom,6,Tue Jun 9 11:24:55 2015 UTC,"For some reason, this is the only song when reading through the list I didn't immediately start hearing in my head. I guess that means I'm less keen on it than the others? I really like this entire album so I don't have a different one to vote for."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,mrknowitall95,3,Tue Jun 9 13:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can agree, its not one of my favourites  either, so I dont blame you for voting for it. Its probably in my top 3 least favourite songs of the album. Its just that every time The Greeting Song is mentioned people mention that AK dislikes it. And I saw it was almost in the number one spot for this poll so I had to do my little rant to defend it, haha"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,ahawk33,3,Tue Jun 9 13:48:33 2015 UTC,I've never even read Scar Tissue and voted for it. Something about the guitar-vocals combination annoys me a little. Especially the little pre-chorus sound of music part.  Why doesn't Anthony like it?
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,DamnHellAssKings,5,Tue Jun 9 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"From what I can remember he explained how he never really believed in the lyrics, as in they weren't 'him'. They were contrived in some form or another because he was chatting with Rick Rubin who told him he liked lyrics about fast cars and girls, etc etc, so he made a song about just that. I think it was Chevy/GM the car manufacturer who approached the chillis years later about using that song in one of their ads but Anthony turned it down, because of this very reason."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,ChasterMief711,2,Wed Jun 10 03:07:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, not to say I think that's one of the stronger tracks on the album, because it is almost definitely among the weaker ones, but I think a lot of people probably only voted for it because Anyhony said it was his least favorite, almost as if that makes it the ""correct"" answer to the poll. They're Red Hot getting so many votes makes sense bc it's a cover tune that's only about a minute long and played comically fast, but I really don't think The Greeting Song is unequivocally the worst original song on BSSM as this poll would suggest."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,Oggie243,2,Tue Jun 9 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"same, Greeting Song is one of my favorites they've ever made. reading that bit from Scar Tissue after jamming to the song for so long just killed me."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,Oggie243,7,Wed Jun 10 07:52:44 2015 UTC,I love They're Red Hot! It's a classic cover! I voted for the title track it's the only one I do not like.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,Jibbs74,4,Tue Jun 9 23:08:30 2015 UTC,"From Blues legend Robert Johnson, his version is longer and slower. Was covered by Clapton too.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOXXh24HnmY"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,NakedBryan,4,Tue Jun 9 23:15:02 2015 UTC,What's the dislike with They're Red Hot? That's a great song and they recorded it at 3am on a hill side at the mansion!
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,DayOff4Superman,6,Tue Jun 9 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"Clearly ""theyre red hot"" is the right choice here. First off its a cover, its stupid fast, and its really short. Its not the end of sir psycho it  is its own track and i dont care what anyone says but every single song on bssm blows it out of the water.   Dont get the hate for the greeting song at all.   That songs groovy as fuck with an awesome chorus."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,kilbaCZE,3,Tue Jun 9 15:42:00 2015 UTC,Confession time: I nearly chose Under the bridge
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,NakedBryan,3,Tue Jun 9 11:48:58 2015 UTC,"Under the Bridge is a song that I can appreciate how musically and emotionally it's incredible, but I just don't enjoy listening to it. To me it just feels slow and at times, boring to listen to. If not for They're Red Hot I would've chosen it too."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,bigfudge_23,5,Tue Jun 9 13:04:08 2015 UTC,To me it doesn't fit in with the album.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,Powerstars,5,Tue Jun 9 13:07:20 2015 UTC,Most great songs never do.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,NicDwolfwood,4,Tue Jun 9 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Same with Can't Stop. I think it doesn't really fit in entire By The Way album. It's just... I don't know, but the vibe it has really is not the BTW vibe. But still, great song."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,TiitsMcgeee,2,Tue Jun 9 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I don't know if it's because it's the title track but to me it feels like it summarises the whole album pretty well.  EDIT: Turns out I replied to the wrong comment x.x But yeah, Under the Bridge, I Could Have Lied and Breaking the Girl imo don't have the same sort of in your face funk / rock the rest of the songs have. They're all damn good songs though."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,JV19,3,Tue Jun 9 13:13:06 2015 UTC,"I believe he's talking about Under the Bridge, not BSSM"

RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,MysticalTurban,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:56:32 2015 UTC,"Voted for Funky Monks, it just draws out and annoys me for some reason. I enjoy the rest of the album. I don't think of They're Red Hot as a song, but more of a way to close the album."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3958j8,ZestyTako,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:44:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm gonna say the title track honestly. Even though I still like it. Good workout song.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3929p3,Seat_Sniffer,4,Mon Jun 8 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Warped is an explosive start, Deep Kick is spectacular, My Friends calms things down a bit, One Big Mob is brilliant just for the sonic echo-y bit in the middle, Walkabout is the most chilled song there is, One Hot Minute is great, Falling Into Grace is funky as fuck, and Transcending couldn't have given it a better ending"
RedHotChiliPeppers,3929p3,Seat_Sniffer,4,Mon Jun 8 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"Aeroplane, Falling into Grace, Transcending, and Shallow Be Thy Game* are some of my favorite songs by them.  Edit: Woops, lol"

RedHotChiliPeppers,3929p3,Seat_Sniffer,2,Wed Jun 10 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"I mean I liked it, but it's definitely my least favorite. It shifted to a much more pop vibe. I like all of the songs on the album, but when the album is only those songs, I seem to lose interest."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3929p3,FlameSama1,6,Tue Jun 9 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"I wish they'd just play it once, start to finish, just to get those songs out there again."

RedHotChiliPeppers,3929p3,bjisba41,3,Mon Jun 8 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like it couldn't have happened without all these things. Anthony's lyrics are super deep because of his struggle with drugs, and the musical clash between Flea and Navarro creates something truly special."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3929p3,StinkiyPetey5,2,Mon Jun 8 22:29:07 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people don't like this album because of the lack of Frusciante on the songwriting/instrumentation. It's the black sheep of the catalogue. Navarro isn't as bad as people make him out to be. I like OHM a lot.

RedHotChiliPeppers,3949r6,MysticalTurban,3,Tue Jun 9 17:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""I'm With You"" was a little bland. Granted, some of the songs sound good live. I was lucky enough to find RHCP's ""In The Basement"" performance as available in-flight entertainment on my way back from Denver a few weeks ago. They were real tight performing those songs, and they really come alive when live. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBp2znA-XMw  But yeah the actual album is a little bland, a little vanilla. What I was hoping for was that it would indulge in the esoteric, which I know Anthony, Flea, and Josh like. The Chili's have mastered uber-traditional alt-rock. Now it's time for them to take a stinking risk. They're brilliant musicians. A risk for them should equate to brilliance."
RedHotChiliPeppers,3949r6,Brume,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:47:10 2015 UTC,That performance was amazing. I don't know what it was but i think that's the best one they've done from the i'm with you album

RedHotChiliPeppers,38wvw1,ILIKEGAMESOK,2,Sun Jun 7 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"Cabron was one of those songs that I absolutely loved when I first heard it, it was fun and upbeat but after time it really lost that appeal to me. And yeah, I love warm tape too, mainly for the vocals and lyrics."

RedHotChiliPeppers,38wvw1,ohighost8,9,Sun Jun 7 23:55:56 2015 UTC,I wasn't too shocked to see warm Tape take the biggest piece of pie.  I was shocked to see anyone vote for This is the Place
RedHotChiliPeppers,38wvw1,bigfudge_23,7,Sun Jun 7 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"I was shocked to see votes for both, especially Warm Tape. I will admit I hate the name because it doesn't make sense, but the chorus of that song is beautiful."
RedHotChiliPeppers,38wvw1,FunkyMonk707,3,Sun Jun 7 15:41:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always used to skip Warm Tape because the beginning is just weird but the other two parts are beautiful and haunting, especially John's part on the acoustic."

RedHotChiliPeppers,38wvw1,World71Racer,3,Sun Jun 7 22:05:52 2015 UTC,"Voted for Throw Away Your Television, but I still think it's a good song. It just seems a bit too quirky for me at times, but the bassline saves it from me giving it a negative response.   I Could Die for You would be the next one. That's probably the weakest one, but it doesn't do much harm, so it's alright."
RedHotChiliPeppers,38wvw1,baconbash,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:27:23 2015 UTC,"I love I Could Die for You, it just feels so heartwarming.  I can see how Throw Away can get negative responses, but the quirkiness is part of what makes me like it."

RedHotChiliPeppers,38wvw1,kilbaCZE,2,Sun Jun 7 17:14:27 2015 UTC,I voted Cabron

Listen to John's guitar stuff and Flea's bass in it. It perfectly shows quality of this great album.  EDIT: Oh, how I could miss This Is The Place. Actually, this entire album is such a masterpiece."

RedHotChiliPeppers,38upcv,FocusOnThePie,3,Sun Jun 7 01:06:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. Other than that song the alternate masters are perfect. Love how some songs are extended versions basically.
RedHotChiliPeppers,38upcv,mrknowitall95,3,Sun Jun 7 01:10:52 2015 UTC,"I think it is in need of a remix also. More stereo separation, increased dynamic range, and bringing down the volume on Anthony's vocals would do that album very well."
RedHotChiliPeppers,38upcv,riskybizz,2,Sun Jun 7 03:56:00 2015 UTC,Yeah this needs to be remixed. Kick and bass would be difficult to bring out properly even with Katz mastering it.
RedHotChiliPeppers,38upcv,AirVido,2,Sun Jun 7 01:32:39 2015 UTC,"Could someone help me understand the difference in sound between the iTunes version and what a remastered version would sound like? The album sounds fine to me, is there something wrong with it that I just don't hear?"
RedHotChiliPeppers,38upcv,bigfudge_23,8,Sun Jun 7 03:26:54 2015 UTC,"Clipping like crazy, no dynamic range at all. Mono (for people who use 1 earbud lulz)   Literally sounds like your speaker is spontaneously ripping apart when Anthony's vocals get too loud or with the drums sometimes.  Look up ""loudness war"" if you don't know what clipping is, this is one of the most notorious albums along with Metallica's Death Magnetic which I think may be worse even.  Edit: this is what is wrong with the original and what they need to fix in a remaster. There are alternate masters that have a lot of these problems fixed with some different versions of songs and some that didn't make the final cut. Compare this to the official album for the differences."

I mean, Dave was probably very straining to work with, and they probably just lost a lot of their passion for the music."
RedHotChiliPeppers,38q5v0,invisiblemovement,9,Sat Jun 6 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"To correct the ""John would have died"", he was off drugs when he rejoined the band. Dave was already out of the band, and they didn't think they could continue. So I'd imagine that they would have broken up. John on the other hand, would probably be doing exactly what he's doing now, making his solo stuff and what have you."
RedHotChiliPeppers,38q5v0,TonyFlow_17,3,Sat Jun 6 03:29:48 2015 UTC,They wouldn't be today. They said they were almost breaking up at that time. Dave Navarro at the time wasn't much of a creative influence anymore cuz he was also beginning to get fucked up on drugs (although One Hot Minute is hell of an album because of navarros influence). Flea wouldn't continue the band without John
RedHotChiliPeppers,38q5v0,mclollolwub,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:22:26 2015 UTC,"peppers wouldnt have been around anymore. But likely all would have joined other bands, including John. I could see AK starting a new band himself."
RedHotChiliPeppers,38q5v0,DayOff4Superman,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"They would have broken up more than likely. Flea invited John to rejoin as a last effort to keep the band from breaking up. Had John not done that, the Chili Peppers would have broken up and faded away probably."

I actually like the way you played in the solo, it's extra swingy compared to the original. I remember when I covered it I actually doubled the guitar to make it sound more like in the album.

RedHotChiliPeppers,38exux,finnmcd,6,Wed Jun 3 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"You'd basically have to find someone to tab it out for you  Try tabbing it yourself, its a great way to learn!  You might want to start by learning the original song (which no doubt has already been tabbed) and then try to see where josh changed it up  The chords should be the same, so it'll mostly be about finding which inversion he's playing"

RedHotChiliPeppers,38exux,rambopr,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:14:53 2015 UTC,To be fair i rarely ever find a tab thats 100%   Sometimes even official song books put out tabs that are intentionally printed slightly incorrect or in a different position

RedHotChiliPeppers,38exux,Rerellison,3,Wed Jun 3 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"Taking a look at it, it's pretty much identical to the original, except Josh plays the bassline in the verses (with the original guitar chord hit in places), and during the bass solo-y bit he just kinda plays non-sensical shit up the neck."

RedHotChiliPeppers,38azud,lownotelee,4,Wed Jun 3 09:05:00 2015 UTC,"Wiki link  Basically, the songs have been mastered loud in an attempt to make them stand out on radio. You lose almost all dynamic range, and the instruments tend to sound kinda flat and lifeless."
RedHotChiliPeppers,38azud,autowikibot,3,Wed Jun 3 09:33:33 2015 UTC,"Loudness war:       ""Loudness war"" or ""loudness race"" is the popular name given to the trend of increasing audio levels on CDs and in digital audio files since the early 1990s, which many critics believe reduces sound quality and listener enjoyment. Increasing loudness was first reported [by whom?] as early as the 1940s with respect to mastering practices for 7"" singles. The maximum peak level of analog recordings such as these is limited by varying specifications of electronic equipment along the chain from source to listener, including vinyl record and cassette players.

RedHotChiliPeppers,38azud,normally_good,-3,Wed Jun 3 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"No, the production is really piss-poor. The bass is overly boosted and it crushes the vocals and guitar. There are even some parts which it's hard to distinguish the bass from the guitar. The song clips every other bar and I don't even think it was mastered at all. Especially judging by the waveform itself, it doesn't look the slightest bit mastered. The mixing is crap and the guitar is really dry. It's not a bad album. The composition more than makes up for the production. But it still could've been done a lot better."

RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,SamGamesPro,9,Tue Jun 2 06:20:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, they will be around forever like the stones."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,rhcp88,3,Tue Jun 2 06:25:51 2015 UTC,Are you sure? Seems like you just want it to be so. Explain?
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,Asha108,10,Tue Jun 2 07:01:57 2015 UTC,"There's too much money to lose if they aren't making money, plus if they still feel the groove then they'll keep playing."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,rhcp88,3,Tue Jun 2 13:56:09 2015 UTC,Yeah this.  I feel like they're the kind of people who couldn't just hang it up if they still had music left to make.
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,mclollolwub,2,Tue Jun 2 15:13:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think they consider money to be a huge factor in whether or not they continue. If they don't feel the groove I'm sure they will try to find whatever's causing the problem and fix it before doing anything else, as they have done many times before, they won't just think about how much money they will make anyway and give a shit performance to their fans. If they aren't able to feel the groove at some point and their chemistry dies down with no solution available, then I guess that's that..."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,Asha108,2,Sat Jun 6 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"I don't quiet know if you can say there is too much money to lose. Anthony, Flea, and Chad all have near $90 million. They would be fine honestly. Hell, even Josh has around $10 mill and they only sold half a mill on I'm With You."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,World71Racer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:50:23 2015 UTC,Good point.
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,troyandabed123,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was thinking of when I saw this thread. The Stones have been doing touring on and off for years, even with no real new material, and have carried themselves into a whole new generation of music fans. I'd more than love to see the Chili Peppers do that, as long as everyone can stay well & be up for it."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,datpuertorican,6,Tue Jun 2 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"We should wait to see how good the new record is. If they are still pumping out amazing music, I don't see why they should stop, even if Anthony struggles to perform live."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,rhcp192837465,3,Tue Jun 2 12:15:22 2015 UTC,Anthony's voice seems fine at the beginning of every tour. He seems to stress his voice out easier at the later shows.  His recent performance at the UCLA was great! He just needed some  rested I think.
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,datpuertorican,4,Tue Jun 2 07:29:51 2015 UTC,I personally thought that the UCLA performance was not very great on his part. I felt like he kept getting flat.
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,Limjucas328,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:33:28 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I guess my expectations was low considering it was a surprise performance.
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,Gamerhcp,3,Tue Jun 2 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I think they are one of those bands that will continue to make music and tour until they are all super old."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,TheLoneMoroccan,8,Tue Jun 2 14:24:00 2015 UTC,"they should quit after the tour, because really there is no point to become rolling stones or any other 60s/70s/80s band that tours all the time"
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,Gamerhcp,2,Tue Jun 2 09:52:47 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people downvoted you. I wouldn't go as far to say that they should quit. But they definitely should relax on their tours. It seems like they play 100+ shows every time they go on tour and that seems ridiculous. They have an incredible fan base and they just want to please their fans. But this guy is right, they definitely don't need to tour all the time."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,littlesuzie,3,Tue Jun 2 13:23:44 2015 UTC,I'm sure Chad and Flea could do it but Anthony maybe not. His voice has been declining for years and soon he'll have to have one of those stands or whatever for lyrics knowing how he forgets even simple stuff like UTB which was played 600+ times
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,cheekymonkey52,2,Tue Jun 2 13:27:19 2015 UTC,"Man, don't underestimate Flea's love for music, and his love for Anthony. That's what keeps the Red Hot Chili Peppers going. It got them through Hillel's death, John's first quitting from the band, and his second exit too. Flea said that in their 2007-2009 hiatus he missed Anthony, and that made him want to keep the band going. Somehow they are gonna keep going."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,goddamnit666a,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will continue making new albums after the next one. Music isn't their lives anymore - Josh aside, they have families now that have taken the number one priority (as they should). They may continue touring for a while, but I would anticipate that to slow down. I think they will likely release some old unreleased material, possibly that scrapped GH era album as well as the Circle of the Noose stuff. They'll probably do more remasters and special collections, as many aging bands do.  I'd be fine with it, though. They've given us a wealth of material to listen to already. Anthony is getting tough to hear live, and it would be a shame to see my favorite band sink to the Stones' late age level."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,ObscureRyan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:19:18 2015 UTC,"Well, If they do stop at least we'll get to see more music from Dot Hacker, and collaborations/new projects from all band members."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,BromaEmpire,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:18:43 2015 UTC,During an interview on Virgin Radio (Absolute Radio now) back for the promo of Stadium Arcadium they said that they didn't want to be old and still touring like the Rolling Stones (They actually used Rolling Stones as an example) although it was John who made that comment.
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,Heinzliketchup,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:17:49 2015 UTC,"I would say it entirely depends on Flea and the success of their next album. Anthony's vocals are the most deterorating part of the band, but if they can still sell shows, he'll go on till he dies, and Chad can still play every tune and will probably be able to for the next 10 years. And Josh is young. Flea on the other hand has written a lot of difficult bass lines over the years and he's starting to struggle with some of them. He's also pretty modest, so when he can't perform anymore, I think he'll be ready to throw in the towel."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,BestHueHueNa,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:47:17 2015 UTC,"This saddens me so much because I also believe this might be true. I am yet to see them live, and definitely want to see them when they go on tour next, but what I would give to see them live during the Stadium Arcadium tour..."
RedHotChiliPeppers,386pf3,emiirhcp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, I bet they'll make another regular studio album, then wait a year or two, release one final greatest hits compilation, maybe pop out some old unreleased stuff, and then call it quits"

RedHotChiliPeppers,3864n4,helptheunderdog,6,Tue Jun 2 05:14:34 2015 UTC,I don't know for sure I think It might have been tongue in cheek that his wife wanted another baby at the time. Because I don't believe the song was written about him. The song I believe is about a woman who dated someone rich/famous and wants to keep a hold of him by having a baby with him while the man is ignorant of her intentions.
RedHotChiliPeppers,3864n4,Jkrup26,4,Tue Jun 2 04:53:05 2015 UTC,Maybe like how Anthony got his son?
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,outroversion,31,Tue Jun 2 14:08:54 2015 UTC,Yeah it's just you.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Heinzliketchup,7,Tue Jun 2 14:16:15 2015 UTC,Nah I could totally see it. There's a chance I could prefer Josh over John as well but it's just that John has such a sheer volume of work that I enjoy with the Peppers that Josh can't really compare yet.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,CrimsonThi9hs,4,Tue Jun 2 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"John had a huge role in the composition of all that work too. Josh isn't the songwriter or guitarist that John is.  Don't get me wrong, I love Josh's work too. He is an amazing multi-instrumentalist and kills it on guitar... but Froosh was a guitar prodigy from a very young age, and was a very large component in writing their songs."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,FurioVelocious,2,Wed Jun 3 00:31:45 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I feel about it too, I'm very excited and intrigued to see what Josh brings to the table on the next album.   Speaking of which, anybody know when that is expected to come out? This wait is unbearable."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Heinzliketchup,3,Thu Jun 4 03:45:54 2015 UTC,I mean Josh basically used to be an unofficial member.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Heinzliketchup,3,Tue Jun 2 15:50:28 2015 UTC,I thought I was the only one.... God bless
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,TroyJames,2,Thu Jun 4 03:43:14 2015 UTC,Oh my god can you imagine!!! That would be amazing
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Jakefrmstatepharm,5,Tue Jun 2 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"As Chad put it, John ""shits music"". Probably one of the greatest song writers of all time. Josh is technically talented, and I don't think we saw his potential on IWY, but John had an ability to write brilliant, complex music and keep it catchy, which is an extremely rare talent."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,BromaEmpire,3,Sat Jun 6 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"I'm just hoping Josh gets better with this new album, sort of like what we saw with John from MM to BSSM."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,chrisg515,3,Wed Jun 3 09:55:19 2015 UTC,Well I prefer Navarro over Josh
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,mclollolwub,7,Tue Jun 2 15:08:08 2015 UTC,Josh would make a better friend I bet. Does that count?
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,rsmjr,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:00:07 2015 UTC,Why do you say that? I don't see how you could even remotely be able to judge his quality as a friend.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,FurioVelocious,0,Tue Jun 2 15:52:46 2015 UTC,That's why I like him.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,NUNC0,4,Wed Jun 3 14:10:26 2015 UTC,John is the man. I'm not a fan of josh. Still dig new rhcp though
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,YoghurtEater,7,Tue Jun 2 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I do actually like Josh's style better, but John has a greater catalogue which I enjoy very very much."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,rhcp88,5,Tue Jun 2 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"JF is one of a kind.  Josh is cool, but c'mon.  I honestly don't see how any RHCP fan could prefer Josh if given the choice."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,FurioVelocious,2,Tue Jun 2 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see how any RHCP fan could prefer Josh if given the choice.   I think anyone who prefers Josh overall must be unaware of what a huge role Froosh played in all of those albums... with composing/writing most of it, all those guitar layers, all his vocal layers/harmonies, and of course his legendary lead guitar work."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,FurioVelocious,7,Tue Jun 2 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"This is so fucking laughable.  John's backing vocals and composition are arguably just as important to all their biggest hits as his guitar work. Do you just not like almost all of By The Way, Stadium Arcadium, and Californication?"
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,FurioVelocious,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:10:03 2015 UTC,"No I love all those albums, apart from the backing vocals."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,FurioVelocious,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"Well without Frusciante, they wouldn't exist. He was the primary songwriter for almost every song. You may not like his vocals, but he was the main musical driving force behind all of those albums.   Klinghoffer is not on that level of musical ability. Like I said above- He's an amazing multi instrumentalist and kills it on guitar, but he doesn't hold up when compared to Frusciante's creative ability and guitar prowess."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,FurioVelocious,0,Wed Jun 3 00:27:38 2015 UTC,Simply not true.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,DamnHellAssKings,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's all very true. What don't you believe?"

I wasn't expecting a good response anyways.   And yes I deleted instead of editing, who cares? It's telling that you respond about that ... but can't even attempt explain why anything I said is ""simply not true"". Yet another comment showing that you don't know what you're talking about."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Heinzliketchup,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:57:00 2015 UTC,Oh sorry I didn't realise this was pre school and we were arguing over who's the biggest fan lol. Give me a break.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,dva8918,2,Thu Jun 4 04:08:51 2015 UTC,"While I can't say I ""prefer"" Josh to John, I can say that I prefer the direction the band is headed in now compared to the direction the were heading with John when he left. I like the overall vibe of I'm With You and I'm Beside You a lot more than Stadium Arcadium bc they just sound more like a 4-piece rock band (or 5 including Mauro) jamming in a room writing and playing songs together. SA is so layered and produced compared to the relatively sparse IWY, which is more what I want coming from the Chili Peppers.  This sort of back to basics approach reminds me of what The Beatles were trying to do during the Let It Be sessions, or The Rolling Stones did by releasing Beggar's Banquet as the follow up to Their Satanic Majesties Request. I'm a huge fan of John's and have been for most of my life, but when I heard IWY for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew it was an album that wouldn't have happened if he was still in the band.  So while I don't necessarily prefer Josh's style to John's, I may have an even more blasphemous opinion: I'm actually kind of happy that John left when he did bc I think his presence was starting to dominate the band's sound too much, and I really can't imagine I would have enjoyed an epic Frusciante-driven follow up to SA as much as I do IWY and IBY.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers have always been more about the sum of their parts than any one individual member. I'm a big fan of the early records with Hillel and One Hot Minute is one of my favorite albums of all time. John Frusciante is not the end all and be all for this band"
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Taydolf_Switler22,3,Thu Jun 4 04:17:43 2015 UTC,"Even if it's a bit overproduced, you have to admit that SA is an absolute goldmine for guitar licks."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,BoulderFreeZone,2,Thu Jun 4 05:00:28 2015 UTC,"SA is an absolute goldmine for great songs,  whether one thinks they're over produced or not."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Yakobi0919,0,Wed Jun 3 02:46:08 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Someone needed to tell him he's just the guitarist.
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,JV19,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:51:12 2015 UTC,"No no no, JF is much more than just the guitarist, he is a musical genius and is heavily responsible for the masterpieces on SA. Not to mention, JF's back up vocals are way better IMO than Josh's."
RedHotChiliPeppers,387w3c,Gamerhcp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:12:37 2015 UTC,"It's really too soon to tell. It seemed josh was trying to find his place in the band with his sound in ""I'm With You,"" the guy is competent as all hell he rocks all the old songs.   What I miss from john is his acumen for guitar solos, he can just rip off insane Hendrix-esc licks, haven't seen that from josh. The only solo that sticks out from ""Im with you"" to me was Ethopia, it was a very simple solo. I'm really looking forward to the next album to see how he is used then."

RedHotChiliPeppers,385kgk,amadeusz7,9,Tue Jun 2 00:33:06 2015 UTC,"There is just no way to know, really. I think people like to believe that John wrote almost everything on BTW but I have trouble believeing that.  There was an interview posted on here a while ago (full band interview) where John said that BTW was way more collabrative between him and Flea than most people acknowledge.  He said something like it was 50/50 between them.]  I'll start digging for that interview  I think John just structured the songs and came up with the chord patterns but flea most likely worked out his own bass parts within John's structure.  Certain songs do sound like the bass was written by John (Don't forget me, this is the place, Venice queen) But other songs sound like classic Flea lines (Can't Stop, TAYT, Minor Thing)"
RedHotChiliPeppers,385kgk,Jibbs74,2,Tue Jun 2 00:38:40 2015 UTC,cant stop was actually made by john and it sounds so flea like :)
RedHotChiliPeppers,385kgk,im-on-the-inside,6,Tue Jun 2 13:53:20 2015 UTC,I can't find the source but I watched a video years ago and John and Flea were sitting next to each other and John was complaining (in a joking manner) about how everyone thinks he only writes melodic stuff.  He mentions in that interview that he wrote Can't Stop.
RedHotChiliPeppers,385kgk,THCInjection,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:08:50 2015 UTC,Well that wouldnt be a huge surprise since the guitar and bass partz are really similar (identical except for the solo? I dont focus on the bass) in cant stop

RedHotChiliPeppers,385kgk,CFC_MacK22,3,Tue Jun 2 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"Stadium Arcadium, the song, is a song that would fit this description well. According to the SA commentary, that song started off with a drum beat he thought up & played, and it evolved from there."
RedHotChiliPeppers,385kgk,World71Racer,3,Tue Jun 2 06:05:59 2015 UTC,He's written the drum tracks... ?
RedHotChiliPeppers,385kgk,offnr,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:06:08 2015 UTC,"I think Flea was frustrated because John was writing so many songs that were guitar driven, and only needed a basic bass line. John definitely wrote Dosed, Don't Forget Me, and Can't Stop, but anything with a complex bass line is definitely Flea. John has also said that almost all of the vocal melodies were written by Anthony."

Out of all the songs from I'm With You I think this one is the most Frusciante-like song from that album; I get a real Stadium Arcadium vibe from it, with a little something extra from Josh to set it apart. And the way it segues into Look Around is just awesome, i almost can't listen to one without the other. I hope y'all enjoy the cover, let me know what you think!"

RedHotChiliPeppers,37zhdv,JV19,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:25:26 2015 UTC,When they say hard music do they mean like it has to be melodic or it has to be appropriate? A lot of their songs are loosely based off drugs and some about girls. If you want one that has a good and positive meaning I would say give it away most people assume it is sexual but if you look into Anthony has said it is about being a more giving person. My favorite songs for there meanings are the ones that are political like green heaven and power of equality.

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,ILIKEGAMESOK,15,Thu May 28 16:31:31 2015 UTC,But I thought he was a mediocre singer for Stadium Arcadium? Afterward he certainly got better. Saw them live in 2013 and his singing was flawless. I was surprised.

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,ILIKEGAMESOK,4,Fri May 29 08:37:58 2015 UTC,Same thing with me. I try to listen to live shows from IWY  but his voice sounds a lot different now.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,ThatGuyWhoIsCool,2,Thu May 28 19:44:14 2015 UTC,He says in his book he never had singing lessons until basically the Californication tour due to the swing from more rappy vocals to actual singing. You can definitely tell in the improvement from Cali tour to BTW recording/tour and onwards. However his vocals to still tend to be hit and miss from one show to another - he definitely suffers from burnout if for example he has too many shows in close proximity
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,LordAntoine,1 point,Fri May 29 10:48:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his age is showing in his voice. Granted, I never thought he was that great a singer in the first place."

Same with Antjony a bit.  They may be cool, nice guys, I don't claim to know them, but they just don't seem like down-to-Earth people.  John seems even further removed in this sense.  He seems almost other-wordly.  Chad, on the other hand, seems like a regular cool dude who happens to play drums in a world famous rock band.  I really don't know much about Josh, since he's so quiet in interviews but he seems pretty down to earth like Chad."

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,mjj1492,4,Fri May 29 00:54:07 2015 UTC,Most musicians are terrible interviews.  Paul McCartney for example.  Many turn to music to express how they feel or think because they are not very good at it when speaking.

A lot of the time, its what makes the song for me, and it's part of the reason why Give It Away is one of my favorites. I know it's not one of their best objectively, but it's so goddam fun"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,PhillipPPhil,4,Fri May 29 10:33:26 2015 UTC,The drums guitar and bass carry that song all day.   I'd say this is true for most all of the Chili Peppers songs
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,mjs128,3,Thu May 28 22:36:18 2015 UTC,Oh for sure haha. But theres certain songs (like this one) where they go over the top
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,rambopr,3,Fri May 29 01:51:14 2015 UTC,It grew on me. Used to hate it at he start.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,cagethepepper,2,Fri May 29 01:31:10 2015 UTC,"I think the album version, really isn't that great.   Live though.. It's amazing. Listen to Give It Away, Live at Hyde Park.  Amazing sound and great jam at the end."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,5,Fri May 29 01:47:26 2015 UTC,Damn that is very unpopular. I actually think it's their greatest
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,imkunu,49,Fri May 29 10:28:18 2015 UTC,"I think this album will be their last, and I don't think it will be a good one."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,mastarcadium,22,Fri May 29 12:42:33 2015 UTC,"God although I hate to, I believe this too. We've heard a lot about how this album will be ""danceable"" or that they are incorporating Josh's electronic stuff into it and I really don't want that. I just want the good old Funk Rock that is what made them so liked and popular."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Limjucas328,35,Thu May 28 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"That's not how a good band works, imo.  Let them progress and change things. You don't want a band to be stagnant and make the same shit for years. It's boring"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,yinyanguitar,7,Thu May 28 16:17:16 2015 UTC,Nah they need to go back to Slovak style songs just no frills funk... Would be like a rhcp Renaissance with how melody driven their post-bssm material has been.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Limjucas328,2,Thu May 28 16:52:42 2015 UTC,I understand what you're saying. That isn't how a band should evolve though. To make an album like that wouldn't sound right coming from them now at all.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,cacafogo,2,Thu May 28 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  The reason RHCP is still such a great band is because they aren't trying to be something they aren't.  As they change as both musicians and people they aren't trying to hide that and make a hundred BSSM clone albums that are meaningless, and that is a good thing."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,SureNick,14,Thu May 28 18:28:01 2015 UTC,Danceable could just mean Funkier. What's more danceable than funk. Remember Fleas not a young man and might be thinking of something completely different when he uses the term versus what the general public thinks when they use it.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,rambopr,4,Thu May 28 20:09:07 2015 UTC,Or we're very unlucky and he's using a modern definition :(
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Limjucas328,2,Fri May 29 19:15:51 2015 UTC,That isn't a bad thing.  Gotta go into listening with an open mind
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,AvereyK,2,Thu May 28 18:18:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly this is what I have been trying to tell people when they say danceable they don't mean it in the same way these modern artists make dance music there gonna use there own experience and taste to create something danceable, which if you look at there whole collection of music the funkier songs were the more danceable songs so I think this next album might end up sounding closer to songs like american ghost dance or nevermind than dance dance dance or rain dance Maggie at least one can hope."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Limjucas328,8,Thu May 28 22:39:05 2015 UTC,"I trust dangermouse.  It will be poppy and different,  but it will be good."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BillyMurderface,7,Fri May 29 14:14:26 2015 UTC,Pop(ular)py is always associated with the word bad because nobody wants other people to be into their favorite band.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,LordAntoine,2,Sat May 30 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"Sadly I agree. I would be happy if it's not necessarily as characterful and iconic as others, but it becomes a fitting 'outro' for the band. Ending with I'm With You wouldn't be appropriate and would be very anticlimactic.  Of course we could be wrong and they could go on to fire out several more. Here's hoping."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,btncrtj3,36,Thu May 28 17:30:51 2015 UTC,I actually did enjoy One Hot Minute.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,TheDudeness33,10,Fri May 29 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"By far the most underrated of their albums. Not their best, but definitely their most underrated."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,LordAntoine,6,Fri May 29 10:35:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say underrated, more that it gets unnecessary 'grief' because Dave Navarro isn't John Frusciante."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,thebeesbollocks,6,Thu May 28 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"Navarro gets a lot of grief for the way it ended with him, but I respect him for being forward and really putting himself out there on the album. A lot of the songs on OHM were driven by his riffs and solos, which is kind of the opposite to Josh who didn't really have any memorable solos or was at the centre of any of the songs on the last album.  Whether that was because of his timidness or Rick Rubin I don't know but I suppose we'll find out on this next one."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,FrankieVD,5,Thu May 28 17:05:46 2015 UTC,This is not an unpopular opinion though..
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,TonyFlow_17,4,Fri May 29 10:41:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe not an unpopular opinion here, but it's their worst reviewed album post Mother's Milk, or even Freaky Styley. Not many (maybe only one) of the songs from that album have withstood the test of time outside of the RHCP fanbase."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,PandaCow64,2,Fri May 29 10:57:09 2015 UTC,I personally loved that album. A lot of unorthodox and experimental stuff going on. I think it's brilliant.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Jibbs74,26,Thu May 28 17:07:50 2015 UTC,The guitar for Factory of Faith is the filthiest guitar riff in their entire discography
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,JV19,2,Thu May 28 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"Isn't that bass, though?"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Jibbs74,11,Sat May 30 00:24:37 2015 UTC,The bass is also incredible but I'm talking about the guitar riff. It's subtle and it fits nice and snug between the rhythms of the bass and drums. That riff gives me a boner.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BillyMurderface,6,Thu May 28 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"That album is full of great riffs, they're just buried. Red Hot Chili Peppers - I'm With You (LOUDER JOSH…: https://youtu.be/9di0sk54ZBQ"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,5,Thu May 28 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"I really love Josh's playing on I'm With You(even more so on I'm Beside You) I like that it's mixed low, it adds so much without distracting from the songs as a whole. The guitar on Even You Brutus and Annie Want's a Baby are freaking amazing."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,DayOff4Superman,5,Thu May 28 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"I love the louder remixed verrsion, yet I feel it was a missed opportunity to call it ""I'm With Josh"""
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 12:26:44 2015 UTC,I'm probably just more used to the original mix. I'm used to picking out his guitar parts. Must give it another listen though.  Haha yes!
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 12:48:48 2015 UTC,"Wait so by ""filthiest"" you mean you like the guitar riff?   It's subtle and it fits nice and snug between the rhythms of the bass and drums. That riff gives me a boner."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Jibbs74,2,Fri May 29 14:22:29 2015 UTC,Yeah it's my favorite riff
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 15:25:44 2015 UTC,Haha right. I didn't know it was a popular opinion that it was a bad riff. I always liked it! The solo/outro is really sweet as well.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Jibbs74,1 point,Fri May 29 12:50:21 2015 UTC,I don't think people think its bad per se but most people would not consider it the best riff in the Peps discography.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Dry_Oasis,8,Fri May 29 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"OP I think most people love Porcelain and think it's a beautiful song, their argument is that it doesn't fit on Californication, especially not right in the middle of it."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,brockthesock,2,Fri May 29 17:14:38 2015 UTC,It would go great next to road tripping
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,World71Racer,7,Fri May 29 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"I'm With You is a good album with some good songs. There are some really good tracks on it that incorporate a lot of cool elements that has not been seen on many other Chilis tracks, like with some of the World music influences on Did I Let You Know?, and a fun little piano-driven pop tune, like Happiness Loves Company. It's a great start with Josh, and I think it paves the way towards a good follow-up.  However, while there are some good songs, there is some really questionable production done by Rick Rubin. On most of the songs, it feels like the drums are way too loud (Ex: Brendan's Death Song), there is too much brickwalling (Ex: Monarchy of Roses), and on some songs, Josh's parts are hard to hear. Not to mention, it's all too bass-y, and doesn't have a certain level of clarity you'd expect from a Chilis album.  I think that's why I'm excited for this new producer because the band needs a little change. After 24+ years of working with Rick Rubin, someone like Danger Mouse, whose name has been floating around, would be a breathe of fresh air to the group, and for us, too. As long as they still keep it funk-y, I'm happy!   EDIT: Had to format it correctly. The OP was all over the place."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,djfraggle,2,Fri May 29 00:22:29 2015 UTC,"Oh man would I love a RHHP/Danger Mouse collaboration. Other than the shitty U2 album, DM is the shit."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,dcollin4444,2,Fri May 29 08:28:29 2015 UTC,"Well buddy, you're gonna get a full album worth. DM is producing the next album."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,djfraggle,2,Thu May 28 20:03:10 2015 UTC,I did some googling and discovered this earlier. I'm so excited to hear this one.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Robertamus,1 point,Fri May 29 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"I actually agree. The composition and song writing is pretty good, but the mix is pretty terrible. The bass is rounded out so much that it lacks all punch or grit/twang of fleas usual tone, and the guitars are so buried in the mix they're hard to hear. The drums and vocals are almost overpowering."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,dcollin4444,7,Fri May 29 02:45:39 2015 UTC,Okay....you ready for it....?  Rick Rubin is the greatest producer in music history. I feel he is truly a 5th member of RHCP. Hate that he's not producing their next album. His ideas made SA great with John's overlapping guitars.   I'm sure their will be a few people that disagree with me. Haha. Still stick with my opinion RR helped make RHCP what they are today.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BillyMurderface,3,Fri May 29 07:56:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that he can bring the best from the band, and I love the overlapping guitars, especially in The Empyrean solo album. But, I can't stand some of his mixing."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,dcollin4444,2,Fri May 29 01:56:13 2015 UTC,"You know, the strangest thing is his mixing with the RHCP.  The sound on Californication sucked & I wasn't a huge fan of IWY mix.  But my understanding his he isn't the ""sound guy"".  But there was a big uproar with the sound of Metallica's last album.  But it was their best album in years (not a huge fan, but actually loved that album).  So is it unfair to say he makes the mixes bad?  Or is it really Rubin?  That he brings such great music out of bands, its hard to believe he is that bad at the mixing part.  And I'm just asking....I don't really know."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BillyMurderface,2,Fri May 29 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"Well like any huge name in the music biz, I have the understanding he works with a team. I saw some footage of the Death magnetic recordings and he definitely doesn't handle the sound -- but in the end his name is on it so I'll blame him. I heard from somebody that DM was produced for the intention that people would mainly be listening through .mp3s, but I'm not really sure what that means for the mix.  Also, there are people out there who have the unmastered tapes of albums like Californication and have released separate mixes of the album. I find the album much more pleasant but you need to turn up your speakers. https://youtu.be/vTUVcKDDOBY"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BromaEmpire,1 point,Fri May 29 03:03:26 2015 UTC,I don't think he had much of a role in John's layering. He certainly played a big part in the arrangements but the guitar production was pretty much all John. This is a damn good article about the tones and effects on the album.   http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1013/red-hot-chili-peppers39-john-frusciante/16832
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,PKAwesome,20,Fri May 29 04:18:56 2015 UTC,Chili's haven't missed a beat since losing John.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,mjj1492,4,Fri May 29 12:17:44 2015 UTC,Idk if this is unpopular or not but Millionaires against hunger is a fucking awesome track
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,DayOff4Superman,5,Sat May 30 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"I'm torn about most of John's solo stuff. But the few songs I like, i LOVE. I like the guitar instrumentals and the hip hoppy stuff with drum machines, but some of the singing is just weird. Ironically, I loved when he covered songs on the tours.  I like the Trickfinger stuff though. After Below is so freakin cool. I'd love to see him do music for video games or something.  People say the chili peppers will be done after this album. I think they'll be touring well into their 60s like the Rolling Stones. Barring some tragedy, these same members too.  I think the Peppers should do an album of just covers just for the hell of it.  I love They're Red Hot. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the original and of Clapton's version.  Dave Navarro comes off as kind of a dick in most interviews. I can understand why they didnt want him in the Hall of Fame. No excuse for excluding Sherman though. It would have made more sense to include Sherman and just be blatant about excluding Navarro.  When I watch the Simpsons episode with RHCP in it, I pretend that Arik Marshall is John Frusciante with a shaved head."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,UncleFoster,8,Thu May 28 18:48:08 2015 UTC,"""If You Have to Ask"" on BSSM is such a tight jam, only to be ruined by the most FORCED and HORRIBLE chorus on Anthony and John's end..."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BillyMurderface,12,Fri May 29 02:01:09 2015 UTC,"Idk if this is unpopular - but I think it was shitty that they didn't invite Navarro to the RnR HOF ceremony and just be able to coexist with the music they made, because ultimately it got them where they are today."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Limjucas328,3,Fri May 29 14:35:38 2015 UTC,I think that was more hall of fame
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,dcollin4444,1 point,Fri May 29 08:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure either, but I think it kinda sucked too.  Not sure if he was specifically not invited or what the deal was with that."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BromaEmpire,1 point,Fri May 29 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"I think they felt that he should be inducted with Jane's Addiction, though they've been eligible since 2012 and have yet to be nominated.."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,NayOfThunder,12,Fri May 29 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"I don't like the first few albums, up to BSSM (E: actually it's Mother's Milk, thought it came after BSSM). They don't have any songs that are memorable.   Although I haven't listened to them in a while, so my tastes may have changed a little."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,alltoocliche,3,Fri May 29 04:20:53 2015 UTC,I'd say Taste the Pain and Good Time Boys are pretty memorable songs. But that might be because they were two of the ten pre-BSSM songs I used to have.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,cagethepepper,1 point,Sat May 30 03:15:28 2015 UTC,Mother's Milk though.

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,hysterical-gelatin,9,Fri May 29 11:44:17 2015 UTC,I love his voice in dot hacker
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Taydolf_Switler22,4,Thu May 28 16:26:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. Josh sounds like he has more control and range over his singing than John.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,intersecting_lines,4,Thu May 28 16:39:55 2015 UTC,This is what I was trying to say. I prefer John over Josh but Josh is definitely the all around better singer.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,99SoulsUp,3,Thu May 28 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah John sounds cool, but Josh is probably, in a technical sense, quite a few notches above John.  Seeing him live, his voice has a lot of power and control and he's definitely miles better than Anthony."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,HMNbean,5,Thu May 28 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"are you high? i can understand liking Josh's voice better but technically John is a very very good singer, way above Josh."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,2,Thu May 28 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"John is amazing and has a huge amount of emotion in his voice, but by pure technical ability, Josh has a better voice.   I love Josh's vocals on the albums, not so much on the lives. He goes a little overboard if you know what I mean.  John's amazing live."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,HMNbean,5,Fri May 29 00:45:00 2015 UTC,"I've never heard John live, but I have seen Josh with Dot Hacker and he's good, but he's got no power behind his voice.  It's a pretty sounding voice, but no oomph.  John, on the other hand, can go anywhere from ultra rasp, to clean falsetto, to a nice bright mix, to a boomy chesty voice.  I don't believe Josh has that power."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 12:38:48 2015 UTC,"Check out some of the lives on Youtube. John comes up with new Harmonies all the time and does really amazing shouts for songs like Wet Sand!  That's what I mean by emotion. John has this ""wow"" factor. He can project so well. Josh can as well actually, he just never does. Listen to ""Omission"" John and Josh both sing together on it and at the end Josh let's out this powerful wail. So yeah I think Josh has the power, but he's a much more subtle Musician, he likes to stay in the background and add texture to songs and that reflects in his singing."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,HMNbean,4,Fri May 29 12:53:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I've heard everything live on youtube by John, I mean I haven't heard him in person like I've heard Josh.  Omission is one of my favorite tunes and their voices mesh very well together!  I actually think it's easiest to hear John's technical vocal prowess in the Empyrean and forth - even in Letur Lefr and PBX.  It's not just about range but tone and clarity are at their apex on his post SA stuff."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 13:03:29 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. It's a great track! Have you heard the acoustic version? Beautiful vocals on it.  Yeah for sure! He has such a clear but strong voice on Empyrean. Song for the Siren.. Central.. It's great! I really like his style on Enclosure. At the end of... Sleep I think, there's this double vocal thing where one voice is really loud and raspy, one is low and firm, and they are like, half a beat off from each other. Really, really cool.  Cha, shucks to what I said first, John is fucking amazing! Who cares about Josh's technical skill! ;)"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,99SoulsUp,2,Fri May 29 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think Josh has a more texture-y etheral voice compared to John's voice, which has a more ""solid"" timbre."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,3,Fri May 29 14:11:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a good description. With John, you really feel the note. Josh moves around a lot, incredibly difficult to do.. but you could say, John does simple things very well."

A lot of the other songs have more classic songs, but they also have ""filler"" songs which aren't very good. I'm With You has no filler songs. They're all really good.

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,sascottie11,12,Fri May 29 00:57:21 2015 UTC,I liked the B-sides more than the actual album. The only thing I like better about the album is that it actually flows well

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,JV19,6,Thu May 28 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"I think IWY has more filler songs than any other album.  Obviously, no song is truly a filler as it meant something to the band to include it on the album, but there's a handful of IWY songs that are pretty mediocre, imo."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,HMNbean,1 point,Thu May 28 19:24:16 2015 UTC,I think the whole album is full of filler songs except for 1 or 2.  None reach the caliber of SA.

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,LordAntoine,7,Thu May 28 23:24:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say too many songs, more too many unnecessary songs. A lot are very samey and follow the same formula. If they were more different, I'd be more than happy with the quantity."

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,mjj1492,13,Fri May 29 11:02:22 2015 UTC,"Chad and Flea still put out great work, i really only see that decline in AK but that's to be expected of an aging singer"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,2,Fri May 29 01:42:46 2015 UTC,I think Anthony's gotten better if anything. He's doing a lot more with his voice and I like it!
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,mjj1492,2,Fri May 29 08:25:00 2015 UTC,"Well it's definitely at least changed, better or worse listening to Give it Away and then Dani California is a huge contrast"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 00:49:47 2015 UTC,Yeah. Listen to I'm With You and I'm Beside You. His vocals are amazing on them.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"You don't like the lyrics? I love them!   Your Eye's Girl - Do you shine like a temple inside Can I open your doors So gentle and wide Like your eyes girl  Victorian machinery - You be the shack And baby I'll be the desert There is nothing to life When there is nothing to measure It's all our space   Not the mention the chorus of Long Progression and the lyrical set up of Strange man. The way the end of each line in the verse is the start of the next line, sounds really sweet!"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,2,Fri May 29 12:58:11 2015 UTC,"Haha I love both of those lyrics!  The first one suits the tone of the song so well. Namely, the way Anthony sings it. Love the melodies and lyrics on Even You Brutus.  Granted it's not amazing, but I don't think it's any worse then any of his other lyrics. I love the way that line is sung!"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,4,Fri May 29 14:11:12 2015 UTC,"I think they've gone into new territory, it's not like they are trudging around trying to recreate the SA sound without John, they're moving on in a way that they really like I think."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,JV19,6,Fri May 29 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"I think ""I Could Die For You"" and ""Midnight"" are incredibly boring songs."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BadcaseofDTB,11,Sat May 30 03:16:10 2015 UTC,Midnight is one of my favorite songs. The vocal harmonies are non-standard and it really shows John's vocal range without falsetto.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Chocolatedippedbacon,2,Sat May 30 07:25:21 2015 UTC,They're darker and atmospheric and that's what I love about them.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Jibbs74,7,Sat May 30 09:23:37 2015 UTC,The bass fills in i could die for you are INSANE though
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,eazse45,3,Sat May 30 17:35:50 2015 UTC,The verse guitar in Midnight is honestly one of my favorites from Frusciante
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,cagethepepper,1 point,Fri May 29 02:46:10 2015 UTC,I always skip them. Was happy that they didn't write more songs like that.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,TheOnlyMeta,8,Fri May 29 12:59:29 2015 UTC,"Turn It Again is the best track on Stadium Arcadium, with Disc 2 being better overall By the Way is not a very good tune Pre-BSSM the Chilis are almost unlistenable"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,BillyMurderface,4,Thu May 28 23:18:37 2015 UTC,"Turn It Again is one of my favorites on that album. The guitar rips so hard, I'm glad somebody said they like it so much!"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,99SoulsUp,4,Thu May 28 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"I agree on that last one.  Except for a few songs, I just can't get into them.  It seems to overly, in your face, macho."

I rarely listen to them, they were interesting, even more so live, but the albums themselves  aren't that great to listen to I think."

RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,Farcore,1 point,Fri May 29 12:29:29 2015 UTC,Not that I know. I would love if they did! It would be so hard to recreate the ending though.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,beep_23,2,Fri May 29 01:02:58 2015 UTC,I don't mind Anthony's singing.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,SureNick,6,Fri May 29 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"I'm With You is by far my favorite album. Some one already said it but I have my own take. I got into the Red Hot Chili Peppers because I was getting into Funk music, Sly, Parliament etc. Along the way I also got into Punk Music, Lou Reed, Lou Reed, Lou Reed. RCHP was the perfect amalgamation of the two. For that reason I never considered RHCP a 'true' Rock band, like Zeppelin or Zz Top. So when John started adding the Rockier stuff to Stadium Arcadium I hated it.  When you come to their music the way I did through funk and punk these bits sound totally out of place (and just awful most of the time IMO). And the solos don't even get me started.  So John leaves and I'm With You came out and it's Funk fucking tactic. To me Flea and Keidis have been slowing moving from Punk heavy songs to Funk heavy songs over the course of their whole careers, and I'm With You was the result of that process. I think most people who came to the Peppers during the Stadium period don't see this since they came in when John was trying to turn them into a rock band and so when they listen back to the previous album they cue into the more rock elements. So they don't see this progression and look at IWY like this total left field thing and most people don't like when their bands hit to left field (ask the post India Beatles). Love Josh too. He is the rarest thing on earth: a humble lead guitarist. When ever I listen to IWY or INY I always find a new amazing lick he's buried here or there that really completes the song without stealing the spotlight for himself. I think the RHCP are going to be making slightly pinky funk albums from here on out and everyone's going to hate them but I'll love them and just like the post India Beatles have a long term impact on music.   So in conclusion here are the TLDR points for you to tell me I'm an idiot for: 1) IMY is a great album.  2) RHCP are a Funk-Punk Band not a 'true' Rock band 3) John tried to make them a Rock band by adding Rock elements to Stadium.  4) Josh is a just as good a guitarist as John just a different kind of guitarist. (If it wasn't obvious I actually prefer Josh to John) Come at me!"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,rambopr,1 point,Fri May 29 04:21:56 2015 UTC,I guess why you dislike stadium arcadium makes sense.   I was in 6th grade when SA came out and it blew my fucking mind I basically love every single song on that album... it's basically my definition of a great album. But then again i play guitar and love working out the guitar parts which do play a very prominent role   What do you think about the song Charlie? Its in like 6/8 and has a very unique feel to it imo
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,DamnHellAssKings,2,Fri May 29 10:35:05 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell Charlie is in 4/4, but during the verse John's guitar part is in 3/4, which is an example of polyrhythm. Josh's guitar solo on Ethopia is another example, as he's playing in 3/4 (or triplets) while the rest of the band is actually in 7/8. I teach music lessons and the example I always use to explain polyrhythm is Happiness is a Warm Gun by The Beatles. When John Lennon starts his whole ""and when I hold you in my arms..."" speech towards the end of the song, the bass switches into 3/4 while the rest of the band stays in 4/4. Then it switches back to 4/4 the next time ""happiness is a warm gun"" is sung. It's sort of complicated, but interesting to hear when it's done well."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,rambopr,1 point,Fri May 29 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"I dont have it with me right now so you might be right, but i played this song in highschool and my teacher gave us the sheet music  The first 6 notes they play were all quarter notes and i vaguely recall him telling us it was basically a way for the strings to sync up to the beat before the drums kick ,  I tried confirming this a few weeks ago using a metronome set to 4/4 and the 1st beat would always come up at different notes in the meazures But i was pretty baked so i might have fcked that up"
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,DamnHellAssKings,2,Fri May 29 13:58:40 2015 UTC,"The intro is really funky, but I'd still say it's in 4/4. If you start the metronome right on the first note of the song at 108 BPM, it lines up, but then the verse kicks in a little faster, closer to like 111 or 112 BPM. There a few different ways you could write that though so I wouldn't be surprised if the music you had used a different time signature for the intro."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37lwxc,SureNick,1 point,Fri May 29 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a guitarist too and I am making a bit of a sweeping statement when I am talking about SA.  There a quite a few songs on that album that I like Charlie for example and Dani California (of course) was the first song I learned to ""play."""

Co-produced by Perry Farrell and Nuno Bettencourt, the album was preceded by the single, ""Wish Upon a Dog Star"".  The album features contributions from artists such as John Frusciante and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas, former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons, Joy Division/New Order bass guitarist Peter Hook, Porno for Pyros guitarist Peter DiStefano, Hybrid, Thievery Corporation, and finally a pre-recorded vocal performance provided by Jim Morrison. There is also a 30 piece orchestra on four of the tracks, led by Harry Gregson-Williams. The full album was leaked on May 22.  The album entered the charts at #91 on the Billboard 200 with about 8,000 copies sold.

He’s in a place where he couldn’t care less about putting things out or about something being a product. He’s living by different standards right now with a different philosophy, so he doesn’t want to be a part of anything that he knows is going to end up being a product.

Yes, there's album coming up, but man, no shows, Flea's broken arm and then this? Things are going badly. But, pray in god, next album will be absolute kickass - That means one conclusion: Let's Josh going in John's way!

Yes, there's album coming up, but man, no show   this is an incredibly negative view of the Peppers right now. Arms heal. It didnt get amputated. It would be insane to think they won't tour when the album drops ( a good chunk of why RHCP is so rich is that when they tour, they perform A LOT).   I dont think things are going badly at all. A new producer, more mainstream exposure (Super Bowl, Jimmy Fallon), an autobiography of Flea in the works, young talent, a new album. These are all very positive things for fans to look forward too.   Are they touring non stop like the Stones? No. Do they have the media exposure of say, the Foo Fighters? No. But they are still hard at work, and I'm personally excited that a band that has been around for longer than some of us have been alive is still looking towards the future."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37cfuj,DayOff4Superman,23,Tue May 26 19:51:10 2015 UTC,"I would argue that the most ""black"" part of the chili peppers career was when half the band was on the verge of dying from drug abuse while being on a long hiatus,  But that's just my opinion."

I know he's good with the guys but you would get a completely different idea of that if one were to just read some of his comments about them. One interview I distinctly remember,  he refers to Anthony, Flea and Chad as being some of the best ""performers"" in the world and specifically not musicians.  Personally,  it made me sad that he couldn't enjoy the music he made with them even a little."

RedHotChiliPeppers,37cfuj,viramonster,9,Tue May 26 20:52:00 2015 UTC,Ehh even that stuff is personal. You don't see Dave Navarro chillin with his ex-mates. The HOF was about their past and he should have been there for that.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37cfuj,mjj1492,9,Tue May 26 21:11:01 2015 UTC,"I think he just doesn't like them anymore. The BTW tour kinda strained their relationship I mean why not invite the guys you have been with for the past 20 years,heck not even going to the hof.

I think John wanted a different direction for the band. He pretty much winged it until leaving."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37cfuj,XSC,3,Wed May 27 01:20:08 2015 UTC,This seems kind of messed up. I think he's godfather to Flea's second daughter.    Maybe he really doesn't like the band anymore.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37cfuj,DayOff4Superman,8,Wed May 27 12:56:41 2015 UTC,I'm thinking maybe 15 years from now as a reunion tour like the Eagles.
RedHotChiliPeppers,37cfuj,PinataBinLaden,3,Tue May 26 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was hopeful that maybe as a re-union or final tour before they retire, but hearing that John wants to keep even his own music to himself now makes it hard to expect he'll want to play with the RHCP again sadly."
RedHotChiliPeppers,37cfuj,NakedBryan,0,Tue May 26 18:42:29 2015 UTC,He didn't show up to the band's HOF induction so I doubt he'd do a reunion tour

If he hadn't of played in a hugely sucessful rock act for several years, then recording avante garde electronic music alone with no intention of releasing it comercially wouldnt even be an option for him. It's totally fine if that's how he wants to use his musical talents now, but I feel like he's acting as though anyone who puts their music on sale is a sell out or is doing it for the wrong reasons, which is bullshit."

It reminds me of Catcher in the Rye when Holden sees Ernie play the piano.

RedHotChiliPeppers,378qi3,viceassistant,6,Mon May 25 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe a bit. Rhcp is a very influential band. Part of being inspired is taking something from a musician you like and changing it and molding it into your own. Rhcp has done this, the beatles have done this, bruno mars has done this."

RedHotChiliPeppers,378qi3,SamGamesPro,6,Mon May 25 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think some parts it sounds the same. If you remember back in 2013, RHCP and Bruno Mars played together at The Super Bowl. Bruno said that the Chili's are a great band and he loves them and that was the reason he wanted to play with them. So it very well could be influenced by them."
RedHotChiliPeppers,378qi3,DayOff4Superman,3,Mon May 25 21:03:20 2015 UTC,It actually sounds a lot like The Time's Jungle Love to me. But Most of Bruno's hits sound like other musicians. 'Locked out of Heaven' sounds exactly like a Police song.

RedHotChiliPeppers,378qi3,World71Racer,1 point,Tue May 26 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"sounds exactly like a Police song   Specifically Roxanne, and a little bit of Don't Stand So Close to Me, with how it dives into the second verse. Still a good song, though, and nice to see some classic influences creep their way into modern pop."

RedHotChiliPeppers,373zhd,GreedyWriter,3,Sun May 24 21:00:59 2015 UTC,Maybe he's talking about how both songs have almost two parts. A lyrical first half and an instrumental outro.
RedHotChiliPeppers,373zhd,CrimsonThi9hs,1 point,Mon May 25 01:00:39 2015 UTC,Well the outro is what I first noticed. Layla is such a passionate love song and I feel like the lyrics to SSS are the RHCP equivalent. At the time SSS was written I feel like Kiedis has his unique way of expressing what he wanted to say.
RedHotChiliPeppers,373zhd,GreedyWriter,2,Mon May 25 15:14:44 2015 UTC,Electric guitar laden love ballad with instrumental outro. Got it!

Empyrean was amazing and Enclosure was decent but this Acid House music is just weird. Not like he has to make music to bring in the income but I wish he would've liked original music writing.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36wua7,SamGamesPro,1 point,Fri May 22 20:22:23 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you I am not a fan of his newer material. But I think musical artists should always try to venture out and try new music. Trapping yourself in one style of music keeps you predictable. Maybe one day he will return to making his old style of music but will be able to add in his new style

I'm certainly not suggesting that John should make music for anyone but himself, but I lament that I must hop off the train. It creates an ache knowing that he's not going to be making any more music that will be special to me. I always felt a very personal connection with his music (as we all do with our favorite artists) and I'm sad that he doesn't seem to value what he means to his fans."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36x0kv,zekekurlie,4,Sat May 23 00:49:27 2015 UTC,"i think he just values his connection with music more than his fans. i would call it a bit selfish, but it's what he wants, so that's that."

What i hadn't even considered was the fact that it's still john frusciante: and that means that its the same composition style. I would honestly make a concerted effort to give his stuff a listen, otherwise you'll be missing out.

RedHotChiliPeppers,36mwt4,homefree122,4,Wed May 20 15:38:46 2015 UTC,Love that song.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36mwt4,reddit2therescue,2,Wed May 20 21:21:48 2015 UTC,Honestly one of my fav Peppers songs.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36mwt4,Regit394,3,Thu May 21 01:46:28 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of this girl that cheated on me and left me, but I still couldn't get over her."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36nm50,baconbash,1 point,Wed May 20 18:20:22 2015 UTC,I like the hook in this song. It's just too damn repetitive. I honestly struggle to get through the whole thing - and I love a lot of the IWY session songs.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36nm50,Max_Powers08,1 point,Wed May 20 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first heard this song and I showed this girl and her first response was ""What the fuck? Are you gay"". I was thinking lol wtf dont be a bitch. Anyway, about a year later she was as big of a fan as I am. So yeah that's my story."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36n3ce,LordAntoine,9,Wed May 20 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"I think that if you watch all of those commentaries, things might seem different. They all joke around and even in the Wet Sand commentary, I took those quotes you mentioned as John being very meticulous about what he allowed to crossover from his solo material into the band, rather than being passive aggressive against Anthony. I think you might be guilty of a little cherry picking to make your point. In reality, I believe that the truth falls somewhere in between. The band probably weren't ""brothers"" as we all like to believe, but I also think that John probably over exaggerates the personal distance because he's obviously still bitter, not only about the band, but rock music as a whole (although exactly what he's bitter about I'm not sure)."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36n3ce,zekekurlie,4,Wed May 20 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"I remember reading something about a solo song by John that Anthony really liked and wanted to use for the band. John said no because he felt like he had to keep the two ""careers"" apart.  If i remember correctly the line ""john says to live above hell"" from This Velvet Glove is a reference to that particular solo song by John."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36n3ce,Raitug,2,Wed May 20 21:16:42 2015 UTC,"Yeh I agree it's likely somewhere in the middle. I honestly wasn't cherry picking to make a point. In fact the opposite, it kind of dawned on me the more I listened. Like for most of the tracks John talks about what he did technically, and what he wanted to do as a concept for the album etc. Whereas Anthony and Flea spoke more about how they loved the groove, and what the lyrics meant. The more I listened the more it seemed the difference was already present."

The moment they play this live and have four guitarists I'll die a happy man.  Edit:  It was teased when they played in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."

RedHotChiliPeppers,36j2jy,zakkarius,-3,Wed May 20 11:15:23 2015 UTC,:'-) Best song on the album for me. This band would be nothing without Anthony's uniquely beautiful lyrics.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36j2jy,DeviousBurger,3,Tue May 19 22:49:46 2015 UTC,That's not true. Each member of the band is an incredible musician in their own right.  That's what makes them so good.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36j2jy,zakkarius,-4,Wed May 20 00:47:22 2015 UTC,That's very true but the chilis have had replacements for each spot besides Anthony. Can you imagine a chilis album produced with a different singer? I also feel this way about flea. It'd be odd.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36j2jy,totkopf1,5,Wed May 20 00:52:40 2015 UTC,"not every spot, just drums and guitar...flea was a founding member"
RedHotChiliPeppers,36j2jy,zakkarius,-3,Wed May 20 01:38:06 2015 UTC,I know but he left very shortly back in the day
RedHotChiliPeppers,36j2jy,alltoocliche,6,Wed May 20 03:16:48 2015 UTC,So did Anthony.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,Gamerhcp,6,Tue May 19 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"Amazing preformance, although I think it's kind of weak by Anthony to need to read the lyrics from a paper for one of their most successful songs ""By The Way"" haha. But nethertheless, a solid preformance by them."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,Loopgreyser,3,Wed May 20 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"It's Anthony, what can you expect..he forgot lyrics to UTB back in 2004 too"

RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,rhcp192837465,5,Wed May 20 19:10:00 2015 UTC,Glad so see John's brown acoustic is still alive and kicking :)
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,Abyssofmind,3,Tue May 19 23:59:47 2015 UTC,I thought the same exact thing. Glad see Josh use that.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,Abyssofmind,3,Wed May 20 02:09:30 2015 UTC,"Didn't know John gave it to him, no one mentioned it probably because Josh rarelt used acoustics on tour. All i know is that one of the telecasters was John's"
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,rhcp192837465,2,Wed May 20 07:12:36 2015 UTC,"He has had it since the Bicycle thief though, there's footage with him playing it with PJ Harvey and Bob Forrest"
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,finnmcd,0,Wed May 20 10:44:21 2015 UTC,"oh, so i guess John had more than 1 of those"
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,finnmcd,2,Wed May 20 10:52:20 2015 UTC,"He could've also bought it himself, you know. And yes, at the 2001 live at Amsterdam show (you can see it full on Youtube) he has 2 with him (you can see him changing them because of a broken string)."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36i7xt,tealicious1337,2,Wed May 20 10:57:06 2015 UTC,I don't think John gave that to him.

RedHotChiliPeppers,36lpjb,LordAntoine,1 point,Wed May 20 13:09:06 2015 UTC,Yeah his vocals in Dot Hacker are crazy good...  give a listen to Rest Assure  (especially at 2:50 on)  and basically all of Memory
RedHotChiliPeppers,36lpjb,intersecting_lines,4,Wed May 20 16:32:56 2015 UTC,I reckon Josh is a fkn amazing singer and I'm excited to hear him more on the new album but in the meantime check this out  https://youtu.be/mfTfd_0--WM?t=244   At 4:16 of this live performance of 'Otherside' you hear Josh on backing vocals and that alone makes it one of my favourite versions. One of.
RedHotChiliPeppers,36lpjb,Subulie3,2,Wed May 20 09:17:47 2015 UTC,One of my favourites. Also the intro to it is amazing

RedHotChiliPeppers,36f81w,intersecting_lines,-5,Mon May 18 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"'The biggest criticism you can make of this album, and why it isn't higher in the list, is that it doesn't really tread any new ground for the Chilis.' This is part of his review for SA. I COMPLETELY disagree and its their third highest selling album and has the most content and doesn't follow, 'but unlike the classic double albums there is nothing that screams at you to pause the disc and immediately listen to it again.' When I've asked people if they listen to RHCP they say no until I have them listen to Dani California, which makes them recognize the band. So many of their songs on here nearly make me cry from how beautiful they are. He claims its not as memorable as it could have been which is completely wrong to any Chili fan."
RedHotChiliPeppers,36f81w,cheekymonkey52,3,Tue May 19 00:08:04 2015 UTC,"Not much love for early RHCP aside from UMPP. I don't think it's a horrible ranking, though. Personally, I would put IWY much lower and I'd move both OHM and MM up, but music is very subjective. They got the top two right, imo."

For anyone out of the loop, this is one of 2 jams the Peppers had with Ekkehard Ehlers back in like 2003. Most of you probably know Tuesday Night in Berlin as it was included as live b-side on the Fortune Faded single. Enjoy!  edit- Tuesday Night was recorded in 2003. Thursday Night was recorded in 2006. (according to the video description and to another forum post I saw around the net). It's really weird though because they sound very similar."

RedHotChiliPeppers,35yg6j,nufcneilo,4,Thu May 14 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"This album, alongside BSSM, hugely inspired me as a bassist."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35yg6j,alf_pog,3,Thu May 14 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"I think Dirk's bass playing is actually more nuanced than Flea's, in that it incorporates more of the jazz element than the funk element. Dirk is one of the more underrated bass players of the era, although Flea is obviously incredible and has his own well-defined style based on Bootsy Collins'.  I think comparing them might be like Apples vs Oranges, but as a bass player, I'd say Flea's style is more accessible. I'd also say I really should learn more of Dirk's basslines."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35yg6j,nicotineapache,2,Fri May 15 09:32:40 2015 UTC,"Great points.  Both have done amazing things and have made the bass guitar an instrument of interest for many young musicians.  Flea really became more melodic beginning with BTW, which is fantastic.  He still brings the funk, but also writes some beautiful bass parts.  I wonder what Dirk is up to these days?"

RedHotChiliPeppers,35yg6j,mclollolwub,1 point,Fri May 15 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"cc /u/An_Obese_Baby    So I think they changed labels recently, and as of now they only have a new album and one from 2005 on Spotify[The 2005 album is called ""Company"" and is good also, I'd recommend checking it out). My favorite album (aside from an old demo tape of theirs I have) is called ""Pawn Gone King."" I have been looking but can't find anywhere to stream it :(    But you can get a taste of it by sampling their tracks on Amazon    There are a lot of videos from their Lava Lounge show on 6-29-13.     Indie Revolution is from Pawn Gone King(this version includes the live intro from the album)    She Devil is a super funky track from Pawn Gone King    Kings of California Live in Redondo Beach. Kind of a RATM _ RHCP vibe    Some stuff off the album ""Heavy Lies the Crown"" Black Jack Guru    The Truth Hurts(I'd Rather Not Say)    Matador ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRACKS    Funky Train a fun track reminiscent of RHCP's cover of ""Love Rollercoaster""    Philosophize another one of my favorites, harder funk"

I then layered them over each other on the keychain to make sure they looked right.   The keychain is some type of rubber, so it didn't stick down much, which made the tape easy to remove. It was layered tho so it kept it's form, and I stuck the shape on the controller. I used an old broken Xbox 360 controller as a test subject beforehand to make sure it came out nice :p"
RedHotChiliPeppers,35x41b,AvereyK,1 point,Thu May 14 20:49:01 2015 UTC,Nice I may try the same thing since I have a few broken 360 controllers that I could experiment on. I might try putting a pot leaf on there as well. I have seen some pretty crazy designs on youtube where people just doodle all over the thing and it ends up looking sick. Do you take the controller apart when you do it? I feel like it may be risky letting paint get inside if I'm trying to use the controller later.

Also, COMPRESSION, that is like 99% of johns tone, clean or distorted, without the compression you can't accurately play Funky Monks, Under the Bridge, If You Have to Ask, Give it Away or anything funky because funk tone is mostly compression. This guy needs compression and to turn his chorus rate down a bit.   i mean listen to him play If You Have to Ask then go listen to the actual recording. Closest I ever got was compressor maxed out on the attack, treble pickup of a strat, and a wah pedal turned on but not moving."

But, I don't really think that RHCP is a ""break-up"" band. Maybe check out Augustana. Also, the best break-up band in the world is probably Death Cab for Cutie (IMO of course)   Check out: No Room in Frame   Black Sun  Brothers on a Hotel Bed   But, I also advise that don't spend too much listening to sad songs. They kill you inside when you're feeling vulnerable :P Here are my happiest songs from RHCP:   Look Around  Apache Rose Peacock  My Lovely Man  Factory of Faith   and non-RHCP:  The New Radicals- Get What You Give  Goldfish- Sound Tracks and Come Backs  Also, RHCP doesn't really do angry music, they're a band filled with love for people and the world. So if you want ""Fuck you"" break up songs... I enjoy Queens of the Stone Age  I Appear Missing- the song that got me through my break up   Everybody Knows That You're Insane  And the perfect ""Fuck you"" to him would be these lyrics: I Never Came   Good luck and all the best with the break up- I hope it helps :)"

Does it make them mainstream?, Well just as /u/holter93 said. 'who gives a shit' It's about the great music anyway. So what if some songs are well known."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,hessproject,8,Mon May 11 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with the ""who gives a shit"" sentiment...  That being said... the band is one of the best selling artists of all time with more than 80 million sold and has won 7 grammys. They even played the super bowl. Yes they are mainstream."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,Hnuggets,8,Mon May 11 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think RHCP is one of the few bands that can be considered very mainstream and not mainstream. Tons of people know their singles,  and they have some of the biggest rock hits of the 90's and early 2000's. But not many people I know like to dig deep into their music, once they do they tend to like them but most people just like to stick with the singles."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,coolaswhitebread,5,Mon May 11 20:18:25 2015 UTC,"I think that can go for lots of mainstream groups though. Take a nicki minaj or a taylor swift for example. They're undeniably mainstream, but most people, even fans of pop music, will only know their singles."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,Hnuggets,7,Mon May 11 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"Idk I think thats a little different. Mainstream Pop music is so celebrity based, people who like the mainstream chili's songs seem to actually like the music, not because they like Flea, Chad, Anthony etc...your point makes sense as this can apply to any band with hit singles, but I just always felt like RHCP was more about the music."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,BoulderFreeZone,4,Mon May 11 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"They are mainstream in the same way that a band like Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin are mainstream. A lot of people know their hits, but the bigger fans dig much deeper into the catalog."

RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,JV19,1 point,Mon May 11 20:51:40 2015 UTC,My two favorite RHCP songs (Desecration Smile and Otherside) were both singles.  I think the reason the singles are singles is because they're some of their best songs.

RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,pedropereir,6,Mon May 11 23:11:23 2015 UTC,I find it really sad when I hear someone say that they love RHCP and ask them their favourite song and it turns out to be one of the their major hits. I wish people would delve into the peps music more because they would appreciate the amazing variety and levels of the peps music. With that being said I can't blame then for liking their most popular songs. They are up beat and catchy and have a general message that can be related to be most people I just wish more people have their less famous stuff a chance because it's most certainly better in my opinion. Turned into a rant sry
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,OGMagicConch,15,Mon May 11 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"Just because their favourite song is a major hit, doesn't mean that person hasn't heard other songs from the RCHP."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,iCHEWstride,2,Mon May 11 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, my favorite song is Otherside, but less popular stuff like One Hot Minute is still amazing. All their albums/songs are."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,GreedyWriter,2,Tue May 12 06:28:43 2015 UTC,You are correct I guess what I meant to say was that they only really know the hits. Some people that are avid listeners really like their famous songs. From my personal experience anyone who has listened to the majority of the music they have has a favourite song that isn't really that popular.
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,CFC_MacK22,5,Mon May 11 21:05:11 2015 UTC,RHCP are my be all end all favourite band. I've listened to all of their albums dozens of times. There's a reason their hits are hits.
RedHotChiliPeppers,35mjkv,CrazyBeat,2,Mon May 11 21:03:18 2015 UTC,I know pretty much every rhcp song but my favorite is Can't Stop (closely followed by Strip My Mind though).   ¯_(ツ)_/¯ hey I guess there's a reason the famous songs are famous.

RedHotChiliPeppers,35a74b,iamnotjoshklinghoffe,6,Fri May 8 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"James seems to really be riding the success of his brother. Every documentary, almost every photo from their youth, and plenty of other RHCP related materials has his hands on it. I appreciate his sharing of memorabilia, but damn, it always come off like he's milking the shit out of Hillel's memory- living vicariously through his legacy."

RedHotChiliPeppers,35a74b,iamnotjoshklinghoffe,7,Fri May 8 23:29:48 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with it if the money went to some sort of charity - perhaps to a heroin rehab facility or something of the like.
RedHotChiliPeppers,35a74b,acrb101,6,Fri May 8 19:39:52 2015 UTC,This. It would be a nice gesture of him to do something like that. I would actually enjoy buying it even more.
RedHotChiliPeppers,35a74b,iamnotjoshklinghoffe,6,Fri May 8 23:23:31 2015 UTC,"Lol, yeah that was my first reaction, too. I mean he's selling royalty paystubs for $25, just odd. I guess if he has a market..."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35a74b,heypal121,3,Fri May 8 18:40:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. This feels like something Flea or Hillel for that matter would be okay with. Just really shitty to take advantage of your deceased brother's fame.

Once he threw an ice cube from across the room and it landed on Anthony's shoulder and sat there. ""  haha Flea's awesome  edit: had to add that first sentence"
RedHotChiliPeppers,35asau,SamGamesPro,8,Fri May 8 15:27:41 2015 UTC,I personally think John would've still ended up leaving. He's an individual mind and another reason fo his leaving was being tired of being restricted to what people thought of him and having to play the same songs over and over again. He just wanted to role at his own pace I guess and I doubt the chili's would ever changed their style just maybe become more pop but that's it. I mean Chad and Flea are pro rock music to like another level and Johns completely transitioned to house/acid house(?).
RedHotChiliPeppers,35asau,Jdcarty,1 point,Fri May 8 15:48:30 2015 UTC,I don't think he felt restricted. He's stated that making BTW was the happiest time of his life. He wrote most of SA rifts and choruses.
RedHotChiliPeppers,35asau,cheekymonkey52,1 point,Fri May 8 19:05:24 2015 UTC,"He diffidently didn't want to continue traditional music, as hes stated several times. But saying he was restricted while in the band is a stretch. He wrote lots of, and even most of Stadium Arcadium. He was maybe restricted in the TYPE of music he could make but I feel with some of the songs on Empyrean, he could have adapted that with RHCP. I don't know if they could ever go as far as Enclosure though."
RedHotChiliPeppers,35asau,RHCProy,3,Fri May 8 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure Anthony or Chad could hang with John's new art style. Anthony has pretty limited vocal range as it is, and I don't think he would sound very good with those kinds of vocal melodies. Chad is a straight rock drummer. I can't see him transitioning to acid house drumming. Flea has expressed interest in electronic music, and you can definitely hear electronic influences in his basslines. I think he wouldn't have too much difficulty adapting to John's new art style. 2 out of 4 isn't good enough, though. John would still probably leave."

RedHotChiliPeppers,35dgbf,chrisg515,0,Sat May 9 11:07:10 2015 UTC,"I dont think he even wants kids, probably because he's SO busy with music. Speaking for myself here."

RedHotChiliPeppers,35dgbf,Kracker5000,0,Sun May 10 20:55:40 2015 UTC,Children like you are the reason things on Reddit get downvoted so much.

The Peppers will still be the Peppers without Rubin, and I feel like JK will work much better with a producer, who I feel, really understands the applications of electronic instruments and beats in rock. And besides that, RHCP is an ever evolving band as we all know, and a new producer will only add to their musical experience."
RedHotChiliPeppers,359cyz,goddamnit666a,4,Fri May 8 05:16:47 2015 UTC,I agree with most of that but you still can't say RR doesn't have a firm understanding of electronic instruments and beats
RedHotChiliPeppers,359cyz,DeputyFicus,10,Fri May 8 14:56:40 2015 UTC,"Well, it was a time for a change, I think everyone would agree that sticking with Rubin was always the safe thing to do, and maybe limited their progression as a band.  Josh will play a huge part in the new record because he was part of Gnarls Barkley's touring musicians, who Danger Mouse produced (St Elsewhere & The Odd Couple), so there's that link.   Basically, you're guaranteed a hit single with this guy - look at the effect he's had on The Black Keys - who, in my opinion, have continually produced great singles but progressively less interesting albums, since they began working with Danger Mouse.  But I do not see a big shift in musical direction. When Flea said the songs would be ""super danceable"" I think we're looking at a more ""Get Lucky"" type vibe. I really don't think we'll be seeing electronic music though.  So, for me, neither a thrill nor a turn on. If they get a huge single out of it, and I think they will, then it will open up the band to new fans, who will have their vast discography to explore and experience for the first time, and that is something special."
RedHotChiliPeppers,359cyz,BohemianBuoy,7,Fri May 8 10:16:46 2015 UTC,"It sounds great to me, Flea has always had a real techno-dance-bass-vibe thing going on and I'd like to see that indulged.

I will gladly join that minority. It's a good song that possesses a good bit of musical value, but it's ruined by Anthony's lyrics and vocal melody, like with the ""Dance dance dance"" part which sounds absolutely lazy to me.   I wouldn't mind the band expanding on the input & output they put in & got from that song because it sounds rather ambient, but fun and Chilis-like."
RedHotChiliPeppers,359cyz,World71Racer,1 point,Sun May 10 03:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get you, I used to feel that some lyrics were kind of brainless and ""not creative enough"" but now I feel differently. There's a kind of pure joy in Anthony's slightly ridiculous nursery rhymes, he's clearly genuine in his silly fun, which makes it for me. I think I have heard talk about this song in interviews. Maybe Flea said it was his favourite? Seeing him on stage, he really loves to let the music move through him, and I'm guessing this track really facilitates that. On a weird tangent - my other favourite band Radiohead have a song with the lyric ""Just as you dance, dance, dance"" - it's strangely silly for a band with a ""serious"" reputation. I love that version too though!"

RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,ewoutheeftplatjes,23,Thu May 7 07:36:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, I love John. But he seems full of contradictions over the years.  He seems to dislike pop music, but he has also said that rock is stagnant and pop is sometimes the only music evolving.   He says that music should come from the friendship, which I agree. But RHCP has never come off like Metallica or the Stones that seem to be together only for the music, and don't even see each other when not recording. John is godfather to flea's youngest daughter. There's obviously a huge non musical bond between the group.   This feels like what really happened. AK, Flea, Chad felt that they continue as a band taking time off for themselves occasionally to explore new things (AK's fatherhood, Chad's charities, Flea going back to school), but John thought the best way to continue as a band was to work nonstop, and possibly even go electronic. Be more experimental in their sound. Can't blame JF. Daft Punk and Pharell Williams have pretty much brought funk and disco to the mainstream using a more electronic sound. AK has said in interviews when asked about it, that being in a band is a democracy. You put it up for a vote where you want the band to go, musically and non musically. And AK is supposedly very against changing the sound of the band too drastically, quote possibly from the reaction OHM got. Remember what his nephew said in the AMA about WB telling the Peppers to sound more like Mumford and Sons? Ugh. Chili Peppers music was not what JF wanted to do anymore. He wanted to make music for himself, not for fans, to learn music for himself, not for a band. He didn't want the career of being a musician. I know we all loved seeing Chad and Ferrell goof off, AK sing with Bruno, perform funkadelic with the Roots. I loved it too. But that's what mainstream acts do for their fans, they provide FAN service. RHCP is a pop band, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I love that they're popular and make money. But John, He would've HATED doing the Super Bowl, or the Tonight Show. Hell, that might have made him quit on the spot. Performing constricted music for people who didn't come for music? Doing a performance to top off a fake drum battle inspired by a comedy skit? FOH. The Hall of Fame? More abstract recognition from others. No thank you.   In a way John is like a Bizarro world version of Kurt Cobain. In that documentary on HBO, Kurt said that he was much more interested in hearing what his songs meant to his fans, and what they got out of it, and their own individual meanings, than he was explaining Nirvana's meanings. JF is the complete opposite. He is not at all interested how people take his music, whether they like it, whether they dance to it or not. He looks out for himself and himself only musically.   So John went to make music for the only person who he thought benefits from making music. Himself. More power to him. He's certainly rich enough to do that for the rest of his life. But I wish he wouldn't talk about the last years of RHCP as some negative experience for him.   Great interview though. Love his Ali shirt too."
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,DayOff4Superman,7,Thu May 7 14:06:17 2015 UTC,yeah his world view changes every 5 years or so. He'll be back in RHCP hopefully before Anthony's voice completely goes.
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,HowyadoinOK,11,Thu May 7 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd hope to see it, I really dont see John rejoining."
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,Frusciante_Fucker,4,Thu May 7 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"for the reason alone, I don't think the band would want to kick Josh out. Not after all the work they've done, the media appearances, etc. They didn't bring in an outsider like Navarro this time. They brought someone in who knew the music, knew the band, and probably most importantly, knew the process of the Peppers."
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,DayOff4Superman,19,Thu May 7 19:42:49 2015 UTC,If john wanted to come back i'm positive they would go 5-piece.
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,Jibbs74,2,Thu May 7 20:14:19 2015 UTC,Have Josh go back to his roots as a keyboardist? Would add a whole new sound to the band.
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,Asha108,6,Thu May 7 21:41:35 2015 UTC,Or simply keep him as 2nd guitarist
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,Gamerhcp,1 point,Thu May 7 22:27:43 2015 UTC,Honestly I agree completely.
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,LedZepp42,6,Thu May 7 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"Great interview! I find some of the RHCP bits quite surprising. Example: ""In this day and age it just seems like, if people really love making music together, they should also really love being around each other as people, and music should come from the friendship. It shouldn't be the friendship is there because of the musical collaboration. To me that seems backwards, but that's what it was in my old band—we didn't sit around, hang out and listen to records or anything. """
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,Le0zel1g,3,Thu May 7 10:15:58 2015 UTC,"I think this quote perfectly sums up his anti-commercial sentiments of pop music. In reality, the Chili Peppers have a load of committments that go along with being in a hugely successful rock band, such as interviews, promo pieces, etc... I think John just grew tired of it. He cleary didn't enjoy that aspect of being in a band, and just wants to make music.  I do wonder whether he suggested the Chilis go in an electronic direction after Stadium Arcadium and it wasn't greeted with enthusiasm. Josh recorded Sphere with John prior to joining the Chilis, but there's not an ounce of electronic music in I'm With You, so I do think member(s) of the band do not endorse incorporating that genre into their music."
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,BohemianBuoy,3,Thu May 7 13:39:32 2015 UTC,I do wonder whether he suggested the Chilis go in an electronic direction after Stadium Arcadium and it wasn't greeted with enthusiasm.   I personally think this was exactly what happened.
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,DayOff4Superman,1 point,Thu May 7 19:41:10 2015 UTC,Wasnt Californication going to be recorded with David Bowie and be more electronic based?
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,manualex16,1 point,Sun May 10 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, isn't it ironic that according to Flea and Chad, the next album will be “super danceable,” well that if super danceable refers to incorporating some electronic or dance music elements."
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,Le0zel1g,1 point,Fri May 8 04:58:07 2015 UTC,"I think super danceable means closer to hump de bump, dance dance dance, or maybe back to funk roots, or a little more hip hop beat oriented. (remember Danger Mouse has also done hip hop albums)"
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,DayOff4Superman,8,Fri May 8 12:09:22 2015 UTC,"Great interview, but it just saddens me to see a guitar genius disowning his past and amazing work.     You can pretty much cut and paste what Thom Yoke was saying around 1999/2000 with what John is saying now, mentioning the exact same artists as influences. With Radiohead they did put out some great albums afterwards, including Kid A and In Rainbows. But otherwise a lot of it is just lifeless glitchy computer noises (to me at least).   It's just a shame that one of this day and ages last guitar gods is now heading down the same path. On the other hand I guess I never give electronic stuff a fair chance... I'm stubborn."
RedHotChiliPeppers,355ifg,chrisrap,5,Thu May 7 11:01:49 2015 UTC,"I really like bands that use the electronic stuff like Ratatat does. They seem to have a perfect blend of electronic and guitars, it sounds really nice."
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,SamGamesPro,14,Thu May 7 02:19:57 2015 UTC,I love how they give Navarro an acoustic and Chad some portable drums but don't even try to explain Flea's electric bass lol
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,Walrus13,6,Thu May 7 04:58:05 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that there was definitively a lot of religious symbolism in this album. Plus, there's always a lot of imagery and lyrics about transexuals and cross dressers and various other ""taboo"" subjects. Interesting."
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,Asha108,6,Thu May 7 03:20:11 2015 UTC,"MTV has nothing to do with the pulling of that Anton Corbijn's version. The band didn't like it. In Anthony's words ""that version's not so good, whereas Gavin Bowden's studio documentary style version is a little more real.""  Now I wish they would officially release that One Hot Minute documentary shot by Bowden in its entirety."
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,Le0zel1g,4,Thu May 7 03:50:22 2015 UTC,"Correct but in this case, MTV chose not to air this version aswell."
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,Le0zel1g,3,Thu May 7 04:46:56 2015 UTC,I kind of remember that documentary you speak of. Aren't there at least a few clips floating around?
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,kCchief207,5,Thu May 7 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are. I think the documentary was to be called ""Deep Kick."""
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,steps_on_lego,18,Thu May 7 07:12:07 2015 UTC,OHM is the one time RHCP tried to do something different and artistically challenging and people hated it. Makes me sad because the album is actually really great.
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,like_buttah,8,Thu May 7 05:14:07 2015 UTC,Well... I love it.
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,DeputyFicus,7,Thu May 7 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"I learned it's generally well perceived by ""true"" RHCP fans. I'm starting to think the notion of people hating the album are those who haven't given it a chance.  Personally I think it's better than anything pre-BSSM but not as good as anything post BSSM (excluding  OHM itself obviously)"
RedHotChiliPeppers,354qgu,Steeveep32,6,Thu May 7 16:15:18 2015 UTC,Bullshit. If you think only one of their albums was artistically challenging then it's you that's not a true fan.

RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,Castiel333,39,Wed May 6 20:17:20 2015 UTC,As far as I know Chad writes all the lyrics
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,joliv192,12,Wed May 6 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"naw man, chad just sings... anthony drums and writes all the songs"
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,im-on-the-inside,18,Wed May 6 21:42:59 2015 UTC,Anthony definitely writes the majority of the lyrics
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,CrimsonThi9hs,7,Wed May 6 21:16:25 2015 UTC,It's mainly Anthony. John and Flea helped. I'm sure Flea still does help. No clue about Josh.
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,rhcp192837465,3,Wed May 6 23:41:20 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing an interview in the OHM era where anthony described the process as john would write some riff or make a whole song and anthony would bring his lyrics to it. And sometimes they would collaborate together to make the song, then chad would put some sort of beat together to fit in."
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,Asha108,2,Wed May 6 23:13:14 2015 UTC,read somewhere AK writes 95% of the lyrics.

RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,mclollolwub,0,Thu May 7 13:23:02 2015 UTC,Brain fart... sorry!
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,rambopr,2,Thu May 7 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"Its very possible that anthony's style of lyrics rubbed off on john over time, which could be why his solo stuff seems similar"
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,rambopr,1 point,Thu May 7 19:41:37 2015 UTC,I would guess about 90% of it is him I know flea helped and even wrote a few songs where he sings like pea I don't know if john or chad ever participated in the process of writing lyrics
RedHotChiliPeppers,353ih9,AvereyK,1 point,Thu May 7 13:24:25 2015 UTC,Educated guess here: besides ohm which was mostly written by flea anthony has written almost every lyric. John came up with the chorus for wet sand i think. Im sure hes come up with some other ones but nothing i know for sure
RedHotChiliPeppers,352ko4,miken2k10,12,Wed May 6 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"I remember an interview from 2011 which I found and transcribed quickly. Overall, everyone is cool I'd say.  ""I haven't talked to him in a little while, but our relationship has been very friendly and close and honest and good, and we're just really happy for John because he's doing what he wants to be doing with his life. We love him, and we're very grateful for the time we had with him being a great musician and friend and the kind of person that he is. He gave so much to our band and it was such a great experience having that time with him"" - Flea  ""I saw him recently at a concert in LA about a month ago and he looked very happy and it was really great to see him. I hadn't seen him in a long time, and he's just a really great guy, and we love him like Flea said. He's happy with what he's doing, and we're happy with what we're doing, so it's just a win-win for everybody right now."" - Chad"
RedHotChiliPeppers,352ko4,Kracker5000,3,Wed May 6 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"It might have been messy or it might not have been, but the party line the band seem to be keeping on is one of complete positivity. I'm sure there was hours of negativity and blow-ups and sadness (I remember hearing that the band reconvened in 2008 and John basically up and left at rehearsal, trying to get the band to go a certain way, never to return) but they're never going to discuss it. They know how lucky they were to have John and how much he did for them (and how much they did for him) so that's the only thing that matters now.  He taught Josh all of his guitar parts, so I don't think there's any bad blood there."

The playing just reminds me of whenever I'm feeling pissed off with a band or something and I just mess about with it without seriously impeding progress in the song.  I think ultimately those are the sounds of someone who's bored of playing on a song or with a band."

RedHotChiliPeppers,34xhqp,Rerellison,1 point,Wed May 6 02:27:03 2015 UTC,"I thought the bit in Scar Tissue was about the SNL appearance which was a bit of a train wreck, where John was skewing the rhythm and going strange on the intro. Then again it's been a while since I read it."

RedHotChiliPeppers,34yh0v,Rasengan2012,2,Wed May 6 02:43:29 2015 UTC,I think it was around the early 90s era... Just after Mothers Milk or BSSM... I could be wrong. But it was early-ish. I haven't read it for a few years

RedHotChiliPeppers,34yh0v,HereComesSunshine,4,Wed May 6 06:58:18 2015 UTC,"I think the years of herion left him without body fat and nothing but untrained muscles, and considering how active he is on stage I think it amounts to some of it.   But I've always wondered as well, that maybe he has some daily regime (not just to look good when he removes his shirt on stage as he and Flea still do) but to try and gain back some of the years he lost because of his addiction."
RedHotChiliPeppers,34yh0v,ChipChippersontss,3,Tue May 5 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've come to suspect that his addiction might not be as worse as it's been told all these years. I don't think Anthony ever got himself to John's level of addiction (in around 94 when he started loosing his teeth and looked like a skeleton) or Scott Weiland's. IMO, Anthony never had that drug addict look, and we've never seen Anthony lost that buff look in any period since the Chili's first album to date. For all we know, he could be just a casual user. It kind of reminds me of Axl's case, who was cast as a junkie in GNR hey day, but in reality, he was a health-conscious tea drinker who already stopped using drugs when the band became successful."
