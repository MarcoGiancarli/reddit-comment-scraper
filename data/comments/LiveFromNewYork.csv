LiveFromNewYork,3e4ql1,ttmp22,7,Wed Jul 22 00:53:36 2015 UTC,I think it's because people have incredibly high standards for celebrities.  I'm sure most people would find her attractive if they saw her on the street but because she's famous she gets dropped down a couple numbers on the scale.

Her standup is almost entirely made up of overly vulgar jokes that only get laughs because it's a pretty girl telling the jokes.   I had a lot of people tell me her show was very good, so I tried to watch it, and in fact, I binge watched an entire season, and I don't think I laughed once. I was absolutely horrified that The Ben Show was cancelled, while her show and the Jeselnik Offensive got second seasons."
LiveFromNewYork,3dr3og,jimtow28,-5,Sat Jul 18 21:55:56 2015 UTC,And yet anytime a male comedian makes vulgar jokes he's considered the funniest person alive. Yeah maybe she's to vulgar for some people but I feel like the second a woman makes a sex joke she's considered trashy.

The whole ""I'm such a whore that..."" act just isn't my cup of tea, I guess.  Like I said, I really tried to like her show. It just isn't funny at all IMO."
LiveFromNewYork,3dr3og,jimtow28,0,Sun Jul 19 03:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get you, everyone has their own preferences for comedy.

She's treated like some kind of modern goddess of comedy every week when she attempts political statements. She was right on the expiration date when female actors are considered no longer attractive. That was spot on but when she on about that hoax of a 78 cents on a dollar wage gap, she made herself part of the problem while she was praised by the propagandists that continue to spread that lie(please don't try to argue that it's real, it's not and you should know better, the 78 cent number is from the CENSUS and it does not in any way compare same job numbers, please don't, you'll lose). It wont be long until Amy get's a network writing job or a sitcom and she'll be irrelevant like Whitney Cummings and Sarah Silverman before her. Female comedians are cyclical like teen pop stars. They get love like crazy for a few years until something better comes along. Sure, they'll cling to fame but they'll never get back that moment when they were so loved by the pop media."

I remember last year Brooks Wheelan tweeted that he'd been fired before any offical annoucment. If I remember correctly, the other changes were announced much later even though I'm pretty sure they told Noel Wells and John Milhiser at the same time.

They need her to be the anchor of the show. So I would guess she has at least three seasons left but beyond that it gets questionable."
LiveFromNewYork,3d2igh,LiveFromNewYork95,4,Mon Jul 13 00:50:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think they force anyone to stay, do they? 3 years could mean a lot of missed opportunities for Kate. They'd let her leave for something big."
LiveFromNewYork,3d2igh,thecricketnerd,4,Mon Jul 13 15:15:52 2015 UTC,For the most part I guess Lorne has been understanding when people want to leave early (Samberg mentioned this in an interview around the time he left). But a contract is still a contract and if they want/need her there for the next three years than they have that right.
LiveFromNewYork,3d2igh,LiveFromNewYork95,2,Mon Jul 13 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"True, and she'd probably understand the importance having taken over the Hillary role. I assume they wouldn't do that if they weren't confident in her sticking around."

Lesley Jones in not too far behind in the one trick act either.  I was never a huge fan of Wig's work on SNL, but have enjoyed her in many of her films and I'm hoping this will remain the case here.  My biggest hope for this film is definitely Kate McKinnon as I've really enjoyed her work since she joined SNL.  Edit -  I was, and to an extent am still pissed off that this remake is happening.

Back in Amy's day, Hillary was more of an earnest politician waging a strong campaign for the Democratic primary and representing competence and intelligence for women in politics in contrast to Sarah Palin.  Now she's more of a power hungry person who feels entitled to the presidency."
LiveFromNewYork,3chykx,MadDogTannen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:15:16 2015 UTC,Kate's doing an impression AND character.

Hillary suggests ways to Kate to portray her accurately and they are all just stupidly nice and personable and electable portrayals. Every time Kate does something remotely funny, Hillary takes her off in a nice way and her mic or off-set camera catches her losing her shit."

Maybe dedicate a thread at the beginning of the month to decide what it will be? That way it gives people a chance to design a different snoo each month."
LiveFromNewYork,3cf9w5,pretty-in-pink,5,Tue Jul 7 15:21:37 2015 UTC,I like this idea and I think it works better than just having a plain Snoo.

If we changed it once a year however, or came up with 12 different Snoos to rotate throughout the year, that might be more realistic. I mean you have to think about the long run. Four years from now would be 48 Snoos, and I don't know how many would be easily identifiable."
LiveFromNewYork,3cf9w5,LaurelQuade,2,Tue Jul 7 17:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think 12 different ones would be best. Have a vote/poll/contest/whatever to pick 12 recognisable enough SNL characters, and cycle through them."

I was watching a few other Samurai sketches and I'm honestly suprised Buck didn't lose a hand with how close John swung that thing to him. The only time Buck got injured, he was standing directly behind John when he held the sword over his head to cut through a wall, so the tip of the sword hit him in the head. They played it off well but you could definitely tell he got hit."

LiveFromNewYork,3c81to,avedb,4,Mon Jul 6 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"It definitely got her fired. It was in her first episode and after it happened Lorne told her:   “I’m going to have to pull you back for a while… I don’t want to make a big deal of this, but I don’t want this to be the first thing people ask about or write about with you.”   So she was basically relegated to background roles in her first season.

In fact, the only withdrawal he was probably going through was not being able to get enough coke/heroin in his system during the show. It's really too bad; he cut himself down in his prime."

He was one of the most well-rounded, consistently funny cast members they've ever had. Incredibly talented, and he seemed like a good guy. Or at least I've never heard anything bad about him.   It's a shame that his work after SNL didn't seem to land, but I think some of that (The Master of Disguise) was designed specifically for children. The thing about movies for children, though, is that it's the parents who bring them, so you've really got to make the movie appeal to both.

LiveFromNewYork,3bx9h0,classicajays,10,Thu Jul 2 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"The world was less global then. You could do a sketch where somebody portrayed Muhammad and the odds that any of the relatively small number of people who might even consider taking violent action in response to that sort of thing would even hear about it was pretty low. Individual Muslims who happened to see the episode might have thought that it wasn't in good taste, but I'm guessing that the overlap between people who feel sincerely that Muhammad should not be depicted that way and people watching SNL in 1988 isn't super high. Futhermore, if you were a Muslim in America in 1988, that sketch probably would barely crack the top ten insensitive-to-Muslims things you encountered that week. That wasn't exactly a high point in terms of America not being kinda crappy about Muslims; a sketch depicting Muhammad in basically neutral terms would have been almost progressive."
LiveFromNewYork,3bx9h0,Daiteach,2,Fri Jul 3 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're definitely right about all of that.  I guess at the time, not only was the demographic different as to who was watching, but maybe those kinds of jokes were also still kind of acceptable to make at the time and by those who did watch SNL? Certain things I'm sure just weren't at the time (as I mentioned the nude beach sketch got complaints and sponsors pulled). I do have to say that I did find the sketch funny but I guess seeing how our world is nowadays and how much it has changed, it was just surprising that they could do that. That's kind of a feeling I've been having by going back and watching these old episodes anyways, it's pretty cool and interesting to see what they could and what was acceptable back then (though certain pop culture things does get confusing if you're not aware of what happened). Also the rest of that Tony Danza episode though, it was okay but not as good as most other eps from that season lol."

Obviously things got popular by word of mouth but it had to be really damn extraordinary, there wasn't a blog content industry dedicated to replaying stuff that happened last night.   I can think of sketches from as late as the early '00s that they would probably never do today, but they got away with then simply because no one was paying attention."

He was also going to be the Update Anchor but I wanted to go in a different way with update. Jim Carrey- The ""Will Ferrell""- lead in every sketch, very good impressionist. Has a ton of characters in his back pocket. Zach Galifianakis (Update)- The ""Kyle Mooney""- Dominates Ten-to-one land. He'd also make update his own. Rather than following the Seth Meyers model. Justin Timberlake- The ""Andy Samberg""- Makes loads of digital films, goofy impressionist. Dwayne Johnson- The ""Chris Farley""- physical comedy. Kills it in every live sketch. Kevin Kline- The ""Mike Myers""- knows how to make a ton of great characters. Also has surprising versatility.  Christopher Walken- The ""Tracey Morgan""- Is hardly in the show most weeks, and plays ""himself"" half the time. He also only ever writes the craziest character for himself to play.  Melissa McCarthy- ""Kristen Wiig"". Has so many characters. Rarely has a bad sketch.  Sarah Michelle Geller- The ""Jan Hooks""- fits into almost any sketch. Gwyneth Paltrow- The ""Ana Gastyer""- Very good impressionist with very good singing ability.    Edit: I forgot to add Christopher Walken."

Great as they all are, they'd end up filling half of everybody's list anyway. ;)   Joseph Gordon-Levitt - The popular ""face"" of the show, a la Ferrell or Carvey.  I can see him having the showmanship and range necessary to be in a lot of popular sketches and create a bunch of hit characters. Kevin Spacey - The ever-necessary ""glue"" in the vein of Hartman, Hader, or Aykroyd...not always front-and-center, but indispensable and up for any character type needed.  Killer impressionist on top of that. Steve Carell (Update anchor) - The understated but rock-solid professional, much like Parnell or Nealon (could see him taking Update in a Nealon-type direction too).  Can break out some surprisingly broad and laugh-out-loud material here and there, but often goes for subtle humor.  Great for dads, politicians, and game/talk show hosts alike! Drake - The ""black guy"" AND the ""Jewish guy""!  Really though, his enthusiasm and versatility would work out well, and he could fulfill a bit of the ""ethnically ambiguous"" role.  Lots of potential for a great range of impressions. Edward Norton - The Forte-esque weirdo.  Decent at impressions, but would otherwise be well-known for characters and premises that fully embrace the absurd, silly, and downright unsettling. Ben Affleck - The Fallon-style goofball, open to making a fool of/laughing at himself in any situation.  Could have a knack for over-the-top mannerisms, voices, and loose ""bro"" humor. Anna Kendrick - The cast showoff, i.e. Wiig or Rudolph.  Bold stage presence with a very distinct personality, and an excellent singing voice when needed.  Probably the go-to for most young woman characters. Christina Applegate - The sturdy straight-woman, in the style of Curtin, Bayer, or Gasteyer.  Not overly flashy, but able to play sexy or refined equally well with a killer deadpan style.  Ideal for mothers or other authority figures. Kerry Washington - The everywoman able to handle whatever is thrown at her, much like a Poehler or Hooks.  Can go loud and crazy, calm and biting, or anywhere in-between. Emma Stone - The sarcastic wiseass that can still play sweet when needed.  Could often go low-key, but get serious laughs out of some choice lines.  If necessary, can probably pull off a teenage boy."

It's impossible to explain why some entertainers are as beloved as they are, because it's always a perfect storm of culture and society. If you didn't experience him in his original context, you won't necessarily ""get"" him. I also think the in-your-face physicality of his humor gets in the way of some of the more subtle things he did. Most people remember Chris falling on tables and saying ""IN A VAN! DOWN BY THE RIVER!"" and think that's all he was and we've moved past that in comedy. But things like ""The Chris Farley Show"" and the Zagat's character he did with Sandler wouldn't be out of place on today's SNL. Honestly, I see a lot of what Chris did in Kyle Mooney's awkward characters.  I think his early SNL work, when he was just starting to get noticed, is some of the funniest I've seen. There really aren't that many cast members that break out the way he did. Sure, he had go-to schtick, but who doesn't? At the time, he was a very different kind of performer than we were used to on SNL. He was enormous, both physically and spiritually. He exploded off the screen."

Paris Hilton should be banned.  I don't even know what she's been doing these past years so I even doubt that they would even think of bringing her back, but from what Tina Fey had to say about her in that Howard Stern interview a few years ago, I'd say that she should be put on the banned list.

So in absense of any of those transgressions, we have to ban people for preference reasons.  Specifically, I'm banning Sarah Palin.  None of her appearances have been great and she only does it for PR.  Generically, I ban any combined musical act/host*.

LiveFromNewYork,3asn7t,mnemoniker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"It's probably mostly true for the first 5-6 years you started watching, which for most people overlaps with middle school. But there are some serious mitigating factors:   You're unlikely to claim any cast before you started watching as your favorite, due to inability to watch, plus outdated comedic sensibilities and cultural references. Everything about the show was fresh and novel when you started watching SNL, making it seem funnier. There are natural ebbs and flows to the quality each season and he only asks you to remember your favorite cast and ignore any middling casts over that hypothetical 5-6 year period. Everyone can think of one peak season within the first few seasons they started watching. Combined with the fact the show is new to you, there's a good chance that bumps it to ""best ever"" status for you.   I think what this really means is, the show reaches a peak about once every 5 years and the first peak cast you see is bound to be your favorite because of the nostalgia of being there when the show hit another peak."
LiveFromNewYork,3asn7t,artimusMaxpressure,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"I think there's some truth to it, but it's more often an excuse they pull when they go through 'down' periods where the writing is stale."
LiveFromNewYork,3asn7t,horsenbuggy,-13,Tue Jun 23 14:39:33 2015 UTC,So they need to write more clever jokes for adults. Stop writing for middle school kids. That's definitely my problem with the show.

LiveFromNewYork,3amgvm,Rapidity,32,Sun Jun 21 23:59:58 2015 UTC,"The Californians is a perfect comedy sketch for people who find that type of sketch funny. At its heart it is just an excuse for Hader, Wiig and Armison to try and do the most over-the-top accent they can and try not to laugh. Thats enough right there for me to love it.  But its the little things that make it special for me. How the furniture they sit on always changes. How much emotion there is in 'Get out of here, Devon!'. And most of all how Keenan will randomly pop up towards the end with a drink in hand and no lines.  Mr. Trey?!?"

The format is a winner. The idea could be funnier if it had gone deeper than just accents/soap opera but finding a subject well known enough to parody (Like ""Gone with the Wind."") is difficult to make into a recurring.  I think they hit a 9/10 for the slot they needed to fill with this one.     Personally, I need the comic relief of the traffic directions. It's inside humor. ..No pun intended for us LA shut-ins."

Also, I don't really know people from California at all so beyond the accent it was hard for me to tell what was parodying Californians, what was parodying soap operas, and what was just added in as jokes not intended to be parodies. That said, since watching the Californians, it seems like every time I hear someone from Californian, to include people on Reddit claiming to be Californians, they always find a way to name drop at least one road, which makes me think all the road directions are a semiaccurate parody."

Kyle Mooney, who's style of humour I like, really needs to take learn some new moves cause his ""eyebrows raised hand gesturing"" acting is becoming repetitive.  I almost quit watching SNL during Kristen Wiig's final 2 years cause she was so rammed down our throats I'd start gagging every time I'd see her. I now try to avoid movies with her in it cause of this.   Never ever cared for musical guests. For that reason I haven't watched the show live since the early 90's when I started recording it so that I can fast forward through musical acts and commercials. Then came Tivo or torrenting.  I started watching in 86-87. Apart from the popular sketches/commercial parodies I've seen on specials or online I have no interest from the inaugural season until about 84-85. Almost everything during that time frame feels extremely dated, unfunny or just plain strange. I don't really care all that much about the original cast either."

It was a transition year, 100%, and a lot of different cast members got lost in the shuffle (O'Brien, Wheelan and Wells come to mind). Wheelan was a pretty middle-of-the-road type of performer - he could do stand up bits on update and could pull out some VERY 'white trash' esque characters (his Kid Rock comes to mind?), and kind of had a grisled thing going on what would have been really cool to see more explored, but the dynamic of the cast plus the size of the cast made him get lost in the shuffle.   In his stand up act, he also talked about how he felt going through SNL, apparently a lot of what he wrote he felt wasn't 100% going to fit with the show it was.   Overall, though, I feel like there just wasn't enough differentiation from other performers for him to break through, which is really unfortunate because he would have done real well as stepping into straight-guy roles and adding some ""white trash"" appeal into the show."

I don't even care if it doesn't always have me on the floor laughing, I think I'm just mostly impressed at the sheer scale and effort. I've not been watching for too long (since S39 but watched 34-40), so I dunno if in a few years I'll fall a bit out of love with it, but for the last two years it's been hands down my favourite show.

Maybe not this season or next but in a few years snl will seriously need some Asian, Hispanic, and in general ""brown"" cast members if they want to stay relevant.

They write what that group talks about and tries to make them laugh. Some of the sketches aren't funny but you can see how if you write sketches and you're around people who do also, then it would be funny.  I live in the Midwest. There is so much stuff to make fun that regular Americans encounter and would laugh at yet it goes completely untapped in SNL.  Last night I saw the rerun was of the Blake Sheldon episode. I remember thinking that they almost came close to going out of the bubble due to all the country sketches and jokes. It took seeing them do country to reveal the bubble/rut they're normally stuck in. There's plenty of 'regular America' non-big city stuff that isn't country.  At first I didn't like the Mike O'Brien stuff but now I like it. I didn't get it at first. His stuff draws from outside the bubble."

LiveFromNewYork,3amgvm,imjustbettr,5,Sun Jun 21 18:42:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more and what's frustrating is that comedy is a powerful tool. It's like the court jester and the king--you can get away with saying things to power you normally can't just come out and say.  SNL doesn't really say anything. It's just goofy situations or characters for a few minutes at a time. It doesn't have teeth or an edge. (It's probably due to being owned and controlled by NBC, a large corporation. The large corporation I work for seeks to be as inoffensive and neutral as possible.)  Even with the presidential candidates for example, it doesn't actually consider what the candidates are about or explore the consequences of what they push or say anything about them, it just makes fun of the people and their quirks. I watched some Mr. Show and the difference is glaring. It's not even a matter of being able to do a continuous 30 minutes versus having to stop for a commercial every 5 or so.  It's like AAAHHHH! Come on guys! There is so much to make fun of. Make fun of uppity middle class white baby boomers, shitty parents, selfish people, college professors and students nowadays, religion, local government-types, tea parties, environmentalists/health food people, anti-vaccine people, creationists, snobs of all sorts--beer, wine, organic, there are infinite varieties of stupid and ignorant people, banks, car salesmen, racists, sexists, feminists, governments of bad states, crappy tour guides, confederate flags, present seriously absurd and bizarre and obviously wrong science and engineering stuff, job interviews, CORPORATE TRAINING VIDEOS/HR so hard. The videos my company's HR department makes are about 95% the way to being 20+ minute SNL sketches and it's totally unintentional. You wouldn't believe how funny videos of actors seriously saying offensive things to each other are. All of this is simple too--just one sketch don't need to develop characters that can be played fifty times either so you can work in the lesser players who need face time."

I just watch his sketches and I think ""Okay really, what the fuck am I missing here?"" I have a love/hate feeling for late 90s SNL. I hate it because of the oversaturation of recurring characters and the way that they were shoved down our throats so goddamn much (And they were the worst kind of recurring characters too - obnoxious, trying-to-hard, and way too energetic without being that funny). On the other hand, late 90s SNL was responsible for some of the absolute best non-recurring sketches that I've ever seen.  I don't like Norm MacDonald on SNL. There, I said it. Outside of SNL, he's okay but on SNL...he just didn't do anything for me.  Jan Hooks was the greatest female SNL cast member of all-time and I'm including Gilda Radner (though she's a close second) Ana Gasteyer and Tim Meadows are two of the most underrated cast members of all time.

LiveFromNewYork,3amgvm,nyluhe,2,Mon Jun 22 13:58:40 2015 UTC,Exactly. That was the end of the run.  It wasn't effective to continually break character with the SFX because the audience had grown so FOND of the character. The 4th wall reveal just came off like embarrassed gay hate by Hader.  No idea if this is true IRL. Don't care. It hurt the character by playing against type for no other reason.
LiveFromNewYork,3amgvm,phtll,12,Mon Jun 22 14:39:02 2015 UTC,"The drop in quality from Season 39 to 40 is so staggering, I'm pretty much done with the show.  The cast at the end of S39 was way too large, so they fired three cast members and lost one. That's ok, now we're back on track. But then by episode 3 of S40, they've added two cast members, and replaced Cecily as Weekend Update anchor with someone completely new, putting them right back to the problem they had with cast size.  Brooks Wheelan is hilarious and it's a shame they fired him before he had the chance to stretch his wings on the show. He wasn't a great performer, but he could have killed the 10 to 1 timeslot or the ""Let's just have someone do their stand up bit on Update"" spot, but they fired him. Didn't even bring him back as a writer like they did with Tim Robinson. They also just brought in Pete Davidson to have that exact role (who, imo, is an even weaker performer and stand up than Brooks). Now he has to work from the ground up, instead of letting Brooks work on the show with an entire year under his belt.  Go back and watch some S38 - S39 episodes, or any previous episodes really, and there's a buzz in the air about the show. It's hard to explain (kind if like right before a big rain and lightening storm is about to happen, you can just feel the electricityin the air), but there's this feeling of, ""There's a lot of nervous energy and the feeling like this could fall apart at any moment and that's what makes this exciting"". But with S40, it's gone. I don't think it's from the loss of Don Pardo, I think it's the crowds. It feels like it's full of early 20 somethings who grew up watching highlights of the show on YouTube. So when anything remotely exciting (of gif worthy) happens, there's this huge howl of cringeworthy woos and claps that emerge. But anything less than that, and there's this feeling of cross-armed, unenthusiastic, unimpressed, awkward silence from them."

Awful characters (what the FUCK is the Leather Man supposed to be?), constant breaking which ruined the good ones (cowbell) and made no sense during the bad ones (aquarium repairmen), and second only to Jost in the ranking of bland Update anchors. Kenan Thompson should have left about five years ago. His ""re-acks"" (for all you Delocated fans) are massively overrated and bog down sketches rather than help them. The SNL Archives site says he has done 117 impressions, but all I can recall is a slightly louder impression of himself in various wigs. Political cold opens are poison. SNL's ""we attack both sides"" policy means that these sketches will never have any bite to them past ""look at this impression"". They only ever get interesting when something as ridiculous and fortuitous as a wacky vice presidential candidate that looks like a legendary former cast member enters the political arena. Kristen Wiig should have left after 4 years. After that, her schtick got very old, very fast. I don't get Martin Short.

What's up with that just seemed to be Keenan sweating his balls off and going over the top with the character - what's so funny about that? Nasim just annoyed the crap out of me. Her impressions were terrible and her characters were awful.  But that's just my opinion.  EDIT: Another one!

The only 2 I loved out of the original cast was Gilda and Belushi. Love Bill Murray too. But, he came in during Season 2.   Oh, and I totally agree with the hate for the musical guests.

They are obviously both wildly hilarious and successful comedians, but the two of them together behind the desk did not work for me and I think that they both had much better chemistry with their other WU partners.  A big part of this was due to Amy's inexperience at delivering jokes in the WU style, and by the time she got better at it, Tina had left SNL.

Too bad they don't have someone exactly like Brooks Wheelan or John Mulaney on the show.  As for writers, they need to lighten up. I miss the silly sketches.

Right now, them, Kenan and Jay are the only 'traditional' SNL guys (some can argue for Beck but he has a vibe that isn't really traditional to sketch comedy). I love having young, fresh comedic perspectives, but I think it's important to keep a few jacks-of-all-trades around who can play Prince Charming in a princess sketch or a deadbeat Dad or a lazy senator.  Keep everyone in the cast right now onboard as much as possible - I have a feeling Vanessa may leave, but otherwise the rest of the cast seems pretty stable and I think the dynamic is working for them. Update is getting MUCH better, and as long as it continues to head upward I see no reason for them to change much of that.  Retool the musical performances - Try one song out, maybe, opposed to two, or have one longer segment for music opposed to two. Even, move the second musical segment around because sometimes it feels way too late and I just want to get my last sketch in, you know?  Take more political slant on cold opens. Find something for Obama to do. Jays impression is fantastic. Work with something - I want more bite to my cold opens and I feel like they're dumbing down some stuff they could be really intensifying. Sure, some weeks are filled with football scandals but, honestly, find some serious political footing ground and run with it. Allow ONE recurring sketch per episode.  Seriously, one is fine. One."
LiveFromNewYork,3apvv4,confettiqueen,3,Wed Jun 24 04:43:44 2015 UTC,"You gotta do something about the Update Desk. I think both Che and Jost are good (well much improved in Jost's case) but they just don't work well together. The chemistry just isn't there. So you pick one and ditch the other basically. Then you bring in someone else as co-anchor. I vote Leslie Jones mostly because her chemistry is Jost is amazing but I'd understand if they don't use her. And that is only if they keep Jost over Che. I'd promote Beck and Kyle. They need to decide something with Sasheer. She's shown some flashes here and there but it seems like she doesn't get enough star time. She gets enough time, but not enough to really stand out that much. I'd keep her for another season and promote her but I'd understand if they don't.  They need a writing staff that isn't as lazy. There's some writers in the show that are pretty good and have some solid ideas or somehow manage to take a shitty idea and make it good. However, there's still like remnants of seasons past out there who still get their shit aired. Likely one of Lorne's Favorites.  There are three type of episodes that I expect a bunch of cameos in episodes -- Christmas episode, season finale, and former cast member hosted episodes. The latter is a recent thing where it seems that the episodes are basically just cast reunion episodes where their former cast mates come on and join in on the fun, which leaves a lot of the regular cast in the dust (which I always felt bad for). Anyways I'd either like to cut down on that or maybe do something once a year where you pick a cast era and you try to pull off a cast reunion episode proper. You have someone who hosted frequently in that era and you just do sketches and such from that time period along. Do it every first weekend of April as an April Fools Day episode. It'd get people watching."
LiveFromNewYork,3apvv4,pineyfusion,4,Tue Jun 23 17:18:30 2015 UTC,"I'd overhaul the opening monologue. It really has been the laziest part of the show for many years now. I think I read that they usually throw it together late in the week, and it shows. For something that's at the top of the show, it shouldn't be the least funny thing of the night. No more falling back on audience Q&As, host-sings-a-song, etc unless it's a really funny concept. I'd also dedicate some writers strictly to the monologue.   I'd also retool Update a little bit. I'm not a big Jost & Che fan, but I think it'd be a mistake to change the anchors so soon. One of the problems these days with Update is Jon Stewart does the format better, and has the benefit of doing a week's worth of shows before SNL can comment on a news story... since he's retiring (and who knows how the new guy will be), Update should be a little more aggressive with the format. We saw some of it this past year, going beyond just reading a headline and a punchline. We need more of that - more commentary, being more aggressive and not playing it so safe.  I'd get a new announcer - I love Darrell Hammond, but he doesn't have a high enough energy. I'd definitely keep him around to be Bill Clinton during the election, but we need someone new to announce.   I'd also like to see some of the reoccurring sketches take more chances. For example, Girlfriends Talk Show and The Pornstars are funny, but are pretty much the same thing every time. Let's see the characters do something else, or at least change the format a little - things like Cecily's weirdo boyfriend or the host coming in the Pornstars ""did you say ____?"" are getting old. If you watch the early days of SNL, some of the big sketches only happened a couple of times. We're not as bad as the Kristen Wiig era with repeating, but some stuff still gets driven into the ground."

But Lifetime movies are entertaining in their own way, and I enjoyed it for that. (Lifetime movies are a guilty pleasure of mine.)  I won't say the movie is 100% straight drama, though. There's one intentionally humorous moment, right at the very end, and I laughed long and hard at it. It made the whole movie worth it.

LiveFromNewYork,3anclw,Ozzdo,2,Mon Jun 22 02:26:58 2015 UTC,That is a great synopsis of the movie. It was great in all of the wrong ways. If you were looking for a Skarknado movie this wasn't it but I still found it hilarious.

LiveFromNewYork,3anclw,AgentPeggyCarter,11,Sun Jun 21 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"It was every Lifetime movie cliché thrown into one film. If I were Stefan, I would say: ""Lifetime's hottest movie is ""A Deadly Adoption."" Starring Will Farrell and Kristen Wiig, this movie has everything. Plot twists, feathered hair, a book tour, diabetes.""   Seriously though, it's worth a watch if you enjoy ridiculous Lifetime movies."
LiveFromNewYork,3anclw,kcaio,2,Mon Jun 22 00:02:11 2015 UTC,I watched for the bench. The bench was great. I’m a little bias though because my son built the bench.
LiveFromNewYork,3anclw,boardmonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:18:34 2015 UTC,"I thought that it was hilarious.  Yes they played it straight, but over did it several times.  The movie had just about every plot twist you could come up with, and then a few more.  The script was so bad it was farcical.  It was a perfect Lifetime movie, just amped up a few notches.  We tried to avoid any press or social media about the movie, and went in with only the knowledge of who was acting.  It was fun to try to figure out who did what, and who was lying to who.   Normally we are really good at it, but because of the absurdity of this movie we had no idea what was coming next.  Overall I think it was a success.  Probably the biggest boost in ratings Lifetime has ever seen, and deservedly so.  You can tell Lifetime let them do the movie their way, and you can tell that the writer, actors, and production staff had a good time really focusing on what makes a good Lifetime movie.  I'll watch it again, and I kind of hope it makes it to DVD."

LiveFromNewYork,3aj0t3,fatdogrollingover,2,Sat Jun 20 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"I watched it last night. It was ok, good for a Saturday night movie when you just have nothing else. It started to feel like a long form SNL skit after a while, and even the shooting style/directing felt very SNL skit like"

LiveFromNewYork,3ag8k2,dragonsky,8,Fri Jun 19 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that Ira Glass and Sarah Koenig aren't that ""Famous"" to the general public.  Fred A's impression of Ira Glass, to this day, for some reason makes me laugh harder than any other impression I have ever heard.  For anyone who doesn't know, This american life is a podcast/radio show where the host, Ira Glass, Does three stories on a topic. Here is a spectacular segment/story Dan Savage told a ""Live"" episode of the radioshow.  Also, Check out Dan if you don't know his podcast, Savage love.   I'd like to see This American Life do a follow up to the Doppelgängers  episode and talk to Cecily.  It's just unfortunate that you can't do these impressions on SNL because the average us citizen doesn't know them.   Here's the episode of This American Life.    For Fred's impression, listen to the intro of the episode. It's only about three minutes and you'll laugh really hard."
