Go into bootloader mode (google that for your model). Download a minimal version of adb and fastboot on pc. Assuming you're using windows, go into the folder where you downloaded and extracted adb.exe and fastboot/mfastboot.exe. Use shift+ right click in the folder (don't do this on the actual files, click in an empty space) and open a command prompt from the directory. Plug your phone into the PC. Download the recovery of your choice (preferrably TWRP, CWM works too) in the folder where adb.exe is and flash it by writing ""adb flash recovery.img"" (rename ""recovery"" with the filename of the recovery). Go into the recovery and do a full wipe of the device. Delete everything. Flash another ROM and its dependencies.   Tell me if this worked."

I don't have experience with Moto G 1st gen troubleshooting since I own a 2nd gen, but what you have to do is no different.   Download a .zip file of stock Lollipop ROM (Not Kitkat, since I've heard it sucks on Moto G). While in bootloader mode, you need to write some commands in command prompt so the ROM will be flashed. Once done flashing, do a normal boot and go through the intial setup. If you wish, now you can leave your ROM stock or reflash a new one.   Ninja edit: Take care when downloading the right .zip. Choose your phone model properly, otherwise you might end up with broken radios and that means calls and messages will be fucked up."

MotoG,3e3ye3,thekillerman01,2,Tue Jul 21 22:27:31 2015 UTC,On a first gen Moto G its really easy if you buy it with the frame etc.. All you need is a T5 screw driver and some tweezers.. If you just want to replace the LCD its a different story.. There are a few tutorials on YouTube :) search 'Moto G speaker replacement' for the best video I've seen on it

The videos I have seen said that a heat gun was needed to separate the glass from the screen.  Apparently, it's the trickiest part of the whole operation.  If you buy the entire front assembly, you just have to plug in the cables and put in the screws.  Of course, if the glass had any scratches or wear, it makes sense to get the new glass too.  I notice like a really light ""smudge"" in the middle of my glass where I swipe up and down, so I would replace them both if I broke either.  I don't think the difference in price is great.  Two of the most common sources are ebay and aliexpress - these will give you an idea of prices, even if you don't buy there.  They even sell them on amazon.  You'll have to check and see what works best for you in the UK.  Apple products are usually notoriously difficult to repair - the Moto G repair will be easy.  Just take your time and be careful.  Make sure you have the right tools and don't force anything."

I do however miss the old music app ""Apollo"" that came with older cm ROMs  So in my opinion aosp is the most stable and smooth by far although cm12.1 is a close second as it is almost as stable and has a few extra features. Blisspop was a bit too feature packed for me and I didn't understand what half the options were for but if you want to experiment and if there is a more stable build available by all means go for it."

AOSPA-L = Hybrid between a pure stock experience and CM12, niche features and OTA support, but it suffers the same problem as SlimLP. AOSP (pure) = Stable, no bloat, and customizable with some xposed modules. The lack of RRO support is the only downside of this rom.

I did use CM12, it was fast and stable on 12.1 but it doesn't support notification ticker anymore with Xposed so I wanted another ROM that can enable a notification ticker. Beeeto's CM12.1 build where fine and faster then regular CM12.1 vrrdions  but there is a bug that hides the SuperSu icon so you can't access it.   I did run CM12.1 based roms like Blisspop, AICP and Euphoria. They were a tad slower then pure CM12.1 build, but you have many features. They do sometimes have annoying bugs/problems: if you open recents apps scree  on BlissPop then you have an ugly BlissPop icon on the background, on AICP the battery icon is misaligned and it hasn't been fixed in over a month, and Euphora makes your phone a bit hot, the keyboard's spacebar doesn't register all of your touches sometimes, and sometimes you can't answer your calls.  PA ran nice but lacks heavily in features, no customization of Quick Settings, not even with Gravitybox.  Now I'm running SlimRom, an AOSP based ROM and it's running okay, not as fast as other ROMs but I don't have the best battery life with it. It does have a notification ticker option build in, which is nice, and I use Xposed for the features I'm missing. But it does have a bug if you use the Quick Settings with the ''4 tiles per row'' option. If you enable that option it doesn't display a part of your WiFi name. Also no landscape rotation option.  Sadly there's no recent pure AOSP rom available for the Moto G 4G.  The torch also doens't have it's full light density in custom roms (aside from Beeeto's CM builds) so that's a bit annoying too.  I'm curious if stock Moto ROM merges the fixes of 5.1.1. If that's the casew I think it would be the fastest ROM aside from CM build or Paranoid. But I also like to have the latest version of Android."

MotoG,3dxmso,Guad12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:21:17 2015 UTC,That normally happens when you try to downgrade. GPT.bin and motoboot should fail to flash if you're trying to downgrade; prevent a hardbrick. As long as all the other commands are flashing successfully you'll be fine. You have the GPE? Since only that version has 5.1 as of today. You won't benefit much from 5.1 as multitasking if worse on GPE 5.1; ZRAM is disabled by default.  BUT GPT.bin is needed if you are converting to GPE since it needs data to be formatted in EXT4. The way I did it was to flash the latest TWRP on XDA and format data to EXT4 and go back to the bootloader and flash boot and the 4 sparsechunks and reboot. Good luck.
MotoG,3dxmso,Sgt_George,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:57 2015 UTC,The file that i have is GPE_5.1_XT1032_LMY47M.M001_CFC.xml.zip which i have tried to install earlier but fucked something up while doing it. When i try to reinstall i get the error in the post.

MotoG,3dv6h9,scottishhusky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"Minimalist homescreens are what's up.   Pro Tip: Nova allows for blank or [space] folder names and you can set a transparent PNG as an icon, thus allowing for invisible folders. I actually have periods as the folder names so I can find the damn things if I accidentally move them, but it still keeps them fairly out-of-sight. Meanwhile I have one-click access to my favorite apps, and I set up the folders to launch my most frequent apps with up-swipes.  The nice thing about having some apps in hidden folders on my homescreen is that after I hide them and file other apps away to folders, my app drawer is kept pretty neat despite the fact that I have 103 user apps installed."

Whenever someone requires a confirmation email, it goes to the Yahoo account. Gmail is for correspondence, email that I actually care about, and only given to people who I know. Unsurprisingly, notifications for Yahoo are disabled, and Gmail are active.    The 3rd is the native email application, which is linked to the Outlook Exchange address for where I'm working over the summer. Once that job is done, I'll be removing that, and promoting another app to that dock slot. Not sure which one though, I don't really use any social media.

MotoG,3dvarf,_CitationX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:57 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow XT1072 user! I managed to root my 1072 (somehow) ages ago, using a tutorial which I can only really find if I dig deep into my browsing history.   Oh, and before we continue, do ensure that in the Android Settings, in 'Developer Options', tap 'Enable OEM unlock'.  I'm not too sure where I found my fastboot drivers, but I installed them quite a while back when trying to root my Venue 8 3840. I was able to install them for my 1072 through device manager when it wasn't being recognized through    fastboot devices    and so when installed, I was able to proceed.  I got the get_unlock_data from inside the command prompt, went onto that Motorola unlock bootloader website and got my code, and  was able to unlock my bootloader.  Yeah, from there it's pretty easy sailing and I just followed this tutorial (I'm sure?) - (http://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g-2014/general/guide-root-moto-g-2nd-gen-2014-t2874245) to install the custom recovery to then install the SuperSU (Root).   For some reason the XT1072 wasn't a hugely modded device out of all of the Moto Gs which kinda put me down but eh, on the bright side it's possible to root this thing, unlock the bootloader and even install a custom CM ROM.  I'm sorry, I'm tired right now. If you're confused, reply and I'll be more than happy to write you up a detailed guide of how I done it tomorrow morning GMT. :P"

MotoG,3dt86f,yonghuilum,5,Sun Jul 19 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"""Having Root"" isn't inherently a risky thing, no more than running virtually any software on any machine. But, if you don't feel you completely understand it, and/or you don't actually want to run any apps that require it, you might as well disable it. It's not doing anything passively, though.  What is an inherently risky thing is granting root privileges. Rooting an android device comes with a gatekeeper application such as SuperSU or SuperUser, which by default will prompt you to approve/deny when an app wants to execute something it needs root for. If you grant an app root access, you're trusting it to only do what it says it will do.  ""Having root"" has very much been the standard security level on Windows for a long time. If you passively click through the administrator popups when something wants to install, you could very well be installing malware of any sort, pretending to be something else. Conversely, if you work somewhere with an IT department, they may have disabled users from granting any of those permissions, because people can and will mess it up. Smartphones have basically come to be set up in much the same way by default.  Banking apps, and other things that are security-sensitive, tend to check for root and refuse to run if they find it. They're basically doing this under the assumption that people can't be trusted to manage root responsibly, which to be fair is true enough at large."

We've talked a lot about leaks and specifications but now we have the final performance from a store, FNAC, which has published the ad buying this model with their features, some so good that we wonder if it will have been a failure but the rest are sufficiently viable to have much hope.  Motorola Moto G 2015: Leaked specifications and price in FNAC  According to this model we have a processor quad-core 1.7 gigahertz , a substantial increase from the 1.2 that had the previous model. Besides the RAM up to 2GB while the screen remain five inches but this time increases the resolution until the 1920 × 1080 px , ie, full HD.  The internal memory is maintained that even if we will have 8 GB micro SD card up to 128 GB maximum size.  Besides the usual supports for Bluetooth 4.0, GPS with AGPS or FM radio noted that weighs 149 grams and measures 141.5 x 70.7 shall x 11 mm.  But one aspect that has caught our attention is negatively battery, which apparently will be 2070 mAh , somewhat low for a screen resolution and climbing on climbing on processor power.  Motorola Moto G 2015: Leaked specifications and price in FNAC  To finish outlining the features we see that has support LTE, which will be able to use the 4G network operators in addition to carrying the latest version of Android, the 5.1 Lollipop .  Please check the missing megapixel cameras but these data are perhaps the least variables when you consider that all leaks are betting on 13 Mpx in the rear and 5 in the front.  But as always, the best of this model is its price and that is set to € 199 , a cost more than interesting considering what it gives us. We can and we will book it within 15 days informs us anywhere."

I just recently bought a Moto G 2nd gen (XT1068) for my birthday to replace my shitty Gingerbread Samsung.  Upon receiving the package, everything was in French (box, documentation, and phone language). The phone's image on the box is definitely running KitKat. The same goes for the manual (the manual from Motorola's website shows a Moto G running Lollipop).  One thing I immediately noticed upon booting it up (besides it already running Lollipop) was it sent me straight to the home screen/lock screen. None of the usual ""quick setup guide.""  Then this French SMS message popped up (as translated in the screenshot). From doing a little research, it would appear that the unit came from this online store ""http://boutique.orange.fr/mobile"" or at least has some connection to it.  Other than those three, everything seems to be untouched. The actual phone looks to be in mint condition. Apps give you their little tutorials on how to use them. I haven't experienced any issue at all.  What do you guys think the case is here? Is it supposed to run Lollipop out of the box? Were they just kind enough (I doubt it) to update it for me? Did they test the phone over there hence the French SMS message?  Sorry for that long post. I would really appreciate your opinions regarding this."

MotoG,3dgyvc,Optimuminimum,-7,Thu Jul 16 19:01:03 2015 UTC,SD 61x and 2 gb sound good enough for a new Moto G upgrade if the price still right. But what about battery size and display? Less than 300 ppi is not good enough  anymore for midrange. Should be minimal 1080p now for midrange and 720p for lowrange like next Moto E.   Perhaps I'll keep on using my Peregrine longer untill Sep/Okt when two new Nexus phones arrive. Certainly if new G has still 720p. Longer reading text is not enjoyable anymore on resolution under 300 ppi after using my tablet with higher resolution.

MotoG,3dbqf2,yonghuilum,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:55:27 2015 UTC,On mobile at the moment but it was some random guy on YouTube with a heavy accent. Basically I had to unlock the device from the Motorola website. Then I installed a new recovery image(?) Then I used that to install a cm12 zip file. It actually went well but it will wipe your device when you unlock your bootloader. So you need a backup.

I think the Moto E covers the lower end well enough to move the G a little more upmarket.  The Moto X would still have a clear advantage in materials, CPU and picture taking, so I don't think a higher end G would cut into it too much.  $150-$300-$500 is a pretty reasonable pricing/feature distribution."

Anyway, 410 is kinda low end in capabilities (same general level of performance as 2 year old high-end chips) but it's perfectly capable for a non-gaming phone. Still, 1GB of RAM is absolutely crippling. Fortunately, new info says they have a 2GB model ready, but it's still not clear if it'll be a best buy phone, depends entirely on the pricing. If they can keep the 2GB model on par with the current 3G model, then I'll consider it, but if they go beyond 250$ there's plenty of better specced phones in that range."

MotoG,3d851h,legba,2,Tue Jul 14 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's just so much wasted potential. I feel that Motorola finally got back on the right track with the Moto X/G/E series, but they are crippled by their illogical marketing and business decisions. Retaining specs for two generations was bad enough, but at least with Moto G1 -> Moto G2 you had the benefit of a larger screen, stereo speakers and a better camera. What are they offering now? A slightly better camera and a slight redesign with the same 3 year old specs? Come on! Someone in Motorola needs to pull their head out of their ass. And it wouldn't even be such an issue if the software worked like it's supposed to, but that's obviously not the case. They simply CAN'T make Lollipop work like it's supposed to on 1GB of ram. What will happen with Android M, which they will be obligated to bring to this platform in the next year? Disastrous decision, if it's true."

MotoG,3d8ggk,CMDR_FabeCraft,3,Tue Jul 14 09:16:30 2015 UTC,"Well buddy, I just rooted my phone 2 weeks ago and I have never looked back. I'm currently running on CM12.1.  Sure the battery life is only slightly better, and the software is not final and stable yet, but I think the improvements are   1.better performance. The system UI crashes sometimes but generally, the phone is smoother than it was on stock. At least the transitions are better and the apps work faster, even tho its just a little.    More tweaks. There are many little things that you can change in the settings that I feel would enhance your overall user experience. I flash a stock rom just a few days ago and the lack of customisation got me a little uneasy.    Well, that's how I felt about rooting and flashing! Choosing to void your warranty is your choice, and only yours to make. Good luck with your phone buddy! :)"

MotoG,3d17id,cairojack,2,Sun Jul 12 17:55:52 2015 UTC,Your superuser app should have an option for complete unroot. It'll remove root and you can apply the update again. You will have to reroot the device afterwards if you want to regain root access.
MotoG,3d17id,boschrick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"I unrooted (SuperSU) and rebooted and tried the install again, it still failed. I am guessing it is the unlocked boot loader?"
MotoG,3d17id,yaconsult,0,Sun Jul 12 20:26:32 2015 UTC,"The OTA doesn't care if the bootloader is locked or unlocked.  It requires two things - a stock rom and a stock bootloader.  If you installed twrp or cwm as a bootloader than the OTA will not install.  If the rom is modified by something like xposed framework, a factory reset will fix that.  But if you have a different bootloader, you need to find and install the original bootloader before you can OTA."

MotoG,3d219a,ads8888,6,Sun Jul 12 21:59:06 2015 UTC,"Have you actually ever used a camera phone from the mid-00s? I seriously doubt it. The video quality of the Moto G isn't great compared to current high-end smartphones, but it is in a completely different league compared to old camera phones.  Also, objectively, the quality in the video you linked to seems decent. Exposure could be better, but eh...  For reference, here is an actual mid-00s (2005) phone video sample. Also, here's an iPhone 3G S (2009) sample. Just to put things into perspective. The ""horrible"" Moto G camera blows away these older cameras."

MotoG,3d219a,TheUltraEvil,3,Mon Jul 13 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's not crisp/sharp and the exposure fluctuates. Also it is slow at refocusing. The fact that the video is 720p on an 8mp lense is a pretty good indication it isn't intended to be very good. That said, its good enough for just casual videos and better than what is offered by most devices in the same price range. Only high end phones really offer anything that is actually good quality."

MotoG,3d0sdf,MetalGearLink,3,Sun Jul 12 15:43:50 2015 UTC,I don't see much difference between 4.4 and 5.0.2. In my opinion tbey work equally good/bad. It seems that only 5.1 seems to be a really improvement in terms of speed but it is not available for my 2nd gen Moto G.  If you can only upgrade to 5.0.2 then I would just wait until 5.1 is available.

MotoG,3d0sdf,TheUltraEvil,2,Mon Jul 13 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course there are differences, but all in all not much has changed. The general UI and the workflow is basically unchanged.

MotoG,3d0sdf,TheUltraEvil,2,Mon Jul 13 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"""Earthshattering"" means 50% faster or 50% longer battery time. Lollipop is basically an evolution of kitkat but nothing completely new.  Yes, there are small changes overall but in total is is just a evolution and not a revolution.  I have kitkat on a moto g1 and lollipop on a moto g2. Both versions have it's pro and cons but in the end I don't really care which version I use. They look a bit different but the workflow, the performance and the battery life are very similar so I don't see any pressure to upgrade.  But if the rumours are true then 5.1 will offer a much better multitasking experience so I will most likely upgrade the Moto G1 from 4.4 to 5.1. but as long only 5.0 is available for me personally there is just no reason to upgrade."

Lollipop (that being 5.1) fixed those issues and the phone responds a tad faster in all situations as well (likely because everything uses ART now).  Little improvements I appreciated more than I thought I would (like having a flashlight in the notifications drawer, estimated time till battery drained and till battery charged, nicer phone app).  The phone was odd for a bit after the update (Google Play Services needed updated... yet wouldn't update... yet this problem resolved itself in 15 minutes... odd) but worked perfectly fine after.  Upgrading from anything to anything always has some risk (usually insignificant) so you should always do backups of valuable files and expect to do a phone reset if things are not working right.

MotoG,3csyrm,CJMom,2,Fri Jul 10 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"Well, The problem with low storage device is that they run very slow when you have no space left. I would say uninstall unnecessary apps, move all your media to SD card Also, check on Options -> Apps -> Running which apps taking too much ram from your phone. on a side note, yes, Dailer and Chrome are slower than on kitkat but not so dramatically like you describe.  ofc If all fails, factory reset."

MotoG,3csyrm,thechink,3,Fri Jul 10 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"I shall give you three choices:    Facebook Lite. It is most probably not available in the Play Store for you, so you'll have to search for it on the internet. APKMirror is the most trusted source around here.  Tinfoil for Facebook. It is basically a web browser which displays the web layout of Facebook, but in a sandboxed state, so that noone can spy on you via cookies.  Screw everything, and access Facebook on Chrome (if it works now) or a lightweight web browser of your choice. I personally use UltimateBrowserProject, which is in my eyes the optimal browser choice. It is also not available in the Play Store, look it up on the XDA developers forums instead."

MotoG,3cn3af,yaconsult,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:20 2015 UTC,"""32GB limit"" is usually a lie for legal reasons. Larger capacities are ""officially"" ExFAT, and that is Microsoft's format.  Instead of dealing with Microsoft or whatever (paying royalties, licensing, etc) they just say that their product works with ""up to 32 GB"" - as 32GB and lower capacities are supported with regular FAT by the SD Association. Yes, that is the official SD card standard, set by an association. Nothing is stopping you from formatting larger capacities with FAT32, but it isn't sanctioned by the SD Association. Anyone selling official SD cards or SD compatible products has to stick to the documented standards.  So those 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB SD cards? There is a good chance that they work JUST FINE in any device that supports ""only"" 32 GB."

It's useful to clear the cache once in a while to get rid of the junk data by apps you barely use.   If you do it daily you're constantly clearing the cache of apps you use daily.

MotoG,3cn3af,Xaguta,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:27:40 2015 UTC,"problem is, if all your available space is the cache, it means by deleting it to free up space you garantee that it'll fill up in a day again, but also you're effectively reducing your cache space and your apps are going to start crapping up soon.

We can hope that the retail firmware was an important milestone for the Cricket one, but there's really no way of knowing where in the pipeline it is until an announcement is made. Probably bouncing back and forth between someone at Cricket and Motorola getting ""tested"" some more.  Just to be clear though, the firmware that just launched for most XT1045's is not the one that your phone is waiting on."

In exchange for the paltry subsidy, you get little or no prospects of OS updates, a locked down boot loader, hotspot and tethering disabled, and the resale value goes down.   Really amazing that it's 2015, and OS updates for Android are still so dodgy sans a Nexus device."

MotoG,3cr4gq,TemiTemoy,2,Fri Jul 10 02:40:10 2015 UTC,"5.1 has been released for most versions of the 4g model, and from what I hear, it's pretty great. Android M will probably be available for it, since it's not going to be as big of a change as 5.x was. Also, it should be a lot less buggy  than lollipop was initially, since they seem to be focusing on fixing what they messed up in lollipop with it. If that's the case, updates shouldn't take as long to propagate down the line. Of course, this is mostly speculation.  As far as flashing things, I'm sure the stuff you're looking for is probably available if you get a version with an unlockable bootloader, though I don't know if GPe is much of a thing anymore."

It still works, but it's a pain in the arse doing all these different methods. No idea what's wrong.   I might just stop honestly. Thanks for your help though. If you don't mind me asking one last thing. If I've unlocked the bootloader, and tried to modify the recovery but it appears to still be stock recovery, does that mean I can receive OTA updates as usual? Motorola states I need to have stock ROM and recovery, and if recovery doesn't appear to be modified with CWM, does that mean I can update as normal? Thanks again."
MotoG,3cnzfy,yaconsult,2,Fri Jul 10 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, errors when flashing are not cool.  You do have a retail version of the phone, right?  Are you sure the bootloader is unlocked?  I have the extended reboot options enabled, so when I hold the power button to turn it off and choose Reboot, I can then choose between Reboot, Soft Reboot, Recovery, and Bootloader.  Choosing Bootloader boots into fastboot.  Choosing Recovery boots into twrp.  Yes, the standard answer is that the stock recovery and stock rom are both required for OTA update.  But, there are also other possible issues.  I use xposed and gravitybox.  I believe that some people have said that the OTA will fail if xposed is installed because of the code it modifies when it loads at boot.  So I would think that a factory reset would be wise to insure a good update.  I am not ready to update yet, so I haven't faced it."

MotoG,3ci6gy,quoyleforpresident,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:47:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your suggestion. Weirdly, after battery life was draining super fast at first, it started levelling off a bit. After the past two days keeping a eye on battery I'd say it has about 70% of its previous battery life when still running on KitKat, which is still a nuisance. Lollipop is a pain, you can't even turn off vibrate when on silent mode anymore :( Phone was buzzing so loudly in the library earlier.   I've cleared the cache partition to see if it helps. I don't know that much about smartphones, so even with your advice I'm worried that I'll misunderstand what I'm doing and brick my phone if I try the downgrade. I'm just too worried I'd be a useless noob and f**k it up"
MotoG,3ci6gy,Haduken2g,0,Fri Jul 10 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"A good part of the redditors on this subreddit who tried to revert to KitKat ended up with a perma bricked device, don't attempt that. Keep Lollipop, it's objectively great."

That said, ""Keep Lollipop, it's objectively great"", is the opposite of a helpful response to my question. It's not that ""objectively great"" to have your phone losing battery alarmingly fast and have no options, especially since I have to use my phone for work and am already in financial difficulty."
MotoG,3ci6gy,Haduken2g,2,Wed Jul 8 17:23:20 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why this is happening to you. Battery life has taken a very small hit on my device if any, and the device now feels much faster and much more responsive. Multitasking and RAM management have been improved too, the keyboard is also way faster for me. Not to mention I have never seen a ""This Application has stopped unexpectedly"" ever since Lollipop had been on my phone. However, to achieve this level of stability I had to delete the cache partition and do a factory reset. Have you tried doing that? It's apparently very effective according to the Moto G community - and I can vouch it's been in my specific case. P.S.: I'm on 5.0.2, which is a lot worse and less stable than 5.1, so in theory your phone should be working a lot better than mine, and mine's alright. P.S. 2 for the downvote: Take a quick glance at the AOSP changelog from KitKat to 5.1, from 5.0 to 5.1 alone there are 1400+ bugfixes, from KitKat to Lollipop there are even more. Compare KitKat benchmarks to Lollipop's also. It's as objective as it gets."

Check out /r/androidgaming I'm a gamer, but I don't play a whole lot of games on my phone. Currently, I only have Blendoku, 4 Pics 1 Word, and Crossy Road installed. 2. You'll need an OTG connector to connect a ps3 controller, but you'll also need to be rooted to use it wirelessly. 3. Not sure what games support it, but if you're into emulation and retro games, they definitely support controllers.     Movies: 1. I personally use Netflix, but I think there's an app called Popcorn Time that allows you to stream movies for free. 2.

Crossy Road is like Frogger, but it it's a endless running game, meaning there's no end.    4 Pics 1 Word gives you 4 pictures and you have to guess what the topic is by looking at the pictures.    Blendoku is blending colors together to solve puzzles.    My personal apps are things like banking or shopping.    That's just how the app works, there's no way around that with a PS3 controller.

I have been very happy with the Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Case for Motorola Moto G that I bought from amazon.  I like that it has cutouts for all the buttons so that they have the same feel as when not using the case.  However, I bought a white one last year and over time dirt became impregnated into the plastic just from normal handling.  This didn't look very nice as the areas  where your fingers most often contact the case became darker.  Recently, I bought a replacement case of the same model but in a black color figuring that this will not develop any discoloring.  Comparing the new case to the old one, they may have also changed the formulation of the plastic.  I'm very happy with the new black one on my white xt1045 and think it was worth the $8.50.  It provides some protection without adding a lot of bulk to the phone or affecting the feel of the buttons.

Yep, you won't see any ""SD card"" anymore, since the internal 8GBs AND the SD card will merge into a whopping 40GB total memory. Unrestricted. No more moving to SD card, no hassle. The pain is over. It will be practically like having a 40GB phone with non expandable storage... Except the sd card is in theory a tiny bit slower (I still cannot tell, and I have tens of Apps there) and... If you remove the SD card you'll get some negative effects, and that card can't leave your phone or be read by other devices until it's formatted back to being a normal SD card. If you are used to putting it in your friend's phone to transfer some data and then back in yours you just can't do it anymore."

This means that the wait is over if you have a retail edition, i.e. if you go to system->about phone and read where it says ""System version"", it says ""21.11.56.peregrine_retus.retus.en.US"". If so, you should get the update anytime between now and the next few days, regardless of your carrier.

Before in 4.4.4, the keyboard kept disappearing, frequent launcher redraws, etc. In 5.1 these are not happening. But yes, 5.1 has a memory leak problem, which Google fixed in 5.1.1. This doesn't matter if you have a Moto G though."
MotoG,3cebsh,TheUltraEvil,2,Tue Jul 7 09:32:50 2015 UTC,"I don't understand.  If you follow the link above, google confirms that version 5.1 has: Issue 159738, ""Memory leak still present on Android 5.1,""  Do you have information that this is fixed in Motorola's 5.1?  Or are you just saying that you haven't encountered it yourself yet?  Kitkat released on the Moto g never had a memory leak.  People who were rooted used programs like Kernel Adiutor to tweak the multitasking settings if they wanted to because the default settings were to give lots of memory to the foreground application and aggressively terminate background applications.  It was just a setting, not a ""leak"" or a ""bug"".  But if you weren't rooted, you couldn't do anything about it.  Motorola apparently chose different default minfree settings for lollipop."
MotoG,3cebsh,TheUltraEvil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"I mean that multitasking in 5.1 is much more faster than in 4.4.4 in the case of Moto G. In 4.4.4 multitasking was impossible. Because, in 4.4.4 they changed the minfree settings in such a way that multitasking was made impossible. in 5.1 they chose different settings, hence, for me, 5.1 has no memory leak problems. And, kitkat release on the moto g has a memory leak issue, atleast for non-rooted users like me, who can't change minfree settings."
MotoG,3cebsh,_FluX23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:35:37 2015 UTC,I think Moto fixed that in their 5.1 update.

It was basically impossible to do multitasking before with KitKat, background apps kept crashing. It's all working fine now, but a shame Motorola couldn't fix this problem earlier."
MotoG,3cebsh,BitingChaos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:12:02 2015 UTC,"Well, Android 5.1 for the Moto G LTE was built in June 2015, whereas Android 5.1.1 for something like the Nexus 5 was built in March, 2015.  The x.x.# updates may not be significant for any non-Nexus device. 5.1.1 for the Nexus line was released to fix issues with 5.1. Since those fixes existed by the time 5.1 was built for other devices, they were probably (hopefully) also rolled into the 5.1 build."
MotoG,3cebsh,TheUltraEvil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"You can't have 5.1.1 features/bugfixes on 5.1. I don't think OEMs can fix the memory leak present in 5.0-5.1. TBH, I really don't mind 5.1.1 now. 5.1 fixed all my Moto G's memory management issues."
MotoG,3cebsh,Mr_pessimister,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"So you are saying that you find 5.1 ""good enough""?  That while it may still have a memory issue, it's not frequently noticable?

MotoG,3cebsh,TheUltraEvil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:06:52 2015 UTC,That's not true. HTC has rolled future features into older Android versions. Also plenty of manufacturers released versions of 5.0 and 5.1 with memory leaks fixed. Google issues are strictly AOSP on Nexus devices.

Anyway, with my normal usage I can reach the 20-24 hours unplugged. The screen use is about 3 and half hours, but In KitKat I'd reached even 5 hours of screen.  For everything else, I am satisfied with Lollipop (5.1).  P.S: Now, Google Play Services usually drain about 15% of the battery."

MotoG,3cbd34,Haduken2g,2,Mon Jul 6 19:37:28 2015 UTC,I have only positive things to say about it! I would recommend but its your own choice! But it switches from dalvik runtime to art which should speed up your phone.
MotoG,3cbd34,coolbeaNs92,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice from someone who updated about 2 weeks ago...   If you're running a custom ROM and are really happy with your current set-up, then don't do it.   If you're someone who doesn't get involved in any customising or ROM's/rooting, then do it. Lollipop is a really nice looking ROM and has some much improved features.   I won't lie though, I have noticed issues. However, I've been informed today that factory resting is resolves pretty much all of the lag/slow performance issues people experience.  The only noticeable lag is really on phone-dial and in Chrome. Everything else performs the same if not better.   I would recommend upgrading, despite the slight niggles I've had with it."
MotoG,3cbd34,Haduken2g,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"Phone dial is very smooth for me. Heck, I even play with the dialer a lot just to see all those sexy smooth animation a lot. Chrome...

MotoG,3cbd34,Haduken2g,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:35:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, another thing. I've seen on YouTube videos that the LTE variants of both gens Moto Gs appear to be slighly less reactive than their 3G counterparts - and the XT1071 benchmarking worse than the XT1068 says it all. Also, if you look closely, you'll notice 2015 Moto Es with lower res and faster chips have stuttering issues, and users are complaning about those a lot. We don't get 3fps slowdown while turning pages on our GNL, right? I suspect Motorola is slowing down certain devices on purpose. A local tech reviewer that I trust a lot (they are like the most followed blog in my country) says he found the 2013 Moto E much more reactive. And if he says this, I have a reason to start to get worried. Just put it here, an OT."
MotoG,3cbd34,coolbeaNs92,2,Wed Jul 8 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"Would make a lot of sense to be honest.   There are a lot of phones I'm interested in that will probably be coming up in the Black Friday specials. I hear the LG G3 is rumoured to be coming out at £150 in the UK.   Still happy with my Moto G XT1039, but Motorola haven't done enough on the next gens to stop me from upgrading, when lot's of other top quality phones will be coming down in price soon."

MotoG,3cbd34,Alkath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:43:17 2015 UTC,My homescreen :) Launcher I use is Nova Launcher Icon Pack is Moonshine Widgets are Zooper Widget Pro
MotoG,3cbd34,Alkath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:24:11 2015 UTC,"Heh, I like that your system clock is on 24hour time but your widget prints it in 12hour. I guess I sort of do the same thing in my head since I set my digital clocks to 24 but I never say it out loud that way. Just funny to see it contrasted like that in one place."
MotoG,3cbd34,G33K_5QU4D,2,Mon Jul 6 22:59:45 2015 UTC,Haha yeah I considered changing it but I realised that the widget shows how I would say it like you said and I like that I can read it straight off and understand it.

MotoG,3cea9o,TheSlayer703,2,Tue Jul 7 06:09:11 2015 UTC,I have it too.  Hint: The update will probably be never...  That plus the ununlockable bootloader and memory management crap issues is getting me to plop it on eBay..
MotoG,3cea9o,etechgeek24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:20:46 2015 UTC,The ram is whats killing me. I could live without every thing else as long as the ram was managed nicely.
MotoG,3cea9o,etechgeek24,2,Tue Jul 7 06:23:03 2015 UTC,"The Moto helpchat said there will be no timeline whatsoever but it will definitely be updated. I don't know how much I can believe that, but att updated a gen 1 Moto x, so there's maybe a small amount of hope?"
