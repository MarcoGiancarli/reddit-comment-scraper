It has a lot less emotional impact if you don't understand why, say, X and Y characters looking alike is going to be a big deal in the future."

KingdomHearts,3e38ft,snazzysnorlax,4,Tue Jul 21 16:49:33 2015 UTC,"I think the ""Sora gains the power of Kingdom Hearts"" idea is a pretty good one, I've seen it a couple times on this sub and I can imagine it happening.  Based on the final boss battles of KH 1 and 2 we can see that Square will absolutely have Xehanort have some sort of ship or something you fight on a massive scale, but the final phase of the Xemnas fight was a more scaled back 2-on-1 battle so we might get something like that as well in 3."
KingdomHearts,3e38ft,UmanTheInimitable,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:53 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for a 3 v 1 Sora riku and kairi vs xehanort
KingdomHearts,3e38ft,thederpyguide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:54 2015 UTC,That would definitely be cool.  If they put Kairi in a good fight or have her do anything really cool that's like a point added to the score of the game for me right there.
KingdomHearts,3e41ac,VonFrank,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:47 2015 UTC,"This is a mod for an older 2D sprite game called Little Fighter 2. I put this mod together a few years ago and thought I would post it here on the KH reddit in the off chance someoeoby might take an interest in it. It's not too fancy, but a lot of work has gone into it and it can be fun to play occasionally, especially with friends.  The Youtube video has a full description of the game's features and also includes the download link and a few troubleshooting tips if you have difficulty installing it."

It's the best method to get all those details in there."

KingdomHearts,3e29sy,-JI,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:23 2015 UTC,Yea. I kinda liked the anime/shaded graphics of the other games. This one is trying to mix in a weird sense of realism in order to use the graphics of the PS4 to the fullest extent.
KingdomHearts,3e29sy,pspiq5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:25 2015 UTC,"A little bit. That happened with a lot of games this last generation, especially those that used Unreal Engine 3.  Isn't KH3 being done using Unreal Engine 4? They finally got rid of that weird skin rendering in it. It has some more... texture to it now. I think by the time Kingdom Hearts III is out, it'll look better."

The less-vibrant, unfamiliar costume coupled with an entirely different haircut on Sora made him look like someone else. I wish they had kept him looking the same to keep some form of visual continuity across the new engine."
KingdomHearts,3e29sy,alianov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"You do have to think about sora growing up you know that right? His hair when he had his kh2 costume on was going insane in the E3 trailer if you look at his lower right picture, he needed that hair cut, also the new costume looks sick imo, it's so they can use him to do more parkour and all that jazz"

But either way, here's what I gotta say now:  ""I’m changing him [Donald] out first chance I get""  Now you understand  ""Maybe I came into the area underpowered, or maybe I’m just bad at this game (it’s the latter)""  This made me laugh way harder than it should have.  Not because you're bad, but because we've all been there first time playing through this series  ""was treated to a scene where a very angsty Cloud (is there any other kind?)""  No. No there's not.  ""I will say this about Deep Jungle — it’s nice to get a bit more story exposition than in previous worlds""  Just you wait...  ""For reasons unbeknownst to me, Clayton was attached to a giant iguana""  Not saying you're wrong, but it's totes a chameleon  ""If you’ve made it through my sodium-filled post, I appreciate it.""  I appreciate it, too! These are great and I can't wait to read part 4!!  ""Here’s hoping I can make a bit more progress in my next session.""  Dude, you beat 2 worlds in 3 hours.  That's awesome! You're not slacking at all, and again, I love following along with your thoughts of the game.  Please keep these going.  They're definitely a highlight of this sub.

So apparently there's some way other companies can play around with a galaxy far, far away.  Personally, I'd rather them not try to cram Star Wars into KH, but the possibility will always be there.  edit: Crediting the wrong company, though it's still not EA. Source."
KingdomHearts,3e2hno,Sea-Salt,2,Tue Jul 21 13:32:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true. I agree with you though, I don't real want Star Wars (or Marvel for that matter) to be in KH"
KingdomHearts,3e2hno,heart-station,0,Tue Jul 21 13:35:00 2015 UTC,"Activision has nothing to do with Infinity.   That being said, there is also Lego Star Wars and a number of other companies with access to the IP."

They released the Android port of The Complete Saga this year and The Yoda Chronicles in 2013 so clearly there's some wiggle room. Furthermore, Bandai Namco is making Star Wars Battle Pod, and Uprising is in development from Kabam. The point is, if they want Star Wars in Kingdom Hearts, they can bloody well put Star Wars in Kingdom Hearts."
KingdomHearts,3e2hno,Liraxus,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:51 2015 UTC,There's other companies making Star Wars games other than EA. They don't have any rights other than Battlefront.

The guy's a great actor, but he can really only pull off a loud, yelling Genie, and even then you can hear Homer Simpson leaking through.  On the flip side, James Arnold Taylor does a very believable Jack Sparrow. There was even a time when my mom was passing by as I was playing, and asked if they had gotten Johnny Depp and the rest of the Pirates gang for this before telling her that they'd probably be too expensive.  Christopher Lee sounds like he was having a bit of fun as Ansem the Wise, and it's a real shame he won't be able to reprise the role for KH III."

I mean, she's really good with her combat dialogue, but her delivery of her other lines are kind of flat. It's like the voice director told her ""Aqua is a stoic, disciplined young woman, go with that"", and she comes off very stiff because of it. She has a ""pretty"" voice though, which is why I think a lot of people look at her favorably.  Best: Leonard Nimoy because he sounded like he was having a blast being a villain or Jesse McCartney because ""Shut up!"".  Worst: Any scene where laughing is involved. The BBS scene in particular was cringeworthy since it sounded like they asked each actor to laugh once and repeated the same sound-clip 10 times. Goofy gets a free pass though; I love you man."

KingdomHearts,3e0916,Phresh_Prince,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"The memorial Ultimania does a pretty succinct job of explaining the differences between the types of Kingdom Hearts, so I'll let that speak for itself:   Kingdom Hearts  A condensed form of the hearts of this world.  Also known as the kingdom of hearts or the center of worlds.  It also is the source of great power and a source of endless knowledge. In the past, people viewed Kingdom Hearts as a great heart of light and seeking to gain control of this ended up causing the outbreak of a war that destroyed the world (Refer to P.8).  Because of such an incident, Kingdom Hearts is now strictly sealed away and it is not easily approachable.  Master Xehanort among other dark forces use all kinds of tactics to obtain Kingdom Hearts, but Sora is always there to fight and stop them.  Kingdom Hearts of Worlds (KH1 Kingdom Hearts)  The condensed form of the Hearts of Worlds known as Kingdom Hearts.  The path to this Kingdom Hearts can only be open using the Keyblade of People’s Hearts created from the Seven Princesses of Heart.  In KH1, Maleficent and Ansem used the Heartless to steal the Hearts of Worlds and sought out the Kingdom Hearts of Worlds.  Kingdom Hearts of People (KH2, 3D Kingdom Hearts)  The condensed form of the hearts of people becoming a Kingdom Hearts.  Organization XIII believed that completing this would make them whole again and began collecting hearts from the Heartless in order to create the Kingdom Hearts of People.  The leader of Organization XIII had a different plan as he intended on using the Kingdom Hearts of People in order to implant the heart of Xehanort into the members as vessels to create the 13 of Dark (Reference P.9).  The incomplete Kingdom Hearts of People floated above Organization XIII’s castle.  True Kingdom Hearts (BbS, 3D Kingdom Hearts)  Different from the two man-made Kingdom Hearts above, this Kingdom Hearts has existed since the beginning of the world.  It was engulfed in darkness long, long ago during the Keyblade War, but using its counterpart: the χ-Blade, it is thought that the True Kingdom Hearts will once again be revealed.  Master Xehanort’s goal is to acquire the χ-Blade and open the True Kingdom Hearts to bring about a new Keyblade War."

KingdomHearts,3e11zr,EonsCombine,4,Tue Jul 21 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you basically played the series backwards in order of creation.  358/2 and BBS were both created AFTER KH1 and KH2, but are the backstories to KH2 and KH1, so it makes sense that they're more fleshed out to give context and expand the meanings of the characters' actions in the earlier KH1 and KH2.  CoM is similar in that it is the prequel to KH2 and the direct sequel to KH1; once again very story-based because it's the formal introduction of the Organisation.  The earlier games in the series don't have better stories because they are less established than the later (or even sequel/prequel) games because they are the context on which the sequel/prequel games are based.  It's just coincidence that you happened to play all of them first, and then the context.  Context always seems boring in retrospect."

KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,PhillipOlliverholes,24,Sun Jul 19 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to plot this out as coherently as I can.  ULTRA MEGA SPOILERS I GUESS!!        Ventus's heart gets torn apart by Xehanort and he then brings him to Destiny Islands to let Ventus die.       At Destiny Islands Ventus is seen in that glass mosaic place (his heart) and is met by a new heart traveling to its new body (Sora as a baby). Soras heart senses that Ventus's heart is missing a piece and is going to die so he offers to fill the void with his own light from his heart.       This begins the connection that they will have forever. (hence why Venitas looks like Sora but with black hair).       When Venitas and Ventus are destroyed Ventus's heart cant take back the dark heart that Venitas had so I'm only assuming that it was just destroyed. However as Ventus was falling into the darkness Soras part of his heart called back out to Sora (becuase they now shared a heart) and Ventus's heart travelled back into Soras heart.       So now Ventus's heart lives inside of Sora and for the same reason that Venitas looks like Sora, Roxas looks like Ventus.       This can also explain Axels strong relationship with Roxas as Lea and Ventus formed a strong relationship.      EDIT: I also just want to say becuase I didn't mention it before and I want to make it clear, Ventus/Roxas (I'm counting appearance as seperate people even though Roxas and Sora are essentially the same person just the difference in heart and soul and who owns what in that regard) and Sora are two different people. They do not look the same (or at least they are not supposed to).     Please correct me if you think I'm wrong."
KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,RedPapaSmurf1,7,Sun Jul 19 22:33:22 2015 UTC,Lea and Ventus formed a strong relationship.   Didn't they only see each other for like five minutes?
KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,fifbiff,7,Mon Jul 20 03:00:21 2015 UTC,"They meet each other in radiant garden and begin sparring in a cutscene and they fade out on that so it leaves you to assume time passed. How much time of course is impossible to gauge, but a bond was created between them much like the way Sora is able to make lasting impressions on everyone he meets no matter how long they meet for. Edit: If you downvote me I would love to see why. This is my favorite game series of all time and I would really hate to be wrong about something in it. Edit2: Alright so I must have short term memory loss because what I said before about how the cutscene plays out was wrong however in that cutscene Lea Literally says ""After all, we're friends now."" and that he wants to live in people's memories. So I guess you could say that Axel remembers or recognizes Roxas and sees him as a friend becuase of his previous connection with Lea."

Vanitas was created by the split clearly before Sora's heart merged with Ventus'. Even if this is explained somehow, what did Vanitas look like before Sora's heart merged with Ventus'?

KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,Hero0fHyrule,4,Sun Jul 19 21:35:21 2015 UTC,"OK so let me answer this one, so remember the very first dive to the heart we experienced? Well it was at that moment that ventus was slain, he called out and sora called back, sora as a child gave up a part of his heart to ventus forever linking them together. So when Roxas comes along you see ventus in soras nobody because the nobody takes the former of the strongest heart in the vessel and since sora gave up part of his to ventus, ventus also did the same after he was slain, but this allowed for ventus's own energy per say to be transferred into sora allowing sora to wild the key blade, it was the only way by which sora would have been able to since aqua performed the transference ceremony with kairi, and Terra with riku, ventus was not yet a master so he wouldn't have been able to. Now as far as the nobody is concerned it takes ventus's form, for ventus was chosen by they key blade, but soras heart or consciousness because ultimately sora grew into the strongest by aid of ventus, so soras personality dominates the nobody, when they mention ""him"" it all depends on which member you are talking about, some knew ventus or their heart forms knew ventus, some knew sora but ultimately the people see who they knew since there are multiple hearts in the same shell, same goes for xemnas, ansem, terra."
KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,KizziV,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the Keyblade Sora used passed over from Riku (further from Tera) since Riku fell to darkness? Cause during the boss battle in KH2FM you fight Tera and he questions why Sora is the one with the keyblade instead of Riku  So it wouldn't be because of Ventus that he could use the Keyblade, but because of Riku/Tera. However, it would explain why Sora and Roxas are able to use 2 keyblades at once since Sora has 2 hearts in him."

KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,KizziV,3,Mon Jul 20 01:29:09 2015 UTC,Ventus has nothing to do with Sora having a keyblade      Ventus's heart lives inside of Sora True       Sora has a keyblade becuase of Ventus False      Sora has a keyblade because Riku got anxious to get out and explore other worlds and turned his heart to darkness in order to do so even though he was already so close to finally recieveing his Keyblade that was passed to him from Terra. By turning to darkness the Keyblade he was to recieved moved on to the next heart with the strongest light eg. Sora. This is entirely the reason that in KHI Riku is able to summon the Keyblade that Sora was literally holding in his hands. That keyblade is and was Riku's until Sora became strong enough (of heart) to finally keep it as his own. I'm actually not to sure about that last sentence so please correct me.
KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,RedPapaSmurf1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:57:19 2015 UTC,well sora has an EXTRA keyblade because of ventus if i feel like being technical
KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,leigonlord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:26:44 2015 UTC,That only happens because of Roxas's experiences as a Nobody. Somebody in one of the comments above explained that way better than I could.

KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,KizziV,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:29:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly not trying to be a jerk, but the keyblade is in fact Terra's keyblade. You are right that Ventus gave him the ability to wield it initially because he was within his heart, but the actual keyblade isn't Sora's because of Ventus, it's because Riku gave into darkness and it went to Sora.   Wiki for source  This is also why Roxas and Sora were able to use a keyblade at the same time while Sora was in Castle Oblivion and Roxas was running around in 358/2. Roxas had Ventus' keyblade while Sora had his own/Terra's."
KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,TechnoShift,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"You pass the ability to weild Keyblades down, not the actual Keyblade. Sora and Roxas are both using Sora's Keyblade at the same time, this is confirmed."

Kinda like that"
KingdomHearts,3dvfj0,HaouLeo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:27 2015 UTC,"(SPOILER-Y AF, PLS BE AWARE)  Let's think back to BBS for a minute. Before Sora was born, his Heart gave Ventus the opportunity to become strong, allowing him to come back from the amnesia given to him by Xehanort when he took the darkness (Vanitas) out of Ventus. All of this happened before Sora was born, so keep this in mind. Sora's Heart remained in Ventus the duration of KH: BBS until Sora was born, theoretically, so thus Sora took on the image of Vanitas. And, no, before you think too far ahead, I'm not saying Sora is evil. That's just the image Sora got from being within Ventus after Vanitas was removed. Before BBS was over, Sora was born and in turn had the ability to manifest a Keyblade like Ventus. Sora allowing Ventus to take his before-birth Heart made a connection between Sora and Ventus. (Same with Terra/Riku, except Terra gave Riku the ritual and Aqua/Kairi, except there was no ritual. Lame.) Ventus' Heart then took refuge within Sora for the duration of KHI and CoM. Of course, after KHI, Sora had been within the Realm of Darkness then had been taken by DiZ and Namine, the image Sora had seen of Kairi in his own Heart (which is hinted to be taken from the moment when Kairi, being one of the 7 Princesses of Light, gave Sora back his ""Sora"" form at the end of KHI.), and had been put to sleep for a year. In this year, Roxas had been ""released from Sora"" and had joined forces with the OXIII because of his Keyblade-weilding abilities. Roxas takes on the form of Ventus because Roxas is the Nobody of Sora. Sora has Ventus' Heart still taking refuge within him.  Roxas had gone through the events of 358/2 Days and the intro to KHII, which roughly equal out to one year (365 days), inevitably going back into Sora so his portion of KHII could take place after the intro to Axel x Roxas (lol) could take place to give backstory on the two's friendship and the tutorial, natually. God, I'm sorry for putting so much info in there and I hope I hadn't repeated what anyone else said. I hope I was of service! I'm in a kind of lazy mood rn to read so I just decided to type this up in case there was some info you were still curious aboot. :P"

In KH2FM, the 60fps patch screws with the game's gravity system and increases the fall speed of all objects in the game. It makes air combos very hard to pull off and knock-back dealt to enemies is completely altered from what it typically is."

The solution is to save (in a new slot to be safe) nearby (e.g at the Cavern: Nook) and swap to the original Japanese iso. When you load up the game again, your saves should still be there. Beat Ursula, save again, and you can swap back to the English iso.  Hope this helps!  Also, you may have issues where the explosive urchins around Atlantica are untargetable too. And when you face Oogie Boogie in Halloween Town where the fight won't start properly. This same solution should fix these too."

I feel like Axel or Kairi are the perfect characters for the tutorial crap that will happen in the beginning because Riku and Sora are masters and badass.

KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,praisethemagicconch,8,Sun Jul 19 01:52:54 2015 UTC,I hate that mini-game soooo much.
KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,Bob423,7,Sun Jul 19 04:07:17 2015 UTC,This is the best minigame in the entire series.
KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,Unforgettawha,4,Sun Jul 19 05:56:25 2015 UTC,did you need 2500 for the max reward?
KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,96363,3,Sun Jul 19 16:27:54 2015 UTC,Yes. I got it the next try but I still have the last 2 songs to go.
KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,jayjay275,3,Sun Jul 19 16:54:50 2015 UTC,Yet to play this for the trophies..

KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,GreyouTT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:03 2015 UTC,Just wait till you need to break 3000.  Also finish the Desinty Island song ASAP or else you'll find your timing all out of whack for the rest of the mini-game.
KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,HaouLeo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:31:03 2015 UTC,Is Destiny Islands the really slow one? That song is a timing wrecker
KingdomHearts,3dsn6d,GreyouTT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:17 2015 UTC,Yeah it's the slow one. And I am pretty sure it's the reason people hate the mini-game so much.

KingdomHearts,3dud1z,Procake,3,Sun Jul 19 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"Nice to see you enjoyed the game! However, moving on to chain of memories can be a bit confusing due to the game play changes. But there are many guides that fans have made to help people with this game. Then 2 on wards they do not have the same problem."
KingdomHearts,3dud1z,starsaber,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:39 2015 UTC,I remember playing the GBA game when I was maybe 10 years old and not really knowing what the fuck I was doing. If I have trouble I'll look it up this time haha.
KingdomHearts,3dud1z,starsaber,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:55:55 2015 UTC,yeah thats what happened to me the first time. I guess its the curse of that game.

KingdomHearts,3dud1z,bobguy117,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:58:15 2015 UTC,"Playing KH2 before Chain of Memories has its benefits. Going into 2 without knowing the events of that game only makes you as confused as every other character in the game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing on your first playthrough."
KingdomHearts,3dud1z,bobguy117,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"But definitely play Chain of Memories at some point, the story is phenomenal and exceptionally dark for Kingdom Hearts standards, also the combat is a ton of fun if you make the most use out of it. (Hint: spam Triangle instead of X)"
KingdomHearts,3dud1z,MableDONKEY,0,Mon Jul 20 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"Chain of Memories is basically an important recap of the first game. Every world is the same, but the important parts are in between worlds. It's important to know what happens in this game to not be confused in the next. Beware."
KingdomHearts,3dud1z,Enanoide,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:01 2015 UTC,Important recap of the old game   Only the disney worlds. The Original stuff in KHCOM is super important

KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,StickmanSham,3,Sun Jul 19 04:29:21 2015 UTC,That picture looks fuzzy as hell.
KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,izzyv1990,2,Sun Jul 19 02:38:55 2015 UTC,I like to use alot of bloom and fxaa. Most people think it looks blurry but I really like it. That's probably what you're seeing.
KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,izzyv1990,0,Sun Jul 19 06:08:00 2015 UTC,"Hm, dunno, everything from the character model and world model to the HUD looks fuzzy, like when you stretch out an image to a size its not meant to be. :/"
KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,VonFrank,3,Sun Jul 19 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"Because the resolution being displayed might be 3072x2682, but the textures in the game are still at whatever low resolution they were made in for the PS2.  Thats the difference between up-scaling the PS2 versions on PCSX2, and playing the HD remixes on PS3. SE actually took the time to enhance many (not all) of the textures for the Remixes, which you wont be able to take advantage of no matter how high of a resolution you render the old PS2 versions."
KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,MableDONKEY,2,Sun Jul 19 03:37:15 2015 UTC,Exactly. The original game was actually build from the ground up because they lost the original files. They even took the Sora model from 3D because that was the latest model they had and it would've been too much work to make a new one.
KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,TheDalekCaan,2,Sun Jul 19 03:47:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. I just enjoy messing with emulators. :P
KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,Smirking_Greek_God,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"Is there some sort of post-processing thing you're using there? It looks blurry.  I'm currently playing through the first Kingdom Hearts on PCSX2 as well, and it looks waaay better."
KingdomHearts,3dsqq4,Kupoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"I played through KH1 on an older laptop that ran at about the same processing power as an actual PS2, and then played KH2 on my newer gamespecs laptop and the graphics on KH2 blew me away.    Now that I've seen this picture I went back to run KH1 on my new laptop and DAMN IT IS REALLY PRETTY."
KingdomHearts,3drlcm,neosporify,6,Sat Jul 18 19:54:30 2015 UTC,Only people who can see your real name will be able to see the custom picture.
KingdomHearts,3drlcm,CrustyCouch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:05:43 2015 UTC,I was unaware of this. Good to know.
KingdomHearts,3drlcm,LolTacoBell,9,Sun Jul 19 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"Here is how to do it:  -Download the Playstation App  -Tap your current profile picture in the upper right hand corner  -Tap ""Profile""  -Tap ""Edit Profile""  -Tap ""Change Profile Picture""  -Tap either ""Take Photo"" or ""Select Photo"" depending on what you want to do  -Choose a picture and hit ""Ok""  A few things:  -This was done on an iPhone. The method for android users may be a bit different, though the process is quite easy.  -It will take a few minutes to update properly.  Edit: Another thing, it won't display on PS3 as the PS3 displays the avatar only. Your profile pic and your avatar are two different things.   Edit 2: (Hopefully) One last thing: Only people with whom you've shared your real name with can see the custom picture. Thanks /u/CrustyCouch"

KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,Mr_dolphin,13,Sun Jul 19 03:57:01 2015 UTC,"It's a keyblade made of the Princesses of Hearts' hearts. So when Sora used it, he basically broke it to let the hearts out. Riku got it from Ansem who made it himself. Hell, if he can make his own heartless, why not a keyblade?"
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,MableDONKEY,2,Sun Jul 19 04:00:08 2015 UTC,This makes a lot of sense. I've just never heard of a Keyblade being made from actual hearts. It's odd that a Keyblade made from hearts of pure light have the ability to unlock darkness.
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,AxonPotential,9,Sun Jul 19 04:12:24 2015 UTC,"Well, the X-blade temporarily forged in BBS was made from hearts."
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,Foxrider304,4,Sun Jul 19 06:01:21 2015 UTC,The X-Blade isnt technically a keyblade. Keyblades were made to mimic them from what I understand
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,MableDONKEY,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it's the only one of its kind."
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,Tquinn96,3,Sun Jul 19 04:18:27 2015 UTC,"I always liked the design of it. It's like a darker, deadlier kingdom key"
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,123123sora,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:08 2015 UTC,"From KHWIKI: [KH1 Spoilers obviously]  ""In order to save Kairi, Sora turns Riku's Keyblade on himself. This releases both his and Kairi's hearts from Sora's body, reviving Kairi, but also completes the Keyhole and casts Sora into the darkness. Unbeknown to anyone, this act also produces Sora and Kairi's unique Nobodies, Roxas and Naminé. The Keyblade itself dissolves, releasing the Princesses' stolen hearts. Sora fades into a Shadow just as Kairi awakens, and the Heartless rapidly emerging from the Keyhole force Kairi, Donald, and Goofy to flee.""  http://www.khwiki.com/Keyblade_of_heart"
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,th30be,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"I wager we will see it in KH3. If xemnas canwield a keyblade but chooses not to, why nit thr heartless? Besides, the souleater dual sword thing he used at thr final battle was a precurser to Riku's way to dawn wasnt it?"
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,TheSilverwolfKnight,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the Keyblade to People's Hearts was made from the hearts of the Princess' of Hearts, so unless we want to be short another Guardian of Light (Kairi), it's not coming back."
KingdomHearts,3dsyrf,th30be,-4,Sun Jul 19 08:30:25 2015 UTC,You realize that time travel is involved right? Ansem and Xemnas is dead at this time. They were ripped out from their place in time and is following MX. Thry are not naked so they can take shit with them.Ansem tookthr keyblade with him when he was ripped from time.
KingdomHearts,3dt6wm,captainflowers91,3,Sun Jul 19 05:31:54 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't that imply that you're getting an entirely new Keyblade when you use a Keychain? Sora is always using Kingdom Key -- just sometimes with other chains.   I think, in general, Keyblade users can probably use each other's Keyblades though the other user could probably still summon it back. Just like how Aqua is using Eraqus' Keyblade right now."
KingdomHearts,3dt6wm,TarotFox,2,Sun Jul 19 05:36:15 2015 UTC,"That's true. I thought about that but, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think Master Eraques's had a chain either, possibly because it was meant to be passed down to keyblade masters. It seems possible that most chains given change a keyblade's form because it's a person or a world lending a piece of their hearts to the keybearer which is why it takes on a different form depending on the person or world it comes from.   But you could be right. Just a theory."
KingdomHearts,3dt6wm,TarotFox,3,Sun Jul 19 05:52:14 2015 UTC,"Master's Defender has a chain. The only keyblade we've seen that's ""active"" without one is the Keyblade of People's Hearts. All others have had one. The ones in the Keyblade Graveyard are ""lifeless"" and don't have them, but that might even be a technological limitation."
KingdomHearts,3dt6wm,TarotFox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:55:16 2015 UTC,"Ah you're right. It has Terra's Cross as the chain.....well now I feel stupid lol. But I still thought the theory in general was interesting and deserved at least some consideration haha.   And you may be right about the technical limitations being the only cause for that omission. If I remember correctly, they had to remove the capes from the armor that was shown in the original BBS trailer for that reason as well."

All the modding needed and the game cost me about 170 dollars.. Felt so great to play. Took a while to memories the attacks due to the game being Japanese.

We don't always need to talk about ""What new worlds do you want to see?"" or ""GUYS LOOK WHAT I FOUND IN THE TRAILER THAT'S BEEN DEBUNKED 80 TIMES"".    This isn't a low quality post, it's still related it Kingdom Hearts and I sure as hell never caught that Pam had a keyblade keychain."
KingdomHearts,3dupb6,Goose_Is_Awesome,10,Sun Jul 19 17:56:37 2015 UTC,Or it's a key?  The look of the skeleton key is not unique to kingdom hearts and it's on a keychain. Like unless we can get a clear enough view to see the teeth in the crown shape or the hand guard I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's just a key.
KingdomHearts,3dupb6,Uniphication,6,Sun Jul 19 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"Why are you being downvoted? It's definitely just a key. The keyblade is modeled off of a key, so when the shape is shrunken back down to its normal form why does everyone automatically assume it's supposed to represent a keyblade? It should be the other way around."
KingdomHearts,3dupb6,that_guy2010,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:45:04 2015 UTC,I just zoomed in on the picture and the teeth of the key are 100% the shape of the keyblade.
KingdomHearts,3dupb6,Goose_Is_Awesome,4,Sun Jul 19 18:57:13 2015 UTC,I did too and it's too pixely to tell.  So I stand my ground. It's a skeleton key.
KingdomHearts,3dupb6,Vultron,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"Eh, to me the blade actually looks like the Kingdom Key. But, that wasn't the point of my post anyways."
KingdomHearts,3dupb6,Goose_Is_Awesome,5,Sun Jul 19 18:56:23 2015 UTC,That's because the kingdom key is a skeleton key.

KingdomHearts,3dscld,TheDalekCaan,4,Sun Jul 19 00:05:49 2015 UTC,"Marvel wouldn't really fit. I could see one or two Star Wars characters fitting in, but not an entire World for it. Why? Well, Star Wars characters travel to other planets, which is similar to worlds. I could see them being something like a Coliseum extra boss."
KingdomHearts,3dscld,Xephon7,2,Sun Jul 19 01:39:30 2015 UTC,"I think it could go either way.. it really depends on how much they change it to be able to fit in with the Disney-esque theme of all the Kingdom Hearts games. But hey, they did Pirates of the Caribbean in KH2 and I think that worked well!"
KingdomHearts,3dscld,lemme_lick_ur_hair,4,Sun Jul 19 17:12:11 2015 UTC,"I'd like for Donald get Mjolnir as a weapon and for Goofy to get Cap's shield, but other than that, I don't think it would really work.  Or maybe Gummi Ship blueprints modeled after super heroes."
KingdomHearts,3dscld,Bob423,3,Sun Jul 19 00:21:05 2015 UTC,I'd rather see a world based on the Incredibles before a Marvel world.
KingdomHearts,3dscld,SighAgain,3,Sun Jul 19 02:58:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, as long as they use the cartoon versions of the characters (ie. Disney Infinity, Disney XD cartoons, etc.)  I'd be okay with them using Star Wars characters too, again, as long as the stick with using the animated versions."
KingdomHearts,3dscld,wetdirt28,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:54:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind small Marvel Cameos. Like maybe captain Americas shield for Goofy and maybe a staff like Thor's hammer for Donald. But the more I think about it Star Wars is kinda growing on me.. But I think I'd only like a Vader boss fight. If we're doing anything Lucasfilms I would be pretty happy to see Indiana Jones as a world.
KingdomHearts,3dscld,Arcaninemaster69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't want Marvel or Star Wars. They just don't really fit for me. If they did make 2 worlds of those 2 properties then they are probably taking away a spot from another Disney world. Say they had a choice between Avengers or The Incredibles. If Avengers got in that would mean the Incredibles didn't. I wouldn't like that, and I don't think fans would either."

KingdomHearts,3dscld,MableDONKEY,-4,Sun Jul 19 03:33:39 2015 UTC,"A lot of the characters marvel has, was copied from DC.  They force feminism down your throat whether you want it or not.  Joss Whedon.  One More Day.  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  Fem Thor. Fucking Fem Thor."
KingdomHearts,3dscld,TarotFox,4,Sun Jul 19 03:41:53 2015 UTC,"Seriously? You hate Marvel because of that?   What does that even mean? Having capable women is ""forcing feminism down your throat""? Granted, some of the new Thor comics do go out of line with it, but it's not the Marvel hive-mind making that decision, it's the specific writer in charge of the comic. There's thousands, of Marvel characters out there, who range from remarkably shitty to undeniably awesome, some of them are bound to be similar to the competition. What's wrong with Joss Whedon? Did it become cool to hate him after Age of Ultron or something? One More Day was ass, but shitty stories are bound to happen within 50 years of continuity.    Psst Have you seen the Kevin Smith Batman story where he retroactively makes Batman piss himself during the most iconic Year One moment?   Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D got pretty good after the Hydra twist. I don't like female Thor either, but it's not like Thor won't be back by the time his next movie hits, anyway."
KingdomHearts,3dscld,RussianHobo115,-3,Sun Jul 19 03:48:44 2015 UTC,"Joss Whedon is friends with Anita Sarkeesian. He panders to her crowd, and when AoU came out, they ripped him a new ass because he dared to give Black Widow development. The thing that really bothers me, is that after he left twitter from the harassment, he still defended the people who were attacking him!  The thing with DC though, is that anyone can jump in and create a new universe. There was no singular timeline like marvel. Other crap-tacular DC comics include All Star Batman and Robin and The Dark Knight Returns Again, but that doesn't mean shit to the other comics where batman is the main character. AoS was a shit show. They make a show about S.H.I.E.L.D agents, and then the next movie takes away S.H.I.E.L.D so they end up running around without a head for a while and then when they do find something, it's based around some shitty romance. I don't care about her as a character, but what I meant was that her story was shit. Thor loses his ability to wield his hammer because of Nick Fury. And then we find out that he gave up his name like it's a fucking title and now goes by odinson. Then they show Jane having cancer, and SHE'S THE NEW THOR?! A CANCER PATIENT IS GOING AROUND FIGHTING THE PATRIARCHY."
KingdomHearts,3dscld,Valtieri,2,Sun Jul 19 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about that Anita Sarkeesian stuff. I like Whedon a lot less now, but that doesn't change things a lot.  Marvel does have a whole huge multiverse where yes, anyone can go ahead and create anything.   A lot of what you're saying is true, but that's still a stupid reason for going around hating Marvel. Marvel is a big company, and they make a lot of awesome stuff just as well as they make shitty stuff. Their characters and their iconic stories are what matters the most, in my opinion."

KingdomHearts,3dqxo5,theblackfool,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"That's a hard one. I had more FUN with DDD (more fleshed out worlds, less mini game shenanigans except the dreadful dream eater stuff, flowmotion, enjoyed playing as Sora and Riku), but BBS had a lot more to it combat wise (multiple finish commands, mirage arena, shotlocks, command styles, command melding, D-links, the dreaded ice cream beat mini game).   I'm gonna have to go with DDD though. The bigger worlds and lack of fluff you gotta do for the journal made it a more enjoyable experience.   Disclaimer: I would have chosen BBS if it didn't make you do everything 3 times. It was just too much."

KingdomHearts,3dqxo5,CollarboneMcGee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"I'm the sort of person who played through the same handful of games time and again as a kid, and as such the multiple protagonists and story repetitions of BBS didn't bother me too much. At the same time, playing BBS was still more enjoyable than playing BBS.  It's all about the way you get 'stronger' in each of the games. There are very specific goals set out for you to get each ability, finisher, and the like. You don't have to depend on figuring out which two dream eaters you'd like to take into a fight and then maxing them out to get what makes them useful.  In BBS, if you want all the Resistances, Attack boosts, and Magic boosts, you get them. In 3D, you just don't have that option. While BBS makes the player feel strong for being the player, 3D makes the player feel strong because of a gimmick. Because of that, I had a lot more fun with BBS."
KingdomHearts,3dpunm,xistrue,5,Sat Jul 18 07:39:28 2015 UTC,"Almost all of your questions should be answered when you play Birth by Sleep! Trying to answer these without getting too detailed -    Xigbar, prior to heart loss. He's not, but their relationship is pretty familial - ""I care for you like my own son."" (Terra later calls him his father.) Xehanort and Eraqus, significantly before the events of BBS.  Two - Ansem the Wise (Christopher Lee) and Ansem, Seeker of Darkness (Billy Zane/Richard Epcar). Eraqus is a Keyblade Master and the teacher of Terra, Aqua, and Ven. Lea is Axel as a human. They lost their hearts. (The KH1 and KH2 Ansem Reports talk about it a bit - look up reports 12 and 13 from KH1, if you unlocked them. If not, they're here. The opening scene of 3D also shows more exactly what went down.) I'm not totally sure what you're asking here - are you asking why Lea's with Kairi and the others and not with the others, or why the others aren't training alongside them, or something else? (Actually, by ""the others who created the Nobodies,"" I'm not sure who you're talking about.)"

I'm not sure that's what OP meant (though it might be). Those are the people named ""Ansem"" but they might have been asking about incarnations of Xehanort.  So there's: Master Xehanort, the original person and the main villain of the entire series. Another one which I'm not gonna say cause it seems like OP hasn't played BBS yet. Ansem SoD, his heartless. Xemnas, his nobody. And Young Master Xehanort, the original person as a young adult, brought from the past. And you might also count Riku in KH1 since Ansem was possessing his body there."

I wanted to see others conclusions to them to compare with mine just to see if I was correct. This is what this reddit is for, no? It doesn't seem to be much of an issue when others want to ask, so I don't understand why it should be with me either. I didn't directly seek anyone out and demand them tell me. I just see if you aren't going to contribute to what I have asked them why waste the time in leaving a comment at all? Maybe you didn't mean to be rude so I'll say that I'm not meaning to sound negative. But, I'm not an idiot. I bought these games for replay value. So obviously I know that I can ""just play the games.""  Though playing the games, as great as they are, aren't exactly simple or easily deciphered.

I was just trying to save the experience of someone who I thought was for some reason trying to digest a bunch of information about the series based on stuff they'd seen in plot descriptions or Let's Plays or something.  It didn't seem like the right way to do things, to me."
KingdomHearts,3dpunm,NinetoFiveHero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"You're right in a way. And that's something I should of made clear that I had played them. Which I thought I had but that's my bad. I hadn't watched the detailed summary until after completing the games I could. Some of the content in the summary made me ask these questions because I realized I hadn't caught on while playing something it pointed out. I usually prefer to experience things as I go and have very few/no spoilers. But with such a wonky timeline/complex story I made a bit of an exception. See, as I've said, I have played the other games (except DDD) but haven't finished them to a complete. I'm unsure why I didn't other than I remember getting very frustrated at the card commands and gave up trying to figure it out. I just like to have things pieced together as I'm going into it. Especially went it's all linked into one huge story/timeline.  I was unaware that a lot of those questions could have been answered by playing BBS. My thinking, not have played DDD and with no way of doing so (not buying another console or edition of one just for one game) there was a lot that I had missed. Obviously so. Which I thought could be why I still had lingering questions. With what I do know and with having played KHI/KHII to complete, I'm still rather confused with some of the smaller peices that webs off into the bigger picture as a whole..  I see now more what your intentions were. A lot of negativity has been around in this sub lately and I don't want anyone to feel like they can't post freely about questions/concerns/theories/wants. As long as they are abiding the rules. This goes to add that it made me feel unwelcome to asking or stupid for doing so because of something I didn't know/was unsure of.

Probably about 50 or so years before the events of Birth By Sleep.  Well, technically 1 Ansem, but I'm pretty sure you mean Xehanort, whose heartless (main antagonist in kh1)had taken the name of the real Ansem. Eraqus was the master who had taught Terra, Aqua, and Ventus, and assumingly grew up with Xehanort. It's his magic (specifically his keyblade) that transformed The Land of Departure into Castle Oblivion, the setting for Chain of Memories and houses and shelters the unconscious Ventus.  Lea is Axel's human form. He sides with the Warriors of Light (Sora and company) after betraying Organization 13. Most of all of them should be in their human form by now, possibly. When a person is split into a heartless and a nobody, when the two of them are destroyed, they go back to being their normal human selves.  Because Lea willingly is siding himself on the light side."

KingdomHearts,3dpunm,HaouLeo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, he is. BBS spoiler: He's in his old man form though. Nomura is deliberately keeping what happened to Terra's heart in that process secret."
KingdomHearts,3dpunm,legendofzelderp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering. Pretty helpful. I actually didn't know that once nobodies/heartless were destroyed they returned to natural form. How Sora turned into a heartless has always confused me on that subject.
KingdomHearts,3dpunm,legendofzelderp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"First.  Braig was a apprentice of Ansem the wise. He worked at Ansem the wise castle in Radiant Gardens, helping to carry out experiments in the strength of the heart. In Birth by sleep Xeanort took over Terra's body. After his fight with Aqua he was found by Ansem the wise claiming to have no memory of who he was. Ansem the wise took him as a apprentice. There he met Braig and secretly they plotted to overthrow Ansem the wise. Xeanort took the hearts from all the apprentices including Braig. When a heart is taken a heartless is created and also a nobody is created. Braigs nobody is Xigbar.  Second .No he is not his father. Eragus is a Keyblade master who trains new Keyblade wielders. He trained alongside Xeanort and they both became masters. Terra and Aqua are his pupils. Ventus is Xeanorts pupil but Xeanort was really only using him for a experiment. The experiment failed. So he extracts the darkness from Ventus heart to create Venitas and then gives Ventus to Eraqus to train him. He then waits for Ventus to become strong enough to fight Venitas so that they will be equals and he can try his Experiment again. The Game Birth By Sleep really sells the idea of Eraqus, Terra, Aqua and Ven all being really close. almost like a family. that is why Terra calls him father and Aqua makes jokes that Terra and Ven are like brothers.  Third . The E3 Trailer shows A young Xeanort and Eraqus playing Chess long before the events of Birth By Sleep. The chess board actually depicts the great battle coming up in KH3 between the 13 darkness and the 7 Guardians of light. The symbol on top of each piece represenst a person. The two main pieces facing off in the center of the board are Sora and Xeanort.   Fourth .There are 2 Ansems. Ansem the wise http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Kingdom-Hearts/Ansem-the-Wise/ and Ansem Seeker of Darkness http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Ansem,_Seeker_of_Darkness Ansem the Wise is the true, original Ansem. He studied the strength of the heart. Ansem seeker of Darkness is a unique heartless. He is the Heartless of TerraXeanort. He kept a human form because he willingly gave himself over to darkness. He also took on the name Ansem but he is not the true Ansem. The reason why he took the name was never truly explained. At first people were lead to believe it was because Xeanort had lost his memory when Ansem the wise found him and took him in but later we discover that Xeanort never truly lost his memory so the real reason he chooses the name is unclear.  Fifth . Eraqus as i explained above is a Keyblade master. He trained alongside Xeanort. He trains new Keyblade wielders. Xeanort once tried to destroy the universe using Ventus but failed. He discovers that Xeanort is going to try again using Ventus so he decides he must kill Ven to prevent this from happening and although he does not want to he knows he must for the greater good. However Terra shows up and not knowing the full story stops him and kills him.  Sixth . Lea is a guy from Radiant garden. When he is young he and his friend Isa enter Ansem the wise castle Just after making friends with Ventus. They enter at the same time that Xeanort and Braig are taking over. They are captured and have their hearts removed. This creates their Heartless and Nobodies. Isa's nobody is Siax and Lea's nobody is Axel. They both join the organisation. Axel becomes friends with Roxas ( Sora's nobody) probably because he looks like Ventus and he can remember him from when he was human (Lea). He also befriends Xion who is a friend of both Roxas and him. He promises to bring Roxas back and probably also wants to protect Xion so he sacrifices himself to save Sora because Roxas and Xion live within Sora. When a persons Heartless and Nobody are destroyed or die they Human form returns. So when Axel sacrafices himself and his heartless dies ( we dont see his heartless die but it is presumed ) Then Lea wakes up again in Ansem the wise castle. He decides he wants to learn to use a Keyblade. Probably to save him other friend Isa (Siax). So he goes to train under Yen Sid with Kairi. He finally manages to summon a keyblade of his own at the end of Dream Drop Distance.  Seventh .I explained a lot of this above. Many were Ansem the wises apprentices. while others were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. When the Heartless and Nobodies are destroyed many of these woke up again in Ansem the wise castle. Some still remain nobodies working with Xeanort and so their bodies haven't returned yet.  Eight . Lea is strong of heart and wants to save his friends. Even when he was a nobody he was wiling to go against orders and the organisation to help his friends. Isa who is still a nobody named Siax, Roxas who dwells within Sora and Xion who also Dwells within Sora and to a lesser extent Namine who dwells within Sora. he wants to save them all. He also doesnt know but his friend Ventus Lives within Sora too. He and Kairi are to go through training to become Keyblade masters.  Namine is a unique Nobody created from Sora. She is really Kairis nobody but Kairi is a princess of light. Her Heart is pure light and so she should not be able to create a nobody. However in the first game her heart was hiding within Sora and so when Sora released his and her heart Sora actually created 2 nobodies. Roxas and Namine. Namine can manipulate memories.  I would suggest going through all the games such as  358/2 days to understand more about Roxas, Axel/Lea and Xion. Birth by sleep  to understand more about Terra, Aqua, Ventus, Eraqus and Xeanort. And finially Dream Drop Distance to fill in some vital information before playing KH3. You have time as the game KH3 probably wont be out until 2016."
KingdomHearts,3dpunm,legendofzelderp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:13:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the very in depth answers. I really appreciate it. It has been a while since I've played the other games beside KHI/KHII. I'd love to play DDD but I don't have a 3DS and don't plan on buying one. I'm actually trying to save for a PS4 when KHIII comes out. I thought of watching the scenes from DDD to maybe get up to speed. But thanks again.
KingdomHearts,3dpe4m,Malqua_,2,Sat Jul 18 04:14:50 2015 UTC,No. The check is at the end of each battle.  Just make sure the card you want is the last enemy you kill.
KingdomHearts,3dpe4m,dfj2xxx,2,Sat Jul 18 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks. I wish more people would dig into the math involved. All we know so far is that restarting sets the random seed, and three cards increase chances by a slim margin.  Does the restarting even apply to the PS3 version?"
KingdomHearts,3dpe4m,theblackfool,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:36:44 2015 UTC,"Barely. IMO it's not worth it. I think it just gives people peace of mind, in the same way that people held Up+B(or whatever your variation) to try and get better odds to catch Pokemon.  Getting all the cards just sucks. But using Teeming, Looming, and Almighty Darkness are really the only way to improve odds. Sometimes you'll get a card after 5 battles, sometimes you'll get them after 20."

KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,OWEN626,7,Fri Jul 17 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"Play KH1. Its has the best overall experience. While other games in the series are great, and have a lot of things going for them, overall they just don't match up to the first.    KH1 has great pacing and nothing seems like its obviously filler, which is a big problem in the other games. BBS and DDD especially are mostly with filler and really only have major things happening at the start, some brief things in the middle, and most of the big things happening at the end. KH1 doesn't have that problem. It gives you new info as you gradually go through the game at a pretty consistent rate, then gives you all the big reveals at the end, like any good story should.  Its story is simple and clean (yes, that was on purpose), and doesn't require you to play any other game to understand what is going on, and understanding whats going on catching all the connections is the biggest appeal to the franchises overall story imo, and something that would be lost on you if you played one of the later games.   Its gameplay, while not as flashy as KH2, is just as good, and its not gimmicky like the hand held games are. It also doesn't suffer from hardware limitations that basically turn the combat into a dodge fest, like in the case of BBS.   And imo, the biggest thing it has going for it, imo, is it has this certain innocent charm that all of the other games lack. Though whether that comes from the game being the first, or the dev's using the other games to experiment, I can't quite tell. Either way, its there and its very enjoyable.  Also, if you do get pulled in, you will want to play the first one anyway. Just so you can see and notice all the changes throughout the series and basically see how it aged. Especially compared to KH3 when that comes out."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,Xynth22,8,Fri Jul 17 17:49:41 2015 UTC,Birth by Sleep
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,Xephon7,2,Fri Jul 17 15:52:34 2015 UTC,"I'll back the Birth by Sleep recommendation. Although KH 2 (HD 2.5) has the most content and best graphics out of all the titles, it makes absolutely no sense story-wise - especially if you haven't touched the other games - and makes no sense even to the people who have played all the games. BBS has the refined combat, and the story is made to flow well without any knowledge of the previous titles."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,Jamaz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:19 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong. Doesn't 2.5 HD have Birth by Sleep on it?
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,Jamaz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, you said ""one Kingdom Hearts game"". 2.5 HD has 3 games on it (albeit I believe Re:Coded is just movies). I think both the 2.5 Remix playable games add up to 80+ hours of game time total. So 2.5 Remix is definitely the ""best bang for your buck"", but if were simply only going to play one of those games ever, I'd recommend Birth by Sleep."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,Uragirimono,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:41 2015 UTC,ahhh. Gotcha.
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,HaouLeo,2,Fri Jul 17 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"Really just get the 2.5 HD ReMIX and play Birth by Sleep. If you like BbS, you can still play KH2.  Speaking of gameplay difficulty, BbS is pretty balanced, KH1 and CoM are really hard and KH2 is too easy. So going with the HD ReMIX where you have BbS and KH2 is the best way."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,Gnasherman42,3,Fri Jul 17 22:51:32 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts 2 definitely. Since you don't mind the story, the gameplay and action of KH2 is the best one yet, even though it misses a bit of KH1's RPG elements."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,obeliskblade,2,Fri Jul 17 18:24:36 2015 UTC,Personally KH II is my fav but you'd probably wanna look up the story as you're going through it so you're not lost.
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,Pizzaplanet420,2,Fri Jul 17 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"That is tough, I believe 1 to be the best game, but i'm certain that 2, BBS, and dream drop are more important for story leading into three. so I really don't know which is best to play.  If you play them all on easier modes you could probably get through 1 and 2 in the same time it would take you to complete either at the highest difficulty."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,limitbreaker77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"I think with how long the wait is probably going to be, free time shouldn't be a issue to try out the games. They are both 20$ now on PS3 in the 1.5 and 2.5 HD remixes. But if you want the best the series has to offer I'd say 2.5 is the best way to go and just play KH2 if you are really constrained for time.   I never beat KH1 growing up but even I was able to understand the story of KH2 with no problem and it was the game that got me into the series. I beat that game and understood the plot of the game but had so many more questions that playing all the games in the series really brought answers too, but you can always look at the wiki or watch videos explaining it."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,St0rmeye,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on what you're going for. I'd personally recommend KH1 for a balanced experience between a great story and fun gameplay, and it's one of my favorites in the series. /u/Xynth22 explains KH1's story orientation very well.  KH2, on the other hand, is the game that a lot of the fandom seems to love because it probably had the best gameplay for most. While KH1 was a lot more hack-and-slash, KH2 made you use all sorts of different things like summons and drives, and basically required that you develop a strategy for the fights (well, in the harder modes anyway :P)  Those are the two biggest games in the series and you can choose which aspect you'd prefer, story or gameplay. I'll also throw BBS in there because it seems generally well-received, and people like both the story and gameplay. I feel like this can be hit or miss, though, because I've also seen many people who hate BBS' combat (to an extent, myself included)."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,bobguy117,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"I think the combat mechanics are the best in KH2:FM which is found on the 2.5 HD Remix. When it comes to story I would recommend either KH1 or 2, BBS is probably really enjoyable if you've already learned about the KH universe in other games. KH 1 and 2, however, are the best stand alone experiences even without the overarching connections. It may be worth to watch a cutscene movie on YouTube if you don't want to play through a whole game but still want to catch up on the story."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,brunothealmighty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts 1's story is the only one that is complete on its own.

KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,MableDONKEY,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:15:50 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I'd get both hd remixes (1.5 and 2.5)    1.5 has KH1, kingdom hearts chain of memories, and ingdom hearts 358/2 days.  2.5 has KH2, birth by sleep, and re:coded.  Both of them toegther will only cost you about 60 bucks, which is like 10 dollars a game.  You may not have the time right now, but when you do get the time, you'll have all the KH titles released so far except for 3d.  Of all of those, start with KH1.  It's what started it all.  It's an absolutely wonderful game.    Chronologically in the kh universe, BBS came first, but because of the way square presented the story, KH1 is the only one that will make sense by itself.  chain of memories happens directly after KH1.  358/2 happens directly before kh2.  Then it's kh2.  Then it's re:coded.  Then it's 3d.  Finally, BBS is a prequel to all of the rest of the games, but really won't make sense unless you play at least kh1 and 2.  I hope this helps, and again, I can't stress enough how worth it it is to get both hd remixes and then starting with kh1."
KingdomHearts,3dmw0c,TheCoaster130,0,Sun Jul 19 23:56:58 2015 UTC,Re:Coded. Most of it is a recap of what's happened before anyway.  Either that or 3D as it has full recaps on every game in the series thus far.

KingdomHearts,3dmuwp,ChosenUchiha,5,Fri Jul 17 15:39:27 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_lcWqm8HE  It's not perfect, but I believe this guide should certainly help if you haven't been using it already.  Axel- Was a HUGE pain in the ass for me personally. Equip the Abyss keyblade. Every time he teleported behind me, I would just dodge roll out of the way (you could reflect for damage). What I did was stay close to him so he would do his chakram fling. Dodge roll away from that attack and he will be wide open. Do a combo, then 2 blizzards. Just rinse and repeat this entire battle until he does his desperation move. Keep Hi-Potions or elixirs on shortcut just in case you get nervous. The only bitch about this battle was the small arena, but you'll get better at maneuvering around it. For this battle, just be consistent in your tactics.  Larxene was the toughest for me, harder than Lingering Will. If you want the fight to be easier, use Reflect because it inflicts a MASSIVE amount of damage on her. In general, when she teleports, get ready to reflect. Also watch out for her desperation move as well, which is relatively easy to dodge.  Those two were extremely difficult for me. If I got really nervous, I would pause before they attacked just to compose my actions before I screwed up. You only have 4 left to go, and some of them will be indeed frustrating, but hang in there you're almost done!"

KingdomHearts,3dmgin,TeddySD,3,Fri Jul 17 13:42:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can continue playing after beating the game. You are always given one last opportunity to save before defeating the final boss. When you beat them, your save will have a crown next to it indicating the story was completed, and loading it will return you too your last save point (i.e. before you beat the final boss). But since you completed the story, various bonus materials open up that weren't available before, mainly special bosses. This is true for most, if not all Kingdom Hearts titles. One of the selling points of the final mix remakes is the addition of even more endgame content and bosses. So if you have the 1.5 or 2.5 remixes, which have the final mix versions of the titles, you have plenty more content available to play even after completing the story, yes.  Also, should you want to get the secret endings that require completion of different tasks depending on the difficulty setting you played on, you can do them after beating the game. Once the tasks are completed, go back and beat the final boss again and you will get the secret ending."

KingdomHearts,3dmgin,acun1994,2,Fri Jul 17 13:55:36 2015 UTC,In the final mixes after beating the game you are prompted to save and you get a crown on your save file to symbolize that you completed it. So yes you can keep playing after you beat the final boss.

However, in KHF2FM, you can save after beating Xemnas, and there are certain things that you can't do until you have done that.  For one of the secret bosses, you have to seal all keyholes (including 100 Acre Wood) and beat the game before you can fight him."

Do to it explaining and tying into other theories, based off a lot of stuff we've seen Xehanorrt do. Like when he destroyed a whole world, or time travel. Even explaining the biggest theory at the moment are the Foretellers Seekers."
KingdomHearts,3dkpm1,rd_Mars,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"So his theory is basically giving ""The Seeker of Darkness"" title to the ""No Heart"" theory?"
KingdomHearts,3dkpm1,SugoiL0vePunch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:41 2015 UTC,"No in a sense ""No heart"" is just a boss right now. Unless you mean is he saying this could be a boss that is related to Xehanort like ""No Heart"" is. He's stating Xehanort is has the heart/will of ""THE Seeker of Darkness"" and at the end of kingdom Hearts 3 THE Seeker Of Darkness will return. To be either the new villain or will be Sora's true final fight in KH3."
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,buzzardluck,9,Thu Jul 16 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"Final mix, you get a couple of extra scenes and boss fights. Also you get to go to the cavern of remembrance and fight all the orginization members, and one of the hardest fights in the series... lingering will. Good luck. you also can fight mushroom xiii and earn all those goodies that come along with it. As for re:coded, it's just scenes and story. Just watch them whenever you have freetime. I would recommend playing kh2fm though."
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,Justye,7,Thu Jul 16 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"Coded has very few important story points. It's the weakest KH game IMO. It's probably best to just watch the HD scenes from 2.5, but it makes for a decently fun play if you have nothing better to do."
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,ST6661,3,Thu Jul 16 18:15:39 2015 UTC,exactly what this guy said. Also it gets very VERY tiring and repetitive when you get to the last world.
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,HaouLeo,3,Thu Jul 16 18:40:01 2015 UTC,No that's when you do 30 Block Olympus.
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,GreyouTT,7,Fri Jul 17 16:05:14 2015 UTC,Re:Coded is a really damn fun game to play if you're looking for a more arcadey KH experience or just KH in general. I love it!
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,GreyouTT,6,Thu Jul 16 20:28:30 2015 UTC,"Re: Coded is pretty fun and has great gameplay but easily the least necessary of all the KH games in terms of story. Before the movie added that one scene at the end that connects it loosely to X, it only served as a small teaser to KH3D and a bit of closure to the last loose end at the end of Chain of Memories."
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,bobguy117,3,Thu Jul 16 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Re:Coded is actually pretty fun to play - if you have the opportunity to do so, go for it. Absolutely watch the movie in 2.5, at least.  KH2FM+ is definitely worth it - the new cutscenes are neat and substantial, and there's plenty of bonus fights and content available."
KingdomHearts,3diy8i,beribboned,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.  Long answer: Noooooooooooooooooooooo.  But seriously, I found Re: Coded to be the worst game in the franchise, in story, visuals, and gameplay. I know some people enjoy the fact that it mixes up the gameplay styles every level (turn based one time, side scrolling the next, ect, ect....) but I absolutely HATED that. It honestly made it feel like I wasn't even playing a KH game, and the only reason I played through the entire thing was because I simply wanted to say ""I did it once"".  Also, the controls were garbage because it was on a DS, but 358 (and even DDD on the 3DS) suffered from that as well.  If I were you I'd just read a synopsis of the plot so you can get caught up on what happens in the game. Or even watch the Re: Coded movie included with 2.5 Remix if you have 3 hours to spare and/or want to watch something that will most definitely put you to sleep."

KingdomHearts,3dhlei,Dominator_9000,7,Thu Jul 16 13:02:23 2015 UTC,"Which part is that? I just repeatedly died against the boss in Radiant Garden, that you fight along side Terra and Aqua and he has one massive-ass laser."
KingdomHearts,3dhlei,Jamaz,17,Thu Jul 16 13:05:35 2015 UTC,"""Laser Dome"" in Kingdom Hearts 2 where you're supposed to use triangle to deflect with Riku and X to deflect with Sora, but everyone by this point has been conditioned to only mash triangle for reaction commands, so its pretty much canon that Riku deflects everything while Sora sits there and gets his ass handed to him.  And that same boss you're talking about is the one that gave me the most trouble out of any non-optional boss in BBS for some reason. There's probably a legitimate way to get around it, but I just shot-locked and dragged out the invincibility frames to get past those phases. That or I just hug behind him and attack while praying he doesn't switch direction to blast my face off three times in succession."
KingdomHearts,3dhlei,Jamaz,2,Thu Jul 16 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"I died twice almost immediately while I was figuring out his mechanics, but then the third try, I whittled him down to 1 and a small bit of health for the last body part, was waiting for cure to cooldown and then he rushed me with this weird flame/meteor thing and killed me as I couldn't dodge him. Frustrated to the point of yelling so I rage quit for the evening ;)  So non-optional, can I just avoid this boss?"
KingdomHearts,3dhlei,Jamaz,2,Thu Jul 16 13:26:20 2015 UTC,"Nah dawg, non-optional as in you have to beat him, lol. There are optional, secret bosses that are the hardest in the game is what I mean; but that guy you're fighting was harder than the final bosses for me.  I forget his attacks since it's been a while, but there is a spinning one where he shoots projectiles at you where you can just deflect them with square. And I think I did the same thing for meteors(?) where I just saved enough shot-lock to get 10 second god-mode. And if you still have trouble, you can always grind and get elemental resist passives. I accidentally got those on my final playthrough on Aqua, and she just tanked 5 consecutive lasers to the face while Terra in my first playthrough would die to 2 -_-;"

KingdomHearts,3dhlei,Jack_Ryker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:54:48 2015 UTC,First time playing Kingdom Hearts 2 and starting off as Roxas it was different and didn't know who he was but it made sense later on but still weird to be playing someone else that's not in a way Sora.
KingdomHearts,3dhlei,JH1996,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:20:46 2015 UTC,"Data Axel. Being at 1 hp the whole fight due to the burning ground was epic. And when you beat it, you just know you played it perfect cause you didn't get hit even once."
KingdomHearts,3dhlei,Bixran,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:41 2015 UTC,"I'm split between feeling the Immense amount of anger and power leading up to and during the Battle of 1000 heartless, and IT'S RAININ LASERS! From the final battle. They're just too good to pass up"
KingdomHearts,3dhlei,forhadrahman3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"So I had played final mix + by importing it back when I was 16, and I remember that Terra (Lingering Sentiment) fight taking literally all summer for me to do, but I finally did it. Then two years later when Birth By Sleep came out and you see the genesis of the LS and then you get to play as it, damn man. For me that was a huge mic drop moment"
KingdomHearts,3dhlei,CptnChunk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"Beating the superbosses and getting the Gold Crown on Crit mode in KH2FM for the first time. Was pretty freaking hard, and took a lot of memorization, but those bosses are still the best part of 2FM in my opinion."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,Zacatakk,3,Fri Jul 17 00:03:10 2015 UTC,"Possible, but unlikely - Riku's vaguely aware of Xehanort before anything happens, but as ""the kid who left."" Apprentice Xehanort in the latest trailer is pretty young to have had a kid before leaving, and we know his opinion on Destiny Islands isn't high enough to come back often."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,beribboned,2,Fri Jul 17 00:12:33 2015 UTC,"True. I just thought there were too many similarities to pass up. For example, both have long-ish gray hair, both are Keyblade masters, and both have accepted darkness into their hearts, enough to change their body."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,beribboned,7,Fri Jul 17 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's more a thematic similarity (Riku and Sora are both kind of...  I guess foils is the word I want? for Xehanort in different ways - Riku started out similar, but handled just about everything differently) than a familial one. KH has never really focused on family bonds, so I tend to assume ""x and y are related"" theories are less likely."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,TarotFox,2,Fri Jul 17 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"Eraqus is like a shitty version of Sora.  Seriously, when Riku was falling to darkness, Sora doesn't really DO anything to facilitate Riku's recovery. It's entirely on Riku to do that. A couple of times Sora beats him up and then Riku runs away to go deal with his problems on his own. More or less the same thing happens with Eraqus and Xehanort except Xehanort goes full Darkness and Eraqus doesn't really ever get past the ""No, stop"" stage."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,Uragirimono,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:28:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. KH and family is a contradiction in itself. Remember Sora's mother? Yeah? Well, he does not.  So I agree with beribboned."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,rd_Mars,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:10:44 2015 UTC,"Wait, Riku mentioned knowing Xehanort before he left Destiny Islands? I'm assuming this is some kind of ""worlds run on different timelines"" thing. When was this mentioned in the games?"
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,beribboned,2,Fri Jul 17 00:47:44 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound like they'd ever met, or anything - it's in BBS.   Riku: I heard once there was a kid who left for good.  Riku: So how did you get here, anyway?  Terra: Is there some reason you're interested in the outside world?  Riku: Yeah. I wanna be strong one day. Like that kid who left. He went to the outside world-- I bet he's really strong now. I know it's out there somewhere-- the strength that I need."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,rd_Mars,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:51:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, I knew I vaguely remembered this mentioned somewhere in one of the games. I really hope we see some flashbacks of Xehasquirt still on the islands."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,K0we,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:59:56 2015 UTC,I don't know why but I always thought that referred to Ventus
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,beribboned,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but we know Xehanort's actually from Destiny Islands. Ventus likely is not, just from the way the Report where he talks about leaving Ven there to die is phrased. (""my boyhood home,"" not any mention of it being Ven's too)"
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,K0we,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, now that I think about it it makes perfect sense. My idea was pre DDD"
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,HaouLeo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:25:24 2015 UTC,I always assumed it's like an urban legend on DI. The story of the kid who left.
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,beribboned,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Assuming Xehanort's somewhere over 65 in BBS, that means it's been ~50 years since he's left - even a true story could pretty much have passed into being an urban legend by then, I think.  (Although now that I think about it, it's weird that it's ""he left"" and not ""he drowned at sea"" or something. Maybe since DI is physically isolated by the ocean they're more likely to believe in there being something beyond it?)"
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,HaouLeo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I meant. It is true that he left, but people most likely don't believe in other worlds so they just assume he sailed away and eventually died, but there are urban legends about it. Riku does believe there are other worlds, so he is sure that the story about the kid who left might mean he traveled to another world."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,Wmnplzr480,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"Well what I thought was... Is it ever mentioned that Riku has parents?   Maybe he was his kid and just left him on the islands like he does with Ven.  Maybe Riku isn't even from that world, maybe that's why he was so focused on escaping."
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,beribboned,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:01:43 2015 UTC,"He says ""we may never see our parents again"" in KH1, which probably means he's got at least one. There's no reason to believe he isn't a native-born Islander (if he was from somewhere else, KH1 Riku would have focused so hard on that; he would have made it the biggest part of his identity).  (Also Xehanort's explicitly leaving Ven there to die - he doesn't seem like he'd want to consign anyone to living in a world he views as ""a prison,"" though I have no idea what kind of views he'd have on his hypothetical child's survival.)"
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,Wmnplzr480,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:08:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense.
KingdomHearts,3dkfib,ender91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:35:34 2015 UTC,"I dont see lineage coming in to play like that. I do, however think Terra will come back so theres that."

First played through Chain of Memories in Japanese when it was released in Japan, and once in English, and I've never beaten Re;CoM. Never played Re:coded...beat 3D just once.  After KH1 I've never really played through a KH game ""blind"" again. When KH2 was released in Japan I ate up all of the stuff that the Japanese players were putting out there so I knew all about the Xehanort/Ansem crap before I even put one minute into that game. Hell I remember sitting in computer class in high school covertly downloading a mpeg of a guy playing as Roxas in Twilight Town (it was the first video released by anyone who had a copy of the game). And by the time Birth by Sleep came out streaming games was a thing so I was glued to the screen watching Japanese players stream the game, the same with 3D."

KingdomHearts,3dlbyj,ColdFire111,3,Fri Jul 17 05:02:07 2015 UTC,PS2 discs are DVD's. DVD's have region locks. So either you need a foreign PS2 or you have to mod it to get around the lock. Or you could buy the Re:Mix's or emulate.
KingdomHearts,3dlbyj,not_your_face,2,Fri Jul 17 05:10:53 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm going to have to buy a swap magic. At least I got the games pretty cheap.

KingdomHearts,3dlbyj,VonFrank,2,Sat Jul 18 03:49:54 2015 UTC,I don't have the discs. I use a swap magic ELF file. The best way to find strats is to watch the world record run on YouTube and then make your own notes. The leaderboards are khleaderboards.com
KingdomHearts,3dlbyj,jmoney003,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:17:03 2015 UTC,Okay and what you're saying is you don't have a legit copy of swap magic just an elf and it still works fine?
KingdomHearts,3dlbyj,JdotSweapA,0,Sat Jul 18 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, why dont you simply get the Remixes on PS3? Even if you dont have a PS3 right now, the cost of one these days is pretty low, and the bit extra $$$ you will spend is well worth the vast improvements on the PS3 versions as well as skipping the hassle of Swap Magic nonsense."

KingdomHearts,3dhviy,Heartless01,6,Thu Jul 16 12:06:40 2015 UTC,"The way they use the word ""exist"" isn't really in the sense of pure existence. I mean, it is quite obvious that there ARE Nobodies. They are, however, not a naturally occurring (so-to-speak) creation and they lack hearts, leading to this rhetoric about nothingness and existence and what not.   Heartless are made up of the Darkness within hearts. So in a sense, yes, they have hearts that are consumed by darkness."
KingdomHearts,3dhviy,TarotFox,5,Thu Jul 16 12:13:41 2015 UTC,"Nobodies are walking shalls that been left behind when one becomes a heartless.  Yes, they have no hearts. But, they can grow hearts.  So....yes, I guess they do exist."
KingdomHearts,3dhviy,godmaker12345,2,Thu Jul 16 12:14:32 2015 UTC,They only exist once that heart grows though...yeah?
KingdomHearts,3dhviy,EnlightenedModifier,5,Thu Jul 16 13:46:29 2015 UTC,I think it's more like they were never suppose to exist. They just do.
KingdomHearts,3dhviy,Your_Window_Peeper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"The Heartless were given their name before it was known what they were made of. As they seemed to be drawn to hearts and lack emotion they got the name, but later it was found that they are pretty much always just hearts and darkness."
KingdomHearts,3dhviy,TheNothingness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"The follwing is the best way I can put it, by my own understanding. As only people with very, very strong wills become Nobodies, they are a sort of ""oversight"" on the part of the realms (or whatever the ultimate force is that guides the World). When a Somebody's heart is consumed by the Dark, by whatever means (Ansem's machine, Purebloods, etc...), they are supposed to become Heartless. Nothing else. However, some individuals are so powerful in one way or another, their body is preserved. This should not happen. I think that these individuals are so important that they must be preserved by the Light for one reason or another (Sora/Roxas, Lea/Axel) . By that same token, perhaps some are just as important to the Dark, as well, and therefore preserved (Xehanhort/Xemnas, Isa/Saïx). And also in a totally different way in the cases of Ventus and Kairi and the other six Princesses (their hearts were pure light).  So basically, Nobodies are but really should not be by the ordinary rules. It's more of a metaphorical non-existence than a literal one."
KingdomHearts,3djpha,RRyan31,4,Thu Jul 16 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"The base gameplay of KH3 is gonna be like that of KH1 and KH2, which most people in the franchise are very happy about (including myself). The style of BBS and DDD was alright, but it was not balanced at all and had numerous flaws. The style in KH2, however, was flawless and is exactly what KH3's gameplay should be like (perhaps with a few new things added in as well).  Also, if you are doing nothing but ""smashing attack all the time"" in KH1 and KH2, you're playing it wrong... You'll never survive on the higher difficulties or against super-bosses."
KingdomHearts,3djpha,VonFrank,3,Fri Jul 17 05:55:33 2015 UTC,I'd much prefer it to play like KH1/2. Stick to the roots. I just find this play style much more enjoyable. (probably because I've played 1&2 so many times)
KingdomHearts,3djpha,ColdFire111,5,Fri Jul 17 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"They've said it'll be more like KH1/2's gameplay. (Though the interface in the trailer is likely not a final one, it's set up like KH2's - Attack/Item/Magic/Summon.)"
KingdomHearts,3djpha,beribboned,2,Thu Jul 16 21:10:18 2015 UTC,"You don't have to button mash attack all the time in either system. But hopefully KH3 will give us some easy, fluid ways to use really cool special attacks like those of Re:CoM & BBS without having to go by the same command deck system."
KingdomHearts,3djpha,rd_Mars,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"KH1 and KH2 had better battle systems than any KH game that game after. I think that Birth by Sleep could've had a good battle system also if a few select things were changed. The no. 1 sin of any post KH2 battle system in this series is that they made hitting things with a Keyblade feel boring and useless. The first thing they need to do in KH3 is make sure that it feels good to hit a guy with a Keyblade, if not, then they've failed."
KingdomHearts,3djpha,Iimetime,-1,Fri Jul 17 07:23:51 2015 UTC,KH2 hopefully and playing the game on beginner and calling it attack mashy doesn't help your argument.
KingdomHearts,3djpha,nevach,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:12 2015 UTC,I wasn't trying to argue anything? I was just curious if Square Enix has said or shown anything that shows what the command panels are going to be like

Drops ended up being really fun to me. Also Flowmotion attacks end up being a really slow, boring, and lazy way to play the game. It's only really strong in the beginning. Much better to focus on building your command deck--the game has huge number of skills and some really badass ones are Sora-only or Riku-only.   3D ended up being my second favorite KH game as far as game play is concerned. Just don't ruin it with Balloon spam. :D   Oh and I think it's 20 to 30 hours for a 1st time play through."

It does get easier to know your surroundings once you get better in combat.  Combat: The more you invest in the dream eaters the more fun combat is in my opinion. Regarding to the flowmotion, it is very OP. Its basically guerrilla tactics, but its up to you how you want to play.   Drop: The drop system is supposed to show that Riku and Sora are progressing though the worlds at the same time. My first play through, I just went with it, but the second time  I usually finished a world with one character, and then went back to finish with the other."

KingdomHearts,3djar1,-oneskyonedestiny-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:34 2015 UTC,I reserved an ability slot for drop-me-nots in order to prevent the awkward dropping. I just drop when I'm ready.

KingdomHearts,3djar1,GreyouTT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:11 2015 UTC,Drop-me-nots are items you can use in the game to basically cancel the automatic drop into the other character. It allows you to stay as a certain character for longer and can be especially useful if you're in the middle of combat or something else important.
KingdomHearts,3djar1,VonFrank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:08:33 2015 UTC,"These are all common complaints re. DDD.  Personally, I agree that the combat is hard to control.  You can use drop-me-nots in your deck to keep from dropping.  Flowmotion is ridiculously OP.  I would say this game is not as fun to play as the others, even CoM with its repetitiveness is at least contollable.  Anyways, I would say playthough it."
KingdomHearts,3djar1,Uragirimono,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:17 2015 UTC,Drop-me-nots really make the drop system non-existant. You can use those and complete a set of worlds with one character and then switch to the other afterwards with really big drop bonuses.
KingdomHearts,3djar1,Iimetime,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all of your issues with the franchise so far can be summed up with the response ""That's because you're playing DDD."" All of the complaints you listed are completely valid, in my opinion, regarding that particular game in the KH saga. They do not, however, apply to most other games.  And besides, if you truly want a feel for the franchise, you really should play the HD Remixes on PS3. They include all of the important games in the series except for DDD (which still isn't that important IMO) and play far better because they are on an actual console and not a fairly inadequate handheld system."
KingdomHearts,3djafk,tacobelltuesdays,5,Thu Jul 16 18:51:20 2015 UTC,It is hinted/explained by Euphemera that all the worlds and people you meet on different worlds are illusions of the future created by the books of prophesy.
KingdomHearts,3djafk,Hyper-Rushe,4,Fri Jul 17 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"Correct. everything except for the players, the chirithy's, the foretellers, and the dream world version of daybreak town are all fakes created by the tome of prophecy, which is why everything involving disney characters/worlds seems to be a repeat of kh1, because everything disney in the game is a copy from that game."
KingdomHearts,3djafk,TheCrazyEspeon,2,Fri Jul 17 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that clears it up!"
KingdomHearts,3djafk,HaouLeo,2,Fri Jul 17 06:08:35 2015 UTC,I didn't know that. This game is more and more turning out to have a mindfuck plot like a KH game should have.
KingdomHearts,3djafk,beribboned,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"That scene was from the first anniversary event - they crashed their gummi ship in Daybreak Town, and the player had to help them gather gummis to repair it.  Anyway, it's still kind of weird - since, you know, gummis don't exist during KHX's time. But! The second anniversary event just started last night, and it's pretty similar to the first so far (good job guys, you crashed in the same place twice...?), so it might have an actual answer."
KingdomHearts,3dfqdx,HawtSkhot,6,Wed Jul 15 22:31:53 2015 UTC,"IMO it's really interesting to see someone else's perspective on the game. I never really enjoyed the gummi ship, and whenever I met a new character I didn't know I just took them at face value and didn't even try to figure out what game they were originally from or their background. On the flip side, I loved the combat controls the instant I started playing and never really found them that hard. Keep it up friend"

For some reason I really enjoy this ""series"". It's pretty much a lets play, but we have to imagine the struggles, and the enjoyment. I had troubles with the gummi ship creation as well. If it helps you out any, you can beat the game with the basic model. The editor is not needed, but it does help. Keep posting these. It's a blast."
KingdomHearts,3dfqdx,ShinyGoombah,3,Thu Jul 16 00:12:43 2015 UTC,Oh boy...  I did some tinkering to his abilities during the Trickmaster fight and it did nothing.

Always assign everything to Sora.   What a fantastic gameplay mechanic   That's a phrase I haven't heard in a long time....   Now for one of my few complaints about the game so far: the camera system is just as detrimental as your surrounding   Just imagine using L2 and R2 in the originals.  While still atrocious, trust me, the camera is so much better now than it used to be.   Donald proved to be utterly useless and consistently died within the first 60 seconds of the fight   This is why you equip everything to Sora.  Donald dies too fast to make anything good be worth it applying it to him lol  So yeah, those were my thoughts as I was reading your article (I was typing this and reading at the same time).  Glad you're still enjoying it for the most part, and sincerely hope you stick with it! Looking forward to part 3"

Minor pieces of advice:  Gummi Ships: You're going to want to put as many Thunder (cannon) and Fire (engine) gummis as will fit on that thing. Makes those sections both go by faster, and become a lot more fun.  Camera: The default camera option is ""Auto,"" so you might want to go to Config (from the pause menu) and switch that to ""Manual,"" makes it a lot less frustrating."

You will very quickly find much better equipment than what is sold in the accessory shop for free by playing the game. And yes, equip all your best gear to Sora, as he is the only one whose death means ""Game Over."" Unless, of course, Donald and Goofy need more AP to use an abilty you want them to have, then it's better to give them the AP they need rather than goving Sora extra AP that he won't use."

KingdomHearts,3de8fk,Shredson,21,Wed Jul 15 16:11:57 2015 UTC,"I have a few issues with this article (makes me feel the person has no clue).   They claim that BBS and DDD are the most overlooked games in the series. I don't think either of those games are overlooked at all. There is absolutely no mention of Unchained chi aside from them saying there is one more game in Japan. That game is very important when it comes to KH3. This is a nitpicky one, but they are not clear about the ReMixes. They don't mention that 2 of the six games on those discs are cutscenes only. That's important for people looking to get into the series.   Other than that, the article is pretty solid, and I completely agree that there are a lot of cliffhangers that need to be fixed. That just means one MASSIVE game coming our way."
KingdomHearts,3de8fk,ShinyGoombah,12,Wed Jul 15 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"Hey there, Thanks for your response!    To be honest, these were always the two I heard the least about, which is what made me think that they were overlooked. I've only met one other person who played BBS, and absolutely no one who played DDD. I was speaking very generally. I know fans of the series love these games, and BBS is personally my favorite one.  To be honest, I couldn't find a lot of info on chi other than it being a browser game about the keyblade wars. But, you're right. I probably should have mentioned it more.  You caught me there. Ha ha. I thought about including that 358/2 days and Re:coded were movies, not gameplay, but ultimately left them out because I felt it wasn't as important to the point of the article.    Thank you for reading, and I really appreciate your feedback. :)"
KingdomHearts,3de8fk,ShinyGoombah,8,Wed Jul 15 16:30:55 2015 UTC,"Oh. Didn't know it was actually you who wrote it. Would have spoken to you more directly. Lol.   The biggest issue with people having played them before the remixes is that they were on the psp and 3ds, and a lot of people didn't wanna buy new systems to play the games on. That really is the base of the game, that would have been perfect if you added in something like. It really would be to let people know that Unchained chi is coming to America which is a mobile version of the browser game (with some changes). Yea, the only reason I cared is because how you wrote the article it did not appear to be aimed at people who were really familiar with the series, so if you told people they could get 6 games, and they got 4 games and 2 movies then that's sort of heartbreaking for those who don't actually read before purchasing (have been guilty in the past XD)"
KingdomHearts,3de8fk,TheDalekCaan,3,Wed Jul 15 16:55:00 2015 UTC,"Ha ha. I don't mind. I take feedback to heart, so all of it is important and used towards becoming a better writer. So, thank you for taking the time to talk to me! :D    That actually makes a lot of sense. The PSP is one of the least successful handhelds out there, and 3D came out a just after the 3DS had that huge price drop, so they still weren't very popular. You're absolutely right. It was a bit of an oversight on my part.  Ha ha. I didn't think of that. But, looking at the keepcase now, they really don't advertise that the DS games are just redone cutscenes, just that they have redone cutscenes."

Only reason I've been posting in this subreddit for the past week is because I picked up the 2.5 Remix recently and was dumbstruck that there was an entirely different Kingdom Hearts game I was never aware of - And it became my favorite of the entire series.

True, the heartless only start fighting/ reacting when they are in a certain radius of Sora, BUT ALL 1,000 ARE ONSCREEN, in the level, all at once, mostly doing idle animations, but are totally there nonetheless. The only caveat I can think of is them being 2D ish sprites at a certain distance, but even then they're the best looking sprites I've ever seen, with the most seamless 2D to 3D model transition I could possibly imagine. Either way they somehow totally got 1,000 enemies on screen all at once, and I just don't know how they did it. KH2 was just so ahead of its time."
KingdomHearts,3dfkea,leigonlord,3,Thu Jul 16 04:13:57 2015 UTC,"most of the heartless are just an animated 2d image i beleive. and the 2d to 3d thing is actually reallly noticeable once the numbers get down, they magically pop into existence and disappear from the background."

When people first played 2 just the sheer image of having all those enemies ostensibly on screen at once and beating them all must have been really epic, but when I played the game late last year I saw it as just sort of doing the same moves over and over again for too long.  To see something akin to a modern version of that would be astounding, in a generation where it's very hard to astound people and give them a high degree of control over the game at the same time."

KingdomHearts,3dj098,heart-station,6,Thu Jul 16 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"This article might suggest otherwise.  ' “Of course, Disney Interactive and Square Enix [are the] publisher,” Nomura said. “They’re combining their forces to bring Kingdom Hearts. So, the other associated companies under Disney [are] not something that is as simple as us consulting with Disney Interactive. So, unfortunately, the lineup is kind of considered as different.” ' (I think he ment difficult, but it's hard to tell)"
KingdomHearts,3dj098,LegoStevenMC,3,Thu Jul 16 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"I personally don't want Star Wars in KH3. To me, I don't think Star Wars really fits in with Kingdom Hearts. It just seems weird to have that universe put alongside all the animated Disney characters. I know this might not be a popular opinion but that's my two cents."
KingdomHearts,3dj098,ColdFire111,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:14:12 2015 UTC,It's not like its the first time. Star Wars is also not exclusively live action.
KingdomHearts,3dj098,TarotFox,4,Fri Jul 17 07:31:51 2015 UTC,"I hope not, I really don't want a Star Wars world. Traveling between worlds is a big aspect of Kingdom Hearts and space travel is very fleshed out in Star Wars. The whole traveling between worlds that makes Sora and his crew special would be whatever then. Deep Space is the world that could be comparable to a Star Wars world and they made that work, so who knows."
KingdomHearts,3dj098,tacobelltuesdays,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:44:47 2015 UTC,I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Frozen seems the most likely, since that movie was so popular here. Who know, maybe Star Wars, though. I think they'll save the release date until the Japan D23. I'd also love to see some of the characters besides Sora, Donald and Goofy (in that order)."
KingdomHearts,3dj098,theblackfool,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:09 2015 UTC,I would save Frozen for D23J. They loved that movie.

KingdomHearts,3dgruj,leigonlord,4,Thu Jul 16 07:47:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. That would mean they all had a very large amount of darkness in their hearts. For some of them, yeah. But Demys and Zexion? Nah."

KingdomHearts,3dgruj,beribboned,2,Thu Jul 16 03:53:54 2015 UTC,"I thought Sora wasn't able to retain his humanity, because there was such little darkness in his heart, he just became a shadow."
KingdomHearts,3dgruj,beribboned,12,Thu Jul 16 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"Weirdly, the only time this is discussed is in Chain of Memories, by Larxene and Axel:   Axel: There was a time he became a Heartless. And if one becomes a Heartless---  Larxene: They lose their minds and their feelings... They're consumed by the darkness.  Axel: Right. But not Sora. He held on to his feelings, even as a Heartless. And there's only one other man who's been able to do just that.  Larxene: It's the strength of his heart... That's what interests you. Why the Keyblade chose Sora's heart.  Axel: To unlock the mysteries of the heart. Isn't that the Organization's mission?"
KingdomHearts,3dgruj,Xynth22,3,Thu Jul 16 04:09:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think its been said anywhere, but the biggest theory is what beriboned said, and the type of heartless a person becomes is  based on how much darkness someone becomes. Which is why Sora became a Shadow because he had very little, and Xehanort kept his human form because he was mainly pure darkness."
KingdomHearts,3dgruj,Xynth22,2,Thu Jul 16 04:01:55 2015 UTC,Wouldn't ansem have just turned into a ginormous beast with so much darkness?
KingdomHearts,3dgruj,Sea-Salt,3,Thu Jul 16 04:04:04 2015 UTC,I imagine him giving up his heart willingly countered that.
KingdomHearts,3dgruj,SnowCone4673,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:14:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it has to do with the strength of his heart. It's the same case for nobodies; if one's created, only those with the strongest hearts will be able to retain a human form.  Considering Xehanort's a keyblade master, it's safe to say he's got a pretty damn strong heart, despite oozing with darkness."

KingdomHearts,3dgh30,theblackfool,2,Thu Jul 16 14:17:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, uh, guys? 358/2 Days is kinda important for the development of Roxas."

KingdomHearts,3dgh30,Ianbow,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"I would still it's sorta important because you need to know about Roxas who appears in KH2, RE:COM (ending), 358/2 Days, DDD, and Re:Coded (in his data form). Other than that, you don't really need 358/2 Days unless you are looking for some hot (and I mean, HOT) Sora on Sora action (Roxas and that girl whos-name-I-dont-know.)"
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,beribboned,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:19:02 2015 UTC,"err, Xion. Sorry, keeping in character."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,beribboned,5,Sat Jul 18 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"If you only play KH1, KH2, and BBS, you're going to miss a decent amount, yes. (Also, yes, Re:Chain of Memories is available for PS2! ... If you live in NA, at least.)  I would at least watch cutscenes (or Days and Re:Coded's movie versions) of the four games you're not planning on playing. (Especially Days and 3D - if you really hate the idea of watching a couple movies you could get away with just summaries for Re:CoM and Re:Coded, but I wouldn't really recommend it. I've got links for everything if you want me to dig them up.)   Barring that, if your computer can handle KH1/2 emulation, it can handle Days/Re:Coded emulation - Days, in particular, will honestly benefit from this. (Desmume x432R can upscale the models so they actually look decent, and a real controller is a lot less painful to use than a DS with that control scheme.)"
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,beribboned,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"But doesn't the second screen aspect of the DS kind of screw things up when you're using a controller? That's what was worrying me as well.   I'm using the PC version of 1.5 Remix with Steam Big Picture, and I'm worried that the DS titles will stick out too much like a sore thumb when playing on a big screen.  It's a shame that you can't play Dream Drop Distance on a PC for now, though. Perhaps Citra is released before KH3?"
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,bobguy117,2,Thu Jul 16 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"Not particularly - the only touchscreen aspect for Days is that you can use it to control the camera, if you want. Even on a DS, I prefer the shoulder-buttons camera control (... actually, you could probably map it to the right stick... hm). Past that, I think it's just used to display the map/objectives/how many chests are left for you to find. I think Re:Coded might use the touchscreen a little more heavily (maybe for the ability menu?), but I can't remember.  Here's some shots running at 2x window size, 4x internally: one, two, three. There's still pixelation - I can't remember if I had AAing on at all - but it doesn't look too bad, IMO."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,bobguy117,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look so bad, I think I'll give it a shot. I'm just not big on the cards aspect."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,bobguy117,2,Thu Jul 16 14:23:24 2015 UTC,"Days doesn't have a card aspect, thankfully - its controls are pretty plain, though they're awkward on the tiny DS buttons. Its big innovation is the panel system for items/abilities/spells, but aside from that it plays pretty much like KH1/2 (attack/item/magic menu, shortcuts available for magic)."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,SoraSono,3,Thu Jul 16 19:29:53 2015 UTC,Chain of Memories is essential for understanding the story of KH2 and beyond. 358/2 Days is essential for understanding the motives of Axel and Roxas in Dream Drop Distance and presumably in KH3. Re: Coded doesn't have a story except for one small scene if you play Chain of Memories and 358/2 Days another if you play Dream Drop Distance and X: Unchained.
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,Xeilith,2,Thu Jul 16 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"That being said, if you choose to skip Chain of Memories, you will only be as confused as every other character in the game is, which isn't necessarily a bad thing on your first playthrough of KH2."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,beribboned,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, I have finished KH2 a loooong time ago, but I didn't get any of the story. So I think I won't skip Chains of Memories."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,Xeilith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:24:50 2015 UTC,Good plan. The Chain of Memories story is my personal favorite. Gameplay I thought was fun for one playthrough.
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,leigonlord,2,Thu Jul 16 14:42:40 2015 UTC,Most of the late and current kingdom hearts games are available on YouTube as movie versions. People who do not own the systems required to play certain kh games usually use this option since it is free and you are basically watching the story unfold.
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,HaouLeo,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:21 2015 UTC,"Chain of Memories is a relatively simple story that's quite important to overall story.  358/2 days is as important as Chain of Memories to the Kingdom Hearts story.  Re:Coded is not very important to the story, and could probably be skipped without missing a thing."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,beribboned,2,Thu Jul 16 05:58:40 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, Re:Coded's worth watching the movie, at the very least. I'm pretty sure a bunch of its themes are going to end up important going forward (and it provides some neat additional context for 3D stuff)."
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,HaouLeo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:02:26 2015 UTC,I may have to watch it again then in that case.
KingdomHearts,3dgh30,beribboned,2,Thu Jul 16 06:06:40 2015 UTC,the very last part of recoded is the only important part.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,PieofUgin,10,Wed Jul 15 16:25:29 2015 UTC,"I don't want this for KH3. It's the last of the Xehanort saga, we need to finish the story rather than try to shake things up. Now, KH4, maybe."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,vegna871,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:23:13 2015 UTC,I think it will eventually happen if the KH series continues beyond III.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,McChumbly,0,Wed Jul 15 18:47:54 2015 UTC,I believe Nomura said this will be the last kingdom hearts game for sora meaning the story is gonna be wrapped up but they may still release new kingdom hearts games from a fresh start. I unfortunately don't have source for that cause I read this back when first trailer came out.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,AxonPotential,6,Wed Jul 15 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"I believe Nomura said this will be the last kingdom hearts game for sora   The opposite, actually. He said that Sora will always be the protagonist of the series. What KH3 will mark the end of is the Xehanort saga."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,ShinyGoombah,2,Thu Jul 16 01:54:06 2015 UTC,"As long as the franchise is profitable, Nomura will do whatever he can to keep the plot going. Seeing as Dissidia, Marvel, and Lucasfilm are relatively untapped, I don't think they will have an issue scraping together a few more worlds for additional KH games. I think it will be a long time before we see a console game though...the development process is just too long."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,3,Wed Jul 15 20:54:07 2015 UTC,This would be an idea if we didn't already know who the antagonists are going to be for KHIII. Lol
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,0,Wed Jul 15 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"They aren't very compelling antagonists, though. We went from a crayola variety pack to fifty shades of Xehanort. Adding some FF villains would at least add a few interesting boss battles outside of Xehanort clones."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,ryacoff,6,Wed Jul 15 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"They are vessels of Xehanort's heart, not carbon copies of him.  Isa will still fight like Isa.  Braig will still be Braig."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,JWR91,-6,Wed Jul 15 18:25:50 2015 UTC,Do two unique characters make six Xehanorts forgivable?
KingdomHearts,3deaau,thebardass,7,Wed Jul 15 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"I gave two examples you dolt.   The 13 vessels for obvious reasons are other people. Even his Heartless and Nobody have unique fighting styles.  Plus, we don't even know who all of the thirteen are yet. They aren't going to be carbon copies."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,-11,Wed Jul 15 18:39:15 2015 UTC,Chill out bro. No reason to resort to ad homs.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,thebardass,2,Wed Jul 15 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"Well, from what we know of the makeup of the Dark Vessels, we have the Master Xehanort, Young Xehanort, Xemnas, and Ansem SoD... all of whom have plenty of differences between them, including different voice actors, personalities, motivations, and fighting styles. To say that they are all the same person is technically correct, which is NOT the best kind of correct in this situation unfortunately.   Then you have Isa, Braig, and 7 other people that have yet to be specified. From the most recent trailer, it seems likely that Luxord (or at least, his human self... Droul?) as well as Vanitas are going to be among that number. Do any of them REALLY seem the same? We've fought against all of them... did any of them REALLY fight anything like any of the others?"
KingdomHearts,3deaau,theblackfool,2,Thu Jul 16 02:21:51 2015 UTC,"It would be very cool to have a council of FF villains like we saw with Disney in KH1, however what would be difficult would be ,measuring how powerful each is; who do you fight early game, and who do you fight late? I can see someone like Kuja being fought early game, where (arguably) he is the most powerful, technically. Maybe optional end game bosses like Sephiroth. I would like to see some more representation though."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,jazzyJXII,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"Sephiroth is everyone's darling little villain, and for good reason, but the mastermind of all masterminds in any FF universe has got to be Kefka. He would be a perfect final boss for a later title with a FF Council of Evil. Hypothetically speaking of course."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,QuestionsEverythang,5,Wed Jul 15 18:19:18 2015 UTC,Final boss? No. Why? Just because he needs to be the boss in Agrabah. Why? Sora gets sand on Kefka's boots.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,2,Wed Jul 15 18:27:32 2015 UTC,Lol. Just cause he's the final boss doesn't mean he can't be fought a few times.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,rd_Mars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:30:21 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd want him to be a final boss. I would prefer the MAIN baddies to still be original KH characters. Totally fine with an optional boss though.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Sea-Salt,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind fighting Cid Raines again. Even if he's not technically a villain.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,rd_Mars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:53 2015 UTC,He became a villain.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,2,Thu Jul 16 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"No. Hell, characters like Ultimecia, Kefka, Caius or Kuja would destroy the entire cast. I'd rather they not downplay some of my favorite antagonists."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,theblackfool,2,Wed Jul 15 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, but I think an interesting middle ground could be minor villains or grey-area antagonists from the FF series. Seifer growing up and causing a ruckus with Rai & Fu, The Turks slightly getting in Sora's way, Zorn & Thorn being A-holes. Al Bhed or Ronsos (Biran & Yenke), not being bad, but their stubbornness causes a problem that has to be dealt with."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,theblackfool,6,Wed Jul 15 17:22:10 2015 UTC,The Turks in KH would be worth it just for Reno meeting Lea.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"I DIDNT EVEN THINK OF THAT  Reno ""You're Lea, right?""  Lea ""You remembered my name?""  Reno ""Yea, I got it memorized."""
KingdomHearts,3deaau,gogojojo33,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:58 2015 UTC,Now this is a far better idea. I could get behind this. Especially Zorn and Thorn.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,2,Wed Jul 15 18:24:28 2015 UTC,I never knew how much I wanted Zorn and Thorn in KH til now.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,2,Wed Jul 15 18:31:00 2015 UTC,Pretty much. Kuja destroys an entire planet out of rage. That's power beyond Sora's.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,theblackfool,2,Wed Jul 15 17:04:15 2015 UTC,Exactly. Sora wouldn't even know how to even stand up to that much raw power.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,TriumphantBass,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:18 2015 UTC,He'd probably use his power of Friendship-Ex-Machina or something. That or the villain would suddenly forget he has that power
KingdomHearts,3deaau,theblackfool,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"Destiny Islands and several other worlds were destroyed in KH. In fact you could argue that the whole point of KH was putting the worlds back together. If anything, Sora is the one SE character--with his fuzzy-logic light magic--who can stand up to that sort of power. Same goes for Ultimecia: we already expect him to beat Xehanort's time compression..."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,theblackfool,4,Wed Jul 15 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"The world's are pulled into the darkness. Not destroyed. Not only that, it isn't a singular person destroying the world's. It's entire legions of Heartless. Sora has never faced a singular person capable of such destruction. Anyone he has faced has not destroyed a planet with raw power."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"""End of the World"" in the first installment seems to suggest otherwise. Though, really, the whole series is so internally inconsistent and convoluted that the worlds could be pulled into darkness or broken and scattered. To claim either way with certainty seems to be taking things way too seriously."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:23 2015 UTC,To claim they are dragged into darkness with certainty just means I paid attention. It's stated multiple times through the series.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Xephon7,-6,Wed Jul 15 19:05:32 2015 UTC,"Sephiroth destroys an entire planet. He's had several cameos and the KH universe is still intact. These appearances aren't necessarily canon, in fact I'd argue that a lot of the FF characters were intentionally infantilized for KH (see Tidus, Wakka, Selphie, Seifer, Fujin, Raijin, Y.R.P.). If Kefka or Ultimecia were included, their powers likely wouldn't extend beyond whatever arena we fight them in.  EDIT: Okay, so he almost destroyed an entire planet. Just like like Ultimecia almost brought about a singularity and Kefka almost became a god. It doesn't dilute my main point--peeps be powerful."
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Benny0,3,Wed Jul 15 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"Sephiroth does not destroy any planets. He tries, and fails. He does burn down a town though."

KingdomHearts,3deaau,gogojojo33,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:10:25 2015 UTC,Are we counting that move as canon? lol  I want to see what would happen if Bahamut ZERO's damage was what it showed.
KingdomHearts,3deaau,Sea-Salt,-4,Thu Jul 16 00:14:15 2015 UTC,So that still doesn't mean he lacks the ability to.

Sephiroth isn't as powerful as people seem to think. He's popular. That's it. I'd go as far as to say that's why he was chosen for KH. Because he is popular and not overly a threat to the KH universe. Unlike say, Kuja, who got pissed off and ravaged an entire planet.   I stand by my my original comment. Adding the other antagonists would require nerfing them to such a degree that they wouldn't really be the character anymore.  As for the Protagonists added to KH, outside of the ones used as Destiny Island citizens and YRP, they weren't really nerfed.  Edit: Sephiroth didn't almost destroy a planet. Jenova did.  Kefka didn't almost become a god. He did become a god."
KingdomHearts,3db64v,bobguy117,32,Tue Jul 14 22:28:50 2015 UTC,Never made the connection between Pluto and Hades before. That's hilarious.

KingdomHearts,3db64v,ChrisIsGettingFit,6,Fri Jul 17 19:48:15 2015 UTC,Pluto is Roman for the God Hades.  They are essentially the same God.  Just different names for different languages.    Hades= Greek Pluto= Roman
KingdomHearts,3db64v,OpinionsNotWelcome,2,Wed Jul 15 02:07:28 2015 UTC,Just different names for different languages.   That is where I was lost. Thanks!
KingdomHearts,3db64v,arthurazs,2,Wed Jul 15 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"On that same note, most planets are named for Roman gods. Jupiter = Zeus, Neptune = Poseidon, Mars = Ares, Mercury = Hermes, Venus = Aphrodite, and Saturn = Cronus. Many moons are named for minor Roman deities too, like our moon Luna/Diana = Artemis/Selene.  Uranus however is actually named for the Greek God of the heavens, aka Father Sky, who was Caelus in the Roman pantheon."

He's just toying with Cloud to corrupt him. I don't want his power downplayed by having Sora beat him in his final form. You know, the final form that destroys the sun and its entire solar system as one of his attacks.  If he's even in the game, I want the same as usual. He just fucks with you and is even more insanely hard to beat, then he just says some shit to Cloud or Tifa and peaces out."
KingdomHearts,3dd3h6,rd_Mars,2,Wed Jul 15 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"idk, if they have him I feel like they'd wrap up his plot with Cloud in this one."

This isn't FF VII, so the same events don't apply here. Is he literally Cloud's other half? What did he do with Zack? Why must you be a bitch to fight?"
KingdomHearts,3dd3h6,Sea-Salt,2,Wed Jul 15 21:49:42 2015 UTC,"Because FF =/= KH. Cloud never knew Zack. Sephiroth never killed Aerith.

EXTREMELY anecdotal,) is that I have a bit of an itch to perform, and sometimes I end up whistling/ humming whatever I'm listening to, and getting distracted by that.  I'd imagine finding something a bit less melodic like this would be a bit helpful, but it's kinda hard to test considering I'm currently on vacation. :/"

(Like OP, I never played any Final Fantasy games, so they were a complete mystery to me!), what a crazy ass dream! Why can't I go around killing things just yet? Is everyone aware that Donald and Goofy aren't human? You're in for a wild ride, /u/HawtSkhot, and it won't be long before you've spent hours and hours playing the games in this series!

KingdomHearts,3d7t6u,lyoncobalt,2,Tue Jul 14 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, I like the approach you are taking to describing your experience with the game. Definitely brings a lot of us back to when we played it the first time. I'll try to keep an eye out for your future posts.  Also, I noticed in the opening that FFIII was the only Final Fantasy you played. FFIX was always my personal favorite. It also has a very moody and whimsical style to it that captivated me in a way none of the other Final Fantasies really did. The character development is also great. If you ever feel like diving into a few FF titles 9 is my recommendation."
KingdomHearts,3d7t6u,remravenember,2,Tue Jul 14 14:57:47 2015 UTC,This was a great read! I'm really looking forward to hear your opinions as you trek through the rest of the game. Good job!

But I loved every minute of my KH2 plat run. It never got old. I started on Critical and did all of the boss fights on that difficulty. It might have been faster to speed run beginner and try them then, but I couldn't bring myself to do it."
KingdomHearts,3dbh3b,snazzysnorlax,2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I did all the bosses and stuff on Proud. I'll eventually go and do it on Critical, but for the trophy I figured proud would be good enough. Lol"
KingdomHearts,3dbh3b,snazzysnorlax,2,Wed Jul 15 01:13:15 2015 UTC,Haha definitely. And you've already gone through it on proud. So at least you won't have to play through the whole thing again. You can get right to the post game goodness
KingdomHearts,3dbh3b,theblackfool,2,Wed Jul 15 01:15:37 2015 UTC,"Nice! As of right now I only have the plat for KH1, but I'll get them all! Do you have any others? What's the hardest/easiest so far?"
KingdomHearts,3dbh3b,theblackfool,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"I have gotten KH1 as well. I would say the hardest one will probably be Chain of Memories (I'm not going to put myself through that). It may arguably be tied with Birth By Sleep, but that's because BBS you have to complete the journal on all three characters. The easiest would have to be tied again between KH1 and KH2 imo. They both have their annoyances, but it's not the worst thing ever. Kingdom Hearts 1 you have to play it through three times for the different trophies, and the gummi ship missions SUCK. Kingdom Hearts 2 has the data battles and Lingering will which can be very infuriating."

KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,Heat55wade,17,Mon Jul 13 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Absolutely mandatory. One of the best voices in the series.
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,rd_Mars,8,Mon Jul 13 18:21:59 2015 UTC,Definitely. I felt her voice fit the role perfectly
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,Heat55wade,2,Mon Jul 13 18:50:02 2015 UTC,Seeing her on Arrow and then seeing her as Aqua makes me respect her so much as an actress.  She does both roles awesomely.
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,Ianjh,2,Mon Jul 13 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"I do, too! I actually think it's highly likely that she will be as well.   Remember, it's been confirmed that voice-work for KHIII started right around mid-July...the same time they started voicing 2.5 Re:Coded in English. (Goofy's VA even said on Twitter that he was doing voice-work for KHIII right around then, as well) Holland reprised Aqua for a couple lines for BBSFM's Secret Episode but I don't think she came back just for those few lines. Much like Ben Diskin's YX, I think she also did voicework for KHIII in addition to Re:Coded, which is great because - besides some pretty awful line reads (But hey, the writing in BBS isn't fantastic, so I cut her some slack) - I really enjoyed her role.   This also says to me that most of the actors that they got to play certain characters in Re:Coded & KHIIFM are more than likely returning as well. (They got a new VA for Alice; Iago, Genie & Jafar returned which means Agrabah might; Olympus Coliseum obviously will and even the VAs of Vexen, Zexion & Braig did some lines, so I think those are all safe bets...on top of the obvious characters like Sora, Riku, Mickey, Donald, etc.)"
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,Kaweebo,8,Mon Jul 13 23:22:43 2015 UTC,it's been confirmed that voice-work for KHIII started right around mid-July     So...it just started? Or did you mean July of last year?    EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes on the serious question here.
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,QuestionsEverythang,0,Mon Jul 13 18:50:36 2015 UTC,"That's definitely not true. Goofy's VA was talking about some other game I remember (might've been 2.5, can't remember off-hand but you can look it up). The voice acting (especially the English voice acting) is one of the very final things they do. The odds are grossly against us that the script is even finished, let alone the Japanese dub or even more so the English dub."
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,noxnsol,2,Mon Jul 13 19:45:26 2015 UTC,"It definitely is true, actually. Bill Farmer, Goofy's VA, was talking about finishing up KHIII's voice-acting specifically. (He also said he thought it'd release in 2015, so he's not entirely trustworthy in that regard, and he retracted that specific statement) I don't really believe that he's finished voice-work for KHIII, it's possible that he simply finished up 2.5 and couldn't tell the difference. Ben Diskin (the voice of Young Xehanort) made it clear in a recent interview that the voice-directors don't tell the actors anything with regards to that. http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/goofy-voice-actor-claims-kingdom-hearts-3-coming-this-year  But I remember specifically both him and Haley Joel Osment saying that voice work for KHIII in particular would begin mid-2014, around July or August. Add to that the fact that they were also doing work for Re:Coded AND the KHIII trailer has English voice-work done for it already and that tells me that some of the actors have been voicing lines since at least that point in time. I also seriously doubt they would call in several Disney talents and Willa Holland for 4 or 5 lines each, just to call them back in for KHIII later.  Voice-work is definitely one of the last things they do, but it's not the last thing. The game hasn't ended development yet and already there are signs that voice-work has been in production for a while."

My honest guess is that they are going to talk more about things such as the combat, and the outfit. I think if they were going to announce a release date they would have done it at E3."
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,ShinyGoombah,6,Tue Jul 14 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is going to be as much info at the America event. I feel as if we might get a release date at the Japan D23. Someone asked Nomura about the release date and he said:   We've reached an agreement, but I still can't say anything. I plan to give new information at the Kingdom Hearts Fan Event that will be held on the 3rd of November."
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,Beipiaosaurus,5,Mon Jul 13 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"Yea. The third of november. Not the 16th of August  EDIT: Ok. So, just read your comment again and realized you were agreeing with me XD. I originally read it as you disagreeing. Whoops"

KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,Beipiaosaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:16 2015 UTC,Seriously. I'm broke as a joke right now but I'm thinking maybe this special guest would warrant a drive up to Anaheim and a D23 ticket.
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,wonderbrian,5,Mon Jul 13 18:05:39 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how to explain this, but I'd rather hear about the game specifics than the story.  You know, confirmation of features in the game like new or returning drive forms, maybe a short exposure of the combat. I want them to try and show us how the game feels when you're swinging the key around (weighty-ness of KH1 vs KH2, hitstun and knockback on enemies, fall speed, stuff like that).  I do NOT want any story elements exposed, and if you're going to show off new worlds, gimme ones I'm going to run into very early. I want to know how the game looks and feels, but be completely in the dark about what's in it."
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,radios_appear,10,Tue Jul 14 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"I hope they make it so when you get a new teammate in a world they become the 4th member of the team as opposed to replacing Goofy or Donald. If not that, at least so the the new member is not required to be in your party to advance the story. This was one of the only things i didn't like in the kingdom hearts series. Even in the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 when Riku joins up with you, i feel it would have been a lot more bad ass if you can keep both Goofy and Donald plus Riku."
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,tacobelltuesdays,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:05:35 2015 UTC,"While this would be awesome, it goes against the Kingdom Hearts gameplay. You've always been limited in who you can take with you (which doesn't make sense story wise since everyone is in the cutscenes) and it adds a sense of choice and pseudo-strategy. What I want is for it to actually matter who you have take with you. Besides drive forms, it has never really made a difference who is in your party. But since they're ""improving AI"", I'm hopeful it'll make a difference."
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,snazzysnorlax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only thing i don't like is instances where you dont think it matters who is in your team but you need them for something little, such as having Aladdin in the Cave of Wonders so Abu could activate those monkey statues. Glad to hear they are improving AI, is that new news?"
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,tacobelltuesdays,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:25:27 2015 UTC,"They mentioned it during E3 this year, but I don't have a link to any interviews. Not sure if they mentioned it before then or not. I'm glad you brought up Aladdin in the Cave of Wonders, cause that's always my first  thought, too! But thinking back, did you ever HAVE to use him to move statues for story, or was it all for hidden treasure that didn't really matter? I can never remember, cause I always just did all of them lol"

KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,snazzysnorlax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:44:54 2015 UTC,My point is that Herc does exactly what /u/tacobelltuesdays suggests. You have SDG + Herc. No reason it couldn't be SDG + Aladdin or SDG + Flynn. Especially when the Mulan cutscenes show that the whole party is fighting together. And it doesn't really go against KH gameplay. We've had special members before. The prelude to the Battle of 1000 heartless is another.

KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,QuestionsEverythang,6,Mon Jul 13 19:17:57 2015 UTC,Sort of like 3D's system - don't drop me in the middle of a fucking boss fight - let me run through each mission individually without having to load a new file.  That perfect balance between the two...

When the Saber comes into view it would look like the end of a key, and the epic kingdom Hearts trailer music will play as they show off a star wars world, maybe extra."

KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,Prince_AJ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:18:06 2015 UTC,"Don't think there will be a release date at this event. Here's what I'm expecting: A new trailer featuring a new world, hopefully with a finalized UI design in place. Then, during the D23 event this fall in Japan they will announce the release date. Why do I say this? Because in an interview, Nomura was asked if there was a release date yet, and he said that they had one but they weren't ready to share it yet and to wait until the Japanese D23 event this fall for more info...I mean, you don't really have to read between the lines TOO much to see what he's hinting at here...  The way I see it, Square-Enix's two big new games, KH3 and FFXV, are nearing completion. FFXV's release date will be announced at Gamescom in a few months, and KH3's announced a few months after that at the Japanese D23. Because of the state of KH3's development, though, they don't need to skip any promotional events; they have enough stuff ready to show now. So going to the D23 event in Anaheim is a no-brainer, even though they aren't ready to announce the release date yet."

On an unrelated note, I like the theory that each keyblade transformation is tied to a world and that the dual wield is Guardians of the Galaxy a la Peter Quill."
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,heart-station,-5,Mon Jul 20 10:17:28 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for a re-do on Sora's outfit and hair. I might be in the minority but I really don't like his design and am hoping it's not final
KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,salemthewitch,-9,Mon Jul 13 22:19:17 2015 UTC,"I... I... I want Sora to make out with Riku, with Kairi ""accidentally"" watching / hidden somewhere. Many of us played KH 1 when we were 10-13 and now that we're all grown up, we want to see the true bro-mance happen. **edit: not trolling, very serious... gaymers ftw"

KingdomHearts,3d5h1l,rd_Mars,2,Mon Jul 13 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"Let's burst this bubble.    Sora didn't know Kairi was missing. He thought she was safe on the island.  When he did find out, he got on his knees and begged Saïx for her.  While he knew Kairi was alive, he had no fucking clue if his best friend was dead or had been corrupted by evil or lost in the realm of darkness forever or what. He had seen Mickey who had told him nothing, which doubtless increased his anxiety. Plus his sobs could just as easily been worrying if Riku would ever get to look like Riku again: remember when they meet again, Riku had the form of Ansem SOD.    Now, I'm not saying that Sora can't be gay or bisexual, but that particular instance is not acceptable proof of it."

KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,Zephyrus_808,12,Mon Jul 13 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that RCs made fights like the Org fights AWESOME. I mean, running up a skyscraper was badass.  One thing I would suggest is making it so that regular enemies didn't have them. It was cool that they nobodies matched up with organization members, but they didn't need to have their RCs.  I honestly think that your suggested changes should be split into two different possible fixes. One possible fix be the punishing for bad timing, and smaller windows. The second possible fix be the less damage, and only after precision. If I have to guard to do a reaction command, then have precise timing, and do less damage, I'll just use attacks, summons, limits, and magic instead.  Also, it's Nomura sooo RCs may not be coming back, but that doesn't mean a variation of it won't. ;)"
KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,ShinyGoombah,2,Mon Jul 13 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"I did think about splitting the changes into several possible fixes (an 'either or' situation) but I was just throwing some ideas out there - after all, I'm not a part of the development team so I don't really know what would be best for the game. I realise that if we nerfed every aspect of the RC then there would be no point of them other than to watch a flashy cutscene, which would also make them unhealthy for the game.  Ultimately I hope Nomura changes his mind on this and that some form of interactive cinematic sequence will return for fights.  EDIT: I'd like to add that although the Nobody RCs were unnecessary, I felt like they served as a way of introducing that specific RC for the corresponding Org XIII member e.g. I knew how to use Berserk against Saix because the game tells us that that specific RC is an easy way of dealing with the Nobodies he controls."
KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,Jamaz,5,Mon Jul 13 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"I always felt the reaction commands in KH2 were way too gratuitous in terms of ease of use. You never felt like you earned it, just ""oh, the designer really wants me to see this fancy sequence"".  I think it'd be great if the reaction commands made a comeback but were less frequent and became seamless action sequences. E.g:   Reaction command for Pegasus where instead of just mashing triangle for free, invincible hits, you actually guide pegasus and are given 3 different attacks. In the Sora / Xemnas ""face off"", initiate and make the character automatically rush forward, but direct the player to hold a button and release to ""draw the keyblade"" at the right time - too early or too late and you take massive damage instead.   Pretty much a more interactive minigame that takes more than toddler button mashing would be satisfying."
KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,EdgeJosh,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it probably would've been better game design overall to include different mechanics for several of the commands in the game (e.g. your idea for Pegasus, and sort of like when you control Riku, too), but IMO that might be a bit 'information overload' for the player, especially if they're new to the series or relatively inexperienced gamers. I think KH2 was already quite a complex game compared to the original in the sense that you had all these extra mechanics (RCs, Drive Forms, Limits) - to add more of these 'new control systems' for certain segments of a fight could prove to be a bit much. I liked the idea for the face-off though - keep the RCs, but make them more varied in terms of which buttons you press, how they're pressed (single press, mash or hold, etc.)"
KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,EdgeJosh,3,Mon Jul 13 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"It made everything so cool, I guess the final lazer dome scene was a reaction command as well and thats one of my favourite memories from the games, spamming to reflect those lazers."
KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,Nilepac,2,Mon Jul 13 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly. If someone asks, 'Hey, remember that fight?', you can say, 'Yeah, wasn't that the one where X sequence happened?'  I'm as hyped for KH3 as anybody, but it would be really if the combat became somewhat mundane due to the removal of RCs. Hopefully they're thinking of some sort of alternative over at Square Enix (I suppose the fight teased in the trailer with Rock Titan had a similar 'cinematic' feel)."
KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,Jeremywarner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, I also dont think they make the fights easier, you have to work to get to the reaction command and when you do it feels epic because you are doing something you cant do with the mechanics of the game."
KingdomHearts,3d4mfo,BiiaatchProper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:40:26 2015 UTC,"The problem a lot of people had with it was precisely that you didn't have to work for it in a lot of fights. In the Axel fight (as Roxas), you didn't have to do anything to get the command which clears out the fire from the arena. But I agree - watching Sora do something which the game doesn't usually allow you makes the game very pleasant on the eye."

KingdomHearts,3d52u6,dustymons,8,Mon Jul 13 16:17:50 2015 UTC,The goal of collecting hearts was a ruse from the start. He wanted everyone in the organization to think they had no hearts to make it harder for them to regrow hearts so that he could sick parts of xehanort in them without them knowing. He probably didn't use his keyblade against Sora and Co. to keep up the ruse.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,invelios,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"Well, he still actually wanted to summon kingdom hearts so that he could give everyone Xehanort's heart, right? So regardless of his motives, he would have benefited from using his keyblade."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,invelios,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:57 2015 UTC,Except some of the organization knew Xehanort as only Ansem's apprentice and might get suspicious of Xemnas all of a sudden having a keyblade.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Ekyou,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"Huh, never thought of that. That actually makes a lot of sense. Well regardless, it's practically confirmed that Xehanort will be ripping his keyblade out in KH3."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,invelios,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:39:53 2015 UTC,Terra-Xehanort used Xehanort's keyblade to turn the rest of Ansem's apprentices into Nobodies so they are aware that he can use one.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,JohnRosen,3,Mon Jul 13 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Did we ever see how he did that though? The only one we know sees him is braig, who knew the whole time anyways. The rest we only see lying on the floor. It is possible he ambushed them and knocked them out before using the keyblade while they where unconscious."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,invelios,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:47:04 2015 UTC,Pretty sure there's a scene where he reks them all.

KingdomHearts,3d52u6,beribboned,3,Mon Jul 13 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"Which, to me, says that he definitely can use it. If the answer was ""he can't"" then he'd just say that, I think."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,ZeroAbomination,7,Tue Jul 14 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when Nomura's cagey like that the answer tends to be ""yes, but I'm being vague on purpose to fuck with you."""
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Xephon7,4,Tue Jul 14 00:55:09 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that he just doesn't want to use one. I mean dual Lightsaber hands > giant Key seriously.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,bajuwa,5,Mon Jul 13 22:09:36 2015 UTC,Just because a nobody can grow a heart doesn't mean he did gain one.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,TarotFox,3,Mon Jul 13 16:19:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I thought it was said that it's more an automatic thing. When a body is missing a heart, a new one just kinda ""grows"" in its place."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,TarotFox,2,Mon Jul 13 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Growth speeds may differ, or just be very long."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,TarotFox,2,Mon Jul 13 16:27:07 2015 UTC,That does make sense. Like maybe your contact with emotional things is what makes you develop a heart? Like how Roxas' heart was completed after a friend died.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,EnlightenedModifier,2,Mon Jul 13 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"None of that is quiiiite confirmed. Xion's death awakened his ability to dual wield, but it's still honestly in the air if he has his own heart or is just using Ven's still. We know that the dual-wielding is Sora and Ven's keyblades."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Sipricy,2,Tue Jul 14 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"I'd think it's pretty much confirmed after all the emotions Roxas showed in 358 / 2 and KH2. Then Xehanort went and upfront told us that nobodies will grow hearts. C'mon man, Roxas cried through Sora right after the tutorial. That's ""I have a heart"" material right there."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Stronkadonk,2,Tue Jul 14 04:55:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he doesn't have emotions. Nobodies grow hearts to fill an absence, but Roxas never had one."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Xephon7,2,Tue Jul 14 05:09:00 2015 UTC,But the problem is that you need a heart to feel emotion in the KH world.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Stronkadonk,2,Tue Jul 14 05:19:02 2015 UTC,"...Yes, and he has Ven's.   Edit: I see someone else has mentioned it already, but yes, that's what I am saying. Ven's heart was in Roxas the whole time, which is why Roxas looks like Ven."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Xephon7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:07:43 2015 UTC,Where was that confirmed?
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,TarotFox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, and he's saying that he possibly had Ven's."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Cryptonix,2,Tue Jul 14 05:53:02 2015 UTC,oooohhhhhhhhhhhhh that..... might make sense in such a confusing world. Well okay.
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,leigonlord,2,Tue Jul 14 05:54:14 2015 UTC,"Considering Xemnas is one of the 13 Darknesses, I think he does still have some of Xehanort's heart within him.  Not to mention, he still had SOME memories of his past."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Cryptonix,2,Mon Jul 13 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"He didn't become a vessel of Xehanort till after though.  As for memories, that wasn't exactly unusual for Nobodies. Most had some shards of memory left."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,leigonlord,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"Until after what though?  I think he had retained some of his heart the entire time, although if you are implying he got it when he became part of the Squad in DDD, well...  not sure when exactly they pulled Xemnas from his own timeline.  Also, he DID use Keyblade Armor against Sora and Riku, so...  Yeah, but weren't memories associated with their hearts?"
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,Cryptonix,2,Mon Jul 13 16:42:36 2015 UTC,"Wibbly Wobbly. He could have been yanked from any point in time, but the fact stands that the version Riku and Sora fought did not have a heart nor keyblade.  The armor doesn't require a Keyblade. It's just armor."
KingdomHearts,3d52u6,leigonlord,2,Mon Jul 13 18:01:55 2015 UTC,The quote from Nomura discussing how he was more so choosing not to use the Keyblade is from before KH3D.

In Radiant Gardens where you fight the armor, you can defeat all the waves with two Mega Flares.  For bosses, it depends which character you are playing, however get Renewal Block on everyone. Ven should get Time Splicer and Salvation, Terra get Meteor, and Aqua Magic Hour. For many fights Thunder Surge is the best commands, especially in Olympus and with the optional boss after the game. My favorite commands are Seeker Mine and Mine Square.  P.S. I use this chart when melding."

KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Xephon7,10,Mon Jul 13 14:36:14 2015 UTC,"Not from my understanding. IIRC, they just need pure darknesses and pure lights. Not necessarily Keyblades."
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,JonJonFTW,5,Mon Jul 13 14:40:12 2015 UTC,Nomura has confirmed that Lights or Darknesses don't necessarily have to be keyblade wielders.
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Stronkadonk,4,Mon Jul 13 16:49:52 2015 UTC,"That answers my question, thanks!"
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Xephon7,3,Mon Jul 13 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"Braig specifically took on Xehanort's heart to obtain a keyblade for himself though.

KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Stronkadonk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:28:28 2015 UTC,"I don't recall any of the games ever stating Braig has a Keyblade.   Also, why shouldn't Young Xehanort have had a Keyblade? He was still raised as a Keyblade wielder, and in his life time at some point gaining the rank of Master. I hardly see any reason why YX wouldn't have one."
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Xephon7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"Unless Xehanort was lying, when he put part of his heart within Braig, it allowed him to wield a keyblade - this is part of the deal they made.  Now, Xehanort is a devious son of a bitch, so he could easily be lying, but Braig is just as devious and I don't think he'd fall into a simple trap so easily.  Young Xehanort from DDD was still from Destiny Islands, was he not?  Before he acquired his keyblade?"
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Stronkadonk,3,Mon Jul 13 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"We know that Xehanort theorized Braig would receive a Keyblade. We have yet to see if it worked or if he just became another Vessel.   As for Young Xehanort, we have no idea when he first became a Keyblade wielder, so its entirely possible he had a Keyblade back on Destiny Island. We won't know until KHIII most likely. I'm personally willing to bet that Young Xehanort is just the version of himself just after giving in to darkness. Just my personal view and prediction."
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Xephon7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:55:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd throw money on Braig having faith in that he would get one - his actions in KH2FM, the secret ending to coded, and DDD all indicate that he is scheming hardcore.  I would smash my head through a wall if he set up some elaborate plan and ended up failing because he had too much confidence he too would be given an oversized key.  Well, I was kinda given the impression Xehanort hadn't had outside contact at that point - talking about how his world is just too small made me think that he was like Riku, Kairi and Sora; knowing there were other worlds, but not yet able to venture outside of them.  Not to mention, he used his ethereal blades when in combat in the Land of Departure, as well as when he was manipulating time in DDD - additionally, the keyblade he uses in DDD is a combination of Master Xehanort's keyblade and wibbly wobbly timey wimey... stuff...  I don't think he had seen the Forteller's keyblade at that point (as it was clearly kept with their Master/within the castle they were apprentices in), and we know Master Xehanort took over his body to allow him to move even though everything was in limbo at that point.  Just my opinions as well; we shall definitely have our answers when KHIII comes out though!  Can't wait to see which one of us is right, if both of us are still alive fourty years from now!"
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Kaweebo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"The whole being isolated to the island bit doesn't stick though, as you don't necessarily need to have been to other words to get a Keyblade. Sora bad never left Destiny Islands when he got his. It's still entirely possible he got one, and thus began his curiosity at the possibility of other worlds and such."
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,nyxcrisis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"They're all clones of Xehanort (or will be, anyway) so shouldn't their Keyblades all just be copies of MX's Keyblade?"

KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Fatliner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"We don't know the context of it though. For all we know, its similar to D-Drive or a summon type thing. We are in the dark about those guns until we get more info."
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Stronkadonk,2,Mon Jul 13 16:04:11 2015 UTC,Doesn't Xehanort state (in BBS) that the Keyblade War will be recreated when Kingdom Hearts is opened and all the lifeless keys in the keyblade graveyard will come to life again? Wouldn't that mean that possibly all the souls lost in the keyblade war will come back and start fighting again?
KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Xynth22,2,Tue Jul 14 04:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well maybe the Keys, but the souls? I doubt that. We just have to wait and see what happens in 3."

KingdomHearts,3d4otp,Iimetime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:28:49 2015 UTC,"Well that kind of depends on whether this will be a Keyblade war, or just a war between the Light and the Dark. If it is a Keyblade war, I imagine they would need them. There is just one issue. Can a heartless use a Keyblade? If they can't, then Ansem, Seeker of Darkness will be without a Keyblade which means it will be 12 Keyblade wielders on the dark side vs the 7 on the light side."

KingdomHearts,3d4otp,OldAgeandGoodHours,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"I think that they will, but I don't really have any proof that they will. Just kind of seems weird not to use a Keyblade if you can wield one. I mean, just because it's a Keyblade doesn't mean it has to be used like a, well, blade. Sora can change one of his Keyblades into guns for cryin' out loud, and even in KH2 in Wisdom Form he basically used his Keyblade like a gun."

KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,MableDONKEY,7,Mon Jul 13 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"All we know is that he was 'conscious' inside of Terra-Xehanort's body even when he had amnesia. (Blank Points shows him & MX holding a conversation within) But after Xehanort split himself into Ansem and Xemnas, it's up in the air. It's possible that Terra's heart went with Xemnas (which is why he still held some feelings of attachment for Aqua & Ventus) and looks more like Terra than Ansem did, but obviously he wasn't in control of Xemnas.   Now that MX has re-joined, there's really no way of knowing. Really, after Ansem & Xemnas' defeat, Terra-Xehanort should have reconstituted instead of MX, so it's possible that Xehanort simply used the darkness to transform himself back into his older form even though he's technically still got Terra's heart inside of him. Time will tell."

KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,iSevenfold762,3,Mon Jul 13 21:50:06 2015 UTC,Of course he is! Why wouldn't he be able to?
KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,TarotFox,2,Mon Jul 13 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"Isn't the whole reason he can because of Ventus? That's what I thought anyways. So I guess, imagine if Vens heart leaves, wouldn't his Keyblade go too?  Or maybe Soras heart has the ability too, maybe Vens heart rubbed off on him."
KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,leigonlord,6,Mon Jul 13 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"He's responsible for Sora being able to dual-wield, but not wield the Keyblade at all.

KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,Omegathekid,3,Tue Jul 14 02:43:14 2015 UTC,"sora has his own keyblade, the reason he can dual wield is because of ven as its one keyblade per heart"

KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,leigonlord,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:29:25 2015 UTC,But what about when Riku (during the Session limit) takes Sora's Keyblade with his own? Does that count as dual-wielding?
KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,Your_Window_Peeper,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:42:32 2015 UTC,that counts as sora not recalling the keyblade

KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,Larronos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:50:11 2015 UTC,"Because Ven is inside Sora, the keyblade was lured to him. At first Sora was mooching off of Ven's ability to hold the keyblade, but at some point Sora's earned it and it's his own. That doesn't mean Ven's ability is gone. It just means he let Sora borrow his ability."

KingdomHearts,3d5pbs,beribboned,3,Mon Jul 13 19:29:45 2015 UTC,How would Terra's heart have gotten into Sora? Xehanort's trying to wake Ven inside Sora with that conversation; it's entirely possible he was just transparently hinting at Vanitas.

Aqua ends up trapped in the darkness, Ven spends twelve years asleep in one of the most neutral worlds we know of, and Terra's still technically in the realm of light through KH2 (I guess it gets a little weaker here since TWTNW is also an in-between world, but, whatever).  Interestingly, there may have been plans for at least Kingdom Key and Kingdom Key-D to be obtainable in BBS? I've definitely seen hacks of Ven wielding Mickey's, and I think they may have mentioned there being properly scaled versions for other character/s in the game (but this was a couple years ago, so I could be misremembering that part)."

Still doesn't explain why they are in the scene itself, I cant remember but were they in the original secret scene from the PS2 version? Teasing time travel maybe ?  The KK-D in BBS stuff is interesting though, would love to know more about it. Seems to be the most unique keyblade bar Sora's (and Xeharnort's Obviously) as mickey just took it from the RoD, always wondered if/why it chose him.

KingdomHearts,3d0qcx,gabriel_larkins,6,Sun Jul 12 15:58:44 2015 UTC,For me goofy would help a lot. I always switch out Donald. His constant healing as soon as I use cure/healing items on myself really pissed me off.. His timing was horrible 95% of the time for me.

KingdomHearts,3d0qcx,xTerraTerrariax,6,Mon Jul 13 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I never use any of the quest party members, except Tron because his limit is ridiculously overpowered.  If I were to swap someone out, if I wanted to use the quest party members limit or whatever, it would be Donald. I will NEVER go to Wisdom Form when killing mobs or bosses (excluding Demyx and the XIII Mushrooms) but I use Valor very often - in fact, it's the most used form for me after Platinuming the game."
KingdomHearts,3d0qcx,Irignation,2,Sun Jul 12 17:23:34 2015 UTC,Why not master or final?
KingdomHearts,3d0qcx,th30be,3,Sun Jul 12 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"Because I can level up Valor form anywhere.   Master Form and Final Form have very specific ways to level them, so I leave them for when I've beaten the game. I can level up Master Form from 0 to 7 in less than 10 minutes, and grinding Final Form only becomes efficient once you've beaten Xemnas 1.  Don't get me wrong, Final Form is the best form in the game. I was simply implying that when I was grinding through the story, I sticked to Valor Form exclusively to lessen the amount of time needed to grind Drive Form levels later on in the game - because it's the only form that you can level up anywhere, any time."

KingdomHearts,3d0qcx,Phoxxent,3,Sun Jul 12 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"In KHI, I tended to avoid swapping party members due to Trinity Limits requiring the main trio.  In KHII, if I was forced to swap I typically swapped Donald (enabling me to still use Valor), but I did swap Goofy on worlds where Valor was less helpful or not available (Pridelands)."
KingdomHearts,3d0qcx,Raeil,3,Mon Jul 13 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"For KH1, I always switch out Donald because Goofy's Evolution and MP Gift are way too helpful to sacrifice (He's also the first person to get Lucky Strike, which is always nice).

KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,macnbloo,17,Sun Jul 12 06:03:40 2015 UTC,"I think the community should be allowed to sort itself out (to an extent). I've eased a lot on what is allowed on the sub (like allowing the millionth Keychain post), because it just seems like that's the nature of the beast, so it's not worth fucking with it and dealing with the inevitable backlash from the righteous anti censorship warriors who believe posting on a sub is a human right. I'd rather just let you guys down vote it and move on.   Edit: not to mention the token ""this sub has no content, you should be glad for any submissions"" comment"
KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,the_dinks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:15:41 2015 UTC,Maybe have it petition style so you can propose a change and get people to decide based on votes whether or not they want to implement it. And if it reaches the number you specified in the beginning it goes through
KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,the_dinks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"We've actually been talking about this issue a lot on the /r/defaultmods slack. In general, part of being a good mod is standing up to ""OMG REMOVING MY SHITTY POST = CENSORSHIP!!!!"" but it's definitely very tiring. One option you could have is making /r/KH_AVI or whatever and redirecting all posts there. Another is making a weekly post about it.   In general tho, I tend to not like people who downvote content they don't want to see. Downvoting is for people who misuse the site. I'd rather upvote the things I like.   The flairs are dope, btw."
KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,the_dinks,10,Sun Jul 12 06:18:45 2015 UTC,"In that case, another user can make an AMV subreddit if they want because I can't be bothered to make another for something I don't care for.   And yes, it can be tiring but I think the crux of the issue is that curating consists of a lot of what amounts to arbitrary evaluation, and people really do not like that. There's also an issue when what I consider bad content does not fall in line with a sufficient majority of the sub. What consists of a ""shitpost?"" We'd have to lay out an explicit policy that I don't think people will ever reach a consensus on. In the mean time, I don't think the bad content is stopping the good from getting posted so where's the real issue?   That being said, I think AMVs fucking suck in general. I quite enjoy Kingdom Hearts, but a lot of the fan culture makes me cringe."
KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,the_dinks,5,Sun Jul 12 06:35:10 2015 UTC,"We all know AMV's suck, so let's just get that out of the way.  My #1 advice is have a rule that lets you do whatever you want. It's like your elastic clause. In a sub like this, yes – you are the curator. So don't let yourself feel guilty when you're making the experience good for others.   In the mean time, I don't think the bad content is stopping the good from getting posted so where's the real issue?   I agree most of the time but if I came to a gaming sub and saw a bunch of shitty AMV's highly upvoted I would probably not subscribe. It's your subreddit, though, and if that's your choice then that's your choice. Don't get caught up too much in what the people say they want – do what you think is best for them. It's kind of a benevolent dictatorship.  P.S I always love talking about this stuff, great conversation. I hereby formally request you write about this topic for /r/moderatorplatform :^)"

I think striking a happy balance between curating and allowing users to do it themselves is better. By the way, I've always had that elastic clause in place. We do still moderate on personal judgment, we just haven't done too much of it as of late. In the past we've enacted temporary bans. I won't do that this time, but I'll keep it mind and keep the page a little cleaner if that sounds fair."

This sub should promote interesting OC and discussion. The ""ask questions here to get on the same page before KH3"" is a good thread that could probably be stickied. There are constantly people asking for help understanding something, and that's totally justified. It would be great to have it all in one place to 1) keep the sub organized and 2) have one place that somebody could go and get a bunch of confusing things cleared up.  I love Kingdom Hearts.

KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,Uk72,9,Sun Jul 12 06:55:38 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly like AMVs, nor do I watch them, but because everyone deserves a defense I'm going to provide one.   There's lots of content on here that some people may like, and other people may dislike. Some people may dislike the ""look what I found cleaning my garage"" post which contains Brady Games KH1 Guide. Some people might hate the ""Finally got my [insert Trophy Here]"" posts with a screenshot took on a potato.   What I'm getting at is that it's all perspective on what the community decides what it likes or doesn't like. That's why Reddit had the upvote system. The issue is that (most unfortunately) this sub doesn't have a massive amount of consistent content. It's relatively small, so sometimes there's a solid overlap between ""new"" and ""hot"". If there's an AMV and you don't like it, then DONT UPVOTE IT! No one is putting a gun to your head and forcing you to press play, nor is anyone forcing you to go into the comments. If you just ignore it, then it'll go away in one day when ""better"" content gets upvoted because that's how reddit works.   In my real person life job thing I work as an editor, and though I didn't start out doing AMVs, I have many friends who got their start doing them. They are a great tool to practice because the premade elements require no outside work to obtain. It's a good exercise to practice rhythm and pacing for a young editor. So it's very discouraging to have a love for something (like KH) and edit some LinkinBallZ together just to realize that it'll get removed the second you want to share it with your favorite subreddit. That would be like saying ""If your fanart is shitty then we'll remove it.""  So I guess to summarize, if I see an AMV I probably won't click on it, or maybe I will, I dunno what I'm in the mood for. Maybe I want some Linkin Park and Donald in my life (God help me). But that's for me to decide, and I don't think we should censor someone's attempt at original content with a medium they love.

KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,tACorruption,30,Sun Jul 12 02:35:43 2015 UTC,Sounds lame yo
KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,kisforkmo,25,Sun Jul 12 02:44:54 2015 UTC,It is the lamest.

KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,tACorruption,4,Sun Jul 12 04:57:38 2015 UTC,"Unless it's hilarious. For example, an AMV placing weird al's Horoscope over top of clips of Sunohara from Clannad."

KingdomHearts,3cyjf8,BobisOnlyBob,10,Sun Jul 12 11:40:33 2015 UTC,"Good AMVs exist but anything you see posted here is gonna be atrocious. Generally it's better to find a good artist like BakaOppai (another of his) or something based around a show you love - my personal favourite Bakemonogatari has Into the Labyrinth and Orion. And yeah, you could probably call either of those ""anime clips set to angsty music"" but fuck, it's good music and synced well and they're both thematically appropriate to the show.   Frankly, the channel TheBestAMVsOfAllTime lives up to its name and ensures you aren't wasting your time on LinkinBallZ crap. They even have dedicated genre playlists and sources. And I looked, but tellingly:  This channel has no content that matched ""kingdom hearts""."

KingdomHearts,3d2u1o,Coheedjr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:26:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the art aspect but I can shed some light on Zack Fair. Zack Fair is from final fantasy vii crisis core. Without getting spoilery he is an important character to Cloud from FF7. His role in kh is pretty limited he's just seen on Mt Olympus in BBS. In other words, if you're gonna move on to BBS you'll get to see him soon. To understand who Zack is I recommend looking to final fantasy wikia or just googling crisis core and getting a synopsis.   And yeah, a great thank you to all the artists out there!"
KingdomHearts,3d2u1o,Coheedjr,2,Mon Jul 13 02:12:28 2015 UTC,"Edit: correct, he was originally in FFVII but was only really mentioned as an inspiration and friend, in crisis core its all about Zack and how he really affected the story of FFVII in a really behind the scenes way. :) have fun at Olympus coliseum!

I'm going to ponder though why he was in KH series unless for some odd future plot or maybe just like an easter egg to those FF fans playing KH. FF is something I played when I was too little understand and never picked up again. KH has really been my only other connection to FF."
KingdomHearts,3d2u1o,leigonlord,0,Wed Jul 15 07:30:11 2015 UTC,It also seemed like they wanted to tie him in with KH-Cloud's storyline (which I still find a little weird) based on what happened in the credits of BBS so he could be more significant in future games :D
KingdomHearts,3d2u1o,leigonlord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:50:37 2015 UTC,After reading these it seems that maybe that's they were trying to do. Maybe just a little easter egg for FF fans in part. Or maybe that's why Mt. Olympus is involved with KHIII.
KingdomHearts,3d2u1o,leigonlord,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:34:44 2015 UTC,zacks unimportant. for now at least. hes probably mentioned because of final fantasy

KingdomHearts,3d0mri,JohnRosen,5,Sun Jul 12 15:22:37 2015 UTC,The way nostalgia overcomes sensibilities is kinda sad.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,Sloth_Senpai,2,Sun Jul 12 17:23:59 2015 UTC,"We play games to feel happy and have fun. Nostalgia is a sense of a time when we were much happier. In a way, a game that can invoke nostalgia can be better than another simply because it is enjoyed more."
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,Tquinn96,13,Sun Jul 12 18:03:07 2015 UTC,KH1.5 Final Mix is infinitely better than the original in terms of game play. It actually has reaction commands and overall just feels better than the original.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,Hashkushem,9,Sun Jul 12 16:07:35 2015 UTC,The camera is much better to boot too
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,fifbiff,3,Sun Jul 12 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"The ""reaction"" commands were there before.  They were just at the bottom of the command list.  Or do you mean that you like that they made it easier by hitting triangle instead of having to scroll to it?"
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,Tquinn96,3,Sun Jul 12 17:05:38 2015 UTC,The triangle reaction commands of course! If you wanted to use them otherwise you'd have to basically leave your command bar on the last command and hope it pops up.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,lyoncobalt,8,Mon Jul 13 02:39:46 2015 UTC,Screw such meaningless concepts as nostalgia. The Final Mixes are better in every way.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,NinetoFiveHero,3,Sun Jul 12 20:22:28 2015 UTC,Not every way since they took out the best grinding spot in KHII. Not that that's any reason to play the original over FM.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,TarotFox,2,Mon Jul 13 12:42:07 2015 UTC,"Not that there's really any reason to grind... It also added the Cave of Remembrance, with way higher level enemies for traditional grinding."
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,snazzysnorlax,2,Tue Jul 14 06:10:42 2015 UTC,"And in kingdom hearts 1, I remember using the right stick to scroll through commands to actually use magic that wasn't in the shortcut. They took this out of final mix which I found rather frustrating. At least in KH2 you could hold L2 (or maybe R2) to ""lock"" the camera and use the RS to navigate the command menu. This helped A TON since there were 2 menus at that point. I really wish they had implemented that into KH FM."
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,greg225,4,Tue Jul 14 14:54:05 2015 UTC,There's no way I could ever go back to vanilla KH1 after playing the PS3 version.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,theblackfool,2,Sun Jul 12 20:49:25 2015 UTC,Nope. Fuck using L2 and R2 to rotate the camera.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,greg225,4,Mon Jul 13 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's nothing compared to the unskippable cutscenes. After seeing the ""There's no way you're taking Kairi's heart"" cutscene 50 times all I wanted was the cold embrace of death."

KingdomHearts,3d0mri,TarotFox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:09:35 2015 UTC,The only one I really noticed or cared about too much was Trickmaster.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,theblackfool,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:11:22 2015 UTC,That one I definitely like the original color scheme more.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,kairisheartless,3,Tue Jul 14 09:21:00 2015 UTC,"I see how the nostalgia factor could make people love the originals, but I consider the remixes better versions of the originals. There's bonus gameplay content, better graphics, extra story content, and they've just got way more replay value. I don't really understand why you would want to play a game with blurry graphics, no bonus content, low difficulty compared to remixes, and controller cords that get in the way for myself and possibly others; I have to constantly lift my cables so people don't trip on it, and I have to stay close to the tv while not being able to comfortably play the game."
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,sonicspeed1500,2,Sun Jul 12 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"By far the Final Mixes. Who doesn't enjoy new cutscenes and story? Not to mention new bosses, 2FM adding a whole bunch of new and challenging ones. The only things I would say that aren't great about them is synthesis is made a little more tedious, but KH2 had Lucky rings and 2 extra Lucky Lucky's on crit, so it's not too bad. That, and that O and X are swapped, which can throw a lot of people off. But overall they are very worth. Now, as for the HD ports, casually they are fine, 1.5 being pretty much perfect. But 2.5 does have quite a bit of problems, like load times and some fights being completely broken. But is overall worth it for the fact it's in HD and available in America if you want to play it casually. In terms of speedrunning though, you're better off with 2FM on PS2."
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,theblackfool,2,Sun Jul 12 19:09:54 2015 UTC,Final Mixes are superior in every way IMO.
KingdomHearts,3d0mri,Zephyrus_808,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"The PS3 remixes (or 'ReMIX') all the way. I still got the same nostalgic from playing KH2 Final Mix as I did when I replayed it on PS2 a few months ago. It was arguably even more enjoyable since, you know, I had a better idea of what was happening on my screen. The only changes that have been made between 1.5/2.5 and the original PS2 versions are upgrades - visuals, bonus cutscenes, extra abilities, more fights. There's no reason not to pick the new over the old."

KingdomHearts,3d3286,SugoiL0vePunch,11,Mon Jul 13 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of conversation about the games here that I've seen - but remember, a trailer with not a lot of new plot information but a lot of new flashy imagery just came out. 2.5's new additions are a year old by now, and KHX hasn't had a plot update worth significant discussion in months. While there's always room for meta and discussion about older games, in a relative drought like this (everyone's waiting for D23 Japan) of course things will be quieter. There are always forums - I've spent time on KHInsider's in the past, though mostly during releases for updates or checking on KHX stuff - or, hell, I get better meta discussions on Tumblr than I do on here. (Unfortunately, actually finding anything on Tumblr is hellish.)  Anyway, here's some discussions from the last day about the games, so... maybe you're not looking hard enough?  Meta-stuff/plot:   How did Xemnas find Roxas? What's the significance of the recurring numbers 7 and 13? Questions about 3D Why didn't Sora and Riku run into Aqua?

I think one person posted one that they liked, and then people just started posting them left and right. It was scary! O.O If you notice though a lot of them get downvoted pretty quick.  I personally love the fan art posts though. I think most of them are NUTS!  There was a lot of talk about KH3 news for awhile. There were several posts a day of people finding little things from the E3 trailer, and people would speculate what it ment for the game. I'm sad those are gone. I really enjoyed those.  I'd say stick around til after the summer. The kids will go back to school and AMVs will stop. It's summer vacation.

KingdomHearts,3cy77g,MableDONKEY,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:42:53 2015 UTC,Well that ruined my mood. I somehow doubt you know that Iwata just died.
KingdomHearts,3cy77g,MableDONKEY,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:44:07 2015 UTC,Vat?
KingdomHearts,3cy77g,MableDONKEY,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:55:32 2015 UTC,President of Nintendo.
KingdomHearts,3cy77g,MableDONKEY,-1,Mon Jul 13 01:01:14 2015 UTC,"I knew that, but what does that have to do with anything?"
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,Uniphication,33,Sat Jul 11 03:45:37 2015 UTC,I wonder what this looks like to people who have no idea what KH is
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,Marowe,47,Sat Jul 11 06:40:06 2015 UTC,Mickey the back alley drug dealer.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,WilsonHanks,10,Sat Jul 11 10:25:59 2015 UTC,Kingpin Mickey
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,JEMerc,13,Sat Jul 11 18:10:20 2015 UTC,"I bought this last time I was in Disney World , the lady was like ""Wow I've never seen someone buy the ninja mickey"" ..close enough lol"
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,sprayedice,7,Sat Jul 11 18:31:56 2015 UTC,Probably Jedi Mickey.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,Sea-Salt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"For the amount I love KH, it just looks like a Mickey Mouse dildo pin."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,quizzicalquow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:36:34 2015 UTC,I found this with the Star Wars pins. So probably Darth Mickey or something.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,wonderbrian,10,Mon Jul 13 15:28:38 2015 UTC,Where did you find that? Which park were you at? I'm going in a few weeks and would love to get one of these!
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,Nick817,7,Sat Jul 11 04:06:29 2015 UTC,"The most convenient place I found them was the Epcot Pin Trading Station, in the middle hub between the fountain and Spaceship Earth. On the side facing the fountain there's a section with only Mickey pins, that's where I found mine."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,saldigenova,7,Sat Jul 11 12:54:07 2015 UTC,At almost any store with pins. When I went there I saw it at every Park at almost every store.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,Hope_Burns_Bright,4,Sat Jul 11 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"Obviously not OP, but I snagged mine at Disney Hollywood Studios. For exactitude, it was at a small pin kiosk on the left side of the street that heads toward the Tower of Terror. It's next to some sort of burger joint.  Edit: I got back from this vacation two weeks ago, so this should be up-to-date info"
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,mathmistress,3,Sat Jul 11 05:36:17 2015 UTC,They sell them at Disneyland in California too! I found one outside the its a small world ride exit and also in downtown Disney (outside the park)
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,jrcwyss,2,Sat Jul 11 15:23:49 2015 UTC,I got one last month when I was there. Make sure to look in the Star Wars pins. I was able to find a few of them and they were always mixed in there in the back.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,mightymoltres,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:37:56 2015 UTC,I gotta vouch for looking with the Star Wars pins.  I found it in almost every pin kiosk right next to Luke Mickey.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,wonderbrian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:36:07 2015 UTC,I found plenty of these at Disney Land.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,banana_slap,12,Mon Jul 13 15:29:03 2015 UTC,Reminds me of this considering where it was found.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,vivvav,8,Sat Jul 11 07:45:00 2015 UTC,"That's not... Wow, ok.    I mean, it's just like... Good for you, I guess? He's a major pop culture icon that's bigger than any single one of his incarnations, but the ""sailor"" is much more in line with 99% of his appearances."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,noice5,3,Sat Jul 11 20:11:49 2015 UTC,Know if this pin can be found in Disneyland?
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,emulth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:27:33 2015 UTC,"I got one there a couple of years ago. It was, and probably still is, pretty common."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,wonderbrian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"I got this at a stand outside of the park a month or two ago. It was near the LEGO store, I believe."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,ChrisIsGettingFit,5,Mon Jul 13 15:30:02 2015 UTC,is this rare?
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,themanofawesomeness,9,Sat Jul 11 08:50:20 2015 UTC,"It's not rare within the park, but it's the novelty that it's literally the only piece of Kingdom Hearts merchandise sold within the Disney Parks"
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,mightymoltres,2,Sat Jul 11 19:08:24 2015 UTC,The Japanese section of Epcot has Kingdom Hearts stuff... though that has nothing to do with Disney selling KH stuff.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,themanofawesomeness,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:33:29 2015 UTC,I've been there before and I think there's some shirts right? I know they don't sell any figures or accessories.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,mightymoltres,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:50:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think there was anything except for shirts. Maybe a beach towel, but I might be confusing that with the one my buddy has."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,rasta_pasta_man,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I also bought a KH shirt the same visit I got this pin. It's the only other KH merch I've seen at Disney, I didn't see anything else. It was only one style of shirt."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,ChrisIsGettingFit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"I was there 2 months ago and they had a Roxas and Sora figure on sale, but I wasn't spending $100 dollars on that."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,j4ckalop3,0,Mon Jul 13 08:23:58 2015 UTC,awesome. how much does it cost?
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,kairisheartless,4,Sat Jul 11 20:17:52 2015 UTC,no
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,rasta_pasta_man,2,Sat Jul 11 11:36:02 2015 UTC,"I've seen tons of those at both disney US locations; now if anyone could find that limited edition disney world pin with the DTD, I could die happy."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,Curtains64,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:23:29 2015 UTC,Which one?My girlfriend works at Pin Traders at Downtown Disney.

KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,TheSilverwolfKnight,0,Sat Jul 11 04:14:23 2015 UTC,My mom hooked me up with one of these a few months ago.
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,emulth,0,Sat Jul 11 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, the thumbnail made me think it was a penis"
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,christinasays,2,Sat Jul 11 10:09:33 2015 UTC,"Looking at the tiny thumbnail on mobile, I just can't figure out how you're seeing that. I guess the mind sees what it wants to see."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,acyort,0,Sat Jul 11 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"I have one of these! I picked it up about two months ago at Hollywood Studios and was so excited when. I saw ""kingdom hearts"" on the receipt haha."
KingdomHearts,3cvmjl,mattd121794,-4,Sat Jul 11 17:22:01 2015 UTC,I used to work at Disney World and would see this all the time but I always thought it was a Star Wars themed pin? I love KH but it never crossed my mind
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,SighAgain,19,Sat Jul 11 19:30:34 2015 UTC,Gilgamesh wielding fake Keyblades would be awesome.
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,DevonianDino,6,Sat Jul 11 20:25:45 2015 UTC,I really don't know how he has not made it in a game yet. It would be such a Gilgamesh thing to do.
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,res12,2,Sat Jul 11 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"There was a similar thread some time ago and there was a consensus that Gilgamesh is a definite must for the KH universe,especially because he's such a humorous character."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Freyzi,10,Sun Jul 12 06:22:35 2015 UTC,If there is one thing from Star Wars that I wouldn't mind making an appearance it would be a Darth Vader hidden superboss.
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,merqury26,6,Sat Jul 11 19:54:26 2015 UTC,I need a cutscene with Darth Vader vs. Sephiroth fight.
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Irignation,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:56:21 2015 UTC,How about Darth Vader vs Xemnas?  Both use red dual-wielded lightsabers. The epic fight of the red lightsabers.
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,ChromeBadger,3,Sun Jul 12 21:19:04 2015 UTC,"If they could swing it, a Starkiller boss would be epic as hell too."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,greg225,2,Sun Jul 12 15:20:38 2015 UTC,I feel like he could be a top contender for hardest boss in the series if done right.
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,omimon,8,Sat Jul 11 20:00:09 2015 UTC,"Jecht from FFX as a boss in the story, or at least one of the Coliseum cups, and his Final Aeon form as a secret Sephiroth/Ice Titan-esque boss. And yes, with the music."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Yosheth,3,Sat Jul 11 19:57:53 2015 UTC,"That's what made the Sephiroth battle for me, the music. Jecht would be great a Coliseum boss alongside Auron."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Angelus_of_Fire,4,Sat Jul 11 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"Walt Disney, the first Keyblade master and original blacksmith of the weapon."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,axelofthekey,2,Sun Jul 12 10:34:26 2015 UTC,"This seems so obvious if you think about it. Maybe you could find him on the Frozen world, that will probably be thrown in, in a block of ice."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,TGGOrb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"No,  he'd obviously have a rapier."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,MableDONKEY,6,Mon Jul 13 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"i'd like for an omega weapon type of secret boss. Might be to ""final fantasy"" for the game idk."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Caliburn0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of a ""weapon"" to appear. Ultima Weapon would be an awesome nod to Final Fantasy fans."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Enanoide,5,Sat Jul 11 19:56:44 2015 UTC,"The dork in me wants a custscene that makes it look like you're about to fight Sephiroth again, but he gets interrupted by Kefka who proceeds to wreck your face."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Caliburn0,3,Sun Jul 12 01:52:35 2015 UTC,OMG! I love it!

KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Caliburn0,3,Sun Jul 12 03:58:39 2015 UTC,"Really, I wanna finally fight Winnie the Pooh. The battle has been hyped up for so long. I mean, first we chase him up a tree, then we try killing him by throwing him off a hill (sadly only the jar comes off). Just imagine how fucking epic that would be!"
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,merqury26,13,Sun Jul 12 17:13:22 2015 UTC,"Everything and everyone. I want to fight everyone from marvel, star wars, final fantasy, and disney in general. I want to fight the entirety of organization XIII, Sephiroth, Golbez, Ultimecia (or however you write it.) And every villain, hero and slightly important character from every world disney and Square has the licence to. In essence, the more the better. Do I want to fight Galactus from Marvel? Damn right I do. Do I want to fight Darth Vader? Hell to the f**in yes. Why would I want to limit myself? This is a match with near infinite possibilities, and I want to see as much as possible fulfilled."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Zeebor,2,Sat Jul 11 20:45:36 2015 UTC,Why are you being downvoted?  I honestly cant understand reddit
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,ST6661,2,Sun Jul 12 02:31:58 2015 UTC,I started with +2 points and is now at -2. I have no idea why either. Apparently people doesn't like my idea... :p
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,AgitoPlusNine,2,Sun Jul 12 04:03:30 2015 UTC,I like it :D
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Yosheth,3,Sun Jul 12 04:17:24 2015 UTC,Would you look at that. When you point out downvotes it seems that reddit becomes self-aware. I'm hoping it doesn't happen again.

KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Sea-Salt,3,Sun Jul 12 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"More FF bosses, Kefka is one I specifically want.  I think legacy bosses (kind of like the Organization fights in KH2FM) for some past bosses whether super or not would be a nice throwback.  And if anything from Star Wars or Marvel gets in, I'd want a superboss fight against Darth Vader/The Emperor and either Thor and/or Loki.  Those characters would fit the best for a quick encounter with pre/post battle scenes."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Sea-Salt,3,Sun Jul 12 02:49:39 2015 UTC,"I want a boss fight with Chrono, from Chrono Trigger. It would be a great one on one sword fight through time."

KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,res12,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:09:47 2015 UTC,I'm loving the love for Gilgamesh here. I hope this gets noticed by the devs.
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,theblackfool,2,Sat Jul 11 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"I think a King Mickey secret boss would function similarily to Spekkio from Chrono Trigger. As in, he's a completely different boss depending on how strong Sora is."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,Stronkadonk,2,Sun Jul 12 02:42:17 2015 UTC,"The Headless Horseman. It could even be some sort of chase-style battle to make it more intense, with lots of moments where you have to dodge the flaming pumpkins he flings at you, or just getting outright trampled.  The alien creature from the old ""ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter"" attraction at Disney World (the one that made everyone go ""Holy shit, why did I come to this, Jesus H. Christ, save me, why would you do this, Disney?!!""). I imagine it'd be a somewhat cramped area for the battle, with lots of gaps for the creature to run into and out of, as well as the lights going out constantly, only to come back up for the monster to be right in front of you. The horror angle could be amped up as Donald and Goofy get dragged off at random points, being taken out of the fight completely until you finish it."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,-nox-,2,Sun Jul 12 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"I never knew I wanted the alien beast till now.  Sidenote, that experience was truly terrifying and not what I was expecting."
KingdomHearts,3cxvf3,BigBossREX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"I never had a chance to see it myself outside of videos, just its Stitch-based replacement (which itself is getting replaced now), as well as buying a pin of it back when I worked there.  Plus, hell, why limit the references to Disney rides to special attacks? Granted, I can't think of any others that would fit boss battles, unless one wanted to beat the crap out of the Country Bear Jamboree."
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,limitbreaker77,5,Sun Jul 12 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure where the seven comes from, but 13 has been a reoccurring trend since the original: ""Kingdom Hearts"" has 13 letters, there are 13 worlds in the game, and while lot of other things but it's sorta just like the trope of he game. Things come in thirteens. There were seven princesses of heart but really not much else besides the guardians of light.   I wouldn't look to far into he symbolism of the numbers other than the fact that they reoccur. I don't think it's like the Bible where all the numbers have to mean something."
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,not_your_face,5,Sun Jul 12 04:51:18 2015 UTC,7 is a lucky number. Said to make magic stronger.
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Enanoide,3,Sun Jul 12 05:09:35 2015 UTC,"13 is also an unlucky number, which is why 13 is the dark component."
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Rodents210,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:18:02 2015 UTC,"In western culture. But in Japanese culture 9 is the unlucky number. I'm not saying your necessarily wrong, I'm just saying it could be more arbitrary than we'd assume. Who knows."
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Cobradactyl,2,Sun Jul 12 08:49:46 2015 UTC,Isn't 4 the unlucky number? Or is that Chinese?
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Caliburn0,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:35:30 2015 UTC,Both. They have pronunciations that are the same as sickness and death respectively.
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:46:49 2015 UTC,And wearing shirts with english on them is hip and cool. He could easily pick 13 because it's an unlucky number for foreigners.
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:46:07 2015 UTC,I turned 13 on friday the 13th (back in 2006). Does that counter the back luck?
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Syncroshade,2,Mon Jul 13 12:44:36 2015 UTC,"The 7 comes from the 7 princesses of light. 7 princesses, 7 guardians."

KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Ianjh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:11:11 2015 UTC,Well wasn't the whole point of there being 7 guardians of light to protect the 7 princesses of heart?  1 for each princess?
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Caliburn0,2,Mon Jul 13 23:29:33 2015 UTC,"3, 7, 12, 13 - All of those are special numbers often used in fairy tales and stories. In greek mythology there are 'the big three'. Zeus, Poseidon and Hades. There are 12 olympian gods, and 1 outcast, making it 13. 7 is considered a lucky, or a 'good' number, while 13 is considered unlucky or 'bad'. This is used all over in mythology, fairytales and religions."
KingdomHearts,3czgz6,Caliburn0,2,Sun Jul 12 10:34:26 2015 UTC,"I forgot 13 was generally unlucky, but didn't realize 7 was also lucky :P  Heh, guess I was just really hoping for some deep allusion. Would've been cool, but oh well."

KingdomHearts,3d1fud,MableDONKEY,6,Sun Jul 12 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"I have a better question. Why would you think this is a good idea?   PSP, and for all intents and purposes the PS Vita are dead systems. There is absolutely no demand for a game on either system. If we already have 1.5 on the PS3 then there is zero sense in porting a game to a lesser system. I don't get why you chose the psp instead of the vita in the first place. That's like taking a GameCube game and porting it to the DS instead of the 3DS."
KingdomHearts,3d1fud,ShinyGoombah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:15:44 2015 UTC,"True there's no demand for it, I just thought it would be easier to get it done that way if it should ever happen. I think that because BBS is on the psp, it'll be easier to port the engine over.  I want to see it with the BBS engine. And actually bring the game on a portable system.  I think mods are easier on the psp over the vita. People are way more familiar with the psp. Also, the 3ds can't even get a stable emulation yet. So I ruled that out. And, if I remember right, the 3ds is actually weaker than the psp."
KingdomHearts,3d1fud,ShinyGoombah,3,Sun Jul 12 23:12:31 2015 UTC,"So, I'm really trying to understand this.  You would want a KH1 port to the psp so people can make mods for it?  What about the BBS engine do you prefer to want this?"
KingdomHearts,3d1fud,VonFrank,2,Mon Jul 13 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"Not for people to make mods for it. I just think the psp is easier to mod so it's easier to get things done on there.  Maybe have Riku as a playable character in the story, and anytime you're supposed to see him,you'll see Sora instead. I want the command deck to be in the KH1. Like, instead of the regular command list, it's the command deck. Also, the controls are very similar to how the first game worked, with minor tweaks to make up for what it's lacking in."
KingdomHearts,3d1fud,VonFrank,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say this, but the way you describe your idea, you clearly have no understanding of how programming actually works. It would literally be easier to mod the existing PS2 or PS3 versions of KH1 in the way you want than it would be to port it to PSP and then do it there. Its far FAR mroe complex than you're making it out to be.  And also... why would you want KH1 to have the Command Deck system? The Command Menu system is far superior, hence why KH2 used it and why KH3 will be using it."
KingdomHearts,3d1fud,VonFrank,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:24:56 2015 UTC,I don't have an idea on programming. It was just a thought.  I personally like the command deck. Just personal preference.
KingdomHearts,3d1fud,ShinyGoombah,2,Mon Jul 13 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I don't understand the logic behind this. KH1 is now on the PS3, so why would there ever be a demand for it ported to an older, dead, handheld system?"
KingdomHearts,3d1fud,dustymons,2,Sun Jul 12 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"To have the access of playing the game on a handheld. Just because it's dead doesn't mean it's gone for good. Lots of people have one. I'd settle for the vita if the mods for it did good. Also, it's not something I expect Square Enix to do. I was thinking, maybe a fan could do it."

If you're down for YA, the Young Wizards series has some thematic similarity to KH, maybe.  There actually is a novel series for KH, though! The first one came out this spring (in English, at least); it's a pretty straight retelling of the first game, but it feels well-translated and adds some really nice details. (Also, the later ones get into stuff not shown in the games, and I really desperately want them to get translated.)"

KingdomHearts,3cw3pf,carnagelol,2,Sun Jul 12 02:11:18 2015 UTC,"the events where Aqua meets Ansem in the dark margin most likely takes place AFTER the ending of KH2. my reasoning is that Ansem most likely didn't appear on the dark margin but most have made his way there. the realm of Darkness is probably as big as the realm of light , so it must take a while to get from one place to another. furthermore Ansem seems like he has been there for a bit when Aqua arrives, so I doubt that an Encounter with aqua was possible."

KingdomHearts,3cv5fw,medven,7,Sat Jul 11 01:05:05 2015 UTC,I imagine that it was the shadow of Ansem SOD causing him pain in his heart. Mickey said something to that extent when he was talking to Ansem the Wise in The World That Never Was in KH2.
KingdomHearts,3cv5fw,Unforgettawha,3,Sat Jul 11 02:07:38 2015 UTC,"IIRC, That was Riku trying to control the darkness after Castle Oblivion, when 358/2 Days starts he's having trouble to containt it. Hence the scene where he covers his eyes with the blindfold."
KingdomHearts,3cv5fw,Marcos1598,4,Sat Jul 11 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"This, basically. Riku subdued Ansem, but he was still there...he wasn't locked away. So, while he wasn't strong enough to maintain a physical presence outside of Riku's body or to really fight back at all yet, his darkness was still overwhelmingly large and hard to keep from swallowing Riku up entirely. This manifests as pain, I'm assuming, because he's filled to the brim and doesn't know how to fix himself, so he just kind of grins and bears the pain.  By 358, he 'gives in' to the darkness and this manifests with him taking on the form of Ansem, which allows him greater control of the darkness but obviously he looks completely different. It isn't until DDD when Riku is finally able to lock Ansem away forever inside of his heart and control the darkness on his own terms."
KingdomHearts,3cv5fw,Kaweebo,4,Sat Jul 11 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's foreshadowing for 2, but more importantly, one of the quality control guys was apparently named ""Bart Cool."" Now that is a seal of approval I want."

KingdomHearts,3cw72t,TheyCallMeMaster,2,Sat Jul 11 07:54:10 2015 UTC,"Couple possibilities jump out:   Sora: Don't say that. Memories---even important ones---don't come back to us whenever we want them to. But that doesn't mean the memories are gone. It's more like...like they're sleeping. So when the right thing comes along and wakes the memory up, we can remember it. The memories engraved in our hearts never go away. I'm sure of it.        Sora: If the chain of memories comes apart, the links will still be there, right? So the memory of our promise will always be inside me somewhere. I'm sure of it.   Re: Chain of Memories is the only time I can remember anything similar sounding - if neither of those are it, you could skim the game script and see if anything jumps out as being what you're after?  The original CoM has a few lines like that, too -    Aerith: We don't know you, Sora, but your heart is full of memories of us together. Those memories must resonate in our hearts, too. Maybe they tell us things we couldn't otherwise know.        Leon: You'll be okay, Sora. No matter what shape reality takes, you can handle it. I may not remember you, but I know you in my heart."

The whole quote is   Sora: You're a good friend, Jiminy. Don't worry. You won't get rid of  us that easily. We might lose some memories, but we've still got you  guys. And whatever part of us doesn't stay in the journal will always  stay inside you, right? The words may be gone, but never the memories. You can hang on to them for us. Just keep us in your hearts, and we'll be there when you need us most."

KingdomHearts,3cxcz7,PieofUgin,5,Sat Jul 11 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine full worlds being DLC. Maybe an outfit or a weapon but I don't see any reason why they would make worlds DLC. There's too much work that goes into it for something that they might not even sell. A weapon though? Much easier. Much less time. Much more likely to return profits.   I don't understand the premise of this post. It assume DLC which we don't even know if it will occur. And Nomura specifically had said that the majority of the worlds are new. I'm betting the returning worlds are mostly the KH original worlds and maybe a few others (We already know of Olympus)   Also side note: not very many people still care about Pirates of the Caribbean. It's a niche, don't get me wrong, but the later movies haven't been well liked nor all that successful by comparison. I don't see it happening."
KingdomHearts,3cxcz7,not_your_face,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"Costumes and keyblades are definitely going to happen, but look at Mario Kart 8. The DLC content is equal to almost half of the main game. I suspect a lot of it was derived from concepts that were taken out of the main game somewhere in development; in other words, they could easily have been abandoned, half-developed waste that was then recycled and completed to turn an extra profit. We know for a fact that Jungle Book was half-developed and scrapped in BBS; if SE had been more DLC conscious at the time, it might have been completed and sold to us in a pack. Who knows, really, but what we do know is that developers, and especially SE, are including more and more DLC content.  The majority of the worlds in the game. That has nothing to do with DLC, and might be deliberately misleading to draw attention away from the fact that DLC might be in the works.  Disney doesn't care about popularity; it cares about sales. Pirates has the highest average gross per movie of literally any film franchise, not to mention has Disney's single best movie sales outside of Frozen and the Marvel universe. As long as Disney continues making Pirates movies, it's a safe bet that they will want exposure wherever they can get it. Milk that cow dry."
KingdomHearts,3cxcz7,LegoStevenMC,3,Mon Jul 13 07:51:39 2015 UTC,Hawaii   Why is that not very likely :( I think it's extremely likely considering  A: They planned that world for another Kingdom Hearts game  B: Stitch is very popular in Japan  Also: It'd be awesome!! :D
KingdomHearts,3cxcz7,Sea-Salt,0,Sat Jul 11 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"So far, the closest any world has come to ""real-world earth"" is Land of Dragons, or maybe Pride Lands. In both cases, the worlds worked as fantasy realms thanks to the distance granted by dragons/ancestors and anthropomorphism, respectively. While Nomura could choose mundane, real-world, nonmagical, human-inhabited settings for world choices, that certainly doesn't make for interesting gameplay. They might do Deep Space again because the aliens provide a sufficient sense of ""otherness"" to make the world work, but realistically Hawaii is not going to happen."
KingdomHearts,3cxcz7,OdysseyMan,2,Mon Jul 13 07:29:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be pissed if they hold back worlds for the sake of DLC.

KingdomHearts,3cxcz7,Jack_Ryker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"Final Mixes suggest that KH games are never ""fully complete,"" nor is SE opposed to making you pay out the nose for extra content."

KingdomHearts,3cxcz7,ElectricLuxray,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:06:29 2015 UTC,"Cavern of remembrance is pretty close to the size of a small new world. The data boss battles are pretty much the equivalent of adding a DLC boss rush (which I also think is very likely and a great way to include staples like Ursula, Jafar, and Oogie).  But more to the point, if indeed we argue that Agrabah or Halloweentown are not necessary to KHIII's completion from a development standpoint, there is still the marketing issue of drawing in all the old fans who have been waiting a decade for this game. This could be as simple as a ""nightmare"" costume for Sora and a genie summon, but it really depends on how much the developers have created and not used, and how much more they want to develop specifically for DLC.  I personally could see us getting a single-world ""expansion-pack"" mission or two. It would be very easy to add to the world map, and KH has the Disney worlds have been increasingly less relevant to the overarching plot so it wouldn't detract from the main game at all."

KingdomHearts,3cugmn,fabiotheiguana,2,Sat Jul 11 18:09:23 2015 UTC,IGN has been known for making really half-assed content/reviews of kingdom hearts. Their analysis trailer for the new KH 3 trailer was done by someone who has never even played kingdom hearts before.
KingdomHearts,3cugmn,Reddit_overload1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:18:32 2015 UTC,Wow using Roxas in bbs must be a really good hack... sry but couldn't resist... :)
KingdomHearts,3cugmn,Rarzhn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:51:39 2015 UTC,Yep beat him on my first try with Aqua too.Had no idea what to expect either.Using Terra wasn't to much of a problem either.
KingdomHearts,3cugmn,DrChinBlaster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:53:06 2015 UTC,"I was the opposite; I beat Eraqus Armour in one try but it took me like ten tries for No Heart (both playing as Terra, haven't tried with the others yet)."
KingdomHearts,3cugmn,IchigoKurosaki15,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:37:36 2015 UTC,Where do you fight these bosses?  What do you have to do?  And what's the best level to fight them at?
KingdomHearts,3cugmn,Your_Window_Peeper,2,Sat Jul 11 04:13:14 2015 UTC,"BBS, Mirage arena. You have to have a high enough arena level, 25 for Eraqus and 28 for No Heart. I was 99, which made it easier, (I was on critical though, so it evens out.). Idk what level you need to be, but if you can beat the other arena challengers you're probably fine. Just have a strong Leveled Whitlock like lighting rush. That's the one I used for No Heart to obliterate him.  The 'Rush' type shot locks are better because it's harder for the bosses to dodge them. Just learn their attacks, cartwheel/dodge roll constantly and you'll be invincible. Might take you a couple of tries."

KingdomHearts,3csi05,leigonlord,3,Fri Jul 10 12:54:50 2015 UTC,Well if you've never played the final mix version then you could look out for the new Unversed colors. That's probably the most frequent different thing besides the updated textures.
KingdomHearts,3csi05,Dyspnia,2,Fri Jul 10 14:03:14 2015 UTC,"Changes from NA BBS to Final Mix:   No Heart, Eraqus Armor, Monstro Mirage Arena bosses Mirage Arena levels reworked - you don't need to clear every racing level to reach level 30 anymore. (Just a certain number of wins.) Secret Episode added - beat Final Episode on Critical/Proud with all stickers/Standard with journal completion to unlock, just like Blank Points. It's a playable secret ending! I love it. A couple new commands - Illusion commands (you turn into an Unversed), Aerial Recovery (honestly I don't know why this was added, it replaces the payback commands), probably something else Unversed challenges throughout the worlds Rhythm Mixer command style, Royal Radiance Keyblade Unversed are all recolored   Changes from Final Mix to 2.5:   Mirage Arena rebalanced for single player, challenges added (stuff like ""don't use recovery commands"" or time limits) Not sure if it was here or in FM, but one of Aqua's stickers has been moved at some point?"
KingdomHearts,3csi05,beribboned,2,Fri Jul 10 18:25:21 2015 UTC,The sticker is one in Disney Town in the area by the race track.  It's now right above the race track entrance.

KingdomHearts,3csi05,beribboned,2,Fri Jul 10 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"Hm, in Birth by Sleep I died a lot because of Payback, especially with Terra. There were a lot of times when one of those armored large Unversed would hit me, I'd Payback, and they'd hit me again before I could get out of it, resulting in me dying. Same thing happened a lot with Vanitas Lingering Spirit with Terra. I ended up completely disabling it for that fight."

DLC is stupid, It exists because money, or something that has been added way after the game releases.  As for the extra features, final mix. DLC shouldn't exist, flat out.  If they want to make it so you can wear different outfits, go ahead, that's awesome, but to make us pay for it after the game is beyond bull.  The only thing that should ever be payed for relating to content to the game, is the game itself, or a game with the features they couldn't put in the game originally for misc reasons."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,MeInDevelopment,9,Fri Jul 10 18:20:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly do not understand all this desire for DLC.... Essentially, what you're saying is: ""I want to have to pay extra money for game elements that should be part of the shipped product."" Now tell me, how stupid does that sound to you?  SE should release a full and complete product in which nothing is intentionally left out, as opposed to pumping out little DLC bits in order to soak up extra cash from the blind masses that will throw money at anything simply because they can.  Seriously people. In almost all cases, DLC (except when its free) is a BAD thing for games. Its not something anyone should want for KH3."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,VonFrank,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"I dunno, some games handle DLC quite well. The first game that comes to mind is Skyrim, as its Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCS added hours of content and new playstyles for a really good price. They enhanced the game, and it didn't feel like a cop-out. While KH may not be the best game for DLC, we shouldn't hate the idea because some companies practically scam the consumers out of content."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,Redingard,-1,Sat Jul 11 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"As a reply to all the comments, I never said I WANTED DLC. I just said it was a thought in my head. I personally wouldn't mind it. I wouldn't buy it unless it was nessasary to the game. So if it came across that I was gonna pay ridiculous amounts of money then I apologise. And in relation to people saying they wouldn't buy the game if they had DLC I think that's a little silly. The game will still be INSANELY amazing regardless of whether there is DLC or not.

He's supposed to get a specific one at the beginning of KH3 because that's how SE does it, and then maybe if the Forms come back and worlds similar to but not including Halloween Town emerge, he'll have various outfits included in the game related to those worlds. Selling DLC would be pointless and would make the game less enjoyable for most consumers because I'm sure many of us feel like costume changes related to worlds and receiving new chains to change the look and upgrade the Key are all key (no pun intended) factors in game progression. Selling different DLC with different keys would make KH3 pay-to-win, for the most part, because changing your Key to something specific grants boosts in certain areas, and that would make the game unfair. Not everyone can buy DLC as it is.  You have a clever idea on your hands, but I don't think it would fit with something like Kingdom Hearts."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,AwkBoss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:19:50 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to unlock Keyblades that you would receive through worlds to be DLC. But I'm not opposed to certain special Keyblades being DLC.
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,AwkBoss,-5,Fri Jul 10 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling deep down that things like the Frozen Keyblade will be DLC. Just a thought also, magic moves? I have a feeling they will be DLC."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,ST6661,3,Fri Jul 10 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"I just wouldn't see why they would hold out story Keyblades and change a system that's been in the game for forever.   Special character keys like Way to the Dawn or Kingdom Key D being DLC make a bit more sense. I wouldn't pay any more than like $5 for the both, and it better include a few extras beside that.   As for spells, maybe the ""-za"" level of spells like Stopza or Firaza, which would be stronger than the -ga level spells."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,ShinyGoombah,-4,Fri Jul 10 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"Good point. I'd probably take a guess that they will do DLC of some sort whether that be Worlds, Clothes, Blades etc. If it's like an exclusive item that's never been in the game before I'd pay for it without a doubt. But I agree with you that it would be silly to change that mechanic of that game after it being in all the others."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,JC915,-3,Fri Jul 10 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"If anything should be DLC it should be throwback costumes/keyblades, if those aren't available in game already."
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,MeInDevelopment,-2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:55 2015 UTC,I agree! I am very interested in what's gonna end up happening.  I love this game. I just hope they won't ruin it with unnessasary content.
KingdomHearts,3ctdu5,iwillyel,-2,Fri Jul 10 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"I do want outfit DLC and keyblad DLC. I would also really enjoy world DLC. We know almost all the worlds in KH3 are going to be new to the series, but wouldn't it be awesome to go back to worlds in the previous games?"

That said, I see more art on Tumblr these days, but sorting through tags is kind of horrific (I can guarantee the ""kingdom hearts"" tag right now is probably still a good 50% ""gifs of the KH3 trailer"")."

To go to the bells! To visit the gargoyles and ring the bell! Wheee!  It would be cool if they did something with the Aristocats, too, I suppose.

KingdomHearts,3cmnjz,bi-cycle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:39:32 2015 UTC,"Well, Pocahontas has much more moral to its story than the Incredibles. I know you're thinking it's cool to have superheroes, as do I and anyone; however, when it comes down to it, The Incredibles is a great action, family, and comedy movie, as opposed to Pocahontas, that's got family, drama, history, adventure, and romance! Pocahontas is anything but down to earth; it's one of Disney's best. I like the Incredibles more than Pocahontas, but I'm just saying if I were to choose one of those two to be in the next game, Pocahontas would be the easiest choice hands down. It's about the evil of the greedy white man that wants gold and power, but then teaches that the answer is not to fight with war, but to fight with love, as opposed to the Incredibles, that's a personal vendetta of a childish villain gone too far. It's just then about the kids wanting to use their powers and having fun with it, and the parents missing being superheroes. With Pocahontas it's much more serious than that."

Which one of these do you think people would want to see in a video game? Plus it helps that Incredibles already has a set of villainous entities to smack around; Pocahontas gives us Ratcliffe."
KingdomHearts,3cmnjz,captaintaco2345,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"The movies that were included were the least suited to be in a video game, such as the princesses of heart and Winnie the Pooh. If you want to think of another video game, we can talk about Cars or Planes. Those would be interesting and fun to include, because you'll be a car or a plane; however, the stories don't have that much of great morals to them. The Incredibles and Cars are more related to the development of the characters throughout the story as opposed to having a good story to it. Mulan saves China and Pocahontas saves her people. The Incredibles just try to save themselves in turn saving superheroes and the world, and Cars just has Lightning learn not to be too cocky. I'm with you in terms of that The Incredibles is a fantastic movie and would make for one hell of a game, but I just don't see it fit into the story, or be included.

KingdomHearts,3cmy2t,Shispanic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"Biggest flaw is that Riku can no longer use corridors of darkness, which is basically one of the fundamentals of this theory."
KingdomHearts,3cmy2t,legendofzelderp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts, for the most part. Well, the things I see as flaws. No offense to this amazing imagination/theory. Well done! Also, may be tl;dr and could have some spoilers, so read at your own expense, pls.   Although it may happen, I don't see Kairi and Lea doing the tutorial. It's not a bad idea, but normally the tutorial is done by the protagonist you play as. But, still, possible. It was shown in the secret ending to 3D that Aqua was in the Realm of Darkness with an OXIII member, namely Ansem, yet she did not say she knew dead-up where Ventus was. It had shown us, the players, where he was, but how could Aqua know? Unless I missed something somewhere where she previously mentioned that, I don't think she'd even know about Castle Oblivion. Plus, wasn't Ven in the Land of Departure with Terra in that ending? And wasn't Roxas in Castle Oblivion? I'm gonna have to go to YouTube at some point and look that up. Going back to Aqua and Ansem in the ROD, Ansem never said anything to Aqua about knowing how to leave. Even if he knew how to leave, it's kind of implied that he doesn't even know who he is or why he's in the ROD in the secret ending to 3D. So how could they leave? They would have to use Lea, and even that's a stretch, to open up a gateway of darkness to even think about going into the ROD on a hunch that someone important's in there. Why would Lea even use his Chakrams? Sure he'd have trouble materializing his Key, but he can still do it. Maybe after some practice, he'll be able to keep it for good. But still, Lea wants to become a Keyblade Master, so his Chakrams should have no use to him in KH3. /IF/ Kairi even finds Aqua somehow and brings her back, she would more likely tell the group at the Mysterious Tower that Sora has Ansem's reports locked in his heart. Unlocking his heart on a whim to get the reports out, it might be possible thaf Roxas and Naminé pop out, but not Xion. Xion is just a failed attempt at recreating Sora. Isn't Xion dead anyway? Moving on, if Roxas and Naminé pop out, Sora would have to be unconscious while they're outside of his heart because Sora was asleep the entire time you were able to play as Roxas with Naminé's support. Sora would then have to go through another COM thing once more while they're released. (Please, no more COM stuff, it was bad enough, imo.) KH3 is the end of the Dark Seeker Saga, not the end of Sora. It's been said for weeks, /maybe/ months that Sora would still be protagonist for a while after the Dark Seeker Saga ends. If they choose to change the protagonist without any heads up, that could mean a huge profit drop in the following saga, and that would be no bueno."
KingdomHearts,3cmy2t,legendofzelderp,2,Fri Jul 10 10:29:06 2015 UTC,"Dude, thanks for the detailed response, I really appreciate it. It's nice to actually get some well thought out, constructive criticism (on the internet no less). Honestly, I can answer all your points by saying that when I wrote the theory I kind of just forgot some stuff because the plot is already so complicated and I probably should've done a bit more research before getting this published. Also, I actually kind of implemented plot holes deliberately in the theory because I know that there's going to be some in KH3, there's been plot holes in every game so far XD"

KingdomHearts,3clj3k,MarlboroMundo,6,Thu Jul 9 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"Your argument seems to be that Sora has darkness present in his heart, and therefore cannot be a guardian of light. However, keep in mind that only 7 people (well, kind of 8, I guess) have hearts void of all darkness. And only one of those wields a keyblade. He is protecting the light, he isn't necessarily made of it. Yes, he will probably be battling his darkness along the way, but his resolve will pull him through as a guardian. Also, I do not think that Terra will be operational for such a large battle in KH3, even assuming he does break from Xehanort. Keep in mind that when Ven's heart was broken in two, he was pretty much out of commission for a year or two. And yes, I realize that Terra and Xehanort are two separate hearts, but they are undeniably intertwined, and it will take the power of a keyblade master to undo that. The power of, for example, Riku. And even then, the heart is very delicate. So such a change will render him more useless than when they merged. And keep in mind that Xehanort will not let go that easily. They will have to subdue Terra in order to rescue him."
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,Phoxxent,2,Wed Jul 8 22:20:05 2015 UTC,You actually inadvertently brought up an interesting point. Perhaps we'll see a return of the Keyblade of People's Hearts.
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,chrispwnu12,2,Wed Jul 8 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"Well, the current plot outline available to the general public (through various interviews) includes a search for something called ""the key to return hearts"", or something like that. So, if a keyblade, it would be the opposite of the keyblade of people's hearts, and would be vital to restoring Terra, and likely Roxas, while Ven should be restorable simply with the power granted by Yen Sid's Mark of Mastery Exam, assuming the former two are not.  EDIT: Proper nouns, man."

KingdomHearts,3clj3k,legendofzelderp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:46:18 2015 UTC,I think Sora is the Guardian of Kingdom Hearts. He has aspects of both Light and Darkness.
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,Mr_Lafar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:54:37 2015 UTC,For sure. He'd be less of an interesting character if he had no Darkness.
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,StrikerJaken,2,Thu Jul 9 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping it has a DMC ending.  Where it all seems good and happy, then sora and Riku have a battle."
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,StrikerJaken,0,Thu Jul 9 04:48:34 2015 UTC,"That part was what made that game worth it, so i forgive you for mentioning it."
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,HaouLeo,2,Thu Jul 9 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you went from talking about Xehanort to Sora's transformation. Xehanort has to be the ""final"" boss because defeating Xehanort concludes the Dark Seeker Saga, which is what the devs have been talking about for a while. If they were to have us defeat a Dark Sora or have Sora be taken over by darkness, that defeats the purpose of defeating Xehanort, concluding the Dark Seeker Saga and moving on to a new saga within the Kingdom Hearts series.  I'm not doubting that some kind of forshadowing similar to what you've said could happen, because it is possible that they may do something close to those lines, but it just wouldn't make much sense to me for them to do that.  After the defeat of Xehanort, I believe they may have some kind of chilled out, heart warming conclusion that may have a tidbit of info regarding the next saga, and if not, push it into the final chapter of this saga to keep the hype up. However, I don't think having Sora be taken over by Darkness in any way would happen nor be positive progression towards moving on to the next saga.  Props on that creativity, though; linking together all the games in a way to possibly theorize another possible ending."
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,LegoStevenMC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:06:02 2015 UTC,"I would imagine he is, but if we get to play as other characters then each could have their own boss or at least help Sora fight him. I hope it's each light up against their respective darkness. Ven vs Vanitas, Lea vs Saix, Riku, Aqua, Kairi, Terra, I assume Mickey, and then Sora. We have more darknesses than lights, I don't know how it'll all play out."
KingdomHearts,3clj3k,HaouLeo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:11:22 2015 UTC,I thought the direction was more to the point that light and darkness have to coexist instead be in an eternal struggle. That's why sora is okay with not becoming a master at the end of DDD. Choosing one side isn't the answer.  Riku has shown him that it is possible and he faced these situations as well.   Sora isn't pure and never claimed to be. He just wants to do what is right.  He has a heart that connects people. That is his power (now he sounds like a persona character haha).

The great thing about limits is that you are invincible during them so you don't need to worry about taking damage. Use flare force to stun LW and knock him in the air, then just go after him with your keyblade. Use a megalixir when necessary (you are going to want everyone in your party to have their stock filled) rinse and repeat. Between limits just try and avoid being attacked."

I had just finished playing FF7, really enjoyed it, and my brother was like ""There's this game called Kingdom Hearts, and it is a mix of Disney and character from FF"". Obviously I was intrigued. I played through the first game, and thought it was great. I loved the mingling with the Disney worlds, some of the comedy in the game is just too good to pass up, and it was a game that even as a 10 year old I could understand.  Then I learned that there was Kingdom Hearts 2 (I started late). I immediately went out and rented it from a video game rental store near by. Started playing it and was highly confused (Thanks Roxas!) I figured I would continue playing and just see what comes of it. Once I started playing as Sora I realized what love felt like. The game was exactly everything Kingdom Hearts 1 was, but with a MUCH better combat system. Then I started getting in to the story, and loved just the complexity of it. It was the story that made me play it 10 more times to get the full story, and I'm STILL learning things when I play and actually watch the cutscenes.  The series is just super enjoyable, has a TON of replay value, and probably one of the best stories I've personally experienced in any video game.  As for how I rank the games it goes: 2>BBS>1>Days>3D>Re:Coded>Re:CoM  I should mention I've never actually play coded, and I can't stand that stupid card system."

Now every moment of the whole series gives me the real strong feels. That and the combat is just the best. Love the RPG feel, but instead of relying on raw numbers & stats on my character, I actually rely on my skill to time blocks, dodges, etc. Let's be honest, turn-based & ATB are just getting your numbers high enough to bash the enemy's numbers to a pulp. KH totally dodge(roll)s that bullet."

Got 2, and since then have been heavily invested in story, gameplay, and the unique inclusion of disney movies into each upcoming game.

So...everything about it, really! It's such a bizarre premise but as a package it just hits all the right notes with me (speaking of which, the music is also excellent). I can enjoy it for the gameplay while being swept along by the story; I never feel like I'm sacrificing one for the other.   Also, it's just sort of a breath of fresh air in a market where gritty games are quite popular; a brightly coloured, (mostly) light hearted game which doesn't hold back on a compelling storyline and delivers on combat.

Basically, KH (especially 2, BBS) is what I wanted from a real time FF game.  The story, characters and minigames are all welcome bonuses for me.  My favorite part of any of the games is the data battles in 2FM on critical.  Having that many challenging and interesting bosses that all require specific strategies is outstanding.

There's almost no expressing how happy I was to finally beat all the secret bosses in KH2FM on Critical Mode. It's just exhilarating. I wish more of the series had bosses as well-designed as KH2FM. I can pretty confidently say most of my love of the series comes from that one game. God damn I love it.

Then I went through Terra and Aqua. Plus it was interesting playing Terra after Ven, since it was Terra who Ven was chasing all this time, so it was cool to see what really happened after been left in the dark for a whole playthrough.

KingdomHearts,3ckf5f,adolfcritIer,3,Thu Jul 9 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of the ones I think are likely to be on the list have already been mentioned: Luxord, Repliku, etc.  The one I don't think has been mentioned is Eraqus, but I think he's an obvious choice.   For starters, there almost certainly is an Eraqus Nobody - he didn't die, after all, his heart took shelter with Terra, so his body probably reformed somewhere else, as is the case with Nobodies.  Not to mention, he's someone with great power who Xehanort respects - the natural choice for a vessel for his heart."
KingdomHearts,3ckf5f,DougMurphy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"there almost certainly is an Eraqus Nobody   Xemnas was Terra's Nobody as well as Xehanorts, that's why he genuinely refered to Ventus (who he was searching for in Castle Oblivion) and Aqua (whose armor he keeps in Radiant Garden) as friends.  Eraqus' heart was in Terra's, meaning that Xemnas would be his Nobody too."
KingdomHearts,3ckf5f,TriumphantBass,4,Wed Jul 8 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"No, no, no. That's not - okay, hang on.  Xemnas. Xemnas is the Nobody of Terra and Xehanort both because they were inhabiting the same body at the time that they become a Nobody, right? But Xemnas isn't either of them, because Nobodies aren't the people they're Nobodies of: They're the absence of a person, the shell that's left when that person leaves them behind. They remember the person they were, which is why they act like them - so Xemnas acts like Xehanort, Terra and, in all likelihood, Eraqus, because those are the people he used to be - but they aren't those people. If that makes sense.   And that's key. Xemnas is the Nobody left behind by Terranort losing his heart, because he's Terra's body that remembers Xehanort's heart, but when Eraqus and Xehanort lost their hearts by fusing them with Terra's, they would have left behind Nobodies as well. That's why Master Xehanort can return in DDD - that's not Xehanort from the past, that's the furthest along Xehanort in the timeline (we're told as much at least twice) because Xehanort left behind a Nobody of himself that his heart could return to.  That's why Roxas can exist simultaneously with Ventus' sleeping body (who is, in essence, also a Nobody - he's a body without a heart, after all, just not one that's walking around). Roxas is a Nobody that remembers being both Sora and Ventus, but he's still Sora's Nobody, not Ventus'.  ... Sorry, that got, um. Long. And enthused.  EDIT: This is also why Axel's insistence on being Lea, not Axel, after he gets his heart back is relevant. Lea isn't Axel. Axel is what's left behind in the absence of Lea - and while the Nobodies were developing hearts, they were becoming new people, not regaining the hearts they had before."

Apprentice Xehanort  Terra-Xehanort  Bulky Young Xehanort (different than the one with the cloak in DDD)  No Heart  Riku-Xehanort (Different than Riku Replica)  And I'm sure there's more.
KingdomHearts,3ckf5f,axelofthekey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:22:07 2015 UTC,I doubt anybody from Org XIII actually wants to become a vessel. Xigbar and Said are only down with it cause Xehanort/Xemnas already partially took over them. But the rest were being tricked.  I'm willing to bet the reason Marluxia and Larxrene tried to take control of the organization was because they figured out what Xemnas' real plan was.

KingdomHearts,3cky3z,ElectricLuxray,2,Wed Jul 8 21:06:09 2015 UTC,"I have friends who are great at the Dark Souls series and play Kingdom Hearts. They are all very good at it, but none of them have beaten Lingering Will yet on KH2FM. They tell me he is one of the hardest bosses they have ever faced.  Same for me, as as I've only beaten him twice. Both weren't on Critical mode though."
KingdomHearts,3cky3z,xarel1375,2,Wed Jul 8 21:34:42 2015 UTC,"The thing with Dark Souls is that the plot bosses are hard, and worse yet, the MOBS are hard and punishing, but even still they need a limit on difficulty cause otherwise no one would finish it. On LW's case, he is a secret boss so he can be as strong as the devs want him to, hell he can even be undefeatable and still some people will complete the story."
KingdomHearts,3cky3z,HaouLeo,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Dark soul bosses are inherently ""fair."" They're designed so that they can be beaten on your first attempt as long as you watch and react to all their moves.  LW and the Data Organization bosses aren't like that. Their moves don't have windups. Their tells are animations that you don't know are tells unless you've already played them a few times, and watched a few youtube videos."

KingdomHearts,3cky3z,ShinyGoombah,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:44:34 2015 UTC,"'Hardest' is very arbitrary. For example, Mysterious Figure in BBS is difficult due to his chaotic movements and tendency to use nearly unavoidable attacks, but the battle design itself is poor and is overall not very challenging. Lingering Will in KH2FM on the other hand is a boss who is also difficult, but that difficulty stems form how well designed the fight is. MF requires chaotic button-mashing nonsense, while LW need tactics, planning, and a whole lot of practice.  So personally, I think a better way to phrase your question would be ""What boss takes the most amount of skill to defeat"" and in that case, the answer is undeniably Terra's Lingering Will. Honorable mentions go to No Heart in BBSFM, and all of the Data Battles in 2FM."
KingdomHearts,3cky3z,VonFrank,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Like said, Mysterious Figure is THE hardest boss in the series - but only because of its poor design. Not only do you need skill to kill him, you also need a lot of luck and good RNG.  Lingering Will is the best boss in the game in terms of design, difficulty and awesomeness. The more you fight and practice him, the better you'll get. A handful of speed runners can kill Lingering Will every single time without a problem, because they know his moves inside and out and with practice are able to destroy him with ease, but when it comes to the Mysterious Figure in BBS, they manage to kill him 20-50% of the time, only because the moves he does are not reactable, but rather you need to predict what he's going to do. If you predict wrong, you're dead. When I finally beat the Lingering Will, I felt great, euphoric even. All that practice finally paid off. When I defeated MF, I felt a bit less annoyed and relieved because I didn't have to deal with him any more.   Lingering Will: The Best Boss in The Series  Mysterious Figure: The Hardest Boss in The Series"

KingdomHearts,3cju5h,TheAktio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:19:21 2015 UTC,It is hands down my favorite series. I grew up with PS2 and played 1 and 2. Luckily had a gameboy so I played Chain of Memories. After that I didn't have any of the consoles because I switched to Xbox 360. No regrets because KH games didn't come out til recently on it and KH3 is on X1 now! Win!
KingdomHearts,3cju5h,TheAktio,2,Wed Jul 8 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"Ok. It´s great you wanna get into the series! ^ Provided that you own a PS3, you can get most of the games since the HD remixes. In ""Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix"" You get the first game (in final mix version, which means plus some extra content) and the game in between 1 and 2. In ""Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD Remix"" You get KH2 in final mix version and birth by sleep in final mix version (Which was the psp game).  if you want to enjoy the series to the fullest. The games should be played like this: Kingdom Hearts 1 --- Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories (Which is part of 1.5) --- Kingdom Hearts 2 --- Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep (which is a prequel to KH1) or/and Kingdom Hearts 365/2 Days (DS) --- Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded (DS) --- Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance (3DS)  Now, there are 7 games in the series, and these were only 4. The first 2 of the 3 are DS games, that can be skipped (Since the gameplay is a bit lackluster) and you can watch the cutscenes remade in HD that you also get from 1.5 and 2.5. The last game is a bit tricky, since DDD (Short for Dream Drop Distance) is a 3ds game and is not available anywere else. So to play that game you need a 3ds, which can also play the DS games if you want to :)  All games are important for the plot of the series, with 1,2, birth by sleep and DDD being the most important.  Hope I cleared up something!"
KingdomHearts,3cju5h,Fritztrocity1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed explanation! That helps a lot, I was pretty confused as to which order the games should be played.

KingdomHearts,3cepd0,Auragazer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"If the chains can slide freely, you can pull it around so that the clasp is near the front. That way you can see the clasp and chain as you try to connect it. This doesn't help if you have trouble with the little lever thing on most clasps, but it at least means you can see the little circle you're aiming for. If they can freely move, it also means you can very easily replace the chain with a longer one (there are tons of options on Amazon) so you don't have to deal with the clasp at all.   (I'm sorry if you know this already, some people don't wear jewelry and might not think of pulling it around and trying it in front of their face. :) )"

KingdomHearts,3chb02,Draydii,4,Tue Jul 7 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't even worry about it. I feel like the only thing that really transfers over from the FF series is the Cloud vs. Sephiroth thing. The only reason I could see playing FF7 before playing the series is because the first time you see Aerith in KH1 there is a decent pause of just staring at her face. This is to give people some time to freak out that she's alive, so if you want her to have that experience then FF7 is the only game I would suggest (for this scenario. She should play all from 6-X imo)."
KingdomHearts,3chb02,ShinyGoombah,3,Wed Jul 8 03:29:50 2015 UTC,I think Auron in the Underworld also fits in very well. It's almost like it fills the gap between his first Yunalesca encounter in FFX and when he travels to Zanarkand.

KingdomHearts,3cfquw,Caliburn0,7,Tue Jul 7 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, so, we don't have any kind of numbers, because 1) timeflow between worlds and 2) Kingdom Hearts is allergic to timelines outside of Days. It's almost definitely not within anyone's lifetime, though. Here's some things we do know:   Kairi's grandmother kind of refers to it as a fairytale rather than A Thing That Happened. It's possible she's just making it more interesting for Kairi, but no one else is really familiar with it. We also know that the walls between worlds were created in the aftermath of the Keyblade War, but how many people know those are there? How long does it take to forget you could go further, or that the way to leave isn't to get on a raft and sail? (Probably more than one lifetime.) Xehanort wants to recreate it because he doesn't know what happened. Yen Sid tells you ""To this day, many legends are told of the Keyblade Graveyard, but what in these legends is true? Not even I can say for certain. Tread carefully, Aqua."" ""Wait, Xehanort. There is a reason the precepts bar us from such knowledge. Why do you seek the X-blade? Would you blanket all the worlds in darkness, reduce them to nothing!?"" seems like pretty good proof that Eraqus and Xehanort weren't there, at the very least KHX is leading pretty directly up to the Keyblade War (because KHX is five factions of Keybearers competing over who can collect the most Light from the world and there's no way that could go wrong) - and Master Xehanort's Keyblade, the Sixth Foreteller's, is special because it's 'the most ancient.' I really don't think that would make a difference if it was only a lifetime older than the other Keyblades currently in use.   You do travel to other 'worlds' in KHX - but they're not exactly. The Book of Prophecy can create a pretty solid illusion of the future version of events (people and places included). This is where the Keybearers are going in order to collect Light from the single large world they live in."
KingdomHearts,3cfquw,beribboned,2,Tue Jul 7 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"Wait, why are they collecting Light from illusions of future events of all places? Is there any actual reason other than SE trying to put in Disney worlds without breaking the timeline?"
KingdomHearts,3cfquw,merqury26,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we only have one character's word to go on at the moment (and I think they're likely reliable, but they're pretty mysterious). Ephemera says ""it's because those other places are too far to travel to, even though we could physically get to them"" (although because of the way the Book works, they've got to be future versions). If you Ctrl+F ""12-1"" here, you can read pretty much all that's been said about it in game.  Past that, I'm honestly unsure how strong the KHX Keybearer is on their own - the card deck mechanic is explicitly what makes you stronger, and it only works because you're in the Book (and in-game if you de-equip your deck you're absolutely useless). It could be that the Foretellers discovered this is the only way for them to be able to collect enough Lux to make a difference?"

In case you don't know, the Final Mix versions of the games come with new abilities, areas, bosses, and so on, but the overall experience is mostly the same (imagine it's the same game with patches and DLC).  edit: You should also look for 1.5, which comes with KH1 Final Mix, Re:Chain of Memories and a 358/2 movie, for the complete Kingdom hearts experience."

Take the emotional breakdown I had during 358 / 2 days, and crank that shit up to 11.  combat as smooth as butter. Personal gripe, but I'd prefer to avoid all the triangle pushing. I'd rather do the epic actions myself over having Sora do them for me. Many many more worlds. A blu ray can hold 50 gb of data on it. The original Kingdom Hearts was right around 2 gigs if I recall correctly from toying with an emulator. That means that this game can without a doubt, have much more content than the original 13 worlds that KH1 had. I'm hoping for at the very least 25 worlds, but hey, more is always appreciated. MORE MUSIC! This one is self explanatory. The music in these games has always been one of my favorite parts (Swim this Way, anyone?) and I'm expecting some really epic tracks to jam out to while I bash heartless with my giant key. Make me want to use Donald and Goofy. They were just baggage in game, seriously. Upgrade their AI a little bit to make them actually viable in combat. Open worlds with tons of secrets. One of the major issues with the original Kingdom Hearts games is that once you beat the worlds.... that was it. Besides a few secret bosses, and maybe a hidden off zone, there really wasn't all that much extra to explore. I want giant areas that aren't even mentioned in the main story, and you have to go back to on your own time in order to look around, find secrets, find treasures, and beat some very strong heartless. I'd also love for sidequests in these areas, but that might be a bit too much to ask for. Multiple playable characters (or teams). It'd just be cool to see every characters story from a different perspective. Maybe even include one of Xehanort, so we can see what his drives and motives are throughout the story. Winnie The Pooh plz. I want to see Winnie the Pooh come back. It was such a charming break from the rest of the game.   *Woo, that was a long list. That's just about it for me."

Alice and Wonderland introduced us to the princesses of hearts, with Alice being kidnapped. Atlantica had Triton explain how the worlds intertwine and such. I just hope that all worlds have a purpose for being worlds. KH2 I feel had less of this, and they just had random worlds that didn't intertwine.

The game is already getting larger worlds that apparently don't have much wasted space.  Chests were harder to find in 3D and they likely will be in this game too.  Awesome. The game is already getting an augmented form of flow-motion that lets you move like a normal person in an action game and seems as if it will be used more to facilitate your attacks than to actually cause them like it did in 3D.  Great. The game is already giving you more control over many of the more epic attacks, only relegating some of them to ""press X to win"" scenarios.  Wonderful. The most important thing I want is a well-paced story that doesn't take itself too seriously, doesn't repeat things too much, doesn't hide things too much, and gives enough development/closure to all important characters.  These are things that the KH series has had problems with thus far.  Specifically, I don't want the story to be sectioned off into three large areas like in KH2, and I want them to address that whole ""Sora is not the chosen one thing"" as much as they seem to want to address it.  If it's part of the story of this series than they need to go with it. I would like to play as other characters, if only for a small amount of time.  High on the list are Xehanort, Riku (with Mickey as party member), and Kairi and Aqua, though only one or two of them would really need to be included. Related to the last point, the series needs to do right by its female heroes, Kairi and Aqua.  There is great potential in them and just seeing footage of them being badass will make a lot of people more excited for the game, I know that. I would like one scene of comparable emotional intensity to the ends of KH1 or 358/2...But it can't be TOO melodramatic or stupid.  I don't think I'm asking too much here. A magic system where we will be frequently and easily using different spells.  It looks like the game will already have this, along with the ability to switch between different Keyblades instead of just using the strongest one, which is really cool. Radiant Garden and the World of Darkness in stunning PS4 graphics.  I'm not going to talk about any Disney worlds because that's asking too much.  I'll let them make the decisions there. Enough postgame content, preferably a cool secret dungeon like KH2FM had.  Not really necessary though. Like lyoncobalt says, I would love to be surprised.   I don't need to mention things like a new theme song, or new reports, or epic bosses because there is no way the game will not feature those.  I might also like to see the TWEWY characters again.  ""BWAAAAAH!!"""
KingdomHearts,3cdog5,UmanTheInimitable,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:07:01 2015 UTC,"So far I'd say the No. 1 thing that KH3 needs above all else is to finally make it so that it feels good to hit things with a Keyblade again. Just make it so that when you're wailin' on dudes with your Keyblade it feels just as good as it did in KH2. If they don't get that right then it probably won't be as good as KH1/2, at least for me."

I don't hate 3D's story but you just don't casually throw in time travel without establishing it's rules and limitations early on otherwise you get people saying ""Why didn't you say/do this to someone to prevent event x and y?""  But to Nomura's credit he established what someone traveling through time can and cannot do that being they have to go to a point in time in their lifespan meaning it can't be before they were born when they come back to the present they lose all memory of time traveling.  BUT what's not explained is why it has to be a heart, why certain events cannot be altered, and if he imparted the ability to time travel to a younger version of himself then wouldn't be affecting the timeline anyway?

KingdomHearts,3cdtx2,JOHNOTHEYDIDNT,9,Tue Jul 7 18:24:24 2015 UTC,Kairi interacting with Disney characters = yes pls.
KingdomHearts,3cdtx2,pink-cactus,0,Tue Jul 7 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"3 campaigns. Sora, Kairi, and Vanitas. After Birth by Sleep and 3D made such a big deal out of their multiple campaigns, this shit better match up!"
KingdomHearts,3cdtx2,Zeebor,3,Tue Jul 7 04:33:31 2015 UTC,"I fell more like Riku, Sora and occasional additional missions for other characters - Xehanort (to see the other side in action), Mickey (it's not like we saw him in a lot of action) and others. Also, I would actually like to play as Leon or Cloud - their fighting patterns are awesome and it would be fun to see their full potential. Also, Yuffie - just because :)  I don't see playing as Kairi unless it's a tutorial. Both Riku, Sora and practically everyone else are streets ahead of her in terms of mastery and if you put her on par of them in one game... well, that would seriously diminish Riku's and Sora's achivements in mastering the Keyblades."
KingdomHearts,3cdtx2,demafromua,2,Tue Jul 7 13:46:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know...we really don't know how good Kairi is with the keyblade. I mean, yeah she pretty much just got it, but that doesn't mean she might not be great with it."
KingdomHearts,3cdtx2,GhostOfMuttonPast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and those were spin offs. DDD was a Riku game, but the numbered games tend to be Sora's story. In fact, I'd like the series to, going forward, have the numbered entries be Sora's story while the in-betweens are the stories of others, kind of like they've been doing with the exception of CoM and to a certain extent Coded."

KingdomHearts,3cdtx2,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"The second one. BbS was fantastic cause you saw the end of their lives from their own perspective. You knew why Terra seemed to just be fucking up wherever he went, or why Aqua was always two steps behind. In 1, Riku's just a pain in my ass, and Kairi? Shit, Princess Peach at least sent letters. What I'm getting at is that, despite being on portables, Sleep and Distance felt bigger than 1 and 2 because you could see the worlds from multiple viewpoints, instead of just locked in to Mr. Bigshoes and the chuckle-bunch all the time,  That, and I just really want a villain campaign. Go to each world, fuck it up, and then switch to Sora to un-fuckit. Again, like BbS, but the fucking would be more like Overlord, where you find strategic places to drop Heartless and Unversed."

Off the top of my head:   The postcards in Traverse Town that give you different things when you mail them Puppies, of course There's a missable Red Trinity in Halloween Town, if you're not playing 1.5 - just get it before you clear the world ... Trinity Marks, on that note There are some alternate cutscenes if you do worlds out of order (like Monstro after Hollow Bastion first visit)"

Also, be sure to go back whenever you get new movement options, like high jump, as you can often get treasures or trinities you couldn't reach before.  There are also a few superbosses you can fight towards the end game."

KingdomHearts,3cd4sf,AvadaNevada,6,Mon Jul 6 23:55:59 2015 UTC,"Not really! Chi has a big cash shop (and it's expensive), but here's some things that are cash only:   Key Art cards (the only difference is aesthetic; all cards max at the same stats. They're usually just official art/fancy renders instead of the plainer renders normal cards use) Costumes (aesthetic only; these tend to be really fancy or based on existing KH characters. There are plenty of non-cash shop outfits as well) Mega-Potions and Mega-Ethers (please note: I have over 1000 potions and 800+ ethers, and I use them pretty readily; it's not hard to get AP/BP renewal items) Some other misc stuff that's attainable in-game (cards that boost the stats of another card, skills, gems for ultimizing, etc)   If you're trying to be The Best you'd have to spend money, but I've spent plenty of time in solid A-class teams and I've never dropped any money. I am hoping that Unchained will be rebalanced for what seems reasonable for US players, because here's a current Premium Box:  Roxas/Namine costume + hair, two Key Art cards, 14 SR+ Moogles and SR+ Yen Sids, 6 SR+ Fairy Godmothers, 7 Ult Attack Moogles, 3 Attack Up VI and Combo Plus II, 6 each of three gems, 45 Mega-Potions and Mega-Ethers, and 5 million munny - 9000 charge munny, about $110  Everything in here is useful (the SR+ Fairy Godmothers and Attack Up VI/Combo Plus IIs are probably the hardest to get in-game) but holy shit, I would not pay that kind of money for it.  You don't need any of those items to play through the story, though! Story missions are pretty easy (and when they're not, their AP cost is low so you can just chip away at that boss's health until it goes down)."
KingdomHearts,3cd4sf,beribboned,3,Tue Jul 7 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Nomura commented on this very issue in one of his interviews saying that he really didn't like games like that and wanted Unchained X to be an actual 'game' and not...well, ATB."

KingdomHearts,3cd4sf,HaouLeo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:28:57 2015 UTC,Well yeah it's a cash grab but then again I'd say that most of the KH games are cash grabs. Not that they aren't enjoyable cash grabs. As long as it's free and has some of that sweet/stupid Kingdom Hearts lore I'm all in.
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,heart-station,9,Tue Jul 7 01:20:12 2015 UTC,"""Let's be honest: not one damn person on this sub is going to skip KH3 regardless of the world lineup.""  This is the stuff that makes me scratch my head the most. When someone goes, 'If they put [insert franchise] in KHIII, then I quit!' Like, really? Because they put in a franchise you don't like, you'll write the whole game off just like that?   I mean, I didn't like how they handled Pirates of the Caribbean in KHII at all and I still think it's a great game. Actually, I didn't like how they handled a quarter of the worlds in DDD (La Cites de Cloches & the Grid) and I still think that's a good game."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Kaweebo,2,Tue Jul 7 01:33:45 2015 UTC,Same here. But I think Marvel and Star Wars can be totally badass.
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Draydii,2,Tue Jul 7 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If Squenix can use Marvel/Star Wars in KHIII, then there's no reason they shouldn't. Sure, some people will moan and groan but ultimately it'll probably increase the sales overall. Same thing with people saying that they shouldn't include Frozen. Do people really think they're not going to include one of their most (if not THE most) successful movies ever because a couple people might be annoyed? Especially with a possible Frozen 2 on the way."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,aberrantcomposer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"Two things: Frozen 2 has been officially announced and Frozen is not just successful, it's literally the most profitable animated feature of all time."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,ShinyGoombah,0,Tue Jul 7 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"Plus, even if people dislike the story, characters, etc., Kingdom Hearts has never had a true ice themed world in its history, the closest it's come is Christmastown in the Nightmare Before Christmas world in KH2. It would really be kind of stupid to pass up Frozen for KH3."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,ShinyGoombah,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:49 2015 UTC,"I really like this, because it's absolutely true. These are all great, and Square would make them all work for their story.  The only part I want to argue is that there are some situations where someone saying they don't want a world in the game is not really a bad thing. This is mainly because most threads are titled ""Would you want [insert universe] in KH3?"" in which case you can't be upset with people if they say no to Star Wars, Frozen, etc. It's their opinion. I don't want Star Wars or Marvel in the game because there are several movies that Disney has owned for years that are not in the series so far, and would be great (Jungle Book, Toy Story, and more). Does that mean I think Star Wars or Marvel should NEVER be in the series... Lets see how I feel after SW episode 7. Lol.  The other example I have, and I got downvoted for this in another thread so it might happen again, but it's ok :). People are now bringing up Pocahontas as a world in KH3. I never want that in the series. That's nothing more than me as a person thinks that Pocahontas is an awful movie. I can't stand how horribly inaccurate it is.  My point of this comment is that there are times where not wanting a world can be justified."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,crazycriv,3,Tue Jul 7 15:37:07 2015 UTC,I'm absolutely not saying don't have opinions. I'm saying don't be petty and vindictive about it. Don't drive people away for wanting something and don't shit on SE for appealing to the broadest audience. There are worlds I don't want. But I trust the team to make the best game they can.
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Xeilith,2,Wed Jul 8 18:05:13 2015 UTC,Ok. I am in total agreement with you. :)
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Xeilith,3,Tue Jul 7 12:54:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, opinions are wrong! What the heck? It's perfectly reasonable for people to have reservations about certain franchises being included in the game. ""We all know you're going to play it anyway"". Does this give square enix license to deliver a sub par game? What's wrong with wanting it to be the best it can be?"
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Xeilith,-7,Tue Jul 7 13:09:14 2015 UTC,"Did you even read the OP or any of the comments? FFS.   Explain how Star Wars, Pixar, Marvel or any other Disney IP precludes KH3 from being a good game. That's ridiculous."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Xeilith,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"I feel that Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and so on (Pixar especially) would fit better into a future games. Just not 3..."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Xeilith,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:53:19 2015 UTC,Do you think any of those would impact their ability to tell the story they want to tell? Particularly when they get full autonomy to choose what worlds they want to incorporate?
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Sea-Salt,7,Tue Jul 7 10:51:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, kinda'.  At least for Star Wars and Marvel as they're currently ongoing series', as well as huge sprawling franchises. The Star Wars and Marvel universe's are still being ironed out in Disney's hands.  Pixar on the other hand I would simply prefer if in one of the next Kingdom Hearts's all its worlds were Pixar movies. From a themeing standpoint."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Jack_Ryker,0,Tue Jul 7 01:33:34 2015 UTC,Do you not trust them to be able to tell their story?
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Phoxxent,3,Tue Jul 7 01:36:50 2015 UTC,Not as well as they might with other worlds.
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Phoxxent,0,Tue Jul 7 01:57:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree and as this is the only time that Disney has given a damn about the series thus far and are actually assisting the creation of KH3, anything that helps them get a bigger ROI would be good and increase the likelihood of the series continuing. Keep in mind that SE still has to get permission from Disney before they can make any KH games. If this doesn't knock it out of the park, they may well cancel the franchise. They've cancelled moderately successful game series before after all."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Xeilith,3,Tue Jul 7 02:01:37 2015 UTC,"Somewhat off topic, but that last line hit me like freight train.  Moving on.  It's just that, Star Wars and Marvel are huge, I'm having a hard time thinking of what of their universes they could put in or how. Especially since they both have several big movies on the horizon that could completely change the status quo of their existing continuities.  Even if they took a conservative approach and tried putting in something like Star Wars Rebels, that's still being made and isn't yet super well known. As for Marvel, they could technically go for non-cinimatic universe Marvel, in the form of a comic or something, but that probably wouldn't go over to well either.  -  Also something that hadn't occurred to me is if using Star Wars would clash with Disney's deal with EA."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Phoxxent,0,Tue Jul 7 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a fucking Spectrobes fan. Not only was it successful: it was the number one game during its release month. Series is dead now.     Big Hero 6 and Star Wars Rebels.  Also, Lego Star Wars and EA coexist as does Disney Infinity 3.0, so I doubt that will be an issue."
KingdomHearts,3cdezr,Phoxxent,2,Tue Jul 7 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"The EA deal must only govern non Disney games, I guess, like games from EA's rival companies."

Go get all the Xehanort Reports - you're probably missing Report V, which Terra gets by defeating Sinister Sentinel in the Arena, or some of the large-chest ones Aqua and Ven get This should unlock Final Episode (you might need to re-beat the game as Terra, I forget). Play that! If you played Aqua on Critical or met the other requirements, you'll unlock Blank Points by beating Final Episode. (If you're playing 2.5, you'll also unlock Secret Episode.)"

Of course in the secret ending (SPOILERS), we see him talking to Xehanort, but doesn't Terranort become apprentice Xehanort? Is Xehanort's heart, Terra's heart and Eraqus's heart all merged into Apprentice Xehanort's heart? If this is the case, then seeing as Sora defeated both Ansem SoD and Xemnas, then what happens? Master Xehanort is reconstructed, but what of Terra?  I know that in DDD, Xehanort says one Guardian of Light belongs to him, is this Terra?   Or... are we all wildly speculating because we really don't know as of yet?  I watched this and I thought at 4:40, it all made sense.

Yeah. He was talking about Terra, who didn't keep to the ""do not meddle in another world's affairs"" rule."
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,Xephon7,4,Mon Jul 6 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"But Terra never visited Atlantica, so unless he somehow travels outside of his world, or has contact with others from outside of his world, he wouldn't know."
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,Phoxxent,3,Mon Jul 6 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"This here is exactly the point. Terra's meddling caused people to learn about other worlds, who got out, caused more trouble from meddling, thus causing THEM to learn of other worlds. Case and point? Maleficent. Terrra may not have gone to Atlantica, but Triton knowing about other worlds was a direct cause of Terra's actions."
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,Xephon7,3,Mon Jul 6 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"But he wouldn't be able to attribute that to Terra, was my point, because he wouldn't know Terra is at fault. He's just as likely to be talking about Xehanort or Vanitas, who also wield keybades and cause trouble in other worlds."
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,Phoxxent,2,Mon Jul 6 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm thinking he's just as likely to be talking about the keyblade wielders of the Keyblade War, who presumably did bring a lot of trouble to other worlds."

KingdomHearts,3cbizh,leigonlord,3,Mon Jul 6 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"3D tells us that literally anything can grow a heart, I believe with enough meaningful interactions with others or something (someone correct me if I'm wrong).   Sora also blatantly says that Roxas, Namine, Xion, etc. all had hearts when he confronts Xigbar and Xemnas, after feeling their pain in the dream (and especially after getting Roxas' memories)."
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,limitbreaker77,3,Mon Jul 6 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Something that doesn't make sense would be Axel then. He's Lea's nobody but going as far as sacrificing himself to protect Sora would make me thing then that he also grows a heart, yet he get's his back? What would happen to this new heart?  Nobodies make no sense to me ahah, such as why Roxas/Namine look so different from Sora/Kairi and yet Axel doesn't change when he gets his heart back so Lea must look like that O.o"
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,limitbreaker77,2,Mon Jul 6 18:26:17 2015 UTC,roxas namine look different because their special (the kh2 secret reports explain it) and with axel i think his new heart and old heart just merged together. i have a theory that the reason even and dilan didnt wake up straight away is that their hearts didnt line up and couldnt completely connect.
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,Shispanic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:23:02 2015 UTC,"Heh, this freaking series right?  Ok, so we can say that /u/legionlord was basically right in that they merged, but it's a lot more nuanced than that. The heart in itself is kind of a transcendent thing, so Axel's old/new heart were pretty much the same. We saw this in action in 3D when Rinzler grew a heart, yet he somehow had the memories of Tron from KH2 and remembered Sora.   Roxas looks different because he took on Ven's appearance, since Sora was housing Ven's heart. Because why not. As for Namine, she's one of the biggest anomalies in the series and I have no freaking idea what's with her, haha. And yeah, Lea looked really similar to Axel already, which is why the appearance only changed slightly."
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,HaouLeo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:28:28 2015 UTC,"haha I was pretty ill when I wrote that so I'm not sure why I mentioned Roxas/Sora as I knew why he looked different haha but thanks. Someone I was watching online said that Namine is so different because Kairi's a Princess of light who shouldn't have a nobody or soemthing along those lines. Also, what's the deal with Vanitas looking like Sora? Isn't he extracted from Ventus before Ventus' heart connects with Sora? Seems like a huge Coinky-dink."
KingdomHearts,3cbizh,dustymons,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:30:11 2015 UTC,"Heh, no problem! Yeah, Kairi being a Princess of Heart sounds like a solid explanation.  As for Sora/Vanitas, I'm pretty sure Vanitas developed Sora's looks because they both acted as a compliment to Ven's heart at one point. Now it starts to get super theoretical, really, but I guess since Sora filled the space Vanitas' extraction created, they were weirdly linked?  Aka, more of Nomura's deus ex's coming into play :P"
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,VladimirPutinYouOn,25,Mon Jul 6 06:12:10 2015 UTC,You should get a ps3 and 1.5 and 2.5 more worth your money in my opinion.

KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,ShinyGoombah,3,Mon Jul 6 09:30:36 2015 UTC,"I myself would like for it to happen, because I hope to buy a ps4, but I think in this case it's not worth sitting on the idea when we have zero reason to think it'll happen."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,TarotFox,2,Mon Jul 6 10:35:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if they ported it, it would have to be the main KH team doing the work on it, which would delay KH3. So I'd really rather they didn't."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,demafromua,-1,Mon Jul 6 11:27:44 2015 UTC,"Um... Why? I mean, the game is done and they have the source code. A bunch of monkeys could do the port if you give them time! And I doubt that SE lacks good coders or that all of them are aboard the team that make KH3."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,TarotFox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Tai Yasue said so, not me."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,demafromua,0,Mon Jul 6 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"Well, that just means Square doesn't want to do the re-release. Really, porting an existing, well-documented game with available source code is nothing, it requires little to none artistic talent. I doesn't even need Nomura ir Yasue constantly overseeing the process.  So unless their engine is so fucked up that only original team knows how to work it - all they need is a team of twenty somewhat experienced coders that are familiar with PS4."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,TarotFox,2,Mon Jul 6 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"I mean they did manage to lose the entire code of the first game before 1.5 came out. They're not super organized over there.  Regardless, from the sound of his quote, there simply isn't an available team to deal with it besides the current team. Square is working on a lot right now. Yes, it would probably be a fairly quick job, but I'd really rather them just continue to focus efforst on KH3."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,theblackfool,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:36:52 2015 UTC,That's not how this works. Porting from PS3 to PS4 isn't that simple.
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,kairisheartless,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:40:19 2015 UTC,"But FFX was a one time remake, just like 1.5 and 2.5 are. They're not planning on re releasing FFX yet again but on a different console. That would make no sense, it's available. It's not SE's job to re release all these games to different consoles just for the market, they'd lose more money that way.   The way I've seen a lot of speculation based interview questions is that it seems the interviewee almost feels pressured to say maybe about these things, but which everyone blows out of proportion and claims that it means yes. He said they'll think about it, which most likely means no. There might be a market for it, but in my opinion it would be a bad business call to go through with it."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,demafromua,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"Well, that's bad. Also, that's why I like Nintendo so much — you can simply buy their latest console and enjoy all games over the years, yet with Sony you fucking have to own every single one they ever made, if you want to play all games in a series. And just imagine how hard it will be in ten years."

KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,TarotFox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"It's a mixed statement by Yasue. On the one hand, he says that they'll explore putting them on PS4 because they know that fans want that. On the other, he says it would make the KH3 development delayed. Personally, I think what will probably end up happening is that the remixes will get pushed out after KH3 is done, or perhaps in the gap time between a Japanese and American launch.   http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/first-kingdom-hearts-games-could-still-hit-ps4-and-xbox-one"

KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,IAintYourFriendBuddy,3,Mon Jul 6 12:35:44 2015 UTC,Great stuff. I remember having a horrible time with Riku in Hollow Bastian when I was younger and again with Ansems second fight  on Destiny Island.   Also if you don't have a ps3 but a good PC you can download BBS & KH2 and emulate them. You can increase the resolution and anti aliasing and it looks the same if not better than the remasters. Only difference being the health and command bars don't upscale so can look a bit stretched.
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,Xifar_,2,Mon Jul 6 10:43:14 2015 UTC,The textures also don't look as good. :(  I really hope they could somehow manage to get the remasters + KHIII on PC :(
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,IAintYourFriendBuddy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:03:45 2015 UTC,"I'm still quietly optimistic about KH3 on PC. Square Enix  been testing the PC market waters with recent releases on Steam and as far as I know they've done ok.   Even it only sells 50-100 thousand copies that's still essentially free money since its made on UE4 on a PC.   Hell even if its a shitty port I'd be happy, I doubt it would be too graphical intensive and would probably still run ok on most GPU's."
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,Xifar_,2,Mon Jul 6 10:35:53 2015 UTC,I hope they do release it 😊  I also hope they release the remakes if possible. PCSX2/PPSSPP are great but something with good textures and better performance is welcome 👍
KingdomHearts,3c9w1p,hMJem,3,Mon Jul 6 11:41:27 2015 UTC,"I've beaten KH1 more times than KH2. Probably 6 more times. Everyone says KH2 is better than KH1, but I just enjoy the flow of KH1. It flows together really well."

KingdomHearts,3c8i8g,c0ded_truth,6,Mon Jul 6 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"I think there's a high chance that this world will happen. Roy Conli (the guy at E3 when they showed Tangled) also produced Big Hero 6, and he says that Tangled was ""the first in a series"" of worlds that he's working on with square. So I think it'll happen.  I agree with a lot of what you're saying, and I do think it'd be a great world. At the very least if it doesn't make the cut, it'd be awesome to have Baymax as a summon."
KingdomHearts,3c8i8g,Vanderbloff,4,Mon Jul 6 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"I watched it for the first time yesterday as well, and I have to agree. It has a lot of potential to be a world, and it'd be cool to fight the minibots and maybe even use them yourself for Flowmotion action. If they could explore the space within the portal as well, that'd be neat."

KingdomHearts,3c8i8g,Syncroshade,2,Mon Jul 6 03:26:23 2015 UTC,"Agree with the BH6 World but get the feeling they would set it post-movie. I don't think they'd put something as sad as the fire in there. Still, would love BH6 and some sort of Baymax summon ;)"
KingdomHearts,3c8i8g,supersharp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:59:52 2015 UTC,"I kinda disagree. There are several points in the movie where Hiro would probably be like a buffet for the Heartless, and they could probably find a cool way to make Tadashi's death fit in with the whole thing about Sora growing up a little in KH3."

KingdomHearts,3c8i8g,Shispanic,2,Mon Jul 6 18:12:47 2015 UTC,"I loved BH6 and would absolutly love seeing it in a KH game, but I don't see it being in KH3 because of its late release in 2014 (November so it hasn't even been a year.) I feel that it fits perfect because of Baymax's struggle with understanding humans like the nobodies. I want it so badly but I can't see it because of its release being so close to now, but who knows it may make the cut because of its popularity.   Edit: Also would work really well if it followed Hiro's struggle with losing Tadashi(Movie Spoiler), and temporarily becoming an enemy."

I basically spoiled every game after KHII, some intentionally such as BBS because at the time I couldn't afford a PSP, and spoiled accidentally such as cruising on the KH Wikias late at night to find 358/2 Days/DDD spoilers.  KHIII will be the true sequel to my most favourite game, I will not ruin it over 'HYPE'"
KingdomHearts,3c8i0g,Rudgeyrudge,5,Sun Jul 5 23:12:08 2015 UTC,I will be cut off from anything KH as well if it gets released in Japan first. I'm really on the side of /u/snazzysnorlax in the hoping for a international release. I think it would be cruel and unusual punishment for all the other countries if Square did not do an international release.
KingdomHearts,3c8i0g,ShinyGoombah,2,Mon Jul 6 00:12:54 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be cruel or punishment. It would be licencing and leagal issues. Exporting a game is not done in an instant. They don't want to delay the game. That would make no sense.

It totally makes sense to try and release the game everywhere within the same week. Obviously it can't be the exact same day for everyone due to the fact that different countries have different days for new video game releases, but it makes no sense to release it for Japan, and then a month later release it everywhere else.

KingdomHearts,3c8i0g,ShinyGoombah,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know how all of this actually work, but it may be that licensing have to be done after the product is finished.

KingdomHearts,3c8i0g,Sc-pyK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:10:24 2015 UTC,A. if they get an earlier release for this game I am going to freak out because that is bullshit.  B. Part of my body is going to go in shutdown mode from the internet while the other half turns on a twitch stream and watch it's glory.  My #1 hope is it releases everywhere at the same-ish timee (like 24 hour window due to time zones). As soon as we get a release date I am taking one of two days off work and pre-ordering the digital version so I can start downloading it as release happens and I can play most before it gets spoiled.

KingdomHearts,3c8i0g,Stinkybeans93,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:33:41 2015 UTC,They seem to already have a lot of English voices recorded already so I would think the release will be international.  Square has been trying to put those FFXV update videos out at the same time worldwide so that really shows commitment to making things international.

KingdomHearts,3c6atc,zHydro,7,Sun Jul 5 11:19:41 2015 UTC,"I did, but I made it as a tub. Basically every 20 min you need to take it out and whisk the sh*t out of it, which is very hard when it is almost finished. You cannot leave any icy bits or they will be in the finished product.   Basically takes the whole day, so don't expect to be able to go out unless you want to ruin the ice cream.   Also if set your freezer as cold as possible to make it much easier."

KingdomHearts,3caiga,GhostOfMuttonPast,5,Mon Jul 6 11:33:05 2015 UTC,"That moment when you realize Disney is not the empire it used to be. It's as if their creative team has gone on strike. I mean, they can't honestly believe Toy Story 4 is worth the time in money can they? Lol. Thankfully for KH3 there are still A TON of Disney movies we have yet to visit. I just fear for future installments if Disney doesn't pick up their game."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,ShinyGoombah,4,Mon Jul 6 11:44:07 2015 UTC,"Since KH2 came out we've had; Cars Ratatouille Wall-E Bolt UP Tangled Brave Wreck-it Ralph Frozen Big Hero 6  that's without mentioning the numerous sequels and films that wouldn't fit in KH universe (Saving Mr. Banks etc.) That's just over 1 a year, so if a future major KH installment takes another 9-10 years, there should be another 10 films to use, not to mention the films they'll inevitably re-use such as Alice in Wonderland, Winnie the pooh and Peter Pan. Toy Story 4 has a case of the PotC syndrome; Kids will beg to see it and parents will take them. Doesn't matter how bad the films are, the kids want to see their toys come to life and pirates sword fighting."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,Syncroshade,2,Mon Jul 6 12:47:11 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I think Disney is still making a decent amount of movies, but if Square is going to take another 10 years to start the next story arc, then idk how much a lot of people are going to care. I mean, I will play whatever the first game is to start out the new arc, but if it doesn't interest me like this storyline did then that may be it for me. I can't imagine the people who play the series, but are not fully dedicated to it caring about the series after another 10 year break. That's just my thoughts on it, but I could be totally wrong."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,ShinyGoombah,2,Mon Jul 6 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"To almost counteract my point, there is a 10 year gap between numbered sequels but there were filler games, 3D is a main game also. I hope the next saga/arc is started by a home console game but the time it's taken to make 3 (unless being developed at the same time) kinda says to me that the next KH will be a minor/side/spin-off type game while they make the next big installment."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,Syncroshade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"Lol. I want to say that the next story HAS to be on console. This story has been amazing, and extreme complex. For Square to keep people on their toes about where this next arc is going, they're going to have to start it off big.  Also, I have a feeling Nomura knows where he wants to go with the next arc. He's been saying for years that KH3 is just the end of the Xehanort saga. I'm pretty confident that there is already a base that they'll be going off of. I think one of the biggest ""issues"" with what's going on over at Square right now is that Nomura is trying to manage two major titles sort of at the same time. Yes he's focusing on KH right now, but there is no way he is not keeping track of FF. What makes both series so popular (imo) is the way Nomura has fun with it. Things are very openended right to the last cutscene, and there's always little jokes, and I really believe that that comes from Nomura, and his presence is needed in both series."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,ShinyGoombah,2,Mon Jul 6 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there's no way he could give KH3 a satisfying ending without knowing what's coming next already. Also, I thought Nomura no longer was doing FF? I thought I read he'd been moved over and someone else had taken lead?"
KingdomHearts,3caiga,Syncroshade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:58:42 2015 UTC,Do you honestly believe that Nomura would just drop his baby like that? Would you?
KingdomHearts,3caiga,ShinyGoombah,2,Mon Jul 6 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"You're right, but I wouldn't think he has such an impact now that it would massively divert him from KH?"

KingdomHearts,3caiga,Syncroshade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"3D's not a numbered title, though the distinction's not a big one. BBS is considered by Nomura to be ""KH0"" though. (And ""filler"" is... not what I'd call the games that a big chunk of 3's plot and characters are likely to come from, but alright.)"
KingdomHearts,3caiga,beribboned,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:08:14 2015 UTC,"I know 3D isn't numbered, that's why I clarified that it was a main title. And I totally forgot about BBS. You think 3's main plot and characters will come from Coded or COM? They were the games I feel are filler."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,Syncroshade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"3D had the Chronicle line that Riku Replica ""apparently"" died, which is just asking for him to appear, Castle Oblivion still matters, there's absolutely something about Namine we're not being told that I'm putting money on being important, Coded sort of covered the ""everything can grow a heart/hearts are more than just data"" thing before 3D did, Jiminy's Journal is apparently a reversed version of the Book of Prophecy, which is super important going forward... so, yeah, they matter! I really don't like the ""filler"" designation for KH, because pretty much nothing that's canon is totally irrelevant."

KingdomHearts,3caiga,Syncroshade,3,Mon Jul 6 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"While Disney owns Pixar, they're still decently independent in terms of what movies they make. So that's not really Disney's fault, per se. Pixar says that they wouldn't be making Toy Story 4 if they didn't have a good enough story in mind for it, so I'm willing to give them a chance becuase they generally do know what they're doing."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,TarotFox,2,Mon Jul 6 13:14:32 2015 UTC,"Dude, it's a Disney series. They technically own even Sora and all the other original characters created for these games.  They're not going to suddenly give promotion for competing companies, and as a whole, the series is a big nostalgia trip for those of us who grew up watching Disney movies.  Jurassic Park is probably my favorite movie of all time, but that doesn't mean it'd make a lick of sense to make it a thing in KH."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,Sea-Salt,2,Mon Jul 6 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying that. Of course they won't. Shit, I've made fun of fan game concepts that have stuff like Naruto and Death Note worlds. All I was trying to say was that the more recent films by Disney don't feel the same as the Disney Renaissance films that I continue to watch and enjoy.  Thinking about it, there're tons of older Disney films and even tv shows that would be cool to see in 3. Darkwing Duck and The Black Cauldron come to mind."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,MIjdax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:03:05 2015 UTC,You got a point but there are still more than plenty good disney worlds to choose from. I would love to see disney's recess or Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears appear in kh3.
KingdomHearts,3caiga,MIjdax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I never brought it up, but I don't discount the old things. Darkwing Duck, Sword in the Stone, even Emperors New Groove would be pretty sweet. The point I was trying to make was with all these new kids films that're out, it's a little bit disappointing that I won't see them in a KH like game, but I understand why."
KingdomHearts,3caiga,legendofzelderp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:07:02 2015 UTC,Lets pretend that all cartoons ever made are from disney. Even than it wouldnt be very likely that we see a specific world we wish to appear in kh3. There are just so few worlds appearing in the games but so many to choose from. I for my part would love to see a final fantasy based world like the midgar world.
KingdomHearts,3c84u7,jayjay275,3,Sun Jul 5 20:11:18 2015 UTC,"You should probably beat Aqua's story, and then beat Final Episode (make sure you get all the Xehanort Reports, including the one Terra gets in the Mirage Arena) - the wiki is describing part of the secret ending there. (That scene isn't meant to be literal, though.)  Terra's body was overtaken by Xehanort. His heart still exists within it, in some form - I can't think of any way to get further into this without spoiling you for things you haven't seen, though."
KingdomHearts,3c84u7,beribboned,2,Sun Jul 5 20:19:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. Everything is beginning to become slightly complex. Would you recommend watching the cutscenes for DDD rather than waiting for a port?
KingdomHearts,3c84u7,beribboned,3,Sun Jul 5 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"It's pretty required (and weird enough that watching it is much easier than someone explaining it), so yeah, I think so! It's a fun enough game to play that knowing the story wouldn't really ruin the experience if it does end up being ported."
KingdomHearts,3c84u7,Illidan1943,2,Sun Jul 5 20:30:41 2015 UTC,Thank you for your time. :)
KingdomHearts,3c84u7,dustymons,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"The entire series is much easier to watch than explaining it, this is why people that never played or skipped some games think the series has an extremely complex plot (which it doesn't)"
KingdomHearts,3c84u7,dustymons,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"Beat Aqua's story fo'shizzle. Anyways, Terra's heart is still housed in his own body, and he is technically alive, but Xehanort took over Terra's heart, and in turn, his body. The final movie shows that Terra's just kinda chilling out in his heart, struggling to finally take his body back (but that hasn't been going to well). Anyways, that final scene with Terra and Ven confused the shit out of me too. It takes place during the final movie in BBS that you unlock by beating all three games on proud or critical mode, and then getting all the Xehanort reports (there are other ways too, but this way is the quickest). The scene itself is just supposed to symbolize that Ven and Terra are both waiting and hoping for Sora to help them. It never actually happens though. Hopefully that helps a little bit. EDIT: I forgot to mention! SPOILER WARNING! When Xehanort turned himself into a heartless and a nobody by sacrificing his heart, it is assumed that Terra's heart was sacrificed too. But, since Xehanort's heart and body have been restored for KH3, it is logical to assume that Terra's heart is still within Xehanort's new form and that he can be brought back hopefully."

KingdomHearts,3c4583,XPapaMoonX,2,Sat Jul 4 18:13:28 2015 UTC,It won't be on PS Now because the titles aren't available digitally.

KingdomHearts,3c4583,MyDayWasFappable,2,Sun Jul 5 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"I remember them saying at both the PS4 announcement, and the E3 following it that all PS4 titles with a retail release are getting a digital version. So SE might have to suck it up."
KingdomHearts,3c4583,legitxhelios,2,Sun Jul 5 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"I am hoping that KH3 will see a digital release, because I dislike physical copies and most of my library is digital out of convenience. I wasn't denying that future games in the franchise might see a digital release, just that as it stands the existing games likely won't. It's obvious that giving consumers more storefronts to purchase your title is better for the potential of that product to sell, one of these storefronts being digital. Because of thisand the fact that SE has published and released other titles digitally, it's very probable that the reason for this lack of digital availability seems to be out of Square Enix's hands and moreso a result of the conflicting rights of other property owners like Utada Hikaru and Disney. I should note that the last part is mostly speculation though."
KingdomHearts,3c4583,TarotFox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the reason we haven't seen anything about 1.5 and 2.5 on ps4 is probably because they are working on getting everything sorted out for a digital release, and don't want to get anybodies hopes up."
KingdomHearts,3c4583,XPapaMoonX,2,Sun Jul 5 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"...Or, as they said, it's because it would take away from development on KH3 and they don't want to do that?"

They work so hard on his outfit each game and it would be kind of pointless to change his outfit in every world.   I like that they choose 3 or 4 worlds to change his outfit in to give some variety and then keep him consistent in the rest. Just my 2 cents"
KingdomHearts,3c786i,snazzysnorlax,-1,Sun Jul 5 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"The ideal implementation would be like outfits in Tales or like keyblades. You don't have to use the Olympia in the Coliseum, but it's fun when you do."

KingdomHearts,3cae5w,iamtidus_,5,Mon Jul 6 10:45:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The song is stupid enough and its so confident in itself that it belonged as the lead song to the most beloved title in the series. It was great. It showed that MGS was still confident enough with itself that it doesnt take it too seriously and ruin it by being too pretentious.  But that's another conversation for another subreddit.   P.S. MGS3 was a complete mockup of a stereotypical Bond movie, and references it's intentions several times throughout the game."
KingdomHearts,3cae5w,HaouLeo,2,Mon Jul 6 10:49:22 2015 UTC,They picked a bond-like song because that was the spy hype in the west. The japanese version follows a different trend. Try listening to the japanese version. You'll be impressed... Maybe in a bad way.

As for Sanctuary I believe that it fits the Kingdom Hearts series very well. You can't really blame Utada for anything. In fact I would praise her for going from knowing nothing about the series to actually learning what the series is about, and making music around it. I hope she does another intro for KH3, because I think she's amazing."
KingdomHearts,3cae5w,HaouLeo,-6,Mon Jul 6 11:37:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I found lyrics for Sanctuary, went on Youtube and listened to it again. You are correct, it fits a bit better (like, if you REALLY want it to fit), yet... look up Miracle of Sound - that's how you do really diverse songs that are both tied to the games AND are independent enough to be listened to without any context. Utada, at least for me, failed miserably. BTW, I think I'll try to ask Gavin (MoS) make a Kingdom Hearts song - it might turn out to be a lot of fun.  These my favourite songs by MoS:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzlGgybMPn8 - Walking Dead (Telltale). Mah feels.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfvYHUWuq9k - Wolf Among Us. Quite original take, I wish he did more in this genre.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ2SE8sGSjM - Far Cry 4. Just pure badassery.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0trGRJs_IU - Witcher III. Favourite game, favourite book series... I am a bit biased here :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=939ACReWKfE - AC: Unity. Hated the game, yet I love the song.  And basically all of his other stuff, except parodies and some really weird experiments."
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,btdandurand,11,Sun Jul 5 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Since he changes outfits, he has an excuse to not have forms. They're a function of his clothing."
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,TarotFox,2,Sun Jul 5 08:16:56 2015 UTC,The forms are yes but the ability to dual wield key blades are not tied to the clothing. I would guess that until ventus is woken sora will be able to wield 2.

KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,Syncroshade,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:08:17 2015 UTC,"Yea that will probably be his ""drive forms"" it seems like keybalde transformations will be a big part. He probably can't dual wield in 3D since he has dream eaters and there would be way to many gauges."

KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,Syncroshade,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:30:34 2015 UTC,His Limits were actually pretty drive form-y. So they could have done something similar with Sora.

KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,Syncroshade,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:55:22 2015 UTC,That's talking about the actual ability to weild a Keyblade in general -- there was no inheritence ceremony. But when he dual wields he's still using Ven's Keyblade.
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,TarotFox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:43:53 2015 UTC,Is there proof to confirm this?
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,Syncroshade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:04:10 2015 UTC,"We know Ven never received an inheritence because that obviously didn't happen.   We know that Sora is dual-weilding his and Ven's Keyblades from a Nomura interview in, I think, the Birth by Sleep Ultimania."
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,TarotFox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"I believe his use of the word Inhereted is more to do with abilities in general, as opposed to the ""Inheritance Ceremony"". ""One of the concepts behind the KH series is that the main character Sora isn't special, he's just a normal boy. Yes he does have connections with Ventus' heart, among others, but he hasn't inherited anything from them. He's just a normal boy you could find anywhere."" The fact he points out that he hasn't inherited anything from any heart makes me think this, as not all hearts Sora is connected with can wield Keyblades."
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,Syncroshade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:30:38 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to contest? I basically agree with you, but since you asked me for proof earlier I'm confused?"

The only thing I have an issue with or at least, difficulty understanding is the Ventus keyblade thing. Nomura states that Sora hasn't inherited anything which makes it hard for me to then see how Sora's second blade is his. Like I said, I'm not functioning correctly today haha please excuse me"
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,Syncroshade,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:03:04 2015 UTC,"No, I get it. Here is the relevant quote:  ""4: Why can Roxas dual-wield?  Because he can use both Sora’s and Ventus’s Keyblades.     Sora can wield two Keyblades at once because he has Ventus’s as well as  his own. As Roxas is a part of Sora, he also can use two. In Days, Roxas  awakened his ability to dual-wield after fighting Xion. In KHII, once  Sora absorbed Roxas, he could also dual-wield. Roxas awoke his ability to dual-wield through his will to not forget Xion, who also wielded a Keyblade."""
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,TarotFox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, but we've never seen Sora dual-wield outside of a drive form except for in direct (ie., he takes another keyblade directly out of someone's hand) situation."
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,TarotFox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:44:29 2015 UTC,I believe it's because he's never been shown how to use a keybalde. So it's possible he can do all this stuff without his cloths or party members but is never shown how.
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,Highfivez4all,2,Mon Jul 6 02:58:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know about them being endgame abilities. They did a decent job in KH 1 with providing the ""shared"" abilities throughout the story. Granted, 2 of them were totally optional/missable. But getting glide after beating Neverland or Mermaid Kick from Atlantica made as much sense as his growth abilities in KH2.   I did much prefer being able to upgrade the abilities in 2, though. It felt much more RPG to me."
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,snazzysnorlax,2,Sun Jul 5 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"This is something I have been pondering. Playing as Riku in CoM, including the gba version, made me notice he also has a transformation style that allows him to play differently. After a certain amount of counters that triggers his transformation. For Sora its his drive gauge. In BBS a certain type of move triggers command styles. I think every character has their unique method of transformation, therefore I would guess it will stay the same."
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,CairoStarr,2,Mon Jul 6 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"I want them to bring Drives back, but play them a little smarter. Forms like Valor or Wisdom that had a compromise in exchange for the power they granted applied strategy. Master Form only exists to make Wisdom obsolete, although Final Form was that welcome End-Game Fantasy, almost like a true realisation of Sora's potential once you've overcome the story. Limit Form was appreciated because it was a medium that let Sora use his old techniques, and was a smart way to say ""Sora still remembers his old abilities, and this is how you can use them."" I think it's cool at the moment though how each Keyblade Master has their own abilities. Aqua, Ven, and Terra have their armour and transforming Keyblades and their Command Styles (although I still wish they were more individual), and Sora has his Limits and Drives. Different Masters using different abilities. :D"
KingdomHearts,3c6bmo,JohlBro,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"I love drive forms but I want them to feel more consistent I guess, like can't use them on lots of fights and time is very limited on them, it's hard to build different play styles with them since it's basically just an ""empower"".

KingdomHearts,3c4liq,Phoxxent,8,Sat Jul 4 20:13:18 2015 UTC,Dream Drop Distance is the only game - afaik - that has a subtitle option. I never bothered with it anyway because I prefer subtitles in my games despite not being hearing-impaired. It doesn't negatively affect my attention in any way and I don't find it intrusive except for when trying to make screenshots.
KingdomHearts,3c4liq,Kaweebo,7,Sat Jul 4 20:23:55 2015 UTC,"Well, it being the most recent bodes well for that option in 3, does it not?"
KingdomHearts,3c4liq,Phoxxent,3,Sat Jul 4 20:25:59 2015 UTC,More than likely.
KingdomHearts,3c4liq,Kaweebo,5,Sat Jul 4 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"I always use subtitles where possible but there should be an option, I agree."
KingdomHearts,3c4liq,greg225,2,Sat Jul 4 21:59:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree, its completely harmless and doest detract from the game either way so its just a helpful feature."
KingdomHearts,3c4liq,EdgeJosh,2,Sat Jul 4 19:27:00 2015 UTC,Yeah the new trailer made me think I might be very okay with that.
KingdomHearts,3c4liq,Armitaco,2,Sat Jul 4 19:28:43 2015 UTC,I wish we could have the original Japanese voice over with english subtitles but I don't see that happening :(
KingdomHearts,3c4liq,logic_minded,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:29:34 2015 UTC,That probably won't happen. The English voice acting for KH is bigger than the Japanese voices in Japan.

I do have clips of some stuff I've edited but even though I've edited a lot I haven't made an AMV before, and nothing I've edited is really ultra frenetic like the one you posted.  If I made an AMV it would likely not be edited that way so if you're looking for something very reminiscent of your own work I don't know if you could want to partner with me.  If I did set out to make an AMV though, I assure you it would look very competent and I would pay attention to where clips are placed and where cuts are made.  So let me know if you want to chat."

KingdomHearts,3c4uue,Kaweebo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"I really wish they didn't go with the he whole attraction flow ability. They just look like limits, to me, personally.

KingdomHearts,3c4uue,snazzysnorlax,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:21:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'd love to have my drive forms back. :/ And it'd be fun to get all those different skills with them.

I beleive he said that the groundwork in terms of the gameplay, basic framework, and utilities to make content are close to done. Once again, going off the top of my head of what I can remember, but I beleive he said it in a interview following E3."
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,KingUsername,7,Sat Jul 4 10:36:47 2015 UTC,Of course he's thinking about the secret ending. Do you think he makes up each scene as he goes? He has to have a plan in place so that he can work towards it.
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,TarotFox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think he means Nomura & team are currently working on the cutscene, which he mentioned in a recent interview while announcing they have decided the release window."

KingdomHearts,3c39wd,Bcraggen,7,Sat Jul 4 13:39:15 2015 UTC,"Considering that Square wants to get FFXV out BEFORE KH3, and it wouldn't make much financial sense to release them so close to each other. Q2 for FFXV, Q4 for KH3"
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,wetdirt28,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:27:22 2015 UTC,"First of all, It wont be. Quite frankly, I don't know if I want it done that early. I want KH3 to be a complete game. Given what Nomura has said about the development status, a Q2 2016 release would not make me feel comfortable from a quality standpoint."
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,CherryBomber92,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:08:50 2015 UTC,I know a different team is making it but we've seen soooo much of FFXV including a demo yet it doesn't even have a release date. I hope I'm wrong but I don't see KH3 coming out before the end of 2016 at the earliest.
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,medven,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"As a QA tester writing this from a AAA development studio, I can tell you, 100%, they worked on what they showed at E3 way more than the rest of the game so they'd have something to show. You can safely bet that a few small parts of Twilight Town, Olympus, and the Tangled world are the only things that are even close to complete, so they'd have something to show at E3. That's how we do it here, anyway. As for whether you're the only one that thinks it's coming out in Q2 2016, I don't know, but I will say it's somewhat unrealistic."
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,rd_Mars,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"Do... do we know it's done? We know enemy models weren't all finished as of December; character models in the E3 trailer still don't look entirely finished. We've seen small portions of three worlds, plus some of the opening of the game. The interview where Nomura mentioned the secret ending also had him talking about how he wasn't totally sure how he was going to end the game, IIRC?"
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,beribboned,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:07:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm still placing my bets on Q3 2016 since it should take them around 3 months to insert the final pieces and secret ending, and then another 5-6 of bug fixing, polishing, etc."
KingdomHearts,3c39wd,Cosmic-Warper,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:36:26 2015 UTC,I'm looking more towards early Q4 2016 so everything can be finished and ready for the holidays.

Do you have a long reach keyblade?  if you have the berserk charge ability equip it and use something like decisive pumpkin for its air combo plus.  Additionally, if not in master form, you can use Donalds comet to try and keep it in the air.  Just don't use comet rain finish; it takes too long and the mushroom will fall down.  Also, I've heard of a wisdom form strategy involving thundaga + berserk shots while thundaga charges?  Not sure if it's worth a try, never worked for me.  My own pass was sheer luck, master form with lionhart +ultima weapon, and perseverance.  Good luck.  :)"

KingdomHearts,3c2mg9,Era-Aestuo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, i just used berserk charge keyblade (fatal crest i think). Drop a curaga, and start mashing square or x.

KingdomHearts,3c2mg9,VonFrank,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's a matter of preference and preparation. 3, 10, and 12 aren't so bad because you can prepare for them quite well.   3, use Wisdom form for a bit of extra speed, equip as much Draw as you can and study his patterns a bit.   10, use the Pause button to track it, then beat the shit out of it.   12, use Wisdom Form with Thundaga and Berserk and go in a circle, locking on to anything you can.  8, while you CAN prepare, it's not easy by any means, it's mostly luck if you can keep it near you without it flying away from you."
KingdomHearts,3c2mg9,VonFrank,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"I know the proper strats for all of them, and yes, it is just a matter of preparing properly, but I feel that number 8 falls under that category too.

They're just as good as the other KH games.  Also, if you can't afford a plain DS at all then does that mean you actually watched that disaster of a 'movie' in the 1.5 remix for 358, because if so then you really owe it to yourself to play the actual DS 358/2 Days or watch a complete playthrough of it or something.

KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,joshuralize,5,Sat Jul 4 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"Terrible controls on the 3DS? It plays just like BBS on a PSP with flow motion which you can completely shut off... I want a HD version of it but it doesn't NEEDS one.   The game and console are still fairly new, and 2DS is there for cheap options, there are WAYYYY more games to play on 3DS than DDD. It's a system everyone should get honestly and if you don't then you are only missing a story you can watch on YouTube.  I much rather focus be on KH3 than another HD remake."
KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,Pizzaplanet420,3,Fri Jul 3 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"Not to mention you have the option of the circle pad pro, which lets it play like a full console game."
KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,GreyouTT,7,Sat Jul 4 10:55:42 2015 UTC,Just buy it a second hand 3DS and game and afterwards sell it again. No need for resources being spent on development of another collection.

KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,iSevenfold762,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:30:52 2015 UTC,"I don't want to say it's impossible but it's extremely unlikely any studio would do something like this.  343i seriously struggled to pulling off the Master Chief Collection, the amount of work that went into getting a PC port of Halo 2 to work on the Xbox One in conjunction with four other titles spanning two Xbox generations was unbelievable and 343i said it was a tricky task. The end product barely worked, so many features conflicted and were buggy, even after months of patches it's not 100% functional. 343i is a world class studio that boasts some of the most talented coders in the industry, Square Enix might not be up to a task like this not do I think they have the man power to do it.  Something like you're suggesting would be close to unmanageable, I can even imagine the how much can go wrong. MCC was porting across Xbox generations and using duct tape and prayers to get it to work, porting across multiple consoles would be hard. It's just too hard to be pulled off.  If you want to play them then try get an emulated to work and play the missing titles in your PC.  TL;DR: it's impossible, too much to do and not enough talent to do it. Across console generations, possible as proven, across consoles, not possible."
KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,Thom0,3,Fri Jul 3 14:25:59 2015 UTC,I don't want to say it's impossible  TL;DR: it's impossible   also as /u/jvbaker95 said it is quite possible

KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,Zoklar,2,Fri Jul 3 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Dream Drop Distance uses a modified version of the Birth By Sleep engine, which is itself a modified FF7: Crisis Core engine for the PSP.  It is very possible for the engine to be ported to the PS3/PS4.  It'd be a tough technical challenge to port it across two platforms, but it is very possible.  The MCC's biggest challenge was creating a universal UI to put all of that together, and they had to bring 2 games kicking and screaming from the 6th generation. The KH compilation was bundled together in its own separate environments, which is loads easier than the universal UI.  If BBS was ported to the PS3, it is possible for DDD, but they'd have to optimize parts of the game that uses a touch screen, as well as the camera."
KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,jvbaker95,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:57:52 2015 UTC,"Ps4 has the touch controller, which makes it even easier than say the xbone (khiii is going xbone right? Maybe that's outdated info). I definitely think it's possible"

KingdomHearts,3bzpw0,GreyouTT,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"Re: CoM is a PS2 game, not a GBA game. If you mean how well it translated to the PS2 from GBA, it was a complete from-the-ground-up remake, not just a port, so it's a different situation.  They're just saying that it would take more work on the development side to make a DS game look good on a PS4 because of the incredibly low resolution. It's certainly not impossible but they would probably have to actually remake a significant portion of the assets to make it not look like crap.  3D would be fine though, it's about the same as BBS, maybe even nicer looking so it would actually translate well visually. The challenge there would be implementing Reality Shifts."

KingdomHearts,3bzzpu,jayjay275,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you're going to need a 2/3DS no matter what, because KH3D is currently exclusive to that platform and the 3DS emulator is in its early stages. :( More fortunately, I'm pretty sure I just saw yesterday that Nintendo is selling refurb 2DSes for $60? That plus a PS3 would make you able to play every released game (DDD, 358/2 Days, and Re:Coded on 3DS, 1.5 and 2.5 Remix on PS3 - the Remixes have movie versions of Days and Re:Coded, but you have the option to also play them on the 3/DS if you want - Days has messy gameplay but lots of cute character interactions that didn't make it into the cutscene collection, Re:Coded's movie is better but the gameplay is honestly pretty fun), but that's a lot of money.  Anyway, if you have a good computer, you should be able to emulate 1/2/Re:CoM - maybe. A computer good at gaming is not necessarily good at emulation. (I've only ever run into one PC game my laptop couldn't handle, but KH2 runs at 35-45 FPS the second more than two or three models are on screen.) Days (use Desmume x432r, it makes it look gorgeous) and BBS are easy as hell to emulate - Re:Coded is a little more strenuous, possibly, but I may just be misremembering the fact that there's a fixable audio glitch."

KingdomHearts,3bwv6o,HaouLeo,2,Fri Jul 3 11:19:37 2015 UTC,The advanced magic spells are absolutely devastating too. Spend a couple hours melding commands and Aqua becomes a god.

It would be a big waste of time and kick in the face to the redditors that frequent /r/kingdomhearts if the site when private in protest."
KingdomHearts,3byos4,Classic1990,11,Fri Jul 3 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"Not being connected to Victoria isn't a reason not to do it. Fact is, this type of treatment from the reddit administration is not ok. The only way to show them that is to shut their site down. We are a smaller subreddit, so a good reason is that we don't really make a difference. But then again, every little bit could count"
KingdomHearts,3byos4,boodude21,6,Fri Jul 3 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, no one knows what is going to come of this.   On one hand, the admins might wake up tomorrow and see that they have been upsetting mods for a while and agree to come to terms with the private subreddits. On the other hand, the admins might hold their ground and not do anything at all, allowing the private subreddits to stay private, and who knows how long that will be. This isn't the first time there's been a big protest on reddit, and at one point there were subreddits that were closed down for weeks. I just don't see the need for /r/kingdomhearts to go through that when we don't even have anything to do with what is going on."
KingdomHearts,3byos4,Classic1990,3,Fri Jul 3 06:37:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Like I said, kingdom hearts is too small to matter anyway. All of my niche subs will probably stay up, so im not concerned. I'm gonna keep my eye on things though, and hopefully see some change, or at least a new competitor I can jump ship to. Reddit has been getting pretty toxic anyways."
KingdomHearts,3byos4,boodude21,5,Fri Jul 3 06:46:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely agree on the toxic part. That's why I don't want a subreddit as innocent as KH in on the drama."
KingdomHearts,3byos4,Classic1990,3,Fri Jul 3 06:47:51 2015 UTC,Protests are not toxic. The behavior that leads to the protests is toxic.
KingdomHearts,3byos4,TarotFox,3,Fri Jul 3 07:17:38 2015 UTC,Oh I completely agree. I don't really see the need for this sub to join in on the protest. Definitely wasn't suggesting that.
KingdomHearts,3byos4,Jack_Ryker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:00:30 2015 UTC,"It's funny, there was a post in /r/fallout about some bullshit Anita Sarkeesian said about Fallout 4, and there was a huge debate in the comments of course. I thought I got banned from the sub when I went back to check on mobile and the sub wouldn't load.   Then I went on my laptop and figured out what was going on."
KingdomHearts,3byos4,LegoStevenMC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:27:31 2015 UTC,At least /r/gaming and /r/movies are public again. Really missed those :(
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Gexus,17,Thu Jul 2 19:39:56 2015 UTC,Don't even play with my heart right now. I really hope she gives us a third song for the series. Simple and Clean can really only go so far.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,mwriteword,8,Thu Jul 2 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"Passion/Sanctuary, too. That one's been stretched quite a good way as well."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,CarolineJohnson,28,Thu Jul 2 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"I've been hearing her lament her experiences writing music for the KH series a lot recently, so I'm finding it a little hard to believe that she'd go back to doing something she's said she didn't enjoy. (That is to say, writing and then re-writing a song for two different languages for pay she didn't consider to be worth working for)  So, unless Nomura threw a ton of money at her, this seems like wishful thinking."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Kaweebo,9,Thu Jul 2 20:49:42 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on her experiences?  Or at least how much she got paid?
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,bzachery,17,Thu Jul 2 22:09:31 2015 UTC,She never gives an exact estimate for obvious reasons but here's an interview where she talks about it. I can't find where I heard that she was upset with pay specifically but she's said a number of times how frustrating and difficult it was to work on these songs.  http://www.khinsider.com/news/JETANNY-Interview-w-Utada-Hikaru-2547
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Kaweebo,24,Thu Jul 2 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"I had to make the Japanese version which was the song ""Passion"" and then the English version that was ""Sanctuary,"" and that was so hard, it's just, and it felt strained   Aw man. Sucks reading stuff like this. Glad she genuinely doesn't regret it though, because all of those songs are master pieces, in my opinion. Thanks for the article friend."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,bzachery,3,Thu Jul 2 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Translating songs is really, really hard. Basically, something has to be sacrificed in order to do it."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,0,Fri Jul 3 08:32:49 2015 UTC,the two songs are quite different (both in the case of simple and clean/hikari and santuary/passion).   She sold out when she made this is the one anyway =(
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Doomblaze,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:44:15 2015 UTC,Quite different in what sense? In terms of translation or just something else?
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,2,Fri Jul 3 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"Translation, in the sense they aren't translations. She wrote new lyrics in each language IIRC."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,LimblessNick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, which is what I meant by ""something has to be sacrificed."" You have tune and meaning, and you typically only get to stay true to one.  In Simple and Clean's case, both got sacrificed."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"They weren't intended to have the same meaning. They were different songs, to the same music."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,LimblessNick,3,Fri Jul 3 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"She talks about the pay issue in that very interview.  That said, you said ""recently"" so I thought that you might have something besides this one interview from 2009..."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:42:05 2015 UTC,"I'm stupid, in case that didn't come through earlier. I'd read that before and even skimmed through it to see if they talked about it before posting it here but apparently I'm so inept that I didn't even see it the second time around. Apologies.  However, when I said 'recently' I meant that I've run across instances where she's lamented the pay in the past. I guess I should have been clearer. That said, I haven't found anything more recent where she's talked about it, although the fact that Mr. Utada said pretty straightly that there had been no talks for her returning a couple years ago on Twitter (although he originally said she was) is probably another clue at there being something of a strained relationship between her and Disney. That doesn't necessarily mean anything on its own since KHIII would have just started production, but still."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Kaweebo,5,Thu Jul 2 23:58:33 2015 UTC,"I can imagine it being very hard for her. Not only does she have to rewrite her songs, but she has to do that under the constraint of relating to KH themes more or less, which I'm sure isn't fun for the artist to rework what they already thought was good on its own.   But given the importance of her music to the games, I'm sure they're accommodating enough for her to return. At least for 3."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Jack_Ryker,7,Fri Jul 3 00:53:31 2015 UTC,"What I'd hope would happen is that if she doesn't want to write the song in both English and Japanese, that they keep the Japanese song for both releases. It worked really well in Final Fantasy X."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,ClankerClunk,2,Thu Jul 2 22:08:52 2015 UTC,To Zanarkand ( the iconic melody of that game) was without vocals.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,LaronX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:58:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there's still a vocalized song."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:16:21 2015 UTC,Just saying that there is a bit of a difference between the most iconic song and the rest.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,LaronX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the point was that it was fine to have the song be in Japanese, not that it was the most iconic song. The song doesn't HAVE to be translated, it's not like people don't know they're playing a Japanese game and the lyrics are always only kinda-sorta relevant."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:20:46 2015 UTC,Passion and my sanctuary played in commercials. That's why it got translated. It is not about in game.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,LaronX,9,Fri Jul 3 07:33:41 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I didn't even know she was pregnant, either. Here's hoping things can finally be settled with Disney so we can have one of her songs ushering us into and out of KH III."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Sea-Salt,5,Thu Jul 2 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"There is so much misinformation about this. In 2009 Utada said she was unsure if she would return to the series while her father said she wouldn't return because they didn't get paid enough. That's her father saying she wouldn't return not Utada herself. Also that was a long time ago. The only recent news on her returning was in 2013 when her father (who was the one against her returning) actually said ""yes"" she would although there is nothing officially announced since they are certainly still in the negotiating phase. Here is the most recent article on the matter:  http://www.khinsider.com/news/Hikaru-Utada-To-Return-for-Kingdom-Hearts-III-3452  http://www.khinsider.com/news/Hikaru-Utada-To-Return-for-Kingdom-Hearts-III-3452"
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,jo1993,5,Fri Jul 3 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"You guys do realize she probably isn't releasing a song for KH, right?"
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,SilhouetteOfLight,3,Thu Jul 2 22:13:51 2015 UTC,First Love was my first love and I could die of happiness if it happened...but I really hope no one gets their hopes up too much.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Marowe,4,Fri Jul 3 00:35:11 2015 UTC,"Back in 2002, I heard an amazing song during a commercial for a video game. It was Simple and Clean. I bought the game just because of that song and became such a fan of the series as a result. Having Utada (a bi-lingual pop star) sing the theme songs has been a great decision on SE's part, and i can't see anyone else providing a voice for KH3. SImple and Clean and Passion (My sanctuary) are amazing."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Sorenai_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"Do you remember the TV spots for the first game? They were so incredibly good. I can't find them anywhere though, which is incredibly disappointing."

KingdomHearts,3bwodz,jamiedenton,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:22:07 2015 UTC,I really doubt it's for KH. If anything  it might just mean that she can do the work for kh3 aftee but I wouldn't hold my breath.   She wasn't happy. And if I remember correctly her contract was also part of thr reason for the lack of digital releases. But I am unsure
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,LaronX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"I would love her to make the song for KH3... However she shouldn't do it if she doesn't like it. I personally love the whole Japanese & English versions of the same song concept  They absolutely need a new theme. If they get someone else, I'm sure it'll be great."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,Stinkybeans93,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:43:01 2015 UTC,I personally want to hear Sanctuary again at some point during the game.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,CrustyCouch,2,Sat Jul 4 14:52:52 2015 UTC,"I'm glad she's coming back. Her voice is very tied into my KH experience, as well as Shimomura's score. Her work for Evangelion 3.0, ""Sakurai Nagashi"", reminded me how much I liked her voice. Just like Renka for the Fire Emblem IF soundtrack, I feel having distinctive pop voices integrated into video game experiences makes them that much more endearing."
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,cuddlemeyou,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:14:27 2015 UTC,Loved her composition for BBS and KH2.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,jayjay275,-1,Fri Jul 3 19:40:50 2015 UTC,Holy shit when is it coming out. I want to hear the song early before I hear it in the kh3 intro.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,6,Thu Jul 2 20:24:34 2015 UTC,We still don't know she's even doing a song.
KingdomHearts,3bwodz,TarotFox,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"Haha, no, we don't. There was a well-publicized miscommunication two years ago, and that's it. Her manager came back out to reiterate that nothing is confirmed, and given that she's had negative experiences, not exactly the most likely thing in the world."
KingdomHearts,3bysqz,Artificemonarch,41,Fri Jul 3 06:54:09 2015 UTC,"Nay, we need to keep our focus and ideals in check. Which is kingdom hearts. Not drama."

KingdomHearts,3bysqz,ShinyGoombah,4,Fri Jul 3 06:57:53 2015 UTC,Ok. So I missed what happened with subreddits going down. Why is this happening? Is there a point behind it? Would like to know the situation before I make my vote.
KingdomHearts,3bysqz,genshuku91,2,Fri Jul 3 11:31:20 2015 UTC,"/r/Blackout2015 has a good explanation of what's going on as well as a live list of all subs that are down or were down.   From what I gathered, it was the firing of an employee that was essential to the AMA community without any replacement system or individual waiting in the wings. This exploded the powder keg that had been brewing due to the lack of communication between the Reddit admins and the mods/users. It's not necessarily the firing of the employee but rather the lack of notification and sheer lack of care towards the various mod teams."
KingdomHearts,3bysqz,ShinyGoombah,3,Fri Jul 3 11:44:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, I actually saw a post on here from earlier that explained everything. I'm going to vote Nay. We don't do AMAs which seems to be the center of all of this. If we did AMAs here on the subreddit then I would say yes."

KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,silentnightowl,6,Fri Jul 3 00:56:06 2015 UTC,That came to mind too! This is definitely a possibility!
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,r3ncarnate,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:06:49 2015 UTC,Exactly what I came here to suggest.
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,Heat55wade,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:01:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's me! I can hook anyone up with the PNG file (transparent background) if they want. Originally I just wanted to save that for my (shameless plug) RedBubble page but it doesn't matter. I'll try reuploading it"
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,kiks493,11,Sat Jul 4 04:28:40 2015 UTC,Well Oathkeeper and Oblivion immediately comes to mind unless you're looking for something more complicated. Maybe Sora/Anti-Sora.
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,kiks493,2,Fri Jul 3 00:42:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm yeah I thought of that too, but I was hoping for something with a more romantic context or theme around it."
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,dfj2xxx,2,Fri Jul 3 00:44:14 2015 UTC,Sorry cant think of anything but good luck.
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,GrabToWin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:50:55 2015 UTC,Thanks!
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,Syncroshade,6,Fri Jul 3 00:54:20 2015 UTC,What about a Shadow and a Nobody?
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,AJ2KB,6,Fri Jul 3 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"Oh that'd be pretty cool! Or maybe the symbols themselves? Either way, I like that idea, it's like implying ""I'm a heartless without you."" or ""I'm a nobody without you.""   Pretty swell idea!"
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,Xzalim,3,Fri Jul 3 01:08:53 2015 UTC,He meant shadow as in shadow the hedgehog clearly. Just think about it  /s
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,JK_ing,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:31:18 2015 UTC,"Damn, I thought he meant Shado from Arrow. Thanks for clearing that up! :D"
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,maxsym718,12,Mon Jul 6 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else has said, and I personally would get the cave drawing on destiny island if I were ever to get a tattoo, I think these would work. If you're looking for romance/context:  Sora/Kairi maybe something like this scene.  ...But then there's this."
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,Busth,7,Fri Jul 3 06:03:46 2015 UTC,I think the second one is the best choice
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,NullFortax,5,Fri Jul 3 19:54:47 2015 UTC,Well obviously something to do with Oblivion and Oathkeeper. Maybe even Ventus and Roxas.
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,kazi_kami,5,Fri Jul 3 00:42:16 2015 UTC,"Darkness becomes light, light falls into darkness"
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,Syncroshade,5,Fri Jul 3 02:02:06 2015 UTC,You could do oathkeeper and oblivion.
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,infamousjensen,3,Fri Jul 3 03:48:24 2015 UTC,How about a wayfinder? Yours could have your partner's favourite color and your partner's could have yours.
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,GrabToWin,3,Fri Jul 3 06:31:22 2015 UTC,Oblivion and oath keeper are popular for black and white themes.
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,Syncroshade,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:18:25 2015 UTC,"I almost had Oblivion on my arm, while my friend got Oathkeeper on hers to match."
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,OnlyRussellHD,2,Mon Jul 6 13:32:25 2015 UTC,Riku  and Ansem-Riku  How about kingdom key and soul eater?  Edit. You could do Ventus and Vanitas
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,Yosheth,2,Fri Jul 3 05:55:19 2015 UTC,A scattered dream that's like a far off memory... That whole sequence is golden tattoo material
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,s1nz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:32:13 2015 UTC,"I've been having these weird dreams lately.. like, Is any of this real? Or not?"
KingdomHearts,3bxp0m,ike2009,2,Mon Jul 6 13:31:45 2015 UTC,i always really wanted this tattoo on the back of my shoulder or chest http://i.imgur.com/yzVGirJ.jpg
