Nationalism is bad for sure, especially the way words like patriotism and freedom and Jesus are thrown around by ruling classes to keep the working classes with their heads down and don't question too much authority for fears of being an antipatriot, or antifreedom, or gasp antichrist!  Fractured down into tribes, I think, is how humans have thriven and will thrive again. I have always been under the impression that to achieve Communism, we'll have to downsize. The larger a population, it will become exponentially more difficult to keep check things without a central government. The average person couldn't fuck over little Mrs. Rogers down the road who bakes the community cupcakes for their birthdays or the Smiths, whom they've been friends with for as long as they can remember; but, who gives a shit about Joe fuckin' Schmoe on the other goddamned coast?

The economic conditions (labor shortage, large factories, maybe even the return of periodic crises) are resembling 19th century Euro-America and the only thing keeping labor from forming unions and fighting for reforms is the rigid government-union system that stills attempts to uphold nominal labor rights and a union.  The western-facing liberal, while not their allies, at least undermines the legitimacy of the state-capitalist system and maybe open space for more radical voices (i.e. a French Revolution kind of process).    Besides, if anyone is going to put liberals in gulag, it should be us :P"

In many ways, East Europe lost during those years, when the socialist-reformists lost out to the liberals.  However, I don't see what there is to lose in this China.  60's China, sure, I would reject my own logic.  I don't see what could be lost in a transition from authoritarian capitalism to ""liberal-democratic"" capitalism.  I also don't see much benefit in that either, except the space it might open for the Chinese labor movement."
socialism,3e2ncy,Dragon9770,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"Reforming the Chinese labor movement has a built-in self-destruct mechanism, because the entire labor force demand in that country exists solely due to the lack of workplace regulation and rights, and access to negotiation for wages that workers have.  That is the only reason why the labor exists there, and that is the margin that American and first-world markets profit from where they can't squeeze it out of their own native labor force.  The second you organize them and pay them what they deserve and make it safe for them under some form of universal standard along the lines of what exists in the US or the UK, the foreign outsourcing of labor leaves immediately.     In short:  enjoy your sub-proletarian wages, lack of a safety, lack of any job security, lack of benefits of any kind... and thank god everyday that that's the situation, otherwise you'd really be suffering.

The quote they're using is criticizing fascism for doing things that AnCaps love doing.  Another irony is they're quoting Henry A. Wallace, thinking that he would support them, when in reality he was removed as FDR's Vice President because he was too far left for most people, and he had strong support of many socialists and communists in America, despite not being one himself (openly, anyway), when he ran on The Progressive ticket on 1948.

socialism,3e2o49,janglekey,4,Tue Jul 21 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"In any conceivable society, we have to imagine people as still having goals and dreams, striving towards them as best they can. When you ask people that experienced extraordinary change, they often say that accompanying the sense of achievement is a sense of emptiness. As if, the struggle was an integral part, or became an integral part, of their self.  More generally, struggle, and the meaning of life, will always be components of the human condition. Consider this short description of Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus:   In the essay, Camus introduces his philosophy of the absurd: man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values. Does the realization of the absurd require suicide? Camus answers: ""No. It requires revolt."" He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. The final chapter compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again. The essay concludes, ""The struggle itself [...] is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.""   So one could argue that we're all Sisyphus, and that ultimately, we should push the boulder up the hill in as playful and enjoyable a manner as we can, allow life to be its own meaning, and allow ourselves enjoyment, even in the face of hardship and as of yet unrealized goals."

Which are, of course, the very things that the capitalist machine feeds off of and also demands of its adherents.  That said, I don't know how those features of the human experience can be defeated in a lifetime, or fought against... because while you can show people the effects of capitalism, it's much more nebulous to show them the effects and results of the tendency every human being has to be only concerned with their own self-interest.   The other truth is, I've seen just as much bald selfishness and greed among people who are very leftwing... enough to know that it's not a feature that can be drawn among political lines.

socialism,3e19zd,OPscat,-22,Tue Jul 21 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"Well thanks for asking m8 most people just yell/laugh/ban  The ideal state would be one where all classes are equally represented in a state that serves all of their interests. For example, the House of syndicates under Mussolini helped to serve this by bringing labor and union representatives to the table together, and had the state arbitrate using negotiators without a stake in it (There are possible problems here, but there can be personal biases in any system)  Essentially, what I want is class union under the state, rather than class conflict. Marxism wanted dictatorship of the proletariat, capitalism leads to dictatorship of the merchants, my Ideal system would have equality of the classes, with each being equally represented in the state, similar to the prussian constitution or the estates general (and yes, I am aware there are SEVERE flaws there. However, I'm just using it as an example for one aspect of the system)  Oh and of course, one nation for one ethnicity so as to reduce ethnic conflict and to preserve indigenous cultures."

Ideally by promoting more economic ties such as trade and diplomatic supranational organizations such as the UN. Furthermore, this isn't 1914, and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction and treaty organizations prevents real large scale wars.   The system you're describing is still capitalism, because you preserve the capitalist class.   There is an element of capitalism and an element of socialism. That's why, I believe, it is the best, it takes the best elements of both.   And you're saying that there should be class unity instead of class conflict, but is that possible when there are some obvious contradictory goals for the proletariat and the bourgeoisie?   Well, yes, I do. and the reason for that is that I believe that all the classes, proles and bourgeoise can be subverted to the state, such that they do what is required of them in order to keep a healthy and functioning nation, and the state gives back to them their birthrights as citizens of the nation, and the rewards for their labors. The state obviously would have more incentive to put forth pensions and healthcare than just employers, and keeping it as an active BUT SEPARATE force is likely the solution that merges economic equality with Private sector driven economic growth the best.  And yes, I am aware that this is another form of subservience, by which the proles are liberated from the capitalists but are made servants of the state. However, all forms of society require a rigid hierarchy, and thus, servitude, in order to function."

""If you please, in what way is the butcher any worse than the dealer who drove us hither with his cudgel?"" replied the bulls, who had received their political education in Manuilsky's institute. [The Comintern.]  ""But we shall be able to attend to the dealer as well afterwards!""  ""Nothing doing,"" replied the bulls firm in their principles, to the counselor.

It's very much possible to be aware of their sacrifice and honour them without watching their mutilated bodies and listen to the screams of the wounded and dying.   It might be reality but it is not necessary in the slightest. If I were killed in a terrorist attack (and I've been within a few metres of a live IED) I would not want people ""honouring"" me by watching it."

socialism,3dxkwt,AnonSocialist,14,Mon Jul 20 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"They aren't fascists. Fascism is a specific term that covers a type of middle class reaction. Don't misuse terms.   The social composition of Fascist movements have historically been small capitalists, low-level bureaucrats of all stripes (see petty bourgeoeis), with great success in rural areas, especially among farmers, peasants, and in the city, slum workers. Meanwhile, fascist leadership invariably comes to power through the sponsorship and funding of massive capitalists, without needing a revolution. These capitalists along with the top-tier leaders they create become fascism's ruling aristocracy. Fascism championed corporate economics, which operated on an anarcho-syndicalist model in reverse: associations of bosses in particular industries determine working conditions, prices, etc. In this form of corporatism, bosses dictate everything from working hours to minimum wages, without goverment interference. The fascist corporate model differs from the more moderate corporatist model by eradicating all forms of regulatory control that protect workers (so-called ""consumers""), the environment, price fixing, insider trading, and destroying all independent workers' organisations. In fascism, the corporate parliament either replaces the representative bodies of government or reduces them to a sham and the state freely intervenes in the activity of companies, either by bestowing favouritism, or handing them over to the control of rivals.   https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/f/a.htm#fascism  Does this sound like ISIS? They aren't fascists."
socialism,3dxkwt,Post-NapoleonicMan,7,Mon Jul 20 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"I think there are certainly parallels to be made between the two movements. They merge elements of the middle, or professional, class with lumpenproletariat; there was a leaked German report concluding German ISIS recruits were mostly petty criminals who had served time for small crimes at some point. A British study reported that the British recruits were well educated and professionals, so ISIS gets German lumpenproletariat and British professionals. Of course an in depth materialist analysis is difficult, due to the scarcity of information; but we can make some surface comparisons (not ideal for a Marxist analysis, but the following similarities I find compelling - and no doubt the surface gives clues as to the nature of the base), taken from an article by Christopher Hitchens (say what you will of the author, the analysis I find makes a strong case) it was written in reference to al-Qaeda, but is relevant to ISIS:   The most obvious points of comparison would be these: Both movements are based on a cult of murderous violence that exalts death and destruction and despises the life of the mind. (""Death to the intellect! Long live death!"" as Gen. Francisco Franco's sidekick Gonzalo Queipo de Llano so pithily phrased it.) Both are hostile to modernity (except when it comes to the pursuit of weapons), and both are bitterly nostalgic for past empires and lost glories. Both are obsessed with real and imagined ""humiliations"" and thirsty for revenge. Both are chronically infected with the toxin of anti-Jewish paranoia (interestingly, also, with its milder cousin, anti-Freemason paranoia). Both are inclined to leader worship and to the exclusive stress on the power of one great book. Both have a strong commitment to sexual repression—especially to the repression of any sexual ""deviance""—and to its counterparts the subordination of the female and contempt for the feminine. Both despise art and literature as symptoms of degeneracy and decadence; both burn books and destroy museums and treasures."

socialism,3dxkwt,rocktheprovince,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:03 2015 UTC,This comes up from time to time but can you point to an explanation of why the lumpen are necessarily lost to class consciousness?
socialism,3dxkwt,AnonSocialist,5,Mon Jul 20 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"The lumpen are not a homogeneous group, they range in motivation from criminals, to agents of the capitalist state (soldiers, police, etc), to those who think that somehow they are the chose exception (libertarians) and finally those who never find a steady place in the working class. They are lost to class consciousness because they never see themselves as part of the working class. Without understanding one's relationship to the means of production, one can never truly become class conscious. Can individuals move from/to lumpen status? Sure. Dialectially there is always flux, but, there will always be a section of the working class that will be lumpen.   I hope that makes sense, I wrote it from my phone."
socialism,3dxkwt,rocktheprovince,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"Feel free to answer when you get to a computer if you'd like;   You're basically saying that their lumpen-status is dependent on their class-consciousness rather than their relation to the means of production? So you could have a criminal who is class conscious but has never worked, and they would be more 'proletarian' than a libertarian worker who rejects class-consciousness or even a cop who embraces it? (contradictory as this theoretical cop might be)  I'm just trying to be clear, it's not something I know much about."
socialism,3dxkwt,AnonSocialist,6,Mon Jul 20 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"criminal who is class conscious   Criminality within a bourgeois system doesn't mean much. If I steal to feed the poor I am a criminal. If I download music without paying for it, I am a criminal, if I stop a cop from beating a person of color, I am a criminal. So yes, a criminal can easily be more class conscious and make a better revolutionary than lets say a bow-tie wearing libertarian working at walmart. A cop who is class conscious who is still a cop isn't class conscious (feels like a paradox haha)."
socialism,3dxkwt,rocktheprovince,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:52 2015 UTC,I guess I kind of trailed off in my question then. But when you call someone 'lumpen' this has more to do with them as individuals rather than their relationship to the means of production?

A disoriented working class can be lead to struggle for the most reactionary of programs, such as fascism, but that doesn't mean that the program is fascism, nor does it mean that the people who are sympathetic to it are lumpen. ISIL is the expression of a population that has been under constant assault by imperialism and anti-communist actions for the last 40 years.

In response to the last year of protests against police terrorism, he has had little to say besides condemning the high rate of Black unemployment.

He has consistently voted to restrict visas for skilled workers -- like the L-1 Nonimmigrant Reform Act, which he himself cosponsored, arguing that it was wrong for corporations to import workers when they are laying off U.S. employees. He voted for the Goodlatte Amendment to eliminate the visa lottery that distributes 55,000 visas a year to foreign workers on a random basis.

He had a great quote about the future of economic change. Roughly paraphrasing, he said ""If you were a feudalist in 1660, you would have thought capitalism had been completely crushed. The Bohemian Revolt had been crushed by the Thirty Year's War. The city states of Northern Italy were under the heel of the French and the Austrians, and the most powerful nation on Earth, England, was an absolute monarchy. By 1760, it was obvious to everyone that capitalism had won."""

socialism,3e0lbw,ajrhug,12,Tue Jul 21 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"Ideologically but one could not argue that workers controlled the means of production in the USSR in any period but the early revolutionary one. That is, while the government espoused the ideology of attaining socialism and it might be true that they themselves believed themselves to have attained it, the material conditions (which are the only thing that should matter in a Marxist reading of history) were not socialist.  The productive forces, while highly developed by the time Khruschyov came around, were not enough to break from the capitalist mode of production and attain socialism. Further the lack of world socialist revolution and thus socialist communities in those states sufficiently advanced to produce socialist states stifled the ability for the USSR to attain socialism.   So while I personally believe that the USSR was indeed Socialist, that is they espoused the ideology of Socialism, they weren't socialist, have an economy run by the workers themselves and in alignment with the principle ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need."""
socialism,3e0lbw,vidurnaktis,4,Tue Jul 21 02:06:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, Lenin was just listening to bourgeois propaganda when he declared the system to be state capitalist in 1921.  Socialism was dismantled quite soon after the October revolution."
socialism,3e0lbw,Cttam,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is a huge problem with what people conceive Socialism to be.  It's not a simple set of conditions. It's a process. Technically speaking the USSR never achieved a fully Socialist of society. It was, as you said, a sort of statist system, as Trotsky would put it.   But just because Socialism was not materially achieved does not mean it was not Socialist. This sounds contradictory but it isn't. Socialism is a process, it's a social movement. The odds of any kind of revolution leading to actual, material Socialism within the first few years is extremely slim. But if it's marching towards Socialism, if it's on that road, and society is genuinely gearing itself towards that, then yes it's fair and right to call it Socialist instead of deriding it as simply one thing or the other.   So, if you're going for this really facile idea that Socialism is X set of conditions and we must tick all the boxes, then the Soviet Union was never Socialist at any stage of its conception.   In fact we've never had a Socialist territory or state ever, including all the Libertarian and Anarchist ""pet"" territories that people like to point to as ""real Socialism"".   This is why there are a large section of Marxists who view Stalin's rise as an end to Socialism in the USSR. Not because there was some fantastical shift in productive relations - there wasn't - but because it stopped marching on that road. You saw in the early years of the Stalin regime a reification of various things - to give one example, the family - and coupled with a gradual erosion of democratic institutions(In fairness, still significantly more democratic than its bourgeois counterparts at the time) indicated a shift away from the road to a fully Socialist society.  To quote Malatesta;    Therefore, the subject is not whether we accomplish Anarchism today, tomorrow, or within ten centuries, but that we walk towards Anarchism today, tomorrow, and always."
socialism,3e0lbw,PoblachtObrithe,0,Tue Jul 21 07:42:32 2015 UTC,"Reformist democratic socialists would say the same thing - that social democratic governments are socialist because they are 'on the path to socialism'. I'm not 'deriding' anything by calling them state-capitalist or social-democratic. These are accurate descriptions that are not inherently 'derisive', though I would of course have my own feeling on respective states/revolutions that we could talk about.  Socialism was growing and spreading throughout Russia during the initial revolutionary period, most substantially through 1917. This was actively reversed once the Bolsheviks took power. So it's actually not even accurate to say they were 'on the path to socialism' as the organs of workers control were eroded and dismantled following the October Revolution.  If you want to believe Lenin, Trotsky and the rest of that bunch did ultimately plan to return to building a genuinely socialist society, that's up to you and an entirely separate discussion. It doesn't change that the USSR was not socialist.  Your claim that the anarchist 'pet' territories (I assume the Spanish Revolution is what comes to mind) were not socialist is just rubbish. I'm going to need some significant evidence to show me otherwise.  Your idea that socialism is a process and not a set of conditions is just silly (not that we can't say 'the process' of actively achieving those conditions is socialist - which is very different to your example of socialism being vaguely promised at some point in the future). Socialism at it's core is about workers controlling production. If you want your own definition so you can feel better about the Russian Revolution, that is - again - up to you."

How is the government of Venezuela's plan to 'continue the revolution' and establish a socialist system any different to Lenin's 'strategic retreat' from socialism in order to 'save the revolution', in the sense that neither are based on a socialist economy?. I'm not saying either is true or false, likely or unlikely - I'm simply saying these are both state-capitalist societies with different degrees of state control over the economy, in terms of planning and management as well as (in a case like Venezuela) the lingering existence of private enterprise.  Maybe, had Trotsky taken power, or the German revolution had gone better, the USSR would have returned to establishing a socialist society - though I personally have my doubts considering workers control was dismantled by the Bolsheviks - but this does not change that they were not socialist (or on a genuine 'path to socialism'., by Lenin's own admission, as early as 1921 (and I would argue much earlier).   Was there an elimination of generalised want? All needs catered for? A total elimination of class society and counter-revolutionary forces? No. Of course not.    You can have this invented definition of socialism if you like (the 'classless' part is really the only thing relevant), but it's not what has long been understood as the core of socialism - workers control.  The situation was obviously different depending on the region of the country, but significant parts of Spain - most notably Catalonia and Aragon - were genuinely revolutionary, with the workers taking control of their communities. Again, I'll need some actual evidence if you have some information up your sleeve disproving this.   You can tell that to all the main theorists of Socialism, both Marxist and Anarchist.   Not sure if you saw the edited version of my post, but hopefully it clarifies what I meant by this. Obviously the 'process' of transitioning to socialism by spreading workers control should be referred to as 'socialism'. State capitalist societies offering promises of a future transition should not."

One should especially resist the temptation of Grexit as a great heroic act of rejecting further humiliations and stepping outside - into what? What new positive order are we stepping into? The Grexit option appears as the “real-impossible”, as something that would lead to an immediate social disintegration. Krugman writes: “Tsipras apparently allowed himself to be convinced, some time ago, that euro exit was completely impossible. It appears that Syriza didn’t even do any contingency planning for a parallel currency (I hope to find out that this is wrong). This left him in a hopeless bargaining position.”  Krugman’s point is that Grexit is also an “impossible-real” which can happen with unpredictable consequences and which, as such, can be risked. “All the wise heads saying that Grexit is impossible, that it would lead to a complete implosion, don’t know what they are talking about. When I say that, I don’t mean that they’re necessarily wrong — I believe they are, but anyone who is confident about anything here is deluding himself. What I mean instead is that nobody has any experience with what we’re looking at.”  While in principle this is true, there are nonetheless too many indications that a sudden Grexit now would lead to utter economic and social catastrophe. Syriza economic strategists are well aware that such a gesture would cause an immediate further fall of the standard of living for an additional (minimum) 30 per cent, bringing misery to a new unbearable level, with the threat of popular unrest and even military dictatorship. The prospect of such heroic acts is thus a temptation to be resisted.   So he criticizes Krugman for putting to much faith in the positive possibilities of a Grexit by saying ""well we don't really know that it would be good"" and then opposes the idea of a self Grexit because ""it would definitely be bad.""  His analysis isn't too bad in many places, but as usual he uses it to come to strange conclusions that aren't really all that helpful.  Edit: I think this bit was pretty funny   In the guise of Syriza “contradictions”, the EU establishment is merely getting back its own message in its true form. And this is what Syriza should be doing now. With a ruthless pragmatism and cold calculation, it should exploit the tiniest cracks in the opponent’s armour. It should use all those who resist the predominant EU politics, from British conservatives to Ukip in the UK. It should shamelessly flirt with Russia and China, playing with the idea of giving an island to Russia as its Mediterranean military base, just to scare the shit out of Nato strategists. To paraphrase Dostoyevsky, now that the EU God has failed, everything is permitted."

Or is it that the ultimate motivation for the brutal extortionist pressure on Greece is not purely economic (since it is obviously irrational in economic terms) but politico-ideological – or, as Paul Krugman put it in the New York Times, ""substantive surrender isn’t enough for Germany, which wants regime change and total humiliation — and there’s a substantial faction that just wants to push Greece out, and would more or less welcome a failed state as a caution for the rest.” One should always bear in mind what a horror Syriza is for the European establishment – a Conservative Polish member of the European parliament even directly appealed to the Greek army to make a coup d’etat in order to save the country.   This would maybe make sense if the EU rapidly changed course after Syriza won.. But they have been amazing consistent in their demands on Greece."

They provided genuine positive change for the working class. Palme was clear in support for oppressed people all around the world, from apartheid South Africa to Palestine. They may have been reformists and would have never achieved socialism but at least they had aspirations.   I am especially interested in people's opinions on the ""Employee Funds/Löntagarfonder""   Not knowledgeable enough to formulate any real arguments.

Yes, and no. Policy-wise - yes, they're close. Ideologically - absolutely not. There's a clear distinction between social democracy (Social Democrats under Olof Palme) and Socialism (Left Party since they dropped communism). There's still the desire of societal overthrow within the Left, in favour of a classless, stateless and democratic society, which was never present in the Social Democratic Party. The Left Party is merely the parliamentary wing of this movement.   I'd recommend you to read up on LO   They're not much better than the Social Democrats nowadays. It's undemocratically governed and leans heavily on liberalism, not even expelling outright fascists, racist LGBTIAQ-phobes, etc. LO is a self-serving career-machine, whose leaders and foremost figures more often than not become lobbyists and outright bourgeois.

I wish  that was the case and hope that it can be one day, but today the Left Party is quite non-radical in my opinion. For example several members who've expressed ""radical"" views have been expelled, so it's not a very including party. Atleast not if you have aspirations on moving up in the party or moving it towards more ""radical"" ideas. The current Left Party leader Sjöstedt and Palme seem more a like to me than any other current and historical party leaders. And the differences I can see between the two parties are small, atleast when it comes to what is actually being done instead of just written in their party platform.   They're not much better than the Social Democrats nowadays.   Absolutely agree!

I mean the last big victory for the Social democratic left-wing was when they were going to decide over profits in welfare. And they didn't even get through a complete ban since the party top was against it, just a cap (that wasnt decided AFAIK). The fact that something like that even has to be fought over within the party and the outcome of it tells a lot. And not to mention when Juholt got elected party leader of the Social Democrats (probably the most left-wing since Palme and had lots of support among the members). The party top, including LO, almost immediatly started backstabbing him.  I have all respect for the left-wing members of the Social democratic party, but today I don't think that the party deserves their devotion and time. Especially not people who actually sees themselves as socialists.

When the value of human labour is zero or close to it (and while of course it's abysmally low at the moment, and always has been, it's not quite there yet) then the common human will not even have his or her labour to offer, and then... well, we'd better have tackled this problem by then."

The formula is recognizing a problem people are facing, introduce comedy, and then finally reassure that everything will be alright, there is no need to go beyond liberalism.  The show by design avoids systemic arguments because that would actually reveal something about Capitalism Colonialism and all the rest.

The definition for efficiency is the state or quality of being efficient, or able to accomplish something with the least waste of time and effort. Contrary to popular belief, this is not the case.   Even looking within our agriculture policy in this country, it is a huge amount of waste. From the time food is harvested to the time it reaches the shelves of a supermarket, there's so much misuse of energy and resources.

socialism,3dxkpo,ParisPC07,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:14:20 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI from a Food Scientist on a point he mentioned. Manufacturers want longer expiration dates, not shorter ones.   Manufacturers want products to be good longer because it increases profit and makes the product easier to sell.   There are a couple of reasons behind this.  1) Unsold product generates zero profit. This seems pretty straightforward. Product can be unsold for a variety of reasons, theft, damage, lost, etc, but for food the biggest cause of unsold product is product that is past its expiration date. Longer shelf-life reduces that chances of a product being discarded unsold, so it's more desirable for whoever has to sell the product. Okay, so why do manufacturers care? They aren't selling the product to consumers right?  2) Manufacturers are often retailers. An oddity of the food industry is that companies pay for stores to have their products. For there to be Fritos in Wal-Mart, Frito-Lay has to buy/rent shelf-space for their product. They then claim a percentage of the sale-price. Essentially, they are selling on commission. Product didn't sell, Frito-Lay is the one who has to soak up the loss. But what about when manufacturers aren't retailers?  3) Retailers don't buy products with short shelf-life. Alright, let's say we're not dealing with a corporate giant like Wal-Mart that can demand companies sell on commission. Frito-Lay is selling Fritos to a wholesaler that supplies independent gas stations. Frito-Lay gets their money once the deal is made, why do they care if it's thrown away or not? Because the retailer stills has to deal with reason #1. Unsold product generates no profit. If you know of two similar products, one with longer shelf-life and one with shorter, you will buy the one that lasts longer for your store as it maximizes the chances you will recoup your investment. Shorter shelf-life means having a harder time convincing other businesses to buy your product. It makes the investment riskier.  Going along with this, businesses will often outsource creation of new products to specialist companies/labs. When doing so, a minimum shelf-life is a standard requirement for the reasons above. If your product doesn't meet their requirements, they won't accept it. The result of this, and the influence of marketing and admins who are clueless as to how reality works, is I've dealt with companies who have demanded organic, preservative free potato salad with a six-week shelf-life. I'm sorry, but you fail at science.  4) Consumers don't like short-shelf life. Whether it's because they think the product is fresher, 'Oh, the expiration date is two-weeks further away than the one right next to it. It must be fresher!' or because they don't want food to go bad. 'This milk expires Friday and I'm not sure I'll use it up in time, better go with one that's good until next Thursday.' Consumers preferentially buy products with longer expiration dates.  So, whether it's manufacturers, retailers, or consumers, nobody wants a short-shelf life.  I hope you found this interesting."

How disappointed they would be."
socialism,3dy4aj,RighteousPistachio,21,Mon Jul 20 14:11:47 2015 UTC,"All Communist tendencies are socialist, not all socialist tendencies are communist. When speaking of communism one is generally referring to some interpretation of Marx' writings. Most common would be Marxism-Leninism, which is acheiving a communist society (stateless, moneyless, classless and without private property) through the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and a Vanguard party of the foremost among ideologues and politicians. Then centralisation, nationalization and so on (details are much better described in actual communist literature, but that isn't what you are asking for).  Socialism is a much broader term, also with the long-term goals of statelessnes, classlessnes and introduction of common ownership over the means of production. When one says ""communism"" the meaning is quite clear. When one says ""socialism"", one could be speaking of anarchism, communism, libertarian socialism, democratic socialism, etc.   Is there personal property in socialism?   Almost no socialist, communist or anarchist advocates abolishing personal property (your shirt, for example, is personal property). Private property is abolished in all (legitimate) forms of socialism, however.   Also, how can I learn more about socialism? Any good reading material? Thank you!   What you need to understand is that socialism isn't a uniform ideology. You can however read about all sorts of tendencies - here are a few basic examples:  On Anarcho-Communism, Peter Kropotkin's ""The conquest of bread"" is brilliant.  On Marxism, I'd recommend the Manifesto (obviously) and for a more nuanced view of Marx (perhaps when you are more fully learned), ""The civil war in France"" is fascinating since Marx completely re-evaluates his view on the state.  ""The state and the revolution"" is one I heavily disagree with but is nonetheless important to understanding Leninism.  For a critique of Stalinism, I'd suggest ""The Revolution Betrayed"" by Trotsky.  Anything by Emma Goldman is wonderful insight into Anarchism/Anarcho-Feminism.  Further there is Bookchin, Einstein['s ""Why Socialism?], Oscar Wilde['s The soul of man under socialism], Engels, Noam Chomsky and many more. I'm sure other comrades will give good advice.  EDIT: spelling."

Baker, to my knowledge, was more of an activist than an author but she was a fascinating woman. She's got a quote that I think is arguably one of the best out there and I came across it in an Activism and Social Theory course I took many years ago: ""Strong people don't need strong leaders."""

socialism,3dy4aj,Dianthuses,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters. Most of the people you mentioned happen to be men and white because they have contributed the most to socialist literature.  It isn't like you are claiming that white males are inherently superior. It is just a fact of history the most famous and influential authors have tended to be white and male. They just happen to be white and male because of the way education and society worked (especially pre-1900s authors).   The only person who really stood out as missing to me was Rosa Luxemburg. Not because 'omg we must have diversity for the sake of it' but because she is famous, influential and a brilliant thinker i.e. her own merits.   Now the people you mention in your 'extra diversity' lits are all great (the ones I've read anyway) but I wouldn't count any of them as ""Socialism 101"", not because they aren't white or male but because they don't have as many merits as some other writers.  After all it isn't like gender or race are the core issues talked abotu (or identified as problems) by the majority of socialist literature. So the gender and race of the writer aren't super important.   Diversity should be embraced, not forced for the sake of it. I mean of course people like Marx, Engels, Goldman, Luxemburg, Trotsky, Chomsky, Kropotkin and so on are going to be mentioned over Angela Davis. That isn't sexist or racist, it is just priotising sensibly."

socialism,3dy4aj,Illin_Spree,4,Mon Jul 20 22:24:53 2015 UTC,"And on what you said about private property, where would people live?   Private property is ownership of property according to a title granted by the state, giving the owner the right to exclude others from that property.  Most socialists are opposed to ""absentee property ownership"", which is owning property that you aren't directly using in order to generate income by charging rents.  This ""rent-seeking behavior"" is considered a type of usury, similar to banks charging interest on loans.  Socialists have diverse views on how housing and land management would work.  I personally favor a ""georgist"" model where the the local government is in charge of property allocation. In this case, there would be rents for the more expensive/luxurious properties within a given geographical area, while the cheapest properties would be free or almost free.  Such a society would likely invest in low-cost housing units for poor and homeless people and would provide basic water and electric.  The monies generated via rent would go into public services, parks and recreation, education and healthcare, infrastructure, building new housing, and whatever else the community would want to spend it on.  Or, in anarchism, it is based on occupation and use, which means that each person has the right the occupy a piece of property as long as it's not being used, or as long as there aren't other people with no land who need a piece of the land you are using."

They can produce all they want, but their production won't turn into wealth without an effective consumer class to enslave and abuse. Making the entirety of the proletariat destitute will, inevitably, cause the downfall of the capitalists as well.  That said, I think there is both a potential for the 'robotic revolution' to not cause as much job loss as everyone expects and, if not that, a new enemy for the left to fight against than the traditional model of capitalist organization will arise. Probably some form of state paternalism, giving the state complete control over the material well-being of each individual. Socialism, sadly, will not construct itself."

But it means up giving up some national sovereignty, and if there's an international push for neoliberalism (like currently), that's not something you want.  Regardless, the EU has a lot of technocratic elements. Which means, a lot of changes aren't really ideology-based, but purely on what would function best given the circumstances. Which is why you get such a weird mix of neoliberalism and pro-consumer laws.  The EU is very popular in new member states, so I guess they're doing something right, but they are centrist in every respect."

Everyone is a ""critic of Israel"" (not of the politics of the governments of the israeli state, but of ""Israel""!), but no one seems to be a ""critic of Jordan"" or a ""critic of Libanon"", although the governments of these countries have constantly, over decades (!!) mistreated the Palestinians living there, forcing them into ghettos, giving them no perspective and keeping them in abject poverty.   Not to mention that the current situation for Palenstinians and israeli arabs seems for some reason be much more important to members of this sub than the brutal, partly genocidal oppression of the christian minority in Darfur (Sudan) or the oppression of women around the world, and especially in fundamentalist arab states, or many other fields of oppression, mass murder and war all around the planet.

We should always stay on alert; even us 'enlightened ones' aren't immune to bigotry.  Still, in this thread at least, I haven't seen anyone denying that antiemitism exists and is a problem, I haven't seen anyone downplaying it, I haven't seen anyone suggest we should expel Jews from Israel. I have not seen any invocation of blood libel, nor any of dog whistles for Jew-hate.  I should probably explain myself here for clarity. I'm the grandson of a Jew who moved here from Palestine, and I take a lot of pride in my heritage. I am very alert to antisemitism, often too much so, and that can create friction with comrades.  I'm in contact with a lot of Palestinians. They are generally kind and the idea of living together as brothers with Jews is popular. They tend to support either a confederal setup between Israel and Palestine that would allow any Jew or Arab to live freely and equally anywhere between the river and the sea. Others think a federal state across the whole of Palestine and Israel is a good idea. Personally I don't mind which we get; a worker's state in a socialist confederation of the middle east is definitely my favourite option as an endpoint, of course.   But for now, as @PoblachtObrithe points out (and this comrade has shown himself to have a great handle on middle eastern issues, I have found) Israel is problematic. And it's not unique in that. Still, whenever the topic comes up, there's nothing wrong in us being vocal about our desires to see a just peace and settlement that offers both Jew and Arab the chance to live in harmony and to pursue their cultural interests. Let's keep our eyes peeled for any form of racism, be it Islamophobia, Antisemitism, or any other, and tackle it swiftly.  We have great goals. We have a long way to go, but our dream shall never die. I know that there will come a day when a Jew and an Arab may work hand-in-hand to build socialism not only in the middle east but across the whole world. Let's look towards that future and fight for it."

And then, there is also the issue of how to elect far-left candidates in the first, and I would argue that the only way that many far-left candidates can be elected is if there is already a mass, extra-parliamentary movement--which again, brings us back to the point that focusing purely on electoral politics and running for office is a mistake."

socialism,3dw8oe,Illin_Spree,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"If you look into the history of the SPA, you'll find that these early socialists built up lots of socialist mutual aid organizations and socialist clubs (anarchists and the IWW were doing similar stuff, which also built up class consciousness).  In places like Texas and Oklahoma, they would hold socialist encampments (similar to old-school revival meetings) out in the countryside where people would trade products and hear the socialist gospel from speakers and musicians.    The other part of what arjun is getting at is the importance of building up class consciousness via unions and other workplace-based institutions.  So we need mutual aid groups, unions, propaganda societies, independent newspapers (there were tons of them in the SPA era, as well as a few national newspapers) and we need social groups such as Philly Socialists.  The right kind of socialist electoral movement would concentrate on building up class consciousness via these orgs up and not merely on electoral politics.  I think Debs was helpful in this respect via his relentless speaking tours--he would go all over the country to speak and this would bring people together and expose them to various socialist-oriented groups.     Unfortunately all the progress they made was to a large extent reversed by the reactionary results of WWI and the first Red Scare.  Nowadays we don't have this kind of working-class organization.  Even though Sanders is drawing huge crowds, right now it's all rhetoric.  It hasn't gotten to the point of building up organizations that might challenge TPTB or at least challenge people to change their lives (if he did that, he'd catch flak from Democrats)...it's just about how people are going to vote in the primaries.  The Greens, similarly, have not succeeded in building up the kind of orgs we need.  We don't have a movement that challenges people to make a commitment, educate themselves, or change their lives.   The Black Panthers were arguably the last major socialist group in the USA to engage in the sort of organizing necessary to challenge the system, and for that they faced major repression from TPTB."

The current (PSUV) President was barely elected in 2013 to succeed Chavez, and his approval is in the dumpster. The Party is currently polling anywhere from 20-33 points behind the liberal opposition and the parliamentary election is in December.

If those countries, like the United States or some of the major European powers, for instance, came to become socialist, it would be difficult for others to challenge them, impose sanctions, etc.  That's why I want to focus on politics in first world countries. Even though I know there are many other countries in which the conditions are much more ripe for a revolution, because the people there want it more, those countries would face a situation like Cuba, economic and political isolation, or Nicaragua, military intervention and government upheaval, because the governments of first world nations won't let it happen.

No, revolution, the substitution of one social system for another, has always been a struggle, a painful and a cruel struggle, a life-and-death struggle. And every time the people of the new world came into power they had to defend themselves against the attempts of the old world to restore the old power by force; these people of the new world always had to be on the alert, always had to be ready to repel the attacks of the old world upon the new system.   Regardless of whether or not we pursued electoral politics to achieve our goals, the bourgeoisie will always attempt to seize power back for themselves if they feel threatened enough. They will use any means possible to suppress socialism if it becomes large enough, and would even try to infiltrate the socialist parties themselves to set them up for failure.

One or two in congress won't change the world, sure, but would it make no difference?   of course it would make no difference. living in a country with actual left-wing opposition, it changes nothing on the politics of the gouverment or anything else. all it does gives those people some cushy seats in a parliament and a nice pay. wich makes it all the more interesting for careerists to go into that party.   And what if we managed to elect more than just one or two? What if we made socialism a significant force in our political field, one that even gained a majority of seats in the House and Senate? Socialist governors? A socialist president?   happend all before in other parts of the world, never changed a thing.   but if we elected representatives who passed legislation that transformed our entire economy, legislation that would abolish poverty wages, eliminate homelessness and unemployment, strengthen unions, nationalize major industries in the country like communication, transportation and production, and set us on the road to a real socialist society, would these things not be revolutionary? Would that huge change, albeit through electoral politics, not be a revolution of our country and the way it works?   no! what you dont understand is that the bourgeois state, was created by the bourgeoisie to protect their interests, their freedom. you cant take over it and ""make socialism"" through it. the bourgeois state has to be smashed if socialism is ever to become a real thing. also once elected, those socialists will out of a sudden have the interests of the state in mind wich they now rule over wich more often than not colide with the interests of the working class (best example spd weimar republic).  also on a more general note why electoral politics are a problem. it does tie the workers to the bourgeois system. it sows illusions that things can get better if we just wait and vote for the right people who wont screw us over(this time). it creates faith into ""leaders"" and benevolent partys instead of selfactivity of the working class."
socialism,3dw8oe,UpholderOfThoughts,4,Mon Jul 20 09:23:23 2015 UTC,"hear many people say ""Bourgeois democracy is broken, we need a revolution,"" and I understand your frustration, but if we elected representatives who passed legislation that transformed our entire economy, legislation that would abolish poverty wages, eliminate homelessness and unemployment, strengthen unions, nationalize major industries in the country like communication, transportation and production, and set us on the road to a real socialist society, would these things not be revolutionary? Would that huge change, albeit through electoral politics, not be a revolution of our country and the way it works?   The point is that you can't  make those kinds of changes through parliamentary means within capitalism, since all of these things are things capitalism is dependent on due to its internal contradictions. Your question is therefore from the get go deeply flawed since you've misunderstood the critique of parliamentarism and reformism. You should read either some Lenin or Luxemburg (if you want to grasp some of the real basics) or some Negri (especially his texts from the 70s where he deals a lot with the state).  To quote Engels (which was then quoted by Lenin, Luxemburg and Negri):   The state is, therefore, by no means a power forced on society from without; just as little is it 'the reality of the ethical idea', 'the image and reality of reason', as Hegel maintains. Rather, it is a product of society at a certain stage of development; it is the admission that this society has become entangled in an insoluble contradiction with itself, that it has split into irreconcilable antagonisms which it is powerless to dispel. But in order that these antagonisms, these classes with conflicting economic interests, might not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, it became necessary to have a power, seemingly standing above society, that would alleviate the conflict and keep it within the bounds of 'order'; and this power, arisen out of society but placing itself above it, and alienating itself more and more from it, is the state.   What Engels misses (as did all of the second internationale, which is where all misconceptions of what the state and parliamentarism is comes from) is that the state is not a mediator standing above class struggles (although it through its fetishistic character seems that way) - it is a tool used within class struggle. And not a tool which can be harnessed by the working class, but necessarily a tool specifically made for the capitalist class.  So vote all you want - I do. But it will never abolish capital or anything close to it, it will only work as a dialectical counterpart to actual militant and revolutionary tactics (as is proven by Lenin, Luxemburg and Negri)."

Now the SP President is the most unpopular in history.  Syriza in Greece ran on a reformist, anti-austerity mandate. They completely failed to negotiate their way out of the inevitable austerity, and are now implementing it.  Salvador Allende attempted to reform Chile. He was overthrown by an imperialist coup and murdered.  The most far-reaching reforms in British history were achieved by Labour after WW2. Their reforms didn't abolish capitalism, so they suffered the same economic crises as the rest of the world. Now their reforms have been almost entirely dismantled. Reform then counter-reform.  It just doesn't work. All reformism ends in failure or betrayal. You simply must destroy the bourgeois state apparatus, put power in the hands of the masses and consciously move towards the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Electoralism only serves revolution by showing the people how useless cooperation with the bourgeois really is, that has been the pattern in almost all revolutions: Expectation of change ----> No change -----> revolution.   Thirdly, nationalizing is all they will accomplish, which does little to improve the situation, state capitalism is surely better for the workers than capitalism-capitalism, but it does not solve any problems, and is still in direct contradiction with the abolishment of commodity production for the accumulation of capital.  Lastly, no it would not be a revolution. A revolution is when one class dethrones the current ruling class. If the bourgeois still control the media and the means of production they are the ruling class and they will eventually roll back any reforms we get through, socialism isn't about the occasional weak reform that just lowers the wages in the phillipines to subsidize our welfare systems and cheap stuff. It is about solidarity with all humans around the world and the victory of humanity, not the temporary truce which will no doubt be broken."

I don't actually have a very good answer specifically for pirating.  When it comes to these kinds of things though, I default to the idea that, if you can't afford it, take it, whereas if you can afford it you should probably chip in.   Obviously I don't think there's a moral obligation to not steal from oppressors, but maintaining the status quo by paying for these products and services probably is a good way to ensure that these kinds of products and services continue to be produced - it's a good way to make sure that we'll still get new music and movies, since if they're not seriously profitable they won't be made.  It also could mean that corporations aren't as likely to go really hard on pirates, so people who actually can't afford these things might be less likely to find themselves in legal strife (which they'd find even more difficult to afford). This is more of a tenuous point but I think there's something to be said for it: it does appear that the fewer pirates there are, the happier big studios are, the less they spend trying to tie people up in courts.  This is all totally prudential. I don't think there's any moral responsibility to not steal from capitalists. It's not like there's any such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism anyway - you're not being any more moral by buying these products which were produced by exploitation and alienation.  But yeah, $10 a month for spotify and $10 a month for netflix? I can afford to throw $20 a month at media, and at worst it's a bit of peace of mind."

It is true that these businessmen have investments abroad, however, their businesses headquarters are here in Venezuela and the principal source of their wealth is here, and it is from here that they transfer their fortunes to international accounts even with the exchange controls that exist. This demonstrates a unique dynamic in the national economy where the most part of the wealth is lost to imports and through transnationals (including the banks) and the rest through the capital that national businesses are harboring abroad.   This is the reason why the exchange controls emerge. The objective was to prevent the “traditional” operation of undeveloped capitalism in Venezuela, which acts like a revolving door and in which every dollar that enters through the state and the sale of oil through PDVSA, leaves via imports or capital flight without being re-invested back in the country to generate some wealth for the nation.

Unfortunately, there was an uneasy tension within the CNT between anarchists and regular unionists. The former wanted revolution and the latter wanted the CNT to be a recognized, legal union. The group's structures allowed reformists to get into positions of power. Luckily, this didn't stop the initial uprising against the coup or the early expropriations, but it did prevent the CNT from going all the way and actually smashing the state, the only thing that would have completed the revolution and defeated Franco IMO.  There was even a point where the president of Catalonia approached the CNT and basically offered to dissolve the government himself. There was a contentious debate within the union about what to do, but they ultimately hesitated because they didn't know how successful the revolt had been in other sections of Spain and were afraid of pissing off the Allies.

socialism,3dsig1,moreheadthanapillow,-6,Sun Jul 19 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"Again I'm asking a question pertaining to the legitimacy not the morals, not trying to defend Franco just comparing his actions and form of legitimacy to that of the early USSR. To call the Soviet administration a government of the people is a bit of a stretch considering how authoritarian they were, although by no doubt was Franco's administration by the will of the people. I don't see how the actions are different, they both overthrew governments in a civil war, Spanish civil War vs the White Russians and Red Russians. The government they overthrew doesn't matter pertaining to legitimacy because all legitimacy stems from force. My core argument, considering you failed to disect it, is that Franco's government was just as legitimate as that of the Soviets. Finally rather than tell me to read book maybe you should instead read, as your trying to counter a historical point with a social ideal which makes absolutely no sense. Finally I wasn't talking about the morals of Franco's government or that of the USSR but rather their legitimacy ( if I can strain that enough) To say a governments morals are indicators of their respective legitimicy's is delusional, Nazi Germany was a very immoral country but by all means was it legitimate considering it had the force will and support to back its claims. In conclusion the  USSR as an early revolutionary government, I believe, was no more legitimate than that of Franco's administration. To even have the notion that Franco's government wasn't legitimate is crazy considering it ran for more than 20 years. Finally I'm not arguing in favor of the morals of fascists which are without a doubt bad, I'm arguing about the legitimacy of fascist administrations and the hypocrisy I perceive exhibited between views of revolutionaries on both sides of the spectrum's actions which I believe can best be encapsulated by the Political Horseshoe Theory, the idea that the Radical Right shares a lot with the radical left, more than any of you would like to admit."

This republic was very liberal much like the early French Republic, also like the early French Republic it didn't solve problems such as starvation and general attrition and tiredness. In response the democratic Republic was eventually overthrown itself by Lenin and his followers and became the authoritarian state notoriously known as the USSR. Now although most authoritarianism can be tied to Stalin and his policies, the fact of the matter remains that radical socialists overthrew a democratic republic.

Intention doesn't matter in how legitimate a country is, if it was that way Taiwan would own mainland China considering they were a democratic government with the people's intentions in mind whereas at the time China was an authoritarian communist state. China didn't become legitimate through its intentions, it became legitimate through its military and force.

Authoritarian is meant to be an opposite to libertarianism, where the government has controls in all of a peoples affairs. Although most times authoritarian governments have been practiced was in co ordinance with oppressive dictatorial regimes. In theory a democratic government could be given all powers and still remain authoritarian, although authoritarianism does end up usually leading to dictatorships in country's originally not meant to be so like early Nazi Germany or Modern day North Korea (assuming Kim Jong Un is legitimate and not just a puppet to a military junta). Nationalism on the other hand is a bit controversial in the sense that it has been a hot button issue for many years, but it doesn't necessarily have to promote supremacy or racism, just national pride. Again the problem arises that fascist governments have seemed to play and derive their spirit and support from extreme nationalism.

Now, the October revolution is a different story; there was a provisional government (growing in unpopularity due to Kerensky's insistence on continuing Russia's role in WWI) and elections were scheduled for early 1918.  The Mensheviks (SocDems and DemSocs) and the Bolsheviks were competing for the votes of the functionally enfranchised.  The problem is that the Bolsheviks were likely to come in 2nd, with the reactionaries also getting support.  There may have been a need for Menshevik-Bolshevik cooperation that was unlikely for many reasons, Lenin not the least of them.  The problem, to me, with the October Revolution (November 1917 actually due to calendar differences in Russia at the time) was that the Bolsheviks had little support outside Moscow and St. Petersburg (the Soviets that replaced the Duma) and they eventually barred other parties and groups, including anarchists, from participation in the Soviets. And so their claim to represent a mandate of the masses is undermined.  That's why I personally see the Spanish Republican revolutionaries (i.e. the left revolutionaries who responded to the fascists who destroyed their Republic) as more justified than the Bolsheviks.

He doesn't actually own the means of production, nor does he truly support the capitalist system. He's a lukewarm anti-capitalist reformist, and considering his past in the civil rights movement, I think it's far more likely that he does support the rights of the disenfranchised.  Does Sanders go far enough? No. But is he a capitalist? No, I don't think he is either."

Sanders' political career has continued to lean in the direction of law and order. Once elected to Congress, he voted for the Violent Crime Control and Enforcement Act in 1994--one of the infamous Clinton crime bills that billions of dollars to states to beef up local police forces and prisons, and that expanded the federal death penalty to include 60 new offenses.  In response to the last year of protests against police terrorism, he has had little to say besides condemning the high rate of Black unemployment. He angered activists in Vermont when he commented on National Public Radio that anti-racist issues were ""not my cup of tea""--and when he prefaced his comments on the Baltimore Rebellion by sympathizing with police for having ""a very, very difficult job.""   from here   Meanwhile, on the issue of immigration, Sanders has joined the Democratic Party in its attacks on immigrant rights. While he voted against the reactionary bill sponsored by Rep. James Sensenbrenner and passed by the House last year, he has supported other anti-immigrant bills.  He has consistently voted to restrict visas for skilled workers -- like the L-1 Nonimmigrant Reform Act, which he himself cosponsored, arguing that it was wrong for corporations to import workers when they are laying off U.S. employees. He voted for the Goodlatte Amendment to eliminate the visa lottery that distributes 55,000 visas a year to foreign workers on a random basis.  Sanders voted for the Border Tunnel Protection Act that criminalizes digging tunnels under the border, and anyone who uses them. And he voted for the Marshall Amendment to the 2007 Homeland Security bill that funds electronic verification of employment eligibility.   from here  can you show me, besides some stuff that happened over 40 years ago, where he is not a typical racist soc-dem? It's not a matter of not being ""radical enough"" but of not being radical at all."
socialism,3dt52e,anichai,0,Mon Jul 20 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"I think the first example you provide makes a far more convincing argument that he's more of the same. However, I don't think the second set of examples really show that he's racist. He voted against providing work visas because he believed it would help with unemployment. That's not really racist thinking there. The end result might not be good for immigrants, but his reasoning isn't racist. I don't think Sanders voted for that bill because he hates immigrants.  It's also really easy to make a non-racist argument for criminalizing tunnels underneath our borders; it's far better for immigrants to come in legally than for them to come in illegally. Immigrants that come in illegally are being exploited by the bourgeoisie, and legal immigration helps to mitigate that exploitation. There are definitely better solutions to the problem than what he voted for, but it's not on its face a racist bill.  Sanders is absolutely a soc dem. Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending his revolutionary or radical credentials. I just don't think he's really a racist either, or a capitalist for the matter. He's a reformist, but he's not a racist.  If you want some evidence that he's not racist take a look here. In that video, he lashes out at ""tough on crime"" legislation in 1991. He mentions African-Americans at the very end of the speech. He's also very recently reacted to the criticism he received from the BLM movement by mentioning the names of the murdered African-Americans, just like they wanted him to do in the first place. If I were cynical, I'd say that he's just trying to win their votes. But even if that's all he's doing, it's still not something a racist would do."
socialism,3dt52e,DocNedKelly,6,Mon Jul 20 09:26:54 2015 UTC,"You are a racist because you believe racism is something individuals ""are"" or ""are not"" rather than an ideological superstructure reflective of a system of white supremacy in the very bones of historically manifested capitalism. Sanders is a racist because his actions in power are part of a racist system of oppression as are you for reducing a radical anti-racist critique into liberal identity politics."
socialism,3dt52e,smokeuptheweed9,3,Mon Jul 20 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"The end result might not be good for immigrants, but his reasoning isn't racist. I don't think Sanders voted for that bill because he hates immigrants.   Ideology is a funny thing under capitalism, it has created a system run by racism and Colonialism but barely anyone says they are a racist. The direct result of criminalizing undocumented economic refugees actions is more Colonialism, whether or not he articulated it that way that is materially a racist policy.   Just because a capitalist says they are paying you minimum wage for the sake of the company does not make the fact that the capitalist is using you for surplus value extraction any less real.   Immigrants that come in illegally are being exploited by the bourgeoisie, and legal immigration helps to mitigate that exploitation.   So open up programs (like, for example the work visas Bernie was against...) to help people get in ""legally"". Also let's be real here, Capitalism and Colonialism made these boundaries in order to oppress people, and the conditions undocumented refugees are escaping from are caused by the same system (and even the same amerikan government) that Sanders is supposedly criticizing. And since when is harming poor Brown workers part of a socialist ""political revolution"" anyway?   He's a reformist, but he's not a racist.   cool.   If you want some evidence that he's not racist take a look here. In that video, he lashes out at ""tough on crime"" legislation in 1991.    one problem, the crime bill that you couldn't dispute (and said provided ""a far more convincing argument that he's more of the same"") was passed in 1994, so not only is he a soc-dem, he's a shitty lying one at that.    If I were cynical, I'd say that he's just trying to win their votes. But even if that's all he's doing, it's still not something a racist would do.   Really? A racist wouldn't promise something to oppressed people and then betray them when in office? Remember Bush (junior) promised a form of immigration reform and then made the Department of ""Homeland Security"" which specializes in deporting undocumented workers.   Obama was the same idea, he promised ""hope and change"" and yet, here we are with national movements against police brutality edging on a wider criticism of Colonialism and he is enacting ""blue alert laws"". Also it is worth noting Obama has deported more undocumented people than the supposedly more conservative Bush."

I also thought that it was particularly problematic that the focus was only on police mistreatment of blacks, because in Arizona, police targeting of Hispanics is by far the larger issue and this protest seemed for foreclose a discussion of that issue, as when Sanders talked about Hispanic unemployment rates there was no reaction from BLM but they did applaud a bit when he talked about the 51% black male youth unemployment rate.  I think the problem is that Sanders did come up as an old-school Socialist (yeah, a Socialist) and he thinks - however earnestly - that focusing on race issues undercuts his idea that broad solutions to poverty that would positively impact disadvantaged and disenfranchised groups (especially, for example, that black households have less wealth and live in poorer neighborhoods than whites of equal incomes) and that PoC - being poorer - would benefit in outsized kind from broad social welfare policies like free education, free healthcare, etc...  He sees racial issues as primarily economic, and while I don't know the degree to which he thinks that is true, that's obviously not entirely true.  Racial biases in employment are independent of poverty, racial biases in policing also exist independent of poverty, and so on.    However, aside from increased federal prosecution of police departments who gun down unarmed black people, many or most of those policies come from the state and local level and federal oversight of individual police departments can only go so far (just from the perspective of staffing and manpower).  Conversely, on broad economic issues, there is more power for the federal government."

Your argument here is essentially that he gets to dictate the terms of the conversation and they don't. Formally, this is true, it's his rally. But as far as being a civil servant and a socialist goes; if people force their voices to be heard you need to shut up and listen. Your characterization is untrue. They were there for one specific purpose, which was to bring up black lives matter. That doesn't mean he can't talk about anything else; and by god he did; it means that they're making a demand in a public forum to bring their issue to the table. If this was Scott Walker or Mitt Romney we wouldn't even blink at that. When protesters show up to fight the WTO they weren't invited to speak, they had to fight for the venue and make their voices heard. That's what you do.

This is true and untrue. You have socialists, like his 'idol' Debbs, who lived long before him and never took a position like this. He was very vocal about racial oppression in America at a time where it cost him a lot more than it would cost Bernie today. You can't just boil this down into a generational difference when generations of people before him came to the progressive conclusion naturally. This is just him, his idolization of the white working class in the 50's, and his whole middle class attitude.  But on the other hand, we hear his views about immigration, certain economic issues, and climate change and they're clearly dated. He takes the nationalist line on immigration, that we must put workers in this country first. He takes cheap shots at China, the same kind republicans would take, that they're stealing our jobs and we need to bring them back home. He's hung up on unemployment and 'we need to put people back to work!'. His notion that we have a middle-eastern oil dependency is rooted in absolutely nothing; because we don't; except scare tactics and misinformation.   So if you want to say he's a dinosaur on these issues and others, that's fair. But his age is not an excuse here. He just has a bad platform. He's to the right of Hilary Clinton on immigration, for christ's sake.    He sees racial issues as primarily economic, and while I don't know the degree to which he thinks that is true, that's obviously not entirely true. Racial biases in employment are independent of poverty, racial biases in policing also exist independent of poverty, and so on.   And because that's not true, we need people who are willing to interrupt the liberal echo chamber and make that known. You could argue that Blacklivesmatter could have made their point better; but the fact that they were there at all is important."

socialism,3dt52e,thisusernamerules,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"What is ""nationally-oppressed""? Just nationwide oppression?   Yes, but not in the non-marxist sense of ""nation"". A nation is a coherent community of people with some common objective things tying them together (history, specific oppression, what have you). It's hard to specifically pin down in general, but in the US specifically due to the effects of Colonialism and white-supremacy, there are distinct, oppressed Black and Brown nations.    Why are blacks and whites different ""people"", and why would an upper class fellow who immigrated yesterday belong to the same ""nationally-oppressed people"" as someone who was put in an internment camp?   There are still class divisions in nationally-oppressed communities, that is why. Especially with the introduction of neo-colonialism, which empowered some segments of nationally-oppressed people at the expense of the vast majority.   Take for example the dialectic between a general worker and their boss. There are also numerous dialectical contradictions inside of each ""strand"", the male worker versus his female housewife, the white-settler versus the non-white Colonized, the rather well off manager of the union versus the rank and file membership ect. Even the boss has his own internal contradictions, whether it is with different bosses, his own wife or what not.  What neo-colonialism did (after the 60s struggles) was introduce in amerika a contradiction between a comprador bourgeoisie, and the white-settler bourgeoisie. For the most part, wealthier africans, wealthy ""asians"" (its not really that great to look at asians as one group in amerika since they have so many different trajectories of oppression) and integrated Latin@s.   But for the vast majority of nationally-oppressed people conditions haven't changed much, and they regard this comprador group as either a strange friend, or an outright enemy. This makes a lot of sense when you realize that in Baltimore, where there was a rebellion, there was a Black mayor who condemned  Black people for rebelling against a police department that has quite a few Black people in it. Of course, since white-supremacy is still dominant, the Black cop still follows the laws of Colonial Capitalism, it's just that it becomes harder to see the white-supremacy at the root."

One former supporter, in a recent letter to socialistworker.org, describes how Central American solidarity activists picketed the General Electric factory in Burlington that manufactured machineguns used in military helicopters against peasant guerrillas: “I vividly remember Bernie standing arms-folded alongside the right-wing union officials from the factory and the Burlington Police Department as we were being arrested. He falsely insinuated that we were ‘anti-worker,’ and he refused to have any serious political dialogue with us activists.”   There was also the instance in 2006 during the Bush Impeachment protests where supporters of his staged a sit-in at his office and he had them arrested. Some of them were elderly. This was in a Vermont town with just over 1000 people. I can find reports of him writing off their concerns, but I can't find any reports of him calling the police.

This whole system was never built in our favor, and ignoring and sidelining the systemic oppression and Colonial exploitation POC face specifically disarms socialists from actually fighting it. Investing yourself in Bernie necessitates ignoring the oppression POC face. Even worse it requires distancing yourself from the most radical movements in the US today that are rejecting Bernie and are attacking the Capitalist Colonialism at the root of ""mass incarceration""."

I think that it was definitely true in the jim crow era and in the Harlem renaissance/black ghetto era, and racism (and 'stigmatised labour') does seem integral to the formation of US capitalism (with jim crow prison gangs, and New York and other ghettoes providing cheap labour of a stigmatised social group etc after WW1) but this perspective ignores that middle and upper class black people were essentially integrated into the mainstream of US society after the civil rights era, there are immigrant black communities and 'poc' communities that do better than the white majority as a whole and the black elite have been intrinsically involved in the dissolution of working class black areas of the Chicago south side, parts of new york and elsewhere, if racism was integral to this then why would this be happening.   Sanders is a social democrat, he's not Rosa Luxumberg, but he has pretty serious plans for full employment, infrastructure and a return to a sane welfare policy that would do way more than the blacklivesmatter movement seems to be able to accomplish.

Wealth is increasingly accumulated, inherited and concentrated leaving the means of production mostly in the hands of a tiny segment of the population. This is the natural trajectory of market systems operating within the capitalist mode of production and management. The goal is to maximize profit and increase marketshare, which means extracting as much value as possible out of a workers labour. This leaves the working class poorer and the capitalists richer, allowing them to perpetuate their place in the authoritarian structure of capitalism.

It is an abstraction meant to signify a group of people involved in the act of governing. Furthermore there is a better chance of me becoming a member of government than becoming a capitalist. Actually, we can go one step further: It's not outside the realm of possibility that one could imagine a governing system in which literally everyone would be involved in the process. Not only could ""anyone"" become part of the government, everyone could. On the contrary, while ""anyone"" can become capitalist, not everyone can (since a capitalist presupposes workers). Or rather, the only way everyone could become a capitalist is in a way which directly undermines the premise to begin with. In other words you would be left with some form of market socialism in which everyone owns equal shares of the company in which they work (I'm not advocating market socialism, I'm just citing this as an example).    In any case I repeat my question. I'm well aware the libertarian view of the state - I was trying to get you to address the arbitrary nature of the justification (otherwise you could have just objected on the basis of the libertarian view on taxation). Take the slave example: at what point does this justification - they built it with their own capital - break down? You're obviously against slavery I assume. Is your objection one only based on legality (ie the concept of ownership) or the condition? Is it both? What if someone is not legally a slave - that is they are not owned - but their condition is worse than that of a slave? To simply tell them to get a new/better job is like telling a slave to ""Just purchase your own freedom"". This isn't a regulatory principle. Who is going to decide all of this? Someone will have to... And on that basis the only qualification for that which the justification disappears can be arbitrary (quantity of hours worked or pay given, quality of condition) and therefore insufficient, even if we can assume a consensus is reached."

I've tried to address this in other ""chats"", and I've noticed something, socialist think that employers have all the chips, so to speak, and that they are incapable of empathy.

Somebody from /r/socialism will happily move in and start working that land. They don't believe in things like absentee ownership, i.e. if you're not one of the workers utilising a piece of land/a factory/the means of production, you have no right to claim ownership of it. For them, using that farm without your permission is not a violation of the NAP since it's no longer your farm.  If you come by to check on it you'll see trespassers and ask them to leave.

Wouldn't a libertarian government have to offer the Church some sort of recourse for this violation of NAP? But then we'd have to ask, well how did the Church get those lands in the first place? You'll find that it wasn't through voluntary exchange, and almost assuredly violated the NAP.

Either you get exploited by a capitalist, or desitution. Knowing that these two are my options, obviously I have chosen the shitty job I currenlty have, obviously I have chosen pittyless exploitation that comes with wage labour.  You say that everyone can become a capitalist? That does not even hold true in nature, seeing as competition drives the socially nescessary labour time down whilst forcing new investment in more effective means of production. That is very good for the bigger companies, who can sustain a drop in the return on each investeed dollar by producing more, but a small manufacturer or new capitalist with limited capital cannot.

socialism,3dx8pk,klarken1,4,Mon Jul 20 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"What kind of ""libertarian"" are you? Anarcho-capitalist, or nightwatchman-state? With that important question out of the way, have a few challenges:  1) How can a society be ""libertarian"" when it is dominated by an authoritarian way of organizing labor? Capitalists have social power because they own the means of production, they decide where to produce, what to produce, and most important, who is allowed to do said production for them in which way. There is nothing ""libertarian"" about a capitalist firm, they are economic dictatorships.   2) You might want to answer 1) by pointing to the ""function"" of the market, telling me that workers can pick and choose between capitalists and are totally ""free"" to leave a given firm if they don't like it there. This misses out on the fact that workers might be able to quit one company, but that they still have to work somewhere if they want to live, meaning that they are not unfree regarding the choice if they want to work for one specific capitalist, but unfree in their relation to the whole class of capitalists. You can't be free if your life depends on being exploited by some guy or the other, who buys your labour power, meaning that at least half of your waking hours, and probably much more, is dominated by being an unfree, dominated and alienated person.  3) What about competition? Each worker is set up by the ""free"" market system to compete against other workers, not only over getting a job, but also over keeping it. How can you be ""free"" if the ""invisible hand"" of the fucking market is forcing you into a price fight against other workers, if it opens you up to the capitalists' ""argument"" that you must accept even more exploitation (less money in hand), or simply lose your income, on which you depend? The whole setup is anti-libertarian, it takes choice from the individuals and puts a gun to their head. It puts everyone in society against the other, producing a fucking social-darwinist's wet dream, and making it 100% sure that there is a constant flow of ""losers"" who are thrown to the wolfes.  You might think that ""the market"" is the natural(TM) way of organizing production and distribution, making an attack on its oppression producing laws ""irrational"", but if you take a look at history, you will soon see that ""the laws of the market"" are the product of the very specific historical configuration known as capitalism. For most of human history, there were no ""laws of the market"", and if people want it, they can be abolished and replaced with a democratically controlled planned economy in which production happens for the needs of everyone, not the profits of a few."

Okay I was going  point by point, but I'm going to leave my first response.  2) this comes down to the freedom of choice, but there are more than the two you have presented, work outside of your morals, or starve.

Does that mean you agree with me?  On to what you actually wrote about: People are forced to consume because they have real physical needs, and as long as capitalism is the system of social reproduction, they are forced to consume products of capitalist corporations. They might boykott one firm, but they will have to buy at another, or suffer the real world material consequences. You can't live without foodstuffs, without a means of transportation, without a house/flat and everything that goes with it. The freedom to ""not buy"" is an illusion. In addition, the capitalists control the whole process of production, meaning that consumers don't even know what is really inside the stuff they eat (!!) or use, and how it will effect them. Related to this: Capitalist are constantly lying, it's called ""advertisment"".  Many corporations have such market power that they are the only available source in many locations, think for example of Walmart and the way they destroyed all the small competition, forcing older people in the countryside into unmanageable supply situations. Conclusion: The consumer is not ""king"", but chattel.  2) I have two responses:  a) It's ridiculous to belief that some workers who don't like a corporation can just band together and start their own business. That may be a (very very risky!) possibility on the level of mom and pop shops, but its nearly impossible in all the capital intensive industries that dominate the market. It's not 1870 anymore (and it wasn't possible for most then, either!), starting a business is a no-go-proposition for the huge majority of people, despite the ""dishwasher"" (nerdy teenager) to billionaire memes that are so beloved in the capitalist press and mythology.  b) Even you manage to conquer all the problems, you are instantly confronted with the fact of competition. What if your product is better and produced under better conditions for workers and environment, but costs more than the competition? Well, you have to start cut costs... it's a neverending spiral, and having good intentions doesn't mean that you will prevail. More likely, you will fall to the sharks who have no ethical problems with lying to consumers and selling their agroindustrial stuff as ""biologically produced"", just for example.  3) Dude, are you serious? This was a protest by employees and consumers that went against the demands of the ""free market"". It's also an anecdote without significance for the whole of capitalist production. As I said, single corporations might be boykotted for a time, but you can't stop consuming, meaning you are compelled to buy from some capitalist enterprise."

The moment he was forced to quit the game was finally over and Tsipras, that two-faced weasel gave in to each and every demand of theirs.

I don't think it was his preference, but from what both he and Lapavitsas are saying, my impression is that Varoufakis didn't think it was possible to turn around after the referendum and sign the same or worse austerity plan, so he at least was willing to follow the referendum's logic and continue opposition to the plan that was offered. I think he was still angling for a face-saving deal to keep Greece in the Euro, but if left as Finance Minister he might have not been willing to go that path at all costs. Tsipras by contrast seems to have considered leaving the Euro so disastrous that it had to be avoided at all costs, so sacked Varoufakis when the parallel-liquidity idea was being debated (issuing scrip puts you basically one foot outside the Euro, not irreversibly, but certainly on that path).  The problem with Varoufakis's version of taking a hard line is that he seems to have been forced into it by events really late, too late to even come up with much in the way of preparations. The Left Platform correctly pointed out that preparations at least as a contingency plan should've been underway for months."

socialism,3dugv4,lovelynothing,7,Sun Jul 19 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"Not even two minutes in and he's already gotten it wrong.  Permanent Revolution was written in the context of semi-Feudal Russia. In that sense yes a fair deal of the writing itself was written with a mind to those relations. But that's an extremely limited view of its application and rejecting it as ""probably wrong"" is indicative of a really vague idea of what a Socialist construction of society actually requires.  Firstly let me admit that he did, indirectly, make a somewhat insightful statement in deriding Trotskyist organisations for thinking Permanent Revolution is an analysis pertinent to the current organisation of the working class in Europe. It really isn't, firstly because in the developed centres of Capitalism(i.e. UK) there wont be the problems for the working class that were presented in Trotsky's hypothesis, and secondly because the issue of Permanent Revolution's correctness or not and how to act on that only really comes into play once the Proletariat has seized power in the country in question.  Secondly, to limit Permanent Revolution to Semi-Feudal relations is just not correct. The focus was based on the productive forces in relation to the periphery of Capitalism. For example, Permanent Revolution would be something that a revolutionary party in, say, Greece or Ireland might keep in mind, because they have very undeveloped productive forces.   The emphasis at Trotsky's time, because he was writing for the Russian working class, was on the semi-feudal relations and large peasant population. But this was a concern insofar as the limit of productive forces in Russia and how this would restrict the Socialist transformation of society. This was linked to the Semi-Feudal relations, obviously, because Feudalistic countries don't have well developed productive forces, and consequently it doesn't have a strong industrial proletariat capable of seizing power by itself and, secondly, producing enough to cater for the needs of the population.   If you read The Revolution Betrayed you can see Trotsky repeatedly reference this with the Marx quote of all the old crap getting resurrected again as a result of the generalised want.  But just because it was linked at that time to Russia's semi-feudal relations doesn't mean that the general problem of poorly developed productive forces isn't a major issue, which the analysis of Permanent Revolution is addressing. There are obviously some very much more technical details which were written with the intention to concretely address Russia and it's problems specifically, but there is a framework which Trotsky did leave us to work with.  I'll get around to watching the rest of this but I can't say I'm instilled with confidence on the get go. Which was unfortunate, I did very much like the last talk on Lenin's What is to be done?."

EDIT: Here is the bit from Engels, quoted in the linked article:   [Owen] introduced labor bazaars for the exchange of the products of labor through the medium of labor-notes with the labor-hour as the unit; institutions necessarily doomed to failure, but completely anticipating the much later Proudhon exchange bank, and differing only from the latter in that they did not claim to be the panacea for all social ills, but just a first step towards a much more radical transformation of society.    That presumably means that the exchange bank involved ""labor-notes with the labor-hour as the unit."" But Proudhon seems to have been quite explicit that the unit of the bills of exchange is the franc, and the basis for issuing the bills was the monetization of products. Now, it's not any secret that Marx and Proudhon identified the mechanism of exploitation in different ways, so perhaps Marx and Engels would still have had nasty things to say about the actual model of Proudhon's ""banks,"" but the ""labor money"" business seems to be a mistake that has become a bit of Marxist mythology."

I dunno, I mean it's certainly not universal amongst or unique to Trotskyists, but there's a certain arrogance that comes with being a Trotskyist which is so frustrating and insufferable, like they're the saviours of the world here in the nick of time to lead us leaderless people. And they can never seem take 'fuck off, we're fine' for an answer. Again, not something that they all do, but there are enough of them doing it around where I study and work that it gets pretty exhausting.  Trotskyists cop this because there are lot of them and they're loud. Anarchists and MLs and others would probably do the same thing in their position, but they aren't. There's of course also the endless splitting and self-lionizing, but again these happen in every left movement.

socialism,3duhbo,anichai,3,Sun Jul 19 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"There's often not a real basis to it. People are within their bubbles with comrades of their current and it's easy to just circlejerk over the stereotypes without actually exposing yourself to the reality.   There is an issue of sectarianism with Trotskyist organisations, you'll often find they can be really uncooperative with other people, but this itself is eroding away from their way of operation as the period of struggle shifts.  Like for other things like news papers, every party has a news paper and every party hawks one. Trotskyists are just the most proliferate at it because they view the paper as a way of initiating conversations as well as putting forward broad programmatic points.   For the splitting, it's really just an unfair representation of them. Yeah there are a lot of Trot sects in some places but that's part of the overall left culture in those places. There are quite a few countries where MLs are far more splitty than Trots, or where Trots have consolidated themselves around 1 or 2 orgs. The funniest aspect of Trot splitting would have to be with the Internationals - last I counted there were 42 of them, though granted most are no longer active, and there's probably maybe 3 worth any note. But I think it's actually a good thing to have internationals, even if you're a shitty and irrelevant org, because you need an internationalist perspective.  As for hating Trots as a result for hating Trotsky historically, there are some weirdos who are like that and have their politics about 80 years out of date - you can see it mostly with Maoists of sorts and with Hoxhaist/Anti-Revisionist orgs who still produce literature on the ""dangers of Trotskyism"" and how we must ""watch out for crypto-Trotskyites"" but these are fringe.  Most of the issues people have with ""Trotskyists"" they just mean ""I don't like my local organisation which happens to be Trotskyist"", and because of historical reasons they can get away with shit talking Trotskyists as a whole."
socialism,3duhbo,AnonSocialist,3,Sun Jul 19 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"As an anarchist, my problems with Trotskyism are as follows:   It's just a very poor theory. I am already very critical of Lenin and the Bolshevik Party as a whole for various reasons, but to me Trotskyism make it even worse by adding Trotsky's poor rationalizations for his failures into the mix. To me, the concept of a ""Degenerated Worker's-State"" is an incoherent mess, which only hides the true character of the USSR from the beggining - a state-capitalist regime, which Trotsky himself played a role in establishing. It's just a very poor practice. When Trotskyists are not engaged in writing outdated newspapers, they are engaged in social-democratic reformism (and constantly splitting and splitting and splitting with each other at that), which just doesn't achieve anything. Where i live, ""Marxist"" politics is dominated by incredibly poor and incredibly numerous Trotskyist sects that are becomin less and less relevant day by day; and every single one of their polemics against other tendencies and social movements (and shit, do they just love writing those!) always  betray an enormous wilfull ignorance about what other Socialists have been doing or what their theories are about. Trotsky himself was, to me, a huge hypocrite who played an awful historical role. During his period in power he was an open supporter of party dictatorship, the repression of different tendencies and autonomous working class activity, the smashing of the Makhnovists and Kronstadt; yet after being kicked from power he built a carreer on pretending to be some sort of ""Democratic"" Socialist, pretending he never did anything wrong and pretentiously posing himself as a leader/saviour of the ""true"" worker's movement. Trotsky Protests too Much by Emma Goldman and the Manuscript on Their Morals and Ours by Victor Serge (himself a former ally of Trotsky in the Left-Opposition days!) are my favorite polemics against the man himself, and i recommend everyone read both.   Though, to give credit where credit is due, the Johnson–Forest Tendency and the Socialisme ou Barbarie group originated from unorthodox sections of the Fourth International before ultimately splitting with it, adopting more ""left-communist"" positions and helping develop Marxism-Humanism and the Situationist International respectively (themselves valuable traditions), so Trotskyism was not entirely worthless."

If we say democracy/republic/constitutional state, or whatever, to describe what exists, becomes an effort of mere terminology. The reality of the situation is that individual participation in politics, decision making and power is almost nonexistent. It's always been next to nonexistent. This is one of the reasons why the USA has been called ""an oligarchy, not a democracy"", and not by fringe elements. Political power and decision making in politics does not come from the people. Those who say the USA is not a democracy tend to come from all over the political spectrum, because they aren't entirely wrong: the system has always had very little kratos by the demos. The democratic ideal, that ""all people are involved in making polity or state decisions,"" to paraphrase, is never really reached. A significant part of the population doesn't even vote in elections.  The idea that electing rulers is superior to direct individual participation isn't exactly strange to American politics or fringe, either. We're talking about a country that was founded by a wealthy elite with the deliberate exclusion of millions of people - women, slaves, etc – from political participation. The system of representative democracy was also invented in a time where large scale, direct participation in democracy was basically impossible. You can't coordinate direct democracy over long geographical distances without mass communication.

Another redditer made a webpage on it http://anticapitalismfaq.com/econdem/  Re. investment, the basic idea is that the investment process would be ""socialized"".  In Schweikart's model, there are local, democratically controlled banks (essentially democratic membership organizations) that handle investment.  There is a national investment fund that is distributed to local banks on a per capita basis.  Then these democratically controlled banks invest in new cooperatives, allocating investment resources according to the needs and wants of the community.  To generate new investment capital, there is a flat tax on the capital assets of each enterprise, which is then redistributed to local banks on a per capita basis.    In capitalism, investment capital is the property of billionaires and banksters, which allows them to control virtually every facet of society (especially media and politics).  In socialism, investment capital is socialized and in the people's control.  This makes it easier for ordinary people to get the investment capital they need to start new businesses.  Which leads to an economy that is less centralized and more localized, and where people have a management stake in the enterprise where they work.  In socialism, enterprises are democratically managed by the workers instead of by the boss.  We call this ""economic democracy"".  Ultimately, capitalism and democracy are incompatible, and democracy cannot flourish until there is also socialism and consequently economic democracy.  If you have the funds I recommend ordering Schweikart's book immediately--you won't regret it."

socialism,3dsrye,Shurelyasrev,7,Sun Jul 19 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with you. Ultimately, a market economy would not be the goal of Socialism. However, transitionally, markets will most likely play some role under socialism. We must consider the class nature of the market. Of course a Capitalist market is totally out of the question, but a market that is guided and funded by democratic means by the working class will be an essential tool of building socialism."

socialism,3dsrye,derivative_of_life,5,Sun Jul 19 04:37:11 2015 UTC,"My cursory understanding is that you would utilize economic planning & labor vouchers (used as a sort-of currency), supplemented by algorithms which would help distribute goods and labor in response to changes in supply and demand. I'm probably not doing this justice so you should look into it yourself by reading about the calculation debate. This can get you started: http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf   You should also research participatory economics, which I think is more of an anarchist's response to your question."
socialism,3dsrye,hotpie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:09:11 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that in economics investment and stocks are usually not the same thing. Stock refers to ownership and it can be resold. Investment is the actual act of deploying capital to production for more production.  In capitalism, when you buy stock, it only really becomes investment if the money generated from the sale of stock is used to create new production facilities or to newly improve production. If old stock is just resold by one owner to another new owner, that's not investment.  In socialism, there would be (more) worker/community ownership and control over investment. Whether or not markets were kept, there'd be more planning at the micro and macro levels to decide what to invest on, and this would be more influenced by community determined social needs."

socialism,3dsrye,TheRadicalAntichrist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:21:08 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. There may be many opinions about this subject, but I'll give it a go.  When we talk about Socialism, we must always think about the class character of the system. Socialism is the mode of production that strips the massive, disproportionate wealth from the Capitalist class and gives it to the working class. This wealth is where the majority of Capitalist investment comes from and it is the basis of the stock market's functioning.   This wealth should not be controlled by a few investors, but should instead be controlled, invested and distributed democratically for the good of our planet and the working class. Though it is impossible to know exactly how the state would be formed or function under the early stages of Socialism, it must be done under those circumstances. If I had to guess, I would say that investments would be handled by officials that have been elected to invest the money responsibly. This system would necessarily need to be fully transparent and the officials would be subject to immediate impeachment if necessary.   Edit:  I'll back up my statement with a passage from Lenin's ""The State and Revolution""   ""What we have to deal with here [in analyzing the programme of the workers' party] is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it comes.""  It is this communist society, which has just emerged into the light of day out of the womb of capitalism and which is in every respect stamped with the birthmarks of the old society, that Marx terms the “first”, or lower, phase of communist society.  The means of production are no longer the private property of individuals. The means of production belong to the whole of society. Every member of society, performing a certain part of the socially-necessary work, receives a certificate from society to the effect that he has done a certain amount of work. And with this certificate he receives from the public store of consumer goods a corresponding quantity of products. After a deduction is made of the amount of labor which goes to the public fund, every worker, therefore, receives from society as much as he has given to it.  [...]  ""Marx not only most scrupulously takes account of the inevitable inequality of men, but he also takes into account the fact that the mere conversion of the means of production into the common property of the whole society (commonly called “socialism”) does not remove the defects of distribution and the inequality of ""bourgeois laws"" which continues to prevail so long as products are divided ""according to the amount of labor performed"". Continuing, Marx says:  ""But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged, after prolonged birth pangs, from capitalist society. Law can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.""  And so, in the first phase of communist society (usually called socialism) ""bourgeois law"" is not abolished in its entirety, but only in part, only in proportion to the economic revolution so far attained, i.e., only in respect of the means of production. ""Bourgeois law"" recognizes them as the private property of individuals. Socialism converts them into common property. To that extent--and to that extent alone--""bourgeois law"" disappears."""

If it's between those two, I would probably go with paying workers the worth of the goods that they produce, since it takes out the hassle and time needed to go to market with the goods that you produce in order to sell, but personally I disagree with the idea that workers need to be dependent on pay for their work, because it perpetuates the cycle of imprisonment that many people find themselves in as they're tied to their work for survival."
