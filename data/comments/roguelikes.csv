roguelikes,3e1hgu,notapencil,56,Tue Jul 21 05:58:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's important not to dismiss the article out of hand. It obviously comes off as very negative to us in the community, but it both consciously and unconsciously raises a lot of important points for both players and designers of roguelike games.  Firstly, let's be clear that this article is well-written (by video game journalistic standards) and goes to lengths to talk about various aspects of the game. It's critiques the game without being outright dismissive of it. The writer obviously went to efforts to play the game and give it a fair chance, including reading online guides. He goes much further than the average player would. He also seems keenly aware that there are quality aspects to the game but it's just not the right game for him. ""It wasn't my thing and I feel dead bad about that."" From the positive points he raises I'm sure the devs are noticing a tinkle in sales.  Now RPS normally go further than this. They're the only mainstream site I know of that covers traditional roguelikes at all, and the likes of Brogue, ADOM and UnReal World have all gotten positive coverage there. But this is an Early Access review, and the writer makes it clear from the start that he's approaching it as a game he finds worth writing about in a sea of otherwise mostly junk. Were this the full release I think the likes of Adam Smith at RPS would give it a much more thorough review.  But as an early access game, with the obscurity of interface Caves of Qud has, do you really think this has wide appeal? Is the review really so far off the mark in its criticisms? Let's look at some important points...  Interface  The writer, in spite of reading guides and trying multiple times, can't figure out how to attack with his weapon properly. Now whose fault is it that a determined player can't figure this out, the designer or the player? Caves of Qud has had a lick of graphical paint, but it still lacks many things to make it properly accessible to new players. A lot of people who would otherwise like the game are going to get instantly turned away. Certainly a lot of RPS' readers aren't going to try anywhere near as hard as the writer did, and it would be foolish for RPS to recommend a game like it without severe warnings.  We are now in the age of Steam Refunds after all. Any starting interface issues are going to mean an instant reversed sale. Games need to do more to swiftly get new players adjusted, through tutorials or in-game help text or whatever else. If a common problem is identified then adapt the game to look for that problem and advise the player on what they're doing wrong.  Some things about Qud are never going to be truly fixed - it's an old school roguelike at its core, and the detailed simulation can never be truly satisfied by a slick interface. But the game can most definitely do better, and other games like ToME and Cogmind are showing just how much more can be done to make a complex roguelike accessible.  Over-selling / Managing Expectations  ""Caves of Qud probably has one of the best Early Access pitches I've read – and it would have to be to get me to play it."" Interesting line! And it identifies this really hideous problem of needing to sell your game hard but not over-sell it. If you promise too much and don't deliver then players get annoyed (hence the many Kickstarter backlashes).  CoQ doesn't really oversell in my opinion, but it could do more to show glimpses of the goodness at the start of the game. Every long story needs a good hook at the start to keep people engaged through the more difficult parts. Hints at the political factions and the overarching story can do great things to grab the player's attention and make them want to find out more.  Repetitive Starts  The writer goes through the same motions multiple times, and at the end feels distraught at not making progress. This is probably not helped by him restarting the same character build. This is bad for roguelike design! Replaying the same content is rarely as fun.  In particular with the character builds the ""restart the same"" can be a trap, as a player can end up repeating a bad character design. But then it's also necessary when the player doesn't want to repeat a dozen different options every time they restart :P The easy way around this is to have preset builds matching certain archetypes so players can jump in with a reasonably balanced character design and switch between archetypes quickly on replays. Would be great if players could also save their own archetypes and share them with others in the community :)  Gotcha Quests  The writer describes a few things as ""gotcha"" quests, as in quests billed as starters that actually aren't, or advice given by NPCs that is outright wrong. I'm not sure on the truth of this (I haven't played the latest version - I know, shame on me :P) but if true that's obviously bad design for new players.  Similarly getting insta-killed by a rifle turret isn't nice. This sort of stuff is just going to aggravate players, especially if they're new to the game and struggling with learning basic controls. Don't piss off your players as soon as they start your game!  Permadeath in a Lengthy Game  This is a big issue, and one that a few modern roguelikes (ToME, Dungeonmans) have taken different approaches to. Now I personally love permadeath, and I wouldn't want my Qud any other way, but it is important to consider the impact it can have on accessibility. When trying to learn a game, especially a big game from an unfamiliar genre, repetitive death is tough and can quickly become off-putting.  I first started roguelikes with Hack, and permadeath in that never felt bad. It was a linear game, it was quick to play, it didn't have that much to learn. But when I moved on to ADOM I save-scummed. Hell, a lot of people save-scummed. It was the way of learning big roguelikes back in the day. Most designers deliberately didn't obstruct save-scumming because it was known as a way to learn. We all knew it wasn't the ""right"" way to play, and maybe if I hadn't done it I would have learned faster/better/stronger, but it made the game much easier to get into. In particular since ADOM had an overworld and quest options and many things to explore.  Nowadays save-scumming is an arcane, difficult thing to do. Files get hidden in odd, protected directories. Some people have Macs! And for a Steam users who never touch directories and messy filesystems it's simply a no-go area. So if we want people to have the same learning opportunities as many of us had when we started in roguelikes we need to move the save-scumming inside the game.  ToME does this - it has an Adventure Mode with a lives system. Other games have permadeath optional, or have some meta-game to take the sting out of death. Heck, Nethack had wizard mode built in. These are all replacements for save-scumming, so that people complete new to the genre can adjust. And if done right (make it clear it's a learning tool, not the true way to play) I think they can make the game much more accessible without annoying the hardcore fans.  Oh, and CoQ does have the ability to disable permadeath in debug mode, but it's hidden away and not accessible.  Conclusion  Another line from the review - ""if the game doesn't care to help me, then I struggle to care about the game."" If developers want to attract people from beyond the roguelike core then they need to be the ones that reach out first. That means accessible interfaces, some leniency around death, and ensuring the intro is smooth (either the early game or a tutorial). After all, meeting people halfway is the first step to dragging them to our side :D  Caves of Qud is, of course, still in Early Access, and the devs have many more plans to expand and polish the game. Part of the Early Access experience is encountering problems and learning from them, and this article is something I hope the devs will take closely to heart. Rarely will you get such an eloquent and thought out critique of a game from someone who doesn't enjoy it.  Bonus points: The mouse hover-over text on all of the images tells an entertaining story :)"
roguelikes,3e1hgu,DarrenGrey,9,Tue Jul 21 10:26:55 2015 UTC,"A very well written thesis, Mr Grey. After reading this I can tell the character limit on Twitter must be even more frustrating for you than it is for me, haha.   Joking aside, thanks for writing this. You brought up several points that I was either a). too frustrated by the author's initial tone to grasp or b). hadn't picked up from the article because you put it out a little clearer here. I like Caves of Qud. From knowing nothing about Freehold studios, I have come to really like their games, their writing and at least two of the more vocal central employees ( /u/unormal and /u/ptychomancer ). I did this while pretty new to the Youtube/reddit/etc game stuff too so they left a pretty good impression on me so I, being a fan, and somewhat of rogueliker (har) I did get a touch defensive at seeing some of the more disparaging parts of the article and Mr. Bucklew's initial annoyance at the article.    But yeah. You ( And Mr. Marsh Davies) brought up some points. It looks like he had the most recent build, but either he accidentally slapped * at some point or just scrolled over for screenshots, but the combat scroll UI isn't the most useful for monitoring your health, seeing any status problems or what you are attacking. At least the targeting part is working now as I had to deal with the semi-annoying bug of seeing my rifle or whatever for the entire run instead of what I was battering for my two longest runs. This is mentioned in the in game help which is mapped to F1, which is still pretty standard. Look is also mentioned in that help box so he didn't really need to consult outside help for that tidbit, heh.   In my videos, whenever I give advice for tackling a main quest objective, it is almost always ""level more"". I go five or six levels above the level suggested for golgotha, and like ten above Bethesda Susa. And it is still hard. I've said to get level 8 before attempting Redrock to several users here on the subreddit so I can understand a possible need for balance there. Or luck. A few choice pieces of gear,or a better strategy/set of mutations/grenades could also carry you through it just as easily as ""meat-ing"" your self up enough to smash your way through some snapjaws and girshlings. Speaking of luck, he also hit a ruins square. That's where the albino ape would be lurking, and the turret lying in wait. That's just pure bad luck, and twice from the looks of things.  Permadeath. Love it or hate it it's kind of a badge that most of those names on the sidebar to the right wear prominently. I love it and hate it, personally. It keeps a lot of my friends away from the games I love, but it gives me the thrill of victory or death that keeps me playing the same games till I have finally pounded my way to victory. I kick around game ideas in my head and while I'd like to make a game someday, I'd also like it to have the right percentage of ingredients to allow it to claim the mantle of roguelike. Permadeath is a pretty big part of that mantle. Like the collar, or at least an entire epaulet.  So yeah. My inane ramblings at 5AM.  Rogueliker's Bonus points: I didn't see his apology at the bottom. Ok that makes it a little better."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Rogueliker,5,Tue Jul 21 12:09:23 2015 UTC,"Well said.   I have a lot of respect for Qud and it's a great game but it needs more than a bit of a polish-up to make headway on Steam. When the player can easily get a refund, the first few minutes can make all the difference between continuing or just getting their money back. Inaccessibility generally isn't a big deal with traditional roguelikes, but moving into the commercial sphere changes the playing field entirely.   One of the most useful and welcoming ways I've seen permadeath handled was in...a game which currently eludes me. I'll edit the name in if I remember it later. Basically, if you die very quickly the game says something like ""you didn't last long, do you want to try that again?"" and then moves you back a few turns rather than making you start over. It means that permadeath is intact for the bulk of the game but if you die very early and ignominiously, it shows a bit of flexibility. I like that as an option."

But I have to say that reading this review put me off of it. Why? Because it's precisely the kind of thing I could see myself writing.  Like the author, I have tended to steer away from pure-ASCII roguelikes. The exception here is Brogue, mainly for reasons you outlined above about accessibility and pacing. Here's the thing: despite the fact that I play so many games, I persist in thinking that my time and attention are valuable. Consequently, I'm going to limit myself to playing games that I think are going to respect my time investment. And here's where I have become extremely leery with respect to Caves. I don't want to have to laboriously learn how to perform rudimentary actions, like attacking with weapons instead of with jewelry. And for context: I'm not someone with ADD or who demands instant gratification. This is coming from a guy who reads postmodern philosophy for fun. If I'm not the target demographic for a game like Caves - then who is?"

roguelikes,3e1hgu,ASCII_Rogue,6,Tue Jul 21 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"That attacking bit is nonsense. Surely one must equip a weapon. There would be no depth without that. The way to equip is the most intuitive thing possible. You hit ""i"" for inventory, then scroll to the weapon. Choose the weapon. There will be a few options. Equip (auto) and equip (manual). If you equip (auto), it will go in the right place every time. You will automatically attack with that weapon from now on just by bumping in the direction of the enemy.  Can you actually think of an easier and more intuitive system that also allows for different weapons? I can't."

You will always attempt to hit with the dominant hand (sometimes multiple times). There is then a small chance (greatly increased if you have the dual wield skill) to strike a second time with the non-dominant hand.  I never once had my character strike only with the non-dominant hand. It is true that sometimes I missed with the dominant hand first and then hit with the non-dominant, but it always told me ""You miss"" when that happens. I guess when you only hit with the folding chair or medallion or torch or whatever, it is easy to overlook the full combat log and think you didn't attack with the axe at all."

It made me immediately think, ""Maybe I should check out what's equipped and try equipping a weapon."" It is one of those semi-tutorial design choices, but not in a hand-holding way. Like, hey, something weird is going on, maybe you should check it out and figure out how this works before moving on."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,hilbert90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"The old beta does this also--items you would never deliberately equip (often because they are trade goods or useless trinkets) are sometimes equipped to your hands slot when you start the game.

roguelikes,3e1hgu,DarrenGrey,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"Permadeath in a Lengthy Game   I think this is a crucial point. The review contains a lot of valid criticisms that could presumably be addressed by straightforward improvements and fixes to UI, NPC scripts and level generation. But this is one a fundamental design issue with no obvious solution. Permadeath worked well in the original Rogue -- a game that lasts an hour or so from start to end. I'm just not sure that it works well in games that are much longer."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,penderprime,10,Tue Jul 21 18:03:20 2015 UTC,I think it's a fair assesment of what someone who plays the game who doesn't know how to deeply play roguelikes would come at the game. The developers probably should take it to heart to help decide whether they want to cater only to the hardcore or have a broader audience by making it more accessible.
roguelikes,3e1hgu,yaktaur,7,Tue Jul 21 10:58:14 2015 UTC,IMO; trying to find wide appeal is pointless for roguelikes. Niches and different preferences exist for a reason. Trying to appeal to everyone only results in games that are mediocre for everybody and great for no one.
roguelikes,3e1hgu,ASCII_Rogue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:39 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to make any stance about whether or not to appeal broadly, I just mean if the developer does, this is an interesting article for him to take into consideration. If he doesn't it's less important."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,yaktaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"Well, he's also reviewing the niche itself for a general audience, which is fairly reasonable for people who don't know what an ""old-school roguelike"" would be.  A review of a wargame on a wargaming-dedicated review site probably would (and should!) come at the material from a different standpoint than a general review would.  Another example: games adopted the convention, a while back (not sure if it's still the case these days) of expecting a player to break every crate he sees to get ammunition or health or whatnot.  Now, this really is not something that I would do in a real-life situation.  It's really very a strange thing to want to run around destroying crates.  However, it's reasonable if your audience is already familiar with the genre's conventions.  That doesn't mean that it doesn't make the game unapproachable for those who are not familiar with those conventions, though, and that doesn't mean that it won't prevent people from playing it.  Minecraft could have had an interface that was approachable to a user of CAD software packages.  There is even some reason to want to do this -- it seems very rational if you're targeting CAD users.  But if that had happened, it also would simply have been unusable to the general public.  That doesn't mean that the genre has to be thrown out.  Maybe it means nothing more than a lot of work on a tutorial.  But it does impact the bulk of players out there."

roguelikes,3e1hgu,Cadllmn,10,Tue Jul 21 15:00:33 2015 UTC,"Almost every one of his screenshots of death appear near white walls (ruins). The first time I encountered one of these white walls and died to super powerful beasts, I thought, ""Maybe that had to do with this white wall.""  The next time, I approached cautiously, and was slaughtered again. That confirmed it. No going near white walls until I seriously leveled up.   Maybe this is roguelike mentality that has become intuition after years of playing, but it actually just strikes me as good game playing strategy. It is strange to me that he blames the game. When I look at those screenshots I think, ""Those are totally your own fault.""  It is hard to get out of the mentality of blaming the game and calling it arbitrary difficulty. But seriously, that turret was in the ruin. That wasn't arbitrary. That was refusing to learn the lesson it was teaching you. Turn permadeath off and you are even less likely to learn this lesson."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,hilbert90,8,Tue Jul 21 13:46:57 2015 UTC,"This. Learning from experience is an essential part of roguelikes.   The author never made the connection between the presence of the ruins and the turret, never came to the conclusion that you shouldn't explore them at level 1. He also shows no signs of fight-or-flight reflex, none of his deaths were unfair (well, the turret maybe.) Still, I can't blame him for that: he reminds me of how bad I was when I first dipped my toe in nethack.  But he's right about the UI. Fishing for info is no fun. Given the amount of screen real estate the window on the right takes, it's absurd how little info it can contain. Playing fullscreen, the font is ridiculously big. Stats like quickness, movement speed etc... will remain mystery numbers to many because of their abreviations. And the combat log's format... I have developed the reflex to ctrl-m every time I want to know what just happened."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,themdawngliders,3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:55 2015 UTC,"Do the runes actually stand out as distinct among the proc-gen scenary? Is an N of 2 sufficient when you've literally killed almost 0 mobs and are trying to figure out why you keep swinging with a medallion?  I don't think the game necessarily needs to cater to people not willing to spend some time really learning some of these roguelike aspects, but criticizing the game for it still seems fair. Especially given context. It seems like it takes a reasonable amount of time, but a remarkable lack of action, to meet these unfortunate deaths. That's sort of a problem of start-up overhead if you require several (10s?) of minutes only to die at the first challenge you encounter necessitating the same several minutes of overhead to meet a challenge again."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"The ruins actually stand out. N of 2 should be more than enough to find the equiment screen (standard in any rpg) and find out you're holding the medallion in your off-hand. At worst, it's a matter of pressing F1 for help (and that's the very first thing the game tells you to do, with a pop-up no less) and read a few paragraphs. But gamers don't read text anymore, and apparently neither do game journalists.  He probably lasted less than 5 minutes per character...   That said his review is fair. The experience he describes is what most gamers would experience and that's RPS's audience. I just wish they had an roguelike fan in their crew that could convey his interest to the larger audience. For some genre it's the only way to do reviews... You wouldn't ask someone who dabled with jets in BF4 to write about DCS:Flaming Cliffs (or you'd make the article about the transition and expect the author to play the sim for more than half an hour). The same could said about roguelikes that are often perceived simply as low-budget RPGs."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,themdawngliders,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"They do have roguelike players who seem to have gotten decently far in roguelikes, but the early access reviews are an ongoing series by a single writer.  It's also worth noting this isn't a ""final review"". I believe they can and have given games a proper ""Wot I think"" when they actually release vs early access."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Slogo,8,Tue Jul 21 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not going to make apologies for the reviewer.  Roguelikes - and especially CoQ - go a very different direction than regular games. If you don't want to go through the effort to learn how they work and play them the same way you would approach Fallout 3 you're not going to have a good time.  It reminds me of Windows users who evaluate Linux for the first time and all of their complains come down to things being different.    In an attempt to live a little longer, however, I am forced to grind, killing what appear to be lily pads and other boringly easy prey. Not that this strategy helps: my luck runs out, and I get pincered by a couple of crocs and die, losing all of my meagre, but hard-won, progress.   Things like this show the fundamental misunderstanding of the genre by the author. Sounds like he was trying to play an MMO and the game punished him for playing it wrong.  Edit: I'm not trying to say that improvements shouldn't be made, there's a lot of good ideas in this comment section."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Deathcrow,3,Tue Jul 21 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's the responsibility of the player to understand the genre. The game should understand its genre and teach the player.  If CoQ encourages MMO like behavior by requiring grinding monsters with a very similar setup and town setup then subverts that by mixing permadeath with out of depth monsters it's not a reviewers fault for getting caught in that trap.  Meanwhile if you look at say DCSS, while not perfect, frames the issue much better. The early monsters that are really dangerous are all either slow/melee oriented, look big and threatening (Ogres notably), something that appears within the first 3-5 minutes of playing (including time to create the character), and/or a named unique which offers a clue as to the threatening nature of the game.  On top of that, since DCSS is directed from the start (go down the only path you can) it frames the expected player behavior better. ""A big monster is in my way and keeps killing me, but is always there"" is a good clue you need to learn to pick your fights and run away sometimes because you have no other option.  CoQ offers an open experience, but most of the paths (including the ones the game directs you towards) lead to an early death leaving players confused over what they should be doing. If they go somewhere and it's too tough it's natural to go somewhere else and assume that they just chose then wrong place to go last time. It teaches nothing about being expected to flee battles often. Since it's so open the player may spend a lot time assuming they are dieing because they went to the wrong general direction. So the game never actually teaches them that they are going to the right areas they're just expected to run away sometimes.  Effectively the game is teaching the wrong lesson so it's no surprise when someone doesn't get the right lesson."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Slogo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"The early monsters that are really dangerous are all either slow/melee oriented, look big and threatening (Ogres notably), something that appears within the first 3-5 minutes of playing    Orc wizards/priests, Centaurs and Centaur Warriors, Unseen Horrors, and more I'm surely forgetting. Easy for me, but all of those are common and usually a nightmare for the newer player.   At least when I played, there were also plenty of OOD monsters that were totally random but could completely ruin your day, or uniques that could range from easy to suicide depending on the wand they may or may not have spawned with.    On top of that, since DCSS is directed from the start (go down the only path you can) it frames the expected player behavior better.   DCSS suffers from many of the exact same problems though. Look at dungeon branches: why would any newer player assume that after clearing so many floors in a row that they should almost certainly turn back upon hitting Orc 4, Lair 8, Shoals/Swamp/Spider 5. Or even the end of something like an ice cave. Our that they are not supposed to clear Slime until way later?"
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Polycystic,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"Orc Wizard/Priests teach a different lesson and are only situationally threatening (a MiBe for example can usually just tab through them). Same with Centaurs. You're almost just as likely to encounter one in a situation where you can easily defeat it as you are a dangerous situation where you are supposed to just flat out run.  The other things you mentioned or forgot appear much deeper in the dungeon than the first few levels. If they die to those they've at least experienced a slice of the game and have had time to learn things and grasp basic concepts.  Sure the lair and other branches are bad layout for new players, but by time you get to them you've played enough to understand the game mechanics and concepts. It's not like the first thing you do in the game is enter slime and die.  DCSS pacing is far from perfect, but there's no need for a nirvana fallacy. Just because it's not perfect doesn't mean CoQ is equal in the early game experience or that there's nothing to learn from DCSS. The first 1-3 levels are paced in a way that's pretty good and gives a pretty comfortable way to learn the early game."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Slogo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"Orc Wizard/Priests teach a different lesson and are only situationally threatening (a MiBe for example can usually just tab through them).   Not for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with roguelikes (which seems to be the case with the reviewer). Plus you can see some of those monsters as early as D:2, which seems to be a better comparison to a random early rifle turret in CoQ.  And sure, something like a MiBe is usually able to handle the tougher early threats without much of a problem, even for a newer player, but you could make the same argument in the case of the review:  if he had been playing the CoQ equivalent of a MiBe (high hp, decent armor, plus an 'oh shit' button) likely would have survived...  ...or maybe not. You can see in the log that he only had 3hp left (out of 14...) when he actually encountered the Rifle Turret. Before that he was running from a Two-Headed Slugsnout, and in previous screenshots he was fighting Albino Apes and Electric Snails. All of this at level 1, with low 14 toughness and starting gear. If there's a Crawl equivalent, I'd say it's like diving straight to the lair as a caster, while making a point to not gain any levels."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Polycystic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:23 2015 UTC,"Except the CoQ equal requires a whole ton of options to get right while picking ""fighter"" for any reason that sounds more durable than ""elf"" works for DCSS. And diving to the lair is a lot harder in something like Crawl where you are knowingly descending without having explored your current level vs CoQ giving you a wide open area and hoping you identify what's dangerous and what's not.  Depending on your version of DCSS it does quite well at showing you threats. Webtiles has the handy list of visible monsters coded to show threat level and that's a pretty good way to nudge players towards thinking about the enemies they encounter vs hoping they catch on quickly that they need to look at every monster and see how dangerous it i."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,Slogo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"I think this comes down to linear vs open world, and the struggle to sign-post players correctly in a game that pretends to give them complete freedom of movement.

Webtiles has the handy list of visible monsters   Besides a much smaller font and better auto-explore, this is the feature I'd want to see most. Even if it didn't include a threat level."

roguelikes,3e1hgu,DarrenGrey,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:28 2015 UTC,How true! I feel like if CoQ's early quests were all tuned to be accessible for a lot of builds/characters that would have fixed a lot of problems the reviewer had without restricting veteran players.

roguelikes,3e1hgu,miki151,12,Tue Jul 21 05:59:41 2015 UTC,It's a review by someone who had never played roguelikes before. It's very interesting how even very good roguelikes are seen by a person 'from outside'.
roguelikes,3e1hgu,AlanWithTea,11,Tue Jul 21 07:02:18 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. It's no good just existing in a self-perpetuating roguelike insider loop.
roguelikes,3e1hgu,AlanWithTea,11,Tue Jul 21 07:39:40 2015 UTC,"To expand on this a bit more - we in the roguelike community are so accustomed to navigating games using elaborate keyboard schemes and with minimal presentation that we often don't really notice those things anymore. It's important to be reminded that even roguelikes which are as highly regarded within the community as Caves of Qud can seem offputtingly impenetrable to the uninitiated.   If you're releasing a game on Steam then you're shooting for a wider audience than the roguelike norm, and the way that non-roguelikers respond to things which roguelikers take for granted is going to be important.   I think it was during IRDC that Darren Grey (or maybe someone else?) mentioned that ToME is often considered to be a graphically lavish, visually spectacular game by the roguelike community - but to anyone outside that community, it looks retro and basic, perhaps basic enough to put people off.   The question isn't really whether this review is a 'good' one. It's whether Freehold Games care about what the non-roguelike playing segment of the Steam audience thinks. If they don't care, then they can ignore this review without concern, because the people it's addressing wouldn't be playing Qud anyway. If they do care, then they should take this feedback on board, because this is how Qud comes across to people who don't know roguelikes."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,miki151,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:19:20 2015 UTC,"It's worth keeping in mind though, that there is a trade-off between novice- and expert-friendly UI. You don't hear advanced Nethack players complain much about the UI, because it's actually heavily optimized for them. In Nethack you can reassign your unicorn horn to the letter 's', and type 'n20as' if you want to use it twenty times in a row. Imagine doing the same using a friendly mouse interface.  If you're making a game that's designed to be played for months or years, it's really not that obvious which way you want to go.  Of course you can try to optimize the interface for both novice and expert players, but the months it will take you won't be spent on writing gameplay.  Anyway, what I wanted to say is that it's often a conscious decision by the devs to have this or that type of UI. Of course a lazy dev will always make a horrible UI :)"
roguelikes,3e1hgu,DarrenGrey,2,Tue Jul 21 09:46:47 2015 UTC,"If you don't put the effort into having accessible UI options and you put your game on Steam then you will end up with bad reviews :)  And I don't think there's that much excuse these days. Mouse support is not that hard, and can be helpful for veterans too. ADOM is a long-standing roguelike that managed to design a way more accessible equipment system than Nethack using purely terminal interface. Heck, UnNethack and other variants have designed way better systems than Nethack. I think we need to stop making excuses for bad game design. If designers are forced to innovate they will find better solutions."
roguelikes,3e1hgu,graspee,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:30 2015 UTC,If caves of QUD's interface is offputting to non hardcore rl fans (and I actually don't think it is) then ADOM is going to have them lying on the floor struggling to breathe. -more- ADOM has a lot of really massive UI problems that I'm told there is no money left to fix so won't be fixed before it hits steam. That's going to be interesting to see.
roguelikes,3e1hgu,DarrenGrey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, ADOM is interesting in that they're trying to retcon an old interface, which is never going to work perfectly. Some of the interface problems come down to bad design (why do I need a wipe face command when the mud-blind effect could simply be a timed thing?) The latest versions have had various attempts to clean them up, but it's hard to tell if they go far enough. I'm way too much of a veteran to be able to judge fairly, and I think it's the same for everyone involved in the design.  It might be best for ADOM to do what Qud is doing, going early access to pick up a few sales whilst ironing out the many many issues that are bound to crop up."

This is partly because its verbs are relatively minimal compared to others, but it definitely converted me to a mouse user whenever possible. Fantastically designed and beautiful, get it!  I also highly recommend Cogmind if you have a few bucks to spare. I use mostly mouse in this one (much to the dismay of /u/kyzrati I am sure), and it works really well for a game designed with veteran keyboard users in mind.

But, I'm going to be adding a cool new swap mode that will make even that element superior for kb users who don't like the idea/ergonomics of holding Ctrl-Shift: Press a key to enter swap mode, then as many numbers and letters as you want to shift parts around, then exit the mode. It will of course come with a neat animation :D"
roguelikes,3e27or,Kyzrati,3,Tue Jul 21 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's useful for any control choices you're going to make, but just in case you're interested, here is the current way I play Cogmind:  Right hand: On the mouse. All movement and combat is done here, as well as constant mousing over game objects to inspect them, and inspecting them more closely via right clicking. Some inventory swapping, and enabling/disabling parts that I won't be constantly toggling. Ctrl-click for unequipping and dropping.  Left hand: Left side of keyboard. A and G are used most, as well as Ctrl for dropping. Occasional S to look at my stats (usually to check out my mass). During late game speed builds, this shifts to mostly Ctrl-# to quickly enable and disable different propulsions depending on if I'm casually zipping through or running away from combat, usually because full speed isn't sustainable for long periods of time. I also shift my left hand over to hit ""."" in order to rest up in rooms when I need to cool down heat or recharge energy during this time.  So yeah, I'm kind of a hybrid user for Cogmind (as I'm guessing most mouse-users will be). Hope that's helpful in some way!"
roguelikes,3e27or,livebyfoma,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"That's almost exactly how I do it, when I'm testing hybrid-mouse play anyway (otherwise I prefer pure keyboard). Except that for waiting I would use the mouse wheel (mine has a pretty defined click, so it's quite accurate for that purpose).  Your description does reaffirm how I imagine hybrid input would go. You can play entirely by mouse, but I believe a number of even regular mouse users start migrating to some keyboard use with the left hand to speed up certain actions, ""attach"" being the really big one.  The controls are mostly set, as we've used pretty much all primary keys and combinations. In the future there may be more optional/secondary features accessible via the few punctuation keys that are unused, but nothing major--already spent more than a year working on the UI, time to get back to content!

roguelikes,3e40p9,so--what,6,Tue Jul 21 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"Roguelikes generally centre on a single character (sometimes a small squad, but that doesn't always work well with roguelike pacing), in particular a somewhat rogue-ish (rogue-like?) character. Design often centres around the simulation of a quest or circumstance for said Rogue, which includes obscured knowledge, tactical environments, and many deadly obstacles.  It's a key feature many quoted definitions miss out on, but the active control of an individual is really fundamental to roguelike play. You control that person turn by turn, and so have a strong sense of game flow with how you direct that character. You also control their advancement and their in-game acquired knowledge (exploration, item identification). When they die, that knowledge and advancement is all lost. It's role-playing in a way most other games don't approach.  Civilisation's gameplay focuses on long-term decision making, economic management, simultaneous control of large units and wide areas. These all get in the way of anything like a roguelike experience."
roguelikes,3e40p9,DarrenGrey,4,Tue Jul 21 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"I hate on the Berlin Interpretation as much as the next guy, but it clearly rules out Civ in this case.  First, let's admit it totally fails on the ""low value"" factors:   not single player character (you see the entire explored area of the world map) not focused on tactical challenge to the same degree. IMHO, at least, the tactical stuff is pretty lame not set in a dungeon and no ASCII   OK, so the low value stuff is sometimes silly, but Civ fails the most important high value factors too:   Hack'n'slash You don't kill lots of monsters. And there IS diplomacy among leaders. Permadeath Practically speaking, it's not here. Yea theoretically you could die, but this seems like a rare occurrence. Instead you'll usually just get to the end of the game and be way behind on victory conditions. This is like getting to the bottom of the dungeon and seeing that you didn't collect enough gold to pick up the amulet of yendor and you lose.   Death in Civ isn't anything like death in Rogue."
roguelikes,3e40p9,nluqo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"I see your point but I'd contend that (in addition to roguelikes' focus on one character's journey, as Darren mentioned) the similarities you're spotting go in the other direction. That is, roguelikes have a lot in common with turn-based tactics/strategy games rather than vice versa. It would be both easier and more accurate to say Rogue or Nethack is a turn-based tactics/strategy game than to say Civ is a roguelike.   I can certainly see why you asked though. We learn by asking questions, so don't let anyone shoot you down."

roguelikes,3e02en,efmac,6,Tue Jul 21 04:17:10 2015 UTC,You should take a look at the RL Prospector (though it is quite different from what your planning to make). While the planets can get samey it does have some interesting ideas. The two off the top of my head are unique worlds and unstable worlds.  The unique ones are what it sounds like. Unique planets are places where what is going to be there is already figured out as well as something that doesn't happen anywhere else. A good example is that it has a unique planet which is basically Arrakis from Dune.  The unstable worlds on the other hand are just a regular world. The difference is that they are volcanically active or some other interesting thing. The ones with volcanos are basically slowly tearing themselves apart so mountains and lava flows are randomly popping up on them. The other type I can remember has meteor strikes. While on the planet randomly a meteor will strike causing a ring of mountain tiles with minerals in the center.  Other things to consider is that since you are going with the multiple planet idea then you can justify a number of interesting affects based on the system its in. A tidally locked world where half the map is dark freezing cold and the other is bright scorching hot with maybe a band of okay stuff. Maybe a rogue planet without a sun where there is no light. As long as you include a day night cycle you can even simulate things like a binary star system and other such things.
roguelikes,3e02en,SmellySushi,3,Mon Jul 20 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"Procedurally generated geometric patterns on the land, like crop circles and massive petroglyphs ... Possibly with some in-game explanation (beacons or messages from some alien empire), maybe somehow informative if you can figure out how to decode them, maybe just mysterious and ornamental.  More natural terrain features—rivers, glaciers. Lots of variety in land forms ... Especially since elevations in the ocean are revealed, there could be some interesting atolls, reefs, and trenches, as well as rock formations, hoodoos, plateau, craters, sinkholes, and such on the land.   I'll second varied biomes on a single planet, and also the day-night lighting ... Alien sunrises could have all sorts of crazy colourful lighting effects to go with them.   Occasional active natural disasters? Glowing wildfires, hurricanes .. they could not only look cool and give a sense of a living space, but also be a hazard to the player, giving them a purpose in gameplay as well.  Simulating low cloud cover that moves with a simple wind pattern. Storms that affect visibility, disrupt sensors ... lightning hazards.  Personally, I'm a fan of the apocalyptic, so I'd be very happy to see all sorts of ruins, whether they have in-game functions or not. From abandoned earthworks and ziggurats from abandoned bronze-age settlements to smashed bio-domes and stations from high-tech civilizations to weather-worn statues and monuments."

Like, say, you could choose a jungle, mountain, or coastal plain on one planet, or a savannah, marshlands, and jungle on a different one. Have different types of plants/minerals that only spawn in certain biomes (randomly assigned at generation, of course - it's a roguelike, of course), and stem some sort of crafting system off of that. But of course, the recipes for things would be procedurally generated at start, too."

Just exploring for exploration's sake is really hard to pull off. Noctis IV sort of manages, but it has a 3D first person view going for it."
roguelikes,3e1442,TitanicCak,7,Tue Jul 21 03:43:33 2015 UTC,"Roguelikes are RPGs or games with RPG elements that share a set of common gameplay features, two of which are core to the experience:  Permadeath - Once you die, there's no reloading your save  Randomly generated content - To synergise with permadeath, each play through is unique. Dungeons and monsters will be different, or the items you find will be different, etc.  The game Rogue, written over 30 years ago, discovered that these two gameplay elements work extremely well together. Games that use this concept as a central focus are generally called Roguelikes.  There are stricter definitions and looser interpretations too but it's a big and tedious discussion you want to avoid. Roguelikes have a particular flavour that is easy to intuitively spot once you've played a few different ones.  I recommend starting with Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup."

DCSS has some good tutorials, and a nice tileset that can help ease you into it, and it also features a lot of content, while being relatively easy to get into.  TOME has a super streamlined and modern UI. It has a really cool and intricate combat system, and in depth character building. Brogue also has a very modernized UI, and has beautiful and easy to read ascii graphics, which can help you get into playing classic roguelikes eventually. It is really simplified, and there are no classes or anything like that to distract you, and also no xp to remove things like grinding.  Edit: I forgot about DoomRL, which is a modern roguelike based off of Doom. It can feel a lot faster than other roguelikes, and is really simple to learn how to play and get into."

I LOVE learning about stuff personally and becoming a walking library of games I'm passionate about. I like being able to do that in roguelikes. I like being able to improve myself until I'm good enough to win. That's the charm for me. Everytime I get a little bit further or unlock an achievement (actual in-game achievement or arbitary achievement I set myself as a goal) the rush of satisfaction is immense.

roguelikes,3dx7po,Baji-Naji,4,Mon Jul 20 08:35:48 2015 UTC,"For me, roguelikes have a lot in common with old school arcade games. You die a lot. You restart from scratch (in most arcade games you can continue, but it tends to feel as ""dirty"" as save-scumming in a roguelike). By playing again and again, you learn the rules of the game and how the enemies behave. You devise strategies. You discover ""tricks"". You get better. You get further and further. You get a high score. You beat your previous high score. You get the top score. Then one day the operator resets the arcade machine and it gets erased. Yet the experience you gained as a player remains. And you want to keep playing, because it's so fun, and you know you can do even better :)  I see both arcade games and roguelikes as the anthitesis of the archetypical ""modern videogame"", a (barely) interactive movie, with gameplay always playing second fiddle to the ""story"" the creators want to tell you, and a bunch of artificial, meangliness ""rewards"". Sure, you can enjoy this kind of game if the story is good enough (no easy feat, IMHO), buy they usually have the ""replay value"" of a movie or a book (very little, if any)."

As long as my permadeath demise is something surprising, I don't mind it. If it's something totally expected and predictable and I was just being stupid, then it can be fairly frustrating.  Similarly for exploring a dungeon. I'm driven to go further than before to see what new things will be there, but the process of redoing parts of the dungeon is more enjoyable when they're procedurally generated and often there is some new content that did not get included in previous iterations.  It's like a somewhat different game every time you play. The mechanics are similar enough that you can still improve in skill replay over replay, but the experience changes enough that it's not boring, and there is usually something crazy novel to look forward to."

That's part of my motivation. Either to finally get a win or to get more wins. I'm not good enough at any roguelikes to put ""get an extended-game win"" or ""get a win with an absurd conduct"" on that list.  Besides shooting for a win I like the gradual process of getting comfortable at deeper levels of the dungeon and getting to new content. Until you master the game there's always this new horizon you're peeking at. It ties in with the traditional roguelike development model of continuous evolution, which provides new content and other changes to keep a game fresh indefinitely.   with every death nothing but Sisyphos' work.   Maybe if Zeus is causing your keyboard to play tricks on you! For me, although a death can be frustrating, in the long term I play because I enjoy going from a player who reaches dlevel 3 to a player with a greater, and increasing, average depth."

I like planning but not being able to plan at the same time, manipulating probability  and viability as much as possible, but never getting to be in full control. That lack of inevitable victory is what keeps roguelikes fresh for me even after decades.   I like some other genres for similar reasons, but nothing delivers character/logistic building to me like roguelikes (in video games anyways). In most games, it's just a choice of how I want to beat the game, in many roguelikes, it's a matter of seeing how far I can get, and that keeps me motivated. I rarely am even actually trying to win, I am often just trying to find a bunch of specific item types so I can try something specific with some build. I might do dozens and dozens of runs to get even ONE of the items, or even something remotely close, and I'm happy to keep trying.   Some of my nuttiest adventures blossom from such starts. Most of my actual victories across all roguelikes started as ""test"" runs. basically if I am in the mood for a roguelike, I am never bored with them, I am never not motivated."

Summary of roguelikeness according to the Berlin interpretation, for the purists:   Levels are randomly generated. Regarding permadeath, I'm not sure if you can load a saved game more than once, but it hardly seems sporting. Monsters act in real time. Otherwise, the game is turn-based (I think). Movement is on a traditional discrete square grid. The game is non-modal. It's not a particularly complex game, less so than Rogue, but it certainly isn't obvious what the best strategies and tactics are. Resource management is mostly a matter of watching your weight limit and deciding what to drop. You can ""kill"" monsters by throwing nets at them. You can put them to sleep temporarily with tranquilizer darts. Both of these are in short supply, so expect to run a lot. Monsters ignore each other. There is no identification game, but you'll probably want to canvass each level for food and the artifacts."
roguelikes,3dvb6j,Worthless_Bums,2,Sun Jul 19 20:50:12 2015 UTC,"Mac kid here. Unless this version is different from the Mac Classic version:  Nets trap lions and monkeys. Monkeys can dodge nets. A lot. I can't recall if they can escape nets. Helps to carry around coal so monkeys have something randomly bad to steal. You can also find a, mostly useless, ten foot pole and a tranq gun and tranqs. You can't rely on finding both the tranqs and the gun, and even if you do the gun is rather heavy. Also the tranqs are temporary.  Monsters act turn-based. You can look around as ""free"" actions, but moving in any direction allows animals to act as well.  There is a mummy that spawns and, if it corners you, will kill you unless you have the scarab. You can throw the scarab at the mummy to kill it. IIRC the mummy will spawn on the same level as the scarab, but you might miss finding the scarab which can turn into bad times since the mummy can corner you and touch you to death (technically it shocks you with its touch.)  Going deeper and deeper your biggest problem is hunger/food. You generally wanna dive fast, find at least one artifact, and get out. It's score based so you don't need to find everything, or even anything. You probably won't, depending on what is randomly generated. Gold is heavy and just improves your score. I -think- there were random banks to store found gold and lighten your load?    I spent a lot of time on this silly game."

The permadeath feels tacked onto the game and unfitting, there's no procedural generation and a standard amount of randomization for a RPG, really, and it's unfortunate because it would be pretty good if they dropped the whole ""roguelike"" tag and all that comes with it. I died after a 7 hour long playthrough, most of which was just ""going through the motions"" without any interest or anything new really (I'd already had a 4 hour playthrough before that), because you get to choose between most fights being piss easy and some rare ones difficult (with no real indication of it), to all fights being extremely difficult, so it's designed pretty badly for permadeath.

It got to the point where I just kept running the hardest battles I could with minimal effort so I could end the character properly, and I still couldn't die. Maybe the Wizard is just op."
roguelikes,3dw515,Magnnus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:53:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree wholeheartedly. And respectfully and all that. I would have agreed with you at first, but after I played awhile I realized the story elements are minimal and easily skippable, and the variety in the class creation make it fun to try different builds every run, I changed my mind completely. There is a easy mode in which you can die and keep going. You just don't find quite as much treasure, which isn't even a bad thing. There is almost too much loot sometimes. I beat it eventually, and moved on to whatever that psycho difficulty level was. That was hard, to say the least. lol  edit: and it has one of the best battle systems I've ever seen. Definitely one of the most original."
roguelikes,3dw515,ImUsingTheWrongWords,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:49:38 2015 UTC,The problem with easy mode is that I can't enjoy a game if there's no penalty at all for dying. Even in games without perma death you'll usually have to redo your work from the last checkpoint or whatever. There's incentive not to die; In SRPG there is none. I personally have tried different classes and haven't found the differences between them to be important enough on a strategic level to keep me interested. I feel like the combat COULD be good but as it is it needs to be fleshed out more.  Ultimately I feel like the game could be really good but it falls just short.
roguelikes,3dw515,Shareoff,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"Now here's a question for you. I too was ultimately put off of SanctuaryRPG for very related reasons. But, when it came down to actually initially experiencing the game, would you say it was a worthy experience?  My personal answer is a resounding yes. Without being hooked enough to proceed past Act 2, I consider my money to have been very well spent just for the initial experience of what is an innovative cool game that just happens to be flawed to keep me from wanting to progress further."
roguelikes,3dw515,darkapplepolisher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:43:07 2015 UTC,"I actually agree! I spent around 10 hours on the game and enjoyed the large majority of them. I spent around 3 bucks on the game so I consider it money well spent. Still, I was disappointed about losing interest before getting to finish the game and feeling like it was not quite where it could be. So I think when asked whether it or CoQ is the better game I would certainly recommend CoQ."
roguelikes,3dw515,Shareoff,4,Tue Jul 21 11:54:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you can always try out the free version of Qud and see what you think of that before making your decision. The gameplay is essentially the same as the paid version, so it'll at least give you an idea of how the game plays."

Not to say their game doesn't have redeeming qualities, but the main reason behind its popularity is simply the ridiculous amount of spamming they do in communities all over the web.  And now they've recently opened an indie PR company to charge other devs for access to this ""spam network"" they've built. It's sad."

Among their emails they asked me if I wanted help ""doing PR for XCOM"" (they meant X@COM). Like WTF. I sent them a link to Firaxis.  The Sanctuary thing is in the past, though; they've stopped spamming their own games because they're popular enough already--now they're going for other devs to do the same thing :/.

But that doesn't mean you have to put up with an awful controls/UI and learning curve :( it's just not everyone's thing, and most other popular roguelikes improve on it massively. Games like ToME, DCSS and Brogue keep (especially the latter two) very close bonds to the traditional roguelikes while not.. well, putting you through as much torment. I guess that's all I have to say really."
roguelikes,3duvqj,Shareoff,12,Sun Jul 19 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"Run away from Nethack. There are people who love it, and that's fine, but I think it's far from the best place to go if you're relatively new to roguelikes.   You've actually had a pretty good starting point with Dredmor. I started there too. After that it was DoomRL, Brogue and IVAN, in that order. I never stuck with Brogue but DoomRL is a good option."
roguelikes,3duvqj,AlanWithTea,6,Sun Jul 19 20:31:04 2015 UTC,"I agree - DoomRL and Brogue appealed to me right away as well, although I had the opposite reaction from Alan and it was Brogue that really sucked me in."

roguelikes,3duvqj,AlanWithTea,10,Mon Jul 20 00:46:21 2015 UTC,You don't need to like Nethack. It is actually one of the two main 'old' branches which are somewhat diametrically opposed. I would advise if you want to get into an old school roguelike give Angband a try. Besides that there is also Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup which is quite worth a go. Oh and while it isn't strictly a roguelike you should give Dwarf Fortress a look. The learning curve bends back on itself but it is quite an amazing game so even if you just read some stories about it I think it will be worth you time (Boatmurdered is a good story even if it is from an older 2d version).  Edit: Oh and take a look at Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADoM) another good old fashioned roguelike
roguelikes,3duvqj,akhier,2,Sun Jul 19 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Can't agree more on Dwarf Fortress. Its community isn't huge, but it is great to say the least. The learning curve isn't as scary as it sounds if you are willing to put in some effort, and having previous experience with roguelikes helps ease it as well.  The game itself provides endless possibilities, and there is always something new to learn without it being overwhelming (assuming you managed to climb the initial step). You can play in both Fortress Mode (which is a simulation and management game) and Adventurer Mode, which is basically an open-world Roguelike.   The combat system is one of the best I've ever seen. Each creature's body is defined minutely, and you can do things like cutting apart your opponent's belly, grabbing the guts and tearing them. You can gouge eyes, bite tongues, grab people by their left toe of the right foot and wrestle them. You can tear tendons, arteries and muscles, cause permanent brain damage or otherwise damage any other vital organ (this goes from lungs to, say, pancreas), break bones and even melt the fat inside the body (this happens when a creature is on fire or submerged in magma, for example). You can land gelding strikes.  I have never played a game where my imagination ran so wildly. I love DF."
roguelikes,3duvqj,G3Kappa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, also not only is a creatures body defined but everything is. The game knows your adventurer cut that elf's arm off before the rest of the town murders you and if you go back there you can find said elf and cut his other arm off. After that you can go and kill every intelligent creature in the world and not only does it know you did it but the world goes into a special age to denote that there isn't any such critters.  Self Promotion time, I actually have DF LPs on my YouTube channel. My current thing is I have a world where I managed to get the goblins to be at war with my dwarves. Not that it seems to make them want to attack early any more then usual in the current versions. Here is my channel and Here is a link to the playlist for what is right now my current world which I have had a couple forts in."
roguelikes,3duvqj,akhier,5,Mon Jul 20 05:53:10 2015 UTC,Don't assume that everyone who loves Roguelikes has to enjoy nethack. It's really not for everyone and more modern Roguelikes like DCSS or ToME have improved a lot on the shortcomings of nethack.
roguelikes,3duvqj,Deathcrow,4,Sun Jul 19 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"This is, of course, personal opinion.  You should probably start with DCSS and Brogue. Why? Well DCSS has a lot of content, but it's been ""streamlined"" so much, it's super noob friendly, while mantaining the huge amount of content. Brogue is much simpler (in theory) but has a lot of the neat tricks and interactions between items and enviroment that will eventually help in something like Nethack, or IVAN. And they are obvious enough for you to figure out while playing and then feeling super smart when your crazy plan works.  Hope I was of assistance."

FTL and SotS:TP are a couple of games that I really enjoy. Try The Curious Expedition and Shattered Planet they can also be rather casual or more serious. Another great game that probably shouldn't be mentioned on this subreddit is Drox Operative. It's not a rougelike, or turn based.. but you will find yourself in many situations where you wish death was permanent.. and it's not. Soldak is good at making games like that. I think they are related to rougelikes in the way they setup the maps and quests, but when you screw yourself over you aren't forced to restart, you can play your ruined character in his ruined world still. Honestly I recommend every game they have released."

roguelikes,3duvqj,MyPunsSuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:30:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, lots of hate for NetHack in here. In the end you really don't need to know all that many commands or tricks, and they are generally intuitive once you're thoroughly indoctrinated into the inner logic of the NetHack world. That said, there's an awful lot to learn up-front, and just playing the game isn't enough to learn how to survive.  I wish there was an easier, isolated way to learn all the strategies and knowledge that get you through the game, but I generally had a fun time of it just by always looking up whatever killed me (Or was about to kill me) so I could avoid making the same mistake twice. I only learned the systems and strategies as they became relevant to my skill level (You really don't need to know how touchstones work until you are likely to actually find one...) This way the path from noob to ascension was a matter of gradual progress, and most every run got a little bit further because my skills always improved a little each time. Simply bashing away at the game relentlessly would have left me frustrated and defeated, and I never would have gone very far.  NetHack was my first roguelike, and to some extend it feels like it ruined me for anything else. It's not that other games aren't as hard or fun, just that nothing else is as deep. That said, jumping straight into the deep end may very well have robbed me of many hours of fun playing other roguelikes before getting too attached to the unique features of just one.  So if you are determined to go balls-deep into NetHack, get extremely comfortable with the wiki and guides. Otherwise, ease into wiki-use by playing some of the more intuitive games out there (There are many good suggestions here), and revisit when you're ready to spend more effort for more satisfaction"

roguelikes,3drjoz,ptychomancer,21,Sat Jul 18 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"Boy, I'm glad you asked.  The single biggest inspiration is the pen & paper RPG, Gamma World. It's a 70s D&D derivative set in a mutant-rich waste-scape after a nuclear fallout. I gave a talk about its themes and their influence on Qud at IRDC USA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd31PMVy8XE.  Clearly there's also the collision of ancient culture and far-future technology. That's inspired by books like Dune, Canticle for Leibowitz, The Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe (this is one of my favorite series, though it's more of a retroactive influence since most of Qud's lore was written before I read it), and a lot of pre/co-medieval history: the Mesopotamian city-states, Byzantium, Rome.  The darker mood is influenced by the somber, grave, almost Gothic sword & sandal/sorcery authors like Robert E. Howard (Conan) and Clark Ashton Smith. The cheekier, lighter stuff is more Star Control II.  I love the alien-ness of Morrowind's setting. That was also an influence. ADOM and Dwarf Fortress were the primary roguelike influences.  Two more to throw out there: Ursula K. Le Guin and Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."

It's existed under the covers for a long time, but recently we spruced it up and added the reputation layer. The whole impetus for this update was to prepare for a late game that's more faction-oriented. How exactly this will play out is a work in progress.  So we have this reputation system. Currently, it modifies a faction member's baseline feeling toward you. If you get your Arachnid faction into neutral territory, Arachnids won't aggro you unless they're otherwise angry at you -- if you, say, attack them. Get your rep into positive territory and they'll actively come to your aid in fights. BTW, you can use the Offer Gift power under Persuasion to adjust your rep with a named NPC's factions (careful, you'll lose rep with the factions that hate that NPC -- those descriptions are more than flavor text).  In the future, you can expect specific rewards for high reputation with factions, including followers.

Being in development for so long, how has that underlying tech changed over the years?  Also, thanks for making great games! I really like Sproggiwood, and I'll probably get Qud on my next paycheck. =]"
roguelikes,3drjoz,unormal,12,Sat Jul 18 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"Qud was developed originally as a project to test 'new' features of .NET 2.0 like generics. The old ASCII version was a raw .NET 2.0 app, with interop for the console/opengl.  Sproggiwood took the core game engine of Qud and ran it inside of Unity directly, making some modifications to support a new Unity-based user interface and display mechanism. The actual game-object component system, AI, pathfinding, etc, were all drawn directly from Caves of Qud.  Caves of Qud under unity is a different beast. It was written with a very different paradigm so lots of the UI code blocks in getch() calls, so it would have been a huge effort to actually get it running 'correctly' in Unity.  What I ended up doing is essentially running the entire game in a second thread. The main Unity thread presents the user interface and collects input, feeding it into the old keyboard/console facade I had already in place. So most of Unity Qud doesn't have any clue that it's running under Unity, it's using it's same old console and keyboard interface and the Unity main thread is sucking up the output to display and jamming in input it gets.  I did a presentation on the early development of the engine at IRDC US a couple months ago, which you might find interesting (along with all the other IRDC presentations!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U03XXzcThGU"

In addition none of the profiling is aware of anything outside of the main thread. It's pretty awful, really."

roguelikes,3drjoz,FascismIsMagic,7,Sun Jul 19 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"The main issue with Sproggiwood was that my component system was so similar to Unity's that we had a huge amount of naming conflict for things (GameObjects, etc) I had essentially co-evolved an almost identical component object model. They were developed around the same era, from the same sources, you can watch the IRDC presentation below, I talk about some of them.  A core issue with Qud was garbage collection. Qud is very very very awful inside. .NET's garbage collector was completely fine with it, but the ancient version of the mono collector that Untiy uses completely shit the bed when I tried to run Qud on it (after working out the basic I/O system).  It took two weeks of huge refactors to clean up all the generation 0 trash (mostly string allocations) I was generating that would cause huge frame-rate hitches constantly."

And those'll have to be populated with new monsters, NPCs, and items, of course.   We also want the late-game to be more faction-oriented, so we're building out the faction reputation system. This'll include faction-specific encounters, rewards for high reputation with factions, and penalties for especially low reputations (by the way, you can use the Offer Gift power under Persuasion to sway the opinion of named NPCs -- this'll become more important soon).  There's a hefty backlog of neat ideas that we'll also be implementing as they strike our fancy: things like tweaking the Tinkering system, adjusting the skill balance, adding aawweesome storied items, and.... maybe an infinite library of procedural books.

For Sproggiwood I used ex2D, Spriter and a UI system that I wrote from scratch myself, because Unity UI didn't exist at the time I started Sproggiwood's prototypes (3+ years ago).  Nowadays Unity's UI system is quite adequate. 2D animation and modelling would depend on if we were going for boned or static sprites. Because I have so much invested in a custom ex2D implementation, I might use that, but if I didn't have that available, I'd probably simply use Unity's existing 2D pipeline, which is kind of janky (like most Unity stuff), but works, and at least your problems would also be everyone else's problems.  I'm not much of an expert in 3D, so I can't really give an expert opinion there."

I also wonder what your philosophy on protecting the player from doing dumb shit, Rogue-likes are tough by design but sometimes the player can do things like accidentally disassemble the kick ass laser rifle they were just handed instead of examining it. Would you consider adding stuff like (optional) query on disassemble, warnings that their grenade is going to hit them etc? Or do you think it should be up to the player to not do stupid shit?

A setting's resonance is really a function of how it distorts real history in authentic ways. If you want to write for an ancient world with kings/queens, empires, re-purposed ruins, etc, you really should read all the great literature on Rome. Start with Gibbon and the fantastic podcast The History of Rome by Mike Duncan. I also suggest the Byzantium trilogy by John Julius Norwich.

There are a few buttons that can't be remapped, like pushing + to add something into a chest which specifically looks for the + on the 10-key and doesn't have a remap option. Is this something on your radar?"

FTL is the only roguelike I've ever gotten good at, because I didn't know you could pause it and give orders.

roguelikes,3drjoz,TuxedoMarty,5,Sat Jul 18 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"Necrodancer and Shattered Planet, recently.  I like bizarre and arty games. I can always count on an www.increpare.com game to make me say, ""uh?"" I played through some of Porpentine's Eczema Angel Orifice collection with a friend recently. I like to be exposed to designers with wildly different perspectives from my own.  I liked Her Story. I haven't had the chance to play Cogmind yet, but it looks gorgeous. I pay close attention to URR by Mark Johnson, both because it's awesome and because he's some sort of British clone of me (roguelike dev, obsessed with Borges, even played poker professionally in the exact same timeframe as me, 2008-2011)."
roguelikes,3drjoz,unormal,3,Sat Jul 18 22:05:23 2015 UTC,"Recently I've been playing non-roguelike stuff, though I've played a good amount of Crypt of the Necrodancer lately, which is (as everyone knows) brilliant. I like big Elder-Scrolls style RPGs probably more than Rougelikes, even, and I recently finished Witcher 2 and Shadow of Mordor. I didn't like most of Witcher 2's game design, I just wanted to play through it before W3. Shadow of Mordor was really shockingly good, and had a lot of emergent, procedural elements that were really surprising to see in a AAA game, and well executed. I'd really recommend it!  A couple of my other favorite recentish playthroughs: Legend of Grimrock, the Fallout New Vegas DLC, Alien: Isolation, Endless Legends.  I tend to like and play all the big box AAA stuff, and Jason tends to like the smaller, more experimental games."

roguelikes,3drjoz,BloodyThorn,3,Sat Jul 18 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really enjoy Amplitude's stuff. Their world building is great, and their game design seems to try to push boundaries without compromising the comfort-food basic game-play elements, and largely succeeds."

roguelikes,3drjoz,BloodyThorn,5,Sat Jul 18 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, somehow I got the date mixed up on this and now I am late to the game. My question might not get answered so I'll make it as short as possible.  I find the effects of the use of your component/entity system in Qud very intriguing. I've been poking at entity systems for a while and I have noticed that most pre-made entity systems like Artemis and EntityX use built in delta systems for physics-based application and don't seem to be specifically catered to a turn-based use.  As an aspiring developer, can you give any good code examples(blogs, repos, etc) that either you've made, or the ones that inspired you to create such a robust entity representation system? Any specifics that you can give would be greatly appreciated.  I guess I am still new enough to mid-level programming where the Entity approach seems baffling in it's application, while it's results astound me regularly."
roguelikes,3drjoz,unormal,6,Sun Jul 19 01:09:33 2015 UTC,"If your'e just getting to the point where you're going from functions to ""oh god whole systems"", having to take a bunch of runs at it before you really get it right is perfectly normal. You tend to get partway down the path, realize something has gone horribly wrong, and have to back up and try again.  It takes a long time before you can effortlessly ""zoom"" between different levels of system abstraction to get a design to not be a horrible mess. I'm still working on it after 20+ years.  This book is a really excellent first step on the path from ""Ok objects make sense"" to ""Stringing systems together"": http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/"
roguelikes,3drjoz,BloodyThorn,3,Sat Jul 18 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response and the link. Yeah, that book is my bible right now. I am currently implementing most of it in my own version of a roguelike tile engine which is mostly just a learning project. Anyone who is going into game development and hasn't found that book after they've achieved basic competency with their chosen language has to be living in a box.  Honestly my grasp of my chosen language, and OOP are all tickety-boo. I'm still a little fuzzy sometimes with template metaprogramming, but otherwise, I can deal with most things C++. Patterns and systems are my main focus right now.  My grasp of tying systems together has gotten much better, and like I said, I am currently working on a display engine, that is very similar to the one you use in Qud (discrete text/tile based) to house a console application that will be used in further projects, written with SFML.  However all the systems that I have implemented so far are game engine systems. Display, callbacks for events, a meticulously timed loop, a state manager for changing to an arbitrary number of instruction states. I just got done implementing the Observer Pattern from the book you mentioned and I now have the basics of an event/communications system in it.  As I slowly tick these off my list one at a time, my mind turns to contemplating data models and VMs to control it with and a way to actually make my game model 'work' rather than just stuff it needs to be worked.  I'm conceptually starting to have an idea of how I want to put things together, and I suppose I am starting to grasp how a component system is supposed to fit in to all that. However so far my general research into entity engines doesn't give very many good examples of it being used in a turn-by-turn based system. The most I can find are questions on stack exchange where the main answer is, ""Looks like you're searching for a problem for a solution. You need to wait until you know you have a need for it."" kinda responses.  Of course this doesn't really help if you just want to become familiar with the pattern and its uses in the situation you've admired it in. I'm sure as a coder you know how far similar implementations go to help you understand how something works.  Anyway, thanks again for the response. Qud is an amazing game. Purchased it on Steam day one. I haven't played Sproggiwood yet, but it's on the wishlist. I'll probably pick it up when I am a slightly less broke student."
roguelikes,3drjoz,unormal,4,Sat Jul 18 22:35:32 2015 UTC,"I think those stack exchange responses are probably right. Getting good requirements is really the core issue of engineering. What kind of game you're making, with what constraints, in what environment, with what pre-existing conditions... Those questions I don't really see answered anywhere. Is it roguelikes? Action games? Something else altogether?  There's no single answer to any of these questions, any of these problems can be solved innumberable ways, with different tradeoffs, and the big question I guess I have at this point is ""What game are you making?"""
roguelikes,3drjoz,BloodyThorn,4,Sun Jul 19 00:03:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, as I said above, I'm not really making a game, rather than learning the technologies to do so. I know this is probably a rare stance to talk to someone in, someone who isn't making a specific game, knowing exactly what they want in it. I've read enough message boards to know your typical aspiring game dev is someone who has a vision and only wants to know how to visualize it.  I don't. I'm trying to learn the Entity/Component system when based around a turn based game, and not a physics based one. Possibly learning enough about them to handrole my own entity engine for my purposes.  So the stack exchange answers, while right in that situation, are literally no help to my situation, learning the technology. It's really hard to know you need a tool when you aren't completely familiar with it. I know what it's for, I'm not trying to build a house with it, I'm trying to learn about it and it alone. And I know someone has to drive nails to learn how to use a hammer, but what we're talking about is a bit more complex.  Since I have already made a tile display very similar to the one you use in Qud, I'd say if I were to make a game as of now, I'd want it to be a roguelike, hence the 'turn-based' bias.  Your first response was fine I suppose. I'll just continue to read the random and scattered posts on Entity/Component Systems around the internet, exam the ones I can find implementations of and poke around their code, and poke around with them myself. From what I guessed from watching your IRDC talk, I took away that you developed yours in a similar fashion.  I was just hoping now that they've gained a bit more momentum, I'd be able to do more looking at examples and less re-inventing the wheel. I really admire the effect to which it is used in Qud.  Thanks for your time.  Oh yeah, I noticed you mentioned in your talk that you based Qud in part, off of TSR's Gamma World. It makes sense as to why I love your mutant system so much. I mentioned I was a student so you probably think I am a kid, but I grew up with 1st edition TSR games. Gamma World, Top Secret, some of my best times as a kid. Of course I also grew up with early computer games, which explains my predilection to roguelikes.  Keep up the good work."
roguelikes,3drjoz,unormal,5,Sun Jul 19 00:10:39 2015 UTC,"It's totally completely fine to not really want to make a game as a goal, but instead learn the technology.  HOWEVER, that said, I think the reason you're struggling with some of the questions you are is because you don't have a concrete game as an end goal; 'engine' isn't enough. Even if your goal is to simply learn to build an engine, which is perfectly fine, you still need a very concrete goal in mind in terms of what kind of game your engine is going to support, otherwise there's no real way to even ask the right questions about the choices you're making.  Honestly, if you want to learn component-entity coding in general, I'd suggest you take a look at Unity and essentially any project built with it. Unity uses an almost identical model to Caves of Qud (and really any Component-Entity system), and is by far the most numerous in terms of public examples. Some projects are going to use it better, some worse, but they'll all reveal something about how to put a component-based system to work.  It's also a really nice engine for writing components, wiring them up, and seeing how they work together interactively. You just build the objects you want in the editor, hit play, and you're off to the races."
roguelikes,3drjoz,rehsarht,4,Sun Jul 19 01:41:40 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with Unity. I've already built a game, or at least the beginnings of a game in it for a game programming class I took my sophomore year. A roguelike, 3D, third-person, using Prim's to generate the mazes, and Qubicle for the graphic assets. I took 2D tiles and turned them into a 3D representation of a low-res tile-based roguelike similar to Crawl. I think I even used Stone Soup's wall tile.  It was my first experience with a component system that pretty much put me on this course. I had it all the way to a queue based action system and things moving around and attacking things, even though I only had one monster. Heh.  My experience in Unity wasn't great though. I know enough C# to get by, by I'm more proficient in C++. It's more of a professional choice determined by the field I want to go into assuming the game programming thing doesn't pan out. And like every college course my partner ditched me without doing a lick of work.  And while I don't have a concrete idea of what game I want to make, I do have 'along those lines'. So I have a list of games that bear similar features to those I'd like to use, like yours, and I've made lists of those technologies, and I've been learning as much as I can until I have the time to dedicate to a serious project.  My first game with an end goal will probably be a roguelike. However, I'll have well less dead-ends if I know what there is out there to work with, how to use it, by both the theory behind it and learning how it is used. Then when I find I know exactly what I want, I'll have experience with a list of tools to draw from for the right fit.  I didn't have to noodle with the Bytecode Pattern to figure it out. There's a billion different implementations to choose from on the internet. I just had to noodle around with it to make it fit where I wanted it. I also didn't really need to know exactly what I needed it for to learn it. I just new it was something I wanted, and probably needed to learn.  Besides, there's no use starting anything 'concrete' until I have the time really. School still keeps me too busy for regular dedication to anything but learning projects. Going to college when you're middle aged isn't easy, unfortunately."

(I am also one of the people who nudged /u/PlayDungeonmans in a direction such that that game has a ""Who cares??"" option on its gender screen, so uh. These things tend to intrigue and delight me. <3)"
roguelikes,3drjoz,unormal,3,Sat Jul 18 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"A large amount of stuff. Most of the core systems were designed by us as very, very fledgling game designers 8-10 years ago, and we would do a lot of stuff more or less differently after a decade of experience.  I think my key complaint is that I'd love to have a much more interactive mostly non-bump-attack combat system, more like Sproggiwood's. However the ramifications of that lead to essentially an entirely new game, so I think we're largely stuck with Qud's basic combat system. It's adequate, but certainly would be very different if we started from scratch today.  We actually have some nascent game designs around a Qud-world roguelike that lands somewhere in between Qud's grognardy complexity and Sproggiwood's very sparse combat-oriented playstyle.  We have a lot of ideas, and so little time, it's our core dilemma. (and really everyone's, right?)"

roguelikes,3ds59d,Silver-Monk_Shu,4,Sat Jul 18 22:54:48 2015 UTC,There's Cataclysm - Dark Days Ahead. Not a fan but it's mostly about survival. As in keeping yourself alive. I guess.

roguelikes,3ds59d,Magnnus,4,Sun Jul 19 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"I played Cataclysm a whole bunch for about a month or so. Once you get the relative hang of things (combat, survival, speed stats and such) it's actually fairly simple. I'd personally consider Unreal World more complex, but that's just me."
roguelikes,3ds59d,ButterBuckets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"Cataclysm isn't 'complex' but it is difficult. There is a lot of crafting and such but in the end most things aren't too many layers deep (as of the last time I played) and you can find a lot of good stuff just lying around and the better stuff is in 'dungeons' and such. Difficulty comes from your skills and how strategic you are in combat. The biggest draw for the OP would be that you can turn off all the really freaky stuff and have just zombies and then you can treat it almost like a 2d roguelike version of Minecraft. Build a house in the middle of a forest, build a giant rolling death machine that is powered by plasma, Retrofit a school into your own castle while you slowly clear a nearby town. In the end though noting the preference for Elona and the fact that Unreal World just doesn't fit this probably will fall more on the UW side of things."

roguelikes,3ds59d,IAMADonaldTrump,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:47 2015 UTC,"I can only think of two off the top of my head:   The first is Wayward, which might be too survival-oriented. There's fishing and other crafting mechanics, and it honestly feels a bit like Runescape got bundled into a single player roguelike due to the fact that there's a huge number of life skills you can level.  The second is a Japanese JRPG known as 巡り廻る. It's got quite a lot of stuff, but it's entirely untranslated, so you'll need to know Japanese to get into it. It's along the same lines as Elona, where there's a storyline you can ignore entirely, life-sim mechanics (eventually becoming kingdom management -- but dungeon crawling's never too far away). Full disclosure: I've spent >200 hours into that game.   EDIT: I should also mention that both of these games are free. Wayward's playable in your browser... here, and 巡り廻る is downloadable here   EDIT2: Whoops spelling."
roguelikes,3ds59d,ordineu,2,Sat Jul 18 23:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for wayward, can I ask you.  Does the game reach a point to where I'm not constantly paranoid, and I could just really focus on something specific that makes my playthrough different from other people?  Or does every wayward session play out really similar in terms of what you prioritize and how you should survive?  Is there a ""right"" way to playing the game.  Also just googled the japanese game, I can work on an english patch if I find a translator.  edit:  wait.. fully read your post and noticed you played it.  Want to work on an english patch?"
roguelikes,3ds59d,ordineu,3,Sat Jul 18 23:23:00 2015 UTC,"For Wayward: I've only beaten it twice, and both ways were pretty similar. Started off my leveling tactics, then transitioning into building a nice looking base, then enchanting and finding treasure. I know you can probably try focusing just on building bases (by digging or building wooden walls or what have you) but enemies start ramping up in difficulty pretty quickly, so I've never been successful at it.   For 巡り, I'd be down on working on an english patch if you are. I gotta warn you, there's a loooot of stuff. I'm also not very good at Japanese (probably couldn't pass JLPT 2), but that's what dictionaries are for. PM me if you're interested."

If you love building this game is for you, also haves a lot of fighting and the survival aspect is kinda hard, when the game drags too long the enemies are more stronger each time."
roguelikes,3ds59d,RJAG,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"Neo Scavenger is my favorite roguelike/roguelite/survival game.  Post-Apocalyptic. Great combat IMO (story based / turn based - way better combat IMO but many people say they dislike the combat).  In fact, it is one of my favorite GAMES of all time.  If it seems too hardcore, just pick up the trait: TRAPPING. (Don't take this if you want it to be difficult. This makes the game EZ mode IMO because it makes finding fire, light, and food extremely easy.)    TINY SPOILER ALERT BELOW - NON-STORY - JUST MENTION OF A SINGLE SKILL - But related to making the game only slightly less hardcore.      A less EZ-Mode, more balanced (but still powerful) trait is: BOTANY. This allows you to scrape some leftover food (but not enough to unbalance the game like TRAPPING) and you still have to fend for Fire/Light yourself. However, you can make Bark Tea which sells really well (you still have to do a TON of hard work.) and helps with digestive diseases (which are too common if you don't use Trapping or get lucky with certain items)."

roguelikes,3drgzr,phalp,2,Sun Jul 19 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"Agree. I already picked one nit and I think if a person is trying to appeal to the non hardcore-roguelikers animations are a must, so I wasn't going to mention it, but animations are a big negative for me. Animations with the purpose of clarifying the action are one thing, as long as they're fast, but in a turn-based game I want to spend my time deciding what to do, not waiting to find out what the new situation is. It's better if you can press a key to interrupt the animation, but still I'd rather instant updates than sluggish. That extends to fast-travel and auto-explore too. One of my big annoyances with Brogue is that you have to wait while your character trots along. At least running with the shift key is instant!"
roguelikes,3drgzr,phalp,2,Sun Jul 19 00:02:39 2015 UTC,That was one thing I didn't like about Dungeons of Dredmor -- it took forever to go anywhere.
roguelikes,3drgzr,AlanWithTea,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:29:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I like seeing my character auto-explore so I can quickly take in the layout of the area a little beyond what the map is going to show me, like, just get a feel for things, and also to be able to terminate it in some cases. It still has to be pretty fast, though. I guess it's a little too slow for me in Brogue and I don't generally use it, but in ToME it's just right for me.  I otherwise really agree, though."
roguelikes,3drgzr,Shareoff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:36:08 2015 UTC,"The thing I do like about Brogue's auto-explore is that rather than exploring until something interesting happens, it just selects a nearby unexplored destination for fast travel/autopilot/whatever you call it. I think this is new in the latest version. Helps keep a handle on things, and you don't have to worry about if auto-explore is going to take you somewhere bone-headed without warning."
roguelikes,3drgzr,AlanWithTea,3,Sun Jul 19 06:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'm doing this because I really like the roguelike genre but even StoneSoup, being the most accessible Roguelike out there, for me it's just too difficult to actually play. I have reached level 10 once. Sure I'm not That dedicated but redoing those first levels over and over again to ... maybe... acess to the next ""level"" is just too much.   Fair enough, you like what you like, but is it necessary to cast this as a lack of ""modernization""? DCSS is an actively developed and constantly evolving game. A game isn't archaic just because you find its design philosophy unfamiliar. (A lack of mouse support is another story.)"
roguelikes,3drgzr,phalp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:24:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I think in many ways DCSS still retains quite a traditional roguelike interface. It's better than many but still quite awkward."
roguelikes,3drgzr,AlanWithTea,3,Sat Jul 18 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"So what about ToME, or Brogue? They both have a more innovative, less traditional interface (in my opinion), are very accessible, but his argument wasn't referring to interface at all, but rather to difficulty. (and I mean ToME is I think considered easier, but I think it'd be off limits for this guy...)  Personally I'm not sure how you could ""modernize"" roguelikes in such a way that you won't have to repeat things and learn from them anymore. I kind of feel like that loses its essence. I'm not sure exactly what he means to say when he says a sentence like that, and then says ""I really like the roguelike genre"", and I ask myself what exactly does he like about roguelikes? Because player-driven progression is obviously not it, the difficulty is not it, the high replayability is... also not it it seems. It just doesn't make sense to me.  Maybe a checkpoint system of some sort...."
roguelikes,3drgzr,phalp,2,Sun Jul 19 05:25:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, ToME is a good example of 'modernised' in that sense.   I suppose the only way to find out what is meant by 'modernised' here is to play the game!"

Sorry if I made you think I'm going to ""modernize"" the genre, obviously I'm only talking about accessibility/ease of use, not making the genre itself a New Better Genre (tm). I'm not good with words sometimes.  That said, I'm of course trying to put my mark on it and we'll see if that's good or bad.  To all of you wanting to check out the game, I'll send you a key and some basic information, probably tomorrow (there's a heatwave here and I'm stuck with my kids so it's pooltime all day long :-/).  Also, yes, Dungeons of dreadful movement! Obviously I have to think about that. I'm putting skipping animations on the todo list. Maybe Heroes 3-like (a parameter: slow,medium,fast,instant).  I have been thinking about the auto explore command but with my Schrödinger map generation, there is a (technically) infinite map, and I prefer having 'stuff happen' really often (on most of the map parts added by the algorithm), so I will try to make an ""auto-get-back"" algorithm instead, moving you back to the last intersection when you hit a dead end or finished cleaning some sub-part of the dungeon.  But if a lot of people think an auto explore (which intersection will it take?) is a must, I'll try to figure out one.  Again, thanks for your valuable input, it really helps!"
roguelikes,3drgzr,FatesBind,2,Sun Jul 19 09:25:34 2015 UTC,"Just something to add about the auto-explore feature: I don't think that it is a good idea to implement one, I'd rather like to have a much denser dungeon where I don't have to travel/backtrack a lot. I have mixed fealings about an upgradeable meta-game (the town), but since you are going for the more casual player I think you should go for it. edit: found this nice article that is about the point of the auto-explore feature, give it a read: http://www.gamesofgrey.com/blog/?p=201"

I can do that with my algo but sometimes you'll hit a dead end (again, with my algo), so then it could be neat, IMO, to have an 'auto-travel back to last intersection'.  About the town, I think I will go with it, but I'm also open to ideas. My base idea was some sort of checkpoints; if you reach a certain level, you can start there the next run (like an 'unlock').  Now I have shopkeepers you can upgrade all the time. Maybe I should lower their influence and stick more with the 'unlock'. Well, time will tell :-)"

I probably wrestled with it for about a week, tops. Seeing the game's visuals on youtube just wasn't really enough. I had to see it up close.

Well, here we go:   The way it's built it should (and does from what I hear from the many Linux/Mac players) work flawlessly in Wine on both Linux and OSX once it's set up properly (instructions for the latter are on the forums).   I had no problem getting it running on wine. I already have most of the MS distributables installed because... well this isn't my first rodeo. The problem is, first, your game bases its resolution off my detected display. However it detects the wrong display to do this from.  Most people this wouldn't be a problem, but I use a multi-monitor desktop with different sized monitors. Not because I am some l33t haxor or anything, I'm poor and some of my monitors are old. But your game in particular chooses my monitor that's 1280x1024(yes 5:4!) to initialize itself on, which means even if I drag the window over to my 1920x1080 display, it remains in its already determined 5:4 aspect, and nothing I can do in the settings you give me to change the size of the  window will remedy that.  Of course I am fully aware that often the problems I have deal with the uniqueness of my setup. Sure most people say your game works flawlessly in Linux, how many of them use i3wm? How many of them have more than one monitor that have different dimensions?  In Windows I have no problems with it, as it boots up to the right screen, auto-detects the aspect ratio and all is good. I have the entire gambit of options to set the character size, and the matrix size in my 16:9 format.  In Linux I experience these problems all the time. I typically take a half-assed stab at trying to correct the problem, like I could disable my display, or switch to a temporary and more popular WM. Sometimes I'll get things working great because I a familiar with the issue.  In this case and my second issue, something is set in the game based off the resolution of the monitor it detects that limits my choices in setting font/size and matrix size. So other than tricking it to start up on the correct monitor by disabling a display, my choice is to play it in a small square box on my huge ass monitor. Or boot in to Windows, like I have to do to satiate my game lust most of the time anyway.  So yeah, it doesn't work flawlessly in wine for everyone so you can probably retire that to 'almost everyone'. But if I was its developer, I'd probably consider this a minor issue. I'm sure the options for changing the geometry of the screen were made the way they were with good reason.  I'm long winded so:  TLDR; Starts up on the wrong display, auto-detects resolution settings from that display, and limits my capability of re-configuring it so that none of this matters.  The Monitor issue is mine and mine alone. However the inability to correct for it in the game settings I believe is yours. This isn't the only game it does this to, and most of them I just go in, reconfigure the resolution and I am done with it. At least it doesn't do like most games and detect my entire monitor setup as the total resolution and start up in 3200x1534. The most common issue I have.  PS: BTW, it's a great game. The tile display engine you wrote is really boss. I'm currently making a very similar tile engine in C++/SFML and when it comes to roguelike tile display engines, I think you get the blue ribbon. And sorry about the novel."
roguelikes,3doxfz,BloodyThorn,2,Sat Jul 18 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"Then some concerned developer comes along and asks me specifics. Well, here we go:   Wow, thank you for the novel :).   Interesting that it detects your primary display in Windows but not in Linux; I hadn't heard from anyone with this setup.   The Monitor issue is mine and mine alone. However the inability to correct for it in the game settings I believe is yours.   SDL (the version I'm using) can't handle multiple monitors, so I can't do anything about that :/. Things like monitor handling and scaling would be easier if I were using the graphics card, but I'm not--it's entirely handled by the OS and software-mode draw calls, which is why the game runs entirely off the CPU.  The main way to resolve this issue--allowing more dynamic resizing within the program--doesn't work on Windows, either, so I wouldn't really consider this a Wine-only problem (except the detection part, which is odd and I have no idea why Wine would do that--maybe there's a separate setting for primary monitor?).  In any case, the plan for the Linux version will be to use a proper wrapper, which would hopefully be able to solve your specific issue.   PS: BTW, it's a great game. The tile display engine you wrote is really boss. I'm currently making a very similar tile engine in C++/SFML and when it comes to roguelike tile display engines, I think you get the blue ribbon.   Thanks, I originally got the underlying tile display idea from libtcod, though mine is slower than that (by 30% or more!) as it uses C++ and a completely different method of layering grid cells to support multiple fonts and partial overlapping of subconsoles."
roguelikes,3doxfz,Kyzrati,2,Sun Jul 19 01:14:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting that it detects your primary display in Windows but not in Linux   And if you've ever dealt with Nvidia drivers in Linux you'd understand why I don't just change my primary monitor. I could always just switch around the plugs I suppose. It's just so much easier to dual boot right now, and when I am out of school, I'll just grab a dedicated game machine and a dedicated development machine. Doing it for one game is a bit counter productive.   ... --doesn't work on Windows, either, so I wouldn't really consider this a Wine-only problem   This is actually kinda strange. When Sami switched to SDL2 in Unreal World it gave me the option to now dynamically resize the game window in both Windows and Linux. It just auto-scales the image. My tile display does the same in SFML in Linux, I haven't gotten around to building it in Windows though.   I originally got the underlying tile display idea from libtcod ...   Same. Though once I started using SFML, and actually got above the beginning level at coding, I found that it shouldn't really be too hard to build a basic one in SFML. I had to do a bit of magic to get it to work quickly, things like drawing from a pre-rendered image, updating the image during the logic update, and only re-drawing changed tiles, but I'm kinda happy with it. Though I am sure libtcod is well better, as I am still learning. But the point is learning, so hey.  Other than the fact that yours looks about a billion times cleaner than mine, what really gets me are the effects. The screen static, corruption effects. Masterful. Of course I probably think this because I am a noob. :P"

My tile display does the same in SFML in Linux, I haven't gotten around to building it in Windows though.   That's because I still use SDL1! Been using it for a decade... I looked into switching to SDL2 at one point, but back then it still wasn't stable enough, and on more recent examination porting would require quite a lot of work, and may even be incompatible with some major features as I've implemented them (most specifically the sprawling input handler).  It's not impossible that I'd switch one day, but I really don't want to take tons of time out from working on the game itself to screwing with the engine again, not when most everything works pretty nicely already.   Same. Though once I started using SFML, and actually got above the beginning level at coding, I found that it shouldn't really be too hard to build a basic one in SFML.   Yeah, it only took about two weeks to build the engine (plus of course the occasional updates, optimizations, and feature enhancements later on).  The effects can be done with any tile renderer--libtcod, or even your own--that's not even built into the engine itself, but a separate particle system in only a couple thousand lines of code that can output to any grid. In fact, the original version was tested through libtcod itself :P"
roguelikes,3doxfz,Kyzrati,2,Sun Jul 19 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"but a separate particle system   I suspected. The only experience I've had with particle systems just yet is I updated the SFML tutorial on particle systems from the old version to the newer build of SFML on their github.  I've been thinking about those, and animation systems for things like cursor blinks or simulated scrolling or fade in (another thing your game does spectacularly well). But I've really not put anything in code yet. Though I'm getting close.  I'm also trying to keep as much of my code as I can decoupled from SFML in case there's ever a compelling argument to switch to something else. I'm a pessimist, but sometimes it comes in handy."

I've got hundreds of great quotes from happy players, but it would be overkill to put them all online =p  Over 1,000 players have supported the game so far, and of them only one has said he thought the game wasn't worth $30 yet. (Though he didn't indicate why, and apparently only played for a few minutes :/) There are a growing number of LPs on YouTube that show what the game is about, and a big YouTuber is looking to pick it up next week.  /u/Glutnix: Honestly, if you're on the fence about it, I'd say don't buy. At this stage I'm only looking for players who are really into the genre and want to see this roguelike be the best it can be (the strong support so far has already convinced me to expand the budget to at least $70k--basically, more revenue = bigger better game). Everyone else can just wait until it's on Steam/GOG and get it for the lower price. (Also, a number of people are joining groups to buy packages of 3 to get it at $20 each, which is a good bit less.)

It was easier for me to pay 30$ because I've been following the game sinxe the 7drl version. I knew what I was buying and how much time had been put on the game."

Other games of the genre are usually closer to 5-15$   This is true, though at the same time Cogmind has many things that no other game does, including for example a heavy investment in sfx that's probably a first for an indie game. Most such games have a handful to maybe a couple hundred sound samples--Cogmind will break 1,000 before it's done. (Ben Prunty, the composer for FTL, was raving about Cogmind's sound design yesterday on Twitter--that was awesome =p)  Right now it's the ""crowdfunding to support development"" price for long-time enthusiasts who want an even better game, while later it will be more about better fitting into the market.

Regarding your initial question: The quicker you can learn from mistakes, the quicker you'll be able to beat a roguelike without looking up guides. Using ToME as an example: there's a quest/area/boss themed around an lightning and ""surprise!"" the boss does a ton of lightning damage. Get lightning resist and he's simple. To 'learn from' the mistake of him killing you, just check your combat log and see that the damage he did to you was all lightning damage."

roguelikes,3do5he,Arcsech,9,Sun Jul 19 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't beaten either of these, but:  1) Brogue is pretty straightforward and will feel very familiar if you've played Nethack.  It does have item identification, but it also has a pretty extensive and easy-to-use in-game help system that will tell you all about each item and monster and what they do.  It's also by far the best-looking free ASCII roguelike (Cogmind beats it I think, but that's its only real competition).  This is probably your best bet if you want something that feels a lot like Nethack, but without the ultra-obscure aspects.  2) DoomRL (a roguelike based on the old FPS Doom) is very straightforward - there's a pretty limited selection of weapons and enemies compared to other games, and there's no item identification.  Some experience in Doom will help, just to know what the enemies are, but even that's not really necessary.  This one is definitely a different style of roguelike, but definitely fun.  Neither of these need any particular endgame kit, although obviously some items are better than others, and will be playable with a minimum of wiki-reading."
roguelikes,3do5he,Arseface_TM,3,Fri Jul 17 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"Brogue is probably the best traditional style roguelike in terms of not needing spoilers.  DoomRL's crafting system benefits a fair bit from spoilers. Not necessary by any means, but it helps. Still words better than something like Nethack.  Sil has a good tutorial and manual, and is also relatively beatable without spoilers thanks to some auto-identification skills. You mentioned Angband variants so I figured I'd throw that in here too.  If you want to get further away from traditional roguelikes things like 868-hack are made to be independent of spoilers."
roguelikes,3do5he,nluqo,5,Sat Jul 18 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"One of the design goals of DCSS is that it should be beatable without spoilers. This has really gotten better in recent releases (e.g. examining a monster tells you what resistances and spells it has).  I'd say the main thing you'd want the wiki for is branch order. Not just which order to visit which branch, but which order to visit the individual floors in each branch (it's often better to save the last floor of a branch for later).  A lot of people claim you can figure this stuff as you go along. In theory, you won't need spoilers if you are very careful and very perceptive (i.e. leaving a branch once it becomes too much)."
roguelikes,3do5he,lightrevisted,2,Sat Jul 18 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"No one mentioned dungeon crawl stone soup, while its certainly easier if you read a newbie guide, it does not really need spoilers."

roguelikes,3do5he,Epidemilk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"Well if you're going with roguelites, Isaac all day"
roguelikes,3do5he,Charadin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:22 2015 UTC,Ah so that's what the difference is. I'd noticed the term roguelite being thrown around but I'd never really picked up on what it meant.   Honestly if OP doesn't want spoilers I can't think of any that would be a good fit.
roguelikes,3do5he,thursdae,2,Fri Jul 17 23:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Isaac is pretty much the best example of the term, imo. I think it was even the game that pioneered the concept of a roguelite. Though there's no concrete definition. It seems to be ""a game you wouldn't call a roguelike, but it has prominent elements unique to roguelikes."" Isaac has the random content, permadeath, and subjectively (and due to the first two), it's difficult/easy to die and has a lot of play knowledge to gain, and tons of replayability.   I dislike the elitism regarding the terms, but I get why they're that way. Roguelites borrow a lot of the same rulesets, but they're not the same style of gameplay. So I would say it's a game of any kind that has a lot of its inner gameplay mechanics in common with traditional roguelikes. Roguelites tend to not be turn-based strategy RPGs at heart :)"
roguelikes,3do5he,Epidemilk,2,Sat Jul 18 15:23:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's... a term you can use to keep the more pedantic residents of this sub off your back when talking about games that have the randomization and permadeath, but aren't turn based"
roguelikes,3do5he,Charadin,5,Fri Jul 17 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"See, and here I'd always thought of roguelikes and just being permadeath and randomization. I guess that would include things like Minecraft as well then so I can kind of understand why a differentiation is needed.   That raises an interesting question though. Would Dwarf Fortress be considered a roguelike or a roguelite? It's free play until you pause it, it's got randomization and perma-(fortress)death, but the focus of the actual game strikes me as closer to Minecraft than Nethack."
roguelikes,3do5he,Shareoff,4,Fri Jul 17 23:26:55 2015 UTC,"Mhm. When people start calling Terraria and Minecraft and Don't Starve ""roguelikes"", you fully realize the term holds no meaning, because Terraria and Brogue for example have NOTHING in common other than procedural generation, which a lot of games have to some extent. I think the diffrentiation between roguelikes and roguelites is very important but also very problematic. Unfortunately. :("

roguelikes,3di52q,Fireblast950,25,Thu Jul 16 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"Use the tutorials people link, but one thing that I find really helpful is to quickly understand how some of the major world interactions are modeled. I think a big tripping point is people not knowing how to find the basic operations themselves. They see it on a tutorial, but unless they have the command in front of them they don't know how to get back to it. This is because the main menu is usually never explained well and players have trouble figuring out which main menu option will present them with the option to mine (or build or whatever).  DF's main menu has 4 important menu options that control almost all of the building options:   (d)esginate is for harvesting or taking from the existing world. You designate some part of the world for modification be it mining, deconstruction, harvesting lumber, harvesting plants, etc. You are designating an area to be worked on. (b)uild is for adding things to the world. Anything that has a physical aspect to it (walls, tables, beds, etc.) that you want to add to the world you do so through this menu. stock(p)ile is for assigning an area to be storage. Basically you're telling dwarves to put items of a certain type in a certain area. It's analogous to building a chest in Minecraft and saying, ""only put stone in here"". (i) zones is for assigning areas to have a specific use without modifying the area. This menu lets you control how dwarves use spaces without changing those spaces or preventing them from being used other ways. (This isn't often needed, but worth mentioning for completion)   Other than that the other major thing is just the different flavors of look:   loo(k) to learn about the world and see what's out there. (q) Set building preferences to learn more about built objects and modify their behavior (notably workshops, beds, and tables) (v)iew units to learn about and modify the behavior of units.   Most of the other hotkeys are things you can put off learning for a fair amount of time. So remember these ones specifically for their importance and learn the others as you need them.  So using that lets answer how to build a bedroom (assuming we already have a bed for simplicity).   Well first I need to mine out an area. This is taking from the world so it must be a designation. Then I need to add the bed to the world (place the bed). Adding to the world means it's a build action. Now I want to modify the bed so I can indicate its a bedroom rather than a bed for another purpose. (q) is how I modify placed/built items."

There are exceptions to the above rule of thumbs, but most of them of them are very ancillary functions you don't really need to touch.  The biggest notable one is deconstructing built items which is unfortunately a bit weird. It's a designation if it's a construction, but it's a modification to a building (q) otherwise.  The difference makes sense when you understand the special rules around a construction, but until then it's a bit odd."

The df sub is a friendly place and I promise you if you put a dozen  hours or so into it, it will reward you with so much FUN!  Again, it's not that complicated.

The starter packs are just like the famous Lazy Newb Pack, only that they're still being actively updated. The starter pack adds new graphics/tiles and a handful of helpful tools that makes it easier and a lot more accessible for new players.  Here are some other helpful resources that might come in handy.  Websites, forums, IRC channel:   Official DF homepage Official Dwarf Fortress forum /r/dwarffortress - Dwarf Fortress subreddit.

Flowcharts Dwarf Fortress quick reference guide   Video tutorials:   Captain_Duck Video Tutorials 51ppycup's Dwarf Fortress for Dummies Let's play Dwarf Fortress with Quill18 Arumba's Dwarf Fortress Ideneral Let's Play   It's not hard to get into or understanding the game, it just feels extremely overwhelming when you first start playing it, mainly because of all the different commands and random stuff happening on the screen.  When you first start the game remember to turn off aquifers (you can do that if you use PeridexisErrant's Starter Pack). It'll make your game and learning experience much easier.  Start by creating a world with minimum amounts of beasts and savagery. Then embark at a spot that is calm (very few monsters and evil there), has a river, is forested and different types of minerals. This will help you out in the long run as monsters won't attack you nearly as frequently. You'll also have fresh water and fish from the river, wood to cut down and metals to craft and forge with.   Watch some tutorial videos, have the Dwarf Fortress wiki up and focus only on parts of the game in the beginning. Get familiar with the hot keys, learn how to dig, cut down trees, channeling and how to use stairs. Then focus on stockpiles, farms and building workshops. The military part is the hardest, but that's only because of all the different and confusing menus.  It took me about 5/6 hours to get the basics, so I highly doubt it'll take you much more than that to get the hang of it. If you got a decent understanding of roguelikes then some of the stuff will come in handy as well.  Good luck."

They are very similar (to be honest, they seem nearly identical for the most part. Dwarf Fortress is exaggerated / over glorified quite a bit.) However, last time I checked, those games are not finished like Dwarf Fortress is (DF is not still in alpha. It's released. Get over it. It's fully playable and then some. Real alphas / early access are barely playable or not at all really.)  So I'm not sure how much those have been developed since I last checked. However, it's been awhile since I did."

roguelikes,3dipph,cynap,6,Thu Jul 16 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"Caves of Qud has fully rebindable keys, so you can play it however you like. I enjoy the story, and the balance between fixed overworld map, fixed towns, and randomized everything else. The abilities are unique, and use a cooldown system rather than mana. That plus Mutations, ""legendary"" creatures, dismemberment (rare, but it's there) and the extremely intuitive UI design are other reasons why I love it. It feels familiar, yet does enough differently to capture my attention. The tiles keep the feel of ASCII while also being legible to newcomers. If you're not into an open world, you might not get as much enjoyment out of it though. Nethack is a very different game, and both are great. Hopefully that helps! Keep in mind that I'm not a big Nethack fan, and the isometric perspective of Vulture confuses me at times. Completely biased here."
roguelikes,3dipph,LemonRaven,3,Thu Jul 16 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"adding to that, Caves of Qud is very unique in its setting (post apocalyptic, world overgrown by nature, water is a precious resource), where Nethack is all Fantasy and D&D tropes thrown together. And CoQ is by no means easy!"
roguelikes,3dipph,cynap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I haven't beaten CoQ yet. I end up doing lair runs, finding a place underground that goes on forever and eventually dying to an enemy I shouldn't be facing yet. The setting doesn't sound so unique, but I think the ""technology is almost mythical"" and mutants add to the atmosphere immensely."

Vulture for nethack is basically nethack, then someone ages ago made a 3d isometric interface for it called Falcon's Eye, then some jokers took the whole project, did basically nothing to it and then years' later dumped it on steam. They handle criticism with banning, flagging reviews, banning users from the steam discussion area. I can't recommend supporting them. But read this if you want drama: it's my review of vulture that the devs got deleted from steam despite 194 of 256 people (76%) finding it helpful:   http://steamcommunity.com/id/feistykobold/recommended/341390"

Based on that alone I'd side with buying Qud.   I don't have much experience with Nethack, but I've enjoyed Qud a lot over the last few years and I'd say it's worth the price on Steam right now.  And while I despise most tilesets myself, Oryx's tiles for Brogue are pretty good if you're looking for something free.  EDIT: Qud should be getting mouse input support on Steam soonish."
roguelikes,3dipph,AlanWithTea,5,Thu Jul 16 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"Although Vulture is one of the more palatable versions of Nethack, my vote goes to Caves of Qud.   Qud is more open, less frustrating. It has a far more detailed character creation suite and a more interesting game world."
roguelikes,3dipph,phalp,6,Thu Jul 16 21:43:47 2015 UTC,"Caves of Qud. If you want to play Nethack you can just get over yourself and play ASCII for free, but CoQ needs buying, except to try out the old version you could get before they reworked it."

(I'm assuming you mainly run Windows yourself and thus are not a great candidate for testing that they work properly)  If the directory structure is done appropriately (separate top level directories for Windows and Linux), torrent size should not be a major concern, since torrenters would presumably only select the stuff they can actually run for downloading.  One other concern to consider for Linux or MacOSX: They actually have a real packaging system, so in many cases it would be better to provide references for package names to install rather than the actual distribution itself.  For example, for the platform I'm running, Arch Linux, the following packages are available either as part of community or AUR:   angband (and angband-git) stone-soup (and stone-soup-git, stone-soup-ncurses) adom (and adom-noteye) asciisec avanor  cataclysm-dda (and cataclysm-dda-git, cataclysm-dda-ncurses) doomrl diablorl frozendepths gearhead2 gnomesquad goblincamp-hg gruesome hydraslayer into-the-dungeon++ incursion ivan-git keeperrl-git larn mangband midboss mines-of-elderlore nethack-x11 nlarn omega-revived powder princessrl primerl prospector scroll smart-kobold steamband tome4 (and tome4-git) tox-7drl tsl (the slimy lichmummy) urw (Unreal World) vicious-orcs wrogue zangband zapm   This is just from a quick search yaourt roguelike.

I spent days manually looking through the games to see if they were legit and to check if it was okay to upload them (and that was just the time I spent on it over the last two weeks).

roguelikes,3ddp5a,esculato,3,Wed Jul 15 19:19:29 2015 UTC,Is there any place I can find a beginner guide?
roguelikes,3ddp5a,Duke_Nukem_1990,12,Wed Jul 15 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find one anywhere really. But anyway, I had the day off work, bought it first thing in the morning and played it all day. Here's what I've come up with as an ""easy mode"" beginner pathway. I would say that this is still significantly more difficult than grabbing a rune in DC:SS. In fact I feel like this game breaks some ""roguelike promises"" regarding fairness and they probably need to tighten that up. For starters, auto-explore is pretty dangerous in this game because it will walk into attack range of attacking plants. Ridiculous.  So, the build that has been most easy for me is to bring all of your stat modifiers to zero except for ego, that will be your dump stat. Then bring your up intelligence up to +2 modifier. Arrange the remaining points how you like. Choose time dilation as a mutation and then whatever you want for the rest keeping in mind we are making a martial character. If you want to dual wield, then you'll need night vision or light manipulation. I like combinations of Extra Heart, Horns, Double Muscled, and Double Jointed depending on what I'm doing. Choose the Warden or Marauder archetype. I prefer warden.  At the start of the press M and set your Time Dilation hotkey to 1. This ability is very powerful on melee characters. Walk directly east and find the home of Tam, the saltstrider. Go inside of his house stand next to him and attack him. Then activate time dilation. Then attack until he's dead. You should win this fight almost every time and if you don't it's easy to restart with the same character and do it again. Step on his corpse and press G to look through his stuff. Take anything good. Ideally you want a weapon of above iron grade. That could be something carbide or something with other solid modifiers. You can determine a starting build for skills based on what you find here (whether to dual wield or sword and board or whatever).  Equip your new loot, and examine any weird artifacts. Then go to Argyve on the west end of town. Accept his quest and turn in your weird artifacts. You'll get to turn in two and level up one time before he asks you to fetch some wire for him. Accept that quest. Press ""P"" and start working towards your build. Dual wielding with daggers is very strong. Long swords with shields are excellent as well. Guns are really difficult to find ammo for, so I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. Be sure to press ""M"" afterwards and set hotkeys for any new active abilities you purchased. Press ""X"" as you level as well to level up your ability powers and mutations.   Now go to the hut immediately to the west of Tam's. Take whatever is in the chest and then pass your turn until the owner of the house comes to fight you. Activate Time Dilation, kill the farmer, and take whatever you need from him.  Now press ""< "" to go to the world map. You are going to walk directly east to the rust wells. There are three entrances next to each other, each with a bunch of wire on every level and increasing difficulty as you go down. Safest thing is to scavenge the surface of each entrance and then pick an entrance to trek down. It's usually fine with this build just to plunge into level one or even two of each of the entrances. Kill enemies, grab loot, level up. Make sure to equip a ranged weapon to shoot at seed spitting plants. They are probably the most deadly thing you'll face.  If you get lost on the way to or from the wells just explore the area until you find a friendly or neutral unit to talk to (they will tell you how to get out) or until you become unlost. This is the easiest way to die early aside from bad rolls against Tam.  Once you have your wire go turn it into Argyve. He'll give you a recall device with a dead battery. Talk to him again and he'll give you another quest.  Now go talk to Medhev (near where you started). He'll give you a quest to go to Red Rocks. Press ""<"" and then head directly north to Red Rocks. Red Rocks is a little harder than Rust Wells, but just keep going from there. Around level four you should find everything you need for the quest. If you find a full energy cell you can use the recoiler to return to Joppa. If you don't you're walking back on foot. The level on which you complete the quest is extremely dangerous and I haven't explored it all yet.  When you have turned this quest in you can continue with Argyve's quest at the Grit Gate or go exploring. This is as far as I've gotten though. I always die at Grit Gate or in my further explorations.  There's a very good chance that things I've written in this ""guide"" are horrible ideas that just cheat through the early game while sacrificing late game strength. I really have no idea what I'm doing, but this will get you an hour or so into the game to really experience things and begin to feel how it plays rather than just dying non-stop."

roguelikes,3dgpao,Kasaris,3,Fri Jul 17 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"I got west of Joppa and found Argyve. He gave me his quest so I was like ""Ok let's go east !"". I found randomly that ""<"" or ""?"" was for opening up the world map and I headed east and two tiles later I was super thirsty and hungry, I thought ""That's quick!"". I left the world map and continued to go east. Finally I was killed by... some kind of white bunny ~_~"

It ended up in a Benny Hill skit with me being chased by said goat, as well as (but not limited to) a two-headed boar, several birds, a... oh god what was that thing...   Despite my evolved regeneration mutation, I died like a dozen screens away from the origin of the fight."

roguelikes,3df7mj,apoisel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:15:51 2015 UTC,I have read an advance copy of this book and can testify that it is good :)
roguelikes,3df7mj,DarrenGrey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:24 2015 UTC,"The cover is ok in itself but I don't think it really fits as the cover of the book. It reminds me of the old days when computer games had epic painted covers which had little to do with the actual games they were illustrating. I would have gone for an ASCII only screenshot, maybe Brogue or Angband, fairly zoomed in so you only see maybe 12x12 cells, then artfully rotated left a bit, bit of processing to add some noise, maybe even scanlines.    That said I'll be buying both books as soon as they are out because if nothing else they are unique in being books on roguelikes.    I don't really see the point of delaying the print version of the book because the audio book won't be ready either. Oh well."
roguelikes,3dfaxx,Scrolldier,4,Wed Jul 15 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the low down on cybernetics:    Only True Kin can use them  You get them in the cybernetics floor of Bethesda Susa, which is pretty far in the game.  You get one credit wedge in Bethesda Susa, cybernetics floor. It costs one credit per cybernetic. I think I recall a sparking Baetyl giving me another, once. There's four types available. Night vision module (never used, don't really need it...), two Indexer modules (They tell you the HP, AV, and DV of creatures when you look at them. One for biological things, I think it's the same as the bioscanner bracelet? The other is for nonbiological things, including the AV/DV of walls.). The last one is the chrome cannon which costs you an arm to use, but is like a renewable super cannon blast. Takes a few turns to charge AFAIR, and uses the rifles skill.    EDIT: I've been meaning to write down the explicit details for a while, but I've been busy recently and my horticulurists have all suffered from YASD. What more did you want to know?"
roguelikes,3dfaxx,ordineu,2,Thu Jul 16 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"Mostly I just wanted to know if there were any more beyond the 4 I encountered in Bethesda Susa and if there were more ways to get credits but you've answered those above, thanks!"
roguelikes,3dcldx,jjggtt123,11,Wed Jul 15 05:30:17 2015 UTC,Have you tried Unreal World? It's like a medieval CDDA.
roguelikes,3dcldx,tenyardsoflinen,5,Wed Jul 15 05:50:55 2015 UTC,Unreal World Thanks ill give it a try.
roguelikes,3dcldx,IMPLANKINGONAMILLION,8,Wed Jul 15 06:14:24 2015 UTC,Check out NEO Scavenger as well.
roguelikes,3dcldx,foamed,6,Wed Jul 15 08:31:33 2015 UTC,"There are maybe a handful of games in the genre, but those that comes to mind are:   Caves of Qud - Sci-fi/post-apocalyptic roguelike. Rogue Survivor - Zombie survival roguelike. UnReal World - Low fantasy survival roguelike set in the late iron age in Finland. Wayward - Island survival roguelike. Coming to Steam soon. NEO Scavenger - Post apocalyptic survival roguelike.   If you don't mind roguelites then Don't Starve shares some similarities as well."

There's nowhere near the intricate item interaction or the building mechanics, but it's open-world, post-apocalyptic in theme, has very involved character creation, and allows the player to mutate/self-modify."
roguelikes,3dcldx,Lord_of_the_Scums,3,Wed Jul 15 16:16:46 2015 UTC,What about Rougelike Survival?
roguelikes,3dcldx,AlanWithTea,3,Wed Jul 15 08:06:13 2015 UTC,Are you thinking of Rogue Survivor?
roguelikes,3dcldx,dangoofed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"There was also zomband ages and ages ago, but from what i remember that was more of like a doomrl style ""arcade"" roguelike, depends on what you mean by like cataclysm, Rogue survivor is cool because it simulates the pre apocalypse so you're not the only one screwing people over for food and weapons, everyones rushing around at turning into zombies at the same time, and if you die first you can play as the zombie"
roguelikes,3dcldx,Moxxuren,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:25:02 2015 UTC,I tried so hard to like cata dda but it glitched on me like 3 times on my first day. :(  I know it's silly but minecraft on hardcore mode (permadeath) with your goal being to kill the ender dragon is roguelike in a few ways.
roguelikes,3dcldx,demonbutter,4,Wed Jul 15 11:14:52 2015 UTC,Maybe try the Better Than Wolves mod.
roguelikes,3dcldx,FifthCPU,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:39:11 2015 UTC,"/r/betaexpansion in expert hardcore is pretty much a roguelike in terms of difficulty, too bad the project's been dropped, at least temporarily.  There is a mod, the You Will Die mod, that adds roguelike elements to minecraft, but its not too difficult.  Roguelike dungeones or MCDungeon are great to combine with any of them :)"

roguelikes,3dbwr5,chromophones,2,Wed Jul 15 01:54:33 2015 UTC,"Guaranteed traders at the bottom of the grit gate and in the village of kyakukya. Random traders are very rare. Around the watervine swamps of joppa you may find a glowpad merchant, but he is in a single randomly chosen location and it will take a LONG time to just search for merchants like this. Personally I cheat a little and use the debug to reveal all random encounters/world map intricacies."
roguelikes,3dbwr5,Scrolldier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have to head to the Grit Gate right now for that tinkerer in Joppa anyway. Might as well get going I suppose. Also... how does one activate that debug command just in case I want to be a dirty dirty cheater one day?
roguelikes,3dbwr5,Scrolldier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:11:19 2015 UTC,From the title screen go to options>debug>indicate overland encounters on the main map. There's a TON of interesting things in the options that are worth messing around with.

Anyway, I had to renew my Steam agreement, and it turns out that Approaching Infinity is not actually allowed to be on steam greenlight right now, because, yes, Shrapnel Games does have ""Exclusive Rights"".  I the future, when I recover my rights to sell on my own, AI will come back to Steam, itch.io, and whatever else is around at that point. But for the foreseeable future, there's only one way to get it.  It's nice to know that people are thinking about the game out there in the larger world. We do have a bit of a community with Shrapnel, but I need to be reminded occasionally...  Thanks, Bob Developer of Approaching Infinity"
roguelikes,3dbelz,IBOL17,2,Wed Jul 15 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"Hope you are not breaking a NDA by talking about the agreement you have with shrapnel.  And thanks for the quick reply. AI looked like fun, but I just cannot afford that price."
roguelikes,3dbelz,Soyweiser,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"The dev has said multiple times he was extremely unconfident about AI ever making it through Greenlight, as it at been there for a very long time and had lackluster response. (I think it might very well fare differently if put up there now, instead of way back when.) He also took a deal with a separate publisher which is just arcane enough that it might have an exclusivity clause..."

If anything by the time it gets to steam it may be a gold edition or further tweaked.  I just have issues buying from Shrapnel and those other sites (price gouge etc).  I will hold out for this but i don't foresee me buying it from the other store.  Now if i could pay the dev directly a responsible price I would do so.  Not that you can answer this but how long do i have to wait until i can get without crazy DRM and at a good price point i.e. 20-25 dollars?  Also thanks for jumping in, i was scouring the internet for anything about this since i was following it on greenlight."
