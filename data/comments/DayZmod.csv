DayZmod,3e71vi,cef1,3,Wed Jul 22 14:15:10 2015 UTC,"Have tried it, when downloading anything it is ridiculously slow, gets stuck for 3+ hours seeding and then reports all my files as corrupt, so I have to manually redownload them."
DayZmod,3e71vi,Demoknight123,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:36:29 2015 UTC,Try upping you're torrent limit in settings. Should be the http option or something
DayZmod,3e71vi,cef1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:03:02 2015 UTC,You may want to try 6 launcher then. I havent tried it myself but its the one associated with dayzmod.com.  http://www.dayzmod.com/?PlaywithSIX

DayZmod,3e3r6t,gunnerpad,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:13 2015 UTC,Derp.   Don't care. Didn't watch.
DayZmod,3e3r6t,Jbird206,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:46 2015 UTC,That was kinda my point in the video. :)
DayZmod,3e343w,heyitsronin33,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:16 2015 UTC,what exactly are you looking for in making this post? why not play both? this sub is basically a Dayz Vanilla one now since the emergence of Elite Vanilla retards
DayZmod,3e343w,coftsock,0,Tue Jul 21 22:28:36 2015 UTC,You've already purchased both. What do you want?
DayZmod,3e343w,Jbird206,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:36 2015 UTC,I love how people always list their GPU's when referring to performance. As if the RV engine gives a fuck what card you have.
DayZmod,3dyvnp,CubeSoldier,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:51 2015 UTC,Finally a 1st person only server :D
DayZmod,3dyvnp,tezkr,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:57 2015 UTC,Hell yes! Hop in!
DayZmod,3dyvnp,iConnorN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:42 2015 UTC,On the same or separate hive?
DayZmod,3dyvnp,Yid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:07 2015 UTC,Separate.
DayZmod,3dyvnp,vinyljunkiez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:46:53 2015 UTC,But does it have side chat?
DayZmod,3dyvnp,AndrewRO,2,Mon Jul 20 19:00:21 2015 UTC,No side chat.
DayZmod,3dyvnp,vinyljunkiez,0,Tue Jul 21 05:46:42 2015 UTC,"OP shouldn't have refered to it as ""vanilla"" then."
DayZmod,3dyvnp,AndrewRO,2,Tue Jul 21 09:26:32 2015 UTC,"um... If your REALLY going to nit pick, original vanilla way back when didn't have side chat, that was added in much later. And IIRC the default setting still has side chat set to off."
DayZmod,3dyvnp,iConnorN,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"Vanilla DayZ mod had side chat early on in it's existence, but was then removed on the public hive.  For a majority of DayZ mod's existence, the vanilla setting for side chat is off.  It is private hives with custom settings that turned side chat back on."
DayZmod,3dyvnp,BC_Hawke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"Kind of true, doesn't really matter. Remember when servers got blacklisted for implementing side chat because rocket absolutely didn't want it."
DayZmod,3dyvnp,Jbird206,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:44:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this cube. I will do a proper announcement soon but this is even more powerful as its coming from you guys, our players. This is a first-person version of DayZ Europa on a separate hive."

DayZmod,3dkq2g,skippythemoonrock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:25:43 2015 UTC,Thing is loud as hell so for now it is just acting as a mobile tent.

DayZmod,3dhd0d,Jbird206,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:03:14 2015 UTC,Thanks mate
DayZmod,3dhd0d,Jbird206,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:04:02 2015 UTC,What other things were you working on? What country are you from? Would you release the files so someone else can use Invasion? Are the UFOs more fierce lately since you have changed to the Chernarus map? Seems like it.
DayZmod,3d1li6,de_fa,3,Sun Jul 12 19:49:47 2015 UTC,You mean Battle Royale? Development for Arma 2 DayZ Battle Royale ended last year and there aren't any servers anywhere. PlayerUnknown is currently developing the mod from the ground up for Arma 3.  Link to their website
DayZmod,3d1li6,tezkr,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"there are BR's out there, better known as Munchie Games.  now im not promoting here just helping OP CCG community host ""Munchie games""  which are essentially the hunger games spiced up a bit.  find out more here: http://customcombatgaming.com/forums/index.php?/forum/33-ccg-munchie-games-info/  they still host them alot, you just have to keep an eye on the forums/twitch channels.  granted it isn't the same as the original Arma 2 Battle royale but variants of it do exist....."
DayZmod,3d1li6,Zombaholic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:05:45 2015 UTC,"OP see my reply to tezkr, they do exist!!!!"

DayZmod,3d2d44,tezkr,2,Sun Jul 12 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a LOT of people got false bans last night, but the problem should be fixed now.  Try to join, if still banned, sign up at the forums, join their teamspeak at ts.us434.com , or post something on their gametracker page."
DayZmod,3d2d44,BC_Hawke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:40:52 2015 UTC,Still having the issue and I can't seem to be able to connect to the teamspeak.  And I can't sign up on the forums because the website looks like this :/
DayZmod,3d2d44,ElDubardo,2,Mon Jul 13 02:42:33 2015 UTC,"use any recent browser like chrome, firefox and make sure you dont have bad extension"
DayZmod,3d2d44,BC_Hawke,2,Mon Jul 13 03:38:17 2015 UTC,Did you try a different browser?
DayZmod,3d2d44,BC_Hawke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:12:11 2015 UTC,Tried Chrome and Firefox both up to date and with out addons enabled
DayZmod,3d2d44,BC_Hawke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:09:04 2015 UTC,"Don't know what to tell you.  I've given you 3 options on how to contact 434 admins.  Find a different computer that loads the website properly or can join their TS, or contact them via their GameTracker page.  Beyond that you could PM the admin here on Reddit: /u/geryontom"
DayZmod,3d2d44,GeryonTom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:25:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for your help!  The issue sorted itself out somehow? Oh well at least I can play some good old DayZ on my day off :)
DayZmod,3d2d44,coftsock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"The issue with BattlEye filters that caused the false bans is fixed, but I believe they had to manually go through and un-ban everyone that got hit by the screwup.  This is my best guess.  Try to contact one of the admins and you should be set."
