patientgamers,3e2ilk,TheLoneRaiser,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:05 2015 UTC,Dude I object... Killzone 3 is dominated by people who've been playing the game since launch an have these insane upgrades on all their classes. Getting beyond the first few ranks feels nearly impossible without getting completely destroyed for a solid few hours.
patientgamers,3e2ilk,k5n,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:56 2015 UTC,That happens with any online experience.
patientgamers,3e2ilk,Massgyo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:31 2015 UTC,I can see that. I remember getting destroyed for a while back when I was playing it on Ps3 though. It didn't take too long to pick it up and to get upgraded to a reasonable level. It wasnt  too bad when i played it recently even though i was starting from scratch. You're bound to be behind the curve initially.

It switched to assassination and I had spawned as an infiltrator (or whatever it was called) and had maxed out my ""disguise"" ability. The opposition team were in a huddle around the target. I just walked up from the side and took out the target with a melee attack. Chaos ensued."

patientgamers,3e2wk6,delitomatoes,4,Tue Jul 21 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"I've played the entire thing and while I do have some major criticisms, I still think it's a great game.  As for your concerns about the combat, those will probably stick with you if you play the whole game.  I liked it well enough, but still prefer the style of the previous games, though the new control scheme does work better on a controller (for me, that's a plus, but I know it's the opposite for a lot of people).  The characters I think are actually quite good overall.  There are only a couple of them that I found annoying or boring, but in general I think they created a well-rounded cast with interesting and entertaining personalities.  I'm not sure what part of the game you play in the demo, but they definitely do more than spout lore (though of course there is a good bit of that; I mean, it's a Dragon Age game, after all).  Like Mass Effect 2, each character has some sort of personal quest that you can choose to do, and some of those are quite interesting.  My main complaint about the game is the decision to take the series in a more open-world direction.  I don't have a problem with that in theory, but while I loved exploring the beautiful environments they've created, they didn't put enough effort into filling these areas with interesting things to do.  Many of the sidequests are pretty mundane, and feel like filler.  You don't have to do a ton of them in order to progress in the game, but you do have to do some because of the way the game locks out the story missions.  All that said, I do think it's worth playing if you have the time to put into it.  It's the longest Dragon Age game, largely because of the open-world aspect, taking me close to 100 hours to finish (and there were a couple of entire areas on the map that I never even went to).  The way the story ties into the events from the previous games is also quite well done, so if you're a fan of the series you will definitely get a lot out of it."
patientgamers,3e2wk6,OkayAtBowling,6,Tue Jul 21 18:02:04 2015 UTC,It's an excellent game.
patientgamers,3e2wk6,outline01,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"It's a good game, but don't get it for PS3. It looks and plays horribly when compared with the PS4 or PC versions. I have no experience with the Xbox versions, so I can't comment on those."

Atlus put out a bunch of great, weird games like Riviera, Gungnir, tactics ogre, class of Heroes, and the whole persona series. xseed gave us (in addition to almost all the Nihon Falcom stuff) the best versions of Lunar and Star Ocean out there. Square put out some great (and some less than great) final fantasy stuff alongside one of the best Kingdom Hearts games. Plus it plays Ps1 classics via PSN (or hacking). It's an amazing rpg machine."
patientgamers,3e0rdm,Ignore_User_Name,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:55:27 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your assertion that the PSP had a lot of good RPGs, the value of its library is greatly diminished when one looks at its original titles - the majority of the titles that you mentioned are either enhanced ports, remakes, or remasters. While this might be a moot point for those that have never played the original games, it isn't exactly appealing to those that wish to play something new.   The NDS is arguably better in terms of original titles. For example, Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is an excellent game for the PSP. However, it doesn't offer much to someone who has already played the original - they would more likely favor Valkyrie Profile: Convenant of the Plume (for the NDS) instead."

If you're a person who's just going to go from mission A to mission B and never stops to take a look around, then you weren't wrong to bail.  If you're the type of person who says hey, WTF is over there, I haven't been over there let's go there just because then JC2 is immensely entertaining.   (Especially visiting the island in the extreme NW part of the map way before you're ""supposed"" to.)

patientgamers,3e1kus,lurking9,3,Tue Jul 21 08:03:53 2015 UTC,"My opinion is fuck yeah you should buy it for cheap!  JC2's story isn't much, it's true.  But JC2 is basically a huge open world sandbox that's just dying for you to say you know what, fuck the story I'm just going to go round fuckin' shit up!  Especially later in the game when you get flying vehicles, you'll find yourself for no reason at all stealing a plane, or a helicopter, or a 747 and either declaring war on the entire island or flying it into things just because you can.  You're basically the star of your own action movie; if that's not appealing to you then jc2 will not appeal to you.  Personally, I've always wanted to grapple hook to an ICBM and ride it down Dr. Strangelove style!  I eventually died doing it and had to replay the mission but I couldn't have given two fucks about that, I was having fun fucking around!  If that sounds like your cup of tea, then JC2 is heartily recommended!"

patientgamers,3e1kus,personahorrible,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"I bought it during the Steam Summer sale after hearing nothing but good things about it for years. Everything about it just felt ""off"" to me. Guns have zero feedback, both shooting and getting shot. I never knew I was getting hit until my screen started flashing red to indicate I was low on health. I didn't know if my shots were connecting until an enemy fell over dead.   After about a half hour of fooling around with the first couple of missions, I tried the Elder Scrolls method of taking a shortcut to my next destination by going in a straight line, mountain ranges be damned. I wound up stuck in the middle of nowhere, grappling from tree to tree with miles of terrain left to traverse before I said fuck it and uninstalled the game."

Some past GwG that I've been happy to get: Dishonored, SSX, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, Tomb Raider, Witcher 2, Dark Souls, Civilization Revolution, Bioshock Infinite, Hitman Absolution, Dead Island, Sleeping Dogs, Saint's Row the Third. I mean it's hit or miss, but i've never gotten to the end of a year's subscription and thought that I came out with less than what the subscription cost worth of games I'm interested in. It helps that I was very late to get a 360 so I hadn't already played everything.   And don't buy a year at full price, I always hunt for $30 - $35 deals. It's pretty easy now with the digital code distributors. Anyway, something to consider.   Oh one more thing, if you do get a gold membership, you might as well grab the free Xbox One games as well. That way if you ever get an Xbox One, even if its 10 years from now, you'll have a bunch of free games awaiting you."
patientgamers,3e1cmw,AngryWizard,5,Tue Jul 21 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"If you like games like Resident Evil 4 or No More Heroes, you should totally get Shadows of the Damned. It's a collaboration between Suda 51 and Shinji Mikami, with music by Akira Yamaoka of the Silent Hill series, and it's an incredibly silly, oddball, intense action/horror third-person shooter. I highly recommend it."

patientgamers,3e1cmw,GreyTabbyRaikov,4,Tue Jul 21 09:41:55 2015 UTC,"The issue with 360s is over heating, which is the leading cause of the red ring of death. The heat causes the motherboard to bend and the processor pops up.  To avoid this: Take a look at the unit and become aware of where the vents are. Standing it up will block one of the side vents, so lay it down, and leave about 6 inches of space around the entire thing for air flow. Don't leave it in direct sun light or near an exhaust of any other electronics. Don't let it run for an excessive amount of time (ie. over night).  If you take care of it, it can last quite a while. Have fun!"

Also, unless you intend on gaming online, this machine is worthless for netflix because it is gated behind XB Live.  Edit: Looks like the 360 can run netflix without XB live, now.   Also, I realized I didn't recommend a game. You gotta, gotta get Forza 5. It is by far the prettiest racing game of the last generation. They've also locked down the Porsche license rights."

You should make sure you like that style of game though, because even on normal difficulty it makes Dark Souls look like Animal Crossing. Very difficult but also rewarding, one of those games where the deaths usually aren't cheap and you just have to get better and better. Eventually guys that showed up as bosses or minibosses start getting thrown in as normal enemies and you'll be surprised at how far you've come.  Gears of War is great for co-op, and the campaigns aren't bad solo either (at least for 1 and 3, but 2 is probably cheap enough at this point to be worth it)."

patientgamers,3dxpzs,Goobyalus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:54 2015 UTC,I think the Tropico 5 is a mistake on their end as shows up in my list as expiring at the same time as Tropico 3 (October 6th 2014).  Tropico 3 was given away for free which is the only reason that I have it.  I had already bought 4 a couple of months before that and I never bought 5 because I barely play the other two.

Some other people in this thread are saying they have random keys showing up in their library too, so maybe it's just a glitch where they put out unactivated keys into some people's accounts.    Also, keep an eye on GMG if you want the Metro Redux bundle since they had the two games for $8 after voucher there a few days ago, so maybe that will show up in an encore for their summer sale."

patientgamers,3dxpzs,escheriv,5,Mon Jul 20 13:38:35 2015 UTC,"There's some controversy about the OP, but the lesson stands: Redeem your key right away  The Humble folks bust their ass to negotiate with developers and publishers to get them to agree to a bundle.  They turn away a ton of developers too - I've worked with some, and I've been on the receiving end of that Hollywood-style rejection email, ""Your game just isn't a good fit for us.""  A developer gets money signs in their eyes, and then the bundle begins - and it sells hundreds of thousands of bundles.  Then you have to split it with 7 other games.  And Humble themselves.  And the charity.  And credit card processing.  And then taxes.  And most people paid the bare minimum. Do you know how far a dollar goes when you split it between 8 developers, a charity, Humble, and the credit card processors?   The end result is, you probably made less than you would from a decent Steam sale.  And then you have to just give keys out forever - when Humble runs out, you have to resupply them (they don't have direct access to getting Steam keys) and if the developer made a pittance, they don't have a ton of motivation to go grab more keys.   It's a weird situation.  So just bypass it by redeeming your Steam keys the day you buy it.  Save everyone involved a lot of headache."

A modded skyrim with a bunch of graphics mods would  have an amazing wow factor, but is a lot of work to set up, though /r/skyrimmods could help you with that. Crysis as suggested would also be a pretty good one, not necessarily for the graphics, though they'd still be considered good today, but the graphics engine itself is impressive when you consider the destructible environment and the interactive fauna. Not to mention the great gameplay.   The witcher games (2 & 3) are graphically impressive, I can't speak to the gameplay of 3, but both would no doubt have some ""WOW"" factor in them.

Tomb Raider reboot Assassins Creed: Black Flag     Probably in this order.  I hear AC Unity looks good, but I'm not wasting money on that turd unless it's $5 or less.

patientgamers,3dymf9,SpaceEskimo11t,6,Mon Jul 20 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"My pick would be RE5 since it's more fun and feels more complete than RE6.  RE6 felt boring and repetitive as you kept doing the same things in each of the campaigns since the campaigns cross paths multiple times during the game, whereas RE5 was one complete story with Chris and Sheva.      RE6 isn't a bad game though and is made a lot better with a co-op partner, which is true for RE5 as well.  And to answer your edit, RE4 is the best modern RE game without a doubt, though it is only single player if you were looking for a co-op game."

patientgamers,3dymf9,greatestname,4,Mon Jul 20 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"The Revelations games continue the style that was RE4. Suspense, exploration, environment, enemy types, story etc. Whereas e.g. in RE6, you fight against machine gun and RPG swinging enemies, like a generic third person shooter with limited ammo. It is a Resident Evil game mostly in name only to me. RE5 similarly is way too much about simple open combat."

patientgamers,3dymf9,Khal33t,5,Tue Jul 21 13:16:58 2015 UTC,"Despite all the negative criticism, I think I'd actually prefer RE6 by far. As far as variety goes, RE6 takes the cake in my opinion.    The enemies, characters, and environments change a lot throughout the course of the game and its pretty fun to enjoy the (sometimes hilariously nonsensical) story from different perspectives as it goes on. Only one time did I really get annoyed at the game for being unintuitive (there's a part with a snowmobile whose controls are wonky as hell)  I'm a long time fan of the Resident Evil series, remembering a time where I would watch my siblings play the game and be too scared to look away, or even want to go to the bathroom for fear of zombies eating me.   At this point, though, RE is so far removed from its roots that its not even a funny joke to try and compare them from their old counterparts.   Going into either 4, 5 or 6 isnt the same experience as 1-Code Veronica and should honestly be treated as separate series altogether. If I had to choose from all three, I'd choose 4. But between 5 and 6, I'd stick with 6."
patientgamers,3dymf9,Khal33t,2,Mon Jul 20 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I'm definitely not looking for old school resident evil. I want an action game. Varied environments and enemies are more important to me than plot. So far I'm probably gonna buy 6. Unless something changes my mind."
patientgamers,3dymf9,Mazgazine1,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, action is what the new Resident Evils are all about nowadays unless you count revelations as greatestname mentioned, which does a decent job of bringing RE back to its roots.

patientgamers,3dymf9,the_frickerman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"I would say RE5 is FAR better in all facets.  RE5 has an actual upgrade system.   nventory is WAY easier to use.  No pills.  no TRIPPING.  Not filled with dozens of QTEs .  IMO - better story (for a RE game its easy though)  IMO - much more replayable because of upgrade system and skill point gather for inifnite ammo and stuff  Me and friend slogged through RE6 years after playing RE5, we went back to RE5 last week, started fresh saves and it was awesome.   **Yes i know you can't move and shoot but, it was still better even with the change in Re6 to move"
patientgamers,3dzbcb,Aznmofofosho,5,Mon Jul 20 19:20:07 2015 UTC,I'd go with GTA5 even if it costlier. Just so much content in that game. It's like 20 games in one.

What got me back on track was, as you recommend, focusing on the games with short duration (max 10-15 hours to beat). Games like Skyrim, Wasteland 2 or similar stuff with 80+ hours of gameplay just sort of intimidated me and kept me from playing anything but league for a time.

Here's an example:  Currently playing:   Final Fantasy XIII-2 Mass Effect 1 Deponia (only playing at work)   Besides those, I have some ""standard"" games, that I am playing all the time. They're usually multiplayer games:   Dota 2 Age of Empires 3 Magicka     Since I've started doing this, I've gotten lots of achievements, finished games, and money. Yes, money. All the cards I got, I sold on the market.

patientgamers,3dtsjn,Dronelisk,61,Sun Jul 19 12:30:31 2015 UTC,"Think Sim City meets Minecraft. You start with 7 dwarves and whatever stuff you decide/can afford to bring.  All the worlds are procedurally generated using actual geological simulation (the math behind DF is insane because one if not both the guys who make it are PhD Mathematicians). You pick a spot and strike the earth!  As time passes and you start to accumulate some wealth other nearby civilizations will contact you. Dwarves will immigrate to your fort, Humans and (filthy tree-hugging) Elves will establish trade. Kobolds will attempt to steal stuff (including children) and Goblins may raid or even lay siege to your fort.  Deep below each area also lies the caverns. They can be full of riches but piercing into them allows for Megabeasts and Forgotten Beasts to show up. Monstrous creatures with sometimes terrifying powers and attributes (i.e. boiling water for blood).  DF is the game that wrapped itself in the slogan ""Losing is fun!"". The best stories are not how the fort kept going for eternity, but the often insane string of events that spell your downfall."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,the_frickerman,17,Sun Jul 19 13:15:04 2015 UTC,"It's a roguelike strategy-type game where you control an expedition of dwarves and try to make a fortified underground home for them. They'll need a food supply, a military, an economy, a bureaucracy... a lot. They'll need a lot. It's terrifyingly complicated, has an insanely steep learning curve, and is basically absent of an end game. You just play until all of your dwarves die, and they always do. Maybe goblins will kill them, maybe some fucked up demonic creature will tear them to shreds, maybe a dwarf will go insane and murder his compatriots with a bowl.  Dwarf Fortress is the most complex game I've ever played, hands down. It's really hard to get into, but hey, it's free, and there are plenty of guides online, and once you kind of get the hang of it it's a hell of a lot of fun."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,the_frickerman,3,Sun Jul 19 14:31:01 2015 UTC,I feel calling it roguelike is a stretch. Procedurally generating a random terrain for an economic/strategic building predates Rogue by quite a while.

patientgamers,3dtsjn,Owyn_Merrilin,7,Sun Jul 19 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"Boatmurdered was created at the time there were no Z-levels, and the mountain was always to the east of the Dwarves. There would always be, in order, open fields, a river, more open fields, then mountain - then as you went through the mountain you would eventually find a chasm, a lava river, and at the furthest edge you would find the rarest metal and THINGS WHICH SHOULD NOT BE FOUND which would ultimately end the game automatically because, like the Dwarves from Tolkein the game is inspired by, ""The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness... shadow and flame.""  Nowadays there are multiple terrain levels, verticality and gravity, real pits and wells, water pressure physics, birds which dive down and fly up and caverns and aquifers below the ground. The position of rivers and mountains and minerals depend on the world you generate and the site you choose within it, and mechanics like training, medicating, even basics like farming are far more complex than they ever were in the relatively straightforward days of Boatmurdered."

patientgamers,3dtsjn,Stoic_Scoundrel,8,Sun Jul 19 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not going to try and convince you. What I will tell you is how I got into Dwarf Fortress.  When you're playing a new game, there are two types of new games you can play, games that are familiar, and games that are odd.  For a game that is Familiar, think of a First-Person game or Real-Time-Strategy game that you like to play.   In a new FPG, like Half-life or The Elder Scrolls, you know that you are likely to move around using WASD while looking around with your mouse. In addition, you are likely to interact with the game world using the mouse buttons, or E on the keyboard.  In a new RTS, like Starcraft or Dawn of War, you know that you are likely to control your units and interact with the world using your mouse primarily, while your keyboard is only used for hotkeys for specific commands.  While these games may be innovative on their own, they are still part of tried and true gaming genres with tried and true command sets.  Then you have odd games, with throw almost everything tried and true about familiar games out the window.  A good example of an odd game is Kerbal Space Program. Its not so odd because of its command set, but rather, because of what you're trying to do in the game. In KSP, you're trying to build a rocket from various parts that will first get into orbit without blowing up, then get anywhere else in the kerbol system you want to go with out running out of fuel. Because it is the first of its kind, the odd command set is simply a side-effect.  Dwarf Fortress, is an ODD game. It relies exclusively on the keyboard to input commands, and refuses to do anything else. You don't directly control your dwarfs, but instead you give them a list of orders, and tell them who can do which and what order. Then it is up to the dwarfs themselves to decide who will do which and what order, then do it. it is also very information dense, to the point where you have to have played a lot to be able to take in what is happening on the screen in one glance, and even then, you don't know everything that is going on.  The only way you can truly enjoy an ODD game like Dwarf Fortress, is to forget everything you thought you know about how to play games. Then approach it like a baby learning his first word.  In other words, you have to accept the game on its own terms. Only then will a whole new world of opportunity open up to you."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,rlbond86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"My problem with Dwarf Fortress is that, in terms of the kind of functions the interface serves, it's really nothing new. There have been games with the same basic control needs since at least the original Sim City. But instead of building on a tried and true interface design, Dwarf Fortress has controls that are arbitrary even by text based roguelike standards. I can wrap my brain around Nethack's controls, but not Dwarf Fortress's."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,gjallerhorn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:25 2015 UTC,I appreciate your enthusiasm!
patientgamers,3dtsjn,jsfsmith,2,Sun Jul 19 23:32:40 2015 UTC,"well, thanks! if you want, go to /r/dwarffortress to read about interesting dwarf fortress stories."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,-Knul-,3,Mon Jul 20 05:37:06 2015 UTC,"I love everything about DF but I play it only occasionally. My main and only problem is that, just like Minecraft, it is too open ended. I love open games, but if there is no feedback on how well I'm doing, I quickly stop having fun."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,frogbertrocks,10,Mon Jul 20 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"I really want to enjoy it, but it's just too damn complicated and the graphics are unbearable."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,crabber338,5,Mon Jul 20 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"If ASCII is unbearable to you now, start playing a few games with more beautiful and easy to decipher ASCII, like Dungeon Crawl, or Brogue. Then come back, and it'll make a lot more sense."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,neko,4,Mon Jul 20 03:04:56 2015 UTC,Oh man brogue is awesome. I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in roguelikes.
patientgamers,3dtsjn,Shaggy_One,3,Sun Jul 19 15:37:51 2015 UTC,Or just use a sprite pack like most players do.
patientgamers,3dtsjn,neko,4,Sun Jul 19 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you can download tilesets for the ""graphics"" issue."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,Stoic_Scoundrel,3,Sun Jul 19 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"Download the Lazy Newb Pack (LNP) from the /r/DwarfFortress sidebar! That comes with several of the best tilesets,  which change the graphics from ASCII to nice 2D sprites. It also has a few other standard goodies, like a tool for assigning professions to your dwarves in mass.  There's also guides (including the great Quick Start Guide) in the same sidebar that worked really well for me."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,Walican132,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:03 2015 UTC,It's fun but I wish every game didn't end in FPS death.
patientgamers,3dtsjn,pilgrimboy,3,Sun Jul 19 15:52:49 2015 UTC,"There are a few tricks to avoid fps death but they usually involve either limiting the size of your fortress, the number of dwarfs you have, or using dfhack to ""clean up"" your fortress (dwarves tend to leave their old clothes all over the place, for instance). Even so, I would agree that this is my main gripe."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,zhrike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:32 2015 UTC,Yeah there are tricks. But I dream of having a massive fortress! And Toady just doesn't care about optimization...

patientgamers,3dtsjn,0342narmak,2,Mon Jul 20 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"One of the finest games ever made, irrespective of price or genre.   Also, it's way easier and more intuitive than everyone thinks. There isn't a ""learning cliff."" Rather, there's a learning leap, which looks like the Grand Canyon, but is actually a rather large puddle. It takes a bit of a leap to get over the puddle, but the leap itself is nowhere near as difficult as mustering the courage to make the leap - and once you're over, everything is smooth and easy."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,GRIMMnM,2,Mon Jul 20 02:19:25 2015 UTC,"Tried it, but gave up on it. Its user interface is agressively unfriendly and the creator has no intention to fix it in the foreseeable future."
patientgamers,3dtsjn,windexo,7,Mon Jul 20 02:20:56 2015 UTC,It's only free if your time costs nothing.

patientgamers,3dtsjn,0342narmak,3,Sun Jul 19 16:36:49 2015 UTC,There's also Captain Duck's tutorials on youtube. It's really long but you can probably get started playing after only watching a few of the basics.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouDiKXYeqeY&list=PL0sBhCMFBvPlF7wG7OH-NFQKMeCQiS8aM

patientgamers,3dvsk3,GRIMMnM,2,Sun Jul 19 23:08:52 2015 UTC,"It's only 6MB so download it and try it out.  It should give you an idea if you'd be interested in seeing where it goes or not, though if you are interested in it you still might not want to get that involved since it's going to take so long to finish.  This isn't really a support group topic though since a support group is for newly released games at full price that are tempting you, like when Fallout 4 releases there will probably be support groups since people will really want to play it but can't justify spending the money on it at release."
patientgamers,3dvsk3,rarelypost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:14:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer. I knew it wasnt really support group material but i wasnt really sure where else to post it. I think i'm going to download it and give it a go.
patientgamers,3dub5t,WizardryAwaits,11,Sun Jul 19 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"Games based around multiplayer aren't usually the best idea to be patient with.  And at $20, it's still cheaper than most AAA titles after a couple of years.  Definitely one worth picking up ASAP."
patientgamers,3dub5t,junkit33,19,Sun Jul 19 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"If you really think you'd enjoy the game and would play it enough to justify the price without getting bored of it then go ahead and pick it up.  Not all games need to be bought on sale, especially multiplayer centered ones like Rocket League.  It's only $20 also, so not a huge expense when it comes down to it.    The only negatives I see are that each match is only 5 minutes, which some people might not like, and the game's community will probably dry up in a few months once everyone moves on to the next big game after getting bored of playing this one."
patientgamers,3dub5t,rarelypost,18,Sun Jul 19 16:41:38 2015 UTC,You make a convincing argument. I'll buy it.  Edit: I love this game. No regrets.
patientgamers,3dub5t,rarelypost,4,Sun Jul 19 16:56:21 2015 UTC,Also if you get into multiplayer games later you probably won't have as much fun since people who are pros and have been playing for months will murder you constantly.  I think they set a good price point for it and it's worth it if it's your type of game.  Hope you have fun playing it.
patientgamers,3dub5t,TaylorHammond9,-3,Sun Jul 19 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"If you are really nervous, be patient and buy it 2nd hand. There's a lot of subs where you could get it for about $15-$16."

All that being said, this game look like serious fun.  Possibly the most entertaining looking $20 multiplayer game I've seen.    I haven't really been tempted in a long time.  I think the last time I spent $20 on a game was Unreal Tournament 2004.  But I'm tempted by this!"
patientgamers,3dub5t,insan3soldiern,3,Mon Jul 20 01:55:38 2015 UTC,It's 20 bucks though? That's pretty cheap.
patientgamers,3dub5t,ryannayr140,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:26 2015 UTC,I walked my ass to the convenient store and bought a $20 steam giftcard (tax free) and downloaded the game after watching only a few minutes of youtube footage.  I've already got my money's worth.
patientgamers,3dub5t,bnics,2,Mon Jul 20 03:14:15 2015 UTC,I bought it right away for $20. I knew I was going against usually buying games on sale but I had some money to spend and said screw it why not. I put in about 20 hours in the first weekend I owned it so I don't regret the purchase. My theory was that if you get an hour of entertainment for every dollar you spend on a game its worth it. So the game was worth it within the first week. I also have friends to play it with and that makes it twice as fun!
patientgamers,3dub5t,Alex__V,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"It's also my first full-price purchase in a long while. Wow is it worth it - sensational game imo, destined to be the next big e-sport I think. Couldn't recommend it any more highly."

patientgamers,3dtt83,Prah2013,5,Sun Jul 19 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you, ill probably go for this option. Does GOG have sales often in the same vein as steam?"
patientgamers,3dtt83,mandlar,4,Sun Jul 19 16:52:39 2015 UTC,They were just on sale during their summer sale (both gog and steam).
patientgamers,3dtt83,Prah2013,4,Sun Jul 19 17:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they usually have weekend deals and such."
patientgamers,3dtt83,dougmc,5,Sun Jul 19 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"The EE does add some additional player characters and a new module to play, but beyond that most of what it does is the same things that all the freely available patches will do for you.  (The extra content is OK, but nothing Earth shattering.  The community patches can be a bit of a pain to install, but not that bad.)  The best deal for BG was the Master's Anthology at Gamer's Gate which had all the BG, Planescape Torment and Icewind Dale games for $4 at its best sale, but it seems to be gone now.  I don't remember if the physical BG2 required one of the CDs to be in the drive while playing or not -- if so, that might be a reason to avoid it.  The BG2 EE hits $5 when on sale, so you could get that if you wanted.  If you do buy the CDs, make sure you get the Throne of Baahl too -- it's very good and you do want it.  (It's included in the EE.)  Either way, unless you want to do the eBay thing and get the CDs now ... GOG as was suggested is a good choice.  But wait for a sale if you're patient."
patientgamers,3dtt83,stlobus,2,Sun Jul 19 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. I'll probably give the EE a miss, so now its just deciding between physical and digital.

The one caveat is that only three of its eventual five episodes have been released thus far, and the developer has been veeeeeeerrryy slow in releasing them.  Episodes 2 and 3 were released about a year apart.  Episode 3 released over a year ago, and I haven't even heard about a release date for Episode 4 yet.  That said, in my opinion just Episodes 1-3 is still totally worth the $12 or so that you can get it for on sale.  It's a really unique game in terms of its art style and overall tone."

patientgamers,3dvgmg,aqeeliz,3,Sun Jul 19 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"Assassin's Creed 2 and its two sequels are some of my most memorable gaming from the last generation of consoles. Ezio was such a cool character that I loved playing as. I rarely 100% games but I did for those three. I haven't really been able to enjoy any of the other AC games besides 4 (and that's mostly because 4 had super fun Naval missions) because the characters just don't come close Ezio. I highly recommend putting more time into it.   Sleeping Dogs was pretty fun, but easily forgettable after said and done IMO."
patientgamers,3dvgmg,McMurphyCrazy,3,Mon Jul 20 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure 2 hours is necessarily enough for AC2, like many open world games, the start is a bit slow. How far in the story have you got after 2 hours?  They're both great games. I think AC2 is the better game, so I'd give it a bit longer to appeal to you. Although I'd say Sleeping Dogs is easier to thrash through quicker."
patientgamers,3dvgmg,onemanandhishat,4,Mon Jul 20 01:40:48 2015 UTC,"Both are games that you should play at some point, but I'd have to give the edge to Sleeping Dogs.    Not knocking AC2, but I felt Sleeping Dogs was the more satisfying game overall.  More varied side activities, easier to comprehend story, and a better conclusion."
patientgamers,3dvgmg,SilverFirePrime,3,Mon Jul 20 13:01:37 2015 UTC,Sleeping dogs is one of my favourites.definitely give it another go. Personally I didn't have a problem with keyboard and mouse apart from a couple of missions where you have to control the speed of the car but controller is good as well
patientgamers,3dvgmg,eletricmojo,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:20 2015 UTC,"AC II is a masterpiece concerning the beauty of the cities represented there. I assure you I know Florence better than my city! It is a good game, the story is solid and it is the best saga of AC. Brotherhood is not that good, but it's the closure of the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and one you will feel the need to play afterwards."
patientgamers,3dvgmg,meninobi,2,Mon Jul 20 11:46:55 2015 UTC,"Sleeping Dogs plus Nightmare in North Point (genius DLC) and Zodiac Tournament was 30h for me.

patientgamers,3dvgmg,vfmikey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:15 2015 UTC,"I only played about 3 hours of Sleeping Dogs, but I enjoyed what I had played and after a quick check on howlongtobeat.com, both games are basically about the same length.  I finished AC2 and the ending is weird as fuck, ends on a bit of a cliffhanger and was pretty unsatisfying for me (probably why there's so much DLC for it)  So yeah, 2 hours is plenty enough to get a feel for Assassin's Creed and since you didn't like it; go with Sleeping Dogs."
patientgamers,3dvgmg,Khal33t,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"Sleeping Dogs is a revelation in open world sand box games and has a good story to boot. The melee combat is great and responsive but to me it lacked that one thing that kept me hooked, I just never felt the game was engrossing.  The Assassin's Creed series is one of my favourites and AC 2 is great, the follow up Brotherhood is one of the best in the series. AC 2 has a fantastic story that eases you in and gives you a great backdrop to the story.   Out of the two games, on a decent PC, get Sleeping Dogs because its performance on a good PC is stellar and will take your breath away. On a console AC2 is a lot of fun. If you want to do everything in the game, you'll get a solid 30 hours, for the campaign and some sidequesting, you're hitting 20 hours."

Gunstar Heros (I think was on SNES as well?) is an absolutely great platformer / shooter that really holds up.  Space Harrier, Golden Axe, and Altered Beasts are all console defining games IMO.

Wide cast of characters and the AI is good  Shining Force II - Improves upon the first one in every way, much bigger game  Shining in the Darkness - Dunegon crawler in the Shining universe, not an SPRG, I've never played, but heard mixed things  Streets of Rage and Streets of Rage 2 - Two of the best beatem ups ever  Phantasy Star 2 - One of the first 16bit JRPGs, really good story, amazing music, but it is old school tough.  You need to use a guide to get through most of the dungeons without losing your mind  Streets of Rage 3 - Very good beat em up, not as good as the first two  Wonder Boy in Monster World - ONE OF THE BEST PLATFORMERS ON THE GENESIS!  Underrated as it didnt come out in America until recently  Vectorman 2 - Awesome action game  Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium  - A very accessible JRPG, holds up well, cinematic.  Much better than playing PS2 if it isn't your thing  Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom - Red headed stepchild of the series, I've never played, heard mixed thigns  Dynamite Headdy - Very good platformer  Beyond Oasis / The Story of Thor - Zelda type adventure game"

Genre-wise, it's like the 8/16-bit Legend of Zelda games - top-down adventure game with puzzle elements. However, it has a fair bit of side quests and endless dungeon-style areas where you fight through zones of monsters for some of the best loot the game has to offer."
patientgamers,3dtiqs,Makegooduseof,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"I second this -- I always felt Beyond Oasis was one of the best-looking Genesis games, and it is a great mashup of Zelda puzzle-adventure and Secret of Mana-ish combat"
patientgamers,3dtiqs,crabbit,5,Mon Jul 20 03:37:14 2015 UTC,"Ecco the Dolphin - Great music and very moody, worth at least a quick stab. There is a particularly unexpected moment near the beginning of the game that scared the piss out of me as a kid.  Vectorman - side-scrolling platformer with some  neat weapons and very cool art style.  Eternal Champions - fighting game, played the shit out of this one with my brother back in the day but still preferred Mortal Kombat 3.  Gunstar Heroes - one of the few Genesis games that I bought on the Xbox Live Arcade when released for the Xbox 360. While it plays fine as a single-player game, Gunstar Heroes remains a co-op classic, not to be missed if you have a buddy and an afternoon to kill.  Streets of Rage 1/2, Golden Axe - side-scrolling beat-em-ups, arcade-style entertainment.  Dynamite Headdy - I knew I recognized the game but couldn't remember why until I Googled it. This was a wacky game and I don't remember much besides the ""swap heads for different abilities"" gimmick but was fun back in the day.  There are some conspicuous holes in this so-called Classic Game Pack - Sonic the Hedgehog being the most obvious - but there are plenty of gems in there nonetheless. Some games like Kid Icarus and Altered Beast have a good reputation, I just never played them myself."
patientgamers,3dtiqs,BaneJammin,2,Sun Jul 19 10:15:16 2015 UTC,"I loved altered beast back in the old days, especially because of the transformations."
patientgamers,3dtiqs,misermiser,2,Mon Jul 20 12:01:54 2015 UTC,"Golden Axe and Altered Beast were my favorite games as a kid. Gunstar Heroes is also a great run n gun and an answer to Contra. I know you said you don't like rpgs, but the Shining series are great srpgs. Beyond Oasis is kind of like a Zelda ALTTP clone if you're into that. And Flicky is a fun action puzzler.  I bought this collection for Xbox a few years ago and can say most games on it are great."
patientgamers,3dtiqs,Scratchington,2,Sun Jul 19 08:57:15 2015 UTC,I second Gunstar Heros.   Fatal Labyrinth was simple dungeon crawler which has been called one of the most cynical RPGs out there.   Eco the Dolphin is also a pretty unique game.
patientgamers,3dtiqs,fremandn,2,Sun Jul 19 09:00:36 2015 UTC,"Alien Soldier! Shit! There's no game like this. So amazing. It has two difficulty settings; ""super easy"" and ""super hard"". It's the best looking game you'll find as well as being one of the coolest. And there's a bonus cinematic thingy if you make it to the train boss without dying ;)  Also: read the text scroller in the beginning. The story is written by someone on some really good drugs."
patientgamers,3dtiqs,pastah_rhymez,2,Sun Jul 19 10:55:57 2015 UTC,"I just got the same collection on the PS3 (called Sonic's collection for some reason).  I'd recommend Phantasy Star IV if you want to try a quality RPG.  Beyond Oasis is good if you're in the mood for a Zelda like experience.  The Golden Axe games are fun, old school arcade games and they can be beat fairly quickly.  Shinobi 3 is also a very solid side scrolling action game"
patientgamers,3dtiqs,bosco9,2,Sun Jul 19 17:30:23 2015 UTC,Shinining Force 2 is one of the greatest RPGs of all time imo. I've only played a bit of PSIV but it was excellent. Both are very accessible if you're not a big RPG guy. Gunstar Heroes is one of the best action games/platformers of all time.

patientgamers,3drf0w,MTLGRRR,32,Sat Jul 18 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"Nice, enjoy!  I would re-buy the trilogy, this time for PC, if the pack came with the expensive DLCs.  I keep holding out, hoping someday they'll release an all included bundle.  Originally acquired the series, and the DLCs, on 360 (before I built my current gaming rig).    I've played through ME1 and ME2 about ten times each (must Insanity all build variations), and spent a year+ with the ME3 co-op.  Hope the series gives you as much sci-fi enjoyment as it did for me!    As far as deals goes, I don't know.  I supposed finally acquiring Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition for about $5 is giving me the most hours per dollars recently.  I getting a similar 'want to play through with all the builds' urges i got with Mass Effect."
patientgamers,3drf0w,IWasMeButNowHesGone,6,Sat Jul 18 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt they will ever release them with all DLCs, but since they haven't released the trilogy for PS4/XBox One maybe they will do something when ME: Andromeda releases. Fingers crossed."
patientgamers,3drf0w,rderekp,2,Sun Jul 19 00:55:21 2015 UTC,"Amen. When I got Dark Souls for $5 I did the exact same thing. Beat the game with a STR build. Then did a faith build. Then did a mage. Then did a coop build. Dark Souls is absolutely phenomenal in terms of options you can do. Even now, years later, I still play the game doing ""challenge runs"" without shield, or armor, or healing. I really love the game."
patientgamers,3drf0w,IAmEricc,23,Tue Jul 21 00:59:43 2015 UTC,Unfortunately EA / Bioware literally never put the DLC on sale for Mass Effect and it costs a fortune. Whereas they put the trilogy on sale quite often for serious discounts.  I've been holding out for some kind of complete set for that series for a long time and it doesn't feel like it's ever going to happen at this point.
patientgamers,3drf0w,weedbearsandpie,13,Sat Jul 18 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a nasty shock when I finished the first one and then did some digging to see if the DLC was any good, and a couple of them were pretty essential to the premise of the 3rd game.    I did not like forking over $30 for ""essential"" DLC for a game trilogy that I'd gotten really cheaply.  That EA made me do their little ""Buy points before you can make a purchase!"" dance made me furious.  The game wouldn't have made much sense otherwise, though.  Lair of the Shadowbroker and Arrival should never have been cut from the main game, and Kasumi (Stolen Memory DLC) was probably one of my favorite characters.   Also, the game fucking destroyed me.  I don't know if the Citadel DLC made it easier or harder to deal with.  It's got a goofy premise, but the dialogue is snappy and fun, and it fills in a lot of the blanks about character motivations.  Gah, I'm tearing up again.  Fucking video games, man."
patientgamers,3drf0w,VoltasPistol,3,Sun Jul 19 00:48:12 2015 UTC,I hear you on that. Especially since (at least originally?) you needed to buy their stupid BioWare points for ME2 DLC as well
patientgamers,3drf0w,zeress1,3,Sat Jul 18 22:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, silly me. I bought the trilogy and it didn't even include all the DLC for ME2. I mean no DLC for 3, that's fair enough, but the last DLC for ME2 came out a year and a half before the trilogy was even announced."

As have I.  I'm really excited to play it, but I refuse to buy an incomplete ""complete"" edition.  I really mean to vote with my wallet and hold out, there are tons of games I still haven't played yet (I do not plan to get an XB1 or PS4 for literally at least 4-5 years)."

I've put something like 200-250 hours into the two (because of mods, Steam has failed to keep track of how much time I put into FO3, so I'm guessing that one).  I bought the classical Fallout games (Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics) today for $4 on GMG, which is probably going to be one of my best deals (but I haven't played them yet, so we'll see).  A few years back, I found a collectors edition of Bioshock 2 at Walmart for $0.99. That's gotta be the single best deal I've ever found. I only got lucky because I worked there, so could quickly notice when games went on sale. It was pretty rare (only happened twice in the 4 years I worked there), but sometimes old PC games would go on sale for a couple of bucks. Mostly crap, though."

You can get it in the PS store for $10, though.  But the translation is so utterly, incredibly, phenomenally horrible (feel free to add some more adjectives there), so if you can, you should definitely get the War of the Lions remake instead, which is the same price, but requires a PSP or Vita."

I presumed it was referring to FFT, since I interpret OP's comment as only saying FFT was from this NYC shop, with the ME trilogy being from an unspecified location. But I guess it's ambiguous.  If you've never played FF, you're missing out and I whole-heartedly recommend the games. I'm not sure if I'd recommend FFT as a starting point. It's a very fun game, but has a variety of issues. I'm thinking FF X would be the best game to start with (and it's got a recent HD release for the PS3 and PS4). At $20 on Amazon for two games (FF X and X-2), it's a pretty decent price (and even cheaper used)."
patientgamers,3drf0w,the_omega99,2,Sun Jul 19 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"That's a good buy.  I love the Mass Effect games.  My best deal has been during the Steam summer sale, but I can't just name 1, there are many."

patientgamers,3drf0w,the_omega99,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, right. I'm Canadian myself, but I've come to discuss prices in USD on this site since talking about things in CDN just confuses stuff.  Also, I do most of my games shopping online, so often get a direct USD -> CAD conversion, which avoids any stores that might be seizing the chance to markup prices (a $60 USD game should be about $73 CAD).  I've also noticed that some places won't really change the price for the USD vs CAD versions by the same amount as the currency conversion rate. Eg, Amazon will sell the Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD set for $20 regardless of whether I use the American or Canadian site (ie, it's $20 USD or $20 CAD)."
patientgamers,3drf0w,10GuyIsDrunk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:44:53 2015 UTC,I definitely makes it difficult to find a bargain. It's worth noting all of the differences between stores. Like Sony charges the hiked prices ($69.99 etc) but if you buy digital you don't pay tax (or at least I haven't) so it can be a better deal than buying physically if you don't sell your games. Nintendo charges slightly hiked prices (at least when I last checked they were doing 64.99) but they do charge tax on digital sales. It's a shit show really.

patientgamers,3dsv5o,sexycarlsagan,4,Sun Jul 19 12:40:47 2015 UTC,"I play three different buy-to-play mmos regularly when I am running on Windows 7:   The things you don't enjoy about GW2 are understandable. I personally really like the skill system, so I play it despite having the same issue with it.  The Secret World is the MMO in existence with the best questing, hands down. It's impossible to find the quality of the writing anywhere else in MMOland  Despite the misgivings people had about TESO at launch, you need to play it if you're a true TES fan. Doubly so if worldbuilding is a priority for you when choosing. It has the best worldbuilding of any TES game save Morrowind, and I implore you not to judge it by the first 3-5 hours.  As far as free to play MMOs go, I'm a little odd. My favourite F2P MMORPGs all have mechanics unique to the industry, and very little else.   Planeshift is an open source project to make a compelling cross platform mmo with enforced roleplay. It's got a huge emphasis on dynamic player interaction and economy crafting in a fairly unique fantasy setting. Be warned that while it is feature packed, it is not feature complete, and is an only mildly stable alpha/beta rolling release.  The saga of Ryzom has the most compelling world of any MMO I've ever played. The writing is honestly mediocre, but the AI systems are advanced enough that animals prey upon each other, reproduce, and migrate. There's an ecology that makes GW2's idea of living world seem trivial. The world is truly as alive as I've ever seen in a game, period. It's also very focused on crafting, with two of the starting ""Classes"" (gear and skill sets, every skill is learnable in-game regardless of this choice.) being crafter and harvester.   If you end up wanting links or more information on either of the F2P options I just gave you, hit me up on the PM. I use skype, mumble, and steam to communicate if you end up wanting to play either of them. I couldn't play the B2P ones with anyone if I wanted to though, as I currently only have access to Linux"

patientgamers,3dsv5o,SorasNobodyXIII,3,Tue Jul 21 01:20:47 2015 UTC,I recommend The Elder Scrolls Online. They dropped the subscription requirement a few months ago and rebranded as TESO - Tamriel Unlimited. It only requires purchase of the base game and there is significant content available.
patientgamers,3dsv5o,hijinks_the_turtle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:55:23 2015 UTC,How is the story in that?
patientgamers,3dsv5o,Isaaczz,3,Sun Jul 19 05:15:18 2015 UTC,It's very much story-driven. One nice touch is that as you clear areas (liberate towns from zombie infestations and such) you're often praised by NPCs for doing such-and-such and it makes you feel like your actions are actually having an effect on the world (and not just scripted). There's one main storyline driving it all and many parallel quests that tie back into the main story.
patientgamers,3dsv5o,Hazz3r,3,Sun Jul 19 09:39:37 2015 UTC,"I was also going to recommend ESO. I got it in the GMG sale for $12 and it was definitely worth that. I don't know if it would have been worth $60 yet, still have a lot of story and content to see.  It reminds me a lot of SWTOR in that it's more of a single player game where you can also group with others. There are three storylines to play through, I'm definitely enjoying the one I'm on right now."
patientgamers,3dttlu,pilgrimboy,8,Sun Jul 19 11:58:22 2015 UTC,"yeah there was a real feedback loop of love for this game when it came out that hyped it up to the point where I cracked and bought the game for more than I ordinarily would have.   While the story was certainly interesting, the gameplay was very linear and shallow. The character development also lacked depth and I found myself not caring much about any of the characters.   It's worth seeing through to the end as it does have some interesting twists, but put the difficulty down and just enjoy the ride. There's no real reward in being a completionist."
patientgamers,3dttlu,Koonga,3,Sun Jul 19 12:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is the time investment for story. If I just want a story, I will read a book. I love reading.   If I want to play a game, I will play a game. I guess this one was story centered and for people who just like the story. I just can't get past me (that's the way I identify with the main character) being a total jerk.   Video games aren't a book where I can just observe the character. I'm his hands shooting people in the game. Although in this game, that seems to be the extent of it."
patientgamers,3dttlu,rarelypost,3,Sun Jul 19 12:59:49 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend playing through the game while seeing Booker and his rudeness as just part of his character and not as you.  Elizabeth's character is the highlight of the game in my opinion, so if you didn't get to her yet I'd keep playing until she appears at least."
patientgamers,3dttlu,rarelypost,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:13:35 2015 UTC,I do enjoy Elizabeth.
patientgamers,3dttlu,Levago,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she's the star of the game in my opinion and I like the way she interacts with the player and the environment.  I think the game is worth finishing up at least once, just to see it through.  It is a game that might have to grow on you as you play more though, but it's still worth getting through to see the ending in my opinion."
patientgamers,3dttlu,lacsativ,2,Sun Jul 19 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Booker's rudeness does serve a point in the story IMO (although I don't recall him being THAT bad when I played the game).  I think you'll appreciate the ending if you stick with it."

patientgamers,3dttlu,SpookyLlama,5,Mon Jul 20 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"They sacrificed the depth of the gameplay and the level design for the sake of story. It made absolute sense after finishing the Burial At Sea episodes (which are mandatory for the story and should have been included in the main game or given out for free) and after watching Noah's Retrospective of the series (massive spoilers). I won't lie, Bioshock is my favourite series of all time, but I liked Infinite the least. It's a pretty good polished game with one of the most impressive and well thought stories I've ever experienced, but it has no depth whatsoever. It has some great moments as you progress, but that cannot redeem the moments when I've felt rather bored, trying to get done with the combat, just to progress to the next plot point or area. And that's a shame."
patientgamers,3dttlu,qpdbag,4,Sun Jul 19 12:53:09 2015 UTC,"the story was where it was all at, I dredged through the terrible combat just to see how it all ended.  If only the rest of the it was up to the same par as the ending."
patientgamers,3dttlu,telios87,2,Sun Jul 19 12:41:11 2015 UTC,I was kinda wondering when it was gonna pick up and become really interesting. But once the final few hours of the story came round I couldn't put it down.
patientgamers,3dttlu,Maxsayo,2,Sun Jul 19 21:20:23 2015 UTC,Bioshock has always been about the npcs. Not saying that excuses it but all the games have been like that.

patientgamers,3dttlu,Hazz3r,2,Sun Jul 19 20:43:08 2015 UTC,Bioshock is a game I play once for the story and never come back to it.  I don't remember the personality of the main character at all but that may stand testament to the blandness of the character himself.  He's basically John everyman.
patientgamers,3dttlu,Alex__V,2,Mon Jul 20 02:20:55 2015 UTC,Booker is supposed to be an arsehole. He's not a nice guy. He's never portrayed as a nice guy and that's the whole point.

patientgamers,3dttlu,edhere,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:15:12 2015 UTC,"Well, if the draw is the story and I abhor the protagonist, wouldn't that make me think it was overhyped.  Apparently some people like that. That's okay. I guess that is where the hype came from."
patientgamers,3dttlu,twelve112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:35:45 2015 UTC,"I just find it odd that your complaint is literally over a plot device which has been used in stories for centuries, if not millennia.

patientgamers,3dttlu,randomusername_815,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:53:32 2015 UTC,But the difference is the medium. I don't have to be the anti-hero in those plays and books. I just observe. I can even dislike. But I don't like the feeling of being the one that I dislike.  It may be an excellent story. I may have enjoyed it as a book. But I don't enjoy being the actions of this rude guy.
patientgamers,3dttlu,AmuseDeath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"I think games are the perfect medium for the anti-hero, because as a player you can't help but invest in their actions. In a way it's a mark of respect for the game that you found it too powerful to continue. I can't imagine ever stopping reading a book because I felt too much empathy for a questionable character."

I loved the game and sorta wished I bought it sooner. The only complaint I have is I did not like the combat system. Bioshock 2's combat system was much better. Other than that, I liked everything about it."

Just trying to get the mage to use an AoE attack at the beginning of a fight was impossible, because the rest of the party would fucking run in and get hit by it.  A big part of it is just that I really, really, do not enjoy that kind of gameplay. But I do feel that there were certain aspects of it that are fundamentally bad design. It being so difficult to get your party to do what you want them to do is the latter.  EDIT: I played DA after having first played Mass Effect. It was similar in that you had the ability to manage your squad of players (and the narrative style was very similar). However, it was really fun. Managing what your squad didn't felt like a fun way of increasing my ability to overcome enemies, rather than an essential tedium that was required in order to not die every encounter."

You could set up for your party to do specific actions, like if someone's health fell below 50% or 25% you could have one of your mages heal that person, or if a certain enemy was attacking they'd use certain skills, those sorts of things."

I keep an eye on HowLongToBeat.com whenever I start a game so I can indeed know if the end is near, or if I'd have to play another too many hours of not-fun before the satisfaction of completion is a possibility or not."
patientgamers,3dp2o5,Nawara_Ven,5,Sat Jul 18 07:01:00 2015 UTC,"Funny, isn't it? I remember reading PCGamer and GameInformer mags for days on end when I was a kid, and being overly excited about games that touted 12-20 hours of gameplay. That was mindblowing to us back then. For whatever reason, that particular selling point was latched on to by the gaming industry, and has been taken to an excessive extreme. Single-player games these days can have upwards of 200 hours of content, which will be spread so thin that the game suffers as a whole. I think designers need to keep in mind a few key concepts:   First time players and inexperienced gamers will never pick your game up again if they do not enjoy the first few hours of play. Plan your tutorial, progression system, and plot timeline accordingly. The gamers who do enjoy milking every hour of content out of a game are largely ""hardcore gamers"" or pre-existing series fans, which make up only a portion of your audience. Hours of content do not directly translate into hours of enjoyment. You can include 400 hours of content, but if your player only plays the game for 100 hours, you only have a 25% participation rate. Similarly, if you design your game with replayability in mind, you can create a game with only 20 hours of content that can be replayed 5 times over, and you have a 500% participation rate. Multiplayer, multiplayer, multiplayer. The easiest source of replayability is to pit players against each other. But not every game needs multiplayer, just as not every game needs 200+ hours of content, or procedural generation, or RPG-influenced progression systems, or minigames, or an ingame economy, etc. Sometimes it is simply better to scale it down and focus on your selling points."

It's especially irritating with games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengence that are clearly meant to be re-played for the full experience if you're into that, otherwise the game is simply respecting your time.  That's another thing about researching game-length... often I just won't buy a game that's too long."

I play on legendary now and don't use Block or Paralysis.  Combat is all about timing for me, evading all attacks and landing those couple of needed massive charging power attacks (when i'm not fire-maging for the variety that is).  No it's not Dark Souls level of skillfully timed combat, but it's enough for me to enjoy while taking in the sights.   Meanwhile when I played my first Sneak character, I got bored of moving so slowly all the time in such a big open-world and how easy it was sneaking attacking the motionless foes that haven't 'activated' yet as they do once they see the player.  Sure the slow movement can be mitigated at higher levels, but I personally find stealth more satisfying in more stealth-oriented games.  That said, I'm sure I'll revisit a stealth dovakiin at some point.

She used the least interesting and most obvious analogies such as the ""traitorous tears on her face betrayed her"". Yes, we know they betrayed her, that's what traitorous means! She also only had five or so adjectives to describe everyone she used constantly - Edward's smoldering eyes is something I will never forget for how often she repeated it. The story's descriptions also never makes any sense; for example, Bella describes herself as clumsy and unattractive but she never displays any clumsiness and every boy immediately falls for her (Edward, Jacob, and some normal kid in school). Ultimately it's a decent story with awful writing, which makes it bad but not terrible. And you can hand wave away a lot of flaws if you blame it on an unreliable teenage narrator, although that doesn't make reading it any more enjoyable.

I have a very small category on Steam: ""Completed"", when I've finished a story of a game and may have even done a lot of the extras.  Then there's the ""Stalled"" category.  When I've given a game a decent chance, and really enjoyed it, but eventually realized I haven't fired it up in quite a while, and I either need to practice the game mechanics to get good at it again, or I have no idea where I am when it comes to the story, said game enters the black hole of the Stalled category, never to return again.  But then sometimes I think to myself: ""Hey, I remember that game was really fun, and I haven't played an FPS in a while, I should fire it up again!""  Sometimes I get further.  Sometimes I stall out around the same spot.  Never once have I finished a game that I pulled out of the stalled category (but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy playing it again!)."

patientgamers,3dp2o5,ShetlandJames,3,Sat Jul 18 08:35:51 2015 UTC,I guess I'm coming from the same approach as a book or movie - the story component of a game.    I might not like the first act but I've bought a ticket so I might as well see how the movie ends - rather than walk out and miss a potentially redeeming ending.
patientgamers,3dp2o5,randomusername_815,2,Sat Jul 18 10:46:35 2015 UTC,How redeeming can an ending be? For me as a massive Bioshock fan I think gamers (wrongly) think fast the cool ending of Infinite redeems that totally generic rail shooter
patientgamers,3dp2o5,ShetlandJames,2,Sat Jul 18 11:47:16 2015 UTC,I have to agree about Bioshock Infinite. The type of game it was forces you to constantly be on the lookout for health and ammo while the killer story bubbling away in the background is almost lost. Maybe a 2nd playthrough might be in order and try to notice more of what's going on outside the combat.

It's rare that the later levels of a game are of the same quality. Finishing is often a grind, and unless the game is built around some great story, I'm not sure what difference it makes as to whether you've ""played"" or not."

That does happen. Especially when so many games these days have overly long introductory hand-holding tutorial phases.  My counter argument is that you can say that you've gotten an impression of the game after even a short amount of time. For instance, I picked up Terraria for a buck on a whim. It's pretty highly praised, looked sort of neat, and the investment was cheap. After only half an hour or so I determined that the game really just wasn't for me and I uninstalled it. I wouldn't say that I've ""played"" Terraria necessarily, but I would say that I got the impression that it just wasn't for me."

Personally, I was hyped as shit for it, and I was following it since 2012 and I thought that it was going to be the ""GTA Killer"" that it was hyped up to be.   It was my first and last preorder.   I fucking skipped school to play it on release and I was met with shitty uplay servers (to be expected), dumbed down graphics, boring gameplay, and shitty FPS (on a machine that can run skyrim with graphically intensive ENBs and mods at a solid 50~60fps). I tried convincing myself that it was good but the cracks began to show very early on (I made it maybe 15 hours in over a period of a week) and man was I fucking crushed.

Then I'll get the game later when the price is not so high and I'll see things for myself.  For this game this payed off well. I loved the game.

I'm pretty sure 90% of people don't even go the entire mission doing stealth, at some point they just say 'fuck it' and go all action  Personally I would think the awfully high difficulty in the beginning mission would be the bigger problem for players dropping it"

Fortunately, this time I realized it's because of an incredibly low field of view (75Â°) that works fine on consoles but not on PC. I modified the value in INI file to 100Â° and it was a literal a game changer. The controls were still clunky and mechanics could be better but I was finally able to enjoy the story and atmosphere. Here are two comparison shots that I made:  FOV = 75Â° (Default)  FOV = 100Â°  Now I'm in the middle of BioShock 2 where I had to make the same modification.

patientgamers,3dsn4m,meesterdave,6,Sun Jul 19 01:52:27 2015 UTC,"Probably play the second one. First one is optional. If you have it it does not hurt to play it first though.  Starting with the third one spoils a bit of witcher 2, while the first one's story is pretty one off and independent of the others(Excepts for one part at the end that becomes relevant in 3)(As far as plot goes. However several characters are seen again in the sequels.)"
patientgamers,3dsn4m,Alaskan_Thunder,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:00:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely play through both of the others, some will say the first isn't necessary but IMO it's needed for the full experience."
patientgamers,3drjzu,LucIamUrMother,13,Sat Jul 18 19:42:58 2015 UTC,Silent Hill 2 is the best.  The only one I would recommend not playing at all from the ones I've played would be Silent Hill 4: The Room.   The latest ones (Homecoming and Downpour) aren't as good as 2 and 3 but are still fun enough and worth grabbing for $10 or less.
patientgamers,3drjzu,rarelypost,3,Sat Jul 18 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, I really disagree about 4. The gameplay is definitely the weakest in the series, but, let's be honest, if anyone's playing a Silent Hill game for gameplay, they're doing it wrong. The atmosphere is just as strong as the other games, it has the best sound design of any of the games, and, if OP only cares about scares in horror games, is also arguably the scariest in the series (personally, atmosphere >>> scares IMO, but I might as well bring it up). Plots are also definitely subjective, but I personally liked it in here.  Then again, I also loved Downpour almost as much as the first two games (which I personally consider to be 5/5 material), so take my opinion with a gigantic saltshaker. Actually, take it with two of them."
patientgamers,3drjzu,MysterySushi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:56:39 2015 UTC,"I had the biggest issues with the plot and how poor it was in my opinion.  I do agree the parts in your apartment are scary and unnerving at times, but the rest was just tedious and boring and those unkillable enemies were more of a nuisance than they were scary."
patientgamers,3drjzu,rarelypost,5,Sun Jul 19 14:26:30 2015 UTC,I would say Silent Hill 2 is the best for this indeed. The third one is good as well but you would need to know the story of the first game to be able to understand it.
patientgamers,3drjzu,Prah2013,3,Sat Jul 18 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Silent Hill Shattered Memories. I feel it is underrated, even among silent hill fans. You can find it for PS2 or Wii."
patientgamers,3drjzu,Davidstan,2,Sun Jul 19 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"True, I heard it's good. Works as an alternate universe version of the first game (I know you know this, but OP might not). Also I believe it's for PSP as well."
patientgamers,3drjzu,Prah2013,3,Sun Jul 19 12:06:48 2015 UTC,"2 or 3 would be the best for you, and if you like those, try 1 as well. The only thing I can definitely recommend that others haven't already said is to avoid the HD editions at all costs. They are a buggy, poorly optimized, horribly re-casted piece of collective garbage. It would be a shame for something like that to be your first foray into Silent Hill, because it'll give you entirely the wrong impression.   If you can get a hold of the PS2/Xbox versions, though, great! Enjoy!"
patientgamers,3drjzu,Divinus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:42:33 2015 UTC,"I've played 1 through 5 and I suggest you play them in that order. The first one may be old but for me it's the best one. Silent Hill 2 is everyone's favorite. Than silent Hill 3 was kind of average for me but still OK. Silent Hill 4 was definitely different, but I'd suggest you give it a go because you either hate it or really like it. I personally enjoyed very much and thought it was original."

Saboteur is also a great game to play afterwards although you might want to save it for last since theres so much to do in that game.

patientgamers,3dqjmx,bnics,5,Sun Jul 19 01:23:25 2015 UTC,"Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a solid pick, unless you find the art style revolting.  Shovel Knight is an excellent platformer with lots of charm and tight controls.  Don't Starve is kinda 2D-ish, but not really, still a pretty solid pick that I heavily recommend. It's a survival, hunter-gathering type game so be aware.  SpeedRunners is a game with short rounds that pushes towards competitive aspect of platformers, really great if you have other friends to play with.  I think they all support windowed mode, but I can't tell it with 100% certainty, so sorry if I screwed it up."

Crypt of the Necrodancer is another good one, but the rhythm mechanic might require more attention than you can afford if you're trying to split your focus.  The PixelJunk games were designed with controllers in mind.  I have PJ Eden, and it's pretty good.  Rogue Legacy is great if you like rogue-like random dungeons.  Skullgirls is one of the best fighting games on PC.  Classic JRPGs should also fit the bill.  Breath of Death VII/Cthulu Saves the World, the Final Fantasy and other Square-Enix games on Steam, etc.  VVVVVV is another good title.

Shadowrun Chronicles is some wannabe-MMO thing made by a different developer on the cheap. Seems to be okay if you have friends to play it with, but I'd steer clear of it unless you're a fan of the setting.

patientgamers,3dpqfn,famouscomposer,9,Sat Jul 18 06:37:12 2015 UTC,"The Long Dark. Your most likely cause of death on lower difficulties will be exposure to the elements; on higher difficulties, it'll be wolves (which while aggressive I believe aren't always after you).  You need to keep eating to keep your calorie intake up; initially you'll find food in abandoned houses, but you'll need to turn to hunting after a while. Clothing can be found, but wears out and needs to be replaced/repaired. You'll be ecstatic the first time you find a gun, then realise you only have three bullets.  Hardly 'patientgamer' material as it's an Early Access game, but it's one that's been very well received."
patientgamers,3dpqfn,Relenq,6,Sat Jul 18 09:16:03 2015 UTC,"7 Days to Die might scratch this itch. It's an early access zombie apocalypse game and the world is randomly generated, so the difficulty can vary, especially at first when you're learning how everything works. But it has that 50/50 element you described.  During the day, all the zombies are slow and very manageable, unless you throw yourself into a large group of them. You spend the daylight hours scavenging for materials and (usually) building some sort of base. At night, zombies are fast and much more aggressive, but if you stay somewhere protected, you'll get by. But every 7 day, a large swarm of zombies will attack you.  It's usually described as Minecraft meets Dayz, and that's fairly accurate. You can build and destroy every piece of land and harvest just about everything you see, and there are tons of things to craft. There are lots of options to customize the game and there's an active modding scene. It's also both single player and multiplayer. If you like open world sandbox games, especially with a horror survival theme, it's worth a look.  Don't Starve is also good. You'll either like its cartoony style or not, but it is a very deep game with a great sense of exploration and lots of things to do. The difficulty ramps up as time goes by, so while you will be collecting supplies by day and defending yourself at night, it's kind of assumed that at some point you'll be overwhelmed, die, and start again with a new character. Like it's graphical style, you'll either like that or not. It throws a lot of surprises at you, so if you want to investigate it, I'd suggest not watching too many videos. There are lots of ""What the hell is THAT?!?"" moments in the game that would be best left unspoiled."
patientgamers,3dpqfn,Hitch42,3,Sat Jul 18 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"Both of those games are absolutely excellent recomendations.   7 days to die hits it spot on, you can also tweak the settings to make the zombies stronger, weaker, faster, slower, more of them, less of them, turn off infection, turn the loot spawns up etc. etc. etc.  Dont starve is also spot on, I wouldn't say it's horror but it'll definitely get your adrenaline going and it's got so much re playability.  Both these games can be played single or multiplayer."

You'll set up your hydroponic farms to grow potatoes, machines to harvest CO2 to split for oxygen, and take time to explore Mars. It is early access however and much of the construction does not take resources so I can't entirely recommend it.

I find once I'm done with the story in a game, I tend to not be interested in playing it further. Dark Souls is my top pick because it has the best combat system I've used in an action game ever, the scale of the game is enormous and there is a actually a deep and intriguing story underneath the game. PSO3 is added because it's a deck building game that also plays like a grid-based, strategy game. It uses decks, so you can really be creative and unlock tons of new cards. REmake is arguably the best game in the series and it is so because of the way they updated the graphics and added new areas and content. I tend to come back to it to play it on a harder setting or beat my fastest time, etc.  Singleplayer titles:   Dark Souls (PC) Phantasy Star Online Episode 3 (Gamecube) Resident Evil (Gamecube)   Natural Selection 2 is my FPS of choice because it combine fast-paced gameplay with area control. I like how you spawn constantly, so you don't have to wait long. Warcraft 3 is my RTS of choice because it combines the traditional RTS gameplay with RPG elements. I like how there are 4 races and lots of units to build. USF4 has a huge roster, deep gameplay and legendary balance.  Multiplayer:   Natural Selection 2 (PC) Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne (PC) Ultra Street Fighter 4 (PC)"

patientgamers,3dm7r4,redgunner57,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:29:15 2015 UTC,"It probably is - armor summoning spells were sorely lacking from the base game, especially since both Morrowind and Oblivion had them. When playing I usually use Midas Magic, it's probably from there. A google search pulled up a few other mods that include armor binding, but I didn't use them.   Even playing Vanilla though, Conjuration is extremely OP. If you sheathe your weapons after each fight, resummon them, and then enter a fight, the game counts it towards your conjuration skill. If you dual wield summoned swords, it also adds insanely to your 1-handed and (whatever armor you have) skills. It's a ton of fun to run through a bunch of enemies with an Atronach or two dual-wielding spectral swords all in a robe. (Just make sure to cast an armor spell and/or drink potions beforehand).   [Edit]: I choose to do it in just a robe, but heavy armor is arguably just as badass.   The mods that add summoned armors just add to it. Especially when used with spellcrafting mods, which let you create your own spells out of other spells like in Morrowind/Oblivion. That way, you can just be walking around all normal-like, and some skeever comes up to you - cast one spell (draining all your mana in the process) and BOOM - you're a Daedric-clad God dual-wielding spectral blades with two Atronachs by your side."

Edit: Also what's up with that leveling system in Oblivion? Seriously between just the sewers of imperial city and delivering the amulet of kings, I must have gone through 5 dungeons.

At the same time, since the enemies are generally leveled with you, you don't want to level too quickly. If you're getting fast levels off of acrobatics and athletics, and your combat skills aren't increasing proportionally, the game's gonna be harder.

patientgamers,3dm7r4,pinkythereddog,7,Fri Jul 17 13:42:21 2015 UTC,Currently playing through this and absolutely LOVING the bow in this game!
patientgamers,3dm7r4,ScottishHammer,3,Sat Jul 18 02:15:40 2015 UTC,I picked up Tomb Raider during the summer sale and decided to play it after reading this thread.  Stealth bow sniping in this game is just so much fun.
patientgamers,3dm7r4,RhazinHell,2,Fri Jul 17 14:29:33 2015 UTC,+1 great bow usage.
patientgamers,3dm7r4,FireFoxOmicron,30,Sat Jul 18 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"The Thief Games ( Thief: Gold, Thief 2: The Metal Age and Thief: Deadly Shadows ) have a Bow mechanic along with several Arrow types. :)  Examples include Water Arrows to extinguish torches, Moss Arrows to dampen sound on loud tiles and Gas Arrows to knock out Guards non-lethally."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,FireFoxOmicron,7,Fri Jul 17 15:41:06 2015 UTC,I played the first Thief when it came out long ago. How did the rest of the series stack up?
patientgamers,3dm7r4,OkayAtBowling,3,Fri Jul 17 12:32:12 2015 UTC,"I would say Thief 2 is my favourite out of the series. It's Bow mechanics are the same as Thief 1 though.  Though Thief 1 does have a more haunting atmosphere, Thief 2's level designs are much easier to navigate and the missions are designed more on Human vs Human interactions than Thief 1's more fantasy style. :) So less monsters and more guards.  Thief 3 is pretty good but a bit unstable on both Xbox and PC. Thankfully there are patches that can fix many issues. Thief 3 also has a "" open world "" approach where you go to each mission through the City which acts as a hub. Again, It's bow mechanics are a similar style to Thief 1 and 2.  Overall, I would rate them from highest to lowest as -  Thief 2 Thief 1 / Gold Thief 3.  Of course, All three are great games. :)"
patientgamers,3dm7r4,Mamitroid3,3,Fri Jul 17 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"I agree on pretty much all points.  I just wanted to point out that although I think I agree that Thief 3 (aka Thief: Deadly Shadows) is the weakest of the three, it still has some fantastic missions, including a supremely creepy level in an abandoned orphanage."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,ColdBeefPile,3,Fri Jul 17 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"Ah Shalebridge....  You play that shit in the dark with headphones on... You hear me OP?  .  EDIT:  Deadly Shadows gets a bad wrap... IMHO Thief 2 is still the best, but once you get used to the different mechanics in DS, it feels like a regular thief game.  It forced me many times into much more stealth than I had to exhibit in 1 or 2.  I actually really enjoyed DS.  Give me back the rope arrows and it'd be even closer."

patientgamers,3dm7r4,Assorted_Bits,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:21:44 2015 UTC,It's pretty much the same game but with more added. Although it has removed the tutorial and added some quests that help you get situated in the world better.
patientgamers,3dm7r4,CZtheDude,35,Sat Jul 18 11:51:52 2015 UTC,Mount & Blade Warband. Download the demo at taleworlds.com and see for yourself (the demo is the full game with a level cap at 7 IIRC).  Edit: just got a promotional mailing from gog.com that there's a damn nice discount on that title this weekend.
patientgamers,3dm7r4,Assorted_Bits,2,Sat Jul 18 13:37:18 2015 UTC,Is it worth getting the full package (3 games + DLC) or just the Warband game?
patientgamers,3dm7r4,momomo544,3,Fri Jul 17 14:47:53 2015 UTC,"I suggest asking it in /r/mountandblade, since I only play the basegame (and there's a big modding community behind it)."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,CZtheDude,5,Fri Jul 17 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"Warband and Napoleonic wars I would recommend getting. With those 2 you can play most mods as well.   The original M&B is fine, its just that warband improved almost everything.  I liked with fire and sword but its basically a warband expansion packaged as a new game."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,seifer93,2,Fri Jul 17 19:07:33 2015 UTC,Thanks!
patientgamers,3dm7r4,Attheveryend,2,Fri Jul 17 19:14:02 2015 UTC,"I second this. Warband is more complete than regular M&B and Napoleonic Wars opens a lot of mods up.   I don't really think that Fire and Sword improves things enough to warrant a purchase, and Warband (which has a lot of mods) mods aren't compatible with Fire and Sword (which has few worth downloading.) I'd say skip Fire and Sword.  It's also worth noting that Mount & Blade 2 is currently in the works. There's no ETA for now, but I don't want you guys to be blind-sided if you decide to purchase an existing M&B game and they make an announcement a week later."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,Assorted_Bits,4,Fri Jul 17 19:15:17 2015 UTC,This is the only real answer.  Mount and Blade Warband.

There are a lot of cool bow attacks for all of the bow wielding vocations: striders, rangers, assassins, and magic archers.  The combat system in general is honestly one of the best I've ever played in an RPG."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,hidora,5,Fri Jul 17 16:30:02 2015 UTC,Too bad it's not for PC. Should have mentioned I don't own any consoles.

It's such a ridiculously fun game.  Rangers are the shit as far as bows go, too. The feel and sound when you loose an arrow from those longbows is just fantastic, feels like it has more kick than most guns you'll see in video games."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,Joshorod,2,Fri Jul 17 17:02:39 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the main longbow skill (forgot the name, the one you have to stand still charging) has the perk of giving you temporary bonus strength when you time the shot properly, so you can bypass the str treshold to damage Dark Arisen enemies earlier than other classes (Warrior is the only other class that can do this with their charged attack).  I mostly play Assassin or Magick Archer, but every time I grab the Ranger, I have a blast. It just feels good to hit some heads with those powerful shots."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,jakdak,8,Fri Jul 17 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"I think my favourite bow I've ever used is the last of us' version of it. Felt so nice to use, just a shame I was shit with it so never had any damn arrows.  Tombraiders was also fun, but I didn't find it quite as satisfying without the arc through the air, it aimed more like a gun imo. You do poop ammo all game though, so you actually get to use it.  edit: I just remembered how the part of Twilight princess where you clear the town of goblins with your bow was probably the most fun I had with the wiimote in any game as well, so I wanted to mention that"
patientgamers,3dm7r4,Joshorod,2,Fri Jul 17 15:37:57 2015 UTC,I can't believe no one has mentioned Shadow of Mordor that game has some incredible bow mechanics especially in the bright lord DLC.

It also sucks even more that they actually totally could have both, yet choose not to for some reason. I may be wrong, but I can't think of any convincing reason why they wouldn't. I'm happy about splitscreen as well, though. Definitely fun to have, especially on PC (for me) since I'll be getting a 21:9 monitor, so it'll be almost perfect for having 2 ~4:3 splitscreen views :( I can dream..."
patientgamers,3dm7r4,Adsefer,2,Sun Jul 19 14:20:22 2015 UTC,Hey they might add it in the future ( I really hope so) so if it pops up on sale id buy it. Do you have no siblings or friends near that could play with you?
patientgamers,3dm7r4,dinoseen,2,Sun Jul 19 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't currently even have my PC. Being dirt poor is great. I do have a group of friends, but we barely ever hang out and it's tough enough to organise something already, not to mention it being specifically to do with games. And then, there's also the issue of not even having a machine. It just doesn't seem worth it to buy the game if I'll only get to play it a few times, anyway. Like, unless it turned out to be this super deep fun game that my friends would get as obssessive as me about, I probably wouldn't consider it worth it -no matter how much I'd like to.  EDIT: Since they're mostly older than me and we're all teenagers, too, they're all moving away (and some have always lived in different countries) so local isn't as much an option as I'd like. Some time in the future when I'm (hopefully) roommates with a friend it'll be easier, though."

patientgamers,3dnj2t,AlexxJoshee,20,Fri Jul 17 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"If you want a spoiler-free experience, then I think you don't need to know any tips.  The ""gameplay"" is a lot of different quick-time commands so you don't really need to prepare.  And your failures/successes in different events will alter the story.  To me, the fact that the story can change is a good reason to replay the game, especially if you don't get the ""best"" ending right off the bat."
patientgamers,3dnj2t,nofantasyiseverfinal,3,Fri Jul 17 18:58:11 2015 UTC,I disagree. I played it once and couldn't do it again. I found much more enjoyment watching my friends play through.
patientgamers,3dnj2t,borktheorc,2,Fri Jul 17 23:16:11 2015 UTC,"I played it once and got a very unsatisfactory ending, I was so upset at what happened that I just HAD to play it again. Watching/hearing about friends playing it was also great. But if they played a section you had not you might feel like you're missing out on a cool part of the game."
patientgamers,3dnj2t,TechnoShift,13,Sat Jul 18 02:58:34 2015 UTC,"Be warned: it's really, really depressing."
patientgamers,3dnj2t,IronMew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"The entire game is so depressing, and if you get a bad ending, it gives you such a sense of failure. I felt like that was the best part. Played it through once with a bad ending, and again with a good ending and it felt like 2 separate stories were being told."
patientgamers,3dnj2t,TechnoShift,8,Sat Jul 18 03:00:05 2015 UTC,"Tips won't be necessary, just carve your own path and see what happens with the story. You do have to look past the somewhat goofy and poorly patched together dialogue but the rest of the game is actually pretty well done."
patientgamers,3dnj2t,pizzacourier,3,Fri Jul 17 19:04:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's good to know about the dialogue going in.  It's usually adequate but not especially good.  Most distracting of all is the fact that the cast is made up mostly of French actors trying to do American accents.  I still don't understand why they did that.  I know the developer is based in France but if you know you're going to have to use French actors, why not just set the game there?  At any rate, it's still worth playing.  It's similar in general gameplay to Telltale's more recent games like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.  Although I think those games are better mostly just due to superior writing, Heavy Rain does do more than Telltale's stories in terms of your choices actually having some pretty major effects on future events."
patientgamers,3dnj2t,OkayAtBowling,5,Fri Jul 17 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"After you finish the game once, there's a chapter select option that lets you go through each decision in the game. Don't overthink it, just play it"
patientgamers,3dnj2t,ChemLok,3,Fri Jul 17 19:05:17 2015 UTC,JUST DO IT.
patientgamers,3dnj2t,Coup_de_BOO,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"It's a very ambitious game, in that every choice you make affects the outcome, and there's no such thing as a ""game over, reload your save"" moment. The game determines the final plot based on who's left alive and which path you've taken, so different characters live or die on different playthroughs, the killer can be a different person on different playthroughs, and the killer can even get away with it consequence-free.  The trouble with that approach is that it tends to create red herrings, false leads, and plot holes. Sometimes dialogue or plot doesn't hook up properly, or things get forgotten when you make a choice with a big effect. For example, in my playthrough, one character was being built up as being the killer but unaware due to mental illness, and other characters suspected as much and were moving against that person... and it went nowhere and turned out to be someone else, and the implied mental illness disappeared without further reference, despite its severity. On the other hand the killer reveal in that playthrough worked beautifully and made perfect sense.  There aren't really any spoiler-free tips that can be given, since every choice, action, or non-action alters the outcome in subtle ways that build up over the course of the game. The only tip I can really give you is not to second-guess yourself or worry about the optimal choice, because that's just not productive with this kind of game.  Oh, and maybe keep some adorable cat photos on hand, because the game's pretty dark."
patientgamers,3dnj2t,szthesquid,2,Fri Jul 17 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"If you can, play with the PS Move controls. It actually made the game more interesting to me. The controls worked really well for that type of game.   If you don't have the move, at LEAST play on hard mode. The controls are relatively simple to get into, and easy/normal is no where near as fun/scary as hard mode is on that game. It really makes you feel fear/stress the characters go through in some of the sections.  Give it at least 2 playthoughs, one where you play and just let things happen, and one ""perfectionist"" playthrough. There's a few chapters that don't unlock unless you do specific things. If you get a really bad ending it's not really that satisfying honestly and will leave you kinda ""What the hell was that crap?"" You'll really want to see what happens if you didn't screw up.   There was a bunch of people saying the whole ""one shouldn't replay the game for different endings"" but that's not really true. Heavy rain is wonderful, and worth playing more than once. It's not long enough to warrant only 1 playthrough. The endings are different enough and there are a few extra missions that will make it worth playing more than once. Also, the creators did such a fantastic job on that game despite the minor plot holes, why not play all they had to offer?   Try not to analyse the game too much, play it for what it is. There's a few things that happen that never get explained and that create plot holes, but all around the story is great. After beating it I kept reading stuff online about it and it kinda made me think the game was mediocre because of the plot holes. Buuuuut it's really a fantastic game for what it is.   Annnnnnnnd now I want to play it again."

Basically, he gets natural armor equal to his level so if the armor you give him gives more than that....  Also, sounds like RNGsus is not happy with you. HP growths are partially random (always get some, sometimes get more based on class) and I believe (but have not confirmed) that monks have a higher chance than thief for high HP growth. There are items to fix that, but the monk really doesn't get into his own until ~16. Also, he is your only Haste and Temper target."

Prior to that point, in my experience, they just seem to do better with nunchucks, though they still miss a lot.  Once they get to the badass point though, they do much better without nunchucks.

The game does a good job of trying to make you feel bad for pursuing a selfish goal at the expense of 16 innocent lives. The framing, the cut scenes after each boss, the dialogue, and the way the temple looks are all signs something is amiss and I, as a player, just ignored them and pressed on. I very much appreciate the game design choices made.   I'm not entirely sure how it would translate as a movie but I would love to see a next gen version or a similar style game that's not 10 years old.

I didn't look up how to fight or kill any of the bosses so when I found out, I was pretty taken back. There's no cliche. No sterility. It's a game with a distinct, honest artist's voice that rings through in every facet of the design. Sure, it's a bit dated. But does that mean it isn't worth the time?

This was done due to influence from producer Koji Igarashi, who wanted to market the game to a younger audience.[7] Aria of Sorrowâ 'âs sales figures did not meet expectations, and as a result, Igarashi consulted Konami's sales department. The staff concluded that the demographics of the Game Boy Advance did not line up with the series' target age group.[44] Igarashi believed that the Nintendo DS inherently attracted a younger audience, and he was working to court them with the anime style.[44][45] Furthermore, Igarashi considered the anime style a litmus test for whether future Castlevania games would incorporate it.[46] Kojima's hiatus was also to allow her to concentrate upon her character designs for Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.[7][44]"

patientgamers,3dlb01,andylongchonged,8,Fri Jul 17 04:51:50 2015 UTC,"Quoting /u/Whitestep's reply from a similar thread two years ago:   RPGs (the PSP has a good quantity of quality titles):  Persona 3 Portable: A Persona 3 port. Has no 3D models whatsoever, except when you are in dungeon mode, but it's awesome and the streamlined menus really nail it. Features an extra female main character storyline.  Monster Hunter: You've probably already heard about this. Monster huntan and forging weapons from materials. The best iteration is 2G (Freedom Unite in the west) and Portable 3.  Gods Eater Burst: In the vein of MH but anime-ish and somewhat futuristic. I actually like it better than MH for the faster pacing and the somewhat interesting plot.  Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII: This is some of the best you can get on the PSP as far as an RPG experience goes. It's the backstory of FFVII and has a compelling story, a very emotional ending and lots of eye candy. The battle system gets a bit dull if you go for the sidequests, but the materia system is alright.  Disgaea 1 and 2: It's one of the best SRPGs out there with fantastic humor, solid gameplay and, I cannot stress it enough, over the top mechanics. If you're looking for a quick-bursts game and no serious involvement you might hate the depth and the grinding though.  Final Fantasy Tactics: The War Of The Lions: If you're in for a deep storyline, with superlative plot twists, lovable characters involving politics and what-not, while keeping interesting gameplay, you're gonna enjoy the hell out of it. It's an enhanced port of the PSX game.  Half-Minute Hero: Do you remember the good ol' 8-bit pixel sprites? Well, this whole game is a homage to that era. The graphics, the music, everything. All around funny, entertaining story, and astounding gameplay that will blow your mind when you start getting to ridiculous levels of packed-in-30-seconds action.  Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep: One of the best games made for the PSP, it's Kingdom Hearts and it's accessible because you can start working your way up in the series from here. Win-win-win situation.  Cladun: This is an RPG!: It's some sort of a roguelike game with lots of randomly-generated dungeons and an interesting re-birth system. It's not for eveyone though.  Ys Seven and Oath of Felghana: The first one is a standalone iteration of Ys and has an amazing gameplay and a great soundtrack. If you know Ys you know the drill, Adol rescuing the world and such. Oath is arguably more difficult and has a different type of gameplay but is super recommendable too.  The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky: This is somewhat of an old game (it was released in like 2006 in Japan but localized late in the PSP life in the west) so the graphics feel a bit dated, but it has an amazing plot and a lot of character development. If you can stand going through the first three chapters (which take about 5 hours or more alone) you're in for a hell of a ride.  Patapon, all of them, arguably 2 is the best: Get your niggabros and drum to make them go to destroy and conquer, you've probably heard about this and it's good as it seems.  Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth: Oh god yes, the best port ever. Enhanced port from the PSX version. 2D scrolling RPG with a 4 button combo system in pseudo real-time. An amazing random story (you can play twice through and not get the same story). Ditch Easy entirely and go to Normal or Hard, it's actually easier because you get better items. One of my favorite games ever.  Miscellaneous genres:  DJ Max series: It's some sort of Beatmania DX clone, but plays awesomely on the PSP and it's got the GOODS man. My favorite series on the PSP hands down. A lot of content. Stay somewhat away from Portable 3, it's not really a solid entry. (Some people would burn me for this).  Taiko No Tatsujin: It's the Taiko Drum Master game for the PSP. The DX iteration has a huge amount of content and DLC available, which is amazing. Awesome game. Only in japanese, you don't really need it though.  Echochrome / Echoshift: Puzzle games with interesting dimension and time changing mechanics. Pretty challenging and super interesting.  Me & My Katamari: A PSP entry of the Katamari series. You gotta play with the arrows and right buttons pad, but it's a solid game by itself, not a port. Ball rollan and that stuff.  Mawaskes: A cute-y puzzle game with triangles. It's pretty small, like 100 MB, and it's nice for quick bursts.  Lumines 1 and 2: A side scrolling puzzle that flows with the music. If you don't know what it is about is one of the best puzzle games ever. Tetris pales in comparison. Check that shit out.  Work Time Fun!: Like WarioWare for the PSP with random games. Interesting once you unlock a lot of more complex minigames.  Corpse Party / Hakuoki: Visual Novels, if you're into that stuff.  Gitaroo! Man Lives: A weird game involving some sort of rhythm gameplay wirh weird music and weirder mechanics. Pretty lovable though.  Project Diva + Project Diva 2nd: Hatsune Miku, rhythm game, Vocaroido kawaii desu stuff. It's actually a pretty decent rhythm game.  Racing games:  Wipeout Pulse / Pure: If you've played Wipeout Fury/HD on the PS3 this is moreless the same game, fast paced, hard as fuck to master and gorgeous visuals and music.  Gran Turismo PSP: It's just Gran Turismo, no point explaining this one. Need For Speed: Carbon / Most Wanted: Incredibly casual but it's a good racing game for the PSP.  Adventure/Action/Platformer games:  God Of War, both games: God Of War on the PSP, blood action and all that. Runs at 333 Mhz so it drains your battery in exchange for amazing graphics. Solid entries.  Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops / Peace Walker: I'm not really a MGS fan, but everyone says these are pretty good. Especially Peace Walker.  Assassin's Creed Bloodlines: Believe it or not, this is actually a pretty good game. Side-story to the main line of games, but preddy good regardless.  Dead Head Fred: You're a guy without a head. Adventures. Nuff Said.  Loco Roco 1 and 2: It's a cute pastel world platformer with a really interesting mechanic, you turn the world with L/R shoulder buttons to get your baddies to the end of the level. Super atmospheric stuff.  The Third Birthday: Parasite Eve rebirthed. I'm actually hesitant about this and it's genre, but it's a good game if you can get past some irking stuff SqEnix put into the game to make it more appealing. Third Person Shooter and Aya Brea.  Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles: I haven't finished this, but it's freaking Castlevania and a pretty good game. Some people love it some hate it.  Daxter: Spin-off from the Jax and Daxter series. Good ol' platformer with some really good moments.  Jak & Daxter: The Lost Frontier: Same as above. but it's actually a sequel.  GTA: Chinatown Wars: 2D isometric view like GTA2. Pretty good game. Still GTA.  GTA: Liberty City Stories / Vice City Stories: Spin-offs from the main GTA games. Still GTA.  Fighting games:  Dissidia, both the original and Duodecim: Mash buttons and get it on with FF characters. Better than it sounds and it's a refreshing battle-system. Not really what a traditional fighter plays like.  Street Fighter Alpha 3: Everyone and their mother has played this. Exactly the same as the PSX/2 version.  Darkstalkers Chronicle: Enhanced port from the PS2 version.  BlazBlue: Awesome 2D fighter, you have two versions. Arguably Calamity Trigger is best.  Guilty Gear XX: Bloody complicated 2D fighter, at least for me, never could get the hang of it. Most people love it and say it's an awesome entry for the PSP.   I agree with everything he said in this post, especially when it comes to RPGs, though I would also add:   Jeanne D'arc: I'm playing this right now on my PSP emulator (my PSP died some time ago) and it's really fun and a good place to start if you have never played Strategy RGPs or Tactics games before.  Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together: This one I haven't played yet, but it's regarded as one of the best PSP games ever released. It's really hard (often compared to FF Tactics in terms of difficulty) so don't get it until you have at least some experience with tactics and srpg games."

If MH feels too slow or MMO-ish for you, try this out. MGS: Portable Ops has an expansion called Portable Ops Plus, but it has nothing plot-related (like, not even a story mode in general) if you're interested in that. Lumines 1 is pretty much perfect. 2 would almost be at that level, but the NA (and maybe European) releases added some... questionable stuff to it. Such as The Black-Eyed Peas, who totally don't fit in with the soundtrack at all (oh, and you can't end their track (along with the other MV tracks) early no matter how good you are). I have no idea if the Japanese version has the shit parts of the soundtrack in it, but I'd look into importing that if you like 1. The Project Diva games are Japan-only, but the menus are incredibly easy to navigate and figure out. I enjoy the first game well-enough, but I'd recommend importing 2nd and, if you like that, importing Extend afterwords (which has some tracks from 2nd, but also updates various tracks from the first game to add the gameplay mechanics that were introduced in 2nd). The Dracula X Chronicles also has the original version of Rondo of Blood (which I personally prefer over the remake), translated into English for the first time, and Symphony of the Night.   I'd also like to suggest the first two Persona games and Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle, and I'll also second the Mega Man remakes that someone else suggested in another post.  It's so nice to see an actual list of games get recommended to someone! Usually when someone asks for good PSP games, the answers are usually either ""Persona 3"" and only that (which I can understand, because it's amazing), or ""MOD THAT SHIT AND EMULATE SNES GAMES"" (which is also understandable because portable SNES) while forgetting that the system actually has some great stuff on it (and I fear that the Vita will suffer a similar fate what with emulators being developed for that as I type this)."

patientgamers,3djiqs,Mr_Happy327,12,Fri Jul 17 15:48:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's an overlooked shooter: Chaser, currently $1.24 on Steam.  And overlooked for good reason: It's not a particularly good game. I mean, I played through the whole thing ten years ago, so it's certainly playable. It's clunky and awkward, with some foisted mechanics, like a stupid stealth level early on (the most annoying part of the game for me) and a Max Payne-wannabe bullettime... which was actually the best part, it made a mediocre game decently neat.  So yeah, I know this isn't a strong endorsement, and it's not meant to be. It's a generic slapped-together shooter from 2003. The story is idiotically messy, with the stereotypical ""amnesia protagonist"" and some urban fights with ""generic underworld criminals"" and ""generic ooby-doob soldier guys"". But then it goes bonkers, and soon you're fighting through old Soviet spaceports and shit, and then fighting exosuit bad guys on Mars, and I can't even remember why or how it ended, but I distinctly recall a solid several hours of great gunfightery for the last 2/3rds of the game.  Except the very end, there's like a stupid tiny ledge you have to jump on from some flaming debris, and it was totally non-obvious and I wasted hours scouring the end level until I figured it out, but whatever.  So there ya go. Instead of arguing over whether a game was overlooked or not, here's an actually overlooked game. Just remember, it was overlooked for a reason."

patientgamers,3djiqs,ILikeRaisinsAMA,5,Fri Jul 17 03:53:05 2015 UTC,"Here they are:  Receiver.    Bioshock 2: Minerva's Den.    Project Snowblind.    Spec Ops: The Line.    Rainbow 6 Vegas.    The Club.    Red Orchestra 2.    The Darkness 2.    Call of Juarez: Gunslinger.    Binary Domain.    Bloody Good Time.    Heavy Bullets.    Prey.    Block N Load.    Chronicles of Riddick series.    Star Wars Republic Commando.    Metro 2033 and Last Night.    Tribes Ascend.    BF Bad Company 2.    I would personally highly recommend Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Red Orchestra 2. Red Orchestra 2 is incredibly frustrating for new players as you will die over and over, and not know how you die. But it contains a community that is close to ideal for tactical FPS gameplay and contains very realistic gunplay. If you want a serious, realistic WWII shooter that avoids Call of Duty arcade action, then RO2 is an excellent choice. Incredibly fun with a vocal team who are into it. Battlefield Bad Company 2 is my favorite of the series, still has lots of players and runs well on older machines.  I have played and would mildly recommend Bioshock 2: Minerva's Den. It is DLC for Bioshock 2, included free with every PC version (not longer correct, it was included with the PC version for free before Bioshock 2 went to Steamworks. It is now $10 on steam, in addition to the base game). It is heartily better than the base game storywise and is blisteringly difficult on the hardest difficulty. If you dont care for Bioshock's gunplay (which many claim is weak, I dont necessarily agree), then this is skippable. If you like Bioshock's combat and atmosphere, it is worth picking up for the $10 that this game often drops to in sales. It has a solid 5-6 hours of play, with the base game containing 12-16. The base game I would recommend too, but I am a fan of the series. It is the weakest iteration, however. EDIT: with the new knowledge of its pricing in Steam, I would wait for a sale. I wouldnt pay over $10 for Bioshock 2 and its DLC combined, and I am a fan of the series. If you are looking for quality Bioshock DLC, look for Bioshock Infinite's DLC, which is superb all around.   I have played and dont recommend Star Wars Republic Commando. It has not aged well. It feels like a giant tease; the squad communication and actions feel quite limited because the game is on a rail from beginning to end. It is an ambitious idea that needs revisiting, but in the end all I got was disappointment because I sensed that the formula had lots of potential, but was limited by the technology. The voice acting and writing is incredibly cringe worthy too. It does not have controller support, and while you can use Pinnacle Game Profiler or another option, the gunplay is lackluster. It may be worth the 4 bucks that it drops to on Steam during sales, you make that choice for yourself.  Havent played/heard of the rest."

I forgot the order but it was something like Watchdogs, Firestarter, Rats, Hotline Miami, Hoxton Breakout, and lastly, Hoxton's Revenge. You'll follow a story where you get ambushed by the cops and end up finding out who was behind all of it.  As for progression, leveling up was enough for me to stay motivated to keep playing. You'll end up playing some heists multiple times b/c they will earn you more exp/money than others.

Play half-life (or half-life source), followed by blue shift and opposing force, then half-life 2 and the episodes, then go back and experience a new take on the original with Black Mesa.

You are required to make tricky, death-defying leaps yet you cannot see your feet.  The motion is also a little jerky, so you'll go from 0 to a full run almost instantly and you have to be lined up perfectly to run up a ladder.  Normally that's not a problem, but there's another part where you're required to descend a ladder through the blades of an enormous fan,walk a catwalk turn it on, then turn around immediately and dodge up the ladder again before the blades cut you in half.

patientgamers,3dhpgm,tobiasvl,5,Thu Jul 16 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"Play Black Mesa, the fan remake of Half-Life. After you beat it, see YouTube for the last piece of the game, which isn't remade yet (""Xen"").   If you really love the first game, then check out Blue Shift and Opposing Force too. They're good, but not necessary for the story, and they're not revolutionary like HL1 and HL2.  Then go on to play Half-Life 2, followed by Episode 1 and 2. If you haven't played Portal and Portal 2, play those as well.   Then join us in waiting for Half-Life 3 forever."
patientgamers,3dhpgm,ThroneBound,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"I would recommend playing the original Half-Life first and not Black Mesa. Black Mesa, while good and more modern, does not possess the same sense of fantastic gameplay that Half-Life 1 has. It's cool to play but not a classic."
patientgamers,3dhpgm,gjvah,2,Sun Jul 19 01:00:09 2015 UTC,Start from the beginning.. duhh
patientgamers,3dhpgm,UnclaimedUsername,2,Thu Jul 16 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"Don't start with Black Mesa, it's incomplete and not quite the same. It's actually more difficult, to the point where I'd argue the balance is actually screwed up. If you like that, the two expansions are kinda neat (Blue Shift and Opposing Force).  I agree with /u/wulfenbach, there's some BS platforming that you'll have to do. In addition, the game is much more puzzle-heavy than the typical FPS, so the pace is generally slow. I think it holds up just fine, but according to some recent threads on here it seems a lot of people disagree."
patientgamers,3dhpgm,Lyzern,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Half-Life 1 remains one of the best FPS I've ever played and I'm almost sure the best Single Player FPS, yes, even better than HL2; so go for it, start from the beginning, you're gonna love it"

Runs well on my Windows 8.1 laptop. Occasional stutters, pauses when going from major area to major area - maybe every 15 or 30 minutes of play. The story is easy to follow, but kind of irrelevant - it's just a fun shooter with good puzzles and some nice scares."

Even though I used to think HL2 was much better as soon as I started playing it, and it is because it has a much more in depth story element and much improved graphics, i still actually have strong memories so much of HL1 even though I only played it recently and don't have the whole nostalgia for it"

patientgamers,3dgtpl,seifer93,2,Fri Jul 17 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"If you're missing controllers, you know that there are controllers for iOS, right? Also, if your iPad is jailbroken then you can use a utility called ""Controllers for All"" which will let you use PS3, PS4, and Wii U Pro controllers on iOS. IIRC, it costs $5, but if you're on a jailbroken device then you probably don't need me to tell you that there are ways around that.    On to the recommendations:   Chrono Trigger - * note: this is the same as the iOS version * This is easily the best version of the game. It has the anime cutscenes from the PSX version of the game without the long loadtimes. It also has some quality of life improvements. Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time as well as Bowser's Inside Story - great RPG elements, jokes that would fit in the Mother series, what's not to love? Shantae: Risky's Revenge - * note: the same version is available on iOS and a director's cut version is available on PC * This is a crazy good platformer. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if DSiWare games are still officially available, so unless you plan on using a flashcart you might not actually be able to play it on the DS. Pokemon Black/White - This is a Nintendo list. Did you think there wouldn't be a Pokemon game on the list?"

Gameplay is extremely unique. It's an action-based puzzle game with an RPG-like story. You run around collecting shit to shoot it out of giant robot tanks. Tingle's Rosy Rupieland. You play as Zelda's fay weirdo Tingle. The game is bonkers. Gameplay is zelda-like, but revolves around collecting money and haggling instead. There's also a lady bodybuilder fairy that lives in your computer. Radiant Historia. One of the best RPGs on the system that showed up late in it's life. Everything revolves around time-travel, but in a tighter timeframe than ChronoTrigger. It's more about playing to a point in events, figuring out what went wrong and then finding another fork in time to fix that bad timeline."

patientgamers,3dfgjr,cbsa82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:22 2015 UTC,I have been curious about Bulletstorm personally.  How is it?
patientgamers,3dfgjr,101Alexander,11,Wed Jul 15 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"Great actually, if you want a high intensity shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously but with great visuals. The writing and dialogue is amazing, check out the intro scene if you get the chance"
patientgamers,3dfgjr,itstevens,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"It's got just the right mix of legitimately decent writing and groan worthy dialogue. Plus the combat SOOOO incredibly satisfying and visceral. Also, it's not open world AT ALL. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy huge worlds that allow me to explore and discover, but sometimes I just enjoy a linear story that drives me on towards an inevitable conclusion. They're becoming increasingly rare and Bulletstorm hit the nail square on the head. I'm really upset that they aren't making he second one. Firstly, because I enjoyed the first one so damn much and, secondly, well, you know."

patientgamers,3ddo4b,ChewiestBroom,3,Wed Jul 15 16:27:45 2015 UTC,Multiple mentions of FTL. I'm going to have to check it out. That's another game I bought as part of a bundle and haven't had a chance to play yet.
patientgamers,3ddo4b,forkinanoutlet,6,Wed Jul 15 17:04:42 2015 UTC,"FTL is one of those games that will take away hours of your life playing it over and over and over again.

patientgamers,3ddo4b,BobisOnlyBob,2,Wed Jul 15 17:36:05 2015 UTC,FTL is one of those games you can just miserably suck ass at and still really enjoy. Every failure (and there are a hell of a lot) is still insanely entertaining.
patientgamers,3ddo4b,thinkforaminute,7,Wed Jul 15 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Red Dead Redemption's soundtrack is fucking incredible. Whenever I heard Triggernometry or The Shootist, I knew shit was about to hit the fan. Bill Elm and Woody Jackson did an amazing job of blending classic spaghetti western themes and motifs with an aggressive modern instrumentation by using particularly heavy drum rolls and sharp electric guitars. Brilliant.  L.A. Noire also has a fantastic OST that is perfect for listening to on a rainy day while sipping on a glass of scotch and thinking about all the dames who had to come see you, of all people. Her lips were candy apple red, and her eyes shone sky blue between puffs of smoke from her cigarette. She pouted, and you knew you just wouldn't be able to say no. You just hoped that she wouldn't end up like half the dames in the city of angels; chopped up to pieces and stuffed in the back of some mug's car.  Every Rare game. Ever. The sound of a banjo being tuned brings waves of nostalgia crashing down on my. Ya-ha! No-n-n-no Odd Job nuh-nuh-no-n-n-no Odd Job.. The vast majority of my friends can recite the Monkey Rap by heart. It's all half nostalgia value, but going back years and years later, these were all really well crafted OSTs.  Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 have amazingly creepy minimalist-glitchtronica soundtracks. Even the boss battles aren't your usual over the top ""BUM BUM THIS IS A BOSS BUM BUM FIGHT THE BOSS"" orchestral slams; they're unsettling, X-Files-y tunes that convey how other-worldly and alien the creature you're fighting is.  It's probably the most obvious answer, but that's because it's one of the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has one of the most incredible soundtracks of any game ever. If you've ever played any version of that game, those first chords give you goosebumps. The windmill song makes you scream ""Go around! Go around!"" The Bolero of Fire gets your heart racing. Lon Lon Ranch gives you a craving for milk. The game arguably has the most iconic tracks in gaming history beyond the Mario themes.  Oh yeah, and this fucking song from Sonic Adventure 2. What a sick bass intro."
patientgamers,3ddo4b,trias_e,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"Every Rare game. Ever.   Not sure why I didn't even think about that option. Does anyone else remember this gem?

I like instrumental/electronic in the background as I'm normally listening to music while coding or doing something on the computer.  I'm looking forward to Armikrog coming out next month from the same people. I did Kickstarter on that one & got the option to get the game & soundtrack.  One exception to the previously mentioned thing that I'm normally listening to music while working on the computer. I started doing Zombies Run and found that music by Chipzel (creator of the Super Hexagon soundtrack) and EnV (creator of the Electronic Super Joy soundtrack) make GREAT high energy running music.

patientgamers,3dg347,Omnilatent,2,Thu Jul 16 00:12:51 2015 UTC,"Chaos Rising is really the second part of the DOW 2 campaign. It follows the same marines and continues the story. It also imports your save of gear and levels from DOW 2. I highly recommend it.  Retribution is the one that is the ""maybe"" purchase. Retribution has events that happen after Chaos Rising, but it doesn't involve the same party of marines from DOW2 and Chaos Rising. Nothing is imported from the saves. It's also somewhat repetitive - you can play any of 5-6 factions, but you play them all in the same missions without any real choice of order.  I'd recommend playing all three, of course, but I'd much more recommend Chaos Rising before Retribution and especially after playing DOW 2. This is if you're doing it for the story campaign. If you wanted just multi, just play retribution. But story campaign-wise, DOW2 & Chaos Rising is the true game, Retribution is more the quicker, smaller cash in.  Of course, realize that the DOW 2 campaigns are not the same as the DOW Dark Crusade or Soulstorm campaigns. They're not Build A Base, Swarm With Units. It's more like playing a tactical arpg, maybe like playing diablo but with squads of guys who can take cover, level up, and get wargear. I liked it better than the Dark Crusade campaign, but it's a different animal."

patientgamers,3dcftk,skyturnedred,12,Wed Jul 15 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"Certainly one of my favorite series, so I'm biased. Personally, I love them for a different reasons. At the time when I played them, their competition rpg's didn't have a voiceovers or that personal touch on the game.  They have their flaws.  Gothic 1 has a very ""different"" kind of controls than I was used to. You just have to get used to them and after that it's very enjoyable game.  Gothic 2 has improved on the controls.  Gothic 3 was a mess, I loved it but still a mess. Community patches fixed the game but they still have some freezing issues and stutter.  I don't know if you find the graphics appealing? For a lot of people they're very important. I like them but I suppose they're dated by today's standards.  Soundtrack is great all around on all their games.  Combat is similar for 1 and 2 which is good but nothing amazing. Combat in 3 might be a little boring because of simple hack n slash.  What I really like about them games are different factions you can join. They give the games much replayability.  Different types of weapons, armors and enemies.  Fan favorite is 2 usually, which is the most polished one.  Look up screenshots and gameplay videos."

patientgamers,3dcftk,SaveYourShit,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:24 2015 UTC,There is no way dx11 was involved because Gothic ii was made well before Directx 10. A texture update or hd texture pack does not require any particular directx version but simply a quick replace of the game's texture files. Upgrading the direct version requires a rewrite of the game's code which is likely closed source. There are rare instances where someone makes a dx wrapper for a particular game to give it a few higher level features but it's super rare and not very efficient

Overhaul developer uses a sort of hook to enhance the engine. That takes a lot of work. Surprised to see it in Gothic II. If you Google ENB that is a similar idea but has iterations for a big list of games old and new
patientgamers,3dcftk,destroyermaker,4,Thu Jul 16 02:31:13 2015 UTC,I'd put the first 2 among my favorite CRPGs of all time.  Start with the first and go in with expectations that these are fairly dated games.  The controls are possibly the most non intuitive to ever appear in a CRPG (even worse than the first Witcher). But once you get used to them they are serviceable.
patientgamers,3dcftk,SaveYourShit,5,Wed Jul 15 05:20:20 2015 UTC,"I've played all three Gothic titles.   Gothic1 is interesting for his level design, story an atmosphere. Everything is else is very dated.  Gothic 2 is really great especially with the expansion, that is included in the gold edition.   Gothic 3 is not that great. I always got the feeling that it tried to compete with MMOs like WoW, which were huge. So they build a huge world, which wasn't filled with quality stories, one would expect from a gothic game and huge bugs that would crash your game... In a time before automatic autosaves all the time... The expanision forsaken gods was even worse. It was not made by the original developer and had even more bugs...  After this disaster I didn't play Arcania.    because it was not the same developer, that produced Gothic 1 & 2( they started a new Game series called Risen). Just by the same publisher, who held the name rights. It was paned by the gaming press for having even a bad story, which was the only piece of the gothic series that wasn't outdated at that point.   -> My advice: Buy Gothic 2. If you like maybe buy Gothic 1 and 3."
patientgamers,3dcftk,Aidinthel,2,Wed Jul 15 07:57:25 2015 UTC,"I recommend Gothic 1 highly, although I haven't played it in years so maybe I'd find it too dated, too. If anyone does play it, be sure to install the In Extremo mod - one of the most memorable scenes in the game. There are other tweaks/mods that help, too.  Arcania was indeed awful. Good call on skipping it."
patientgamers,3dcftk,unruly_mattress,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"The original Gothic iii team got cut off from development because the publisher forced the game out to sell way before developers were ready. Super common with big publishers and big games (arkham knight, assassins Creed 3). It's also why many features in vanilla Gothic iii were missing and unpolished (creature sounds, quests, factions, combat, lighting) on day of release. Thankfully the community brought in that refinement"
patientgamers,3dcftk,swizzle_,4,Wed Jul 15 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"I've tried a couple times to get into Gothic 2, but couldn't get past the weird, complicated controls.

patientgamers,3dcftk,aqeeliz,4,Wed Jul 15 09:15:11 2015 UTC,"I love Gothic 1. I'll admit its combat controls are a bit unconventional, but so is the entire game. It has a good story, very good characters, even a branching choice that has actual consequences. The world it creates is unfamiliar but completely convincing. It's very old-school in that it doesn't feel like the game world bends for you - there are no monster auto-leveling systems or whatnot. I recommend the game very much. I hope it runs well on modern systems...  Gothic 2 didn't have the same alien charm. Still a game worth playing in my opinion. Never played 3."

But for people who want a whole game (even though it's older) and who want to be able to jump in without thinking it's an impossible learning curve, Starcraft 1 is not a viable option.   At this point that game is almost dead because    It barely works on systems now. Colors and aspect ratio will be the first you have to solve. You may never fix either. The multiplayer is nearly empty or community based and extremely established in skill level.   I just say get Starcraft 2 and start investing in a new computer.

For a game that arguably invented the entire genre of competitive eSports and became a multiplayer cultural phenomenon in a handful of Asian countries?  I just treat games like they should be treated when I see them. They invested much more hard work in the multiplayer and that's objective. If you want to try to find as much to like about the single player, this might simply not be the game for you. You don't have much control over that, even for ""your purposes"". It's not weird but I don't think you should look for that everywhere you go. Expecting every game to be like that would be weird.   If you always think it's a ""side bonus"" then I would say that is rather binary of you and you're not treating each game differently though.

The worst thing is that you will treat XCOM franchise based on this crap and it has very few to do with XCOM genre. My advice is get XCOM: EU.

patientgamers,3d9ung,Rhode,5,Tue Jul 14 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"Enemy Within is the one you want.  EU and EW are the same game, EW just has more features."
patientgamers,3d9ung,X-pert74,3,Tue Jul 14 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"Enemy Within is not a sequel; it's an expansion to Enemy Unknown. It's the same story and same overall gameplay, but with a ton of new added content. It's actually available only as an expansion to the base Enemy Unknown game on PC (though is a separate purchase on consoles). If you haven't ever played an XCOM game before, Enemy Within isn't a bad place to start. Along with the added features and content, it also includes some much-needed bug fixes and rebalancing, which are greatly appreciated.  I haven't played The Bureau yet, so I can't comment on that, but I do know it's not a turn-based tactical strategy game, so it's probably not representative of the main games in the series. As far as other X-COM games though, if you ever feel like going back and playing something from a couple decades ago, I still consider X-COM: UFO Defense to be just about my favorite game of all time. It is so, so good, although it's comparatively harder to get into than the reboot series is. If you give UFO Defense a try, make sure to play it using OpenXCOM; it improves the experience a hundredfold, with support for several different resolutions, the ability to turn on or off a number of optional changes to streamline the experience, and add general UI enhancements to make the overall experience clearer (such as adding Xenonauts-esque highlighted paths so you have a visual representation of exactly how far a unit can move in a given turn).  If you play and happen to enjoy UFO Defense, then I think X-COM: Terror From The Deep is also worth a shot. It's basically like a reskin of UFO Defense in a lot of ways, but I appreciate the greatly increased difficulty and the underwater/Lovecraftian-inspired enemies, as well as the nice addition of melee weapons. Unfortunately it's not compatible with OpenXCOM yet, but the developers of that are working to enable compatibility, which will be greatly appreciated as unfortunately Terror From The Deep has some major bugs which, if you aren't aware of them ahead of time, risk outright preventing you from completing the game."
patientgamers,3d9ung,Knofbath,3,Tue Jul 14 18:52:52 2015 UTC,Bureau: Declassified was critically panned as a sub-par 3rd person shooter. Not even the same genre as the original X-COM games.  UFO: Enemy Unknown (1994) - game that started the series X-COM: Terror from the Deep (1995) - sequel to Enemy Unknown X-COM: Apocalypse (1997) X-COM: Interceptor (1998) - adds space-sim and business sim aspects X-COM: Enforcer (2001) - 3rd person shooter spinoff by Hasbro

The original XCOM  UFO defense is pretty neat. There's an ""open Xcom"" remake which is very good from a gameplay perspective but the graphics and gameplay are kinda dated. Still it's like 20-30hrs start to finish so it's worth it to take a peek.  There's an UFO defense low budget spoof called Xenonauts which copies most of the UFO defense gameplay, adds a few bells and whistles to the gameplay and reskins the whole thing with overall good results.  There's a set of spoofs from the early 2000s which I call the Aftershits because I didn't like them but you can check them out if you like (aftershock, afterlight, etc).  XCOM:EU is... decent. It moves in a different direction (more narrative, less complex, shallower) but it's very enjoyable (some would say addicting) and doesn't overstay its welcome (it's about 40-50 hrs to complete).  And then there's the cream of the cream, the jewel of the crown, the bee's knees, which is an XCOM:EW mod called ""Long War"". It's PC master race through and through, very deep, very complex, like a saga of novels which keeps you devouring tome after tome and wanting more. You should play EW just to experience Long War IMO."

patientgamers,3dbp3i,X-pert74,2,Wed Jul 15 01:04:11 2015 UTC,"Even so, you should still start with the first Fallout, ideally. Fallout 2 really feels like it's designed for people who have played and are intimately familiar with the first game, both with regards to its story/lore and its gameplay. The first game isn't too long as far as RPGs go either, so it wouldn't take too much time to work one's way through before playing the sequel. Also the original Fallout is one of my absolute favorite games ever so I may be a little biased toward it, but if you do want to explore the series as a whole, it really is a good starting point.  If you like those games, keep in mind 3 and New Vegas are very different from the older games - 3 especially feels almost like a different series, thanks to the different writing team/style and the change in game genre, design, and mechanics. New Vegas is kind of an interesting game, in that it builds off of Fallout 3 in a lot of ways (mostly gameplay-wise, but also including a small handful of story/artistic influences as well), yet its story is mostly connected to the first two games' again, as opposed to 3 which is primarily a standalone story with a smaller set of ties to the first two. As a result, some older Fallout fans consider New Vegas to be the ""real"" Fallout 3, in part because it actually directly progresses a lot of the story developments that the first two games had.  Also, 3 and New Vegas are not as challenging as the older games; 3 especially is pretty easy, particularly when you get fully-leveled, which doesn't take too much time to do. New Vegas is a little more challenging, and it does introduce ""hardcore"" mode which is neat (it requires you to keep track of your hunger and thirst meters, which don't exist in the normal game, and includes some other changes like giving ammo weight, which means you can't carry an infinite amount at a single time). Overall, I really like New Vegas a lot, in part thanks to how connected its story is with the first two games, and also thanks to its gameplay improvements over 3. It still plays differently from the first two though, so it's possible you might not like it as much.  EDIT: Also, I should clarify that it's technically possible to enjoy any of the Fallout games on their own without having played the others, but they do all take place in the same world, and 1/2/New Vegas especially tie in with each other from game to game, so you'll likely miss out on character references and establishment of various factions and the like if you play them out of order."

Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4 are first/third-person shooters with RPG elements or an RPG with first/third-person shooter elements."

patientgamers,3d768p,rarelypost,10,Tue Jul 14 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"You can turn off DLC in Steam in the box located on the game's library page.  If your DE:HR doesn't have the option to turn off individual DLCs, then I would just dump everything you don't want since selling it isn't going to get you that much money and there's no sense carrying around items you'll never use.  You get most of your money in the game from missions and looting things.  Also remember to take one item at a time when looting objects since it'll clog up your inventory pretty fast with useless ammo and grenades if you just ""Take All"" from every lootable object.  I will say I played the Director's Cut and played pure stealth so I didn't need any weapons or ammo, and I ended my game with plenty of leftover credits since all I spent money on was Praxis kits at the LIMB Clinics.    If you're playing the original game, you'll want to have some weapons and ammo for boss fights because even if you're playing stealth you'll have to use weapons to kill bosses.  The Director's Cut doesn't have that problem and gives you options to take down bosses using non-lethal means."

Why didn't the devs instead stash them in Jensen's office?  Anyway, the smartest thing is to simply drop all the gear you think you won't need; e.g. drop all the lethal guns if you want to make a non-lethal run, and so on. It kind of sucks to throw away items you could sell, but money has never been a problem in that game even without the 10,000 (I think?) credits you get from one of the DLCs."

patientgamers,3d768p,beboppin_n_scottin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"They're all within moments of starting the first mission still, they just place the one appropriate to the playstyle you're choosing at the start of that path. So you'll find the sawed-off shotgun at the ground level warehouse entrance, but you'll find the silenced sniper rifle on the roof if you're trying to get in through the vents.  Either way I found it pretty clumsy. Shame they went that approach for these weapons instead of more naturally seeding them into the world -- but hey, gotta add incentive to DLC somehow."

You might want to disable the DLC at least for your first playthrough.  I tried Sleeping Dogs with all DLC, and after the first mission I had unlocked 18 out of 20 skills, had the best weapons and cars in the game, so after that there was just no point in playing the early errand boy missions because my character was already unstoppable."

A lot of indie games also have pretty simple controls (though the difficulty of the actual games varies). A few off the top of my head that work well with a controller:  Limbo, Spelunky, Bastion, Braid. A few that are better with keyboard and mouse:  Broken Age, Hotline Miami, World of Goo, The Swapper."

patientgamers,3d7cih,KingWormKilroy,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:09 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I actually never tried it with a controller and just assumed it would be better with a mouse due to how quickly and accurately you have to aim.

For example, using a 360 controller and a platformer, A will be jump and X will be attack in most of those games, and the other buttons will be mapped for whatever action you might have to use besides those. Same with most FPS games using a controller (like Borderlands), left trigger will be aim, right trigger shoot, RB is grenade, A is jump, X is reload, etc.  The same thing applies if you're looking to use the keyboard, Ctrl is crouch, Shift is run, W is forward, A is left, S is backwards, and D is right, E is interact, R is reload, spacebar to jump, etc.  Usually the tutorial will help you out when you start a game and you can always look at the in-game control layout if you forget what button does what and need some refreshing."

If you have a friend I also strongly suggest getting Chariot. I bought it during the last Steam sale and have been having a blast playing it co-op. It is a rather funny platform puzzler where you have to carry your dead Father's coffin to a fancier grave with your fiance. Sounds grim but is very light hearted and has a lot of humour.

patientgamers,3d7cih,Myrandall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"Volgarr the Viking is only four or so keys and it's a lot of fun. Very challenging. Similarly, Super Meat Boy is just left/right and jump but it packs a lot of game in there. BattleBlock Theatre is simple and lots of fun, too. I'd recommend any of those games to anybody who likes platformers.  If you want shooters, TF2 is pretty distilled as far as controls go (unless you're playing Engineer). WASD, mouse clicks, space to jump, R to reload. Holds up pretty well, in my opinion. People like to complain about the hats and visual style but the same gameplay is there and that's what counts.   I would recommend Cities Skylines but this is /r/patientgamers and buying fairly new games isn't very patient. I'd also recommend Sim City 4- it's deep and rewarding. Widely considered one of the best in the genre.  Imperialism is another strategy classic with a simple UI.

It's extremely similar to XCOM in terms of attachment to characters that can and will be lost at some point. With that comes a steady stream of training replacements for the dead or recovering.  The setting is a very psychological dungeon crawl with some Transylvania and Cthulhu thrown in. Characters build up stress dealing with monsters and darkness, and the will eventually have mental breaks that add random penalties to work around. For example, your cleric might need to start flagellating herself to destress.   The game plays out in a very ""by the skin of your teeth"" fashion that makes it really rewarding to keep people alive and accomplish goals. Character skills are similar to XCOM in terms of choosing from a few to choose well for the situation. The strategic battles are done really well and each class has both front and rear skills that make mixing and matching different teams extremely interesting.  The game is still in Early Access, but it's probably one of the most complete titles I've seen that isn't officially released. You could easily spend 40 hours on it as is. The loop of dungeon diving, leveling characters, recovering, and going back stays really fresh, so it's not a game I worry about exhausting by playing early."

Disgaea series allows for some INSANE levels of grinding (but I think that it's entirely optional) and I don't know of any game where you are able to pour in that much effort into customizing your party members. I've only played Disgaea 2 and in that game alone, you get to pick what job classes they get reincarnated into, what weapons/armor they use, upgrading those weapons and armor by diving into the worlds located within them. Basically, you design every edge and curve of your boss-killing meat bag and his/her equipment.

Definitely check this out OP as it fits right in with what you described when it comes to emotional involvement with the characters. It features family houses with bloodline management.

patientgamers,3d1eji,Katzoconnor,7,Sun Jul 12 18:53:25 2015 UTC,The top three on your list are all great games.  Planescape: Torment... Fantastic story.  Interesting story.  Unique game play with some cool mechanics.  You will have to do some modding to get it into best playable shape.  Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition... Always near the top of best rpg games of all time.  Amazing soundtrack.  Fun story.  I've played through it more times than I can count.  Diablo II plus Lord of Destruction... Another game I've sunk more time into than I'd like to admit.  The story is solid and it's just fun to play.
patientgamers,3d1eji,kralrick,3,Sun Jul 12 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"The idea of dropping 120+ hours into the three of them is daunting...but I know that it's an experience that I really need to put myself through. I -do- want to play Diablo III eventually (with the expansion, since the base game, I'm told, is somewhat...limited). Baldur's Gate II has been on my list for a decade and I've just never played it. Used to even have the original physical PC release. Back then, four discs was CRAZY.  The worst part is that I used to have a guide for Baldur's Gate II! I know that there's an incredible amount of stuff for it and that it, too, has an active modding community.   Could you tell me a little more about Planescape? Particularly about that modding you mentioned. I wasn't aware that there was modding for it...are you referring to gameplay/graphical updates, or is there additional content I should take a look at?"
patientgamers,3d1eji,kralrick,3,Sun Jul 12 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"The only mods I've used for Planescape update the graphics a bit and make it playable on modern machines.  You won't get anywhere near the kind of beauty you get from modding (or playing) Skyrim, but Planescape is a 16 year old game.  But you don't play Planescape for the graphics, you play it because it's a well written novel you can immerse yourself in.  The guidebooks for Baldur's Gate I & II were both great.  One of the aspects of older rpgs that's sadly fallen by the wayside with digital distribution.  Baldur's Gate has a lot of tweaks for ease of life as well as additional content that can be modded in.  The Enhanced Edition included a lot of the ease of life stuff and included some additional content but there's more out there."
patientgamers,3d1eji,kralrick,2,Sun Jul 12 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"Figured it was something like that. Friends have told me that it's pretty much an obligatory play and very rewarding...I might consider making that one work for me first. I'm glad that people have invested the time and work to bring it up a couple of notches in that department, at the very least.  I agree with that. I wish they at least did digital PDFs or something. But nothing beats holding that tall, paperback tome and trying to figure out how to make it fit with your bookshelf..."
patientgamers,3d1eji,wikired,2,Sun Jul 12 20:52:47 2015 UTC,Whether they're worth starting will depend on how long a block of time you'll have to play.  They're not something you can really play half an hour at a time.
patientgamers,3d1eji,wikired,2,Mon Jul 13 01:29:35 2015 UTC,That's on me; I should have specified.  Safe to say that I'll be able to drop 3-5 hours at a time.
patientgamers,3d1eji,xddbad,6,Mon Jul 13 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"Vagrant Story is a really fun and unique game, I don't think I've ever played anything like it before or since.  Final Fantasy Tactics/Tactics Advance/Tactics Ogre are all fantastic, among the best of the genre as far as I'm concerned.   Mass Effects - definitely more action-oriented starting with 2, they're shooters really. Still great games, I dug them a lot. 2 is really good and 3 isn't as bad as people say, the ending sucked but only the very end. 3 as a whole was still definitely worth playing.  Well, those are the ones I've played/enjoyed."
patientgamers,3d1eji,wikired,0,Sun Jul 12 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose I should technically disqualify the Mass Effect games. They have RPG elements, but it's definitely not the predominant genre, and they fall more to the wayside after the first one.  I've heard that about Vagrant Story: punishing, rewarding, and like nothing else out there.  I appreciate you chiming in!"
patientgamers,3d1eji,wikired,3,Sun Jul 12 20:26:48 2015 UTC,"For Vagrant Story I'd actually recommend reading a guide that explains the gameplay, I wish I had. More than halfway through the game I was still figuring out stuff I should have known from the beginning. Loved it regardless!  That said, I do still recommend Mass Effect 2/3! I liked them enough that I actually even bought all the DLC. (well, not the costume or weapon DLCs, just the story ones)"

patientgamers,3d1eji,rarelypost,2,Sun Jul 12 20:59:10 2015 UTC,I second the recommendation for Tactics Ogre/Final Fantasy Tactics. I love those games.

patientgamers,3d1eji,rarelypost,3,Sun Jul 12 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"War of the Lions has improved translation, new characters, new jobs (character classes), some extra quests and nice cut scenes. I'd go with WotL, I thought it was a very well done re-release."

patientgamers,3d1eji,rarelypost,2,Sun Jul 12 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"I played Chrono Trigger on PSX. I liked the FMVs, but those filthy loading times made me want to spend as much time out of my menus as possible...and I didn't realize for years that the screen wasn't supposed to freeze before every fight whatsoever.  I prefer the PSP anyway, regardless of bullshit battery life. Sounds good to me!"
patientgamers,3d1eji,HunterZ0,6,Sun Jul 12 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"My suggestion, since you're light on time, is to play To The Moon first since it's only a few hours long and not an RPG, so you can knock it out in a day or two of playing, depending how much time you devote to it in one sitting.    Next I'd recommend playing Bravely Default.  It's a great modern RPG with a classic Final Fantasy feel with jobs.  One of the good things is you can turn off enemy encounters or make them twice as likely depending on if you want to grind an area or would rather just run straight through without getting into any fights.  Since it's portable it's also nice because you could play it during a lunch break or on public transportation (if you have to take a train or bus to get to work) without having to be tied to a console.     If you have the Dragon Quest DS games you could play those with the portable factor being a positive also, but I haven't gotten around to playing those yet myself so I can't say how they are.  I can also recommend Valkyrie Profile, it's a unique RPG with a combat style and story you're not going to find in any other RPG.    All of the others I have either never played or haven't played enough of to really say if I'd recommend them or not.  And since you've already played all of the Final Fantasy games up to 10, I can't really recommend you play them again even though they're on your list of games you want to play.    The good thing is, since you have so many you could just stop playing one if you're not interested and either come back to it later or write it off as a game you're not interested in at all."
patientgamers,3d1eji,madbuttery,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you taking the time to explain Bravely Default. It's been collecting dust on my bookshelf for two years, and I've forgotten what the features were besides Final Fantasy but better, trust me. For similar reasons, my 3DS has been collecting dust too...luckily, I work from home, so portability isn't totally necessary. But I do hate being bored and could carry it around when I'm waiting on other people for whatever reason. I have a total ladyboner for Dragon Quest, so those titles are high on my eventually list.  Should have elucidated that I haven't played far into a number of the Final Fantasies. For instance, I think I gave FFV two or three hours. That's actually par for the course with those...think my non-beaten record was ten hours with VI or X. With X, I gave up on it, but with VI my playstation broke, and I'd moved on by the time I got another one (we are talking a decade ago, so).   Valkyrie Profile always fascinated me. But that 1 1/2 hours until the first save point (and the super exposition) sort of turned me off. Any time I've tried to pick it back up, I've had to start back over for one reason or another. Am I remembering this incorrectly?"
patientgamers,3d1eji,Prah2013,2,Sun Jul 12 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't remember the beginning of Valkyrie Profile being that long, maybe like 30 minutes at the most, but my memory isn't that good and I haven't played it for at least 8-10 years now.  I mainly remember the combat and story that comes after and how I haven't seen anything like it before or since.  It's also probably the shortest one on your list besides To The Moon since there's a time limit counting down to Ragnarok.    Since you haven't played that far into any of your Final Fantasy games then I'd recommend you play through FF6, FF9, and FF10, as those are the best besides FF7.    FF8 can be skipped if you're just not interested after 5-10 hours, but it's still an enjoyable entry.  I'd recommend taking a quick look at FF13 as well, but again, it can be skipped if you're not interested.  FF13's story is pretty weak but I enjoyed the battle system they introduced.  FF13-2 is a much better game overall compared to FF13, so if you could play that one I'd recommend it over FF13.    I personally found FF12 to be a boring entry in the series so I couldn't really recommend that one.  Of course FF2-5 are all classics but aren't really mandatory playing unless you just want a classic RPG.  And though you probably don't need more recommendations, I could recommend checking out a few series for your 3DS as well, like the Shin Megami Tensei series, the Fire Emblem series, and the Etrian Odyssey series.  They're all great RPG experiences as well and could help knock some dust off that 3DS."
patientgamers,3d1eji,Prah2013,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:08:28 2015 UTC,"The art design and overall atmosphere of Valkyrie Profile definitely intrigues me. I know that it was given a mildly updated re-release on PSP, but that version leaves out a lot of the improvements made to the original international release. What I'll probably do is what I do for a lot of my PSX games â rip my physical copy to digital, convert it to UMP, and play it on my PSP. The portability is pretty great, and the smaller screen makes the old RPGs really pop. Gives a lot of renewed life to the blockier graphics. FF VII or Chrono Cross on PSP is pretty fantastic.  I made it to  on FF XIII, and the sheer difficulty spike turned me off. Unfortunately, the cloud-based saving wasn't around when I was playing it, and that console was lost in a home robbery...I eventually watched the cutscenes from that point on. I do like the characters, even if the story is weak. If FF XIII-2 is a far better title, I may give that a whirl. I got it for free in Games for Gold months ago. The third title looked somewhat appealing, so I might go that route.  Then there's Final Fantasy Agito, or Type 0, whatever it's called now. I picked it up for Xbox One, but it looks like it plays better on PSP. Sounded incredibly fun. I've played a couple of hours into it, might pick it back up.  Friends of mine insist that FF8 is the superior classic Final Fantasy. I've heard good things and might give it another try. As I understand it, the story is great, and the final boss is fairly interesting.  I've never really given Fire Emblem a chance (and I know I probably should), and don't really know anything about Etrian Odyssey. What's the latter like?"
patientgamers,3d1eji,karma_the_llama,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as long as you've seen the FF13 cutscenes you shouldn't be lost and FF13-2 deals more with time travel and gives you more freedom in the world rather than going down hallway after hallway in FF13.    I do agree that FF8 is a great game but it's very polarizing also.  You either love it or hate it.  It's a great game and worth checking out.  It also has a really fun card game in it, which is one of my favorite parts of the game.  As far as the Etrian Odyssey games, they're first person dungeon crawling RPGs where you make your way through areas in the game and draw the map on the touch screen as you go.  When you go into battle you'll fight in a first person perspective in a turn-based style, selecting your moves like you would in other turn-based RPGs.  It's probably one of the stand out RPG series available for the DS/3DS since there's not many games like it.    There are other good RPGs on the DS/3DS as well, like Radiant Historia, The World Ends With You, the Mario & Luigi games, and of course one of the Pokemon games to give some examples.  Anyways, i should probably stop recommending more RPGs on top of the ones you already have and are interested in.  I would go with To The Moon, Valkyrie Profile, and then go on from there to whichever game you want to try out."
patientgamers,3d1eji,Red-Blue-,2,Sun Jul 12 23:01:47 2015 UTC,"The World Ends With You is my favourite contemporary RPG. Everything from the character designs (Nomura at some of his finest) to gameplay and OST make for an immersive, distinct atmosphere. Really interesting mechanics all around. I'm still holding out for the never-gonna-happen sequel.  I didn't even know Etrian Odyssey was recent. Thought it might have been SNES. I'll give them a look and see what it'll take to obtain them. Sounds like a good blend, since being a classic DQ fan means I don't automatically write off first-person battles anyway.  Thanks for your time. Definitely gives me a lot to consider."
patientgamers,3d1eji,element8,2,Sun Jul 12 23:10:06 2015 UTC,"They're actually re-releasing the original Etrian Odyssey DS games for the 3DS with more story attached, so I'd recommend picking those up over the original DS ones.  The first one was Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl, which is a remake of EO1, and there's Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight coming out next month that's a re-release of EO2.    Hopefully that wasn't too confusing, but basically the Etrian Odyssey Untold games on the 3DS are remakes of the originals from the DS and would be the ones I'd recommend getting.  EO4 was released for the 3DS already, so I doubt it will get a remake like EO1-3."

patientgamers,3d1eji,unruly_mattress,5,Sun Jul 12 23:31:05 2015 UTC,"With limited time I think I'd recommend Final Fantasy Tactics. While lots of time can be put into the game, the battles are very distinct and separated giving you a much better feeling of progression as compared to more open RPGs where things feel a lot more daunting.  Also To the Moon, but already suggested twice :)"

patientgamers,3d1eji,Negromancers,3,Mon Jul 13 01:06:28 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy VI and Xenogears should be your first priorities IMO.  I'll also recommend some stuff that isn't on your list:   Since you mentioned in another post in this thread that you like some RPG Maker games, OFF is absolutely fantastic. Earthbound and Mother 3 are also absolutely worth playing IMO, though if you don't own a Wii U to play Earthbound on and don't want to both import a copy of Mother 3 and apply a patch to the cart, you'll need to be fine with emulation in order to play them. And your list has a surprising lack of Shin Megami Tensei. This needs to be fixed, so I'll recommend Persona 3 and Digital Devil Saga, along with Nocturne (which is considered by some to be the best RPG on the PS2, but I personally don't get why people think that. It's still pretty good and definitely worth a shot, though IMO)."

I see it mentioned from time to time. What's the gameplay like?  Earthbound and Mother 3. I'll probably have to cough cough play them through unscrupulous means cough cough but I can still certainly do those. I know that they're classics.

patientgamers,3d1eji,charliedude,3,Mon Jul 13 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"Some quick opinions:   Planescape: Torment: More of an adventure game than an RPG. I've played it but haven't beaten it. It's supposed to have some of the best game writing of all time. Diablo II: This one is great but a bit of a slog. Final Fantasy II: I thought this one was actually pretty good. Played it on GBA. Final Fantasy III: Tried playing a fan translation of this on NES and didn't like it, partly because the level design was pretty mediocre. Tried playing on tablet and didn't get into it because the controls were terrible. Final Fantasy IV: Enjoyed this one on GBA, except that the plot rambled a bit. Final Fantasy V: Lost track of the horribly rambling plot and never finished it. Xenogears: Gave this a couple honest attempts on PSX back in the day, and ended up hating it. The first huge chunk of the game has you suffer through tons of horrible, rambling text about pseudo-religious garbage that is occasionally broken up by a completely unfocused collection of multiple combat systems. Eventually you get to a new part of the game, but it's full of talking animals all of a sudden. Ugh. Dragon Age: Origins: This game is really good, but long enough that I keep putting it down before I manage to finish it (a la Baldur's Gate 1)."

Standing on taxi's and getting the drivers to fight eachother The police missions were challenging and cool First put on a parachute. second, drive a motorcycle as fast as you possibly can onto oncoming traffic.

Avoid Guardian like the plague. In fact, with the right pawn team, it can be awesome to do nothing and just watch the fun and crazy things they do in combat.   The combat system. One of the best combat systems in any RPG ever. It's so awesome to climb on monsters and devastate them up close and personal. Every vocation is fun... melee and ranged and magic are all awesome. Few games make every vocation fun to play.  Challenging monsters in the Dark Arisen expansion (which should not be attempted until NG+ both for story reasons and difficulty of gameplay).  Impressive visuals on attacks (especially for Sorcerers)."

patientgamers,3d1z7v,chrismichaels3000,2,Sun Jul 12 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on who you ask. I preferred magic and ranged... striders make awesome deadly climbers with crazy dagger attacks and short range bow... rangers destroy long range with tenfold... mages are okay and best as healer pawns... sorcerers take a few seconds to set up their spells but they can destroy the entire battlefield (especially if teamed with Utilitarian/Challenger sorcerer pawns for spell sync'ing)... Mystic knights are potentially the most powerful vocation, but they require the ""correct"" build and lots of practice in the timing of defensive attacks... Assassins deliver so much destruction it's almost laughable... magic archers are fun to play and can be devastating in the tight confines of the expansion.   A lot of players love the sword/board fighters because of some powerful attacks... and other LOVE the warrior vocation that though slow occasionally can deliver incredibly powerful blows."
patientgamers,3d1z7v,Alphyn_dp,2,Sun Jul 12 22:04:06 2015 UTC,I would recommend playing as a Fighter at least once to take advantage of the awesome sotc-monster-climbing system.
patientgamers,3d1z7v,SplitArmada,7,Mon Jul 13 09:33:21 2015 UTC,"I shill for this game all the time. I honestly believe it's one of the best and unique RPG's. Many haven't heard of it, since marketing was very limited.  It certainly has it's flaws, many which were addressed in Dark Arisen.  Combat is similar to Dark Souls which is enjoyable.  Can be tough and challenging at times, but it's balanced well enough not to be incredible difficult.  For me it was one of those games you beat it and simply play another playthrough. With all your inventory stuff remaining if you want to.  Nothing is overly complicated and you have a really nice character creation system. Very detailed."
patientgamers,3d1z7v,chrismichaels3000,5,Sun Jul 12 21:58:53 2015 UTC,It's a fantastic game that's hindered by poor pawn AI and an absolutely abysmal inventory management system. I stopped playing because I got tired of dealing with the awful menus and constantly being over encumbered.
patientgamers,3d1z7v,Ozorgo,7,Mon Jul 13 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"The pawn system has FANTASTIC AI once you learn how to set it up. Setting up a pawn properly with the correct inclination (primary and secondary) for each vocation yields pawns that can control and destroy everything on the battlefield with no help at all from the player. Before I moved on I would regularly go out with my pawn and 2 carefully chosen pawns (looking at their inclinations) and I could just watch the awesome destruction. Plus, with the right inclinations, pawns would set up cross-vocation combos between the other pawns and with the player character. Though pawns did need to be ""trained"" to learn how to deal with monsters and areas and the gameplay of their player character. Once all this is done, a pawn can be amazing to play with and watch.  Folks who complained about ""poor AI"" never bothered to learn about the subtle yet powerful pawn inclination system. When done poorly, it yields nothing more than a pack mule. When done right, it yields a teammate more fun to play with than in any multiplayer."

Didn't play sorcerer/mage except to get suasion.  -Hellhounds  -Symone"

It's like the law of diminishing returns. Many, many tests were done in damage delivery early in the game (can be looked up on GameFaqs boards if you're interested), but min/maxing did not deliver more enemy damage than a planned build with lower stats.  That is one of the great things with DD, is that even so-so builds can be incredibly effective in combat. My player character build was pretty crappy, but I had over 100 online Ur dragon kills in 7/9 vocations (everything but fighter/warrior)."

I really liked the idea of the Pawn system and how much detail you could add to characters.  Being used to more classic RPGs and leveling systems, I did not like how you could simply walk into a region where monsters would be many, many levels above you just by accident, just for being curious.  The menus were confusing and I could not get a grasp of what was really going on, so I stopped playing. I forgot about it for a long, long time. I even thought about selling it back since it was just there collecting dust.  I am so glad I didn't. I picked it up a couple of days ago again, and I have to say I am having a blast. I am much more careful with my decisions now, and am taking advantage of pawn inclinations, so the game is much more enjoyable. It is still tough, but not to the point of being annoying. A very underrated game mostly because it needs a second chance to truly convince you, in my opinion. I just wish more people would play it so that my pawn could get more exposure."

The player pool is large enough that it takes less than 30 seconds for me to find a game and there are players of all levels.   That said, it definitely has a large learning curve and is very difficult. To be honest though, that's the entire reason I play it. The sense of achievement and accomplishment when you beat your opponent is unlike anything I've felt I'm gaming. It's incredibly rewarding and supremely difficult but always worth it in my opinion.

patientgamers,3d0r71,CuriousBlueAbra,13,Tue Jul 14 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"No.  I played Starcraft and Starcraft 2 almost religiously for a long time and left with a terrible taste in my mouth. Blizzard does not make improvements to this game for a newbie, they design specifically for the pro scene. Meanwhile, because you actually bought the game with your own money, there is little incentive for Blizzard to provide you with unlocks as you progress, everything is up front. With a free to play model, developers are required to implement a drop system or provide some sort of reward for repeated play. In Heroes of the Storm Blizzard learned this and has individual characters and accounts level up depending on how much you play them.  On top of that, Starcraft 2's main feature is the ladder. The ladder feature is the best though out part of Starcraft 2. Unfortunately, it's terrible to play. Ladder is a grind whose only reward is being higher on the ladder. Once you've selected a race and play leisurely, you're going to max out that race's level pretty quickly and after a week you're done. Now you just have anxiety every time you decide to queue up for a ladder match. Why? Because when you fail it's only your fault. It's your fault you lost in 4 minutes because you didn't find the cheese-y moves fast enough, you didn't build workers at the right time and you didn't know the counter build. You didn't do your damn research. And that's why you failed, dammit, so pull up your big boy pants and get back in that ladder queue and get better.  Did that last bit sound unnecessarily angry and ranty? That's the speech Isorta had to listen to from myself on the regular to get myself out of slumps. Did beating myself up over my hobby and how I spent my spare time feel good? No.  So no, don't get into it. It's not healthy. The campaign is nowhere near as good as it was and they retconned out anything that might have seemed like an interesting through line. Within Starcraft 2 itself, too. Breaking the campaign into three separate ""expansions"" for each race means you don't even get the entire story at all. If you want a good RTS story, play the original over again. I'm sure you can find it at WalMart or GameStop still for $10 for the battlechest at the most.  But for the love of God, don't give Blizzard money for the wreck that is Starcraft 2."

It gives no satisfaciton, because the more you play, the more you realize you suck, just frustration because you can still loose from lesser players if they do cheecky strategies (happens a lot, in 6 minutes can you loose the same ladder points you earned in a 40 minute game)."

However if you're just looking to play super casually and aren't super amped for the characters/setting/storyline it might not be for you, so be warned.  You should get matched fairly quickly with people around your level, but to develop your skill set takes a good deal of patience and time.  I guess my answer is, it depends what you are looking for.  Personally I love StarCraft, would recommend.  If you are really wanting to get into a game, yes, go for it.

patientgamers,3d1dgz,DWRoelands,6,Mon Jul 13 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Ages ago I did, but now only when setting up a character (looking to make sure I don't max out a skill that's useless) or if I get stuck on a puzzle.  I remember playing Final Fantasy 7 with the guidebook open in my lap. It was fun, but I didn't do ANYTHING if it wasn't in that guide (before internet days). I think it was good, but I wish I would have risked dying or getting lost instead of going with so much hand-holding. I did the same with Metroid Prime, but those games always confuse me anyway. Eventually in the internet days I played Star Wars: KOTR with a guide to make sure I got every single Light point I could. This again kinda ruined the experience, and I certainly felt like the plot was spoiled because I was reading so much online.  Eventually in the internet days I played Star Wars: KOTR with a guide to make sure I got every single Light point I could. This again kinda ruined the experience, and I certainly felt like the plot was spoiled because I was reading so much online. It was good since the games got increasingly more complex, but personally I had to resist the urge to just keep reading and spoiling more from myself.   I did though eventually decide I want to experience more of the games. So for Fallout 3 years ago I went in blind and only referred to stats when creating my player and the occasional path to take so as to avoid specific plot outcomes."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,justabaldguy,5,Sun Jul 12 19:10:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that going in blind has its advantages and it's really cool to find stuff on your own but I don't replay games, so I want to experience most of the content in one go, which means looking into guides beforehand and trying to avoid spoilers to see if there's anything that'd lock me out of stuff, etc. I also like to know what I'm up against in general, like how many levels or areas there are. plus character builds because to me everything looks good (lockpicking, hacking, this weapon, that magic thing, whatever) but it's usually better to concentrate on certain skills. I'm bad enough at games as it is, no need to cripple my character any further with bad ingame skills.  I gotta add, though, that following a build can be kind of disappointing, as much as it is effective (and being able to reduce dying and/or frustration is a huge thing for me). from recent memory torchlight 2 and jade empire come to mind. I'd read up on what skills to put points into and it worked out great in both cases but then I looked up a few random gameplay videos and saw all the different attacks/skills/whatever at work and they were pretty great too. not enough to warrant a replay or risk an efficient build but still. and it's gonna be the same (well, worse) in the fallout games and some others where no matter what, I'm gonna lock myself out of stuff anyway."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,Dohi64,5,Sun Jul 12 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Most games I try to play through normally as the discovery is part of the appeal.  I don't like using guides unless I'm really stuck and even then I should try and be more patient before resorting to a guide.    The types of things that I do look up would be Pokedex guides for what level Pokemon characters gain moves so I can plan their move set (but not a general walkthrough, I'd rather discover as I go) and where I can get certain items in WoW because that's not the sort of thing I want to spend time bumbling around with hoping I'll randomly find the right item somehow.  In fact WoW is probably the game I research most because of just how much time everything takes, you don't want to waste it and frankly you probably wouldn't know half of the things about the game like which old world bosses drop which mounts if you didn't look them up.   The main other example I can think of that you might need to look up is hidden achievements.  Nice to get them as you go but more likely that you'll need to look them up."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,squashed_tomato,4,Sun Jul 12 19:59:13 2015 UTC,"I realized many years back that I enjoy games more just playing them, rather than trying to min/max. I'll use a guide if I decide to go back through a second time to achieve 100% or something.

I'm of the mind that you're robbing yourself of the experience using a guide from the start."

patientgamers,3d1dgz,qx87,3,Mon Jul 13 13:03:10 2015 UTC,"I never use walkthroughs unless I'm stuck on a puzzle or don't know where to go/what to do after trying to figure it out for 15-20 minutes.  I enjoy the sense of discovery like you and others have said in this thread already and if I know how a story plays out beforehand I find I'm not that interested in playing it.  A spoiler is a big deterrent to me, though I've known some people who want to know the whole story for a game or TV show or movie before they put their time into it, which just seems like a waste since there's no mystery or excitement when something happens."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,rarelypost,3,Sun Jul 12 20:58:37 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with using guides.  I usually don't use them in rpg's because it's often nice to discover how things work.  But when it comes to some of these adventure puzzle games... HELL YES!  I've been stuck in few games where you have illogical puzzles and gazillion items in inventory and trying to combine everything together, nothing working and going through all the map trying every piece of environment to work with whatever you have in your inventory.  It takes sometimes too long, so I'd rather use a guide than stop playing the game for a long time.  I enjoy a good challenge (45 hours in Dark Souls) but that puzzle shit is infuriating."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,SplitArmada,2,Sun Jul 12 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls is an interesting example because frustration is almost a built-in part of the game.  On the one hand, part of what I love about that game is the sense of discovery and the fact that it doesn't give you a clear roadmap for what you're supposed to do.  For that reason I avoided looking stuff up online for a really long time.  Then there came a point where I spent hours slowly inching my way through a really difficult section of the game, only to end up at a boss who I had absolutely no chance of beating (at least not without many more hours of collecting souls and leveling up or enhancing equipment).  I finally looked up a walkthrough and discovered that there were three or four other big areas of the game that I should have done before I even went to where I was.  So I high-tailed it out of the difficult area I was in and went back to tackle those more reasonable challenges (of course those areas were a cakewalk after the grinding I had done in the more difficult section).  It was cool that the game allowed me to do that, and I would probably have eventually found where I was supposed to go, but chances are I would have just got bored of the game in my searching, and the walkthrough let me skip that frustrating period of aimless wandering and continue enjoying the game."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,OkayAtBowling,3,Mon Jul 13 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"For older games in the JRPG genre, I definitely use a guide. I'm not that great at figuring out where I'm supposed to go... and I enjoy playing through them, so I definitely have a walkthrough for older games. Beat FF1 that way, and working through FF2 and FF3 that way right now as well... much more enjoyable to me, honestly. I just don't do that well without an arrow pointing me in the direction I should be going."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,TypeAskee,3,Mon Jul 13 05:38:31 2015 UTC,"If I hear that there is some content that you only have one opportunity to get (that is, if you advance past it, it's gone forever), then I will look up enough information to make sure I don't miss it. Other than that, only if I'm totally stuck trying to do something.  An annoying habit I've found in the past is that if I use a walkthrough to get through one part, I continue reading it as I advance further. I have to stop playing and come back later to prevent myself from just following the walkthrough the whole way."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,superiority,2,Mon Jul 13 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"I prefer using a guide for the multiple choice pics, I usually decide what I'll decide then go and have a look at an online guide.  I don't have the time these days to play through a game multiple times like I used to so I need to make the most of it the first time.  Tomb Raider was an issue, I had to replay it for 2 achievements."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,CrawdadR,2,Sun Jul 12 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"In striking a balance between completing games quickly and on somewhat of a schedule (i.e. backlog management) but still enjoying games, guides are sometimes tempting for the hardest or most obtuse moments of a game.  At the same time, using a guide limits the discovery aspect of gaming, which can often be the most exciting part.  After years of working on this internal conflict, I still haven't perfected a balance.  That being said, the sense of discovery doesn't apply to settings-tweaking for me so PC Gaming Wiki is never off-limits, though some might argue it's a guide of sorts."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,theorem_lemma_proof,2,Sun Jul 12 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"For me it's a matter of keeping a certain pace of feeling like I'm accomplishing things, as I tend to put games down if I start feeling like I'm just slogging through. I actually tend to avoid puzzle games and skill/time challenge platformers because of this; it's just not fun to punish myself repeatedly on the same content when I have a limited amount of time to play.  Also, modern games often have wikis that are really great at quickly looking up focused information that doesn't include too many spoilers. This comes in handy for getting some assurance that I'm not missing anything important/useful from a particular area in a game, without worrying that I might be giving up overall control of my progress to a walkthrough.  Some games are also pretty much designed with the expectation that players will look things up (Terraria, Dwarf Fortress...), and some older games (especially RPGs) are just way too punishing unless you have all the time in the world to devote to mapping them at the same time.  I still want to go back and try to beat Starflight on PC without a walkthrough, even though I've done it with one. Trying to piece together in-game clues is half the fun, but I first played that game when I was too young to have the patience or skill to do that."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,HunterZ0,2,Sun Jul 12 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on the game. For games that have significant missables/trophies, I usually use a guide so I am getting the most out of my playthrough. Also games that have dozens of hidden trinkets to find (tomb raider) i'll use a guide so I don't have to dig through every nook and cranny of the map.  But for just-for-fun type of games, I go in blind. Games like borderlands 2 or just cause 2 don't really need them because you can pretty much do what you want, or trying to 100% is just a waste of time.  Basically, I have dozens of games on my backlog, so I want to get as much as a can done in one playthrough. If the game is fun enough the first time, i'll play it again blind but keep what I learned in mind so I can get the best experience possible. Honestly, the joy of discovering my own way through a game isn't as strong as my desire to complete as much as a can, or the regret I feel when I miss something big, because I tend to power through games as quickly as I can and often end up missing stuff."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,Ozorgo,2,Mon Jul 13 01:18:05 2015 UTC,"No guides for me, mostly because I enjoy figuring everything out for myself and not worrying about doing everything perfectly. It's also partially because I don't want to know what'll happen next. Every now and then I might use a guide to get back on track if I'm going in circles for too long, but that's a last resort. I generally don't go for 100% on games unless I really like them (and thus willing to replay them), so the possibility of missing things doesn't bother me too much."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,pkGamerB,2,Mon Jul 13 01:36:05 2015 UTC,I like the surprise of playing through the game on my own the first time. I only use walkthroughs if I am completely 100% STUCK and can't get anywhere in the game no matter how much I try.
patientgamers,3d1dgz,supenguin,2,Mon Jul 13 15:27:42 2015 UTC,I only use guides if I'm stuck. But then I don't hesitate.
patientgamers,3d1dgz,RisingRapture,2,Mon Jul 13 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"I'll use it if what I need to do is stupid and full of luck. What I mean is that if the game makes me have to walk around to find some hidden orbs, it's just a waste of time to do these tasks that are 100% luck."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,AmuseDeath,2,Tue Jul 14 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"A part of me wants to avoid guides at all costs...but I have a lot of games to play and not much time. So if I hit a difficult spot, I use a guide to get through.  As a child I remember being totally frustrated when I got stuck at certain parts in games and usually giving up. This was before the internet was accessible enough to look information up without booting your mom off the phone to dial up on Netscape. Jesus...it's hard to imagine a time where you weren't able to look something up via smartphone in 2 seconds."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,InvadeHerKim,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"I usually do a blind playthrough my first time. Then I check a guide for anything I might have missed for a second 100% complete run.   That said I'll sometimes google hints if I'm really stuck on something during my first run, I don't even want to think about how many hours I've wasted because I couldn't find a button or switch right under my nose."
patientgamers,3d1dgz,RPGSorcerer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:31:00 2015 UTC,It depends on what genre of game. RPGs I usually read guides or at least some analysis of leveling and character creation options. There is nothing more frustrating than accidentally creating a sub-par character in a 40 hour game and simply having to deal with it.

On a more lighthearted note, I love how much more lively the Normandy is in this game. Seeing the crew and my team interact with one another and move throughout the ship is pretty cool, and the board with the names of fallen soldiers is a really nice touch."

patientgamers,3d0igb,pkGamerB,3,Sun Jul 12 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"That Garrus conversation is hilarious, as are most of the chats he has with Tali. It really makes them all seem like friends who've been through a lot together, but still take time to just shoot the shit every now and then."

patientgamers,3d0igb,pkGamerB,3,Mon Jul 13 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I looked it up shortly after I finished the mission. I think it requires you to make a certain set of choices in ME2 and ME3 prior to that mission, and then it opens up the third option. I hadn't made the right choices."

patientgamers,3d0igb,pkGamerB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the DLC is so expensive. I'm playing on PS3, so I don't know how much it all costs on PC, but I spent around $50 on all of the important ME3 DLC (From Ashes, Leviathan, Omega, Citadel) because I'm already so invested in the game. I just couldn't help myself. However, I did get the whole ME trilogy for $15 total, so that made me a little more willing to splurge, considering how much I've enjoyed the series so far."

It felt like finishing your favourite series of books, where you just want to put down everything and reminisce about the story and characters.    The characters felt quite real in this part, both on ship and when you visit Citadel, it was a very nice change. I didn't move around the ship much in last few story missions, the things were just too intense to waste any time , so I probably missed few conversation, but my favourite conversation would be between Garrus and James, where they both boost about their achivements. That was fun."

I am working on some of the lower level quests and contract until I get caught up to the ones that are around my current level and then I will finish up the first act. Amazing game."
patientgamers,3d0igb,justabaldguy,2,Sun Jul 12 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Are you playing Witcher 3 on a console or PC? I'm thinking of breaking my waiting rule and grabbing this, but keep hearing mixed reviews. Have you found many game breaking glitches or issues?"

patientgamers,3d0igb,justabaldguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! I've been on the fence since most of the gameplay videos see to me 80% cut scene. I'm hoping for something I can play along the lines of Fallout, but until F4 drops I'm really contemplating grabbing Witcher 3.   If you have time, I'd love to hear about how much of the game is cut scenes, how free you are to roam and accept missions, or anything else you want to tell me about."
patientgamers,3d0igb,siccoblue,2,Sat Jul 18 23:15:26 2015 UTC,"Sure, the free roam is handled like most open world games except that it's split up into 3 areas you can move between, one small/medium 1 large, and one absolutely massive (in total I believe they said it's about 20% bigger than skyrim)  Cut scenes are.. Common I guess? Pretty much like most games, only at main points during missions and even then, the conversation is dynamic kind of like fallout where you have multiple options of how to respond and such  One of the really cool parts about the game is the choices you are given, without spoiling anything, your choices really do have long term effects throughout the game (there's the like 30 something possible endings, but in terms of major endings there's actually 4, the rest are miniscule differences you won't particularly see follow up on, but you know in example, who is left, who you ended up with etc)  Missions are typically handled by roaming around the map and visiting new towns, each town has a billboard with notices such as Witcher contracts (killing special monsters for a bounty, not grinding kill x amount of y) and in terms of side missions and contracts there is a shitload of stuff to do, not including the main story which is a good 20-30h alone  Leveling is handled 90% through mission progression, 10% combat, so you never really fall behind leveling, and need to go grind out killing stuff to reach the level you need to be, it's handled like a lot of MMOs in terms that if you aren't doing missions that are around your level, you get huge xp penalties, which keeps you around the right level for what you are doing at the time.  The max level is 70 right now (haven't really checked but I'm guessing that mostly means 100% progression, I could be totally wrong) it'll be raised to 100 with an expansion  The company who made it, is seriously a fucking rockstar, pre release they come out with a statement saying, patches will be open to everyone (even those of you who didn't buy the game) because we genuinely just want people to enjoy the hell out of this game, regardless of if they had the means to afford it (I've seen many a post on the Witcher sub, of people who pirated it and very very quickly decided to buy it because it was so well done)  They get out patches incredibly fast and listen very closely to the bigger communities such as our sub, and patch in the things people ask to be fixed (better movement handling, more slots in the backpack so it feels less cluttered, moving lights you turn on and off away from chests and fast travel signs so they don't conflict when trying to use either of them)   The game, is fucking beautifully done and it was done by a company who was almost unknown (I'd never even heard of this game until 2 weeks before release, and picked it up on a leap of faith) but are also setting the bar pretty damn high for other companies in terms of listening to their players, and releasing a beautiful, AAA high quality game right out of the box with almost no serious bugs, they also said that anything you pay for after you buy the game, will be true expansions like how they used to be, not dlc style chunks IIRC, he said any paid expansions will be 10-20h  Although one time, Roach your horse, did decide he wanted to fly for me which was pretty strange, but at the same time, made me laugh.  Oh, and I just remembered, on the mission thing, pretty much everything is handled by you, you get yourself there, you kill all the enemies, control the conversations etc, cutscenes aren't overdone, though dialogue is handled in a cutscenes style, which might be why it seems like there's so much"
patientgamers,3d0igb,justabaldguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for these details. Very impressive and it helps me get a good vibe for the game. I hadn't thought about it but if your character has recorded dialogue, these are going to look like cut scenes.   Hopefully I can get some funds together soon as this looks very impressive."

First off, some more Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, still feels a lot like Superstar Saga.  Got a little dark though.  Started Lumino City, which is a little point and click adventure game that looks like it was all made out of paper/cardboard.  So far enjoying it, one thing I liked is that even the hint book that you get at the beginning requires some thought to find the correct page, as it gives a math problem for the page number instead of outright giving it to you.    I got back into Minecraft, mostly for the Tekkit modpack.  This is kind of my first experience playing modded Minecraft, and it adds so much more stuff to do, so kind of excited to go back to that.    Finally, I grinded a little bit on Earthbound, but did not actually progress through the story.

patientgamers,3d0igb,HunterZ0,3,Mon Jul 13 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"Picked up Strife: Veteran Edition for $1 as part of a bundle and have been enjoying it in Linux on my laptop. It's based on the Doom engine but has a story, and you travel back and forth between various places. I would say that it rivals Star Wars: Dark Forces and beats out Hexen as a Doom-era FPS-with-depth.  On my desktop I've been playing some Terraria since version 1.3 just came out. I'm looking forward to the Linux port being released sometime this month, especially now that it has Steam Cloud support built in.  I've also been playing some Dragon Warrior II on the NES, as I set up a retro gaming corner in a newly-finished part of our garage. I made myself a strategy guide by laying out (in HTML) and printing maps and info from Mike's RPG Center, and then putting them in a 3-ring binder.  I've also been flirting with GZDoom + Brutal Doom under Linux on my laptop, as a new version of Brutal Doom was recently released. I managed to slog through Ultimate Doom + Doom II but am getting burned out in the TNT chapter of Final Doom (because it's harder and has more cheap traps, and because Doom gets to be a bit of a repetitive puzzle FPS after a while).  Looking back: Baldur's Gate Trilogy and Dragon Age: Origins are on the back burner because they're just too epic in length to keep my attention all the way to the end. Cave Story is waiting to be revisited because it's hard to find time to play an action game with music that deserves to be heard (I have kids).  Looking forward: Been flirting with Morrowind with MGSO, but I can't commit because of the back-burner RPGs. I really want to get through the TES series, though; I already completed Arena and Daggerfall for the first time a couple years ago (after playing with them on and off since they were new) and recently picked up the Elder Scrolls Anthology boxed set from Amazon in order to get the Skyrim DLC in a fun way. I'm also holding off on Mass Effect 3 until the end of time, because I'm pissed that the only side-quests are the DLC - which never ever goes on sale.  Edit: Oh yeah, I also keep going back for hits of Tales of Maj'Eyal. It's a true roguelike that is also very accessible both in terms of graphics and mechanics."

Also I love the parallel quests that take a new spin on established DBZ events. The voice acting can be a little off, the combat takes a bit of getting used to, and grinding for gear with the game's RNG based loot system can be frustrating, but overall I'm really enjoying it. I hope it was received well enough to get a more well polished sequel.  Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Start Skies I'm not too far yet, but I enjoy the game so far. It has a good class system as well as a classic JRPG turn based battle system. Artwork by Akira Toriyama is definitely a plus. That coupled with the game's whimsical nature, including punny enemy names and status effects like being too caught up in the groove to stop dancing and attack, give it a certain charm that other games can't match."

Sadly a couple of elements are removed by way of DiRTnet servers having been taken down (BOOOOO!) by Codemasters, and thus far I prefer the original game, but will play more and see what I make of it. I like rallying and I like Codemasters so I'm confident I will like this game more with time.  Tales From Space - Mutant Blobs Attack - Saw this on the xbox live sale and decided it looked fun.  Tried the demo and liked it, silly little platformer that it is.  It'll be by dip in, play a level, go do something else game for the next while.  The Bridge - A beautiful little game which again I got in the xbox sale after playing the demo.  It has hand-drawn pencil art style and is like playing in the world of MC Escher, where you manipulate gravity to escape levels.  A very interesting little game and one I'm looking forwards to playing.  I can see myself playing through this in one or two sittings if I don't get too badly stuck.  Crazy Taxi - Finally my ordered copy came in and I'm looking forwards to replaying this old Arcade favourite.  NAh NAh NAh NAh NA!

I'm not a fan of fishing either, though with a crimson rod and the worm+fallen star bait (50%+ fishing power) I don't catch junk anymore. only bass and more bass. and you need to dig yourself in because mobs constantly spawn around you and don't let you fish in peace. to be fair, I got a frog leg, which is nice, and even managed to complete my first ever quest for the angler. but it's mostly bass, and probably because the lake is too small. I did get golden crates and shark picks and stuff from the ocean, so I'll probably have to create decent pools in some biomes myself. although if quests are picked based on available lakes, it's more convenient this way, I've only had regular, sky and cavern fish to catch so far in 1.3.  j.u.l.i.a.: among the stars: it's a sci-fi point & click adventure that I completed a few years ago (came out in 2012) and mostly liked it, except for a few annoying arcade sections. the steam version, released last year, is an enhanced edition with a lot of new stuff and the whole game re-done basically, thanks to crowdfunding, so I decided to buy it and replay it as well. I didn't remember much about it anyway, though stuff kept coming back as I played. thankfully the annoying sections got reworked and the whole game's pretty great now. there's some pixel hunting at one point and a few trial & error puzzles, plus some typos here and there, but the game looks very nice and the story and the gameplay are good too. highly recommended for scifi and adventure fans.  tera (last week): a footnote yet again, I wanted to play it but terraria, man... there's a new patch out though, new dungeons and stuff for lvl65 (so nothing for me), but as I've read the quest markers on the map are gone again. they're meant to be toggleable but they're simply gone. if so, great job..."

I've resisted looking things up until now but all I've managed to achieve so far is explore the map in a limited fashion and upgrading to some not very spectacular gear.  I know I'm suppose to fight bosses at some point but I have no idea how to summon them. Has anyone managed to play this game without resorting to guides or is that the only way I'm going to get the most from it?    Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga I think I'm going to knuckle down and finish this.    Zuma's Revenge I saw this is the current ""On the House"" Origin deal so figured it was worth a download.

I don't mind looking things up occasionally but I don't want to over rely on it because as you say exploration is part of the fun.  It's just being such an open sandbox it's hard to know where to start.  I'll keep chipping away at the game and see where that takes me.  ;-)

The updates have dumped loads of content into the game.  Without a guide you will likely miss 80% of what's out there.  You can work through it with the in game guide NPC but there are so many cool random drops you will likely never get without a farm of some sort.

If your only exposure to this franchise is 2013's Gunslinger, you're in for a different animal here.  The first game in the franchise is a gritty, slow-paced action-adventure with some FPS elements that sometimes forgets how to be fun.  I thought it had more in common with the Ubisoft open-world titles like Far Cry 3 than the often goofy arcade zaniness of Gunslinger.  It would be interesting to see where the other games Techland made for the franchise fall on this spectrum.  In any case, after beating both, I guess they both have their merits and I probably shouldn't be comparing them. Little Inferno.  Another one of those games that I put on my wishlist and forgot why not long after!  Anyway, I played with this for an hour or so today.  It feels at the beginning like an interactive toy more than a game, probably because the story (and sense of progression) seems (possibly deliberately) slow up front."

It was my first Hitman game and I now I really want to play Blood Money. I also completed the games I set out to finish last week, so now I'm focusing on Borderlands: TPS and Saints Row 4. I have several hours in both already but put them down a few weeks back for whatever reason. I've been avoiding buying new games until I finish some of my backlog but Wolfenstein: The Old Blood for $4 (on GMG) is extremely tempting."

I'm really torn between choosing the Order or the Squirrels (I'm not even going to try to spell their actual name). They both do some shitty things but I like Siegfred more than the elf you deal with.   This is definitely one of the best RPG's I've ever played. The fact that I got it for free in a deal where I bought Alpha Centauri (which was itself on sale) boggles my mind."

Also, I just learned that Chapter 2 happens in another place if you side with Iorveth and I'm kind of mad I'm losing an entire chapter of the game...  Played a few hours of  Trove. I was very interested in the failed CubeWorld, so I wanted to see how it was with this one. Man, it's been years since I last played an MMO. The simple tasks, the constant loot, the dungeons... It's a simple game and a great way to disconnect your brain. I don't think I'll stick with it though, I have a lot of backlog to enjoy.  Played a bit of Portal Stories: Mel. I'm just frustrated and looking at youtube walkthoughs now. Thinking of leaving it there and uninstalling."

I thought people where making a big deal about the game having little content and no depth:  I was wrong.  I can't believe people payed $60 for this game at release.  If you could pick up the base game and all the expansions for $60 it might be worth it now.  The  story line is like a dried piece of Jerky.  It probably started out on the drawing board a juicy stake, but come release there is hardly anything to talk about.  There's simply nothing here.  The game has a ton of potential and is a solid FPS, but it stumbles on the story and falls flat on it's face in terms of content promised/delivered.  Now I understand the frustration the Destiny community has been going through.  Talk about a let down.  Maybe Destiny 2 will be worth something."

patientgamers,3czbyu,jeffthedrumguy,24,Sun Jul 12 03:48:42 2015 UTC,"Big tip: For the early part of the game, use melee as much as possible. Loot every bullet. Don't forget to unload the enemy's gun, too.  Make destroying or disabling cameras a top priority. Always be ready to duck back the way you came in case you get spotted. Cameras are the number one source of attrition in the early game, in my opinion.  By the middle of the game you should be comfortable enough, but still try not to waste ammo. Melee every lone, wimpy enemy, and reserve ammo for the tougher baddies, or swarms."

patientgamers,3czbyu,Matthew94,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess I didn't explain that very well. It's that you have to sink so many of the cybernetic modules into just being able to use it that you don't really get to choose much else for your build. And yes, once you have it is very overpowered, but that also removes the fun survival aspect of it. It makes the Many barely any kind of threat and it's just not that fun any more. So it wasn't worth doing to me. I realise that's not at all clear from what I said, but that's what I meant.

patientgamers,3czbyu,thinkforaminute,3,Sun Jul 12 12:01:00 2015 UTC,"It's routinely hailed as one of the best games of all time and was one of the most criminally unsuccessful one.  You really should mod the game to get higher resolution. Won't ruin your experience not to do it, but it's nice to have.  Otherwise, there isn't really much you need to know, I think. This game doesn't need any special preparation or strategy for a first playthrough. You'll probably want to try another playthrough on a higher difficulty and with a different specialization later. You can do your research at that time. IMHO the posters telling you what build you should use, etc. in this thread aren't doing you a favour, they're keeping you from enjoying the game as it's meant.  I'll just say that I wouldn't invest too many points in different kinds of weapons."
patientgamers,3czbyu,happy_otter,5,Sun Jul 12 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"Any advice for going forward into this very detailed space shooter   ...nah   Sorry, couldn't bring myself not to do it (you'll get the reference at some point, OP). On a more serious note, I just finished the game yesterday, and I am going to tell you this: If you don't plan to go big on PSI powers, then don't touch it at all. It's simply not worth it.   If you are playing for the first time like I did, I'd recommend going for a Technician with Standard Weapons and some Exotics (I like the melee exotic weapon). Don't put any points in Repair or Modify, get 4 levels in Maintain and 4 or 5 in Research and 4 or 5 in Hacking (you can max it out late game, as you get a lot of extra modules). When it comes to weapons, Max Standard weapons out and put a point in Exotics by the time you get to deck 4 if you like melee weapons. Don't touch Energy weapons or Hard weapons (though you could put one point here for the greande launcher, but it's not that useful). When it comes to stats, the most important is Strength as it give you more inventory space and more melee damage (which is really useful). Be careful with your OS Upgrades. A lot of them are useless, so that leaves you with 4-6 viable choices depending on the route you choose or your playstyle.  Explore and loot a lot and LISTEN TO EVERY AUDIO LOG. A lot of people will tell you that you will not able to experience everything on your first playthrough, but that's a lie. I did it, but it took me 19 hours (which is a lot, as the average first playthrough will take no more than 15-16 hours). Take your time with it and it will pay off. It is, at the moment, one of my favourite games of all time."
patientgamers,3czbyu,lacsativ,2,Sun Jul 12 11:39:18 2015 UTC,some Exotics (I like the melee exotic weapon).    I did that too and had fun but points wise it is a terrible investment to try and use the shard.  It takes too many points for a single melee weapon when you could have sank the points into standard weapons and got the assault rifle which ends the entire game.
patientgamers,3czbyu,Matthew94,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:40:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is that melee'ing for 2/3rds of the game is a surefire way to guarantee you have plenty of ammo for the endgame, when it's most useful to be armed to the teeth. In my opinion, anyway."

I won't spoil here what they are, but if you are a min-maxing sort of person you might want to look into it. My biggest gripe with the game is that it's very easy to build a character ""wrong"" and end up struggling with an underpowered character. It's still doable no matter what you do, your choices just can make the game more difficult than it needs to be."
patientgamers,3czbyu,DocMcNinja,2,Sun Jul 12 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"If you decide to try playing the original System Shock, realize that you're in for a world of misery as the control scheme in that game ruins it. It's the most archaic thing imaginable."
patientgamers,3czbyu,chthonical,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"There are some mods that make it control a lot more like a modern FPS. I had problems with the mouselook mod, though; it seems to hit a limit if you spin around in the same direction too many times, and won't let you keep turning in that direction until you ""unwind""."

patientgamers,3czbyu,prozacgod,2,Sun Jul 12 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"Focus your combat build on Standard Weapons and the Maintenance skill, and then start dumping points into Heavy Weapons. The game is sadly pretty poorly internally balanced, and focussing on Exotic Weapons for example will give you a frustratingly difficult experience.  I would also advice you to put points into Research, since it is both mechanically very useful an unlocks many little snippets of lore you will otherwise miss.  Other than that, have fun! Dont be afraid of looking at walkthroughs if you get seriously stuck, because the game can be pretty obtuse at times, but be very wary of spoilers!"

patientgamers,3d09ov,Massgyo,4,Sun Jul 12 12:04:07 2015 UTC,"I think a used or refurb PS3 is a really great value buy at the moment, With the HD collections out there; Jak & Daxter trilogy, Metal Gear Solid, Sly Cooper, Zone Of The Enders and Ico + Shadow of The Colossus. Also If you're into JRPG's and the like, there's still a treasure trove of them on the PS3 on disc and through PSN.    And like everyone else here said, if you can buy a PS4 you can get off the ground with a PC build at that same price point, if your decision is only based on cost. Personally I think the PS4 is just a diminishing return kind of purchase at the moment, maybe in another christmas season it might change."
patientgamers,3d09ov,SeekingCephalopods,2,Sun Jul 12 14:15:25 2015 UTC,"Just to throw this out there, can you also add in a Wii or 360 to your last gen options? I don't know if you've already delved into all of those exclusives, but it's definitely something to consider.  I would say buy a last gen cheap to last you until your pc build. The next gen systems right now don't really pose a large exclusive library of games. Most of the multiplats are either on last gen or pc anyways. You'll only be mising out on Bloodborne? and Destiny? Uncharted and Media Molecule stuff aren't coming out until a lot later, so in the long term you can just buy that cheap."
patientgamers,3d09ov,HappyBull,3,Mon Jul 13 02:22:17 2015 UTC,If you buy a ps4 you can also buy a pc. A ps4 would cost you more in the end and a good pc is maybe only a little bit more espensive. I would not recommend a ps4.
patientgamers,3d09ov,Keksus_,2,Sun Jul 12 13:37:34 2015 UTC,"Unless you really, really want the exclusive games, there's really no point in buying a ps4. I personally game ps4/pc/wii u because it lets me touch all bases and games and play with friends (on the ps4) who haven't got a pc (yet I hope), and for exclusives, namely Drive Club and Bloodborne at the moment. Apart from that there isn't really many good games out right now (for the ps4), so maybe wait a year or three for the price to come down."
patientgamers,3d09ov,dariuse1,2,Mon Jul 13 11:38:50 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that at all. My PC is showing it's age, but still more powerful than the PS4.  I prefer consoles to PC 75% of the time. Basically, unless it's a game that is PC only (or the FAR superior version) I'll stick to my PS4. Plus, it's finally at the point where there is a decent backlog of cheap games.  Don't get me wrong, PC is objectively more bang for your buck, but there is nothing wrong with the consoles. It's a matter of preference."

If you're in the US, I've heard there's $200 refurbished consoles, so I think that's worth it. From a patient gamer standpoint, most great games don't really go down in price much (heck Skyward Sword is still $80 in eb Games, even preowned). I personally think it's the best way to co-op couch game, so I definitely think it's worth it."
patientgamers,3d09ov,dariuse1,4,Tue Jul 14 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't buy another PS3, unless there are a ton of games you have left to play on that system. At this point developers are really starting to move on to the newer consoles. There are plenty of games on the ps4 and Xbox1 at this point, I'm not sure what these guys are talking about. And they've been out long enough that there are even some decent bargain bin games. There have been some really good bundles lately, too. As long as you find a decent deal I don't think you can go wrong with either console."

Another thing is that Terraria is far older and has more time to create content.  Starbound is where Terraria was when it was just continuing to solidify its mechanics and other stuff.  It will take time for Starbound to get to an equal footing to where Terraria is.  Starbound has more atmosphere and looks more appealing. However Terraria is far more complete and solid in its mechanics.  Both games have mods, so if that's your thing, you're set for both."

patientgamers,3cwzgd,CptAustus,8,Tue Jul 14 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"Add to that, Terraria just got a major update last week, it goes to show that the game is very viable to purchase, even after 4 years of being released."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Time_Terminal,29,Sat Jul 11 15:29:41 2015 UTC,Isn't that the point of the OP?
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Krossfireo,14,Sat Jul 11 19:00:04 2015 UTC,"I've played about 80 hours of Starbound this week. I bought it maybe 1.5 years ago and never gave it a proper chance, but this time I got hooked. The game obviously has a lot less content than Terraria - as far as I can tell, the developers have spent a lot of time working to perfect their engine, and will start focusing more on content (which someone described as ""the easy part"") in the future. Having said that, there is a relatively large amount of items and stuff already in the game, not to mention a decent amount of mods that are very easy to install.  My biggest problem with the game at its current stage is that it has very little endgame content. Once you have upgraded your ship fully and you have the best armor etc. there is very little to do except to build stuff, which there is really no incentive for unless you just, well, feel like building stuff. So the game does become a sandbox game after a while, which is fine if that's what you are after, but then again there are other games that allow you do to the same thing. Overall I've gotten my money's worth already, and I look forward to future updates."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,PureIdeology,3,Sat Jul 11 18:58:06 2015 UTC,Did you honestly play 80 hours in 1 week?
patientgamers,3cwzgd,xcrunner99,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, I had 2 hours in-game before this week, 89 now. Granted, 4-6 of those hours were probably spent modding. It's a lot, I know. It's been a while since I got sucked into a game like this."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,PureIdeology,28,Sun Jul 12 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"Starbound fairs pretty poorly in comparison to Terraria.  The procedurally generated enemies lack combat style variety. Basically you'll land on a planet and have to figure out which enemies are passive, then which enemies have special attacks that you need to be wary of. There aren't any visual cues for this, just trial and error. Then you'll finish collecting whatever resource you came to mine and move on to the next planet, where you'll have to start from scratch again.  The other shortcoming is not knowing where to find random NPC facilities. You can spend ages looking for a Glitch Castle or Avian Tomb because there is no way of knowing where they are. And frequently there are facilities buried deep underground that you'll miss because you didn't drill down at the right spot to find them.  The pixel printer is an interesting idea, but you'll have trouble finding enough pixels to make use of it. Especially since pixels are dropped on death as a punishment for failure."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Knofbath,2,Sat Jul 11 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"Those seem like issues that could be addressed before the game is out of beta, though; they are fairly specific and could have relatively simple fixes (ie, an enemy scanner that tells you special attacks, maybe another scanner to find NPC facilities, and increase in pixel availability/less dropped on death.  Are there other issues you have with the game?"
patientgamers,3cwzgd,FalseTautology,9,Sat Jul 11 23:38:16 2015 UTC,"That may all be true, but this isn't about how good Starbound could be, it's about how it currently is."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,AkiraZXE,2,Sat Jul 11 23:45:58 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely that's what the OP is about, I'm just asking for myself at this point.  I bought the game the day it was available in beta (april 2013), direct from the devs, so it's moot as far as my dollar goes, I'm just curious.  I haven't played the game for more than an hour or two and that was six months ago.  Comparing 1.3 Terraria to an unfinished gam e seems silly, to me at least; clearly Terraria is superior.  Personally I didn't really care for Terraria until the first big post-release update, (1.1 or 1.2, can't remember), so I'm willing to give Starbound some time.  All the time.  Same thing with Darkout, which is the same type of game; it's been released for a while but I still look forward to more updates."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,FalseTautology,2,Sun Jul 12 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"I'm of mixed thoughts where the progression missions are concerned. They made these large arenas with a ton of interesting stuff in them, that you can't loot...  I think the colony system they are working on will help clear up the intergalactic hobo feel that the game currently has, which is another concern of mine."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Knofbath,10,Sun Jul 12 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"Starbound was overwhelmingly disappointing. The combat feels ""airy"" and kills aren't satisfying at all. The Sci-Fi aesthetic was a nice idea, but it just wasn't an interesting game when I last played, which, admittedly was awhile ago. However, the gameplay doesn't seem to have had a good deal of core alteration from what I've seen from videos and have read in patch notes. The development pacing is laughably terrible, too. It's one of the few early access purchases I've regretted. I hope it improves considerably."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Raelsmar,13,Sat Jul 11 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"Against 1.3? That's not even a fair comparison.  You could compare Starbound to Terraria 1.0 and it might be a balance. Bear in mind that in starbound, almost everything is procedurally generated. So while the game is hypothetically infinite, it feels bland and characterless after a while."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,vonmonologue,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:55:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's not quite fair to compare a game that has had time to perfect everything since release to a game that is still trying to get all of its progression set right.  Much of the quests and progression are still placeholders."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,hijinks_the_turtle,3,Sat Jul 11 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"Well tbh, what isn't a placeholder in Starbound? Techs, weapons, dungeons, planets, pixel progression, NPCs, ore progression, vehicles, ships... Everything is a placeholder and due for a change. Starbound is practically a tech demo at the moment."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,NotScrollsApparently,-3,Sat Jul 11 20:19:52 2015 UTC,The same for Terraria when it was still in development.
patientgamers,3cwzgd,hijinks_the_turtle,5,Sat Jul 11 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"c/p from wiki:   Terraria was developed by Re-Logic, with development starting in January 2011, and is built on the Microsoft XNA framework. The game was released on May 16, 2011.   When it was released it had a completed ""normal"" mode. On December the 1st it got 1.1 which contained hardmode (mechanical bosses, new biomes, practically doubled content). And then it wasn't even being developed afterwards, they continued adding stuff 2 years later, we though they were done with it - but even without it it was an excellent game and a total hit. All that in less than a year.   So I'm not sure what you mean when you say that Terraria had the same system in place with tons of placeholders and slow development time - things didn't change that much over these few months, they had a solid base engine and then just kept adding content to it."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,NotScrollsApparently,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"Sure, except Terarria wasn't an early access game, making that an odd comparison to make."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,OmegaVesko,6,Sun Jul 12 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think Starbound is a good game, but it still needs more love and attention and isn't as polished or finished/final product as Terraria. I enjoy Starbound and have been playing it again recently.  In it's current state I would still recommend picking it up the next time it is on sale.   I love Terraria, but my eyes don't at full screen resolution on a 24inch LCD. My old eyes can't take it for long and lower resolutions don't look right either. Starbound has this nice zoom ability in the video setting and it is much easier on my eyes and hopefully Terraria could add something like that to their video settings."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,tinybadger,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, though, by ""build something"" you mean ""put a 1-thick floating dirt wall between you and the boss so you can take cover and cheese it down."" It's not like, castle building and siege fortifications. Unless you figured out a way to do it that way, in which case that's pretty awesome."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,otherhand42,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:20:49 2015 UTC,It sounds like you played a better version than I did. Turrets and block breaking weren't a thing in what I was thinking about. Carry on :)
patientgamers,3cwzgd,otherhand42,3,Sun Jul 12 01:34:55 2015 UTC,I was researching Starbound recently because I considered buying it (I had been interested in it for months but never got around to it.) and came across this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym7RKzjnRQk  Now the person in the video claims to be objective but I definitely feel he's siding with Terraria. Even so I got enough out of it to know for certain that I absolutely would not enjoy Starbound at all. Although I've only seen gameplay videos and read reviews I think Terraria is better than Starbound by leaps and bounds.
patientgamers,3cwzgd,DataNalle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:21:43 2015 UTC,He lost all credibility after just a few seconds. Terraria and Starbound are NOT 'metroidvania' games. Not even remotely close.
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Myrandall,2,Sun Jul 12 02:24:12 2015 UTC,Quite decent in terms of content in-general. But still unfinished and it's noticeable after 10-15 hours of play.
patientgamers,3cwzgd,NekoiNemo,2,Sat Jul 11 17:05:50 2015 UTC,"Though I prefer Terraria, I'm still excited about Starbound. I feel like i've barely done anything on it but have 33 hours on it so it's not like I didn't get a  decent playtime so far.   And to be fair to the developers, their website constantly updates customers as to what's going on, what's being implemented etc. I think their communication is great."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Humblejustice,2,Sun Jul 12 10:08:49 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in Starbound, you should wait at least another year or two to see if development really gets anywhere. I mean, we just went an entire year without a stable update, and it honestly didn't add a ton of stuff, it was more of a refinement patch. As of right now, it's simply not worth the money."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,triedtostayaway,2,Sat Jul 11 17:49:48 2015 UTC,"Still an alpha game. Fun to play with what's there, but there's not much to do after the first few hours. But the devs are aware of this and still working on it."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,thomar,2,Sat Jul 11 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the only things I like about Starbound are the convenience of the matter manipulator and the better in-universe explanation for world-hopping.  The ship is cool, but it's a building game and you don't build your ship.  It's built for you.  It also essentially discourages you from building a base, since the ship is a really good base.  The bosses are cool, but they're not in-world.  They're in static levels where, again, you can't build.  The progression is really, really repetitive.  Find new resource --> gear up --> kill boss --> get tech to survive on new planet type --> find new resource.  If they were only going to get this much content in a year and a half, then they went early access way too soon and burned through all their hype.  Overall the game has too much structure.  Here is where you mine.  Here is where you build.  Here is where you store stuff.  Here is where you find quests.  Here is where you fight bosses.  And except for mining and building, the only way to get between these places is to teleport.  In Terraria, it's all going on in the same place at the same time.  Ain't no vendors getting gibbed by mobs in Starbound!  Every tier of play is gated, too, and you never need to go backwards once you've reached a certain tier.  You also don't ever feel like the new stuff you got is super awesome.  Like the accessories in Terraria are one of the most brilliant things about it.  You've got to find them all to combine them together to make your superpowers, but whenever you find a new one you're like, ""Wow! This is super awesome!  I am so much more powerful now!""  Starbound's techs... don't feel like that.  Oh, I don't need air now.  I can treat vacuum worlds like... normal... worlds.  Whee?  Starbound's techs remove the depth of the different environments instead of making the player feel better able to traverse them.    Or how the different planets scale with the player and end up being really unsatisfying.  Oh, good, new weapons and armor.  Instead of needing 6 hits to kill, I need only 2!  And instead of dying in 10 hits, it takes 20 to kill me!  Let's go to the new world.  And... I need 7 hits to kill anything here.  And I die in 5 hits.  Why do I feel like I'm going backwards?  And they're all reskins of the same set of enemies!  It's not like going from zombies to spiders to dungeon enemies to flame bats and demons, etc. where the enemies have actually better attacks that challenge you in a new way.  I also feel like crafting is really not that satisfying.  Minecraft is the best at this since you can see all the little bits working for most mods and even for smelting, and the patterns give you a good feeling of doing something.  Terraria is pretty abstract, but that clicking noise when you craft is really satisfying.  And when you want to do something like craft a few thousand bullets, you get that nice ""brrrrrrr"" sound.  Starbound is just... I honestly think they should have progress bar like smelting and crafting, or just overall better sound design."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,da_chicken,5,Sat Jul 11 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"Starbound is a good game.  It has lots of potential and they are constantly updating it,  but it still feels really empty compared to terraria. It's worth the money but it's  not nearly as complete and fulfilling as terraria."

patientgamers,3cwzgd,vonmonologue,3,Sat Jul 11 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"Can't be mad at people seeing ""good"" and thinking ""Terraria"" :D"
patientgamers,3cwzgd,d_bo,0,Sat Jul 11 17:11:40 2015 UTC,"While not exactly a proper pause feature, you can now ""save and quit"" the game at any location, which will take you to the main menu. When you continue the game, you will spawn back in the same position (perhaps with the exception of main dungeon quests, in which case you would probably spawn back on your ship). Personally I just tend put a few blocks around me if I need to leave the computer for a short period of time - this works seeing it as Starbound has no enemies that can go through walls at the moment."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,PureIdeology,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:56:57 2015 UTC,Terraria is still the king. Starbound has some potential but sadly hasn't really moved forward since it's early access release and has actually taken a step back in some areas.
patientgamers,3cwzgd,testikron,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:33:30 2015 UTC,Starbound still doesn't have as much content as vanilla Terraria. Terraria is absolutely massive in comparison. It's like an anthill vs a skycraper in terms of size and content.
patientgamers,3cwzgd,KingVape,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised at the Starbound hate in this thread.   It's obviously not finished yet, but it gets updates regularly and the devs are always talking and listening to the users.   I hear a lot of complaint about the combat in starbound but frankly the game isn't about combat, it's about exploration imo. And it does a great job at that.   Personally I like Starbound better for the feel of the game, the lore, and atmosphere."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,chrom_ed,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:40:02 2015 UTC,"Hopping on here because I feel about the same way. It's in alpha, so expect some limitations in features and content. The foundation and mechanics of a great game are there, and it will hopefully blossom beautifully just as terraria did. I don't regret paying for it in alpha, if it turns out half as good as I hope it will be a game I'll enjoy for a long time."
patientgamers,3cwzgd,Ezekiels_Dry_Bones,0,Sun Jul 12 00:35:51 2015 UTC,I'd just like to quickly point out to everyone bashing on Starbound that it's in extremely early Beta and when it's fully released will have a lot more polished gameplay and features. That being said currently I find Terraria more enjoyable at the moment. I do like Starbound as well!

patientgamers,3cxn8g,McMurphyCrazy,6,Sat Jul 11 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"I have almost 200 hours in the game on PC, so I figure I may chime in.   Yes, the pacing really is not the strong suit of the game. There is a big valley of nothing-ness almost right down the middle. The DLC does a little bit to help with that, but most of the mid-game revolves around simple side-quests.  I'm not sure what you mean by slow combat, though. It is quite easy to out-scale the game very early on, making most fights trivial.  If you are looking for RPG's with better stories, I'd tend towards Dragon Age: Origins, Fallout 3 and New Vegas (if you don't mind older games, Fallout 1 & 2 are great, too), the Mass Effect trilogy, the Witcher trilogy and the Elder Scrolls titles. Mass Effect comes closest in terms of combat style, even if the games focus more on shooting.  Depending on how far back you are willing to go for story, and if you have a PC to use for gaming, I'd definitely suggest Baldur's Gate I & II, Planescape: Torment, System Shock 2 and Icewind Dale on top of Fallout I & II I mentioned earlier."

Had they simply shrunk the size of the game down a bit it would have been much better but pride is a bitch like that. If they could go back in time they should be an improved Fable 1, not a bad Guild Wars."

For me it's more about the gameplay than the story, it's a fun game with an interesting, though not that gripping story. There are some significant moments in the faction quests, and just last night I remember wandering around when this wizard came up and asked for my help in lifting his family curse, but he was shifty the whole time. It turns out . You end up having to find your own meaning in the world of Amalur, and being able to fully customize and hone your character to your specific play-style is what really makes the game for me."

patientgamers,3cwtvq,MrKaneda,7,Sat Jul 11 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"All you have you do is move the pin around to different positions until the screwdriver actually turns.  So like...  Start picking.  Gently try the screwdriver.  If it doesn't turn, move the pin an inch to the right and try again. If it doesn't turn at all, fry the same on the left. When the screwdriver starts turning, you're getting closer to the correct pin position. When you find the right pin position, the screwdriver will turn all the way.  This is also how picking locks in skyrim works. Much simpler than the mess they had in Oblivion..."
patientgamers,3cwtvq,Holyrapid,8,Sat Jul 11 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I kinda liked the lockpicking in Oblivion. It actually made it feel like you were picking a lock."
patientgamers,3cwtvq,Snugglupagus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"Also, i feel that once you got the hang of it, it was actually easier than this (not that this isn't easy, but on the harder locks it's sometimes so precise that one wrong breath and you jam the lock :P) since it wasn't quite as hair thin precision..."
patientgamers,3cwtvq,rarelypost,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:31:55 2015 UTC,I can't believe they didn't use that one for Skyrim. That was by far my favorite part of Oblivion. I don't understand why they need to changed it.
patientgamers,3cwtvq,rob7030,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:56:26 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't turn, move the pin an inch to the right and try again.   By turn do you mean rotate? Or do you mean I have to turn the screwdriver itself? I tried yesterday on a ""very easy"" lock and felt stupid when every single pin broke."
patientgamers,3cwtvq,Holyrapid,4,Sat Jul 11 15:33:38 2015 UTC,Just don't go crazy when you try to lockpick and take it slow when you turn the screwdriver. Once the bobby pin starts shaking and your controller starts vibrating (if you're playing with a controller) then stop and reposition the bobby pin to another spot and slowly turn the screwdriver again.  If there's no shaking just keep turning the screwdriver and you'll unlock the lock.  The good news is once you get the lockpicking down in New Vegas you'll be ready for Fallout 3's and Skyrim's lockpicking since it's the same thing.
patientgamers,3cwtvq,TheJiggersUp,2,Sat Jul 11 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"Both the pin and the screwdriver rotate. The pin is the thing you're trying to align properly, and you only turn the screwdriver when you think you have it lined up right. If you need me to show you, I can broadcast some NV and talk you through the process as soon as TTW is done installing."
patientgamers,3cwtvq,testikron,5,Sat Jul 11 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"If you think this lockpick system is complicated, i don't think you should play Oblivion any time soon, or if you do, don't play as the usual kleptomaniac hero like people most often do in RPG's."
patientgamers,3cwtvq,10GuyIsDrunk,2,Sat Jul 11 15:29:44 2015 UTC,I've never heard of that game. This is one of the very few RPGs I've ever played. Usually stick to FPS style games. But so far NV is great.

patientgamers,3cwtvq,TraptorMaximum,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:08:45 2015 UTC,I got really good at the Oblivion system do I never had to take security as a major skill which was awesome. Oblivion also had a more forgiving auto pick system because you could do it until it opened so if you had enough picks you could brute force your way into anything.
patientgamers,3cwtvq,hellions123,3,Sat Jul 11 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"Here's an example of someone doing it right but I'd recommend saving before each lock. Since you're new to the game, don't forget that you can leave quests you're working on for a while and do others at pretty much any time. so if you're having a lot of trouble with one or getting bored with it, feel free to go do something else. Exploration is a huge part of the game and the main quest is  small compared to the amount of content in the game.  Also you'll probably have noticed this by now but having enough skill points in certain skills opens up dialogue options in certain quests with certain people, it's worth considering when you're choosing what you want to level up.  Hope you have a lot of fun."

patientgamers,3cw8th,speelmydrink,3,Sat Jul 11 08:21:30 2015 UTC,I got the PC version on sale a few years back and really enjoyed it. I never played the originals but as a huge fan of the franchise I was entertained.  Each campaign is unique and has some fantastic moments. It's not super long or complex and the multiplayer is dead but for a bargain price it will make for a fun weekend. Especially if you rewatch Aliens right before you play.

patientgamers,3cw8th,x_X_DrUnK_X_x,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:18:58 2015 UTC,The story for each campaign in the game was fine and if you're a fan of the Aliens and Predator movies you can't go wrong with picking it up.  Both the Alien and Predator campaign play like a stealth game where you have to hide and take out enemies one at a time.  The human campaign is a typical FPS shooter where you'll have to kill both Aliens and Predators as you make your way through the campaign.
patientgamers,3cw8th,rarelypost,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like you made up your mind, but I loved the game.  The aliens campaign was fun stealth/assassination, the humans campaign played like a great horror game, and predator felt a little clunky but good stealth and raw combat.  I enjoyed the single player a ton.  You can probably get it cheaper than $20 but I wouldn't write off the game forever."

You may play Dow 2(its a tactical squad based rts/rpg) but it isn't good enough compared to its predecessors.

I know for a fact that the writing was laughable even on release, and it will probably look even worse by now, but the gameplay was really good at the time and has probably held up well. I had by far the most fun playing the Dark Crusade expansion. If you have played Company of Heroes you will recognize many design decisions.  Dawn of War 2 is good too, but very different. It can barely be called an RTS (missing the strategy part) and is more of a tactical squad-scale action game. Plays more like a MOBA than an RTS in my opinion."

I've heard that they're addictive and that they have big open worlds with lots to do.  I guess I'm just too scared of how big the game world is. I'm more of a fan of short games that deliver well within short hours like Portal or Brothers. I feel like I will be too overwhelmed with these games and just be too tired.

Try Fallout New Vegas, I feel like that game gives you good direction to start off with, whereas other Bethesda games don't try to steer you very hard. Fallout NV basically starts off with ""Hey, that guy who shot you and left you for dead, he was heading in that direction. Want to go get him?"" You basically follow his trail all the way to the big city, and there are distractions along the way that you can get into at your own pace. I found the main quest line much more compelling and more of a driving force than in, say, Oblivion. New Vegas makes the whole thing personal."

patientgamers,3cvemy,-ParticleMan-,4,Sat Jul 11 08:44:07 2015 UTC,"But the reason those games are so good is becaue of the exploring and the side stuff, the story was okay for Fallout 3 but everything else in addition to it, strengthened the story and the overall experience."

I own it but haven't played it yet. I think I will not like it as much as most people seem to. The praise seems to be to the effect that it ""subverts"" the standard military FPS by making you feel guilty for the suffering you inflict or something to that effect. To me that just sounds like a cheap trick to reinforce the kind of anti-war moralism that all educated people are already supposed to believe in these days.  I think in our day a ""subversive"" tale about war would unembarrassedly show the joys of war alongside the agonies.  I am also a doubter of TLOU. I do not own a PS3/PS4 and I don't think I ever will. But I doubt I will take it as the proof of games as art, where art means something like the potential dramatic or narrative quality that we find in novels and movies.  I think video game writing can be excellent but I think people are looking in the wrong place for examples of good video game writing. It's usually on the comic side - some of the conversations you can eavesdrop on in ME2 and the Thief games, for example. Or incidental character writing in for example LA Noire. I think video game writing is one piece and not necessarily the most important piece of a game. It's good writing when it serves its limited purpose well.

I'm going to be down voted like hell for this, but I personally found Spec Ops to be really mediocre (and not just due to the gameplay, which had absolutely no need to be as intentionally meh as it is. The story itself just felt emotionally manipulative at times, which is always a personal annoyance for me whenever media does it).  And, as someone who does think that games are absolutely an artform (though I hate how almost every other gamer wants to find ""proof"" of it, as if they need to validate the entire medium in front of all the film and literature snobs who insist that it absolutely isn't) and as someone who adores The Last of Us, I personally think that you wouldn't consider it to be art when going by your definition, but that's just me."
patientgamers,3cvemy,poomcgoo8,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:32:59 2015 UTC,"Do you think all forms of artisanship can be said to be art forms?  I mean for example cooking or jewelery-making. I think you might be referring to games as an art form in this sense, as things that can be beautifully made and with great expertise.  But I don't think that's the sense of ""art form"" that someone like Roger Ebert denied. And likewise I don't think that to that sort of art form attaches the special prestige that some people seem to covet for games.  To me the distinction between games and fine arts is immediately perceptible but hard to grasp. The crucial point seems to be that we play games but we do not play art (in the sense of fine arts).   I think the desire to read a novel or watch a movie has to do with the desire for truth. We want art to be true, not false or phoney. We don't expect or require truth from games. They can be completely unrealistic in any sense of that term. They can even be so abstract that they don't have anything to do with truth or falsity. We just want them to be enjoyable.  Look at the criticisms we apply to art that we think is bad. They all seem to revolve around falseness - pretentious, preposterous, imitative, derivative, trite, maudlin, mawkish, banal. They all suggest something not true or genuine.  How many of those are applied to games as such, as opposed to the writing found within them?  I think what we want from games is not what we want from the fine arts, and consequently what makes a good or bad game is not what makes good or bad art.  I don't want to drag this out as I am about to go to sleep. I appreciate the chance to discuss this topic though."

While I agree that they can be considered forms of art in a way, it's impossible for them to convey atmosphere and emotion while film, literature and games can.  I'll keep this brief since I also don't want to drag this out (and also because it's 5AM where I live ATM and I haven't slept yet, but I wanted to get my thoughts out while they're fresh in my mind, so apologies if I don't elaborate enough, if this seems like I'm just rambling, or if this doesn't seem as coherent as I think it is right now), but, honestly, I personally don't agree with this strict definition of art that you convey. Maybe most people read books and watch films for ""truth"" (though, in this current day and age, it certainly doesn't seem like it IMO), but I personally don't. Though my personal taste in films and novels is much more atmosphere-based than narrative-based, and the same applies for games (replacing narratives with gameplay).  I'll also agree that writing definitely isn't gaming's strongest point (ignoring things like modern text adventures such as Counterfeit Monkey and Blue Lacuna), but I feel that it's a shame that that, atmosphere and emotion get shoved to the side by so many people in favor of gameplay just because, well, the medium's known as video games. I get why people who don't dig deeper into the medium would be more interested in that (and I do think that's why we don't have as many well-written, atmospheric or emotional works in it as film and literature (though I'm definitely not implying that there's a severe lack of those kinds of works either. They're just either not well-known or tend to get disliked by quite a decent amount of gamers just because the more well-known ones tend to not be gameplay-focused)), but focusing on one aspect of a medium that's comprised of several... just personally seems wrong to me.  Then again, one of my favorite films is Inland Empire, a film where David Lynch literally just made up the script as the film was being made, and practically means nothing. I love it (and personally consider it to be a work of art) because of it's incredibly strong and immersive atmosphere and imagery, but I can see why someone who wouldn't care about those elements (or at least doesn't care about them as much as, say, story) would find it meaningless (which, again, is an opinion that I actually agree with) or think that it's pretentious (though that's a term which seems to be misused a lot these days as a way to criticize anything someone either simply finds even mildly confusing to them, or doesn't focus on one aspect that they personally consider to be the most important thing about a medium IMO)."

Art communicates with us because a person made it.  Some art is highly functional like a pair of glasses.  Even though glasses were designed specifically for a function - and likely had no artistic roots at all - it is still art because glasses tell us about themselves simply by existing.  A person who is completely uneducated and isolated could find a pair of glasses in a desert and probably figure out what to do with them.  In fact, glasses are SO good at being art by communicating purpose that we often fail to see them as art.  You mentioned that Lynch movie and how it ""practically means nothing,"" then go on describing it as art.  I don't quite know what to do with that one after reading the text that precedes it, but the conveyance of atmosphere (or whatever your qualifications for art were) can not be the threshold for which you elevate something from ""thing"" to ""art"" because it's a subjective feeling inside you.  Art is what made you feel it, just like poorly done art makes you feel like calling it ""not-art.""  I didn't see the movie you refer to, but it told you itself that it ""practically means nothing.""  The serendipity you felt from enjoying that realization is why that would be ""good art.""

For the record, I enjoyed Spec-Ops and TLOU, but I feel they both fell short with regard to gameplay. That tends to be of greater importance to me, so when I play a game that has universal praise but is flawed as a game (and nobody mentions it), it's a letdown. I had this issue recently with Shadow of the Colossus. Great game, but terrible controls (which nobody seems to mention) and the resulting frustration dulled the emotional impact the game should've had.   That being said, if I go into it knowing that the gameplay isn't perfect but it is still worth playing (Spec-ops easily falls into this category), I tend to enjoy the experience much more.

I would definitely recommend that you check out the Mass Effect series though.  The first game is a bit Star Trek like, especially at the beginning, but the second and third games go in a more action heavy direction.  It's pretty easy to remember what the story is in the ME games as it constantly keeps coming up and you never feel lost.  Each world you visit will also contain its own stories that are separate from the main mission, unless the planet is part of the main mission of course.  I think once you get into the game world and interact with the characters and go to different planets you'll find the games don't seem that long at all and weren't a chore.  You saying Dragon Age is a medieval sword fighting game makes me think you haven't played Dragon Age or are maybe talking about Dragon Age 2.

patientgamers,3cug5b,TestingforScience123,3,Sat Jul 11 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"Well Castle Crashers is just easy to get into and the humor adds a lot to the game.  You also level up your characters and unlock new ones after beating the game with each of them, and you can use the animal orbs to give your characters bonuses.  There's just a lot of replayability with the game.  And yeah, I did kind of regret putting Ikaruga on as a good game for a non-gamer after I posted since it is challenging and you have to play 8 hours to even get the unlimited continues.  It's still a good co-op shmup though."
patientgamers,3cug5b,rarelypost,0,Sat Jul 11 00:49:47 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the response, didn't mean to give you a hard time. I LOVE ikaruga.  It's just a little overwhelming.  Can't think of a better one... galaga?  was that a game?"
patientgamers,3cug5b,TestingforScience123,2,Sat Jul 11 00:52:30 2015 UTC,"No worries, I didn't think you were giving me a hard time.    Galaga is a great classic arcade game but I wouldn't recommend  any of the 360 Galaga games as they're not really that much fun.  You could check out Deathsmiles if you're looking for a good bullet hell co-op shmup.    If you enjoyed Ikaruga and like platformers, check out Outland.  I could also recommend it to the OP as well since it's a great co-op game, but again it might be a little too hard for someone who's not too into games.  Edit:  Just remember Outland is online only co-op, so it's not a good suggestion to someone looking for couch co-op."
patientgamers,3cug5b,rarelypost,2,Sat Jul 11 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"oh couch co-op.... How I loved you.  Why have developers driven you extinct like the dotto bird?  Is it really that important to track players that we have eliminated couch co-op?    I mean, for most games these days I could litereally play with friends if I bought a second tv, a second console and a second copy of the game.  I could set them up in the same living room, sit on the same couch as my friend, all for the low low price of hundreds of dollars, but a second controller on the same tv?  ""Fuck you"" says the publishers."
patientgamers,3cug5b,TestingforScience123,0,Sat Jul 11 03:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sometimes it feels like a money grab (and of course it is in some cases), but some games just can't be played on the same console since they'd essentially have to create two separate worlds for each character and that takes up a lot of processing power that one console can't handle.  Some developers also want each player to have more freedom rather than limiting movement by having players share a screen, or they feel two people can't play on split screen since the aspect ratio would get all screwed up and it wouldn't be an enjoyable experience."

My fiance and I also enjoyed playing RE5 together if you're looking for a bit of a challenge. Or, if you're looking for something sort of in-between, I recommend the first Borderlands as a good, co-op multiplayer FPS with an amusing storyline and fun, fast-paced combat that isn't kid's play easy but also isn't so hard that you guys will be dying all the time (unless you have terrible gear, but in the first game at least drops are plentiful and interesting).

patientgamers,3cug5b,matt-h,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:29:04 2015 UTC,"First of all there's a great site called Co-Optimus that has a listing of co-op games for the different platforms.  Here's my personal picks:   Castle Crashers - Very fun beat 'em up with simple controls and a silly humor to it. Lego _____ game - There's pretty much one for every franchise. Pick one she's a fan of, and it's cute, fun and silly. Diablo 3 - Maybe a bit advanced for a beginner due to the skills tree, but a great co-op game. X-men/TMNT arcade games - simple beat 'em up games that came out for XBox Live. FPS games - Halo, Gears of War, CoD - All have co-op campaign games. It's simple enough to shoot the bad guys, and there's typically easy respawns if one of you dies. Marvel Ultimate Alliance - If you can find it, quality top down-ish action game with your favorite marvel heroes. Just Dance/Dance Central - Needs kinect, but a fun, active party game. Rock band - Fun music theme party game. Katamari - I'm sure there's a Katamari co-op game out there. Just can't remember which one. While not a couch co-op game, I do have to give a nod to Journey, a wonderfully artistic game, where you can play with a random stranger and journey through a land together."

patientgamers,3cug5b,rgobtnk,2,Fri Jul 10 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a great idea for someone new to games, experienced gamers underestimate the difficulty new players encounter with handling controllers. I've never dated someone who played video games and all of my girlfriends always had an incredibly hard time remembering to move both analog sticks at the same time until they had more time spent with games. I think an fps would be too much for a new player, the goal is to ease someone in to using a controller and learning how to orient their character on a screen with that controller."

There are tons of video games that aren't first person shooters and appeal to more casual players.

patientgamers,3cug5b,triedtostayaway,0,Sat Jul 11 19:08:46 2015 UTC,You are correct: no one has to play anything. I guess my point was that a large chunk of couch co-op games are FPS and they all have pretty much the same controls. It is going to be awkward for everyone not used to the controls and will take some time and patience.

It's also wicked fun and funny.  You say you don't think you have time for Skyrim. That's true, the game takes years to fully explore, but 30 hours in Skyrim is a great chunk of time to get a character to an impressive and fearsome level."

patientgamers,3csfwx,Gaminic,7,Fri Jul 10 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"Then honestly I'd recommend TLOU. It's short enough to get it finished in time (and I strongly recommend you play through it on hard) and it has a pretty awesome multiplayer that you can play for breaks from the story or to eat up more time. Also, in the future you could return to the multiplayer if you get some more free time occasionally."

Skyrim for example. If you just play like... Bioshock style games, youll be doing the same storyline for hours and hours and might get bored. I'd say pick something sandbox-ey. That said, the last of us is a great pick, as everyones said. You mentioned the new vegas DLC- i wouldnt reccommend that, as you can burn through them all in short time.

patientgamers,3csfwx,wdouglass,5,Fri Jul 10 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"If you haven't played the original Ratchet & Clank trilogy go out and get it.  They're all great action/platformers with a great mix of gunplay and platforming.  The games excel in multiple areas:  1) Gameplay is tight and responsive.  When you eat it, it's your fault.  It's challenging without being frustrating  2) Everything is so well balanced.  Gunplay/platform sections are interspersed well so you never get too tired of one or the other. The writing is the same way. The series is know for a lot of sharp, witty laugh out loud moments,  but people tend to overlook the moments of gravitas that really help develop the characters  3) Variety, variety, variety.  Through the series you'll get a number of similar weapons, but each game has ones unique to it, and it really encourages you to try different strategies.    The levels themselves are also extremely varied, with no planet in a given game the same.  Each game has the cliche factories, ice levels, ect - but even each one of them feels unique from the other stages of their type in the series.   And then there's the moments when you take control of Clank himself.  I won't spoil those ;-)  4) Starting in Up Your Arsenal, light but meaninful RPG elements are in play.  Your weapons level up, as does Ratchet"

patientgamers,3csfwx,5in1K,2,Fri Jul 10 13:56:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never really got all the semi-hate for AO. Is it far-fetched for the Batman to meet all of these villains in one night? For a comic arc? Yes. For a vidya game? Bring it on. I really liked that many of the villains were from the Rogues Gallery B-list.   If you like the gameplay in AA and AC, then you'll like AO, except I think it's a little harder/more realistic because you can't instantly counter everything. The shock gloves are kind of game-breaking, though.   Plus it's all Christmasy...and Bruce is a dick.   Those mouths are weird, though."

But the ""you'll tearfully curl over and make painful love to a sack of frozen peas""-narrative is overblown. The procedure itself is mostly painless (a small prick of the needle at the beginning, then some tugging). Afterwards, you feel sore and should avoid any sudden movements, but as long as you keep your movements to a minimum and regularly cool the area, it's not a big deal. There's a reason they don't prescribe painkillers afterwards."

patientgamers,3cq4ri,forkinanoutlet,10,Thu Jul 9 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy! Not the usual cyberpunk setting, but fascinating and entertaining nonetheless. A little rough around the edges, but with a oddly compelling gameplay freedom.  Remember Me. As cyberpunk as an environment can be. It's not perfect but it doesn't have to. It's one of my favourite game: I walked (no running) through the whole experience to savour the brilliant atmosphere this game can create. Also nice combat system and a magnificent soundtrack.  Hydrophobia Prophecy. A nice and fun twist on the action-adventure style (a little more than tech demo in reality). It doesn't often get the cyberpunk tag/status but it has all the ingredients.  Culpa Innata. A 3d point and click non linear adventure. I don't know how and/or if it has aged well, but I remember that I've been really captured by the atmosphere and dystopian setting (even more than the story).   Beneath a steel sky. One of the best adventure game I have ever played (and believe me I have played a lot...like...a lot!). Beautiful story, beautiful graphics direction even for modern standard.did I mention it's free?  Primordia. I would use the term post-cyberpunk if it exists for this one. if you already are confident with Wadjet games, this one doesn't need presentation.  This are my contribution to the list (for now:D) and to your already great suggestions . I'm a huge fan of cyberpunk and adventure games (can't you tell?XD).

patientgamers,3cq4ri,Hamilton5M,7,Fri Jul 10 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"Syndicate (1993) and its sequel, Syndicate Wars (1996).  A real-time tactical game where you send a squad of mercenaries on a variety of missions. I remember being really impressed with the way you could modify/upgrade your squads and the variety of weapons and abilities. These are both available at GOG.com, and though they both feel clunkier in comparison to similar games of a newer vintage, the cyberpunk themes are well done and they're still enjoyable. Invisible Inc, which someone else mentioned, is the spiritual successor to this game. There is also an FPS ""re-imagining"" of the property that came out in 2012, though I cannot vouch for this as I have not played it.  Cybermage: Darklight Awakening (1996) An FPS with RPG elements, where you play as a cyborg on a quest to recover lost memories and stop a mysterious foe. I remember playing this back in the day, and thinking it had an interesting storyline, and some (for the time) features I had not seen in an FPS before - Upgrades! Pilotable Vehicles! I'm not even sure where to get this now other than ebay, and it's been years, but if I could somehow get this running again, it'd be interesting to see how it plays now.  Crusader: No Remorse (1995) and Crusader: No Regret (1996) Isometric action game pitting you as a turncoat corporate soldier against the forces of the World Economic Consortium. I consider these cyberpunk games, as 1) They're set in a future where a rag-tag group of rebels squares off against an all-powerful corporate enterprise,  and 2) There are puzzles involving the manipulation of computers and security systems (although not in a ""puzzly"" way like hacking in later games would be).  Darwinia (2005) An RTS/Puzzle game which has you controlling a squadron of digital AI troops to rid a computer of viruses. Not cyberpunk in the dystopian sense - more in a Tron-like sense. The game is rendered in a cool, lo-fi sort of way that adds to the atmosphere of being inside a computer. Highly recommended.  Edit: I misspoke. Syndicate is real-time, not turn-based. Apparently it's been longer than I thought since I've touched it. :-P"

It's been a long time since I played it so I can't vouch for how well it's aged, but it was pretty innovative for its time, with some semi-realtime elements that meant you could miss certain things if you weren't in the right place at the right time, leading to alternate paths through the game and different endings.  The only problem is that I don't think it's available for sale anywhere online, except used.  Hopefully GOG will pick it up one of these days."

Boss battles were a bit meh, and the story mostly forgettable, but it's worth playing for the combat alone. The coop multiplayer was pretty fun too.  It also gets bonus points for having Michael Wincott voicing one of the characters, that dude is amazing. You might remember him as Death in Darksiders 2, or Top Dollar in The Crow (the main bad guy)."

The old originals (isometric squad based tactical action...?) are rough but still entertaining, and the FPS reboot from a few years back is a brilliant action game.   My only complaints about the reboot a weak script and that it ends a bit too fast, but just playing the game and mowing down mooks is great fun! It flopped commercially, but imo that has nothing to do with the quality of the gameplay, probably just a marketing fuck up."

Once you get out into the Wasteland, you can go anywhere. If you've ever played Skyrim or a similar Elder Scrolls game, you know that feeling. Fallout has a bit more guidance than Skyrim, but the real fun is going out and finding things on your own, and slowly becoming the master of the Capitol Wasteland."
patientgamers,3cvwm9,FreeIceCreen,3,Sat Jul 11 06:17:32 2015 UTC,"Did you ever leave the vault?  I think you'd change your mind once you got out into the Capital Wasteland, which does take about 30-60 minutes from the start of the game, at least going by what I remember.  You'll know when you get to leave the vault, because the game makes it pretty obvious you have to leave.    The fun of Fallout 3 and New Vegas is that you get total freedom to go wherever you want and a great sense of exploration as you make your way through an open world.  You'll also get to see peoples' heads flying 10 feet off their body when you shoot them in the head sometimes."

patientgamers,3cvwm9,axelbigman,2,Sun Jul 12 07:07:06 2015 UTC,"It's a so-so CRPG with landmarks you'll recognize if you've ever seen a postcard of Washington DC. The main storyline makes absolutely no fucking sense. The graphics are pretty shit by today's standards, until the first time you see someone's head explode in slow motion and you realize just how much care and effort went into maximizing the wow-factor of those particular moments. Playing as a brute-force warrior-type class is boring as shit, but the game gets a bit more interesting if you use subversion (thievery/betrayal) and dialogue options to get more personality out of the different characters you meet. There's a sort of 'dream' sequence about halfway through that is extremely well done, and that's what ultimately kept me playing to the end of the game, thinking there might be more stuff like that. There isn't.  New Vegas has identical mechanics to FO3, but they are worlds apart in terms of storytelling, characterization, colour palette, and the variety of hats you can get for your character to wear. I remember exactly the feeling you had when you first exit the vault in FO3 and it's like 'okay, now what'. I feel like New Vegas guides a new player a little bit better, but that could just be bias talking.  FO3 was worth your time back when it came out, but it has been surpassed. Stick with New Vegas and/or Skyrim if you want something with a similar formula but tweaked for a much more interesting and I would say worthwhile experience."

patientgamers,3cox99,oreopizza47,7,Fri Jul 10 11:45:45 2015 UTC,I've been playing Guild Wars 2 since I bought it on its last big sale. Nothing like an MMO to kill time waiting for other games to come out.
patientgamers,3cox99,LukeBoy20,2,Thu Jul 9 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"How do you like it compared to GW1? I played 1 a good bit but haven't touched 2. I did enjoy 1, but I didnt love it. Was considering getting 2 if it is ever on a good sale."
patientgamers,3cox99,data_double,6,Thu Jul 9 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I loved leveling in GW2. Exploring the map is awesome, and the story and lore are quite good. The game rewards you for exploring every nook and cranny, and even more than exp, you get some really rewarding 'easter egg' like finds. The combat is pretty fluid and not too face roll-y if you don't want it to be. It was the first time I enjoyed an MMO since I quit WoW.  Then I hit endgame, and it just didn't click with me. PvP is fun, but I'm not into PvP much. I don't like the way dungeons are run for speed only by the community. Sure it's done very fast, but it's just not fun. It seems like people are just doing work, not enjoying a game.   That being said, it was worth every penny for me. Exploring and leveling are my MMO bread and butter and I had such a fantastic time. Even better with a friend (I've done both alone and co-op leveling and both are worth it)"
patientgamers,3cox99,oreopizza47,2,Thu Jul 9 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to lose imaginary internet points for this, but I didn't actually play Guild Wars 1. I got into 2 because I had the opportunity to see how some of my roommates like it before I ever considered buying it.   That said, I think it's pretty good. I like the community a lot more than just about any other MMO I've played, and there's no shortage of things to do no matter what you want out of an MMO."

patientgamers,3cox99,eyeofvigo,6,Fri Jul 10 09:51:00 2015 UTC,Batman Arkham Asylum.  Truly fantastic game.  Also playing a bit of Gran Turismo 6 and Splatoon.  All really great games.
patientgamers,3cox99,spidersthrash,3,Thu Jul 9 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"I just (re)started Arkham City last night. Bought it when it first came out three years ago, but put it down and never picked it back up about a third of the way through. It's not as tight as Asylum, but god am I having fun! Makes a nice change from my ghost/pacifist run through in Dishonoured too. Batman let's me get out all that pent-up aggression!"
patientgamers,3cox99,LostSoul1797,7,Fri Jul 10 10:11:50 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 GOTY. Bought the original version on console, and while I loved it, I wanted more. It went on sale a while ago, so I picked it up. Helps that I now have a PC good enough to run it. Shame it needs manual adjustments to run. Still, I'm enjoying it."
patientgamers,3cox99,WorkInProgressStill,4,Thu Jul 9 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"Just started this last night. I assume you mean the hurdles to make it run on Windows 8 or 8.1? It took some time to setup, but I once I got it running I have found it very satisfying so far."

patientgamers,3cox99,LostSoul1797,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:45:31 2015 UTC,It's well documented in the Steam forums. A Google search will yield you useful results. It's not super complicated. Just annoying to have to do.
patientgamers,3cox99,hyperblaster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"Just set it up yesterday. All I did to get started was to fix the Windows Live install (uninstall the one you have, reinstall a different one)."
patientgamers,3cox99,WorkInProgressStill,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:16:57 2015 UTC,"Its not that hard, just was an annoying surprise. I have Windows 8.1 and the game would launch to the splash screen but when I hit play the program would just close. There are a few different things that I had to do to get it to work, but there are many resources on YouTube and Steam that are step by step directions. I was irritated that I had to mess around with stuff like that when I have installed much older games and never had any issues."

patientgamers,3cox99,Kantur,6,Thu Jul 9 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"I have to agree.  I had more fun playing through Act V than Acts 1-IV combined and that would've been worth it for me.  With the new character abilities, adventure mode, Crusader and rifts it's a really good deal if you enjoy Diablo 3."
patientgamers,3cox99,LostSoul1797,2,Thu Jul 9 22:04:41 2015 UTC,It's like playing Diablo 2 without Lord of Destruction. What's the point?

I bought this game when it first launched on ps1 (originally a saturn port), knowing nothing about it other than the box came with a bunch of cool things.  The game was beautiful in so many ways.  Dragonquest VIII.  People that have played this game will attest to its greatness.  It is, hands down, one of the greatest video games I have ever played, and I have played a lot.  If RPGs are your thing, you owe it to yourself to play this one.  Rogue Galaxy.  It's similar to a Star Ocean, but in a Space Pirate kind of universe.  The game is not very popular or well known, and I'm not really sure why, because it is an incredibly well made game.  Anyways, hope you like 7.  It's pretty much my favourite game of all time, so I hope it leaves a lasting impression on you."
patientgamers,3cox99,The_Legend_of_Groose,2,Fri Jul 10 00:19:09 2015 UTC,Rogue Galaxy.   I second that game. Really well made and quite underrated. Combat system was really fun also.

I was a Nintendo kid, so I missed most of those middle FF games when they were released."
patientgamers,3cox99,mikethepwnstar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:04:04 2015 UTC,"So far, I'm enjoying it. The story is good, the character development is ok, and I like the background arts and music. The only downsides for me are the camera, the design of the characters (I think they don't fit with the environment) and Cloud's personality seems to edgy for me.  I'm a little biased against the graphics from the N64/PS1 era, but still I think is a really good game and surely I'll play until I finish it."

I used to play Blizzard games a lot, and this definitely feels like a Blizzard game. I also like the fact that you don't have to spend money on it. Being able to try different characters each week allows me to figure out who I like and who I don't, so I can spend my gold on the ones I am actually going to continue to play.

patientgamers,3cox99,frozonous,2,Fri Jul 10 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne: I like this better than Starcraft 2 for many reasons. I like how there is a less of a focus on economy, which in Starcraft is pressing your worker button like a crack addict. I like how there is a 100 food cap which means you have to play more carefully since you have less units. Less units is a good thing because it means melee actually makes sense. The issue I see in Starcraft 2 is that in huge battles, the army with more range has a huge advantage because they can kill a lot of guys before the enemy can even reach them. I like how there are 4 races and how different each of them are. This is my RTS of choice.  Natural Selection 2: This is an update to a popular mod on Half-Life 1. It's a fast and furious FPS game with the humans trying to kill the aliens. Humans have rifles, pistols, shotguns and grenade launchers, whereas the aliens have aliens that can bite, slash, gore, leap and fly. This game is extremely hard however as you must be alert all the time. Marines have to aim at quick moving, wall-walking, units, whereas aliens have to move irregularly to dodge deadly bullets. It's an extremely hard and demanding game and playing any other FPS just feels so, so slow. It's my FPS of choice.  Ultra Street Fighter 4: I haven't been playing this one too much to be honest. My issue with it is that learning is frustratingly trial and error. You'll lose one match against a player who does the same thing over and over. You'll look it up online and how to beat it. Then you'll play online again and you'll fight against another character who then also does another move over and over and then you'll have to figure out how to beat that as well. Basically, learning involves losing 80% of the time. But if you can get past that, you'll get one of the most balanced fighting games ever made, with a huge roster of 44 characters and extremely good online netcode. It's the most popular fighting game in the world as of now and it has an enormous amount of depth. It's my fighting game of choice."

A lot of open world games don't do this, and you feel yourself rushing to finish at some point, cause the middle of the game is getting boring."

Heard a lot of good things about the game, and since I grew up playing military shooters I wanted to give the genre another go. I am not that far in although I was kinda surprised that there are no health bars anymore and you just regenerate health. I haven't made up my mind about those yet but I guess it allows you to focus on getting out and shooting instead of searching for health packs everywhere. Grey Goo (was a gift). Really fun RTS. I am still learning the ropes and was used to the Red Alert 2 mechanics so many things are new to me. I really like the lore behind the races, and for once the humans are now seem like the most ""alien"" race with the focus on being high-tech.  LISA (was 50% off). Again, heard amazing feedback from this game. I am not that far yet but from what has happened so far it is looking to be one hell of a ride throughout. Hoping to get a controller to make it easier to play since I don't like strictly keyboard controls for this sort of game."

The game can be immersive at times, but then all the usual ""Ubisoft game"" nonsense ruins it. Far Cry 4 is a game that desperately needs decent mod support, that could undo most of the stupid decisions that have been made to appeal to the common lowest denominator.

Anyway, I don't have time for anything this week but am going through the original Call of Juarez, if only to see the humble beginnings of the franchise after playing the excellent Gunslinger last year.    It feels like Techland had some good ideas but the execution feels a few games away from perfection.  Unlike Gunslinger, the original CoJ feels like a budget game at points, probably because it feels like a mid-2000s game (well, it is one!) with all the growing pains of the adolescent 3D technology back then, all awkward controls and clunky gunplay.  Compared to Gunslinger, CoJ attempts to be slow and deliberate, a ""thinking man's"" FPS that encourages you to scope things out and determine the best way to neutralize the enemies.  It kind of reminds me of Far Cry 3 in that aspect, except with worse forced-stealth sections.  I'd probably pick Gunslinger again over this were I new to the franchise."
patientgamers,3cox99,theorem_lemma_proof,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:40:54 2015 UTC,I played CoJ a few months ago and liked it pretty well. I thought the voice acting and the writing were the best parts. Some of the more natural levels were well-done aesthetically but the gameplay can be pretty rough.

I loved the two crosshairs getting headshots across the screen on both sides.  Definitely a mechanic that would not work on console without the fast aiming of a mouse, so I see why they removed it in lieu of easier special abilities, but they just didn't have the same satisfaction as having to work for killing everyone on your screen."

patientgamers,3crhj7,Alphyn_dp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:25:53 2015 UTC,"I do agree, since I loved Witcher 1. But, seeing as how they were looking to skip directly to Witcher 3 I was at least hoping to convince them to play Witcher 2 due to it being more accessible in comparison."
patientgamers,3crhj7,Discoteca,3,Sun Jul 12 09:29:57 2015 UTC,"Just my experience with the series so far:  Started up the 1st one a few times now, got to anywhere from end of prologue to mid-chapter 2, and got distracted by something else or got bored.  Now over the last few weeks, decided to give Witcher 1 a real attempt before playing 2 and 3.  Got some mods going, a major one being a movement increase mod (wouldn't believe how much even a 15% faster run speed makes a difference). Well, I got to the end of chapter 2, and one day suddenly it started crashing on load...  Tried a lot of solutions, reinstalls/deleting saves/other stuff, but nothing ended up fixing the loading crash.  So I gave up, watched a few of the recap movies for W1 (including the cartoon recap and a 15min recap video), and moved on to Witcher 2.  P.S. Witcher 1's combat is the most complained about mechanic of the game... and it's got a lot of validity. And overall, the game feels quite outdated. One memorable thing being that a LOT of the quests are tied together, where you can't progress in one quest without first progressing in several others, but half the time it does not make it clear why.  . . .  Installed Witcher 2, got a few convenience mods, and got rolling.  This one is a lot more updated, both graphics-wise, and combat-wise, the second one being a lot more fluid than the 1st game's was.  So Witcher 2 is a lot easier to play, not like difficulty-wise, but being more recent.  Beat it in about 20 hours according to the timer in the GoG app, although i think it got stuck at the beginning, so it could be closer to 22-25 hours.  It was a fun ride. Though I did my best to mentally prepare myself not to think about Witcher 3, and I succeeded for the first 2 out of 3 chapters, where I completed all of the side quests and stuff... got carried away in the last (shortest) chapter, and just rushed through it to get into Witcher 3.  P.S. If you do play Witcher 2, remember to occasionally delete old savegames, so that loading doesn't get too slow, and so you don't get any crashes (and don't have to delete them through the game menu one by one, can just go to My Documents)  . . .  Right now playing the 3rd game, and I'm liking it a LOT.  So to recap, in my opinion, especially being time limited, skip the 1st one, just watch a couple of recaps. Give the 2nd one a shot, it is probably the shortest of the 3, while still being quite a blast. And even if not, then watch both games' recaps, and dive right into witcher 3, which is also really fun.  Alrighty, done with my rant :D"
patientgamers,3crhj7,Yarik85,2,Sat Jul 11 07:42:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, I really enjoyed 2, but if time is your main constraint, I think 3 might be the way to go for you."
patientgamers,3crhj7,destructoBear,2,Fri Jul 10 05:13:29 2015 UTC,I dove right into 3 no problem. Just read up on the events of 1 and 2 first
patientgamers,3crhj7,lorddresefer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"The Witcher 3 was promoted as being welcoming to players new to the series. It's not entirely true, if you don't know something about what has gone before then you're going to be lost as it throws you in at the deep end story-wise.  Witcher 1 and 2 are superb games, but a huge time investment. At the least, you should watch some YouTube videos that tell you about the world, characters and story, and watch some gameplay videos. Even then, you'll feel a bit overwhelmed! Read up on the Witcher wiki too."
patientgamers,3crhj7,LeftHandedGuitarist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:58:48 2015 UTC,"I think you should play the first 2.  2 is a little harder to get into, at first, but it does open up, the story and the choices I find to the best of the series.  Well, overall plot in 3 might be better, I found the sub stories and moral choices to be better/tougher in 1.  You can play the games on their own, but you'll get more out of the characters if you play the either of the first 2"
patientgamers,3crhj7,ACardAttack,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:03:47 2015 UTC,"Play two. If time is an issue, three is not really going to be possible anyway. I just recently finished three and it was about a hundred and thirty hours, and I was not obsessively going to every point of interest.  Two took me somewhere around twenty to thirty I believe. And it's a very good game anyway, so play it."
patientgamers,3crhj7,Anzai,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"I would get Witcher 2 and play first. While the main plot doesn't impact 3 that much, the game is still worth playing as you will see many sub plots that will carry over into 3. I could rant forever about how good it is but in all honesty, just pick it up and play for yourself. The game will hook you in if you let it"

If someone is brand new, it can be hard to know in advance what has gone obsolete and what changes occurred when. As I said above, the people to whom it makes perfect sense (well, of course this change took place since X so now I need to Y) are the people who don't need the videos so much in the first place.  In other words, I suppose I do not so much criticize your advice (very much the opposite!) as agree with it with the caveat to be a bit careful about which help you're looking up -- if you're new to the program, then you may not understand what a huge change took place to rocket design and flight took place at 1.0, so make sure to find videos that address/postdate that."

There are plenty of Let's Plays available to get a taste, but there is a huge universe to explore, lots of ships to buy/fight/board, tons of different weapons and upgrades, and 6 main storylines that you organically stumble upon that are all very interesting plus however many smaller stories you can follow if you want."

patientgamers,3co35a,Attheveryend,7,Fri Jul 10 02:19:19 2015 UTC,"Space Pirates and Zombies.  If you really liked FTL, this game is exactly what you want. X3 Reunion, X3 Terran Conflict, X3 Albion Prelude are all amazing.  Avoid X Rebirth.  X2 games are good, but older games will seem very dated and unrefined. Freelancer (similar to X3 but more focused/narrow combat model, simpler universe and trade, can't fly capships).  Its predecessor Starlancer is also a great game, but completely different from Freelancer. Dark Star One is this, but done badly.  Its not the worst game ever made, but it isn't great.  Though it is still kind of fun.   Space Force: Rogue Legacy is another one of these badly done space combat/trader/explorer games. Kerbal Space Program is ultimately a space exploration game, though it has a large learning curve you must summit if you really want to explore other planets. The galactic stage of Spore will hold your attention adequately in this regard. Starpoint Gemeni 2 is a new addition to the genre, having just released recently.  Its pretty okay for what it is. Void Destroyer is a pretty fun take on the genre, but its more like Homeworld (which is an RTS game) than anything else.  It isn't what you've asked for, but its worth mentioning. check out Starscape.  Its like Space Pirates and Zombies, but beyond that I can't really say much about it cuz I haven't played it."

patientgamers,3co35a,JoPelligrino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:04:29 2015 UTC,You must tell me how they've fixed Rebirth!  How is controller support?  How is the level of content regarding stations and npcs?

The level of content is pretty huge, I think most of the negative reviews are from launch (and they were absolutely warranted) but the game is in such a better place now.  It's definitely not perfect but I would say it is worthy of the X - Series for sure. Anytime I see someone down about the game who hasn't played it since launch i have to chime in. Catch it on a sale and try it out for a bit.   Its much easier to get into than the other x games too imo. They stations are nice , they can get a bit cookie cutter ish as /u/BadWhippet  kind of aluded too but for me that wasn't a deal breaker."
patientgamers,3co35a,Attheveryend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:35:41 2015 UTC,i honestly don't see how cookie cutter stations is that big a deal in the x universe.  They have always been cookie cutter.  Its even supported by lore since there are so few station manufacturers.
patientgamers,3co35a,ithilkir,2,Thu Jul 9 22:10:44 2015 UTC,"No - they were more varied in X and X2.  X3 was the turning-point where we suddenly docked on a docking-arm outside and that cost some of the game's rich atmosphere to me.  I guess I like to role-play my games as though I'm really there - but seeing the same interiors, same NPCs etc breaks the immersion.  It's the same too with a VERY favourite game of mine: Mass Effect 1.  All those planetary bases are the exact same model but ME1 has such a fantastic story that I gritted my teeth through those bits and enjoyed the rest.  The problem with the X games is that it wasn't the story really that grabbed me, but the exploring and landing on stations - so X-Rebirth basically broke the one thing I enjoyed hugely about the series - if that makes sense?"
patientgamers,3co35a,Fourtothewind,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:00:45 2015 UTC,this makes a lot of sense.  I haven't sunk the hours into earlier x games to have seen many stations.

patientgamers,3co35a,Deroni76,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I've played after the few major updates and while the game is definitely playable, it wasn't that fun for me - 80 % of the time I was frustrated by bad AI and lack of control over my ships. Dunno if they changed anything more recently but from what I've seen, there have been barely any news in the past 6 months, maybe more - only one patch with bugfixes afaik. Station management is a PITA, ship automation is limited to few preset choices that all perform extraordinarily badly and the economy is still just bad and ""faked"" - there's no way to repair DeVries since ship AI can only trade within a galaxy. NPC stations also never change, get destroyed or built, and player stations never come under any major attack. There's no global war, just random encounters, and that is something the god engine in X3 did regularly.  I'm not trying to start an X:R hate-train, I'm just telling my experience in the game so other people don't get their hopes up. It might be a fun game to get some minor exploration but there's no real progression or big storyline for such players, or sandbox for empire builders."

patientgamers,3co35a,Relenq,5,Thu Jul 9 13:18:06 2015 UTC,"Ha! I'm so glad someone else mentioned Ur Quan Masters.  The game is incredible.  There's fun music, great dialog that's mostly voice acted (and not awful).  The drawings are great, the design is fun, and it's really, really addictive."
patientgamers,3co35a,Ulti,3,Thu Jul 9 20:22:02 2015 UTC,The ultimate space exploration game. Mass Effect took a fair bit of inspiration from this as well.
patientgamers,3co35a,apoljack,7,Thu Jul 9 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"I did a search on this not too long ago and I really found nothing, although I'll have to check out freelancer below.    Most games I found were more combat oriented games, and nothing like a classic RPG in space.  I found two but both of them were not out yet, but also looked more grindy like EVE.  Good luck.  Maybe FTL can hold you over for a while.    EDIT: HOLY SHIT, I never realized that's what Elite Dangerous was.  I just checked out a video and it looks amazing.  Same as you though, I'd wait for a good sale.    I also wanted to mention Space Pirates Vs. Zombies.  I never really got into it but it looked cool for a low priced game.  EDIT 2: An honest review of someone who put 500 hours into Elite Dangerous"
patientgamers,3co35a,apoljack,3,Thu Jul 9 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Haha, glad you realised what Elite is, sounds perfect for you! Shame it's so expensive D:"
patientgamers,3co35a,eseman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"Unofrtunately, reading a bit more about it, it looks like the game isn't too deep.  Looking at the cockpit interface is amazing though."
patientgamers,3co35a,eseman,2,Thu Jul 9 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"The actual mechanics and flying around are amazing, but it suffers from being so open-ended that you kind of just have to figure out how to make it fun for yourself. The game gives you a good framework, but generally speaking you make your enjoyment for yourself."
patientgamers,3co35a,chrom_ed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:02:24 2015 UTC,"I quite fancy it just for flying around and listening to podcasts, but yeah I've heard there isn't too much depth :/"

patientgamers,3co35a,dougmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"Sadly even 33% isn't low enough to me, I think I'd get it if it hit Â£15"
patientgamers,3co35a,Kirk_Kerman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"Before this 33% sale I would say ""don't expect it to go lower than 10-15% off"", and while quite surprised by this sale, still Â£15 is probably quite a few years away from now.  As an owner of it from January though, I don't think you'll be missing much. It's very very grindy if you want to drive the big ships, which kinda makes sense in terms of balance since they are straight upgrades and very powerful, but still...   It looks very shiny and epic on the tin, but I feel its content is not yet what many expected.  In general, be wary of procedural generated exploration games, as most of them tend to be very shallow. They offer high quantity of uninteresting exploration for the most part, imho.  edit: since nobody mentioned it, I'll put starmade here, it's free to demo without any limits pre-release. Don't necessarily take this as a recommendation though. Mostly added it for completion's sake, my opinion of it is neutral, haven't spent much time with it."

patientgamers,3co35a,LokiCode,2,Thu Jul 9 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that. I played it with a PS4 controller. Hope this helps (from the website):   If possible, we strongly recommend playing Outer Wilds with an Xbox 360 gamepad. If thatâs not an option for you, check out the âInputâ tab of the game launcher window to view/modify the mouse and keyboard mappings.     But hey don't lose hope the game is still in development    Eventually mouse and keyboard inputs will be supported by the in-game button prompts, but for now please excuse the clunkiness.     you can always come back later or borrow a controller"

patientgamers,3co35a,HydrogenxPi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'm given to understand in the original, ships would maintain formations during attacks. The remaster doesn't do that, and whatever clever setup you've got for your ships will fall apart the moment they're in range of an enemy."

I recall formations making a difference back in the day, but when I tried the game lately it didn't.  I attributed it to my failing memory, but maybe not ...  The lack of limited fuel for strike craft is a more glaring omission.  I hear that's because they ported the H2 engine for H1 and H2 and the H2 engine didn't support fuel ..."

There's a bit of a learning curve from controls, and from the last time I briefly checked out the site, the community is largely inactive, but the charm of Noctis is definitely the exploration factor.  There's also Noctis IV CE which adds some features, such as a jetpack and the ability to land on worlds with unstable environments.  Just talking about it makes me want to go and delve into the unexplored reaches of the not-Milky-Way-galaxy once more."

It's more focused on building ships and multiplayer (it's actually a sandbox) but they're adding planets in the next couple weeks! (Maybe even today, they update every Thursday). I think with the addition of planets it could satisfy your thirst for exploration. It's $20/25 regularly but it goes on sale for ~$15 occasionally iirc"

It can get old over time, and the graphics may turn you off, but as a proto-Space Engine with a little more ""game"" to it, it's worth checking out."
patientgamers,3co35a,sonofthunder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"Some good suggestions here. I'd also recommend Ascent, an early access game that's being billed as kind of a friendlier Eve. You play online to explore, mine, trade, colonize world, etc.  MirrorMoon EP might also scratch that itch, if you like/can handle obscure puzzles mixed in with your exploration.  It's already been mentioned, but Rodina is an excellent early access game, as well."

It's super over-the-top and funny but still has a story and is a lot of fun.  You might also give Call of Juarez: Gunslinger a shot.  I just got it recently and haven't played much but it's a fun and straightforward arcade-y shooter.  It's mostly just focused on the shooting, but it does some fun stuff with the storytelling using an unreliable narrator (the whole thing is set up as though you are playing through stories that the main character is telling to people at a bar)."
patientgamers,3cpcpl,OkayAtBowling,3,Thu Jul 9 20:00:14 2015 UTC,I took a quick look at Bulletstorm and only by the pictures it remind me a little bit of a game that I loved called Stranglehold. Call of Juarez also looks like a good one. Thanks.

Back then, people said it sucked but they got their opinions from reviews because when I mention the game now nobody even knows what I'm talking about.  Obviously not a 10/10 game but fun as shit.  Also fuckin love every Max Payne.  The guy above nailed it though, the game you want is Bulletstorm.  Its not exactly similar to MP & SH in many ways - the setting, guns, mechanics etc are all different but the pure fuckin joy you'll get from Bulletstorm FEELS exactly like you get playing the other two.  I read your post, knew exactly the type of game you like (cuz it's the type I like), and began to rack my brain.

Ok, sounds like you enjoy a more linear game play and are not entirely fond of big open worlds with too much stuff to do. So, you might like:   Metro Redux - great atmosphere and really fun mechanics. The stealth is very fun. Dishonored GOTY - One of my favorite games by accident - don't buy the vanilla version, because you will come back for the DLC! Tomb Raider - I loved the reboot! Had an absolute blast playing through it and may do so again. The Uncharted Series - If you have a PS3 or if you have a PS4 this is some stellar gaming! I've played the entire series twice and could play it again tomorrow.   Things I purchased after Max Payne 3, but have yet to play.   Sleeping Dogs - kind of like Max Payne in Hong Kong. Still early on with this, but liking it. It is open world, so you might not enjoy that, but Hong Kong is very atmospheric. Kayne and Lynch - I've not played this, but some people say the tone is very similar. Still on my to-do list"
patientgamers,3cpcpl,Hoolmberg,2,Fri Jul 10 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"Note that Sleeping Dogs is heavily focused on melee combat and has very parts were you shoot weapons.   It is a great game, but I found it plays quite differently from Max Payne."

patientgamers,3cpq1c,lorddresefer,4,Thu Jul 9 19:59:51 2015 UTC,Honestly there probably won't be any more big sales soon I'm guessing since it's one of Sony's flagship titles. I'm actually surprised it's down to 40 considering how popular it became.  Either way if you decide to wait or get it now I'm certain you'll be satisfied if you're into that game style.
patientgamers,3cpq1c,theKAR,2,Thu Jul 9 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was surprised to see it for $40 honestly, thinking I should snag it before price goes back up"
patientgamers,3cpq1c,theKAR,2,Thu Jul 9 21:33:08 2015 UTC,I'd definitely recommend it man. It's still my favorite PS4 game by quite a bit and in the top five of my favorite games overall. It helps being familiar with the souls series but it's leagues ahead IMO.

Never really gave Bloodborne a second glance until now, and it looks really good. Just the right type of dark and miserable, but ultimately rewarding kind of game I've been missing."
patientgamers,3cpq1c,theKAR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"Oh my, if you're looking for a dark tone you should love this. The atmosphere is very reminiscent of Lovecraftian style. As well as when you get into the game, it seems to be one of the most rewarding because it really feels like you're overcoming these difficult tasks.  Since you haven't played it, one of the best ways I can summarize it is that it's like a really hard Zelda game. It's almost all about timing in combat and adventure outside of it.  I do recommend if you get it that you should just try to rush through to the first boss once you get the mechanics (you can literally run past everyone if you choose). Unfortunately you can't level up until you get at least one insight which you gain from both finding and defeating bosses. Don't expect to beat him the first time though, just unlock the leveling mechanic so you have a much better chance later."
patientgamers,3cpq1c,meikyoushisui,2,Thu Jul 9 23:07:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been watching videos nonstop wondering what a fool I was ignoring this game lol I've been too wrapped up in Witcher 3 to notice much else, but every post about W3 has a few people mentioning Bloodborne and how good the combat and atmosphere are. Never expected it to be a proper horror game in its own right though!"
patientgamers,3cpq1c,theKAR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"Haha ya I kept a blind eye to it as well until just before release and was more than pleasantly surprised. And honestly Bloodborne does have much better combat and atmosphere than Witcher 3 IMO. Although they are still very much different which actually made Witcher harder for me to get into because I was expecting a more similar game. I do have to admit they are of about the same great quality though, just in their own respects."
patientgamers,3cpq1c,rarelypost,2,Thu Jul 9 23:31:43 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing with Witcher 3, until a month before release and then I knew I needed to have it right away.

Hoping bloodborne can scratch that brutal combat itch"
patientgamers,3cpq1c,triedtostayaway,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I have no doubt Bloodborne will scratch that itch of yours. You have to be a bit more quick but combat is one of the things that Bloodborne is better in by far.  On the other hand the story in Bloodborne is very cryptic and you'll either have to be a master at reading between the lines or alright with resorting to reading the lore online to fully understand the story (which is awesome IMO, even though I missed a lot of it myself and had to read a lot of what others have discovered)."
patientgamers,3cpq1c,triedtostayaway,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"but it's leagues ahead IMO.   I disagree. Scholar of the First Sin can be had for 40 dollars and Bloodborne isn't nearly as deep. It's faster, but has significantly less customization and not nearly as many weapon classes. Bloodborne's PvP is super boring IMO and chalice dungeons are overly grindey."
patientgamers,3cpq1c,tomerjm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"That's totally understandable, I've known that souls is undoubtedly better for overall customization, weapons, and PvP. Although, for me Bloodborne has met the perfect balance between being more streamlined and still having the combat depth. As well as I prefer the scaling of the weapons. You can use any of the starting weapons sufficiently for late-game or post-game content without them seeming weak whatsoever."

If you're too nervous about the price jumping back up and you really want it now then I'd go ahead and get it for $40. You can also get it for $40 on Amazon right now if you'd rather shop there.
patientgamers,3cobpr,PM_NUDES_AND_TREES,12,Thu Jul 9 13:43:06 2015 UTC,"Might as well wait and see what they have, considering it's only a few days away.

These games aren't going to get worse over time. They will just get easier to run, and for a lot less money.  I'm waiting will GTAV is $10 on PC. Maybe $20. I figure by that time, hardware will be a lot cheaper, and I'll be able to run it for a lot less than people can run it now.  Electronic prices only drop with time. There is no good reason to buy something when it first comes out, other than fitting in, which this comic illustrates.  I, for one, choose frugality over fitting in. I assume the rest of this sub does as well, and considered this comic anti-patient gamer.  To those suggesting this should be our banner: what a terrible idea. We should be promoting frugality and our ability to use self control as hardware and game prices drop, allowing us to run the games better, for less amount of money as time goes on."

And the sub helps me to refrain from spending money, and instead focus on my back-catalogue.   I, for one, choose frugality over fitting in.   But sometimes, for me, modern games less about fitting in, and more about sharing the experience. There are some games (The Witcher 3, for example), that I love discussing little things we've just discovered, as we're both/all going through the same thing. There are also some online experiences that I enjoy seeing develop/being patched/seeing what is OP and figuring out the balance for.  I do enjoy this sub a lot, but I have to fight the corner of the 'fitting in' experience, because sometimes it really is worth it."

Either of those would easily keep you busy for at least three days.  If you like point-and-click adventure games most of the older ones would probably run on your system as well.  Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is one of my favorites and is available on gog.com.  If you can get your hands on some older LucasArts games like Sam and Max Hit the Road, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island or Full Throttle, those are all great as well.

patientgamers,3cmv4q,poomcgoo8,8,Thu Jul 9 06:03:26 2015 UTC,Details? I played the PC version and enjoyed it.
patientgamers,3cmv4q,JiNCMG,3,Thu Jul 9 08:18:51 2015 UTC,What?  I played MGS1 on both PSX and PC and can't remember noticing a single difference past the obvious graphical difference.
patientgamers,3cmv4q,the_frickerman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:47:03 2015 UTC,I played and finished the PSX version when it came out. In fact I played the Japanese demo I got in NYC Chinatown for months before the game came out. My assumption is that the PC version would scale better for the current screens. Playing the PSX version on a 1024x768 would be painful to watch. I have tried other PSX games and they just don't scale up as well.
patientgamers,3cmv4q,JustASeabass,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that you have all 1 to 3 2 available for PC, so I'd say you should get all 3, but make sure that at least for MGS3 get the Subsistence Version, as the camera is greatly improved from the original one.  Edit: 3 didn't make it to PC, I didn't remember. MGS2 has the Substance Version, I think that one had a PC Version."

patientgamers,3cmv4q,ProstetnicVogon,2,Sat Jul 11 02:32:23 2015 UTC,"I like retro games and don't mind simple graphics such as on the NES, but I can't stand the awful PS1 3D.  I'd recommend you play the Gamecube remake on PC using the Dolphin emulator, it's called Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes.  Graphics are much better, and you can improve them even further with Dolphin.  Gameplay (which you care about) is also better and similar to MGS2.  From Wikipedia:   For The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid's gameplay was altered to resemble that of Metal Gear Solid 2. While all of the original areas and enemies were kept, new ways for the player to combat them were introduced, such as the ability to shoot using first person view.Enemy AI was also improved, giving enemy soldiers the ability to communicate with each other and detect the player more intelligently with senses of sight and sound enhanced.   The only ""downside"" is the added matrix-style cutscenes that are not really necessary."
patientgamers,3cmv4q,KyuubiReddit,5,Thu Jul 9 08:24:07 2015 UTC,The Twin Snakes is far inferior to the PS1 version. The new voice acting and music are bad and the first person aim completely breaks the game. Not to mention those stupid cutscenes. The only thing that's better is the graphics.
patientgamers,3cmv4q,ProstetnicVogon,4,Thu Jul 9 11:39:26 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree, the remake was extremely solid and is in no way ""far inferior"" to the PS1 version. The game is in no way broken.  I found a fairly unbiased review with an in-depth comparison of both, although OP should not read it, it's filled with spoilers:  http://www.metalgearinformer.com/?p=160  the conclusion is spoiler-free:   Having played both versions I still think The Twin Snakes is a good remake. Itâs not meant to replace the original but as an additional game, and very welcome for those who missed the original. The director, Kitamura, initially wanted to make the cutscenes very similar to the original, but Kojima himself said the he should put his own style into them. So this is how The Twin Snakes should be seen, not as a replacement of the original, but an addition, a retelling of the story. However, aside from a few differences itâs actually still a very faithful remake. Some things are better in the original, other things are better in the remake. The important thing to realize is that there doesnât have to be a âwinnerâ here, they are both great games that can introduce people to the series."
patientgamers,3cmv4q,KyuubiReddit,2,Thu Jul 9 11:52:03 2015 UTC,I've played through both of them multiple times and I stand by my opinion. Didn't you say in an earlier reply that you didn't even play the PS1 version? You should give it a go.
patientgamers,3cmv4q,ProstetnicVogon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:00:54 2015 UTC,"I did try it a long time ago but didn't go far, that's why I said I didn't play it.   I don't care about graphics at all if the game(play) is good, with one big exception: the full 3D from the Saturn/PS1 era. I just can't stand it and find it horrendous.  I had a blast playing it on Gamecube and the major complaints about cutscenes and music were nonexistent for me.  Nothing felt off to me since I never finished it on PS1. Sure, some cut-scenes were over the top but I didn't mind.   I have the HD Collection on PS3 though, so I could give it a try, it's been a while since I played the GC version anyway, and perhaps I can get over the PS1 graphics this time.  I've been wanting to replay all the games before the release of MGS V."
patientgamers,3cmv4q,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:16:20 2015 UTC,"I understand, that era of gaming was pretty nasty graphics-wise. I do think TTS loses a lot of the originals charm and atmosphere which are among my favorite things about the game.  MGS1 isn't on the HD Collection unfortunately. It is on the Legacy Collection and purchasable separately in the PS Store though."
patientgamers,3cmv4q,ProstetnicVogon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:30:45 2015 UTC,"no, I have it, I have both collections actually :) I just mixed up the names.  it's already installed on my PS3, with the VR missions, but I plan to replay them chronologically (so MGS 3 then Peace Walker then Ground Zeroes, then MGS 1, 2 and 4 if I manage before the release of MGS 5).  I would love it if Sony stops remaking PS3 games that most of us finished recently, and focused on remaking PS1 games. Masterpieces such as Vagrant Story did sadly not age well."

patientgamers,3co5mu,Turbofurball,3,Thu Jul 9 20:18:26 2015 UTC,Im in the same situation. It helps if you go way beyond your comfort zone and try something weird / what evesims my little pony adventure game qho knows.  Old shareware games can be a  treasure trove. Check out extra credits youtube chanel for games you might have not tried and james recommends.  Use google translator / international friend to find some local gems from Brazil eastern europe etc. Many such games might really not need knowlege of the language.  Search out old games like commandore 64 / amiga games and check if they had some obscure sequels.   Check crowd funded games that actually finished and check if they are out yet.   Go to steam and check games under 5 / 10 e from page 5 or so you might find something.   Search google for good games and go to page 6 and find out whats there.   I recomend ADOM if you havent tried it. Ascii based rpg hard and fun detailed

patientgamers,3ckutk,Myrandall,7,Wed Jul 8 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"I asume that you know all  Info about mechanics and stuff, so I'll give my personal feelings of these games. Both of them are great IMO. About Sacred 1: * Played it a lot, like 3 or 4 times for different characters. * Really dig it's interesting story and huge amount of side quests. * Yes, it looks not so great right now, but on that time it was innovative- 3D models on 2D background. And it's still beautiful IMO. * Gameplay is fast and reminds Diablo series. But there are some cool things like smithing your equipment with special jems (not quite remember all stuff perfectly, sorry:)) * I do remember one thing- there is lack in balance while playing for vampire, he's a complete badass. But if you having fun killing your enemies with one-two shots while they're sleeping in a vampiric mist of stun, then you should try him:) * Game world is HUGE. Forests, swamps, deserts, wastelands... villages, cemetries, dungeons. And all is full of NPCs eager to give you new quest, doing which will send you to the other world's end... * Replayability. It has about 6 or 7 chars to play, showing you the main story from different perspective. Resume- I 100% recommend this game.    Secred 2: * Beautiful graphics. Comparing with S1, it got compete 3D, shaders and shit. But, IMO, it lost style and atmosphere of the first game. * Again, interesting quests and lots of fun doing them. * Huge world (not HUGE as in S1, but still really big) * Gameplay, as I recall, didn't change drastically, still fun and good looking. But not a little bit slower maybe. * They added some gods to worship, they'll give you special abilities anf magic. And they added sides- you can choose to be 'bad' or 'good'. * Taking into consideration these gods and 'sides of the force', replayability sweeps off scale. Resume: I like S1 more but S2 is still a very good RPG for sure.    PS Honestly I forgot a lot of things in this games, didn't play them for a long time. Maybe other gamers will enlighten you more:)"

My older sister, on the other hand, would play the other games. Sacred, Titan Quest, Dungeon Siege, and the sort. So I sort of missed out on these and Sacred ended up in my Steam library somehow :P  I did play Torchlight pretty extensively, but only worked halfway through 2. I have a need to get all Steam achievements on the first for some reason, but I get a Matt Uelmen score and Blizzard North's Runic's expertise!"

patientgamers,3ckutk,anarchistica,2,Thu Jul 9 01:55:33 2015 UTC,"I played Sacred 2 a few hours ago and yes, it basically feels like a single-player MMORPG. Especially combat is boring."

patientgamers,3ckutk,the_frickerman,2,Wed Jul 8 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"I played both a Long time ago. If you like Point and click RPG you should go for both, really. They're great.  The first is more RPG based. Is bigger and the world ""evolves"" in the meaning that along side the Story, stuff in the world map Change. That was something I found quite cool back then.  2, I'd say, is more WoW-esque in a lot of ways, from quests to abilities and powers. You Keep the Combo System like in the first game, but now you can choose talents out of a tree that personalizes your powers even further.  The rest has been pretty much said by u/axelbigman. Personally I think I liked better 1, but I enjoyed both a lot.  If you are interested in going deeper into the RPG Point-and-click world, you should consider playing Titan Quest as well, if you haven't done so yet.  EDIT: I forgot to mention something about Sacred 1, there are different Dragons hidden in the world map guarding huge treasures, tracking them down and slaying them was one tha parts of the game that I enjoyed the most. I don't remember Sacred 2 having hidden Dragons anywhere, thoguh."
patientgamers,3ckutk,axelbigman,2,Thu Jul 9 06:49:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, combos! How could I forget about them?=) Also I loved to combine different weapons and change sets depending on situation.

It's still maybe my favourite Point and click RPG, so many hours spent playing in LAN with friends, pure FUN.  The Combos and Equipment swap was as well what I liked most from Sacred. Even when choosing the same class, you could develop almost entirely different characters just by changing the Position of the powers in a combo."

Most games will have a blend, but some are more heavily tilted one way or the other.  Personally I recommend starting with FFIX. Its class and ability learning systems are both pretty simple, and it's a good primer to a lot of things that are the common language of the series. Its story is one of the most character based of the games, which is my preference."

patientgamers,3ck3av,wolfman1911,21,Thu Jul 9 03:55:58 2015 UTC,"Here's some recommendations, depending on what you want in a Final Fantasy:  Final Fantasy VII: Gameplay / story are great, but the graphics have definitely aged. The battle system is probably the most balanced as far as ease of entry and depth. This would be a great introduction to the series, and you would finally figure out why everyone was going nuts over the remake announcement.  Final Fantasy VI: The pixel art for this game has held up much better than FFVII's polygons. The gameplay is good and the story is great, and the music is phenomenal. A lot of people are divided between FFVI and FFVII for the best Final Fantasy.  Final Fantasy V: A lot of people won't recommend this one, but if you are willing to sacrifice story for gameplay (and can still stomach the 16 bit graphics), I would pick this one. It has a job system that allows for heavy customization. This was actually my first Final Fantasy. I would look for the re-releases that have a better translation (GBA and on)  Final Fantasy IX: I actually haven't finished this one yet, but from my perspective this looks like a callback to the style of the classic Final Fantasy games (1, 2, 3), while keeping the good gameplay advancements of the playstation games. I hear this one recommended a lot so I thought I would mention it.  Final Fantasy X: I'm playing through this one right now. With the remaster, this has great graphics, great gameplay, ok story (at least from my experience). The battle system is completely turn based, so that could be a good or bad thing.  Games I would NOT recommend you start with (but are all great games you could play eventually)  Final Fantasy I, II, III: Gameplay has not aged well and is heavily grind based, especially II. You could play these later for the history lesson, or in II's case just skip it altogether. III probably holds up the best of these, especially with the DS release.  Final Fantasy IV: Phenomenal game, but VI exceeds it on almost every level. Start with that one instead of this one, and then return to IV later if you want.  Final Fantasy VIII: They tried out a new gameplay system in this one which is hard to get into and if you don't know what you are doing you could grind for a while. The graphics hold up better than VII and the story is good too. I would still play VII before this one though.  Final Fantasy XII: I actually haven't played this one, but I hardly hear it recommended. 90% sure that VII or VI would be a better choice than this one. But it does have the most real-time battle system of all the games.  Final Fantasy XIII: Has the slowest start of all of the games, and the story kind of goes all over the place. The eye candy though is top-notch. The gameplay is linear and repetitive until you get halfway through the game, where it opens up more."
patientgamers,3ck3av,brainfreeze91,11,Wed Jul 8 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"Ooo, let me help with Final Fantasy XII! I hated the story to this game, until I realized one simple thing: it's not about the ""main"" character. The main character is a street urchin named Vaan who gets caught up in a major conflict between kingdoms. The other people who join your party are the real heroes in the story--just forget about Vaan (and his friend Panello) and focus on the grown-ups, and the story will be a lot cooler. Nothing significant happens to Vaan and Panello. I hear they were actually added simply because the game's ""target demographic"" wouldn't be able to relate to 30-something-year-old heroes."
patientgamers,3ck3av,thisisnotdan,9,Wed Jul 8 18:55:59 2015 UTC,I actually really loved XII. The world was really cool and I loved the gameplay. But yes Vaan was a can of Tidus lite.
patientgamers,3ck3av,Electric_Nachos,6,Wed Jul 8 20:53:05 2015 UTC,Vaan and Panello are the two kids they threw into the story to make it sell better in Japan.
patientgamers,3ck3av,rlbond86,2,Wed Jul 8 20:28:31 2015 UTC,"God, this. If you focus on Vaan and Penelo, you'll be bored to tears with the story - Everything significant that happens is due to politics, espionage, or war - All three of which are completely out of their hands. The two main characters are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, (or maybe the right place at the right time, depending on how you view things,) and get swept up in the action. The only significant thing that directly happens to Vaan is that he finally gets to act out his lifelong dream and become a sky pirate... But even that is only briefly touched on before they move back to the real action.  Also, FF12 is definitely the most open in the series, except perhaps the MMO. Near the beginning of the game, (seriously, it's right after the tutorial,) you get the ability to fast travel via save points - Something that is traditionally reserved for the end-game in the Final Fantasy series. This means that you have the ability to freely wander and explore, straight from the beginning of the game. Don't squander that privilege - If you only follow the story, you'll only see probably 50% of the actual game's map, (provided you can even finish the game... It's nearly impossible to beat some of the bosses without gearing/leveling up first, and the best way to do that is via exploration.) Go hunt for treasure, (making sure to avoid those damned Zodiac Spear chests,) do hunts, (seriously, do hunts. The game introduces them early on, but leaves it up to the player to actually stay on top of them... They offer some of the best stuff in the game, but many players never see any of it because they ignore all the bounty boards,) and don't be afraid to explore."

For some reason, they made the overworld character models these abhorrent 3D renderings of the old 16-bit style. In battles, they look fine (whatever). But it's classic turn-based combat with some decent party customization and an enjoyable storyline.  I have a soft spot for the Shadow Hearts series on PS2 as well. The first one was a low-budget sleeper by a studio created by ex-Square folks. The second (Covenant) improves on it in every way and the third is great as well."

Just wanted to give a shout out to Lost Odyssey though. Iirc the guy who started it up was the main guy or something behind the ff series but left to make that because of them wanting to change the ff battle system. It's a solid turn based rpg with everything in you'd expect from a ff game.  edit because i didnt notice i accidently made a list on my phone :P"
patientgamers,3ck3av,lifesince88,3,Wed Jul 8 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"Pick up FF 4, 5, and 6 for the GBA. Those are probably the definitive versions of three of the best FFs ever. (I'd avoid the DS versions, they made them 3D, and it's really low quality 3D. The pixel art in the GBA versions is timeless.)"
patientgamers,3ck3av,karma_the_llama,3,Wed Jul 8 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"Since nobody else mentioned them, I say you could give the DS final Fantasy games a shot, too. It's been years since I've played them, but ffXII: Revenant Wings was pretty amazing.  It was more of a turn-based RTS though.

patientgamers,3ck3av,detourne,2,Wed Jul 8 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"I love the gameplay of Reverent Wings and Crystal Chronicles, very innovative and much different than the rest of the game. The latter is really only good to play with friends though."

patientgamers,3ck3av,FredWampy,4,Wed Jul 8 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I enjoyed VII. It was the first 3D one, the first (that I can think of) that is set in ""modern"" times. It has the occasional swear word (new to the series), and had some very memorable moments.  But everyone talks of VII's big bad as the worst villain ever. But that person doesn't hold a candle to VI's. It's hard to go into why I think so without spoiling both games.  If you enjoy RPGs, you'd probably enjoy both.     VI VII    Big world x x   Max team size 4 3   Unique character abilities? x x   Hidden characters? x x   Total characters ~14 ~7   On Steam?  x    Let me know if you have any further questions!"

patientgamers,3ck3av,FredWampy,3,Wed Jul 8 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"For FFVI the GBA version is pretty good. If you happen to have a Wii or Wii U, the FFVI SNES version is on the virtual console. I would pick either of those. It might be just me but I would stay away from the mobile ports. The art style and the lack of pixel art make it look uninspired to me. I also am wary of any Playstation 1 versions, after what they did to Chrono Trigger's music (btw, Chrono Trigger is another game you should think about)  The FFVII PC port is fine. They patched in the better PS1 music, so I think now there really aren't that many differences from the original. And I believe they fixed some translation issues, but I haven't played through the whole thing."
patientgamers,3ck3av,dontgetborn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"I'd go original SNES, since that's the only one I've tried.

patientgamers,3ck3av,zjat,2,Wed Jul 8 18:57:49 2015 UTC,The GBA version has a good retranslation though.  The SNES translation was catering to a teenage Nintendo market and toned down some story elements.

In college I had heard people say ""it's overrated, you remember it with rose tinted glasses."" So I replayed it and I still think it's one of the best games. I think the biggest aspect is that 7 has a somewhat roundabout way of making you like/hate various characters at different times generating a more emotional reaction.   However, while many of my friends loved 7 for what it was, it was about a 50/50 split on them loving #8 over 7. I don't know much about 8 though.   Any of the FF series will take many hours, but until you play them, it may be difficult to know which gameplay styles or storylines you prefer within the series."
patientgamers,3ck3av,FredWampy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"X is my second favorite of the series, despite some things I dislike about it.  VIII was one I never finished (got to the final area and, for some reason, never completed it). I remember it being sorta fun, but the story was so convoluted that I just don't have fond memories of it. I'm surprised to hear of a 50/50 split in preference, since people generally prefer VII with a wide margin. But I guess with a small sample size, it's definitely possible."
patientgamers,3ck3av,Knofbath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"A couple other things (due to the length of time since playing the games, some of this may be inaccurate):  VII introduced elaborate summoning animations that are (to my knowledge) unskippable. VII also has an HD remake in the works.  Both games have character customizability in that they can all (more or less) learn pretty much every spell, given enough grinding.  From what I remember, VII has more comic relief than VI. VI is very grim, but VII also has heavy plot points.  Both have a ton of side quests. Both have some ""guide dang it"" moments (you'd never know without reading an online guide). (One that doesn't really spoil anything: if you play VI, there's a certain point in which you're asked ""Jump"" or ""Wait"". Keep spamming ""Wait"". Trust me.)  Both games are ones you could easily sink 30+ hours into. And if you enjoy VI, there's a large chance that you'd also enjoy Chrono Trigger (time travel RPG from a year later). VI and CT are my favorite games ever :-)"
patientgamers,3ck3av,Ivalance,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"VII was amazing as my first game on the PSX, but you can tell they dialed back the scope after disc 1. Xenogears had the same problem. Unfortunately the low polygon counts really look like cancer on modern displays. You'd want to find an old CRT television and play the game as it was originally intended.  IV and VI are some of the finest examples of sprite-based games. They have a look similar to the retro-aesthetic that has been popular in the past few years.   VI also has the best villain."

This bug is fixed in the gba version. http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Evade_Bug  For the gba version there are patches to return the graphics and music to nearly the same as the snes version.

If I had to recommend one, it'd probably be IV or VI as those are my favorites, I think IV is the best, but most people go with VI. I+II is a bit clunky gameplay wise but still fun, and the remakes are great so I'd pick that up at some point, though it may be hard to go backwards, as those were my fist FF game, and V has great gameplay, but not the story that IV and VI have."

Considering how large and complex the world is, we really can't expect the complete removal of bugs. They'll always happen and I personaly never encountered any game breaking bugs.

Maybe introduce some puzzles or strategy or something. But no, drive here, shoot there, mission accomplished. Police AI didn't invite for experimentation. I didn't enjoy the police chases for some reason. Partly because they weren't as ridiculous as they should be, but also because the whole wanted-meter thing was copy-pasted from earlier entries. Can't the game introduce tasers or something, or drunken cops. Just something to renew the formula. Predictable game-world. Sure, it was expansive. But if you know what golf is, and you know what tennis is, and you know what a mountain is, there was little surprising or playful about what the game-world offered. Noisy and slow game disc. Made a lot of noise as it got intensely read by my PS3, loading times were quite slow, if I remember correctly.    I loved the radio, the cultural commentary, the references and the realism."

patientgamers,3cja0p,-MM-,5,Wed Jul 8 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"See, I felt the storytelling was pretty bad in Mass Effect 1. The characters are blander (Paragon Shepherd is a lot more of a children's cartoon show goody goody hero than he is in ME2).  There's almost no conflict between the characters, and everybody's just a little bit too ""nice"". A lot of the dialogue is really inauthentic - instead of learning about the world through your experiences and through your characters' eyes, characters will essentially recite unbiased encyclopedia entries about their culture when you ask, and then dump a bunch of information into your codex. It severely breaks the ""show don't tell"" rule by giving big dumps of text and speech to explain stuff instead of letting you live through it.  Edit: I do understand however, that there is a lot of interesting lore in ME1. I just don't think it's presented well. I guess if you're the type of person who reads every book they find in an Elder Scrolls, then it's probably the game for you."
patientgamers,3cja0p,Astrokiwi,10,Wed Jul 8 10:21:10 2015 UTC,"Despite Kryo's reply, I actually agree with you.  I always retain that you should appreciate a game whilst bearing in mind when it came out. ME1 vs ME2 right now, ME2 is obviously more technically advanced.   But, as a first time experience, before the universe had been expanded, ME1 was absolutely fantastic. I still think it's fantastic, and I still think the story is better than ME2.  Games are developed upon, so yes, the newer one will tend to be 'better' (read: bigger, better graphics, more content etc).  But as an experience, I'd urge OP to play ME1... Or at least play it first!  (don't bother with ME3)"
patientgamers,3cja0p,outline01,22,Wed Jul 8 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"(don't bother with ME3)   Disagree.  ME3 is solid, so if you end ME2 wanting more greatness ... ME3 has more greatness.  ME2 was better, granted, but ME3 is still very, very good.   People whine about the ME3 ending, but it's not that bad, especially with the extended cut ending that they added for free after the release.  Given that the rest of ME had a great story, the (extended cut -- never played it without it) ending was basically ... average, perhaps a little better than average.  Bad by comparison, perhaps, but still average compared to most other AAA list games out there.  Really, the biggest problem I found with the ME3 ending is that it was the ending, and it meant I either had to buy some overpriced DLC or start the trilogy over, or move on to some other game."
patientgamers,3cja0p,dougmc,5,Wed Jul 8 11:31:12 2015 UTC,"I really dislike the ending of ME3 but I still consider it a great game. Up to the ending I enjoyed every second of it, so it really doesn't make sense to claim that one shouldn't bother playing it.  That's just being butthurt."
patientgamers,3cja0p,Zeeker,6,Wed Jul 8 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"I always retain that you should appreciate a game whilst bearing in mind when it came out.   Absolutely. I liken it to paintings or any other form of art. A painting can be beautiful, ugly, well done, or poorly done no matter what, but you are missing out on a lot if you aren't looking at it within the context of when, where, and whom it was painted by. Same with music, films, and all other forms of art.  I also agree that Mass Effect is the best of the trilogy, and while Mass Effect 2 is amazing, I couldn't imagine playing it without having played Mass Effect. The idea of doing that actually makes me upset. Even if it was a better game, would you really watch The Empire Strikes Back before A New Hope? The hell is wrong with you people?"
patientgamers,3cja0p,10GuyIsDrunk,6,Wed Jul 8 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"This guys got it. The first one sets the scene, and the mood for the series. While it is slightly less polished than 2 or 3 its my favourite of the series.  Even the Mako makes he feel nostalgic.  Its also a valuable introduction to some of the most beloved creatures you'll meet; Garrus, Tali, Liara.  Saying goodbye to them when the game was over was quite difficult."
patientgamers,3cja0p,Cin77,2,Wed Jul 8 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"I generally judge games on their main plot points in the end. Saren was by far a more satisfying end, build up and character than fighting the damaged Reaper in 2. The ending of 2 kind of felt like it was out of no-where to me, and the ending, though I beat it, felt a bit cheap.  Mass Effect 1 was a far better crafted story, fleshed out the universe in an appropriate way, introduced you to characters that would affect your story the entire time, and I enjoyed the planet exploration in 1 a bit more, in the sense that I was actually landing on the planet. The planets could have used some variety, sure.  But then you read those damn manuals and books in #1, and they go to great lengths to explain why weapons are unlimited ammo, and then in 2 they introduce clips (magazines) of ammunition and ... bleh.  IMO: 1 is the best, 2 is good, 3 is also good. I can see a case being made for all of them."
patientgamers,3cja0p,blizzardveers,10,Wed Jul 8 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree.   I believe the first one was a good effort, and its entertaining, but it's also the weakest of the franchise in terms of plot, characters and content. Overall it's just pretty forgettable. It was the first game, there was simply no time to set up as much as they did in the other games, and the budget was smaller, that's perfectly understandable, but it's still a flaw.  Mass Effect 2 is by far the best in the franchise simply on terms of scale and content. But on top of that it has the most complete and developed story out of the three games, the most developed characters, and the most interesting choices to make.   I'd say even ME3 is better than 1 if you ignore the convoluted mess that was ME3's last hour."

patientgamers,3cja0p,astrower,5,Wed Jul 8 10:57:31 2015 UTC,"Not trying to change anyone's view, but I had to comment about this after reading it.   The funny thing about that post is it goes on about Cerberus like they were ever really fleshed out in ME1 for the player, how could anyone really form an opinion on Cerberus when you're given very little about them to begin with? Their missions could be completely skipped and missed easily, they were basically ordinary mooks in another ordinary side quest that had you walk into random ""corridor space buildings"" to shoot things. I'd say that the fault with how Cerberus was presented in the games was a flaw in ME1's storytelling, not ME2's just because they decided to shift the focus to them.   I don't see it as a ""reboot"" because there was barely anything to go on when it came to Cerberus, and that's why they were sort of intriguing in ME2, only to be ruined and turned into a joke in part 3."
patientgamers,3cja0p,rooofle,2,Wed Jul 8 11:57:53 2015 UTC,"Throughout the majority of the game you're not playing the idiotic main quest.

patientgamers,3cja0p,pitaenigma,19,Wed Jul 8 19:13:42 2015 UTC,Weakest plot? Are you kidding me? It's got one of the best in all of video games. The first one's plot blows the other two's out of the water.
patientgamers,3cja0p,MayonnaiseOreo,9,Wed Jul 8 21:57:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. ME2's ""plot"" is go get your team. It's focused on characters rather than plot. That's fine and I love it. But ME1 has an amazing plot with quite a bit of world building strewn in. I will always remember having my 14 year old brain blown with the original Mass Effect story."
patientgamers,3cja0p,Hethreck,4,Wed Jul 8 12:53:06 2015 UTC,"From various opinions I've read on the first two Mass Effects, I have gotten the impression that people who like the first game's story better are more into the lore and overall plot, whereas people who like Mass Effect 2 better are more into the characters and their personal story.  I'm obviously generalizing here, but that's the sense I get.  I'm with you in that I think ME2 is the best of the three, but I will also say that in terms of the overall plot, it's probably the weakest.  If you look at what happens in ME2 on the scale of the trilogy as a whole, there really isn't much, and there are very few ""main story"" missions in the game.  It's all about finding your crew and doing their personal missions.  Personally I tend to find those more compelling than traipsing around the galaxy learning about huge conspiracies and alien lore, which is why I like ME2 so much, but if I felt the opposite way, I might prefer the original Mass Effect."

If you played them on release, and in order without spoilers I truly don't see how anyone could disagree.  Unless you were grabbing a bag of chips or something during story moments.  Don't you remember that spoilery part?  The moment?  THAT fucking part?  (Of course you do).  Take the best parts of ME2 and ME3 - and I mean everything (gfx, gameplay, plot, characters etc) - and combine them.  Stack it as high as it goes and it still doesn't even approach that single moment in the first game.  I'll ride the elevators all day long if they give me a game like that again. ALL day long.    Hell I'll take the elevator over the stupid jarring MISSION COMPLETE stat screens at the end of every sequence that ME2 introduced.  Edit: and to put ME3>ME1 is objectively incorrect.  ME3 was such a boring game I was PRAYING for each hour to be the final hour after about 5-6 hours.  The game is literally just offline horde mode with the flashiest cutscenes ever.  The cutscenes were all that kept me going in 3."

patientgamers,3cja0p,DamienStark,2,Wed Jul 8 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"Regarding gameplay, I think it improves with each one.  So my favorite, the one I would most want to re-play, would be the third.  But the thing that's great about these games is the story and the character development.  And you can't really experience that by skipping ahead.  I would definitely say start with the first one.  If you really enjoy it and get hooked, then you'll move on to the second one sometime down the road when you find the budget for it (although honestly you can probably find the trilogy on sale for less than the first game regular retail price)."
patientgamers,3cja0p,FrankReynolds,2,Wed Jul 8 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"1, no doubt.  I love 2 and 3, but 1 has by far the best and most important to the series storytelling and ""RPG-ish"" gameplay."
patientgamers,3cja0p,labbla,2,Wed Jul 8 13:56:08 2015 UTC,I only ever played 2. It was like a really awesome season of a tv show. But I couldn't care less about the larger Reaper story that 3 got into.
patientgamers,3cja0p,Surprentis,2,Wed Jul 8 15:06:37 2015 UTC,I can't see any possible answer for this rather then suck it up and buy all 3 somehow...you just cant do that with this series to really experience it.

It's totally optional to the story, but incredibly deep and complex.  There are about 60 classes to unlock and play, tons of weapons, mods, powers, power ups.  People are usually friendly, and it can be quite challenging too.  I have several hundred hours logged in and still come back for a quick game now and again.  Frankly, it's much better implemented in my opinion than games like Destiny, which were designed primarily as multiplayer games."

The gameplay, item storage and mako can get a little frustrating at times but don't let that scare you cause it's a real gem.  The second game feels like you need to rush to build a team and beat the bad guys. Which isn't a bad thing, I played that game in two sittings.

IMO, ME1 has the best story, while ME3 has the best gameplay. ME2 had a solid balance of both, which is why it's often cited as a favorite.   Don't forget, the games will make less sense if you haven't played the games before. Also, IMPORT your previous games when you start a new one. Continuity is a hallmark of Mass Effect games. The lack of it in the ME3 ending is what made people hate it, I think  And DON'T listen to anything you hear about the ME3 ending. Play it for yourself and decide. I personally didn't mind it, even if it felt a little Nolan-esque."

The first game has a really strong story and builds up the next two games. It wouldn't be the same to play them out of order.  Also, the first game has the arguably best quote ever in a video game:   âWe impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it.â   So chilling."
patientgamers,3cja0p,black_sky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:52:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I debated getting the first two in a pack, but ended up not doing it because of time restrictions. I may have to pick it up. I hear the first one was better story, but the combat was improved with the second one."
patientgamers,3cja0p,donwallo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"That line doesn't make any sense though. First of all evolution is supposed to have a de facto ordering principle, survival of the fittest, and one observes natural hierarchies or ""pecking orders"" throughout nature.  But more to the point, why are they imposing ""order""? What makes chaos bad?  These ""philosophical"" villain speeches never make any sense."
patientgamers,3cja0p,the_omega99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:50:43 2015 UTC,"Although evolution itself is still chaotic in the sense that the mutations are random. Synthetics, on the other hand, have full control over their advancement. There's also nothing stopping evolution from favouring traits that could be considered negative (since a trait being best for reproduction doesn't actually mean the trait is a good thing).  Although it's the second part of the quote that makes it scary. It's not about the Reapers imposing order, but rather about how powerful the Reapers are. They could wipe out all life if they wanted to, but they choose to leave younger species alive and only target advanced species. And up until the events of ME3, the Reapers have been unstoppable, so they certainly can demand life to end.  But yeah, the Reaper's motivations are cryptic and seem poorly written on the long term. Bioware really missed out on giving the Reapers some better motivations. I've seen some better written fan theories. All we really have to make things better is the idea that mere humans could never understand the motivations of a billion year old species (ie, we have to go with the idea that the Reapers' motivations are beyond our understanding, which is why they sound like nonsense)."

I played this demon woman and combat with her was really good. I even purchased the DLC, but I somehow messed up gear that I got and since, as I remember, the DLC was set after the final boss, I would have to defeat him again to be able to continue.

DS3 is more of an isometric dungeon crawler and to be honest it's pretty well done.  It gets a lot of hate because it is not done in the same way as the prequels, and gets lumped in with all of the other Diablo clones.

That said, here's some of my quibbles:   I didn't like some of the multiplayer design choices. Specifically the part about how characters are saved on the host's machine. Anybody who joins a host's game is limited to items and level-up choices based on the available characters saved on the host/ I found some of the character design to be questionable. My biggest peeve was with the design behind Anjali. All the characters can swap between two different stances, which alter their gameplay. In the case of Anjali, it's a swap between a melee form and a ranged form. Except that the ranged form's abilities have very little to do with range other than her basic attack.   That said, it's a nicely made (if mindless) hack and slash rpg, with nice mechanics. I particularly enjoyed how every character can do a sudden dodge/dash, allowing you to quickly get out of a dangerous area. It helps make you feel more nimble. By comparison, Diablo III characters felt more slow and clunky."

patientgamers,3cjupy,mike413,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:26:29 2015 UTC,It's a Single-Player story driven vs of Dungeon Siege. I had fun enough with my 2 playthroughts. Fire and Guns.  It isn't supposed to be an endless farming thing as far as I can tell. Didn't check for NG+.  If you want something like that then it's fine. Also the games for Van Helsing do a decent job of that.  It isn't Diablo or Dungeon Siege of old.

patientgamers,3cgyeb,HappyBull,31,Tue Jul 7 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"Hah.  No, Destiny offers none of that, save for one post-game section (the Vault of Glass, which is fantastic, and the weapons and gear finally keep up with new content thanks to the ascend system they just added).  The gameplay is really fun, but they characters presented in-game don't have much going for em, old content is completely ignored after new content is released, and most legendary gear is pretty similar.  Don't even bother buying it for the multiplayer, because it's nowhere near competitive and there aren't many game modes.   Now, with all that taken into account, the game is crazy fun with a full fireteam, so if you have friends who play or a Bungie clan you can join, it's a game you'll sink dozens of hours into, if not more.  In my opinion, if you want to get into it, wait til The Taken King is released, it'll be way cheaper to get caught up."
patientgamers,3cgyeb,Captain_Kuhl,22,Wed Jul 8 01:49:48 2015 UTC,I never ever comment but i feel compelled to say. The story is awful. God awful. They could have done sooo much cool stuff but instead they tell you jack shit. Like nothing. It literally feels like they ripped out the entire story to sell to you as dlc. It made the game unplayable. That and every mission is essentially the same and the grinding for gear just isnt worth the time.
patientgamers,3cgyeb,Gmoney613,3,Wed Jul 8 02:12:49 2015 UTC,"I've read that something happened with the original writing staff - the talented staff who has written sharp dialogue and involving stories for Bungie in the past. I think they were fired, and so the story and dialogue suffered dramatically.   It certainly explains why they're so vague with the story, even in the expansions and grimore. It's just another example of how Bungie dropped the ball with this game.  ""Wake up Guardian, it's time to shoot stuff and get guns and armor from it. No more questions."""

patientgamers,3cgyeb,qft,33,Wed Jul 8 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"Perspective here from someone who has played it a lot, and doesn't particularly care for it (I play it because my friends play it):  To answer your questions directly (you won't be happy about this), its platform is a bit innovative, but that doesn't help the current content much. If you think Halo combat in a quasi-MMO setting is innovative, it does have that. The combat grind is WORSE in Destiny than Halo. It has zero story. The characters are empty shells of what the original writers likely intended, and worse, they're irritating characters. No love interests. It has some light puzzle solving in the few high-level raids, but it's mostly figuring out how to deal with the enemies they throw at you. There are some boss fights that take strategy.   More in depth:  It's polished and beautiful. The controls feel intuitive, the guns are great. The FPS combat is very good, and it's fun to play with two buddies with a similar level of experience (or 5 buddies for a couple of raids that allow it). It feels a lot like Halo (single and multiplayer), so if you enjoyed that you'll have fun. At least for a while.  But there's a really damning lack of story, poor dialogue, and a complete lack of new things to do after you've spent ~30 hours leveling up a character and trying out the various missions/challenges. Every MMO is a grind, but this literally turns into ""Let's play the same levels over and over, so we can get better guns, so we can play the same levels over and over."" If you identify something you want, you do the same thing over and over until you get it. The Random Number Generator (RNG) for rewards will really fuck you over a lot, too, making you feel like you just wasted a lot of time.  Also I gotta say, being restricted to playing with two buddies for the majority of the game is a bummer. If you have 3 buddies, one will be left out, unless you are playing one of two 6-player raids... and if you don't have exactly 6 people, you have to find more manually (and hope they are good and have mics), because matchmaking doesn't exist for raids.  It's also difficult being an adult with this game... it's not good for sitting down for 30 minutes and just having fun. Loading everything takes forever, big raids and missions can take hours with multiple tries, especially if you're not on mic with experienced friends, and the game generally makes you put in a lot of time to get good rewards. Then, there's stuff you can only do on certain days - Xur sells random exotic gear on Fridays and Saturdays. Not able to turn on your Xbox those days? Hope you don't need what he's selling - you're SOL. There's weekend-only events, etc. It's nice that they keep things fresh but it's on a schedule that might not match yours.  I'm not much for the PvP myself so I'm sure that hurts my opinion of the game. If you enjoy the multiplayer it'll definitely add replay value, though right now it's buggy due to lag and MAJOR weapon imbalance issues (there's a gun that is far superior, that you can only get through a certain rare quest... but it'll kill you dead very quickly, and lots of people have it)  Basically it feels like a good idea in an empty platform. Bungie had some kind of major issue with all of the writers during development, so the plot went out the window, and there's just not a ton of content right now. The game is all polish and not enough beef. And what's there is super grind-y. It makes me ask ""why am I playing this?"" fairly often. It's just not as fun as it should be.  Also, if you want to play it, wait for the Taken King expansion in two months - there will be a (edit: $60) version for newcomers that will include everything (and you need all of the expansions to play all of the ""important stuff"" each week)  TL;DR - 6/10. Great guns, controls and combat, but zero story, not enough beef, too grind-y and imbalanced, and wait for the Taken King expansion if you want a good value."

In fact, when my internet is working it's perfect. So the lag i'd disagree with.  As for the guns, I'm pretty sure you're talking about either Thorn or The Last Word, both of which have become amazing in the most recent balance patch but i still kick ass and take names with my scout rifle. You can succeed with whatever gun you prefer.   The raids are the best things in the game but because the game has been out so long, they have been distilled down so much that unless you know what to do before you start then you're going to have a bad time as people will expect you to have at least read a basic guide and be moderately competent.  If you like he combat of Halo, the grinding bosses for loot from Borderlands/Diablo/other similar games, then pick it up. If you can't dedicated at least 10-`5 hours per week then you won't get the most out of this game and i'd look elsewhere for my fun."

patientgamers,3cgyeb,LegionSB,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:48:11 2015 UTC,"The Taken King will be the largest expansion yet. It'll add new abilities to characters, new weapons and armor and new levels and a new raid (which will be the third raid in the game). Standalone it's $40, but there's a $60 version which includes all previous DLC plus the base game, and can be preordered here.  At $60 for everything, it's a steal. At $40 for just the expansion, people are questioning its value, though Bungie is sticking to its guns, saying they're comfortable with the value it will provide.   The base game had about 8 hours of original playthrough content, expansion 1 was generally viewed as a failure, expansion 2 was generally viewed as good but most players were finished with everything to do with the new content in a couple weeks. Those expansions were cheaper, and so everyone is questioning the value of TTK. However, the weekly refreshed content will likely often require that expansion to play.  However, if you're new to Destiny, it's actually a lot of content for $60."

I'm sad reminiscing about it because I want to like it so badly. I did enjoy the crap out of the first raid when it came out and back before they patched the loot cave I had a lot of fun socializing around that hole.   Honestly, it's too empty a game.

patientgamers,3cgyeb,THEsolid85,3,Wed Jul 8 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"Some of the best gunplay (control wise, and feel wise) I have ever seen in my 25 years + of gaming. One of the worst stories and worlds I have ever played in. The writing is nothing short of lazy and all the interesting lore is buried ouside of the game. Match making is awful, so bad that a number of non affiliated sites (the100 for example) were created just to try and fix that issue. End game content is completely unfufilling.   That being said, I have over 700 hours played (probably closer to 1000). However this is mainly do to a lack of alternitives and friends on the system (ps4). we all collectively dropped it about 2 weeks ago and are done. If you are ionterested then I would wait for the taken king to drop in the fall as it will have all the dlc up to that point and the game for 60 dollars (compared to it costing 140 so far for day 1 players).   Unless yo have friends playing I would not recommend it.   Oh, there are no real puzzles or anything interesting. YOu basicly just brute force everything."
patientgamers,3cgyeb,SpaghettiFingers,2,Wed Jul 8 04:01:44 2015 UTC,"No, no, no, no.  The mechanics are great. That's the only good thing about the game. It starts off promising but then quickly kicks you in the balls with disappointment.  You can finish the main story (which is awful, vague, and underdeveloped) in about 4-5 hours. From there, it's a tedious, repetitive grind to level up. And why do you want to level up? So the tedious, repetitive grind isn't as difficult, and so you have an even more unfair advantage over other players in the PVP, which is a horrible, unbalanced abomination.   Repeat: do NOT buy this game for the PVP. It's fucking garbage.  Buy the game for the mechanics. That's all it gets right in the end. It has ZERO replay value. The game is such a miserable grind that I can't even fucking imagine maxing out a character and then starting over."
patientgamers,3cgyeb,SFWSock,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:15:12 2015 UTC,"Just curious as to why you hate PVP so much. It can be frustrating and a bit laggy at times but no worse than any other multiplayer FPS, IMO"
patientgamers,3cgyeb,NekoiNemo,2,Wed Jul 8 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"What's good about it? It's an unbalanced cluster-fuck. It has no skill-based matchmaking. It has no skill gap either because success or failure is entirely dependent on who's the highest level, because that's how you get better guns and armor. Why should I go in as a level 5 and stand no chance against a level 10? All that does is force people to grind on their boring, repetitive game to level up. It's not a ranking system, it's a progression system, and impacting PVP on such a fundamental level is just stupid. Bungie abandoned the ranking systems they did so well and replaced them with this awful progression system that does nothing but diminish the skill gap. No even starts, no weapon pickups, everyone spawns with power weapons. Map control doesn't matter. There's no map flow. The maps are bad. Team spacing doesn't matter. The pace is frantic at all times. It's awful."
patientgamers,3cgyeb,CitizenDK,2,Wed Jul 8 15:16:14 2015 UTC,"The major gripe I had was the rewards are randomized, so you can be top of the room and get nothing while Lazy Larry who spent the entire match running in circles with his gun up his butt gets a Legendary weapon. I didn't feel like it was totally unbalanced with the level difference, though obviously someone running around with the Mythoclast is going to do better than someone with a white weapon. Still, I felt there was some skill involved and if you're good at it, you usually tear it up. Also being in a fireteam with friends helps since you can coordinate better."

This game reminds me of a plastic surgeon'd model: Great to look at from a distance, but scrutinise too closely and you'll notice the cracks in the faÃ§ade. Spend longer with them and you'll soon realise they have no interesting things to say and appear to have no soul. Spend a long time with them and you'll learn that while pretty, they are simply an empty husk and that you find yourself hating them.  No, don't get it."

patientgamers,3cgyeb,DGMimic,2,Wed Jul 8 04:01:40 2015 UTC,"Destiny has some of the smoothest gameplay I've ever come across in any FPS. PvP is kind of a mess at the moment, but Bungie does notice these things and have been fairly good about providing patches for some imbalances.   The raid, Vault of Glass, is a very clever place. Solid team work is required, even when everyone is over the level cap.   The story is lackluster. You won't find moments like Master Chief requesting to leave the ship and return the Covenant's bomb.   That being said, Destiny is a grind, like any MMO, but still a great piece of work. If you are going to jump in, wait until September 15th when the Taken King comes out - you can buy Destiny+All the expansions for the same price of the base game when it first came out.   I love it, personally. The grind for leveling up guns, reputation, and characters is pretty daunting at first, but the community behind the game is, generally, pretty awesome. You'll never be without a guide somewhere.   If you really think you want to give it a whirl, stop by r/destinythegame and check out the community there, or even repost your inquiry."

There are other games that can last you a long time on your 3DS as well, depending on what genres you enjoy.

The Monster Hunter series is amazing but not for everyone. It's not an action game, it's a hunting game. Most of your time is spent preparing, planning, and trying not to die. If you button mash you die. The game has a large learning curve and can be grindy, but IMO a very large pay off.  My favorite part is that your character does not get better. There is no leveling up, stats are directly related to your armor. Without armor you may die in 5 hits, with armor 4. The game pushishes you for not getting better. Did you die to a monster? It wasn't because your armor or weapon sucked, or you weren't a high enough level as in other games, it was because YOU sucked. The major progression in the game is your own skill at it.  If you want an easy action game with comfortable controls, this is not for you. If you want a challenging game that requires time and patience to fight monsters 10x your size, then gear up hunter.  I'd be very happy to answer any more specific questions about the game or series, they are literally my favorite games. I bought my N3DS JUST for MH4U."

Also be sure it's MH3U and not MH3(Tri, for the Wii) because they closed the multiplayer servers.   The controls may be a little weird at first (especially controling the camera) but you get used to them. Aside from that, it's a great game.

The game is extremely text heavy for explanations when it could fairly easily have a real tutorial. Having, say, one hour to hunt one monster is a cool mechanic on the surface, but the way the levelling and weapons are implemented the game is less about skill and interesting tactics and more about gathering enough items until you can get the better things. There are moments such as the large monster battles where I could see less well versed gamers going ""Whoa! This is cool!"" but those fights, or at least the couple I've seen, are heavily scripted, meaning you can easily see a pattern and walk left, walk right, attack, repeat. I'm all for pattern based attacks in bosses, but these just drag out. If you're the kind of person who likes World of Warcraft, then you might like Monster Hunter, but otherwise I think it's better avoided."

patientgamers,3ceo4a,SpirallingOut,17,Tue Jul 7 22:36:33 2015 UTC,"Football Manager is a hugely successful and appreciated franchise in Europe and, beyond that, it's probably the best sports management simulator period. There have been other attempts, either as features in sports games or whole titles, like NFL Head Coach, but nothing I've played touches the level of polish. I'm not even a soccer fan and I got pretty into it for a while.   I don't know if I'd put it on my 100 best games of all time, personally, but if I were to really think about it, I don't see any good reason to exclude it when I would definitely have Crusader Kings 2 on that list."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,onemanandhishat,5,Tue Jul 7 23:27:02 2015 UTC,It's definitely hugely appreciated by a mate of mine.

Medieval 2 is very similar but not quite as good, and the newer ones from then on switched engines and the feel of battles changed dramatically, not for the betterin my opinion. Rome 2 is pretty bad, at least by comparison.  And if you mod Rome with Roma surrectum, it looks great as well."

I love Med2 and R1 but I know full well that R1 hasn't aged well graphically. Med2 still looks presentable. Both had irritations like any game such as the AI's love of random blockades or the poor city map layouts. And I do like Shogun 2, except for one thing...  ...a major reason why I adore R1 and Med2 is because of the large menu of well-done mods. Something modern TW titles don't have as much of.   But if Shogun 2's mod list looks like Med2,  then that will really boost my view of it."

patientgamers,3ceo4a,HerpthouaDerp,3,Tue Jul 7 15:54:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, I always find that an odd stipulation, because it immediately devalues the list as a definitive record of the platform, and skews it towards the new."

patientgamers,3ceo4a,FolkSong,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"Well, each to their own. You can find lists of ""What should I play today?"" all over the internet - I'm sure there are a bunch on reddit. And actually I'd bet that I prefer some of the lists on Reddit to the PC gamer efforts. If we're talking about a major publication's list, I think it's a lazy cop-out to do such a list, especially if it's at the expense of a more authoritative list. Edge did a 'games to play today' list similarly a while back and it was similarly flawed (and short-lived I believe). All it actually tells you is what sort of game the contributors that made it like (Edge writers like driving games, PC Gamer writers love shooters) - we might as well just measure sales or review scores for a similar (and maybe more accurate) effect.  Coming up with a list that genuinely strives for a quality that respects the history of the medium, and has an eye for more high-minded criteria, is much much more difficult, but imo much more valuable as a result."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,Alex__V,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:13:11 2015 UTC,Valuable to who?
patientgamers,3ceo4a,SecondTalon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:44:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose simply anyone interested in what the best games might be, rather than what PC Gamer thinks we should play right now.  Would we ask the worth of a cinema canon? It's the difference between finding out what the best films might be, rather than what is most watched on Netflix.  I mean, if we're not interested in what the best games are, why ever look at lists at all?"
patientgamers,3ceo4a,Alex__V,3,Tue Jul 7 20:15:36 2015 UTC,"It comes down to your meaning of ""best"". To continue your cinema analogy, if you are interested in the history of film you should definitely watch Citizen Kane. It's been said that this movie invented the language of modern cinema. However, if you want to sit down and enjoy a film then Kane is not a good choice. The medium has advanced so far since the '40s that Citizen Kane feels slow and boring to a modern viewer."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,lordxi,0,Tue Jul 7 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"Well I think that's a certain interpretation. I honestly think Citizen Kane is at the top of many critics lists because they think it's one of the best films ever made, not that it should be ignored by anyone because of it's pacing. I also completely disagree that the medium of cinema has advanced since the 40s - that's highly debatable. Many fans of cinema hold a lot of films from the silent era as masterpieces.  I'm just not sure of this attitude of ""you might not like this game/movie/book because it's dated"" - is that really anything more than a bad attitude?   I think there's a slightly irrational belief that 'games have got better' but is it really based on anything objective? You can't even definitely say that games 'look better' than they used to, because it depends if you like semi-realistic high fidelity polygons over surreal or abstract old-school graphics. I still think Tempest and PacMan are two of the best-looking best-playing super-playable games ever made and they launched in 1980. Not only that but they have major significance for those who are into their history.  I also think Chess, Backgammon and Poker are ancient in terms of culture but would we really knock them off the playlist? Games have not got better imo, I think that's an absurd fallacy, and its on that basis that I think I reject PC Gamer's approach - their list is simply not a good guide of what to play. It's only a good guide to what they liked in 2005."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,Alex__V,2,Tue Jul 7 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"It's a lot like movies and music, though.  It's not who did a technique first, it's who did it well.  That Director X was the first to use a certain shooting technique or Band X was the first to blend Bluegrass and EDM doesn't particularly matter if Director Y mastered the shot, and Band X did BEDM way, way better.  It's the Best 100 Games, not Most Influential 100 Games.  There's a huge difference between the two.  I can think of a ton of influential games that should be nowhere near a Best list, and several Best games that didn't influence anything.  Well, anything notable."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,Alex__V,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"It's not easy to come up with a best-of list in any medium for similar reasons. There is politics and horse-trading to be had whatever the criteria. I totally accept that. How do you rate something highly unoriginal and artistically pointless that is actually fun to play? It's the same issue in any medium. It's really one of the most difficult tasks of criticism - how to make a case for the worth of a cultural thing.  At the same time, is there something wrong with appreciating games that are influential? Why is that any worse a reason than any other for liking a game? Things that are influential tend to be more interesting than things that aren't, so there is definitely some crossover."

patientgamers,3ceo4a,Anzai,4,Tue Jul 7 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'm here to recommend people try Brothers in Arms, Hidden & Dangerous, and SWAT 4 if you haven't yet.  BiA is like Band of Brothers in video game form. Unlike the old Call of Duty there's no running and gunning, they did a pretty good job at making single player squad based fighting. It's a lot of flanking and suppressing but the story is great and even though the graphics have aged, it still looks lovely IMO. I bought the three game bundle on Steam for $5 a couple years ago.  I've only played Hidden & Dangerous 2 but if the first made this list then I can definitely recommend that and SWAT 4. They're tactical shooters and they really don't make games like that anymore (Let's hope the new Rainbow Six revives it). In H&D you play as a British SAS team in WW2 which is a nice change from the U.S. The levels are pretty large and take place in a variety of locations. SWAT 4 is as it sounds, you play as a SWAT team and respond to different situations in close quartered levels. It's very fun and replayable. SWAT 3 is also good except it looks more like the first Rainbow Six since you can't see your arms or weapon. Every game I mentioned in this paragraph except H&D1 I was able to buy a new physical copy of for under or around $10 each."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,Sco7689,7,Tue Jul 7 23:34:40 2015 UTC,Thief 3 being the highest ranked Thief game is very peculiar.
patientgamers,3ceo4a,Anzai,3,Tue Jul 7 17:24:42 2015 UTC,I too thought that this list includes only one game from a series. Than I saw Doom II and Doom 3; then I saw Deus Ex: IW and got completely confused.

patientgamers,3ceo4a,acelister,3,Tue Jul 7 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough I guess, but I've never really done side quests for the leveling or xp. I do them because I'm interested in what happens. And if I'm not, I don't do them at all. THe potential rewards of something being a motivator often leads to gaming a mechanic to maximize your reward rather than role playing a character."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,MrPing1000,2,Tue Jul 7 19:46:17 2015 UTC,"I also do side quests to see what's going on. I don't care if it gives me XP, money or nothing at all, so long as there's some story happening. Someone wrote it, I want to experience it.  I've just realised I'm like that with TV and movies, too... I hate reality shows and game shows as they're unscripted - but I will continue to watch any show I enjoyed the first few episodes of, no matter how terrible it becomes...

patientgamers,3ceo4a,1n5aN1aC,2,Tue Jul 7 13:35:50 2015 UTC,"One. It's far better. The landscapes are actually real planets and moons and look nicer, but moreto the point the strategy is better. 2 dumped scavengers roaming around in favour of scrap pools. That meant you could take over a location and fortify it rather than having to defend your roaming scavengers, and being able to cut enemy supply lines by taking out theirs.  They also made it so once deployed, your recycler was fixed. You picked a base spot and that was it, too bad if you changed your mind. It was great to be able to fall back with the recycler whilst your fixed guns delayed the enemy if you could see you were to be overrun. Then you could secretly rebuild before they knew what was happening.  And the graphics of base building went from cool models that unfolded and looked like actually machines, to magic wireframe things that just popped into existence out of nowhere.  Oh, and the story limited you all the way through, not giving you actual command for ages and forcing you to do exactly as you were told for many missions at the sort, which is idiotic in a strategy game because it didn't give you any chance for strategizing.  Umm, yeah sorry. Battlezone 2 was one of the biggest disappointments in gaming for me at the time..."

By the late 90's early 2000's I had lost interest in gaming since I felt that '3d' was a step backward (primitive polygons, low res texturing etc).   It wasn't until this era (2005 onwards) that I started to gain interest again.   Still though, ""best games of all time"" is so subjective. I notice 4 Lucasarts adventure games in there but zero other adventures. What about Sierra games? Or MYST? And if they're going to put games like Tempest 2000 (a Jaguar game) then why not Another World and Flashback(Amiga) or Prince of Persia(Apple).

patientgamers,3ceo4a,jimmybrite,4,Wed Jul 8 01:21:14 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't get the Half Life 2 hype, I remember playing it and not really liking it"
patientgamers,3ceo4a,blizzardveers,21,Tue Jul 7 14:21:33 2015 UTC,"compared to the games at the time nothing really came close as far as narrative, or the way that the story was integrated into gameplay. Characterization on the level that HL2 had is still rare in gaming.   Couple that with physics, gunplay, and level design that rival most FPS on the market today, and its pretty reasonable to see why HL2 was on the top of most lists (and I'd say it still deserves to be there)."
patientgamers,3ceo4a,Brillegeit,3,Tue Jul 7 15:59:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're wrong, but I disagree. I never understood the hype and I'm someone who had played HL1 and had thousands of hours in HL1 mods (and again thousands of hours in source mods).   HL2 was a physics demo with an okay plot. The gravity gun was extremely fun, at the time. Now it's just gimmicky if you replay the game and the puzzle sections feel forced. The way the story was told ""naturally"" around you was very nice but while at HL1 launch it could almost be considered revolutionary by the time HL2 came out a lot of games did the same thing. The characters themselves were totally forgettable. Gordon Freeman was really nothing but just another silent protagonist hailed as a god in the sequel by the other characters. I don't understand why people on the internet circlejerk around him either. He doesn't say anything, he doesn't do anything that other single player FPS characters wouldn't do, there's no character arc for him. He's just a mute player model who completes missions without ever questioning his place in the story. In HL1 being just another scientist from the lab forced to fight aliens was an interesting twist (though even this you had to remind yourself of since he is a silent protagonist so it wouldn't make a difference if he was SUPER ELITE COMMANDO) but in HL2 he's lost the only thing that made him kinda unique since he's inserted into the story just like any other action hero in the start of a sequel.  Other characters? There was alex who I best remember for nude mods (which I totally didn't download myself krhm) and her dad and they liked to argue I guess? That was their thing, right? And they had a robot sidekick? Totally forgettable.  Gameplay wise the level design was pretty straight forward with little alternative routes. Only freedom came from the (ab)use of the gravity gun and even then it felt like the devs had planned for you to use it. Like I said the gravity gun was extremely fun at a time when realistic physics were a new thing so most players just used that all the time but if you actually tried the ""conventional weapons"" the gunplay was very boring and basic with virtually no recoil or other challenging factors. Just point and hold mouse1 until enemies are dead or you find a saw blade to launch with your gravity gun. Enemies were recycled throughout the entire game though I admit some of the more rare enemies very nicely designed. The world design visually was excellent too.  HL1 (and mods) would be in my top5 games of all time. HL2 wouldn't even make my top 100. If you include other source games that arguably wouldn't exist without HL2 (TF2, CSGO, L4D, Portal even Dota 2) then HL2 definitely makes top100 but I paid separate for all of those games (except dota which is f2p)."

I've tried to play through Half-Life 2 maybe three times now, and each time I ended up losing interest partway through. The furthest I've ever gotten was into Ravenholm, which didn't seem very interesting to me.

Unreal Tournament 99 still just exists on private servers. If Epic started a UT99Live instead of working on the new UT, I'd probably be playing that instead (not over the new UT when they announced it.)  Unreal Tournament was incredibly polished, was hectic, customizable and just a hell of a lot of fun. I played Q3Arena at first, and UT converted me with all the features it had to offer, including, in my opinion, better gameplay and balance.  But, we're gonna have to agree to disagree on how they look, as I think Unreal Tournament is better looking than Q3Arena was when graphics were cranked."

The year after the reboot came out I picked it up at a Steam Sale. I was recently trying to beat it but lost my save data. I haven't reinstalled yet because I'm in a ""gaming slump"" where I'm just not interested in playing games.  I say it's my favorite series because I like all the things about the games. The combat is nice, the games are fun and I like the art style and premise of the games. I also enjoy the soundtracks in all the games. I should clarify that it's my favorite series for that genre. Like Battlefield is for FPS and Final Fantasy for RPG."
patientgamers,3cfqih,krp5150,3,Tue Jul 7 20:30:34 2015 UTC,$10 is worth it for 3 alone. As others have mentioned it's the best entry in the series (with 4 being a close second IMO).  The combat is fast paced and difficult. You'll probably only start to get decent at it after a lot of deaths. But once you start to get past the surface there is quite a bit of depth to be explored and it can be quite satisfying slaughtering countless demonic hordes.
patientgamers,3cfqih,Schrodingers_Cthulu,5,Tue Jul 7 20:52:22 2015 UTC,I actually consider 4 to be amazing. The combat is amazing once you understand the combos a little bit. You need to play through it a couple of times but it's a great game IMO.

patientgamers,3cfqih,Lacriphage,2,Tue Jul 7 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"Bayonetta and Darksiders are newer and better games in the genre. I suggest you try those first.

They were great at their time, but now they are just games with good combat and wacky story."
patientgamers,3cfqih,wave32,2,Tue Jul 7 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"I very recently played 1 HD and close to finishing 3 HD.   The first one has a very classically gothic setting. The third game isn't really 'gothic' but more like if you took the gothic mood and applied it to dystopian sci-fi fantasy or something.  My main impression of the Collection is that HD Graphics fit these games extremely well.   Gameplay-wise they are fast and feel seamless and polished. I enjoy that the menus etc are so fast and it just jumps right into the tightly action-packed campaign.  I played Bayonetta too, but would prefer the HD Collection gameplay-wise. One reason to play Bayonetta instead is the more epic scale, more detailed Graphics, and more ideas thrown on top of the DMC formula.   But the HD Collection plays more smoothly.  Also, the boss fights in DMC3 are varied and have some puzzle elements. It reminded me of Demon's Souls. Bayonetta had more impressive boss fights visually but they were more standard by design.  Pro-tip: People recommend you skip DMC2 because it's widely regarded as a dud. Just play the first one and skip to 3. Then either play 4 or forget about the series for a while. Then only play 2 if.. I don't know..  Gothic action games by order of recommendation: DMC3, DMC1, Demon's Souls, Bayonetta"

patientgamers,3cdur4,szthesquid,10,Tue Jul 7 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"Played through this for the first time a little over a week ago. The atmosphere and tension is incredible... well, mostly. It's pretty thrilling to hear the alien jump down from a vent behind you while you're sneaking around, but less because you're scared and more because you don't want to have to replay the last 10 minutes for the third+ time. And there definitely are some ""cheap deaths."" So this, plus figuring out the alien's movement patterns, and seeing him often, and knowing that you have to hide before and after everything you do, and ultimately relying on the luck of his appearance over strategy, was a disappointing way to break the immersion and make you feel like you're just exercising the mechanics of a game. (On a similar note, it was frustrating to have no point of reference whether or not other AI enemies will spot you and open fire from 50 yards away or simply not notice that you're ducking behind a crate a few feet from their face.)  Every single chapter of the plot could be summarized as ""shit's broke, go fix it,"" a similar moving-goalpost problem found in Dead Space. The last half-dozen chapters are just set piece after set piece after set piece. But, a strong story shouldn't really be expected. The faithfulness to the 1979 film is what this experience is all about. Definitely recommend revisiting the film right after playing the game to see exactly how amazing the reproduction was (everything from storage bins to hydraulic doors to science labs to keycards.)   The sale price point of 12 bucks felt well-spent especially for the length and amount of content, even considering the parts that dragged. However, I would NOT recommend this game for anyone who is not into stealth games and/or a fan of the Alien (film) franchise already. I only fall into the latter so that could be why I had such a hard time with it."

Decided to play on hard mode because I wanted to make sure that the Alien was a real, present danger so I could get the full horror experience. Kind of thinking about taking the difficulty down because of this. I love how deliberate your pace must be when the Alien is around, but I haven't been through a section yet that I didn't have to replay a few times. What this has had the unfortunate side effect of is that the Alien, instead of feeling like a real, scary danger, feels like a needling, ever-present annoyance. Especially when I have limited playtime and wanted to finish a mission before I quit.   Perhaps I will tick the difficulty down and just enjoy the story/game, but I'm about mid-way through it and I kind of feel as though I've gotten my fill."
patientgamers,3cdur4,freeogy,2,Tue Jul 7 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds counter-intuitive, but i actually knocked down the difficulty to Easy so that it made the alien appearance a lot rarer and more ""special"" so to speak. It became that dramatic horror event it was supposed to be. He's still an instant kill, so it really helped increase the tension when you didn't know whether or not he would show up or if the tracker was just bluffing, as opposed to him just always being there. Of course on Easy he's still very keen and you can't just run everywhere, use loud weapons with abandon, etc."
patientgamers,3cdur4,pushytub,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really kind of hate him always being there. It keeps the tension baseline way to high which makes turns the xenomorph into a xenosnore after a while."

patientgamers,3cdur4,telios87,4,Tue Jul 7 13:17:50 2015 UTC,"Nice review.  I agree with most of your points.  I never got to the point where I was completely unfazed by the Alien's presence, but I do think the game overstays its welcome a bit, and some of the sections start to feel a bit too similar towards the end.  I was also disappointed in the story, especially the moment-to-moment stuff.  I frequently forgot what exactly it was that I was supposed to be doing, other than ""go here, fix this, get this part"".  It would have helped to have some more memorable characters as well.  Amanda herself comes off reasonably well, but I have a hard time remembering any of the side-characters.  Even though you spend most of the game alone, I think having a couple of characters you really cared about could have upped the tension even more in certain circumstances.  Overall I loved it though.  One of the most atmospheric games I've ever played, and it really gives you a strong sense of place and presence in the world.  Definitely worth playing especially if you are a fan of stealth games, or the first Alien movie."

patientgamers,3cetax,PapaDuke,3,Tue Jul 7 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"RTS and turn-based stuff, a few recommendations: Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. It picks up where Civ left off, you are on an alien planet, entirely new technology trees, the voice overs are really good (and that kind of thing never mattered to me), and it has amazing replay value.  Another is Port Royale, which is the first of that series (and the best, IMO, though I do like PR3), a bit buggy, and maybe hard to find. It's an open world-ish economic simulator, but really it's about pirates. Arrrr. I used to play an old Avalon Hill game called Blackbeard, and wanted something to capture that idea, and it did.   Myth II: Soulbighter. This one is a real-time-tactical, but great game which, once purchased, can be updated to utilize more modern hardware (but runs fine on old) through Project Magma - all free. That site also includes the entire first game (Myth: The Fallen Lords, which was also awesome), in the form of recreated levels for the second.   Have to agree with the other suggestions as well - if you do like RPGs, in addition to the Baldur's Gate series, Planescape:Torment is widely-acclaimed as one of the best games of all time, and the Icewind Dale games were also very good.  Edit: to add to the chorus ... Diablo 2, Half-Life, Thief, Age Of Empires, I've played and loved all of them."

Also give older Jagged Alliance games a try if you haven't already (JA2, Unfinished Business and Wildfire, plus the great Urban Chaos mod), graphics are late '90s but still very playable in my oppinion. They still have the deepest TBS combat system to this date, old XCOM/UFO-style. And since we're at that, Xenonauts is a faithful modern remake of the original UFO/XCOM, and a pretty good one. Paradox games like Europa Universalis (IV, but III is also still playable), Crusader Kings (II, the first one isn't as good I hear), Victoria II you probably know about already.

Unreal had better graphics. What Half-life did that was so revolutionary was to present a game narrative told entirely through first-person gameplay, rather than boring cutscenes that ruined the immersion. By not pausing the game, and melding the story into the gameplay, Half-life made me feel like I was a part of that world. At the time (yep, there's that again), it was a breath of fresh air.  Now, of course, playing the original Half-life reveals its flaws: uneven pacing, bugs, low-res graphics, and some of the narrative tricks that were so magical at the time come off as a little obvious. Sometimes great games hold up, sometimes they don't.  I still think the ""Blast Pit"" level is pretty awesome, though. :)  As for games where I've never quite understood the hype, I would say every Elder Scrolls game before Skyrim."

patientgamers,3ccnpm,astrower,8,Mon Jul 6 23:45:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting that this was downvoted by someone.  I love Skyrim, and I'll keep coming back to it for a long time, but everything you've said is correct. The combat is basic and has been simplified from earlier games in the series. The world has been described aptly as ""wide as an ocean but shallow as a puddle"" because nothing you do has any noticeable effect. I think there are some memorable quests, but generally they only stand out because they're different from the usual ""Go and clear this mine"".  But despite that... it's a huge open sandbox. And that doesn't appeal to some people, I get that. But the reason I keep going back to it is that it provides the tools for me to roleplay pretty much any character type I desire. I'll almost always find new places in the world, even if they're not of any great significance. And yes, the modding scene helps immensely, though it can be a pain to set up."

Skyrim just didn't have anything to help it stand out to me, every part of it just felt so bland. I have no problem with ""casual"" games, but I felt like when they made Skyrim they made every attempt to suck out the life from previous games and make it as general as possible to appeal to the most people. I understand that from a business side that's a good thing but there are so many other RPGs I would rather get lost in."

Sometimes you just have to be in the right mood for something, and if you're just not, it's not worth slogging through it.  Maybe try it again after a few months.   I'm trying The Witcher  after bouncing off it a while ago. The combat can be  cumbersome or repetitive at times, for sure, but I do like the characters and setting. I will say I've rarely played a game so aesthetically captivating I want to live in it, but this is certainly one of those times.  The art style and sound are incredible.

What I really hate about the original is that it makes every you suck at every skill you haven't trained in. You can barely aim a gun in it unless you've dumped a bunch of points into it.

If Duke Nukem Forever was released the same year as Half-Life 2, it would have been a better game. Yet HL2 is praised and DNF is reviled. Again, I think HL2's greatest achievement is being a good engine showcase, and spawning a bunch of good games that use the engine, like Team Fortress 2, CS GO and Left 4 Dead.

Starsiege: Tribes came out about an half-year earlier than Half-Life, but it was a very unusual FPS at the time, not only because of it's mechanics, but also because it was purely focused on the multiplayer.

It's rare that it happens to me, but I was immediately pulled into the game. I like it when games throws you into an environment without much initial background information, and you just get to 'grow' into the plot. No long narrated intro, I want to play.  I don't actually mind it when a game has a lot of cutscenes, but at the start I just want to start and get the engine running before we take a breath, not the other way around.

I don't know if it aged badly or was always clunky, but it wasn't enjoyable.  And I've heard so many people say that it gets better after the first 30 minutes, the first hour, the first two chapters, whatever, or that it's perfectly fine to skip ahead to Witcher 2. But skipping ahead is not how I'm interested in playing story-driven games, and it doesn't feel like too much to ask that a game so critically acclaimed holds my attention from the offset rather than waiting for me to stockholm-syndrome myself into enjoyment.  I have also made attempts at enjoying Sid Meier's Pirates that have been unsuccessful, as I'm failing to see how it's any deeper than your average web flash-game.

Hated the combat, didn't find the world very exciting, and kept having to run back and forth in the same places.

But at the time I felt I needed really Long sessions to enjoy them mainly because of the importance of looting and the time you had to spend looting.  In Bioshock you spend a reasonably Long amount of time looting corpses, drawers, etc. and hacking. In 2 months I had 2 Major stops, managed to get hooked again by the game but at the third big stop the memories of looting and hacking all around not to be short of medikits and mana was annoying and ended up quitting the game (my pc not having a decent graphic Card also had an influence).  Something very similar happenned with the Witcher, I loved the books and were very hyped with the game. I loved the game as well, put a couple of hours into it but the constant herb recolection just drew my Patience at a Point. It's a pity, really. Many other aspects of both games are great, maybe i beat them at some rerun in the future."
patientgamers,3ccnpm,the_frickerman,2,Wed Jul 8 07:19:19 2015 UTC,I get your point. BS 2 is more combat focused and allows you to use guns and plasmids at the same time if that helps.  You also get a speargun 2/3 of the way through.

The plot revolves around a game whose Name is ""the world"" (if I remember right). So People in the real world attach themselves to VR machines to Play this RPG. There is an Anime whose plot is Prior to the 4 games, but is not mandatory to watch it really. Only if you want to watch the OVAs that came with every game.  So, back to game. You are just a character in this game. Every other Player is AI controlled but you can itneract with them and ask them to join your Team. You Play in a Team of 3 like an Action RPG, but you can control the others at any time by selecting certain powers from them (the game will pause while you select an abilitie from anyone, even your character).  This System is very much like the one the ery first Kingdom Hearts used.  So you move yourself around this RPG dungeon-based game that imitates an MMPORPG (but obviously is not really an MMPORPG).  The Story is interesting (some People are reported to pass out and never wake up when entering ""the world"" but their characters are still online and ""alive"" inside the game, and you have to investigate that) and was what I liked the most. The game System can get a bit frustrating maybe, as you can't save in the middle of a dungeon.  Hope I could make myself clear. Any questions just ask again."

However if a game had strong game mechanics like an RPG it'll still probably still be fun. Here's some that I can remember that I think would still hold up.

Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner (the first game is also worth trying out if you can find it for cheap, though it's nothing outstanding)   And if you have a PS3, I'd recommend getting the re-releases of the Kingdom Hearts games instead of the original PS2 versions, since the stuff that comes with 2's Final Mix (which you can play on a PS2 if you're fine with softmodding and playing a game with Japanese menus) is absolutely worth it IMO.  and I agree about Duelists of the Roses being a quality game ._."

patientgamers,3cb0kw,skeeverbutt,17,Mon Jul 6 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's almost universally agreed that FCR makes the first game better.  As for Witcher 2, I think there's some significant debate about it because there are much more significant changes. Check out the /r/witcher subreddit faq for info on recommended mods."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,nofantasyiseverfinal,3,Mon Jul 6 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"The problem with Witcher 2 is that there's not enough combat, or at least not after you've levelled significantly. So all the upgrades you select can be used only once or twice and that's it."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,silverionmox,11,Mon Jul 6 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't mind the combat in Witcher 1. It's a little mindless, but it feels cool when you get a nice streak going, and Geralt is going HAM on everything.  I've only made it to Chapter 2, though, because I got really bogged down in the mystery, all the back and forth fetch stuff, and then the huge difficulty spike in the swamps. I need to go back and play some more, but it was pretty discouraging (after really liking chapter 1, too!)."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,double_shadow,3,Mon Jul 6 16:41:55 2015 UTC,Ya the swamps kinda sucked for a while. I'm playing on hard and the only real issue I was having was the echinops since they hurt so much. Try making a beeline to the cave at the south to learn the Quen sign and be able to run past things without dying.
patientgamers,3cb0kw,Copurnucus,3,Mon Jul 6 17:33:35 2015 UTC,"Most of the swamp you can just run through until you get to a safe area. I agree, some really hard moments in the swamp, but for the most part, you can bypass almost all of it. There is one side quest that kills me about 10 times EVERY time (when you are fighting with the druid in the swamp), but it IS possible!"
patientgamers,3cb0kw,Cyberphil,4,Mon Jul 6 17:36:23 2015 UTC,Don't you wind up underleveled if you run past too many of the enemies? I would definitely love to skip most of it if I can though!
patientgamers,3cb0kw,double_shadow,2,Mon Jul 6 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you will get to max level even if you walk past most of the enemies if you do all the quests you can. Running through the swamp made things so much easier. I began the game my first play-through killing everything I walked into in the swamp, but it was just grueling. Took extremely long, yeah I leveled, but I ran out of swallows pretty quickly. For your own sanity, walk past most monsters in the swamp."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,Cyberphil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"That part of Chapter 2 is exactly where I quit for months the first time I played. Rally glad I went back after someone else encouraged me, though."

patientgamers,3cb0kw,arctic_arcanum,8,Wed Jul 8 22:00:40 2015 UTC,Many many thanks for the heads-up on FCR. I went straight from completing DA:O to TW1 and quit after a couple of hours because the combat felt so mindless - you have to press LMB in time with visual flashes.   I obviously have never used FCR but I'm confident there's no way it could make the combat worse.
patientgamers,3cb0kw,DigitoCrepitus,9,Mon Jul 6 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"You still have the same combat system, it just is a rebalance. You have timed clicks just like stock witcher, but it changes damage values, enemy health and damage, and your own health and armor. It makes it more a few shots is all that is needed to kill most monsters. But the same applies to you. It only takes a few good hits to kill geralt. I recommend (if you plan on playing the game more than once) that you play your first playthrough stock."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,Cyberphil,2,Mon Jul 6 17:34:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification - I'll still give it a try, if it makes combat quicker (even if it becomes much harder or much easier) then it sounds great. My gaming time is down to about 7 hours a week so I want to get the most out of it!"
patientgamers,3cb0kw,DigitoCrepitus,5,Tue Jul 7 10:10:24 2015 UTC,"Just to let you know, I was in the same boat as you a few weeks ago.  I installed it and tried it out.  The mod made 1v1 fights extremely easy and made big group fights damn near impossible.  I felt like it was too easy to kill enemies because the damage was more 'realistic' (as long as I didn't take damage) which also meant that Geralt takes more damage as well.  Needless to say, I uninstalled the FCR mod and installed a couple of texture mods as well as the Rise of the White Wolf Mod (I recommend).  I am thoroughly enjoying the game with the default combat system and playing on a harder difficultly that is available through the White Wolf mod.    The only gripe I had (using the harder difficulty) is the boss fight at the end of chapter 1 has a huge difficulty spike.  The game design for this boss fight was poorly implemented and it makes this fight extremely difficult.  When you fight the doggies, cheese your way through this fight as it is not worth the time to try and beat this fight the right way.  Enjoy the rest of the game after that."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,DagsJ,3,Mon Jul 6 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the evil dog fight is a challenge regardless of mods.   I'm sure it's also the last straw for unconviced players that just want to give the Witcher 1 a try. The whole chapter 1 and, particularly, this fight are pretty much attrocious. Which is a shame, as right after all this is when the game gets really interesting, meaty and FUN."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,kenoxite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"That big dog fight was, IMHO, really poorly designed.  Prior to that encounter you can sort of get by with button mashing and never really learning the combat system.  Most (including myself) go into that fight completely unprepared for the ramp in difficulty.  Though it was the boredom of the endless fetch quests to the swamp that caused me to give up my first playthrough.  These have gotten somewhat more palatable when they fixed the load time issues in the extended edition."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,jakdak,2,Tue Jul 7 16:14:03 2015 UTC,The dog fight is a test to make sure you're paying attention to the alchemy. Mix up the healing potion and the oil that makes your sword kill ghosts and it's no problem.
patientgamers,3cb0kw,xtagtv,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:49:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is part of actually learning the combat system vs button mashing.   My point is that the game doesn't do a good job of preparing you for that battle- you can muddle through the game up to that point and then suddenly you are slammed with a seemingly unwinnable boss battle.  (Especially if you don't have potions prepared)"

A few hours in and the combat was just so... blah.  I also wasn't a huge fan of the waiting/meditation mechanic and not being able to meditate when it's raining. Just standing around waiting for some guy to show up at the bar at night was kind of annoying.   I love the story though so hopefully FCR makes me enjoy it a bit more."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,data_double,3,Mon Jul 6 16:15:05 2015 UTC,I have read people recommending TW1 as a game you put on easy just to experience the story. I am hoping by the time I finish TW1 and TW2 I can snag TW3 for less than 30 bucks.
patientgamers,3cb0kw,OldmanChompski,3,Mon Jul 6 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looking at the FCR mod that added a casual mode and it sounded like every fight you would automatically win and not have to worry about oils and potions.

There seems to be a ton of ""meet this person over here at noon"" or ""this person will arrive at midnight over there"" actions (at least in Chapter 2) but I didn't find it too troublesome. I just always went to the Inn and got a room for the night (5 orens) and meditated to the time the quest required. I also haven't experienced any issues with meditating while raining - maybe because I always do it inside of an inn? Might be worth trying when you pick it back up. :)"
patientgamers,3cb0kw,lacsativ,3,Mon Jul 6 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"I say don't install it for your first play through. I am in the middle of my first Witcher 1 play through (on Chapter 3 now) and while I think the vanilla combat system is clunky at first, it's not that bad once you get used to it. I can get combos going and slash away at a group of monsters or humans. I haven't tried FCR at all but I'm also the kind of guy who does a vanilla play through first before installing any kind of mods.   You could also try stock combat until at least Chapter 2, which is when I started feeling comfortable with it, just to see if it works out. If you end up hating it, give FCR a try.  Also just a heads up - I thought the beginning of the game dragged on for quite a while and I was ready to give up. The story got really interesting in Chapter 2 though, and you start to see the effects of some of your earlier decisions. Now I'm hooked and can't wait to go back and play."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,UnclaimedUsername,6,Mon Jul 6 19:40:04 2015 UTC,How about giving the combat a try before trying a mode? I ended up liking it. It's certainly not for everybody but it's rather unique.
patientgamers,3cb0kw,samuskay,2,Mon Jul 6 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the combat is not the biggest barrier to entry for The Witcher, it's the endless running back and forth between objectives. If there's a fast travel mod I'd do that instead, and really commit to sticking it out through acts 1 and 2. It was really rough for me in the beginning but I'm closing in on the end of the game and I'm glad I kept playing (after one false start about a year ago)."
patientgamers,3cb0kw,PerfectPlan,2,Mon Jul 6 22:41:47 2015 UTC,Don't use fcr!!!! Play 1 and 2 how they were meant to be played. Fcr changes the combat in a way it wasn't designed for and it is designed to in some ways make the combat harder!
patientgamers,3cb0kw,Hjortur95,2,Tue Jul 7 00:15:27 2015 UTC,"Play the game as designed, no mods. Completely unnecessary.  The combat in W1 is just fine, there's nothing wrong with it. It requires using your brain, I can only assume all the folks that rail against are just click click fiends who don't want to actually think while playing.  By using your brain, I mean two things. First of all, you have to investigate in books and dialogue in the game to learn about the enemies. Some need strong mode, some need group mode, some fast mode, and you have steel and silver swords as well. Using fast steel when you need strong silver will be far less effective, and so on. You need to learn and remember what you're fighting so that you can get into the proper mode before the fight starts.  Secondly, the actual fight itself you need to use your brain, because it's timing based. You can't just click-click-click rapidly, you'll never hit anything. You have to click, wait a half second for a visual and sound clue that your character is ready to attack again, then click again, and so on.  Oh, and learn Aard. :)"

Their streaming service is disgustingly over-priced and low-res too (I've got a 50 mbps service and live near one of their data centers, it's the service, not my connection), so I'd really recommend just waiting out for either more games to be ported over, maybe digitally, or just enjoying ps4 exclusives as they roll out, which they seem to be taking their sweet time doing."

patientgamers,3cbmem,forkinanoutlet,3,Tue Jul 7 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the unlimited streaming service is really worth it unless you completely missed the last generation or you've never owned a PlayStation. Check out the games list and if you think that the library is expansive and deep enough to merit $20 a month, then go for it.  Personally, I've played most of the last gen games on the list and I don't find the library big enough, but if it looks good to you, go for it.  For PS4 exclusive games, it depends on what you're willing to pay. Games haven't really come down in price that much yet, so you'll probably be paying $20+ for most of the games you get.  On the cheaper end, there's Dynasty Warriors (pretty much no story), Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition (good story), Tomb Raider (decent story), Watch_Dogs (I found this totally forgettable), Shadow of Mordor (I thought it was really fun, story was forgettable, though) annnnd... I think that's about it. Actually, I don't think any of those are PS4 exclusives. Nevermind.  The cheap side of the current gen library is mostly rereleases or launch titles, so it's not fantastic quite yet."
patientgamers,3cbmem,Kirboid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:28:18 2015 UTC,That's helpful; I haven't had a PlayStation since the original - definitely haven't played much in the way of PS3 games. There are definitely games I'd like to check out there - I'll have to figure out it if I can play what's interesting to me in a reasonable amount of time. It's probably worth a month or 3 to me. More than that doesn't make sense (especially given my steam backlog!)
patientgamers,3cbmem,Kirboid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"Edit: No, not exclusives - but I enjoyed Sleeping Dogs, Tomb Raider and what I played of Shadow of Mordor, for whatever that's worth."

patientgamers,3c8130,rarelypost,11,Sun Jul 5 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"I would say City is actually better because the bosses are more varied. Especially the Mr Freeze fight was fun. Asylum bosses are essentially all just the mutated henchman, which gets old after a while."
patientgamers,3c8130,CptFastbreak,3,Sun Jul 5 22:01:49 2015 UTC,Origins I also enjoyed :). Although you might want to play it after a break so as to not suffer from series fatigue too much.
patientgamers,3c8130,CaptainDisplayBook,3,Sun Jul 5 22:03:05 2015 UTC,I consider Mr. Freeze one of the best boss fights in any game ever.

patientgamers,3c8130,JohnBovril,2,Wed Jul 8 18:49:58 2015 UTC,It was the point at which I stopped playing the game because I was unable to beat the fucker :-(
patientgamers,3c8130,pragmatick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:09:01 2015 UTC,"Mr Freeze was the only good boss fight in Arkham City because it was the only one that you had to work out how to win by yourself. Plus he was the only one where you had to use more than one technique to win. All the other ones told you in advance which button combination you needed to press to beat the boss.  For example, I still remember the huge disappointment when faced with Solomon Grundy (wow, a massive boss who cannot die - this will be good!) only to be given instructions on how to do a quick spray on the floor of the Explosive Gel. Even as I write this I actually have the urge to put that last sentence in spoiler tags because it seems like the very definition of spoiler text. So why did the game do it.  Maybe it is just that I played Arkham Asylum a long time ago, but I don't recall having my hand held quite so much in the first game. In years to come when I have the urge to replay a Batman game, I know that I will choose Asylum because it had a more focused story & gameplay, it allowed you to spend the time to learn what you had to do, and your actions have more impact on the world (if you cleared an area then it stayed cleared and the thugs didn't jump back up again and continue on the same paths that proved so ineffectual before)."
patientgamers,3c8130,GadgetGamer,2,Mon Jul 6 12:32:49 2015 UTC,I love the sense of freedom and openness in city. It is one of my favorite games of all time.
patientgamers,3c8130,PoisonousMonkey,2,Sun Jul 5 22:46:36 2015 UTC,I do! I've had both sitting in a drawer for months so I'm excited to finally get started.
patientgamers,3c8130,escheriv,3,Mon Jul 6 01:15:20 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  I agree that Arkham Asylum was 100% brilliant, but Arkham City felt so undirected and designed to include every possible kitchen sink that I stopped playing very early on and never felt the urge to pick it back up."
patientgamers,3c8130,rarelypost,2,Mon Jul 6 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"I think you should give it another shot.  I know at the first it can seem overwhelming, like they're just trying to throw in every villain they can when you compare it to Asylum, which was more focused on Batman making his way through the asylum more than anything else.  I felt the same way you did when I first started playing City, like they were just trying to do too much at once, but after pushing through that initial thought I realized it was just as good, if not better than Asylum.   If you're not a fan of the open world nature and dealing with side quests and exploration then that will always be present and you can't really get past those aspects.  Either way, I'd say give it another shot, push past any initial thoughts of ""trying to do too much"", and just see if it doesn't click for you as you play more."
patientgamers,3c8130,Attheveryend,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:55:21 2015 UTC,"my issue with arkham city is that it suffers from assassins creed 3 syndrome, that being that the scavenger hunt sidequests are super boring grinds to get to additional content, and as a completionist for games like this I get overwhelmed at the amount of crap work I have to do to get to the riddler, and annoyed that you must complete layers of scavenger hunts to get to a boss.  I haven't finished the game as a result.  Its just filler content probably intended to serve as a pseudo-post-game.  Other than that, the game is super solid."
patientgamers,3c8130,rygiaaai,3,Mon Jul 6 17:36:01 2015 UTC,I'm playing it for the second time now. The Scarecrow and Killer Crocs parts are scary as fuck. I'm a grown ass man and these two just make me a little pussy.

patientgamers,3c8130,dihydrogen_monoxide,2,Tue Jul 7 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"I had an issue with that at first until I realized what was going on -- make sure you're getting your chains as high as you can, that's how you get to use all of the crazy special moves and get extra XP. You have to time it so that you keep punching and countering in an unbroken chain. It's more of a rhythm thing than a typical button mashing beat 'em up, which is what I was expecting after growing up on the Batman SNES games, but it really works when you start trying to get your chain as high as you can.  Edit -- I just saw your flair -- it's actually a lot like the combat in Remember Me, just with mainly the one button as opposed to crazy combos of all the buttons."
patientgamers,3c8130,JohnBovril,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"Is there a ""faster"" way to finish fights?  The takedown cinematics seem to slow the game."
patientgamers,3c8130,LazyGit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"The fastest way in arkham city is to just rack up the highest combo and observe 'criticals'. That's where you only click to attack once, so you're not spamming the attack button but patiently waiting until you've blocked this thing then clicking once. It doubles up the multiplier and possibly does more damage. The mechanics in Arkham Asylum are a little bit less polished than City and as such can lead to longer fights but you'll no doubt warm to the combat system and be taking down rooms full of thugs in no time.  It really is the finest combat system for a third person action game that I've ever seen. Just pull back from button mashing and go with precision and pace."
patientgamers,3c8130,lukesclusive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:41:34 2015 UTC,All I do is button mash the punch button.   That's probably where you're going wrong. You should be timing your hits with the action. Have you been choosing upgrades to the fighting mechanism? Like combo takedowns etc? If you take the critical hits upgrade then after a certain multiplier each hit is a knockout punch.

patientgamers,3c8130,JohnBovril,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:25:08 2015 UTC,"What I like about AA is how pleasing the visual is, how simple yet look complicated/badass the combat is, how you won't get lost, how you wont have to be frustrated with reloading saves (auto-save and no regrettable/unreversible decision to be made). Maybe I've become a more casual gamer, but whatever it is, I like it.  Also, I feel Dishonored has that similar playstyle like Arkham series. Anyone with me on this?"
patientgamers,3c8130,rtan713,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:54:33 2015 UTC,"There's certainly similarities to be drawn from both. I think the 'attention to detail' and 'tight linear storyline with extra diversions if you want to explore' are two that stand out. Dishonoured probably takes a step down for me in two ways when compared to Batman AA: The cyclical nature of missions that have you go out, do stuff, and come back to the pub felt a little miserly, perhaps contrived. It's missing the opportunity to expand the world and instead tries to explain the characters in the pub, to a slim degree of success. Secondly, the moral system in Dishonoured doesn't do enough to make pacifism hard work - the last level has a light/dark version depending on your level of homocide in the preceding game. If you are a brutal, heartless murderer, there are more guards. I think it would be the opposite - after all you've spent a game carefully not killing guards so they should all have been reposted to the last level. This is more of a wider gripe with the lack of consideration in morality systems with games though. Being good should be hard and thankless and perhaps bite you in the arse further down the road. Being bad should be quick and easy, and perhaps bite you in the arse further down the road."

patientgamers,3c708g,dorkknight,4,Mon Jul 6 08:44:30 2015 UTC,"The big difference is that MC is focused on exploration and building, while Terraria is focused on combat and character development. The funny part is that Normal mode is only barely scratching the surface - Beating the Wall of Flesh (Hell's big boss, and the hardest boss in Normal mode,) will change the world into Hard mode... And the size of the game suddenly quadruples.   There is definitely some neat stuff in Normal, but it's largely just an ore grind to get to the next equipment tier... And it's largely linear each time - Mine your copper/tin near the surface, then your iron/lead slightly below the surface. Then you move onto caves, where you find your silver/tungsten, and finally your gold/platinum. You should have beaten the Eye boss by now. Once you have gold, you go visit the Corruption/Crimson, to get your Nightmare/Crimtane equipment, and beat the Eater/Brain boss. You can also use some Meteorite armor to supplement the pieces of Nightmare/Crimson you're missing, but you'll miss out on the set bonuses by mixing and matching. Once you're geared up, you dive down to hell. Maybe even dig a hellevator, so you can just drop straight down whenever you die, (which will be often, especially if you're playing on an Expert world...) Once you're in hell, you start mining Hellstone. It's a pain in the ass too mine because it turns into lava, but it's what you'll need to beat the Wall of Flesh. Once you're geared out with Molten, you go fight the Wall. Ranged is definitely the only way to go with this fight... You may even need to enlist the help of a friend. But once you beat it, hard mode opens up and you're pretty much free to do whatever you want."

patientgamers,3c708g,BrooksConrad,3,Sun Jul 5 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"Dude.  The DLCs are fantastic! Easily some of the best ever for any game.  They just add so much to the overall game.  And I will agree that NV is the better overall game, but there's just something about the atmosphere of 3 that keeps me coming back.  And, of course, mods help keep things fresh.    For DS, I'm with ya there.  On most of my subsequent playthroughs, I just use the master key and just skip the depths (except to get Laurentius) and go the back way through the literal shit that is Blighttown. That usually keeps me from hitting that wall.  Plus, invading people wearing a sack on my head and a dress is always fun."

Hmm, might start doing that myself, guess you don't need the key from the GD if you're going master key. Also, WildPie is the shit, I've rewatched Anor Londo more than I care to admit."

patientgamers,3c708g,lordxi,2,Mon Jul 6 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"I've played through the 3rd one a few times now, and it gets better to me with each playthrough.   I only found the overarching unitology and marker plot line interesting in the game, and that doesn't really seem to be the main plot focus until latter parts of the game..  The combat is definitely the most action-oriented out of the entire series. You will find that the game places you in some unfair fights, as it throws way more enemies at you for each encounter than the first two games.  All this being said, however, if you are a Dead Space fan, or you want to explore a unique world that oozes ambience, you should give it a shot. Also, the microtransactions aspect of the game is completely ignorable, and the plot adjusts accordingly if you are playing solo vs Co op. Plus, the game should be pretty dang cheap now, so I would give it a go if you have the chance."

The controls to the Ultima Underworlds are very clunky since they were arguably the first modern first-person games with complete freedom of movement (much more freedom of movement than DOOM, and came out sooner!), and no one had worked out the modern FPS mouse-and-keyboard control scheme yet. But, if you can get past that, they are awesome, immersive, story-driven first person RPGs with a lot of freedom of choice. The Underworlds are from the same folks that went on to produce Thief, System Shock 2 and Deus Ex, after all. I could describe them sort of like Elder Scrolls games, but a lot more focused, with a lot less filler and a lot more interesting writing. But again, I'm biased :)  Ultima 7 and 7.5: Serpent Isle were also pioneers of the open-world RPG, except from isometric perspective instead of first person. Very wonderfully handcrafted and vibrant worlds where every nook and cranny has something interesting hiding and everyone has something interesting to say. There's a real spirit of adventure in those games."

It has a completely reworked Sphere Grid, and some new bosses.  I'm currently playing through it, and loving it - The sphere grid was redone to be more like a wheel - Each character's path is a distinct ""spoke"" of that wheel, and similar characters are near each other... There also seems to be fewer lock spheres... So, for instance, you can have Yuna jump over to Lulu's path to learn some black magic, in between her learning Cure and Cura. It allows for a LOT more customization than the original grid did."

Though it sadly has a few game-breaking bugs. For instance, it's a 4-disc game, and many copies had a bad third disc. As in, a large percentage of the games they printed and shipped weren't finishable because the game would hang at a specific part on the third disc. There wasn't anything you could do about it, except buy a new disc and hope that it was a good print. Also, transforming during the Water Dragon fight causes the game to freeze during the following cutscene...

If we're talking classics, A Link to the Past and Mega Man X are my go-to ""short"" games that I can run through in an hour or two, and they never get old.

It's worth a shot, but don't feel bad if you don't finish it - By today's standards, it is pretty clunky. The second game, Going Commando, is where the series really begins to shine. The third game, Up Your Arsenal, took all the good things from 2 and improved on them... Sadly the fourth game, Deadlocked, was pretty bad. Exploration and secret-hunting was a big part of the R&C series, but they stripped that away in favor of a game made up almost entirely of Arena challenges, similar to the previous games' arenas... The arenas were fun in the previous games, but it's difficult to make a good game entirely from them..."

patientgamers,3c7ojd,Ignore_User_Name,3,Mon Jul 6 07:55:33 2015 UTC,"Recommending the rest of the Elder Scrolls series seems fairly obvious, but just in case you haven't already played it, check out Morrowind.  FTL is a good strategy/RPG. It's a bit different from your typical strategy game in that you're only controlling one ship, but within that ship you have to manage your weapon systems, crew, and various other systems and be able to identify which systems you need online more at any given moment. For example: do you turn off the oxygen for an extra boost to your shields or risk your ship to keep your crew's HP up?  Also, at this point I feel like a drone for recommending them, but check out the D&D collection on Good Old Games. All of them are spectacular, but Planescape: Torment and (IMO) Neverwinter Nights deserve special attention."
patientgamers,3c7ojd,rarelypost,3,Mon Jul 6 20:01:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most open world games will have relatively large install sizes and they come with patches and DLC that pushes the size up more also.

patientgamers,3c7ojd,BaneJammin,3,Sun Jul 5 18:36:09 2015 UTC,If you're not a fan of difficult combat and constantly dying until you learn the ropes then I'd probably stay away from Dark Souls.  It's not an easy adventure through an open world and most enemies can kill you in 2-3 hits.  The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is another open world suggestion you might like if you enjoyed Fallout 3.  All three of the games in the series are around 5-6 GB each.  The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games have a more realistic approach to surviving in a wasteland with a darker atmosphere than Fallout 3.

Fun so far, but only 2 hours in.  Feels just like Mario and Luigi: SuperStar Saga (which it should!).   Finally, a little bit of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.

patientgamers,3c72mz,Dohi64,6,Mon Jul 6 00:44:16 2015 UTC,"terraria: obviously. 1.3 came out on tuesday, so this was a no-brainer. once again, an insane amount of new stuff, so as with each major content patch, we started a new world with new characters (and after a couple hours chest placement and organization took over, as usual). we didn't pick expert mode, as it's just the two of us and even some hardmode bosses were problematic before, let alone the wave events, and we haven't even seen duke fishron yet (or found a single mount), but I'm excited to run into the new things (got a slime mount already, though the slime rain event was a bit underwhelming) and hopefully try the new endgame stuff eventually. we'll only be able to play a few hours together each week, but I'll wander around and try to make some progress between sessions.  multi through steam works great, finally no more hamachi (port forwarding and such never worked for us). my new favorite thing so far are the npcs fighting back (the painter with the paint gun is awesome) and talking to each other, and the pre-generated rail sections. the first we discovered lead to a new biome, the underground desert, which is kinda dangerous when starting out. and there are creepy noises and sounds everywhere now. the marble biome is not that great-looking, but the medusa there is a dick, turns you into stone of course. some achievements seem to be bugged, not always triggering when they should've but I don't care that much about it.  battleblock theater: picked it up at 90% off even though platformers aren't for me, I don't even have a controller or people to co-op with, plus it doesn't have a demo, unlike castle crashers by the same devs (which I didn't pick up because a remastered version is coming whenever.)  the cutscenes are hilarious (one of the funniest intros ever, WHSOOOSHOOSHOO!) but I couldn't really enjoy them because they came after really frustrating chapter finale levels and I was still fuming most of the time. the narrator throughout the game is great, you can even set how much he talks and how active the audience's cheering should be. the gameplay is pretty good too, very fast paced and levels are short, so replaying them wouldn't be a big deal, except as the game went on I was glad I could finally finish some fucking levels, let alone retry them for more gems or yarn, which are pointless anyway. gems only get you more masks that have no gameplay effect and the various weapons you can get for yarn aren't that useful either.  what makes the game really frustrating (apart from my lack of skills) is the timed levels. regular ones have desk-hitting sections too (fucking spikes, sawblades, disappearing blocks, ice, a mostly immortal dog that eats you alive, and a seeking missile shooting robot you can only disable for a short time), but add a countdown timer and it's a whole different thing. fortunately only the chapter finales and the encores are timed, but finales are double levels, so you can't just quit after the first. encores are even more challenging, so I wish in normal mode they didn't have a timer at all, but they're optional and as it is, I did about half of them and didn't bother with the rest, regular levels towards the end and the finales provided more than enough frustration. there are also secret levels, I'm guessing one per chapter, but I only found them in chapters 1 and 3 and those were fun.  initially I thought I'd do 2 chapters a day (there are 8) but towards the end I had to stop after every few levels, it was just too much. and as much as I wanted to finish the game, I simply couldn't. chapter 7, level 5 had a section towards the very end that had me hanging from the ceiling and jump from block to block like that, with lasers between them and sawblades at the bottom. had I been able to do 3 consecutive successful jumps, I would've moved on but I didn't feel like re-doing the level again later (chapter 7 makes you go through most levels twice basically, there and back in one go), so I must've tried at least 500 times, with short breaks while the game was running, and I still only managed to do 2 jumps, like twice, and the first one about 5 or 6 times, the rest was death after death. so after a while I said fuck it and watched a let's play. I also tried a few user-made levels and tried the multiplayer game modes against the ai because noone on my friends list is playing it right now. and that's about it. I think the last game I couldn't finish like this was retro city rampage. oh well...  tera (last week): just a footnote as I haven't played all week but cleared two more sectors last weekend and I'd like to make some progress this weekend too. now that I don't have battleblock to play, I might just do that..."

patientgamers,3c72mz,pkGamerB,3,Sun Jul 5 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"I finished up my first Mass Effect 2 playthrough a few days ago. Did all of the loyalty, DLC missions (Kasumi, Arrival, and Shadow Broker were all great), and every sidequest I managed to find. I could say so much about this game, so I'll mostly just talk about how awesome the final mission was.   Major spoilers ahead!    As much as I enjoyed the first game, this one blew it away. ME1 had a slightly more interesting story, but ME2 did a better job of world building, and the antagonists seemed a lot more threatening. I loved the new characters, and the loyalty missions were a great way to flesh them out. Jack, Mordin, and Kasumi were my favorite new characters. Getting my two favorite squad members from ME1 to rejoin my team in ME2 was a nice immersion bonus. Not sure if that was just coincidence or if they were popular characters.   Overall, amazing game, and I had to get right into ME3. I'm already a good 15 hours in and loving it so far, but I'll save that for next week's thread."

And yeah, starting ME2 and finding out you will get completely new squad and then crossing paths with old characters was nice."

patientgamers,3c72mz,berniens,2,Fri Jul 10 06:29:45 2015 UTC,"Been playing a good bit of Hearthstone lately.  They recently added a new mode called ""Tavern Brawl"" which I'm having a lot of fun with.  It's a variation of the typical Hearthstone match that changes every week with a new twist or gimmick.  For example, last week was a mode in which you got a ""banana"" card every time one of your minions dies (banana cards being low-cost spells that either enhance minions or do small amounts of damage).  I like it a lot because it allows them to bring something fresh and fun to the game without having to agonize over whether it's perfectly balanced or not (since it's only going to last a week).  Apart from that I've begun delving back into Planescape Torment for about the third time.  I like the game a lot because it is so dense in terms its world, the story, and the reams of dialogue, but those are also the reasons why I have to be in a certain mood (and have a certain amount of free time) to really get into it.  Hopefully I will stick with it this time because I am really intrigued by the story and there is always something strange and interesting going on."

I really love the content and questing - has alot to do with the current promotion x12 xp that allows you to be able to just do character quests, without side quests (if you want to). I tried it when it was first released and found progression too slow and grindy, but now its nearly perfect, no lulls. Plus they have regularly updated and its quite a full game.

I'm still intending to play through the entire GoG D&D games bundle (substituting enhanced editions where possible) in order.    I started out expecting to hate BG and ended up really loving it.  Right now I'm back to hating it for its random difficulty spikes.  It's quite possible to easily beat a boss fight then get your ass handed you by some trash mobs (I'm currently stuck in the thieves maze.  I beat the boss right before it, but now am facing two doom guards that I literally can't do a point of damage to), or to come up against a fight that assumes you remembered to pack the right set of potions/scrolls (basilisks, anyone?).

I remember when I first played it, I thought I would never be able to beat it... A lot of loading happened (which took FOREVER back then). Staying true to D&D mechanics, battles can become difficult very quickly due to misses and taking critical hits. My recommendation as a seasoned vet is to make sure you explore every area before going to Baldur's Gate. There are plenty of powerful items to be found. Also, party make-up has a lot to do with difficulty. Picking the right team members can definitely mean the difference between beating the game or not."

I honestly don't know how many people are still playing Brotherhood, Revelations, and AC3 online anymore, but I would bet it's a pretty low number.

To OP: Total War, especially the earlier games, are most famous for their modding communities. Can't even remember what mods were good for it, but IIRC Europa Barbarorum, Roma Surrectum, and Rome Total Realism are generally considered the best.  Medieval 2+Kingdoms is rarely played vanilla, though most often people will advise you to start with those. I wouldn't. Play Stainless Steel for a retooled (better) vanilla Medieval campaign. The same team pulled off a gorgeous LotR mod called Third Age Total War.

It'll keep you busy for a long time! So I suggest jumping straight into it. As long as you like the Japanese them.  If not go for Medieval 2.
patientgamers,3c5o5u,CaptainDisplayBook,28,Sun Jul 5 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"Saying that Shogun 2 is the best in the series is highly subjective. I personally feel it suffers from a lack of diversity, all the factions are Japanese after all and have a lot of near identical units. However not a bad starting point for someone new to the series.  I'd personally go for Medieval II though because it's easier from there to go back to the original Rome as well as jump forwards to the newer ones."

patientgamers,3c5o5u,thr33pwood,2,Sun Jul 5 07:35:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with Shogun 2. The older ones are good, but the technical aspect feels... well, old. I know a lot of people dislike Rome 2, but I love the history surrounding Rome, and I don't find the flaws people talk about to be too bad. I also think they've released some updates to fix things up. Just don't buy the DLC, it's overpriced. Alos, Napoleon Total War is great if you like that time setting. The naval battles are cool, and I like 19th century artillery and tactics.   I would say Napoleon or Shogun 2 first, and then if you feel like it, continue with Rome 2 or Medieval 2"
patientgamers,3c5o5u,zuperpretty,2,Sun Jul 5 09:58:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to tip my hat to Empire, I love that time period so I'm biased but... Its great strength is the diplomacy and state building side of it which is in my experience the least prone to nonsensical declarations of war (Medieval 2 suffers from this) Its also huge in scope and the variety of governments and cultures is interesting (although mostly European). I love building up proxy states and coalitions more than just constant combat. Weaknesses would be seige AI is pretty terrible (though still fun) and a pretty tough learning curve at the beginning."

Not sure what it was, but when I finished the game I felt literally no urge to go back and do the non story parts, or even just screw around.   I ended up playing online, to try and enjoy the game, but right now that has serious issues with hackers and to be honest is the dullest grindfest ever without mates.   I'd say wait for it to go on a reasonable sale. The singleplayer experience can wait even if it is astonishingly gorgeous and entertaining, and online is pretty crap, so waiting a few months wont be an issue. I'd probably pay Â£30-40 for it at best."

It seems to me that you really would like to play this game. But you are worried about the cost to fun ratio. I, honestly would pay more for a game that I would enjoy than pay less for a couple of games that are meh.  I always give it a week or two weeks tops to let my ""impulsive buying"" wear off then see if you still feel the same way."

I personally don't think GTA V is worth over $30 at the most, but if you feel you can't wait and really want to play it you could grab it full price on Steam or use the GMG discount previously mentioned.    You could also always grab NotGTAV for 75 cents."

patientgamers,3c4mmk,giantenemygoat,2,Sat Jul 4 23:57:01 2015 UTC,"I bought it for the single player only on day one and have no regrets. I got 74 hours out of it and enjoyed pretty much all of them.   I'll be honest - I bought it at full price partially because I really wanted to play it, but partially to send a message to the publisher that I believe good PC games are worth paying for and that all games should be released on PC. Which I guess is kind of against the point of this sub, but if everyone only bought games when they were in the bargain bin, then companies wouldn't even bother with PC as a platform at all."

From a patient gaming and frugal standpoint it's been a master stroke, as I've only brought 2 other 360 games since.   Story mode kept me fully engaged for a month until online came out. On it's own, story mode is worth full price. But the real value in GTA5, to me, is GTA Online.  It's the best online game I've every played. So many different activities, sports, missions, races plus the ability to make your own with the creator. It's set up pretty well for a new player starting out. The best guns in the game used to be level locked. Now there's a bunch of DLC guns that are some of the best in the game, available from level 1. I don't know if there's still a free car from joining the Rockstar Social Club, also one of the best in its class, but the point is it's set up well for newbies, cos you will be hunted in the streets of free roam every so often by level 400s who've been doing it for a year and a half.   So yeah, if you liked the other GTA's then you'll like 5, and I think you should enjoy online. Per hour played, it's definitely one of the cheapest games I've brought.   Buy it."

I consider myself a patient gamer because the VAST majority of games I buy are for a couple dollars long after they came out, but GTA, Fallout and there's probably a couple others, I will buy at released because I like them and I want to strongly support the companies that make them because they have given me hundreds upon hundreds of hours of happiness."

In your case, with the summer sale now over, unless it comes up randomly on a daily deal, it'll be at least till Halloween before the next semi big chance of a sale. I like the suggestion to buy it at GMG if you can for cheaper. I'm a huge steam fanboy and love all my games to be steam, but GTA V was an exception since I got a good deal on pre-order + since you can only get a Steam key from steam, it'll be the same way with DLC, as in, all these sites will have sales on it but it'll be for ""retail copies"" only, if you lock yourself into steam now, you'll be paying a premium for every DLC it looks like.

Most if not all of us have so many games due to steam sales, humblebundle and more, that we probably never run out of things to play.

Missions are varied and no longer involve tailing everyone all the time.  Combat is fun and brutal.  You aren't bound by the creed so you can be as sadistic as you want to be.  Overall it's just way more fun in my opinon.   For $15 you can get both game which is a complete steal.

patientgamers,3c48cd,nem2k,2,Sat Jul 4 19:55:05 2015 UTC,Not sure if you've come to your conclusion yet but...  I think Black Flag alone is worth the $15.

I haven't played rogue yes but Black Flag was worth the $8 i paid for it on black friday so imho $15 is worth it for both games

patientgamers,3c48cd,Polloco,5,Sun Jul 5 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I don't think so. Sure, the gameplay is really fun, but the disaster of a story will make you want to bash your brains out. In the end I actually couldn't stand to continue playing, because as fun as the game was, the story had me gritting my teeth and I had plenty of other fun games anyways."
patientgamers,3c48cd,TheXenophobe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:25:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for that viewpoint!
patientgamers,3c48cd,wheretheusernamesat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:47:06 2015 UTC,I liked black flag. It's worth it.
patientgamers,3c48cd,DocJRoberts,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:55:06 2015 UTC,Rogue has the best storyline since 2. I loved the characters and the world
patientgamers,3c48cd,giantenemygoat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:58:30 2015 UTC,"I loved Black flag, and think it's worth it for that alone. Rogue is basically Black flag re-skinned with AC3 assets. Not bad, but didn't pull me in as much the second time, although the story shift from prior games was kinda cool."
patientgamers,3c35do,FromThatOtherPlace,100,Sat Jul 4 08:42:15 2015 UTC,"With Bethesda games, I typically do a vanilla run at release to get the ""intended"" experience, then more down the road to go completely ham with the mods. That also gives you a good mental baseline of how things are in the game and what to look for in a mod (or even what a mod broke)."
patientgamers,3c35do,bluemeep,18,Sat Jul 4 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"Bingo, I may even double dip and buy it on console first and wait for a GOTY edition to buy on PC later."
patientgamers,3c35do,Sonofsnow,4,Sat Jul 4 15:21:49 2015 UTC,Likewise. Also there can be some unexpected downsides to mods st times too. I feel that starting simple then just keep moving in more and more adds even more fun and value to the game.  Also if you're kinda a dummy like myself its easy to mess up and it's nice having mod tutorials up on YouTube.
patientgamers,3c35do,Randoodle,2,Sat Jul 4 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this. I do think that mods get a disproportionate focus among PC players, there's a lot of confirmation bias involved."
patientgamers,3c35do,Alex__V,4,Sun Jul 5 13:35:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a game I will break my patientgaming rules for.  I don't even expect it to be that great (I much prefer NV to FO3) but it will be important to gaming culture and I want to be there when it happens.  I've played Fallout since FO1 back in 1997, I had the beta of FO2, I may not preorder FO4 but I'll probably buy it 0day as long as the reviews don't indicate its broken (hi Arkham Knight!)."
patientgamers,3c35do,FalseTautology,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:18:37 2015 UTC,At least they have iron sights this time around. It seems they're improving on the gameplay a lot.
patientgamers,3c35do,Sugar_buddy,129,Sun Jul 5 00:20:18 2015 UTC,No one has the time to play a game like this twice   I think Fallout 3 and NV have great replayability.  Grabbing the New Vegas Ultimate Edition during a sale and playing through it again and seeing the DLC and mods would be worth it in my opinion.
patientgamers,3c35do,rarelypost,14,Sat Jul 4 11:59:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I play one or the other it seems every couple of years. Between mods and the sheer size of the game, replay value is superb."
patientgamers,3c35do,El_Dud3r1n0,6,Sat Jul 4 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"I've played New Vegas 4 times, and the DLC's twice. People just get bored I reckon."
patientgamers,3c35do,RockstarTyler,4,Sat Jul 4 19:27:48 2015 UTC,"I have 200+ games in my Steam backlog (nearly all purchased for < $5 mind you), but despite that, I'll still be playing Fallout 4 more than once, first time vanilla, bugs and all, and then all DLCs and select mods later on. Fallout is one of only a few games I'll throw away my patience for. Even got the Pip-boy Edition on the way."

patientgamers,3c35do,SpectralSolid,4,Sun Jul 5 02:19:31 2015 UTC,"That's my method. Buy it as soon as it comes out and play through it vanilla, then buy it again when the GOTY or 'Legendary' edition with all DLCs is on sale, mod that one."
patientgamers,3c35do,Psychethos,3,Wed Jul 8 18:25:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've been playing Skyrim since release. A game like this is something i'm even more likely to play twice.

patientgamers,3c35do,LostSoul1797,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:06:34 2015 UTC,"I honestly did not like new vegas the first time because it was ugly and buggy and felt like a mess of quantity over quality. The exploration aspect is weak compared to fallout 3 and that was my favorite thing I wanted more of. But now with a few mods to tidy up the visuals and the absolutely amazing dlc I am really finally able to appreciate the level of freedom and versatility in decision making that I was not fully aware of the first time around. I am littlefinger, and this is my game of  thrones."
patientgamers,3c35do,withateethuh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:31:03 2015 UTC,"Replay-ability aside, I kinda agree with the OP on not having time to dedicate to one game, not matter how great it is. There are some really great titles coming this and next year and spending more than 200 hours on a single one is really over the top of what I wish to dedicate."
patientgamers,3c35do,fre1gn,11,Sat Jul 4 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"No one has the time to play a game like this twice     It depends how you look at it. The cycles for these kind of games are very long, 3 to 5 years. I'd say that's plenty of time. There's no rush. And best is to put a very months or years between playthroughs, so it's all nice and fresh."
patientgamers,3c35do,remyspam,24,Sun Jul 5 00:19:25 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, although it will kill me, I'll probably wait till the GOTY version drops to around 15$ before picking it up."
patientgamers,3c35do,2_old_2B_clever,12,Sat Jul 4 18:09:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially seeing as Bethesda's GOTY games are usually cheaper (on sale) than buying the game earlier on and then the DLC later. I owned Skyrim, but sure enough Skyrim Legendary Edition was cheaper than getting just the DLC. Good way to treat those early supporters!"
patientgamers,3c35do,RafaelTheVengeful,2,Sat Jul 4 13:30:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just getting into modding, and most require the DLC and I having to buy the game twice is not cool."

So it's not so much what you are doing in the game that is important, but where.  I'll spread the experience over a month or two, occasionally picking up another title for a break in gameplay, like a puzzle game or racing game, but the games I enjoy the most are the ones that I can immerse myself in.    It's probably why I have such a huge backlog of games and consider myself a patient gamer.  Being able to spend so much time in these worlds allows me to wait on certain titles to go on sale."
patientgamers,3c35do,pickle182,3,Sat Jul 4 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"It also helps you to appreciate the games more, as you're taking your time to beat them rather then just rushing through to get to the next one.

patientgamers,3c35do,JudgeJoeCool,31,Sat Jul 4 20:05:44 2015 UTC,Disagree. One of the exceptions for me. Day one purchase
patientgamers,3c35do,1n5aN1aC,21,Sat Jul 4 14:13:16 2015 UTC,"Day 2 purchase, Bethesda games being the notorious bugfests they are I need to know that their first ""next gen"" foray isn't completely tits."
patientgamers,3c35do,AnAngryGoose,3,Sat Jul 4 17:29:31 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It's Bethesda.  Best to wait at least a week or two so it's actually playable.  :)
patientgamers,3c35do,methshin,2,Sat Jul 4 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is no way I could wait a whole week. I mean, I'd rather have a buggy FO4 for a while than no FO4."
patientgamers,3c35do,itsableeder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"BS, Skyrim was playable day 1.  I never had any issues on 360 or PC, beyond the odd freeze or a mod related issue."

I thought I'd got really lucky.  Then I ran in to a game breaking bug after about 200 hours. First bug I'd seen, and it meant I'd never get to see some parts of the game. I haven't picked it up since. Genuinely devastated."
patientgamers,3c35do,scylus,2,Sat Jul 4 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"One more here. Fallout 4 caught me in the hype, but I know enough about Bethesda to not buy on launch, I'll buy whenever it's fully playable.  I got to experience the double mistake of getting Fallout: New Vegas for console. My Euclid C-Finder stopped working and the only fix was a console command, which ironically can only be done on PC."
patientgamers,3c35do,PandaStyle00,4,Sat Jul 4 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. Skyrim Legendary Edition's lowest price on Steam is $13.59. Base Skyrim + DLCs' lowest price on Steam is $22.24. If you buy Fallout 4 at launch and, let's assume later on that it will have the same number and price of DLCs as Skyrim, which you also buy at launch, you'll need to fork up $100+ to own the complete game.   OP is correct in saying that Fallout 4 is one of the best games to apply patient gaming to, because more than most other publishers, Bethesda rewards patient gamers with their GOTY editions and screws early buyers in regards to DLC prices. This is why we never hear the end of Skyrim players complaining about how expensive its DLCs are. Knowing this, expect to pay premium for everything if you buy a Bethesda game at launch (in addition to the ton of bugs most Bethesda launches often have), and please don't complain about the prices afterwards since you now know full well what you're getting into."
patientgamers,3c35do,insan3soldiern,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the few times I buy a game full price I get that money back just by experiencing the game for longer. I have more time to play, explore, and if I want the dlc I can wait till they all drop in price. Meanwhile, mods are going to be out extrememly quickly so thats not really a problem, and its not problem for me since im a console gamer right now"
patientgamers,3c35do,houndi,4,Sat Jul 4 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"I know this is post was made with good intentions, but you don't know how much I and others will enjoy the game on release. You can't."
patientgamers,3c35do,dottmatrix,3,Sat Jul 4 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For me, this is the complete opposite of a patient game. I'll buy it at launch as it's been my favorite series for a couple of decades and I have thousands, plural, of hours gameplay on those games over the years.  If that's not worth 60â¬, I don't know what is."

Problem was, the only one I could order was for PS4, and being a ""patient gamer"", I don't have one of those yet.  I plan on getting one, just not this soon as I mainly game on PC.    So now, I'm going to have to double dip, and buy it on PC, as I don't want to get rid of the metal case that the game comes in, and I want to play this game day one, to the extent that I have booked off two days from work to do so.  I have no qualms replaying a Fallout or TES game years later, and my first time through should be vanilla to truly appreciate what Bethesda has done.  So while I may be patient when it comes to most games, there are exceptions."
patientgamers,3c35do,Gnarcade,3,Sun Jul 5 03:27:46 2015 UTC,Definitely not waiting. I love the Fallout Franchise too much to wait... What I have done and will do again is buy the base game a launch and then later one the GOTY edition is down to $10-$12 I'll but it with all the mods if they are worthwhile.   I love the game too much and I don't need anyone ruining any surprises or twists in the game before I play.
patientgamers,3c35do,rprcssns,2,Sat Jul 4 15:29:54 2015 UTC,"As stoked as I am that Fallout 4 is happening, I'm still going to wait and see if/how they handle paid mods before commiting."

I still haven't bought any of the DLC from Fallout 3, and mods don't apply to me at all. I can deal with a few bugs as long as they aren't game-breaking.  Fallout will definitely be a day 1 purchase for me. Fallout and Bioshock are the only games I struggle to be patient with."

patientgamers,3c35do,yakovgolyadkin,3,Sat Jul 4 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"For me, a 100+ hour game is only possible about twice a year. Two things cause this to be the case. The first is other commitments (work, relationship, non-gaming hobbies, chores etc.) For example in my case I have 2 days a week where I have any time at all to allocate to games, one day is a max of about 3 hours and the other day is about 10. With 13 hours of gaming a week, a 100 hour game is a huge commitment. Normally I play these games when I have holiday from work when I can commit 10 hours a day for about a week. But that is half my available holiday spent dedicated to a single gaming experience (aka it better be fucking worth it.)  The second cause is derivative of the first. Even with only 13 hours a week available, I  could still play a 100 hours spread over many months and have just as good an experience right? But then I could never play that small indie game that everyone said was amazing and his in the humble indie bundle. Or I could never play the huge AAA game from two years ago that's on sale right now. It makes it even harder to get through backlog of games and the mentality approaching the game as a completionist is closer to stress than excitement, I'm playing because I've started and I should finish, not because I want to. Thus greatly reduces the value of the game and the overall experience is somewhat ruined.   With these things in mind, it's hard enough to play through a long game once let alone twice. Its such a shame for me as well since I always enjoyed having new game+ options when I had more time for games. Now I play about 10 mins of new game+ to check out the starting changes and then switch to my next game. It makes me sad to think I've stopped enjoying that part of a game."
patientgamers,3c35do,uncle_moe,4,Sun Jul 5 03:45:16 2015 UTC,"Never, under any circumstances, do you buy a Bethesda game on launch. It will be riddled with bugs and glitches because Bethesda will cut corners and rush it out for the holiday season. Wait for the inevitable game of the year edition that will be patched and have all DLC for like $25."
patientgamers,3c35do,yoss250,2,Sat Jul 4 12:44:29 2015 UTC,And then wait for the next Steam sale and pick it up for $5.
patientgamers,3c35do,WakaIsMyWaifu,2,Sat Jul 4 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"I expect to spend hundreds of hours in Fallout 4 so this doesn't make much sense to me personally, and I would definitely not use mods on my first playthrough. Usually when I play a game for the first time I feel that mods will ruin the experience intended by the games developer, so mods are always something that comes later."
patientgamers,3c35do,MikeCharlieUniform,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"For me Fallout 4 is the perfect example of patient gaming and playing it on release will not counter that point at all. I play very few games - Fallout, TES, Paradox grand strategy, Battlefield, and Civ. These games are all I need to enjoy myself on any given day.   Unlike some people, like you, I have replayed all of these game several times over. With each play through, I realize the same emotions I felt the first day I got the game. I waited 6 years for Fallout 4 and for it to be announced 5 months before its release is unbelievable. I believe that the wait for Fallout 4 has made it all the better for me. Honestly, I think I will find it better then Fallout 3 because I've waited so long for it. I'll be at the store in November and I'll buy it then. And I'll probably play through 5 characters over the next few years.   TL;DR Fallout 4 has been 6 years in the making and the wait has made it all the better. Like a vintage video game wine. And with Bethesda's games being so repeatable, I'll have no issue getting it on release."

Fallout 3 was a pretty stable launch to. Fallout: New Vegas, as much as I'm loving it, still has some wonky issues that have been there since the first day.

patientgamers,3c35do,phelan87,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:48:23 2015 UTC,True! I needed this reminder. It's been sounding really tempting to get the game on release day. In the meantime I can catch up and play through Fallout 1 & 2!

patientgamers,3c35do,rob7030,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:03:13 2015 UTC,"In my opinion games like Fallout 4 are the worst games to wait for. The cost to play ratio is marginally lower by waiting.  I had about 400 hours on my Fallout 3 save before the DLC came out. That averages out about .16 cents per hour of play.  If I were to have waited until a price drop it would have saved me maybe 5 - 10 cents per hour, while surely a savings, even at full price there are only a handful of games that can claim such value.  The Fallout series, the elder scrolls series, and now the witcher series...very few games can compare. And this is just on a single play through. Upon replays the value increases due to choices that can change outcomes.  This is why I believe that these types of games are the best to buy sooner rather than later.  Also, buying used supports retailers and not developers. We want to support devs that make games like these."

If things are released much like they were with FO3 and FONV (and the past games taken into consideration), we should see a game with an ending that allows free-play (my biggest hope). This would allow anyone to enjoy the DLCs that are shipped as alternative stories like in both FO3/NV. Mods will take a while since we have to wait for the mod-friendly program to drop and then content (even if mods appear before the program, content creation can take a while).   I plant to buy the Pip-Boy edition ASAP and play through vanilla.   ""No one has the time to play a game like this twice...""  I think you doubt the Bethesda fans."

patientgamers,3byr4k,countblah2,24,Fri Jul 3 07:15:27 2015 UTC,"Those subs rely on communities, which rely on user interest and participation.  If users aren't respected, or treated decently, they leave and set up shop elsewhere (provided there's a viable alternative).  A lot of us subscribe to more than just a couple subs.  When big subs start to fail, when users are treated poorly and begin to leave, or even mods treated poorly or aren't provided the tools or resources to do their volunteer jobs, then people leave the subs and even reddit itself.  And that has consequences for all the subs they participate in.  All the subs you care about become useless if you're the only one participating.  So, maybe in time you will see some wisdom in caring about more than just your three subs because you happen to get something out of them.  Apologies if that sounds patronizing, but it's the truth for any of us that enjoy favorite subs here."
patientgamers,3byr4k,unknownone32,5,Fri Jul 3 08:54:49 2015 UTC,No need for apologies I understand your point. That statement goes to what I stated some comments below. Don't like what is happening then just leave shop as you stated.   Nothing wrong with that happens to many sites. I already heard of voat went to check it out and seems many are already jumping ship as the servers are taxed and I couldn't check them out. Trust me when I say I have no loyalty to reddit.  I'm here because I found something that interest me. When it stops becoming interesting to me I just move on and go somewhere else. Just like in the job market if you count on me to be loyal then your going to be disappointed every time. I stay around till the interest fades then I move on to the next thing.   That's my biggest reason for not caring because I know that there is hundreds of other sites that will provide me with what I want at that time. My advise lose the loyalty you gain more by being able to move to the next thing that has your interest.
patientgamers,3byr4k,Peterowsky,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:04:05 2015 UTC,"Don't like what is happening then just leave shop as you stated.   Yeah, not everyone has that possibility. I regularly visit a few subs that don't really have an equivalent, as /r/ps3 does, and the fact that I even found anything about my interest here was honestly amazing. But now the big decisions seem to be going a weird, weird path of opression and I'm not sure if I'll find anything like what I was a part of for so long.  We want to keep what little ground we have, and because we can't easilly substitute the hubs we congregate in to discuss our interests we would rather put up a fight for it then ignore the problems or give up."

I think the issue is looking at subs like any other community in civil society.  I have a lot more loyalty to the niche subs I like and participate in than reddit.  Those subs are only as good as the users that post good content and engage in healthy discussions.  Just like in real life, if you quit a club or group (maybe a hobby club, or political club, or anything else), there might not be anything to replace it with.  So there's some incentive to work with others, or play nicely, or take a role fostering that community.  As you say, voat is slammed right now.  There really isn't a place that I'm aware of that could replace reddit at the drop of a hat, unfortunately.  Even if voat had the bandwidth, you'd still have to guarantee all the productive, engaged users here all migrated to the same place, that there were mods who didn't mind curating the sub/community for free, that the voting algorithm was secure and not exploitable, etc., etc.  I appreciate your advice.

patientgamers,3byr4k,alcalde,13,Fri Jul 3 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is they removed our beloved Victoria mid AMA without telling  anyone.    No, that's not a problem. That's nobody's business. There are strict guidelines to be followed when terminating personnel to avoid being open to lawsuits. Not telling random people on the Internet what's going on is one of them. At many companies today when they get calls listing them as references HR is only allowed to confirm employment and the dates and not give out a single comment about performance or why they left, sometimes not even whether they quit or were fired.   Whatever happened happened suddenly since there was no replacement available. 101 times out of 100 that means that the terminated individual got caught red-handed doing something wrong enough to require immediate termination. So given the speed of things, why do random people on the Internet think they're going to be informed if the company itself didn't expect it to happen.  What's worse, Victoria isn't saying why it happened (and any claim to not know why you were suddenly, immediately fired is suspect at best). She's not asking anyone to protest or get involved. In that case, it's between her and her employer and people need to respect her privacy (not something we do well on Reddit). I knew someone who worked somewhere for 15 years and got busted by security for trying to walk out the door with about $1.50 of office supplies. They brought him into a room, and him sign something, turn over his stuff, and that was that. Do you think he was proud of that or wanted to tell anyone how his career there ended? He didn't even want to go back for his last check and ended up going back at the end of the day and telling the two people he ran into that he quit rather than that he was fired and never said goodbye to anyone else.   We don't know what happened, but the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of the fact that Victoria would not want the matter publicized on Reddit. If people keep pushing and inventing conspiracy theories (/u/karmanaut apparently knows what happened and said it's not the Jesse Jackson AMA everyone's blaming it on) someone at Reddit is going to end up leaking the truth to clear their name. Then Reddit will be outraged all over again that someone spilled the beans! :-( People need to respect Victoria's privacy and let it go; it's between her and them. Asking someone why they got fired is almost as tasteless as asking them why they got divorced.   They screwed over a half dozen to a dozen AMAs that were supposed to  happen.    1) If you need to fire someone, you need to fire someone. My predecessor at my last job apparently got so fed up with out software he began yelling and smashing his keyboard against his desk, ""sending a mushroom cloud of key caps up above his cubicle"" as someone put it. Security was called and he was physically escorted from the building to protect our equipment and of course other employees. These things happen. At a school I worked at, two employees were having an affair and using empty classrooms to conduct it in. You don't issue two week notices for that nor do you inform other people what went down. Why am I the only one in the world who seems to understand that sometimes people need to be fired right away?   If they had to fire her for something serious, which I HIGHLY doubt   You have zero evidence to doubt it, yet the sudden firing with no transition in place makes it the MOST likely explanation, not the LEAST likely.    they still should have notified all the subs that rely on her for the day to  day workings.   Meh. It's just a bunch of people typing on the Internet. Countries don't crumble if Victoria disappears for one day.    It's not just that they fired her, its how they've been going  about handling Reddit from the corporate side.   And this is the story people begin using when it's pointed out to them that the Victoria outrage is ridiculous. The problem is ALL of the ""how they're handling Reddit from the corporate side"" stories are all straight out of /r/conspiracy and even more ridiculous than the Victoria matter.    They even reopened r/pics by removing mod powers from the mods.    Good! That's exactly what I recommended somewhere that they do and what I would have done immediately. ""To protest unilateral actions, we're going to unilaterally shut down subreddits!"" Hmmm.... Mods are just kids on the Internet; they're not employees. Their mod status comes at the whim of Reddit. When they abuse those privileges (and yes, it's a privilege) those powers need to be taken away and given to someone who is willing to do the job. It's no different than those marriage license clerks who are shutting their doors rather than issue same-sex marriage licenses. If you don't want to do your job, quit. You can't hold everyone else hostage. You don't want to mod - then quit and let someone else step up and do it."

That's exactly what I recommended somewhere that they do and what I would have done immediately.    /r/pics doesn't belong to reddit though. Neither does /r/iAMA. These subs were started, run by, and maintained through the community. They had no right to take their powers off and steal their voice.

So instead of assuming some grave, sudden fault on the part of Victoria it's much more plausible to assume we've got a CEO on a powertrip, ignoring the consequences on the good proceedings of the site... as usual.   Their mod status comes at the whim of Reddit. When they abuse those privileges (and yes, it's a privilege) those powers need to be taken away and given to someone who is willing to do the job.

Like, imagine if this is over something private/horrible? (Given how quickly Victoria was let go, it could be.)

I guess the charge was lead by karmanaut, the lead mod of IAMA only partly due to victorias release. Before all of this there was too much abuse of the mods by the admins. As volunteers running some pretty massive forums for this place, they got no help with actual problems, the website itself is outdated and ignored (despite free user submitted updates) and when the mods do get involved, its heavy handed censoring of people or entire subs (see: fph). Victoria was one of the only admins actively engaged in the success of a sub. She brought in huge name people to talk to us regular folk, was always on call to help the mods as needed, and handled problems like a champ. Everyone agrees that its not our business why she was let go. It was the lack of consideration AGAIN for the mods. They didnt have a backup in place, they assumed there would be a shitstorm, crazy scheduling issues, and problems with the celebrities, but they basically said ""fuck it. Let the mods figure it out. Who cares if its bad, theyre free labor"". Its about a continual disregard for the effort mods and users put in to running their website for them, for free."

patientgamers,3byr4k,Occamslaser,11,Fri Jul 3 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"Simple, they don't believe the loudest voices really are the community. They think that 160 million uniques trumps all the drama and histrionic shrieking, and in some ways, and up to a point, they are right. Working to eliminate things like fph and generally smoothing the harder edges off reddit is not going to hurt that large number all that much, no matter how hard the mob bays. BUT, they've handled it badly. Too much, too fast; poor communication; allowing the perception of admin arrogance to permeate the site; allowing the impression that the admin team is completely out of touch with the user base to grow; the none-too-subtle approaches to generating revenue streams with zero regard to what users might think; and now the firing of their most prominent and appreciated employee over what is looking like that employees (Victoria's) astute objections to overt attempts to harmfully monetize the AMA system - arguably the cornerstone of reddits success.   There's no great conspiracy, no clever behind the scenes moves, just good old fashioned incompetent leadership. Arrogant, short-sighted, and clueless. Slowly strangling the golden goose in a misguided attempt to get more eggs out, whilst wrecking the moral and motivation of the admin and employee team. And  I have no great insight into the mod system, but it seems to be ten times worse for them. I vigorously object to the cries of 'SJW', and a lot of the rabid and disturbing trolling, BUT - Ellen Pao is a terrible CEO, completely lacking any leadership skills, and as a former military officer and not much else, that's about the only thing I'm an expert in. She has no Plan (or a terrible one); hasn't Briefed it to her staff properly; has no proper Control over the situation; is not Supporting her staff; and is not Evaluating the resultsof each step and action properly. She is a legitimately shitty leader and she really, really, needs to go. Reddit was being run far better by a group of under-qualified, over-worked coders with good intentions and limited resources.

I understand that it hurts the users, but it's like any strike... when the bus drivers strike, it hurts the bus riders kind of unfairly, but it's to make a point (maybe a bad analogy.. but the best I can do ;) )"
patientgamers,3byr4k,the_frickerman,6,Fri Jul 3 10:03:00 2015 UTC,"Nevertheless I think just turning subreddits privat is a spit in the face of the users, who are the ones in the end giving value to the Website.   It may look like that, but it's actually not. On the contrary.  Yes, it is the users who are giving Reddit its value, which is why many mods rightfully argued that it was their users who'd suffer if their respective subreddits went dark. But it's the mods who created and keep maintaining these subreddits that allow users to post content in the first place, and it's the mods who are struggling to do so thanks to admins and other people in charge ignoring legitimate requests and problems as long as there's enough value, i.e. fresh content.  As such, turning a large numbers of subreddits private and thus preventing users from adding said value (i.e. their content) is the only way mods have left to make themselves get heard, because value is the only thing the people in charge care about."
patientgamers,3byr4k,UglierThanMoe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"I know, and I agree. I've already mentioned in other Responses that I would've acted otherwise. For example publishing a thread with the Problem and giving a span of 1-2 days to admins to do something to solve the Situation (meanwhile I wouldn't moderate at all, for example, as an intermediate measure), and then shut down the subreddit. At least there would be a discussion of it already about it and users would have been given a heads up and an opportunity to take sides.  I always think that such decisions are better made with a cold mind. You can see just how much of a confusion there was this morning (and still is). In my opinion, acting more moderately towards the users would have been better (and maybe caused less haters towards them)."
patientgamers,3byr4k,the_frickerman,4,Fri Jul 3 13:14:05 2015 UTC,"I am not a mod in even only a single subreddit, so I can only repeat what I read in posts from various mods; and that is that the mods have been trying for years to get things to improve, but always with the same outcome -- they were ignored.  The whole Victoria-got-fired issue finally sent the mods over the edge, but it's not so much the fact that Victoria got fired, but how all this went down.  The mods of /r/IAmA weren't informed until after Victoria had already been fired, and neither the mods of other subreddits hosting AMAs, such as /r/science or /r/books, among others. This is especially crucial because Victoria usually was the only one who had direct contact with the people doing AMAs -- she was the only link between them and the mods, and that link got severed without prior warning.  That's also one of the biggest complaints the mods have: not being told shit beforehand, but instead being left to scramble and try to fix things on their own after the fact.  Another huge complaint is that the tools mods have at their disposal are pathetically inadequate. At least the mods of the big subreddits have to rely on (slightly less inadequate) third-party tools to get their job done, and the admins just don't give a fuck. As long as things work, even if only just barely, they don't care how much the mods are struggling to keep things working.  For example, I've read about one tool (don't remember which one, and can't find the link anymore -- sorry) that happens to be open source, which allowed some of the mods to improve it themselves. Yet the admins are ignoring any and all requests to implement the improved version, leaving the mods stuck with the old and broken one ... since 2013, when that tool got fixed by the mods.  Sadly, users also tend to not give a fuck as long as things are working, even if they're being told how much it sucks for the mods. As such, support from the users is practically non-existent. This is even understandable to some degree, because you simply expect things to work as user and not that you have to help (by supporting the mods) to keep things from breaking down.  That /r/IAmA had to turn private wasn't an act of protest, but simply a necessity. The whole firing-Victoria-without-telling-anyone left the mods there hanging, unable to continue normal operations. The only viable conclusion was to turn the subreddit private until they can work out how to fix this mess. The same also applies to various other subreddits hosting AMAs, which in turn led to more and more subreddits to show not only their solidarity but also to protest against these ongoing problems by going dark as well.  You really can't blame anyone else for this whole mess but the admins and other people in charge who are taking mods as a given, counting on and basically exploiting their passion for their respective subreddits to keep working despite all the problems  they have to deal with on a daily basis.  Edit: Obligatory typo- and grammar-fixing."

patientgamers,3byr4k,Pteraspidomorphi,2,Fri Jul 3 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"as as user, I support the blackout fully.  I'm sick of the non transparency, the continuous hijinks and BS in IAmA, and the slow loss of control from the user base.  I feel like reddit is slowly going against everything it and it's users have historically stood for.  It's a hard thing to face because there is no where else that even compares to reddit in sheer scope, it's astonishing.  But if we continue like this how long until the users lose all control? How much watchdoging do you want or need? How much search filtering?   The ""front page of the internet"" needs to also be the most free and open to any and all discussion of any ideas, even if they're not pleasant or are confrontational.  We all deserve our voice."
patientgamers,3byr4k,the_frickerman,3,Fri Jul 3 14:34:01 2015 UTC,"Nevertheless I think just turning subreddits privat is a spit in the face of the users, who are the ones in the end giving value to the Website.   Put yourself in the shoes of the moderators here. Moderators are at the bottom of the ""service chain"". They are not being paid like admins, and they aren't here just to laze around like normal users; Instead, they are providing their time and hard work in exchange for nothing. All they ask is for some technological support and respect from the parent company, and the parent company failed to provide that. Generally speaking, the moderators are on the side of the community; what they're doing, they're ultimately doing so the users can have a good time on reddit; they have no financial stake affecting their decisions. So you should be patient with them!"
patientgamers,3byr4k,freakame,3,Fri Jul 3 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"This goes for u/freakame as well. I do understand what you're saying. I empathyse with the mods, and that's why I wrote the first part of the message. I just wonder if there could have been a more moderate Approach to this other than just shutting down the subreddits without notice.  Yeah, we can pretty much compare this to a regular business' strike, as mods are volunteers. (this I recall again that I didn't personally know, and it has struck me quite hard).  tl;dr: Although I'm with the mods with their battle against the Company I don't entirely agree with their methods."

While my PC is shit and I expected the game to not run that well on it, it's still sad just how bad the PC port was.  (That being said I put 65 hours into it, so I got my money's worth out of it and I'll certainly go back when it's fixed.)  I actually regret not pre-ordering Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. The dev was ridiculously open about the process of building the game and it was known just how good it was going to be. Plus the 33% off for original BoI owners. I did get it last Holiday sale for the same 33% off and it was worth it, though, I just regret waiting that long.  I was going to wait for GTA V to hit $15, but after the Summer sale mess (removing the base game from the sale page and being on the front page despite no increased discount), I won't get it until it's $10."

I got Inquisition a few days after it came out and I had no regrets, though I was playing with a controller so I didn't run into the weird keyboard/mouse controls.

patientgamers,3c0dvd,hellafun,10,Fri Jul 3 22:20:12 2015 UTC,"The combat was always the lone blemish in the Uncharted series for me too but I liked the rest of the game play and the story. Tomb Raider is a better action/adventure game IMO but the enemies are pretty much the same thing: henchman. I don't think it is really the test of time, just uninteresting combat. The bow in Tomb Raider kicks it up a notch though whereas in Uncharted you are stuck with guns.  The first Assassin's Creed is the only game that comes to mind. I skipped that clunky piece of shit and started the series at ACII which is so much better."
patientgamers,3c0dvd,pizzacourier,2,Fri Jul 3 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"I contend that ACII + Brotherhood + Revelations is the best of the entire series, with Revelations being the capstone that changes it from ""pretty good"" to ""amazing"".

However, I am not enjoying it as much as I thought I would. The missions largely involve moving from once place to another, either really slowly or across half the friggin desert. I expected it to have some Rockstar qualities but wasn't expecting GTA with a cowboy hat on.  I do enjoy the atmosphere and will probably sit back down to finish it at some point (because who doesn't secretly want to be a cowboy), but for me this was a perfect example of games that don't age well.   Games such as Dishonored, Just Cause, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Dying Light, etc. have all upped my standards for movement in games and now I feel like a mere mortal going back to more realistic games.

patientgamers,3c0dvd,Orionmcdonald,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fair call that you mention how the missions were largely involving moving from one place to another. Personally, I loved the atmosphere and the trekking across the desert on horseback and only used the fast travel a handful of times on my first playthrough since I was so fully immersed in the Wild West environment. But I can see how the missions which are entirely dedicated to riding alongside another character with exposition and dialogue would not hold up.   You've listed some really great sandbox titles there where the player has an enormous variety of tools and options to choose from. What did you think of Dishonored?"
patientgamers,3c0dvd,dariuse1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"Agree with you bud.

Bethesda are the masters of immersive universes and Arkane do a brilliant job at cramming all that info and freedom into a game that could be completed in one night if you went for it.

The hex grid in Civ5 alone is the biggest improvement in gameplay, but the content in Civ4 (with all the expansions) far exceeds 5. I'd encourage you to watch some footage to see the differences in play style (in 5 you basically have to build tall, but in 4 you more or less need to build wide, though tall is an option depending on certain factors). If you're interested, with how cheap it gets during sales I'd say go for it the next time it's a few bucks."
patientgamers,3c2gca,triedtostayaway,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"I like civ IV a lot more than V. To me civ IV felt like managing an empire, V feels like micromanaging all your units so they don't get all jammed up.  Some people hate the ""stack of doom"" strategy, but to me that's part of the beauty of civ IV: if you can manage an empire well enough to create and maintain a giant military you should stomp all over people who have no defences, you shouldn't be spending decades slowly moving units around because they can't get past each other.  Civ IV also has the great fantasy mod Fall From Heaven which had lots of unique and awesome civilians that all play very differently to each other.  In short: get Civ IV, it should be really cheap now."
patientgamers,3c2gca,DrStalker,0,Sun Jul 5 05:44:02 2015 UTC,Civ V is basically Civ IV with a facelift; if you have the complete edition of Civ V then there's really no reason to get Civ IV if there is no specific mod that you want to play.

The gameplay was smooth, and though it's definitely a power fantasy, you never really felt like you were completely overpowered. This is in part because I started my first playthrough in Hard Mode, and ended up having to fight tooth, nail and claw to kill anything even remotely larger than a bandit.

The price of the BTA which gets you the base game is probably starting to get a little expensive for what is the base game and a number of small DLC unless you are pretty sure you will not want the season pass (which is included with the GOTY version of the game).  You'll probably be able to pick up the GOTY version of the game from a normal retailer on sale for about this price or not much more next time it's on sale. This will have more (and better) actual game content.  If you had gotten into the BTA tier a few dollars cheaper it would be easier to recommend, but right now... it's not like it offers bad value, it obviously doesn't but it isn't necessarily the best way to go.  The top tier is still pretty good if you just want to get everything the series has to offer from the first two games, but if you think you'll only play Borderlands 2 anyway, I would say just get Borderlands 2 GOTY on sale elsewhere sometime and make do with that. I don't think you'll be missing much."
patientgamers,3by69j,0rangie,3,Fri Jul 3 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"Well, if I was you my first order of business would be to upgrade my HDD. A 1tb 2.5 sata disk should not be that expensive these days.   You are in luck with Metal Gear, as IV is pretty cheap these days and V is just around the corner for the PS3. Can't tell on most of the other games you mentioned since I mostly play JRPGs. If you want some more hidden gems I recommend checking out Metal Jesus PS3 hidden gems videos on the subject, they might clue you into getting some interesting games for the console: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorfFQ9eM6s"
patientgamers,3by69j,Teh_akod,2,Fri Jul 3 06:01:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really should.  I wouldn't know how to transer the data from one drive to the other.  But that's what Google is for I suppose.   Can I get away with only playing MGS4?  I've read that it's recommened to play the previous games."
patientgamers,3by69j,mint_sun,2,Fri Jul 3 06:07:14 2015 UTC,"Not who you were replying to but I thought I'd chime in here. I haven't actually played MGS4 yet (no PS3 D:) but the timeline of the series is 3>Peace Walker>Ground Zeroes>5>MG1>MG2>1>2>4(>Rising). Note that you also play as a different character also named Snake for 3 through Phantom Pain (known as Big Boss, alternatively). This pretty much means that you can get away with playing 4 without playing 3, if you so choose, but 4 will definitely have story threads that you won't understand without playing 1 and 2. If anyone else also wants attest to MGS4 needing or not needing any background knowledge then that would be cool. Granted, I do know a few people who have only played 4 and really enjoyed it."
patientgamers,3by69j,Teh_akod,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:14:12 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I think I'm gonna put the Metal Gear Solid games aside until I upgrade to a bigger hard drive.
patientgamers,3by69j,1nf,2,Fri Jul 3 07:34:30 2015 UTC,"I strongly suggest playing the previous games before. While chronological can be done, I do believe that playing the ""Metal Gear Solid"" series (1,2,3, Peace Walker,4) is the way to go due to the improvement of gameplay mechanics in the games. You can get the first one over the PSN and the rest on either the HD collection or the Legacy collection.   Would not playing them make MGS4 not as fun? The game stands on its own on how amazing it can be but it would be be a disservice if you don't play the previous ones first. And some plotlines would be really weird, specially considering how convoluted the writing of these games can be."

patientgamers,3by69j,1nf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"If you want something more action oriented how about Kindgom Hearts? There's plenty JRPG flavor with some amazing action and a story to go along. Get the remasters, thats like 4 games and a half between the two remasters.   Resonance of Fate is another one that is very good stilysh JRPG. Its part The Matrix crazy gun scenes mix with JRPG goodness.   Another excellent one is Ni No Kuni. While it is turn based, its active enough that you don't notice it at all. Its charming, like a Studio Ghibli movie and its one of the best games in the console. You might want to get this one physical, its enormous with a huge world and story to go along."
patientgamers,3by69j,Teh_akod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:00:01 2015 UTC,I liked the Final Fantasy 7/8/9. Are there JRPGs that have the same kind of gameplay and story? Where you get to explore open worlds but at the same time there's a large story behind? Thanks.
patientgamers,3by69j,Captain_Grizzly,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:57:03 2015 UTC,"Well, the Tales Of series has these grand stories that are somewhat similar to Final Fantasy. The gameplay is not as turn based but more action RPG-ish. Tales Of Zesteria looks like it will have a huge world to explore, so you could look into that.   Also the previously mentioned Ni No Kuni has an amazing and vast world that is worth checking out. You should totally consider it if you like games like this, plus the charm of this game just hook you in."

patientgamers,3busvd,Liambp,159,Thu Jul 2 09:25:24 2015 UTC,The best thing about upgrading hardware is playing older games at max settings. In particular playing games that you've already played a hundred times just so you can see them at another level of graphical quality.
patientgamers,3busvd,LazyGit,44,Thu Jul 2 10:54:03 2015 UTC,"Back in the day this was especially awesome.  I remember playing some turn-based civil war game at my friends house on a monitor with 8 colors (CGA, EGA, I can't remember) and then his mom got a new computer.  We installed the same game and went to the settings and saw that we could set the resolution to 1024x768.  It was amazing.  So much more detail.    We played for a few days like that then I said ""let's go back to the old way to compare"", and that's when we noticed the option under CGA/EGA there was this new setting for VGA.  All of the sudden our eyes were melted by the glory of 256 colors and I've been chasing that high ever since."

patientgamers,3busvd,LazyGit,10,Thu Jul 2 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"I had distinct issues with Diablo when we switched from a curved screen to a flat screen (just the screen, mind you -- the monitor was still gigantic but the screen was now flat). The edges looked warped as hell because it wasn't being projected onto the curved surface anymore, but the settings confirmed: it was just our brains being unable to readjust after having to compensate for the curves for so long.  Then we got LoD and upgraded to (I think) 800x600 resolution, which just seemed like an insane amount of screen real estate, to the point they added totally unnecessary filigree to parts of the UI to take up space."

I'm a patient gamer because in the last couple of years games have become unstable on release, and because I absolutely hate to reinstall games for DLC, especially when it turns out to be bad DLC. As a result, hardware upgrade or not, I'm waiting for that GOTY version.  I am right now running an integrated graphics card because my HD 6870 died a month ago, so I am kind of forced to be patient (which I don't mind, there are a ton of great games released between 98 and 2006 and a lot of modern indies). I'll probably build a new gaming PC before going to University which is in 2 years, but I am quite confident that I won't dive into 2017's newest titles."

I can afford to buy a AAA title--and even new parts if I have to--but the buggy games, incomplete releases, and massive game changing DLC really make it unattractive to buy new games. You can buy a new game (60 dollars) plus a season pass (15 dollars) and beta test the game and DLC or you can wait 2 years and pay 15 dollars to get the full game, DLC, all sorts of sweet mods, and if you need to upgrade your hardware it's even cheaper at that stage. For example, The last game I bought full price on release day was Dark Souls 2 for the PC and it's clear that I should have waited to get all the DLC and the visual upgrades for a fraction of the cost that I paid for everything."

I just finished Age of Empires 2 yesterday (though I'll come back with the expansion), six hours into System Shock 2 (love it) and bought Planescape Torment (though I don't feel like diving into it right now), These are for 1999. When it comes to 2000, I plan to get Deus Ex, Thief 2, Soldier of Fortune, maybe Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate 2, not sure about these two, and Red Alert 2 if I feel like replaying it (finished it years ago). Haven't sorted the rest of the years out yet, but I'm quite excited. Much hype for 2004.   I'm mostly playing PC Classics or great underrated games. Figured our it's a good way to gain some new perspective on gaming in general as well as to keep me occupied until I get a second hand  PS3 later this summer and even after that.   I'm also playing through a couple of series I missed. Just started with Half-Life because I have only played the original. Finished the expansions and I'm really excited for the second title and the episodes. Couldn't get into Thief 1, so I'm going to give Thief 2 a go. I really want to play Deadly Shadows.

I recommend installing the mod to remove loading screens, Thief 3 Gold I think it's called.  Deus Ex is also really great.

The more time has passed, the more I rationalize it as, 'well, they probably won't ever drop the price. Plus they hold their value well. Maybe I can play it for a while and resell it.'   I've only ended up buying two (EDIT: Three, forgot about Mario Kart) at near full price, at least. Plus they're incredibly fun, so I don't feel too bad about it (LoZ: Wind Waker and Splatoon).

I got my Wii U for $90, along with Mario Kart and Wind Waker HD, by selling and trading in some rare-ish games I had in storage -- and they were all things I'd bought at a discounted price in the first place. So score one for physical releases and patient gaming!  If you're curious, the biggest deals I had were:   Metal Gear: Twin Snakes (Gamecube) - bought for $20, traded Final Fantasy 7 (PS1) - bought for $20 new (at a Blockbuster, no less), traded Secret of Mana (SNES) - bought for $3 at a pawn shop, traded Illusion of Gaia (SNES) - bought for $3 at a pawn shop, traded Donkey Kong Country 2 & 3 (SNES) - bought for $3 each at a pawn shop, traded Resident Evil 4 (Gamecube) - bought for $20, traded Yoshi's Island (SNES) - bought for $5 at a pawn shop, sold for $40 Wind Waker (Gamecube) - bought for $20, sold for $40 Eternal Darkness (Gamecube) - bought for $20, sold for $40   On an unrelated note, I bought a rough former rental copy of Megaman X3 (SNES) at that same pawn shop for $5 and sold it for $75 after I played it for a while.

patientgamers,3busvd,untildeath,5,Thu Jul 2 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"Instances like Arkham Knight are why I haven't felt the incentive to momentarily jump earlier on games after a hardware upgrade. Probably would if games weren't broken when initially released, and they didn't have a a bunch of DLCs pushing the cost of the game to $100 if I want the complete version.  Modding games like Skyrim is what I turn to when I want to test new hardware to see how texture packs and enbs I couldn't run before handle."
patientgamers,3busvd,graywolfe42,3,Mon Jul 6 09:29:34 2015 UTC,"The other thing is that they pump up the length of games now with so much filler that, by the time I complete the game, the last thing on my mind is more of it via DLC."
patientgamers,3busvd,skyturnedred,5,Thu Jul 2 11:21:44 2015 UTC,Only a little bit. I built a new gaming PC(was previously gaming on a laptop not meant for gaming) and I did pay full price for GTAV PC since it had just come out. Other then that though I already had a pretty large backlog of nice games to play through and I picked up a few I've been waiting for during the summer sale.
patientgamers,3busvd,snoozieboi,3,Thu Jul 2 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"My upgrades are just as patient as my game purchases. I buy hardware that is a few years old (used if I can) than can run the games I currently can't. My GTX470 can still handle pretty much anything I want (at the quality level I'm okay with), but my CPU is in dire need of upgrading. But since that requires a new motherboard, RAM and all that jazz, I'm holding off for now."
patientgamers,3busvd,Dascandy,4,Thu Jul 2 11:31:28 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I play the games because I want to play them. Kinda like how people still read books? If it's a classic I'm going to play it eventually.   My problem is that dominating games have no ending since they are multiplayer games."

My computer isn't in any way weak - should be able to play any current game at high settings - but I just don't like those games so I'm not buying them. The games I do like - Big Pharma, Terraria, Minecraft, Prison Architect, Castle Story, Locomotion, ... - aren't must-buy-now games as much, nor the typical AAA game cycle of loads of interest for a few months and a dead wasteland after that.  Heck, the AAA games that I do like seem to have strong support 5 years after release, so it's not like I'm selecting against AAA in particular...

patientgamers,3busvd,EssBen,3,Thu Jul 2 12:41:22 2015 UTC,"Not really, it's not about the hardware. It's about the money first, I can buy one new release of a half dozen or more slightly older games that are new to me. However it's also about stability, modding, and communities. Right now the norm is for games to be released broken,  not buggy, just plain broken. If you wait six months to a year you'll be able to play just fine with patches, or know it was never fixed and therefore isn't worth getting. The mod scene also takes time to develop, again in six months to a year you'll be seeing polished, interesting mods that you won't see at release."

I love that PC games pretty much always allow you to do that"
patientgamers,3busvd,applebeesplatters,2,Thu Jul 2 15:12:55 2015 UTC,I double down on patient gaming because laptops and computers don't come cheap.
patientgamers,3busvd,AdamTheChao,2,Thu Jul 2 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"Nope, because I'm not a patient gamer by decision, but because I'm a lazy bum who prefers to play MMOs all day instead of ""working"" on his backlog. I have a GTX970 and never played half the games in my steam library."

I may splurge on a new game every now and then depending on what it is. Like I have Witcher 3, plan on getting fallout 4.... but everything else I'd pretty old on my list and I wait for sales, humble bundles etc.   AAA games are pretty unappealing and hand holdy anyway."
patientgamers,3busvd,thabe331,2,Thu Jul 2 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's only the case because I'm always upgrading for some particular game, and then I go back and play a few more recent games that I kinda wanted to play soon that are either multiplayer focused or just very highly rated. Especially if they're a bit more ""Spectacle"" focused games. Like Arkham Knight, only Arkham Knight turned out buggy and I can't think of a similar example."
patientgamers,3busvd,stone500,2,Thu Jul 2 14:08:26 2015 UTC,"Barely.  During the last sales I got witcher 2, and since my rig was unable to decently play a $2 game even at lowest settings, decided to update.  Got 1 recent title (Witcher 3) to ""test the rig"", but there are so many older games I couldn't run properly (can it run crysis? Now it can!) that by the time I can catch up all those shiny new games will be old and cheap."

I always held that the maximum I'm willing to pay in most cases for a game is around 40 dollars. Right now with my PS4 I am willing to pay a little more than that for new games compared to what I'm willing to pay for a ps3"
patientgamers,3busvd,Auutumnal,2,Thu Jul 2 14:33:54 2015 UTC,"I've never been a patient gamer exclusively.  Once in a while I'll still pre-order games, if there's good incentive to.  For example, I pre-ordered the limited edition of Arkham Knight because WalMart.com had it on sale for like, $63.  I preordered Fallout 4 limited edition because it's selling out everywhere.  I preordered MGS5 limited edition because I'm a sucker for anything MGS, and it was also selling out everywhere.  As far as my hardware, when I upgrade my PC then I'll usually buy a game or two so I can test out my new rig.  When I upgraded to a GTX970, I bought Far Cry 4 as soon as I saw a sale price on it (which in my case was $40 on Amazon).  I'd say I probably still do patient gaming about 60-70% of the time, but I'm not afraid to jump into something new once in a while."
patientgamers,3busvd,Tayark,2,Thu Jul 2 15:08:18 2015 UTC,"Nope.   Upgraded to a top-of-the-line gaming laptop almost a year ago because my old laptop died and I decided it'd be more efficient to get a great laptop than a great desktop and an okay laptop.  Anyway. Buying a new laptop didn't do anything to my Steam backlog, so I'm still chugging through those. Having a perpetual backlog of 30+ games is a real good motivator to not spend money on brand-new games, regardless of my hardware.  Nintendo games are the exception. The big first-party titles hold their price for a ludicrously long time compared to every other system (even used - there are used GameCube games that are worth $50 and up), so I don't think twice about picking up a new PokÃ©mon, Smash Bros, or Zelda at full price.  Almost sprung for The Witcher 3, though."
patientgamers,3busvd,anxious_anatomist,2,Thu Jul 2 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"Not at all, in fact I find I'm usually all stoked to boot up an infocom game or a dosbox one to see if it runs well :D"

patientgamers,3busvd,NekoiNemo,2,Thu Jul 2 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"No. There are plenty of ""old"" games that need medium-high end hardware. Crysis, Call of Pripyat with mods, Skyrim with mods etc.  Sure I test my hardware too with newest titles but that only lasts for couple of days and then I start thinking about games that I havent played."
patientgamers,3busvd,SarcasticOptimist,2,Thu Jul 2 15:56:06 2015 UTC,"Being (primarily) a console gamer, I actually do the opposite. Whenever I get a new system I will buy a few of the big releases that I missed and then fill in the rest with early/launch titles that sell for practically nothing. That way I build an instant library of games that will keep me from getting bored for about the price of one new game. For example, when I got my PS3 in late 2010 some of the first games I got were MotorStorm, Resistance, and Battlefield: Bad Company because each was around $5."

patientgamers,3busvd,Spiridios,2,Thu Jul 2 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"You can test your hardware with games that came out three to six months ago that have been marked down or are on sale. You spent extra for quality PC hardware. This is where you recoup that expense. This is how being a PC gamer remains affordable for people who know what they're doing.  That said, it never hurts to pick up a video card/game bundle. A month ago for example, you could get Witcher 3 and Arkham Knight with a GTX970. If you're patient, there's always deals like that a couple of times a year.  Speaking of Arkham Knight, there hasn't been a Triple-A PC Port in at least the last year that was stable at launch.  Being a patient gamer means buying stable games cheap instead of overpriced glitch fests at launch."
patientgamers,3busvd,dragossk,2,Thu Jul 2 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"I spent a lot on a new system when the windforce GTX780Ti came out a year or two ago. Got an i7 4770k, 4x SLI capable motherboard, 500GB SSD, fast ram etc.  I still won't pay more than $5 for a video game."
patientgamers,3busvd,PrivilegeCheckmate,2,Thu Jul 2 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty patient with my hardware, and I usually go the other way around: I buy new hardware because I wasn't patient in buying a new game and now I need some more horsepower."

For games I have a couple friends who just buy everything so I generally get a chance to know if I need it now now now(Skyrim, Fallout NV) can just wait(everything else) . There is one exception; I buy the latest Zelda the day it comes out, generally. The only one I didn't was Skyward Sword and that was because my kid was almost here. Every decade or so that means I have to be impatient with a console as well but it's my favorite series so that's OK."

It's become a family joke really, where I'll extol the strengths of my Titan GPU as I launch games such as Solitaire after all the fuss I'd made previously about wanting (NEEDING!) to play the latest-and-greatest game ever, hence justifying the rig I'd chosen.  Eventually, the kit gets the exercise it needs and deserves, but when it's new I admit I get a sudden urge to play the equivalent of 8-bit pixel games or games that are so old they'll barely run on it."

Yeah, I could get some new games to really test my hardware but there are so many games in my steam inventory that I just couldn't run on my laptop (even if they came out before I bought my laptop. it was shitty). Honestly, so few new games have caught my interest as I see few improvements over the older versions I already own or played. Why pay 30-50 dollars for a rehash of a game I already own? I still pick up games on sale occasionally but only ones that have been on my list for a while (steam sale I picked up 3 things- one of which I'd been waiting on a price drop and the other two because they seemed interesting and were under 5 dollars).   It's not about not being able to run the game- it's about being able to enjoy what's available to me."
patientgamers,3busvd,AngeloPappas,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"For me being a patient gamer is more about letting time filter out the truly good games, since I have limited time to play.

I paid $60 for ZombiU, for instance, and I wouldn't really recommend even paying $20 for ZombiU. Then again, for my PS4, pretty much everything I have is a game that was also on PS3 and for most of them I didn't pay full price. For that realm, I tend to wait for ""Platinum Edition"" type releases. I'd rather wait and pay like $20 or $30 to get the game with all of the DLC on disc someday than pay $60 to get the vanilla version. Nintendo is the only case where I'm rarely patient, because those games rarely get expanded rereleases and if anything they go up in price more often than they go down."
patientgamers,3busvd,sli,0,Thu Jul 2 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Nah, I don't.  I usually buy consoles near the end of their commercial life cycle, since you get to pick the most reliable revisions for a reasonable price and get the best games for cheap.

It has the ""improved"" versions of all the games, however, it DOES NOT include the first Metal Gear Solid game. To my knowledge, there is not an HD edition of the first game, although the gameplay still holds up rather well.  That said, I'd recommend looking into The Twin Snakes edition, which was the Gamecube remake of the PS1 game, with a modern camera and some other features.   However, per Sean Eyestone of Kojima Productions:   That was a remake made by Silicone Knights. We supervised it but we didnât create it directly and we wanted to make sure that everything in the HD Collection was canon. Everything that goes into there is something created directly by Kojima Productions and Kojima himself. So that is the reason why Twin Snakes was not included in HD Collection.   edit: a bit more info on Eurogamer."
patientgamers,3bvofj,SpacePirate,4,Thu Jul 2 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"Everything in Twin Snakes that matters is canon. There's just a few funny bits, like a Mario bobble head in an office, and one of the characters scanning your memory card and name dropping whatever game saves it sees on there.  ie the character started talking about Zelda, cuz I had a Zelda save on my card."

Only 2, 3, and Peace Walker.   I'd suggest the Legacy Edition which also includes MGS1 and 4, as well as the old gameboy/snes (don't know on which plattform) games."
patientgamers,3bvofj,tambogaming,10,Fri Jul 3 07:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah the box set you are talking about, The Legacy Collection, is precisely what you should go with. I'd recommend starting from the first MGS and go in numerical order from then. If you don't want to play a PS1 game  then start from MGS 3, then PeaceWalker, Ground Zeroes, and finally Phantom Pain as these games all star the same character. Let me reiterate, though, that to get the most out of the games start with MGS. Well, the third game has the original MG1 and 2 games as well but I realize a lot of people would be put off by them.  Also, a lot of people have pissed themselves in this series."
patientgamers,3bvofj,ShellWithMe,8,Thu Jul 2 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"You deff have to play them in release order. Get the HD collection and decide between playing original MGS1 for the PlayStation first (its on the PSN store) or play the GameCube remake ""Twin Snakes"" (its a little hard to find so you can use an emulator). Either way you need to play them in order because you wont understand whats going on if you just jump in randomly. Also don't start at MGS3 even though its the beginning of the timeline and best game in the series, you wont care enough about whats going on because you wont know who some of the characters turn into and you wont understand the nods to the future events of the series. Either way Metal Gear Solis is an amazing series and you owe it to yourself to play it."
patientgamers,3bvofj,mint_sun,5,Thu Jul 2 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"I bought the legacy collection a few months back and beat mgs on psx, it's a dl code for PS3 that you get with the legacy collection, and the story and gameplay still holds up so I'm excited to move forward with it. You definitely need to get the legacy collection or get mgs4, mgs hd collection and buy mgs 1 on psn. Metal gear rising revengance is a spin off of mgs 4 and mgs portable ops is set in between mgs 3 and peace walker. Both those two games aren't necessary but add to the story.  The best way to play the series is order of release dates, how Kojima intended it. You don't need to play metal gear 1 and 2 which are the games before metal gear solid but at least read plot summaries of the two because metal gear solid takes elements from those two games.  Have fun and pm me if you have questions. I haven't beaten the entire series but I have friends who have and they've told me everything a beginner needs to know so I can share more information if you need it."
patientgamers,3bvofj,TGiddy,3,Thu Jul 2 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has already said, release order on the Legacy Collection is probably the best. Keep in mind that though both main characters are named Snake, one is Solid Snake (MG1, MG2, 1, 2, and 4) and the other is eventually known as Big Boss (3, PW, GZ, 5; referenced in every other game). It'll definitely start making sense when you're playing them. Also, it seems like a lot of people forget this, but Peace Walker was a PSP game ported to consoles. It is still a really, really great game, but it definitely feels different than the others.  The great thing about this series is that each MGS game feels different enough from its predecessor so as to make the experience feel fresh each time you play. The game mechanics do get better as the series goes on, but each game still feels rather unique and captures its own tone. Hope you enjoy them."
patientgamers,3bvofj,Moocaws,2,Fri Jul 3 07:24:05 2015 UTC,I bought the HD collection on PS store for cheap last month but it's been very hard to get into. The controls in MGS 2 are really weird and doesn't seem natural to me. I'm surprised I've never played these games when I was younger but now that I want to get into the series I feel like it's aged pretty badly. Is it just me? Should I keep playing through and does the game get better? I'm still on the boat and constantly getting spotted because of the ridiculous controls.
patientgamers,3bvofj,Monteitoro,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:09:59 2015 UTC,"IMO you should try MGS1 first, which you can get off the PS Store.

Check out www.howlongtobeat.com and focus on the shortest ones first and complete your single player games.

patientgamers,3bwrcd,rarelypost,2,Fri Jul 3 08:27:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that feeling but once you miss out on a few games you get used to it.  If you have friends who pressure you into buying new games, see if you can borrow it from them when they're through and you can lend them some of yours to play as a trade off.  You could also look into something like Gamefly, which will keep your focus on one or two games at a time."
patientgamers,3bwrcd,snowbell55,3,Thu Jul 2 21:42:26 2015 UTC,"That's a nice list of titles you have there. Lots of fun to be had in them.   1 - Decide what you want to play and what you don't. You probably bought the games for a reason, so try and figure out what the reason was (was it you like the look of the game, or maybe it was cheap, or maybe a friend had it and you wanted to play with them etc) and go from there. Point is there was something that you wanted, so try to rediscover that in order to rekindle some anticipation and appreciation for the game.  2 - This one is really important. Stop buying other games. For me at least, there's a sort of process that makes me think ""ooh shiny"" when I want a game, then I tend to ignore it later, and that ends up leaving me with lots of untouched titles. You could even sell some of those games (the newer ones) and buy them back for cheaper later on to save some money. I've set a target of having to finish 5 games before I can buy a new one (I have a big backlog) and am also trying to avoid buying games till June next year. Probably won't succeed with the latter but if I can slow down new purchases it'll help.  3 - Decide how much time you want to dedicate to playing the games, and work towards that. One suggestion I've seen is to test play for an hour and see if you like it: if you don't then move forwards. It might be finishing the SP campaign, or putting in 5 hours, or something different, but decide what your target is and work towards it.   4 - Use tools. Another poster mentioned HowLongToBeat which is a great one. I like Backloggery too, and use it  It'll make it easier to track your progress, and make you feel like you're actually accomplishing something which will help you focus on beating more games. It also has a really nice randomizer tool that I use to choose a new game which keeps things fresh and interesting. As of late it's been fun kind wondering what game will get chosen next.   5 - Play. As in, set aside a certain amount of time on the games you want to play. For example, if you have 2 hours a day, play the backlog game for 1 hour, and if it's really not pulling you in then change to an MP game or something you enjoy. Moving away from playing the MP / ""endless"" games is important though.   6 - Focus. Focus on doing 1 game at a time (or alternatively, 1 per system). I've found for me this helps me both remember the story, stay interested in the title, and also make more progress since I'm not switching around between titles.   Good luck, and hope you can cut down on the backlog. Hope this helps some."

Most Castlevania games have a loose connection with each other and involve a family called the Belmonts who have to defeat Dracula after making their way through his castle.  Lords of Shadow is set before Dracula came about and just features one of the original Belmonts who is fighting the Lords of Shadow.    Download the demo before you play and see if you'd be fine with the camera as it can be pretty annoying.

It's a fairly long game too; I played it for like 20 hours or so and I still was only about 75% through.  LOS2 is pretty good too, although it got hammered critically for having unnecessary stealth sections wedged into the main game, which I sort of agree with.

If you have a 360 or Xbox One controller you can just plug it in and it'll work, but you will have to configure a PS3 or PS4 controller.  The only other program you should have is one that monitors your CPU and GPU temps to make sure nothing is overheating while you play games, especially if you're building it yourself and will be doing overclocking or any other kind of tweaking.

patientgamers,3browg,Geeraff,0,Thu Jul 2 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"The upgrade being free is suspect.    I don't agree.   I think it's a calculated move to get more people on the new system early so they can set up a better app store and compatibility ecosystem than Windows 8 started with. Plus old OSes are more vulnerable to exploits with reduced support and patching, so more people on the newer system mean fewer complaints to Microsoft (assuming it works as expected)  Plus there's the PR and goodwill generated from giving away a huge product for free. As long as launch isn't a disaster like Vista, I think Microsoft will do very well for themselves."

I would look into grabbing the PC version in the next sale since any PC nowadays should be able to play it well enough with the game being 6 years old now.

patientgamers,3br732,circuitloss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:54:03 2015 UTC,Gothic 2 picks up in the immediate aftermath of the Gothic 1 story- I'd play the first if you are going to play the 2nd.
patientgamers,3br732,jakdak,3,Wed Jul 1 22:17:41 2015 UTC,G2 plays a lot better if you have already played G1. There are many points of continuity.  I would just play G1. It's not the best but if you don't like it enough to keep going you would likely not have enjoyed G2 anyway.
patientgamers,3br732,donwallo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:57:49 2015 UTC,This.  G2 is basically a direct continuation of the G1 storyline.  Play 'em both if you are going to play either.  Or just start with G1 and decide if you want to continue after completing that.

patientgamers,3br732,xtagtv,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:22 2015 UTC,"Gothic 2 is in most respects the best game. However you gain a lot by playing Gothic 1 first. If you want to know why, its a bit spoilery, but this is why.   First of all, you meet many characters in Gothic 1 that you will meet in Gothic 2. The game kind of tells you who they are (the hero goes ""Who were you again?"" and they give a little recap) but personally I feel you get a lot more out of it by fighting alongside them in the first game. You develop relationships with many characters in Gothic 1 that are continued throughout the series, and coming into the story halfway through would not give you a full picture of that relationship. However, the story in Gothic is probably certainly not the reason you play, though if you want to appreciate it the most it would be best to play 1 first.  The other reason is that halfway through Gothic 2 you get to revisit almost the entire world of Gothic 1 after it has experienced a cataclysmic event that has transformed it considerably. By playing Gothic 1 you get to know the world pretty intimately and it feels really cool to explore it again and check out what has changed in your absence. You feel like you are coming back to your old stomping grounds. If you hadn't had the experience of exploring the world in Gothic 1 I can only imagine this would not be nearly as exciting.  I will also say this, when I first heard of this series I tried starting with Gothic 2. I thought it was pretty good but eventually dropped it. I tried again later starting with Gothic 1 and this time I was enthralled throughout the entire series 1-3. The first game does have a much more interesting plot and atmosphere so it was a bit easier to become engaged even though the mechanics were clunkier. This was only like two years ago so if you can appreciate older games this series still has a lot to offer."

patientgamers,3br732,destroyermaker,2,Thu Jul 2 06:14:46 2015 UTC,"Don't install any of the big community patches for the first two games, they introduce more bugs than they fix. The third game requires a bunch of mods but the first two are pretty much good to go after installing them. There is one mod I would consider essential and a few texture packs to make things look nicer.  For the first game the essential one is the mod to remove the fps limit. The game can run at hundreds of fps no problem but for some reason is locked to 24 fps by default. See this Steam thread for details.  There are also some nice graphical mods to improve textures as the originals are a bit muddy. Look for the packs by thielhater and freddy. Game still looks pretty janky but its a bit cleaner.   For the second game, look for Vurt's texture pack, it looks really nice and is definitely a big improvement over the original. Also make sure you get the edition with the expansion pack Night of the Raven.  Most of the other mods for these games are just custom campaigns and they are almost all in German."

patientgamers,3bpj68,tambogaming,5,Wed Jul 1 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"I'm currently playing it on PC. I have a 1440p / 60 Mhz setup and know that the game is boxed at that resolution (like huge black edges). It is smooth however, not really graphic intensive in terms of gameplay so I don't mind.  Overall this is my assessment:  Cons:   Boxed in graphics and no visible upgrades for the PC version in terms of graphics and UI. Keymapping is weird and menus are laborious (Enter to skip intro video, then space bar becomes the ""enter"" key) Controlling a tank requires finesse. The mouse movement controls the orientation AND the direction of the Tank. Typically I'll orient the Tank with the mouse and then I'll exclusively use the keyboard until I need to change the view again.   Pros:   Game is an JRPG that is quite enjoyable. The story is engaging, if a little slow and its a huge part of the game (action sequences serve the story line, upgrade choices and how you fight have zero influence on how the story progresses). See it as a Telltale game with more elaborate action sequences, upgrading and no conversation choices. The game is long without being too long. You get your money's worth. Including the DLCs is nice. The action sequences, with all your different types of soldiers and the turn by turn play like chess. Although you can abuse the game mechanics easily, if you play it straight some levels are challenging. Good mix between rewarding speed vs. rewarding completionists.   Tip:  Save often!"
patientgamers,3bpj68,IBoris,3,Wed Jul 1 04:50:32 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, ""boxed in""? Are you talking about the paper fade-in border around the screen? That's a deliberate part of the game's visual style- it's meant to look like a watercolour painting."
patientgamers,3bpj68,LocutusOfBorges,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:37:34 2015 UTC,I mean a black edge that takes half the screen real estate at 1440p resolution.
patientgamers,3bpj68,IBoris,3,Wed Jul 1 14:06:34 2015 UTC,During the last Steam sales it was discounted to $4.99. Totally worth it imo.

patientgamers,3bpj68,LocutusOfBorges,2,Wed Jul 1 13:56:08 2015 UTC,The resolution improvement and included DLC are two obvious bonuses to the PC version. Another one I never see mentioned is the controls. The PS3 version has an awful dead zone on the aiming stick that makes it really irritating to aim precisely. This is a non-issue with mouse aiming (I never tried it with a PC gamepad).

patientgamers,3bnp4x,jimmy_m,8,Tue Jun 30 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"Check /r/GameDeals for any games you'd want to play. I'd recommend something like Civ V or XCOM: EU, but if you don't enjoy strategy they might not be good to recommend.  The strategy games are good since they rely on turns and you can take all the time you need to move your guys and plan your attack and don't have to rely on fast movements, which is good for your healing shoulder.  If you think you can move pretty well and won't have a problem, then there's always the big open world games that will take up a lot of time as you explore, like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Skyrim, Far Cry 3 or 4.  Sleeping Dogs is currently $7.50 on Steam.  Terraria would also be a good choice, though $7.50 isn't the greatest sale for the game right now on Steam, but a new patch just came out today."

Really you will be looking to the longer games due to the length of time you'll be help up for; anything from open-world to Unending.  My suggestions;   Minecraft Fallout (3 or NV) TES: Skyrim Diablo III FarCry 3/4 (Although this does eventually end) Animal Crossing: WW   Perhaps look into getting a 1 month subscription to a MMO (and see how far you can get while resting up).   EVE Online WoW Warcraft

Hunting the loot/gear you want is always fun to me, it is random and can take a long time, but the reward of getting it is a blast.

patientgamers,3blghw,Eogris,7,Tue Jun 30 12:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, easily. The only problem will be early game in which you'll respawn at your original spawning point (the middle of the forest area) upon death or restarting the game, which if you were exploring around half the map away leaves you with a bit of a trek to get back there. Once you've made a bed or two, those can be placed down and right-clicked (I think) set as your new respawn point."

You may want to do a little screwing with generating your own biomes for a handful of the NPCs, but that's optional.  Honestly, most NPCs are optional, really.  The object of the game is to...

I put in 83 hours according to steam before I was able to tear myself away again.  So it's quite a good game if you can get over the controls. I'm not so sure you'll end up liking it if you don't like true sandbox games though. There's no overall story arc. It's ""just"" a game where you build a home where you're safe from the monsters attacking at night, and try to get better and better gear to be able to beat all the bosses in the game. Even with 83 hours I wasn't able to fully beat all the bosses (was missing entry to a special temple in the jungle), so the game will provide endless amounts of fun, but it's not for everyone I suppose."

patientgamers,3blghw,SecondTalon,5,Sat Jul 4 00:39:26 2015 UTC,I bought Terraria many years ago and never played it before I had no idea what I was doing. Is this something I can play solo or do I need friends?
patientgamers,3blghw,MonkeysOnCrack,21,Tue Jun 30 09:11:41 2015 UTC,"You can easily play solo. Some of the harder bosses need more preparation if you're going in solo than if you're playing with others (though the new Expert mode on the PC version will scale boss' HP to the number of people). Copying from a post I did yesterday:   Chop down some wood using the axe. Get to about 100, 120 bits of wood. You will also get acorns which you can use to plant new trees. Make a flat surface either using the pickaxe or by placing down some blocks. Place wooden blocks down in a rectangular shape to create the outline of a house (doesn't have to be fancy). Open your inventory. On the bottom-left should be a list of items, which shows you what you can craft from what you have in inventory and what crafting benches you have nearby. One item you can make should be a work bench, needing 10 wood. Craft this and place in your house. With a work bench, you can now craft more advanced items so long as you are near it. Make one door (or two if you want) and remove three blocks per door of your house (using the pickaxe). Place the door(s) in this new gap. Doors are opened by right-clicking. Make a wooden sword. Despite starting with a copper shortsword, the wooden (broad)sword is better. Make some wooden armour (helmet, chest, legs). Wearing armour from the same set gives you a slight defense bonus. Make a bunch of wood walls. Place these inside your house (make a wooden hammer if you need to remove some). This will stop monsters/enemies from spawning inside your house. To make it a livable area for NPCs, you need a table surface (such as the crafting bench), a chair type item, and a light source. The simplest light source is torch = wood + gel (dropped from slimes). You will need one liveable space for each NPC.   From there, you can go exploring. You'll find various ores which you'll need to smelt (using a furnace - stone + wood + torch) in order to use to craft better weapons and armour (using an anvil - lead or iron bars). Ore strength goes copper/tin, iron/lead, silver/tungsten, gold/platinum -- all an either/or situation (so if you find tin you know your world won't have copper) and are functionally identical.  Fishing (if you have the option) can be way overpowered. You need the merchant to spawn as you need to buy the net to catch bait, but you can get a ton of stuff from crates. With enough crates and a bit of luck you can probably gather together enough ores/bars to never need to search for them.  If you get a bit stuck, talk to the guide. One option should be to ask about crafting. You can put in an item and the guide will show you what you can make from it and what other items you'll need. Some will need more advanced crafting stations (like a sawmill or loom)."

The engine is designed to spawn enemies just outside the view range of the player and never anywhere on your screen.  If you go to lower resolutions or make a windowed version of the game smaller, enemies can spawn closer to you than normal.  Conversely, if you go too high on resolution it messes with the balance of the game too much (you won't see many enemies if you are grinding in the same area).  Their compromise was to limit it to 1080p."

patientgamers,3blghw,Auutumnal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:23:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah no info if the patches are coming out tomorrow on console. I think 1.2 was quite a bit after 1.2 for pc, so I'm guessing no. I hope I'm wrong though!"

patientgamers,3bn196,TalkingRaccoon,2,Tue Jun 30 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"There is a bunch of backtracking in System Shock 2 so don't worry.  As for the build just do whatever you want and have fun! People always have opinion's on how you should play old games (what builds or mods to use), but I think the most fun is to just go in blind and have a completely organic experience!  As for what game to play next, if you really like SS2 you could try playing Deus Ex (the original) or the Thief Games."
patientgamers,3bn196,RageBoner,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:53:46 2015 UTC,"Almost done with 99's games, and I'm starting 2000's soon, so Deus Ex is definitely in there.

I'm currently 2 missions away from finishing Age of Empires 2, just started System Shock 2 and bought Planescape Torment (though I don't feel like diving into it right now), These are for 1999. When it comes to 2000, I plan to get Deus Ex, Thief 2, Soldier of Fortune, maybe Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate 2, not sure about these two, and Red Alert 2 if I feel like replaying it (finished it years ago).  I'm mostly playing PC Classics or great underrated games. Figured our it's a good way to gain some new perspective on gaming in general as well as to keep me occupied until I get a second hand PS3 later this summer. I'll probably build a new gaming PC before university, but that'll be in 2 years.   Edit: Typo"
patientgamers,3bn196,CuriousBlueAbra,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"just do whatever you want and have fun   Umm, not the best advice, I think. SS2 was made at a time when it was possible to setup a character that you could pretty much do nothing with unless you were already an expert in the game."
patientgamers,3bn196,Chocobubba,3,Wed Jul 1 12:56:29 2015 UTC,"There is an item you'll get on the Operations Deck called the recycler, that lets you convert random junk into nanites. I personally take to hauling all the assorted pot plants, magazines, ammo, drinks, cigarettes, and such to the elevator on each level so when I finally get the recycler I can just ride the elevator floor-to-floor recycling everything.  The most useful psi abilities are:  On level 1:  Psychogenic agility: Adds 2 extra agility to your character. It makes you faster and more nimble, which is always nice  Psychogenic cyber affinity: Adds 2 extra cyber, which makes you better at tech related skills like hacking  Level 2:  Anti-entropic field (if you use guns): No weapon degradation for the duration of the effect.  Adrenaline overproduction (if you use melee): Multiples your melee damage by a factor equal to your psi skill.  Cerebro-stimulated Regeneration: Cheap way to heal yourself.  Localized Pyrokinesis: Allows you to kill protocol droids (explosive kamikaze robots) without taking damage. I mean that literally - this power renders you immune to protocol droid explosive damage.  Level 3:  Nothing, unless you play in a variety of strange ways.  Level 4:  Psionic Hypnogenesis: Renders an enemy organic target unconscious. Also works on cyborg assassins. Useful against some of the later enemies if you're not using the assault rifle.  Electron Suppression: De-activates any robotic enemy (even turrets) for a time. Quite useful for killing turrets and killing the tougher robots on the recreation deck  Psychogenic endurance: An extra 2 endurance. Very useful, quite a good duration on it too.  Photonic Redirection: The single best psi spell in the game, and worth getting no matter what build you're going. It is that good. This power gives you total invisibility to anything. Even the final bosses. Decreases late game frustration by a factor equal to a lot.   Level 5:  Imposed Neural Restructuring: Makes organic bad guys fight each other  Metacreative Barrier: Creates a force field right in front of you.   Soma Transference: A medium damage attack spell that converts the damage done into health for you. But critically, it works through the metacreative barrier. Suck the juices from the enemy with 100% safety.  Psycho-reflective Aura: 60% damage reduction across the board. Quite useful for not dying.   You can quick swap between psi powers using the F1 to F5 keys without having to use the psi menu.   The crystal shard has a bug with the O/S Upgrade ""Smasher"", that causes overhand swings (hold own the attack button) to deal huge extra damage. Combined with the adrenaline overproduction power allows you to one-shot almost any enemy in the game.  Hacking the security panels disables all the turrets on that level, which is very useful for a few sections you're about to encounter on the engineering deck. Note also you can hack things while using the invisibility spell, so suddenly every turret can safely be made your friend.   Hold down the jump key while standing next to a ledge to mantle up it.   If you try to use the laser pistol (I don't recommend it) you can make it a bit less bad by quick-swapping to a different weapon and back to the laser pistol after each shot. This causes the recharging period to end prematurely, allowing you to fire again immediately. Combine two laser pistols for an almost normal rate of fire."
patientgamers,3bn196,rarelypost,2,Tue Jun 30 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't beat the entire game just yet, but usually you can find keys or logs containing the codes later on.

Where Saints Row 1 felt like GTA reimagined with an emphasis on doing random crazy side actions (many of which were ludicrously fun), each one got more and more insane, to the point where IV shares more mechanics with Prototype than GTA.  Many agree the best is Saints Row 2, which is still fairly grounded in the crime idea, while making the side missions feel awesome.  Unfortunately, on PC, Saints Row 2 has some issues, but if you spend some time getting the fix mods (pcgamingwiki helps), it's still amazing.  Alternately, if you can get it on PS2, that'd be easier to manage."

Here's quick example, you are in a open top car driving a tiger around, you need to drive carefully so you don't piss of the tiger.

You can get a lot of enjoyment single player, but you won't get the same feeling of exploration and survival that you get in Fallout 3.  Borderlands is all about questing and finding better weapons like you would in other lootfest games.  The only thing adding more people into your Borderlands game adds to the game itself besides companionship as you quest is more enemies.    If you've never played, it couldn't hurt to throw in $1 for the Humble Bundle to try out the first game if you're interested in it.

I played the game with both this mod and Dylan's on the hardest difficulty level (just like the mod's author recommends), and had a really good time with it. You need to save-scum because you die easily, but so do the enemies, which is why the drastic difficulty doesn't feel unfair. Well, except when you encounter a patrol car equipped with a bloody rocket launcher that kills you in one shot, but that doesn't happen often enough to make me rage. I like how Dylan's mod and the increased difficulty level force you to think fast, react to the situation appropriately and take cover intelligently before you get gunned down by the enemies. This makes every fight tense, immersive, rewarding, and highly unpredictable. That's not something you can say about many Ubisoft games."

It makes for a great gaming experience, but it's not for everyone.   Personally, I really like that weapons detoriorate and jam (often at the worst possible times, adding to the drama), that you have to manage your malaria, and that the only map is in-game with just a couple of  mission markers.  I agree with OP - FC2 does organic and unpredictable encounters really well. You're not tied into specific approaches, you don't have to get to a particular location before a mission 'activates' - you just approach it from any angle however you like. You make a plan, but things often blow up in your face, and it becomes an exciting and dynamic firefight. Even up to the end when you have great equipment, you never lose the feeling of vulnerability when you're outnumbered and surrounded.  I'd argue it's the opposite of CoD in some ways - it's the polar opposite of the heavily-scripted CoD style (which I think is why some people find it off-putting)."

It's repetitive as hell but for some odd reason I still want to finish it. It's been on my hard drive for a year now and I haven't played it for 3 months.
patientgamers,3bl2ss,Dettelbacher,5,Tue Jun 30 06:36:16 2015 UTC,Best story of the series IMO
patientgamers,3bl2ss,SpookyLlama,3,Tue Jun 30 07:54:07 2015 UTC,I completely disagree. I think the story is excellent in FC2.
patientgamers,3bltiz,PartialChub,13,Tue Jun 30 06:57:39 2015 UTC,"The gameplay radically changes in the 2nd and 3rd - taking the third person shooter dynamic and making it more shooter and less RPG.  The first is generally a slower game, and I know the part you're stuck on - it's difficult. Make sure you make effective use of cover though, if you stand and shoot you will die. Also make use of the ability to pause the game and give your squad instructions - make the most of their abilities."
patientgamers,3bltiz,onemanandhishat,8,Tue Jun 30 07:25:04 2015 UTC,"I see to be one of the very, very few that prefers Mass Effect 1 to the others but I will say that it starts pretty boring and unbalanced. In fact, I'd argue the combat never becomes balanced as at some point relatively early you'll just become an unstoppable killing machine. You can play tactically if you want but there is never a huge reason to (I still do, anyway). If you're on Therum, though, I'd recommend staying inside the Mako and sniping the armatures from a distance, only stopping to bunny hop over their plasma bolts (an alternate tactic is to ram them as they just go limp and can't fight back). This part is super boring but it does get better imho. That said, a huge part of the side missions are Mako stuff so if you hate the thing then that won't change, as the Mako never gets upgraded or changes in any way.  As for story and setting, well, Mass Effect 1 is probably the most... generic? of the bunch. There are twists and turns of course but overall it is fairly standard space opera stuff. The characters might grow on you, but if the setting is a problem then I don't foresee you enjoying this game too much.  Mass Effect 2, on the other hand, is quite different than the first game in tone. I've heard it described as a Western of sorts, but in space. Granted, nobody is walking around wearing a cowboy hat or a poncho but the overall theme, that is, a rogue military official who dishes out justice on the frontier using the guns on his back, well, there are similarities. Shooting is much more balanced this go around and there is no Mako. Took the somewhat standard Mass Effect 1 and made the universe much more compelling and realistic. 3 plays similar to 2, with some throwbacks in tone and mechanics to 1. That said, you will miss out on some major story decisions from the first game if you start here (there is a comic that lets you choose the major decisions, though I've no idea how to use it or where to find it).  tl;dr: Mass Effect 1 does get better, but you still may not enjoy it. Mass Effect 2 is so different that you may love it and you might be better off starting there."
patientgamers,3bltiz,mint_sun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:46:57 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing you become unstoppable as you say but like I mentioned in the op, I actually feel somewhat the opposite though maybe it's too early? I feel like my character can take very little damage and myself and squad mates die rather quickly and easily even though I try to use cover effectively.  Also I have stayed in the Mako but the part I'm talking about specifically forces you to get out and hoof it."
patientgamers,3bltiz,mint_sun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the game is unbalanced on both sides. Early in the game you feel very under-leveled and weak, while a bit later you feel absolutely indestructible. What class are you playing?"
patientgamers,3bltiz,KrishanuAR,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:51:22 2015 UTC,Soldier I believe
patientgamers,3bltiz,mint_sun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:28:45 2015 UTC,"My unstoppable killing machine build for soldier two biotic heavy squad mates (liara and kaidan in my case) level up their disables and basically all enemies will be floating around you helplessly while you mow them down.  I was a assault rifle focused build, but some of my friends swear by the shotguns at least early game. The shotguns in ME1 don't follow usual game logic in that the function just as well for midrange as they do for close range."
patientgamers,3bltiz,poomcgoo8,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"Alright, well soldier can be fun if you utilize all of your different weapons for different situations, but can easily become something where you just spam the assault rifle. It does get pretty fun, but imho the infiltrator or the vanguard are more entertaining since they have tech (essentially debuffs) and biotics (jedi force powers), respectively. This allows for more versatility without relying upon teammates, as well as offering up a different dynamic in combat. Honestly, unless you really like the assault rifle or the soldier powers then it may be in your best interest to play a different class. Each class will get super powerful, even with guns (pistol can actually get really good), so the soldier being good with guns isn't entirely a substantial bonus over the others. Playing a different class would unfortunately require a restart, though, which you may understandably not be willing to do.  Of course, this is assuming that you only have gameplay issues with Mass Effect, not setting and tone issues which you also seem to have. As I said, it does get a lot better once things get rolling (Therum is --easily-- the most boring of the story planets) and you get to Feros and Noveria. Otherwise, I'd simply reiterate and say that you might want to just start with Mass Effect 2 and maybe return later to Mass Effect.  EDIT: I also just remembered exactly where you said you were stuck at. That part, as well as a certain part a little later on Therum right before the end, is much more one-sided than the rest of the game. Most fights don't place you in situations like that and I honestly have no idea why the devs thought it'd be a good idea to set up the fight in that way but I digress. A good tactic that I remember for it is to use sabotage on the armature as much as possible to knock out the guns, and also use biotics on the stalkers (geth with lasers) to try and get them to ragdoll and die from fall damage. Hard fight, but definitely not the norm."
patientgamers,3bltiz,tolbot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"ME1 is by far the best entry in the series.  The story is also the pinnacle of the series, the way you arrive at the big revelation of the universe is fantastic.  The rest of the series I spent trying to chase that moment but failed to ever come close."
patientgamers,3bltiz,numb3red,5,Fri Jul 3 05:51:45 2015 UTC,"get to a cut scene where I can't for the life of me survive for longer than 15 seconds before me and my entire squad are wiped out by what appears to be either the Hopper, Armature, or both. I feel like my character isn't nearly strong enough (or perhaps I just suck) to face even early enemies despite the fact that I upgrade equipment/skills and whatnot for Shepard and my squad.   Oh god I remember this. Trick is to take cover IMMEDIATELY and just whittle things down one at a time. Let your team members do a lot of the work while healing them. It's not a lot of enemies, its just a lot of firepower thrown at you right out the gate."
patientgamers,3bltiz,jetmax25,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:39:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like I tried to do exactly this. After the first try I realized I'd have to run and find cover so the next few times I did so. As soon as I start to try to pick enemies off my squad gets annihilated almost right away and I keep getting one shotted by the armature. So annoying having to watch the cut scene over and over...
patientgamers,3bltiz,rarelypost,3,Tue Jun 30 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"Mass Effect 2 is my favorite single player game of all time. Don't skip ME 1, push through."
patientgamers,3bltiz,NintenTim,2,Thu Jul 2 16:34:22 2015 UTC,"The combat is weak in the first game and drastically changes going into the second.  Make use of biotics, leveling doesn't do much, biotics do."
patientgamers,3bltiz,BadWhippet,2,Tue Jun 30 07:16:58 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're stuck at the elevator part right after getting Liara?  I know that part is difficult due to the Krogan.  Make sure you're issuing squad commands and have everyone focus fire on whoever you're shooting, which should be the Krogan first and then any biotic people.  Also instruct your squad to go to specific locations and set up their skills so you can order them to use a certain skill to help you out in combat.  Your squadmates do die pretty easily in the first game though and they revive with 5% health so they can easily die again.  Just get past the poor combat and enjoy the story since it does sound like you are enjoying that.  The story is the best part of Mass Effect 1.  The other two games in the series will give you a lot of action but not much story, so it's a trade off."
patientgamers,3bltiz,dolphins3,2,Tue Jun 30 07:59:45 2015 UTC,What class are you playing as? Some are way harder than others to learn. I often just do soldier in ME1 because it then just plays like a shooter and you can get to the good stuff quicker. ME2 plays so much better.
patientgamers,3bltiz,flyin-penguin19,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:10:19 2015 UTC,I am playing as soldier
patientgamers,3bltiz,drax117,2,Tue Jun 30 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"I remember only too well the part you are stuck at.  I actually beat it first time through stubborn persistence: I bounced and banged the Maiko against the rocks until it wedged sideways through the rocks at the bottom.  I was then able to rocket all the Geth outside the Therum mines in one fell swoop.  Okay, I cheated, but I felt awesome!  Mass Effect 1 is not my favourite.  The Citadel I thought was awesome, and I loved my introduction to the characters, but the combat was pretty sucky.  I played as an Infiltrator the first time, but in subsequent play-throughs I played as an Adept (biotic).  In ME1 I felt VERY under-powered throughout the game - especially as a biotic because of the monstrous cooldown times and seeming ineffectiveness of my biotic powers, but I found the easiest way of beating ME1-everything was ""let the squad do it"".  As a result, the only skill I focused on was hiding behind rocks and taking a nap until the 'deed was done'.  I would say enjoy ME1 for the story and atmosphere, and for beginning Cmdr Shepard's story for yourself - but ignore the combat as it IS bad (well, I thought so).  I also recommend playing as female Shepard because her dialogue and acting are absolutely great and make the story feel much richer.   My personal favourite of the trilogy was ME2 (fantastic game with fantastic opening twist, and a plethora of great crew members) and from ME2 onwards the combat just improved massively.  In ME1, I was largely a passenger in the game's story though that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  The story gains a lot of momentum after Therum and becomes a lot more interesting, but exploring planets becomes a tad repetitive and is necessary only to create bits of story that will be referred to in the later games."
patientgamers,3bltiz,NightSwipe,2,Tue Jun 30 22:05:33 2015 UTC,"Combat in the first one really is annoying as hell and hard to get into. I feel your pain. Turn down the difficulty if you need to on your first play through, it's not a big deal.   Combat is drastically improved in 2 and 3. You play 1 for the story.  As for the part you're at. We all hate that part with a passion. What I do is run left behind a big billboard thing and slowly pick off all the smaller enemies, then run right and hide behind a crate and slowly wear down the big enemy. Yes, that fight is really stupid. It killed me a good dozen times first time I tried it."
patientgamers,3bltiz,NightSwipe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"As someone said, combat is poor in Mass Effect 1, but it's worth pushing through it. Perhaps lowering the difficulty (I know not a great option); if it helps boost your confidence I think Liara's mission is definitely the hardest - but also the shortest.  Remember: cover, powers, and medi-gel. And make sure you add mods to your guns and armour (those can be a life-saver), I added corrosive shots to my gun and it made the game a hell of a lot easier."

patientgamers,3bltiz,LauranceFuller,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:04:34 2015 UTC,"If you have an earlier save, try doing Liara's mission last.

That being said, take cover immediately upon entering the room and order your squad to take cover and make sure they stay in cover; I noticed my squad had a tendency to break cover after a few seconds."
patientgamers,3bltiz,armedburrito,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:51:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I had no idea it would be this tough I just kinda jumped in after doing some side missions. My save is right before the cutscene. I think I have an earlier one on the same planet so I suppose I could give up on it for now but it would suck to have to do it all over again later.
patientgamers,3bltiz,toyic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel that, the first time I played Mass Effect the game autosaved right before I accidentally drove off a cliff in the Mako, and I couldn't load an earlier save, so I pretty much stopped playing for a few months because of all the progress I lost. But the game is good and worth it, so stay steady! If it's any consolation, the game isn't as long as you think it is ;)"

patientgamers,3bklqq,blakeismyhomeboy,5,Tue Jun 30 00:05:32 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Fallout 3 recently, and it is awful for optimisation on windows 7 and 8, mainly for multicore. I know many people can look this up, but here's a quick fix.  Go to your Fallout 3 install directory (usually C:\My Documents\Games\Fallout 3) and find the file which says Fallout.ini and open in wordpad.  Then press Ctrl+F and loock for ""BUseThreadedAI=0"" and change the 0 to a 1  Then press enter/return and add the text    iNumHWThreads=2   This fixes how many cores the game can run on, so it's only (?) dual core.  I would recommend mods such as Fellout, EVE, GNR expander( this one is like 1.1gb, massive download), Fallout 3 Unofficial Patch, Fallout Street Lights and NMCs texture back. All of these are easy to install with Nexus Mod Manager, as they're hosted on the site (sorta works like a magnet link intot the program).   Fallout 3, New Vegas and Skyrim will take ages to finish all 3, (I've got 90h in Skyrim, 620h in F3(over 3 platforms) and ~33h in F:NV, just to put it into perspective).  Mirror's Edge takes around 10h to complete and it's fantastic; so much fun. Both of the Batman: Arkham games are sick, definitely worth a play. Deus Ex is pretty good, as is Dishonored and Spec Ops: The Line.  The only advice I can give is take your time with them all, don't try and rush to the end, it's much more fun taking it all in throughout these titles. Stay patient!"

Batman: Arkham Asylum Batman: Arkham City (I beat this about 3 weeks ago) Dishonored Just Cause 2 Mirror's Edge   I liked all of these games and would vouch for them based on my experience.    Whenever I get around to picking the next game from my backlog, I either just give a random list to a friend and ask them to pick one, or I pick one myself that's different from the last thing I played.  For example, a lot of recent games I've played and beaten over the last few months have been mostly sandboxes (Lego City Undercover, Arkham City, GTA IV Episodes from Liberty City, AC: Unity, and I'm replaying GTA V on PC right now), so my next game is more than likely going to be something that will give me a break from open world.

I'll go ahead and recommend Mirror's Edge once you finish up with AC3, if only because it's the oldest game on your list that I have played and beaten myself.  I actually had that game sitting in my backlog for a long time (I bought that sucker back in 2009 and just beat it this past February!) and really enjoyed it.    The campaign is pretty short, but I enjoyed the gameplay for what it was worth.

It uses a series of procedurally generated systems that all work in harmony to create a new death trap of a level every time you play. I want to write more about it but I cant say it any better than the 10/10 polygon review.    The beauty of Spelunky is how constantly it encourages learning by doing; it does not tell, show or coddle. Spelunky is an elaborate series of mechanisms that react not just to you, but one another. It has the precise input/output feedback of Tetris, but with the breadth of gameplay of Super Mario Bros.   It has a mode called daily challenge too, where everyone worldwide gets one shot on a level seed. Each day a new seed. After my 1000 or so play-through I beat the game and put it down, but the daily challenges bring me back. Even if it is only for one run a day."

Then after you feel you're making some progress I'd move on to the games that take about 10-15 hours to beat, like Metro 2033, the Batman Arkham games, Dishonored, Bioshock 2, Psychonauts, and State of Decay.  After that I'd just play whatever you're in the mood for, though I personally would start with Fallout 3 first.    Some of the longer games I have personally played and enjoyed are Deus Ex: HR, Dragon Age: Origins, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and NV, The Witcher 2, and XCOM: EU.  Civ V is a very addicting game for some people, so I wouldn't play it until you're close to finishing most of the others, if you are one that would become addicted to it.  I never really got into the game myself.  Spelunky is also a game that can eat into your playtime for other games since it's a roguelike and meant to be played over and over with randomly generated levels each time you play.  I wouldn't play Half Life 2: Episode 1 if you haven't played Half Life 2 first and Mass Effect 2 is also better played after playing Mass Effect 1.  I would also recommend picking up the Deus Ex: HR Director's Cut, especially if you're going to be playing stealth, since they screwed up boss fights in the original game and gave no stealth options to take out bosses.  You can donate $1 or more to charity and get the Director's Cut (info)."

patientgamers,3bihix,theorem_lemma_proof,2,Tue Jun 30 00:26:00 2015 UTC,But Gone Home is... disappointing. It quickly devolves into a TLC drama
patientgamers,3bihix,MalaclypseTheEldar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:47:57 2015 UTC,Dear Esther    Can you tell me something more about the game. Looks so without content.
patientgamers,3bihix,SenorV,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not so much a game as an interactive story. Explore an island as you are told a backstory, and make connections/see metaphors as you want to. No real gameplay other than that, but it's interesting and definitely different from a usual game. I pirated it and it was worth the time I put in."
patientgamers,3bihix,CoolMouthHat,2,Tue Jun 30 14:17:29 2015 UTC,Wouldnt puzzle game length vary greatly depending on how well you can work out the puzzles?
patientgamers,3bihix,apricotmask,3,Mon Jun 29 22:57:06 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it, you're right but wouldn't that be true of any game, really?  If you're bad at the core skill set of the game, it takes longer.  In any case, my time estimates look to be consistent with other players who logged their time using howlongtobeat.com."
patientgamers,3bihix,pavetheatmosphere,2,Mon Jun 29 23:25:41 2015 UTC,You forgot MGSV: Ground Zeroes. It's probably the most expensive demo ever. But it's amazing even if it is short.

patientgamers,3bihix,kal_zakath,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:18:19 2015 UTC,It's fairly new but Parallax is a solid first person puzzler about using gateways to pass between different versions of the same room to solve the path to the goal. The design is minimalistic and the game is simple to grasp but the puzzles are deviously challenging and are broken up into separate bite sized chunks that are perfect for when you have a quick minute for a brain teaser.
patientgamers,3bihix,FredWampy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:55:40 2015 UTC,Parallax    Looks a little bit like Portal and this was not really my favorite game ( played Portal only 2-3 levels).
patientgamers,3bihix,Baggin_Saggin_Barry,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:15:00 2015 UTC,Stealth Inc is a great series too!

patientgamers,3bihix,duksa,4,Mon Jun 29 16:47:05 2015 UTC,I downloaded it when it was free for gold on Xbox. Absolutely love it!
patientgamers,3bihix,blakeismyhomeboy,3,Mon Jun 29 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"Just an awesome game, all around.  My kids loved watching it, as well, as some of the humor was definitely up their alley.  Highly recommend"

patientgamers,3bihix,nagawaka,3,Mon Jun 29 18:15:09 2015 UTC,Gunpoint is a lot of fun. +1 recommendation
patientgamers,3bihix,p000ison,2,Mon Jun 29 20:13:25 2015 UTC,Thank you. Mark of the Ninja was my summersale purchase on steam.   I own Dust but not started yet ( maybe its time).  Heard only good about limbo.  Gunpoint is new for me. Notice!
patientgamers,3bihix,blakeismyhomeboy,2,Tue Jun 30 13:38:21 2015 UTC,"Limbo was one of only a few games that elicited an honest emotional response from me. You can beat it in one sitting if you've got an afternoon free (maybe 4-5 hours), but you might need some time after to ruminate on it.  I've heard similar things about Journey, but haven't gotten to play that yet."
patientgamers,3bihix,kal_zakath,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:15:20 2015 UTC,Both Dust and Limbo are in my backlog.  I guess I can cut some of that backlog a bit quicker than I thought.
patientgamers,3bihix,rarelypost,5,Tue Jun 30 06:19:18 2015 UTC,Is Spec Ops really that short? It felt way longer.
patientgamers,3bihix,Boris_Ignatievich,4,Mon Jun 29 16:48:29 2015 UTC,I think that was just the toll it took on your mind. Great game and I always recommend it when I see threads like this.
patientgamers,3bihix,ekaceerf,3,Mon Jun 29 17:48:19 2015 UTC,"according to this website http://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=8898, its about 6 hours to beat"
patientgamers,3bihix,cakeisatruth,2,Mon Jun 29 16:52:19 2015 UTC,Took me about 6 hours in a single session (it was that good) I played after I got home from work till like 2am. So fucking good.
patientgamers,3bihix,Psychoray,6,Mon Jun 29 19:16:23 2015 UTC,"Cave Story, I guess it's the right size gameplay. Also, can't get enough of it (I have the original freeware, Cave Story+ on PC, Cave Story on DSi, and the Cave Story 3D on 3DS).  Edit: And the Wii version too"
patientgamers,3bihix,ChrysAlice,2,Mon Jun 29 18:43:42 2015 UTC,Absolutly Magicka if you have 1-3 friends around. It's basically a game for about 3 evenings and is super fun.
patientgamers,3bihix,Jarredthebluetiger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:08:49 2015 UTC,I still say it ranks among the most enjoyable co-op games ever made.
patientgamers,3bihix,ChrysAlice,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:17:36 2015 UTC,"It is amazingly fun, but still suffers from issues if you're playing even on LAN. These generally aren't too bad, but in for instance the Cthulu DLC I have not managed to complete the main story due to random crashes on two separate playthroughs with different groups of friends.  Still heartily recommend the game though, it's great fun - even on your own."
patientgamers,3bihix,Jarredthebluetiger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:31:35 2015 UTC,I have the game but not really online-coop friends to play with but thanks anyway.
patientgamers,3bihix,lations,2,Tue Jun 30 13:31:04 2015 UTC,"Brothers - Yeah was my first though when i started the thread. Not played yet but the reviews are all positive.  Mirror's Edge - Played already. A good short game :).  Spec Ops: The Line - Wanted to play, looks awesome, i have the game. Now i can take the time to play the game :).  Cave Story+ - seems nice, noticed.  Magicka - no online-coop friends :(.  Thanks!"
patientgamers,3bihix,Jarredthebluetiger,34,Tue Jun 30 13:42:40 2015 UTC,There's actually a lot of games that only take 12 hours or less to beat.  10-12 hours is more like an average game length.  Some short games I can think of right off the top of my head would be:  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons  Thomas Was Alone  Portal 1 and 2  Gone Home (currently Steam daily deal)  Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes  To The Moon  Valiant Hearts  Unmechanical  Little Inferno  Adventures of Shuggy
patientgamers,3bihix,kymess_jr,11,Mon Jun 29 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"I forgot Valiant Hearts, I loved that game so much"

patientgamers,3bihix,kymess_jr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Seconding Gone Home and To the Moon, they're fantastic story-driven games. Portal 1 & 2 are also fantastic, with a good mix between story and gameplay."
patientgamers,3bihix,Doctor_of_Recreation,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:09:34 2015 UTC,Thank you for the list.  To the Moon & Valiant Hearts looks very nice. Own the games already but not played. Portal 2 is not so my game. Maybe i give a second try.

patientgamers,3bihix,Saucermote,9,Mon Jun 29 17:49:57 2015 UTC,Transistor   Seconding this.  Transistor was just beautiful.  Red's humming has been my ringtone since I played through it.
patientgamers,3bihix,octopode_ala_mode,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:31:09 2015 UTC,Ooo do you have an mp3 of that? I'd love that as my ring tone
patientgamers,3bihix,zzopp,6,Mon Jun 29 20:00:38 2015 UTC,They give them away for free.
patientgamers,3bihix,cakeisatruth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:02:46 2015 UTC,Oh you're the best thanks!
patientgamers,3bihix,proud_to_be_a_merkin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Get the soundtrack from Steam, you'll get high quality MP3's of all the humming tracks. Use Audacity to very easily cut it down to the length you want."
patientgamers,3bihix,palimpsestnine,2,Mon Jun 29 20:30:39 2015 UTC,I might have gotten the soundtrack with the game actually. Thanks!
patientgamers,3bihix,Darkhellxrx,4,Mon Jun 29 20:40:09 2015 UTC,Really surprised Bastion is so far down. Fantastic game that only takes about 6 hours to complete on your first play through. The art and narration style will win you over and bring you back for another play through not long after.
patientgamers,3bihix,Simpsonofadown,7,Mon Jun 29 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"I guess it's not for everyone. I hated the repetitive combat in the game, and stopped playing after I got all trading cards."
patientgamers,3bihix,JiffSmoothest,2,Mon Jun 29 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, the combat is pretty unoriginal and repetitive. I mean, there's a reason whenever this game is recommended everyone always talks about the narrator and soundtrack etc, but make no mentions of the combat. But since the game's only 6 hours, I find there isn't a chance for the negative to outweigh all the positives."
patientgamers,3bihix,McShizzL,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"I will definitely say the combat is not the selling point of the game, but rather the atmosphere (soundtrack, narration, artstyle) and the tale."
patientgamers,3bihix,Protest_The_Cheerio,27,Mon Jun 29 23:43:45 2015 UTC,"I had that exact problem when I first started working a full-time job. These are some of my favourite games of all time, and they're all short to medium length (under 12 hours):  Richard and Alice (post-apocalyptic point and click about two prisoners, lots of dialogue)  To the Moon (old school 16bit RPG with lots of story where you travel through a person's memories, beautiful and sad)  Spec Ops: The Line (shooter, heavy on the story and questions of morality and war, probably one of the top 5 games I've ever played)  Stanley's Parable (meta, break the 4th wall adventure game with a hilarious narrator)  This War of Mine (explores war from the standpoint of civilians trapped in a war zone, struggling to survive and scavenge supplies)  Gray Matter (the graphics are not great, but it's an interesting point-and-click about a young magician and a notorious neuroscientist)  Serena (this one should be free on Steam - a short first person point and click with elements of horror)  Papers, Please (you're a border guard and must take care who you let enter the country - and stamp enough papers to be able to provide for your family)  Long Live the Queen (help a young princess learn stuff and avoid assassination attempts so she can become a queen)  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter (hands down the most visually stunning game I've ever played - solve the supernatural mystery in a small town)  These are mostly point and click, heavy on the story and atmosphere.  Edit: Spec Ops is not a FPS but rather a 3rd person shooter"
patientgamers,3bihix,Boris_Ignatievich,4,Mon Jun 29 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"I heavily agree on the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and I don't normally count this as a selling point, but outside of visuals, it doesn't have a lot of replay value.  So you're probably just going to finish it, and be done with it, unless you want to go through it again a few months later.  A few recommendations of my own:  Among the Sleep -  First person horror adventure as a toddler.  This has been bundled at least twice, you can probably get this on sale.  Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition - a Metroidvania game as a Mexican Troubadour.  Has also been bundled and been on sale."
patientgamers,3bihix,cobbutkssotraoobat,4,Mon Jun 29 19:17:43 2015 UTC,Luchador (Mexican Wrestler) not Troubadour (wandering minstrel)
patientgamers,3bihix,Boris_Ignatievich,3,Mon Jun 29 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"Long live the queen is fantastic. But if you try to explore all dialog choices and pass all skill checks, you'll spend far much than 10-12 hours (I've played for 114 hours)."
patientgamers,3bihix,ObsceneGesture4u,3,Mon Jun 29 19:42:54 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle of Papers, Please and it's absolutely fantastic. The problem is it's hard to describe it without sounding boring, even though the game is great. There are lots of good moral dilemmas and such."
patientgamers,3bihix,Darkhellxrx,2,Tue Jun 30 01:10:31 2015 UTC,"Great game, but Spec Ops: The Line is 3rd person."
patientgamers,3bihix,Dough_Nuts,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:44:13 2015 UTC,You're right! It's been years since I played it and I completely forgot.
patientgamers,3bihix,PoppaTroll,2,Tue Jun 30 08:03:50 2015 UTC,"I heavily recommend Stanley's Parable. This War of Mine, and Spec Ops: The Line.  That said, Stanley's Parable is short and sweet with somewhere around 40 different endings that can take anywhere from 2 minutes to 20 minutes depending on how long you take to make a choice. It's entirely choice-based, and actually kind of parodies a lot of choices in other games. Fantastic game that's worth the price.  This War of Mine is a game that can be short, but you need to learn to play. A lot. You likely won't end up actually beating the game until around 15 hours in, though the save you win with will be no more than 6 hours. Very fun game that questions a lot of different things you do in other games. It's very unforgiving in certain circumstances, and can actually be one of those games that ISN'T fun to play, but is instead engaging. I absolutely loved it. That said, I felt like such an asshole.  Spec Ops: The Line. It's a great Third Person Shooter. It kind of disguises itself as something it's not, in order to bait you farther and farther into the idea that it's a game that's just like Call of Duty and Battlefield, only to drop a bomb on you at the end that shows that these games are kind of ridiculous, and why the hell are you playing a game about WAR? Anything I would say can be summed up better by this video  Finally I come to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. I loved this game. It's a great game. The visuals are absolutely fucking fantastic. The game itself is a puzzle game that doesn't tell you anything. You have to put together how to solve everything, and it's a ton of fun. I really recommend this game, but only under one condition. PLAY IT WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE.  I'm not kidding. This is hands down the best group game I've ever seen. We tried playing a bunch of games together in my group of friends at College, and this was absolutely the best one. The puzzles keep everyone engaged, you're always trying to figure out the mystery of what happened to Ethan, and you're wandering around trying to find the next piece of the puzzle. Don't spoil it for yourself by playing it on your own. Find a group. It's the best way to play the game, even with one person controlling the character. It's absolutely fantastic"
patientgamers,3bihix,nulleffect,16,Tue Jun 30 07:58:53 2015 UTC,"Guacamelee is a fantastic game that take 8 hours to beat, and 12 hours if you want to get everything in the game (that you can get in one run). It has a decent story and the game play is a lot of fun"
patientgamers,3bihix,the_pugilist,5,Mon Jun 29 14:43:39 2015 UTC,Most Metroidvania's would be great to add to this post.   Strider Ori and the Blind Forest Shadow Complex etc

patientgamers,3bihix,slayer1am,13,Tue Jun 30 13:58:00 2015 UTC,Pretty much anything from Telltale Games. I've played Walking Dead Season 1 and Tales from Borderlands. Each episode is about 2-3 hours and there's 5 in a game. Games have great story but they're more adventure games so are a lil lacking in any type of action
patientgamers,3bihix,Darkhellxrx,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"Both Seasons of The Walking Dead are great, but like you said, they lack action. It's all story and choice based, which I like a lot."

patientgamers,3bihix,bluescape,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:41:14 2015 UTC,I highly recommend Journey.  It's around 2 hours max and worth playing all the way through in one sitting.
patientgamers,3bihix,skyturnedred,8,Tue Jun 30 00:55:44 2015 UTC,I may be misremembering but I believe all of the Max Payne series are around that time or less.  The story quality varies but I found the approach to be excellent and there is a refreshing self-awareness which is expressed through such things as soap operas which play on the tvs you find.
patientgamers,3bihix,nemisis1877,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:27:04 2015 UTC,Thanks. Played all three Max Payne Games. The perfect game to finish in one day or 2 days :).
patientgamers,3bihix,Lereas,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:03:14 2015 UTC,I didn't enjoy the third one at first.  I was really disgusted at what the main character had become.  He was drunk and a violent fuck up.  And then I realized that was exactly how the main character felt about himself.  Mind blown.  :)
patientgamers,3bihix,JiffSmoothest,6,Tue Jun 30 14:14:45 2015 UTC,Psychonauts.
patientgamers,3bihix,Lereas,2,Mon Jun 29 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Psychonauts was absolutely one of my favorite games ever as a kid. I picked it up again recently, and played through the whole thing. I never realized how utterly fucked up the entire thing is, and how absolutely creepy it can be. Fantastic game, and I wish they'd make a second one!"
patientgamers,3bihix,majormiryti,3,Tue Jun 30 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, the whole game is based around psychedelics, mental illness, and overall psychonauts in general.  Psychonauts was made because the publishers of Full Throttle (LucasArts) wouldn't let Tim Shafer keep the peyote trip/dream sequence in the game. That sequence/idea became the basis for Psychonauts."
patientgamers,3bihix,lurking9,3,Tue Jun 30 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"I had no idea! That's kind of cool to know, actually!"
patientgamers,3bihix,N3WM4NH4774N,3,Tue Jun 30 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, I thought I was probably pointing out something you knew. If you feel like it, I'd definitely recommend going back and playing it again with this in mind.  There's a lot of references and nods to things that you'll miss if you aren't at least a bit familiar with psychedelics and perhaps more specifically, the history of them and the people who used them, the ""scene"" if you will. But even just knowing what it's getting at should make a lot of these references more obvious.  For example, this talk about psitanium is heavily implying similarities to psychedelics. Not to mention the mountains of other things too like Sasha Nein likely being a nod to Alexander Shulgin (nicknamed Sasha), who was a pioneer psychonaut, he introduced psychologists to MDMA in the 70's, and wrote PIHKAL and TIHKAL with his wife.  One of the great things about the game though is that you don't need to pick up on any of this to enjoy the game immensely. Also most of it will go over kids heads, it's not going to suggest any kids start taking drugs. The humor still works, the story stands on it's own even if you don't realize it's often using metaphor and allegory, and the gameplay is great. It's just that much better if you do get it.  EDIT: If you're interested, I'd read up on psychonauts at least as a starting point. Read some of that and then watch this scene, you'll see what I mean."

For those times, I like to play a short game, that I can finish in 1-2 sittings during a weekend.

patientgamers,3bjwfl,LukeBoy20,2,Mon Jun 29 23:22:04 2015 UTC,"I got about 35 solid hours of fun gameplay from South Park. It was a good purchase. As it was stated above, though, if you don't watch the show or have not watched the show in the past, a lot of references and jokes will go over your head."
patientgamers,3bjwfl,Lord_Crocodilicus,2,Mon Jun 29 23:23:20 2015 UTC,"As others have said, definitely go with SOT if you are a South Park fan at all, if you are a  hardcore South Park fan and have seen each episode, you will enjoy every single minute you are playing. It is relatively short, but for the type of game it is that is not necessarily a bad thing imo. They did a good job of making a lighter RPG experience where there is no need to grind or hoard potions. The battle system was so much fun for me and exploration will lead you to find tons and tons of references to different episodes."
patientgamers,3bjwfl,Vizingard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:55:32 2015 UTC,"Well considering Hitman was given away for free on PSN like a year before SoT even came out...I would say you can probably find it cheaper than $20 at your local game store. That aside I would also go for SoT because as fun as Absolution is, it's still sitting in my library incomplete because it just sort of lost my interest."
patientgamers,3bjwfl,Rhev,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:35:07 2015 UTC,Hit man is awesome and South Park is good too
patientgamers,3bjwfl,ekaceerf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:41:14 2015 UTC,"SP:tsot has one MAJOR flaw, it feels very short.  I don't get people that say 30+ hours.  I think I chewed through it all in less than 6 or 7?  But it was a very enjoyable time if you're a fan of the show."
patientgamers,3bjwfl,chipsandsoda,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:33:15 2015 UTC,South Park was amazing.
patientgamers,3bjwfl,unknownone32,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:26:50 2015 UTC,"South Park is amazing but very short imo, finished it in under 12 hours. Also, I'm pretty sure I've seen it cheaper."
patientgamers,3bjwfl,IndridCipher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:31:34 2015 UTC,Or you could go on Amazon and buy both of them them used. The total cost would only be $16.45 which is $3.50 cheaper than PSN.
patientgamers,3bjwfl,Scrondoth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:08:25 2015 UTC,Hitman Absolution is a great game. I just got the platinum for it this past weekend. Most of the people who claim it's shit are angry it wasn't blood money 2. That game is a great third person stealth action game. Worth playing for anyone who enjoys that type of game. I also think the silly over the top story was fun.   South Park is great too. You should play both at some point.
patientgamers,3bjwfl,gcampos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:39:07 2015 UTC,They are both $14.99 brand new on Amazon right now. You can even get Hitman: Absolution used for $2.45 + $3.99 shipping

patientgamers,3bjnxq,Sparecash,13,Mon Jun 29 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"Oh my, I'm so old...  Yes, it is definitely worth to try out ""Baldur's Gate"". ""Pillars"" was made to copy all the best what was found in BG series.  I recommend getting BG1 and BG2 with all corresponding  expansions for them. Then grab BG1Tutu mod. It will combine BG1 with BG2, make transition from first game to second almost seamless. And even better - all graphics will become as in BG2. Which is much nicer than in BG1. BG1Tutu is essentially a way to glue together BG1+BG2. It doesn't change anything else. It is vanilla game.  If you want mods - you may want to check out The Big Picture. It already contains many other mods in it."
patientgamers,3bjnxq,dc_da_big,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"Haha you're not old, I'm just trying to catch up! Thank you for the recommendations.  Do you know if the mods work with the enhanced editions? I don't see any references towards them on the mods pages."
patientgamers,3bjnxq,dc_da_big,2,Mon Jun 29 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"There are many mods out there that do work with combined and enhanced BG1+BG2.  The Big Picture is a set of mods which have been tested and proved to work with each other.  Most mods for BG series are additional NPCs, quests, items, etc. They normally don't change anything in gameplay mechanics.  Some add additional features to mechanics of game, like ""press TAB to light up all openable containers"". Very useful feature, as part of the game I DIN'T like was finding all hidden places. BG is full of hidden stashes. And you had to find them all, otherwise you couldn't say that you played this game. Like under the rock, or in toilet seat.  In fact, hidden places and enemies and mini-quests was a very nice part of the game. We normally gathered with friends and told each other stories of our playthrough. And it was very cool if you told something other didn't know about."
patientgamers,3bjnxq,toyic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:41:41 2015 UTC,This is a really helpful answer. I love modding games when I can but I know very little about it so having someone tell me what I can and cannot mod is helpful.

patientgamers,3bjnxq,Encyclopedia_Tom,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:54:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would suggest waiting for the Enhanced Edition. It has a lackluster storyline, but pretty well done combat. I loved pillars of eternity due to the storyline, but Divinity doesn't have much of one to speak of. ""Hey, go look for magic. Fight a bunch of stuff. Oh hey you found magic. Go fight more things. Go fight some magic things.""  The enhanced edition promises a completely rewritten (and better!) story, plus a huge number of new and interesting things to the game, including voice acting. That said, they're going to be released as two separate games, so if you play Divinity now you won't spoil divinity enhanced."
patientgamers,3bjnxq,Ulti,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:06:27 2015 UTC,I had idea that D:OS was coming out with an enhanced edition. Didn't the original come out not too long ago?
patientgamers,3bjnxq,Encyclopedia_Tom,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:29:41 2015 UTC,"The enhanced edition was announced about 3 weeks ago, iirc. They weren't happy with the fact that they had to rush the game out the door in order to meet release date/budget concerns, and they wanted to use the money they got from the sale of the game to patch it up to meet their vision.  They're also releasing the enhanced edition on the PS4 and Xbox 1 consoles when it comes out, so it's going to have controller support as well, if you care about that!  If you own D:OS on Steam, then you'll get the enhanced edition for free on Steam whenever it comes out. (I'm not sure exactly how far along in development they are with it)"
patientgamers,3bjnxq,Ulti,2,Wed Jul 1 02:41:50 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed both chapters of torchlight. 10/10 would play again.
patientgamers,3bjnxq,Encyclopedia_Tom,3,Mon Jun 29 21:29:47 2015 UTC,"If you liked Torchlight, you should check out Grim Dawn. It's by the guys who made Titan Quest, and basically reminds me of Torchlight, but umpteen billion times better. It's still in Early Access but there is already an absurd amount of stuff in the game, I guess they're adding another act and a few new classes before Christmas when it'll release proper."

patientgamers,3bjnxq,DocJRoberts,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:41:31 2015 UTC,Shadowrun: Dragonfall is easily among the best RPGs I have ever played. It is hands down the best written and has the best stat system I've ever seen. And most of the characters were so well written!
patientgamers,3bjnxq,techniforus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:37:02 2015 UTC,I was going to suggest Dragonfall as well. I love it!
patientgamers,3bjnxq,Carlos13th,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:06:49 2015 UTC,Be aware that there will be a GOTY-edition of Wasteland 2 later this year which will enhance the game quite a bit. I already got the game but delayed my playthrough until the GOTY hits (you get a free patch if you already own the game).
patientgamers,3bjnxq,lurking9,6,Tue Jun 30 10:25:43 2015 UTC,"If you want continuity, I would say go for BG1 first.  BG2 is better in all respects but it is a direct sequel to the first game so super major spoilers if you start with BG2.  While I haven't tried the enhanced versions of the games, I heard a lot of good stuff with them, especially since a lot of their enhancements are for modern systems (proper widescreen support for instance, even if its black barred as I understand it.)  I never personally played much of Icewind Dale but its a bit more traditional in ""build your party of six and adventure out into the cold."" So its slightly different than how BG is. (Party setup is very much like PoI in BG).  And if you are interested in something slightly off the wall, Planescape Torment is also a great game because its weird.  Plus, I think Planescape Torment shows off that you can make a game and make it feel combat optional (to a point, of course) in dialogs. (I felt BG and ID did pretty poorly in that respect).  Oh and you get some really interesting party members along the way."
patientgamers,3bjnxq,Rhev,5,Mon Jun 29 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard great things about Planescape, especially in regards to its story and the depth of its dialogue options. I am really debating between it and the BG series as my next purchase.  I think I will end up trying BG1 because being able to continue a character in BG2 is very appealing. If for some reason I can't get into BG1 then I will move straight to BG2 because it's supposed to be better in every way."
patientgamers,3bjnxq,ldnola22,2,Mon Jun 29 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"if you don't have issues playing older games that you didn't play in their prime, then yeah BG1/BG2 would be a good bet. And the EEs of each of them are available and fixed up pretty well at this point that you should be safe getting them over the originals. Playing BG1/2 is just THE Isometric CRPG experience. Well worth the play if that's what you're looking for.  However, that being said... Planescape is my favorite CRPG of all time. While the characters in BG2 are great (Boo + Minsc = <3), they just don't hold a candle to the characters in Planescape. The writing and atmosphere of PS:T just wipe the floor with any other Isometric game I've played.   Either way, you're making a good choice, imo. Aspire to play both, but start with BG if you want the longer run (due to the two games and continuing like you said) first. If you want the overall better game of the two, imo start with PS:T.   Either way, enjoy!"

patientgamers,3bil6t,dolphins3,40,Fri Jul 3 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"Man I'm sorry you think Geralt has no personality. He, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting and well developed protagonists disguised as rather boring one, at least at first glance. The way he interacts with the world around him based on your choices feels complex and nuanced once you begin connecting all the dots. Sex scenes and especially the sex card thing are all fairly juvenile in the first one, but you can opt out I believe, and once you get past how silly it is, it is one of the few games that depicts casual sex as a neutral role playing choice. And does some really interesting stuff with the choices of more serious partners as the trilogy progresses.   I think the moral choices in the Witcher series are unparalleled, you should give the second one a shot."
patientgamers,3bil6t,NintenTim,13,Mon Jun 29 16:33:33 2015 UTC,Not to mention there are lore reasons for it too. It's explained that witchers are drained of emotions during training as to remain neutral and not cloud their judgement.
patientgamers,3bil6t,hydranite,11,Mon Jun 29 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"I think you've got it a bit wrong there. They aren't physically drained of emotions, but going through the trials, enduring the physical pain, mutations and seeing 8/10 of your fellow trainees die incredibly painful deaths, hardens your personality a bit. As a side note, witchers have always gotten involved in politics, Geralt isn't the first. They shouldn't, but that doesn't stop them.  IIRC, the whole thing about witchers displaying a lack of emotions was propaganda or a smear campaign spread through ""Monstrum: a portrayal of witchers"", which ultimately ended in a peasant pogrom against witchers, where the fortress of Kaer Morhen was attacked, and all the witchers killed, expect for Vesemir, who is a important character in the books and games. The first line in the opening of TW2 is a quote from the book.   Verily, there is nothing so hideous as the monsters, so contrary to nature, known as witchers for they are the offspring of foul sorcery and devilry. They are rogues without virtue, conscience or scruple, true diabolic creations, fit only for killing. There is no place amidst honest men for such as they. They roam the land, importunate and insolent, nominating themselves the stalkers of evil, vanquishers of werewolves and exterminators of spectres, extorting payment from the gullible and, on receipt of their ignoble earnings, moving on to dispense the same deceit in the near vicinity. The easiest access they find at cottages of honest, simple, and unwitting peasants who readily ascribe all misfortune and ill events to spells, unnatural creatures and monsters, the doings of windsprites or evil spirits. Instead of praying to the gods, instead of bearing rich offerings to the temple, such a simpleton is ready to give his last penny to the base witcher, believing the witcher, the godless changeling, will turn around his fate and save him from misfortune. And Kaer Morhen, where these infamous beings nestle, where they perform their foul practices, must be wiped from the surface of this earth, and all trace of it strewn with salt and saltpetre.    It's the same reason villagers are afraid that he'll steal their children, it's misinformation. The pogrom happened a long time before Geralt becomes a witcher though and it's why the world treats him with so much disdain. They used to be welcomed with open arms, but times changed, and so did the general populace. He also can't physically cry, once again because of the mutations to his body.  He's defiantly a nuanced character though. He loves sarcasm and speaks more with his body language than with actual words. Most of the time when he says that witchers can't feel anything, he's being sarcastic, because that's what the general peasant thinks. In TW3, for example, there's a scene where he's called heartless for doing x instead of y (it was the lesser evil though), and he quips back saying that ""I guess the mutations worked then""."
patientgamers,3bil6t,FlyingScotsmanZA,3,Mon Jun 29 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"I've been reading the books and this is a great reflection. Wanted to add that the ""emotionless"" propaganda also affects Geralt's own perspective of himself, he has trouble trusting his true emotions, and his friendship with Dandelion seems (to me) to be borne out of Dandelion's full and total acceptance of Geralt's personhood, without any reservation about him being a sociopathic freak."
patientgamers,3bil6t,NintenTim,-4,Tue Jun 30 11:05:45 2015 UTC,"And not to mention the game constantly breaks this by letting you pick a side when faced with a moral choice. In the books, Geralt stayed neutral whenever possible and never picked sides, and when it wasn't possible he just picked the less harmful one (the trademark ""lesser evil""), while still not siding with it."
patientgamers,3bil6t,hydranite,15,Mon Jun 29 17:50:38 2015 UTC,Geralt did a lot of questionable things in the books not in keeping with the neutrality as well. In the first game he has amnesia and doesn't remember the rules he established or even what type of person he was during the period in the books. He has to figure things out all over again and part of the plot is centered around that.
patientgamers,3bil6t,NintenTim,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"It's not that I think he has no personality at all. His personality is just flat and boring. He's just this tropey, super badass, super powerful swordsman unmatched by anyone, who's a womanizer alpha male constantly hitting on women and having casual sex with them just because he can to boot."
patientgamers,3bil6t,Pharmakoza,20,Mon Jun 29 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"I highly disagree, Geralt makes jokes that fall flat, gets ragged on by his friends, and depending on your choices, has a consistent internal philosophy that guides his choices. He might be a powerful badass in combat, but outside of it he's awkward, conflicted and disliked. The games highlight his unique role society that is both hated and essential. He's a badass, but not in a chosen one, best of his class way."

patientgamers,3bil6t,BoTuLoX,-11,Tue Jun 30 02:40:17 2015 UTC,"You actually think all men are like that?   No, some are beta males and rarely ever/never get to have sex because of appearance and/or (most importantly) lack of social skills with women.  There are grey areas, men who gave up on women regardless of social skills and of course there's homosexual men too.  But by real life, I meant that the type of man OP described is in fact 100% real and fairly common.  EDIT: I wonder what type of man might feel attacked by this comment..."
patientgamers,3bil6t,spaceindaver,6,Tue Jun 30 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"I can only assume you're getting your views on masculinity and relationships from... I dunno, 4chan, maybe? Or maybe just by watching Mad Men on a loop? Actual adults don't think or act like this, in my experience."
patientgamers,3bil6t,BoTuLoX,-5,Tue Jun 30 03:47:04 2015 UTC,"Going through these phases and observing these behavioral patterns helps.  You just never really truly considered it, nor given the subject anything more than a passing thought. Make it your life for a while and it ends up being as bright as day (no better way of learning most stuff in life, by the way).  It's easy not to observe these things when it becomes routine and we are not abstracting away behavior into their root causes, why would we? it distracts us from the things we assign a high priority to, so your interactions with other ""actual adults"" end up being focused on the what, not the why.  Have you ever heard that for a man to be succesful with women he ""needs confidence""? Well, it's kind of like the joke about the chicken crossing the road, most people just don't get it until someone points it out to them or they actually stop to look for the meaning."
patientgamers,3bil6t,spaceindaver,7,Tue Jun 30 04:09:39 2015 UTC,"You sound a lot like that really rapey guy who was denied entry into several countries to give his seminars on how to ""get"" women. Relationships/sex aren't things that healthy adults see as trophies to be acquired.

While its still true that most characters are basically just sarcastic badasses reading the books does help you understand their motives a little bit better.   I've actually tried reading them way back in 2007. I've only read The Last Wish and that was enough for me - I didn't like it. Geralt was even worse in the books than he is in the game, with how he's constantly whining about how the world is a bad, cruel place, like he was some kind of 15-year old emo boy writing lyrics for his garage band. Guess it's Andrzej Sapkowski who's to blame for my complaints, since it was him who wrote all this stuff the way it is.   Actually Dishonored might be something you'll enjoy. Great world building, interesting characters with their own motives, and a story that doesn't involve you saving the world. That being said there isn't much choice in the game other than how you approach missions, even if that does influence the outcome of the game.    Not a bad idea. I've already played it, but never got far due to how bad I am at stealth games, so I might give it another shot."

I know these aren't 3d games which you seem to be wanting, but they truly are excellent. I know you mentioned Dark Souls, but if you have a ps3 I'd highly recommend checking out Demon's Souls, it's actually my favorite of the series (mostly due to it being the first I played I guess). It's significantly less forgiving than Dark Souls while still having the series' trademarks (obviously, since it's the first in the series). The Stalker series is a modern day Fallout-esque series that you may be interested in, definitely worth giving it a look if you're looking for something dark and an open world sounds appealing. A point-and-click (again, I know I'm not hitting the genre you asked for but everybody else has hit the big ones) you might consider is I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream. Again, it's a point-and-click,  but it's one of the darkest, most mature games I've ever played. Plus it regularly goes for dirt cheap."

There's also the 2013 Tomb Raider, and a couple other AAA titles that I'm sure you'd find interesting. Shadow of Mordor, since it takes place in Middle Earth, is very expansive lore wise, as Tolkien's had lots of time to write his books, and his world, and the devs used pieces of that in SoM. The almost turn based strategy you had to use when killing orc chieftains is also part of its charm. It sort of feels like Far Cry 4 and Witcher rolled into one, is what I thought. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.  edit: Oops, forgot, this game is a little heavy requirement wise, so if you dont have a witcher 3 capable PC, I'd recommend against playing this baby on maximum."

As far as gameplay is concerned, sure, there are varying differences, but the swordplay is there, the theme of magic is there, although Geralt's Signs can be used far more offensively than SoM's Wraith powers, but the general concept is there. It's not getting Game Of The Decade, but it's still quite a bit of fun, especially if you're a fan, like I am, of the Middle Earth lore/books/movies/universe."

patientgamers,3bg7y5,forkinanoutlet,5,Mon Jun 29 07:06:56 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, I forgot about Boktai! Boktai was awesome!  Antichamber is a pretty mind-bending puzzle game that kind of just plops you down without any direction.  I know that people have mixed feelings about Gone Home, but I think it's a really interesting exploration-based story game. It thinks outside the box in that the whole game takes place in an empty house, yet it manages to tell several stories through your own curiosity.  If you're into story-based click-and-points, The Longest Journey is really, really cool. The story travels through two dimensions; one is a surreal, magical fantasy world and the other is a gritty, cyberpunk world. Neither worlds are that unique, but the idea to mash the two together is really awesome. It's a game that takes two separate genres and smashes them together into a pretty awesome trip of a game.  Surgeon Simulator gets a lot of flak for being a bit of a joke, but when you really think about it, it's a game that purposefully implements terribly awkward controls to create a huge challenge from what should be a simple task. Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a lot like that too, and is one of the funniest games I've ever played just because it's such a fucking ridiculous concept. I mean, the tagline is ""Loving Father. Caring Husband. Secret Octopus."" That should sell anybody with half a sense of humour.  Though the gameplay is pretty standard turn-based RPG, South Park: The Stick of Truth is filled with fourth-wall breaking and criticism of games and the games industry. If you love South Park, it's pretty worth picking up just for the humour and writing. It's a huge homage to the series and makes a lot of fun references to popular episodes.  MGS3 also does some fourth wall breaking. During the fight with The End, the ancient sniper, you can actually save the game, turn it off and turn it on a week later to find out that The End has died of old age."

You guide the character via turning on lights or opening doors. There are no other ways of communication (you can hear the main character talk but you cannot talk to her).   The in-game screen looks like as you were actually using security camera software on your desktop. You can have multiple camera windows, access databases etc.   That said, as far as I can tell the person who controls the camera system is another character in the game and not supposed to literally represent us, the player (at least I think so because I only played an 1 hour so, you never know).

In one of them - Space Quest... 3 I think it was - the plot involves you saving the programmers of the Space Quest games themselves and delivering them to the owners of Sierra Online, the company that published the games.   A lot of the other games in that sequel had weird stuff like that. In one of the SQ series you go back and forward in time and meet other characters from the other games in the series who are aware that they are in a game (and refer to themselves as being in a particular episode). And I think, but can't remember that well, that you can either accidentally warp to a Kings Quest world (or maybe the other way, from a KQ to SQ world) if you mess up something in one of the games, resulting in a ""you poked the wrong button or messed up your teleportation spell"" game over scene."

patientgamers,3behqk,Dohi64,9,Sun Jun 28 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"faerie solitaire: I realized I should get rid of all my trading cards, and I wanted to get them from the games I'd already completed but the cards were still 'in them' (offline mode, drm-free version, etc.). this was one of them, and I made the mistake of playing 'just a few hands' while it was running. first session: 3 hours... it's as addictive as the first time around, so I completed the 8 stages and all 5 challenges again, but obviously didn't fuck around with the pets.  renegade ops (coldstrike campaign dlc): as much fun as it looked, I really (really!) disliked the game when I played it a couple months ago, but since this dlc adds 3 more missions to the base game's 9, so it's 'meaningful content', and you can access it right away, no need to replay the game or other nonsense, I wanted to have it. I bought it right at the end of the steam sale with some card money I'd collected during the sale, the last few cents literally came half an hour before the sale ended, so it was completely free. it's basically more of the same, but thankfully much shorter (about an hour) and less frustrating, and I'm finally done with it all. I'm such a masochistic idiot...  tera (last week): at lvl60 I learned about etching, a kind of crafting to make gear temporarily better, but I don't think I'll bother with it. it's also really expensive. and apparently lvl55 armor is the best you can craft until 65, and for that you have to take the artisan test, which I hear is super grindy and pricey, so I'll probably pass on that as well. so I bought some lvl60 dungeon gear from the broker for real cheap and after taking care of some pre-60 business (not everything, still have bams to kill), I'm now left with 5 dungeon quests. I hope I can find some people to do them with eventually.  there are also 5 more areas on the 3rd continent I haven't visited yet, so that's what I'm doing now. they're lvl58-60, so skippable by now, especially because I'm sure I won't reach 61 anyway, but it's fine, I'm interested. then off to the 4th continent and some sort of airship for the lvl60-65 questline, which will eventually give me a full set of armor. I guess/hope I'll be done with the game one way or the other sometime in july, though that's when 4(!) new instances are supposed to make their debut, but without uber-awesome gear I won't stand a chance to even get into a team, so I won't even worry about it.  need for speed: hot pursuit (2010): I'm done after about 30 hours, gonna keep it installed for the occasional multiplayer. finally managed to complete the intercept and both regular races that were causing me a lot of pain. in one of the races even the tiniest mistake meant me finishing in last place. once, after many tries, I was finally gonna win (bronze would've been fine) when someone crashed into me about 20 meters(!) before the finish line. I hit the desk so hard my hand still hurt 10 minutes later, but the very next try was finally successful, gold medal even, and I also beat my buddy's best time as a bonus. the game's usually more forgiving than this (like in the other problematic race, even after a crash I could finish in 3rd or 4th place), but in some cases it can be really frustrating.  I've completed all the cop events, got 28 golds out of 48 (mostly hot pursuits, which are the most fun, the rest is luck/random/glad to be over) and all 60 racer events (19 gold). the final race was 43.5 miles, which, compared to the longest events' 15 was quite a thing. I finished it under 15 minutes and got bronze, and of course crashed a few times, including once about 200 meters before the finish line while I was in 4th place. luckily #3 had crashed just before me and I hit him and got back into the race at #3, otherwise it would've been 4th place and I probably wouldn't have tried it again. the race started in the afternoon and turned into night while driving, but the most atmospheric thing was probably an earlier pursuit, which started in the evening in the sunshine, but when I came out of the tunnel after a few miles, it clouded over, there was thunder and lightning, it started to get darker and the cops showed up.  I really wish there were another game like this. sure, I could re-do the events for better results or just cruise the courses, but I want more of the almost-same. the gameplay is really fun, the game looks great, even some of the soundtrack's tolerable, so throwing in new environments and some new cars would be enough for me (a lot of cars are identical in this one, except for the paintjobs, which is weird because you can change the color anyway, so you basically unlock a new set of colors instead of new cars). I already played test drive unlimited (didn't bother finishing all the races there, it was way too difficult, but I did what I could), and I still have tdu2, fuel and burnout paradise to play (and maybe most wanted 2012, I hear it's very similar to burnout), but that's it, and probably none of these will offer the same kind of fun as nfs:hp did (I remember the cops in tdu being total dicks, towards the end I had to turn them off so I could complete a few more races)."

Personally I don't know anything about cars so I just pick the fastest one, but when I showed the game to my friend he thought it was amazing and insanely cool how all these different cars were there and wanted to play with them all.  Burnout Paradise is my favorite racing game and you'll definitely enjoy it if you liked hot pursuit. The multiplayer is almost dead though (at least it was when I last played it a year ago)"
patientgamers,3behqk,Dohi64,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"glad you're having fun. to be honest, I haven't even tried free drive mode, probably because you don't need to drive around the world, just pick events from the map. and I also figured if I do a course again, I might as well do it 'for real' in case I get a better time or something.  as for the cars, I also only look at speed, but after a while I started comparing the other stats and they seemed identical, so I found pointless unlocking the 4th lamborghini gallardo or whatever. and was a bit disappointed when a dodge viper (one of my favorites) proved slower than some others I already had, so I saw no reason in driving it. also, it only came in ugly colors, the classic blue-white wasn't there.  as for burnout, I have a buddy who plays it occasionally (the same one I play nfs with sometimes), so we might be able to have a few sessions going. I'm looking forward to trying it but don't want to jump into it right away, in case the differences in handling/gameplay turn me off so soon after nfs."

patientgamers,3behqk,njstein,3,Sun Jun 28 19:18:31 2015 UTC,"It wasn't hard comic book format, but the way they did the cutscenes adapted the style to better fit the capabilities of the technology.  The reason Max Payne was so big on the comics is how else are you going to fit so much story and dialogue onto a 700mb cd, in addition to the blazing amazing visuals.  Now that space is less of an issue, they are adapting the style.  I love how it's a sort of live action comic book, and the random highlighting of words just adds a delight to the sarcasm or plot points.  It's an absolutely lovely experience, and extremely challenging.  I played through the first two on every difficulty, but even on the standard setting this game is still slapping me around much more than I expected."

I've actually picked up the enhanced editions of BG1, BG2, and Icewind Dale, plus I'm going to add Pillars of Eternity at the end of the run.  Since this is probably going to take a very long time, Tides of Numenara will probably be out before I'm done, so maybe I'll tack that on too.  I started Baldur's Gate with the belief that I REALLY hated old, clunky, isometric style RPGs.  I'm also used to games that will hold my hand and not punish me too badly for screwing up, and the AD&D ruleset isn't exactly friendly.  I assumed I was just going to have to force my way through it.  But.... WOW, I did not expect it to grab hold of me as firmly as it has!  Somewhere in the first six hours or so it got its claws into me and now I just can't stop.  Granted, I'm pretty much spamming the quick-save button and I have no idea what I'm doing half the time, but something about that makes it even more rewarding.  I guess I don't hate this style of game after all.  And that realization has me pretty excited, because if I can learn to like this, that means I can play the old Fallout games, Wasteland 2, and Arcanum - three things I've been interested in but wary of.  edit: some formatting"
patientgamers,3behqk,magusthe7,2,Sun Jun 28 14:43:43 2015 UTC,If Baldur's Gate has taken a hold of you I highly suggest Pillars of Eternity. Obsidian just released it recently; and they did not miss on any details. The only thing they changed (that some people are 50/50 over) was how you can't just grind the same monsters for experience. Hard to describe but I highly suggest the game if Baldur's fever has you.
patientgamers,3behqk,FlingingDice,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:29:38 2015 UTC,I picked it up during the sale so I definitely plan to play it once I've worked my way through the older games.  I just need a few vacations to pull it off.

I even did all of the DLC missions, which were really good (the Arrival and Kasumi ones were my favorites).  Excellent game to this point. I love the fact that my team has much more fleshed out personalities and storylines than in the first game, and most of the loyalty missions are great. My only complaint is that such a small number of missions advanced the overall plot. I'm sitting at about 55 hours played because I'm doing everything, but I had to slow down on completing the story missions so fast, which made the pacing feel a little off. To be fair, the first game kind of had the same problem too, but there's just so much more to do in this one. Still, I've enjoyed every minute of this game, and I don't want it to end."

patientgamers,3behqk,SteadyEddie69,4,Sun Jun 28 21:03:53 2015 UTC,Yes as it serves to explain the transition between the ending of Mass Effect 2 and the beginning of Mass Effect 3.

patientgamers,3behqk,Amndeep7,2,Sun Jun 28 19:23:42 2015 UTC,Age of Empires 2 was fantastic.  The Conqueror's expansion pack adds a lot of QoL improvements to the base game along with adding a lot of nice bonus material.  I heartily enjoyed this game as a kid.

Once you unlock some more of the hacking abilities the game becomes quite fun. If I had to complain about something it would be that the crime fighting is quite annoying. I fail half of them due to intervening too early, despite the crime already taking place!   I also had a quick play on hotline miami. Its hard. Very hard. I did enjoy it though, even the dying. I think I've just got to the first level with dogs and it's getting harder! Fun though as a backburner game."

patientgamers,3behqk,blaaaaaacksheep,2,Mon Jun 29 10:57:31 2015 UTC,Got fed up with GTA5 online. Felt like I spent more time in loading screens than actually playing the game. So I moved on to Diablo 3 for online coop with a friend. That game is a bit of a grind.... everything looks the same. I don't see a noticeable change when I equip different armor or weapons and the story is fairly bland. Maybe I'm missing something.

I had 2 hours invested already and finished the rest of the game in two days. LOVED IT. Sunday night I finished up Scourge: Outbreak. which I ended up really disliking. Now I'm focusing on Kane & Lynch: Dead Men (more than halfway done) and probably Homefront since I read in another thread that it's really really short. I want to dive right into Bioshock 2 so badly but made a deal with myself that I have to finish at least three other games first and then I can start Bioshock 2."
patientgamers,3behqk,lacsativ,2,Tue Jun 30 09:48:54 2015 UTC,"I got a couple of tips.  I could never get into Kane & Lynch: Dead Man because it had performance issues on my build, but I totally loved Kane & Lynch 2. Whether you end up liking or disliking this game, please give K&L2 a go if you can find it for cheap. It's a really underrated game.  Bioshock is may favourite games series, and I am extremely happy to see more and more people playing the games. Bioshock 2 improves the original Bioshock formula on pretty much every aspect. However, not many people consider it as good as the original, and that it because it doesn't hit as hard as the plot twist in the first game did. Other than that, it's superior to Bioshock 1 in every field. Once I started it years ago I couldn't put it down until finished.   Last but not least, if you ever decide to play Bioshock Infinite, start it with an open mind and just clear the expectations out of your head, AND PLEASE, GET THE DLCs. They are in my opinion better than Infinite itself, and conclude the series in a beautiful way. It sucks that they didn't include them in the original game, as they are mandatory if you are interested in the story.   I hope this will help. Happy gaming!"
patientgamers,3behqk,SeleneNyx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:35:41 2015 UTC,"For me, getting into Kane & Lynch had nothing to do with performance issues (until today, strangely enough GFWL wasn't loading; I fixed it, though). The issue for me was it was SO ANNOYING lol. I hated the escort mission and the shoot the truck driver mission, I HATED that you can't skip cut scenes after you've already seen them, I HAAAAATEEE that you can not save after every individual part - for instance if I start a new chapter but need to stop playing and have already finished a couple parts, when I reload later on it starts at the beginning of the chapter. GRR WHYYY?! Well I am THRILLED to say I finished the game an hour ago - and did both endings. Uninstalled immediately and will never touch the game again!! I do own K&L2 and will be playing it eventually since I have heard it is better.    Finishing - and ending up really really liking - Bioshock was a huge surprise for me. I started it two years ago! I would play for a little bit, hate it, get lost, hate the dark, quit. I spent the first two hours of gameplay like this and hadn't touched it in months. For whatever reason something clicked this weekend and all of a sudden I was loving it. And now from your comments I can't wait to start part 2! I'm going to start it this week =)  As for Infinity, I already own it and finished it months ago (I did things backwards). I loved Infinite. I also really loved the DLC because one of them (i forget which) reminded me of Dishonored (my favorite game) with the crossbow, the stealth, and the ability to see through walls."

Here is what will be added at the end according to reddit: https://steamdb.info/sub/71559/apps/  BL1 Complete + BL2 Complete (all content including all 5 headhunter missions minus the cosmetics) for $15. If you want to play BL1 then this is the ticket :]
patientgamers,3bcg5r,IdeaPowered,16,Sat Jun 27 23:13:19 2015 UTC,Humble bundle has a better deal right now including the first game
patientgamers,3bcg5r,ShellWithMe,4,Sun Jun 28 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"I personally don't find it a better deal (if you wait for the common 75% off) since HB doesn't include Tina's yet.  That's the content I would get if I were rebuying BL2. No Tina's, no dice."
patientgamers,3bcg5r,IdeaPowered,4,Sun Jun 28 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"since HB doesn't include Tina's yet.   I'd bet that the HB deal will include Tina's DLC when it's all done.  That said, I agree that one really does want Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep -- it's the best part of the game.  edit: Actually, looking at the bundle more carefully, the Season Pass does include Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep.  (It doesn't say so in the HB text, but the video says so, and what I remember says so -- I bought it back when.)  So it's already included."
patientgamers,3bcg5r,dougmc,2,Sun Jun 28 02:07:08 2015 UTC,I had looked at the Season pass text elsewhere. Looked it up on 2k. It does include it.  https://steamdb.info/sub/71559/apps/  Also means it will include the last pack for BL1 and all 5 Headhunter packs. My suggestion has been modified. May as well spend $3 and get BL1 complete.
patientgamers,3bcg5r,IdeaPowered,3,Sun Jun 28 09:45:45 2015 UTC,"Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is in the season pass, so it's part of the HB deal.  (if you pay $15, anyways.)  HB's text doesn't say so, but the video does, and so does my memory of buying the season pass back then."
patientgamers,3bcg5r,dougmc,5,Sun Jun 28 05:46:42 2015 UTC,"15 dollars get's you Borderlands 1 and 3 out of 4 of it's DLC, Borderlands 2 with a few of the side DLC shit and the season pass for Borderlands 2 which does include Tiny Tina's as I'm looking at my steam DLC right now and it says I own it. Plus there's more coming for the bundle on Tuesday and you get 75% off the Pre-Sequel which is the best discount the game has going for it right now.  This deal is amazing if you've never played the series because Borderlands 1 itself still holds up and anyone playing 2 or being interested in playing 2 should play the first one as well. Steam had Borderlands 1 GOTY and Borderlands 2 bundled for 10 dollars during the Steam Sale and Borderlands 2 GOTY was standalone for like 15-19 bucks. And as I said earlier in Humble Bundle you also get side DLC. Not sure how relevant the side DLC is but I'm sure it still adds content to the game, I think one of them raises the level cap.  Humble Bundle just straight up has the better deal as of right now if you drop 15 bucks on it and I'm confident that on Tuesday whatever more they add to the bundle it'll be even more worth it."
patientgamers,3bcg5r,ShellWithMe,4,Sun Jun 28 01:21:47 2015 UTC,"I am answering OP which wants BL2. For all I know they already have BL1 or don't want it.  75% discount on a game you probably don't want to play is pointless. As is the 25% discount. That's promotion for them, that's all.  For someone looking to get into BL2, until HB updates there ""what else is there"" part, I'd drop $9.49-$9.99 and get all the good stuff.   You are exchanging, currently, Tiny Tina's for the Special #5 pack and UVH #2 when comparing GOTY vs HB set up. (And what I consider to be irrelevant value to OP). And paying an extra $7 (which can easily cover the cost of both those things and then some).  If OP wants to play BL1, then get HB. Get Ned and Knoxx which are great.  They got until Tuesday to see what HB has on tap :]"
patientgamers,3bcg5r,IdeaPowered,2,Sun Jun 28 01:30:15 2015 UTC,I'm assuming they're new to Borderlands as a whole as most people actually start with Borderlands 2. I do agree though the beat the average deal/bundle is a little pointless unless you're wanting to donate to the Video Game Museum.
patientgamers,3bcg5r,ShellWithMe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly think getting either BL1 +2 xp packs is more than enough Borderlands for most for a good long while.  Or BL2 GOTY. So much to do and it isn't that much different from BL1.  As this is patient gamer, get what you want and pay what you are willing. These games go on offer every other month and will just get cheaper.  I forget which retailer actually had BL2 complete (actually included everything but the cosmetic junk) and it was ~$12 I think.  Fun games :] I think the scaling difficulty makes it real boring once you get to the end of the game twice. Just... slagtasticly boring."

That being said, if the GOTY isn't much more expensive than the base game, get it. You won't be disappointed in any of the DLC content or either of the classes. That Tiny Tina DLC makes the whole game worth playing. :)"
patientgamers,3bcg5r,aniafaery,7,Sat Jun 27 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"I got the GOTY during a sale for around $8 and I honestly haven't sunk more than 10 hours into it.  I would say that if you really, really liked the first game, then it's definitely worth picking up the GOTY, but I personally found the game a little grindy for my tastes and I find the sense of humour a little forced.  If you've already checked out some Let's Plays or whatever and you know that you'll enjoy the base games, then I would say that you should pick up the GOTY for the DLC. Two extra character classes are always pretty fun, and if the gameplay/sense of humour is up your alley, then the DLC is just more of what you'll enjoy."

I really liked the first Borderlands, but I think that lately my tastes have just moved away from run-and-gun style games and towards story-focused games and strategy games.   I've actually gotten really bored with the Witcher 3 because of the back-and-forth between the great quests and hunts. I really enjoy the story and the writing, and the world feels very atmospheric, but I feel like I'm spending as much time riding Roach to fast-travel points as I am fighting monsters.  I've probably sunk around 50-60 hours into the game, and I definitely enjoyed the first 40 or so, but the past few times I've played, I just haven't felt sucked in. I've gotten to the point where I'm wondering if this is going to be a standard monster-hunt sidequest or if there's going to be some interesting dialogue. It's still a great game, but it's starting to feel a little padded out to me."
patientgamers,3bcg5r,forkinanoutlet,2,Sun Jun 28 01:08:02 2015 UTC,"I actually really enjoy riding Roach, and I rarely use the fast travel points.  I like that she kinda follows roads on her own (when she's not glitching out) and I can watch the beautiful scenery roll by."
patientgamers,3bcg5r,reverendfrag4,2,Sun Jun 28 01:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like how she handles on roads, though she's kind of weird in forests and stuff.  I feel like open-world games have gotten almost too big for me, though. My first impression when they said that the world was bigger than Skyrim was to wonder how full it was going to be. And it's very full, to be sure, but it doesn't quite feel balanced. Like, there's literally no reason to go back to the first world after the prologue, or to go back to the castle save for a quest point or two. There's a decent amount of back and forth between Velen, Novigrad and Skellige, but I don't like finishing a quest in Skellige, then having to fast travel to Novigrad just to collect my reward. That feels kind of padded to me.  It's still a fantastic game and I don't regret paying full price for it, but now that the hype has died down a bit, it's a lot easier to see the flaws in what is otherwise a great game.  I've been playing through Sleeping Dogs, and I think that they did a really good job with having an open world that feels really tight, full, and fun to travel through. One of the best examples of turning travel-padding into an atmosphere-building experience has to be Shadow of the Colossus. Spending 15 minutes riding from one end of the map to the other doesn't feel like game padding precisely because the world is so quiet, yet alive. The long, almost soothing horse-rides from boss to boss serve to highlight how massive and majestic the Colossi actually are.  The landscapes in Witcher 3 are gorgeous, and there were definitely times where I thought ""Wow, that's amazing,"" but I feel like it eventually became a huge chore when I actually wanted to focus on the main questline."

patientgamers,3bcg5r,Muhon,2,Sun Jun 28 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"GOTY edition really adds a ton more hours of gameplay into Borderlands 2. And Borderlands 2 is already a great game to begin with so having more story and experiences is well great. Not to mention it adds new characters which only serves to expand the replayability of an already replayable game.  As for the DLC here are my opinions on them:   Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty - It is a decent DLC and while it isn't exactly piratesque it is still a good amount of fun to be had. The humor is alright and you will enjoy some of the combat. However, if you are expecting seafaring waters and the like well hate to disappoint but there isn't any of that there. Mr. Torque's Campaign of Carnage - This one was pretty funny in my opinion. If you like a racing theme, explosions, a guy who yells a lot, and a good amount of that gun play then this is the DLC for you. I especially found Torque hilarious beyond belief and it makes fun of certain things. However, it isn't the best out of the four but it is a pretty good one. Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt - This DLC is universally hated for a good reason. You will through a swamp killing animals and african tribes. The thing that made this horrible was the story wasn't rememberable, the setting was dark and bleak instead of vibrant, also, it just feels like a grind rather than something you would want to complete. I mean hell there isn't even any humor in that. The only thing that kept my sanity alive was comparing it to Resident Evil 5 when I played this with a friend. Regardless the only thing it does well is add more hours of gameplay and more weapons. Also, this was a wasted opportunity to set it in the Savannah, we could hunt animals that have been mutated or even just hunt realistic animals and we could have helped the african tribes which has a lot of humor potential. Instead we get a bleak piece of crap that feels more like it needs to be rushed through instead of enjoyed. Tiny Tina's Assasult on Dragon Keep - This is the best DLC for a reason. Do you like Dungeons and dragons? Do you like shooting down fantasy enemies? Do you like Roland sounding black as hell? This DLC is for you then since it is pretty much like a D&D run. Also, the story of this is just right on point and it is gripping. Honestly, I recommend you play this last because it just makes a grand experience even grander. I mean I can't find anything wrong with this except maybe the story could have been slightly better which I won't spoil except for those who played the DLC. Spoiler   As for characters:   Mechromancer Pack - So this character is a fun character for use. If you like having a robot which can damage enemies while you shoot them then she is your gal. Also, she has a ton of personality and even more so when you spec into the third skill tree. I especially love her echos and learning about her. Disclaimer though she was the first character I played as and I even bought the cyber punk skin which made her look awesome. However, a couple of her skills don't scale well into the late game but she is still a lot of fun to play and if you spec into the first skill tree it will be easier for you to play through. The last tree is pretty much a risk vs reward type deal and she is one of the more overpowered characters out there. Psycho Pack - I never played him as much so I am not too familiar with skills and the like. But if you like setting yourself on fire for no reason at all and benefitting from the pain of it all as well as explosions then the psycho is the best for you.   I recommend getting the humble bundle since you will get a lot of stuff coming your way that can really add to that wallet of yours. It is great value to a game that has been out for 3 years and is still thriving."
patientgamers,3bcg5r,aa223,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:55:51 2015 UTC,"I commented further down with my thoughts on the DLC as a whole, but you pretty much completely nailed it.  I played as Krieg/Psycho after a few runs on main characters. He was pretty fun once you got towards level 30...lots of insane stuff his skill points can do. I pretty much ignored the self-burning skill tree if I remember correctly. Turning into a Badass Psycho and mowing down enemies was glorious.  If you like the hack-and-slash style of playing, Krieg is your guy."

patientgamers,3bcg5r,imnotlegolas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"Boderlands 1 you can play in pretty much any order you want, although I'd recommend completing the main storyline first.  If you play all the DLC, it's basically impossible to not to out-level the game at some point, however, so be warned.  Borderlands 2 can, again, be played in pretty much any order you want, although I recommend completing the main story mission before the DLC.  Again, you'll be over-leveled if you finish everything.  However one major caveat:  If you want to reach max level in Borderlands 2, then I vehemently recommend that you finish the main story line and unlock New Game+ as soon as you can.  Borderlands 1 is linear progression, but Borderlands 2 is exponential.  At the end of the regular playthrough, the enemies and loot will be max level of 30-34 or so.  If you're beyond that when you start Borderlands 2 New Game+, you'll be screwed because in New Game+ everything scales with your character's level.   I made this mistake with my first character.  I was over level 40 or so by the time I finished the first playthrough.  You basically can't advance in NG+ fighting level 43-44 enemies with gear from low level 30.  If you don't switch over quickly enough, you'll brick wall your progression.  I hit the boss you have to pass that gets you access to the hub city of the game, and there's no way I can kill it.  It basically ruined that character for me, and it's totally not obvious that it's going to happen.  Overall, I wouldn't plan on playing BL2 New Game+ unless you really, really like the game.  They pull the same shit that Diablo did in Hell difficulty, where everything was resistant and you have to have very specific gear elements and weapon builds just to be able to progress.  Honestly, it's just not that fun.  New Game+ is focused almost exclusively on multiplayer boss rushing.  It's the same Diablo/MMO style gear grinding.  That's about as far from fun as it gets for me."

patientgamers,3bcg5r,danceyoufool,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"As a longterm fan of the series, 100% achievement completion on both main games (and a few Pre-Sequel playthroughs), I'll weigh in on the downloadable content for Borderlands 2:  The DLC campaigns (excluding the two new classes, which are great) for Borderlands 2 is complete garbage...with the very distinct exception of Tiny Tina's Assault on Dungeon Keep. The rest of them are amusing enough and usually center on a forgettable NPC, but the stories are weak, the bosses are crap, and they did very little for me or most of the Borderlands fans I know. Unless you love bullet-sponge raid bosses...which are great when you have a truly epic fight, like Crawmerax from the first game. They just shoved a few boring ones into this one with ZOMG EPICZ1024 LOOTZORZ! and they're pretty lame.  DLC is my main pain point with the Borderlands franchise. They put together fun games and then absolutely drop the ball when it comes to fun DLC. Sure, you might enjoy them the first time around (in the 3-4 hours it takes you to complete any of them), but there's basically zero replayability.  The first game had some stellar DLC. The zombie campaign was an amusing twist, the Underdome was fun for the intro fights until the absolute shit-tacular grindfests (but gave us Moxxi at least), the General Knoxx one was the pinnacle of Borderlands DLC altogether, and then the Robot Revolution was spectacularly comical and a loving final nod back to the best parts of the game.  In contrast, Borderlands 2's DLC was self-referential garbage filled that lacked any of the fun, had stupid stories centered around somewhat boring bit characters, and were blatant cash-grabs. With better writing they would have flourished.  But definitely play Tiny Tina, and in New Game+. It's a D&D love affair that's hilarious and just WORKS.  YMMV."

I find myself checking this chart any time I'm thinking of buying a new card.  Note that the chart is always being updated (for new cards), but tomshardware makes a new link for each one.  So you have to google for the most recent charts.  If the card you're looking for is too new to be on the list (and unfortunately, laptop chipsets are often missing), google for the card name, find some benchmarks and look at the cards that they compare against and find something very close ... and then check for that card on the list.  This is a rather imprecise method unless you check lots of different benckmarks, but it gets you in the ballpark.  And doing all that ... the 840M seems pretty decent for a laptop, seeming to basically be close to ""Iris Pro Graphics 6200"" on the chart."

I'm still in high school though and next year I'm off my way to university, which sorta requires some portability. My dad basically said: if you want a desktop, go for it, but we won't help a dime. So in essence, if I go for a notebook, I have way bigger budget ($800 as opposed to $300). That's pretty much the only reason why I'm getting a notebook.

Games I play are mostly in the 2000-year age: think Baldur's Gate, Civilization III, Heroes of Might & Magic III, Quake III. Stuff like KotOR works on this setup as well. It's totally because of the bricks I've been stuck with for ages, but I'd be amazed by even The Witcher 1 with its graphics or whatever was the game around that time. I defo don't need latest Battlefield/Call of Duty/any current crap. The things I need are: SSD (for audio data streaming in real-time - film scoring, orchestral sound libraries and the like) and CPU (REALLY intensive audio processing, including both synthesis and effects: I do electronic music as well). I didn't really even think of a GPU at all, it's here just because the laptop has one, and I'd happily take whatever is in here as long as it's NVIDIA (because I want to Hackintosh + Win8.1 and AMD is a no-go for that). Of course a GPU is a nice touch, always helps with random (think: once a year or less) video editing, simple Photoshop works (making cover arts for my music without waiting hours), Android development (specifically, hardware-accelerated Android emulator). And finally I'll be able to play Team Fortress 2 (without being at 20 FPS in 640x480, or less whenever someone fires a rocket). I have some great games that've been waiting for the upgrade like The Witcher 1&2, Nail'd, Mass Effect, Gothic 3, F.E.A.R., Dragon Age: Origins, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger or BattleBlock Theater.

Later ones were much more linear - go here, kill this person etc. The first gave much more freedom in achieving the goal. The ""blade in the crowd"" achievement was a load of fun to do as it required planning and patience.

Think of it more as an 'interlude' in terms of exciting gameplay moments. I spent the whole game waiting for the action to kick off and it never really happened for me.

They did mention Ben Franklin's thing for fucking old women, though.  They get points there.

patientgamers,3b85kw,V2Blast,2,Sat Jun 27 05:13:06 2015 UTC,The improvement from I to II was the biggest. Since III the improvements stopped and the publisher noticed the money milking machine they created. So they stopped caring all around and now the series is shit from III forward.
patientgamers,3b85kw,henriquemhz,3,Sat Jun 27 12:16:05 2015 UTC,IV was definitely not shit.  I even enjoyed Unity but I'm sure I'm in the minority on that
patientgamers,3b85kw,imnotlegolas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:19:53 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Unity. Probably not as much as II or Brotherhood, but aside from the bugginess at release, it wasn't bad. I didn't like IV, though, as I don't enjoy any of the naval stuff."
patientgamers,3b85kw,Messcan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Really? It's funny in III I put off doing any naval missions because I thought they would suck.  Kept hearing people rave about them and I kept putting it off, didn't want to jump on the bandwagon.  Well, I finally did them and actually enjoyed it which I found surprising.  Sorry you didn't like that stuff.  I will say I think it was kind of a weird direction to take the series.  I would have preferred another AC Brotherhood/Revelations type game instead of something ground breaking.  Turned out alright though, overall a good experience to have.  Too many treasure chests out there.  And sharks.  Fuck those sharks with a 20 ft pole"
patientgamers,3b85kw,V2Blast,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did one of the naval missions in AC3 and just really hated it so I never did all of them. Then IV came out and I was wary but I figured I love the franchise, so I should get it. Terrible idea--and I usually play on PC but I got it on Xbox in case that would help somehow. Nope. Still haven't finished it.   Beautiful game, and I can see why people liked it, especially as they made another in the same vein, but I couldn't stand it. It didn't help that the main reason I loved II so much (and to an extent, I) was the story and the Assassins and how it all tied in to modern day, and they pretty much tore that out and the game was just about some pirate guy who sailed around way too much.   I was so relieved to play Unity--it kind of felt like I was playing an Assassin's Creed game again."
patientgamers,3b85kw,ZorbaTHut,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"you've only played three? it is definitely not representative of the series, the Ezio trilogy is one of my favorite gaming experiences."

patientgamers,3b85kw,bennn30,2,Fri Jun 26 23:53:01 2015 UTC,"You should give it one more chance. AC4 was the best game in the series I've played (I didn't play Unity onward yet) and I really enjoyed AC3 too, contrary to the popular opinion."
patientgamers,3b85kw,imnotlegolas,2,Sat Jun 27 10:48:07 2015 UTC,"Heh, I kinda felt the same way, though my reason for not playing an AC since is just that I haven't gone out of my way to get AC3 or 4 (Black Flag) on sale since then. Though now that I have a decent computer, I'll probably get it next time it's on sale on Steam."
patientgamers,3b85kw,john_drake,2,Sat Jun 27 15:25:37 2015 UTC,AC2 is one of those games I wish I'd never played so I could play for the first time all over again. Brotherhood is also a high point in the series.
patientgamers,3b85kw,swxrice,2,Fri Jun 26 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"I tried playing the first one, because I hate jumping in the middle of a series from a game. Will I miss anything out story wise if I start 2 instead?"
patientgamers,3b85kw,Schreddor,3,Sat Jun 27 05:22:46 2015 UTC,"Not really, no. 99% of the plot is new. There's some continuation of the present-day, wrap around plot... but the game opens with a quick recap montage."
patientgamers,3b85kw,swxrice,2,Sat Jun 27 06:31:27 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong with brotherhood. A few things are tweaked but it makes the game a lot better imo, plus it continues with the great story."
patientgamers,3b85kw,TJourney,3,Sat Jun 27 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"The first game kind of introduces the basics of the plot, but it has some serious gameplay flaws (it's super-repetitive). AC2 is basically an improvement in every way.  So by definition you will miss some aspects of the larger plot if you start with AC2, but if you don't care about the story then it doesn't really matter."
patientgamers,3b85kw,TJourney,2,Sat Jun 27 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"Bad news, yes; 2 continues a totally awesome plotline that they started in 1.  Good news, though, it doesn't matter. That entire plotline was essentially abandoned after 2."
patientgamers,3b85kw,69ingChipmunkzz,2,Sat Jun 27 14:48:49 2015 UTC,I felt like the point of playing 1 was just to get to the very end where you use your sight in present day.
patientgamers,3b85kw,Lereas,2,Sat Jun 27 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"In my opinion you should see the cut scenes.  So maybe youtube them or something.  I say that because of A) the plot line, it is entirely relevant with the rest of the series and B) the final parts of the story of the first game pertain to a big part of the rest of the series' story."
patientgamers,3b85kw,samcuu,2,Sat Jun 27 18:36:04 2015 UTC,"Damn, okay. I tried the first but had a hard time getting into it. I was hoping 2 is different for me since everyone is crazy about it."

patientgamers,3b85kw,doomketu,2,Sat Jun 27 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"There was a change in the direction of game in AC 3 that had a huge impact on the quality of writing. The story was originally supposed to be a trilogy, but Ubisoft was making so much cash that they decided to extend it. The writers managed to make the first extension plausible (splitting II into its own trilogy), but the way III was replanned to make the series continue indefinitely was really off putting for me."
patientgamers,3b85kw,Rockerouter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:48:32 2015 UTC,"Care to explain? I have played only Black Flag from the entire series, so far, and plan on playing Rogue next. Am I missing out on pivotal plot elements that way?"
patientgamers,3b85kw,blakeismyhomeboy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"[Spoilers]  That might have been a stronger warning than necessary. I have no idea about the story since 3; I haven't picked up any of them. It was set up for a very major climax at the end of 3 about the literal destruction of the world and domination by the Templars. The ending was meant to be the total conquest of one side by the other where we find that Desmond used the knowledge of the Ancients (or whatever they're called) to stop Abstergo and protect Earth from a huge natural disaster, and instead the ending was a cliffhanger where only one of those things happened maybe.  It felt to me very much like 80% of the game story was written with the intent of closing the series, possibly before Revelations was even released, and then the producers insisted that they reloosen the ends to leave space for more sequels. They had a very nice, strong, and tight story to tell, and I found it very compelling, then they broke it all to pieces to shoehorn in more games under the same brand. The way 3 ended was so disappointing that it turned me off from the series."
patientgamers,3b85kw,Kwizkey,2,Sat Jun 27 18:19:25 2015 UTC,"I liked Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed 2 enough, but I've been worried of the series getting too watered down by all of the (yearly?) sequels it quickly spawned.  Does this mean we can expect a Game Time playthrough of some of the games soon? Honestly, I'd probably be more interested in Brotherhood (that is the one which follows AC2, right?) after seeing one of your LPs for it."

patientgamers,3b85kw,-ParticleMan-,2,Sat Jun 27 13:33:34 2015 UTC,The first game has cinematic angles during the cut scenes of you press any button when that glitch happens.  Discovering that changed the game for me.  It also has the most assasiny feel.
patientgamers,3b85kw,BooeyBaba,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"Well, it changed the angle from one wide to another wideshot. Still never close enough to actually see someone's face. I played through the entire game, and still wasn't sure if the guy at the ""Assassin's Bureau"" was three different people, or what."
patientgamers,3b85kw,-ParticleMan-,2,Sat Jun 27 22:13:38 2015 UTC,2 is the best in the series which has been run to the ground. If cheap get brotherhood and revelations. 3 is basically a 6 hour I tro before the good part of the game. Playit solely for closure.
patientgamers,3b85kw,supertoned,2,Sat Jun 27 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"I think the first game's mistake was to reveal Desmond too quickly, if they waited until halfway through the game that would have been a really cool plot twist."

I do agree, AC2 gave me one of the most genuinely fun experiences I've had in a long time. Some people will say that 3 wasn't as good, but man am I having a blast! They keep improving the combat along with all the other game mechanics."
patientgamers,3b85kw,Niamriva,2,Sat Jun 27 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"Just started back on AC2. Fantastic game set in some gorgeous places. I put Ezio's story alongside the greats like Master Chief in Halo.   The only thing negative to say is that I wish AC2 updated the game mechanics to be more like it's successors Brotherhood and Revelations, both of which I suggest to anyone on the Ezio storyline.  Assassins Creed died out to me after Ezio and I haven't bought any of the newer games. His games still feel very, very modern and are very cheap."
patientgamers,3b85kw,passworduno,2,Sat Jun 27 15:15:46 2015 UTC,I've also overlooked the AC series and have not played any of them yet!  The series has never appealed to me but AC4 did look decent and it got great reviews so it got me interested in the series again.  I'll have to check out at least AC2 which can be found anywhere for a couple of bucks nowadays
patientgamers,3b85kw,ShaidarHaran2,2,Sat Jun 27 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"AC2 basically fixed everything from the first game and continued to add to the story. After that, the broader story with Desmond gets a bit convoluted in Brotherhood and Revelations (I haven't played AC3 or AC4:BF yet), but the gameplay itself remains quite solid.  I hear that AC3's kinda meh, but Black Flag is supposed to be good."
patientgamers,3b85kw,RisingRapture,2,Sat Jun 27 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's the thing about the sequels: they are really inconsistent in quality.  Brotherhood is a safe bet, as most (including myself) agree that it's the best game in the series.  Does everything that AC2 did well, plus adds a few more features that only improve the game.  Also has a great story, gorgeous setting, fun modern-day segments, etc.  Revelations... it tries some things that don't work out.  The color scheme in Revelations is surprisingly bland, which doesn't really work well for the series, and Constantinople never really lives up to its promise as a setting.  Also, the bomb-making and tower defense modes are just completely unnecessary.  Hookblade's nice though, wish it came back in the sequels.  Assassin's Creed 3 is, in my mind, among the best and the worst AC games.  It has some really memorable characters, TRULY excellent modern-day sequences (seriously, they're the best part of the game), gorgeous settings, and fun ship combat segments.  Unfortunately, stealth is much harder in some ways while combat is easier, so you feel somewhat less like an Assassin and more like a warrior.  The ending (without spoiling it exactly) is also bullcrap and sets up the unfavorable status quo seen in the three most recent AC games, Unity, Black Flag, and Rogue.  Black Flag is a gorgeous game with a gorgeous setting and a ton of the ship combat that was introduced in Assassins Creed 3.  It's also the single most boring AC game I've played yet.  The modern-day segments are... well, they frankly should have just been removed entirely.  Boring in the extreme.  The protagonist is not particularly multi-layered, as he's just a straight-up greedy pirate for the vast majority of the game.  It is literally as though you are playing as an ascended henchman.  There's very little ""Assassin"" in this game and a whole lot of ""pirate"".  That's just my opinion though: a lot of people seem to love BF, and it is a lot of fun to hear the Sea Shanties (Running Down to Cuba is my jam).  Rogue and Unity.  I have not played either game, Rogue because it just looks like an even smaller version of Black Flag, but in a different setting, and Unity because my PC can't even run games that appeared on last-gen consoles like the PS3.  If I manage to get a better PC or a PS4, I might rent Unity."
patientgamers,3b85kw,mltronic,2,Sat Jun 27 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"1,2, brotherhood, and revelations are incredible. Stop playing after that."
patientgamers,3b85kw,mltronic,2,Sat Jun 27 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"Assassin's Creed was kind of limited, but I think it did what it was trying to do supremely well. The games kind of blur together for me, and I'm not going to pretend like nostalgia doesn't color my perceptions, but I think the first one was my favorite. I loved so much the way that you would have that extended conversation about their motives with the guy you just killed, and the way that it added a sense of ambiguity as to whether you were doing the right thing or not. Yeah, it didn't make any sense, and there wasn't really any context by which those conversations could have taken place, but I don't care, they were so cool!"
patientgamers,3b85kw,smashedfinger,2,Sat Jun 27 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"Grabbed 1, 2, 3, Brotherhood, Revolutions, liberation and black flag for around Â£25 all told, less than one of them cost new on steam.  Gave 1 a play years ago and couldn't get into it so I never gave the franchise another look till the 80% sale. So far I've played black flag for a bit and other than the annoying forced ""we're multicultural, honest we're not creating a game with hatred"" overtone Its an ok game. Iffy controls with some fluidity problems free running but otherwise enjoyable."
patientgamers,3b85kw,donwallo,5,Sat Jun 27 19:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Definitely fun games.  I strongly suggest people skip 1, it's basically unfinished DLC or something.  A very finite pool of missions played in repeating order and slowly unlocking regions.  More of a tech demo than anything."

Makes the game completely playable and stable with added mods like Project Nevada, Nevada Skies, etc working on both games. If you want to play only FO3 then go ahead but this is one way of making the game work. Just find the correct patches and what is useable with TTW and it works perfectly. Of course this is PC only but it's the only platform with stability issues.

It's fine if you are curious in regards to personal preference about a game such as ""I didn't like Dragon Age 2, is Dragon age 3 worth giving the series another chance"" but saying ""Red Dead Redemption is 0.25 should I get it?"" without any context is just a upvote trap for fans of the game.  Suggested new rules:   Sales posts are fine as long as there is context as to why the sale price is relevant eg: ""Rome Total War 2 was awful at launch but has it been patched enough now to justify 15$?"" Game Sales posts as prediscussions such as ""Mass Effect is 2$ There will be a discussion post 1 week from today for anybody playing it for the first time Otherwise we could completely ban all sales posts reference"
patientgamers,3b51vo,Whatah,147,Fri Jun 26 01:14:56 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right; context is the defining factor here. Questions like ""Should I get Mass Effect 3 even though I haven't played the other ones?"" or ""I didn't like x about Mass Effect 2, will I like Mass Effect 3?"" are questions that foster valuable, substantial discussion. Questions like ""I heard Mass Effect is good, should I get it for cheap as balls?"" do not foster good discussion as it's information that can be gleaned from a google search.   The only exception to this rule of thumb would be games that are kind of old and potentially might not have aged well. Like, if someone asked if they should get Shenmue 1 and 2 I'd probably say no because even though they're praised, they're very wonky and gross looking by today's standards.   I agree with the first two of your bullet points, but I think that sales threads still have their place, unless the discount is like 10% (in which case, fuck off, because 10% shouldn't be a deciding factor for you to buy a game)."
patientgamers,3b51vo,Dr_Explosion,13,Fri Jun 26 02:34:30 2015 UTC,"Another way to look at it... I happen to have ME2 because I got it as part of a Humble Bundle, But I have not played it because I hope someday to buy a version with all relevant DLC for a good price. In some ways selling ME2 for super cheap is like the razor and the blades analogy as long as the DLCs remains rarely discounted. Maybe I will have to wait for a full remake of the entire series (and then for it to go down in price) until I see the day the FULL game hits the $10 or less pricepoint. Looking at the Mass Effect Wiki there is a surprisingly large amount of DLC and ""promotional content"" listed. Makes it hard for a new player to understand which comes with what versions and which actually add to the story."

patientgamers,3b51vo,kaeroku,7,Fri Jun 26 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, imo that is often something to consider for this subreddit when it comes to base versions of excellent games going on HUGE discount.

Almost every time someone makes a ""Skyrim for < $10"" post many of the comments advise people to pay a little more for the Legendary Edition. Whatever rule changes are made we need to retain the ability to provide this bit of advice."

I agree that context such as ""has it been patched enough"" is good, but I also think that for some people, certain games just aren't necessarily a good fit. I don't mind if someone posts saying ""I like games that have X qualities, such as Y1, Y2, and Y3. Do you think I will enjoy game Z, now that it's on sale?""  Preferably, people would downvote it when it's really obvious, for example if someone were to say ""I really enjoyed FIFA10, FIFA11, and PES 5. Will I enjoy FIFA12?"" or something similarly obvious, but sometimes it isn't quite as obvious, and the person has genuine reason to wonder if it's worth it or not for them."
patientgamers,3b51vo,Zagorath,5,Fri Jun 26 12:35:06 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your ""use the downvotes"" stance. Light moderation is the best kind of moderation.   I think there are cases where it's appropriate to ask anyway. An example: 'I could not get into Fallout 3 at all. However, the Fallout 4 hype has me interested. Is New Vegas worth trying if I already tried 3 and did not like it?'  Another example: 'The Game of the Year edition of Arkham Asylum only is $17, should I try it' is probably weak. Like you said, though, we can just downvote it. With a little expanding, though, it becomes this: 'I hated the movie The Dark Knight. The Game of the Year edition of Arkham Asylum only is $17, should I try it?' Now there's reason to make it worth asking.   Hell, even 'I have a download code for Guacamelee but I am running out of hard drive space on my Wii U. Is it worth downloading even if I may have to delete something I paid for?' That's a situation where I could even see it being fair to ask if it's worth getting a game without having to spend money.  Anyone who didn't think those were worthy discussions could downvote them, but I see why they may be fair questions for some to ask. Thank you for your stance on this."
patientgamers,3b51vo,greatestname,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely agree with this. Just because a game is critically acclaimed and really cheap, doesn't mean it's worth it for everyone. So allowing people to provide some context for other relevant games or other media that they enjoyed or didn't enjoy, and ask whether it's worth it for them.  People can use their own judgement to decide whether they think the context is so obvious or so irrelevant that it's not worthy of discussion, and downvote if so."

The problem is that posts such as, ""Is Fallout 3 worth $5?"", are nothing more than asking for reviews.  That information is widely available and with less effort than making a post on reddit.

When XCOM 2 was announced, XCOM: Enemy Within and the expansion pack came on sale (before the summer sale, like a month ago or something like that). I bought it because I've been eyeing EW and the Long War mod for a while even though I haven't played the game in over a year or two.  So I bought it for like $16 then and lo and behold, the summer sale comes up and it is like $12. I couldn't be bothered to try for an adjustment plus I wanted it for a while anyway but found it too expensive (I think it was like 35). I didn't spend a dime in the sale though because I already have games I haven't played yet."

It went back to normal after and then in the summer sale it went down by just a little bit further. I just checked it again now, it's actually $50 for Enemy Within. I saved $34 but fuck me for not foreseeing that it would be in the summer sale at all or that it would get even lower right? For all I know it could have gotten the bullshit -10% treatment at the summer sale and I would have missed out on a good price for a game that I actually wanted.  I was concerned over blowing another 20-50 dollars on the summer sale after that on a whim when I barely have time to play games as it is anyway. I'll just get something the next year or whatever.  I argued from the point of me having this game in mind for a while and waiting for a significant price reduction (the expansion itself is nearly 2 years old now, the price point now is pretty steep to be honest). What I'm saying is it doesn't matter if you're missing out on a few dollars when you got the game you wanted on a deal anyway, just because it went on sale again for slightly less. If I had bought it for full price (which I wouldn't because 50 bucks for a game this old is pretty rich imo) and then it drops by like 80% or something crazy you bet your ass I'll try for some kind of adjustment."

IGN mentioned the game in one of their podcasts discussing overrated  games."

When I come on here and I see any post about Bioshock, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, or ANYTHING from the PS2 era, I get excited to just share my thoughts on games I've loved. It's always fun to see others experiencing those games for the first time. And it's fun to read people's suggestions and share their experiences with the inexperienced.  Also, not everyone has been a member of this sub for a long time. They may have heard mixed reviews on some games (i.e. like watching TotalBiscuit's review of Bioshock Infinite and thinking maybe it's not very good --- SPOILER ALERT: it's incredible!!!).  So I have no problem with people asking if a game is good and worth buying. It's not just the cost, but the time/fun ratio as well. Just because a game is cheap doesn't mean it's always worth your time to play. I see nothing wrong with new comers (aka PATIENT GAMERS) asking for fellow gamers' opinions, regardless of what Metacritic or IGN have to say."

patientgamers,3b51vo,stemgang,4,Fri Jun 26 09:57:34 2015 UTC,"I would disagree. Even if a game is universally acclaimed, you still may not like it.  The point is to know yourself. Know what you like and dislike in games. Be very, very picky with what you spend your time on.  For myself, AmuseDeath, I'm not a fan of RPGs as I find they take too long to finish and their combat is boring. I don't like sports games, nor do I like racing games. I also dislike most FPS games. I probably dislike most games out there actually.  A game getting good ratings is good, but what's more important is that it's a game that passes my own requirements."

Calling them motherfuckers for having a different sense of value is not fair. I suggest down voting the posts you do not want to see and do not comment on them. Others may enjoy the discussion.

Just take it as an opportunity to talk about why you liked the game. I agree though, I hate what this sub has become as well. People are just saying to discuss games instead of asking whether to buy it, but they don't' realize those two things are essentially the same.

patientgamers,3b51vo,NekoiNemo,3,Fri Jun 26 11:10:39 2015 UTC,"just google the fucking game if you want to know whether it's good   Minor correction though: Google is never a very good source for finding relevant game reviews, since it tends to prioritize positive reviews over unfavorable ones.  You can add the ""inurl:forum"" at the end of a google search to get results with forum discussions, but the top results will still be mostly ads, because some (paid-for) review sites started adding the word ""forum"" to their review URLs.  Metacritic and other similar sites (Amazon) that allow user reviews are always better than Google.  That being said, I don't think anyone here is going to be able to tell others which games they should or should not play, even if more context (preferences for specific genres, previously played games etc.) is provided.  In my personal opinion, sometimes, not even playing official demos of a game can tell you what the full, final game will be like, so how's anyone else who played the game going to be able to convince you whether it is good or not?"
patientgamers,3b51vo,VorpalAuroch,3,Fri Jun 26 12:13:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, but i don't mind as long as there is some context outside of that.

The hard drive space is, too. Is a ""highly rated"" 30 hour game really worth $5 and 10 gigs of hard drive space if you only play it for a few hours, or if you force yourself through all 30 despite not liking it very much? Especially since most of us have steam backlogs big enough to last a lifetime as it is, 30 hours of ""quality"" is a waste of money if it's not good enough that we're going to want to install and play it as soon as we get it."

patientgamers,3b51vo,michaelfarker,2,Fri Jun 26 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"In general I don't understand some people's aversion to googling/searching. Waiting for a reply is invariably longer than  searching for a gameplay video or review.  Watching a gameplay video is one of the best ways of judging if a game looks worthy of purchasing. I'm genuinely curious why they don't just search.   One of the more warped behaviors of our times is our cultures' relationship to 'value'. This is especially true with gaming. Comparing gaming to other forms of entertainment such as going to the cinema or buying/renting movies, shows how much value per dollar/euro etc. even a newly released AAA title provides. An over abundance of entertainment seems to have really depreciated its value. I love bundles and sales, but they definitely affect people's perception of a game's worth.   I wonder how the industry will look in the future. After a recent spate of AAA releases being laden with bugs, is pre-ordering down? Have bundles and sales affected sales of games? With an abundance of games, and I presume, most PC gamers having a ever increasing backlog, are more and more gamers just waiting for sales? As ownership becomes less important for the majority (see TV, movies and music), what influence will this have gaming?  I remembering reading in this subreddit somewhere that 'if you're going to play a game now or in the near future buy it, if not keep on waiting.'  That really is good advice."
patientgamers,3b51vo,Hitch42,2,Sun Jun 28 09:23:38 2015 UTC,Pro Tip: Use tools like Enhanced Steam for Chrome to get a better idea of what the price history is like for the game you're interested in.

And while $5 for a game won't break me I do stick to a budget so games I play for a few minutes and hate are worth avoiding.

patientgamers,3b51vo,NekoiNemo,4,Fri Jun 26 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"Nope. That's absolutely legitimate question worth asking and answering.  FF7 is exactly as you described, BUT it looks like shit, has boring and dull gameplay compared to modern RPGs (or almost any jRPG for that matter) and it's story and world were only that ""great"" in context of the time it was released - in modern world it's mediocre at best.   Skyrim, Fallout 3, Deus Ex HR - critically acclaimed and ""loved by everyone"", but if someone asks ""i loved previous games from this series - should i buy this one?"" answer will be - no, no you shouldn't. Despite being well received those games are exact opposite of the previous games and you'll just waste your money if you liked previous ones.   Metroid Prime - awesome critically acclaimed game and so on, but person asking for opinion on getting it should be made aware that he might want to get something else it if he doesn't like slow first person shooters.  Last of Us - same situation in terms of reputation. Should he buy it? Only if he liked similar games otherwise he might be better just watching the cutscenes on youtube since gameplay itself is very very shallow.  Deus Ex - one of the best games ever made. ""should i get it?"" asked by someone who liked HR and other modern games should probably be answered with ""no"" since it's a lot more deep, non-linear and complex than any modern game. Same deal with System Shock 1/2 - they both are masterpieces who defined an entire sub-genre, but both aged terribly and no amount of modding can fix it. Person asking should be made well aware of that fact.  Tl;dr: Please, don't push your personal opinion on other people. It's not as simple as your one-track mind make it appear to you. People come here to get actual advice on what game to get to enjoy it, not to satisfy someone's ego.  P.S.

patientgamers,3b51vo,NekoiNemo,4,Fri Jun 26 12:30:47 2015 UTC,"No. Skyrim completely reworked Magic, enchantment and alchemy systems (made first nonexistent, second useless and third dumb and oversimplified), removed primary stats, birth signs and classes, reworked and simplified leveling system, dumbed down skill system, added perks, made race an essentially cosmetic difference, replaced more or less decent UI with abominable one. And yes, improved the engine.  Oblivion is a fairly deep Action/RPG, Skyrim is an open-world character action game with some rudimentary RPG elements sprinkled on top for the sake of being able to be called an RPG. Someone who liked Morrowind and Oblivion will not like Skyrim because it will feel to action-driven and shallow. Person who like Skyrim will not like Morrowind and Oblivion because they will most like be overwhelmed by depth and complexity with less action.  Tl;dr: Those games have nothing in common aside from lore."
patientgamers,3b51vo,taw,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:33:58 2015 UTC,"Every game streamlines some old stuff to create space for new stuff. There's complexity limit. So it is completely unavoidable that they'll throw away or simplify some minor stuff.  And as for your examples... levelling in Oblivion was completely broken, the system required some ridiculous minmaxing instead of more natural gameplay in Skyrim, and if you didn't you'd be seeing ridiculously overpowered bandits in ridiculously overpowered gear on every road, which your unminmaxed character couldn't deal with. Just search for any levelling guide, it was pure insanity - and most people just played with mods that fixed it all. Skyrim skill and perk system is just so much more elegant and logical - if someone could backport that to Oblivion as a mod, that would be pure improvement.  I agree on minor point that race is largely cosmetic, which makes very little sense as Skyrim's main storyline conflict is largely about race issues, and that feels wrong.  Anyway, Morrowind / Oblivion was a fairly big gap, but Oblivion / Skyrim is pretty much the same game. They're open world RPGs with some action stuff."
patientgamers,3b51vo,NekoiNemo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:19:41 2015 UTC,"Streamlining is fine, but there's a difference between streamlining and dumbing down.   Making leveling up actually make sense is streamlining, cutting out stats, birth signs, classes and race differences is dumbing down. Making mana regenerate naturally when magic isn't used - streamlining, cutting out magic customization and almost all of the magic effects - dumbing down. Grouping ingredients by the effects they give - streamlining, removing multiple effects per potion/poison, distillation and all that other stuff - dumbing down."
patientgamers,3b51vo,One__upper__,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:24:19 2015 UTC,"But that's not even removed - birth signs were replaced by standing stones, which is infinitely better design because you're not forced to decide before you have any idea what the hell. Put yourself in a position of someone who plays the first time and doesn't alt tab to wiki. What the hell is that even? It's much better to let the player defer the decision until later. I honestly still don't even remember which birth signs I took in Oblivion.  Stats got redistributed into skill and perk system as part of really good streamlining. The only obviously missing one is speed, but that's probably for the better.  Lack of magic customization and race differences were definitely mistakes, can't argue with that. But it's not like Skyrim is a dumbed down game, they made a few questionable choices as always happens as no game is perfect. Fortunately you can work around most such issues with mods - there's plenty of magic and race mods."
patientgamers,3b51vo,NekoiNemo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:35:31 2015 UTC,"I guess birt sings may be the case of taste. I liked them like a part of a character rather than a switchable buff which you need to find first. And you didn't need a wiki - if you didn't use immersive mods that changed signs description it had all of the bonuses listed.  I would argue about stats. They're essential for any RPG as they define more solid and rigid part of character, something you have to work with, they make you character feel more like a... Character. Instead of just being amorphous pile of clay than can be reshaped into anything at any time at the whim of a player. It make it feels like he path you choose matters rather than Skyrim's approach where you can play an entire game as brute and then suddenly go ""fuck it, i'm thief now!"" and start being stealthy without any issues.  With the changes Skyrim made there's no amount of modding that can save magic. There's always stark contrast between native magic and modded one. It feels less laconic, glitches out or makes game world around you glitch because of it, it doesn't feel natural to use it.  Thing about questionable choices is that they usually scrapped after it becomes obvious that they made things worse. But from what i know, it seems that Bethesda decided to roll with those changes. I guess Fallout 4 will show if i'm right or wrong."
patientgamers,3b51vo,One__upper__,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:47:37 2015 UTC,"You can't really go ""fuck it, i'm thief now"" because your perks are locked in unmodded game, so you'd be a really shitty thief.  You start as almost blank slate (unless you play with mods that make race matter - they work really well), but as you go on and make choices you become more and more locked into them. It's more flexible system than deciding who you're going to be before you even start the game.  Well, at least that's how it used to be in base game. 1.9 patch added legendary skills, and Dragonborn DLC allows you to reset skill trees at cost of dragon souls, but these are very late game options with relatively minor relevance."
patientgamers,3b51vo,NekoiNemo,2,Fri Jun 26 10:32:11 2015 UTC,"You absolutely can, since you no longer have stats. Perks are important, but not to the point where lack of them in particular tree would made you unable to play in certain style.

No, buy the new one because theres probably no one in the multiplayer any more and the single player campaigns for those games are always terrible (dying of rad poisoning epic and normandy beach storming aside)  Should I buy <fan favourite shitty console port>? No, unless the port is unusually good and you have some sort of console style controller. Buy an older PC game instead, it won't handle like a juggling donkey with beach balls for legs or run at a weird eye straining frame rate. Even brand new games get these issues - cough Arkham Knight cough  So much in gaming ages terribly. Things which were good which are still good happen a lot, but it's by no means guaranteed."

It's really fun, even though the graphics don't look as great as compared to games nowadays. It has really fun gameplay, a lot of puzzles and exploring. Some parts are pretty tough so don't be ashamed to looking up a guide, especially the Water Temple. You will probably hate the Water Temple. Overall, I recommend it the most. Majora's Mask is the sequel, and I didn't like it as much it's still a good game you should play if you like Ocarina of Time.  And which Kirby game are you talking about? There are several of them on the virtual console. They're a lot of fun, depending which game. If you don't like platformers you won't like them, but if you do you probably will."

patientgamers,3b8igm,rarelypost,5,Fri Jun 26 21:28:01 2015 UTC,You might want to consider Link to the Past as your first Zelda title.  Ocarina of Time and Majora's mask may strike you as a bit old and barren given the types of games that you likely grew up with.  I think the 2D graphics have also aged a bit more gracefully.  LttP is also a bit more 'condensed' game and possibly a better introduction to the series.

I've been a patient gamer for as long as gaming has existed...my brother and I just didn't care to get games as they were released (with the exception of Pokemon...gotta stay up on that!). Instead we waited for the price to drop and slowly worked our way through our collection of cheap games that happened to catch our eye. We didn't get the original Xbox until the 360 had come out. Didn't play FFVII until X was out. It goes on and on.  While this has always been, and will probably always be, my most comfortable way to game, I'm trying to remain focused on one game at a time, simply because I am a perpetual un-finisher. I think the last game I fully completed was Oblivion, haha. I get distracted by side quests to the point where I don't even remember what the main quest is. I play one game a few hours every week, then suddenly remember that other old game I love, get deep into that, and then suddenly remember the first...only it's been so long, I've forgotten the controls and don't have the drive to finish.

patientgamers,3b5o9q,astrower,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:44:42 2015 UTC,I spent $400 on mine 2 years ago and it could run most games on at least medium. Last year I bought a 750 TI for it and now I can mostly max any game that didn't come out in the past year or so.
patientgamers,3b5o9q,Whyyougankme,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:47:57 2015 UTC,I can't mostly max out most games with a 970gtx. Which FPS do you deem playable?
patientgamers,3b5o9q,ChrisOfAllTrades,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"40+ for FPS. Any game 2012 or earlier is not a problem in my experience, unless it's poorly optimized. I don't play a ton of graphically intensive games though."
patientgamers,3b5o9q,Red-Blue-,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"Iirc you can build a full, top of the line computer for around 3-400 bucks, and you will have much higher quality and better graphics with less than half the load times.  And then you get access to the plethora of PC exclusives like Civ, CSGO, EU4 etc. and mods which can improve a game a lot more than you might think.  And if you shop at a site like g2a or kinguin, you can get all the games for ridiculously cheap prices (Fallout 4 pre orders are around 30 bucks for example).  The obvious disadvantage is lack of splitscreen to play whatever games you like with someone else, but that isn't really a concern to me.  If you really want Arkham Knight and Rockband 4, then I would wait until RB4 comes out and then try to buy a bundle that gives an xbox1+that and then buy arkham knight when it's cheaper.  Or try to find an arkham knight bundle or something like that if you want to play it now.  It really depends on how much you want RB4 and other console exclusives, and if you're willing to spend the time and effort to build a pc or not.  If you do, those subs above along with /r/pcmasterrace (bit of a fun/parody sub, but full of helpful pc users) can help you make your decision and help you build the pc."
patientgamers,3b5o9q,ChrisOfAllTrades,9,Fri Jun 26 08:37:53 2015 UTC,"full, top of the line computer for around 3-400 bucks   No. You will get a computer yes, certainly a decent one. See the Media Elite and Next-Gen Crusher builds from the PCMR wiki, but bear in mind you're also going to need to find an OS, keyboard, mouse, and monitor if you haven't already got them.  So a ""full machine"" for $300-400 is not happening, unless you buy used/refurbished.  And you sure as shit aren't getting ""top of the line"" - that involves individual components that cost more than the $300-400 number specified for the entire system."
patientgamers,3b5o9q,Red-Blue-,3,Fri Jun 26 13:42:25 2015 UTC,"Regarding OS, if he has a laptop with windows he already has the windows key right, so he wouldn't need to re-buy it? Also linux is free, and a great os."
patientgamers,3b5o9q,mbuff,2,Fri Jun 26 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"Nope, that key is an OEM license bound to the hardware. It stays with the laptop.  Linux is great and while there are many games that run on it, you're still way off parity with Windows. WINE can make some additional titles run but it's a bit misleading to just say ""you don't need Windows, run SteamOS."""

They'll help squeeze every drop out of your system.   That's not what you're upgrading when you upgrade your PC though. What you'd be upgrading is your GPU, CPU, RAM, etc. Upgrading RAM on a laptop is usually fairly painless. Upgrading everything else is usually next to impossible, which is why gamers should avoid laptops unless they're an absolute necessity. Even if you manage to find a compatible card they're usually significantly more expensive than their desktop counterparts and take a fairly hefty performance cut.   tl;dr it isn't worth upgrading a laptop. Just put the money toward building a new desktop instead."

patientgamers,3b5o9q,d12gu,2,Sun Jun 28 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"Best time to buy a new console is to get it when it has the titles you want as opposed to buying one in anticipation of the titles it might get. Those titles might end up getting delayed, or not living up to the hype.   So if it has the titles you want now it's a good time to pick it up. And if I had a 360 I wouldn't hesistate to get a XB1, since I'd know it would get a lot of use even if I didn't play a lot of XB1 games for it. The backwards compatibility really expanded the library potential of that system."
patientgamers,3b5o9q,d12gu,2,Fri Jun 26 05:06:04 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that. The first pre-order I placed since... I'm trying to think.. Tales of Xillia 2. I wanted a statue.   Rock Band 4. I suppose it could get delayed though. Or, it could be a horrible game. I'd be so very disappointed.   You're right though. I should wait.   I do really want to get Arkham Knight. I'll probably wait several months. It's much cheaper to buy a console than buying a desktop. I have a really nice laptop but... A desktop would be great. I do plan on getting an xBone. But I can wait until Rockband 4 reviews come out. It'll be difficult, but I think I can do that.   Good thinking /u/Discoteca"
patientgamers,3b5o9q,d12gu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yea. I think the PS4 this year is a good example of waiting, since The Order didn't live up to the high expectations and Uncharted 4 got delayed until 2016. Thankfully Bloodborne delivered to at least get the ball rolling.  When the games you want are out and at the price point you are willing to pay, there will probably be some nice bundles and discounts to take advantage of. And with broken releases seeming to become more common those who wait seem to get a better experience now.   Those who picked up a XB1 for Halo MCC were probably stunned that a first party exclusives could be released with such a low standard of quality control."
patientgamers,3b5o9q,d12gu,-1,Fri Jun 26 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"MCC didn't work out?   Huh. I thought it'd simply be Halo, Halo 2, and Halo 3 with really pretty graphics and for xBone. I'm kind of bummed out that isn't the case.   I don't care for halo too much. But... That first Halo? That wonderful wonderful Blood Gultch and other fantastic levels? How do they screw that up?   I was very excited for The Order. The setting just seemed really really cool. And hearing what I've heard has bummed me out. It isn't even the length that's the issue to me. It's the crappy gameplay, disappointing story and everything else at that price point. $60.00!? REALLY? Steam has spoiled me.   I really appreciate some very short games. I just can't imagine paying full price for it."
patientgamers,3b5o9q,d12gu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:45:47 2015 UTC,"The Halo MCC multiplayer seemed to cause a lot of problems during the first several months, but the single player campaign seemed to work fine.  It should be fixed now. It's the good and bad thing about online patches. Things may eventually be fixed, but it also increases the likelihood of a less polished release."

patientgamers,3b5o9q,Fucking_Montezuma,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:13:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, it'll get better and fixed. Just rather unfortunate for those who get the games early to play it, and have their first experience with it is buggy. And depending on how long it takes to sort out the bugs they probably could have gotten the game cheaper by the time it's in a more acceptable state.  One of the things I loved in the past about console gaming was the simplicity of just putting in a disc or cartridge and playing the game, and not having any real issues with it. Now you put in a game and got to wait for patches to download, since some of them are necessary for the game to be in an acceptable state. Sometimes the patches are ridiculously big like the 13 gig patch for Dead Rising 3.  There seems to be more of a sell now and fix later mentality. Especially with preorder incentives becoming more common to lock up early sales."

Different games appeal to me at different times. That 3rd person console port is a good lazy Sunday afternoon game laying in bed with the xbox controller. First person shooter is keyboard & mouse at my standing desk in the evening. CRPG is when I'm on my laptop away from my gaming rig. Little time and want to blow off steam, pick up a shump for 5-10min. I have about about 5 games that I cycle between concurrently. A good game makes me appreciate a great game a lot more, I'm okay with that.  [1] That being said, time is limited. I do use reviews from many sources as filters before I pick up a game and I generally know what type of game I'll enjoy, though I go out of my comfort zone on purpose sometimes.  I'm not a person who has to analyze a work thoroughly nor do I have to criticize it or tear it down. Did I enjoy it, did I have fun, was it worth my time? Good enough for now. There are works that I abandon; ""I see what this is, I appreciate it or it doesn't appeal to me, I have no desire to finish it, I'll move on.""

patientgamers,3b4w19,jmedinal,7,Fri Jun 26 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"The DLC is amazing, so you can look forward to that.  The DLC kind of has a story that goes throughout them so they're best played in order of release to get the full experience (DM --> HH --> OWB --> LR).  Honest Hearts doesn't tie into the DLC story much though so that can be played at any time really.  Lonesome Road should most definitely be played last as it references the other DLCs a lot.  They're all good, but for my money Old World Blues is the best one.  Dead Money is... different.  Some people love it, some people hate it.  I'll only say this, either take the Light Step perk or be very careful of where you're walking in DM.  The game is very story-driven so I'm assuming you like the style of stories the game tells.  With that in mind, there are a few places you should check out.  Vault 11 is a very good one, as is Vault 22.  A place few people ever check out because it's far off the beaten path is Camp Searchlight.  There's a fun bit of story there told through random scraps of paper you find.  Other than that just explore!  There's a lot of places a lot people never see just because they're so far off the the main path.  Lastly, if/when you start another playthrough and just want to go straight to New Vegas, there's a stealth boy in the Goodsprings Schoolhouse that you can use to sneak past the deathclaws around Quarry Junction.  It's possible to do it without a stealth boy if you skirt around the edge of Black Mountain, but it's easier to do with one.  Sorry for the lengthy reply.  New Vegas is my favorite game of all time."

patientgamers,3b4w19,AllNamesAreGone,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"If you have a problem with the combat and general difficulty, like I did, try out the Jsawyer mod, made by one of the game's lead developers. It's got a whole bunch of bugfixes and general improvements wrapped up in it, but the biggest changes are to game balance. Weapons do a lot more damage, and armor is less powerful, but medium and heavy armors get DR in addition to DT. You don't start with the Courier's Stash items, they're hidden in the wasteland. The level cap is lower and XP gain is slower. Most stimpaks are expired and less useful, regular stimpaks are tough to find and very valuable (Homemade stimpaks have their effectiveness somewhere in between, but give -1 Perception like Healing Powder). Carry weight has been decreased hugely, with 5 STR giving you 100 pounds, and Strong Back only providing +25. Hardcore mode is much more difficult, with H2O and Food decreasing at double the rate they do in normal gameplay, but you need to reach 400 (rather than 200) to start seeing negative effects, and soda/alcohol now restores dehydration (though less than bottled water).  I found it much more satisfying than the main game, especially with the damage changes. Gunfights are now quick, dangerous affairs, and one cock-up can very easily leave you crippled until you make it back to a doctor. VATS is actually useful, since weapons do real damage and you can conceivably kill enemies with it even at low levels. Supplies are much more scarce, and combined with the carry weight and stimpaks having weight even in non-Hardcore modes, you have to prioritize specifics rather than carrying a whole armory."
patientgamers,3b4w19,mint_sun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"+1 for JSawyer. There are a bunch of mods out there for NV but this mod pretty much leaves the vanilla game's tone alone and only enhances it imho. For best results I usually play with hardcore mode on, too, as the increased ammo weight and such make the game more entertaining, personally (it sounds tedious but really isn't too bad at all).  Which reminds me, if you happen to play hardcore mode OP, and you don't want companions to die permanently (some have a tendency to charge deathclaws), then the console command is (without quotes and brackets): setessential <base ID> 1 (or 0 to re-enable permadeath). Note that the reference ID (what you see when you click on something with the console open) and the Base ID are separate. Opening the console disables achievements (if Steam) until you quit the game and reload, however.  Lastly, if you like easter eggs or just weird things to happen then take Wild Wasteland. It doesn't impact gameplay too much (aside from a few weapons that get added) and can provide a few laughs, and actually has moments that sort of remind me of Fallout 2 random events.  Have fun!"
patientgamers,3b4w19,BabyRager,2,Mon Jun 29 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Wild Wasteland Integrated, because having to take a (potentially useful) trait slot for it is kind of lame."

I'd say if you're not having fun with 1, then skip ahead to 2 and see if you like that.

The second one is waaaaaaaaaay better but as you've been told, the formula sticks. Try alternating your walkthrough with another game.  Also, the later missions are a bit better, it's just the first ones that are kinda dull. But if you literally cannot stand it, then watch a youtube video about the story and skip to the second one."

patientgamers,3b5q4n,the_frickerman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it improves a lot, but the mechanics basically stay the same. They are a lot longer as well, so you basically feel you're commiting a genocide because on the final Levels the amount of enemies are nearly endless. I found the 3rd to be one I liked the most. Has a similar mechanic la Resident Evil 5 where you are always accompanied by someone (that can be either AI or a second Player), the Story is better but it has less and less difficult puzzles in comparison to 2."

patientgamers,3b4mzh,rempred,7,Thu Jun 25 22:51:37 2015 UTC,"All of them are good in my opinion, but these four stand out to me:  Rome 2 Total War   most complex release to date (except maybe Attila; haven't played that one) very large map, though still confined to Europe lots of factions, some of which are fairly unique melee combat a large focus relative to Empire or Napoleon, where almost all units have range was really buggy at launch but the patches have fixed it my personal favorite   Shogun 2 Total War   fairly complex mechanics relatively small map. still big enough for large campaigns, but smaller than Rome 2's grand campaign most factions play very similarly melee focused like Rome and Medieval mechanics and AI implemented well from launch   Empire Total War   fairly complex mechanics; on par with Shogun 2 very large map that stretches multiple continents lots of unique factions (European, Native Americans, etc.) different feel than Rome, Medieval, and Shogun, as most units have guns and the campaign map is unique also really buggy at launch, but again, patches have fixed it   Rome Total War   simpler mechanics than Rome 2, Shogun 2, or Empire, but still a lot of factors to manage large map. not as big as Rome 2's map, but still sizable can play as almost every faction (this does require editing some game files, but it's easy to do) melee focused AI and game mechanics are good, especially considering that this game was early in the series cheapest   This sums up the best four games and I would recommend any of them. Medieval 2 is also supposed to be a very solid entry, although I haven't played it a whole lot and thus did not include it in the list above. So I would say pick one of these based on what exactly you want.  Others may disagree with my picks, and that's fine; there's no accounting for taste. Lots of people also complain about Rome 2 and Empire, though I think this stems more from their rocky releases that the current status of the games.  TLDR:   If you want to spend very little money but still have a great game, go with Rome TW or Medieval 2 TW. If you want battles with cannons and rifles or want campaigns that take place across the Americas, Europe, and India, buy Empire TW. If you want melee-style combat and more traditional sieges, buy Rome 2 TW or Shogun 2 TW."

I didn't care for Medieval 2 at all, the mechanics are weird and poorly explained and somehow combat feels messed up compared to Rome. I really enjoyed Rome, despite its flaws and being a bit too easy - especially if playing as Romans.  My favourite TW-style game, however, is King Arthur - The Role-playing Wargame. It's sort of what i would want from a Warhammer TW game. It's Total War in a fantasy setting, with monsters and magic. It also has more interesting building and research options (there's an actual research tree for one thing). There's both story campaigns and free-for-all modes. The campaigns are actually quite decent and have a bunch of little text adventures."
patientgamers,3b4mzh,dc_da_big,2,Fri Jun 26 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"I purchased my copy of ""Total War: Shogun 2"" during sale on Steam long after last DLC for it has been released. That day I've also purchased ""Empire: Total war"" with all DLCs. Since then I've played ""Shogun 2"" for 788 hours (Steam statistics). And I still savour every moment of gameplay. The game led me to read Sun Tzu's ""The art of war"" (yes, I know he is Chinese), a lot about Japan's samurai culture, about metallurgy in Japan, etc. The game itself is fantastic. I still haven't finished main campaign about ""Sengoku Jidai""! I strongly recommend to play long campaigns.  And it is, I believe, a single game in my library, which I play without any single mod installed. It is all-around perfect. While main course of game is pretty straightforward (conquer them all) as well as strategy to do it, AI always makes incredibly stupid things which destroy your perfect plan for victory and you are forced to spend sleepless nights saving strategic situation.  I definitely strongly recommend this game.  tsdrifter wrote here ""most factions play very similarly"". ""It be true"". Except for Hattori, masters of ninjutsu. And presumably Otomo - they should get early access to firearms. Ikko Ikki is different, too. I believe them would be easy to play. Sheer numbers of their military is overwhelming."

Rome 2 was broken at launch from what i've heard, idk how it works now.    the original Rome was my favorite, but it's not on the free week i think.    Medieval 2 is kinda like Rome but with middle ages, depends on your taste.    Napoleon was lots of fun for me, my other favorite next to Rome, it plays a little different from the previous ones.    Shogun 2 if you feel like playing in feudal japan, instead of europe.    here is the the order they were released in iirc:     Shogun Medieval Rome Medieval 2 Empire Napoleon Shogun 2 Rome 2  Attila Warhammer TBA   TL;DR: play Napoleon or Shogun 2, whether you want an european or japanese setting, the latter one is newer so keep that in mind. if you want something more oldschool play Medieval 2, or just for the setting.    those are cheaper and more well established, if you feel adventurous then play Rome 2 or Attila.

PS4 is only gonna get cheaper the longer you wait, and it sounds like you have lots of games to keep you busy in the meantime. If you're not playing multiplayer stuff, it can't hurt to hold off a little longer. It's really a win-win to be patient in this case - even if you don't play them all, you can get at least some of your money's worth out of the games you already own, and you save money by waiting for likely price drops on the newer ones.  That said, don't force yourself to play the games you do have if you're just not feeling them. Then you've wasted time and money, which is way worse, imo."

I believe I picked it up when it was one sale for 99 cents and it is one of those games where there's nothing quite like it. I am not sure how much I can say about the actual gameplay without spoiling it. I will say this:  Most horror games tend to rely on jump-scares or gore, and this one as far as I've got into it has neither. It's a bizarre/creepy cartoon style with great sound to go with it. I even find the main character downright creepy. This is one of those games that you need to play with headphones on, alone in the dark to get the full effect. I got chills first time I walked into a room, the door creaked and this demented sounding voice sounded like it was coming behind me said ""I see you. Let's play!""  I think the best I can do is paste in their description of the game from their Kickstarter page:   The gaming studio received a mysterious e-mail in November 2011 challenging them to make an unconventional game. Attached to this e-mail were 19 files in an archive known as ""lestplay"". The team felt particularly challenged by this e-mail and decided to forge ahead with development."

patientgamers,3b2a4v,Rozzwellian,3,Thu Jun 25 12:04:52 2015 UTC,I often wonder if we would view Black Flag as positively as RDR and other games if it wasn't the 4th/6th game in a series and instead of a stand alone title.
patientgamers,3b2a4v,niceville,4,Thu Jun 25 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"I think if Black Flag was a person's first Assassins' game, they'd quite possibly be blown away. Being a pirate is great fun.   As an aside, I didn't enjoy the Abstergo stuff in Black Flag or Rogue. In a game that already leans heavily on collectibles etc., I found it a chore leaving the Animus. I don't know if it's the same in Unity, but for me playing in history is enough without the necessity to come back to 'the real world'. I hope that future editions don't rely on this."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,Rozzwellian,0,Thu Jun 25 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"that was a terrible crutch for the series, it was so unecessary to try and justify the rules of the game: It's a game we already know its artifice. I think they are too invested in it now unfortunately but its always the worst part of the AC experience, the Templar mythology is pretty weak too."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,K3wp,2,Fri Jun 26 14:43:14 2015 UTC,"Nice, Yeah sounds like a clear winner and I love dark westerns (True Grit, Deadwood, Unforgiven etc. ) so I think i'll opt for that."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,karma_the_llama,-2,Thu Jun 25 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"If you have a decent PC, Black Flag is an amazing experience.  Especially on a big screen."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,K3wp,8,Thu Jun 25 17:34:08 2015 UTC,I would choose RDR over Black Flag any day of the week. Black Flag was a fun game. RDR was a gaming experience.
patientgamers,3b2a4v,kmacku,8,Thu Jun 25 12:47:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Red Dead is way overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and you'll have a good time with it. I just don't think it's as good as everyone makes it out to be. Kind of like how Final Fantasy 7 is way over-hyped; another good game, but there are better in the series.  That said, I still think RDR is better than AC:BF."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,lacsativ,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:23:20 2015 UTC,"Those titles aren't even in the same Universe.  FF7 is basically a card game with cut-scenes.  As mentioned, RDR is an experience.  RDR is probably the most organic game I've ever played.  It's raining so you head to the saloon for a drink and to shoot some dice.  You end up playing cards.  Things aren't going your way so you maybe cheat a bit.  And get caught.  Guns are drawn and next thing you know you are a Wanted Man.  And the whole experience is seamless.  My only criticism about it is that I've never finished it as I don't have a console at my place (its at my parents house)."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,forkinanoutlet,4,Thu Jun 25 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"A word of caution:  RDR is not a hype game the way you see on virtually every gaming platform. As others have pointed out, one of the things that separates it is periods of lull where you get to just drink in the scenery.  (and then a cougar mauls you out of nowhere. But that's beside the point)  RDR is basically like throwing yourself into an old-timey Western. It has all of the tropes of the genre, a fun toe-dip into history, and the usual Rockstar brand of satire and puns, even if they're a little more difficult to find.  Even though it plays like Grand Theft Auto: Horse, it is enough of a different experience to warrant its own evaluation; the tone and mood of the writing are significantly different from what we're used to with the GTA series, whereas Black Flag (as has been pointed out) is Just Another AC Game, With the Ship Mechanics You Loved From 3 Stretched Out Into an Entire Game.  You'll find a lot of people on this sub who will sing its praises, but that's because of the game's ability to invoke our senses of nostalgia and wonder, not because of any kind of magical HYYYYPE that marketing companies feed to consumers these days. So my hope is that you'll get the game, enjoy the game, but not come back here in a month or two saying, ""I don't get it, guys; what's the big deal?""  ...That said, I'd still get it over Black Flag."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,zeno82,2,Thu Jun 25 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't played it it yet, but I recommend Red Dead Redemption. Black Flag is good, I really enjoyed it, but just as /u/Rozzwellian said, it's just another Assassin's Creed game."
patientgamers,3b2a4v,RisingRapture,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a reason that RDR is on the essential patient gamer's list and Black Flag isn't.  Black Flag is a good game, but it's not absolutely essential to play unless you really enjoy the AssCreed series/boat combat. It's a lot of fun, but it gets a little repetitive and the story isn't really that interesting. Comparatively, the gameplay in RDR is considerably diverse, ranging from hunting sidequests, gunfights, Mexican standoffs, horse races, gambling, fist fights, sieges, bounty hunting... and on top of that, you have one of the most involving and beloved stories in gaming history. It's not for everyone, true, but the reception for RDR was overwhelmingly positive."

patientgamers,3b3job,zeug666,3,Thu Jun 25 18:05:13 2015 UTC,for a long time now. They patched it's performance issues fairly quickly (for ubisoft).  now the story on the other hand......
patientgamers,3b3job,-ParticleMan-,0,Thu Jun 25 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"What about countless glitches? Have they also been fixed? To fix a story you need to fix franchise itself, so..."
patientgamers,3b3job,NekoiNemo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:39:44 2015 UTC,"well This is easily the worst of the franchise (while also being the best looking), so if you dont like the franchise's story, imagine how you'll feel about this one.  i dont remember how many glitches are left, it's been a while since i've played it. but from what i remember it wasnt too bad after the patches"
patientgamers,3b3job,-ParticleMan-,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:47:44 2015 UTC,"I like AC's story. Or at least liked it up to (inc.) Revelations. After that they started to hop around the ages without giving any of ancestors the time they deserve (as a result none of them feels like even remotely important after the spotlight time Ezio and Altair were given). I couldn't stomach AC3 but i've heard that they killed Desmond and next games don't have any kind of sensible modern days part of story in them.   Back in 1 through 3 all of the memory adventures had goal (even though all of this ancient gods, apple of eden and Abstergo stuff was kind of bs, it did serve its purpose by being there and giving the meaning to the journey, giving incentive to go forward) and made you be invested, go forward to find out what happens next, how it all turns out. Now it just feels like yet another small unimportant adventure after which you don't even look back, just say ""welp, that happened"" and move on.  That's what i meant by fixing the franchise. Sorry if it sounds very awkward."
patientgamers,3b3job,NekoiNemo,-2,Fri Jun 26 13:29:53 2015 UTC,"no, it makes sense, and this one is the worst. Everything you listed is made worse in the game. The main character (who isnt bad despite his story) is pointless, there is pretty much no modern story at all in it, the story is glossed over in a way that you dont give a shit about anyone in the game, pretty much nothing historical happens to the character, it's just going on around him off frame, and i could probably go on, but thats more effort than i want to put into the game.   it's worth getting eventually, but i wouldnt pay more than $10-15 for it and you could probably hold off until it's even lower"

patientgamers,3b2amd,doyouwantpancakes,4,Thu Jun 25 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"They're pretty different, actually. Ruse is more of a traditional RTS, with more clearly delineated differences between units and no detailed rules about facing and so on. The ruses themselves are also a big factor, as you'd expect; think Age of Mythology's god powers, but less devastating and used more frequently. There's even a story, with cutscenes and everything."
patientgamers,3b2di3,thehollow89,5,Thu Jun 25 12:23:46 2015 UTC,"It depends on what my feeling are after finishing the first title. Just as an example, I started playing Mass Effect 1 two years ago around this time of the year. I wasn't too impressed with the first few hours of gameplay. However, it was one of those games that grew on me, and by the time I finished it, I felt like I just had to play the next title.   So I did. And I had a blast.   Just pay attention to what you feel upon the completion of the title in the series. Are you excited about the series and the upcoming title? Then go for it! If you think that you would have a better time playing something else, then do that instead.   I remember being burnt out on the Mass Effect series as well, but thinking about it now, two years after playing them, I wouldn't mind replaying the series. That's not going to happen as I rarely replay games, but I would enjoy it if I had to."
patientgamers,3b2di3,lacsativ,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:43:19 2015 UTC,"Well said. When I finish I game, I know I'm ready for the next one if I can't get enough of the game I'm already playing. For example, I finished Mass Effect 1 for the first time about two months ago, and I was so into it that I was already thinking ahead to the next game before I finished, so I started it a month later. Now I'm almost done with ME2, and that feeling is even stronger, so I know I'll be starting ME3 right away.   On the other hand, when I force myself to jump into a sequel just because it's there, that's what causes me to burn out."

I'm still excited about the next one but I'm kinda glad that they postponed it to 2016.  I feel if you like the game, you'll come back to it, but sometimes there can be too much even of a good thing.  Assassin's Creed would be absolutely tedious to play through from the beginning. Played them all until black flag but didn't finish III and BF."
patientgamers,3b2di3,Myfeetaregreen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"For me it really depends on the series and how I play them.   Last year replayed the Mass Effect trilogy on PS3, one game right after the other. I had already done 90-100% in all of them when I last played on PC, so I decided to download a mission checklist to help me do [almost] everything the second time. It was really nice because I could enjoy the game and it didn't take too much of my time (which is something I always have in mind when replaying games).  Other series/games I usually play one game per month or semester, depending on their length. For example, I played Zelda: Link's Awakening this first semester and I aim to play A Link Between Worlds until the end of the year."

Even if the story or world is unrelated, I like to see how the game started as a concept, then where it went. What stuck, what was changed, what was good that was lost and what was included or improved. I find it really rewarding.  The problem is I'm quite strict about it, so there's a few 8bit and a millon 16 and 32bit games I need to play before I can catch up with some of the current franchise.

My one warning with Fallout 3 and Skyrim (not so much with FNV I realised) is that I've seen people complain that they can seem to start out a bit slow. But if you enjoy exploring, talking to characters to collect sidequests, heading towards that icon on your direction bar thingy to see what's there and generally just spelunking through caves, it won't seem like a slow start at all."

In my opinion New Vegas is a far better game than Skyrim, simply because its world and mechanics are deeper and far more engaging. Skyrim's story is essentially a throwaway, and it lacks a lot of the depth found in New Vegas', as well as the interesting factions systems.  However, they're both excellent games that'll scratch that itch you have for an open world RPG!"

patientgamers,3b1t5i,CireEdorelkrah,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"They run fine on console in my experience with all of them. There are bugs and glitches that can't be fixed because there's no mods, but nothing gamebreaking, and a lot of them are weeded out in the GOTY versions.  Just make 100% sure that you get the GOTY versions. I've found with FO3 and FNV that there are noticeable stability improvements with the GOTY versions, even if you're just playing the core game. Also, the GOTY versions add new perks, items, quests, etc. that add hours and hours and hours to your gaming experience. I'd say that the DLC for FO3 and FNV adds around 4-6 hours per DLC.  Can't speak for Skyrim, I'm still waiting for the GOTY to drop to $5."
patientgamers,3b1t5i,forkinanoutlet,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"I think that FNV has a much stronger narrative core and more options than Skyrim generally, as Skyrim feels sort of ... artificial after a while which can be boring (the reason being despite your behavior people don't really have a reaction to you, moral decisions don't factor into gameplay you can be evil and good and it makes no difference to your status) , the side missions in New vegas offer a lot of moral dilemma and grey area and thats brilliant, though Skyrim does have a beautiful world and atmosphere. but just off my head I would say FNV is more rewarding  edit: Skyrim is also full of endless dungeon/fetch quests, almost every story line is padded out with half of these."

patientgamers,3azc9b,Lereas,2,Wed Jun 24 23:23:41 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the game, on a case-by-case basis. I most recently went through this with Yakuza on the PS2 and Shadowrun on the Super Famicom. With Yakuza, I left off during Chapter 7, as there was an emulation glitch related to playing it on an 80GB PS3 that causes the game to always freeze right before a certain boss fight. This was back in 2010, and over the next five years I got myself a PS2 memory card adapter, and then eventually transferred my data to an actual memory card so I could finish the game on my PS2 that had been sitting in the back of a cabinet for several years. For that game, I knew I did not want to redo all of what I had done thus far, but at the same time I had forgotten so much. Fortunately, I unlocked a cutscene viewer shortly after getting past that fight, and rewatched all the previous cutscenes to brush up my memory of the story up to then. Then I looked up the controls in the manual, and just tried to learn how to play the game again via practicing as much as I could through the next story-required fights. Eventually I got back into the swing of things, and proceeded to finally beat the game, thankfully.  After that, I picked up Shadowrun again. That game on the other hand, I had left off from very early on in the game's story (I had just ), so I decided to just start over from the beginning. I proceeded to beat that as well, and had a pretty great time, which I think was to some extent aided by already knowing what to expect, based on what little I had played years back."

Hope you enjoy the series! I've only really gotten far into VII and VIII, but I hear IV is pretty awesome too. I'd recommend checking out Dragon Warrior I & II on GBC... somehow... to get a grasp on the series. I actually have a tradition, where I play it starting from December 1st each year.

It has some fun mechanics and a pretty original world. It's a more RPG-oriented PokÃ©mon-style game, where the end game largely revolves around Breeding. (In fact I'm pretty sure it was the inspiration/predecessor for the PokÃ©mon games. Even had the ""two versions with different monsters"" bit.)  The breeding is fun, but you don't get much info, so if you want to do it properly you should look up some info online. Wouldn't be the first to breed his powerful monsters into nothings."

From my experience 5 (Hand of the Heavenly Bride) (Available for the DS or emulated with a patched ROM) is the best one. 8 (Journey of the Cursed King) is also a really solid starting point. 5 and 8 are probably the best starting ones and each one is a standalone (some characters do make cameos, such as Terry being a character in DQ6, same as Milayou, and DQ6 having characters from DQ4 and 5), but nothing major. Maybe play through 6 since you've played monsters already."

It lacked the interesting story of Asylum and the polished combat mechanics of City.  Origins is a good game as a stand-alone, but a bad game in the Arkham franchise."

It was an amazing story, so no foul there. Then Origins is marketed as Bats v. Black Mask and some more obscure villains, a nice change of pace, but LOL it's Bats v. Joker again. That plus the average story was a bit much for me, plus the fact that he meets all these villains for the first time in one night, I give Origins a 7/10."

I started Arkham Knight last night on PS4 (Rocksteady-developed Batman games are my patientgamer exception) and I'm loving it. No gamebreaking issues whatsoever so far. The only issue I remember that mildly annoyed me was rescuing one hostage on the floor where it took me a minute of walking around the guy until the button prompt to rescue him showed up.  Another minor niggle I have is the gadget selection - I liked using the dpad to change gadgets quickly without pausing the game.

patientgamers,3azo7i,irritatedellipses,10,Wed Jun 24 22:34:30 2015 UTC,"South Park's humor is pretty unique, so it's hard to compare to anything to say if you'll appreciate the humor that doesn't require knowledge of the show. Toilet humor, racism, etc.  As a game, it's incredibly well-produced, and not-too-well designed. It's relatively short for that they were charging originally, and the gameplay is rather shallow compared to others in the genre, but with the price drops and sales, it is a good game, though not great; it's at least on par with the fun-factor of costume quest 1, if you know that one, though CQ1 is probably a superior game if it's possible to strip away the omg-I'm-playing-a-South-Park-Episode luster. And, of course, the humor in CQ is basically family-friendly, whereas SP:SOT shouldn't be viewed by anyone.  And on a related note, go watch South Park! Start on Season 3 or so, as the earliest seasons--though revolutionary in their offensive and ridiculous content--don't appeal the same way to a modern audience. The show changes considerably over the years. If for no other reason, watch South Park because it constantly set the bar for what's been okay to do on TV. If you like outrageous, offensive humor, and social parody/commentary, South Park is the show."

patientgamers,3azo7i,BlackadderEdmund,3,Fri Jun 26 08:10:12 2015 UTC,Got it a few months ago on g2a. Fantastic game so long as you know the series.
patientgamers,3azo7i,thomolithic,3,Wed Jun 24 20:40:10 2015 UTC,I played it and was quite surprised. I thought that it was just going to be a cheap gimmick game but they did put their work into it.
patientgamers,3azo7i,Rorplup,2,Wed Jun 24 21:43:42 2015 UTC,I beat it about a month ago and loved it. I'm a pretty big South Park fan and thought they nailed the humorist this game. It also plays well. It did drag on a bit too long towards the end but overall a great game. I played on PS3 and it did have a lot of FPS dips while traversing the town.   I'm excited to see what they will do in the next game.
patientgamers,3azo7i,CatOnAHotThinGroove,2,Wed Jun 24 22:51:08 2015 UTC,Amazing game and will have your sides busting (especially if you've seen the show). Don't expect much replayability though.  Edit: It can be played on anything as well but it is capped to 30 due to the animation limitations.

patientgamers,3azo7i,thetrooper424,2,Thu Jun 25 00:27:32 2015 UTC,I can't recall the exact achievements but it requires two playthroughs due to a fork in the road in the story. You can always keep another save from before that point as well. I went slow and my first took me 14 hours. You will need to follow a guide strictly for the weapons achievement as there are a handful only available at certain points in the game and cannot be accessed later on.

There are a ton of nods to themes and events from the show, and new ones were created as well. They also embellished upon a lot of the reoccurring plot devices in the show, for example, Mr. Slave's ass, and quite literally 'fleshed' them out more. There are so many creative and unique scenes in the game. I don't want to give too much away, but you have to maneuver the boys around two people fucking at one point and the animations and background are hilarious. I absolutely loved the game for the short duration it took me to beat it."

OH GOD JUST GO YOU MOâ NO YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIâ C'MON, JUST GO ALREADY!!!  Lots of japanese tropes too. Feels like playing an anime, with Marty Stu and everything.

Thanks a bunch.   Edit: I guess I don't really have a lot of experience with JRPGs. I've tried Final Fantasy 2 and 7 and found them both to be quite a bore, but I'd totally be willing to try another one. With this in mind, would you still recommend any of those to me?"
patientgamers,3b0ls3,triedtostayaway,2,Thu Jun 25 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"If you didn't like FF7, don't grab those."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,robot_swagger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:52:05 2015 UTC,Noted. Thanks.
patientgamers,3b0ls3,robot_swagger,2,Thu Jun 25 04:53:45 2015 UTC,"What I do not enjoy is the traditional turn based, grindy JRPG.   If you have the N3DS check out xenoblade. I personally did not go mad for it (I fucking love turn based games) but it is clearly a quality non grindy not turnbased game.  Not a long game but Attack of the Friday Monsters! was one of my favourites. Also crimson shroud. Which are both made by level 5 (who make the layton games).  MH4 is great and IMO you just have to put 30 hours in before you know if you are going to make it to 80/150/300+ hours. I hit 80 hours and killed the main monster and have stopped, but I do intend to go back and finish the other quests at some point.  The game is weirdly very gratifying. I really struggled with the nerscylla (scary poison spider) at first, it beat me twice which equates to about an hour and a half getting trashed by a big poison spider. On my 3rd attempt I kill it within 5 minutes of the mission timeout, my elation was unrivalled."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,Mic_Check_One_Two,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:53:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no N3DS.  I heard Monster Hunter is a bit, mechanically, like Dark Souls which is incidentally one of my favorite games ever. Would you say that's the case?"
patientgamers,3b0ls3,Mic_Check_One_Two,3,Thu Jun 25 15:29:18 2015 UTC,I have not played dark souls myself but I have heard that.  I have a friend that was heavily addicted to both who said they were similar. I assume from talking about it that it's hard/gratifying in a way that's very similar to MH.
patientgamers,3b0ls3,Mic_Check_One_Two,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:48:57 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks for all the help! I'll keep it all in mind.
patientgamers,3b0ls3,Mic_Check_One_Two,2,Thu Jun 25 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"They're similar, yeah. Dark Souls is more about pure skill though, while MH is more about preparation and forethought."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,a_carnivorous_ocean,2,Thu Jun 25 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"Seconding Dawn of Sorrow and TWEWY - If you like sidescrollers like Shovel Knight, you'll probably like Castlevania... Dawn of Sorrow was definitely my favorite DS Castlevania, but Portrait of Ruin and Order of Ecclesia were both good as well, in case you can't find DoS. TWEWY is a Japanese action game, and is one of my all time favorite DS games.  For the 3DS, you may want to check out Monster Hunter. 4 Ultimate is the newest one, but 3U was good as well. It takes a while to get in to, but once you dive in you'll discover an incredibly deep game. I also saw someone else mention Xenoblade, if you have a New3DS - I can't speak for the N3DS version, but I loved the original release on the Wii."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,a_carnivorous_ocean,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I don't have an N3DS.   Tons of people are gushing over Monster Hunter. It seems like a pretty safe bet.  I have played the original 3 Castlevanias (I only beat the first one), and 1 and 3 were great. I actually disliked Symphony of the Night. I am well aware it's held in high regard and that the new ones are modeled after it. If they're too much like Symphony... Not sure I could get into it."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,a_carnivorous_ocean,2,Thu Jun 25 17:57:26 2015 UTC,"If you didn't like SOTN, then DoS may not be for you since it does pull a lot of inspiration from SOTN... But just in case you're still interested:  The core mechanic behind DoS is that you have a chance to absorb monsters' abilities after killing them. Every monster has a different attack, (the typical up+attack, similar to the throwing knife/axe/cross/holy water/etc from previous games,) passive bonus, (usually a stat boost,) or activated bonus, (activated with the shoulder button, these do everything from allowing you to transform into different enemies to allowing you to glide.) It adds a ""Gotta Catch Em All"" mentality to the game, since the absorption chance is pretty low. There are definitely some monsters that are a grind to absorb, (monsters have rarity ratings, with better abilities being more rare,) but they're generally worth it and you can at least make it through the base story without grinding... And as a bonus, there is a Vampire Hunter mode after you beat the game, which allows you to play through the base game with the traditional whip+attack item combo."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,fivecentpsychiatrist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:53:33 2015 UTC,That...sounds pretty cool. Does it have kickass music? Classic Castlevania had such a good soundtrack
patientgamers,3b0ls3,Mic_Check_One_Two,2,Thu Jun 25 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the music is a combination of new tracks and rehashed classic tracks. The music is almost like a combination of classic Castlevania and Megaman X, which actually fits the setting quite well, (the game takes place in the future, after Dracula has been killed.)"
patientgamers,3b0ls3,fivecentpsychiatrist,2,Thu Jun 25 21:32:46 2015 UTC,"Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate has mysteriously stolen many hours right from under my nose.  It's not for everyone but you can seriously get lost in there.  For a more casual player, Smash Brothers has an unreal amount of play modes and things to unlock.  I really enjoyed that game."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,fivecentpsychiatrist,2,Thu Jun 25 00:43:27 2015 UTC,I forgot to mention Smash. That's fun.   MH4 huh? Is it a grindfest or primarily multiplayer?
patientgamers,3b0ls3,fivecentpsychiatrist,2,Thu Jun 25 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"MH4 can be a grindfest if you are picky about your gear.  There are tons of armor sets that you can only create by acquiring the raw material from huge boss monsters (the battles with which can last 20 minutes or more).  But for crafting potions and stuff, you can either find the materials in the field or hope that the merchant will have some for sale.  I don't like grinding too much personally, but I can say I have decent armor and a surplus of healing items, etc.  Regarding multiplayer, I've never touched it.  I've read that you can complete the game alone if you really want to, and Capcom isn't forcing us to take the game online.  You can recruit these awesome cats in the single-player mode to accompany you in the field and help you out in certain ways that are unique to each cat."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,fivecentpsychiatrist,2,Thu Jun 25 00:56:49 2015 UTC,"We seem to both dislike grinding and multiplayer, and the fact that you really enjoy the game regardless indicates I may, too.   You've piqued my interest in getting it, more than I had earlier - thanks a lot for the response!"
patientgamers,3b0ls3,timn8r,2,Thu Jun 25 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  I was a bit skeptical at first too, seeing how much there is to do in the game (and how small my attention span can be at times).  Thankfully the community for it is really strong and people have made tons of videos and whatnot to get you on a fast-track for learning how to best play with whatever starting weapon you choose.  Or set off on your own, whatever.  I'd say it's well worth the $40, but it's been out long enough I almost guarantee you can find it cheaper through ebay or amazon.  Anyway, enjoy your flight and have safe travels!"
patientgamers,3b0ls3,ChemLok,2,Thu Jun 25 01:08:32 2015 UTC,"I've really enjoyed the Rune Factory series. Basically Harvest Moon with fantasy elements tacked on. The 4th game is my favorite. You can open a shop of your own and sell extra items to the villagers. You can craft weapons in all of them, harvest crops and cook, fight monsters, fish, and even get married. In the 4th game you can choose your gender as well. I've played RF3 and RF4 and really enjoyed them but I didn't find RF2 to be as fun."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,timn8r,3,Thu Jun 25 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"Basically Harvest Moon with fantasy elements tacked on.   The series tag line is literally ""A fantasy Harvest Moon""."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,timn8r,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, that sounds like an intriguing concept. I've never played Harvest Moon. How is the combat? Is it turn based and really JRPG-y/grindy? I'm not really into that kind of thing."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,timn8r,2,Thu Jun 25 02:08:02 2015 UTC,"the combat is more action-y, a bit like a classic Zelda game. Everything happens in real time. You get like 9 weapon classes to pick from as well as shields, armor, magic spells etc. It's not super grindy unless you want a specific ingredient for crafting or cooking."

The Wikipedia page says the core of the game is inspired by ""love and marriage""... I'm not sure I can handle an anime style dating sim..."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,pakz8,2,Thu Jun 25 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"In RF 3 the dating ties into the main plot, but only a bit... it's not like a dating sim at all. (There are dates, but it's no big deal)   The thing I like most about the RF series is that you can pretty much do what you wanna do. If you wanna farm, you can farm. If you don't wanna farm, you can go fight monsters. You can fish all day. You can help people out by doing quests. You can craft, cook, explore... anything you wanna do. It's very open. If you like having a lot of options, you'll probably like it."
patientgamers,3b0ls3,Mic_Check_One_Two,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"I actually meant RF4, not 3, which is apparently the best one?"
patientgamers,3b0ls3,timn8r,2,Thu Jun 25 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's too much dating in RF 4 either but I haven't finished the whole thing. In any case it's less than 5% of my total game play, so it didn't make a big impact. RF4 has more gameplay and features than RF3 as well, so all things being equal I'd recommend RF4 over RF3."

patientgamers,3b0ls3,cakeisatruth,2,Thu Jun 25 02:06:46 2015 UTC,There's a game called Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright that gives you a mix of both series. That's a good game to try out because it gives you the gameplay of both series.

patientgamers,3axdlj,stonebone4,9,Wed Jun 24 16:42:09 2015 UTC,Not to mention the story is horrible and riddled with gaping plot holes. The voice acting is terrible and awkward because it's all French voice actors trying to phonetically speak English like Jackie chan used to do. The only one who actually spoke English was the detective. That game lowered the bar for storytelling in games.
patientgamers,3axdlj,Figgots,4,Wed Jun 24 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"I personally loved the game, but I will never defend it as being a ""good"" game. It's honestly a big guilty pleasure of mine. It's kind of like saying your favorite movie is Avatar (NOT shitty Shamalama one); you can argue the points until you're blue in the face as to why it's not a good movie, but that didn't stop millions of people for enjoying it...and there's nothing wrong with that.   I think there's a great love for it just because it paved the way for ""interactive movie"" type gaming and it just hadn't been seen before, but yeah, when you break it all down, it's just ""QTE truTV"" the game."

patientgamers,3axdlj,BlueWolves,4,Wed Jun 24 11:07:38 2015 UTC,Quick question on MGS. Did you play any other MGS before it? I played MGS about 6 months ago and while it was good the controls and camera wrecked my head. I started 2 and then just stopped at the first level because I couldn't face more of the bad camera angles. I know people say that you ahve to play them all and I'll probably get down voted for saying this but I just couldn't face 2 and 3 with those cameras. Although I have to try 3. I started MGS4 before but I stopped because I wanted to play them in order. So did you play them in order? and what would you recommend?
patientgamers,3axdlj,Sohakes,2,Thu Jun 25 05:07:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think the camera is really bad, I think it fits the game style. Maybe keep trying? It took some time until I started to enjoy the game. By the way, MGS 2 makes no sense if you didn't play the first one before, so don't do that. I think you can play the third one first if you want, anyway (that's what I did)."
patientgamers,3axdlj,BlueWolves,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:14:37 2015 UTC,I might try it again so. I liked 1 but the camera just was horrible I thought. Games age very differently. We are spoilt with camera options now.

patientgamers,3axdlj,LOfTD,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:28:35 2015 UTC,Yea but unless it's got an aftermarket hard drive it's not fully backward compatible.  That was a major decision factor for the one I bought.

patientgamers,3axdlj,burst_bagpipe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:01:04 2015 UTC,I didn't really get into the game when it first came out back when I had an xbox. I recently bought it for my PS3 and got ridiculously hooked this time around.   Unfortunately I booted it up to play last night and all of my saved games crash to the PS3's home screen upon loading...and starting a new game it crashes within 30 seconds of playing. Been googling like crazy today and can't find any answers for shit. I'm going to pick up a used copy of it from Game Stop to see if I've just got a bad disc...I really want to play this. I haven't played a game this awesome on a console in years.
patientgamers,3axdlj,Kyle_G,2,Wed Jun 24 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"I know that feel bro. I'm also a Patient and haven't anyone around when finishing great games bc everybody already has done that.  My personal reccomendation, after playing all those masterpieces, is that you should get Ni No Kuni, Fallout: New Vegas or Batman: Arkham City. They don't reach the Level you are accustomed right now but they're still pretty good.  EDIT: if you are more into sandboxes, Red Read Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 5 are musts as well, as you have been already told."
patientgamers,3axdlj,mynewaccount5,2,Wed Jun 24 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"I must say that I am amazed, as I've found MGS4 quite dull (like 2 years ago) and I thought that I played it so long after release."
patientgamers,3axdlj,Superbeastreality,2,Wed Jun 24 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm here!  I completed The Last of Us last year and Heavy Rain a few weeks ago.  Heavy Rain was such a unique and memorable experience. Someday I hope to replay the remakes on PS4.  I have been working on the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection: MGS3 is up next.    Getting a PS3 at the end of its lifecycle was a brilliant decision for its exclusives.  Journey and Shadow of the Colossus HD are some of the best games I have ever played as well.  Check those out if you haven't already."

I got the legacy collection as well and have been replaying the ones I've already beat and worked my way up to the 4th one. (the third might be the best though so ENJOY IT!)  And I'm surprised so many people dislike heavy rain, such a unique game!  Thanks for the suggestions I have not checked those out, and so I'll be doing that soon. Oh btw have you played the last of us online? One of the best online games I've ever played"
patientgamers,3axdlj,novarising,2,Wed Jun 24 21:38:50 2015 UTC,"Dude, there are thousands of amazing videogames out there. I would recommend getting Red Dead Redemption, amazing gta style game set in the wild west. Also get the metal gear collection, and play mgs 1 and 2 and 3."

patientgamers,3axdlj,OneArmSteve57,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for some new games to play I highly suggest the Uncharted Games. I adore all 3 of them(its from the same studio as the last of us). All three have amazing stories, but the first one is the weakest IMO, mainly due to not having the extra mechanics that we're added in the 2nd and 3rd, but its still amazing."

So happy you consider it as one your greatest games.  Get the Legacy collection if you can.  Full experience into this conspiracy, convoluted and epic filled universe is required.  For the other two, I was thinking The Last of Us (which I haven't played yet) and Red Dead Redemption.  Got at least two right."
patientgamers,3axdlj,Tommix11,2,Thu Jun 25 08:16:09 2015 UTC,"Got the legacy collection, can confirm it's glorious, although I prefer MG solid on ps1! Luckily I do have a ps1 and MGS"

I got PS3 couple of years ago and still have about 100 games on my to-play list, about 20 of them might be skippable, but that still leaves about 80 games. There are some really great games available for PS3. Depending on your taste, you still have lots to play."
patientgamers,3axdlj,RoyallyTenenbaumed,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:07:42 2015 UTC,I finished The Last of Us last weekend and am starting Hard Rain this Friday. TLoU is the best game I've played in over 5 years. I want more like it. Better than a lot of books I've read. I'm glad to hear Hard Rain is still considered good and wasn't just hype.
patientgamers,3axdlj,RoyallyTenenbaumed,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:20:39 2015 UTC,TLoU was such an amazing game. I picked up the remastered version for PS4 and it blew my mind. Can't wait to be able to play the Uncharted Collection for PS4 as well.

patientgamers,3azv4r,cycophuk,11,Wed Jun 24 21:51:33 2015 UTC,Check out Darksiders.  oh yeah and Rancher and Clank sounds like a fun farm simulator.....
patientgamers,3azv4r,lorddresefer,5,Wed Jun 24 21:17:59 2015 UTC,I'd recommend Jack and Rancher. Or Ty the Tasmanian Rancher. Some people like Jolly Rancher (more of a puzzle game though) but I prefer Call of Rancher to all of them.
patientgamers,3azv4r,BitWarrior,2,Wed Jun 24 23:32:11 2015 UTC,"Rancher and Clank, eh? Well, did they ever make a Farm Simulator for the PS3?"

patientgamers,3azv4r,blakeismyhomeboy,3,Wed Jun 24 23:16:24 2015 UTC,sly cooper collection is pretty good.  ...or call of duty.
patientgamers,3azv4r,DocJRoberts,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:08:29 2015 UTC,Rancher and Clank. The Harvest Moon - Ratchet and Clank mashup you never knew you needed
patientgamers,3azv4r,Germashko,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"Did you finish all of them? There's alot! But i don't know, if Jack in not similar enough and you want specificly a weapon thing - it's kinda the Ratchet trademark feature. And i don't think there is something with a similar feel.  You can try Resistance 3 - same developers. I don't know if weapons are customizable, but they all unique and interesting. You can build some fun weapons in Dead Rising series, but it's all melee."
patientgamers,3azv4r,cgbish,-1,Thu Jun 25 19:47:48 2015 UTC,Have you tried call of duty?
patientgamers,3ayf8q,BenTheWicked,17,Wed Jun 24 14:35:43 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls.  Once you get a feel for it, it's so much fun, and rewarding at that.  Once you're good at Dark Souls, you'll be that much better at pretty much every other real-time combat RPG."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,Captain_Kuhl,5,Wed Jun 24 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls has to be the best value in this list. I quickly became obsessed with it, and it takes time to get good. It's a game you can pour time into and feel rewarded, not just doing standard RPG grinding.   There's a lot happening thematically as well as mechanically, and it all rewards precision and patience. Perfect for patient gamers!"
patientgamers,3ayf8q,Mrin_Codex,3,Wed Jun 24 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"And it's got so many secrets and different play styles, there's no reason not to play through the games half a dozen times.  And that lore...hnnnngh.  They explain everything you could want to know through gameplay and items rather than cutscenes and journal entries."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,Captain_Kuhl,4,Wed Jun 24 23:10:45 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls MAY be the best game on that list, just make sure you know what you're getting yourself in for before you buy it.  That game is ridiculously hard.  I spent countless hours on it before giving up, and I feel like I got my money's worth out of the game.  But I could see someone who can't stand the difficulty getting frustrated and quitting early on.  Go watch a few youtube videos for it.  I've also heard amazing things about Valkyria Chronicles."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,Rhev,6,Wed Jun 24 21:15:48 2015 UTC,"I always upvote open-world games, so Prototype's an interesting choice, but it's nowhere near as good as Infamous. So, you should just go play Infamous!  Or Batman. Nobody doesn't like Batman."

patientgamers,3ayf8q,blakeismyhomeboy,2,Wed Jun 24 22:02:29 2015 UTC,It's because of the technical issues not the game itself
patientgamers,3ayf8q,armadillo198,0,Thu Jun 25 01:50:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely didn't like Batman. The guy handles like he's made out of lead.  I understand that it's supposed to be a mix of ""hide and watch"" and ""Jump in there with a sneaky plan and kick ass"", but it felt more like ""I am a fat tank. I am so fat that I must take some breaks in the rafters. When I catch my breath again, you guys are so gonna get it.""  Styx, a more recent game, pulls it off better. Every level, it feels like I pass through one set of obstacles, then hide in a corner looking at the next one thinking ""I'm boned. I'm gonna get slaughtered if I go in there."" I guess in Batman I felt like I was encouraged to take everyone out one by one as basically the only option, and even though it's a viable option in Styx, I feel more encouraged to sneak past, without touching anyone.  I am suddenly thinking I should check out some Spiderman games. He seems the more my style.   Completely unrelated, but I got Shadow of Mordor + DLC's for $20 recently, so I wonder if that has any sneakiness/trickery."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,itsnotmyfault,-1,Wed Jun 24 22:49:05 2015 UTC,I hope you don't mean Infamous:Second Son because imo that game was utter shit.
patientgamers,3ayf8q,idonteven93,3,Wed Jun 24 17:11:46 2015 UTC,Whyd you dislike it? It was definitely the worst of the series but I thought it was pretty good.
patientgamers,3ayf8q,wolfmankipp,3,Wed Jun 24 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"The game describes itself as open world, but if you go and explore a bit you will find mostly nothing to do. The only thing to do is do all the same repetitive missions to clear the regions from the enemy. Not that thrilling tbh.   Also, combat was always like this for me:    Jump in a fight, kill one guy A nearly invincible enemy that still does tons of damage nearly kills you with three shots Jump out and heal on a nearby roof while getting shot at Repeat    God, I so wanted to like this game, but it really sucked. I eventually gave up at about 67% and sold it."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,idonteven93,4,Wed Jun 24 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"I was one of the few people that rather liked Arkham Origins (although I see why people disliked it), and I would recommend that game to people, but not for $18. Valkyria Chronicles is actually an awesome game, but it is a heavily story-driven anime JRPG. It has similarities to Fire Emblem or XCOM in its gameplay, and because I like both those series and dont mind anime storylines, it was a hit for me. If you arent big into that kind of stuff, and prefer western action games, then I would avoid Valkyria Chronicles. The only other game I have played on that list is Dark Souls, which i would heartily recommend. It is difficult but satisfying."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,ILikeRaisinsAMA,4,Wed Jun 24 15:03:41 2015 UTC,Kingdom Hearts or lollipop chainsaw. Neither are on ps store
patientgamers,3ayf8q,nmaster12,5,Wed Jun 24 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"And here I thought that the Girl Scouts just sold cookies, and I didn't know they offered gift cards. Get Thin Mints! Way better than any of these games."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,Fuzzymuscles,3,Wed Jun 24 18:26:00 2015 UTC,If you haven't played Valkyria Chronicles I would recommend it. This is one of those games where you start to grow connected to characters. I was genuinely upset when one of my characters died due to my lack of skill. Remember GameStop gives you 7 days to return used games for a full refund so do not hold back from whichever one you want the most.
patientgamers,3ayf8q,Ratonhnhaketon,3,Wed Jun 24 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"I'd go for Kingdom Hearts. They're awesome games, especially if you've never played them."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,limination,3,Wed Jun 24 16:44:59 2015 UTC,Kingdom Hearts or Lollipop Chainsaw.
patientgamers,3ayf8q,MrFalconGarcia,3,Wed Jun 24 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"Putting 200+ hours in the game myself, I have to go with Dark Souls.  It has the tightest controls for any fighting game I've ever played, with an incredibly well designed world and memorable, challenging boss fights that are different every time.  Its frustrating at first though. You'll die a lot, but damnit it is satisfying to come back to newbie areas as a badass and ser the progress you've made."

patientgamers,3ayf8q,IZ3820,3,Wed Jun 24 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say Dark Souls and El Shaddai. The former is a great, deep RPG experience while the latter is a really trippy DMC/GoW esque action game."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,yuurei,3,Wed Jun 24 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls  Then take the other $10 and buy yourself a tub of ice cream. Go home, lock yourself away from the world, and enjoy!

patientgamers,3ayf8q,blakeismyhomeboy,4,Wed Jun 24 21:58:23 2015 UTC,I played Prototype in its day and it was a hell of fun. Go for it if you like sandboxes.
patientgamers,3ayf8q,the_frickerman,2,Wed Jun 24 14:41:54 2015 UTC,"I'd hold off on Harry Potter, all the Lego games go on sale on steam fairly frequently"
patientgamers,3ayf8q,humorouss,2,Wed Jun 24 15:16:11 2015 UTC,Prototype was recently in a sale at gamestop (4 games for $10 total) so I'd pass on that until a price drop. I'd probably go for White Knight Chronicles and either Kingdom Hearts or Dark Souls. Possibly Arkham Origins if you bring a few bucks extra.
patientgamers,3ayf8q,Bigguy338,2,Wed Jun 24 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely go for Kingdom Hearts.  Two games in one (plus a movie?), with 2.5 Remix also available if you find yourself addicted, it's a console exclusive too.

I also wouldn't go for Valkyria, because I didn't like it."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,itsnotmyfault,2,Wed Jun 24 16:13:39 2015 UTC,Prototype & Dark Souls.
patientgamers,3ayf8q,skyturnedred,2,Wed Jun 24 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Prototype is a lot of fun, but isn't super long.  Dark Souls is great if you like that sort of thing.  If you've never played Kingdom Hearts before, I highly recommend it. Will keep you entertained for many, many hours."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,ArchReaper,2,Wed Jun 24 18:17:56 2015 UTC,Spend the extra $4 and get both Prototype and 1.5.  Protoype is great but Kingdom Hearts is Kingdom Hearts.

patientgamers,3ayf8q,karma_the_llama,2,Thu Jun 25 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get Dark Souls until you find out how much you like the game, It's not for everyone. A lot of people will give it praise, because they like the mechanic's and the difficulty. But if you play games for stories, it's probably not for you.   Batman isn't as good as the other games in the series, and isn't required for your enjoyment of those two games.  Lollipop Chainsaw is short, and kinda dull. I played that whole game spamming the Y attacks because of how powerful they were. Those are the only games I've played from this list, so this is all I can give you"
patientgamers,3ayf8q,godzillamikey100,3,Thu Jun 25 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"You can get Dark Souls, Batman Arkham Origins, Prototype, Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7, Lego Batman 2, and Valkyria Chronicles on the PC for $5 each during sales, so I couldn't really recommend any of those at those prices.    You could put the $25 into a new console if you've got your eye on a new console, or a new controller if you need one of those."
patientgamers,3ayf8q,rarelypost,2,Wed Jun 24 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"Ditto. Those prices are terrible. You may be on console so are not able to take part in PC sales, but GS really are milking their prices for every penny.  Personally I don't shop at GS anymore. I have had the worst experience with multiple stores and multiple staff. If I reserve a game, when I arrive they will often say they only have ""opened copies"" which they sell at new prices and will not honor my reservation. This has happened on 3 separate occasions. Never again."

patientgamers,3ay8mq,Lecial,5,Wed Jun 24 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"I loved 13-2 and the storyline (seem to be one of the few who did). Agreed there are no linear paths. That is a major change from 13. LR pulls together everything.  I mostly tend to find people who say they hate the 13 titles, have only played 13 and not the rest of the games. How can you say you hate the games when you've only heard 1/3 of the story?"
patientgamers,3ay8mq,WhipsChainsandLollys,5,Wed Jun 24 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"Because that first 1/3 is what I spent $60 on based the hype, and what they decided to sell as a complete story, or at least complete book (vs a complete chapter in a book)."
patientgamers,3ay8mq,bitwaba,5,Wed Jun 24 19:48:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm mostly of your opinion. I'd personally recommend you to Play the second part. A few questions are answered in regards to the story. Then, the battle System remains and is even improved a bit.  Then, I felt the game Overall experience to be much better. If you've played FF7 and Chrono Trigger you will find a lot of mechanics and ""easter eggs"" from those games.  So to make a quick summary, you no longer move around the world. You move only and directly between places and time periods (one place is available to be visited at 3 different time periods, for example) and the game mechanics and Story revolve around that. Side quests are far better than the first one as well...  I still haven't played the third, but maybe one day it will be time..."
patientgamers,3ay8mq,the_frickerman,6,Wed Jun 24 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"It seems I share a different opinion to the other commenters here - I played 13 and 13-2. The battle system is indeed refreshing, and does seem to keep you on your toes, but the story is just god awful. I played 13-2 hoping that some of the plotholes of 13 would be filled, but instead it just raises more questions and answers none.  I personally thought 13-2 was worse. do NOT play for story/dialogue improvements/answers for game number 1. its just as horrendously complicated as the first one, if not more so. I like my FF games to at least have a plot I can follow, and neither game offers it. I didn't play 13-3 purely because I didn't want to be let down a third time."
patientgamers,3ay8mq,sautros,7,Wed Jun 24 16:54:14 2015 UTC,"I thought the battle system was cool, but I kept losing control of battles and couldn't figure out why really.  I am not accustomed to losing battles in FF games.  My biggest complaint was the story.  La'cie, fal'cie, cie'b'ee'gee'bie.  I spent ten minutes in the glossary trying to figure out what the fuck everyone was talking about before I realized I really, really didn't care."
patientgamers,3ay8mq,justreadthecomment,5,Wed Jun 24 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I feet the same way.  By the time you get an answer to ""what the hell is this word with an apostrophe?"" You've read 5 pages of crap you didn't really care about."
patientgamers,3ay8mq,bitwaba,2,Wed Jun 24 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"I'll go with the others here and recommend -II to you. The battle system is the same ATB system as before, sans the Eidolons. The story actually helped explain and fill in some of the gaps in my understanding of the what and why in XIII, and I actually enjoyed it. If you enjoyed XIII, you'll probably enjoy XIII-II. I enjoyed XIII-II enough that I actually tried to ""100% it"".  I wouldn't recommend LR, however. The whole system undergoes massive changes. While the battle system in LR is fun, it feels pretty pointless to me as you do not gain experience from battles (though the gil from them is some what necessary). Experience comes from quests which basically feel like you are playing a crappy MMO. The most frustrating part to me is the in game countdown clock, which works well for a zelda style game (something something majora's mask), but doesn't really work for me in this setting. And yes, you can play on easy mode and keep it virtually still until you want it to move, but I found it annoying having to continuously think about it."
patientgamers,3ay8mq,dljuly3,2,Wed Jun 24 20:58:02 2015 UTC,I liked 2 a lot better for the battle system and non-linearity (and amazing soundtrack as usual for a FF title).  I'm really looking forward to the PC release of LR as this will be my first FF title on the PC platform.
patientgamers,3ay8mq,saruin,2,Wed Jun 24 21:17:55 2015 UTC,"I'll back up what everyone else is saying: if you liked 13 (I personally loved it, I still do), you'll probably like 13-2. It improves a number of 13's features, though I don't like stories based around time travel, so I wasn't crazy about the plot. The combat is still pretty good, it's entirely non-linear, the maps are generally very open and encourage exploration. It's a solid title."
patientgamers,3b0498,peteisnewjersey,2,Wed Jun 24 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"Shadow of the Colossus is one of the best games that came out on the PS2 and one you really need to play, but play Ico first.  It comes in the HD collection with SotC and both are great games.  Just make sure you enjoy a more artistic style of gameplay, meaning little to no talking and a lot of environmental puzzles.  Dishonored is nothing like Assassin's Creed, it's more like Thief or Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  You sneak around and knock out or kill bad guys in a first person view and you have some supernatural abilities to help you.  I recommend you pick up the GOTY edition as I heard it adds a lot of extra gameplay to the base game, though I haven't gotten around to playing it myself yet."
patientgamers,3b0498,rarelypost,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:03:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback I appreciate it! Yea I really should play Shadow of the Colossus so I will get on that next. Best part about being so far behind is that everything is so cheap!!

patientgamers,3b0498,unknownone32,2,Thu Jun 25 15:03:25 2015 UTC,"Heavy Rain is amazing it's a game where the story plot isn't cut short for pretty graphics. With also about 20+ different endings there is tons of replay value as each choice isn't right or wrong. However, your decisions will come into play later into the game, I sadly had to find out the hard way my first play through.   I recommend you get Heavy Rain Director's Cut for the reason it includes the DLC BUT don't play the DLC till after you complete the game.   If you enjoy Heavy Rain when you get it I would then follow it with Beyond: Two Souls. I love games that don't take away from a great story."

I've bought used/refurb from Game$top before and none have failed on me  I'd say go for it. I never purchase extra warranties, and just go with that store's return policy."

On top of that, I only really want to play one game for now and if I want to get more I can just buy em 5 bucks a pop.  I added in the cost of a better harddrive for the future which costs as much as the 5 games I won't need. Haha. So yeah.

I can't be much help between picking from the S or E since I moved on to PC before the E came out."
patientgamers,3az168,WhyteGuy07,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"If i could make a suggestion, don't buy ODST only for the halo multiplayer disc. I love ODST's campaign, and halo 3 multiplayer is the bomb, but the population on the 360 is so low due to the popularity of the Master Chief Collection that most players who really want to play halo 3 multiplayer have an xbox one for it already. Halo 3 population rarely tops 200 these days. If you are getting a 360 for ODST ONLY, then i strongly suggest saving your money to get a xbox one / MCC bundle for $350 (ODST campaign DLC for that game is $5).   Also, there is a deal going on this week where you can get any xbox one game free when you buy the console (meaning you could get MCC and, say, GTAV for $350). thats what im doing this week. but if you dont have $350 now, the MCC bundle is likely to be around for a while."
patientgamers,3az168,WhyteGuy07,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:43:10 2015 UTC,I'm not really surprised about that. But I think that'll be enough for now to be honest. I'm definitely not going to pay $350+ for a console just for halo. I have a pc as well and both the ps4 and x1 just aren't justifiable enough for me.   I'm guessing the Reach servers are better though. I played at a friends house a few months back and it seemed like it was still bumpin. Just not that many BTB's
patientgamers,3az168,NoodleGuru,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:47:16 2015 UTC,"Reach is good for now, and i suspect it'll get better with backwards compatibility. If you are ever looking for someone to play halo 3 or ODST with, send me an invite! Gamertag is same as username."
patientgamers,3az168,NoodleGuru,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds great! I think I'll be getting Halo 3, reach, 4, and anniversary in the long run.

If that's so, does that mean I could just get 4 and buy classic maps from 1? Or are they totally separate servers from each other??"
patientgamers,3az168,_northernlights_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to play halo anniversary multiplayer, then you can get halo anniversary OR halo reach + anniversary map DLC.

patientgamers,3az1ml,pralinematchbox,8,Wed Jun 24 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say the Xbox One would probably give you more variety, and with the backwards compatibility with 360 games they announced at E3 it would be a good candidate since you don't have a 360 and you'd have a good library of games to check out (depending on how many games are actually available for backwards compatibility).  The Wii U will give you better party games and the nostalgia factor, but since you already have a Wii I'm not sure if it'd be worth it right now since the library is pretty small.  You might also look into the 3DS.  It has some of the best Nintendo exclusive games, including the Zelda N64 remakes and older games on the virtual console, and you can play DS games on it, so the library is pretty big."

Of course PC gaming is most practical but I always feel a piece of the experience is missing even when ive got my laptop displaying on my TV and myself using a wireless controller. That's why I'm shying away from PCs, I don't want the GUI from me doing work interfering with my entertainment. It's all in my mind but I just like it that way."
patientgamers,3az1ml,NekoiNemo,0,Thu Jun 25 00:49:43 2015 UTC,Well Steam has the Big Screen feature which is pretty much a console GUI. Just plug in a few 360 controllers and go at it :)

I've since put over 600 hours into a game that wasn't ever really on my radar and fell in love with the entire Elder Scrolls series because of Skyrim and ESO.  Still playing and modding the heck out of it and enjoying myself the whole time.  Can't wait for the next ESO game.  Well...I suppose I shall be patient."
patientgamers,3atzl1,Roykirk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:09:21 2015 UTC,How is eso? I've been reading about it but seems like a lot of hate.
patientgamers,3atzl1,TeamRedRocket,2,Wed Jun 24 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"It's not the same as the single-player games, so a lot of people who loved Oblivion and Skyrim were hating on it because it played like an MMO and not what they had grown to love, which is somewhat understandable, and I think that's really where most of the hate came from.  However, since I came to Skyrim after playing ESO, I didn't have that perspective.  I had experience with other MMOs mostly, like WoW, Star Trek Online, and a few others, so I was able to compare ESO to those, and it fares very well in comparison.  As an MMO, it's one of the best ones out there, I believeâI've been playing since the closed beta weekendsâand Zenimax has definitely made some serious improvements to the game and still appears to be very responsive to the community and is not sitting still.  Even their new DLC content that's appeared since the release of Tamriel Unlimited is so far all cosmetic and not in any way a Pay-to-Play scenario.  That said, if you go in expecting an experience like TES IV and V, you will be somewhat disappointed.  However, the lore is there and very strong, the NPCs are all very interesting, and the stories in the quests the kind of thing you expect from an Elder Scrolls game, so it really depends on you and the kind of games you like.  YMMV."

patientgamers,3atzl1,lostidea,3,Tue Jun 23 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"Most of the content comes from the randomization of items you get. That said, there are stations where you can trade health and mana for chances at random benefits to spice things up. Overall, the enemy variety felt good as well.  You can absolutely make up for poor RNG with FPS skills, but there comes a point where the amount of space to dodge becomes limited, so you have to clear out enemies before new spawns show up."
patientgamers,3atzl1,Ohrioh,2,Tue Jun 23 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"Like /u/lostidea mentioned, Fps skills will help a lot where rng will and does fail.

patientgamers,3atzl1,krimsonidol,9,Tue Jun 23 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"That's kinda how it goes with the older CRPGs like fallout 1/2 (or balder's gate and a slew of others). Very open ended, and can be very punishing at least at the beginning. I'd recommend trying to stick with it and enjoy how those same qualities can help you craft a story/experience in your head instead of being frustrating obstacles.  Not really the same genre, but I'll use Morrowind as an example. When I first played it (yeeeears ago), I was shocked at the size of the world and at how if I started walking down the road or poked my head into a random cave, I'd get my ass handed to me. It was brutal, but I kept at it, and it became part of my experience with the game. For a looong time I was a lowly and cautious wanderer, a weak little plebe skittering around trying to cheese enemies to death. Eventually I grew stronger, and the game got easier (or I got better, or both), and it was all the sweeter from those early struggles.  Then again, I've had a lot of trouble getting into Dark Souls, so I'm not always about the steep learning curve. But I do think the open-ended aspect is beneficial. Forget ""winning"" the game, and just ""play"" it and see what happens and what stories emerge.  Then AGAIN, some games just aren't your cup of tea, even if the whole rest of the world loves them, and there's too many great games at your fingertips to waste your time trying to force something that just ain't gonna happen. So I'd recommend sticking with Fallout for a bit, because they really are great games, but also don't punish yourself if you just can't like it.  Edit: Editing to point out that Morrowind is my absolute favorite game ever precisely because I had this intense experience with it at the beginning of feeling lost in this huge open world with no direction, and where everything kept killing me, but which eventually taught me its secrets and I got stupid powerful and was rewarded with some great storytelling both on the game's part and in my own head."

All I know about the American Civil War is that not being able to own slaves was the tipping point for a bunch of racists to turn traitor. Literally that's all I 'know'.  Personally I'd play an American Civil War game because Empire was my favourite TW, but looking through polls it was much less popular than the Roman/Medieval period games. CA seem to be sticking to swords rather than guns."
patientgamers,3atzl1,factoryofsadness,4,Wed Jun 24 00:23:10 2015 UTC,"All I know about the American Civil War is that not being able to own slaves was the tipping point for a bunch of racists to turn traitor. Literally that's all I 'know'.   You're not far off. Slavery was very important to the Southern states in the United States of America for both cultural and economic reasons. Before being elected president in 1860, Abraham Lincoln was well-known as an abolitionist who wanted to get rid of slavery. While it was true that Lincoln actually wanted to abolish slavery, he had no immediate plans to do so because he figured that he didn't have the political capital to abolish slavery without causing the Union of states to disintegrate.  It disintegrated anyway because the Southern states were paranoid that it would be a matter of time before Lincoln would make a move to abolish slavery, so they decided to secede from the Union and form the Confederate States of America (CSA for short). The United States government wouldn't just allow them to do that, so while the war started over slavery, the official casus belli for the Union government was that the war was to keep the Confederate states from leaving the Union. (This leads Confederate apologists and ignorant people of contemporary times to say that the ACW was about nothing more than ""states' rights"", and while it is true that the issue of whether the power of the United States' federal government superseded that of the individual states was decided by the war, this issue came about because some states decided they wanted to secede from the country rather than allow their slaves to be set free.)  Anyway, Empire is also my favourite TW, and I'd love to see another TW set firmly in the gunpowder age. I've thought about it, though, and I think it's more likely we'll get Empire 2 rather than a Victoria. Victoria would involve the American Civil War and the colonisation of Africa, and those are very sensitive subjects. It's too bad, because the weaponry and tactics of the era would be fun to play with. (Also, I think lots of people would like to play through Rorke's Drift.) Even if CA releases a relatively barebones game with no cutscenes, they'll draw flak from certain circles."

But 2 is brilliant. What you are basically doing is traveling East first, talk to everyone, finish all the quests in the current area and almost certainly another two or two will appear on your map. East, South, West (with some back and forth in between) is your directions. Go slow, finish the quests and enjoy the story. It's a great game but it's older so requires more investment as not everything is as in yoru face or written down.   If nothing else, get a walkthrough and check it when you need to.

The turn battle system makes encounters feel a little less repetitive, but what I loved the most about the game was ""function"" combination.  For those unfamiliar with the game, every ""weapon technique"" that you pick up produces a different effect. It starts off pretty basic, but as you progress through the game and add more to your repertoire, you can begin using their augment and passive abilities to create a ton of unique combinations.  It's kind of like... if you were able to use a sword in an RPG as an armor piece/weapon enchantment and vice versa, switching them around whenever you want to create new combos or to suit the situation at hand."

Only grabbed Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 EE, and Icewind Dale EE, and of the three, Icewind Dale EE has been the biggest surprise. I remember wanting the game as a kid but never got around to getting it, or playing it, so seized the chance during this sale. Accidentally started it up (after figuring out what I wanted to do for my party) and then spent 6 hours playing it lol. So many reviews say BG1 and 2 have a better story and are more fleshed out where IWD is more of just dungeon crawling, but going back to BG is a bit painful thanks to interface improvements, and somehow the combat is just really fun. Heck, I'm even anticipating getting into bigger battles just so I can have a fight haha. Such a fun game.   Also, if you do play, make sure to have a bard in your party. SO handy :D."

I let my excitement get the better of me.  I haven't played 7 Days to Die, it was between The Forest and 7DTD for me this sale and I went with Forest because I saw it on sale first haha.

It'll let you play Descent II at 1920x1080 with your 3D card and whatever joystick you want, and I think it'll let you do online multiplayer without using Kali (which was a packet driver that you used to have to use to proxy IPX traffic over the Internet.)

C:S is the city game I've always wanted. The last SimCity I played was 2000 (and I was still playing it), but my cities were always very rigid and all about resource maximization. C:S allows you to do this, or to make something very organic. I really like it! Some might actually find it too easy after getting past the first couple population milestones.   Besieged...I'm happy to get this on the cheap, but I certainly hope the devs continue work on it. It has potential. I feel like it's more of an 30-min amusement in its current state.

There's also a beta of a game made by the same guy called Pokemon Insurgence, pretty much a similar idea to Zeta/Omicron except all the things from the new generation, some new mega evolutions and new Delta Pokemon (older pokemon with slightly changed sprites and different typing)  You can find the wiki for Zeta/Omicron here  And the Insurgence wiki (should you wish to play the beta) here  Hope this helped."

patientgamers,3avebk,bobthedoozy,3,Wed Jun 24 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"I would recommend 5th generation, Pokemon Black and White.  When I was a kid I played through Red and Yellow and then finally Silver.  They were great games and I loved them dearly.  The sense of wonder and discovery, learning all about these new pokemon and the world they lived in.  I wasn't really into battling or trading that much, I just liked to play through the basic content of the game as a kid.  As I finished silver I got into other games and left Pokemon off to the side.  When I was in University I decided to pick up the newest generation to play with my girlfriend at the time.  I got Black and she got White.  I immediately fell in love with the game again and one thing I wasn't counting on was that Gen 5 was the first one since Gen 1 to have all new Pokemon until you beat the elite four.    You will not recognize a single one if you were a gen one player.  It was an amazing feeling seeing these creatures and you have NO idea what they do or what moves they have, I mean if they look like a snowflake then obviously.  It was like being a kid again and reading my pokemon handbook except it was on my laptop and it was Bulbapedia and Smogen.  The core game play is the same but it's become a little more complex with the addition of new moves and new types.  The main story will feel the same as the other games though.  For me the game really started after I beat the elite four.  I got into IV breeding and finishing my Pokedex as well as competitive battling.  There is a ton of ""End Game"" content in Pokemon it's amazing.  I have put close to 200 hours into Pokemon Black and maybe 60 or so into White 2.  The Pokemon community is active on Reddit with many different subreddits for different purposes such as trading, competitive battling, art and a general subreddit.  The community was great when I was first getting into EV training someone gave me a Pokemon with Pokerus, just to make it easier.  It's a virus pokemon get that helps you EV train faster, it's a little confusing and useless in the newer generations but it was a really nice gesture from a total stranger.    Then I got the 6th Generation and it didn't have the same magic because it uses quite a mix of all the generations pokemon.  I didn't get that into it and I still haven't finished any pokemon game since Black 2.    Anywho, great game.  I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't played since gen 1."
patientgamers,3avebk,epixzz,5,Wed Jun 24 12:19:45 2015 UTC,"Black and White 1 and 2 were very good compared to most Pokemon games, and X and Y were good too. Personally, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were the best in the series. If you have any questions about certain titles or certain features, feel free to ask. I haven't skipped a main-series Pokemon game since they started coming out."
patientgamers,3avebk,notarobot45,2,Tue Jun 23 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"I'll be the oddball and actually recommend the new 3DS pokemon games. X and Y are great games, and tried to change it up a little with Mega Evolutions. Basically, they added temporary evolutions that can completely change how that specific pokemon can be used in battles. Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are the newest games, and they have more polish than X and Y (from what I have seen, I don't have them yet).  This generation has also made it much, much easier to get into competitive play. Not only are pokemon easy to train(both levels and the EVs, which are a hidden boost to your pokemon's stats), but it is also extremely easy to breed pokemon with the right abilities and moves. Once I get Alpha Sapphire, I'll be preparing a competitive team for use against other players at college.    As /u/rarelypost said. Shin Megami Tensei is the more mature variation of the monster-collecting genre. Shin Megami Tensei IV is $20, and it is regarded as one of the easiest in the series for a beginner to start with, though easy is not the word to describe the game. It has brutal difficulty until you master it, but the game has an interesting story and some really awesome art."
patientgamers,3avebk,Celebrandas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:45:56 2015 UTC,The last good games are the 4th generation IMO : Diamond/Pearl/Platinum or HeartGold/SoulSilver. The newer games I played bugged me too much because of the childish story. There's always a damn NPC who come talk to you like you care! No go away! I'm not your friend! /rant  2nd gen got Metal and Dark as type and the breeding system.  3rd gen got the good EV/IV system and berries!  4th gen stop having move type determining if the move use ATK or SP. ATK for more cool Pkmn builds.
patientgamers,3avebk,SoulCorky,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:23:59 2015 UTC,Fire Red/Leaf Green was a great one for content IMO. You get the original Red/Blue and then a load of extra legendaries and content on the islands.
patientgamers,3avebk,Kootchy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:27:58 2015 UTC,"I can't believe what I am reading about x/y. I really didn't like them myself, too sanitised and the 3D was terrible. If you are going to buy a 3DS just for X/Y then I'd save some money and get a 2DS or a 2nd hand OG XL.  I personally would suggest you look at the DS (DSi/DS lite if you want the console), there are loads of Pokemon games on the DS. You can start with platinum and then black/white, B/W2 and also HeartGold/SoulSilver. 4 pokemon games FTW.  Also pokemon ranger and pokemon conquest."

I'm 21 and have been a big, big pokÃ©mon fan since I was 8, though I have to admit if you are not into competitive battling the game will fall short as being very repetitive. I did a nuzloke for X and Y and it was super fun, I think you should give a try! Works very well with older titles on emulators too. It completely changes the way you approach the games and makes battles pretty unpredictable (especially if you haven't played pokÃ©mon in a while)."

patientgamers,3avebk,najodleglejszy,0,Wed Jun 24 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"If you've played Blue and Red, you've pretty much played them all. You can't expect to deviate from the tried-and-true system of fighting, capturing and leveling system that the series has used for years.  The only version I've played and beaten was Pokemon Red. After beating it, I decided I had enough. It's not a bad game, but it just takes way too much time to level up your Pokemon and battling is both time-consuming and mindlessly simple.  There is depth in making your team surely, but then the complexity jumps tenfold. Do you want a team that's designed for your local meta? Do you want a good all-around team? Do you want to raise 3 versions of Mewtwo?  So for me, I'm done with the series and I have been after Red. As far as your decision, well again if you like the entire battle/capturing/heal at the PokeStation gameplay, you could just hop onto the latest Pokemon. They are usually on the handhelds, so you'd need a 3DS I think."

You can't expect to deviate from the tried-and-true system of fighting, capturing and leveling system that the series has used for years.   Is what I say wrong? Has Pokemon completely changed from this formula?  I'm saying if battling, capturing and evolving isn't your thing, then a new iteration of the series isn't going to make you change your mind.  The additional things they had added to the series haven't changed the core of the gameplay, but rather are minor enhancements such as berries, tag mode, and gender.  And it's not so much as I haven't played the newer games; I have. It's more that I haven't beat the series or played them for many hours."

patientgamers,3avh7z,henriquemhz,3,Wed Jun 24 00:54:04 2015 UTC,"I bought this game a while ago after hearing about how amazing it is for years. I was super excited to play it since I love games like Baldur's Gate and I heard it's a lot like that, but with possibly the greatest story and characters in video game history.    I couldn't get past the first few hours. It's extremely boring from a modern perspective. I think the people who write reviews about how it's the greatest game ever made are coming from a perspective of heavy nostalgia. Playing it for the first time in the modern age is not a great experience. At least it wasn't for me. I'm not just talking about the gameplay either. The story and characters were in no way interesting. If I had played it back when it originally came out I might have been blown away, but today it just doesn't hold up without fond feelings of nostalgia."
patientgamers,3avh7z,ballandabiscuit,2,Wed Jun 24 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's not nostalgia so much as perspective. If you've never played actual adventure games or visual novels, it seems amazing and revolutionary. If you have, it comes across as a bad attempt at cramming an adventure game into the infinity engine RPG mould for no good reason.   You can see a more recent example with Last of Us and Gone Home, which were praised as pinnacles of gaming narratives primarily by people who played 5 minutes of Myst and decided to write off the entire genre."

I consider myself very patient, and I love a challenge, but try as I have, with about 10 hours of witcher 2, I couldn't have fun in combat. I felt like I was fighting as much with the camera and combat quirkiness than my opponents. I ended up dreading missions for the wrong reasons.  I loved dark souls, ninja gaiden, and other combat-centric games, so I really appreciate a solid combat system, but I wasn't getting that."

Also I really like the weight reduction mod, otherwise crafting stuff is quite heavy. Makes a huge difference if you're a pack rat haha.   you should look at the other nexus sites too for other games you have.

patientgamers,3asdsx,Igettobeanasshole,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that.   Witcher 2s combat stopped a lot of my friends from playing it, which is too bad because it was an incredible game and story otherwise.    W3 makes accruing and using potions and oils much easier.  It also eliminates the never ending roll dodges by including parries as a default part of the game play as opposed to something you have to spec in to.  There's also a secondary dodge that's more of a sidestep, which is great for dodging unparriable attacks that don't cover a large ark.  Good for fighting men and smaller monsters.  It's really a great balance."
patientgamers,3asdsx,Cine11,6,Tue Jun 23 17:00:01 2015 UTC,What I did after getting my ass handed to me repeatedly was head into the Arena mode for a couple of hours.

patientgamers,3asdsx,freedoms_stain,3,Tue Jun 23 09:52:36 2015 UTC,Yeah dodging and parrying are more important in this game than most others
patientgamers,3asdsx,J44J,2,Tue Jun 23 11:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. A few more detailed tips: Dodge monsters, and parry humans - Humans are much more predictable because you can just watch their blade. The Quen sign is your best friend - Use it early and often. Try to keep a few bottles of alcohol in your inventory at all times - Geralt will use them when you meditate to refill your bombs and potions stock. Take full advantage of the mutagen multipliers - Notice that all your skills are separated into colors? Match the colors with your mutagens, and the effects are multiplied... You can turn a 5% boost into a 20% boost, just by rearranging your skills and grouping them by color. Read the fucking bestiary. Hunting a ghost? I hope you've read read up on them, to know that they're weak to Yrden traps... Keep multiple saves - Not for save scumming, (going back to a previous save because you want to change a choice you made,) but because it's easy to accidentally save right before an unwinable fight... There are a few random enemies and bosses that will instantly 1-hit you if you aren't a high enough level. If you haven't been keeping multiple saves, your only recourse is to completely restart the game."

Many people make the mistake of forgetting about them. A little preparation can make or break a fight. Especially on the harder difficulties. Fucking learn to parry. Many enemies can be killed (or nearly killed) with a single parry. Quen is still a witcher's best friend. Craft, instead of buying. Things are fucking expensive...

The fights in the prologue are tougher than the fights in act 1...  it's a horrible introduction to a game really.

Luckily in Witcher 3 you can drink potions during combat (yay!). On normal and easy meditating heals, but not on harder modes. It passes time, but also restocks potions (once you create a potion for the first time you don't have to craft them again, meditating restocks all of them by using hard alcohol - which is found all over the place)."

Alpha Protocol is loaded with glitches and has broken KB&M controls, but turns out to be a highly underrated RPG where it feels like your choices matter.   I understand that with the big AAA releases these days, the big issues will be patched within a few months.  I wouldn't buy any AAA game on launch unless you absolutely trust the company doing the PC port (which isn't always the primary developer).

patientgamers,3avmpc,fvig2001,3,Wed Jun 24 05:35:49 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls was a pretty lousy port. It had all of the same issues which the console releases had and its own slew of issues, the biggest of which was 1) not locking the mouse cursor to the window so multi-monitor users would end up clicking out of the window, causing it to lose focus, and 2) they didn't hide the mouse cursor. Couple these two issues with the fact that it mapped very poorly to a keyboard and you were pretty much forced to use a controller. The game's resolution also capped out at 720p 30FPS and the game required Games for Windows Live, which is an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies. A modder managed to create a fix for the first 4 issues I mentioned as well as some multiplayer fixes within the first few weeks, but such things shouldn't be left to modders and the fact that a single person could patch the game up in such a short time really speaks to 1) the lack of quality assurance at FromSoftware and 2) their incompetence.    To really rub salt on the wounds they marketed it as a new upgraded version of Dark Souls with content which the consoles didn't have, (timed exclusive dlc,) etc. So it led one to assume that problems which the console release had, like horrible framerates in Blighttown would be fixed, but that wasn't the case. Luckily, I had a wired 360 controller on hand, otherwise I would've given up on it before reaching the drake within the first hour or two of the game. It was a really horrendous port and I felt like I had been duped.   Grand Theft Auto 4's port was pretty bad. It just ran really poorly, so only people with high end PCs were able to play it at release. Even today with a mid-range pc you're going to have a hard time getting table 60 fps at max settings. It was very poorly optimized Assassin's Creed Unity is just a given. Any game that requires me to use WASD or arrow keys to navigate menus: Resident Evil 4, Borderlands 1, Skyrim, etc."

I tried to follow the main quest for a bit, but I just got rekt after entering the first Oblivion gate. I felt a bit frustrated and I didn't know what to do. I really wanted to get into it, to get immersed in it, but I had no idea how.   I looked for some advice online, and found a good place to get some starting equipment, after which I decided to help a bunch of farmers that have been turned invisible by a wizard (which turned out to be a pretty cool guy), got myself a room there, and then I get visited by a guy coming out of nowhere, telling me that I should join the Dark Brotherhood because earlier in the game I killed a civilian. My mission is to kill some guy with a special dagger in order to join the guild. On the way there I get distracted by some dudes asking for my help as one of their neighbours got lost in cave nearby, and before you know it, I've already spent 4 hours into the game and I'm just getting started.   I haven't played Skyrim yet, but if it's any similar to Oblivion, just create a small plan to begin with (getting some armos, a place to stay, etc) and the rest will soon follow.

Maybe the world was a little to empty, even with the encounter mod.  The time modding in skyrim is so high, because you need to optimize, analyse the load order, clean the mods, etc. It's pretty time consuming if you never used boss and tesedit."

patientgamers,3atcnc,pneuma8828,3,Tue Jun 23 10:44:33 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you mod it if you are intending to play it for a while. Modding isn't just about changing the dragons into Thomas the Tank Engine and completely overhauling the graphics. There are lots of mods that are basically vital, like SkyUI and others that aren't vital but have a huge effect on the quality of the game without really changing it, like static mesh improvement and ELFX. If you got to /r/skyrimmods you'll find a few beginners guides to modding."
patientgamers,3atcnc,LazyGit,3,Tue Jun 23 13:46:32 2015 UTC,I second SkyUI. It makes inventory management so much easier. Also for a little more immersion I would suggest Realistic Needs & Disease's. All that fruit and veg which you find everywhere suddenly has a proper use ...
patientgamers,3atcnc,snarpy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:18:38 2015 UTC,That's a good plan. I played about 50 hours before touching the mods (hadn't got into that sort of thing before). Playing the game for a while gave me much more of an idea what I wanted to get mods for.
patientgamers,3atcnc,LazyGit,3,Tue Jun 23 12:49:15 2015 UTC,"Man, going through the same thing. I feel this need to finish skyrim and do all the DLC. Same with fallout 3. But, I just CANNOT make myself do it.   I tried roleplaying harder. Example: a ""paladin"" character who doesn't pick locks, doesn't steal or kill innocent. He fought the daedra, wore heavy armor, and healed.    I rolled a rogue/assassin that was opposite.  Idk. Just some ideas I tried. But I feel ya.   Also. Try smoking more pot. I beat some terrible games stoned"
patientgamers,3atcnc,FishWash,4,Wed Jun 24 03:10:48 2015 UTC,"Skyrim is the best role playing sandbox I've ever played. I found that it works best when you do some role playing. For example, I played a mage once, but did not allow myself to use the destruction school. That character was a self-hating Altmer.  If you add some role playing in, the world starts to come alive. Would your character take an assassination contract? Hell no! Would he help that farmer, even though the reward is a couple of fish? Yep. The game is what you make it."
patientgamers,3atcnc,indeepth0ught,3,Tue Jun 23 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not really role-playing but I'm still following that sort of plan. I started as an Imperial without knowing anything about the main story. I figure I'm sympathetic to the Nords but not the Stormcloaks and that I'm too fancy for smithing and too normal for enchantments and alchemy and magic. I'll save that sort of stuff for when I'm playing it through again as a true nord or an elf mage."
patientgamers,3atcnc,Lecial,2,Tue Jun 23 13:54:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the best way to really get into a roleplay would be to roleplay someone who knows absolutely nothing about the area.  That way you can justify wandering, asking questions, occasionally doing the wrong thing, etc.  A runaway, an orphan, a rogue solider, an escaped slave, that kind of thing."

patientgamers,3atcnc,DigitoCrepitus,2,Tue Jun 23 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think roleplaying is a big part about making the game fun. I liked wearing thief armor and leveling up my sneaking while doing thieves guild quest, and dressing up as a mage and using magic when doing those quests. It felt more like I was playing different parts of the game instead of playing the same game in different places."
patientgamers,3atcnc,flyin-penguin19,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's a really bad game. I loved Morrowind, in fact it's in my top 5 games I've ever played in my entire life. Can't get into Skyrim at all, it's oversimplifed and boring for me."
patientgamers,3atcnc,Relenq,2,Tue Jun 23 19:58:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Skyrim in a long time.  I remember starting playing it a lot on my 360 over my PC because my girlfriend at the time would like to bring her 360 over and vice versa.   Anyways,   the way I got into Skyrim the easiest was by doing the main quest line until it brought me to a town then doing most/all quests/things I could do in said town until it took me to another one, I completed the main story last and it took me a long time after I got lost in the world.  Morrowind is still better though :p  As others mentioned if you can't get into it don't force yourself, pick up another game and you may find yourself wanting to dive back into Skyrim eventually; it won't be going anywhere."
patientgamers,3atcnc,Tuberomix,3,Wed Jun 24 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"Well Skyrim is extremely boring game if you play games for their interesting quests, characters, stories or things like that. Even tho Skyrim is supposed to be an RPG game and RPG games are known for their stories and lore, Skyrim didnt do that well. Skyrim is about running from point A to point B, kill guy X, receive item Y, bring that item to character Z.  Some people enjoy that because they get to explore the world which I cant understand in this case since Skyrim is actually VERY boring place. Some people also enjoy spending skill points and looking for new gear or crafting gear and Skyrim is great for that.  I have played TONS and TONS of RPG games including Oblivion and Morrowind and I have to say that Skyrim is one of the most boring games I have ever played, story, character and quest wise that is.  But if you are going to keep playing that game then mod it. Its absolutely horrible game without mods but with mods its decent, even for me. Just download some graphic mods like 2K textures and some lighting mods.  Oh yeah and remember that you have the option to adjust your fov. fov_90 to your console and you will actually see the world you are exploring"

patientgamers,3atcnc,zypsilon,2,Tue Jun 23 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"Live Another Life on the workshop; a similar mod is Skyrim Unbound.  The main difference is that with Unbound you can switch off dragons, shouts, and word walls (or any combination, to avoid becoming the Dragonborn if you so wish), while Live Another Life integrates you into the world a bit more and has more defined starts (though still has you as the Dragonborn).  (Personally I like the option on Skyrim Unbound to make me a random person -- I've been an Imperial Soldier, a Khajit starting off in jail, and found in amongst a bunch of dead bandits.)"

patientgamers,3atcnc,flyin-penguin19,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:03:35 2015 UTC,"The problem with Skyrim, particularly vanilla Skyrim, is that since it came out wayyyy back in 2011, tons of other games have copied its gameplay formula with better graphics, more interesting story, etc. Case in point, Witcher 3.  That said, I recommend just starting up Skyrim (or any of the other singleplayer TES games of the last decade) and just playing ""find the black dot."" Instead of trying to do the laborious quests which often mete out boring fetch tasks and the like for you to complete, just look at your compass along the top of the screen and endlessly seek out undiscovered locations. Doing this is what really made me fall in love with the game."

patientgamers,3atcnc,IronGun007,0,Tue Jun 23 11:38:14 2015 UTC,"I struggle with Skyrim, I think it's a game you have to just chip away at; play some more of the main story because from your comments you really are at the tip of the iceberg. If you still can't get into it, you may just, unfortunately, not enjoy the game."
patientgamers,3atcnc,SilverFirePrime,0,Tue Jun 23 12:22:20 2015 UTC,"There's a bit of something for everyone in Skyrim. If you like crafting, there's alchemy and blacksmithing. If you like magic, you can successfully play the game as a full mage character (something you couldn't really do in the previous games). If you want to be a brute in full armor swinging a hammer around and smashing your foes into pieces, no problem. What about being a sneaky thief who comes out of the shadows to stab your enemies in the neck, then disappear? You can do that too. If you like exploring, you will always find something interesting by just going off into the woods. If you're not really sure how to make use of a certain aspect of the game, come over to r/Skyrim and we will explain it to you. Also, the game is incredibly immersive. If you read the in-game books, you can learn a lot about the history of Tamriel. There's even a subreddit, r/teslore, dedicated to the history of the game universe.   I think you have to give the game at least 10-20 hours of playing and if you really can't stand it after that, then maybe the game isn't for you. I've played through the game about 6 or 7 times myself, and I love playing it as a different character every time. I find that creating my own weapons/armor helped me get attached to my character as well (that is, until I got really nice loot).  Anyways, the game is fun as hell so give it the old college try and I bet you'll like it."

You can be whatever you want to be in the game. You don't have to play the main quest if you don't want to, and it's easier to avoid with PC mod's like Alternate Start if you find the opening forcing you into the typical ""Nord/Barbarian Dragonborn"" role. I'm currently playing as a Vampire that works for the Dawnguard, in the DLC... Put with Better Vampires with random hunting troops, and well, things get interesting cause you have to choose Self Defence or Friendship...

patientgamers,3auhpy,diyod,2,Tue Jun 23 16:47:53 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to whether you NEED to play it for Witcher 2 because I haven't played that yet. Need to upgrade my PC and get the full experience because the first one has made it clear this will be one of my favorite stories. I will however, recommend the first game on it's own accord. It's a fantastic game. Copy pasta of a review I wrote at GOG:  The Witcher has one of the greatest story I have ever played in a game. The game doesn't get the attention it deserves because the combat simply suck and makes doing many of the missions a chore.  The story is fantastic. You are not the savior of the kingdom, just a man with some special abilities trying to do what he can to make things better.  The dialogues and NPC interactions are well done and the game gives you extremely relevant choices that shape how the events in the game turn out.  The graphics are a bit dated at this point but the game world is lovingly made and it shows. Witcher is oozing with character and life. The outskirts feel like a community of poor folk trying to survive rather than a bunch of isolated huts. Temple quarters is a vibrant town with all sorts of people who all feel real. Walking in town during night and day feel totally different.  The leveling system is interesting, but it's nothing impressive. Alchemy is very well done though. It's extremely deep and very relevant to fighting. There are so many different potions, oils and bombs.  If you're a fan of gear, you might be disappointed in The Witcher. The upgrade options are pretty scarce. That's not too big of a deal though because you won't have any shortage of stuff to spend money on.  The biggest reason this game gets an 8 and not 9.5 from me is the combat. It's a chore pure and simple, which sucks because alchemy is so intriguing and you can't take advantage of it without combat. I actually avoided side missions in the later chapters because I didn't want to fight any more than I had to. I plan to replay the game from chapter 3 onwards to play it more thoroughly and this time I'm going to try the full combat rebalance mod, which completely overhauls combat. It's supposed to be much better. If you haven't played the game yet, definitely try it. It can't be worse than the default option.  Depending on how good the FCB mod is, the game can be one of the best of this generation. Without it, it's an all time story with real choices, beautiful settings with life, tragedy, heart and characters that you'll remember long after you finish the game."

patientgamers,3auhpy,Avatar_Of_Brodin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:35:06 2015 UTC,I will definitely try the FCB mod. Combat was one of my gripes with the first game. Thanks for the info.

patientgamers,3auhpy,Avatar_Of_Brodin,6,Tue Jun 23 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, the game events take place many years after the last book and are not covered in the books.   Secondly, the second game is a direct sequel to the first one, the whole ""assassins of kings"" business starts in the first part, so playing the first one contributes a great deal towards figuring out what the hell is going on.   Thirdly, the first part is a great game on its own, totally worth playing.   And lastly, the books are great too. Most major characters in the games are also major characters in the books, so it is sure nice to know everyone's backstory. I would recomend reading the Witcher books even if you were not going to play the games. And I think they are must-read before starting the third game. Too many references."
patientgamers,3auhpy,askinnydude,3,Tue Jun 23 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"Very well. Please accept this upvote.  The books are definitely worth reading, I've gone through a few, but I still believe you can figure out a substantial portion of the backstory simply by reading all the character info as it comes up in-game.  Certainly enough to have a good time anyway."

The story goes that after making the first one, a company bought the rights, preventing his 1991 sequel from being released.  So he made Chuck's Challenge instead, which in comparison is smaller, easier, and less frustrating what with the ability to turn back time and all.  20+ years later, Chip's Challenge 2 was finally released (last year I think).  Barring the fact that you are forced to deal with 90s sensibilities like the inability to map controls and the smaller resolution, Chip's Challenge is far superior to Chuck's.  The environs are bigger, the puzzles are more complicated, and the deaths unforgiving.  Anyways for plot-driven stuff, try the Metro 2033 and its sequel Metro: Last Light.  Both games are very atmospheric and immersive, set in a post-apocalyptic Russia where the people have resolved to live underground to escape the radiation.  The first game is more spiritual in tone while the sequel ramps up on the politics.  Both games now have Redux versions I believe, which polish the graphics and add new stuff to it.  There's also Singularity, which is Metro's lesser-known little brother.  It has almost the same premise but the plot moves in another direction and has a more sci-fi element to it.  If you wanna try something a little more avant-garde in terms of plot-driven stuff, Gone Home is an interactive exercise in narrative gaming; you are plopped in a fully-explorable house and it is up to you to unfold the story by reading and understanding things.  For best effect, do not read anything on the net about it save for the basic premise."

Lockpick is essential, always the first skill I get to 100.

Use normal ammo against living targets and electric/pulse ammo against robots and power suit wearing targets. Do sidequests and sell loot of high value to bring in caps. Rads aren't that bad unless you go past 200, then it becomes problematic. Drinking Nuka-Cola not only gives you an HP boost, but gives you a cap at the price of a small rad increase. There are ways to negate the effect of rads through chems, but certain chems can cause addiction which can be fixed by a doctor for a price, or just wait it out. Build up your level before going too far into the Wastes, especially the Mall. You will be humbled by how powerful the enemies are there. When using stealth tactics, turn your light off on your Pipboy if you don't want to alert the enemy. Invest in lockpicking and choose the perk that increases your weight carried when the time comes. You'll need it. Use a pen and paper when cracking a terminal and use logic to figure out the password. Find patterns in the words. If there are numerous words having a common string, like ""-ing"", chances are the password is one of those. If the first try has no matching characters, exit and try again. Once you get a few matching characters, look for another word similar to what you selected, and deduce the password from that. Remember, you only get four chances per try, but you can exit and try again, although the words will be different."

There's a whole lot of running back and forth with nothing interesting in between. There's no way around it, the game is straight-up boring at times. If you're pressed for time I'd look around to see if there's a fast-travel mod or something.  Now all that said, even though I'm still running around a lot and gathering ten of this or five of that for a bunch of weirdos (you want five zombie tongues?

patientgamers,3aluqf,flyin-penguin19,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:41:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say so, many of the side quests are about killing a certain number of some monster (and providing monster parts as proof). Most of these you'll complete by default on your way to and fro through the environment as you try to complete main quests. If you like MMOs then you'll probably have no trouble with the side quests.

Biggest thing I'm worried about with The Witcher is having the game lose my attention and then not touching it for months.   Exactly what happened to me, I tried it about a year ago and quit.

patientgamers,3aluqf,askinnydude,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:02:00 2015 UTC,Good call. I found oblivion GOTY for $10 today so I went for it.
patientgamers,3aluqf,AgustB,2,Sun Jun 21 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"The order doesn't matter much i think. I played Morrowind last (well, properly).  Morrowind actually looks pretty decent with Morrowind Overhaul. Overall the game holds up very well. You just have to get used to the dice-based combat - you might ""see"" a hit but technically you ""missed"". Once you level a weapon skill to 30-40 it gets a lot less frustrating. It also really helps if you use a summoned weapon - these add substantially to the skill. Also, use the console to improve your walking speed. And get a mod that reduces the number of Cliff Racers.  Oblivion looks even better with mods like Qarl's Texture Pack. You'll also want unofficial patches, Darnified UI, etc. There are two mods that are absolutely required; First is Francesco's Leveled Creatures and Items Mod, which fixes enemies. Without it, enemies will have the best equipment too early on and level up with you which sucks (you can become arena champion or even finish the game at level 2). The most important mod is Realistic Leveling, which pretty much makes levelling work like in Skyrim and is highly customisable. Without it, you have to jump through hoops to ""properly"" level your character.  Both are still awesome games. Morrowind has a very distinct atmosphere and architecture, it really feels like an alien land. Oblivion has great side quests and the Shivering Isles are an amazing setting.   PS: If you play Oblivion, i would recommend that you forget about the main quest as soon as you leave the sewers. It's awful and if you bring the amulet to Jauffre the map will be littered with godawful portals that lead to terrible, generic dimensions (only ~3 variations) and spawn the same handful of immersion-ruining enemies."

If you're going to only be playing on a console, I'd say just get Skyrim and enjoy yourself.  Just make sure you enjoy exploration, fantasy elements, and first person combat.  If you've never played Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas, I would recommend those over Skyrim personally, just make sure you get the GOTY editions of those."
patientgamers,3aluqf,rarelypost,2,Sun Jun 21 23:42:29 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm going to be looking out for Fallout 3 used somewhere.
patientgamers,3aluqf,AgustB,2,Sun Jun 21 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Make sure you get the GOTY edition of that one, or else completing the main quest will end the whole game.  The Broken Steel DLC will allow you to keep exploring after you've done the main quest, and the other DLC is great as well.  The DLC is on a second disc and can be installed multiple times, so you don't have to worry about buying it used (unless you don't get the second disc of course)."

patientgamers,3alj8p,DotRoamer,6,Sun Jun 21 12:52:01 2015 UTC,"Ever since i first got a 360 controller a decade a go, literally any other controller feels like a tiny plastic toy.  I was terrified throughout the whole of DS2 on the ps3, that I'd snap the controller in half cause they're almost 1/3rd mass compared to the 360.  To be honest I never really liked the ps3 controller design. It might change with the ps4, but holy smokes are they just the tiniest!"
patientgamers,3alj8p,MrProfPatrickPhD,10,Sun Jun 21 13:55:50 2015 UTC,The DS4 has quickly become my favorite PC gaming controller because it actually is a very good controller even if it doesn't feel quite as sturdy as xbox and it has the touch pad in the center that can be used as a trackpad.

patientgamers,3alj8p,MrProfPatrickPhD,3,Sun Jun 21 14:37:48 2015 UTC,"It does connect very easily with Bluetooth so couch gaming is no problem. I have used it in Far Cry 4, Dying Light and a couple other games that allow you to switch between gamepad and M/KB to line up long sniper shots and pick locks because the mouse controls for those are far more accurate and the integration worked seamlessly and accurately.  That being said, I do not have experience using it with a game like Civ where the trackpad would be the main input. With the right sensitivity settings, I'm sure that it would work fine.  With this driver you can set the touchpad to work as your mouse and change its sensitivity and click options. You can also configure every part of the controller and including swipe controls and even the gyroscope directions."

The discounted game plus the controller should be close to the price of a full game, with the benefit of having the controller for many other games and enjoying one of the most fun, challenging and frustrating games in recent history.

patientgamers,3alj8p,Limond,6,Sun Jun 21 22:02:07 2015 UTC,I think a controller for use on your PC is definitely worth it. As for enjoying Dark Souls you can probably find it pretty cheap so it isn't a huge loss if you don't like it. I personally didn't get to far into it before going back to a genre that I enjoyed more.
patientgamers,3alj8p,the_omega99,6,Sun Jun 21 12:04:42 2015 UTC,It's noteworthy that a PC controller can be used for more than just Dark Souls. I've used my controller mostly for emulators.

It's not fancy, it's wired, it has no rumble, but the only real complaint that I ever had with it was that the triggers were a bit stiff. It's a solid controller and, as a plus, it has a switch on the bottom to select either DInput or XInput mode. As far as the game, I enjoyed it, but I got frustrated around blighttown, and haven't had the time to pick it back up since."
patientgamers,3alj8p,Natemiester,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:57:27 2015 UTC,Doesn't work well out of the box. It reversed all the face buttons until I just used an emulator.

If your PC is your primary gaming platform, having a good, compatible controller is a must, and the X1 controller is the best controller on the market, with the DS4 being a close runner up.   I have both. I prefer the DS4 from a hand/gaming perspective, but the software you need to run it can be a headache sometimes, and the battery life leaves a lot to be desired."
patientgamers,3alj8p,emblemparade,2,Sun Jun 21 15:55:06 2015 UTC,"In my opinion if you have planned some other usage for your pad after Dark Souls I'd say the extra 15â¬ is definitely worth it, but if you are only getting adapter for 360 pad to play Dark Souls then it might not be worth it."

I had many controllers from other companies but the 360's is just universally applicable. the main advantage as oppose to third party (non-ps or xb) is that you always get the right button prompts (3rd party prompts are mostly ""Button 0"" for button 1 on the controller) also you wont have to set up the right layout. the only flaw is the d-pad. you wouldn't want to play a game with only the pad but for weapon switching etc. it's fine."
patientgamers,3alj8p,tambogaming,2,Sun Jun 21 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"I recommend the game, but it really doesn't have the same affect on everyone.  You definitely want a controller of some kind to play it on PC though, so make sure that whatever you go with works.  I heard that the 360 controller is a little awkward with DS because to hold a shield up defaults to a shoulder bumper rather than the lower trigger, but I've always used PS3 controllers, myself.  I'm not sure if it allows for remapping in it's current version, but I'd check for mods for the game.  The Souls community did quite a bit of work on it to help with the original, not-so-great port."

I got mine a few years ago, and I still use it nearly every day. 360 controllers are especially nice because many games have native support for them - They're a Microsoft product, so you can plug it into any Windows computer and it'll automatically set itself up. In today's cross-platform industry, many games were already made with controllers in mind, and will automatically detect when you have one plugged in: It acts exactly like you're playing on a console. And for the games that don't autodetect, you can usually just go into the control settings and remap it to your controller.  That being said, I would suggest getting Dark Souls, but only if you're a masochist. There is a huge learning/skill curve, so the first play through will be grueling... It's a game that makes you want to throw that shiny new wired controller at your screen... But any subsequent playthroughs will be much smoother. I'd compare it to a roguelike - Risk of Rain, Rogue Legacy, FTL, etc...

patientgamers,3alj8p,pabloe168,2,Sun Jun 21 18:31:28 2015 UTC,Just buy an adapter. Seriously. 360 controllers work perfectly. I bought a XBox One controller and after a month and a few days the left stick broke. Never happened with 360s.  http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=wireless+xbox+360+controller+receiver&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Awireless+xbox+360+controller+receiver

patientgamers,3alj8p,DoctorSugarbear,3,Tue Jun 23 12:44:16 2015 UTC,"If you know or think you are really gonna like the game itself then yeah, buy the controller or the adapter.  And the thing about the difficulty absolutely isnt true if you ask me. I bought the game and X360 controller and I didnt ANY real difficulties in the game. I had NEVER used X360 controller before and I never play 3rd person action games and I still didnt have any problem. Sure you have to try boss fights 2-3 times before you can beat it but thats it. Only hard things in the game is the bosses and only some of them. The difficulty thing is one of the biggest circlejerks in the history of video games."

patientgamers,3alj8p,TheWinslow,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:57:43 2015 UTC,Just make sure your system is powerful enough. Aside from just lowering the resolution there is no way to scale the texture quality meaning that even though you could technically run it on medium the game will make it very very hard to near impossible to do so in a sensible way. Even with the fix
patientgamers,3alj8p,mushpuppy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"I love the game. The difficulty is not as bad as people make it out to be. you have to look up DS_Fix to get 60fps.

patientgamers,3amdar,titchard,4,Mon Jun 22 13:06:10 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I couldn't get into NV. I hated the way weapon effectiveness worked. Enemies with even minimal armor types not only got a damage reduction bonus but could render certain ammo types and weapons completely useless. I loved the versatility of being able to damage enemies in FO3 with anything I had on me. It was a realism vs. Fun thing for me. That and the Mojave wasteland was nowhere near as interesting as the capital wasteland, even without DLC. Sure some of the factions are a little more fleshed out and the strip is fun, but it wasn't worth the slog through the rest. I also detested the perk every other level idea. You can mod some of that out, but I feel like it really artificially increased the difficulty while sucking away fun. Some people loved the changes because it made the game much more survival-esque, but I felt gimped compared to how it felt playing FO3. The only good change in my view was the expanded weapon creation and customization system."
patientgamers,3amdar,Raelsmar,6,Mon Jun 22 13:13:58 2015 UTC,"I couldn't get into NV too, mainly because of the setting. FO3 was more immediate into putting you in action than NV, so it couldn't get a grip on me. However, I'll probably play NV in the future because I know how Obsidian games work: the start is pretty boring, but it usually grips you around the 2-3rd hour of gameplay."
patientgamers,3amdar,nopaint,2,Mon Jun 22 13:24:25 2015 UTC,If you really want to get into the action just hop on down to quarry junction
patientgamers,3amdar,AutomaticNarwhal,3,Mon Jun 22 13:27:58 2015 UTC,I had about 12-14 logged into NV. It gripped slightly about halfway and then fell apart for me. It just wasn't that great.
patientgamers,3amdar,Raelsmar,2,Sun Jun 21 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"FO3 was a very linear open world game while FNV is a much more choice driven one. That being said, if you liked fallout 3, you'll like fallout NV."
patientgamers,3amdar,AutomaticNarwhal,2,Sun Jun 21 19:25:25 2015 UTC,You're joking right? You have 150 hours in the game and you're wondering if the critically acclaimed sequel is worth it?

I played maybe 80 hours and then I put it down (I hadn't ascended yet so these were console versions).

patientgamers,3amdar,RafeVL,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:20:28 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on New Vegas, something like 20 hours in (I had similar playtime as you on 3)... maybe it helps that I'm in the same boat?   There is clearly more breadth of choice in NV in how quests turn out, and how the game develops. The upside is that choices seem to have genuine consequence - the downside is that the game feels a lot like its set up for replayability rather than fulfillment on one playthrough (either a positive or a negative based on your pov). From what I've seen so far, I feel that NV really skews towards taking a dark or amoral (or chaotic) approach. So many of the factions have obvious dark sides, and so many of the options that you can choose seem to skew towards 'evil', that my tendency to play a pragmatically good character seem to be limited at every turn. It takes a lot of effort not to antagonise almost every faction I come into contact with - it's a case of picking the option that tiptoes around the issue every time, which is not always that much fun. The environment design seems significantly weak to me. There's a major tendency to make large spaces that look wrong - all the casinos just seem ghostly and empty, corridors often too wide, rooms too big. There's that tendency in all the Bethesda RPGs of course, but it's here in spades. I don't feel the world makes all that much sense compared to F3. The idea that a Vegas could still operate on the draw of gambling seems slightly absurd. So many factions just sort of co-existing alongside each other while in open hostility - it's hard to see what the benefit is for them. And the way they all conveniently let you get involved in their inner machinations. It just doesn't ring true for me - it's all very conveniently set up for an open-world RPG, but there's much more of a Truman-show-esque sense of showmanship to it that I didn't feel as much in F3. (Of course this could be a plus according to taste, there's clearly a lot more openly wacky stuff in NV). I don't feel the author's hand in much of what I do in NV, where I felt it was very strong and compelling in F3. I understand what was being satirised in the Republic of Dave, or the ghoul situation at Tenpenny Towers. Maybe there is that aspect in NV, but I've yet to find anything of such substance. For example there's a questline involving a set of religious ghouls, and cool things happen in it, but it doesn't really go anywhere interesting for me - it's very much a weak retread of the Oasis section in F3 for me. While I feel so far the quests have been much more detailed and have more variety than F3, they don't communicate any ideas really, which for me is a massive part of what I loved about F3.   This all sounds very negative. I still think NV is a great game :)."
patientgamers,3amdar,Alex__V,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:43:36 2015 UTC,"Well put. I couldn't bring myself to finish NV because I didn't feel like there was a narrative I was following. Too many factions, political conflicts, and like you said, every faction had a dark side and I always found myself just kind of playing everyone because I didn't really sympathize with any of them."
patientgamers,3alt32,MrBriski,11,Sun Jun 21 14:02:17 2015 UTC,"Afterfall InSanity - Extended Edition  Never heard of this game? Be happy. It may possibly be the worst game I've ever played. However it was the first game I've decided to conquer my backlog with (including every game I own), and I really want to push through to complete.  Despite it being a bad game though, I've found myself actually enjoying it. I've gone through a recent change where I'm judging games less for the content, mechanics, graphics, voice-acting, whatever - and actually just sitting back and taking what the devs have given me. I've put myself in there shoes and ask ""What was their goal with this game?"" I then try to play that game. With Aftefall, it's worked so far.    Super Mario Bros. (SNES)  I decided I also want to start playing some retro games, because more often than not I see adults with nostalgia of the old games and I'd actually like to experience it myself. Super Mario Bros. was the first one I chose, and it's actually not that bad of an experience.  I'm quite good at modern platformers, especially Mario, however the older games are much harder than what is expected today. If you die at 4-4, you go back to 4-1? In only 5 lives? Crazy! However it has made me appreciate the difficulty back then. I'm currently on World 8. Memorized the first and second levels, now I'm trying to get through 8-3, and 8-4 is quite an easy one, I'm just making stupid mistakes once I get there.  -Briski"
patientgamers,3alt32,Hardtopickaname,5,Sun Jun 21 14:12:25 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that Mario was considered to be on the easier side of NES platformers.  Take a look at this list if you want a bigger retro challenge.

patientgamers,3alt32,WakaIsMyWaifu,3,Tue Jun 23 19:47:41 2015 UTC,The combat system seems very repetitive and is not as dynamic as games like Shadow of Mordor and Arkham Asylum.  Combat seems very clunky in this game.  What saves it is that you need to actually use items in a fight to boost Geralt so you have a chance to win.  A lot of games don't require you to use a lot of the loot you pick up to progress through the game.  Combat in the Witcher requires potions and oils at certain points or it makes the fight ridiculously difficult.

I still can't figure out how they managed to make it look like that, AND RUN on a PS3. Amazing. I'm also playing through Sleeping Dogs (PC).

The oldies I played from those days were Might and Magic 6 and The Dark Eye 3 - Shadows over Riva, so I have a bit nostalgia to draw upon, but not too much. This game is basically a one-shot pony, but does very well what it's supposed to do. Also the puzzles feel right and don't insult my intelligence (looking at you, Skyrim!). Playing on Easy but with manual mapping, definitely oldschool feel. Insurgency. The COOP checkpoint mode is a blast most of the time. People who run and gun get punished pretty fast, so they either adapt or quit. If there are people who communicate then it's really amazing. Critter Crunch. Bought a while ago for the COOP and had enough quite soon. Picked up the single player because I wanted something casual, couldn't put down the controller. There's something about swallowing wierd lifeforms whole."

Finally, I've been exploring Drox Operative a bit when I don't quite have the time to dig into the Witcher. Really interesting game! It reminds me a bit of the ""live galaxy"" aspect of Star Control II that I loved ... if you don't act in time, races will fall and quests will be failed. Combat is pretty traditional ARPG-ish, but levelling up and looting is fun."

I've never played any turn-based strategy games except for the Civ series before, and I never really got into the battle-side of things there much. I really like this style of game combined with action though; the pace allows me to think everything through and helps keep the game from becoming too overwhelming.  After playing for a few hours yesterday though, I had to take a break. My best and favourite soldier, Major Shane ""Spitfire"" Tucker, who happened to be Canadian like me, was ambushed and killed. It felt like it came out of nowhere. I wasn't expecting for the loss of a little video game soldier to hit me like it did, but kudos to the game for getting me to care even with no actual backstories."
patientgamers,3alt32,limination,5,Sun Jun 21 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"That's how the game gets ya. You get a favorite squaddie, kit him out, give him a nickname like Cpt. Badass, and then he's snatched from you over some bullshit RNG miracle. You feel that loss in your core, and then you hate the green rook you have to put in his place next mish because he couldn't shoot the ground if he was laying down.   Such an awesome game."

I've heard the praises of this game, mostly from Rich Evans of Previously Recorded. I am having a blast. I love me some tactical combat and while the terror missions got some rage out of me before I learned how to handle them, I'm progressing nicely. I neglected to build more satellites early on so I started running out of funds but now XCOM is running smoothly and I'm building the Hyperwave Relay. The only thing I'm really struggling with is figuring out how to use Heavies to best effect. My Assault/Sniper/Support teams tear Xenos up.  I read advice to learn Enemy Unknown before jumping into Enemy Within, also from the summer sale, so that's what I'm doing. I'm thinking about an Ironman game for Enemy Within.

patientgamers,3alt32,mr_balthuk,3,Sun Jun 21 20:02:00 2015 UTC,"Looking at the Steam summer sale.  Can somebody help me chose between Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, Arkham Asylum, Dishonored, Tomb Raider, and the Witcher?  I'm up for whatever. I haven't played any of those series so starting with the first of any of them isn't a requirement as long as it's cheap.  In terms of gameplay I'm up for anything although I prefer action to a really immersive RPG slog. I made it through Skyrim on console and enjoyed it, although it might have been a little too deep. I liked New Vegas a lot."
patientgamers,3alt32,ronintetsuro,4,Mon Jun 22 03:05:55 2015 UTC,"I know the summer sale is over, but here's my opinions of the 3 games of that list I've played:  3) Batman: Arkham Asylum. You legit feel like Batman in a lot of situations. The story is pretty good, the villains feel menacing and true to origin and it's an awesomely atmospheric setting.  2) The Witcher. The combat is pretty bad. Install the good combat mod (forget the name) which helps but doesn't fix it completely. Put it on easy if needed and revel in the amazing characters, story, dialogue and lovingly crafted world. The fact that I'm putting it above games like AA and Civ V despite the bad combat should tell you how much I loved the story and the world.  1) Tomb Raider. If you can get only one more game, this is my recommendation. copy pasta of steam review I wrote after finishing the game:  I loved the game. The Island is dripping with character. Every fight feels out of control. There are some annoying things about the game for sure. Quicktime events can get annoying, the boss fights all feel the same, but the good stuff outweigh these minor issues by a large margin.  You can feel Lara's progression throughout the game. When you use badass combos in the later game to dispatch of the enemy, it's a sharp contrast to the scared girl trying to survive at the beginning of game. As Lara progresses through the Island, she starts taking the fight to the Solarii. It's a very well done origin story.  The various extras in the game are mostly unnecessary. Documents add a lot of detail to the main story, so I'd definitely try to find as many of those as possible. Relics are very cool as well. GPS caches are useless except to unlock character models and such. They add some replayability to the game, but if you don't care about 100% you can mostly ignore them.  At the end, the game is a shining example of breathtaking presentation and near perfect gameplay. If you're a fan of adventure games, this is definitely among the best of the current generation of gaming.  I played Bioshock for a few hours and it's about as atmospheric as a game can get. It's scary though and I took a break then got kind of detached from the story. Plan on coming back to this later. Currently playing Assassin's Creed. The gameplay and controls are tight and it's worth a playthrough just because of that, but so far the story, settings, characters are all a bit hollow. I wouldn't recommend it over the 3 games I listed above."

patientgamers,3alt32,donwallo,3,Fri Jun 26 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished Deus Ex GOTY for the first time.  I liked it but did not love it. I might have been more impressed if I had not played the Thief series about a month ago, also for the first time. I think the Thief games have not only better gameplay (though obviously more limited) but also better art design and world design and dialogue.  For me Deus Ex had high lows - meaning I never really disliked it, but only a few exceptional highs. The highest high for me was the airport hangar level and its resolution, partially because of the music. The lowest low was just that the last level was a little too sprawling and complicated, as is so often the case in games. (Thief 2 was much worse in this regard.)  Another thing that may have worked against it Deus Ex for me is that though Deus Ex may have done it first and best, subsequent games have also done the globe-spanning high-tech epic plot. I guess I had in mind Deus Ex: HR and the Mass Effect series.  But I suspect what really separates appreciators of Deus Ex from lovers is that I was not very impressed by the political rhetoric that turns up so often. People sometimes call this game ""philosophical"" but I saw no evidence of philosophizing. I saw different characters mimicking different dogmas, sometimes cleverly but incoherently (the Silhouette semioticians, if politics is nothing but rhetoric, why risk your life in preference for one rhetoric over another?), sometimes lamely (Tracer Tong, how does a multiplicity of nations solve the problem of tyranny?), sometimes smugly and question-beggingly (Morpheus, it would be too verbose to clarify here.)  If these speeches were placed in actual arguments that a real person might make I might have been thrilled, but as it was I was a little intrigued but mostly frustrated."

I am actually currently playing both Deus Ex GOTY and Theif 1  (Gold) for the first time and I agree with your points.

patientgamers,3alt32,Levago,2,Wed Jun 24 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"It isn't as difficult as it looks. It is time consuming and you have to read a whole lot, but definitely worth it. The modders have done a wonderful job creating comprehensive, easy to follow guides with lists of good mods that you should start out with. I have never modded anything in my life and I found it relatively easy to find and install a set of mods that haven't really affected performance on my mediocre PC too much and looks miles better than the vanilla game.  I definitely recommend you give a shot at modding. It's fun in itself, and it really improves the game cosmetically and UI/HUD wise."

Crafting equipment, armor, weapons, from nothing.  Surviving zombie hordes, stockpiling resources.  Very good game with good developers who are releasing regular updates.  Also, the community isn't as toxic as DayZ, Rust, H1N1, etc.  Halfway  this is a turn-based isometric strategy game sort of like an Xcom lite.  I got it off GOG for a couple of bucks and am having a great time with it.  The graphics are good enough and the gameplay more than makes up for it."

It was quite enraging to have to sit through that cutscene over and over again.  This week I'm finishing up Uncharted 2 on the PS3 and playing Yoshi's New Island on the 3DS.  I'm also playing some Ghost Trick on the iphone.  The most exciting new game I'm playing is Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin.  It's the one game I bought during the Steam sale.

Have had many enjoyable/frustrating hours trying to upgrade my castle and beat the bosses. The upgrade system is what I think really stands out in this game. It adds many layers to the way you play and invites a lot of strategy to be used during each play through. I was a little disappointed with the 'randomly' generated levels. The levels are random but the difference between each run is not that great. Overall, I am really enjoying the game and will probably end up putting many more hours into it before deciding to move on to something else."

I wish this one had a track editor and more options for multiplayer (instead of just elimination, and mirror mode unlocked after beating the solo game), because as it is, it's pretty light on content. you get the 'race on every level' achievement sometime during the 3rd cup, which is kinda disappointing.  there are 7 cups with 6 races each and you can advance pretty fast, but if you want gold in every race, you'll need a lot of patience, some of them can be pretty challenging, and often frustrating. that's why I wasn't aiming for that at all, and just had enough stars to unlock the final boss race. I replayed a few fun levels to get enough money to unlock all the cars though. my total playtime was about 3.5 hours, but with a couple more you can probably 100% the whole thing, though getting 1 million coins seems way too tedious for a game with such little content.  speaking of, a few things I didn't like: no volume sliders. how the fuck do devs keep missing this? especially since both values are in the settings.dat file in the saves folder, though altering them and even making the file read-only doesn't seem to work. and alt+tab turns the game into windowed and you have to press alt+enter to change it back. also, the fucking achievement progress keeps popping up after every. fucking. race. there's one for getting 1 million coins and you get at least a few in every race (my counter was around 650k when I was done). besides these issues, it's a neat little game but I doubt it'll ever get more content, even as paid dlc, which is a shame.  tera (last week): the lvl59 avatar weapon is so good, killing stuff ceased to be a chore once again, even if only for a limited time probably. there's also some sort of summer event going on, one from lvl50, involving various repeatable minigames on the beach, and one from 59, which is a bit more varied and involved, and one of the questlines is an irritating piece of shit (you're in a room with a gazillion mobs and have to run around and do stuff), so I skipped that. I also cleared a few more areas this week (except for bams and dungeons), making some progress, but not that much. I managed to reach lvl60 in the meantime, which took 150 million xp from 59, but apparently it's only 1.1 billion to reach 61, not 1.5 as I remembered. what a relief... I still have some pre-60 content left to do (mostly bams and dungeons), then I'll move on to the final areas of the 3rd continent.  need for speed: hot pursuit (2010): I managed to complete some of the more difficult races I had trouble with last week, and reached lvl13 both as a cop and a racer, so no more new cars or anything, but I still have about 15 events to go, one of which is an intercept that's driving me crazy, I simply can't catch the bastard but I've come this close several times. we did a little multiplayer again, which was fun too, especially the 2v2 pursuits."

Loving the game, the weird and complex world, the weight that is put on good & evil, in law or chaos.   Despite being a fairly linear game, it feels like the most open-world game I've played to this day, not because I can choose where to go, but really how I want to behave and not feeling like I was imposed a good character by the game. D&D universe allows this, because of the complex alignement system.  I'm on the Clerk's Ward now, with about 25h gameplay total, and taking it slow.

The advice to start with AC2 is something I've heard a lot, though others say it's more important to play in order. AC3 gets a lot of hate, but it was my first game into the series and I loved it. Ended up being fine playing things out of order.  It all depends on what kind of gamer you are though. Chronology may be very important to you, or it could be popularity. AC2 is probably an easier introduction than what I've had. I would never advice skipping and I do kind of regret not starting with the first, but just look around for reviews and responses and decide for yourself what seems best for you."

patientgamers,3al7mq,WillTheKill,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was somewhat considering getting a refund after messing with the graphical settings for about 30 minutes.  Aside from putting everything on the lowest quality settings, I wasn't able to get an amazing framerate.  My PC specs are solid enough to where I really should be able to run on near the highest settings with successful results.  After hovering through some of the community posts about this issue for a while, I sort of figured that it's the same for everyone else, and on top of that, the game has barely been in early access for three weeks.  So I settled on medium-ish settings and the framerate is decent enough to where it's still playable.  I suppose after a few big updates a couple of months down the road, it will be much better optimized for a lot of folks.  This the first open-world survival game of sorts that I've bought, but I also think it has potential to end up being one of the first dinosaur themed video games I have played in a long time that isn't a complete dud for me.  I look forward to experimenting with it more."

I tend to like grand strategy games (think Paradox games, Total War, Age of Wonders, Endless Legend, ect) and i like the long ones. like Marathon speed on Civilization. so a single game for me can take as much as 150 hours of playtime. this tends to... shorten the list of games i play. especially when those games have so good replayability you can easily finding yourself play a different nation again and again.  As far as top rated AAA games go, its a hit or miss with me. i like some, i dont like some. I do tend to stay away from indies a bit. Nothing against them in thoery, but the ones i played i didnt really enjoy. for example a lot of them are into retro gaming, and i dont want that. if i wanted a retro game i would just fire up one of the old games. And i also dont like minimalism/walking simulator.   But hey if you enjoy them more power to you. to each his own."

I'm sure this one will go lower, and the complete steam edition would've been cheaper than the dlc on origin half off but I like physical copies."

I personally played the regular Metro 2033 on Ultra and then the redux version at a friend's for about an hour or so, and there's a significant difference, not just in therms of details but changes to style and look of the game (for example, light switches, computers, our wristwatch, all have very different models).

COD games are not known for their plot so I'm not sure how fun the single player would actually be for you.    Me, I'd spend my money elsewhere.  I mean $10 is not a lot of scratch but I don't think I'd get $10 worth of enjoyment out of that game personally."

patientgamers,3amb2i,Kukantiz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt the population is that good, and if I were to guess, hacked to death. The game is old enough as it is, and not a lot of people were a fan of it in the first place."
patientgamers,3akne8,dolphins3,7,Sun Jun 21 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"There is a remake of the first game for PSP, I've just completed it. Try PCSX2 emulator for the second game, it may have some issues but seems to work.  No other ways as far as I know."
patientgamers,3akne8,kamimaiku,3,Sun Jun 21 03:38:11 2015 UTC,There's also Convenant of the Plume for the NDS.
patientgamers,3akne8,FantasyHeaven,3,Sun Jun 21 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"The first game goes for $100+ on eBay since it's a rare game so you will probably want to just emulate it.  I enjoyed VP on the PS and thought it had a very unique style, being a side scroller until you went into battles and it turned into a combo-obtaining turn-based RPG and there was the time limit until Ragnarok.  VP: Silmeria never really felt the same to me, but it was still a good game though.    If you were to get a PS2 to play Silmeria, you could always play any PS1 game on it as well, so you would only need to buy a PS2.    You could also check out Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume on the DS.  It's a tactical RPG, so it's a bit different than the others, but I haven't played it myself yet to see how it actually is."
patientgamers,3akne8,rarelypost,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:03:37 2015 UTC,First one is going for $100 eh? Damn.. might have to bust it out of storage now. Didn't realize it was such a rare game. I had a ton of fun with it when it came out.
patientgamers,3akne8,drummererb,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:36:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's been going for around $100 for years now actually.  My friend bought one for $90 probably 8 or 9 years ago because they loved the game and that's how I ended up playing it."
patientgamers,3akne8,rarelypost,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:30:57 2015 UTC,"the last time I tried emulating VP1 was.... fuck a decade ago? my PC wasn't really a good one so I couldn't emulate it properly as stated, it is also available for the PSP but never really played it there either. I'm not sure if it's a 100% port or not.  VP2 does work well with PCSX2 according to my friend."
patientgamers,3akne8,antemon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:18:14 2015 UTC,"VP1: PS version (North America) -- emulate with ePSXe. I purchased a copy wayy back when and made an iso image b/c apparently the disc will become unplayable due to a single scratch. Emulate the North American version only. It has superior weapons sorting... that said...  VP:L : PSP version (North America) -- if you have a PSP, then just buy and play the game. If you ripped the ISO from the PSP disc b/c you are sick of the inability to skip frames (I have little patience for how slow some of the cutscenes can be especially on your third or fourth play of the game), then use PPSSPP to emulate. If you have a decent PC capable of playing modern games, you should have no problem.   The problem is this version is based on the JP version which has the world's shittest weapon sorting system. But, there are CGI cutscenes which changes everything to be honest.   Now, that brings me to ... VP:S: Do not cheat using any conventional cheating methods. Your game will freeze at chapter 5. Do not do any weird editing to the game or your game will freeze at Chapter 5. It plays fine emulated, but I played it on a PS2...  Someone also mentioned VP:CotP, but it is for Nintendo DS, but that can be emulated using Desmume and has no . The NA version has no voice acting, but oddly enough, the JP version does."

patientgamers,3aj0q4,hidora,3,Sun Jun 21 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"Vice City and San Andreas are the games that people used to play for screwing around for fun around here. SA in particular seems to be the favorite of many people for that.  4 is a bit more story driven, I think."
patientgamers,3aj0q4,theindigamer,4,Sat Jun 20 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"In case you are interested in all of them, you should go with the GTA complete pack which is cheaper. GTA IV has lots of mods both gameplay-wise (for example you can be Iron Man) and graphical (see iCEnhancer videos). Not sure about the other games. The Ballad of Gay Tony has a fun campaign from EFLC."
patientgamers,3aj0q4,theindigamer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:43:02 2015 UTC,"In that case you should probably stay away from The Ballad of Gay Tony. After every mission, there is a score/rating shown depending on how well you completed the optional objective(s). I personally don't like that system at all as it makes you feel that you didn't play well even if you did complete the mission alright.  I think you should try Vice City. San Andreas was also good but it had a LOT of driving just to get from point A to point B if you aren't using the jetpack cheat (>_<). Have only played a small part of III; it is fun for the first ~5 hours but nowhere as fun as Vice City."
patientgamers,3aj0q4,TheStender,3,Sat Jun 20 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"I just went through GTA III and it wasn't hard at all to do the missions.

If you have some extra money it's worth trying, if not then I would pass. Check out some game play videos before you decide. There's not a lot of action or fighting, a lot of scavenging and just trying to survive in a war torn country. If that sounds interesting to you, check it out."

Great prices  FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.  It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it. NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.

patientgamers,3ajxm6,Jaxell,12,Sun Jun 21 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"DayZ, whether the mod or standalone, is not worth playing anymore as there are far better survival games out there now.  Ark, Reign of Kings and 7 Days to Die are all better than DayZ could ever hope to be.  Even H1Z1 is better, though not as much as the others listed, while being very similar to DayZ."
patientgamers,3ajxm6,iamalurkergoddammit,3,Sun Jun 21 05:57:17 2015 UTC,"I read a bunch of posts researching just this question myself, and even the people on the DayZ subreddit overwhelmingly and emphatically say that the orignal Arma II mod is far superior (more features, more players, everything better) than the standalone.   Be sure to get combined operations, though, as it is required for both the DayZ mod and apparently regular Arma II multiplayer as well."
patientgamers,3ajxm6,Pseutri,3,Sun Jun 21 04:33:55 2015 UTC,"Many people say that the DayZ is a lot better as a mod than it is as a standalone. If you want to play the actual ArmA, then buy ArmA 3."

patientgamers,3ajxm6,Toonah,2,Sun Jun 21 07:59:38 2015 UTC,"The DayZ mod is not what it used to be, I wouldn't even call it hardcore survival anymore. 99% of the servers you play on are modded to hell, with ridiculous starting gear (basically fully geared) and insane loot spawns everywhere on the map. It's basically a death match on the coast, with little to no need to interact with other players, which IMO was one of the core aspects of the game.  It is possible to find a vanilla server but you still have to deal with badmins."

Extremely polished PC port that runs well on older hardware as well.  I'd suggest Dishonored but it's hard to really say without knowing what kinds of games you're interested in or what kind of experience you're looking for."
patientgamers,3aknwf,rarelypost,5,Sun Jun 21 04:12:00 2015 UTC,"If you want a long exploration game that will give you 100+ hours easily, get one of the Fallout GOTY editions.  If you want a gritty fairytale crime drama that plays similarly to Telltale's other game The Walking Dead, get The Wolf Among Us.  If you want to sneak around and take out some bad people, get Dishonored.  And if you want a very artistic game with a simple yet challenging combat system, get Transistor.  Also get the GOTY edition of Dishonored whenever you do pick it up.  I've heard the DLCs are worth it, and like every Bethesda game the DLCs will always be more pricey than just buying the GOTY edition.  You have a whole day to decide though, since the sale ends at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Monday."
patientgamers,3aknwf,lemeure,4,Sun Jun 21 05:20:21 2015 UTC,"fallout will give you a longer time sink, but wolf among us has a great story, I enjoyed it more than fallout personally.  It really depends on what you want out of the games."
patientgamers,3aknwf,the_frickerman,3,Sun Jun 21 03:32:09 2015 UTC,"If you are to buy one of the Fallouts, I'd recommend New Vegas. It has the same game engine as Fallout 3, but the story is longer, better imho, the secondary quests are far better connected to the main story in comparison to 3, you have A LOT more weapons, there is a rep system with different factions that really affect outcomes in the main story, practically the same perks and abilities as in 3 and the same vastness and extreme attention to detail.  Then I also like NVÂ´s DLCs better than F3, but that's just my sujective opinion."

patientgamers,3ajhxa,blakeismyhomeboy,5,Sun Jun 21 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"1) Not so much this year (Persona 5 is a big one), but next year has Uncharted 4, The Last Guardian, Horizons New Dawn (potentially) and if everything goes according to plan, Shenmue 3 will be coming as well.   2) Don't think so. Sony has their The Show franchise going of course, but noone else has seemed to do anything re baseball.   3) Game updates are free, and you don't need to connect the PS4 to the net to play titles day 1.I'm not as well versed on the XB1 so can't say there.   4) PS4, easily. Looking at their upcoming lineup, I personally see more I'd like to play. They're also stronger with exclusives than MS is. Also I feel that the Japanese focus brings games that are different to the fare I normally play so it's a nice change of pace. They're behind on software updates IMO, but the games make up for that. Though, I should note that with the XB1 getting backwards compatibility you could profit very well from getting an XB1 and playing exclusives you never got to last gen.   As usual, look at what console has the features you like, and what system your friends play on (in case you do choose to go online) and go from there. /r/PS4 and /r/xboxone are great places to look. Best of luck :)."

Super Mega Baseball is a great game. It's very cartoony but it plays like a true baseball game and it's really fun. It is currently on PS3 and PS4 but I think an X1 version is coming."
patientgamers,3ajhxa,WeWereInfinite,3,Mon Jun 22 09:25:51 2015 UTC,"uncharted series dunno yes, you can update without a subscription i prefer xbox one, because of halo. and you should check out ea access. it comes with a lot of sports games.   i am an online gamer, and xbox live offers very good online services. i believe every exclusive multiplayer game runs on dedicated servers, which make a huge difference in lag. but that won't matter to you."
patientgamers,3ajhxa,PilotReeo,3,Sun Jun 21 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"I'm an Xbox fanboy, have been since 2001, but I'll try to be objective.   Uncharted 4 looks super promising, Bloodborne is very popular 3rd person game like Dark Souls, I'm not a fan of trailers for Last Guardian but people seem excited for it, Persona 5 will be awesome and of course GT7, Killzone, Infamous and probably God of War. Edit: Totally forgot about Horizon, that looks great too We have RBI Baseball 2015 (I think its also on android and other systems), but the focus on Xbox has been more soccer, football and hockey. Game updates should be completely free on both consoles. Obviously you need an internet connection for that and I think the Xbox has a one time connection need for startup (don't quote me on that) I prefer the Xbox One. I'm a huge sports and shooting gamer and having EA as a major partner since the 360 has kept me with Xbox. GwG and this recent announcement of free backwards compatibility has kept me from considering switching to Sony in recently as well. You really cannot go wrong with either console, they both have a great slate of games coming up and both do roughly the same amount of work."
patientgamers,3ajhxa,Evilan,2,Sun Jun 21 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"Have you played GT and Forza? If so which one's better?

patientgamers,3ajhxa,Ryukononon,3,Sun Jun 21 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Forza is better than GT. I used to be a GT Fanboy but when i got Forza, i never changed back. It has car customisation, custom paintjobs, actual damage modelling, Top Gear, V8 Supercars etc. I don't know about PCars or AC but for me I would choose Forza. Horizon 2 is magnificent!"
patientgamers,3ajhxa,Evilan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:28:21 2015 UTC,I haven't played either of them. The last racing game I touched was PGR. I'm sure there is a huge racing gamer with better insight somewhere though.
patientgamers,3ajhxa,TGiddy,3,Sun Jun 21 00:12:24 2015 UTC,I'm planning on getting a PS4 this time around. Main reason is because I'm not big into multiplayer games so Halo and Gears has never really interested me. PS4 has The Show baseball game and Xbox doesn't have any as far as I know. If you're into single player experiences over multiplayer than I'd go for PS4 otherwise check out Xbox.
patientgamers,3ajhxa,Reas0n,3,Sun Jun 21 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"Hi! I own all 3 major consoles. I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't really intend to. I got my Xbox because it was an amazing Black Friday deal. The PS and Wii U were gifts, so I'm pretty unbiased.    What sort of exclusives does the PS4 have that would be worth getting? I already have a PS3 so TLoU Remastered isn't really a selling point.    Neither console currently has an exclusive that, in my opinion, qualifies as a ""selling point"". That's actually really sad, isn't it? I'm sure you know all the major first-party franchises and new titles for both sides, but none are here yet.    Does the XB1 have a baseball game, either now or in the pipeline?    It will most likely get a 2K game in the future, but the only one right now is RBI. If baseball is a factor, you probably want to go with Playstation. Nothing beats The Show.    I don't plan on getting XBL or PS+ no matter what because online means nothing to me. Will I be able to update my games for free or do those require the subscription online service?    Updates are free.    Finally, and obviously, which do you prefer and why?    A few months ago I would have said neither, but after this recent e3, I think I prefer the Xbox. They had more stuff that caught my eye. I think that new controller might be worth the money, too. If baseball is important to you, you might have to go with PS by default, though."
patientgamers,3ajhxa,Boris_Ignatievich,2,Sun Jun 21 12:17:21 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in baseball, isn't that cartoony one from late last year/early this a playstation exclusive? They also get a butt ton of japanese games that don't hit xb1, although there still isn't a huge collection as devs have been kinda slow to move to ps4 for whatever reason. and bloodborne, obviously. And then all the stuff that got announced this week is obviously filling out 2016, but yeah, not much right now not a clue tbh updates etc are free, I went about 9 months without paying for PS plus until there was a month where I got Â£40 worth of games I want for the Â£40 annual sub - only thing you can't do is play online I went PS4, because I prefer the sorts of games they tend to get as exclusives over those on XBox  (also the impression I get is that XB gets fewer 'true' exclusives as they port almost everything to windows, but I might be wrong there) Don't thing there is really a bad choice though"

PS4 might have more right now, I don't know for sure, but both consoles are kind of lacking in good exclusives IMO."

The ps4 has mlb the show for baseball.  You'll be able to update the games for free. You can always leave the ps4 connected, and it'll download the updates as long as you keep it in rest mode.

I've played my Xbone a lot more and like it a lot more. From a technical perspective the PS4 is better, but i'm a fan of the UI and system.   Baseball is a lot better on the PS4. I've found online sport games (I play a lot of hockey and golf with family across the country) to be better on the Xbone. Online won't apply to you though."
patientgamers,3ajhxa,Celebrandas,2,Sun Jun 21 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"Unless I somehow come into a ton of money, I won't be getting either. It's not that I'm some PC elitist, it's just that they're expensive. That being said, I would prefer a PS4 to the XB1 simply because I have a loyalty to Sony consoles from my old PS3 that I gave to a friend. I prefer their controllers as well.  If I got either one, though preferably a PS4, I'd probably get the online for a year whenever it went on sale (which does happen) simply because of the free games that come with it. I'd never play online, but I'd add those games to create a good backlog that I could fall back on."
patientgamers,3ajhxa,Rockyn,0,Sun Jun 21 01:17:17 2015 UTC,"I really don't like the whole ""free games"" thing from the subscription services because they aren't really free; you can only play them as long as you're subscribed. Also, downloadable games take a ton of hard drive space."

I also don't plan on subscribing unless the subscription cards are on sale, which does happen from time to time. As for the games taking up a ton of hard drive space, I believe the PS4 has 500GB of space... Judging by the collection of 40+ games (most of which are a little bit older, but it's almost all from 2004-2012) on my 1TB hard drive laptop, those games combined with everything else on my computer take up ~300GB. I know some newer games can be 50-60GB, but that's still several games on the system, and the ""free"" games are linked to your account, so they don't have to be downloaded to the system unless you want to play them."

Really excited about the upcoming Crackdown game too. Always loved that one.  E3 this year showed off some pretty great titles on both systems but again Xbox did it for me. The Rare Replay is pretty exciting even though i have 90% of the games already. Re-Core looked interesting, the indies are great to see on consoles too but PS4 also has those.   That being said i do want a PS4, new Ratchet & Clank is way too tempting."

Even though I Have a 360, if you had asked before E3 I would have said the PS4 but afterwards? Definitely the XBone.   In terms of exclusive games you don't have many game changers on either system if you aren't already a fan of the series that are exclusive(For instance I Love Halo and that was a huge factor for me, though it might not be for you.  What clinched it for me was the backwards Compatibility. Being able to play the next few years of new games while also playing my huge library of 360 games too? No brainer on that one because even though its a new system and everything, there are still amazing games from past gen(Skyrim!) That you will be able to play and those games are dirt cheap if you font have them but still give days and days of usage.  Microsoft's E3 blew me away and Sony's... Felt meh to me. Few release dates a bunch of remakes/remasters and COD DLC coming to PS before Xbox.  For the patient gamer? I'd recommended the One"

There's strong indications and rumors that a significant amount of the XB1's ""back catalog"" (MCC, Forza, etc) is going to be heading to the PC, so you can play them there at higher framerates and resolutions  I'm not a big Sportsball gamer, but Sony's The Show is supposed to be an excellent baseball game. Hockey/football/basketball are all well represented on both sides but the PS4 is a stronger machine technically so it should give you a better visual experience there.  The PS4 is also bringing some pretty solid exclusives looking at the E3 lineups.  As for the Rare collection? You have a PC. Emulate away."

It will add missions through out the game.  It will add ways to improve your soldiers.  I would say get EW and also add The Long War mod and maybe you'll finish by the time the sequel comes out near the end of the year.
patientgamers,3ajjja,Flatulent_Grunthos,2,Sat Jun 20 20:46:07 2015 UTC,I've heard the Long War mod makes the game extremely difficult. Would you recommend it for the first playthrough?
patientgamers,3ajjja,garscow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"honestly i've never finished the game, I got close on EU then EW came out and I started over.  Got distracted with work and other games and i've started over a couple more times.  Installed the Long War recently and had to start over for that LOL.  Work is kicking my ass again, so my play time for everything is minimal, but that being said... If you are over 1/2 way thru the game i'd say finish it with EU or start over with all 3 installed if you aren't going for multiple plays.    So far the Long War does make it a bit more difficult, but the aspects it brings to the game I think makes it worth it.  Just make sure you play on the easiest level which is normal I believe.  With vanilla EU/EW you could power through with pretty much 1 team of soldiers for all the missions give or take a couple extra for when you do need some medical recovery time.  The Long War forces to you use multiple teams since your soldiers get ""fatigued"" after each mission."

It may not bear itself out in actual review scores over time, but I definitely see the sentiment among the actual gamers. To pick a random example: Bloodborne. Now, I'm not saying that it's a bad game, but it's not really anything special. It's just basically another Dark Souls game... which we got DS2 last year and are getting DS3 next year and forget about any other clones out/coming out and thinking about all that just makes me tired of the entire type of game. So while Bloodborne might be a good game, it doesn't - or shouldn't - really stand out; there's nothing that it does that sets it apart from other Dark Souls (type of) games."
patientgamers,3ajgb6,karma_the_llama,2,Sat Jun 20 22:58:23 2015 UTC,It's odd how polar opposite opinions can be...

And DS2 is also on that list. There isn't actually necessary to make a original or special game to make a good game, all you need is to make a good game. And from what I have read about Bloodborne it is more action orientated that the other games, it have a new setting and new story, and there is also some procedural generated dungeons. And this was something a lot of people liked.  Several of the other games on the top 20 aren't special games, they are just good games. I do see where you are coming from though, there have been very little originality this generation. Both in new IPs and exploration of new concepts."

patientgamers,3ajgb6,KatsumeBlisk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:44:56 2015 UTC,Let's say Bloodborne is overrated - is it because of its exclusivity? I doubt it. It's much more likely it's overrated because of the massive popularity (among its fans) of that style of game from that particular creator. I think Bloodborne would have got high ratings if it were multi-format.
patientgamers,3ajgb6,Alex__V,6,Sun Jun 21 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"On the top 20 metascore games for ps4 of all time only 1 is completely exclusive, and a few of the other also appear on other Sony devices or on PC. Some of the much hyped games on the PS4 were The Ordrer and DriveClub. Both did failed to revived great scores.  The list for Xbox One do have some console exclusives that also appear on PC like Ori and the Blind Forest and Titanfall. But there is no game in the top 20 that is only available for Xbox One, most are available on PC or 360 if not on ever console. Sunset Overdrive one of new and exclusives IP for Xbone is on 33th place with a metascore of 81.  Nintendo have some more exclusives. And most of them are made by Nintendo, unlike MS and Sony that ""buy"" their exclusives. As their console is quite a bit different from the two others they are not getting all the multiplatform games and naturally the console will have more exclusives on the top. And currently both the PS4 and Xbox One lacks exclusives."

It does, but it's not particularly violent - no blood and guts, and they only get KOd. Young boys like violence, and it's pretty much the safest violence you get - I think it's a completely reasonable middle-ground for parents and kids. There's also a lot of emphasis on taking care of your pokÃ©mon in the latest games; feeding them, petting them, generally being friends with them, etc. One of OP's kids is ten, which is about a year after the age I started playing pokÃ©mon, and it's really a great game for kids - would help a lot with reading comprehension, too."

And on top of that, nigh-inifnitely customizable with mods if the base game gets too bland.  The easiest way is to get one of the many custom launchers (Technic launcher and FeedTheBeast come to mind) that can install a variety of full pre-built packages of mods, that run fairly stable and are pre-configured. Many are all-around for advanced players with thousands of things at once, but there is a fair amount of themed collections, often including just a handful of things."

patientgamers,3af941,msing,8,Fri Jun 19 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Thomas Was Alone is a really neat game. It's about an errant piece of AI that gains independent thought, with a great story and beautiful music. It's also on basically any platform you could think of.  There's also games like OlliOlli 1 and 2. Those are some hard skateboarding games. They're pretty fun :)  You could also see if they're interested in adventure games. Monkey Island is (in my opinion) the greatest series of point 'n' click games ever. The first 2 are available as remasters with fancy-schmancy graphics and voice acting, and the third has those things as well.   You could also take a look at whatever popular YouTubers have made let's plays of. Games like Snuggle Truck can be fun (albeit rage-inducing).   Speedrunners is a game about superheroes racing to get to the scene of the crime first. It's kind of like a 2d platformer version of Mario Kart, and is great when you're playing with people you know.  Peggle is a pretty fun game, but I'm not taking any responsibility for Peggle addiction."

Both are super-pretty, fun, not-too-hard and a real joy to play.   Another lovely and interesting one is Never Alone. It's a co-op puzzler, but it is also an educational game. Educational in this sense means, the game was developed in partnership with the Inupiat people from Alaska, and their stories form the base for this game.   Last, Stacking. Another puzzle-ish adventure where you play as the smallest of a Russian doll 'family' and set out to rescue your siblings who have been kidnapped by an industrialist. Pretty, fun, and also great fodder for talking with your kids about stuff like the industrial revolution and child labor."
patientgamers,3af941,Relenq,5,Fri Jun 19 21:16:18 2015 UTC,"Hello, I am 21 and Ive been playing video games since I was 3. Some games I can recommend looking back to my own childhood are:   Tycoon w/e (So this one is one of the best games for a kid. There are tons of different tycoon games where you build and maintain a business, like in Zoo tycoon where you need to create a zoo with attractions for visitors and then collect revenue whilst making sure you dont have too many expenses. But as I said, there are tons of different ones, I think my friends used to play Rollercoaster Tycoon a lot.) Mario games (Most of them should be fine, there are some violence in it but it really isnt that bad. I used to love Super Mario N64 but I suppose that is a bit too old.) Minecraft (Havent actually played this game that much but I know that my younger cousins absolutely LOVE Minecraft and it is mainly focused on building and creative thinking.) The Sims (I used to love The Sims as a young child, maybe your children will too.) Sonic The Hedgehog (Dont know how this game is doing nowadays, I used to love it for sega megadrive though.)"
patientgamers,3af941,sleet01,6,Fri Jun 19 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"Scribblenauts Unlimited is probably a good way to ""trick"" them into learning stuff while playing. Others have already suggest KSP, which seems great, although I confess I haven't played it although I've heard only good things about it.   RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe is one of my favourites but I'm not sure whether your kids will mind the old graphics or not.  World of Goo, Portal, Portal 2, Closure and Braid are excellent puzzle games. FEZ too. You can also look at some Popcap games like Peggle, Bejeweled 3 etc. which I think are quite kiddie-friendly.  Platformers such as Bit.Trip 2, Super Meat Boy, OlliOlli are good recommendations if your kids don't give up easily.  Other fun (non-violent) games that I can think of that kids may like are Joe Danger (1 and 2).  Kart racers like Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed and Mario Kart Wii are also great picks if they enjoy playing with each other or with friends."
patientgamers,3af941,sleet01,3,Fri Jun 19 19:48:09 2015 UTC,"I second the Portal games and Braid. You don't do any actual fighting in Portal, but there are a few things that can shoot at you. It also has a co-op multiplayer mode which is a lot of fun. Braid is a Mario-like platformer with a unique time manipulation feature. Both focus largely on using your abilities and environment to pass various obstacles and puzzles.  For Wii, I highly recommend Rhythm Heaven Fever, one of my favorite games. It's a rhythm game (obviously) with lots of quirky characters, silly minigames, and catchy music. If you have a DS or 3DS, there's a Rhythm Heaven on there as well, and it's pretty good (Elite Beat Agents is another good DS rhythm game).   Speaking of DS/3DS games, the Pokemon games are very child-friendly, but I don't know if you're looking for something even more relaxed than that."

Little Big Planet is a bit too hard for a 5 year old to solve, but your older one might love it.  On the Wii, they play a lot of NSMB as well. It's the game the older one started out with actually.

There are good words that go with those you don't usually see applied to flash games (any games, really).  I guess it all depends on what sort of games they engage with, or you can induce engagement with.  They might like 3D logic on the same site, be aware that towards the end that'll challenge adults.  Big upvotes for KSP and World of Goo, those also get demanding.  KSP's a sandbox so you can go as far as you want and there'll be stuff there to tinker with. Anybody's got an engineering bent, I'd think this will find it.  Real-world reasoning pretty much always works right.  Also a big one for Banished, that has this really lovely atmosphere and pace. It takes time, but if they do engage it'll maybe stretch them some."

FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.  It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it. NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.

patientgamers,3af0qo,Red-Blue-,17,Fri Jun 19 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"While I enjoyed Broken Age, Grim Fandango is the way to go. The remastered version looks really nice while feeling nearly the same as the original and the story and writing are fantastic.  Broken Age is more of a pleasant diversion from the lack of really good modern point and clicks, but it just doesn't feel the same as the classics.  Also, if you ever get a chance, the first three Monkey Island games are brilliant and still hold up today. There are special editions of the first two with new art and voice acting that are totally worth checking out."
patientgamers,3af0qo,randolphhiggins,7,Fri Jun 19 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know Broken Age, but I know Grim Fandango, and it holds up. I play it every year or two. I genuinely envy you that you get to play it for the first time."

patientgamers,3af0qo,thatwill,3,Fri Jun 19 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"I think the disclaimer about Grim Fandango's difficulty is a good idea. It's a brilliant, hilarious game, but it is also one of the more challenging classic adventure games you will find. Though there are no deaths iirc, some of the puzzles are pretty obtuse, and there is also no hinting system. So if you are the kind of person who doesn't feel terrible about consulting a guide from time to time, it can be a really fun game."

patientgamers,3af0qo,Fishtails,3,Fri Jun 19 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get either for $9 if you're not sure you'd be a fan of the genre.  Check out a cheaper alternative, like The Book of Unwritten Tales, or I'd also recommend either the Wadjet Eye bundle or the Daedalic bundle on GOG.  If you haven't played The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, those are also great games, though they are more of an interactive story than a traditional point and click."

patientgamers,3af0qo,CuriousBlueAbra,6,Sat Jun 20 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"Tim Schafer (who made both games) is very creative and has a lot of ideas, but needs someone else around him to filter out the stupid ones. Rather like George Lucas. So the result is Broken Age, made when Schafer had absolute creative control, is a total mess - like the Star wars prequels.  BA tries to tell two stories of about a boy and a girl growing into adults and how their worlds collide, despite barely having the budget to tell one story with one main character. The art style was monstrously expensive to do, meaning we get about 3-5 places to explore over the entire game. All of which you'll have seen by the end of part 1. The puzzles are either absurd or trivial, yet from the documentary Schafer still thinks he's great at making them. The story itself was crafted at the last minute, and badly shows it.   With Grim Fandago you can see a lot of the problems that would plague Broken Age - the tank controls for instance were a terrible idea. But the game is much more cohesive from what I've seen because Schafer's dumb ideas had to get past his coworkers and bosses, which tended to prevent them entering the game. Listening to Schafer talk bout Grim Fandago and what he wanted to do but was told ""No"" about is really eye-opening.  I haven't finished Grim Fandago yet, so I can't give it a full recommendation. But I can say do not buy Broken Age, unless you have a particular interest in seeing a train crash."

You are correct in all but scope. Tim needs to be aware of his overambitious creativity if he wants double fine to reach itâs potential, but he didnât ruin broken age. Itâs still very good."

patientgamers,3af0qo,RandomRedPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:56:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha! In that case let me stick in my two cents and say, one of my personal favs in the genre is Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and it's Linux compatible. (Disclaimer: I played it as a kid, so I've got some hardcore nostalgia goggle bias, but a lot of other people also recognize that it's awesome. I've also replayed it as an adult and it still holds up.)   Old school Lucasarts and Sierra games in general are considered some of the greatest examples of the genre, and I would imagine most of the are Linux compatible since they're ancient. But anyway, I'm sure Grim Fandango is also a really good choice (haven't played it myself yet, ooops), I just can't miss an opportunity to recommend Indiana Jones."
patientgamers,3af0qo,dickroach,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:03:33 2015 UTC,"I have never played this type of game before   In that case, you should probably look into the classic LucasArts' point-and-click games Monkey Island I and II, and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. Can't speak for the updated versions of MI on Steam, but the old ones can run in ScummVM. There are a few different Linux versions available. All you need is a version of the original game, and ScummVM will run it. I'm afraid I can't point you to where to buy the originals, though."

patientgamers,3agb8g,Monteitoro,2,Fri Jun 19 23:19:11 2015 UTC,Yea I used to love this series as well. I still consider 4 to be one of the greatest games of all time. 5 wals okay but it started to go downhill. I only played the demo for 6 but I hated it.
patientgamers,3agb8g,rarelypost,3,Sat Jun 20 03:45:02 2015 UTC,I recommend you at least pick up RE4 and play through it since it's a great game.  I would only recommend RE5 and RE6 if you have a co-op partner to play with as the games aren't that great if you're going to be playing solo with the AI partner.  I don't know enough about Revelations to say if it's good or not.

Neither games appeal to the RPG elements I'm looking for.  Dark/Demon Souls scares me, lol. I've heard nothing but ""the game is hard but rewarding"". I don't get much time to play games and I'd rather spend time enjoying it rather than wanting to break something. I know I need to try it though, I'm just not sure now is the time."
patientgamers,3agioy,hotstickywaffle,5,Sat Jun 20 00:23:16 2015 UTC,Absolutely check out the Saint's Row series if you're looking for fun over challenge.  Especially 3 and 4.  They're completely ridiculous and over the top.  It's like if GTA didn't take itself as seriously.
patientgamers,3agioy,rarelypost,3,Sat Jun 20 00:27:36 2015 UTC,"I would say the Souls games are meant for a more dedicated gamer, so if you don't have much time to play they might not be the games for you.    If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum, you should pick up Arkham City.  Some other suggestions would be Borderlands 2 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and if you want to get into actual RPGs there's the ""Tales of"" series and Star Ocean: The Last Hope.  Tales and Star Ocean both have real time combat, so you actually move around to attack when you battle, no turn based menus."

patientgamers,3acwza,Switche,13,Fri Jun 19 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"If we can be serious for a minute... nobody should play these games. They're the gaming equivalent of hard, addictive drugs. The only substance to them is thinking about or planning out efficient upgrade paths.  Not even efficient upgrade paths feel satisfying for more than 5 seconds at a time, and the timeframe between meaningful rewards stretches out as you play more, by design. You can literally lose days to a week to these games before you even feel okay walking away from it for an hour, let alone stopping playing them. You will stop when the game stops showing you what you want to wait for next, basically.  Go right ahead and try one if you want to waste a few days, but I'm not exaggerating when I say you will regret it. It's a weird, messed up phenomenon of perfect addictive traits in a game."

Well we finally decided to convert my best friend to tanking, I thought him all I knew. One day one of our healers decides that he wants to take up tanking(he was a druid) I told him that sure we could do that, I was a paladin, I could just heal. Well sadly I didn't have a good healing set, so I spent the gold to get one. The agreed upon rule for our guild was that you rolled for the class/spec you were playing in the raid when the item dropped, unless we, before the fight, made an exception. Go figure this night we didn't go over any of this and behold, the mace the druid wanted dropped. He had afk'd and rolled need on it, but I didn't see the need roll. I figured it was better than the crafted one I was using and also rolled need. I won the roll and equipped it, and afk'd for bio as well. I come back to myself and about 4 other people dead, and half of the raid disbanded. I scramble and try to figure out what happened, then it clicked what I did. I didn't do it to be a dick or anything, I was just trying to flesh out my heal set and the druid had been rolling on tank gear all night."

Stay up late etc. Same with League of Legends and hearthstone.   The sports addiction sort of naturally faded. I think it was more of the fact that I love playing career/franchise mode and NBA/MLB seasons being so long I never could play more than 1-2 seasons and that sort of ruined the feeling of progression I love. Madden has pretty much ruined a lot of the things I love about franchise. It's a lot of unnecessary junk in Madden 25 and I hate the drafting.  As for LoL and Hearthstone, I've pretty much stopped trying to play competitively. Last time was back in March and I played 50+ hours of HS in a 3 day weekend. My mind felt fried.

You spent hours just looting a city for food because you were afraid someone was around. It took days to gear up your characters because materials were so scarce. Sometimes it took a day to find enough parts for a car. You were always on the brink of death by zombie, player, falling, bleeding. It was the most stressful game I've ever played and I still have dreams about it."

Like the biggest one on Nexus is a collection and it made every battle super complicated and filled with trees that made it hard to gallop, which totally takes away from my main strategy of riding and shooting with occasional ride-bys. The new complications from the mod (I think it was called Floris) made it way too weird and I had to uninstall to get the sometimes shallow but always pure fun of the game."

Floris and SilverStag are two mods that really increase the quality of life without making substantial changes to the game.  Ones that make substantial changes that I've enjoyed are Prophecy of Pendor (harder), A Clash of Kings (ASoIaF based with some spoilers), and The Last Days (Middle Earth based, probably the most different mod out of them all because it doesn't involve taking towns, just destroying enemy places).  The big thing is that mods can't really change the core of the game, so combat and sieging are the same in all of them pretty much."

It simply and easily imported my Steam games, and has a really great visual, while I can make my verdicts in a very satisfying way, setting difficulty, rating, etc (like GameFaqs.com).  Backloogery just didn't feel like a database to me, since I had to manually type the name of the games...  Is there a ""friend related"" feature on GameDeed? I haven't spent so many time on the website yet, but I guess this is what the website misses (or I'm stupid and didn't see it).

I update games that I'm done with with finished, and it lets me filter out games that are in my backlog. No need to have a separate account on another website. Very simple.  I really like having this master list. It makes it really easy to go over sales when I have a master list to reference to for everything. Also it's made me a more disciplined buyer. If I see a game during steam sale or wherever, I always stick to the master list and don't buy the game unless it's on my wishlist.

patientgamers,3aa5l7,thevulturesbecame,4,Thu Jun 18 19:26:29 2015 UTC,I think you misunderstood me. I'm saying not to buy as you afford each part because if it takes you a while to get all the parts you won't be able to figure out if a part is DOA until you get all the parts together. If that takes too long you won't be able to return it. This is why you should buy each part at once.

I was like ""what the fuck why does this guy have 30 upvotes, am I still on Reddit?"" I totally agree with you. Should buy all your parts at once or in no longer than a months time span to be within return time limits, and because parts only get cheaper over time, so buying them slowly is hemorrhaging money.

Granted it was at low-medium settings, but it ran and I was able to put in a lot of hours and enjoy it just fine that way.   Found out I was running it at a slight lag though. It was really minor and I only realized this when I started playing it on a more decent PC. The difference was very subtle. Apparently I put up with a lot though, as long as I like the game."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,factoryofsadness,4,Thu Jun 18 16:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I spent about 500 and built a computer, with new everything and it can run pretty much everything at ultimate setting. It's very satisfying after a decade of being in your situation (and buying games I couldn't play, before there was a rebate option).  The new games are super beautiful, but I learned they aren't necessarily funnier than all the old stuff I had been playing.  I'm starting to clear out my backlog, and not buying many new games, but I can't wait to buy Fallout 4 in 3 years :)"
patientgamers,3aa5l7,Betzxnator,4,Fri Jun 19 09:56:19 2015 UTC,"Ironically, I have the reverse of this problem. I spent a lot of money on a really good gaming rig, and I end up usually playing old games on an emulator, when I could be playing Skyrim on Ultra.   What can I say, I love me some Megaman."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,obi1kenobi1,3,Thu Jun 18 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"Get Shovel Knight! Its a daily deal on Steam today, and it's highly influenced by NES classics like Mega Man and DuckTales."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,BeFlatXIII,3,Thu Jun 18 18:04:50 2015 UTC,Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy ahead of you. That happens to be one of my favorite releases in the past couple of years!
patientgamers,3aa5l7,obi1kenobi1,3,Thu Jun 18 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"I would do this with the Humble Bundle and last year's Steam sale to a certain extent. I could play almost all of the games I bought on my 2008 MacBook Pro, but only at 1280x800 with most settings on low. Then a few months ago I got a real screamer, an 8-core Mac Pro... again from 2008, but pretty respectable amount of power. It turns out the graphics card was even worse than the one in my old MacBook Pro, but I lucked out and found a Radeon HD 6770 for $12 at a thrift store and could finally play all my Humble Bundle/Steam games in glorious 1600p at 30+fps. Now the power supply has been acting up, but I've gone ahead and bought a few games in the Steam sale that I know my MBP can't handle because I'm hoping to get the Mac Pro running again soon.  My current dilemma is Windows games that I'm unable to play. From what I've read my Mac Pro should make a pretty decent Windows gaming rig, so I think I'll probably get a copy of Windows 7 in the next few months, but in the mean time do I buy the games I want in the Steam sale with no way to play them or wait until I do have the ability to play them and pay full price?"
patientgamers,3aa5l7,rand486,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:42:50 2015 UTC,How is your old Mac Pro and where did you buy it?
patientgamers,3aa5l7,rand486,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"Like I said it's a 2008 model, and I bought it from another member of a Mac user group. Specs-wise it's about the same as a current mid-range Mac Mini or 21.5"" iMac (but much, much more upgradeable), and with the Radeon 6770 it can handle games like The Stanley Parable and Dear Esther at 2560x1600 with everything on full at a decent framerate (I don't know what that is exactly, but it looks like it's at least 40-50 most of the time)."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,Spamsational,21,Sat Jun 20 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"This is actually why I moved from PC gaming to console gaming.  I can recline on the couch, turn the game on, and it works. No configuration, no updating drivers, no futzing with my hardware anymore.  I don't really care about how gorgeous the graphics are (I'm almost 5 years behind in gaming anyway), so a console is a good, comfortable way to just play.  I have PS+ as well, so I just keep getting 4-5 new games every month, and it stops me from buying games just because they're on sale. I spend significantly less money now."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,__LordNibbler__,4,Sat Jun 20 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"My problem with the Xbox 360 I've got is its hooked up to the only TV in our house. So, playing games on that takes away TV for the rest of the family. So laptop computing is less intrusive."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,hidora,3,Thu Jun 18 14:14:56 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I got a Vita for a similar reason (and as a distraction while commuting). One PS+ subscription takes care of the games for both devices :)

patientgamers,3aa5l7,ginger_beer_m,6,Thu Jun 18 20:32:49 2015 UTC,Configuration isn't really necessary for the most part since they typically give you low-ultra options in the settings. Updating drivers is also pretty much automatic at this point.
patientgamers,3aa5l7,arcarsination,7,Fri Jun 19 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you have to go past that, though. Skyrim's basic configurations are terrible, but by tweaking the .ini a bit I can run it on medium/high with better fps than I would on low without editting the .ini."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,latesleeper89,2,Thu Jun 18 16:11:11 2015 UTC,"I made this move a few months back and couldn't be happier. Steam was becoming less fun, more of an addiction and a headache than anything... Especially with my aging computer. I would buy games just because they were cheap, and have a backlog that grew twice as fast as I could ever hope to play. None of the games would ever work consistently either...   Just said eff it, bought a ps4 and PS+, and have loved playing bloodborne to death.  There's something truly liberating about firing up a console and concentrating on ONE game at a time."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,arcarsination,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. For some people, clearing their backlog becomes a chore. They've forgotten that the main reason we play games is to have fun, and if you're not having fun, might as well drop it."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,latesleeper89,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah my main problem is I'm so cheap sometimes that I will forego rationality to save a few bucks. I mean I paid quite a bit to get the ps4, bloodborne and PS+, but it was totally worth it. Good games cost money."

patientgamers,3aa5l7,latesleeper89,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:03:58 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah, I guess this sub might not be for me...   I've come to realize that graphics and performance are really important to my gaming experience.  I like being on the edge - not necessarily the cutting edge (that's why I consider myself at least somewhat patient).  I never buy games at full price, but I really dislike the idea of not owning the game's physical copy.  I like to know that I can resell it if I don't like it and I'm prepared to pay more upfront for that ability.  That and the game has a tangible value in my library, not like steam where it's just another name added to a list.    I think my steam library is probably 30% played, 70% unplayed - and I find that rather sad."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,blaaaaaacksheep,0,Fri Jun 19 17:25:01 2015 UTC,Being at the cutting edge is not a console. Owning physical copies will go away for consoles too.  My percentage of my steam library played is probably like 10% but I don't really feel sad about it. It makes me happy I have years worth of games ahead of me. The number of games I've bought in recent months have gone to nearly zero. PC gaming is much cheaper than console gaming in my opinion.
patientgamers,3aa5l7,rtechie1,2,Fri Jun 19 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"Meh, the PS4 is cutting edge enough for me and probably for most people. My jaw dropped at the graphics of bloodborne. I like to play one game at a time and really hate the idea of a backlog - but all the power to you if you dig it.  People have been saying physical is dying for a long time, but I prefer it.  It will probably be significantly reduced in use, but won't go away completely until the consoles do away with it.  At that point I'll re-evaluate."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,rtechie1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:24:31 2015 UTC,"I don't consider the consoles cutting edge but they certainly are sufficient. I'll still buy a console for the exclusives. Once the next God of War comes out I'll be getting a PS4.  I definitely prefer physical, but I'm indifferent enough that the sales for PC have enticed me to stop caring about having the physical copies. What GOG offers is better than what you get from some physical copies nowadays."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,rand486,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:53:04 2015 UTC,Steam link is coming out in a few months. That'll allow you to play PC games on your couch with minimal hardware.
patientgamers,3aa5l7,rtechie1,2,Fri Jun 19 19:21:13 2015 UTC,"Only if you have a high-end gaming PC to stream the games from.   And you shouldn't buy the Steam link anyway. If you really want to stream games you probably already have a high-end Nvidia video card, which means you can use Nvidia's superior Shield. Buy a Shield tablet, handheld, or microconsole instead.   Shield is superior because Nvidia uses proprietary hardware to accelerate the streaming (that's why it only works with Shield clients).   You also need a high-end ($200+) 802.11ac router if you want to do wireless streaming."

Plus, since they're digital games, I don't have to worry about limited quantity and people jacking up the prices on Ebay.

patientgamers,3aa5l7,Prah2013,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:18:18 2015 UTC,"I used to do this, but then I bought a gaming rig, and... still never played most of those games I bought. I Have a big problem when it comes to steam deals. I buy a ton of games even though my backlog is like a 100 games long..."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,mynewaccount5,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:12:32 2015 UTC,"You aren't the only one. But my rig is at least powerful enough to play all the games you listed, whether I play them is another matter. (I won't be able to play games released more recently, like the Witcher 3 and since I only bought my Laptop last year, it will be another 3-4 years before I get another)  I feel like I'm hoarding games right now, for both the PC and  PS3 and will probably play most of them through the next 3-4 years as the number of games for the PS3 and my current laptop capable games become more and more scarce. Eventually I will have to purchase a PS4 and a faster PC but will probably do both towards the last couple of years of the PS4's life(Guessing 2018-2019)"
patientgamers,3aa5l7,KatsumeBlisk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:42:30 2015 UTC,Did the same for a time. My steam account is full with cool games but my laptop is probably too dated to play them. Have enough 360 games anyway and that is what is keeping me busy.
patientgamers,3aa5l7,itsableeder,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:02:13 2015 UTC,I used to do this too. I don't think it's that big a problem unless you need the money for something else. :)
patientgamers,3aa5l7,mynewaccount5,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:47:18 2015 UTC,"Here are some the games I have never played on steam : https://i.imgur.com/KOLD44d.png and you know what that's fine, there's no need to stress over that, it's not actually a big deal, no one really cares if you finish your games or not."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,itsableeder,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:05:01 2015 UTC,"I'm running an aging but decent rig for gaming (1440p, i7-860, GTX660, 32GB), but I run Linux.  Lots of games nowadays run on Linux, so while in theory I can dual boot it to XP, I haven't tried it in years and I'm not even sure that still works.  In spite of that I have a habit of grabbing interesting-looking Windows-only titles like Stanley Parable when they're on sale.  Some day I'll actually install Win 7 and play them."
patientgamers,3aa5l7,cptnhook,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:10:53 2015 UTC,There are video how to guides on youtube that can teach you how to build a decent gaming rig for under $400.00. Give it a shot!
patientgamers,3ab2av,lakinwecker,17,Thu Jun 18 17:30:36 2015 UTC,"steam sales have been very lackluster for me. i have most older titles i wanted from previous sales that had discounts as deep as these, and the titles i've added to my wishlist don't go on very deep discounts even on daily/flash deals.  i kinda wonder if this is a side-effect of the refund policy."
patientgamers,3ab2av,Merosi,4,Thu Jun 18 18:29:37 2015 UTC,I bet they had those really good sales in the early years of Steam to build up the user base.
patientgamers,3ab2av,blaaaaaacksheep,3,Fri Jun 19 01:33:14 2015 UTC,There was also no competition back then.  Now there's dozens of online stores competing with each other and they provide the same discounts you'd see in a Steam sale every day of the week.
patientgamers,3ab2av,rarelypost,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"It's not just that, we also have had some pretty lackluster years in PC gaming recently and it takes time for gaming companies to want to discount.  A longer time if they are in a sellers market - i.e. they had a decent title out in 2013 or 2014."
patientgamers,3ab2av,hypnoconomy,10,Fri Jun 19 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"FYI- Indiegala has Dying Light for 50% off right now, way better than what Steam is offering.  https://www.indiegala.com/store/product/239140"
patientgamers,3ab2av,HongManChoi,4,Thu Jun 18 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"Fucking hell, that game looks so good. Must... be... patient for a <$15 sale."
patientgamers,3ab2av,MassiveBallacks,3,Thu Jun 18 17:49:02 2015 UTC,Looks exactly like Dead Island to me.
patientgamers,3ab2av,MrWiggles2,2,Thu Jun 18 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it is from the creators of Dead Island."
patientgamers,3ab2av,MassiveBallacks,5,Thu Jun 18 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"That would explain it then.  I was a big early supporter of dead island, until it came out and I got it.  It was a huge let down for me in just about every aspect.  So when I saw Dying Light and it looked literally no different but the setting, I just wrote it off as another cash grab on the zombie survival genre."
patientgamers,3ab2av,MrWiggles2,7,Thu Jun 18 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"Dying Light is an excellent game, i would really recommend it. MUUUUUCH better than dead island."
patientgamers,3ab2av,mattymck,2,Thu Jun 18 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"Having seen gameplay, the game has a very good parkour system in place, and does actually have some legitimately scary/dangerous moments. Honestly I would probably buy it if I had a better computer. I'd definitely recommend looking up some gameplay footage before writing it off, or just watch Totalbiscuit's Salebox video on it."
patientgamers,3ab2av,Cerberus0225,2,Fri Jun 19 06:17:00 2015 UTC,"It's a lot like Dead Island, but a lot more polished and advanced than Dead Island. The parkour system alone makes the game feel radically different. And because fighting through the horde is no longer the only mechanic in the game, they were actually able to make the enemies more of a threat and more interesting. It's also way less buggy.  To be honest, I did enjoy hacking up zombies with friends in Dead Island, but Dying Light is leagues better."
patientgamers,3ab2av,PaintItPurple,-12,Fri Jun 19 01:26:13 2015 UTC,It's garbage. How does it look good? Im guessing your also a Diablo fan.
patientgamers,3ab2av,MassiveBallacks,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:59:27 2015 UTC,It was an enticing launch trailer. I've never played Diablo.
patientgamers,3ab2av,Darkhellxrx,7,Thu Jun 18 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Life is Strange. It's a story-driven game in which you play as a High School Senior, and she discovers that she has the power to reverse time. The game is really cool to play, has tons of dialogue choices, and holds your interest really well.  If you liked The Walking Dead series, you'll like this. Definitely worth the buy, though what's being sold is only the first Episode. So far, 3 of 5 are out, and the 4th comes out soon."
patientgamers,3ab2av,knaefraktur,4,Thu Jun 18 22:54:05 2015 UTC,Should be noted that only episode 1 is on 50% sale. Rest is 20%
patientgamers,3ab2av,Darkhellxrx,2,Thu Jun 18 22:58:10 2015 UTC,"That's in the second part of my comment :P  Regardless, still pretty worth it in my opinion, though people may want to wait a couple years for it to be a much lower price"
patientgamers,3ab2av,knaefraktur,2,Thu Jun 18 23:17:59 2015 UTC,I misunderstood your last part then.   I really want to try it. But I'll wait for the next sale or so.
patientgamers,3ab2av,Darkhellxrx,2,Thu Jun 18 23:20:35 2015 UTC,It happens. Its a fantastic game that you should totally play when you get the chance
patientgamers,3ab2av,vectaur,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"I played the demo of this at PAX, and as a fan of the Telltale games, it's a no-brainer.  I think it's a wait-until-all-episodes-are-out sort of thing though, and given my backlog, probably looking for the $5 range as well."
patientgamers,3ab2av,cbsa82,5,Fri Jun 19 16:02:53 2015 UTC,Hand of Fate is on sale for 50%  That thing is MINE NOW.
patientgamers,3ab2av,fragglerox,5,Thu Jun 18 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised most people bail on Reus after two tries (median 1.8 hrs). I have 50 hours into that game and it's a great puzzle ... thing. There's nothing else like it, really. If I would guess, the problem is that it gets really difficult when your villages start attacking each other, so you have to actively manage danger. And it's not at all obvious what's going on, you're sort of disconnected between action and response.  Anyway, chalk me up as a Reus fan, worth it at $2.50."
patientgamers,3ab2av,datazip,4,Thu Jun 18 19:40:35 2015 UTC,I got about 2/3 of the achievements. It just started to feel the same. I didn't love the time limit. I liked it. Glad I got it and would recommend it but probably say 15 hoursis plenty unless you really like it.
patientgamers,3ab2av,saruin,7,Thu Jun 18 19:45:08 2015 UTC,"Day 8 of the Steam Summer sale:  My Picks - FTL, FTL and FTL. There are other good games today, but if you don't own FTL yet, why?  FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.  It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it. NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.

patientgamers,3ab2av,Don_Quijoder,3,Thu Jun 18 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised Risen hasn't received much attention even from the more popular Steam deals threads.  I'm still on the first game at over 40 hours and looks incredible for such an older title (may be system taxing to achieve consistent 60fps, my 4690K sees a lot of usage with this game at 1440p).  For a challenging open world non-linear 3rd person RPG, I highly recommend this!"
patientgamers,3ab2av,saruin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"People seem to hate Risen for not being a proper Gothic game.  I'm not sure how much truth there is to that, but that's the reason."
patientgamers,3ab2av,DontAskMePlease,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:13:55 2015 UTC,Haven't played the Gothic series but I see that they're on sale as well but mainly criticized for being buggy unpatched (looking at the 3rd game).  Would you personally recommend the series?  The first looks a bit dated for my tastes.  I'm surprised I haven't ran into any bugs with Risen other than forcing Vsync to fix screen tearing and a game breaking bug involving climbing stuff.
patientgamers,3ab2av,deadfraggle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"Gothic II: Night of The Blood Raven  is a great experience but also ridiculously difficult at times.  Gothic III has a fan patch that pretty much improves everything.  In fact, I quite enjoyed it.   In short, if you're looking for a hard RPG that's also pretty rewarding, then yes, I'd definitely suggest it for $5"
patientgamers,3ab2av,Cerberus0225,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:22:21 2015 UTC,"Again, I haven't a clue of the Gothic series but one of the things that stood out for me in Risen is how unforgiving the game is (this is Normal difficulty setting).  There's something about an open world RPG and going places you're not supposed to go to (getting killed instantly!) that does it for me.  I think for less than $8 I really can't go wrong with the Arcania + Gothic series pack that's currently on sale.  I've heard the Gothic series isn't well optimized for lower/mid end setups but I'm hoping my rig is up to par for at least 60fps at 1440p or at the very least 1080p."
patientgamers,3ab2av,ikarios,3,Fri Jun 19 03:40:01 2015 UTC,"Am I getting older and mire  serious with my finances and opinions or is this sale pretty lackluster.  No good discounta for me in there. I bought a pretty new game for 25 % off, bozght thats no discount for me. I wanna see that 75 %.  Maybe it's just my taste. Edit: Sry for spelling. I hate typing on my phone..."

I just couldn't get used to the controls and, since at the time I didn't have a gamepad, ended up playing it on the 360 instead. Regarding the older ones, in terms of gameplay they play flawlessly. The only difference is that while on the xbox you could adjust the movement speed depending on the pressure on the analog stick, on the pc you do that with the mouse wheel (roll it forward to increase speed, backwards to decrease). The plus side is that you can save anywhere instead of having a chekcpoint system, which in the hardest levels is invaluable. In terms of performance on modern systems I can't comment on that since I always played on hardware from that time. According to PCGamingWiki only Pandora Tomorrow seems to have major issues on modern hardware."

With that said, you just need to look at the tons of other big releases that year (i.e. Skyrim, Portal 2, Space Marine to name a few) and see how much they've discounted since then.  I mean really, how much can we get Skyrim for nowdays, $5?    Even if we're being nice and giving KSP a couple years on on their real release date, like, 2013 maybe?  Not as many big games that year, but still most have cut retail price by half, and much further with sales.    The bottom line is, KSP was too expensive for an indie the entire time it was in early access for 4 years, was too expensive when it ""launched,"" and is still way, way too expensive for an old indie game.    The bad part is, is that I was very interested in KSP, but their prohibitive prices for a non-showstopper have caused me to hold off giving them some of my money until I don't care to give them any of my money."

Both were in existence for years prior under development, the only difference being KSP had an open development process.  Yet you didn't see people demanding steep sales of Skyrim in December of 2011.  And that's despite the fact that KSP is significantly cheaper on release than Skyrim was, AND has been having 25% off sales recently to bring it down to half the release price of Skyrim.  And while Skyrim was a fantastic game, KSP is certainly more innovative and unique, and therefore arguably a bigger ""showstopper"" because of those things.   The bad part is, is that I was very interested in KSP, but their prohibitive prices for a non-showstopper have caused me to hold off giving them some of my money until I don't care to give them any of my money.

Are you serious? There were ""new update"" sales constantly while KSP was in early access. I bought it for $18 and I saw it go on sale for as little as $12. Everybody knew the price was only going to go up as KSP gained features.  If you're too cheap to buy a $12 game then you're too cheap to be buying computer games. Period."

The 1.0 release marked Squad having achieved all the goals they set out to achieve in the first place, but as development went along, they picked up some new ones.  Honestly, if the 25% sale isn't big enough, I'd full out wait until Unity 5 integration and the bug fixes that will inevitably have to come after that.  But, as others have said, KSP was in early access for a long time, so it seems like it's been out for longer when it really hasn't. The stock aero model before 1.0 was a joke (it's still far from perfect, but I use a modded aero model anywaysâalways have), for example.

Even if a GOTY edition is available I almost always just buy the regular version because it's cheaper (even if only by a couple bucks), and I know that the chances that I'll love any game enough to want more content is so slim that it's not worth it for me.  This is especially true with huge open-world games."
patientgamers,3a7th0,JapanCode,3,Thu Jun 18 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"I played on freakin console (so no mods) and I dumped 200+ hours on this game, includimg DLC. Of course the majority was main game, but the DLC definitely added a lot of hours in there"
patientgamers,3a7th0,Terrorsaurus,2,Thu Jun 18 09:51:02 2015 UTC,"Same here. I just had vanilla Skyrim and some mods to make the experience better. I sunk 200 hours into that game, and STILL didn't get through everything I wanted to before I just got burned out and wanted to move on to something else. I'm sure I'll pick it up again in a year or two and chip away a little more. That game is so dense with content though that you could easily skip the DLC and still have too much game to handle."

patientgamers,3a7th0,gengis,2,Thu Jun 18 04:16:50 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this. I have never purchased dlc or season passes and never will. I just don't agree with it.   The only time I have got dlc is if goty edition is the same price as what the bar game is on sale. So the 5 to 8 mark.
patientgamers,3a7th0,amunak,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:17:31 2015 UTC,Did you not agree with expansion packs (which is what DLCs were before the downloadable part) too?
patientgamers,3a7th0,gengis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:38:47 2015 UTC,The last expansion pack I ever purchased was for battlefield 2.  I personally feel that was classed as an expansion pack and actually added expansion to the game.   What class as dlc today is price gouging. I don't agree with it so I never purchase it.   I know I'm the minority these days. Each to their own. I  don't like to support things I don't agree with. Others like it  they can buy it.   I'll wait for goty with everything in it at the same price
patientgamers,3a7th0,amunak,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:28:08 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is that there are DLCs and DLCs... Some are just shitty cashgrab, and others - like most (if not all) DLCs for Skyrim - are much more like expansion packs and are well worth it.  I'm not saying buy every DLC, but I fell like the attitude of hurr durr DLC bad doesn't help anything. I mean we should reward those that make decent DLCs that are worth it and not buy those that are bad.  Skyrim is extremly cheap for what it offers now, even with the DLCs. If you buy it without them you are missing on a lot of content, and if you ever decide to buy them later it will only be more expensive in the end."
patientgamers,3a7th0,gengis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"Then it comes to the way Bethesda prices the goty vs base game and sells dlc. There are threads and threads about how dlc doesn't go on sale, Bioware points and lack of sales etc etc  Which ever way I look at it, I see cash grab. You enjoy it so buy it. I don't feel like supporting it. So I have bought the base game for both mass effect 1,2,3 and I have morrowind, oblivion and skyrim . All 6 with no dlc what so ever and I will never buy it.   You feel like you miss out which is fine. I refuse to support what I see as cash grab.  Each to their own :)"
patientgamers,3a7th0,amunak,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is though that one, you can't know what or if you are missing out on when you don't try it, and two, the DLCs are not as discounted as the base game, sure, but they are hardly a cash grab when the base game with all DLCs costs less than half of the price of the full game as originally released. And it is a damn good game at that, probably worth buying even at full price (well it would be worth for me, even though I bought it when it first hit like 75% off).  Which is why I think it's unfair to call it a cash grab. It's so old now that Bethesda certainly doesn't even care about the income from that game.  But yeah, of course don't buy it of you think it's not worth it. I would still suggest though to perhaps give the DLCs a try, and see if you like them. If not you can refund them thanks to the new Steam policies."
patientgamers,3a7th0,gengis,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"You have a point but I'm a stubborn old man :)   Back in my day.....  The game came out, then expansions came it and extended the game.   The way season passes are announced with the game, exclusive pre orders by stores, steam bonuses etc just don't sit right.   I don't feel like I'm missing anything and I am voting with my wallet.   The only companies I would support these days with their dlc are cd project and things like gw2. Cd project because they have shown themselves to have ethics and guild wars because it was buy the base game and support us with cosmetic purchases in game if you like what we are doing.   Compare that to any other dlc and season pass business model and you can see the difference.   Like I said I know I'm the minority these days and that's fine. I've been gaming since Amstrads so I have seen lots of changes in the industry.   If I don't agree with it I don't buy it. There are so many games to choose from these days my life won't be affected by missing out on some of dlc, but I also sleep better knowing that my extra $5 went to guild wars or cd project rather than ea, valve or Bethesda with a business model I don't agree with :)"

Funnily the only two games I bought this sale were ones I already had vanilla copies of. Also bought dragon age ultimate edition.  Had Dragon age origins from origin giveaway.

It was like spawning in zelda with the master sword and 20 hearts.   For fallout 3, I still don't own all the dlc. The side trip to the island was so damn boring and the guns useless. The spaceship one was ok but a bit repetitive. I never bothered with the pitt or other dlc.  I guess I am not the norm, but I only play the original experience and dlc just seems unnecessary or distracting. I don't bother with side quests either. I guess it's a personal thing. I have 300+ games and if I spend 1000 hours in each one I'll never get to play most of them.  Some people live in games, I just vacation in them.

Inventory management is a constant and arduous task, even with high strength.  Plus. having an increased inventory not only saves you tons of time and hassle of sorting and discarding anything but primary gear, but also time running back to inventory locations (your house).  Having different gear sets can change and vary the way you approach the game and plus you can look super neat-o with different gear configurations :)  check out the mods on nexus.  They can do anything from turn you into a giant teddy bear to adding spells to the game.  There are practical ones like those that change your HUD and interface."

Usually I can get a great deal on one, although you have to be a little careful because they'll sometimes be a couple components you'll have to replace. Usually I end up swapping out the power supply or getting external storage, but sometimes I'll get a new graphics card separately from the tower. The other thing I do is price out anything I'm looking at by matching components at Pricewatch.

Wait until the console has 4-5 games that you MUST have.   If these two requirements are met, then go for it.  Since you mentioned the lack of time, I feel your pain.  I'm a married father myself and the time seems to get less and less.  To me, it's one of those ""you gotta sacrifice some sleep for your hobby"" things.

patientgamers,3aa6hw,graciliano,10,Sat Jun 20 01:40:02 2015 UTC,"I probably won't be buying consoles anymore.  When SNES came out, computer games were in a pretty rough spot, comparatively. There was no real graphical difference between what was available, and game pads did just fine. Hell, SNES even had the Super Scope, and modding a computer just for that would've been a silly and pointless endeavor.  PS1/N64/Genesis was the golden era of console gaming. Games were made for consoles, and computers were work platforms. Yeah, you'd have an anomaly like Half Life every now and then, but by and large, I (and probably many others) were happy with Goldeneye, Banjo-Kazooie, the original Rogue Squadron, and their ilk. (Oh Rareware...how the mighty have fallen)  Somewhere in the PS2/Xbox era, though, I feel like computers and consoles started to see a rift. A lot more cross-platforming seemed to take place. Still, someone in another thread pointed out that consoles were just easier to deal with. You didn't have to check hardware specs, you didn't have to constantly fret about upgrading video cards or drivers; you pressed a button, sat down on the couch, and about 30 seconds later, the game you purchased was ready to go. No worry, no hassle.  Skipping ahead a bitâthe turning point for me personally was Battlefield 3. I'm not even a huge shooter junkie, but when I learned that not only was there a graphical difference, but a significant gameplay difference in terms of players available in matches together, I sat there looking at my 360 thinking, ""I'm getting screwed for playing the same game on an inferior platform."" With BF3, it was particularly discernible because you had these huge maps that were ghost towns on the Xbox (12v12 max on maps that were designed for 32v32, IIRC).  Now, even though I haven't upgraded to a full-on gaming rig yet, I've come to understand that computers are noticeably better than consoles, and the only way consoles can even feasibly keep up is by compromising somewhere along the way. Maybe it's graphics, maybe it's gameplay, but somewhere, they have to cut corners for everyone, whereas with computers, it seems easier to look at it and say, ""Oh, this is where my rig's falling short."" Maybe I've just gotten older/more competent with technology, or maybe games themselves have changed. But at this point, I don't think there is a single console-exclusive title that could get me to buy a console. There hasn't been one since the original Halo (which was the reason I wanted an Xbox), and with the current state of the console war, I just can't see me shelling out money for what increasingly appears to be a shorter-term transient experience. Consider Titanfall, or Destiny (or, more recently, Evolve). Yeah, people rode those hype trains all the way to the station, but when the games were out and in hands, they got old in, what, a month? Two months? Not worth it. Not anymore."
patientgamers,3aa6hw,kmacku,5,Thu Jun 18 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"I still think consoles have a huge edge in ease of use. Not only in that you buy a game with ps4 on the box and you know it'll work on your machine, but in the buying stage too. I have a PC, but I had to have a 3-4 hr conversation with a friend walking me through all the bits to get to where I have a rough idea of what it can do and what bits I was getting. PS4 was literally ""see TLOU bundle in shop, hand over card, play""  That said, if you're willing to dedicate a bunch of time (assuming you start from zero hardware knowledge) or a few hundred more currency-of-your-choices, then yeah, your PC will outdo the console performance wise."
patientgamers,3aa6hw,Boris_Ignatievich,4,Thu Jun 18 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, consoles are still easier, but there's a term for weighing the value of ease versus the value of exclusivity (I don't know what that term is off the top of my head). It's like people who like driving manual transmissions for the control factor, when automatic is, objectively, easier.  With console vs. PC, again, it could just be that I've gotten older and now understand the tech a little better, whereas teens might still look at custom PCs like, ""WAT DO?"" The difference is that, back in the N64/Genesis/PS1 era, the games then were as good on console, if not better in some cases because there wasn't a market for high-end gaming rigs at the time, so the value of ease was much higher. For me, the flip happened quite dramatically with BF3 when I realized that console gamers were getting flat out screwed playing what was supposed to be the same game.  Admittedly, BF3 came at the end of a console generation where the gap should be the largest, but even the current generation seems to only have started out on medium PC benchmarks, and if it's going to be an actual generation, that gap is only going to widen over the next 3-4 years. It doesn't look good for consoles when people are pointing out very aptly how the PC versions of the same game are simply better for one reason or another within the first year of that console's release."
patientgamers,3aa6hw,kmacku,2,Thu Jun 18 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree PC is a good place to be, hence my buying one! But I think for the vast majority of people playing games, they just don't care that PC is better* - they just want to play games and the easiest way to do that, with the lowest up front cost, for the foreseeable future is console. Thats especially going to be true for kids and teenagers who aren't funding it themselves, you won't find many parents (esp non gamers) who buy the argument ""if you spend an extra 300 on this years christmas present for me, then you'll maybe save money long term depending on which games you buy for me and when""!  *obv the majority of online gaming places have the minority that do care - us two both included :D"

patientgamers,3aa6hw,tom261,3,Thu Jun 18 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"This is extremely spot on in how I feel about console gaming.  I totally agree that things really changed around the PS2/XBOX era, but it really started to show when X360/PS3 came around; it just seemed like the quality and value just started going downhill from there.    Back in 2013 when the latest gen consoles were being announced, I felt absolutely no joy in any of the  announcements, no excitement whatsoever.  I wondered why these new consoles were so low powered, arguing about ""being online 24/7"" and ""no used games!""  It just blew my mind how disappointing it was.  All of this directed me back to PC gaming and I haven't looked back.    As a primarily PC gamer, I don't believe the argument that ""consoles are just easier"" anymore.  Steam has made great strides with Big Picture Mode, and now, Steam Machines, Steam Controller and Steam Link.  I honestly believe that PC gaming is just as easy as console gaming . . . but here is the cool part:  PC gaming just has the greater benefits.  Full backward compatibility, choice of any controller you can think of, hardware upgrades (note:  you DON'T have to upgrade hardware if you don't want!), cheaper games, mods, and the list goes on.  On the other hand, people are just so ingrained in XBOX Live/PSN mainly because ""all my friends are there and not on Steam/Origin/whatever"".  I totally get that.  I have friends that are console only gamers and would love to play games with them online, but I refuse to pay for XBOX Live/PSN and a console that I'll only play when playing with friends (I play a lot of offline, SP games).  Just doesn't make sense for me.  If you really look at the big picture, consoles are becoming PCs and PCs are becoming consoles . . . in a way.  The entry level playing ground is starting to level out but PC still comes out on top with features that consoles can't do.  Sorry for making this about PC vs. console, just throwing my opinion out there."
patientgamers,3aa6hw,TeamTuck,2,Thu Jun 18 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was looking back over my comments, earlier, and it hit me that Steam is really brought computer gaming out of a niche market into the forefront of the console wars. People can say what they will about Steam support, God Gaben, and what not, but when it came to challenging that ""value of ease"" that had been the cornerstone of console gaming up to that point, Steam was paramount. Adding Workshop support was another huge leap, as now people are realizing that games are being released as incomplete packages, either to be patched later, or because they're canvases for user-generated content (see: Cities Skylines).  I do still believe console gaming is that little bit easier, because if you own a console, you'll never ask the question of, ""Will my hardware run this game? If so, at what setting?"" But to me, the value of that ease is rendered worthless when held up to the advantages of PC gaming."

If so, at what setting?"" But to me, the value of that ease is rendered worthless when held up to the advantages of PC gaming.   I can see this side of the debate, which is where Steam Machines are going to shine.  As consoles age, developers are going to try to push the hardware to its limits, but at the cost of ""downgrading"" the quality of the graphics/game content/etc.  It's the same with computers in a sense.  Yes, you do can manually mess around with the settings if you so choose.  The best thing about this situation is that you have the choice to do it!  Want better graphics as the cost of a lower framerate?  Go for it?  Want to step the graphics down a bit for a higher framerate?  You can do that.  Console games are mostly one way and one way only with no option to change things.  I think that purchasing a gaming PC is going to get easier and become more ""console like"".  You purchase a machine, keep it for 3-5 years and buy another one when you want, just like a console."
patientgamers,3aa6hw,TeamTuck,8,Thu Jun 18 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"I'm using a computer, but I've also had experience with consoles in the past.   Just get one when you feel like the last gen consoles cannot satisfy you anymore, or when you feel like you really want to play some of the games that are only available there. No reason to switch if you haven't finished most of the great games from the 7th gen yet. The only reason I would get one would be for The Witcher 3 and maybe Bloodborne."

I don't know your situation; how old your kid(s) are, if you have a place for privacy, a wife that accepts your gaming/understand the need for me-time, etc.  But it's entirely possible that you will lose interest in what I call ""real"" games in the near future.    Not only is playing for such short amounts of time unfulfilling, but you'll tend to lose track of what you were doing last time, and even how to play the game.  I've started and enjoyed so many games that I simply never finished because the next I booted them up I had no idea what to do.  Red Dead Redemption was the last that happened with.  I was on a mountain somewhere, with no idea of where to go, or even how to look into a quest list (or whatever they had) that might tell me.   My 360 finally broke on xmas eve 2013 (yay... ) and I still haven't bought a new console.  I think about it on occasion... but I know that I wont get to enjoy it.  It would be a purchase for my kids.  But, they're the iPad generation.  So I'm not sure they'll get much time on it either.    What I've taken to is ""shitty"" games.  Phone games, facebook/kongregate games, etc.  Usually the free p2w ones.  I can play them whenever and can stop playing at a moment's notice.  They're cheap (free if you want) and you never find yourself invested in something that you aren't really enjoying.  It's no problem simply finding a new shitty game.  They're free, after all.    I do still tend to spend some money on steam sales, with the intention of one day actually getting to play them (and sometimes I do).  The only downside is that I've played so many games that nothing feels original anymore.  Everything is simply a slight variation of something else that I've played.  ..."
patientgamers,3aa6hw,Gr1pp717,2,Thu Jun 18 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"I probably won't. Most games these days are either cross platform or exclusive to one console + pc. It's just impossible to justify the cost for one or two games, especially when I could spend the same amount on a new pc and have access to more games, better sales, no monthly fees, and the actual utility of it being a real computer. I don't think that will change until the price of the console hits about 50, that way I could pick up the console and a few exclusive games for $100, making the investment per game come to $50 or less."

Persona 5 (depending on the differences between PS3 and PS4 versions) and inFamous: Second Son would be two of the few exceptions to my patent rule, but the PS4 itself is still too expensive for me right now. Not sure what price point I'm looking for. Wii U doesn't have much I'm interested in yet, and I'm usually not into Microsoft's exclusives, so those two aren't even on my radar yet. In any case, I'm still having a really good time working my way through my PS3 library, so I'm in no rush to upgrade.  I am, however, having a very difficult time talking myself out of buying a Vita over the past couple of months because of Persona 4 Golden and lots of other JRPGs, so I may end up buying one soon.

Most likely to an Xbox One and most likely in about a year assuming I am still in a situation where I am free to enjoy my hobby of gaming.    There aren't so many One/PS4-gen exclusives of interest just yet but by then there will be and I will have drastically cut the numbers of essential to-play games on my backlog down.  By then I hopefully will have a better TV to enjoy the games on and there will be a lot more of interest.  All that is released and of interest to me thus far (which aren't on 360) are Forza Horizon 2, Sunset Overdrive, Master Chief Collection, Defence Grid 2, Flockers, Oddworld and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. There are a few more I could get on 360 and play without upgrading but might wait until I upgrade to get/play (Wolfenstein:The New Order, Far Cry 4, Saints Row 4, GTA V, Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2).  By then there will also be Star Wars Battlefront, Tony Hawks 5, Trackmania Turbo, The Rare Collection(!!!!) and more.  Roughly 2 years worth of xbox One 'Games with Gold' will have been acquired by then, sitting just waiting to be downloaded as well to sweeten the deal and push me towards that purchase.  I'll not be in a rush to get any specific titles, Rare Collection aside, so while I hope to get the titles listed above order wouldn't matter and I'd be able to pick them up cheaper.  Being able to play any of my digital games from the 360 will make the transition even easier and means that any 360 backlog that remains can be played on either console.  PS: I also expect to pick up a Wii-U at some point when finances allow because Nintendo are awesome.  I don't even see this one as an upgrade, just an essential extra!"

SteamOS already has a bunch of stuff I'm going nuts over, so that's the direction I'll be going in the next two years. A little before the PS5 comes out, I'll look at the PS4 again and see if it has anything compelling. So, depending on what counts as a console, I'll be getting a next-gen console in two-ish years. If Sony steps up their game, I'll get a PS4 in about four years (I don't see these under-powered consoles lasting much longer than that) and if not, I'll just emulate it on my Steam Machine."

patientgamers,3a9svw,thedude2618,9,Thu Jun 18 10:48:20 2015 UTC,"How about Warcraft 3? It has a long single player campaign and tonnes of user made content.   C&C Generals is also a favorite of mine, but it's a completely different setting.  If I remember correctly, Age of Mythology was similar to AoE."
patientgamers,3a9svw,Toasterlad,3,Thu Jun 18 11:48:44 2015 UTC,"Age of Empires III + The Expansions would fit your tastes. It's not as big as AOE II if you want to go for Player vs A.I. Matches, but it has one of the greatest single-player campaigns if have every played. It's also quite varied, and introduces a rather interesting ""hometown delivery"" mechanic. I had a blast with it. The story and the atmosphere are also spot-on.   Age of Mythology + The Titans expansion is also a great choice. It's very similar to AOE II as it was made by the same studio IIRC, but it's focused on smaller scale battles and story progression. The soundtrack is phenomenal, probably my favourite game ST of all time.   AOE III takes place during the colonization of America period and a bit onwards, while AOM has a more mythological aspect to it, taking you to places like ancient Greece, Egypt and Scandinavia (+Atlantis if you play the expansion), all of them with their unique gods, units, architecture, etc.   I might be the minority here, but I recommend the vanilla Age of Mythology over the Extended Edition if you don't want to play multiplayer.   Good luck with your decision!"
patientgamers,3a9svw,lacsativ,4,Thu Jun 18 11:50:41 2015 UTC,There are a bunch of them on sale now on Steam. Just tag the search option 'strategy' and look for anything with high reviews that's on discount.
patientgamers,3a9svw,Myrandall,3,Thu Jun 18 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"If you loved WC2, then WC3 is the obvious choice, as it's just a logical progression.  Starcraft 1 and 2 are very similar as well.  If you loved AoE 1 and 2, then 3 is the obvious choice, and Age of Mythology is another good choice, as is Rise of Nations.  If you love RTSs in general, there's so many choices, but some of the best IMHO are --  Total Annihilation, Red Alert 3, C&C 3, Homeworld, Myth: Fallen Lords, Rise of Nations, Sins of a Solar Empire, Supreme Commander, Ground Control, C&C Generals, Dragonshard, Star Trek Armada, Star Wars Empire at War. Creeper World.  None of them are ""crazy into detail"" that I can think of, though I'm not sure exactly what that means.  I might also suggest 4X games like Galactic Civilizations II, but that probably is crazy into detail.  Tower Defense is also a very similar genre.  Standouts there are :  Plants vs. Zombies, Kingdom Rush, Defense Grid.  They also tend to be less detail oriented, which may be what you're after."

Base building and management is done through turns, but battles are fought in real time. So you can take your time managing your bases and resources but still have your battles done in real time.  If you like the time period of AoE I there is Rome Total War 1 & 2  If you like the time period of AoE II there is Medieval Total War 1 & 2  If you enjoy the fantasy setting of Warcraft. There are a mods for the Total War series you might be interested in. LOTR: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-lord-of-the-rings-total-war  Warhammer: http://www.moddb.com/mods/warhammer-total-war  There is also the upcoming game: Warhammer Total War http://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/"
patientgamers,3a9svw,JayLeoN90,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"With the right mods, I found some entries in the Total War series to be really enjoyable. A mix of turn-based strategy on the campaign map and RTS battles. Shogun 2 was, in particular, a delight.  Again, though, I have to stress that mods really help out here; the AI notoriously cheats, and some modders have reworked to to acceptable standards that feel fair, yet challenging."
patientgamers,3a9svw,kmacku,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:31:29 2015 UTC,What do the mods fix for the AI? Played shogun 2 a little and stopped. But I didn't notice any cheating
patientgamers,3a9svw,drsquires,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:37:18 2015 UTC,"If you cannot see them, the AI can spawn armies at will. The size/frequency of this largely dependent on the difficulty and stage of the campaign you're in, but after Realm Divide, for instance, remaining daimyos can summon entire stacks of samurai armies in a single turn just out of your sight range, and it's usually ""hard counter"" to whatever makes up the bulk of your forces.  Darthmod, so far as I'm aware, keeps things down to a logical pace. CAI can only recruit from towns where the buildings are in place to recruit them, meaning they still have to travel, and they're far less likely to hold onto an army that'll bankrupt their coffers. The exception to this is the Ashikaga Shogunate in the vanilla campaign, to represent their ability to call soldiers to arms at quick notice.  I believe the Radious mod also addresses some of these issues, but I've really only played with Darthmod, so I can only comment on those."
patientgamers,3a9svw,kmacku,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:42:26 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Never survived to the RD. But yeah thats bogus. Are the mods on Nexus? Or other places? Thanks for the reply

patientgamers,3a5vec,gamogon,21,Wed Jun 17 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"Limbo and Braid.  Limbo just feels so bleakly empty that you get an amazing sense of atmosphere regarding the boy's loneliness. It might not necessarily be the kind of acute emotional story-telling you're thinking of, but I find it a very reflective and introspective game.  Braid is just beautifully crafted. The puzzles are difficult but not too difficult, the story never feels cliche, and the ending is a fantastic mindfuck. The art is also by the guy who does A Lesson Is Learned, But The Damage Is Irreversible, which is just a fantastic webcomic."
patientgamers,3a5vec,forkinanoutlet,6,Wed Jun 17 15:03:54 2015 UTC,I think the ending of Braid is a mindfuck if you go out of your way to read theories and such online. Otherwise I think most people wouldn't get the connections to the a-bomb.

The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones and even Tales from the Borderlands all fit your bill very well and I heartily recommend them. My favorite is the Wolf Among Us, it's an amazing standalone tale that calls upon an amazing universe. I've never felt so in sync with a character as I have with Bigby Wolf.

patientgamers,3a5vec,JoshuaIan,5,Wed Jun 17 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"Dissenting opinion : Gone Home was a steaming pile that only succeeded in reminding me how terrible the 90s were  I watched my GF play the first half hour or so. Told myself, well, this is going nowhere. I see what the overarching plot is and I just don't care. She finished it for me like a trooper, and reported back that I wasn't wrong on any count. The story went nowhere beyond what was totally predictable at the half hour count, and absolutely nothing happened of any consequence whatsoever.  Really, imo, the only thing this game had going for it was all the 90s references, but like I said, it just reminds you of how bad the 90s sucked."
patientgamers,3a5vec,forkinanoutlet,16,Wed Jun 17 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"absolutely nothing happened of any consequence whatsoever.   I'm sorry, but this is just objectively wrong. The sister's story takes time fleshing her out as a character instead of just saying ""I AM THIS."" Gone Home is a story about self-exploration and coming to a realization instead of just HAVING a realization. The point of the story is that while your character was in Europe having a journey of her own, your sister was at home having her own journey, and she's relaying that story to you. It's a game that's not about you. I love it for that.  There are multiple substories beyond the sister's narration that play out and come to fruition. These stories might not be of any consequence to you, but it doesn't mean that other people won't enjoy it.  You're allowed to dislike it and everything, but really, I think you're being a little harsh on a game that you didn't even play. There aren't even really that many 90s references. I mean, the game takes place in the 90s, but it's not shoving it in your face all the time. The girl plays Street Fighter II and has a Super Nintendo, the dad likes X-Files, they have a VHS collection... These aren't really references, these are just things that people did and had in the 90s."

You need to choose not to.    So ... if you have no choice, you are not patient ... because you say so?  Hell, even the right bar of this subreddit has a wider view of it --   A gaming sub for people who wait 6-18 months to play a game because they won't/can't pay full price, or just haven't had the time to keep up with the latest releases.   Won't => you've made a choice.  Can't => you don't have a choice.   Don't forget patient astronaut!   What are you talking about?

I realize we're arguing about what words mean now, which means this is an even bigger waste of time than normal, but if I look the word up --   able to accept or tolerate delays, problems, or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious.   .. nothing in there about the reason being voluntary or involuntary."

Between review sites, forums like this subreddit, let's plays, twitch, etc, it it pretty easy to know what you are getting into before you purchase.   I really like Baldur's Gate, so I decided I'd give Dragon Age Origins a go. Read all the reviews, checked all the technical specs, and guess what? Doesn't work. My kernelbase.dll file is wonky.

I just told you I pirate before purchase to check.    Can you give examples?   Halo 2. All the reviews said it was great, all the people who got it ahead of me said it was great, and I decided a day before it was to be launched in my area to pre-order to secure a copy.

People still haven't cracked the xbox one's security, or the ps4 (though there are lots of rumors). They're still working on the Vita but can't run pirated Vita games at all, and the 3DS is pretty much fully cracked. On consoles, hackers have to fight with companies who spend a lot to keep their security up. The PS3 hasn't been hackable for quite a while without an expensive extra tool to downgrade.   On PC on the other hand, the hackers crack a game within a few days of it coming out. There's not a single PC game I couldn't google right now and have downloaded and installed in the next few hours, but there's no similar ease in pirating games and having them running since you're dealing with so much proprietary hardware and software."

patientgamers,3a8buf,meikyoushisui,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:05:46 2015 UTC,"I think this is evidence enough: http://imgur.com/ANp7ULG  That's a screencap of The Pirate Bay's top 100 torrents in the ""games"" category right now. You can go check for yourself if you want, but there's not a single game on the list for anything except PC. Additionally, browsing game related torrents and sorting by seeders descending, you have to go five pages down to find a single non-PC torrent, and ten pages down to find more than 3. Sure, there are more PC gamers, but not that many more. (And that's by a conservative estimate. For example, if we were to say Steam is all of PC gamers and Xbox 360 and PS3 owners represent all of consoles owners, the consoles still win by a margin of 1.5 times. That's a highly simplified figure, but it's worth noting that there actually may not be that many more.)   Your article:    I spent a ton of time pouring over the NPD, VGChartz data, along with several other public sources on two of their biggest franchisesâ life to date sales.    lol (italics added for emphasis)  All that source really does is debunk the Ubisoft CEO's claim that only 1 out of every 10 copies of Ubi's games are purchased legitimately, and anyone could've told you that was wrong.   Also, he does math that doesn't even make sense here:    Combined:  Piracy rates between these 3 platforms in the top 5 would be nearly 48 million software units if they each had install bases relative to the GPU PC Gaming Install base.  Remember: the PC âs top 5 pirated games amounted to 17.6 million games.  That figure doesnât sound so big now does it?   So we scale each of the consoles to the size of the PC install base and then add them together? What the hell? (Italics not mine, btw. It read to me like the author calling his own bullshit.)   Also, it doesn't take into account that the PS3 wasn't even cracked in the first three years of its lifetime, and neither the XBone or PS4 have been cracked to date."

Also it looks like you havent actually read that link. Raw numbers dont matter, relative sizes do. PC will win in raw numbers because there are more PC gamers overall. And yes, there are That many more. tens times more. Steam doesnt even scratch the surface of PC gamers. It does not even sell the largest PC games.

So, in terms of PC gaming, the trade-off of paying a low price for full support and saving the time of finding a reliable torrent, downloading, installing, patching, and then updating carefully no longer leans in favor of pirating.  However, if we're talking about old and unavailable games on systems like SNES, Dreamcast, and NES, then we're probably talking about retro gaming anyway, but those games are much easier to pirate. I have no incentive to pay after-market prices to 3rd party dealers on obscure and rare hard copies of games that are adequately enjoyed through emulation (think of games like Terranigma in North America or Mega Man X2). Sure, there's a certain authentic allure to playing them on the original hardware, but unless you count yourself as a retro gaming collector, simply enjoying those titles on your gaming PC through emulation should be sufficient. You can buy certain games through services like Nintendo's eShop, and those are typically of high quality, so again, like I said above, if I can find a good priced title I want to play on an official service - trading a small fee for the time it takes to set up an emulation experience leans in favor of paying for the supported software."

I would've bought it if it did run, but like almost every game it didn't run at all. I don't pirate other PC games- Steam is really convenient, and cheap when bought a while after release- but I've downloaded ROMs of emulatable games, mainly SNES, GBA, DS, PSP, GameCube, and Wii. GC and Wii were just so I could play Super Smash Bros online since the Wii's online servers were shut down. I'm not commenting on the morality of it. Most, but not all, of the games I've emulated I've owned in some capacity before."

patientgamers,3a8buf,WillTheKill,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"For the most part, I don't find it all that practical.  The biggest drawback to me is file size - some of them are astronomically large, and for some reason that's really off-putting for me.  Even though I buy everything digitally these days and have to download it anyways.  It's an odd quirk of mine.  On top of that, the risk just isn't worth it.  If there's a game that I'm on the fence about getting, I can go on YouTube and look up someone's Let's Play, I can read up reviews, check various subreddits, try out a demo if available - there's so many options I have where I can make a decision as to whether or not to pick something up.  Sales help too!"
patientgamers,3a8buf,Advanced-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"I typically resort to pirating when i don't have the money/budget to spend on games. If I currently have a job and all my bills are paid, I'm buying. if I am having issues, I'm pirating until I can afford it.  After I get the some money, I tend to buy the games I enjoyed in the long run."
patientgamers,3a8buf,nenjiavero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was a huge pirate until a couple of years ago. Then Steam came along, and now I pirate games just to have a taste (sort of like a Demo version).  If I like it, I go on and buy it.  If I don't like it, I delete it."
patientgamers,3a8buf,tupendous,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:06:35 2015 UTC,"yeah, I usually pirate single player games, spend a few hours on them and then delete them from my computer. I'm 14 years old without any money outside of what I'm saving for college so I don't really have a choice."
patientgamers,3a8buf,BabyRager,-3,Thu Jun 18 23:39:09 2015 UTC,i pirate something i cant get or has ridiculous prices for its age(past gen console games)  also pirating games that dont have demos and are relatively short(3 hours or less) cause fuck these people for not realising them. well unless game is very cheap (<1$/Euro)

patientgamers,3a8sbp,rarelypost,2,Sat Jun 20 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"You have to remember Skyrim was released in 2011 and Bethesda usually has good engines that allow lower graphic card gamers to play their games even on release while GZ requires a GTX 650 2GB card as a minimum.  I wouldn't be surprised you couldn't run it, but as you said, you now have it to play later for a good price.  I got a lot of my games that way, bought them when my PC couldn't run them, but I have them and am now able to play them since I have a PC capable of running them just fine.  Once you build your own PC you'll probably feel like me and never want to go back to those days of putting the settings to low and turning every graphical option off so you can actually run the game.  It really ruins the experience."
patientgamers,3a8sbp,TzakShrike,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:26:16 2015 UTC,I'm going to call you out on the good engines thing. Bethesda didn't even use the optimise switch on the compiler when they compiled Skyrim.
patientgamers,3a8sbp,rarelypost,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:10:22 2015 UTC,I just meant their engines usually will allow people with lower end graphics cards to play the game whereas most other games are way too graphics heavy and won't run at all on those cards.
patientgamers,3a8sbp,5py,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize they optimized so much. I'm definitely just going to wait till I can get a gaming pc, getting ground zeros $5 was a steal."

patientgamers,3a6lt8,TheHolyCabbage,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:38:55 2015 UTC,"By all means, i love this series, but not on PC. If you have any console - just get it there.  Port quality is terrible (it's a port of PS3 version, not PS4, btw). Game isn't optimized at all and manages to have poor performance on PC that can chew through Witcher 3 on max settings. Game doesn't recognize XInput devices so it uses some weird-ass random controller mapping and you need to remap buttons yourself (by finding correct mapping on the internet since game sure as hell doesn't provide one). Even if you use controller all prompts and tips will still use keyboard keys. Also game doesn't support mouse, at all, not in the menus, not in the game. Good luck rotating camera with keyboard. And more of other issues. Oh, and have i mentioned performance and graphics quality? For fucks sake, Zelda Musou on Wii U looks a lot better than this game on PC.  tl;dr: PC port has a laundry list of issues and Tecmo Koei is not concerned about fixing them."

patientgamers,3a6lt8,TheHolyCabbage,17,Thu Jun 18 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty ridiculous that the best they can do for Skyrim Legendary is 66% off.  The standalone DLCs are also going for $10 each right now, which is double the price of the base game.  Don't get me wrong, $13.59 is still a decent deal for Skyrim LE, but one would think it would be a little cheaper by now."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,HongManChoi,6,Wed Jun 17 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"It's been interesting how the games I already purchased a year or more ago are still the same price, or sometimes more expensive now. Prices on Steam just don't seem to keep dropping anymore like they used to, so there's been less and less of a reason to wait for Steam sales when other places have it discounted for a historic low.  I remember seeing a couple of deals over the past year like the legendary for $11 on Gamefly about a year ago, and the $13.59 discount being a very frequent deal available from different vendors. Even the Elder Scroll Anthology with all the Elder Scrolls games has popped up at times for $15 to $20."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,Discoteca,2,Wed Jun 17 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"Question: Is it worth getting the expansion packs?  I've never played Skyrim, and am super pumped, and definitely buying it today, but are the expansion packs decent?   I've had a lot of fun with fallout 3 and NV without the DLC thus far (though I'm fairly certain I will soon shell out for the NV dlc soon. I need more.)"
patientgamers,3a6lt8,ZeGoldMedal,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yes the DLC are worth getting, and I enjoyed the quests from the Dragonborn DLC more than the base game.

patientgamers,3a6lt8,Discoteca,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. Even if you don't like the DLC's, they're needed for a lot of mods so its worth getting them for that."

Contrary to most - I thought rage was worth the money at $5.   FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.  It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it. NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.

patientgamers,3a6lt8,MDRAR,2,Wed Jun 17 17:15:26 2015 UTC,Is rage as terrible as half the Internet makes out to be?
patientgamers,3a6lt8,DSettahr,2,Wed Jun 17 21:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Most people expect Fallout 3. And are dissappointed. Rage is everything that Fallout 3 wasn't - and I love it for that.  Fallout 3's gunplay is a turn-based-tactical-RPG with real-time FPS controls.  Rage is an actual FPS with good FPS controls. Using the shotgun in that game is very satisfying.  Fallout 3 is open world, be who you want, do what you want. Rage is fairly closed in - you can only go where they want you to go, and you can only be the main character.  If you're looking for FPS that feels and kinda plays like an old school FPS where your personal skill with the various weapons makes a huge difference and you can overlook a not-so-great story and linear gameplay - then go for it. It's totally worth it.    If you're looking for something like Fallout 3 - skip it. It's not the same game.  EDIT: Rage also has a racing game built in. It's not great. It's not terrible. I ignored it and just used the cars to get me to more places to shoot more things with my shotgun."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,dustomcgee,3,Wed Jun 17 21:36:41 2015 UTC,"Excellent, this explains the polarisation very well.   I though it was more doom/quake style, so sounds fine to me."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,Red-Blue-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"The vehicle stuff is more of a vehicle deathmatch / action racing type deal that's closest to something like the vehicle segments in Jak 3 than a traditional racing game.  The shooting is much more similar to Doom 3 than anything else.  It's a fun game, pretty solid enemy AI but it's easy to see through it and exploit it.    I'd give it about a 7.  Definitely worth $5 but temper your expectations."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,ZeGoldMedal,0,Thu Jun 18 07:59:26 2015 UTC,"One other thing - the ending is ... well ... abrupt, kinda odd and mildly disappointing.  Mostly story wise, but somewhat gameplay wise. It almost felt like an incomplete game."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,HnNaldoR,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I read that - most people seemed to think that so long as you bought the DLC, you would be OK.  Apparently it lets you keep playing after the ""end"" of the game."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,denselross,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"I've been playing it through for the first time over the past few days.  I'm enjoying it.  I also knew very little about it beforehand, though, so I went into it with zero expectations as to what the game would be.  It's decent gameplay combined with beautiful settings."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,JoshuaIan,2,Thu Jun 18 02:05:18 2015 UTC,I have enough in my steam wallet for Oblivion GOTY but not the Deluxe. Is the content from deluxe significant enough to hold off for now?
patientgamers,3a6lt8,denselross,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"The GOTY edition includes the base game and both expansions. The deluxe editions also includes weapon dlc, horse armor, and a few player home dlc. You can get content similar to what's in the deluxe edition from mods for free. GOTY is a better deal."
patientgamers,3a6lt8,rarelypost,2,Thu Jun 18 20:12:27 2015 UTC,"Stick of Truth, worth it? Should I wait longer?  I'm definitely grabbing Skyrim, but should I get the DLC pack?"
patientgamers,3a6lt8,denselross,5,Wed Jun 17 23:41:02 2015 UTC,If you like south Park. It's fantastic. The price is still high for how short the game is. But it's very enjoyable.   Buy skyrim legendary edition. The dlc is important for mods and they are expensive by themselves.
patientgamers,3a6lt8,JoshuaIan,3,Thu Jun 18 01:16:31 2015 UTC,I was hoping Bastion could get lower (even though it's the lowest recorded price now with the flash sale.) Here's to waiting for next sale!
patientgamers,3a6lt8,Discoteca,14,Wed Jun 17 17:19:44 2015 UTC,"Dude, 3.74 is VERY much worth it. Unless you need to donate plasma or something equally onerous to scrounge up four bucks, you're only doing yourself a disservice by waiting for it to get cheaper. It's not going to ever get much cheaper than this, and it's a fantastic game."
patientgamers,3a8u65,empire4hire,7,Thu Jun 18 03:34:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you are looking for exactly. With Microsoft announcing backwards compatibility for XBone, there will be a lot more games from last gen to play now if you never got the chance before. I personally think that PS4 has better exclusives out now and coming in the future. I own both consoles and I totally prefer PS4. One of the main reasons is because the interface/homescreen is set up better imo. XBone is cheaper now than the PS4 is so if you are on a tight budget that is also another factor to consider."
patientgamers,3a8u65,jimmy_m,5,Thu Jun 18 04:36:47 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend the PS4 just for the fact that Microsoft seems to be more willing to share Xbone exclusives with PC. If the OP ever gets a decent PC, he will be able to play a lot of PC-Xbone shared exclusives, while Sony usually doesn't share exclusives with PC, especially if the games are made by a first party studio."
patientgamers,3a8u65,lacsativ,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:14:31 2015 UTC,"Ps4 outweighs the Xbox 1, especially in hardware. You will get a longer life out of a ps4. The controller is better too. Also psn is better than Xbox live, imo."
patientgamers,3a8u65,motionmatrix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:07:53 2015 UTC,Is the ps4 controller much different from the ps3? I played on my friends ps3 and thought the controller was tiny. My hands didn't fit it very well lol.
patientgamers,3a8u65,TheWild93,3,Fri Jun 19 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"My little brother's patient tactic with consoles was waiting for the first revision; stores a pushing out the older models and you can usually haggle a deal out of it. I know that is how he got his PS3 back in the day for â¬180 including a second controller +2 additional free games (One game was included with the PS3 as a bundle), right when the slim edition came around."
patientgamers,3a8u65,Svardskampe,2,Thu Jun 18 05:52:10 2015 UTC,For me it's the same question and it is not really a question at the same time: my friends are on Xbox so I'll buy an Xbox. As a 360 gamer since 2006 I also like the user interface and continuing my gamerscore. Besides the 360 I also own a PS3 but besides playing through some exclusives it is really only collecting dust.
patientgamers,3a8u65,RisingRapture,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:32:21 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the same as me, except for the duration of 360 ownership. :-D"
patientgamers,3a8u65,gk3coloursred,2,Thu Jun 18 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"If you don't build a pc, just consider 2 things: friends and exclusives."
patientgamers,3a8u65,Delgadoooo,2,Thu Jun 18 12:39:30 2015 UTC,"Whichever one your friends are on. If you don't do much mutliplayer, then who has the exclusives you want to play? That one"
patientgamers,3a8u65,Boris_Ignatievich,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:58:15 2015 UTC,"From the features you asked for out of the options you gave the PS4 is the better call - though in some games the fixed higher resolution of the PS4 leads to lower framerates than the Xbox 1. Though the Xbox one is cheaper, fairly significantly so, in the UK. however if performance is genuinely a chief concern then it might be worth at least considering building a PC."
patientgamers,3a8u65,KING_of_Trainers69,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:39:47 2015 UTC,"Xbone is significantly cheaper if you pick up the right bundle, backward compatible while PS4 is more powerful and runs higher resolution. It all boils down to where your friends are and what exclusives you'd like to play. Would you play Halo over Uncharted, GT over Forza?? You won't go wrong either way to be honest. But if you can, give PC a chance"
patientgamers,3a8u65,icecoldtanim,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:37:07 2015 UTC,"If I had to pick between the two I'd decide based on the exclusives you don't want to miss out on, since there isn't that huge of a difference in performance or value between the two.   It is about the games after all, so take a look at the franchises like Uncharted, Last of Us, Ratchet and Clank, Halo, Forza, and Gears of War to decide.   But, if don't care at all about the exclusives and are more interested in third party titles I'd go with the PS4 due to the graphics being slightly better. For instance, Witcher 3 is 1080p/30fps on the PS3, but 900p/30fps on the Xbox One."
patientgamers,3a8u65,Discoteca,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:40:30 2015 UTC,"Between those two - PS4. Slightly better hardware and performance. Better free games with the ""subscription"" to basic user rights their service.  In general - PC and/or Wii U."
patientgamers,3a8u65,NekoiNemo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:07:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason today to get a current gen console based on the games currently out for either system. I am thinking this fall or after Christmas I might consider getting one.  Go with what your friends have or who you will end up playing with more often.   I had a PS1/2/3, but there is no compatibility to stick with the PS4 and both services require a monthly subscription to play games online.  I am patiently waiting for more games or a price cut from both or either."
patientgamers,3a8u65,tinybadger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"The performance of the two is much the same. At the end of the day I highly doubt most people could look at footage or screenshots of a multi-plat game and say for sure it was on One or PS4.  As /u/Delgadoooo and /u/Boris_Ignatievich said - friends and exclusives are the two main differences.  Which has more of the exclusive games now or upcoming which interest you, and which machine is the format of choice of your friends.  If both these answers are the same that's probably the one to go for.  If they are different, then look at the games, look at what your buddies play and make a call.  So many big games now are multi-plat that no matter what you ought to have the majority of the games that you'd like to play released on your platform of choice."
patientgamers,3a8u65,gk3coloursred,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"In this case, since you're looking solely at console gaming, I'd go with the one that has the more appealing exclusive titles.  If you're into shooters such as Gears of War and Halo, then I'd say Xbox is the way to go (I would think Xbox Live is still the superior multiplayer option to Sony's online gameplay, but again, only if that was a factor to you).  Personally, I'm planning on getting a PS4 over an X1 later this year, but the biggest reason for that is Rock Band 4.  I have a PS3 and way too much DLC for the Rock Band series, so getting an X1 wouldn't logically make sense for me.  While I really want to play Sunset Overdrive, I can't justify buying a console for just one game.  If you were making the choice at the end of 2013 when both consoles were released, I'd say the PS4 would be the stronger option, but I do think Microsoft has taken a lot of great steps with regards to making the X1 a worthwhile investment.  So I don't think you'd be making a bad choice with either option."
patientgamers,3a8u65,WillTheKill,0,Fri Jun 19 02:21:15 2015 UTC,stick with PC. Games are WAYYYYYY much cheaper on the PC and only very few titles are exclusive on consoles which you may not even be interested in.
patientgamers,3a8u65,Rngesus123,2,Thu Jun 18 05:03:22 2015 UTC,Like Gears of War and Uncharted for example...
patientgamers,3a8u65,RisingRapture,-2,Thu Jun 18 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"Gears of war is coming to PC and for uncharted, the PS3 emulator is well under its way, just be patient"
patientgamers,3a8u65,Dartvoider,3,Thu Jun 18 10:28:18 2015 UTC,"Gears of War 1 was ported to PC, not 2, not 3, not Judgment. And being patient for a PC emulation of the Uncharted series which I can get all games for PS3 already for probably less then 10 bucks makes absolutely no sense. There is a difference between being patient and delaying something into eternity."
patientgamers,3a8u65,RisingRapture,-2,Thu Jun 18 10:50:49 2015 UTC,Gears of war 1 was a vista exclusive IIRC and is now releasing on PC again with the ultimate edition thingy-ma-jig. Waiting to play them and then being able to play them at higher framerates and resolutions is a good reason to wait. Personally I cant play anything below 60 and lower than 1080p. I mean have you ever tried any emulation upscaling? It's such a joy to play them at a good quality.
patientgamers,3a8u65,Dartvoider,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"Please supply link to Gears Ultimate coming for PC. As said, later iterations never came to PC, so this would be a surprise."
patientgamers,3a8u65,RisingRapture,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:47:26 2015 UTC,"Here you go, I suspect if they make remakes of the sequel they'll also come to pc, Microsoft has been embracing PC gaming with Windows 10. More so than ever before.  Also, Halo might be coming to PC"
patientgamers,3a8u65,Dartvoider,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:02:01 2015 UTC,Most interesting and something completely left out of all the console talk.
patientgamers,3a8u65,RisingRapture,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"Generally the PS4 is performing far better than the Xbox One this generation, especially considering units sold. They have branched out and heavily supported the indie scene, there's a lot of compelling exclusives on the table, and their PS+ offering should be getting stronger on the PS4 with time. PS+ is generally a pretty good deal ($50/year) and nets you a lot of games you may have not otherwise tried.  Sony has also been fairly aggressive in matching Steam-quality sales. Every couple of weeks they have a flash sale. Here's an example.   In regards to your specific question, value and performance, the PS4 does have better hardware under the hood. The One brings the balance a little closer with its price cut, but the PS4 simply has better hardware in it, hence the whole ""resolution"" wars that have happened, where a game will be either 60fps on the PS4 and 30fps on the One, or 1080p on the PS4 and 900p on the One."
patientgamers,3a8u65,BitWarrior,0,Thu Jun 18 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is going with a pc. If you REALLY want to get a console I would suggest you hold off for a while more. It probably won't be much longer when the next version of the consoles come out and the originals plummet in price. There are rumors that the consols want to go to 4k, since there having troubles with getting 1080 it means a serious hardware upgrade. Also perhaps a ""slim"" version too. But really I'd just get a pc. From steam sales I have more then enough games to last till fallout4."
patientgamers,3a8u65,Wyatt1313,-2,Thu Jun 18 04:24:50 2015 UTC,"It's not that a game is cheap that makes it good, but rather that it's a game that you'd be willing to play. Do your research and find which next gen games you want to play. Buy the console that has those games.  My opinion is that the PC is where it is at."
patientgamers,3a8u65,AmuseDeath,-1,Thu Jun 18 08:32:28 2015 UTC,"If you have time to be playing games, then you have time to build a gaming PC."
patientgamers,3a8u65,TheMinisterOfSound,-9,Thu Jun 18 19:25:06 2015 UTC,PC maybe you scrub?
patientgamers,3a60aj,The_Bourbon_Biscuit,28,Wed Jun 17 14:31:35 2015 UTC,"Probably not as a whole series as they experimented a lot, but there's definitely a game for everybody. You should start with FFI, it's THE classic JRPG romp. If  you're a younger fan, it will blow your mind how much game they were able to put into a tiny cart back in the day. FFII is a departure from the traditional leveling system and can be frustrating. I think FFIII was the one that can go eat a dick. There were absolutely no ""save points"" so you could only save on the world map. Story was too bland to make the frustrating mechanics worth it. FFIV is/was loooong. But not bad. Never played FFV. FFVI, by far, had one of the best stories. FFVII-FFIX were just incredible and I'd recommend all three. However, if you had to chose, I would go with FFIX. It was a swan song for the PS1 and love letter to the Final Fantasy fans. It literally had the best elements of its predecessors. X had a good story but cringy voice acting. I skipped XI, XII, and XIV because two were MMOs and XII was when college happened. XIII 1-3 are incredibly streamlined and graphically beautiful. The story's damn near incoherent but fun if you want something pretty to stare at.   TL;DR Play FFI, Edit: FFIV FFVI (oops mixed that up, play the one with the mad clown), FFIX, in that order, then save FFII for the HD remake.  Second Edit The Playstation store has IV-IX available so you're in luck if you have a PS3/PSP. Link The prices are a bit steep, but they usually have a sale around this time of year."
patientgamers,3a60aj,TrandaBear,10,Wed Jun 17 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"You described IX perfectly.  I think that VI is overall my favorite, but I had such an emotional attachment to almost every single character in IX, especially after VIII (I'm sorry, I hated Squall).    Another one in the series that you didn't mention is FFTactics. The ones on DS are pretty good, but I really love the PSP port of the original FFTactics, and I would say it rivals any of the other games in terms of story, difficulty, mechanics, and investment.  It will be different from a traditional RPG in that it plays more like a wargaming map. Definitely made the bus ride to and from school a lot more fun."
patientgamers,3a60aj,Wadysseus,5,Wed Jun 17 15:41:41 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, how could I forget my favorite FF and general game of all time??? I absolutely loved FFT! The music, the art style, the character customization depth. I think this was before the PS1 had dedicated localization teams, because some of the story was a goddamn mess. But the PSP version (FFT: War of the Lions) clears it all up. The story is an incredibly deep tale of political intrigue with jabs at the church, monarchy, and how history is written by the victor. Almost GOT level.   My only real gripes are this particular 1v1 boss battle, midway through the game, that they never warned you about, how obtuse the ""side quests"" are, and how easy it got towards the end. If you had Balthier and Count Orlandu it was an automatic win.   I never played the Tactics Advanced line, but heard they weren't bad.  VIII was graphically superior to VII in every way but the devs made some weird choices. Enemies that scaled with you meant you would be boned if you didn't have the right gear. But only enemies at a high enough level would drop crafting materials at frustratingly low rates. The junction system also threw people off since it was such a departure from materia."
patientgamers,3a60aj,TrandaBear,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:15:39 2015 UTC,"Oh man, 100's of hours into fft. BTW, all you needed was Agria and a ribbon and you were an invincible, auto resurrecting monster.  The rest of the series will definitely be enjoyed but it's not as good as the original."

patientgamers,3a60aj,GammaTainted,5,Wed Jun 17 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"They're all unrelated stories, with only a few running themes and reappearing names connecting them. If you try one or six and decide it's not really keeping your interest, try seven or nine instead."
patientgamers,3a60aj,reddit_can_suck_my_,3,Wed Jun 17 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"Never played FFV   What the hell man, go play it. It's got a job system. A JOB SYSTEM. I think I actually prefer it to 6 in many ways, I've certainly cleared it more times."
patientgamers,3a60aj,TrandaBear,5,Wed Jun 17 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"Ironically I own V, but it comes packaged with VI and I always get distracted buy the latter. Just like how I never got around to the PS1 version of IV because it came with Chrono Trigger."
patientgamers,3a60aj,TheSnowNinja,2,Thu Jun 18 00:11:15 2015 UTC,"FFVI, by far, had one of the best stories. FFVII-FFIX were just incredible and I'd recommend all three.

X had a good story but cringy voice acting.   I agree with everything here. FFVI is definitely my favorite. The story, characters, and music are all amazing.  I also really like FFIX and FFX. FFIX had better characters, but as you said, the story in FFX is awesome. I liked the card game in nine and blitzball in ten.  Tactics is definitely up near the top as well.  FF7 and FF8 weren't quite as good in my opinion, even if they are still good games. FF7 was very convoluted and the graphics are really dated. FF8 had kind of a silly system, and the draw/junction system was a little broken."
patientgamers,3a60aj,TrandaBear,2,Thu Jun 18 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"FF7 may not hold up too well, but I remember it blowing my little mind. It was at that moment I knew what I wanted for the next three  Christmases. To go from 2D to full 3D was such a monumental leap in technology.  It was one of those ""where were you when..."" kind of moments for me.   The VIII junction system was just awful. I remember sitting there and drawing powerful spells from bosses for hours just to boost my stats. But I couldn't use said spells because then I'd be weak again. Blah! Terrible."

patientgamers,3a60aj,CaspianX2,7,Wed Jun 17 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"Most of the Final Fantasy games have nothing to do with each other. It's not a series you need to ""get into"", as if you need to play all of them to really ""get"" it. Rather, you can generally pick and choose which games in the series to try without worrying about missing out on plot.  That said, some of the individual games in the series do have direct sequels. Here's a guide to how that works:  Final Fantasy I, II, and III are each self-contained. No significant connection to any other games in the series.  Final Fantasy IV had a direct sequel called Final Fantasy IV: The After Years on Wii Shop Channel that was also included in the PSP version of the game.  Final Fantasy V was mostly self-contained, but there was an anime series, Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals, set in the same world.  Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest and Final Fantasy VI are both self-contained. No significant connection to any other games in the series.  Final Fantasy VII had two prequels (Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII), a spin-off action game (Dirge of Cerberus), a film sequel (Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children), and an anime prequel (Last Order: Final Fantasy VII).  Final Fantasy VIII and IX are both self-contained. No significant connection to any other games in the series.  Final Fantasy X has a direct sequel, Final Fantasy X-2.  Final Fantasy XI is an MMO with multiple expansions.  Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XII, and Vagrant Story all take place in the same world, Ivalice, but have very little direct connection to each other's stories. Final Fantasy XII has a spin-of/sequel (Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings).  Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and Final Fantasy Tactics A2 all also nominally take place in Ivalice, though it's debatable whether the Ivalice in these games is the same as the one from the previous one, or ""based on"" that one, since the games' plot involves a ""world within a world"" sorta' story.  Crystal Defenders is apparently inspired by the Final Fantasy Tactics games' Ivalice, but has no story.  Final Fantasy XIII has two sequels (Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lighting Returns: Final Fantasy XIII). Additionally, Final Fantasy Type-O, Final Fantasy Agito, and Final Fantasy XV are set in the same world, but presumably have little direct connection (TBH, I haven't followed these).  Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO, and had a revamp called Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.  Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles has a prequel (Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Ring of Fates), two sequels (Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time), and two spinoff games (Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King, and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord)  Final Fantasy Adventure is actually the first in the Mana series. It only got the Final Fantasy name in Western territories to try to garner sales.  Dissidia: Final Fantasy (and its sequel, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy) are fighting games featuring Final Fantasy characters from various games, but it is generally seen as non-canon as it relates to those respective games.  The Kingdom Hearts series features numerous characters from various Final Fantasy games, but it is generally seen as non-canon as it relates to those respective games.  Various Chocobo games (Chocobo Racing, Chocobo Dungeon, etc.) have been made that are thematically tied to the Final Fantasy series, but only loosely, and have no canon story ties to any other games.  Final Fantasy Dimensions is an episodic cell phone game with no connection to any other game in the series.  Final Fantasy: The Four Heroes of Light has no direct connection to any game in the series, and is generally considered the predecessor to the Bravely Default series.  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a film that had no connection to any game, and arguably only weak thematic ties to the series.  Final Fantasy Unlimited is an anime series that had no direct connection to any game.  By this point, you are probably saying ""HOLY SHIT, THAT'S A LOT!"", and you're right... but because of the way the Final Fantasy franchise is structured, you only need to bite off small portions at a time.  So what's your best entry point? Well, that depends what you're looking for. The most highly-acclaimed entries in the series generally tend to be Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy XII, and Final Fantasy Tactics.  Before moving on, it's worth noting that these games differ in more ways than just storyline - Final Fantasy VII plays very differently from Final Fantasy X, which plays very differently from Final Fantasy XII, which plays very differently than Final Fantasy Tactics. This means that if you don't like one Final Fantasy game, you might still like others.  Final Fantasy VI is a good starting point if you're looking to play the series highlights in chronological order. It is also the epitome of the ""old-style"" Final Fantasy games, before they went to fancy pre-rendered cutscenes and 3D graphics. It was released originally on the SNES as Final Fantasy III in Western territories, but was later re-released on the PlayStation (with added cutscenes and a few other minor extras), Game Boy Advance (as Final Fantasy VI Advance), Wii Virtual Console (as Final Fantasy III), PlayStation Network, Android and iOS. Your best bet for playing it legally these days is either going to be on one of those last four options.  Final Fantasy VII remains by far the most popular game in the series, and the one that most of the fanboys still swoon over. At the time, it was a huge technological leap over the predecessor, at least graphically... although I'd argue that time has not been kind to it. In any case, most series fans would say that if you can only play one Final Fantasy game, this one is the one to play. It's kinda' right on the cusp of old-style versus new - it still has the ""ATB"" battle system of old-style games (combining menu-based combat with real-time actions), and doesn't drastically change the series' core formula, but it does have modern additions (like the aforementioned graphical upgrades). If you start here, don't worry about the sequels, prequels, and spinoffs. You can pursue those later if you want, but plain ol' Final Fantasy VII is the place to start. However... don't be too hasty. Square just announced (like, two days ago) a fancy, slick, modern remake of the game for next-gen consoles, so you might want to wait for that.  Final Fantasy X, I would argue, is possibly the epitome of the ""new-style"" Final Fantasy. This was the first game that completely ditched the ATB system in favor of a completely turn-based menu system, along with an experimental new ""Sphere grid"" system that both allowed for a lot of character customization while also keeping individual characters distinct. I personally think that this game has possible the best story in the series, and aside from one cringe-inducing scene, it also had very good voice acting (a series first). All-told, I think this is probably the most balanced game in the series. It was originally released on PS2, but these days you're better off going with its remastered re-release on PS3, Vita, or PS4, which has gotten both a graphical upgrade and includes the game's direct sequel, Final Fantasy X-2 (which is decent, but not nearly as good as its predecessor).  Final Fantasy Tactics is not technically a Final Fantasy game, but a spin-off. Nevertheless, it is a superb game well worth playing. Just keep in mind that it plays nothing like most other games in the series - with its gameplay, based on Tactics Ogre, being one of the first big entries in the Tactics-Based RPG genre later populated largely by games by Nippon Ichi (such as Disgaea). final Fantasy Tactics was the game that started the fictional world of Ivalice, and the Ivalice games more or less all have some similar threads running through them - as far as the plot is concerned, the games mostly have the magic and fantasy elements taking a back-seat to political backstabbing and intrigue, much akin to something like Game of Thrones. In its original release, this was marred by a less-than-stellar localization, but later re-releases on PSP and iOS, and that's the version to go for if you're interested.  Finally, Final Fantasy XII takes the political intrigue of Ivalice and puts it into a big-budget console game with yet another new unique, experimental gameplay system that gives players the ability to essentially pre-program allied characters' actions, making them semi-autonomous while still completely controlled by the player (if the player chooses). This game was only released on the PS2.  I hope that answers your question!"
patientgamers,3a60aj,docbauies,5,Wed Jun 17 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"i think 4 is a good game. plenty of fun. good story.   6 is amazing. probably one of my favorite games of all time (although some of that is probably related to the fact that I played it when I would go to my best friend's house, as I didn't have an SNES). the leveling system, the espers, all that stuff is mind blowingly good, especially for its time.  i started 7 and didn't go too far, but will pick it up in the future.   never played 8 or 9.    10 is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it. I didn't mind the voice acting. and for its time it was gorgeous. the HD remake might be a good version to play, but I can't say for sure.    1 is a good basis for understanding where the game came from, but i don't think it's essential personally."
patientgamers,3a60aj,the_digital_man,6,Wed Jun 17 15:54:10 2015 UTC,"VII got me into jrpgs, VIII made me fall in love with the series.  I've always been told VI is the best in the series however.  FWIW they all have amazing soundtracks.  You could also argue that chrono trigger fits in nicely with the FF series.  If you're having a hard time getting into the older games I would give Chrono trigger a shot, because I feel this is the poster child for games 'aging well'"
patientgamers,3a60aj,ACardAttack,3,Wed Jun 17 16:21:30 2015 UTC,I've always been told VI is the best in the series however.   Have you not played it?  If not you should!
patientgamers,3a60aj,crazymoefaux,5,Wed Jun 17 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"The first is a classic, and a great study in early JRPG design.  The second and third are skippable.  IV was originally sold in the west as ""Final Fantasy II.""  The story and characters are solid.  They did a sequel originally for cellphones called ""Final Fantasy IV - The After Years"" that has since been ported to the PSP (as part of ""FFIV - The Complete Collection""), Wii (as WiiWare), and most recently for PC (but the PSP port is the definitive version, and it's totally emulatable).  V was never released in the west, so if you want to play it, you'll need to emulate it.  It's also pretty good.  VI was originally released in the west as ""Final Fantasy III,"" and it remains my favorite.  Widest cast of playable characters (no matter who you are, you'll have a favorite or two), awesome music, best story IMO.  VII was the first 3D.  The graphics from the PS1 era are a bit dated, but if you get the PC version of steam, you can replace some of the assets to make it look more modern.    VIII was pretty good, but the story I felt was a bit lacking compared to VI or VII.  Square had a bit of trouble translating the dialog, though.  In the JP version, Squall's is supposed to come off as deeply introspective, but when translated, he just sounds broody and whining.  IX is another fan favorite.  I never finished it, but intend to eventually.  X was great in it's own right, questionable English voice acting execution aside.  I wish they'd start allowing us to use the JP VA tracks with subs, a feature I love in Bravely Default and Hyperdimention Neptunia.  XI was their first MMORPG.  I can't believe they're still charging a monthly fee for it.  I played it for a couple years before moving on, and then swearing off MMORPGs with monthly fees.  Entirely skippable.  XII was influenced by the battle system of XI.  The Gambit system let you program your other party members to not suck.  After playing as a WHM in XI, pick-up groups being a crapshoot in terms of the skill levels of your fellow party members (and taking many dirtnaps when we found an incompetent tank), I thought this was kinda cool.  XIII... I'm slogging through.  I hate the VA execution, and the battle system is finicky even after you get used to it.  Honestly, I'm having a hard time working up the will to finish it.  I haven't played it's sequels, and don't want to until I've finished the first, but all the characters are just plain whiny douches.  The story sounds pretty cool on paper, but poor script translation or VA execution kills any empathy I have for any of the main characters.  Again, I wish I could switch to the JP Voice-overs, but SE doesn't seem to think that's something worth doing with their FF games.  XIV is another MMORPG, never played it.  If you're looking for a good starting point, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9 are all great entry points."

Well it didn't have an official release, but it has been ported twice, as far as I know. It was released in the west for the ps1 with FFVI as ""Final Fantasy Anthology"". Both games have additional FMV sequences.  There's also FFV Advance for the GBA. I recommend buying/emulating this version of the game because of the addition of new jobs and dungeons."
patientgamers,3a60aj,crazymoefaux,2,Thu Jun 18 07:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I spaced on those.  A friend of mine used to have FF Anthology, so that was a pretty bad oversight on my part.  Thanks for clarifying."
patientgamers,3a60aj,scrumpylungs,6,Thu Jun 18 08:00:54 2015 UTC,"Personally I think FFI --> FFIV are skippable, unless you already have a a major interest in turn based RPGs you probably won't enjoy them, maybe if you love the series you can come back later, but they're not the best for getting you into Final Fantasy I don't think.  FFV is very enjoyable, but is very much a personal favourite rather than being recommended by most Final Fantasy fans. It's light hearted, good story and the job system is very well done! I'd recommend it but, I think I'm in the minority on that one.  Everything from FFVI --> FFX is essential, with VII and IX probably being the highlights. Those were the glory days. As many have said, the games are unrelated so you can start in whatever order you want, but I guess it makes sense to move forwards to see how the games evolved at least in terms of development!  FFXII is full of forgettable characters with both bland storyline and gameplay. Unless you find yourself falling in love with everything final fantasy, I'd skip it.  FFX-2 brings back a job system similar to FFV mixed in with FFX's great battle system but is a weird bubble gum pop game that completely lacks focus in terms of where the story is going. Not essential by any means, but if you loved FFX then it's worth a look!  FFXIII is the most divisive in terms of opinion I think. More linear than ever before and a very unique battle system based very much on roles and tactics. For me - the first 2/3rds of this game made me think it would be the greatest Final Fantasy of all time. Amazing. Then the final 1/3rd turns into a massive convoluted dump in terms of story. Still great overall so I would say it's worth a look! Some really memorable moments.  and that's as far as I've gone! Moved away from consoles and haven't yet picked up FFXIII-2 on PC"
patientgamers,3a60aj,TrandaBear,2,Wed Jun 17 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed FFXIII but can totally see the gripes. The battle system was streamline and nuanced. You had to know who had what ability in order to optimize for some of the late game monsters. The graphics were gorgeous! But the story, as you said, crapped itself. L'cie, Fal'cie, Orphan, Cocoon, WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT???  FFXIII-2 had a much more coherent story and concise playtime. I think it took me 40 hours to 100%. FFXIII-3 took a weird Majora's Mask turn. I started it, then... kinda got a PS4 for Christmas and haven't gotten back to it."

patientgamers,3a60aj,DigitoCrepitus,3,Wed Jun 17 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"VI, VII and VIII are definitely worth playing - you won't need to play the others to understand the backstory.

patientgamers,3a60aj,seifer93,3,Wed Jun 17 16:38:00 2015 UTC,"Everyone is talking about the flagship Final Fantasy series and has given excellent recommendations, so I'll step away from that a bit. Check out the spinoffs.  Final Fantasy Tactics (War of the Lions,) Tactics Advance, and Tactics A2 are all fantastic strategy RPGs. If you like Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem, or Advanced Wars then this is definitely a series worth playing. Of the three, Final Fantasy Tactics and its remake, War of the Lions, is the best.  Final Fantasy Chronicles on Gamecube is held in extremely high regard. It's a good time if you can assemble your friends for a play session.  Final Fantasy Adventure is a neat Gameboy game and it it sparked the Mana series. It's pretty different from other FF games as it's an action game, but it's worth checking out."
patientgamers,3a60aj,PrivilegeCheckmate,2,Wed Jun 17 16:38:14 2015 UTC,"I started with VI, which was good enough to play but not to finish. I've gone back for the earlier ones but none of them grab you the way the later ones do, IMHO. They're still great, and as relics of history they are important developments, they just don't get you swept up as much as the later titles.  FFVII has the fanboys for a reason. I worked in industry and everyone just cloned it for 3 years. It has the best characters and writing, and excellent use of music, cinematography and atmosphere for mood. VIII I thought had the best art direction but the more you played the harder it got - you could actually level yourself into being unable to advance. IX was pretty cartoony which was stylistically a turn-off but was a solid game in every regard. I liked everything about X - except the gameplay. Too much wandering. Then I had a kid and became a filthy casual."
patientgamers,3a60aj,double_shadow,2,Wed Jun 17 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on if you have played any JRPG before (presumably not, since FF is the biggest series). I think that 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12 have something to offer the casual fan. Maybe start with 7 as its so iconic in gaming history. If you like 2d pixel art instead, 4 or 6 is better. If you want something more modern, try 10 or 12.  Personally,  I've gotten a bit tired of the genre, but most of the games are quite well done if you like the stories and gameplay."

patientgamers,3a60aj,Neuchacho,2,Wed Jun 17 18:35:35 2015 UTC,"You're definitely late to the party.  The better games - FF4, FF6, FF7, FF9 - haven't aged all that well.  It's hard to play Dragon Age or Bioshock and then crawl back into pixelated side-scroller or a game where even the FMVs look prehistoric.  That said, if you can reclaim your childhood and appreciate SNES/PS1 level graphics, the stories are fantastic.  If you're looking for an engrossing cell-phone game, FF1-6 are out as cell phone apps.  1, 3, and 4 even have a graphics upgrade that puts you into the PS2 era.  I've enjoyed every one I've played to date.  But if you're looking for a modern-day console game, I wouldn't waste time on the newer offerings.  FF13 was on rails and the plot was weak.  FF11 and FF14 are MMOs, so... not really an FF in my mind.  FF12 and FF10 were ok, but not the best Square had to offer.  If you want something more advanced than an SNES, you could get away with playing FF7, FF9, maybe FF8 if you've got a hankering, and then FF10/FF12.  Avoid the splats - Dirge of Cerberus, Chocobo Dungeon, Crystal Chronicles - except maybe Bravely Default, (which I'll admit I never played but got some very sold reviews).  If you like turn-based strategy games, FF-Tactics is a must-play after FF7, but Tactics-Advanced can be skipped.  I'd also strongly recommend the Kingdom Hearts series - particularly after you work your way through FF7,8, and 10 - as it brings an action-adventure flavor while keeping the epic themes of the original series.  I definitely think it's a worthwhile investment if you enjoy vintage games.  The early stuff was absolutely the cream of the RPG crop during the 80s and 90s.  The later stuff (minus Kingdom Hearts, which is stellar) not as great, but still enjoyable."

patientgamers,3a60aj,destroyermaker,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:53:12 2015 UTC,"Something that not a lot of folks are talking about is the dev teams that went into each.  The original dev team left when Square and Enix merged; the last game with any of the original dev team on it was 11, and that was an MMO, so really, so far as single-player Final Fantasies go, they take a hard left turn starting with X (10). Even in 10, you start to see the departure from the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, so I'd recommend that if you're going to play one for educational purposes or gateway into FF ""lore"", it should be a game prior to X.  Also, it kind of depends on how mature you are in the stories you prefer. 8 and 9 are full of teen love tropes, and while they were popular for most of us when we were younger, I went back and played 8 recently and found myself facepalming a few times, and I was never a big fan of 9 as a whole (has the best female character and antagonist in any Final Fantasy, period, but that doesn't save the game).  6 has a more mature story that will hold up to time and age while still being a Final Fantasy, but 7 isn't far behind, and its graphics blow it out of the water. That said, take 7 as a standalone package. Squeenix didn't do it any favors by cashing in on its likenesses and releasing bad movies and spinoff games that favor the image that Japanese games in general have taken (fast pace and fabulous hair).  Tactics is by and large favored by everyone who's played it, but since it lacks a number, there are many people who haven't. I'd still say it's a safe bet, and it has all of the tropes of a great Final Fantasy game, so why not?  As for the newer ones (post X), you'll have to go on someone else's opinion. I'm biased; I hate the direction Square Enix took the franchise when they took over, and since none of the developers of the games I enjoyed are on the dev teams, I don't even regard them as Final Fantasy games."

A lot of people don't like it but they have bad taste. 9: oldschool FF with (then) modern graphics. 10: annoying as shit main character but stuffed with delicious content.  Wait for the FF7 remake.

The story is immersive, the gameplay is varied and immersive, the atmosphere is awesome.   Bioshock 2 isn't as good, but Bioshock Infinite is also amazing. BS2 is solid, and worth it for a fun time, but it falls well short of the original, in my opinion. Infinite is MUCH better, and well-worth your time, a truly worthy successor to the original.   The Bioshock games nail all the technical aspect of game design, while never lacking in the most important aspect: fun. These games are a lot of fun."

It is the worst Bioshock in my opinion, and a technical step backwards compared to 1 and 2. Again, this is just my opinion. But things like only being able to carry two guns at once instead of a whole aresenal bothered me.  And how after a while, it felt like all you were doing was going from Point A to Point B, stocking up on ammo, and fighting a horde of villains. Then moving on to Point C. Where as in Bioshock 1 and 2, you explored massive, open areas full of random, re spawning bad guys.   Also the story was cool but became pretty stupid by the end, and this is from someone who absolutely loves those kinds of things/endings, but to each their own. The City in the Clouds could have been so much cooler than Rapture, but instead you're just hoping around and sliding on rails, which sounds cool, but gets old.  Bioshock Infinite is more like playing a movie than playing a game."

The game was beautiful at times (mostly in the beginning), Elizabeth was an interesting companion (or should have been, the concept was interesting, but she mostly threw ammo/coins and acted like something out of a Disney movie), the Luteces were really great as I saw it and easily my favorite part of the game.  I just couldn't stand the actual gameplay (the enemies in particular felt incredibly boring. They mostly popped up from weird angles and all combat felt incredibly stale with all the rushing at you an weapons that didn't keep it interesting) and the story got turned into something that demanded hour long theoretic explanations over at YouTube (probably an achievement in itself).

patientgamers,3a5xi4,IamtheSlothKing,10,Wed Jun 17 22:46:20 2015 UTC,I'll be the voice of dissent - I didn't like it.  The setting is unique. Rapture is amazing to discover. No complaints there.  But the gameplay itself is meh. I never got excited towards a fight or had to do much thinking. I beat the final boss ludicrously easily. There wasn't much exciting about it. Plasmids are cool when you get then but lose their usefulness very quickly.  The only truly amazing thing about it is a certain plot twist - which is completely betrayed by a lackluster ending.  A bit of game advice - going the evil route isn't worth it.
patientgamers,3a5xi4,pitaenigma,2,Wed Jun 17 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"agree on everything. The setting, voice acting, and the sheer originality is amazing in Bioshock, however, the gameplay and implementation is not the best, i got bored a lot, had to look out too much for my ammo, it just didnt sit right with me"
patientgamers,3a5xi4,JaTaS,3,Wed Jun 17 19:31:51 2015 UTC,Once I realized how scarce ammo is I stopped using it. Wrench only. If I die it doesn't matter I respawn and continue using my wrench. Only takes about twenty tries to kill a Big Daddy. Less if it's a Rosie and I have telekenesis
patientgamers,3a5xi4,pitaenigma,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:35:34 2015 UTC,"This. I started the game on hard, scavenged every corner and killed everything for 3hours. At that point I was completely bored of killing big daddys, they took way too much amunition.  So I switched to easy and tried to finish the game more quickly.. unfortunately it was sometimes a maze and I couldn't find something quick enough for my taste. Hm. But I liked rapture."
patientgamers,3a5xi4,Simpfally,5,Wed Jun 17 23:19:50 2015 UTC,If you bought it on Steam it would've been cheaper to buy the whole series in the triple pack than to buy them all individually.

patientgamers,3a5xi4,Ikinhaszkarmakplx2,4,Wed Jun 17 16:03:12 2015 UTC,"Bioshock 1 was incredibly over-rated and got boring once you realized there's no cost to dying (which kills any tension the atmosphere tries to create) and much of the powers you get are ultimately meaningless, you just try new shit out to keep from being bored with the game.   They even threw a medical station in with the end boss, so it's difficult to walk away not having beat the game (even on hard). Sure the story was interesting but gameplay wise it's only slightly more advanced (and slightly more difficult) than a tell tale point and click adventure game."
patientgamers,3a5xi4,Gr8NonSequitur,3,Wed Jun 17 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the respawn mechanic was completely game breaking.  I found myself dying intentionally because it was easier to respawn than walk back across the map.  Any enemy could be wrenched to death if you were willing to die 10 times in the process."
patientgamers,3a5xi4,jakdak,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:27:02 2015 UTC,wait there's no cost of dying?  I played like 3-4hours on hardest and never continued to play after dieing..(took an older save and started again) Holy cow I'm stupid.
patientgamers,3a5xi4,Simpfally,2,Wed Jun 17 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"you come back in a vita chamber with half health and half mana and they aren't very far apart so sometimes it's even more beneficial to die. After I beat it on hard and got all 1000 pts they added an achievement that you got if you completed the game without dying, but I was bored through half of the game so I never bothered to go back."
patientgamers,3a5xi4,Gr8NonSequitur,3,Thu Jun 18 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"It's fun and worth playing. It's very polished. It is primarily a FPS. It has some RPG elements like a simplified skill system and choice of spells. Its story is good, but the main character's story is really just an excuse to guide you through the wonderful setting, the broken-down underwater metropolis from the golden age of post-WW1 opulence and visionary capitalist idealism.  IMO patient gaming is about cherry-picking the classics - ignoring the hype around new releases that often conceals bad games - and Bioshock is a classic.  You may not enjoy it so I would suggest not buying the sequels until you play the first one to know whether you like it. All three games are on sale on Steam for 85% off for the next 85 minutes, which is a great deal, but that's still $14 you may be throwing into the wind if you don't like them. They will probably come back on sale on the last day of Steam sales, but maybe they won't. The Bioshock games are often on sale elsewhere.  It's worth pointing out that the two DLC campaigns for Bioshock Infinite are meant to be quite important for tying up the game's plot (I haven't played them yet myself so don't take this as an endorsement) and they are not included in the Triple Pack bundle. The Bioshock Infinite season pass is on sale separately for 50% off ($15), also for the next 85 minutes."
patientgamers,3a5xi4,01111000marksthespot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"I played the BioShock 2 and a bit of BioShock (1).  BioShock 2 improved upon BioShock (1), especially in game play and mechanics, such as duel wielding and protecting the Little Sisters' as they gather ADAM (I found that fun).  I liked BioShock (1)'s story and how it built the universe but I love BioShock 2's story and how it further expands upon the BioShock universe.  I haven't finished BioShock 2 (my PS+ subscription ran out =( ) but so far and what I've watched/read, I viewed BioShock 2 as a hunt (for a specific Little Sister) and as a tragedy (this is not very spoilerish).  Also, you get to play as a Big Daddy."

I got maybe halfway through the game but didn't see it to the end - not because I wasn't enjoying it, but there were other priorities at the time.  I liked what I played.  I skipped Bioshock 2 due to hearing mixed reviews on it, plus I had no interest in anything related to the multiplayer.  It sounded like it was more of the same and didn't really add much new to the mix.  I got Bioshock Infinite + its DLC during a Steam sale last year and absolutely loved it.  I really enjoyed the gameplay and the atmosphere was really nice to view.  The DLC was a great addition and a nice throwback of sorts to the other titles.  Burial at Sea ep. 2 actually got me queasy - it probably wasn't a good idea to be starving and light-headed during some of the darker moments of that DLC.  I'd suggest playing through the first and third entries, since those are what I played and I like them both.  Just my two cents!"

patientgamers,3a5xi4,IamtheSlothKing,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"Tips you might not hear from others:   Stealth melee is a very fun way to play this game when you fully increase your effectiveness with it.   Target Dummy is underrated and is a great way to draw out and distract enemies while you run up behind them and whack 'em.   The easiest way to beat Big Daddy is by getting drones to attack it, or another hypnotized Big Daddy.  If you focus on trapping enemies instead of taking them head on you will find the game to be a blast. I discourage playing it like a standard FPS."
patientgamers,3a5xi4,tearlock,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"Bioshock is one of the benchmark games for an immersive environment and great storytelling in gaming.  People will tell you that it suffers in the controls (it's not the buttery smooth FPS experience that a CoD or BF is) but you adapt fairly quickly.  And in all honesty, having super smooth combat would make the experience lesser.  You are supposed to struggle in these games.  It took me a while to realize that it's part of what makes the experience so immersive.    My best advice is to not rush through the game.  Listen to the audiologs, explore and soak in the detail.  And when you're done, would you kindly return and report what kind of experience you had?"
patientgamers,3a5xi4,allbeefpatties,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:41:01 2015 UTC,"Bioshock 1 was awesome. It looked GREAT on it's unreal engine and was an eye feast. Still looks great today.  It was a lot more inspired by System Shock 2 then the others but the story was on par with a nice twist.  Bioshock 2 on the other hand i never bothered finishing. It lacked a lot of the feal of the first game.  Bioshock Infinite i was somewhat disappointed. The story was a mess and the combat was repetitive as hell. Sure it looked good, but you can see it was ""GO into this area, loot everything, clear enemies that you JUST cleared 5 min ago on your way back and rinse repeat.  Still, great looking game."
patientgamers,3a5xi4,1leggeddog,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:48:00 2015 UTC,"bioshock 1 is amazing. great atmosphere. very clever game play with the powers you get. I will go back and platinum it at some point. and the intro transitioning into when you take over was, at the time, crazy. like you don't think you're in control and suddenly you can just go. the big daddy fights are terrifying. just so fucking good. my wife still hates the game because she thinks it was so creepy. she's not a gamer really, but it made a huge impact on her.      i haven't played infinite or 2 yet, but i'm going to play them    also, rapture is such an incredible world. i'd be happy to play bioshock even if it was just exploring rapture and doing a photo safari type thing."

patientgamers,3a5xi4,BabyRager,0,Thu Jun 18 10:08:51 2015 UTC,"Bioshock is an essential experience. It really is a must-play, and if you never do, then you're missing out on an atmospheric game with a unique setting, dark story, and beautiful art direction.  That said, the game is also VERY overrated. There is very little motivation to actually stay alive, because you aren't really punished for getting yourself killed. A lot of the tension the game tried to create through its action ends up getting undermined by the ubiquitous presence of Vita Chambers that instantly revive you, and there's no adequate explanation for why nobody else in the game is able to use them. The balance of the game is completely tilted in favor of the player, and since death has no teeth, the difficulty settings have no meaning, and it almost ruins the game.  The setting and characters, thank God, are fascinating, and that alone is enough to drive you through the experience. Visually, the game has aged very well because of its unique art direction and impressive water effects, so the compelling plot is wrapped up in an impressive spectacle as well. It's just held back a bit by some boneheaded game design, which kinda eliminates a lot of the replay value it could have had.  Even with its significant faults, it still is a must-play, because of the outstanding story, and a truly unforgettable setting and aesthetic. It isn't the best game ever, and frankly, it's not even close, but it is one of the most imaginative. Replaying it isn't very much fun, and yet, paradoxically, you will have amazing memories of this game, and the promise of those memories is easily worth the price of admission. Especially since the game was on sale. tldr: you made a good purchase."

The whole thing was still wrapped in plastic. (No, I don't do frequent visits to the recycling plant, I know someone who works there.)  What I really want to do is go dumpster diving at Gamestop, especially now that they're getting rid of last-gen consoles. There are a few issues though: 1) I don't know when they throw stuff away 2) I heard that Gamestop purposely destroys merchandise that they're going to throw away so that people don't turn around and sell it for a profit.

The game uses a Japanese control scheme. The Playstation controller was designed with the Japanese in mind. For them, X means incorrect/cancel, circle means correct/affirm, square means menu, and triangle means...something else. If you think about it that way, it's a little easier to navigate the menu. (I have to keep this in mind whenever I pop onto my Japanese PSN account to check out what demos they have available.)"
patientgamers,3a6ail,GospelX,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"yeah. it's just so natural the way i hold the controller that my thumb jumps to the X. the lack of stick support is also hard to go back to. d-pad is just so imprecise. i find myself yelling at snake because i'm off by a bit when trying to grab. it's a great time capsule of what games were like in the mid 90s, but man i'm glad we've progressed since then."
patientgamers,3a6ail,beboppin_n_scottin,2,Wed Jun 17 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"I was a Nintendo kid back then, so I didn't get to experience quite that level of frustration with 3D games in the mid-90's. The N64 analog stick was exactly what was needed, which is why Sony went out of its way to develop what is perhaps the best controller ever in the Dualshock family of controllers.  Keep at the game, though. It's worth it overall. If you get tired of it, I'd recommend getting a hold of a GameCube or Wii and picking up Twin Snakes."
patientgamers,3a6ail,OptionalCookie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:28:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the meaning of the triangle, but it's inclusion may just be as a clearly identifiable symbol, other major shape, as a hat for the top of the set of buttons or because:   Circle = 1 line Cross = 2 lines Triangle = 3 lines Square = 4 lines"
patientgamers,3a6ail,WookieFragger,2,Thu Jun 18 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"Sony designer Teiyu Goto says, ""The triangle refers to viewpoint; I had it represent oneâs head or direction and made it green."""
patientgamers,3a6ail,WookieFragger,4,Fri Jun 19 02:15:52 2015 UTC,"Ironically while the first MGS felt incredibly dated by the time 2 and 3 came out, nowadays I think it's the one that's aged the best. It's a lot simpler than the ones that came after and doesn't bog things down with a lot of the added convolution of the later entries' controls and systems.   While I thought the first person aiming and such of MGS2 was an amazing addition in 2001, nowadays I find myself just finding it tiring to go through the awkward controls of it for optimal combat. In that respect MGS1's gameplay is essentially 2D, and works out a lot better for it these days.   Enemies disappear, so bodies aren't a concern; no fine-tuning for headshots, since the combat is entirely based on the top-down view; things are just a lot simpler and snappier, so I still find it the best one to go back to. It's also before the series nosedived into insanity, so as a standalone story it's also satisfying in that respect too."

This game can be hard. If you have arthritis, I suggest using a trainer/something.   You can effectively skip 2 without any loss in the story or plot. You hear a lot of people say this series is hard: you can finish 2 without finesse or style.   DMC3 is again, very difficult, but it should be the second game you play, not the first.   DMC4, yes, has a remaster coming out, but it is a graphical remaster, and not a storyline remaster.  And then you play DmC. I have been a fan of the series since 2001, and the series was going downhill already after 2, 3, and 4. Three and four were great, but they will never match the first.

NWN felt closer to Diablo than a DnD game - very much a hack-n-slash plus you only control one character at a time (with an AI henchman).  Oblivion/Morrowind are loved by many but feel too.... empty by modern standards. Good stories but if you like towns and villages to actually feel inhabited, then look elsewhere.  I always get bored with Icewind Dale before getting more than halfway through. There's way more combat than in the BG games which is a shame (though possibly a bonus if that's your bag)."

patientgamers,3a75lr,nebachadnezzar,2,Thu Jun 18 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"Although great at the time I'd skip the first one. When playing Hitman 2:SA you will get the feeling anyway what it's like. If you struggle too much with SA then jump right to Contracts. From there one you are in for a great time right through the end of Blood Money.   After that comes...well..a game called Hitman that got influenced pretty heavy by alle those third-person cover shooters. You can still go ultra hardcore in Absolution, but something will always feel off. No to mention the loading times within a level. The previous games definitely felt bigger, although less detailed."

patientgamers,3a4g1o,randomusername_815,13,Wed Jun 17 03:49:23 2015 UTC,"Far Cry 2 is not a game you play for narrative, it's there, it exists, the plot of finding The Jackal is the driving point, but it's not what you play the game for. I think most of the negative reaction comes from wanting to play the game like a standard campaign from mission to mission. In truth, it's a game that is entirely about the moment to moment. It's all about the encounters and the sandbox at play and the craziness that can spring up from all the disparate systems at work.  I would say the game develops characters you care about -- but not in the narrative sense at all. I found the buddy system in the game allowed for a completely organic sense of attachment to an AI companion, but if you're looking for narrative and dialogue trees and anything like that, this is not the game for that."
patientgamers,3a4g1o,beboppin_n_scottin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:35:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the breakdown.  With new games it probably helps to get your expectations in line early on.
patientgamers,3a4g1o,Alex__V,9,Wed Jun 17 11:19:16 2015 UTC,"In contrast to the other posts, I think the narrative in Far Cry 2 is absolutely brilliant. Not just that a lot of it is systemic so that you have to improvise as you go along - that goes for every mission as well as every open-world encounter. I think the buddy system in it is outstanding and a complete one-off in gaming.  Also, and I think this is spoiler free, there's a serious setting to the game that carries real weight. This is a chaotic African region, being exploited for its diamonds and resources, in which we play a murderous mercenary tracking down other murderous mercenaries. It's a Heart of Darkness tale, much more weighty and thoughtful and troubling than the other Far Crys imo."

patientgamers,3a4g1o,lacsativ,4,Wed Jun 17 11:12:49 2015 UTC,"We're talking about Far Cry and the term ""Open World COD"" that OP coined. I think it's fair to include Far Cry 3 in the discussion, since I find the definition fits 3 better than 2.  I don't see a problem here."
patientgamers,3a4g1o,Myrandall,0,Wed Jun 17 11:17:36 2015 UTC,"Here's the difference - What made FC3 'more than COD' was how much more there was to do other than shooting - climbing radio towers, hunting animals to craft gear, piloting boats and quad bikes through race courses, there was a friendly faction so not everyone who's path you crossed wanted to kill you, hang gliding, hunting sharks underwater.  FC2 is all killing without dialog options with NPCs.  That's all I mean by 'open world cod.'"

patientgamers,3a4g1o,donwallo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:17:39 2015 UTC,Just a recommendation for when you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl. Play it with the Stalker Complete Mod. It's a far better game with the mod than without it (just for the bugs/glitches it fixes alone never mind all the prettiness etc).

patientgamers,3a4g1o,Strazdas1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:03:25 2015 UTC,"The bug fixes are due to the ZRP which Complete includes. The purists all seem to hate Complete for making the game easier across the board, as the changelog confirms.  I only played without it so I can't say whether it's better or worse. But I do think it's endorsed too automatically especially considering that the bug fixes are from an independent (and now more current) mod. If Complete is ""mandatory"" due to bug-fixes then it's not mandatory at all.  Also the Absolute texture packages are good and supposedly more conservative."
patientgamers,3a4g1o,PerfectPlan,3,Wed Jun 17 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yes there is more.  It's actually ""Open World COD: Zombies"" because the enemies keep respawning for some reason.  Kidding aside, you have to understand that FC2 came out in a very different time and the Open Sandbox FPS formula had only ever been done with Deus Ex and a few scifi series.  It wasn't yet the completely common and cloneable genre you know today.  So no, it doesn't go beyond doing what you've already been doing but that doesn't mean it's boring.  It just means it doesn't appeal to you."

FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.  It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it.

patientgamers,3a2gd1,PM_NUDES_AND_TREES,10,Tue Jun 16 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"I would recommend playing it 100% stealth on your first run simply because the tension and environment of Dishonored are spot-on. The game should be hard when you play it like that. Once you've completed that, play again except this time kill everyone you see and use all those cool powers that you had to avoid the first time.  My second run took me about 20% of the time of the first and this way I didn't miss any cool environmental or narrative bits, and still got to use the murderous powers to their full extent because I knew the nooks and crannies.  Easily one of my favorite games in the genre, coming from a guy who has been playing them since Thief: The Dark Project. Can't wait for the next entry (but I will, because that's what we do)."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,BaneJammin,2,Tue Jun 16 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, Ghost is my first playthrough and it's making it hard already even though it's on a normal difficulty."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,BaneJammin,5,Tue Jun 16 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"If you get stuck, try backtracking and looking for a different route. There is almost always more than one way to get inside/around a building or obstacle, especially if you get the shapeshifting powers. I would also recommend upgrading Blink as soon as possible, it will be your best friend in a Ghost playthrough."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,what_comes_after_q,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:24:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't plan on using any of the other upgrades.
patientgamers,3a2gd1,Gunslinger_,9,Tue Jun 16 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"Enjoyed it far more on pc. Did a stealth play through first, and on PS3 the constant reloading and lack of quick save killed it for me. On thr PC, one of my favorite games."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,mister_gone,16,Tue Jun 16 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"You say you are going for Ghost on your first playthrough, does this mean you are planning to do more than one? If so, I highly recommend doing Ghost second. First, there is a lot of fun to be had with offensive powers, killing lots of guards. Second, if you clear an area, you can explore it to plan your Ghost playthrough. It is difficult to do if you don't know what's coming next."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,The_Sodomiser,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is I plan on going for multiple plays and Own the base game. However, I will pick up the GOTY for $12 and have that as well.   I, for sure, will play all ways to fully experience the game. I r really don't want to give up this time."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,zypsilon,3,Tue Jun 16 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"I went for ghost (and the associated achieves that require no kill/no alert). Save a LOT if you're doing it. That way, when you get pissed, you can go on a killing rampage like /u/gunslinger_ then go back to your last save and try again.  Ninja edit. /u/what_comes_after_q mentioned no quick save on PS3. If that's true ... wow, fuck that shit."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,Devieus,2,Tue Jun 16 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"There's no ""quick"" save per se, but you can save the game at any point on the ps3. I think it just counts as a regular save"
patientgamers,3a2gd1,zypsilon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:04:53 2015 UTC,Another player here looking forward to go through his backlog. What does Ghosting mean exactly? Simply not killing anyone or even making sure you're not noticed by anyone?
patientgamers,3a2gd1,Gunslinger_,2,Wed Jun 17 13:08:28 2015 UTC,Both.
patientgamers,3a2gd1,zypsilon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:24:28 2015 UTC,What about making the enemy unconscious somehow and dispose of the body?
patientgamers,3a2gd1,TholomewP,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"Knocking out an enemy doesn't void the achivement, but in Dishonored there are many spots where an unconscious body can accidentally fall off a ledge or into water, which will then count as a kill. And you usually don't even know this happened until the stats at the end of the level, which means you have to redo the entire level (there are only 9 long levels in the game, IIRC). So you have to be very careful with bodies."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,SharkFighter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:07:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I hope I'll recognize if that danger is at hand when I place the body? I mean, say if I place it on a ledge next to water and it doesn't move, all things should be fine?"

patientgamers,3a2gd1,PercivalJBonertonIV,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:24:07 2015 UTC,Does the DLC go on sale for PSN or should I just get the GOTY for $11.
patientgamers,3a2gd1,SpookyLlama,2,Tue Jun 16 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"Can't comment on the PSN, I played on Steam, but the DLCs are all great / worth buying"
patientgamers,3a2gd1,BadWhippet,3,Tue Jun 16 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"I always used to checkpoint reset in those types of games when I was caught, but I found half the fun of the game is evading guards once you are caught, and figuring out the best way to deal with them. Don't save scum!"
patientgamers,3a2gd1,arantius,3,Tue Jun 16 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"Pro tip: The guards don't look up (though a few may still be stationed above you on roofs and balconies).  And I should say try to avoid relying on the stop time power too much, it really takes a lot of fun out of the game. I'm speaking from experience; I got really bored near the end of my first ghost playthrough because I just froze time and ran through everything.  But when I went back to the game a few weeks later for the ""Don't upgrade your powers"" achievement I had much more fun with it, getting by on my own ability and using items in real time."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,JFKcaper,3,Tue Jun 16 23:43:14 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely an aggressive Corvo the first time round, learn parts of the map and then use everything to your advantage once you go for ghost. You'll need it."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,theecakee,3,Tue Jun 16 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"I love playing by stealth best, but it's criminal not being able to play with all those terrible gadgets.  But in fact you can without jeopardising a 'low chaos' run-through.  You can safely hack all the devices to kill off enemies and merit the 'low chaos' game and ending (just avoid killing too many people by hand and you'll be fine).  Warning: I'm not sure this is a good thing to do when gunning for the 'Ghost' achievement, but it's viable for low chaos endings.  For a high-chaos game, you have to get your hands bloodied a fair bit more!"
patientgamers,3a2gd1,Beesem,3,Wed Jun 17 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"Just finished this myself this past weekend, also on Normal.  Wonderful game.  No deaths/no alarms is tough, but doable."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,RisingRapture,4,Wed Jun 17 01:38:37 2015 UTC,"Most of the people I know that have played it (including me) tried to sneak around until they eventually got bored and a) quit or b) realized that they got interested in the game because of all the fun ways you can kill people in.  Just something to note, have fun!"
patientgamers,3a2gd1,ForRealsies,3,Tue Jun 16 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I may end up getting tired of it but so far I haven't. Just a bit of thinking before I make moves which seems a bit nice.   I am willing to try multiple plays to see the outcomes."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,Myrandall,2,Tue Jun 16 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"That game is so much fun, best stealth game I've ever played. I also went for ghost on my first and only play through...I don't think it would be fun otherwise."
patientgamers,3a2gd1,ForRealsies,2,Wed Jun 17 06:47:04 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved Dishonored, and just now picked up the DLC on the steam sale. My first play through wasn't pure ghost. I used stealth as much as possible, but killed when I got caught or found an area too tough to sneak through. I guess it was more of a low-chaos play than anything. Really enjoyable, I got a bit of the stealth and a bit of the violence. It really kept things fresh for me!"
patientgamers,3a2gd1,jhuynh405,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:31:30 2015 UTC,I'm about to finish Crysis 3 and will start Dishonored then as well. Feel I should get some of these short FPS-like games off my backlog before beginning another huge RPG like Witcher 2.
patientgamers,3a2gd1,TarsierBoy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:12:11 2015 UTC,I went from Hitman Absolution straight to Dishonored. Felt like I went back 10 years in terms of polish and controls.
patientgamers,3a46am,Lacriphage,3,Wed Jun 17 02:20:53 2015 UTC,"If you can get used to the control system, its a really rewarding game.  You have to accept the camera angles it gives you, get lost in the narrative and focus on the cinematic experience.  There are also point-of-no-return choices/actions that tempt you to replay it for a different experience a 2nd time.  Its definitely something different!"
patientgamers,3a46am,randomusername_815,2,Wed Jun 17 04:10:53 2015 UTC,I've gotten a little further in and I'm starting to enjoy it.   I am a terrible father though.
patientgamers,3a46am,Prah2013,3,Wed Jun 17 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"I also recommend Beyond: Two Souls, which are from the same developers!"
patientgamers,3a46am,yottamoto,2,Wed Jun 17 11:14:24 2015 UTC,I think that's the first time I've read someone recommending that game.
patientgamers,3a46am,Prah2013,2,Wed Jun 17 11:48:41 2015 UTC,I suppose I am that kind of person who enjoys and recommends games that no one else does.
patientgamers,3a46am,01314150,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"I was surprised to see it has a 8.1 userscore on Metacritic. Out of 2474 votes, that's some level of recommendation, right? (Heavy Rain sits at 7.6 voted by a similar amount of people)  I think I gave it 5/10. It has a ridiculously high production value. It's long. It's built up like a proper dramatic story."
patientgamers,3a46am,rgobtnk,2,Wed Jun 17 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"It's a very good experience! If you have a chance to grab a Move set (Move, NavCon, and Camera) it makes the game 1000x more enjoyable! All three can be grabbed for fairly cheap these days (but you won't get much use out of them lol)"
patientgamers,3a46am,theecakee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:53:39 2015 UTC,Yea it's kind of sad.   I tried the move set in a store once and it seemed way more responsive than the Wii but they never did anything with it.

POE is the best choice, it's a blend of all the oldschool rpg's with modern graphics and a modern ui, definitely pick POE first."
patientgamers,3a3wr7,Red-Blue-,2,Wed Jun 17 01:22:21 2015 UTC,Here's a toplist made by a quite oldschool community IIRC:  http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=9453
patientgamers,3a3wr7,zypsilon,2,Wed Jun 17 13:13:01 2015 UTC,"Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. Not finished either, but Baldur's Gate is often rated as one of the best in the genre and II is on sale on Steam atm. From what I've played of Baldur's Gate it's fantastic, though. You're best off going into it taking it slow, and reading up on the rules before tackling it, though, but it's worth it IMO.  http://store.steampowered.com/app/257350/  Icewind Dale is too:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/321800/?snr=1_5_9__300  Sword Coast: Legends is also coming soon (Sept 8)  http://store.steampowered.com/app/325600/"
patientgamers,3a3wr7,snowbell55,0,Wed Jun 17 01:30:26 2015 UTC,Second baldur's gate. A bonus of the enhanced editions is cross-device play.

I spent way too much time on Wizardry 7 On Steam for $1.24 But I guess you could go for the more modern equivalent Legend of Grimrock. I also have fond memories of making my own maps for Eye of the Beholder II free! As other people have mentioned tho, +1 for Baldurs Gate and PlaneScape. Oh and special mention to Neverwinter Nights - personally never really got on with NWN2, but loved the first one.    EDIT: Sorry, just reread question. The first few aren't really akin to Divinity, but are old-school RPGs. NWN might still appeal."

patientgamers,3a3wr7,Omega_Grey,2,Thu Jun 18 08:05:41 2015 UTC,"I never played 6, so I wouldn't know. I think I played through 7 twice, but that was like 20 years ago (christ I'm old). Perhaps it is just nostalgia... But then I did play through a large chunk of 8 about 4 years ago... Game play still wins over graphics. The question is, ""are you enjoying it?"" If so, then carry on. But with the choice of words ""slogging it"" perhaps you aren't."
patientgamers,3a3wr7,Obnubilate,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:36:29 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the combat and the puzzles, but the exploration is driving me insane. I think I'll start 7 and see how that goes and decide if I want to carry through with 6. It's funny, I just recently beat Wizardry 1 on NES and had a blast, that's what inspired me to play 6, but 6 is just failing to captivate me."
patientgamers,3a3wr7,Omega_Grey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:39:30 2015 UTC,"/r/rpg_gamers would likely have better answers for you.  But you are missing some absolute classics-  anything from the isometric golden age (Baldurs Gate II, Planescape, Icewind Dale), Morrowind, Mass Effect, Star Wars KOTR, Gothic, Jade Empire, Two Worlds, or the original Witcher.  Divinity (at least the earlier ones, haven't played Original Sin) were more ""Action RPGs"".  Of those you might want to check out Diablo, Torchlight, Dungeon Siege, or maybe Titan Quest."

patientgamers,3a3wr7,jnkangel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:05:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the advice and help! It is sincerely appreciated. I've had quite of the few mentioned in my library or a while so I think I'll probably do some order of PoE, Torment, and BG2.   I have one more question which is what kind of class do you recommend starting out with? I'll give you an example. In most rpgs I play as a rogue because I enjoy sneaking/stealing/backstabbing and the like but in Divinity my girlfriend has been supremely more useful as a mage for the entirety of the game. So I guess my question boils down to is there a type of class in these old games that are more useful to beginners than the rest or is it based on playstyle?"
patientgamers,3a3wr7,Batolemaeus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"In Torment, max out WIS, then INT. You will miss lots of amazing writing otherwise.  In POE, it doesn't matter.  In BG2, wizards are extremely fragile in the beginning and probably too hard at first. Running around in ancient D&D with 4hp is a nightmare."

patientgamers,3a3wr7,philius_fog,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:56:24 2015 UTC,"Fallout 2 was what made me truly love RPGs. I've played that game so many times I can't count and I still do to this day.   You probably know the fallout world because of it's reboot. It's marvelous and as an avid fan of the series I damn near cried when they rebooted it. But for me, the true heart of the game still lies in 2.   It's vast, not just in terms of actual playable area but also in terms of content. It's so jam packed with dialogue that you could spend hours just having conversations with people.   It's funny too. There's a dry humour that permeates the world is superb. The little changes in dialogue depending on your intelligence level and skills and perks are great. The perks alone are somewhat tongue in cheek.    It's long. Playing the story line (especially if you want to help everyone as I usually find myself doing in good RPGs) takes a lot of time and there are so many side quests available to you that it can spend hours just focusing on them.   It's hard. Learning to quicksave might be the best lesson I can give you before playing this. The game is a little unforgiving to people who aren't cautious.   Levelling is a joy. I remember longing for the next level pretty much constantly. Picking your own skill set is important and there are so many to choose from. There are perks that dramatically change the way the game is played out for you. There are missions that allow you to manipulate your base stats so you become harder, meaner and smarter.   I could go on but the best way to really understand is to go and play it right now.   n.b. If you play it go and get the Fallout 2 Restoration Project. It's a fan made patch that fixes all that is wrong with the game bug wise and finishes a load of content that was left out."

patientgamers,3a3wr7,BabyRager,2,Wed Jun 17 02:50:30 2015 UTC,DA:O is great. I still replay it at least once a year.
patientgamers,3a1d1y,AnghellicKarma,19,Tue Jun 16 13:41:17 2015 UTC,"Just to add my two cents (and probably gather a bunch of downvotes in the process) those games did not age well. Like, at all. Be prepared for terrible/unintuitive controls, boring minigames (book carrying job on the second game, JESUS CHRIST who thought that would be fun), cringe inducing voice acting... It was all groundbreaking at the time, but now it's borderline unplayable.  Fake edit: and to answer your question, emulators are probably the way to go if you want to suffer through those games."
patientgamers,3a1d1y,LackOfLogic,11,Tue Jun 16 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on your tastes and expectations. I played both 1 and 2 for the first time between 2005 and 2010 (can't remember the exact year for each game) and loved them to death , but maybe that's because I managed to really get into the story and ambience, and was prepared for some quirkiness, so was able to tolerate the more repetitive and irritating bits. It's all part of the experience, in my opinion. Shenmue wouldn't be Shenmue without forklift riding and book carrying."
patientgamers,3a1d1y,nebachadnezzar,2,Tue Jun 16 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way, there still isn't a world quite like that of Shenmue 1 and 2.  The story is still great and the fighting system is a lot of fun still"

I don't know if you're in the states, and if you are, your best bet is playing Shenmue 2 on the original Xbox because that game was not released in the states for the DC. However you could find a European version of Shenmue 2 online and burn it, because the DC plays burned games."

You would put the boot disc in first, then while it's running take it out and put the game disc in. Weirdly, the dreamcast would start making a noise and you had to hit it on the top to get it to start playing the game."

patientgamers,3a1d1y,cptstupendous,2,Tue Jun 16 19:19:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I know i'm late to the party, hopefully you're still subbed for the thread. First of all, don't hold out for an HD remake. Sega's hardly in the business of making console games anymore, especially the western market.  The best option is to play on a Dreamcast. You'd have to find one, but if I recall correctly, the copy protection is pretty shitty and you can get away with playing burnt copies of games. If you're interested, there's a modified version of Shenmue that some clever fans have made that replaces all the English voice acting with the original Japanese. You can find it at the ShenmueDojo.  The other option is to play on an emulator, which is less than perfect. You'll have to deal with some graphical glitches, but as far as I know it's playable start to finish. I've been able to get to disc 2 playing the Undub version on nullDC. You're going to have to do some wonky stuff to make the undub version work on an emulator, so if you decide to do that, you can send me a pm and I can send you some links."
patientgamers,3a1d1y,KnightofNightmares,4,Sat Jun 20 23:23:09 2015 UTC,I would guess that there would inevitably be a re-release of both games prior to the debut of Shenmue 3.

If it's huge, then I think it's worth putting off Talos Principle for a while if you can get it a lower price later. I, too, really want to get this game after seeing all the recommendations for it on reddit, but I know I won't play it for several months. Multiplayer-heavy games are the only ones I'd consider paying full price or close to full price. Most single player games I'll put under my wishlist until a better sale or desire to play comes around.  However, if you know you'll play this game in the next few months, then get it. It's still a great price for a great game.  edit: for example, I've never played the Portal games, which I've heard the Talos Principle is similar to. I'm likely to get the bundle towards the end of the Summer Sale for $7. That should help keep my puzzle urge satisfied until Talos Principle can go under $10 during a sale."

I usually think ""would I play this game right now if I owned it?"" Surprisingly often the answer is no.  The big change for me was Metro LL. Two weeks after I bought that game, a complete edition was released. And now you can even get the Redux version for cheaper and I still haven't played that game."

patientgamers,3a3hks,Suddenlyfoxes,5,Wed Jun 17 00:13:52 2015 UTC,"6 is the best of them IMO.  It's SNES-era 16-bit, though, so if graphics are important to you you'll want something either more recent or rereleased.  4 is probably the first ""modern"" FF game, with character-driven story, and there's an HD rerelease.  Not a bad place to start.  7 is very popular but also hasn't been rereleased (although one is coming).  It was PS1-era, so graphics are a bit better than 6, but still very ""spiky.""  9 was the last of the really good ones IMO."

patientgamers,3a3hks,MorganFreeman7,3,Wed Jun 17 03:15:57 2015 UTC,"9 is the best IMO.  After 9 I would probably pick 12, but I love them all too much to be picky :D"

patientgamers,3a3hks,Wimmsk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"The first nine are graphically horrible and outside of nostalgia hard to stomach.  Though one through six got nice remakes and are certainly worth it if you own a mobile system that can run them. I personally can't stand emulators, but that could be an alternative. I would consider six the best of the bunch, but you can't really make a mistake with any of them.  Seven through nine still have to get their remakes (if they actually do get them), and I would advise against them in the interim. Seven was groundbreaking for its time but is really dated and feels stale now; if you are a gamer you will get nothing fresh or surprising here today. We will have to see what the remake brings to the table, that might change it quite a bit (and I am certainly going to buy it, as I loved it back in the day, enjoy it with the existing and spectacular graphic mods even today, and can't wait to play it anew in its shiny new clothes).  Ten has aged quite well und has a friendly and non-hectic battle system. If graphics isn't everything I would recommend this one. It also lately got a remake that definitely makes it worth it.  Twelve hasn't aged well in my opinion and I would advise against it as an entry point to the series. It's an odd one and far too heavy influenced by MMOs at the time for my taste.  The three thirteens are quite well done. I would personally rate them behind 10 (with 13-3 the best, then 13-2, and then 13), but if graphics are important to you (nothing wrong with that) they would be the first ones to consider. Though I am personally not that happy with the direction the franchise has taken with 13 - a sentiment found quite often here and elsewhere - they are solid, modern, have few annoying game mechanics and take a lot of time to complete."
patientgamers,3a3hks,skoojaa,2,Wed Jun 17 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the advice, it seems like a complex franchise!  About the 13, are they independent or you should play the 13 first and then the 13-2? And since the 13-3 isn't on steam right now, it should still be worth to play the two firsts?"
patientgamers,3a3hks,porcupine-free,2,Wed Jun 17 10:08:50 2015 UTC,"The three 13s tell a continuous story arc, though the first one could stand on its own as well. You could jump right into the middle, but you would miss at least about half of what is happening if you do and always wonder who the hell those people actually are and why you should care. If you play them in the chronological order you will get the intended storyline, though you will still miss about half of the story, as a lot of background information was only officially released in Japan (but can be found in various wikis and websites nowadays).  13-1: Strictly linear gameplay, great classical battle systems, some great characters, some horrible ones. A few holes in the story arc, but not more than pretty much every game out there. No more linear than the other entries in the series, but due to its design it certainly feels far (by a huge margin!) more restrictive. You will have to read quite a bit of menu text entries ingame to understand the whole story. All in all a great example of the franchise's overall design.  13-2: Monster hunting and collecting. Both more varied and more restricted than you might imagine right now. As the first one was heavily critizised for being too linear, this one has done pretty much the opposite. Which felt far too fragmented in my opinion, but quite a lot of people loved it. It's the only entry in the franchise where I did not do absolutely everything that can be done, as I got quite bored in the end (YMMV). You will need to read quite a bit of additional (online) information to actually understand what the hell this is actually about.  13-3: Fantastic active real-time battle system. New Game+, tight storyline, epic battles. But the first time in the series you no longer have a party and fight mostly alone. Half of the things happening are never explained in the games themselves. While the time limit does not actually impact you (as soon as you understand the time mechanics you can easily finish everything in the first three days and have to sit on you thumbs for the rest), you probably will feel rushed the whole time - which was intended, but did not really fit into the FF series (imho).  Overall I would recommend either 10 or 13-1 as a starting point (the seven remake might take the top place; we will have to wait and see). Both are great games, both have their share of faults. Personally I prefer 10. You could jump directly to 13-2 or 13-3 and read the backstory somewhere else, but I would strongly advise against it; 13-1 has by far the most story and character development of the 13s."

It's got a great mix of sneakiness and action sequences, complete with a sweeping storyline that blends real-world conflicts, Japanese-style mysticism, and Deus Ex-worthy conspiracy theories.

The game supports various play styles, you aren't forced to play it as a stealth game, or a shooting game."

patientgamers,39zlfo,piclemaniscool,12,Tue Jun 16 04:27:58 2015 UTC,"Well they did PS3/Xbox for Final Fantasy 13 then waited 4 years to release it on PC, and and Lightning Returns isn't expected on PC until the end of this year.  It's possible that it'll see a console then PC release."
patientgamers,39zlfo,seifer93,7,Tue Jun 16 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"The company changed its stance completely since then. 2013 and focusing on console almost killed them. Since then they shifted tp digital, PC and mobile. Releases like FF13, FF7 on steam and Typ-0 HD are literally tests to see if they sell well on the PC market without running the risk that is behind a full game. As for the first two the sale numbers where very good so there is no reason to not port to PC in fact it would make sense with ports costing less then ever. Really why push FF7 to steam now if you want to ignore the PC market? You them to buy both fist the old to get hyped and then the new to fill your pocket."

patientgamers,39zlfo,ChatterBrained,7,Tue Jun 16 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"""first on PS4"" means exactly that, first. Its going to be released on Xbox and/or PC for sure. And looking at how ""exclusivity"" seems to work, its likely it would have been advertised as ""only on PS4"" and still got PC release, as PC seems to be not counted on exclusivity. If SCEJ/SCEA would not allow them to release on other platforms I would not see them doing this as it would cut into their sales making the venture not worthwhile, unless they would pay huge amounts for total exclusivity, which would make the venture competely worthless for SCEJ/SCEA. More likely they tried to pressure them to only release on PS4, but as Square did not budge they settled with timed exclusivity, nothing new."
patientgamers,39zlfo,Ragegar,8,Tue Jun 16 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy 7 is not owned, partially or otherwise, by Sony or any of its branches. It was published in the USA/CAN by SCEA on the PS1, but that's it. And for PC it was published by Eidos.  That's like saying EA partially owns FF8 - FF10, since for a while they were Squaresoft's North American publisher.  Hell, Nintendo of America was Squaresoft's NES/SNES publisher (and some of the current DS/3DS games), but they don't own Final Fantasy 1-3, Dragon Quest IX, TheatreRhythm, etc."

patientgamers,39zlfo,ObiWantKanabis,35,Tue Jun 16 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"Where to begin?  I'll do my best to explain.  Growing up with video games in the 90s (to say nothing of the 70s and 80s) was pretty abysmal in many regards.  Yes, there were the Zeldas, Metroids, Sonics that consistently created excellence, but for every one of those, there were dozens of borderline shovelware games.  ""Dozens?""  You say?  ""That's not that many.""  But back then there weren't that many games being released, so it was a lot of trash to wade through to find treasure.  You think AAA titles are bad now?  Back then they were a broken mess, a cobbled together experience with some sort of recognizable  intellectual property on it.  They were often riffs on arcade games -- brutal experiences designed to not only test the player with trial and error but twitch reflexes over a long span of time as well.  Battletoads is perhaps the most nefarious example of this, but that was a GOOD kind of brutal, because the combat was innovative and fun.  Many games just fell by the wayside because they were so terrible that they were just forgotten.  Now, keep in mind, most of the games were along the lines of side scrolling platform games, where the primary driving force behind playing it was to ""complete the level"".  I cannot even begin to guess at the number of games that used this method as a force to drive the game forward, but it was astronomically high in the 90s.  Even the Playstation's signature mascot used this approach (Crash Bandicoot).  The result was a lot of games that played the same, looked very similar to each other, but most importantly were shallow gameplay experiences with maybe a few lines of text per level, at most.  Beating the game meant you got a congratulations screen or in some cases a very basic ending cinematic where the good guys win, bad guys loose, yaaay.  It was during that timeframe that Final Fantasy 2 and 3 were released.  Square spent an incredible amount of time on them, obviously.  They were games that featured pretty decent graphics for the era (I still personally find FFVI(3) a gorgeous game), but more importantly, had the ability to really suck gamers in with a storyline that mattered.  Square, of course, wasn't the only RPG maker back in those days, but they were by far the most accomplished, and the most consistent.  They produced incredible games, even outside of the Final Fantasy series.  I remember reading a magazine poll that asked readers, ""Who is your most trusted game developer?""  There were 6 responses.  Square won 80% of the total vote.  No one else had over 10%.  That's the kind of fervor they were inspiring.  Square created games that told stories.  With characters you cared about.  With characters you fell in love with.  With bad guys you hated not just because they were between you and beating the game, but because they were your enemy and they were living breathing malevolent entities that were producing actual (in-game) suffering.  When the Playstation launched, it was the first bellwether to indicate that gaming was becoming much more than just a niche hobby for recluse teenagers and dropouts.  The entertainment industry was beginning to take notice, and Square realized that they had the potential to really make an impact.  So they invested heavily in FFVII.  $45,000,000 might not seem like a lot today, but it was virtually unheard of back then in gaming.  The first time I saw the trailer, I could not believe it.  I must have watched it 20 times the first day alone.  What Square created had never been done before -- a big budget RPG with the best graphics anyone had ever seen in gaming, and the Square name to match, so it was also going to have an amazing apocalyptic storyline (which was still novel back then, especially in gaming).  It was Christmas for gamers multiplied by 50.  Every single friend I had who played games wanted FFVII.  Nothing else even mattered.  Even today it's somewhat rare to see an RPG break standards for graphical and audio fidelity.  Back then it was absolute lunacy.  But it happened.  And frankly?  The game lived up to the hype.  It had a fantastic storyline, tons of different areas and games to play, and (seriously) the best graphics anyone had ever seen at that time.  I will never forget seeing the Leviathan summoned on the first trailer.  That wave, man.  That wave.  It's easy to look back with a hipster attitude and proclaim the game to be overrated.  But that's bullshit.  If you were alive and a gamer during that era, you were at least impressed by FFVII, if not clawing at your parent's wallets and purses to get it.  Not only was it a milestone for RPGs, it almost single-handedly won Sony the console war from that very day it launched.  Final Fantasy VII invented the concept of a console selling game, meaning a game that you would buy the console for to play, rather than the other way around.  It was a monumental milestone for gaming, and it was an absolutely fantastic RPG on top of it."
patientgamers,39zlfo,CryHav0c,6,Tue Jun 16 12:09:31 2015 UTC,"I read about the remake this morning and spent a moment bouncing up and down at the prospect of playing it with current gen graphics.

patientgamers,39zlfo,CryHav0c,6,Tue Jun 16 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"To add to this, FF7 also showed a level of respect for its audience that had been missing from the series before that point. Previously, Square releases had to deal with Nintendo's super strict localization team, which resulted in classic translations like ""Son of a submariner!"" In addition, Square was also forced to rename their previous entries in the FF series to hide the fact that there were three entire games that had never been brought to American/European shores. As a result, the vast majority of the English game-playing public had no clue that these games even existed.  So imagine hearing about this new FF on a non-Nintendo system, which showed their characters getting angry and cursing in a way that had never been seen before pretty much anywhere. Granted, the majority of it was censored, but it was still a major leap forward. And on top of that, Square came out and admitted they had been holding multiple ganes back from everybody.  It was roughly equivalent to Square admitting that their audience was growing up, and deserved to be treated like adults. Combine that with revolutionary graphics and a completely new take on the FF setting, and it very much lived up to its hype."

patientgamers,39zlfo,envory,2,Tue Jun 16 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"That really doesn't even begin to tell the story.  Unless you were a gamer in the mid-late 90s, it's hard to even fathom how much of a vice-grip Square had on the industry.  They were like Comcast is now, except they were a force for good.  They didn't release many games, but when they did, hoo-boy.  Everyone who was even remotely a fan of RPGs took notice.  I would say the combo of FFVI, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII (94-97) marked a period of developer dominance that we might never see rivaled in gaming history.  Three of the greatest RPGs (if not outright games) of all-time released in a 4 year period, one right after another.  Multiple magazines heralded FFVII as the greatest game ever made even prior to it's launch.  And playing it -- it honestly felt like nothing I had ever seen or experienced before from a video game.  I was a die-hard Nintendo fanboy my entire gaming life growing up.  Square was so vital to the market that the day they announced FFVII for the Playstation, I couldn't believe it.  I knew I'd buy a Playstation, and suddenly my allegiance to Nintendo was cracked.  With that one game, Sony dealt a critical strike (heh) to the legions of Nintendo fans around the world.  That was the power of Final Fantasy and Square back in the day."

It may have been the first real foray into a 3D JRPG.   I still feel like it is overrated, though. I had played FF6, Super Mario RPG, Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, Robotrek, and 7th Saga on the SNES.  To be fair, I completely missed the hype train. I heard people talk about the game, but it was years until I had a playstation of my own. I think I played FFIX and FFTactics before FF7. After beating and loving FFIX, FF7 just looked awful in comparison."
patientgamers,39zlfo,TheSnowNinja,2,Wed Jun 17 10:25:39 2015 UTC,"Well, as much as people like to poo-poo graphics, they are important to a game's appeal, and they reflect the ability to immerse you in a world.  If gamers didn't care about graphics, everyone who's not a casual gamer would be playing Dwarf Fortress 8 hours a day.  Playing FFVII on launch day was like nothing, nothing that had ever been done before.  Hell, a living 3D RPG hadn't even been attempted before, due to cost.  This game shattered your mind from the visuals and storyline alone.  Everything else on top of that was just gravy.  While it might seem silly to have all those minigames in there now, back then it was -- again, unprecedented and resulted in a ton of side-activities that just broadened the variety and enjoyment of the game.  I probably spent 5-10 hours alone just getting a gold chocobo.  It was that damn fun."

patientgamers,39zlfo,GospelX,3,Tue Jun 16 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"This game hit at the perfect time for Western gamers who were young when it came out. For those who were sold by the Sony promise that the Playstation wasn't the ""kiddy"" system that the N64 was (thanks to many of its game presenting in bright colors), this was one of the first big games to catch on. It offered anime-aesthetics to a generation experiencing the anime boom. For many, it was their first ever RPG - which essentially means that this was the first game for many in which the story (however well/poorly written) actually mattered. It's a story about good and evil, with a compelling villain character who was just so cool. It's a story about life and death, in which there is a very prominent death that really shakes your party.  And the marketing for the game was just spot on. It sold incredibly well, meaning it's a game that many people who owned a PS1 played. It was a shared experience.  Really, it's just a matter of timing. I missed out on the game at the time, having owned an N64 and not picking up a Playstation until much later. When I tried the game, I was underwhelmed. I grew up with the original Final Fantasy as well as the two SNES sequels that were released in America. FF7, for whatever reason, didn't live up to those experiences in my eyes.  If I get a PS4 in the future, I wouldn't mind giving this version a shot."
patientgamers,39zlfo,femio,2,Tue Jun 16 18:46:20 2015 UTC,As someone who didn't play FF7 until about 2 years ago...it's just really good.
patientgamers,39zlfo,MarcusDA,3,Tue Jun 16 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"It's all nostalgia. I have a feeling once people start playing it again, they'll forget why they've held it in such high regard for so many years. I was in middle school I think for the original and everyone played it. Everyone would make the same amount of progress at night and chat about it the next day.   That's really all there is to it - it was the right game at the right time.  Someone having never played it probably won't be thoroughly impressed.  Myself, I'll probably try it because I remember some of the epic moments, but I bet there's hours of filler that I've completely forgotten as well."
patientgamers,39zlfo,wonkydonky,8,Tue Jun 16 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't play it until about 5 years after on PS2, long after my friends had forgotten about it.  Even then it was great.  I replayed it about 2 years ago, and it still holds up well.  The story, storytelling, art, characters, and much more are all 100%.  The only thing that hasn't aged well is the polygons for characters on the map.  The fight mechanics do get kind of old after a while, and grinding materia is about as much fun as a lobotomy, but the story more than makes up for it."
patientgamers,39zlfo,freeogy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:44:18 2015 UTC,A lot of the reason it doesn't age well is because the glitz and glamour look thoroughly dated now. The long summoning sequences and drawn out cut scenes are mostly just aggravating rather than eye candy. The gameplay is still mostly solid. A graphical overhaul will go a long way. Maybe I'll finally be able to sit through it.

patientgamers,39zlfo,LocutusOfBorges,0,Tue Jun 16 07:38:40 2015 UTC,It's still pretty terrible. The framerate drops to <30FPS whenever any menu sprites are onscreen on a huge number of setups- nobody's quite sure why.

For all we know it could be a shit remake of a classic game. It's not as if SquareEnix hasn't made shit Final Fantasy games lately. They needs a little more meat on the bone if they want to get me excited for a game I played to death 15 years ago. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug...apparently."

patientgamers,39zlfo,DJ_IllI_Ill,2,Tue Jun 16 05:37:54 2015 UTC,Wake me up when they show a trailer of the actual gameplay for the game instead of a pre-rendered cutscene trailer.  Call me the cynic.

The only thing the iOS did right was give Cyan the ability to charge his Bushido while the rest of the party can do whatever, which was pretty nifty but other than that it's the same ol' game."
patientgamers,39zlfo,hritter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:09:49 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I never played it on PSX, but I enjoyed it on GBA.

But instead of rehashing the story why not make something new? I'm really opposed to all these remastered editions and remakes. Because the old game was good. If I want I can play it again.

patientgamers,39zlfo,LordCommanderKeef,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"For one, a good portion of people will not play a game that's still comprised of visible polygons (notably Cloud's arms). Two, there are gamers who simply would like to re-experience the game, but again, would love a graphically enhanced version. This has been requested for years. Three, improving the graphics could actually just help the game function, because some areas were hindered by the game's low resolution and it made it a little difficult to actually spot things in the world. Also, the remake may also have better depth perception for walking around. While you're right, we don't really need a rehash, that doesn't mean there isn't demand for it, and like any company worth it's salt, Enix is in it for the money. In regards to ""why not make something new"", we've seen that Enix is working on other projects as well, and I'm fairly certain they have a small dedicated team for this comprised mostly of graphic designers. A lot of companies have side projects, this just happens to be one of them. It's less effort for a smaller profit line, but they did the research and decided now would be the time to go ahead and update the game.   While you may not be excited for this, a vocal minority is. A lot of die hard Final Fantasy fans are willing to dish out some cash on this, despite it being completely unnecessary and most of the content being available to them already. People pay for eye candy."

patientgamers,3a23ki,nebachadnezzar,2,Tue Jun 16 17:11:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd call the DLC so-so. There's a ton of packs that are just costume changes. The tournament one is pretty nice, but a little easy."

patientgamers,3a23ki,snowbell55,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"It is a pretty good game. The graphics outside of the character models is pretty good, although the city doesnt feel very big, and the voice acting of the main characters is decent too. It has its cons though; the gunplqy is pretty bland, the combat system is essentially the one from the Batman Arkham series, and if you didnt like GTA IV's driving, you wont like this ones. I picked it up when it was on sale though and it definitely scratched the itch that GTA V was giving me, i would give it a solid 8.5/10 and it is definitely worth $7.50."
patientgamers,3a23ki,ILikeRaisinsAMA,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:35:49 2015 UTC,I got it for Â£6.79 (66% off) during the Christmas sale so I'd say at the current 75% off it's well worth buying as there's hours of really good gameplay even if you only do the main story & nothing else.

A lot of people only play the WWE games for the customization options that it brings, and 15 brought those options almost to non-existence.  However, if it's your first game ever and you're looking to start somewhere, 50% off is no biggie at all"

patientgamers,3a17xb,psway,8,Tue Jun 16 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's a love or hate type thing.   I stopped and started the game twice - I even wrote if off for a few months. One day I got the urge to play it again and something clicked. After that I burned through Dark Souls, Demons Souls, and Dark Souls 2 in a few months. I couldn't get enough of it.   The learning curve is steep but after you ""get"" the combat, things open up a lot more."
patientgamers,3a17xb,MarcusDA,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"Same thing for me, only I started at Demon Souls. Started and stopped that game a couple of times before I got through it, but knowing that I had made it much easier to get through Dark Souls 1 & 2.  That being said, OP don't feel obligated to finish it. Go play something else, and if you feel like coming back to it later that's alright."
patientgamers,3a17xb,juggymcnoobtube,4,Tue Jun 16 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd say stick with it, but I would say don't abandon it.  Take a break and play through something else if you need to, just come back eventually.  If you are feeling supreme satisfaction when you progress, then that sounds like what you should be getting out of Dark Souls.  As you get farther in the game, you'll get better and more powerful, and the progress will come more easily.  Keep at it, or come back later and give it another go."
patientgamers,3a17xb,Wade42,3,Tue Jun 16 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"The problem i had with taking a break from dark souls is that due to no map / quest log, it can be hard to get back into the game if you wait too long.   I would say take a short break and then stick with it, as dark souls has been my favourite game in a long time."
patientgamers,3a17xb,cptnfool,2,Tue Jun 16 14:53:28 2015 UTC,I think I'll do this. Thanks for the advice!
patientgamers,3a17xb,psy-q,9,Tue Jun 16 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"That's always hard to judge. I had the same feeling with Dark Souls II. I can appreciate the game for what it is, I can understand that some people master the controls to such a degree that they can dodge anything, but I was feeling deflated and let down more than anything after each play session. That shouldn't be, a game should make you feel badass or clever or challenged or relaxed or any number of pleasant things. This wasn't doing that, so I just quit.   Got it in a huge sale, but I figure wasting â¬20 and 10 hours of playtime is better than wasting â¬20 and 100 hours of playtime (unenjoyable one, at that).  The good thing is that since we're patient, we can still come back and revisit the game in two or three years and see if it makes us feel any different."
patientgamers,3a17xb,meikyoushisui,2,Tue Jun 16 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"a game should make you feel badass or clever or challenged or relaxed or any number of pleasant things.   I agree with what you've said, but Dark Souls makes me feel most of those things, especially challenged. There's nothing unfair about the game design -- it just doesn't hold your hand at all, and punishes you for mistakes. You rarely die and say ""well shit, I definitely couldn't have avoided that."" You think ""well shit, it really sucks because I totally could have avoided that."" (With a couple exceptions, maybe?) As for feeling clever, that's usually what I feel like after setting up a perfect parry against another player.   I have a lot more experience with DaS2 than DaS1 though, and feel it's a lot easier to get into since it controls tighter and gives you more options to play (especially PVP.)"
patientgamers,3a17xb,shifty_pete,3,Tue Jun 16 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"I have found that with games you are on the fence about, it's better to walk away. People and critics can all agree to love something, but your personal taste may not care for it. I, for one, do not like mashed potatoes. Something about the texture makes me gag. EVERYONE loves them though, so people treat me like an infant when I bring it up. I like other kinds of potatoes though. I'd say move on to something else, unless the story is really worth it to you."
patientgamers,3a17xb,ikahjalmr,3,Tue Jun 16 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"I would say absolutely. However I also played through the games with a friend, so if there was something I really didn't want to do, them I could just watch him do it, and vice versa"
patientgamers,3a17xb,LazyGit,3,Tue Jun 16 17:14:32 2015 UTC,God no. It's such a crap game that I cannot understand in the slightest how so many people can enjoy it. Maybe it's not as good on PC or something but I just cannot get into it. And I've tried. There are just no redeeming qualities in my opinion.
patientgamers,3a17xb,Porcelet_Sauvage,7,Thu Jun 18 12:46:18 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of things in life, you get out of Dark Souls what you put in.   Every time you die you need to accept that it was your fault somehow. You dodged too late, parried too early, took on too large a group, got over-confident etc. It is ALWAYS your fault.  So while it seems harsh the game is actively trying to teach you to be better. Every death is a lesson. The game just won't hold your hand or let you restart that section with no penalty when you make a mistake. You need to actively try and avoid dying, not just press Continue when it happens.  The sharp learning curve might be off-putting but when you get the hang of it its more rewarding than most other games because it was completely down to you that you succeeded. Your armour and weapons play into it but because the enemies can kill you so easily, when you wreck them and take no damage you feel like a god.  But not a god fighting mere mortals, like in most games where you are much more powerful than the enemies, but a god that took on other gods, some with MASSIVE swords, and crushed them.  If you're the type of gamer to put god-mode and unlimited ammo on and just go on a rampage then i'd move on. Otherwise read a beginners guide, as it's easy to make mistakes with gear and stat points when you aren't sure what you're doing, and stick with it."
patientgamers,3a17xb,WW4O,4,Tue Jun 16 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think you need to recognize what you get out of the game. There are lots of games where one player can feel like they're wasting a lot of time making very little progress, and other gamers feel like they're spending that time well, and progress isn't as important as playing. So if the gameplay to you is worth playing for an hour or two without going anywhere, then stick with it. But if you play for an hour or two, save at the same campfire with the same amount of progress, and feel like you've wasted that time, move on to a different game.   Gaming shouldn't feel like a chore."

The great thing about Dark Souls is it's so dense. The real satisfaction comes after beating the game though imo. Seeing all the fan creations and lore videos really add to the experience. /r/darksouls is one of the only game subreddits i consistently follow even after not playing the game for so long.  Everyone's taste is different. But in my eyes, this is the greatest video game I have ever experienced. Hands down."
patientgamers,3a17xb,IsaacAccount,2,Tue Jun 16 23:13:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a gamer who loves challenges, so Dark Souls was naturally the right for me. I think you should try and stick with it. I've played many, many games and Dark Souls is pretty much the top of the top. It's got a great mix of challenge and reward and it makes you take the game seriously. And as much as you could play another game, not many out there give you as much satisfaction when you do well in the game."
patientgamers,3a17xb,Izanasz,3,Tue Jun 16 23:16:33 2015 UTC,Where are you in the game? What equipment are you using? It could be that you're making some unintentional choices that are making things more difficult than they have to be.
patientgamers,3a17xb,01314150,2,Tue Jun 16 14:02:51 2015 UTC,"I lean towards no. Dark Souls is a fun game at first, the difficulty makes for some interested mechanics and whatnot, but.. to me, that's it. The story/lore and everything around it is not so good as to keep me interested, and it does get awfully repetitive after a while. But it's for each and every one to find out if it's worth it."

patientgamers,3a0x5j,CptAustus,10,Tue Jun 16 11:12:44 2015 UTC,That's pretty much the very beginning of the game. You stopped right before a shocking scene I think.

patientgamers,3a0x5j,Gorfoo,10,Tue Jun 16 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"It's not better - gameplay is slightly worse unless you mod it, in which case it's pretty much as good as New Vegas. The main story is more linear which some people like whereas others do not (Liam Neeson!!!). I think the quests are more memorable but maybe others will disagree... The setting is also very different - the maps are around the same size but Fallout 3 is much more sparsely populated and probably has more memorable locations overall - the new vegas strip is great but Rivet City, Tenpenny Tower, Megaton, Little lamplight and Paradise city are all very unique."
patientgamers,3a0x5j,flyin-penguin19,4,Tue Jun 16 15:35:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like they're on par, depending on your preferences."
patientgamers,3a0x5j,HongManChoi,5,Tue Jun 16 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"I think they are myself, I prefer New Vegas myself, my main reason for it is how claustrophobic 3 felt. Both are great games, and they both have their pros and cons. I don't think there is a ""better"" game overall."
patientgamers,3a0x5j,Rectalcactus,2,Tue Jun 16 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"The storyline is fairly neat, and involves you quite a lot. Reading your comments you only got to Nipton? There's a scene just after there which grips you a lot more and makes you go ""Woah, so this is what this area of the world is like?"". It might be worth giving it ago and waiting till you get to Novac, and then if you don't like it any more than you did previously, give it a miss."
patientgamers,3a0x5j,Bman4500,2,Tue Jun 16 12:48:15 2015 UTC,"""Woah, so this is what this area of the world is like?""   Sounds good!  Novac is not the town behind the two huge statues, right?"
patientgamers,3a0x5j,paradoxpancake,3,Tue Jun 16 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"No, the statues place is an NCR outpost. Novac is a bit of a walk past Nipton."
patientgamers,3a0x5j,paradoxpancake,2,Tue Jun 16 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"No, as you leave Primm head left instead of right. The way you went (if I'm correct) leads toward an NCR Outpost, which should give you a quest or two which will then lead you toward Nipton. Once you've done the bit of storyline in Nipton, you'll head to Novac which'll give you a bit more insight into the world, and from there you're free to head to Vegas (which is also pretty cool imo.)."

It's tough to get into the story until you start getting further into the game and a lot of people give it an hour or two and quit.  When they try again though, they tend to really like it."
patientgamers,3a0x5j,Spanky222,2,Tue Jun 16 16:07:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with what everyone else is saying in that you need to get further into the story, but I also would recommend trying a different kind of character. Playing as a guns guy? Try a character with some melee skills! Maybe sneaking is more your thing. NV is one of my favorite games because there is so many different ways to play the same situations! Also I would at least get to Vegas before giving it up because that's where the magic happens!"
patientgamers,3a0x5j,Spanky222,2,Tue Jun 16 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"I hated New Vegas when I first started it. Not until the 3rd time I actually picked the game up to seriously play it did I enjoy it and now I love it more than 3 actually. The mods are a sweet addition, and the side quests are way longer and more rewarding than 3 imo. It does take a while to get into but one you reach Vegas it picks up a lot. The main quest is cool where you choose a side or you make your own (what I suggest)."

It's VERY simple air-traffic-control (not a serious simulation) where you click on a plane, then click on a runway to land on or take off from.  It calls for quick thinking and good reaction times.  If she really enjoys it, the next step up would be ATC3.

patientgamers,39xqjv,Discoteca,7,Tue Jun 16 02:25:32 2015 UTC,"Really impressive move, since Microsoft and Sony seemed to have abandoned backwards compatibility this generation. Nice to see Microsoft bringing it back, so people don't necessarily have to rebuy another lastgen console should it break to revisit some of their old titles.   Still not likely to pick one up yet, since their franchises aren't ones I'm particularly attached to but might get one up years down the road."
patientgamers,39xqjv,CaspianX2,11,Mon Jun 15 19:39:35 2015 UTC,"So far, only 18 games have been confirmed. Microsoft claims 100 by holiday 2015, and ""hundreds"" more at some future time.  This is a good start, but I need more details, and more games, before I see this as a huge game-changer for me. If December comes and we get a list filled with games like Barbie Horse Adventures, that doesn't really sell me on it now, does it?  Will this list support indie games? Will it support Xbox Originals? Will it require me to both download the game onto my hard drive and use the disc every time I want to play? Will the Xbox One be backwards-compatible with 360 controllers and accessories? Will there be any notable slowdown or emulation errors? What about licensed games by publishers who no longer hold the rights to that license (like Konami's Ninja Turtles arcade game)? What about games published by companies that have since gone out of business?  I don't mean to be pessimistic - this is definitely positive news, and pushes me closer to getting an Xbox One, but I want to get more information before I make a judgment on whether to get a console yet."
patientgamers,39xqjv,kymess_jr,6,Mon Jun 15 21:03:05 2015 UTC,I can't answer most of your questions -- which are great points to keep in mind -- but the Xbox website does mention that you will need to keep the disc in the machine to play any physical copies you have (despite it also downloading the game to the drive).
patientgamers,39xqjv,bloodyhand,2,Mon Jun 15 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a great deal. I hope it's exactly what we all hope it is....   Almost sounds too good to be true though, huh?   I suspect that if Microsoft can find a way to make money directly off BC, they absolutely will.   My guess is, we will likely get a token amount of 'free' lower demand/lower effort BC games. Maybe even that 100 game figure they are using. Then later on they will either withhold titles that have a high demand for future 'HD re-releases' or commence otherwise charging per title for the functionality. That's if they can provide BC on all games without problems, of course.   The pessimist in me thinks this whole thing sounds like a nice bullet point on an E3  presentation or something to slap on the box. Something to get people talking about XBO and possibly pushing some towards buying. And hey, it worked. Good for them! They don't really even have to follow through now. Most people are just going to see 'BC capable' and not question how many/quality at all.   Modern console business. Gotta love it. :P"
patientgamers,39xqjv,kymess_jr,2,Tue Jun 16 03:29:51 2015 UTC,"There was a video about it on my Xbox dashboard tonight, so I watched it. It sounds like the only limitations of BC are licensing agreements and whether a publisher approves the title for it. The actual BC is acheveived by emulating a 360 dashboard on the One. The guy in the video talked about how they will try to get as many fan-favourites available, games with large player bases and do polls to see what the community wants added. They demonstrated with Borderlands (which isn't currently on the list of 18 games), so I'm sure they've got quite a few more games of that calibre ready to go.   I think you're right though, this is definitely a move Microsoft is looking to make the most money out of. But I'm thinking they're hoping to gain those funds through more console sales and subsequent first-run One game sales to people that have been slow to switch, rather than just a glut of HD re-releases. I'm sure they'll also expand the digital marketplace on the One to include 360 titles again, and this will allow them to keep the digital prices higher on older titles."
patientgamers,39xqjv,blackmarketdolphins,11,Tue Jun 16 07:46:26 2015 UTC,"I'm about to cave in and get one for Christmas.

I figured it would still be a few years yet considering how many 360 games I still have to play (and all the games with gold downloads piling up). On top of this, I really want to be impatient for Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2 which won't be available on last gen. This most likely means I'll be upgrading sometime before spring 2016.  There's still a slew of questions about the backwards compatibility though. For instance, how are multiplayer games gonna be affected? Will 360 multiplayer games played on the One be able to connect to other 360 players, regardless of the console they're on?  (I'm assuming it wouldn't suddenly mix multiplayer bases between the 360/One.)  Also, how are game prices gonna be affected? Gamestop has been having all these great sales to get rid of the last-gen stock, but if they're suddenly usable on the current gen consoles, will we see a rise in prices on 10 year old games?"

patientgamers,39xqjv,exhibitionistgrandma,3,Mon Jun 15 22:57:48 2015 UTC,"This doesn't really change things for me, since there aren't any games exclusive to Xbox One that have caught my attention.   To broaden the conversation a little, when I think about it, backwards compatibility in the sense of being able to play a last-gen disc in the current-gen console doesn't matter much to me. I bought my PS3 after the PS4 dropped, and at that point I had exhausted all that I wanted out of the PS2. I plan to do the same thing with the PS4 if a PS5 comes out.   I'm pretty much a generation behind, with the exception of my 3DS, but everything is cheaper and usually consoles at that point have improved hardware.  I am guessing that this will appeal more to people who don't or didn't have a 360 and would be jumping to the Xbox One, so people who aren't particularly ""loyal"" to one console or the other.   tl;dr don't need backwards compatibility because I'm already backwards"

patientgamers,39xqjv,Akamaru,2,Tue Jun 16 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"It's not a Sony killer, but Microsoft notices people like me who have had an Xbox 360 for years and HAVEN'T migrated my gammer tag to XB1. I still play my Xbox 360 and so do a lot of people.  Backwards compatibility reduces the risks to consumers because they can now justify a whole new console for 1 or 2 decent first gen games and a bunch of last gen games they haven't played through yet.  People don't like having a bunch of consoles hooked up to their entertainment center. The Xbox 1 Blu-ray playback is a nice bonus as well if you don't already have a Blu-ray player.  I'm still going to""wait and see"" about the Xbox 1, but the offerings are starting to catch my attention.

The only other argument is for people who don't actually have X1s yet, which I get, but I get the impression that most people getting hyped for MS' presentation are those that already have 360s.

I'm meh about Divinity: Original Sin and Brothers - A Tale of two sons - but other people seem to LOVE those games, so have a look.   FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.  It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it. NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.

I have played AC3 and it had item crafting, naval battles to make shipping lanes less risky for trading, and upgrades for your ship, but I found that to be boring so I never paid much attention to it.  I would try and just move on and not focus too much on the trading aspect so you can finish the game quicker.    There are trading and economy games currently on Steam's summer sale if you enjoy focusing on that aspect, but I don't know enough about the genre to say which are good or bad.  You might look into the Port Royale and Patrician series or the Anno series."

patientgamers,39zidm,seifer93,7,Tue Jun 16 02:19:56 2015 UTC,"If there's no legitimate way of obtaining the game or playing it on a modern PC then I don't really see the issue.

patientgamers,39woaq,cosmicr,11,Mon Jun 15 12:22:09 2015 UTC,"The COD games are just expensive and rarely go on sale or drop their prices. Interesting is the fact that in my country (Romania) you can find the retail PC version for 60 RON, which is the equivalent of 15$ and NOT on sale. The store that sells it (Altex) is the biggest electronics retailer here. It's a common occurrence for slightly older PC games (like one or two years) to be a lot more cheaper compared to Steam.   Here is a list of prices for games (NOT on sale) which are cheaper than what you get on Steam. I'm using the currency converter from Google (RON to USD)   Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon: $4.50 Arkham City: GOTY Edition: $7.50 Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition: $7.50 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: $7.50 Crysis 3: $10 Tomb Raider: $10 Sleeping Dogs: $10 Call of Duty: Ghosts: $17.26 Assassin's Creed: The American Saga (includes ACIII, Liberation and Black FLag): $19.76 Total War: Attila: $27.28 Assassin's Creed: Unity Special Edition: $37.29 Far Cry 4: $37.29 Dying Light: $37.29 The Witcher 3: D1 edition: $42.29 Evolve: $42.29   Again, these are the regular prices. No sales involved. I have no idea why this is, but it's sometimes a lot better than Steam.   Edit: Link to the site."
patientgamers,39woaq,lacsativ,2,Mon Jun 15 13:36:25 2015 UTC,Nitpick: Crysis 3 isn't on Steam and was around 5 EUR on Origin and Uplay the last time I checked at 50 percent discount.
patientgamers,39woaq,theindigamer,9,Mon Jun 15 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"They sell 25$ map packs for those games. Just map packs. We aren't talking loads of maps either, maybe 4-5.  They aren't concerned with providing value for a low price point. It has been that way since MW2."

patientgamers,39woaq,Hawkings_WheelChair,3,Mon Jun 15 16:42:16 2015 UTC,No probably not. A lot of people still play and buy these games. Bo2 is still $22 at my local shop. That game is nearly 3 years old!!! I guess it also depends since console has a black ops 1&2 combo pack. Not sure about pc
patientgamers,39woaq,rarelypost,2,Mon Jun 15 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"I would probably stop buying games just to launch them once to demo them.  It seems like you're wasting money if you're never going to actually play them or finish them.  Check out some let's plays to see the gameplay and check http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri to see if your system can run it (though of course it's not completely accurate for every situation).  If you do get one COD, and you only want to play it for the campaign, I would suggest grabbing COD 4: Modern Warfare, as I feel it has the best campaign of any of them.  Of course if you want a thriving online multiplayer then you'd probably be better off getting one of the newer titles."

patientgamers,39woaq,rtechie1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:23:26 2015 UTC,COD has been very multiplayer-focused since MW1 and there's little reason to buy a multiplayer game years after launch.

patientgamers,39woaq,1leggeddog,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"No they usually never go very cheap. At least, not titles younger then 5 years.  The nice thing about COD games is to play them AT LAUNCH, where not everyone is overpowered and you still have a chance online.  Later on, well you have all of the cheaters and you're seriously underranked.  I wouldn't mind getting COD games for like 10$ but the way it is now, MW2 was my last one.   Not to mention since they removed dedicated servers, that was the last nail in the coffin."

It's not all that hard to rank up in cod, its not an mmorpg that takes a ton of grinding. There's also the prestige system so people are constantly resetting. Thats where the real grind comes in. Getting to the highest rank and unlocking everything the first time around isn't hard.   Not justifying modding/hacking though so I can see that."

There's no harm in waiting unless you want to play it immediately or you're afraid of its discount dropping.  Valve has it marked for the whole summer sale so I think this is going to be the sale price the whole sale unless it does go lower, so you should be fine."

Killzone 3 had splitscreen campaign we played. It was ok if you're into console shooters.  Super Stardust HD is fun.  Wipeout HD Fury is a good racer.  Resident Evil 5 was not anywhere near as good as RE4 but my buddy and his wife played the multiplayer and had a blast, they said.  Eternal Sonata is a JRPG with multiplayer combat if you're into that. I never got too far into the game before getting distracted by other things.  Street Fighter 4 is awesome if you guys are into competitive games.  I think Trine 1 and 2 are on PS3 maybe, I played them once we switched to PC, and they are awesome, probably the most fun I've had."

My friend and I were looking for a similar game on the PS3. War in the North was a great decision. There was excellent LotR lore. The plot/story isn't the most captivating ever, but it holds up. The best thing about it is the strategy and roles each person plays. It has great replay value as well, because you want to keep getting the best armor and weapons. Once you complete one difficulty, your armor and weapons transfer over to the next difficulty. We play it every few months we see each other. I highly recommend it."

patientgamers,39xc9f,drax117,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:51:16 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this comment. I just started playing this lately. I got to the bit where you have to ""Find the Family"" and was like ""this is way too vague, literally all I know about these guys is they have terrorised this small village, probably killed two of the inhabitants and the leader was seen down by the river talking to the dead couples son. It's not a lot to go on, but I assume they must be reasonably near by.  So I search around the river, 3 murlocks (or whatever they're called) attack me, I don't want to waste ammo so I lure them back to the caravan trader and let his guard take care of them for me.  Search all around the river, not much, find some items.  So I'm stumped, I decide to walk to a high point and look around. I do so and see a building of some kind and think ""welp, may as well take a look I don't have anything else to do"" As I'm walking there I'm thinking ""maybe I could just look up where to find the Family online, this is way too vague, not even a direction to start walking in, I could literally walk forever in the wrong direction away and never know... no fuck using the guide, then your not even playing a game your just going through the motions of playing a game, not unless I've struggled for hours and need it to move on to something else will I use a guide...""  I arrive at the building ""You have discovered Northwest Seneca Station!""  ""Great!"" I think ""Why the fuck do I care? There's nothing here... hey there's a door on the corner of that building... and I can enter 'Grocer' lets see..."" so I go in and loot it, take the meagre goodies from their safe... JESSICA? What kind of password is that? Now I feel bad, this was a family business, maybe they are coming back... ""Nah the place is pretty trashed already and infested with roaches.""  I walk outside and see there's some steps down into an old subway station, I'll take a look.  I walk in and the first thing I see is a dead body; this place is dangerous! I look the body, 8 caps, nice, looks like this poor fuckers head got bashed in but he wasn't robbed? What to make of that? Maybe it wasn't a mugging, maybe it was a straight up slaying... but this place is abandoned looking, except, hang on I can see a fire... wait it's two burning barrels either side of a door.  Welp, I take out my assault rifle and straight up open the door, ready for whatever. To my surprise I see two ghouls in what looks like some kind of lab... what? The Ghoul interrupts my thought with a panicked ""You're not here to steal my secrets are you?"" This dude is clearly paranoid, but ""secrets"" maybe he has something valuable.  I calm the Ghoul down while his bodyguard looks on, but he keeps his automatic rifle slung over his back, odd because I'm standing here waving my assault rifle around. The Ghoul has a proposition for me, bring him sugar bombs and he'll give me Superjet, some kind of refinement of the drug I've come across already among the raiders of the waste ""Jet"". I have some of it on me, I don't tell the tweaker Ghoul this. I haven't taken it yet, I'm wary, but it seems to grant the user superhuman stamina, that could be useful in a pinch. I agree to bring this strung out Ghoul some sugar bombs in exchange for caps, he's paying well.  Before I go I decide to ask the Ghoul some questions. What about his body guard? No surprise there, he's his bodyguard, another tweaker I suppose. Out of desperation I ask ""What do you know about 'the Family'?""   What luck! This Ghoul knows about the family, and he says they are East of here. Wait... there's a secret entrace to their base from this very metro station? I take a look on my PIP-boy at the local map and see the only other exact, place my marker and go.  A tunnel? More fucking Murlocks!!! I can't handle these guys too well and there's no caravanners to save me now. I take a look at my inventory, frag mines... that could fit in well with my running away from these fuckers strategy. I let the first murlock see me and then as he gives chase I back away, keeping him in sight and tossing frag mines at his feet. Soon he is dead. Big and strong, with tough armour but none too bright. I do the same to his friend and continue on up the tunnel ready to surprise whoever these ""Family"" people turn out to be. I'm ready to go in guns blazing since they've terrorized this town and are probably crazed killers.  I emerge from the cave like tunnel into a train tunnel, I move forward and hear a loud bang, I jump in shock and when I come to my senses I see my PIP-boy is telling me my left leg is crippled. What just happened? I patch up my with one of my dwindling Stimpacks, damn that was stupid. I look around more carefully. Further ahead I see a little frag mine on the ground. I walk up and disable it, I was all out after the Murlocks, nice to get some more of this weapon in stock, some more looking around reveals more frag mines, some wire traps and even some bear traps. These ""Family"" people really don't want visitors, and seem happy to blow people to up. I check my assault rifle has a full clip in it.  I walk down the last tunnel I haven't checked yet and see a sandbag type barricade of junk... this is it. As I'm walking up out walks a man in gear that's similar to but not quite the same as the raiders I've seen out in the wasteland. He hasn't seen me yet but I'm too close to turn and run, I rush forward and crouch to hide behind the barricade... it's not enough he's spotted me! He shouts and asks me who I am and why I'm here? ""Why am I  here"" I think?  One of the first harsh realities of the Wasteland I discovered is that resources are limited, and also essential to survival. What would I do against Murlock or Raider with only my bare fists, I'm no martial artist. I need bullets and reliable weapons and Stimpacks... these things cost caps. A woman in bar promised me a large sum of caps to bring a message to her family, when I got there her parents were dead and her brother missing... I started the journey that brought me here out of a desperate need for caps but now I want to know just exactly what kind of horror story I'm in, what kind of monsters kill a couple and steal their son? There's also a chance I still might get those caps if I can rescue her brother.  I deflect the guards question and play dumb... I'm just looking around. No need to give away my true reasons for being here just yet. To my surprise he lets me in and tells me to go speak to their leader, Vance. I steal everything that looks useful and walk up into the main chamber. What the heck is going on here I wonder? These guys look well equipped and healthy not like the Raiders on the surface who have nothing but some sheet metal and their weapons. Is this some kind of weird cult? Why are they terrorizing that town? Why didn't that guard attack me on-sight? Maybe I better go speak to this ""Vance"".  After that....  short version: bunch of tumblrfag vampire-kin think it's funny to drink blood and all suck this Vance guys dick... I and that kid and convince him to go join his sister and stop being such candy-ass then I make a deal with that Vance prick that he'll stop being such a goddamn candy-ass drinking the blood of the townsfolk if they'll keep sending him packs of blood in exchange for protection..."

patientgamers,39xnr5,jk01,10,Mon Jun 15 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"My opinion? It's good, but it has some serious flaws. It can be ""meh"" at many points and it's most certainty over-hyped by the fans.  For example, if you want to go the ""don't kill anybody, be good, full stealth"" route, then you'll miss out on around 60-70% of what the game offers.  Also, don't get fooled into believing the story is ""really good"". It's decent, but mostly functions as a way to progress from level to level. I guarantee that by the end of it the only name you'll remember is ""Corvo"" and nobody else.  Don't expect anything overly spectacular. It's just a game. A nice little game, but nothing more. It's not a ""must have"" by any means."
patientgamers,39xnr5,BlaineCraner,4,Mon Jun 15 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"I really like Dishonored, but I agree with everything you said except that the story is ""decent.""  I think the story is genuinely bad.  The world is great, and the gameplay mechanics are strong, but the plot is 'you were framed for murder and now you are on a quest for revenge.'  You can't get a more stereotypical video game storyline than that.  As for the 'Outsider' storyline, do get me started.  That said- from what I hear, the stories of the DLC are actually really, really good."
patientgamers,39xnr5,genericaccount1234,2,Mon Jun 15 23:08:07 2015 UTC,"Dishonored has been on my to-do list for a long time now, but your comment makes me rethink my choice.   For example, if you want to go the ""don't kill anybody, be good, full stealth"" route, then you'll miss out on around 60-70% of what the game offers.   Why? That's how I would have tried to beat the game, so that'd be a true bummer."
patientgamers,39xnr5,hardypart,2,Tue Jun 16 07:47:41 2015 UTC,"Why? Well, simply because you miss out on things. A lot of the equipment, spells and skills are all kill and combat focused. Even the crossbow. AND you can use those skills and equipment in creative ways. When you sneak you mostly avoid almost every combat scene, encounter, enemy, piece of cool equipment etc.  In good games of this kind, like Deus Ex, you would have a lot of different skills completely stealth related. Many kinds of silenced weapons, special take-downs. Stealth equipment in the form of grenades, maybe hacking equipment, camouflage, non lethal weapons to have a chance to fight in melee.   The last one really bugs me. He runs around with a fucking sword, but he can't pick up a stick and whack somebody to deal nonlethal damage? No, if you want combat you have to use the super-fancy-steampunk-blade and kill everybody. In Deus Ex you had taser rods, why didn't they put something like this in the game?!  You won't feel any of that in Dishonored. The game encourages you to butcher everything like a psychopath (try the rats), and punishes you with boredom if you try to be the good guy."
patientgamers,39xnr5,BlaineCraner,5,Tue Jun 16 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"Gameplay is a lot of fun, not really a fan of the characters or story, but the game is a blast to play, if you can, get the DLC"

patientgamers,39xnr5,Noodle36,2,Mon Jun 15 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"Watch the trailer. It's not in game footage, but every location is in the game, and everything he does is something you can do in game, just with less pretty graphics. It has a solid choice dynamic, where the more stealthy you are, the better the outcome. More deaths > more rats > more plague > more chaotic ending. It's a solid game, definitely a favorite."

patientgamers,39xnr5,SomeCasualObserver,0,Tue Jun 16 03:36:52 2015 UTC,Too much hyping up products and promises that will not be fulfilled for my taste.
patientgamers,39xnr5,NekoiNemo,2,Tue Jun 16 04:47:43 2015 UTC,"Iirc E3 is basically an opportunity for companies to get investors on for their products. The hype and promises came as a natural result of this.  E3 as an event for fans is a relatively recent development.  Not trying to justify it, it's still shady as fuck. But I don't think that it's a matter of companies trying to trick their fans or anything like that."
patientgamers,39xnr5,SomeCasualObserver,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:08:35 2015 UTC,promises that will not be fulfilled   That's my issue with E3. And also hype to coerce people into pre-ordering something they've only seen 2 minutes of pre-rendered cutscenes.
patientgamers,39xnr5,NekoiNemo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:10:49 2015 UTC,E3 as an event for fans is a relatively recent development.   Not really. E3 was open for public in 2007-2008 before closing it again. It was always popular with the fans.

patientgamers,39xnr5,MassiveBallacks,-2,Mon Jun 15 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"Solid game. If you enjoy FPS story-driven games in the vein of Bioshock / Half Life, you'll love Dishonored. In fact that's the biggest thing I have to say in the negative: It felt too much like it was trying to rip off Bioshock Infinite. But that's just my opinion: The game was still fantastic."
patientgamers,39xnr5,itty53,8,Mon Jun 15 17:30:04 2015 UTC,Dishonored was released a little while before Bioshock Infinite :)
patientgamers,39xnr5,BoringHoles,-4,Mon Jun 15 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"While that may be true, Bioshock Infinite started development a lot sooner and in addition, wasn't the first Bioshock game. Dishonored did draw heavily from the original two.  Wikipedia page on Dishonored says development began July of 2011. Work on Bioshock started in February of 2008. And in this industry, everyone knows what everyone else is doing. Dishonored was a well-done rushjob of a game to try to compete with BI.   Also worth noting: BI kind of pandered... hard. There was this extremely popular cosplayer who did Elizabeth, and she was so damn good at it that BI turned around and remodeled Elizabeth in-game to make her look more like the cosplayer.  Which just goes to show the lengths at which Irrational Games was going to make the 'perfect game'. We're talking a five-year development, put on hold at the last minute to remodel a main character because of cosplay. That's.. that's somethin'."
patientgamers,39xnr5,itty53,4,Mon Jun 15 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"That's wrong on way too many levels. If anything, Dishonored draws inspiration from Deus Ex. BS wears its inspiration on it's sleeve - System Shock which 1st and 2nd games tried (poorly) to ape and Infinite even forgot that it was supposed to do that.  There's nothing, not a single thing in common between BS and Dishonored."
patientgamers,39xnr5,NekoiNemo,2,Mon Jun 15 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"That's the least helpful suggestion i've seen.  Dishonored is not an FPS. It's a stealth game. In fact, there are only 2 ranged weapons in game.  Dishonored (Deus Ex style quasi-nonlinear stealth game) has nothing to do with HL2 and BS (linear FPS).  BS Infinite was released WAY after Dishonored and their aesthetics nor themes have nothing in common."

You may skip 2nd if you have 3rd since 2nd doesn't have story-driven campaign and instead offers you to just conquer Etheria province by province on a series of pre-made skirmish maps. It's pretty dull compared to the campaign of the 3rd."

I'm into Ghibli but couldn't get into the game -- found its pace to be too deliberate, bordering on tedious. But a lot of people loved it. I haven't played Inquisition, but I've heard very good things.   For this, I'd say go with your gut. It sounds like DA is the game you want, and that you'd be settling for Ni No Kuni, but I don't know what's in your head. If I'm right, just buy DA."

The combat ended up getting somewhat monotonous by the end, but the story was good and there were plenty of surprises to keep you going.  It is in my top 2 games on my XB1/PS4 combined.  I've put more time into it than any game in the last ...gosh, probably 10 years.  It's fun.  I don't know anything about the Ni No Kuni game.  But I can say that DAI was a pleasant surprise."

If you are looking for a pokemon-esque JRPG with some sweet animation, then NNK. Although it has its flaws, it is a lot of fun once you get over the constant hand-holding over the first 15 hours of the game. If you want a solid action RPG that has some interesting characters, then Inquisition is the better choice."

After that, you can either go back to the original on NES if you want see where ALTTP evolved from, or check out Orcania of Time if you want to see where it went next and the other arguably greatest.  From there you can explore out in any direction through the rest of the franchise."

A Link Between Worlds, the new 3DS Zelda game and sequel to Link to the Past, is a masterful game. The graphics are great and it has callbacks to alttp in that it takes place in the same overworld, but the dungeons and story are all different.

patientgamers,39uinq,reddit_can_suck_my_,-20,Mon Jun 15 08:00:30 2015 UTC,"I'd skip Ocarina of Time.  It hasn't aged well at all, while ALTTP has aged very gracefully.  Twilight Princess covers all the same notes as Ocarina of Time but it's a much, much better game so it kind of removes the need to play OoT outside of some completionist desire.  OoT is a ridiculously clunky game these days.  Among the worst controls in gaming history."
patientgamers,39uinq,ElijahSnow27,29,Mon Jun 15 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. OoT has aged incredibly well to me and I'm not saying this because I'm looking through nostalgic goggles, I just recently played the game for the first time on the Nintendo 64 last year and it's easily one of my all time favorite games now and is extremely satisfying to play through. After I finished that I got the 3DS version and played through that again and I'm playing through the Master Quest version for the first time and I'm falling in love with it all over again while enjoying a new challenge."
patientgamers,39uinq,StereoJoe14,19,Mon Jun 15 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah OP please listen to this guy. Sometimes I get carried away and rate OoT lower than it should be but everything about that game is really incredible. The music, items, bosses and dungeons will all stick with you after you finish the game. Twilight Princess had some sick items and cool characters but the story and music were hit or miss.   Basically Ocarina of Time is like, required reading when it comes to the Zelda franchise. Plus it opens you up to Majoras Mask immediately after, which is by far the Zelda game that most distinguishes itself from the other games.  A Link to the Past -> Ocarina of Time -> Majoras Mask was such a good progression the Zelda series, holy shit. You should really play it like that OP. You could play MM whenever but after OoT would be killer."

patientgamers,39uinq,borktheorc,-15,Mon Jun 15 04:54:13 2015 UTC,N64 is a blight on the legacy of Nintendo.  Easily the worst console I've ever played.  Every game that was on it suffered horribly for being on it.

patientgamers,39uinq,The_Haunt,-3,Mon Jun 15 06:38:50 2015 UTC,"Mario 64 was alright.  I wasn't nearly as fond of it as other people though, I thought the Crash Bandicoot games were much more fun.  Mario 64 suffered from the typical N64 issues.  Horrible controls, blurry textures that gave me headaches, and horrible music and sound effects compared to the Playstation titles of the day.   My most vivid memories of Mario 64 are fighting with the camera.  I'd put it into the most comfortable position for a bit of platforming, start moving... and the camera would force itself back into the position that I had moved it from.  Again and again.  Making what should be an easy straight line walk into something nightmarish where I would fall off a narrow platform over and over again because the camera would change while I was walking.  They just didn't have the technology back then.  But that's no excuse, because Super Mario Sunshine should've learned from the mistakes but it still suffered from the exact same horrible camera system that would actively fight against the player.    It wasn't until Super Mario Galaxy before I really liked a Mario game even close to as much as I liked the 2D games.  I'd say that pretty much all of Nintendo's best games are on the NES and SNES."
patientgamers,39uinq,ElijahSnow27,-6,Mon Jun 15 07:15:42 2015 UTC,"I know you're getting downvoted but I agree with you. N64 is garbage and OoT is snoozeville. However, I don't agree with skipping Wind Waker; that is an awesome game."

If I cared about downvotes, I wouldn't insult one of the golden calves of gaming.  But yeah, the N64 was such a letdown.  I was a huge Nintendo fanboy but even I couldn't defend the N64.    TWW is a much better game but I found the constant wind direction changing to become too annoying to bear later in the game when I was trying to clear out the map.  I heard that was fixed in the remaster but I've only played the Gamecube version."
patientgamers,39uinq,ElijahSnow27,2,Mon Jun 15 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"ALTTP, the original and Skyward Sword, for me, but I have yet to try the gameboy games which look amazing and no one ever mentions. I couldn't really get into WW's aesthetics."

I thought it was outclassed by the competition on release and I cannot possibly see your point of view.  It's the only Zelda game that I've been unable to replay, and believe me, I've tried.  It's just a horribly awkward and incredibly ugly game with none of the trademark Zelda charm.  Easily the worst in the franchise.  Even worse than Zelda 2.  Much, much worse than Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks.  I absolutely recommend skipping.  One of the top 3 most overrated games of all time (for those wondering, they are Ocarina of Time, Red Dead Redemption, and Halo)."

The hardest part of the game is fighting the camera.  Combat is always a tedious chore because it's very easy but it's also very time consuming.  The side tasks are very poorly developed and some side activities like the poe hunt rank among my worst gameplay moments of all time, trying to shoot the bow while riding on Epona is a horrible experience.    They basically lifted the entire structure and even most individual puzzles from ALTTP, so if you've played that then it feels bizarrely familiar.  Oh, an unlit torch, I bet I have to shoot an arrow through a lit torch to light it.  Oh, an eyeball marker over a doorway, probably have to shoot it.  Etc.  It feels like an awkard attempt to remake ALttP in 3D, but they weren't sure how to go about 3D games so they made so many fundamental missteps that it's bafflling.    Absolutely up there in my ""most poorly aged games of all time"" list.  It has objectively aged poorly, so you can't just say ""it's aged incredibly well to me"" without even beginning to attempt to justify that statement and hope it sticks.  I have given actual reasons for why it's aged poorly.  You haven't.  You said absolutely nothing in your post."

The top of my list will be Starcraft 1 & 2, but to someone that doesn't like RTS games, they wouldn't even be on their list.  OoT was a huge disappointment for me.  I didn't play it years after release, I waited in the frigid cold at 3 in the morning to play the game on the day of release.  I had been waiting for years.  A Link to the Past was pretty much my favorite game outside of possibly Super Metroid and I had played it at least 10 times by the time Ocarina of Time came out.  To say that I was excited would be a massive understatement.  Then I played the game.  The first thing I noticed was that the music was a huge flying leap backwards.  Then I noticed how the gameplay felt bloated and cumbersome.  I noticed how the game didn't have perfect controls like ALttP, that it instead had awkward and clunky controls (totally unlike a similar game that came out a year later on the PS1, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver which was a radically superior game to Ocarina of Time on every level).  I noticed that the clever overworld had been replaced with a dull and boring open area that had nothing in it.  How they added pointlessly boring nonsense like fishing.  Etc. Etc. Etc.  I beat Ocarina of Time with ease.  I didn't have to think about any puzzles, they had just stolen the Tomb Raider block pushing puzzles (which were insanely tedious before Ocarina of Time even released) and shoved them into a world populated with mostly the exact same puzzles we had already seen in A Link to the Past.  They made the musical instrument segment much more cumbersome, requiring memorization of simple tunes and then jamming them out over and over again.  And don't get me started on the stupid ""you need to buy a guide to know this shit"" garbage like that scarecrow you have to make up a melody for.  FUCK THAT.  And fuck that racing minigame.  Fuck the poe hunting minigame.  Fuck how the final boss was just one phase of one of the earliest bosses in A Link to the Past.  Fuck how easy the game is.  How combat wasn't a test of player skill, it was a test of player patience.  A Link to the Past wasn't the hardest game, but it still had me stumped from time to time and I still had to learn some bosses.  That is not true for OoT.  I was never stumped.  I never had to think.  It was just rote repetition.  If OoT existed in a vacuum it would've been more impressive.  But it came out over a year after we'd already had one of the best Zelda style games of all time come out on the PS1 (Alundra) which showed how the 2D style could still be used to make an amazing game.  We would see in less than a year how that style of world design and dungeon design could be used to make a truly brain twisting game with a crazy good story (Soul Reaver).    The only part in OoT that sticks out in my memory as something I really liked was exploring Kakariko Village.  Otherwise it had way too much bullshit and overly cumbersome mechanics.  It was a ridiculously easy game and a very boring one.  I wouldn't put it in my top 100.  The Zelda games I would put in my top 100 are A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening.  None of the rest would be on that list."
patientgamers,39uinq,ElijahSnow27,3,Mon Jun 15 04:49:14 2015 UTC,"Any list will be entirely subjective.   But you just told someone ""It's not even in the running for top 100, are you serious? "" ...that seems pretty assertive to me.  Well other than that, I can't say, since I haven't given the game enough time, but the whole ""existing in a vacuum"" thing; I think for many it did. It was likely their first Zelda game and so they were blown away by the universe. ALTTP set up that universe.  Edit: so I'm inclined to agree. At least enough to say that the admiration for OoT is probably overstated."

OoT IS clunky, plagued by badness of the N64 (and I LOVE the N64 if only for GoldenEye and Perfect Dark). I think they re-released it on 3GS, so that might have improved things. But you're right. I never played OoT until about 4-5 years ago and while it seemed better than most other N64 games, it didn't have the Nostalgia buffer there telling me it was ""the best game evar!"". And so it was clearly a little clunky. Still is a great game in it's own right, but the N64 is a crappy platform and hasn't aged well. And A link to the past is the most iconic."

It has the old-school look of the NES/SNES titles, while being more narrative-heavy than the games for the NES. I think it gets overshadowed by A Link to the Past, which is unfortunate because, to me, Link's Awakening has the stronger story. You can get it in the 3ds store, IIRC."

I haven't played any of the others, so I can't comment on those.  Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks are a sort of trilogy of games, so I wouldn't play Phantom Hourglass until after you beat Wind Waker.

patientgamers,39uinq,The16BitGamer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:50:54 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong. Just saying those are the only 3 Zelda games I have played. I think Link Between Worlds is a better showcase to the portable Zelda games then Links Awakening.
patientgamers,39uinq,Limond,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:29:32 2015 UTC,Links Awakening was my first be I agree that A link between worlds is better. However I personally wouldn't start off with it.

It really lacked in the narrative department though, which is a really strong part of the Zelda series. It's not one I would prioritize to a newcomer unless they were already looking for a new 3DS game to play."

I don't know how well recent consoles are emulated, so that's probably going to be a limiting factor. Here's the pros and cons of the main episodes that I think you will see suggested here.  Twilight Princess, Wii or GameCube  Pros: Very well rounded game, and very Zelda-ish. Probably the strongest recent entry in the series. Great character design, great dungeons. Basically can't go wrong with it.  Cons: I don't know how well GameCube or Wii emulators work.  Wind Waker, GameCube (or Wii U if you play the HD reedition)  Pros: Superb game. Strongest ending in the entire series. Original setting. Genuine feel of adventures and exploration in a large universe. Combat feels great.  Cons: I don't know how well GameCube emulators work. Not as Zelda-ish as others. Kind of short, and there's an annoying fetch quest toward the end.  Link's Awakening, GameBoy or GameBoy Color  Pros: Superb game. Very easy to get into. Very memorable ending. Very Zelda-ish.  Cons: Big pixels. Doesn't hold your hand and you will get lost. A little more difficult than more recent games.  Ocarina of Time, N64  Pros: THE legendary episode. Very Zelda-ish. Very well rounded. Contains some of the most legendary dungeons, bosses, characters. Can also be purchased in a remastered 3DS version.  Cons: Graphics haven't aged well. Contains that ONE fucking Water Temple. First 3D entry in the series and not 100% as smooth in gameplay as later titles. Basically (I know this will be a controversial opinion :)) Twilight Princess is a better Ocarina of Time than Ocarina of Time.  Majora's Mask, N64  Pros: Truly gripping setting. Very strong scenario and themes. One of the best entries in the series.  Can also be purchased in a remastered 3DS version.  Cons: Fairly un-Zelda-like. Somewhat depressing. The game deliberately instills a feeling of pointlessness to your actions that makes for a very strong narrative, but can be a bit hard to bear.  In conclusion, I'd probably try them in the order I listed above, but really, it's your call. They're all fantastic games, and really, you can't go wrong either way. And, really -- if you can, play them all. :)"
patientgamers,39uinq,Balinares,2,Mon Jun 15 03:28:16 2015 UTC,Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks are... not great. I'd avoid them.   What didn't you like about them?
patientgamers,39uinq,GospelX,2,Mon Jun 15 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"A whole bunch of things.  PH suffers from being a Wind Waker sequel that profoundly fails to live up to its ancestor. Between the two games, Zelda went from her most badass incarnation back to a damsel in distress. The world went from huge and rewarding to explore to tiny and very empty. The combat went from dynamic and rewarding to just meh. The dungeon are uninspired, and for a Zelda, that's a near deal-breaker. And the dreadful Temple of the Ocean King that you have to do over and over and over again. In limited time, with sections that punish you for running. Ugh. I feel that Kurt Vonnegut's Rule 0, though initially meant for writers, applies very well to video game: ""Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted."" PH liked to waste my time, and that's as close to a cardinal sin as exists in video games, to me.  ST was a step up from PH. The universe felt bigger and denser, the train thing was novel and intriguing... and then it fell into the trap of meh dungeons and a plot that was hard to care about. Zelda is marginally more useful, but still basically little more than a pretext. By the end I was just bored, and only finished it so I could be done with it. I won't play it again, but I do remember it a little more fondly than PH. So there's that."
patientgamers,39uinq,Balinares,2,Mon Jun 15 03:34:33 2015 UTC,"Fair criticisms. Spirit Tracks ranks near the bottom when it comes to my list of Zelda games, but Phantom Hourglass is near the top. I'm in the minority here, but I loved the Temple of the Ocean King. It brought what was essentially a Metroidvania element to just one portion of a game, which I thought was a neat twist on the formula. I thought the dungeons were alright, as were the puzzles. (My god, that puzzle where you had to move the stamp from a map to your own copy of the map unfortunately took me longer to figure out than it should have.) In my view, it was a very solid game."
patientgamers,39uinq,GospelX,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"Note that I deliberately left out the old 2D episodes except Link's Awakening. They're good, but the gameplay required a lot more trial and error and wandering around than would be common nowadays, which may not be what OP is after, if I read the question correctly. (Link's Awakening gets a pass for not being as bad, and being fairly easy to get into, but even so.)"
patientgamers,39uinq,Balinares,3,Mon Jun 15 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to play the newer ones, you can emulate Skyward Sword, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess with the Wii/GameCube emulator Dolphin. You can play the GC versions of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess with a USB gamepad, but you'll need an actual Wiimote (with MotionPlus!) and a Bluetooth dongle on your PC to play Skyward Sword - Dolphin has emulated Wiimote movements via mouse, but it's practically unusable. You really want a real wiimote if you're planning on playing through SS.   If I had to suggest playing them in a particular order, I'd say TP>WW>SS. TP was a good game, but wasn't exactly amazing at anything in particular. Wind Waker was a step up from that - Lots of people initially scoffed at the art style, but it is now widely considered to be one of the best modern games in the series... (Except for that damned triforce hunt at the very end of the game...) Finally, Skyward Sword is a great way to finish out the modern games - It is a very love-it-or-hate-it game; Many people claim SS as their personal favorite, while others found it nearly unbearable and never got past the second dungeon.  That being said though... You're missing out on a lot by not playing the older games. Don't think that they're ""bad"" just because they have pixelated graphics - A Link to the Past is easily one of the best games in the series, and is an excellent place to start, and is closely followed by Ocarina of Time. Then, if you're looking for something slightly different, Majora's Mask offers a much darker game (almost like Twilight Princess) while maintaining OoT's awesome gameplay.  Also, I found Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks nearly unplayable. If you enjoy them then more power to you... But I couldn't get past the awful controls. Seriously, those games will give you carpel tunnel."

All the other games are fair game and I strongly suggest playing the rest of them. It really doesn't matter which one you pick because I think they all offer a good adventure. However, I do recommend starting with Link to the Past or Ocarina of Time. Those two are the best games of the series and every single game afterwards follows closely in their footsteps.  I'd still recommend checking out the first Zelda game on the NES. Yeah it's old and tough but there is an open world aspect that hasn't been seen in any other Zelda game. I think it's worth playing once you have tried all the other Zelda games."

patientgamers,39uinq,The16BitGamer,2,Mon Jun 15 22:55:04 2015 UTC,"Link to the Past is a must play. It is amazing. Legend of Zelda is a great NES game, but if you didn't play it, I don't know that you would be missing much. I will say that you appreciate the advances in the art. And I do think Legend of Zelda is a fun game. you get a feel for how link operates with the sword, heart pieces, etc. But Link to the Past is truly one of the best games I've ever played. After that I would play Ocarina of Time, then Majora's Mask.     I think Twilight Princess is really fun, but if you skip it, no big deal.    I never played skyward sword, so I can't comment on it.    I think Windwaker is really nice. if you can play the HD remake on WiiU, I think it'd probably be a better experience, but i didn't play that version, so i can't say for sure.     I think you could probably skip legend of zelda 2 on the NES, but it's a fun game, just VERY different from LoZ 1."
patientgamers,39uinq,docbauies,2,Tue Jun 16 00:04:09 2015 UTC,"I never played skyward sword, so I can't comment on it.    It was an okay game... I enjoyed the story much more than the gameplay, personally.  Due to the motion controls, however, I would not recommend it as the first Zelda game for a new player to try out.  The motion controls, for me at least, were fun and novel at first but turned out to be incredibly difficult to use due to the level of precision that was required to dispatch even the most basic enemies (don't even get me started on the boss battles). Sadly I was never able to fully master the controls, making Skyward Sword one of the most challenging Zelda experiences I've ever had, but not in a good way.  Flying the loftwing was great fun though!"
patientgamers,39uinq,aheadwarp9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:54:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly found the sword fighting much easier if I just waited a bit before attacking. As in, lining up a horizontal strike, then waiting 3-5 seconds for the enemy to make it so my attack would work. Then you can just spam attacks which will kill them.   That worked a lot better for me than looking and saying, ""Oh, I need to attack from left to right!"" because the moment I did that, they'd switch their stance and I'd fail."
patientgamers,39uinq,puppymehard,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:36:40 2015 UTC,"For me the issue was mostly the controller was registering a lot of ""swings"" that were not really me swinging my sword but repositioning my hand to make the correct swing... it was super annoying and caused me no end of trouble.  I liked the near 1:1 sword movement in other aspects, but the controls just weren't right.  Until the motion control technology improves, I'll take my future Zeldas with regular buttons and sticks please."
patientgamers,39uinq,aheadwarp9,2,Mon Jun 15 14:47:14 2015 UTC,I recommend Ocarnia of Time and Majoras mask on either n64 Wii shop channel or the 3ds remakes!
patientgamers,39uinq,Fexal,2,Mon Jun 15 02:46:32 2015 UTC,"A bit late to the party; but i'd like to weigh in on this subject.  I would recommend starting with A link to the past.  Amazing game for the SNES.   From there, if you wish to go forward; Play ocarina of time (Best played on the N64, playing on the 3DS its still an amazing game, but didn't feel right)      You can also play Majora's Mask, another great game, but this one can be hit or miss with a lot of people.   If you wish to play earlier games, I recommend Link's Awakening. This is the game that got me hooked on the franchise.    Games I wouldn't suggest starting out with would be the original zelda (great game, but doesn't accurately portray the popularity of the franchise, imo) or Zelda II: The Adventures of Link. This game plays alot differently than the rest of the franchise. It's still enjoyable, but not would I would recommend.   Happy Gaming!"
patientgamers,39uinq,RoyalNewb,2,Mon Jun 15 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"ITT: Almost every single Zelda game is a classic in its own right and worth a play.  The two games that stand above the rest for me are:   A Link to the Past (SNES - rereleases on Gameboy Advance, Wii, Wii U) Ocarina of Time (N64 - rereleases on Gamecube, Wii, 3DS). The 3DS remaster of Ocarina was a stellar modernization of the game, though the original still holds up today.   As far as recent games go:   Skyward Sword (Wii) was a strong entry in the series, but motion controls are pretty central to the game - emulation may be tricky. A Link Between Worlds (3DS) is a good game but it's not really standout, in my opinion. It's very reminiscent of A Link to the Past - it's set in the same world and draws on similar parallel universe mechanics. Phantom Hourglass (DS) and Spirit Tracks (DS). I haven't played either game so I can't really recommend them. I've heard that Phantom Hourglass is a little 'dumbed down', so to speak, but I honestly don't know.   The Zelda series doesn't really have an overarching plot. Or rather, each game is largely independent of the rest of the series - they don't contain spoilers, or depend on previous knowledge of the storyline. This means you can pretty much start wherever."
patientgamers,39uinq,Tyrren,2,Mon Jun 15 03:30:28 2015 UTC,"If you want the more 'traditional' Zelda then something like Ocarina of Time might be in order. If you want the slightly altered experience, try Minish Cap or Link Awakening DX (available on the 3DS eshop and an absolute gem).   I like them all, but Minish Cap is my favourite Zelda game because I particularly like the tone and the characters you meet along the way. I believe this is also on the eshop. Buy at your leisure, OP."
patientgamers,39uinq,tardmancer,2,Mon Jun 15 03:25:57 2015 UTC,"Minish Cap is fine, it's built off a stronger framework than the early 3D Zelda games, which are among the most poorly aging games of all time.  I would recommend avoiding the 3D Zelda games as a whole, but it you must, then they are each better than the one before it.  Skyward Sword is easily the best."
patientgamers,39uinq,ButteredPaincakes,2,Mon Jun 15 09:10:44 2015 UTC,I stand by the decision that Link's Awakening is one of the best LoZ games to have ever been made. Definitely play that.
patientgamers,39uinq,Oathkeeper89,2,Mon Jun 15 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"The best way to start is with A Link to The Past, if you have a hacked PSP you can install an emulator for SNES or GBA and play it that way. I recommend SNES just for better key bindings. A Link to The Past firmly establishes a lot of Zelda traditions that go throughout the series, once you finish this game I would recommend the 3DS Game A Link Betweeen Worlds, a sequel to the SNES game and a damn fine game in its own rights.  If your not burned out by this point, the next best option is Ocarina of Time on Gamecube or 3DS and follow that up with Majora's Mask.   After these games which are the best starter selection, you can move onto the handheld Zeldas, Links Awakening, Oracle games and Minish Cap.  Then you are ready for the best 3D Zelda game ever, The Wind Waker which is timeless graphics wise and a lot of fun to boot. You can follow this up with Twilight Princess. The Zelda games a great fun but if you play them all in order in a short time, you will notice the similiarities and get bored of them. Play then with long breaks between games so you enjoy them properly."
patientgamers,39uinq,space_cowboy80,2,Mon Jun 15 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"I was in exactly your position a few years ago. Here were my thoughts on the three I tried:  Link to the Past (emulated SNES): It was quite fun, but I'm not fond of pixel art either, and it wasn't so compelling that I finished the game. Still, it's worth some time with a good emulator.  Ocarina of Time (emulated N64): Disappointing. I think OoT, like many games of its generation, was designed to be a timesink (I never would have found Saria without a walkthrough or a lot of time to wander aimlessly), and all the wandering around trying to figure out where I'm meant to go really tried my patience. I might have liked that if I were a kid with a lot of time on my hands, but alas, I am not. Plus, there were some unintuitive moments that showed its age (e.g. it took ages to figure out that I burn the spider web in the Deku tree by lighting a torch and rolling over it), and the Water Temple is simply not fun.  Twilight Princess (Gamecube): Wonderful. It's the Ocarina of Time formula with excellent execution. It's perfectly accessible for a newcomer, the level design is very smart, the art direction is beautiful, the characters are genuinely interesting, the combat is fluid, and it's one of my favorite games ever."

patientgamers,39uinq,RoarShock,2,Mon Jun 15 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that Ocarina of Time has not aged particularly well... but I can't think of a more quintessential Zelda game.  It literally embodies all that I think of when I think of this style of action/adventure game.  Some of the puzzles were less intuitive back in the day, sure... that's just the nature of how games were made back then, but you know what else?  Strategy guides were also a lot more popular back then too...  These days you can just go to the internet though if you need help getting past a particular puzzle, or need a hint for where to go next, so I don't think that should be a limiting factor for any game."

I see your point, but there wasn't a good solution for me. Playing without a walkthrough was too tedious, and playing with a walkthrough open on my other monitor was awful for pacing. I like the adventuring and exploring of Zelda games, and stopping to check the guide took the focus off of the adventuring and wrecked the flow. I never needed a walkthrough for Twilight Princess, and the experience was much better for it."

For those of us who are completionists, it can be a huge time-saver even if it pulls you out of the action a bit.  To each their own I suppose!

If you don't like the 2D Ocarina of time 3D for the 3DS.  DO NOT PLAY ANY ORIGINAL DS ZELDA GAMES ITS GAMEPLAY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT"
patientgamers,39uinq,The16BitGamer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:56:29 2015 UTC,Start with ocarina of time or majoras mask both on the n64. not sure if theyve been said already... Reddit sync doesnt always load comments.
patientgamers,39uinq,gaap1343,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"No, don't start with Phantom Hourglass, because to my understanding that game was made as more of a sequel to Wind Waker for the Gamecube.  So I would recommend playing Wind Waker first before Phantom Hourglass, though I have not played PH so don't take my word for it.  Wind Waker was an excellent game though, and definitely high up on my list of Zelda games.  It has an HD remake for the WiiU, but I think the Gamecube version holds up quite well... the Gamecube graphics don't really look that old yet IMO.  To be honest, I wouldn't even consider Minish Cap to be that old (wasn't that a DS title?)  I should probably mention that I sadly have not played any of the mobile Zeldas, as the last mobile game system I owned was the original Gameboy.  I am still a big fan of the franchise though, as I've played everything from A Link to the Past up to Skyward Sword on their respective consoles (technically ALttP was on an emulator).  My favorite, as is the case for many Zelda fans, was Ocarina of Time... although that may be due strictly to nostalgia.  The N64 version has not held up particularly well, but it is still playable if you want to give it a try on an N64 emulator.  Thankfully that game has recently been remade for the 3DS (Plus Majora's Mask, the second N64 Zelda title, has just had the same treatment).  As for a place to start... tough question.  If you're using emulators, it might be best to try and start with an N64 or Gamecube title as I don't know how well Wii emulators are working currently...  I still highly recommend Ocarina of Time, as that is where I started and instantly fell in love with all things Zelda.  I did eventually go back and play A Link to the Past on my ZSNES emulator, which was certainly fun, but a word of caution: it is quite a bit more difficult than any of the ""3D"" Zelda games that came after.  Still, it is exceptionally well made and if you do get into Zelda in a more serious way, you really should play it at some point, but don't feel like you have to start there just because it came before most of the others.  If the N64 games look too dated to you, then the next logical starting place may be Wind Waker or Twilight Princess, the two Gamecube Zelda titles.  You may be aware of this already if you've done your research, but Wind Waker is also a distinctly different art style than most of the other Zelda games (except for Minish Cap, which came right after it).  While I don't think this difference should be in any way relevant in choosing a starting place, it is still something to keep in mind when you move on to the next game.  TL;DR - I'd suggest Ocarina of Time as a starting place... especially if you have a 3DS and can get your hands on the updated version.  If that's too dated now, then move on to Wind Waker and/or Twilight Princess to get you started.  If you have an affinity for more retro style games, then you should definitely start with A Link to the Past.  Edit: typos"
patientgamers,39uinq,aheadwarp9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:18:41 2015 UTC,"Can agree on most people on here, starting with Alttp and going over to OoT. Both are fairly similiar and established the formula for following games.   If you finished these games you can go to either Majoras Mask if you're up for some bizarre but really intense atmosphere and the constant threat of the end of the world. Or you can go for Wind Waker if you want some more light hearted adventure. The (purely) mobile Zeldas are pretty much all on the lighthearted side if that's more up your alley. It wasn't really a thing for me, couldn't bring myself to finish oracle of ages for example.  Twilight Princess is pretty much OoT 2.0 with some of the best dungeons of the franchise and some pretty good ideas overall - but imo it really fell flat in the last quarter of the game where it became such a mess that I can't rate it as highly as other titles. Still one of the better zeldas. Most of the games take a little while to really get going so don't get your expectations up too high that the first 2 hours will totally blow you away or anything - with maybe AlttP being the exception."
patientgamers,39uinq,punikun,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say Ocarina of Time. It's essentially the basis of all other games in the genre (not just Zelda).  It doesn't have the best story, graphics etc. anymore, but it got essentially a bit of everything in there and is a good place to start."
patientgamers,39uinq,JFKcaper,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:16:55 2015 UTC,"Late to the party but feel it has to be said, if you don't play Link to the Past you're missing out on an important game in the LoZ franchise. I really feel that LttP is where Nintendo figured out exactly what LoZ was going to be. Any LoZ game made after that is going to have some element of LttP in the back of its mind. LttP is an absolute must."

It looks much better than it's N64 predecessors and contains all the classic elements that make Zelda games great. The art style is beautiful, the characters are charming, and the gameplay is well-refined and very fun.

patientgamers,39uinq,NekoiNemo,0,Mon Jun 15 08:44:56 2015 UTC,"What systems do you have? If you have NES, at least get the original. If SNES, get Link to the Past. If N64, get Ocarina of Time. Maybe Majora's Mask - sorry guys, but I'm playing through MM now, and it's more inflexible than most games in saving. All it takes is one power brain fart, and everything you did - run through Snowhead, get the song to open Snowhead, win the Spring races - is gone.  It's worrisome. You want to do much, but you really got to be careful about doing too much. Strangely, not as enjoyable as it used to be for me - then again, back in the day, half the fun for me was re-enacting the Goron/Hylian War at Romani Ranch with full stocks of Arrows, Powder Kegs/Bombs, and the various masks.  Got Gameboy? Get Link's Awakening. GBA? Minish Cap works. Gamecube? Wind Waker might not be your thing, but I thought it was alright. Twilight Princess I'm mixed on - characters felt more human than most others, and you're not alone in saving Hyrule for once, but it feels largely like an OoT fanfic.  Also, there's no real order to the series. You can pick up any one of them and play it.  And for what it's worth, I could not get through Phantom Hourglass. Something about having to use all stylus, which I don't like."

The story was also good and if anything, I thought it was a little bit better than 1 in that it wasn't an exercise in futility (where the bad guy was actually not there the whole time you were slogging through the town for SO long).  I guess what I wanna know is, what exactly turns people off about MW2 in terms of the singleplayer.  Could it be that 1 is just good because it didn't have such a tough act to follow?"

That said, I really recommend Tales of Graces f for the ps3. Fun combat system, nice story, good looking graphics, good voice acting (for the most part), and enjoyable characters (Pascal is one of my favorite characters of all times). Also, this is the first time in the series where the english version has voiced lines for the Skit Scenes, and they even joke about it (previously, the japanese versions had voiced skit scenes, but the english versions all just removed the voices)."

patientgamers,39ul8l,countblah2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't played many games in the series, so I can't really tell you where to start.  However, I did play Tales of the Abyss and liked it a lot back then. Easily one of my favorite ps2 games, I finished it 7 times, and even made a walkthrough on GameFAQs (it's in portuguese, though). This game in particular seems to be hit or miss, though. Most people I know either love it or absolutely hate it.  If you don't mind playing older games, Tales of Destiny on the ps1 is really good. I played this a long long time ago, though, so I don't remember much.  Keep in mind that these games are usually really long, especially if you're the completionist type, and usually a lot of sidequests are missable.  Also, there are usually a lot of references and/or cameos in the series (you can fight main characters from previous games in a lot of them, in fact; one of the most challenging and fun battles in Tales of the Abyss is against a group of 4 characters from previous games). You don't need to know the previous games to enjoy these, but it makes it more satisfying when you do."

You'll have to sneak, attack enemies, or solve simple puzzles to get through the trenches, POW camps, and European countryside with four main characters (3 soldiers and a nurse) who you control depending on the story and situation.  You also get real historical facts about what happened in World War 1 with real pictures and descriptions.  It was already a flash sale 2 days ago, where it dropped down to $3.74, so I'm not sure if it'll go on sale for that price again or not in this sale but I'd say it's worth checking out at $3.74."

Of the 12, about 7 or more of them has serious stories of which you can spend the entire 2nd half of the game fleshing them out.  The story as a whole is also worth getting into.  Raidant Historia is an RPG about Time Travel.  Basically, a mac-guffin allows you to manipulate events and see perspectives of so many different characters.  There's also the mystery behind the time travelling itself which fleshes your own protagonist quite nicely.  There's also a few sidequests and NPC fluff that as you expect requires some kind of time traveling to complete."

I can't vouch for the other in the series and hope others here can help me out.  Final Fantasy Tactics's characters may not fill the bill (They're a little blend in a way) but the story make it my favorite Final Fantasy game.

If you like Fire Emblem, you might also like Final Fantasy Tactics, it has optional story characters than you can grow to love and pick which you use, if any.  Dishonored's Corvo can also be pretty great even though you control his actions, after all the shit he goes through, he's a really cool character that gets developped by your actions.

Plus IMO it's a game where you have to set your own goals to have fun long term, which to me is not a good thing.  Civ is different. Maps and enwmies are randomly generated, so every game is potentially different, and with more than a dozen of civs to choose from you will have literally hundreds of hours of play.   It's also incredibly accessible. I play most Paradox strategy games, and by comparison Civ is much more streamlined and visible. With a pretty good tutorial to booth.   My vote's solidly on Civ."

Thing is: 1. That's pretty circular. Build up your Prison to get money to build an even bigger prison to get more money. I know that's the point of the game, but it gets stale after awhile. 2. AFAIK the goals are always the same, so it gets stale even faster starting up new maps just to hit the same goals again and again. The only way to make it fun is to make up your own goals. (Reach x goal in z amount of time, or ignore d and e goals this time around. Stuff like that.)  Civ is also guilty of this after a point (after dozens and dozens of hours honestly) but the sheer amount of content gives you infinite possibilities to try and make your own goals.

patientgamers,39uvar,Junoh315,3,Mon Jun 15 02:38:49 2015 UTC,That's the one I went with.
patientgamers,39uvar,BadWhippet,2,Mon Jun 15 02:55:45 2015 UTC,They are both great.  My bias is for Civ 5.  Civ 5 will be the 'One More Turn' game it has always been.  PA is more casual; You can leave and come back and you wont need 30+ minutes just to get back up to speed on what going on
patientgamers,39uvar,Strazdas1,2,Mon Jun 15 04:03:47 2015 UTC,I think I've put more time into one sitting of Civ 5 than I have total play time of Prison Architect.
patientgamers,39uvar,NekoiNemo,2,Mon Jun 15 07:17:15 2015 UTC,"Aw, Prison Architect is the EASY winner for me here.  Civ 5 is great and all that, but Prison Architect is just one of those rare gems that sucks away your time.  I was surprised that, out of 500 games, I have the most played hours in this title (over 400 hours) despite me being a die-hard replay fanatic (Dishonored replayed some 20 times, Mass Effect many times etc).  If you act quick, it is still Â£2.99, but only for today I believe (under ""yesterday's deals"")."
patientgamers,39uvar,Minifig81,2,Mon Jun 15 10:31:18 2015 UTC,"well, that depends on what you like. the two games are VERY different.   Prison architect is top down business simulator where the business is a prison. if you want business management, buy that one.  Civ 5 is a history-spanning turn based simulator of empires. completely different beast."

patientgamers,39uie9,Strazdas1,5,Mon Jun 15 11:58:24 2015 UTC,"Far Cry 1 is the most different of all the Far Crys. Crytek made this one, whereas Ubisoft made all the others. Playing it now... ehhh... it's okay. It was great back when it was new, but now, you might as well play Crysis, which is better in almost all aspects. It might be worth playing to see the lineage of the series, though."
patientgamers,39uie9,ShhImHiding,2,Mon Jun 15 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's the best of the FC games but the only thing it has in common with FC3 is the jungle atmosphere.   I'm really just posting this to say that I think the stealth is quite fair. It only seems unreasonable because subsequent shooters are heavily skewed in favor of the player. People seem to think it's ""god-like"" that an enemy can spot you from the same distance that you can spot him."
patientgamers,39uie9,donwallo,2,Tue Jun 16 06:50:31 2015 UTC,"Man, not many people ever played FC1.  But I have, and I even beat it.  Farcry 1 is a strange beast, because even though it is a fairly linear game the areas are so large you FEEL as though they are open, which is nice.  The other thing that the game does very well is enemy AI, which at the time was top of the line and probably holds up well today (they say that the last best FPS AI was in FEAR, a couple years after FC1).  The game was beautiful when it released and you needed a serious rig to play it; it probably still looks very good, and is one of very few games (and was the very first, I believe) to provide a convincing tropical environment.  The game was also really fucking hard.  Should you play the first?  You shouldn't feel obliged to play it, it's nothing like 2 and 3 (though has a lot in common with the console FC1 derivatives like Instinct), but it is a good FPS and a mostly forgotten part of gaming history."

It was experimental at best.  Doesn't make it a bad game though, it's just different.  And for alot of modern gamers, has not aged well."
patientgamers,39uie9,hritter,2,Mon Jun 15 05:41:02 2015 UTC,"I played Far Cry back when it was the only Far Cry and while I love 2-4, it took me a while to warm up to them. In the first one, I was one a beautiful Island, it was one of the best games I'd ever seen. It was hard, it was compelling, and then the gimmick kicked in. YOur character evolves to the point of being able to run, jump, maul, and hunt like a feral beast. It's fucking amazing. Then I got Far Cry 2 and they replaced Beast Mode with ""Press Y to take Malaria Pills.""  Ever since then, every new information I hear about any Far Cry game, I hope they brought back the evolution aspect. It's worth playing just for that."
patientgamers,39uie9,WW4O,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:07:27 2015 UTC,Got it last year in a bundle. Okay for it's age. Pretty cheesy dialog. As far as the story goes it has nothing at all to do with the sequels if that's your concern.
patientgamers,39uie9,NvrConvctd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:29:34 2015 UTC,"Its a good game. however do remmeber that Far Cry 1 (and its expansions, official and unofficial) is a linear shooter. So its quite different from the later games in the series.  Id say its a very different game from 3 and closer to 2 (but far better), so take that as you will."
patientgamers,39uie9,Strazdas1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"It definitely shows its age at this point. I played it before any other Far Cry games so I didn't have anything to compare it to, but I think you'll be disappointed after having played 3. The mechanics are clunky and even on Normal difficulty it's pretty hard. Enemies can spot you far before you can spot them making stealth near impossible. For being ""open world"" it's fairly linear as there are no side quests or collectibles making exploring a dangerous waste of time. The story is decent but forgettable as are all the characters.  I don't regret buying or playing it but again, that was before I played 3. Like /u/ShhImHiding said, you'd be better off playing Crysis. It's what Far Cry could have and should have been and is a far more enjoyable open world set on an island FPS."

I tend to have ""gaming ADHD"", where I'll play a game for a few days, switch to another one, and then another one, and then get back to the other game weeks later. I've heard that in SoD, your game keeps running while you're gone, meaning shit can go to hell. Is it really that bad?"
patientgamers,39tlse,drummererb,2,Sun Jun 14 18:29:59 2015 UTC,State of decay is mildly entertaining but I found it ultimately boring. There's no real tension or threat and everything kind of feels pointless and the same after an hour or two of play time. YMMV
patientgamers,39tlse,WikipediaHasAnswers,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:57:13 2015 UTC,"I could never finish it. It has permadeath FYI, which is ok as I've played games with permadeath before.  The base building is minimal.  You collect enough resources and order your group of survivors to build a new section to your base and they do it for you.  There is no real crafting system like in most survival games, just collecting loot and weapons here and there.    The most annoying aspect for me is all of the quests you will be bombarded with.  I like to finish all the sidequests in games so it was frustrating that you could be on your way to work on 1 quest and get bombarded with 3 more quests before you could even finish the 1st.  And some of them are timed events meaning you either do it within a certain time or they disappear.   Ultimately it was a decent game, but it couldn't hold my attention that long."

patientgamers,39tlse,kymess_jr,2,Sun Jun 14 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"Day 4 of the Steam Summer sale:  FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying. It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it. NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.

It could've been good, if you actually had any incentive to swap clothes in any portion of the game that isn't the main story.  But there is none.  Why would you ever change clothes in your spare time?  To collect things?  The treasures you find are indiscernible from each other and bland at best with nary a description and serve only to increase a percentage in your personal Animus.  To take advantage of their unique skills?  The civilian dress is more or less useless.  The beggar is just assassin on easy mode.  And the assassin is all you'll ever need for even the most tricky of collectibles.  For Sidequests?  Oh you mean like the ones that finish upon transferring pts A to B?  How how bout the ones where you ""incite rebellion"" by going around and talking to people AKA staying in place and pushing a button.  Unlike Black Flag, none of the sidequests are actually fun and all seem to pursue some common idea that is never expanded upon.  Heck even the parts of the main story that use the different costumes is stupid.  I will admit that there was one part where the Dress got really useful and awesome, but the rest was just fluff."

They all follow a very similar formula; this just happens to be one of the worst at it. I haven't played IV or past yet, but to me ACII is still the best, though ACIII is a very close personal second because I loved the wilderness and homestead.   As an example of how the main series games are better, the bayou in Liberation is basically severely stripped-down version of the frontier in ACIII. The frontier has hunting, far more environment variation, more towns and enemy forts, and random events that aren't present in the bayou."

But really, you should play II or III for the best Assassin experience.  If you just like the Open Worldliness and hate stealth, get Black Flag.

In GTASA you got no respect until the ending. In GTAV you had no respect from anyone outside your circle until the ending.

patientgamers,39ut4y,sparksfx,4,Mon Jun 15 00:03:41 2015 UTC,"Everyone says it has unlikable characters but I had stronger reactions to characters in IV than I did in V. V had really generic characters IMO.   In terms of sandbox, it's definitely inferior. One of my only gripes with GTAIV is that it's just all city. GTAV has the ocean, the city, the mountains, the desert. And also the modding on GTAIV is abysmal. Not the actual mods but the process of it all. Getting mods to work on GTAIV is a real long drawn out process.   Imo, GTAIV is a whole different ballpark compared to V. But, the handling on IV is better (another unpopular opinion, because people say everything feels like a boat, but that's because cars are 2k+ pounds IRL). The story is barely comparable, but they both follow GTA's usual theme where .   My real advice, save your money and just try to upgrade your PC for GTAV. It has much more to do and it looks nicer. Can't comment on how GTAV mods, but even without mods on my console version of GTAV, I spent at least 2x the amount of time I spent on GTAIV, and I got both games on their respective release dates for Xbox 360."

Nothing stood out to me. In GTAIV the whole story stood out because it was a new take on GTA. It was gritty. The story was about discovering the American Dream and realizing that the American Dream is made up. 5 was ""Hey rob these banks, work for these assholes and then do the same thing that every GTA has you do."" It's not even like I'm over-simplifying it. That's all that it was. GTAV used the same old GTA formula and rolled it out flat like a ball of dough."

patientgamers,39ut4y,FallingSnowAngel,2,Mon Jun 15 08:36:08 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a fan of GTA IV. It tried too hard to be serious, but came off feeling bland. The world looked great (for the time) but felt lifeless and lacked a soul, and the story was boring - really boring. The initial trailers made Niko out to be someone with a very interesting and conflicted backstory but the story didn't live up to the promise, IMO, and neither did the world: there wasn't much reason to go into to even to mess around like with San An and V, or Vice City before those. I think part of that is because San Andreas had so much more variety and even Vice City wasn't all just ""cconcrete jungle"" like IV is. GTA IV feels like a chore.    The DLC is better, but not by much IMO. You'd do well to play the IV DLC if you want a bit of improvement to your V experience, but on the whole I'd say you can skip IV."

Unfortunately the PC port is bad and you would get better performance in GTA V than you would with GTA IV, spec for spec. If your PC can't even handle GTA V, then you have no hope getting IV to run. IV should still be quite playable on a current spec PC if you upgrade though. Get GTA VC and SA to fill the gap until you can enter the HD era."

Know anything about that?"
patientgamers,39uhdf,FredBGC,3,Sun Jun 14 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"It's a balancing issue with the patch. The system that determines the wealth of a provinces has been complety rewamp, and the Dlc addes the ability to improve provinces, and the game was rebalanced around that. For exampel, at the start of the game, the Holy Roman Empire is now really poor, and since small states concentrate their development, it will become richer throughout the game. That doesn't happen without the DLC, so the HRE will remain poor. That's my biggest issue with the patch, but other people dislike the changes to coring and the rewamped building system."
patientgamers,39uhdf,FredBGC,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that explanation!  If I picked up the game without Common Sense, as a new player, would you suggest just playing as it is now, or playing a previous patch?"

I just reached lvl59 last night, so I can use the next avatar now, which is something at least because I wasn't doing much damage even to regular mobs lately. the required xp to level is really getting out of hand too, and I hear it's even worse above 60. like 56 to 57 was about 50 million, 58 to 59 was 95m, 59-60 is 150m, and 60 to 61 is 1.5 billion (BILLION!). so I'm guessing I'll soon hit the stopping point because I sure as hell won't grind dungeons day and night, though I've also heard that 60+ story quests will take you more or less to 65, which sounds much better.  also, I found the official soundtrack on youtube. it's ok while playing, a bit generic, not many memorable pieces, except the one that plays in popolion. it's been weeks since I've been there but it kept coming back in my head, so I finally googled it. the ones playing in lumbertown and tralion are good too.  need for speed: hot pursuit (2010): I'm in the final third, more or less, about 30 events left of the 100+, and shit is starting to get real. there are a couple races right now I can't even bronze or finish in one piece. I guess I could grind others for better cars or something but I don't feel like it, so I'll just try and try again and hope the furniture around me won't break.  the 'action camera' is still pretty nice though. whenever you crash or you or your toys hit or eliminate someone, you get a short cutscene basically, which of course can be frustrating when you want to continue the damn race instead of losing precious seconds, but the race goes on while the cutscene plays, so no big loss. well, most of the time. if you do the damage, your car keeps driving itself, and not that badly either. like there's a roadblock ahead, someone crashes into it, cutscene, and when you get back control, you're past the block. although with faster cars, if the cutscene plays while or just before you're taking a turn, it may or may not be successful, and on a couple occasions I ended up heading for the wall when I got back behind the wheel. but even if you run over some spikes (which can be disabled by the jammer, as I found out accidentally), your car will spin until you're facing the right way, so it's not that frustrating. this all seems kind of cheaty, but not much you can do, that's the game."

I just cant figure out what to do. I also gave up on BIT.TRIP.RUNNER because i just can't get past the the odyssey level.

I know, I know, early access games aren't really part of the whole patient gamer thing, but it's been well over a year since I first heard about it and started salivating over it. And finally dipping below $5 yesterday, I just couldn't wait anymore!  So far it's proven to be a wise investment -- already got over 13 hours logged! I'm loving it. It's quite simple and  intricate all at the same time. My first prison turned into a complete mess really quickly since I couldn't figure out how to get the plumbing to work. With only one functioning showerhead for over 30 inmates, multiple riots broke out in the showers, turning the whole place into a bloodbath. I've since looked up how to get the plumbing to work and the second prison is going much better (though my idea of separating Min/Med/Max security prisoners seems to be breeding a lot more tension than before).  I also picked up a couple bundles, XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Metro Redux. Hoping to dive into XCOM this week at some point, if Prison Architect doesn't keep me too absorbed."

I think I'm in the second half of the game, and am currently focused on scaling the towers and getting my high level gear crafted before taking on the story missions some more.  Also, I'm going through Uncharted 3. I'd left that game on the sidelines for way too long, so have actually been putting in the time to move forward. It's getting quite difficult, but it's fun and when I'm done, I'm moving on to The Last of Us. Can't wait :D.   I am also meant to be making headway in playing Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition on my phone, but don't seem to be playing much. I think it's the control scheme that gets to me. It's a really good game, though, and a very nice change of pace from the more modern RPGs I've grown accustomed to."

If I remember, people were mostly disappointed because the trailers focused on the hacking gameplay, but in the end the game was just like every other Ubisoft open-world game. Shooting stuff and unlocking towers. The hacking arguably ended up being just a gimmick. Having said all that, I haven't played the game. I only remember it because I was super-hyped for this game once, but decided not to buy it after reading all the reviews."
patientgamers,39sp4j,Reas0n,2,Sun Jun 14 12:40:50 2015 UTC,"okay. yea, i was very psyched for it as well, and read all the bad press.  I was hoping that something like a Destiny or Elder SCrolls Online had happened, where things improved over time."

patientgamers,39sp4j,juliankennedy23,7,Mon Jun 15 00:07:22 2015 UTC,It's really not all that bad. It is a middle of the road Ubisoft open world game. Nothing you do seems to change the world at all and the protagonist lacks charisma. The game itself is a decent romp however with some fun stealth and environmental kills.
patientgamers,39sp4j,Renegade_Meister,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:01:29 2015 UTC,It's really not all that bad. It is a middle of the road Ubisoft open world game.   Maybe someday they'll take note of the open world mechanics and engaging stories of franchises like GTA and Fallout...
patientgamers,39sp4j,da_chicken,2,Tue Jun 16 11:52:29 2015 UTC,"It's still pretty glitchy like almost all open world games are, and there are some really strange choices in there.  Overall, they just weren't really setting out to make a AAA game like GTA V, so it's much less deep than people wanted from an open world game.  You can't really patch that out.  I think the best I've heard said about the game is that it sets up for the possibility of a really amazing sequel.  If you're in to that kind of thing, Chip Cheezum is in the middle of a pretty good LP about it.  You can watch the first few episodes and get a very good idea of how the game runs and such."
patientgamers,39sp4j,kurokabau,2,Sun Jun 14 17:27:13 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed it and completed it 100% but i never kept track of the press about it so maybe it was easier to accept it for what it was and not feel let down by what was 'promised'.
patientgamers,39sp4j,Strazdas1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"Its a mediocre game (if you played other Ubisoft games, peopel describe it as a mix of variuos pieces from Ubisoft games) whose flaws were blown way out of proportion by Ubisoft lieing to its costumers again."
patientgamers,39toh3,the_dayman,7,Sun Jun 14 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"R&C 2 improved on R&C 1 in many ways and after playing R&C 2 to death (along with 3) on ps2 and ps3, I felt no desire to ever play the first one again. Not saying R&C 1 is bad, but being able to strafe smoothly without the jet pack, locking on to enemies, improved auto-aiming and having the ammo vendor automatically default to full ammo upon purchase (only on an individual gun basis though, R&C 3 had a convenient ""max all ammo"" button) come to mind as great mechanical improvements.  Deeper leveling/exp system, better weapons upgrades, bolt multipliers on challenge mode and more weapons in general were also great additions.  Oh, and hoverbike racing is infinitely better than hoverboard racing."
patientgamers,39toh3,Ozorgo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:54:30 2015 UTC,Ha alright thanks you've definitely convinced me to start the second one.  I has forgotten the annoyance of buying ammo too.
patientgamers,39toh3,Nambot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"Oh my, only playing for 15 minutes but between strafing, finding out when checkpoints happen, and upgrading guns to get more ammo capacity... things are already 100x better."
patientgamers,39toh3,Alex__V,3,Mon Jun 15 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"Ratchet & Clank 1 is not a run and gun game. Very few weapons are powerful enough for that, and Ratchet himself doesn't quite know how to react in those sort of situations, unable to really aim properly, and only learning to strafe about two thirds of the way in. However, Ratchet does know how to swing his wrench very well, and can take out most of the enemies with just a couple of attacks. The enemies themselves seem designed for this, most of them attacking with predictable wave attacks that are easily dodged. Generally the weapons are meant to be used at close range, or for sniping from afar. It takes a little while to get used to.  Weapons wise most weapons are situational. The pyrociter is good against clusters of small enemies, the drone device is good against enemies that try to charge at you (similar in use to keeping three green shells on you in Mario Kart), the waloper is great against tough unmoving enemies, the suck canon is good for crowd control on small enemies, the morph-o-ray works well in tandem with the suck cannon turning enemies too big to be sucked into creatures that can be sucked, the taunter can be used to bring enemies into range of other weapons, or make them walk into environmental hazards. The only arguably useless weapon is the glove of doom, and that's simply because there are always better options for ground troops, while the enemies you'd want it for are always flying.  The hoverboard is worse in the HD remake. It's a flaw of porting. Not that it was that great in the original mind.   The second and third games get better. There are options to have it have more conventional third person controls which many appreciate for easier aiming (though I personally dislike), and the weapons arguably fit the traditional gaming standards (pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, flamethrower, sniper rifle along with some more less than conventional weapons). The enemies also become better shots, and strafing becomes standard, making the thing a proper third person shooter/platform hybrid, speeding it's pace up considerably."
patientgamers,39scn0,Hiding_Clete,2,Sun Jun 14 07:51:05 2015 UTC,"I will be honest, Agarest probably is not the best game to play as your first JRPG. That goes for both difficulty and quality. They aren't bad but I still would not tell someone to buy it to get them into the genre."
patientgamers,39scn0,Darilon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:46:13 2015 UTC,What do you recommend instead?
patientgamers,39scn0,Omnilatent,3,Sun Jun 14 11:26:05 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what type of games you are normally interested in and if you are a PC gamer, Console gamer or both. JRPGs are still pretty rare on PC although more and more are being brought over.  Valkyria Chronicles is really good. It is on sale but if you wanted to wait until next year, you may get a bigger discount. It only came to steam a few months ago.  The Ys series is also a decent choice. There is an overarching storyline but each game has its own plot. The game mechanics change a bit between certain entries.   Trails in the Sky is good but has a pretty slow start. It is a pretty traditional JRPG  Elminage is good but I could only really recommend it if you enjoyed games like Wizardry. It is pretty old school in style."
patientgamers,39scn0,Darilon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:53:59 2015 UTC,Could you recommend a good PC game to get into JRPGs? I did a bit of research and it looks like there's not so many great games available for PC.
patientgamers,39scn0,karma_the_llama,2,Sun Jun 14 11:45:45 2015 UTC,"It's graphics an issue for you? Ie, would you be put off by pixel art or old 3D? If not, then check out:  Final Fantasy 4 - this is the quinessential jrpg. The downside to getting this on pc is it is a port of the Nintendo DS version, so the graphics are sub part and there are tropes in the game play that are common now with 3D jrpgs that you just didn't see (for the better imo) in the original. It's still a really great game with classic moments that any jrpg fan is pretty much required to know.  Final Fantasy 7 - this is the game that skyrocketed the amount of rpg fans in north America. Graphics are very dated.  If you are a fan at all of the comic Penny Arcade, then check out Penny Arcade's On The Rainslick Precipice of Doom 3 & 4 (1 & 2 were made by a current developer and are very different games, and are not required to easily pick up at 3).   This fall we will see the release of Tales of Zestiria. The ""Tales of"" series is a very long running series of jrpgs.  I'll add more after I get home in a few hours."
patientgamers,39scn0,syriquez,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, yes, graphics is an issue. I looked up other games in the Final Fantasy series. Shall I try Final Fantasy XIII (1-2)?"

I haven't played XIII-2 (or XIII-3) but the gameplay is modified in both of them, so that's worth noting."
patientgamers,39scn0,FantasyHeaven,2,Sun Jun 14 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"This game just went on sale. I've not played it yet (though I did just buy it), but the reviews sound pretty good.

patientgamers,39sxwq,BabyRager,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"I own most of these from bundles but have honestly never played them.  Having said that, I think $16 is a good price for 11 point and click games if you're a fan of the genre.    Daedalic games are hit or miss in quality depending on the person though and their Metacritic scores are usually around 70, which isn't too bad but not too great either.  I would just read the descriptions of the games, maybe watch some let's plays to get a feel for how they play, and see if you'd enjoy playing through them or not.    Memoria is a sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, which is currently $5 by itself.  You can just get those two in a bundle for $6 on Steam which comes with a tactical game as well.  This bundle would be a good option if you're not interested in Edna and Harvey, Deponia, the Whispered World, or any of the other ones.  Also, check on The Book of Unwritten Tales currently on sale at GOG for $4.  It's a really good point and click game."

They have wonderful stories, gorgeous artwork but the puzzle design is horrific, to put it mildly.  Memoria won't make much sense without playing The Dark Eye first. The Deponia games are pretty good fun, though."
patientgamers,39q0ge,Obamastrid,21,Sat Jun 13 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"Eh,  probably is worth 4.99. Combat can get a bit repetitive,  but they throw in some curve balls here and there.  But it's still really fun.  Highly recommend mage class"

patientgamers,39q0ge,gufcfan,22,Sun Jun 14 00:32:30 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of fun, but AMD graphics cards can cause one of the late levels to shit the bed hard.  At least, older AMD cards could; I have no idea how recent ones handle it.  I recently built a new computer with an Nvidia card, which is apparently what the game works best with.    That being said, it's quite fun (though it can be repetitive, like /u/Aroswing said) but it has the loot aspect, which is always great fun for me.  And if you can get friends to play with you online, it gets even more fun.    Pro-tip: for $4.99 it can still be worth it even with an AMD card, you just have to stare at the floor the whole time for the one level and use your ranged attack to shoot enemies in the feet.  If that turns you off, though, best pass on this one.  Works better if you're playing online and your partner has an Nvidia card and can fight the enemies more effectively.  And the problem is only for the first part of the level, which is relatively short."
patientgamers,39q0ge,kenjutsudude,6,Sat Jun 13 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"Had similar problems. Me and a friend tried to play online co-op but we were both on AMD cards (new rigs, both capable of shadow of mordor at 60fps), and neither of us could get past the second level without crashing (full on PC crash, mind you).   We tried to make it work but there's really no good solution for the problem and we had to give up and move on.  It also overrides steam voice chat which much lower quality in-game voice chat which is always infuriating, working around that alone got ridiculous."
patientgamers,39q0ge,tymbals,2,Sat Jun 13 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when me and my friend played we disabled in-game chat and just had Skype running in the background.

patientgamers,39q0ge,kenjutsudude,2,Sat Jun 13 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"Replacing your current graphics driver with Catalyst 12.6 resolves all issues the game has on AMD hardware (crashes, performance, visual artifacts etc.). It turned an unplayable mess into a super smooth experience on my HD7770.  However, that driver is extremely obsolete by now and, most probably, many other games and apps will not work correctly with it.  I don't even know if it's possible to install 12.6 on Windows 8 and higher. I managed to do it on Win7 but literally couldn't use my PC for anything other than War in the North until completing the game and going back to a current AMD driver."
patientgamers,39q0ge,DhulKarnain,3,Sun Jun 14 05:57:21 2015 UTC,I have an Nvidia card and I haven't seen any issues with the game. So if you have Nvidia I think you're safe
patientgamers,39q0ge,Aroswing,10,Sat Jun 13 18:32:18 2015 UTC,If you have friends to play with it probably worth it. The writing is pretty poor.    It however did sort of scratch the itch that old games like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance scratched back in the day just not as well.

Console-ish 'rpg' elements and character movements that are kind of jerky. The game badly wants to make a young person (I'm not) feel like they're a part of the LOTR story universe thing and that you're a big powerful hero - whether or not you actually know wtf you're doing. So it's kill kill kill and hooray you're a winner! Not saying every game start should be hard (I'd hate it lol), but it's just a bit blatant here.  So good game, probably. You should try it, probably, unless you're a picky old fart who can't stand very specific things."
patientgamers,39q0ge,Traveledfarwestward,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:17:09 2015 UTC,"Fun with friends, not great solo. It's not very well polished both in terms of gameplay and skill balance, but they invested a lot of time and effort in story and combat flow, which I really appreciate.  None of the story events are canon to the events of Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings, for anyone wondering."
patientgamers,39q0ge,Myrandall,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:11:13 2015 UTC,I thought it was fun and I played it on a shitty computer
patientgamers,39q0ge,Vizingard,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:36:39 2015 UTC,"Super repetitive and tons of bugs, performance issues and BSoD's... :/  Still fun though. Probably worth $5."

patientgamers,39q0ge,caatdawg,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:03:08 2015 UTC,"It's a great game, ignore the naysayers. Roll with the awkward combat and stay for the great characters (talking eagle buddies, yay!), setting, itemization (it's no Diablo but it's not bad) and co op if you can find a friend"
patientgamers,39q0ge,VVarlord,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:52:06 2015 UTC,Australian Patientgamers get the raw deal on this one. $US18.49  Such bullshit.
patientgamers,39q0ge,LordCommanderKeef,0,Sun Jun 14 06:33:09 2015 UTC,LMAO!
patientgamers,39q0ge,mynewaccount5,0,Sun Jun 14 17:37:38 2015 UTC,No. It's a very basic RPG type game with boring and repititve gameplay. Perhaps if you do it coop(I think it supported that) it would be worth it.
patientgamers,39q0ge,KyuubiReddit,0,Sat Jun 13 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of LOTR.  I tried it solo, on PS3, for about an hour.  I didn't like it, it felt like a very poor's man version of a Diablo game.  I stopped playing it.  Shadow of Mordor is a much better game."
patientgamers,39q0ge,Jesusmann,2,Sat Jun 13 20:54:02 2015 UTC,I plan on getting  Shadow of Mordor someday when it drops below $15.00.
patientgamers,39q0ge,Peterowsky,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"not really worth it IMO. I mean... play someone elses game and see what you think. The game is repetitive. You fight orcs and just lots of them. If all you want to do is fight orcs then go for it. The missions are... kill orcs with this weapon, or kill them with this weapon... or kill them with stealth. Keep in mind that the only weapons you have are your sword, dagger, and bow."
patientgamers,39q0ge,Jesusmann,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, there's some decent variety of orcs and combos, the environment is pretty awesome and what it does it does well. Killing a captain is quite rewarding before you turn into a immortal, uberpowered god of vengeance which is about as soon as you get a few runes/ability levels, and a warchief is to captains what a captain is to normal orcs so ytou get a little more juice out of it.  Yes it does get repetitive to kill orcs, over and over and over, and over and over and no there isn't really all that much variety in how it plays out unless you restrict yourself to not using some of the less effort-requiring mechanics.   Summing up : it's a one trick pony that does it's trick so well you won't even realise it untill you've put on a half dozen hours or so at it, and then you will stick with it because you want to see the rest of the story and if anything can challenge your badassery if you don't play like a brain-damaged chimp."
patientgamers,39q0ge,ThePixelPirate,2,Sun Jun 14 05:11:53 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I mean I did log 18 hours. But it comes to a point where I don't feel like finishing. I've become the Apex Predator to these orcs and I can take on endless waves. It is fun, but I just wish there was a bit more. If they had this combat but with RPG qualities as in Towns, NPCs, more engaging enemies... It will be even better."
patientgamers,39q0ge,Peterowsky,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:36:09 2015 UTC,"I logged 32 hours and didn't even care about the story. I think I did about 4 story missions. The rest of the time was hunting down captains, cause it is fun as fuck."

patientgamers,39q3ma,JoeKewl,8,Sat Jun 13 18:20:15 2015 UTC,Vaan
patientgamers,39q3ma,leDesespoir,3,Sun Jun 14 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"Can't disagree there  Although honestly, playing FF12 for the story would be like watching porn for the story."
patientgamers,39q3ma,JoeKewl,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"It was fun and there was a good story at one point, but it all came undone during the team switch and the writing went to shit.  I stopped using Vaan and Penelo once I got enough characters.   Was really fun to play and the mechanics are fun, and the battle system was a nice change of pace compared to the last couple Final Fantasy's."
patientgamers,39q3ma,leDesespoir,2,Sun Jun 14 00:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean it definitely wasn't a bad game in terms of story, but it was pretty lacklustre after a while. It really shines in gameplay and content, though."
patientgamers,39q3ma,JoeKewl,2,Sun Jun 14 00:57:54 2015 UTC,Well the intro cut-scene/tutorial lead off with backstabbing and political nonsense. Which was leading to a great story.

patientgamers,39q197,lakinwecker,21,Sat Jun 13 17:14:43 2015 UTC,Castle Crashers is a great game solo or CO-OP and Cities: Skylines is a a great city builder. Those 2 I would recommend highly from today's daily deals.
patientgamers,39q197,Limond,3,Sat Jun 13 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, except for the online co-op on Castle Crashers being unplayable due to lag, even in private games. Local co-op however is fun."
patientgamers,39q197,TMinfidel,11,Sat Jun 13 20:11:31 2015 UTC,Everyone should play Little Inferno if they haven't already.  It's a game about burning things in a fireplace but there's a nice story that goes along with it.
patientgamers,39q197,rarelypost,5,Sat Jun 13 18:21:21 2015 UTC,"Little Inferno is the greatest not-game I've experienced, full stop."
patientgamers,39q197,binarian,3,Sat Jun 13 19:09:15 2015 UTC,This was probably the first game on steam that I played from beginning to end.

patientgamers,39q197,conalmcgl,6,Sat Jun 13 19:51:28 2015 UTC,I have never played Borderlands 1 or 2. Is the bundle worth it? :)
patientgamers,39q197,Ragnuk,4,Sat Jun 13 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"If you like grinding and looting, I'd say absolutely. Even if you don't or aren't sure, I'd still say it's worth a shot. B2 in particular is a very accessible rpg/grind-y game.  Borderlands 1 is a little bit janky, whereas Borderlands 2 is quite polished. I'd honestly suggest AGAINST playing B1 if you have cheap access to B2. I never made it all the way through B2 because I had played B1 and most of the DLC pretty extensively a year or two earlier (I really loved the first Borderlands, despite its jank), and I was just burnt out on the core gameplay loop when I played B2. But B2 adds a lot of quality-of-life features, has a way better story, better upgrade trees, better guns, better graphics, and so on. You don't need to play B1 to get the story of B2 as far as I can remember.  I'd say just buy B2 or B2 GOTY if you are game. B2 GOTY is probably a massive amount of content, as even the base game is pretty big."
patientgamers,39q197,MellonWedge,5,Sat Jun 13 17:59:45 2015 UTC,I personally would say Borderlands is the better game over Borderlands 2. Their is some jank with it but I find it offers a much better experience. The writing style of B2 was just not to my liking at all. If you enjoy internet themed humor and references than go right ahead. Borderlands 1 on the other hand had its own sense of humor and story telling that worked a whole lot better.  Also if you are playing it solo B1 is the better game as most builds do amazing in solo play while as in B2 you are much less survivable.
patientgamers,39q197,Limond,2,Sat Jun 13 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly a fan of the writing style of the second game either, but I'll take some story over very little story or a story that is developed largely in quest descriptions. B2 has actual characters, climaxes, and a real ending. I liked the style of Borderlands 1 more, but there wasn't much actually there. I'd say the story isn't terribly consequential to the quality of either game, there is just way more meat in Borderlands 2 story-wise.  I never had issues playing solo (I never co-oped either game), but I never played the harder difficulties of Borderlands 2. I played the sniper class in both games, and I only upgrade passive abilities whenever possible, if that matters."
patientgamers,39q197,MellonWedge,3,Sat Jun 13 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"I'd take anything over the Borderlands 2 story, even no story at all.  It actively soured me on the game.    I thought the first game was better.  Don't recall it feeling janky compared to Borderlands 2, more like I recall Borderlands 2 feeling about identical and kind of boring because of this."
patientgamers,39q197,ElijahSnow27,2,Sat Jun 13 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"The BL1 characters were flanderized to hell and back, and/or hilariously underpowered in 2.   Lilith ; Roland ; Mordecai ; Zed goes from being an arguably evil sardonic asshole to full mad scientist that is ""legally obligated"" to inform you of his not being a real doctor; Scooter goes full retard despite having been just a hillbilly previously; Marcus's vending machines stop trying to sell you guns (in BL1, the gun vending machines would always talk up a certain manufacturer's strengths) and just go cartoon villain talking about killing the competition   The one thing BL2 did better than 1 in regards to characters is that Claptrap actually manages to be quite annoying."
patientgamers,39q197,Kanzentai,2,Mon Jun 15 16:24:53 2015 UTC,It is so so so worth it. BL2 is seen as the overall best in the series by most of the community. But they're all amazingly fun!
patientgamers,39q197,Jumplol,2,Sat Jun 13 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Totally. They're kickass games, fun shooting mechanics combined with just the right amount of grinding and loot acquisition. BL1's writing and plot isn't as good as BL2/TPS, but it's still a very, very solid game, and the Knoxx DLC is top-tier for the franchise. BL2's GOTY has a fucking baffling amount of content too."
patientgamers,39q197,Ulti,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:04:41 2015 UTC,Borderlands 2 GOTY is worth it. Tons of content.

FAQ about Median hours and cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other. The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.  It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject. Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it. NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.

patientgamers,39q197,-ParticleMan-,3,Sat Jun 13 17:50:13 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's still got ~1k players online at any given time, and I certainly enjoyed it a few years back. The SP campaign is doofy but kind of fun if you enjoy cheesy plots, and the MP is plenty of fun. It's great if you're into larger scale battles, as opposed to COD-corridor-shooters."

patientgamers,39q197,DingusDong,2,Sat Jun 13 17:34:00 2015 UTC,Don't forget you can just gift yourself the game and download it in your own time. Also data rationing absolutely sucks.
patientgamers,39q197,qvindtar,3,Sat Jun 13 18:12:18 2015 UTC,Does anybody have anything to say about where Prison Architect is at right now in terms of content for a $30 game? The wikipedia page says it's releasing the full game in Q4 2015.   Also are they going to raise the price for the full game?
patientgamers,39q197,c0Re69,2,Sat Jun 13 22:47:04 2015 UTC,Highly enjoyabe and a lot of content. Devs are a two man team and active. Go for it if you're into tycoon/builder games!

patientgamers,39qsgi,triedtostayaway,5,Sun Jun 14 00:04:58 2015 UTC,On top of that. The devs are releasing an enhanced edition that will be free to all current owners.
patientgamers,39qsgi,Hambeggar,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:39:40 2015 UTC,Never saw that from a company except CD Project with W1 and 2.  Granted W1 was in dire need of it but still.
patientgamers,39qsgi,coldberserk,4,Mon Jun 15 22:23:25 2015 UTC,Probably a few months.  This time next year it'll probably be $12.50 or $10 in the summer sale.  Subscribe to /r/gamedeals and keep your eye out for it since sales happen all year long.
patientgamers,39qsgi,rarelypost,3,Sat Jun 13 21:36:09 2015 UTC,"It was $15.99 on GOG just the other day, I'm sure it'll be put back up sometime before their sale ends on the 21st."
patientgamers,39qsgi,triedtostayaway,2,Sat Jun 13 23:55:06 2015 UTC,"So far it has seen sales down to -50% at best, so going for  â¬20/$20.   Best bet would probably be a sale on GMG, together with one of their -20% to -30% coupons.  Wasteland 2 was recently given as a reward to the $20 dollar kickstarter pledge for The Bards Tale IV for first-day backers. I convinced myself that was the discount I've been waiting for and jumped for that one.   I suppose it might see heavier discounts this year (-60%/-66%), with maybe -75% in one or two years, but that's all just guesswork."
patientgamers,39qsgi,CaptainSerendipity,2,Sat Jun 13 21:44:46 2015 UTC,But how is it/what is it comparable to? Looks like something I'd like. Gets great reviews but I assume you patientgamers aren't paid to review older games. Or should I ask in shouldibuy?
patientgamers,39qsgi,brainphat,2,Sun Jun 14 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"I backed it on kick starter but just fired it up a couple months ago. It's fantastic. Classic top down RPG with good voice acting, engaging story, kick ass music, great atmosphere, and turn based combat. I'm a sucker for the post -apocolyptic genre, but I've been recommending it to all my friends. It's a refreshing take in a sea of cookie cutter formula games, feels like an older game design wise but in a very good way.   They're revamping a lot of the game with the GOTY edition/free patch, so I've held off playing since I heard thats coming down the pipe soon."

patientgamers,39qovi,MrBriski,56,Sat Jun 13 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"I have stopped thinking of my unplayed game pool as a backlog. It's not a backlog. I'm not under any obligation to play them any time soon. It's just a great big library I can pick and choose from as I wish.  I don't intend on dying any time soon, so I've got plenty of years to eventually play the ones I want. If I do die soon the problem will resolve itself as well.  I would recommend people banish the word 'backlog' from their brain. It's not helpful and just promotes this ridiculous OCD that so many people seem to suffer from.  Just chill and play the games you want, when you want. Don't make gaming a chore."
patientgamers,39qovi,PurplePers0n,10,Sat Jun 13 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"This.  Also, think twice every time you see a game on sale. If you are going to play it RIGHT NOW, get it. If you don't, don't get it. You already have a huge backlog anyway."
patientgamers,39qovi,Neuromante,2,Sun Jun 14 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"That's the biggest thing I learned. Never buy a game on sale unless you're going to play it right now.  (the only exceptions I make are humble bundles because those are tooooooooooo cheap to pass up, but even then, there's usually ONE game in the bundle I want to play right now)"
patientgamers,39qovi,Geo,2,Sun Jun 14 04:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yep. And thats why I am playing currently Dark Souls, Dead Space, Darksiders 2, Saints Row 2, Hitman Contracts, Sim City 4 and some more that I abandoned.  Shit."
patientgamers,39qovi,Neuromante,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:47:35 2015 UTC,is darksiders 2 any good? that game is waiting for me as well.
patientgamers,39qovi,windowjumper,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not really sure.  It has all the good stuff from the first (badass -but easy- combat, great comic-book style, low level puzzles here and there, current gen platforming, great background and story...) and adds cool stuff (Diablo-inspired loot system with different weapons and armor), but most of the missions consist in ""get into dungeon, kill everything, solve those puzzles, jump from those ledges and kill the boss"", and many many ""find the hidden stuff"" sub missions (Find the pages of the book of the dead, get the special stones, find the five parts of the golem...).  IMHO, its fun but a bit repetitive, not really challenging (Although I'm really enjoying the fights and dungeons from the DLC's) but overall an ""ok"" game. A really long game.  And be careful with the ""Delete savegames option"" >_>"
patientgamers,39qovi,Neuromante,5,Mon Jun 15 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"I don't intend on dying any time soon, so I've got plenty of years to eventually play the ones I want.

patientgamers,39qovi,juliankennedy23,3,Sun Jun 14 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to an extent.  To me, it is a backlog, because I want to play them. Not because I have to. There are some games in my library that are ridiculously terrible, or hard, and I actually do want to experience that because it will broaden my scope as to what games I enjoy the most.  For example, right now I'm playing Afterfall InSanity Extended Edition. If you've ever seen this game before, you can tell that it isn't very good at all. But I am determined to get through the whole thing. Why? Well, I'm not 100% sure. But I know that I enjoy being immersed in other peoples ideas, concepts, and creations. So, to an extent, I actually enjoy playing the game. I think less critically about it and more just want to experience what the developer's product was.  So, anyway, I don't think the term ""backlog"" is that bad. I think in my case it's applicable. Thanks for replying though, I never thought about that point of view and I'm enjoying this discussion"
patientgamers,39qovi,ZombieRonSwanson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:14:47 2015 UTC,I have some games that I will most likely never play as they were the crud in an otherwise really good bundle

I'm currently clearing my backlog right now (fortunately my library sits at around 50-60 instead of 500) and it's been going pretty smoothly. I've held off buying a lot of games, which seems to help. Kinda sucks though when you see a great deal on steam and try to resist, but end up caving in anyway. (Like that sweet Metro Redux bundle deal for $10)"

patientgamers,39qovi,HesitantJam,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"Sure :) It's from The Matrix, it was Morpheus' ship, although I made a typo when copying it that stuck with me (it should be Nebu, not Neba). Later on I read about the Babylonian kings called Nebuchadnezzar, particularly the most well known one (the second), but the first time I heard the name was in The Matrix."
patientgamers,39qovi,HesitantJam,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:36:08 2015 UTC,"Ahh, okay. Those were both the references I was thinking of - but my instinctual one was the Babylonian king. I'm a history buff so I always appreciate a good ancient history reference, haha :)"
patientgamers,39qovi,zakabgamer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Nice read!  May I ask what game you're currently working on? Also, do you use any sort of program/tracking sheet to keep track of what your progress is?"
patientgamers,39qovi,zypsilon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"So typically, I work on two games at once. The reason for this is because I can get bored of a game easily. If I'm simply not in a mood for it, I just stop playing it. Take Dead Space 2, for instance. It took me about a year to complete, even though it's fairly short. So whenever I wasn't in the mood for it, I'd go play Dishonored and vice versa. I recently beat both of those games, so as of now I'm playing Far Cry 4 and Metro 2033 Redux.   As for tracking my progress, the main thing I do is organize my steam library using Steam Categories. (If you don't know how to do this, right click the game and click on ""set categories..."") This has been more helpful than I initially thought. What I do is split up into five categories: Multiplayer, Not Playing, Play First, Wait, and Games. Not Playing is for games that I've already beaten. I uninstall them and hide the category so I don't get tempted to play them again. (Like Skyrim) Play First is for games I'm working on currently. It also extends to games that I will play very soon, or if both of my two games bore me at the moment. Wait is for games that I plan to play. I keep this uninstalled so I don't get ahead of myself. And then Games is just for games that aren't part of my queue, like Dark Souls.    Also I use a text application like Word or something to keep a comprehensive list of the games I have to play and what category they belong to, and the order I need to play them. I usually determine the order using game length.  Hope this helps! :)"
patientgamers,39qovi,zypsilon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"Cool! I used to use Steam categories but it ended up doing less for me than I expected.

patientgamers,39qovi,bloo2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between completed and mastered?   Completed = 100%.

Guess there's no option for that on backloggery?   I've never ventured into steamcompletionist, but from the sounds of it, it seems Backloggery just gives you more control over things. You can name the game however you want, you determine how much of the game you completed (including mastery), you can decide pretty much everything. You can also put in your library for any console, not just Steam."

patientgamers,39qovi,Boris_Ignatievich,2,Sun Jun 14 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"I had gotten to a point where I was buying a lot of games and not really playing anything, so I started doing a similar ""challenge"". Since November, I've been exclusively playing games from my backlog, while going as long as possible without buying any games. It would be nice to go a full year without buying anything, but I do have a few series I'd make an exception for, so we'll see. None of them have any upcoming releases announced yet.  My library includes a lot of games I don't really have any intentions on playing any time soon, so I broke it down to a smaller list of about 25 games that I'm immediately interested in playing. If I can't get into a game on my list, I move on. It's going pretty well so far - I've beaten 7 of them so far. Not too fast paced, but I'm taking my time and making consistent progress, to keep the whole thing from feeling like a chore. I use Backloggery to track my progress (same username if anyone wants to add me)."
patientgamers,39qovi,WillTheKill,2,Sun Jun 14 03:58:09 2015 UTC,Nice! That's an interesting process to make sure you stay interested and committed to what you want to do. Thanks for the input.
patientgamers,39qovi,nopaint,2,Sun Jun 14 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"My back log + penchant for buying older games has netted me a library with games as old as 1997, with the bell curve peaking around 2010/11, which means about half of my games are now more than five years old.  I recently sorted everything out by release year, and I'm working to complete the oldest games. I have found that sorting by genre or trying to play too many games at once just leads to indecision, especially as new games come out and get thrown on top of the pile. This chronological method makes it easy to see what I should play next, while also allowing my library to continue to grow."
patientgamers,39qovi,snowbell55,2,Sun Jun 14 12:30:26 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's an interesting process, going through the oldest games first.  I've first started with the intent to play my games alphabetically (currently playing Afterfall InSanity), but now I'm thinking of just hitting the random button once I'm finished with the game. This way I'm not mentally preparing myself for anything and I can just dive right in. Who knows where this will go."
patientgamers,39qovi,nopaint,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"Alphabetically is a great idea. I also like the 'random button' approach though I feel it's somewhat easy to abuse and would lead me to the same indecision I was stuck in before, choosing between moving forward with the game in front of me, or rolling again in the hopes of landing on something even better. The chronological approach works best for me because even though I'm still indecisive, at least I'm leaning towards the back of my back log, with a bit of comfort from the knowledge that it's taken me 18 years to get around to playing Final Fantasy VII, which means my copy of Skyrim from 2011 will probably still be fun once I finally get around to playing that."
patientgamers,39qovi,snowbell55,2,Sun Jun 14 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"Do you have a link to the rules or how it's set out, or is it just ""play through your backlog""?   I'm doing this now - finished 6 games and 1 DLC in the past month and a half or so, the vast majority of which I'd started a long time ago and never finished. It's really great and means not needing to pay much attention to the current sales and getting a bit more worth out of the games I already have. Highly recommend it.   You might find using a site like Backloggery, or How Long To Beat might be helpful.   Just to add:    I recommend you look through your library of games and see what games are worth playing, there are like 20 games in my library I will never play because I just don't like them, and got them through bundles with other games I wanted.   Definitely this."
patientgamers,39qovi,nopaint,2,Sat Jun 13 21:47:42 2015 UTC,Steamcompletionist.net can be pretty helpful for that... Steamleft.com can make you rethink any hope you ever had of finishing all your games.
patientgamers,39qovi,zypsilon,2,Sun Jun 14 01:48:53 2015 UTC,I know there is a ruleset out there for a specific challenge to do within a year or something - but I just want to complete my games regardless of how long it takes.  I'm using Backloggery right now and I love it

Better informed: The lust and hate cycles (best game ever for a month and then worst game ever the next) are over and sensible discussion is easier to find. Not to mention being able to inform yourself about the ""complete"" picture of the price (DLCs/preorder bonuses etc)   I didn't wait on Transistor for long because I really like SGGames and want them to succeed in everything they do. I went full fan on them with Bastion (which I rarely do).  Stay strong."

patientgamers,39pk02,YoungAdult_,18,Sat Jun 13 14:45:51 2015 UTC,Cut scene -> walk 10 feet to bar -> loading screen -> walk upstairs -> cut scene. The game is basically a 20 hour tutorial.
patientgamers,39pk02,witty_nomenclature,4,Sat Jun 13 15:39:22 2015 UTC,On console maybe. On PC it's seamless. And you can skip the cutscenes.
patientgamers,39pk02,roboczar,0,Sat Jun 13 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"well, there are loading screens if you skip the cutscenes, and it's still jarring. Also not all cutscenes can be skipped, including some pretty long ones.  Overall the criticism is valid, both on console and PC  (I recently started playing it again from the beginning on PC for a project, although this time around I'm using a controller instead of my trusty mouse and keyboard)"

The constant, unskippable cut scenes and over-monologuing were an endless frustration.  It's the only game that I've ever rage-uninstalled, when half-way through I was treated to a walking cutscene where Max limps along and I can do nothing but hold forward."
patientgamers,39pk02,alchemeron,3,Sat Jun 13 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"The cutscenes in that werd the loading screens though. Nog excusing the rest, just informing."
patientgamers,39pk02,wour,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"This is correct- as soon as levels finished loading, you actually could skip through the remainder of the cut scene.  That said, at least for my laptop, it often took almost the entire cutscene for the level to load.  This meant that skipping cutscenes would only reduce the cutscene time from ~3.5 hours to ~3.4."
patientgamers,39pk02,genericaccount1234,0,Sat Jun 13 19:21:01 2015 UTC,Yeah.. that game is cool but it's definitely not on the same level as the first 2. It has better graphics and gameplay but I didn't even associate the dude you play as as Max... first thing being they look nothing alike...
patientgamers,39pk02,CaptainFartdick,4,Sat Jun 13 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you. I wouldn't recommend someone pick up 3 if they've already played black flag. I played 3 then bf, and I felt like black flag did everything better.   Ship gameplay is the obvious parallel, but these games also included hunting. 3's hunting system felt like a rip off of Red Dead Redemption. When you include the fact that BF's hunting also included much more exotic animals, theres a clear winner.   Also, lets face it, the pirate assassin made a better story then the Native American assassin they made.  edit: to expand on my last point, and to agree with OPs post, a pirate in the sparse West Indies has a lot better explanation for what he can go off and do sidequests for ""weeks to months"" at a time."
patientgamers,39pk02,GenButtNekkid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:14:31 2015 UTC,my only complaint about Black Flag were the horrible stealth missions (which were a lot of main quest missions)
patientgamers,39pk02,Numendil,4,Sat Jun 13 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"A former dev on the game was on here a while ago and explained some of the issues. Basically, multiple parts of the game were worked on by different studios at the same time, giving the game an uneven quality."
patientgamers,39pk02,plaidchuck,4,Sat Jun 13 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"(Spoilers in my post)  I think the game gets a raw deal.   The beginning of the game is outstanding imo - the opera house and then the boat section is a great introduction to the story, the time period, and the game. I personally love the switcheroo - it completely shocked me and is a really brave storytelling conceit. I love the wilderness, the way you can climb and interact with the trees in a new way, hunting sections, the change of pace works excellently. I love the idea of a native American hero. I love the old games you can play. I love all the naval stuff introduced in the game. I think Achilles is a terrific memorable character. I quite like the modern day stuff as well.  What I don't love is the main story missions built around the war. It's all a bit plodding, very patchy at times, and it's not really that clear quite what you're really doing there and how the story is progressing. There are also some weird plot jumps (a lot of AC games have had those). There's also a bit of an unfinished lack of polish and plenty of glitchy moments in my playthrough - again AC has a bit of history with those :).  Overall I put the game ahead of Brotherhood and Revelations (which are basically just tweaked retreads of 2), and worthy of a position as a full sequel given the scale of the story and all of the new gameplay elements it introduces."
patientgamers,39pk02,Alex__V,3,Sat Jun 13 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to play as a Templar, you could have a look at AC: Rouge. The reviews seem really good."
patientgamers,39pk02,theindigamer,6,Sat Jun 13 15:35:03 2015 UTC,the point is not quite me wanting to play as templar. Perhaps I explained myself poorly. The point is that I was enjoying being a templar in AC3 way more than being a native.
patientgamers,39pk02,theindigamer,2,Sat Jun 13 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"Gotcha'. Too bad, then, because iirc the game never reverts to Haytham's point of view."

patientgamers,39pk02,-ParticleMan-,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"Gotta admit, AC3 is one of my favourites, it really grew on me. The character of Connor, nowhere near as likeable as Ezio or Edward Kenway, gets a bum deal. If you JUST play the main campaign and do not invest in the homestead (which the game pratically hides from you as best as possible) then you see him as a one dimensional punk kid, but once you invest in that homestead and bring people into it and make that community, you see a Connor who has his flaws but is a good man. I liked AC3, it had many lowpoints and the missions were scattershot at times, and the person who was the central atagonist was woefully misguided but the game itself was a good experience for me. I finished it twice, once only finished the main quest and the second time completing all the side missions and the Homestead building paid off big time.   Plus it all ties in, 3 Black Flag, Freedom Cry and Rogue all tie together in unique ways. It's best to play the whole story to get the idea of what's really going on. The DLC for AC 3 about King Washington is really good though, that alternate timeline stuff is mega interesting and has Connor in this alternate timeline and he knows it is wrong. Worth checking out."

I can handle pretty chilled demos on my dk2 but anything with lots of movement makes me feel pretty ill. Is it viable to just slowly cruise around in space I guess is what I'm asking...or is it more action packed than that?
patientgamers,39p27a,HEROnymousBot,3,Sat Jun 13 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"I had a bit of sickness when I first got the rift, it's all but gone. Sometimes, when I am falling in a game, I can feel it in my stomach but it's more immersive than it is motion sick..  Elite is probably one of best experiences beside racing games. You're sitting in game so it feels somewhat more natural. As long as you can keep it at 75hz, it's an epic experience but I do wish elite had more meat to it.  I definitely suggest trying out star conflict on steam, it's more of a faced paced, cod style arcade shooter, but it'll give you an idea what sitting/looking around the cockpit feels like. It's not as good looking as elite but it'll give you an idea. Its free to play on steam!"

The single-player campaign is the main draw. There's multiplayer but the servers have since shutdown, although if you look hard enough there are still some online communities that fixed that.

patientgamers,39p27a,trombonne,2,Sat Jun 13 15:31:15 2015 UTC,"Freelancer (video game):       Freelancer is a space trading and combat simulation video game developed by Digital Anvil and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It is a chronological sequel to Digital Anvil's Starlancer, a combat flight simulator released in 2000. The game was initially announced by Chris Roberts in 1999, and following many production schedule mishaps and a buyout of Digital Anvil by Microsoft, it was eventually released in March 2003.  In the game, players take on the roles of spacecraft pilots. These characters fly single-seater ships, exploring the planets and space stations of 48 known star systems. They also engage in dogfights with other pilots (player- and computer-controlled) to protect traders or engage in piracy themselves. Other player activities include bounty-hunting and commodity trading. The single-player mode puts the player in the role of Edison Trent, who goes through a series of missions to save the Sirius sector from a mysterious alien force. In multiplayer mode, players are free to take on any role and to explore anywhere from the start.  Originally, Roberts promised features such as automated flight maneuvers, dynamic economies, and a multiplayer mode that could host thousands of players, but diminished versions of these features were implemented in the final release. The game's initial technical demos impressed reviewers, but after the Microsoft buyout and Roberts' departure from Digital Anvil, critics had doubts about the game. Reviewers judged the final product technically good but failing to fulfill their initial expectations.    Image i     Relevant: Digital Anvil   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Freelancer was also great for an operatic space sim, though I'm not sure if it's possible to buy it online anymore.

patientgamers,39p27a,rebbsitor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"See my ideal game would be Mass like Roleplaying and a game-world with really good lore, buy then the freedom that (from what I can tell) games like X and EVE have.

patientgamers,39oyfs,DoctorDank,2,Sat Jun 13 17:39:20 2015 UTC,Still pretty easy to find a game and server. Someone said about 1000 players but that is still plenty to find a populated server in your area.
patientgamers,39oyfs,ILikeRaisinsAMA,2,Sat Jun 13 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"Everything is the same. I would get it through steam, just because if you get it on steam, you have it on steam and orgin.

patientgamers,39oyfs,randomguy000039,5,Sat Jun 13 13:49:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's probably worth it. The campaign is quite nice, it doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite humorous."

patientgamers,39oyfs,tenhotuisku,2,Sat Jun 13 17:51:18 2015 UTC,it's better than bf3 or bf4 but it's hardly worth it unless you're really into the mp (which is great)
patientgamers,39oyfs,MaximumAbsorbency,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter. BF3 and even BF4 have been really cheap, so if you are just buying because of price I would suggest trying one of those instead (higher population). I think I've seen BF3 below $10 and BF4 below $20.  But obviously they will require more umpf to run, so it depends on your PC, too."
patientgamers,39nvvn,destroyermaker,31,Sat Jun 13 02:35:41 2015 UTC,I would say there's still a decent amount of enjoyment to be had even if solely for the ridiculousness of it all.
patientgamers,39nvvn,brodmonsta,22,Sat Jun 13 02:37:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's a lot less sandboxy than GTA 4/5. For instance, GTA has the taxi/ambulance missions, bowling, darts, etc.,. There's not much of that in Saints Row 3.   As for the Sandboxy elements? Saints Row 3 has a lot of hidden collectibles, but they're 100% completion-pointless. There are assassination/vehicle theft missions - go to point A, be in a certain car, find and kill person. Also, find a certain car, steal it, and get car back to base with unclearable police badges. I grinded through them and didn't have much fun. I'd avoid them. At that time, I had been aiming for 100% completion so I spent 5-7 hours grinding them.   There are also ""activities"" marked on your map. Doing them give you gang territory. Some are fun and I'd recommend trying them at least once, but overall meh. Examples include providing air cover to a dealer with a helicopter, covering drug trafficking in a vehicle, destroying a bunch of shit with a tank, ragdoll ""insurance fraud"" where you try to get hit by vehicles with modified physics, and picking up abused hos. I might have missed a few, but it's pretty much just a time waster. If you're feeling it do it, if not skip it. Doesn't matter really. My favorite activity was ""Professor Genki."" It's basically an arcade style gauntlet of enemies. Some are just frustratingly annoying due to bosses respawning infinitely and take a lot of luck.  The activities/territory control increases your cash pretty quick. It might seem like a good thing, but honestly Saints Row 3 makes you TOO fucking OP with buyable boosts. I started realizing it, but by then it was too late (and can't be undone). So, I'd really recommend avoiding stuff like ""auto-reload"" and all of the health boosts if you want a more challenging game. Wait until you struggle (if you do) and but them then. Otherwise, with a missile-lock RPG with infinite ammo you can pretty much stand at an intersection and take out EVERY military vehicle/tank without struggle.   The main storyline itself is pretty awesome though. The missions all ""feel unique."" I can't comment on the newer GTAs, but I recall that a lot of GTA felt like you'd just go to a random existing area that'd be populated with storyline NPCs. Saints Row makes the missions feel like a ""different beast"" than the sand-box. You have areas that are designed specifically for the storyline, so in the missions it becomes somewhat of a corridor shooter at times.   I really enjoyed it. The gunplay is smooth, the storyline is humourous"
patientgamers,39nvvn,postslongcomments,3,Sat Jun 13 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks much. I have very low tolerance for generic gameplay (part of the reason I'm attracted to the game in the first place), so I'll skip anything that doesn't really intrigue me. Probably just do the main missions and look to side missions when the need arises or when they really interest me.  I played GTA3 when it camed out and loved it, but have been utterly bored by every iteration since, for whatever reasons. Perhaps it was just the freshness of GTA3 that sucked me in, but once I'd experienced it, that was enough."
patientgamers,39nvvn,Crjjx,2,Sat Jun 13 07:27:38 2015 UTC,"In the saints row games most of the side activities show up in the main story around the start of the game, so you will be able to try them out by just playing the main missions and you can see if you like them from there."
patientgamers,39nvvn,multiusedrone,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:24:36 2015 UTC,Be sure to get the bundle with all the story DLC on sale: the additional content is definitely worth a few dollars on top of the base game.

patientgamers,39nvvn,wolfman1911,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:37:35 2015 UTC,Can't agree more about NOT maxing out certain perks. Becoming basically invincible and unstoppable quickly resulted in boredom because there was no challenge anymore.
patientgamers,39nvvn,X-pert74,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Really? Saints Row 3 has a hell of a lot of side activities in the same way as GTA, the only difference is that some times those side activities are integrated into the plot line.  Also, I don't think SR3 does it, but OP probably wouldn't like the fourth game, because it basically forces you to do all of the random faffing about missions at the end."
patientgamers,39nvvn,randomguy000039,2,Sat Jun 13 17:51:51 2015 UTC,The main game is silly and enjoyable enough that I think you would like that even if you don't care to do any of the side activities.
patientgamers,39nvvn,manaworkin,2,Sat Jun 13 02:53:33 2015 UTC,"Most certainly, I pretty much ignored most of the sandboxy stuff and still found it a great game. The base gameplay is so fun and arcadey (it makes even GTA look serious). The story isn't very deep, but is full of humor."
patientgamers,39nvvn,-2vsU-,2,Sat Jun 13 03:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, but only if you like over the top, crazy fun."

patientgamers,39nvvn,Lereas,2,Sat Jun 13 06:34:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of the sandbox elements are ""DO A DUMB THING RIGHT HERE NOW GO GO GO"" and then you go ""DO A DUMB THING"" and it's over in a few seconds and you're laughing alone in your computer room like a moron.    I got nearly 100% on that game in maybe 18 hours of gameplay and never once felt like I was just going through the motions or running through a bunch of filler."
patientgamers,39nvvn,blacklab,2,Sat Jun 13 12:38:41 2015 UTC,Oh yeah definitely. I found the sorry more compelling than gta4. The writing was fantastic. You will definitely be missin out on some really funny things in the world like the game show mini game that just adds to the humor. But definitely not a requirement.  Story stands strong on its own.

Here's hoping Valve decides to release Half Life 3 or Portal 3 at the end of the summer sale out of nowhere, however unlikely it may be.  One can always dream.

It was a while ago but from what I can remember you have to get a bomb off the back of a car, launch it with your grav gun and have it blow up the boss dudes.

If you're playing on PC you can also use console commands to get past an area if you're really stuck.    If you're playing on the PS3 or 360, it might be better to just restart the whole episode.

You don't need the digital deluxe for ME2 as there's nothing important included that makes it worth buying.

I still have these reservations about the retro 8-bit graphic indie scene. Why would I want to read pixelated text?

patientgamers,39kq7w,BlackDragonBE,3,Fri Jun 12 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"I've used Motionjoy in the past, but that's an unstable mess of a driver, with frequent BSODs as a result. Instead, I'd advise to use SCP Driver, it's an XInput wrapper that you can install as a service. You do need a bluetooth dongle for it to work.    Once installed, it works like a dream, all you have to do is connect the controller via usb to pair it automatically, then press the PS button on the controller to connect to the PC."

patientgamers,39kq7w,PaintItPurple,2,Fri Jun 12 13:48:07 2015 UTC,"Just a small warning, the Xbox controller layout for Magicka is kind of awkward. To cast spells, you have to queue up elements. On a keyboard, this is done with QWERASDF for the different elements. On a controller, it's done by moving the right thumbstick in a cardinal direction and then moving it left or right â for each element. I've heard they improved it for Magicka 2 to use the actual controller buttons, but that is sadly not on sale."

I expected another dungeon crawl a la Gauntlet, but it was different.   In FORCED, you complete individual challenges to unlock new abilities and challenges. At first, a lot of the challenges seem pretty easy, but for each one, there is also a harder achievement to do (like finishing the level, but doing it without killing the enemy spawners). Then each level also has a time trial where you have to beat it really fast, it is really challenging and fun to work together on.

patientgamers,39o02x,rosaParrks,2,Sat Jun 13 03:16:32 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I have played most of them together except for some of the more recent ones, so hopefully I can provide some insight. Generally speaking, if you like a particular franchise - play it. They are well made games and a great deal of care is taken to imitate and lovingly satirise each series. A personal favourite in this regard is Lord of the Rings: I vividly remember how hilarious the scene upon leaving Moria after Gandalf's fall is with a wide-eyed Lego Frodo.  Another general point I'd make is to consider how many of these games you are likely to play so you can decide on a sensible playing order. Later games in the series are considerably less buggy and introduce split screen whereas in older versions characters are confined to a single, limited area onscreen. Personally, I wouldn't let this deter you: I don't remember when split screen became a standard but I know for sure that Lego Star Wars and the first Batman don't have it and both are stellar.  Once again concerning playing order, be aware that these games are for the large part functionally identical game to game: you smash everything for studs, solve simple but humorous puzzles to complete levels, use your studs and powers outside levels to unlock more characters with more powers, and finally use these newly unlocked characters/powers to fully complete levels. There are incremental improvements each time, e.g. Lego Harry Potter 5-7 had a larger, more cohesive  overworld than 1-4.  Having just re-read your question I've just realised I've given you an incredibly long-winded answer that doesn't answer the question. I can't stress enough how great these are to play with a girlfriend: they are essentially how my girlfriend and I got into playing games together. Of the three I would play Marvel: it's highly polished, with great levels. Personally I found the New York overworld a little lacking in character compared to earlier games but that might just be me. Lego Hobbit should be great but I find the lack of the final film and TT's decision not to make it as DLC anymore all the hallmarks of a failed cash grab. I haven't played the Movie game yet so can't provide comment there. Enjoy!"

Do somr reaserch on it before committing. Portal 2, Rogue Legacy and Risk of Rain were all great too.   As a reminder, here are my responses to the most frequently asked questions about why we use Median hours to calculate a cost per hour and whether cost per hour is useful:   It's a median - which means it's not the amount of time it takes to finish the game, but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other.  The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution (that you can see as a graph on the linked pages). It's the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or don't play games is never fully clear - but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying.   It doesn't replace your own personal game preferences, or how ""good"" a game is. It doesn't tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. That's up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject.  Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference, redditor reviews, metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think you'll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think you'll get out of it.  NOTE: we don't take into account people who have played the game less than 1/2 hour and obvious bad data, like a million hours played.   Without further ado, here are the numbers.  NOTE: I've decided to merge the tables in this view. I find it more informative than the separate tables. Thoughts?

patientgamers,39l2d3,RaspberryRye,19,Fri Jun 12 14:01:20 2015 UTC,"Black Mesa is satisfying if you're already a fan of Half-Life, as seeing such a familiar game updated is a lot of fun. However, if you've never played Half-Life, I don't know that it will be nearly as enjoyable. If you're playing it cold, and comparing it with other modern FPSs, you may find it disappointing, especially since Black Mesa isn't even finished.  I'd recommend getting the original cheap and giving it a try first. If you like it, pick up Black Mesa during the winter sale and you'll enjoy that game a lot more than you would have otherwise.  That said, if you're simply not interesting in playing an outdated game, but really want some sense of the original Half-Life, maybe Black Mesa will feed that need, but I think you'd be better off at least waiting until the game is finished."

It used to be free, but they've recently gone commercial with it, with Valve's blessings.  You can still get the free version, and I'm not sure how different the two are for now.

It was amazing at first, but by the end it started to feel underwhelming. There's cut content. Two of the best sections of the game have been removed. A lot of the level design has been modified, which is really nice in some areas, but they also modified some of the most iconic sections. Don't get me wrong, the game is great, especially the gameplay. But it's not a good Half-Life remake, in my opinion.   I replayed the original along with the expansions last week, and I had blast. You made the right decision."
patientgamers,39l2d3,postslongcomments,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"Half-life is the best old-school FPS. If you can still enjoy Golden Eye 007, Half-life looks a heck of a lot better and the gunplay is like a modern FPS. Gun play is what Valve really perfected in the FPS genre and took it forward.  The gameplay is different than anything you're used to if you don't play many pre-2000 FPS. There are a lot of hidden areas/vents that are easy to overlook. There is also a lot of ""shock horror"" vs. atmospheric horror, so you'll probably die a bit when a random vent falls on you or you get stormed.  I'd probably go with Black Mesa for the core game honestly. It keeps much of the original formula with prettier graphics and is extremely well-done. The only part of the game not complete is what a lot of fans hated on release anyways. It really didn't fit HL1 when Valve released it, so I think those doing Black Mesa are really struggling to figure out how to make what Valve did less-shitty while still keeping with the theme.   Plus, you'll get to experience the GoldSRC engine plenty if you play Blue Shift/Opposing force episodes. Both of these side-games are as long as a lot of modern shooters."

E:D on the other is a multiplayer title with an economy which is at least kinda decent, has lot's of ships, much more depth regards to game mechanics and has a good community: /r/EliteDangerous/  Maybe X:R is worth it for 10$, but E:D is definitely worth it if you want to be a trader."

patientgamers,39j52m,notsofst,8,Fri Jun 12 03:31:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with this - Pillars is the better RPG but D:OS has the better combat.   Hell it's worth buying Pillars just for Durance alone. That dude is the scariest, craziest party member I have ever had in a CRPG. """"Hows your day Durance?"" ""I'll burn you all alive for Magrams glory for daring to speak to me!!!"" ....""oooooooohhhh kaaaaay.""  Not that the combat in PoE is bad, btw. It is very good, but D:OS combat is very very very good, theres nothing quite like it. You can interact with the environment to a much greater degree than in other CRPG's because of D:OS combat system - for example i had a quest to find some stuff out and I finally worked out that I had to get inside this locked room. After some time and not finding the key a lightbulb went off inside my head and I fireballed the door, burning it down.  During the fights in D;OS you can do things like pick up barrels and hit eneomies with them, make clouds of steam or make it rain then use lightning bolts to zap everything in the area, that kind of thing.  Pillars combat is much more conventional and BG2 like. But the RPG is better than BG2 (Imo) and the characters are by far the most varied and well written since I played Planescape Torment. Hell theres even an NPC party member who no one else can see properly other than the main character.  I ramble I ramble.  Pillars if you are buying one, but really its worth buying both :)"
patientgamers,39j52m,hypnoconomy,3,Fri Jun 12 06:41:00 2015 UTC,"little SPOILER ahead...  this is an original comversation from PoE:  Haravias: ...before I knew it, the stelgaer was on top of me and I was face down in the dirt! Sagani: Arrow to the throat. That stops 'em. Haravias: What? No. I was spiritshifted, and she was in heat. So I aimed for the throat, but not with an arrow...  you just have to love this game"
patientgamers,39j52m,drchaos2000,4,Fri Jun 12 15:32:39 2015 UTC,It's a fantastic dilemma to have.  I love that we have new RPGs like this coming out.
patientgamers,39j52m,yParticle,5,Fri Jun 12 07:27:39 2015 UTC,Pillars of Eternity definitely holds more to Baldur's Gate play style (being made by most of the original studio and using an updated engine). It made me feel like BG had been revived and shown some new tricks.
patientgamers,39j52m,randraug,5,Fri Jun 12 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"Both of them are great. Divinity Original Sin wins cause of the coop though. Get 'em from gog.com, no drm ftw."

patientgamers,39j52m,Structure,3,Fri Jun 12 13:28:47 2015 UTC,Just throwing in a suggestion as a wild card if you are interested in playing CRPG then you could always try Shadowrun: Dragonfall. I played PoE and not D:OS but I personally prefer Dragonfall over PoE. Mechanics wise PoE is better and has a wider choice but for story and characters I personally prefered Dragonfall. Dragonfall has the added bonus of being very cheap compared to the two you suggested.
patientgamers,39j52m,Manlir,3,Fri Jun 12 14:13:42 2015 UTC,I just finished playing Pillars of Eternity and it was an amazing experience. Fans of the older D&D titles really should play it. I love the way they avoided some of the annoyances of the older games.
patientgamers,39j52m,blakeismyhomeboy,7,Fri Jun 12 04:56:43 2015 UTC,"Haven't played either, but from what I've seen/read, you'll likely not be disappointed either way. For me, Divinity Original Sin looks far more appealing just because of the aesthetics and gameplay mechanics. But if your a high BG fan, I'm sure you'll love Pillars of Eternity."
patientgamers,39j52m,VanGTO,2,Fri Jun 12 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"I got the two of them from kickstarter and I'm gravitating more toward Pillars, which is basically a new BG with a talking fortress, combats are tough but not impossible.  Divnity is something really different and seems funnier (you can give really different personnalities to your characters and make them interact with each other) but I don't get it yet and I'm kinda lost both in term of story telling and in term of combat."
patientgamers,39j52m,marcseveral,2,Fri Jun 12 07:50:21 2015 UTC,"I own both of them, and what I've discovered is that I am atrocious at cRPGs. Which isn't helpful. Pillars is bigger and prettier, but as others have said, combat in Divinity is slightly more interesting.   Neither is bad. The genre got two amazing games this past year."
patientgamers,39j52m,dbcanuck,2,Fri Jun 12 08:30:15 2015 UTC,"I found PoE to be very dense and permanently grimdark -- it was a real downer to play, and while very well excuted i didnt find myself enjoying the experience. Combat was also very finicky in comparison to Divinity: Original Sin.  If you're into roleplaying and lore rich games, PoE is probably the better choice, but D:OS is probably the better 'game'."

It will in theory, be saved on your account forever.

I didn't have a Windows PC in the mid-90s so get to play this series for the first time now.  I bought a stick simply to play this game a few weeks ago and I really look forward to playing it any chance I get.  It is much deeper than Battlefront.  Power management is crucial, missions are hard and you will die a lot.  You feel like you're participating in battles in a great war to end terrorism and bring back stability.  Missions typically involve assaults on capital ships while keeping the starfighters at bay, or defending Imperial targets from overwhelming force.  I've been hoping I'll see ""X-Wing vs TIE fighter"" and ""X-Wing: Alliance"" go on sale, I'd buy them in a heartbeat.  Freespace2 is also supposed to be very good; it was just on sale for like $3 and may be again shortly."

I'm not saying you won't see a 15% discount for the sake of visibility, but I would be surprised at more.  That said, there is no better game on the market right now for testing out a flight stick. The level of control the game gives you over your ship is stunning to begin with and a stick just adds that whole extra layer of immersion.   Just know what you are getting into if you decide to buy. E:D in its current stage is open-ended almost to a fault and lots of people just see what's there as a grind with no payoff.  I bought into it over a year ago for more money than I will admit to on this subreddit, and have no regrets. Check out Isinona's videos on YouTube to see the game's full potential.  Star Citizen has also come a long way and I think you can still get early access at a reasonable price.  If you look back to a little over a year ago on either the Elite or Star Citizen subreddits, you will find a ton of threads along the lines of ""What games should I play to practice with my flight stick before Star Citizen/Elite come out?"" You should be able to find something there.  ARMA 3 also makes for a fun time with a stick, though the learning curve is not to be underestimated. You can definitely expect to see it turn up in the sale."

You just need to buy the game on Steam for the IWAD (doom2.wad). Then you take it and paste it into the folder of a source port, which is like a whole new-ish game engine that can run the DooM assets.  I don't think ANY game I own has gotten as much time from me as the DooM series. You would not believe what people have done with this old game, and it's cheap."

patientgamers,39gi77,Boris_Ignatievich,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but his argument is (I think) that by not waiting until a particular bundle is over before doling out spare keys, you make it so some people who clearly want the games won't buy the bundle, and therefore charity gets less money than if you waited until a given bundle wasn't on sale. I think he phrased it poorly, but I agree with him that it's probably a decent thing to wait before handing them out"

patientgamers,39hpun,leftinthesand,5,Thu Jun 11 20:06:48 2015 UTC,"It plays on  Win8, that's how I played it. I would say it holds up, and I have no nostalgia for a game that came out years before I had a PC. You said in another comment that you have DEHR. You might try that first. If you like it, then play the original. By the time you are done the Revision mod should be released. The mod devs are kind of asses but supposedly it's finished, they are just making everybody wait for shits & giggles.  http://www.dx-revision.com/  There are already existing mods to improve the graphics. It doesn't make it look like Crysis but it does help.  If you do play it before Revision is released, there are some mods here. I'd recommend New Vision, HDTP, and Shifter to improve the look and play of the game without being too radical. It's worth checking out GOG's mod forum thread, too."
patientgamers,39hpun,JustinPA,3,Thu Jun 11 22:56:26 2015 UTC,"Shifter ruined the experience for me.  Several of the best parts of the game were the long periods of time where you were running solo. No feedback, no achievements, no xp popups - just you immersed in the world.  Shifter kept popping up all these bullshit incremental xp bonuses every time I walked into the shadows and completely broke it for me.    To each their own, though, obviously."
patientgamers,39hpun,johnathanstrangescat,3,Fri Jun 12 00:33:30 2015 UTC,"I can see that! I know Shifter isn't for everybody, I just wanted to give my point of view."

patientgamers,39hpun,johnathanstrangescat,2,Fri Jun 12 01:07:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not a fan of introducing new people to mods that shift the gameplay; especially something that takes something as unique as Deus Ex and trying to fit it into more standard confines. I played through it using Shifter once and found myself disappointed with how it favoured certain playstyles and would divvy out XP for it."
patientgamers,39hpun,beboppin_n_scottin,3,Fri Jun 12 11:40:47 2015 UTC,If you like narrative i still very much feel the narrative trumps all other Deus Ex games. The gameplay is still solid just dated. For what it is it is pretty flexible if you get creative but as has been said stealth is reduced to don't walk in front of enemies don't run and use nanomods to go invisible/silent. Also plenty of cameras and bots to deal with as well.  Also the story is very flexible! Not as flexible as say Witcher 2 or 3 but on par with Witcher 1 for sure. Many of the changes are so subtle you wouldn't even realize things could have been different!   Spoiler free examples: There are reoccurring characters that typically die and i can say most players didn't even know they could save them! Also if you kill an early npc they will stay dead.  If you like straight forward shooters it should be fine. I haven't had trouble running old games on my windows 8 machine so i think you are in the clear but no hands on exp with Deus Ex. But I've gotten Thief to run and i think that says much.
patientgamers,39hpun,Ghost33313,3,Thu Jun 11 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"I loved the game when I was a kid.  It's one of the first open-ish world RPG FPSes. It played well, I liked how you had to get points to increase traits for things like sniper steadiness."
patientgamers,39hpun,Tianoccio,-5,Thu Jun 11 23:18:18 2015 UTC,"It's very dated now, but if you don't mind 15 year old games you could grab it.  I'd recommend Deus Ex: Human Revolution at this point if you're looking for a more modern game.  The first game also has an almost non-existent stealth system compared to HR, so if you're looking for a great stealth game I'd recommend HR over the original.  I'd recommend you wait until the Deus Ex games are at least 75% off before buying any of them though."
patientgamers,39hpun,rarelypost,2,Thu Jun 11 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"I have Deus Ex: HR. Should I just play it, or is the story hard to understand without playing the original?"
patientgamers,39hpun,ElijahSnow27,2,Thu Jun 11 20:34:38 2015 UTC,"Story is pretty unrelated.  It's more of a prequel anyway.  I enjoyed HR quite a bit and I didn't even remember a scrap of the original Deus Ex story (played it when it was new and replayed it around 2006, the story is very forgettable and boring).  I liked HR quite a bit more than the original game as well.  I never found the original to be one of the best games of all time, I didn't even think it was one of the best games in the year it released."
patientgamers,39hpun,Tianoccio,2,Thu Jun 11 20:42:49 2015 UTC,"It might be because I was 12 when I got the game, but I thought he storyline was pretty cool.  If you like conspiracy theories, the game fits them well into the narrative."
patientgamers,39hpun,rarelypost,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:17:08 2015 UTC,"HR is a prequel to the first game, so you don't have to worry about needing to know things from the first game.  I'd check a let's play of the first game and see if you would be fine with the dated graphics and mechanics before buying it though.  It is still a good game, but good for its time, which was a while ago."
patientgamers,39hpun,Catdec,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"You can understand everything in Deus Ex:HR without playing Deus Ex or Deus Ex:Invisible War , the only thing you really miss is the nostalgia factor sometimes when it plays music from the original Deus Ex.  HR of course has more polished graphics and gameplay with an ok to good story , it's got some flaws with the stealthing system and the boss-fights are downright horrible but other than that it's a pretty good game.  Deus Ex, has pretty bad graphics but they can be somehow tweeked with mods and also a pretty annoying stealthing system when it comes to non-lethal takedowns.It is way more focused on the RPG element than HR and is pretty unforgiving , especially on higher difficulties, if you don't allocate your skill points efficiently but it definitely isn't as brutal as , say , System Shock 2 in that department.Its main strength is the story and the story-telling and has quite a lot more depth than HR.  You can start with whichever game you desire but I would strongly suggest not to miss the opportunity to play the original Deus Ex either you liked HR or not."

patientgamers,39j64q,metroid98,2,Fri Jun 12 02:21:15 2015 UTC,Xbox backwards comparability has always been kind of shoddy for most games. I would recommend buying them off the PS store.

Once a game shows up as a daily, flash, or community choice deal it'll have that same discount no matter which one it's in for the rest of the sale.  Now if you won't be playing it for a few months, then you could wait until the winter sale, or buy it from another online retailer in the future for a bigger discount than 60%."

I'd recommend checking out Strike Suit Zero and Strike Suit Infinity also if you enjoy mechs in space, if you don't already have them."
patientgamers,39h0aj,dagnart,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:28:18 2015 UTC,Already got those two awhile ago. xD They can be pretty fun.
patientgamers,39h0aj,dougmc,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"The Homeworld games are unique.  The first one is almost a survival/RTS, as weird as that sounds.  Resources from each stage carry into the next, which includes currency and ships, and most stages are under a time constraint so it's important to play efficiently.  You rarely have the opportunity to harvest ore or build up your fleet in peace.  Losing your fleet that you've been steadily building for the past 3 stages is a big deal, although it does happen from time to time and you can usually recover eventually.  The general theme is being chased across the galaxy by unknown hostile forces as you try to survive and figure out what the hell is going on.  Homeworld 2 Cataclysm has a lot of the same basic gameplay elements, but it has more of a horror theme and less of a survival one.  The gameplay in general is much more refined.  The plot isn't particularly original, but it's well-delivered and paced.  Both games have excellent characterization, scripting, and voice-acting, although most of the excellent world-building is done in the first game and is given less emphasis in the second (as the plot occurs many years after the first game and everybody already knows what's up)."
patientgamers,39h0aj,dagnart,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:05:21 2015 UTC,"I never really played Homeworld 2 enough to get a feel for what it was after -- it just pissed me off that it was so different.  Homeworld 1 is more ""ragtag fugitive fleet"" for most of the game -- like Battlestar Galactica.  Homeworld Cataclysm was the best of the series, IMHO, but unfortunately it wasn't included in the remastered version because they had lost the source code, though some said it was then recovered, and others said they didn't need it anyways (which seems accurate to me.)  Either way, Cataclysm was much more ""horror"" than the first one -- you have awoken an ancient horror that will destroy all of civilization if you don't stop it."
patientgamers,39h0aj,dagnart,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:45:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, shoot, you know what?  I was confusing Homeworld 2 with Cataclysm!  I never actually played the second one as it went under my radar.  Now that I think about it, I do seem to remember hearing some not great stuff about it."

patientgamers,39hvrp,Prah2013,4,Thu Jun 11 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"Not really, it's basically that fun minor characters that shows up in for example III or VC, returned to SA."
patientgamers,39hvrp,Simpfally,3,Thu Jun 11 21:14:36 2015 UTC,I was thinking about buying IV.. but I prefer to wait for the V. Not worth buying the two
patientgamers,39hvrp,IdeaPowered,5,Thu Jun 11 21:37:38 2015 UTC,"If you haven't played IV, then you are missing out. Especially with the addition of the two expansion packs (especially The Ballad of Gay Tony)."
patientgamers,39hvrp,k_bomb,7,Thu Jun 11 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"Vice City was my favorite of the series. That being said, the game is probably going to look and feel dated.  As none of the old games are going to inspire nostalgia (which is most of what I get out of them nowadays), I'd say jump for IV.    For another similar game (sandboxy ""take over the city"" game), check out the Saints Row franchise. It's basically Grand Theft Auto that doesn't take itself seriously. I was happy to log over 60 hours in Saint's Row: The Third. (Saint's Row IV feels like a mod of 3. I'd go with 3 given the choice. And they're not at their lowest prices yet)"
patientgamers,39hvrp,IdeaPowered,2,Thu Jun 11 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"What do you like about Vice City? Since another recomendations guides me to San Andreas I might be inclined to buy the ""trilogy"" pack. (Also, my PC is kiiiiinda low end and I don't know how well IV will run in it)  I do consider trying out Saint's row, but I want to taste the sandbox experience from GTA first. Thank you for your suggestion!"
patientgamers,39hvrp,k_bomb,3,Thu Jun 11 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"Vice City is extremely small for today's standard. Just FYI. Like really small. About the size of 1 island in GTA SA or IV or V.  I'd suggest SA over it because everything GTA VC did, SA did it better and bigger. There are way more activities, way bigger map, way more to do. The story is good to boot.  However, if you got loads of time on your hands... play all of them."
patientgamers,39hvrp,seifer93,2,Thu Jun 11 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there's any basis to this at all, but the driving felt better. For a game where a good bit of it is driving to and from missions, in missions, and joyriding, realism (or lack thereof) can have a big impact.  This was the game of the series where I'd pick up a motorcycle (no motorcycles in GTA:III?) and just drive around a bit. Go fast, jump off stuff, weave around cars and run from the cops on it.  I also really liked Tommy as a character (probably my favorite to play as until Nico). And this holds true in all of them, but the radio stations are amazing."
patientgamers,39hvrp,yeezustakethewheel,2,Thu Jun 11 21:03:23 2015 UTC,I always really liked the 1980s Miami setting. It really stands out from the other GTA games.

If you're interested in a game just go to its page and see what bundles Steam has it in so you can save some money if there are others in a series you want to pick up."
patientgamers,39hvrp,blakeismyhomeboy,3,Thu Jun 11 23:30:45 2015 UTC,None. Rockstar is abusing the sale by raising prices and including microtransactions to break steams refund policy. Rockstar is acting like scum and does not deserve your money.

Flash forward 3 years and I have a custom gaming rig with a gtx 780 ti.  I pick up skyrim dirt cheap last winter and I'm still playing it. Hundreds of hours and the mod community is amazing.  I modded full immersion and graphics so it's harder, gorgeous and more balanced.   Tons of mods have minimal impact on FPS so you can still enjoy.

The day FO4 was announced, they had a sale on pretty much the entire franchise to promote the new game's preorders. They didn't bundle 3 or NV, (but both were heavily discounted,) but they had the older games bundled.   I'd actually suggest New Vegas over 3, by the way... 3 was an alright game, but it was overall just a mediocre experience. NV blew it out of the water in comparison. The only difference is that 3's main story grabs your attention faster, while NV takes longer to get started - This leads to a lot of people preferring 3 purely because they stopped playing NV before they even left the first town."

patientgamers,39dzrv,perrythebari,23,Thu Jun 11 05:31:46 2015 UTC,"The Grand Strategy games by Paradox are entirely strategy based. Meaning there is no tactical gameplay. Imagine if you took Total War, eliminated the battle part (or just autoresolved everything) and made everything else 10 times more complicated. If you like Civ5, you should give it a try. I was given Eu3 for free, but it just wasn't for me. I'm a good tactician, but terrible with strategy. That being said, I recognize what other people would like with the games, but be forewarned, they are very complex.   Edit: Fixed stuff.  2nd Edit: I've had people tell me I'm really hard to play Catan with because they can't get my strategy down, to which I reply, ""What strategy?"""
patientgamers,39dzrv,snowysnowy,6,Thu Jun 11 05:43:55 2015 UTC,"Catan is just Monopoly disguised as a German board game (still fun, but the dice... oh man). Puerto Rico or Agricola is closer to strategy."

patientgamers,39dzrv,ILikeRaisinsAMA,19,Thu Jun 11 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"Well EU4 is a grand strategy game like Civ 5 is, but much more complicated. Civilization has its charm in its grand strategy with historical characters and themes that are recognizable. EU4 is more of a vaguely historical grand strategy sandbox. There arent victory conditions, it ends on January 1, 1821, every time. Whether or not you won when you get there is entirely up to you.   EU4 is much more complicated in almost every element. For example, diplomacy with nations involves royal marriages and dynasties. You can, for example, set up a royal marriage with another nation while they do not have an heir to their throne. You may get lucky and they get an heir of your dynasty with a weak claim to the throne. When their king dies, you can claim their throne for yourself... be careful, because a coalition of your enemies will surely contest this huge power play! If you are successful, you can rule their country too... eventually integrating it into your own!  War is more complicated too. The combat system has much more depth and more concerns to worry about, including the stress on your armies as they travel through rough terrain or in the winter. In EU4 the seasons matter; invading Russia in winter is a terrible, terrible idea in history and it is the same in EU4.  Trading and economy is so complicated that I am still making my best guesses as far as how some of it works, and i have 200 hours in.  Religion is incredibly important in EU4. You get bonuses for being the ""Defender of the Faith."" The Reformation in Europe almost always starts a continent-wide war that you need to plan ahead to get the most benefit from it. You can choose to get Religious ideas and focus your country on being unified in one religion, but that has its cons as some provinces will rebel, sometimes at the worst possible moment. You can choose Humanist ideas and create an accepting, tolerant nation, but you lose favor with the Pope and Catholic nations.  Colonizing has special mechanics, including developing small colonies into colonial nations, and maintaining their desire for independence. Support your enemy's colonies' desire for independence to destabilize them without having to risk your troops in a war. Trade your colonies as reparations for war, etc. Complicated there too.  Anyways, if you like the genre of game Civ 5 is, you wont have much issue with EU4's gameplay, as the skeleton is roughly the same. You just have to also like the customizable atmosphere and the sandbox quality that the complicated mechanics create. I for one love the game and havent played Civ 5 since I got it, but it isnt for everyone."
patientgamers,39dzrv,russkhan,6,Thu Jun 11 06:12:45 2015 UTC,That's a great write up and comparison to Civ.   One small niggle: The Civ games are generally considered to be 4X games rather than grand strategy.
patientgamers,39dzrv,blakeismyhomeboy,2,Thu Jun 11 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"uhh, are 4x games not grand strategy?"

Even if you're not a history nerd (like me) EU 4 is basically the grand master of strategy games. There is so much content, so much information to absorb about your nation it's insane.

EU 4 has given me over 1000 hours of play time, and it's one of the few games I will occasionally buy DLC at full price, if it affects a country I intend to play immediately. It is worth starting now at 75%. Amazing game, and 75% is well worth the price."
patientgamers,39dzrv,Kash42,4,Thu Jun 11 06:10:58 2015 UTC,"Be aware that the reason for the sale is because the new expansion, Common Sense, was just released on Tuesday. There are a few bugs that are currently plaguing the game due to the overhaul, ranging from slightly annoying all the way up to crash-to-desktop. For example, people with Macs are currently reporting major issues using the trackpad in-game. Usually the developers (Paradox) will release a follow-up patch a few days after the release of an expansion fixing these bugs, so if you do decide to buy the game and notice that it is behaving poorly, I would suggest waiting for the patch to be released and then trying again.  That said, it is a fantastic game and I would highly recommend it to anyone at full price. 75% off is a must-buy for any fan of grand strategy games, and is also the lowest price I have seen it historically."

Ok fine I totally didn't understand that game... I am not sure I should give it a try or not. CK 2 sounded so awesome but it was just so complicated.
patientgamers,39dzrv,randomguy000039,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:13:40 2015 UTC,"EU4 is slightly less complicated and more approachable. There is a still a learning cliff, but once you cross the initial hump of burden of knowledge, you would be fine. It is still quite complicated though, that is part of its charm."
patientgamers,39dzrv,Relenq,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"Eu4 is a simpler in some aspects (you dont have to manage education of heirs and there are fewer instant fail conditions), but it's a lot more complicated under the hood. You can be decent without TOO much problem, but it's not a simpler game by any means. Once you understand inheritance laws and the different Casus Belli CK2 is actually pretty simple. When it comes to EU4 you have trade and  a much more complicared diplomacy. Although I have to say that even though EU4 is, in fact, more complicated I think it might FEEL more straight forward and simple if you have played other strategy games earlier."
patientgamers,39dzrv,pataglop,2,Thu Jun 11 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"If you do buy it, I'd recommend playing on version 1.10 or earlier until a patch is released, they just released patch 1.11 with a new dlc pack and it breaks the game a lot through both bugs and badly implemented gameplay mechanics (the AI doesn't handle the new changes well at all leading to a lot of retarded crap)"

patientgamers,39be5d,hiccdewforever,10,Wed Jun 10 16:48:14 2015 UTC,I very much enjoyed the first one but it has a high ramp in difficulty near the very beginning. Risen is also quite good and in the same vein.
patientgamers,39be5d,vicarious_c,5,Wed Jun 10 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"Gothic 2 GOTY is right up there alongside Morrowind as an absolute favourite of mine.  As people have mentioned, the controls are incredibly jarring at first.  Playing it without a manual, it took me a solid five minutes to figure out how to pick objects up.  After diving into it though, the controls really do make sense and the melee combat is fantastic.  If you suss out the combos that enemy NPCs use, you can win most of the harder fights quite early on and feel amazing.  Fuck you in particular, Thieves Guild.  The third was pretty alright after installing the community patch, though you have to really jump through some hoops to learn some of the skills.  Forsaken Gods and Arcania are both garbage, in my opinion.  Risen 1 was pretty damn good, but I have very mixed feelings about the second (most of which pertain to how bad it is and how good it could have been) and I haven't played the third."

patientgamers,39be5d,Dohi64,17,Thu Jun 11 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"Gothic 1 was released ages ago, has a world much smaller than Skyrim's, and has an interface more complex than Skyrim's. Despite all this, I like it a lot more than Skyrim. The aesthetic is more interesting, the world is much more worthwhile to explore, and the combat is very gratifying. It's not for everyone, though."
patientgamers,39be5d,MrHap,6,Wed Jun 10 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"Gothic was my first open world RPG so I never really know if my love for it is nostalgia or that it is a truly great game. Seeing other people saying they enjoy it is very validating, because it really is one of my favorite games"
patientgamers,39be5d,CarTarget,2,Thu Jun 11 02:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely not nostalgia, or at least not purely. I only played the game two or three years ago."
patientgamers,39be5d,MrHap,4,Thu Jun 11 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"I agree on all counts. The Gothic world is lovingly handcrafted, while elder scrolls games are hundreds of hours of identical copy pasted dungeons, I never understood the appeal"
patientgamers,39be5d,Ensvey,11,Wed Jun 10 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"Skyrim isn't identical copy pasted dungeons, that was an Oblivion thing.  Skyrim dungeons are wonderfully designed with a clear loving eye for detail."

patientgamers,39be5d,DontAskMePlease,0,Thu Jun 11 07:42:21 2015 UTC,"Opposite for me.  Oblivion almost turned me off The Elder Scrolls, Skyrim drew me right back in, and one big reason was because how much better the dungeons were.  Ridiculously better."
patientgamers,39be5d,ElijahSnow27,0,Thu Jun 11 07:43:52 2015 UTC,Really? What did you think was better? Honest quesion.  I don't know. They were just way more pleasing to me. And I played hundreds of hours in Oblivion and 70h in Skyrim. So I saw most of the dungeons in the worlds.
patientgamers,39be5d,DontAskMePlease,0,Thu Jun 11 08:23:18 2015 UTC,"The dungeons were varied and had their own character.  The objects in them felt placed much more naturally.  The traps were more interesting, the combat was vastly improved.  But most importantly, they didn't have the same layout as every other dungeon of the same type.  If you enter a cave in Oblivion, you know exactly what the layout will be, making every cave after the first an exercise in rote repetition.  I liked everything about Skyrim better than Oblivion.  Everything."

It was counterintuitive and stifling.  It ruined what I like the most in RPGs: the slow creep from a weakling in rags beating up rats with a club to a demigod in magical armor and enchanted weaponry taking on massive and terrifying monsters."
patientgamers,39be5d,ElijahSnow27,3,Thu Jun 11 09:26:37 2015 UTC,Risen is made by the same developers I believe.  The graphics are very impressive for such an older title but quite taxing on my system.  The only thing that stands out is that nothing respawns in the world (other than new enemies every chapter) and everything done in-game is remembered.
patientgamers,39be5d,saruin,4,Wed Jun 10 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"I really love the series. I think 3 is highly underrated and that the community patch makes it really decent. The Risen series is pretty good too and made by the same studio, but not quite Gothic level. Don't bother with 4 though, it was made by a different team and doesn't really compare to the rest at all."
patientgamers,39be5d,Brittany_Delirium,3,Wed Jun 10 20:23:11 2015 UTC,"Gothic 1 and Gothic2+Expac were some of the best games I've ever played. Gothic 3... well, let's not talk about it."
patientgamers,39be5d,Kortheo,5,Wed Jun 10 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"I loved Gothic 1 and 2, but I played them with the community buxfix patches. I hear the polish is a little rough without them, but they're fantastic games with the patches. I hear Gothic 3 was rushed out the door, but there are similar community patches that allegedly fix the game and restore cut content. I'd say give it a shot!  Stay away from the expansion to Gothic 3 - it was made by some random Indian studio and I've only heard terrible things about it. Arcania, similarly, was advertised as Gothic 4, but don't touch it with a 10 ft pole."
patientgamers,39be5d,fatherrabbi,3,Wed Jun 10 20:29:10 2015 UTC,Tried to play Gothic 3 a few years after it's release because I'd heard how great the series was. Couldn't do it.

patientgamers,39be5d,Shot_Dunyun,11,Wed Jun 10 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"Love-hate relationship. Piranha Bytes has a deserved reputation for releasing buggy pieces of garbage that the community then polishes into good games. Think Elder Scrolls, but with less forgiving open-world gameplay and less freedom to play how you want.  I played 1 & 2 to completion. It was fun, but I've never felt like going back. I've tried 3 several times and just never really got past the first part.   The only things they do better than Elder Scrolls games is provide a more cohesive story. The Gothic games don't have that ""the world is about to be destroyed by dragons, but would you mind doing these 100+ side quests while you deal with it"" feeling."
patientgamers,39be5d,Stockdoodle,4,Wed Jun 10 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you. Gothic 1 was amazing when I first played it. Open world where you had little idea what you could get yourself into. Might wander across some flies, or wander into a slumbering shadowbeast. Day night cycle where people lived out their lives. The prison colony felt real. The controls were utterly bizarre until you got used to them. Than they made perfect sense. Probably some of my favorite sword combat in a game.  I don't think I ever beat Gothic 2. I can't recall but it improved on G1 in nearly every way.  I also like how European RPG developed don't go for the end of the world trope for every story. They also tend to make the open world games feel more realistic.   One day I'll probably go back and play through the series. I never got much part the first village in G3 either. Apparently there is a community patch that fixes a while lot in it."
patientgamers,39be5d,Limond,2,Wed Jun 10 19:21:40 2015 UTC,Really great two games. I played the shit out of Gothic 1 and 2 and 2 gets was harder once you install the expansion and i found it hilarious they didn't even bother getting the same voice actor for the NPCs that had additional lines.  The only good thing i can say about Gothic 3 is the music is phenomenal.
patientgamers,39be5d,WackmanV2,2,Wed Jun 10 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"Haven't played Gothic 1 and 2, but I did play Gothic 3 and I personally loved it. However, that was my first foray into the RPG genre, so I might remember it a bit fondly."
patientgamers,39be5d,Empire_Lifts_Back,2,Wed Jun 10 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"I'm German and  therefore have only played the ""true"" German versions. Is the voice acting as good in the English/other language versions of the games?"
patientgamers,39be5d,SeriousKano,2,Wed Jun 10 20:06:56 2015 UTC,The game is beloved in Poland and called classic just because of epic voice acting (especially main character). 90% of Polish gamers has played this game.
patientgamers,39be5d,multiakaMenixus,0,Wed Jun 10 22:39:34 2015 UTC,I've heard that Poland and Eastern Europe in general loves the game. Too bad the publisher ruined the series by being greedy. Are the Risen games similarly as popular in Poland?
patientgamers,39be5d,SeriousKano,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:51:37 2015 UTC,"Risen in general is not known so well as Gothic series, but people seeking for a worthy succesor of Gothic  are usually recommended to play Risen.

patientgamers,39be5d,multiakaMenixus,2,Thu Jun 11 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"The voice acting is not amazing in English, but it's decent. Sometimes I wish I understood German because I keep hearing about how awesome it is"
patientgamers,39be5d,CarTarget,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:38:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, it is and you should. Definitely one of the finest examples of German voice acting in a game. I can't think of a single NPC who stands out with a bad voice actor. Although to be fair, the German AAA market isn't that great and for some reason, the original language is almost always better than the translations. To me this is true for any language. Feels like the studio puts in more effort when it's ""their"" game as opposed to just a publisher who has to localize it."
patientgamers,39be5d,SeriousKano,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:48:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know German at all, but I like playing games in German just because the voice acting is great.  So if there are subtitles or once I'm totally familiar with the game content I'll switch over to German for added fun."

patientgamers,39be5d,vhite,2,Wed Jun 10 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"Arcania: Gothic 4 (which nobody else seems to have mentioned) is quite decent. The main advantage compared to the previous games is that it's actually got vaguely sensible controls and the difficulty isn't quite so all over the place. As someone else mentioned, Risen is along rather similar lines, though personally I think it's the lesser series; haven't played 3 yet, however.  They fall into a weird category of gaming for me where they're oddly compelling titles despite being pretty janky with a noticable lack of polish -- for instance, I'm not sure how the German-language versions hold up, but the English dub is pretty bad as I recall."
patientgamers,39be5d,strangeloup,5,Wed Jun 10 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"It's your opinion and you are entitled to it, but  for me personally Arcania was not only the worst Gothic game by far (Risen 1 included), it was a bad game by itself. It was generic, extremely boring and ultimately I found no reason to finish it. I just wish to see Piranha Bites have another shot at the franchise someday..."

I'd either recommend Euro Truck Simulator 2 if you like the idea of relaxing while driving a truck across the countryside (surprisingly more engaging than you'd think), XCOM: Enemy Unknown for a tactics-heavy game, or Civilization 4 (Complete) for a grand strategy 4X your laptop will run.

patientgamers,39b44h,seifer93,3,Wed Jun 10 20:56:57 2015 UTC,"Try ARMA 2 Combined Operations, which includes both Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead. It's probably my favorite FPS on PC. It's a little difficult to get in to because it tries to be as realistic as possible, but it's pretty sweet once you get in to the groove. I recommend trying the demo first to see if your laptop can handle it. You might have some trouble on higher settings depending on the laptop. World of Goo is a must-play and you can currently get it from the Humble Bundle for as little as $1. It's basically a bridge building game where you use little balls of goo to get across a spike pit or something along those lines. It's a simple concept, but the game has a lot of creative flexibility. Puzzle Quest is another fun puzzle game. It's your standard match-3 game with some RPG elements sprinkled in. There's also a free Marvel version which you may want to try if you don't want to put in the money. Terraria is an excellent choice for this genre. Essentially, you're put on a world and told to do whatever you want. You'll probably end up building a house and mining out a cavern below it. It's a pretty fun game and there's a lot to do. I'd also like to throw my hat in for Starbound. It's essentially Terraria but in space. It has far more emphasis on exploration (whereas Terraria is very much about base building.) They both kind of have stories, but everything is very free-form. Starbound is still in Early Access, it's still getting constant updates, but it feels very well thought out and I haven't run in to any serious performance issues, so I think your laptop should be able to run it. Don't Starve this is another open world/survival game, but it fits squarely within the horror genre. I've never been more afraid of the dark than with this game. There's nothing quite like realizing that you're out of wood and seeing the darkness slowly engulf you and little eyes peering out at you. I highly recommend it. FTL: Faster Than Light is really really good. It's a space-travel simulator where you control a federation starship on his way to make a last stand against the rebel army which mostly controls the known universe. The game involves a lot of juggling different systems, deciding how to handle different situations in space, (e.g. do you let everyone in a burning space station die or risk your own crew to save them?,) and fight other starships. Along the way you'll discover unseen wonders, solve mysteries, and help (or destroy) various civilizations."

It's not designed as a fun sandbox for the player like 3 and 4 are, but rather an oppressively difficult and dark look into a war-torn African setting.  It doesn't hit all the right notes, but it offers a ton of player freedom, especially for a 7 year old game.  Puzzle - I'm not a huge puzzle game fan aside from the first Portal, but I'll go ahead and suggest Antichamber because I just picked it up in the current Humble Bundle and I'm excited to get started.  Open World - While I suppose Far Cry 2 fits this as well, I'm going to go with Assassin's Creed II.  It's the best of the series by far, building on the first by presenting a more coherent world with a more fleshed out protagonist.  It also added tons of new assassination moves and tools.  Fantastic game beginning to end.  Horror/Survival - I'm really not an expert here, but... Dead Space 2, I guess?  That's the horror games I've played more than any other.  Resident Evil 4 is supposed to be good, too.  Strategy/Simulation - I actually have to give two suggestions, here, one strategy and one simulation.  For strategy, Civilization V Complete is a must have.  It's the only game that I can marathon for 5, 6, 7 hours on end.  Then for simulation, Cities Skylines.  It's a more recent game, but it scales well.  It's like SimCity but built by people who know what they're doing.  Tons of mod support means it will take a long time to get stale."

Myst?  But that's more of a puzzle-adventure game.  If it's a Tetris-like game you're looking for, you should try emulating NES and Gameboy consoles (Dr. Mario and Yoshi's Cookie are two other examples). Ultima VII, Fallout 1 & 2.  They are RPGs, but with a heavy emphasis on adventure/exploring around and talking to NPCs.  (Ultima Underworld is another one, but it's in the first-person point of view with dungeon-crawling elements.) Not into Horror or Survival.  Alone in the Dark is the earliest example I know of. There's a huge variety of both (sub-genres), so I'll split it up:     For real-time strategy:  Age of Empires II, the Star Trek Armada games (I've only played the sequel, though). For turn-based strategy:  Master of Orion 1 & 2. Flight sims (need flightstick):  TIE Fighter.  Wing Commander: Privateer (also a trading sim). Other sims:  Earthsiege (mech simulation; I haven't played it, but I've heard good things).    Some of these games run under DOSBox.

patientgamers,396xwv,fydo,3,Wed Jun 10 08:20:56 2015 UTC,Then you risk doubling up on games. The store let's you know if you already own a game/DLC but the inventory does not. I tried doing the inventory thing for a bit last sale and had a glitch with checkout saying it failed so I checked out a second time and ended up buying 2 copies of Sid Meyers pirates by accident :(
patientgamers,396xwv,DrCockenstein,7,Wed Jun 10 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily a hard-and-fast rule. Valve also started that they may still issue refunds in some circumstances which fall outside those criteria. The rule as they present it seems to be ""within 2 weeks of purchase, with less than 2 hours of play time, you qualify for an otherwise unconditional refund. More than two weeks after purchase, or more than 2 hours of play time, and we'll review it on a case-by-case basis.""  The fact that they so clearly spell out the refund-and-rebuy thing as totally legit sounds to me like it may be an exception to the 2-hour play time rule."
patientgamers,396xwv,ducttape83,3,Wed Jun 10 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, but I think it would depend on how much playtime you do rack up in that time period. If you get 6-8 hours out of a game over the course of a few days, and then it goes on sale, I'm not sure how that case would work out. From the perspective of Valve, you got many hours of enjoyment out of the purchase you made before it was on sale, meaning you obviously valued the game higher than those who had patience to wait for a sale otherwise you'd have done the same.  I think it is tough to say how they will be handled, but I think the more playtime on the game the weaker your argument becomes to get a refund."
patientgamers,396xwv,thisonehereone,2,Wed Jun 10 03:54:27 2015 UTC,"People have been reporting refunds can take hours or even days to take effect. With something as time sensitive as these sales, it's probably best just to keep doing things we've always done them"

Great, colorful visions to behold.  There'll also be a third character you'll pick up along the way that you'll either love or hate. I thought he was hilarious. In fact all three characters have a great team dynamic.  I felt the controls were always a bit clunky or, yes, floaty, but you get used to it.  7/10 is the rating I'd give it myself.

It's a different style of RTS than what you would be used to if you were into typical ones like SC, WC, or C&C games.

As for playing the first two...Maybe...I myself am working my way through The Witcher 1 for the first time 42 hours in and it is awesome.

patientgamers,398bis,rarelypost,5,Wed Jun 10 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'll comment and say that I couldn't get into the first game, so I skipped and played the 2nd game first. Witcher 2 was a great game, and I highly recommend it.  However, I'm halfway through the first game after picking it up again, and I'm enjoying it a lot more now that I understand the world and characters better. The combat is meh, but it's not that bad on easy. I'm loving the first game so far, it was just harder to enjoy at first than the 2nd game.  Tl:DR: They're all great games, although the first is a little difficult to get into. Don't worry too much about playing them in order, you'll still enjoy the games if you start with 2 or 3."
patientgamers,398bis,DrStalker,3,Wed Jun 10 00:39:55 2015 UTC,"Some combat tips for The Witcher 2 would be to use your potions, use your signs, and dodge/parry attacks a lot.  It's not a simple game when it comes to combat and you will die a lot if you try to treat it like God of War or a game where you can take out 20 guys while they all stand around waiting for you to murder them."
patientgamers,398bis,Harb67,3,Wed Jun 10 01:00:35 2015 UTC,"Another tip; the tutorial will teach you a few things that don't work in the actual game because you need to spend skill points on them, so you will get frustrated that things like counterattack don't work.  The prelude section is the hardest part of the game."

patientgamers,398bis,brinz1,2,Wed Jun 10 01:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's like Dark Souls in terms of combat.  I know when I started I kept dying because it only takes two or three hits to kill you and people will gang up on you.  I never use potions in games, but a Witcher has to use potions so I had to actively remember to keep my potions up when I was in a combat area."

patientgamers,398bis,BobVosh,2,Thu Jun 11 14:53:15 2015 UTC,"Recently in the same situation as you. I had played Number 1 for about 2 hours quite a few years ago and tbh, going back to it was really quite difficult. I know that it's a good game with a great story and atmosphere but I don't think it's aged well. The combat is fine but the general production value of it was quite low for its time. Give it a go, see if you enjoy it but I would say that you can skip it if you feel like it is a slog.  I skipped to 2 (after watching videos of 1's plot) and 2 is overall a big step up. Some say it lost its dark atmosphere in 2 but I think it's an amazing game and I never really felt like I missed much or was having a worse experience for skipping 1. 2 was great fun on its own; the combat, voice acting and story is all an improvement. The general 'vibe' of the game is fantastic,  it has this eerie, sort of mythical art design that works wonders with some surprisingly strong graphics. Really a beautiful game.  I usually feel like I have to play everything before going onto a sequel but for this I felt no disadvantage.  I'm sure players of 1 knew some more details, but nothing you can't catch up on easily.  I would recommend playing 2 at least; it's a great game that hasn't aged at all. It also gives you a nice prologue to 3 as the events are quite closely linked. Don't feel like it's vital however. I've now moved onto 3 and it's amazing!"

Bu-ut you might wanna just breeze through the first one on easy since actual gameplay in it is far from good. But story and atmosphere is well worth the effort."
patientgamers,398bis,formerdigguser,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:49:37 2015 UTC,"Skip the Witcher, just go for 2.  Witcher 1 has a really good plot line, but mechanically I despised it.    Well, for 1.5 it is probably worth checking out anyway.  But I didn't really like it, the combat feels like a rhythm game more than action or rpg style."

It has a great story that I was actually interested in. And there is tons of stuff to do after beating the main story line, especially if you get the dlc's. Everything about this game is super fun, it's like grand theft auto with arkham city fist fighting but it also has very good shooting mechanics.  That being said you really can't choose wrong between the three games you have mentioned, they are all very good in their own right but Sleeping dogs better fits the criteria that you have mentioned."
patientgamers,398ewc,tsuchinokoDemon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:58:09 2015 UTC,Sounds good! Which DLCs do you recommend? The digital edition that's up rn contain 3 but I think they're just customization packs.
patientgamers,398ewc,tsuchinokoDemon,3,Wed Jun 10 01:18:16 2015 UTC,"Nightmare in northpoint, Zodiac Tournament, and year of the snake are the big ones. Zodiac Tournament was a blast! I tried to enjoy nightmare in northpoint but couldn't. And I have never played year of the snake but it gives you more of the main story."
patientgamers,398ewc,NekoiNemo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:31:56 2015 UTC,"Nightmare one. It's great and absolutely hilarious. Year of the snake is quite boring and really padded out. And zodiac Tournament tries to imitate those old ""it's so bad it's good"" kung-fu movies but misses ""it's good"" part by a country mile. Fighting in it is more or less decent in some scenes, but aside from that it's almost waste of time."
patientgamers,398ewc,hritter,0,Wed Jun 10 08:29:44 2015 UTC,"The only thing you should know about Sleeping Dogs is that the ending comes WAY sooner than you think.  Like, they just didn't have enough time and decided to ship it as it was.  My advice is to take it easy with the sidequests and exploring the map and just being all parkour and shit because when you think the plot is just picking up, it'll end abruptly in your face."

patientgamers,398ewc,Massgyo,6,Thu Jun 11 16:35:48 2015 UTC,Deus Ex by far. I did really like Sleeping Dogs but I don't see a ton of replay value. Hitman wasn't bad but I liked the previous Hitman soooo much there was no way I wasn't going to be disappointed.
patientgamers,398ewc,Homeschooled316,3,Wed Jun 10 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"Is it DE: HR director's cut or the original version without all the bugs? If you're looking for great story AND some replayability, I think Sleeping Dogs is the only one that has that."
patientgamers,398ewc,Homeschooled316,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:49:33 2015 UTC,It's the Director's Cut. Is there too much of a difference between the two though?
patientgamers,398ewc,NekoiNemo,2,Wed Jun 10 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"The director's cut was made using an old pre-release version of the game (some even suspect first beta or pre-beta build). It was never patched once despite fan pleas. Any bugs that were squashed in the months leading up to and after release of the original game are in. It might be alright, but you'll want to read up on it before buying to decide for yourself whether the bugs will bother you.  Other wise, DE:HR is probably the best of those 3 games."
patientgamers,398ewc,Homeschooled316,2,Wed Jun 10 02:11:06 2015 UTC,"But it also said to fix some of the worst design mistakes crimes of the game, like bosses. Which is really compelling argument to go for Director's Cut."
patientgamers,398ewc,WeirdSkittles,2,Wed Jun 10 08:32:06 2015 UTC,"The bosses were the worst crimes, yes, but they also account for a tiny portion of gameplay, time-wise.  Regardless, it's impossible to get a digital copy of the original anyway, so director's cut is what's gonna happen."

patientgamers,398ewc,rarelypost,3,Wed Jun 10 03:46:00 2015 UTC,"I would go with Hitman and Sleeping Dogs. Hitman has your story and replayability in spades. Sleeping Dogs has a lot of open world activities and good story, but pretty much no replayability after you've beaten it once.  Since you don't have original DX on PS Store you might as well try Human Revolution, but i wouldn't recommend it when you can get other two of games you mentioned."

patientgamers,398ewc,BadWhippet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:55:42 2015 UTC,"Sleeping Dogs, Deus Ex, Hitman in that order. Sleeping Dogs was my favorite out of the three, it's my favorite crime game so far, the graphics are great, story is iffy at times but there's certain characters who are phenomenal, and it's just overall really fun. Deus Ex was a great RPG/FPS hybrid, the upgrade system was my favorite, I didn't care too much for the story but the gameplay was good too. Hitman's my least favorite of the three but still visually appealing and a strategic stealth game that might appeal to you more than me."
patientgamers,398ewc,markherrington5,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:10:14 2015 UTC,"Sleeping Dogs or Hitman Absolution (I personally can't get into Deus Ex HR despite several attempts).  If you want a full and beautiful open-world experience, get Sleeping Dogs.  If you love stealth and meeting the challenges of taking out targets in multiple creative ways, then get Hitman Absolution.  Is the Sleeping Dogs 'Definitive Edition' available on Playstation?  If so, get that.  It's even more gorgeous and comes with all the DLC at no extra cost.  I'm a PC gamer so I don't know whether it's different, but buying the DLC for the original version automatically awarded me with most of the cars, outfits and fighting points so I had nothing left to play for.  If you can get the Definitive, that problem has been fixed.  If not, and the problem is the same on Playstation as it is for PC with the original (hopefully another Playstation-version owner can confirm), avoid getting the DLC until you've played the main campaign."

It has a very striped down version of batman combat that can be rather annoying at times but the sums of the parts in this game are really awesome. Presentation, music, story (for how little their is), narration all come together in an awesome blend. It's like playing an old school game of D&D. Highly recommend.    Gothic One of the first open world RPGs I ever played. The controls are bizarre, being released in 2001, but once you get the hang of them they are actually really cool. Gives the combat a real unique feel as you have to string combos together with how you swing and you can advance/retreat while chaining attacks together. The second one in the series, aptly named Gothic 2, is a superior game in every way but it is a direct sequel to the first game so I always recommend a play through of Gothic 1 before hand. Gothic 3 isn't so hot. Never got very far into it. There is a community patch that supposedly fixes a whole lot of the problems but I have yet to play it.

patientgamers,397y3t,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 10 10:33:55 2015 UTC,"Well, it was about 10 years ago but Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy. It's a highly underrated and forgotten PS2/Gamecube era game, set in Egypt in King Tut's time. You play as Sphinx, a lion/human hybrid (like the statue!), and you encounter Egyptian mythological figures and fight your way to Uruk to stop a evil lord named Set. I loved the setting, it was so unique and the gameplay felt mature enough to fit the setting while still remaining interesting. There is no speech (but there is text), which was just a small gripe I had with the game. Highly recommend it if anyone can get their hands on a copy.  Aside from that, Savant Ascent is a recent title. Savant's a EDM (usually) artist, and his friends over at DPad Studios (devs of upcoming Owlboy), made a short game, a shootemup using assets from Savant's likeness. It's short, but there is a endless mode to compensate for it. The music included is amazing, although his discography expands greatly past this, the gameplay is arcade-y and fun enough to replay every now and then or try your hand at endless mode. The graphics are pixel art-ish, but beautiful nonetheless and the gameplay is again arcade-y. Highly recommend, it sales for $1 on Steam frequently, but is usually $2 at any other time."

After that, I think there was quite a lot of free reign. The story was actually written in French first of all. My involvement came in later when the story was adapted into English. I had to pore through the books constantly to keep the language as close to GRRM's style as possible. As with many games, the schedule was really tight and the whole game ended up being really rushed. I was so excited to hear some of my lines in the game, but when I first booted up the game and heard the voice acting, my heart sank. Voice acting is so important.

It's been a while now so I can't remember it too well, but it was particularly gritty if I remember rightly. As I mentioned in an earlier comment, credit for the plot goes to the original French writers. My job was to 'transcreate' it, which was to translate and re-write it for the English audience.  I am working on a few other games at the moment, but totally different types of game.

patientgamers,397y3t,sphks,2,Wed Jun 10 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Excellent choice starting from there.  In general, I liked all that they've to offer with just a few gripes.  The Whispered World is a fantasy story with an interesting premise.  Nothing we haven't seen before but it's one of those ""the ending changes everything"" kind of games.  Common criticisms are the annoying lisp of the protagonist which you just have to get used to, and the (at times) obtuse puzzles.  A sequel was also recently announced to come next year, but I wouldn't watch the trailer right now as it has spoilers to the first game.  The Deponia trilogy is basically a less serious analog to the Dark Eye trilogy.  Another one of those ""conniving scoundrel who ends up saving the world"".  Alot of people say that they hate playing as a jerk protagonist in an adventure game but I think it's a perfect excuse for all those Adventure Game puzzle solutions you do anyway.  Then there's their recent title Dead Synchronicity, about a man who lost his memory in an end of the world setting.    In general, Daedalic's Adventure Games always have this running theme of always starting well-enough.  But as you play, you get this sneaking suspicion that the world is masking an undesirable side, so when that twist comes you are completely taken by surprise."

It's in Early Access so maybe not in the spirit of this sub, but I dare to added because it's very enjoyable already and there's very little out there with that kind of gameplay (Arena FPS)."
patientgamers,397fwr,Arthorius,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"I have played most of the Emergencies and 2012/13/14 was the best in the series. Just don't get E5, it's a huge disappointment."
patientgamers,397fwr,Wadziu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:34:29 2015 UTC,Which one of the three you named is the best (considering that I would buy the expansions and stuff)
patientgamers,397fwr,Wadziu,2,Thu Jun 11 20:53:39 2015 UTC,I think you can get only EM 2014 on Steam as it contains whole campaign from 2012 and additional missions from 2013 and 2014 expansions. Thats lot of gameplay hours for 7 euro + lot of cool mods from community!
patientgamers,397fwr,Wadziu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  By the way, it's currently discounted 50% to 10â¬."
patientgamers,397fwr,Wadziu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:58:49 2015 UTC,It shows 7â¬ for me :D
patientgamers,396wje,CaptainRoc,3,Tue Jun 9 18:12:12 2015 UTC,Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare is surprisingly fun and addictive.
patientgamers,396wje,gk3coloursred,2,Tue Jun 9 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"Gears of War 1-3 are some great games with single player, online and split screen campaign co-op, and online multiplayer modes, though I don't think 1 or 2 has a big online presence anymore.  You'd probably want to just skip to 3 for multiplayer but the campaign in each of them is worth playing through at least once in single player or co-op.  Be sure to grab Just Cause 2 and the Xbox One games for free this month."
patientgamers,396wje,rarelypost,2,Tue Jun 9 19:37:52 2015 UTC,I'd recommend Titanfall.  I love the feeling of moving fast and wall running.  There's a lot of depth to it and all the multiplayer DLC is free now.  It's the best online multiplayer I've played in years and it works reliably online (unlike the newest Halo collection).  There are just so many awesome moments in Titanfall that you're sure to have fun with it.
patientgamers,396wje,phbohn2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:33:42 2015 UTC,some newer halo
patientgamers,396wje,BabyRager,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:36:44 2015 UTC,Halo 3 and Halo Reach are still really fun. Avoid Halo 4 if you don't like COD though.
patientgamers,396wje,dray0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:11:03 2015 UTC,"Halos like others said if you like a more LAN feeling FPS. CoD if you'd like the opposite. CoD is best played on console, so try one of them, preferably Black Ops 1."
patientgamers,396wje,Lucarai,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:32:41 2015 UTC,"If this is an Xbox 360, which it sounds like it is, I would suggest Halo 3, Halo Reach, Gears of War 3, Forza Horizon, Dark Souls, and Skate 3."
patientgamers,396wje,markherrington5,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:29:01 2015 UTC,I booted up Halo 4 the other night for the first time in ages and damn is it a lot of fun still. Had a buddy come over the next day and we played for 3 or 4 hours and had a blast.
patientgamers,395873,beboppin_n_scottin,4,Tue Jun 9 10:04:52 2015 UTC,"Resistance 2's multiplayer was it's crown jewel. I loved that games online especially the co-op. Spent hundreds of hours with it. I do agree the campaigns are generally slog fests, but enjoyable."
patientgamers,395873,unspoken_lies,2,Tue Jun 9 13:45:38 2015 UTC,"Having not played the games, it really looks like the series suffers from the ""everything must be graybrown"" syndrome of last gen, with the third the only game with any color, and that's off putting to me."
patientgamers,395873,markherrington5,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"I actually think the third game hurts itself with the ""3"" in its title. It can really stand on its own and doesn't rely on much prior knowledge, and from my experiences, it's definitely the one to get in the series."
patientgamers,395873,ForeignAlphabet,2,Fri Jun 12 11:02:02 2015 UTC,"The first RFOM had probably the best online format I have ever played. It had a great friends/recent list (this was before you could press the ps button and go back to the playstation main menu during a game), a great clan system (you had actual clan leaders with pages and you were invited to clans, it wan't just a tag that anyone could put on), and great custom games. Anyone could create their own custom games and modify what weapons were available and how much damage they did. It led to some cool niche communites; people who specialized in shotty matches or melee matches, 1 hit kill ctf, 60% damage sniper matches... it was great.  Unfortunately those servers are shut down now, so being a patient gamer cost you the pleasure of playing the first title online. I probably spent thousands of hours on that first game online over the 10 years they kept those servers going"
patientgamers,395873,ForeignAlphabet,2,Thu Jun 11 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the customization, I was pretty impressed that across all three games they allowed fully remappable controls. Very rare and appreciated thing to see in a console shooter.  While it does seem like I missed out on the online front, I don't regret it too much, I already had games that I was completely dedicated to so even if I did get it in its prime I don't know how much I'd have been able to put into online play anyway."
patientgamers,395873,UserNameBenzy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:00:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah the custom was really nice. I played a lot of melee (the scene was pretty tight) so I had the r1 button mapped to melee hit and some other stuff I don't remember.   I never played the next two, I might play the 3rd now that I read this"
