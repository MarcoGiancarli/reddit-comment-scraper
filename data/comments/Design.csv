Headline stuff—possibly right-justified—hangs off the line to the left, with secondary or tertiary information below it.  Hanging off to the right is a main copy block and the tagline/call to action in the lower right.  Rethink the copy to make as much of it as possible a punchy paragraph rather than a bunch of random bullet points.  Use only four font sizes and two typefaces.  When you've quieted down the information quite a bit, reintroduce a bit of whimsy.  Tilt the line and copy blocks 11 degrees relative to the page, or have a color circle with a kicker headline that acts as counterpoint to the sobriety elsewhere."

Don't suppose you can find out how many people use that option for previous years? If it was, I dunno, under 5% of conversions I'd say axe the form. But they probably haven't kept track of that.    You say old people, so there probably isn't much you can do to shrink text. Maybe a couple things like that 'proud to present' bar at the top, not needing the day of the week for that first mention of the event date.    That call to action ""Your fellow Realtors...be there too"" seems pretty ineffectual, marginalized by it's positioning, and secondary to the other information about how it's a popular event and the guest speaker is great. Maybe it could be removed.    Return address is clearly in a bad position if there has to be that arrow pointing to it from the form.    At least the sponsor logos at the bottom aren't out of control...    So yeah, there are some improvements you could make over the old design, if you have the time."

Design,3dilzi,Cbird54,28,Thu Jul 16 17:40:51 2015 UTC,In-n-out burger was a restaurant founded way before the need to modernize it at this point. It would be like McDonalds changing their golden arches to a 'M' from Helvetica.  Modernizing a brand doesn't always mean refreshing or re-branding. Sometimes it can be as simple as extending secondary brand elements and applying them in a fresh and modern way.
Design,3dilzi,theirisnetwork,9,Thu Jul 16 16:33:28 2015 UTC,GREAT point about existing elements.
Design,3dilzi,masadac,15,Thu Jul 16 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"The thing I take away from this most, is that you need to understand the company you are designing for.  Business cards and envelopes aren't the priority for fast food restaurants.  I have no idea why you made a printed menu, those don't even exist in in-n-outs.  What would be the use for any of those menus?  You look like you were designing for a cool new fusion restaurant, not a fast food joint.  Also, from your new logo, the patty ends or whatever stick out too far for my taste (pun).  It's making it look more like an asian symbol from a distance than a minimalist hamburger.  Lastly, your red/yellow stripe design looks a little too reminiscent of the Boeing logo in Spain and the Iberian peninsula for me."

Design,3dilzi,adannada,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:21:37 2015 UTC,Horrible. Re-design without thoroughly researching the brand itself is a sin to (and of much) modern design.

Design,3dilzi,robots_and_cancer,9,Mon Jul 20 19:13:40 2015 UTC,I think the biggest problem with the redesign is that it throws away the old design completely instead of trying to evolve the old design to where loyal customers could still identify the brand. Even the fun yellow and red are mostly removed in favor of a bland dark gray.
Design,3dilzi,DrVanBuren,7,Thu Jul 16 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"Let me a dick for a second. But rightfully so.  You say you're a student, so let me steer you currently so you don't make this mistake again. When you do redesigns like this (or whatever way you want to call it so that people don't get mad at you), they have to be well thought out and researched. Like, I don't give a crap if this was ""for fun"" or an ""experiment"", when you make something and present it, we will tear it apart based on it's own laurels.   Which, is a simple critique. As a concept, this fails. Because in terms of the brand, this isn't what In-N-Out is. They don't have business cards, they don't have menus like your's, and they don't have that... thing you have in the top right. This actually looks more like a dribbble template of a branding package that you decided to put your new logo into than an actual proposition.  I say this because your technical skills are there, but everything else isn't. What you did was something that a bunch of mindless dribbble backpackers would yell out ""Oh! Great work!"" but not give you anything constructive.   Next time you do something, make sure that there's some time spent on it, because guess what, when you start applying for places, people don't accept the excuse ""it was only for fun"". You'll end up being the person a couple years from now posting on here that you can't get a job and don't know why.   The key difference between people who are awesome and people who are on 99Designs is research and planning. Take a second to Google what their existing branding is. Yes, rebrands can be different, but the soul still needs to be there. That's the key problem with what you did here. You took something as fun and happy as Coca-Cola and decided that it needed to be generic and brooding.   Another big reason why research is good is because it guides you on what stuff needs to be redesign and what doesn't. If you did your homework (which you should've, you're a student) you could've quickly learned that this brand is doing perfectly fine, and doesn't need a rebrand. It's the equivalent of you telling us that Nike needed a rebranding and make it look like everything else.  You'll do fine, but understand that this project, as a branding exercise is not good. As a logo? Not much better. There's not a lot of thought put into it (based on what you said) and you didn't do enough research on the legacy of what the name and brand are to justify redesigning it. That is, unless you think a comment like this can hold well during a creative review:   I was just thinking cooked meat, is all. The shape is quite literal in that it represents a burger that is both in and out of the bun. Honestly, color and shape alike were just a silly concepts that I fleshed out a little further.   I saw this as a dick, because your work is good, but you're just brushing off a lot of things. Yes, keep making work and be positive about it, but make sure that the work you do has purpose. Otherwise, you'll end up being an unemployed dribbble designer living in your parents basement, making one-off shots like this and being confused that no one wants to pay you for your services."

Most fast food burger restaurants tend to use bright reds and yellow because its said that, psychologically, it reinforces hunger. Also lighter browns. The shape is also confusing, is it supposed to be a grill or a square burger? Maybe revisiting the colors and icons will help this out a bit."

It doesn't match their personality, message, or history (simple, family owned, classic, casual... and of course, delicious).  If you choose to develop this concept further, it might help if you researched the company more considering you haven't been to an In N Out. Did you know they have bible verse references printed on the bottom of their cups and other paper goods? Family owned business. They're known for their paper hats, red aprons, super-friendly employees, crossed palm trees, and their animal-style fries located on their ""secret"" menu. If you want to change the visuals of the logo/brand, you could start with something influenced by the actual restaurant experience itself.  You may also get better feedback if this particular redesign was used on a fictional burger joint rather than one with a very well-established logo.  Not saying In N Out's branding couldn't be adjusted and improved, but that this isn't the right direction for this particular company."

Like it or not, even in design, we all end up stealing (or getting ""inspired"") from something which is superior. I've caught myself doing it multiple times.  But, when he first admits that it looks like it, and then his counter-argument is ""Well, a lot of things look like that"" he's ignoring the fact that Xiaomi because famous because they copied designs and sold them at a cheaper price in China, because a lot of people don't care about the genuine product, they just want something similar.   He then goes on and says that ""every smart phone kind of looks like every smartphone"". Which is true. But back in 2007, phones looked like this. Apple then decided to make it look like this. The things he's saying, that smartphones need a home button and rounded edges, that's things that Apple has been doing now for eight years, and rightly deserves to say that it inspired a bunch of people to follow suit.   You can tell too that Hugo Barra is not trying to defend Xiaomi's legacy. He's careful with his words. He's telling them that only in the last twelve months they've been innovating. There was also a knock about the CEO trying to look similar to Steve Jobs, and says that he doesn't do that anymore.   All in all, I just have to say that it's okay dude to say that your company initially went and copied or was inspired by someone who was a leader in the market.

It's be widely accepted that the Logitech MX Master is one of the best mouse out there, but it's not colorful at all. So are they going to do a swatch update to this? Cause I personally love the subdued colors and sleek menacing look to it."
Design,3dikcx,theirisnetwork,2,Fri Jul 17 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"You know, I didn't think of Logitech that way until you mentioned it and now I think that the rebrand was a bit of a misstep. If they are truly known for a premier line of ergonomic accessories they totally could have done a sleek, cold ""BMW of peripherals"" thing. That MX Master you linked gets it's dimension from the clean lines and that polygon texture and if they had worked up from that I'd be much more likely to associate Logitech with good design. Like i said, I'm kind of ignorant about that company as a whole but I feel like DesignStudio (which has a very impressive body of work btw) really jumped the gun and overlooked a lot of great, usable stuff that already existed for Logitech and threw it away in the name of ""fun""."
Design,3dikcx,VOMIT_WIFE_FROM_HELL,3,Fri Jul 17 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"It sucks because in terms of their branding materials, someone over at corporate knows that the mouse is one of the key products that people like but... holy crap it does not work with the current branding.  This is the slight issue that third party agencies have, which is why people are consolidating their design in-house. When you have one of the best products your company has not work with the proposed branding, there's no discussion, you kill it. Instead, it seems like they want to do two things.  One, fun colorful branding, but accept that the MX Master isn't going to fit, and make it look awkward (which it does). Or two, and I hope this isn't the case, they decide to change the ID and look and feel of this mouse to match the colorful branding. This might happen. I am going to feel sad if the well designed Master ends up looking like the one on the right."
Design,3dikcx,theirisnetwork,2,Fri Jul 17 22:14:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, the more you post the more I see this as a travesty and a money sink for Logitech. Usually I feel like black plastic has a gross 90s feel to it but that mouse is super sharp. They really could have just photographed it on a glass tabletop with an off-black background and that would sell it way more than some kawaii pop color background. Another thing I don't usually respond well to is the disembodied user thing (it was fresh in '08 for sure but not so much now), but I can picture my own hand tucked into that mouse with no effort and the fact that they paid to have such nice design photographed as a stand-alone unit on a flat background is a sin. If they do end up doing what you (probably accurately) predicted and make it ""fun"" it would be a huge waste... but I bet they will because that was most definitely a huge expensive rebrand and no marketing director is going to take a hit to the ego by admitting the product itself doesn't work in this context."

After Effects is great, but for more traditional frame-by-frame animation you can do a lot better. Either Flash or Photoshop."
Design,3ddfp5,YanwarC,2,Thu Jul 16 08:23:40 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say this without sounding snooty, so know it's coming from a nice person when I tell you that I'm in the field and I've used both programs extensively. I'm not sure what gave you the idea that Flash is better suited for animation and video effects than After Effects, or maybe the specifics of my claim were unclear to you before, so I'll explain. Flash is great for a lot of amazing software applications. It has a multi-faceted program structure, with Flash Media Encoder offering some video tools specially geared toward handling file formats for streaming media, a function in which it is unparalleled amongst the rest of the Adobe suite. It's Flash Builder program will deploy multi-platform, natively running mobile applications. Flex is another program in the Flash suite that lets programmers build Flash-based data-driven applications with much less hassle than traditional Flash. These are all newish tools that uniquely complement the core tool, known historically as just ""Flash"".  Currently, Flash Professional – the flagship product of the Flash suite offering – is the continuation of the original Macromedia program that was in many ways a successor to the long defunct Macromedia Director. Macromedia sold much of their software property rights directly to Adobe sometime around 2002 or so. I was using it then and I still use it now. It still supports the nice user-interface for animation tools and interactivity, but its user-interface has changed very little over the years, instead advancing on its programming tools and scripting language, known as ActionScript. These tools still have a solid place in the production of apps and video games for mobile, web and phones, although much more limited these days on the web side of things, gearing towards HTML5/JS generators that are currently very limited compared to some alternative tools and custom-built code. For anyone who has more knowledge of Flash than the typical knee-jerk ""Flash is horrible"" or ""Flash is dead"", development of these mobile apps and games are currently Flash's mainstay, although there was a time in the last couple of years that YouTube and Grooveshark used it extensively as the front-end to their streaming media application. VMWare still uses it for their entire front-end in their enterprise sysdmin platform, but that won't last. There was also a time, many years ago now, when it was very common to see a gimmicky Flash intro on many simplistic websites as a part of many corporate marketing campaigns. Perhaps this is what gave you the idea that Flash adequately handles video effects, but this is incorrect. These types of sites are long gone and many of them employed After Effects or a similar tool for the heavy-lifting on the video effects end of things. I've even seen some people do mock video editing and effects in Flash, but it's just not made for that at all, which is why they have a full suite of software they want to sell you for when you finally realize Flash just isn't suited for it. After Effects for effects and Premiere for editing, with quite a bit of feature creep between them. If you want to go to work in Hollywood doing the fancy 3D rotoscope work, or titles that catch on fire and woo the ladies, then you don't want to mention Flash at your job interview.   If you're like OP and you just want to animate a logo, make it move around and do something interesting, Flash will be adequate, but he'll be stuck with a tool that lacks any raster-based video effects, unable to accomplish interesting titling effects without much added, unnecessary work, features very little Smart-Objects integration with Photoshop and mainly only recognizes Illustrator format as line art. These are all things that After Effects handles to make it the video production industry standard, far and wide. Just ask any film producer.   I'm guessing that you're thinking that Flash is better suited for streaming video, in which case you'd be correct, but even that's dying unless Adobe turns it around and makes a decent standards-compliant tool. They've been struggling in putting out an adequate HTML5/JavaScript generating Flash for some reason, I'm guessing probably because they spend more money on development than most companies and programmers continue to prefer hand-coding. There's also the issue of constantly evolving standards that become pretty demanding and expensive. It's a great tool for many and a cumbersome crutch for many more, but it was intentionally created to have a separate purpose from programs like Adobe Premiere and After Effects. There's also Blender, which is free and open source and does everything that After Effects can do and more.   Photoshop, on the other hand, is definitely not the tool you want for video effects, editing or any of that. It's great to comp up your art frames for importing into After Effects, but that's about it when it comes to video. You can dump an animated sequence or a GIF, but it's extremely rudimentary."
Design,3ddfp5,tvshopceo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"I'm also in the field. And no, Flash is not the program to use for ""video effects"". But that is not what I said. What I said is that it is a better tool for traditional, hand drawn, frame-by-frame animation. If you're looking to do animation the way that people used to do with cel sheets, then After Effects is an incredibly cumbersome tool to use. Flash is by far a more commonly used tool for that sort of animation. It's not perfect, not even great, but it's established. Something like ToonBoom is obviously the best option but that's arguably on a less casual level.   Also, you'd be surprised how far you can get with Photoshop."
Design,3ddfp5,gburning_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:08:56 2015 UTC,You can do shape tweens in after effects and they pull in nicely from Illustrator. I was humbly surprised. I definitely prefer After Effects after years of doing this in Flash. It take me about as long.
Design,3ddfp5,bkv,2,Fri Jul 17 00:26:03 2015 UTC,Yes any animation you can do in flash you can do in AE. AE doesn't deal with any interactivity tho. If it's only for video output and not part of a game or interactive UI then AE is the best to use.

I was fine up until right after the bounce back when the animation completely stops, right before the ying-yang transformation. The stop is jarring and breaks your animation's flow. It makes it feel overlong. I think that you should either start with the dots close together and then transform them into yin-yang, or take out the bounce back and just have the dots collide and spin into yin-yang.  Example 1 | Example 2  Also, the black bars that emerge from your logo seem to conflict with the feel of the rest of your stuff. All the other elements, your animation, the logo, and blog name are soft and fun and nice, but the bars felt cold and industrial to me. I don't know if you guys have a podcast (a ""radio"" type thing) that helps justify them, but they feel at odds with your branding. I do think the animation benefits from something appearing or changing in your logo before the name reveal though."

Design,3da0c6,yeartwo,18,Tue Jul 14 22:49:37 2015 UTC,I suspect the reasoning is that it helps the mitt look like it has some depth to it. Look how flat the mitt in the left of your image looks as compared to the one on the right.

But I hope you understand it's because I really liked what you initially did, and just felt maybe a slight tweak could improve it dramatically.   Interestingly in your new version, by making the curve of the 'M' tangent with the 'B', you have made the non-concentric cut out of the bottom M more pronounced, and to me it is now working significantly better. The previous version was just a bit too close to concentric, so it looked like it was an accident. But now it is really clearly 2 different curves, as someone else mentioned it adds some depth that a constant line thickness wouldn't have.  And the overall form looks more like a baseball mitt now.   I think it's cool as hell!"

The way the circle tapers off near the top, the differing thickness in lines, the off centre baseball; They all give the logo a slight sense of perspective, movement, and depth... not to mention the colour change... it went from golden, contrasty and understated, to vomit orange in your face.  That's just my take."

Design,3d92v2,dremdee,38,Tue Jul 14 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"Electrical engineer here to comment on what everyone is saying about the magnets affecting the speakers.  A speaker is typically designed as a permanent magnet mounted to the case with an electromagnet connected to the coil.  Oscillations in the current in the electromagnet cause alternating magnetic fields which attract or repel the permanent magnet and cause the coil and the attached diaphragm to vibrate and produce sound.  Put simply, as long as you were clever about it, you could actually use these external facing magnets as your speaker permanent magnets with a few stipulations.   Because the polarity of the magnet would be opposite in each ear (because North attracts South), you'd need to make sure that the coils are also wound opposite directions.  This might have cost implications as you'd likely need a custom wound coil, and keeping them from being installed in the wrong ear could increase manufacturing cost. Given that most speakers use a magnetic toroid which doesn't really lend itself to your design, you'd probably end up using two separate magnets in each ear, but it's still a good idea to align their polarities so you don't diminish the power of one speaker over the other or cause the magnets to ""fight"" which can actually demagnetize them over time. You'd want to be careful that the external facing magnets don't demagnetize.  Over time, bashing magnets together can cause them to lose their magic.  If these magnets are exposed and not padded, they can wear out over time.  If their magnetic field is being used for audio, the speakers may get quieter over time. The only way I can see the magnets affecting music in this configuration is if you're trying to play music while the headphones are collapsed.  If anything, I believe this would make the music somewhat louder because the magnetic fields that would normally fringe out under the coil would be better focused through the coil.   As much as I love to shit all over designs that disregard the laws of physics, I think this is a really clever design, and I wish OP the best of luck."

The hanging metal tabs when the 'phones are collapsed still occupy space, see pink area in this pic - ultimately I think these would take up a little more pocket space vs traditional collapsible cans.  It would be great if those metal rails could slide up or fold in."

Design,3d92v2,tbeech20,4,Tue Jul 14 23:04:52 2015 UTC,They also seem like the best way to break/ fuck up your headphones having something stick out like that.
Design,3d92v2,chewp911,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. About the claim of 8% vs 14% it was the result when using inner unused area as the metric. As for the parts sticking up it is true that they make the product a bit more cumbersome but here are a couple of points on that matter:  *The pink space in the picture you made would most likely be filled by something if thrown into a bag.  *The metal parts sticking out are over-engineered which make them very durable and hard to bend by mistake.  *They are easier to fold than the akg headphones as the folding is done in one fluid motion that ends with the magnets snapping into place.   Some have posted pictures of highly foldable headphones (like this http://www.headphonereviews.org/headphone/Sony/MDR-D66SL) BUT consider that they are all larger cup types. This means that the cups themselves are so big that they will fill up the space in the middle if they are folded. My design is made for on-ear style headphones which have smaller cups and can't be folded in the same way because of that.   I would of course have loved to find a way to make the parts sticking out disappear, but every solution I tried made the folding process harder and the over all design cluttered. I believe in simple design so I chose to leave them there and make sure that they would not break.  I should mention also that the headphones are made to be very durable by using high safety factors and fairly extreme load-cases (25 newton load in opened state in x,y z, SF=3.9)."

The earpieces can face out as in the armadillo or more sensibly inwards as in the photo (and which actually saves a little more space.)

Design,3d92v2,ItsSeanP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:02:33 2015 UTC,Ok so to adress some points that have come up. Like ch00f said it would be possible to have the magnets there given some thought.   Like you say there are many solutions out there already but an advantage to this is that it would be easier to fold as it is all done in one motion. Also if you just put them in the bag without folding at all there is less risk that they'll break as the headstrap is bendable.
Design,3d92v2,djdistro,5,Tue Jul 14 17:05:35 2015 UTC,What about the metal sticking out though? Seems like the greatest weakness of the whole thing. They make the footprint MUCH larger than you claim and give them two points of high stress when put in a backpack or something.

Thank you for your time!"
Design,3d9m4b,qwertyman159,2,Tue Jul 14 16:18:57 2015 UTC,"This is my first time critiquing any design ever, I'm pretty new to this. So take it with a grain of salt.   The search bar should definitely be a card shape or a underline text input, if the goal is to fit into material design, which I think it is. If you're not going for material, it's nice the way it is. Also, if you are aiming for material, it doesn't look right hanging halfway off of the top background card.   Also, material tends to use brighter colors. That top background should be maybe a Google Material Blue with Material Pink action buttons and white text.   It looks really nice stand-alone, but if it's to be based on material design, there are a couple parts that should be matched more closely to the standard."
Design,3d9m4b,brandonroc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:33 2015 UTC,Hi /u/qwertyman159! Thank you for the feedback. Looking at the design I actually really agree with your points.  Looking at the search bar I'm really wondering why I made it rounded like that and not as a card as you suggested. I was looking at it and wondering why it looked funny. That's why.   And for the color choices I really like the idea of using the material design blue with the material design pink. It would really make it pop and give it that material design feel.  Thank you so much for the suggestions and I'll be updating it sometime tonight and I'll link to you what it looks like using your suggestions.  Thank you!

Design,3d8xma,MooseHead88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"To publish your app to Apple, resources are needed in at least two dimensions: @1x and @2x. Ideal even have a size of @3x. And do not always have at hand all the necessary amount of resources when you designs a prototype or final application. Perhaps the designer is not available, to ask him to make the desired image size. In this case we have created Resizely. This service will help to get the necessary size of the graphics to develop for iOS or the Mac: @1x, @2x, @3x.  To all the images after resizing looked great, the original image size should be the size @3x. But if you designs a prototype, believe me, using @1x schedule as a starting point, the device will look satisfactory.  In addition to resize functions, the service will help you optimize the size of any PNG file. Image Optimization can reach 90% without any loss in image quality!  Compression of graphics is more as a complement than the main function of the service. Compress files makes sense when it is downloaded via the internet. By doing this you can save up to 50% of the traffic. If all graphics are stored in the phone, this way, you can save only on the size of the build of the application."

I thoroughly enjoy my job. There are days that suck (working til 11:30pm to meet a brochure deadline was a low point) but overall the job is great.  My favourite part of the job is seeing something yo udesigned as a physical object, and having ownership of it. I have had ads I've designed run in the national press, which is a great kick. I've designed a bunch of brochures for part of my company, and recently (like last week everything was approved) redesigned one of the company templates for catalogues.  Graphic Design in the real world is varied, and so long as you find a company at the end where you can build a good rapport with people, you will have a really fulfilling job."

Design gives you the perfect opportunity to become interested in everything around you. Your every day experiences become part of your influences, and inform your work. Working as a designer for a while will in turn change the way you see the world.  With training, you can earn a decent living creating things – often without the struggles of an artist. Lots of people wish their jobs were ‘more creative’, so I consider it a privilege.  If you are someone who has natural flair in art or drawing, but struggles with ‘the blank canvas’, design can be liberating. As a communicator/problem-solver you will always have a brief to answer and constraints to work within. A flash of the ‘eureka!’ moment itself is a great feeling.  If you like the sound of the above, I say go for it. Working as a designer is tremendous fun as long as you don’t take yourself or your work too seriously.  You say you love it after all, and what more can one ask for in their job?  Good luck"
Design,3d0q2n,linesmokers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:52:32 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Firstly, your post isn't useless at all, it is a good question to ask! I'll start off by saying I do not have a degree in anything fine arts, and I suck at drawing. I studied biology and spanish (got degrees in both), then realized my hobby, my passion, could also become something that makes me money. I'm the sort of designer that people like to put in quotes (she's a ""designer"")- but that also gives me a unique perspective. Graphic design as a professional is about your attitude. As I'm sure you're aware (if you've spent any time on this subreddit), we're a group that is often filled with negativity. In a world where some argue art vs. making money- there IS a place to do both. It is also about not allowing yourself to be the type of designer that gets walked all over and feels bad for themselves 90% of the day. It is only a love/hate relationship if you let it be. Like so much else in life, you are what you allow yourself to be.  What I love about being a graphic designer is that I get to help people's companies become something so much MORE because of something beautiful and meaningful I've designed. I LOVE seeing these companies splatter MY art all over themselves and then make money because of it. IT. IS. AWESOME. That being said- you'll hear about ""clients from hell"" that thoroughly abuse artists. The trick is not letting those people ever become your client.   Like any other career, there are unique hurtles to get over (like the perception that you shouldn't be paid to design). I would talk to a guidance counselor (or a few of them) as well as prospective professors at the schools you'd like to attend. If you're passionate and have the right attitude... and AREN'T AFRAID TO WORK YOUR ASS OFF... then yes, you can most certainly do design as a profession. But if you're afraid to step above the whinging masses and be more than a starving artist, then I'd choose something else.  This is a profession for people who are confident, so take a look at yourself and decide if that's who you are :)"

But, as with every design trend, you can still ween out the terrible from the great - Last.fm is a great example of terrible (i was really surprised how BAD it looks!).

You can have a bad name and make something out of it regardless, but you need some identity, some heritage, whether real or manufactured, some personality. Apple I agree doesn't have a name, but they have built a brand. Pearl has no brand, and they aren't leveraging their name either.   Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Dell, HP for example, you're right, none of them have compelling names, but most of them have built compelling brands. So I'm not arguing you have to leverage your name.

By combining the name with an old-fashioned typeface and a bland label design, the brand unintentionally echoes the tired associations of unthreatening, feminine, cleanliness that has long been used by soap and tampon companies.

I cant get over that preconceived image of anything using the name pearl any more.   My first thought on seeing the old design was whats all the crappy writing doing on the front making it look all crowded. I was happy to see they got rid of all that junk. I like the new labels, but the name pearl sucks."

Design,3cvdsi,highpoweredboy,8,Sat Jul 11 09:32:16 2015 UTC,Extremely boring.  This could be more elegant and have a brand identity to match the name? It is called pearl after all but this just looks like just another label without much thought about it. i would have a solid colour bottle and see through logo/branding or clear bottle and do a cooler label and change colours to match the flavour (inverted idea for solid colour bottle) ie http://media.creativebloq.futurecdn.net/sites/creativebloq.com/files/images/2014/04/helvetica-wine.jpg is a very rough quick example i found to give some sort of idea of the layout (not the style) that would work well.  The original brand doesn't seem very strong and they are trying to build on that which i think is the core problem. Needs a rebrand first and not just a new label.

The label's composition wasn't well thought out, the curvature of the bottles wasn't considered. And it's too high up on the bottle, the negative space with the neck's label makes the whole thing look top heavy, unbalanced really. It doesn't even come off as a mixer. It looks more like alcopop, like Zima almost. A Canadian must have designed this, that's the only possible explanation."

Look up videos on ""Bitmap Mode"" in Photoshop, like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n3vuD6I9CI    The general idea is to take your image in photoshop, go to image>mode>grayscale.   Then, try to up the contrast of the image however you want to do it (via brightness and contrast, or levels, or curves, it doesn't matter). You basically want a lot of difference and harsher transitions between your light and dark areas.  Once you've done this, go to image>mode>bitmap, and you want to select ""halftone screen"" in the drop down menu. Click okay, now you have some options, but the one that comes closest to money portraits is ""Shape: lines"" at angle ""0"", starting around lines/inch: ""12"". Play with these settings.   Once you got something that looks closest to the look you're trying to achieve, go to image>mode>grayscale. and then finally back to image>mode>rgb.  Hope that helps!"

Since cans are extruded instead of blow molded, in-mould printing is not an option which means its almost certainly screen printed which, again, means that yes, fewer colors is better but this has the same number of colors, and additionally, that the shape for the screen can be as simple or complex as you like, once it's made, it's made.

I was going to Savannah College of Art and Design at the Atlanta campus, and Coke actually came to our class to give us a ""mock project"" for them. The idea was this: We are going to be launching our contour bottles, in aluminum, and we'd like you to create a marketing campaign on which to launch these bottles.  They had already been releasing them in super tiny runs with a project called the M5. Five continents, five design teams, five unique bottles, branding, graphics everything.   Our project was to design what it would look like to release the bottles on a world wide scale.  Because Coca-cola was putting their product back into a contour bottle, we figured that they had the advantage of standing out on the shelf by shape alone, thus they had no need for fancy graphics and bright colors.   Our designs was a blank aluminum bottle, with colored ribbon for each type of coke: Red = Classic, White = Diet, Purple = Cherry, Black = Zero, Brown = Vanilla, etc.  We thought that maybe coke could engrave other information into the bottles if they needed to, like calorie information, or the logo itself. But the campaign would be based on simplicity, being naked, stripping off the decorations and getting back to fundamentals. If we would have known about ""mexican coke"" back then, we likely would have included that too.  Sadly, a dispute about who would own the ideas after they were presented (the students, the school, or coke) led us to not ever be able to present the campaign idea to coke at the end of the semester, and now I'm writing about it on the internet. Life.  EDIT: M5 presentation."

SCAD was fighting to be allowed to use the design work to promote the school. Coke was fighting to make sure that any ideas that they might use from us would be completely owned by them, but didn't want to commit to a blank check before we even presented our idea. And we were just students, stuck in the middle, thinking that we had actually come up with a cool idea.  I didn't even want money or anything, I just wanted to show Coke this project we made that we were really proud of. Getting to present your idea directly to a company like that isn't an opportunity that many people get."

Design,3croj5,Thepoopsniff,12,Fri Jul 10 05:54:07 2015 UTC,"about 2 years now.    Give it time Keep looking at good design. Study typography and appreciate subtlety. Don't change font size mid phrase. Don't throw so many effects at a single thing. Ask, ""does this make sense?"" when designing. Things that are flashy like filters or effects are easy because they suck, they aren't designed so much as applied. Try to make everything by hand. When shapes are organic, or handmade, make them, don't use the same shape over again.   Edit: I can give you a quick run down of the number one thing I like and dislike about each piece.  Read The Trieb: I hate the type, bad spacing, bad color changes, bad centering on the skirt mark. I like the... I'm not trying to be harsh dude, but the rest of your stuff is better than this. It looks like your pen tool work is solid enough though.  Japan face thing: I don't like the bevel/shadow thing. I love the nice white type on the yellow background. Looks like candy.  Sakura: I hate the minimal art style (personal taste). I love Street Fighter and your excellent pen tool technique. It needs more refinement, but it's getting better. Keep after that.  HCWA: I want to say the font choice and spacing, but that gradient line is the worst. If you centered everything on this logo it would probably work better. I like the Supporting Success font size in relation to the rest.  Beard Glasses: I hate the fake metal sign. I love beards though. Good job illustrating those glasses, they're not my style but you did a good job nonetheless.  Eve Online: I hate the cracked paint effect. I love the retro travel stamp idea. Execution is pretty good if it weren't so distressed.  Dodd's Wine Vault: I hate the repeating brush stroke. I like the color choice. Drop that stroke business, throw it on a grey or slightly colored background, fix your kerning, and you'd be there.  I wasn't any better than you at two years in. It takes time. The initial excitement of learning how to do vector stuff will subside and you will start designing like you want. I'd say you're on track though."

Design,3croj5,ebenhaim,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:01:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed with the feed back here.  Also, try subtracting from your designs. This isn't limited to removing elements; think about using fewer curves and points to create shapes.  Consistency. Do your curves for a certain design have the same angle? Should they? Maybe not, but don't be inconsistent with shapes, angles, etc. because of laziness.  Margins. Give elements breathing room. Eve online is too tight with the height of the ribbon. The slogan is too close to the ribbon and the dashed stroke. There are other elements in there that are too -try finding them.  Try reading about element presentation and their meanings. For example, the skirt in your first logo is balanced on its corner. It gives the feeling of instability and maybe risk. Is there a reason for that? I don't know, but you should think about these things when you design.  Don't submit/present a finalized design without giving a day of rest. It's amazing how many improvements you make the following day after giving it a break (if you have the time, of course).  Like shitfy_pete mentioned, it takes time. I wasn't much better at 2 years. Some people learn faster than others, but at the end of the day, we learn from exploring new territories, our failures, and looking back at our mistakes. The key is to keep designing and trying new styles."

Design,3co97t,jonfla,4,Thu Jul 9 13:19:32 2015 UTC,"I think this is exactly backwards.  The whole point of IoT is that the things will become the interface for themselves or for each other.  Humans love switches, knobs, latches, and other devices that give us tactile feedback.  Gestures take this away.  We've been able to build touch panels for appliances for decades, but the high end appliances have knobs and switches -- because those are much more satisfying.  We're working very hard to add tactile feedback to touch screens, because we value feeling like we interact with physical things.  If anything, IoT will lead to a proliferation of tactile interfaces that work with each other.  And when we need a high bandwidth interface for very specific or very general input, it's going to be pretty tough for gestures to improve on screen + keyboard + pointing device."
Design,3co97t,bonafidebob,2,Thu Jul 9 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"As much as I agree with tactility being an important (and largely ignored) facet of interaction design, I can only see buttons and knobs losing ground to gestures in the near future. They add mechanical complexity, adding weight and size to our devices. Since consumers are demanding technology that is slimmer, lighter, and more ""invisible"", there is a stronger incentive for designers to reduce by replacing these parts with space-saving and more ""intuitive"" controls."
Design,3co97t,TypographySnob,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"For a mobile all-purpose device, I completely agree.  But IoT is about a lot more than smartphone replacements.  It's hard to beat a knob or slider for intuitiveness.  Look at high end mixing equipment for example.  If gestures were inherently better we'd have switched over to them already.  Another example, XBox has had gestures for a while, via kinect.  How many people actually use it, vs hands-on remotes.  The tactile feedback you get with a good joystick or driving wheel is valued."

Design,3cklqc,TheRealBigLou,5,Wed Jul 8 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking as an Industrial Designer who works on products in this market:  I don't like it. To me it's too playful, too tightly spaced, and too wide stroked. I understand that is their complete reason in rebranding to be more playful, but they alienated a lot of their own product.  The MX and high end mouse line are some of the highest end and best reviewed mouses. This new logo feels like they're going to start making plastic China knockoffs and would have no place on Logitech's high end product lines. It feels like a cheapening of their brand."
Design,3cklqc,ItsSeanP,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:24:39 2015 UTC,"I understand what your getting at but Logitech seems to be taking a different approach. Based on what I have seen of their advertising they do not focus a lot on the MX series.   A lot of the new things they are creating seems to be bright and colorful, aside from the new MX mice of course. You can even see what I am talking about in their new brand video. I even own one of their newer colorful products and it feels nothing like a China knockoff. The quality is still there just behind a different branding.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=19&v=7CO6PJ6IWFI  It looks like they are taking their brand in a different direction."
Design,3cklqc,thisdesignup,2,Thu Jul 9 08:37:34 2015 UTC,"Completely, and I think a majority of it is also just me being stubborn.   The part that is hard for me to swallow is it feels like a company reinventing themselves like they do when sales have plummeted and it's a last ditch effort, trying too hard to be on trend with what is currently trendy. The bright colors and blocked logo seem like an imitation even though they are not.  Easiest thing to do is wait and see! I really hope they surprise me with it and take the brand in an exciting new direction because I have always loved their products."
Design,3cklqc,ItsSeanP,4,Thu Jul 9 08:50:22 2015 UTC,"I really like this new logo.. It was pretty thoughtfully put together in my opinion. While going with a smoother g would have made the subtle webcam look MORE webcammy... it wouldn't look like a G anymore. I say props to them, I like it."
Design,3cklqc,ChanguitaShadow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"This to me is a very crappy design. Is it abstract? Minimalist? Is it supposed to be animated and the sideways q turns into the g?  I can get the idea,  but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired."
Design,3cklqc,NateThomas1979,7,Wed Jul 8 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"I actually love the new logo. The old one was severely dated and didn't lend itself to a ""cutting edge"" technology company.  This new logo is recognizable even though it's so simple and minimalist. It's modern which helps it sell the ""cutting edge"". And the cut away of the G's descender gives is a friendly smile which helps relate it to the average consumer.  I think it's very successful."
Design,3cklqc,NateThomas1979,2,Wed Jul 8 17:29:42 2015 UTC,I guess we all have our likes and dislikes lol. Thanks for describing why you like it. It's interesting how different people can look at the same artwork.

You posted this yesterday, and you got a bunch of feedback. Some of it was crappy, and some of it was well intentioned, but you sifted through the things that people said to you and you clearly weighed what you were told versus your vision and you implemented some changes.  I'm really impressed with how you took critiques to heart and managed to come up with changes in that way.  Just the act of listening to feedback no matter how it was presented is an important one for graphic designers to really get. Good job."

Design,3cfse8,midas22,21,Tue Jul 7 19:46:46 2015 UTC,"I was one of them offering feedback yesterday and I'm glad that you removed the left column, it's definitely much better now. If only you would reduce the padding on the left and right of the screen and make the content fluid now it would look pretty good on the whole. I would definitely give it a shot over the current design anyway if it was available.  It's funny with whitespace, I don't think a content packed website can afford to have as much as maybe would be visually optimal. I don't mind centered content in general but it just doesn't work for reddit."
Design,3cfse8,sageDieu,4,Tue Jul 7 22:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yep I'm thinking the same thing - it looks really great and I would love to use such a well designed interface, but reddit just has so much density sometimes that we can't afford so much white space."

Design,3cfse8,iamthedestroyer,105,Tue Jul 7 22:22:52 2015 UTC,I love seeing things like this!  The only thing that stands out to me is that vote buttons are placed horizontally next to each other when one is up and the other is down. Kind of have to make that small mental translation by looking at the icon to figure out which button does what. It's almost nothing but when you look at it from afar it's a bit difficult to know what functions they serve.  Really nice work!
Design,3cfse8,Naomarik,21,Tue Jul 7 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that as well but i did it this way, because it saves much place when having the images in open state"

Design,3cfse8,--Petrichor--,2,Tue Jul 7 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"I also agree with the up down vertical placement as well as consistency across the site. Voting is one of the primary interactions users have with the site, and should probably be the main call to action (besides clicking link)."

Design,3cfse8,randonymous,2,Tue Jul 7 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"And given that is the second or third most important user interaction (behind the link itself and possibly the comments) for each post, can't be that minor."
Design,3cfse8,sandollars,2,Wed Jul 8 15:50:40 2015 UTC,Could be resolved by indenting the link title just a few pixels and having it float left of the full text height. There's something far more intuitive about placing up above down.

Design,3cfse8,FaceofHoe,36,Tue Jul 7 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yep.  When I open my front page I see 18 different titles - distinct from every object around them.  It's easy to read them and figure out which i want to engage with, and which I do not.  With the new redesign, I get 7, or even 2 articles per page view.  And the titles are distracted from making it difficult to peruse.  Tone everything down.  Look at the real front page again and notice that the only text that isn't faded at all are the titles (and the reddit masthead).  Everything else has some loss of saturation (and the titles do not).  Also, pictures.  Most of my favorite stories don't have good pictures associated with them.  The idea that every story has a fancy thumbnail kills sites that don't have dedicated graphics artists working for them.  It always looks stock, looks wrong, or looks distracting.  Most designs and mock-ups love to add in beautiful photos, but real life just doesn't have access to beautiful photos."
Design,3cfse8,drunkitect,10,Tue Jul 7 18:01:58 2015 UTC,Re: your last paragraph.     I see this a lot in concept design. Especially in redesigns of social media sites.  Even the highest paid design professionals make this mistake... see the failure that was(is?) Facebook Paper. It probably looked awesome as a concept where every avatar was a pretty face and people only posted amazing photos... in real life though...
Design,3cfse8,KMKtwo-four,2,Tue Jul 7 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"From what I saw, Facebook Paper was much more of a proof of concept of interaction design rather than a full-on app - it let them test a ton of ideas, then incorporate the ones that worked into the main Facebook app experience. From that point of view, it definitely worked."

How many new users are dettered by reddit's current UI?  How many interesting articles do you miss when cognitive load is that high? Space just means more scrolling, which is not an issue because this isn't 1998.  Case in point: I and anyone reading this scrolled to reach this comment thread."

First thing I'd focus on would be the info density. The spacing is nice to the eye but comes at quite a cost of density. A more ""reddit"" idea would be not to have the separate boxes per content item and separate them by a line or just spacing. You can probably get away with half the space between elements without the box spacing and borders."

Design,3cfse8,geoman2k,2,Tue Jul 7 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I can't stand the lines that go on forever. Use some formatting and keep it centered. I use a Stylish style just to get a dark theme and cause it centers everything."
Design,3cfse8,geoman2k,4,Tue Jul 7 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the centering is the most immediately irking thing to me.  I utilize my workspace and displays in ways that don't really accommodate having empty space on a page. I much prefer reddit's current, base design. I don't use subreddit styles, and I keep night mode on. I can comfortably utilize under two thirds of my 1440p display for the browser window without feeling cramped, and that leaves the other third+ enough room to have almost any other type of application, be it productivity or otherwise.  Without using subreddit styles, every part of the site is ensured to be limited to two columns, with the column that takes up 95% of my attention on the site, also taking up about 75 to 90% of the browser window, depending on however wide I have it set, or if it's occupying the entirety of my other, lower resolution monitor."

Design,3cfse8,PeteMullersKeyboard,2,Tue Jul 7 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"There are some pretty good things going on here, and overall you have a good eye for visual design. Couple thoughts:   You need to think about user subreddit customization. Mods are going to customize these subreddits, and in the current format they're going to look like shit really quickly. The floating boxes look good on top of a low contrast & minimal background, but high contrast & dark background are going to get busy and distracting quickly. I would suggest getting rid of the gaps between posts so the background can't peak through and get in the way of the text. Likewise, the text at the top of the posts (new, rising, controversial, etc) relies on contrast between the text and the background. That's pretty dangerous considering mods can put whatever background image they want in there. if they pick something busy it will make that text unreadable. It seems like every time someone does a redesign like this they insist on putting a max width on the page. Why? Reddit is all about content, so you might as well make use of the user's entire screen to provide them with as much content as they want to see."
Design,3cfse8,Etab,2,Tue Jul 7 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"thanks! about the dark design: There's one of those as well here, and i think it works decently, however, about the text at the top could be a problem, i know it sounds a bit designnazi like but maybe, just maybe i'd either make a designer's job to make (or at least fix) the subreddits' background, or at least to validate them if they are good to use.  About the max width - i thought of it as being expandable too, if i made it to other screen resolutions, you'd see that.:)"
Design,3cfse8,infiniteloooop,2,Tue Jul 7 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"just maybe i'd either make a designer's job to make (or at least fix) the subreddits' background   I like you're enthusiasm and your dark design does look a little better than I was expecting (I did see it posting my comment). That said, I think you're being far to optimistic about how subreddits would be treated & customized after this redesign. Most people aren't designers, but a lot of people think they can do design and will try to make things look good but end up making them look really, really bad.  Reddit already has a pretty bad problem with this, luckily though you can disable subreddit styles manually (though who knows how many people actually use that feature).  Some examples of subreddits with heavy customizations (which, in my opinion, hurt the subs more than help):  http://www.reddit.com/r/movies  http://www.reddit.com/r/books  http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/  http://www.reddit.com/r/horror/  http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats  To me, this means you really have two options:   Severely limit Reddit's customizability features. Get rid of the ability to use custom CSS entirely, and just provide a few theme options and a place to upload an image - similar to twitter or something. This isn't a great solution, and it would take away a lot of the fun of subreddit moderation for some people. Some people like crappy design and want to do it intentionally on their subreddits. Strip down your design to it's bare bones, and focus on making the site as usable and readable as possible, without any emphasis on making it visually attractive. If you have a core design and user experience that is good enough, it will probably still be very functional even after people start bastardizing it with their own CSS. You can still provide a pretty ""default theme"" similar to the ones that are available with reddit gold, but you need to make it optional and you need to make the site work without it.   Just my thoughts on it. Remember that reddit is best when it's merely a platform for user expression and discussion. Focus your design around making that expression as easy as possible, and make do with the stuff the community does to it to make it their own."
Design,3cfse8,Exozia,3,Tue Jul 7 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"Agree with all your points. The problem with trying to redesign reddit is that it's already highly usable and readable and on top of that users have had over 6 years to engrain that design into their heads, so even if you did improve it you'd have to get around a lot of inertia in the user base. The majority here (as in reddit as a whole) don't want or care about having a pretty design, they just want an efficient layout with the right tools in the right place that lets them do what they come here for - consume information and post the occasional comment.  I've tried to do a bit of sub customisation since I joined and the best I feel I've done (and the one with the best user response) is the one that's closest to the default design."

Design,3cfse8,iamthedestroyer,2,Tue Jul 7 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"One part of reddit's current design that I adore is its content density. Individual pieces of content aren't given more space than they deserve. In your design, there's too much vertical space and underutilization of horizontal space (centering instead of fluid design is bad for content-heavy sites). I can see 19 submissions at a time on reddit, but only 8 in your design. Because I like being able to look through submission titles quickly to find content that I'd find particularly interesting, this is IMHO a fatal flaw in your design. Comments also have too much vertical padding.  The text colors and sizes in submissions are less distinct than they currently are, which is somewhat problematic because it makes it more difficult to immediately get the title of a submission if you're quickly looking through a lot of submissions (e.g. browsing the frontpage).  The horizontal placement of the upvote/downvote arrows on submissions isn't ideal because the upvote/downvote terminology might as well be replaced with leftvote/rightvote, though given the vertical placement of comment upvote/downvote arrows, that would create a (questionably convenient) distinction between voting on links and voting on comments.  But the design as a whole is quite nice. Reddit's design is essentially a fossil from 2008 and looks quite dated now, so a redesign would be appreciated.  PS: You forgot to change the titles in the /r/aww mockup. That's a dog, not an iceberg."
Design,3cfse8,HAT_MADE_OF_FROGS,2,Tue Jul 7 19:58:27 2015 UTC,Yeah...this would never work...it's way too attractive and intuitive to be implemented by the current leadership.
Design,3cfse8,jotam44,2,Tue Jul 7 21:17:03 2015 UTC,"what is the goal of your redesign? what are the problems you set out to solve and how did you solve them? how does someone interact with the page? how does someone interact with the page on a different non (presumably)-PC? how can you show these screens without so much text and the same number of steps as there are currently?  to me, this is not a redesign. it's more of a skinning of the current site. all of the interactions appear to be more or less identical. the site would work exactly the same way and people would interact with it the exact same way. i'm not saying that's a bad thing -- maybe you give it a go with a subreddit css -- but i think it is miscategorized as a redesign.  what led to your decision to move the voting buttons to the horizontal orientation? do you think some of the ""up"" and ""down"" terminology loses its meaning by stacking them side to side? and why is raising the vote shown before lowering the vote (thinking lower numbers precede higher numbers when reading left to right)?"
Design,3cfse8,jotam44,2,Tue Jul 7 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"I love the cleanliness of the aesthetic, and it makes me want to get out of hiding in nightmode!

Just my observation!"

Its very soft, very low contrast, with the greys and blue backgrounds.  When I visit Reddit, I speed browse a lot and consume large amounts of content. I select content I'm viewing fast and open several windows, though even if I went one by one, this wouldn't last long in this sort of low contrast setting.   While pleasing for a temporary view, you're not imposing any rhythm I can follow, nor making it easy for me go through large amounts of content.  Have you given thought on this yet?"

As a freelancer, I make it very clear up front what the expectations are regarding design from both my clients and myself.  You have no opportunity to set such expectations at a print shop.  Your job is just to ring them up and get them out of the store.  What you want to do is akin to stopping an overweight person from purchasing another box of mac and cheese at a grocery store.

Interestingly enough, 9gag took 3.4 seconds to load 2.7MB, while reddit took 3.6 seconds to load the 370kb. Reddit took longer to load just .13 of 9gag's content.  That said, your concept is very sexy. The major issue I have is viewable content. The biggest issue the users hammered us on about the /r/nfl redesign was the space between posts.

It starts with the ""CREATE YOUR OWN SUBRED"" button right over my own Dashboard, which is probably clicked 10000 times more often than a subred-creation.   The content is way too far from actual reddit content - just imagine 10 times folded discussions in a thread with 1000+ comments. How would your, very narrowly set, space handle it? The overall site concept is: Content is king, the less stuff around, the better. You just turned it around, which isn't very smart.  Not a big fan of the fontface and its super-high line-heights, either.  Keep it up, but there are definetly way more conceptual thoughts needed if you want to make it better and not just different and more colorful (because that's something nobody needs)."

This concept will not work on subreddits meant for you to reconsider clicking on the link (see /r/fiftyfifty), or on subreddits that may show up on my front page but I do not want to see while at work (for instance, if I'm subscribed to /r/WTF).  How would your concept hold with the option to view/not view posts? Would there be an open/close button for the user to activate? A global setting that basically says ""deal with it"" as it would be all or nothing?  Also, how is one supposed to get back to the subreddit's main page after diving into a comment section for a specific post? One of the current issues I find with Reddit is that there really isn't a ""go back"" other than clicking on the sub-head link, or my browser's back button. That would be a fun problem to solve with this redesign. Playing around with motion/animation to see where to comment section is coming from. Also - in a comment section, I would prefer more room for discussion versus the sidebars. The sidebars on either end during a comment section feels...restricted. See if you could apply your airy feeling to the comment section as well to see if this would be a viable option.  Otherwise, I like where this is going, letting the subreddit have a more polished look to their customized background. Speaking of, would there also be an option for more customization in the future for each subreddit? Right now each one has different themes, and some people are really into personalizing their section of Reddit - maybe this should be explored as well?"

Design,3cb8tr,hepcecob,2,Tue Jul 7 11:07:08 2015 UTC,"So apparently this subreddit is a poop-slinging fest where users compete in giving unconstructive knee-jerk negativity. I'm very disappointed in the comments here.  I think your redesign is very easy on the eye. It feels relieving and simple to use since it has a lot of breathing room with margins and padding, where reddit's current design feels cramped together. It has good contrast between different elements, making them stand out individually. It is consistent, whereas reddit can't currently decide on color shades, border colors, shading or flat design etc.  With that said, I see two problem areas in the redesign.  Law of proximity  Objects that are close together are perceived as belonging together by the human brain. This leads to several problems in the redesign.   The Notifications button and the Settings button should not belong together. The Search bar and the User bar should not belong together. The Submit button and the User bar should not belong together. Also, submit what? The post voting buttons and the post score don't really seem to belong together. The line height is so high that the individual lines look independent from each other, like separate paragraphs or double line breaks.   reddit redesign?  It must be established whether the redesign is a concept for a future reddit or for another reddit-like website.   The post presentation presupposes that reddit is a picture sharing service. News links would absolutely drown. The reddit color scheme is an integral part of the reddit identity, and I can't imagine anything good coming out of changing it. It's a website where the word ""orangered"" means ""comment reply"" and where many hundreds of popular orange and blue upvote/downvote gifs have been made. Keep baby blue for the frontpage background and orange/blue for the upvotes, and orange as the universal accent color.   Just my 2¢. Best of luck!"

For the second row, the icon between the plane and the house, are those supposed to be tickets or band-aids? The color kind of reminds me of a band-aid.

You think maybe going with a more saturated palette will make it look more grown up? Or maybe more muted? We're an employee discounts startup, generally we want to look fun and playful but still grown up and professional.   You're right, they're supposed to be tickets but I can definitely see band aids how that I'm looking at it. Maybe I'll change them to red or green.  Keeping the icons simple is a real challenge for me. My brain always seems to go towards more complex. I was hoping to come out with something similar to AirBnB's awesome icon set, but looking at it again now I can tell that mine a a great deal more complex. I'll have to work on it."

I never had to clean out all the little cracks in the keys, and sure it started delaminating after a while, but it didn't get super bad until one of the little buggers decided to pull on it.  Mostly I use it as a screen protector anyway... So it worked great as an auxiliary to the on screen keyboard."

Design,3c4clm,TimothyGonzalez,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:42:46 2015 UTC,"The spiral itself is meaningless, I agree. It's a bit silly that they drew it in. But the rectangle has meaning. They took a golden rectangle with a length the same as the green rectangle, rotated it 45 degrees, and extended the line to guide the midpoint of the ""bite"" circle.  Is it necessary? Almost certainly not. But just because something is unnecessary doesn't mean it's done without intent.  The more important thing here is: that logo isn't the Apple logo. The real Apple logo doesn't fit those ratios at all, so it was either done as an exercise in geometric design, or, as you said, satire of the way people fawn over this stuff."

I think simplistic design, at least in my experience, is a lot more difficult to execute effectively than ""just make it look cool"".  For example, unless you're talking to someone who really knows design, they might not appreciate that simplicity is one of the reasons the current Apple icon works so well. Make it black and white, make it all kinds of different colors. Make a tiny nail decal or a flag with it. It works in every size, resolution, etc etc.. And that's actually a challenge when trying to make great simplistic design."

Design,3c4clm,FMScanRadio,2,Sat Jul 4 22:46:30 2015 UTC,Good way to look at it. You get especially bad code when you pass project or people inherent projects. If someone wrote somewhat sloppy code and someone else needs quick changes to it you might have to write sloppy code to get it done quick. You can only hope you comment it well enough or get the opportunity to come back to it later.  I feel like a lot of people look for real cutting edge designs a lot. Guess what I'm making a website for a law firm. It can't have the most cutting edge features and they might have an ugly color scheme they insist on using. Can you just tell me if it looks good for what it is and what can be improved within reason? Is another issue that I think is encountered a lot.

Design,3c4clm,tlexa,2,Tue Jul 7 00:37:06 2015 UTC,"This is a chicken and egg kind of deal.   Explaining design to lay people is one of the reasons these lines popped up (specifically in graphic & web design). Questions like ""why is x more pleasing than y"" or ""why did you put that there"". It's there because of harmony, and harmony often follows rules like the golden ratio, fibonacci or an internal standard of layout continuity.  So we can say ""it looks good because it fits within a consistent system"". And the person asking the question sees this (by seeing all the lines) and will be far more satisfied than if the designer responded with ""My experience-refined intuition guided me to place it just so"". Which may come off as ""I made it up"" - no one likes hearing that, especially after paying money for design.   Whether the likers on dribble understand this or just think the lines are pretty is beyond me. They're a communication tool, and can be used well or gratuitously (evil). Designers may be showing them on their dribble mockups to show their adherence to a system, other designers may be copycatting. But without a system (or a purpose to communicate), the lines can end up looking like bit of a mess.   tl;dr The lines are there to explain why something looks good, they are (usually) not used in the design process (e.g. drawing over a golden ratio from scratch). There are legitimate reasons to show them, and there are copy cats on dribble.  N.B. I've said usually a lot as there are cases where you do plop a grid down and work over the top, but that's a bit different to keeping the lines and showing them to an audience (on dribble) as part of a final concept."

Since you drew the seat, why not also draw the silhouette of the parts of the steering wheel and dashboard and other things that can be seen. Front overhang is way too short, (compare: blueprint).

When they hire you for work, they buy it and can use it as theirs,  and therefore you don't own your own work. The most usual way of promoting your company trough the products you sell, is a footnote at the product.  as, company name, date, for costumers name. By doing it like that, anybody who sees the results can see who made it, as well as the original owner /buyer will have its company name in the same text. Win-win."

Design,3c4lcd,vbl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"Hi- I work a lot with television and 10-foot UI/UX design and crossovers into mobile platforms. Could you clarify your question a bit? Not quite sure what you mean by ""quickly simulating video across various qualities""?  Sounds like you're working on a streaming/vid app for mobile devices... If you're looking to create static proofs, just create all the various elements at their largest required size (important), in this case 1080 (though, remember a new, larger-higher-res screen will become the standard soon so maybe aim bigger ~4kish).   Then, create blank documents at smaller sizes- drag and drop layers in, resize, adjust elements. For rough mocks you can always size down quickly. Work with icon sets in a vector program like AI in case you need to pull in fresh elements or resize parts of elements to show up properly at smaller resolutions.   For sharing specs between teams, be sure to adjust your document's resolution (standard desktop is 72ppi, print is 300, iphone is... 440? blah blah blah...) This will automatically readjust the font sizing proportionally when you drop it between projects. This whole process might take a couple minutes to knock out some rough comps.   If you need something more interactive, you can always code it up in CSS and check it's responsiveness with your browser's dev tools (allowing you to resize on the fly according to target device.)  Hope that helps!"

Seems like they took a lot of the character/uniqueness out of the type. Now it sorta just looks like a facebook ""f"" in front of a default sans serif bold ""acebook"".  That said, apparently they're going for a more down to earth, friendly look. Looking at the old logo, I definitely wouldn't call it ""friendly"" - it has a very serious, robotic, utilitarian look to it. It seems like this is a step away from that serious theme, but not necessarily in the direction of playful or friendly. More just in the direction of generic, and generic isn't robotic so I guess that's something?

I think the quote you're looking for is ""that's so simple and great, I can't believe I never thought of that"".  There's an art in making things look easy.  Simplifying without losing meaning etc. and making it look good isn't easy at all.  Another thing to keep in mind is that on Dribbble the work you share has to come across in a tiny image.

Fanboy wanking over the more ""magic"" side of the force by designing a overly bad ass alien looking warrior.  My biggest problem though, why is his face exposed and why are the fins there?    The entire point of the helmet was to help Vader breath. It was a practical function of his suit, in additional to offering a intimidating form. With the flourishes and design sensibilities all being a natural extension of storm trooper/imperial tech adapted for a special purpose.  Here they just look silly and it feels like they were added because the designer wanted something that harkened back to SW.. because nothing else here really does.  If they were flourishes on a helmet, or ideally, a mask, it would probably fit better. But the lack of any armor would still kill it for me.  EDIT: Were this a different character, not trying to co-opt the name Vader, I'd probably be a tab more accepting. Maybe a name like Darth Fectus (no clue it that exists, btw) or something like that in the Star Wars style of Darth naming."

I don't know how he would even fight using that.  Isn't the point of a redesign that it takes elements of the original and updates it in some way? This isn't just not reminiscent of Darth Vader, it's not even reminiscent of Star Wars.   It looks like an EU writer wanted to be dark and gritty and make a new Sith that was just soooo badass, or if someone took Halo 4's Didact but jammed giant meat cleavers into his head.

Showcasing that the dark side really changes not only your inner but also your outer form, twisting and contorting your body into this new dark machine-like figure.  However - as much as it is scary, it's missing the truly intimidating aspect that the Sith thrive in. This is more like a sci-fi version of the creature from The Strain, or what lives in the caves from The Descent, not a Sith that can walk into a dark room and not be instantly seen.  It's good art, but I think the labelling is kind of grasping at straws to make it fit."

When the now playing art is visible the controls are in the middle which seems a bit odd.  While the designer's assertion that the existing iTunes UI is a bit bogus is correct, I don't actually see that being addressed in his revised designs, all controls are still hidden or have been left out.  This design is kind of like designing a car with nor door handles, rearview mirrors or turn signals because the render looks better than the reality.  These photo comps however, are very beautiful.

Let's say you are going to sell the shirt and you sell quite a few, their lawyers or patentlaw firm finds out and they drag your ass to court saying you made money because if their character and their target group, I think it is very likely they can put a claim on your work. Honestly if it is for you and some buddies to wear, no problemo.but selling it is gray/illegal area imo. Best way is to ask actual.Lawyers though, not strangers on the Internet. 😃"
Design,3bhn5w,VallleyNL,2,Mon Jun 29 10:49:54 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for your response! I think I might just leave this one alone then.

Design,3bhn5w,nicetriangle,2,Tue Jun 30 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"OP is specifically designing products to distribute to others (possibly sell?) so the comparison isn't very apt, nor is OP a team of cute little leaguers."
Design,3bhn5w,pixelneer,9,Tue Jun 30 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple really.   By asking the question you already know it's questionable.  As /u/VallleyNL points out.. if your'e just doing this for a friend, no worries. If your'e selling them, well.. you might get away with it. Places like custom ink won't print it because they won't take on the liability of being involved even remotely with a copyright lawsuit if that tells you anything."
Design,3bhn5w,s8rlink,4,Mon Jun 29 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"I like to explain this by turning things around, imagine you made a sick character and some illustrations, you put em in you began cell, personal website, you pay to have copyrights to the likeness of your character and you sell a lot of prints and t shirts and you're happy.   Years later you're walking in Spain during a trip and to your surprise you see a shop where there are different varieties of your illustration and character, some very similar to yours, other in different styles but still using your idea and character, this would infuriate almost any creative, you took time and money to make this yours, and someone is making money off your creativity."
Design,3bhn5w,nvolker,3,Mon Jun 29 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"you pay to have copyrights to the likeness of your character and you sell a lot of prints and t shirts and you're happy.    You don't have to pay for a copyright. Any work you create is de-facto copyrighted. You are probably thinking of a registered trademark.   Years later you're walking in Spain during a trip and to your surprise you see a shop where there are different varieties of your illustration and character, some very similar to yours, other in different styles but still using your idea and character, this would infuriate almost any creative, you took time and money to make this yours, and someone is making money off your creativity.    Again, this would be a trademark issue. Characters, logos, tag lines, and pretty much any other thing that is unique to your ""brand"" can be trademarked. Trademarks expire much sooner than copyrights, unless you continue to use them. Good examples of the distinction are the fleischer superman cartoons. The cartoons fell into the public domain, so they can be distributed by anyone. Superman, the character, is still trademarked, so you can't create and distribute your own ""Superman"" works.  Copyright only protects you from others redistributing your original work. Trademark protects you from others using intellectual property unique to your ""brand."""

Design,3bebwy,pylamb,151,Sun Jun 28 12:45:34 2015 UTC,"I hate to be the one to say it, but I feel like this is more about cultural cliches than it is about actual contemporary trends that are  considered to be in good taste and are prevalent in a set of countries today.  For example, if this post included a section on Russia, it would probably include a ton of red, rugs everywhere, as well as small trinkets. In reality, if you were to walk into a relatively well-off Russian's house or apartment you'd probably see a lot of subdued off-white hues, mixed with a fairly eclectic combination of glass and traditional interior design elements (for example a glass coffee table on a light Persian rug, or a cream colored sofa with strong rectangular lines with a 19th century landscape painting behind it).  Similarly, many contemporary takes on Victoria homes in the US today are not limited to the subdued color shceme shown. A lot of the time you'll find colors like Tiffany plue or NYU purple, among many others, thrown into the mix in very prominent ways.  I will mention that all the above is based on my own experience, so it should be taken with a huge grain of salt. With that being said, the post is definitely a great starting point for understanding the roots of interior design traditions in many countries."
Design,3bebwy,deyv,50,Sun Jun 28 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"No need to pull your punch as you did in your last sentence. Most of these themes seem to be put together by someone who spent minimal time at most in these countries. The Mexico theme is closer to American Southwest. The China theme is a ""trend"" more from the Qing dynasty than any modern Chinese design ideas. Etc etc.  The design ideas themselves are ok, the post is just mislabeled. It's more like ""Décor themes based on cultural clichés."""

So in order to not offend these people's sense of etiquette, I've just decided to always make my criticism as constructive as possible on this sub, even if I personally think it's neither necessary nor really appropriate.

Design,3bebwy,Recoil42,3,Sun Jun 28 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, for fuck's sake! Morocco and Spain share the same fucking interior and exterior design traditions. You could even say that their city planning traditions are virtually identical, seeing as southern Spain was a de facto colony of Morocco for centuries! Traditional Spanish design is arguably less colorful and more subdued than Moorish design, and still Spain has the most colorful palette in western Europe.  I didn't really feel like commenting on this in my original post, but that bugged the hell out of me too. Seeing as Morocco is very much a fundamentalist and traditional country, the actual interior design norms are still very much the colorful look you posted.   Things like the link from OP or the ""10 commandments of typography"" that gets reposted here and on /r/typography at least every 3-4 months kind of annoy me. Yes, China has a lot of red, yes Japanese folks like translucent screens, no you shouldn't mix too many typefaces, etc. But these are such incredible generalizations, that I can't even force myself to call them the spark notes versions of actual design concepts. There have been times when I mixed three typefaces in one multi-page document. Why? Because it made perfect sense, in context, and added clarity to the document as a whole (it was a portfolio with design and engineering projects - I don't recall the exact fonts and weights now, but Serif for headings, humanist sans for body text and captions, geometric sans for all technical annotations and callouts). Guidelines are great, but it puzzles me when I see them heralded as some sort of holy grail on subs that I assume are for professional or close to professional people. I don't know, maybe there are just more students and hobby-designers on reddit than pros? For what it's worth, /r/engineering and /r/AskEngineers typically have pretty advanced or work-related content and I mostly found it really boring as a student, that is if it didn't just totally go over my head. But having worked for a couple of years, I find the content and discussion on those subs absolutely awesome."

Design,3bebwy,ventdivin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:43:44 2015 UTC,"With regards to Morocco, I'll admit that my knowledge of the country is only second hand, based on stories of people who travelled there, mostly between the mid 70's and late 90's. So I won't pretend I'm an expert on the topic.  Southern Spain is a different story. I've spent a decent amount of time there being mentored in photography/photojournalism. The Moorish expulsion happened in 1492 and prior to that Andalusia was largely a set of Moorish city-state that were gradually conquered by the Spanish crown. You can't deny that every major city in southern Spain is built around a Moorish fortress or mosque... In that regard, yes, the old parts of old Spanish cities have much in common with old cities in Morocco. Furthermore, just as the symbols of NYC are Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, and the Empire State building, despite locals really not caring much about those things, the Alhambra, Alcazar, or the cathedral in Cordoba are symbols of their respective cities to the world, even if locals in those cities couldn't care less about them."

It also accounts for all needed screens/hud assets   Step 2 Asset list gets built.  Component list gets built. Screen list gets built  Step 3 Priority assigned. Schedule built.  Work estimated and then you are ready to go for it.  Approach each assets design from the same place you approached your games visual space. Keeping your already awesome visual style.  some questions, What platform are you building your ui in? Does it support animation ? What is your asset path and asset management system?

I was thinking maybe there was some difference in the way CMYK inks and toners interact when they overprint, so that toners need different base colors in order to have a similar gamut."
Design,3b9c8z,haracas,2,Sat Jun 27 02:49:33 2015 UTC,"I think toner-based are subject to high-temperature, they are fixed on paper with electro-magnetism and fixed on the paper passing in a very super-hot oven, istead the process colors are cold from fabric to print, just a little bit warmed on the exit from UV or IR lights (some also from fire but only in roto-offset)."
Design,3b9c8z,haracas,14,Sat Jun 27 12:02:10 2015 UTC,What's the hardest printing request you've had to fulfil? Have you been asked to do custom print techniques or had to invent new techniques to satisfy a job?
Design,3b9c8z,Accalon-0,17,Sat Jun 27 02:12:11 2015 UTC,"The hardest request was from BMW in that they wanted a printer who had the balls to transform their 2013 BMW M6 into a printing press, which I linked a video of above. The biggest challenge is that the car would travel at various speeds, sometimes up to 100 MPH, and we had to figure out how to account for that. What we did was purchase thousands of dollars in spray nozzles to determine the proper air pressure, spray angle and orifice size. When the car was traveling faster, it required a much larger nozzle to increase the ink output.  The other challenge was how to get the ink to dry quickly. We ended up selecting a water-based flexo ink that dries in minutes with a thick laydown, yet has a really thin viscosity. The result is a really neat print that has a remarkable texture to it.  In regards to building the inking system, we tried various things (even UV inks) and none of it worked properly. We then thought of the spraying system, which is all encased in the trunk. Since the M6 has the battery in the trunk, we hooked an inverter up to it, plugged our compressor into the inverter, the compressor then pumped air into the pressure tanks and we then had the open/close valves turn on/off via a solenoid that was attached to a switch. Although this sounds easy in theory, thinking of it was the biggest challenge, especially under a tight time constraint. We literally worked all labor day weekend to make this happen and were on the track 4 days after receiving the two cars.  Finally, we had to secure a location and I scouted several race tracks. Another challenge was finding a track that would let us spray crap all over their track (due to safety concerns, primarily) yet still had a good visual aesthetic. We decided on Blackhawk Farms, which is a road course for motorcycles and high-performance vehicles.  I'd also like to mention that this was our first job for BMW and failure was not an option since people had their jobs depending on its success."
Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,4,Sat Jun 27 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"In your opinion then what's one print process that you feel should be more popular? I'm a big fan of neon inks and special finishes but short of silk screening, it's almost prohibitive expensive to do a medium sized print job with any special finishes."
Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,6,Sat Jun 27 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"Finding the right printing process is key for doing techniques. What if I told you I could run glitter inline on my offset press? The piece literally goes in as white paper and comes out printed with glitter all over it.  When we printed Sappi The Standard Volume 5, we knew it had to be a book for both designers and printers. Every single coating (aside from scratch and sniff) within that book is run inline on press, from the gritty sandpaper to the glow in the dark. We used over 35 photopolymer plates (what applies the coating) on that project. Contact Sappi and get your hands on a copy of it.  Sappi 5 Video: https://vimeo.com/39657379  The above said, it's not that you have to silk screen to get an effect, it's that you haven't found the printers who can do these techniques without silk screening. Doing the techniques inline requires an investment on the part of the printers since they have to buy various rollers, pumps and chambers.  Since you might be stuck using whoever your current printers are, one technique they can probably do that will add some interest is reticulating varnish. Reticulating varnish has a really textured feel to it and can be run inline on press using an overall gloss UV coating and a special varnish. All your printer would need is the varnish and UV capabilities. Google it and you'll see plenty of visuals on what it is."

Traditionally, that coating volume is applied via silk screening. Due to our investment in additional rollers and pumping systems we're able to do it inline."
Design,3b9c8z,specialvillain,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"One thing that wasn't mentioned, or really shown, is how did you keep the paper in a usable state?

Design,3b9c8z,yourotherusername,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:54:02 2015 UTC,"We weren't worried about the track embossing the paper. We used a thick cover stock (120 lb.) and that surely helped. To hold the sheets down we used white duct tape.  Also, BMW preferred the piece have imperfections as it was supposed to be a unique work of art. If everything was similar and perfect it wouldn't have been as cool."
Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,6,Sat Jun 27 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"Since my response below mostly talked about myself, I'll take a moment to enlighten you, and other readers, on something you probably haven't seen before.  There is a UV coating we make that can shift from one color to another, much like a car does when it has one of those expensive paint jobs. The pigments are called interference pigments and they work on the theory of color subtraction. The pigment removes a certain light spectrum, allowing the viewer to see one color or another depending on viewing angle (red when viewed one way, green when viewed another).  Recently, we found a vehicle capable of transferring these pigments in a UV varnish, allowing us to do more finely detailed work with the color shifting technique. When the pigment is in a coating you can't get a high level of detail due to the plate that must be used. Using a varnish enables us to print everything from fine screens to solid areas. Best of all, the technique is cheaper since you're not laying down as much pigment.  Video for reference... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbDsQCQXpLA"

Design,3b9c8z,yourotherusername,0,Sat Jun 27 05:05:41 2015 UTC,they like trim marks too!  EDIT: just kidding.
Design,3b9c8z,yourotherusername,5,Sat Jun 27 06:17:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a printer and I would prefer no crop or trim marks at all. Just a 1/8"" bleed on all sides.   While all printers are different, here is my reasoning: none of my trade printers want me to put marks on the file, they want to do it. And personally I want to put marks on it myself when I run it in house. I also want to do my own imposition, I might run it on letter size or tabloid, I might want more room for margin.   Also, and maybe I am weird, but when we run something digitally, we only put crop marks (actually, a cut line!) On the first sheet. Then all following sheets are just the job with no marks at all. Why? Because that gives me more leeway in cutting AND still gives me cut marks on the final cut. Just throw the top sheet away when done."
Design,3b9c8z,pomegranate_popper,3,Sat Jun 27 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"We actually prefer not having trim marks. A lot of designers will send in files with trim marks, but won't have a margin between the cut mark and the final trim edge of the sheet... If we left these alone without fixing them, and had any variation in cutting, they'd show up on the piece."
Design,3b9c8z,jonivono,2,Sat Jun 27 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"Just like the rest of the printers said, no trim marks please. We'll do it ourselves. You just worry about the bleed and the margins. :)"
Design,3b9c8z,gurlat,17,Sat Jun 27 16:58:39 2015 UTC,"As a designer, you should know how to properly build a file. This includes proper bleeds, CMYK images and 300 DPI (offset and high-quality digital). More importantly, you should have a good print resource who can think things through with you.   For instance, I had a job this week from a client and they wanted to create their own full-bleed A6 envelope for a mailer (quantity almost 90,000) with the flap on the shorter dimension. The design also printed full bleed on the flap and inside. If they went that route they'd have to manually insert 90,000 envelopes, pay a premium on the postage due to orientation and they'd have to custom convert everything. Instead, I told them to use a stock A6 readymade envelope, eliminate the full bleed printing on the flap and inside pattern, and reduce the size of the pieces inside by 1/4"" to get automated inserting. This saved the client thousands and thousands of dollars. After all, why spend the majority of your budget on your envelope when minimal changes will make a big difference in ROI?  The point to my story is I don't concern myself with file prep and all of that other stuff. The key thing designers need to know is they should find the right partners who can help them get the most out of their budget and achieve a great result. Find people who are on the forefront of innovation and can help your clients communicate better in the marketplace through new techniques and technologies as well.   In the example above, my client designed without knowing the impact some simple envelope adjustments would have on his project. He's also an accomplished designer and very knowledgeable about printing processes. You're never going to know everything, so stick to being an expert in design and partner with professionals."
Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,3,Sat Jun 27 03:40:38 2015 UTC,"How do you suggest we go about finding a ""good print resource""?  I'm in LA, so I'm absolutely positive that there are great ones around, but I'm even more sure that there are far too many horrible ones."

Design,3b9c8z,yourotherusername,7,Mon Jun 29 01:46:44 2015 UTC,"Going along (or against?) with the OP's response: Know your budget and pick a printer for that budget. If you want something very specific with custom paper, inks, sizes, etc. and you want to sit down with someone and work out details -- find a printshop like the one the OP runs and be prepared to pay for it.  If you or your client are just printing several hundred flyers or a couple posters for marketing purposes, contact a printshop like mine that specializes in fast turnaround and low prices. We've had people come in off the street (we're an online printer, but accept walk-ins begrudgingly) who have an entire shopping list of paper types, folds, inks, etc. that they want. We try to help them the best we can, but in the end we save them money by saving us time and energy. We want to use our house stock and get the materials printed ASAP. We don't have time to sit down for multiple meetings. We will refer those types of customers to higher end printers.  There's nothing wrong with either type of printer and they each have their place, just know which type you want and be realistic with your budget.  EDIT Oh, and when you contact us for a quote, please just tell us what the final size of your piece will be. Don't try to do our job for us and say things like ""Well, you can fit four on a piece of paper so we only need to order 50."" You have no idea how we're going to impose it. Unless you're planning to cut it yourself, just give it to us 1-up and let us do the rest."
Design,3b9c8z,jonivono,3,Sat Jun 27 06:04:42 2015 UTC,"If you've got a Print company in mind for a job (eg. The customer always uses one particular company, or you require some specific printing process that only a few printers offer) talk to them before you design the job, tell them your ideas and find out the technical limitations of their equipment.  A few of the issues I've seen... A file with 7 spot colours that's supposed to be run on a 5 colour offset press... A job with 6pt white text reversed out of a 4-colour image, on a reel-fed semi-rotary press (they simply don't have accurate enough registration to print such a job)....   I've lost track of how many times I've seen a print file submitted for digital printing where the 'Black' is actually something like 70%K 50%C 43%M 62%Y ... (ie. RGB black converted to CMYK) It comes out looking dark grey. For digital print, blacks should be 100%K, 5%CMY, or 100%K 30%CMY etc...  But for offset a good deep black is usually 100%K 40%C (no M or Y). Again, talk to the printer, ask them what works best on their equipment.  On a similar note, I see a lot of spot colour jobs that have been converted to CMYK before being sent in for digital printing, because the customer/designer was told that digital equipment all uses CMYK, so they think they're being helpful. Most decent digital equipment is quite capable of converting Pantone colours to CMYK all by themselves. Many digital devices actually have additional colours beyond CMYK (e.g Special Greens, Reds). Converting a spot colour file to CMYK most of the time makes it harder to print and harder to match colours. Again, talk to the print company."
Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,4,Sat Jun 27 08:41:06 2015 UTC,"Yep. We convert to 40%C/100%K in our shop. Sometimes if a client wants a really rich black, we'll do 50/40/40/100 to avoid putting too much ink on the sheet.  The problem with blacks is the default ""Registration"" color in Adobe products is 100/100/100/100, and the ""black"" (#000000) in Photoshop is not even black."
Design,3b9c8z,TherionSaysWhat,3,Sat Jun 27 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong with 100%k 30%cmy in my opinion. Runs great on digital machine and offset. Yes, you can do better, talk to the printer, but if you are pressed for time and can't ask I've found it produces a good result every time."

In my opinion, the printer's job is to make the designer's work shine, not teach them how to prep files.  In order for printing to stay relevant designers need tools (techniques & technologies) so they can use print effectively. If printing isn't effective, it might as well be put out on a digital format since it's cheaper.  It's for the reasons above that I believe my job is educating on what they can do with print, rather than how to prep a file. After all, the prepress guys need to keep their jobs as well :)."
Design,3b9c8z,tauntaun-soup,11,Sat Jun 27 02:26:06 2015 UTC,"Why do you separate output into ""printing"" and ""digital format""? (Or by digital format do you mean a tablet or computer screen?)  As for file prep, I think this is my biggest bitch with ""designers"". The cost to the customer to create a bleed out of thin air is huge compared to the designer doing it right the first time. Just one example of file prep.  My next biggest complaint is tied between the "" designer"" specking an obscure and expensive paper for no reason (other than it sounding cool) when a house stock will do, and designers with no regard for common paper sizes and output.   Then I can rant about envelopes and the endless list of what can't be done when the customer has a budget but the designer had a vision.  And I'll finish that off with the designers who throw us printers under the bus when we explain what printing costs and why what they want is expensive or downright impossible with existing technology (on their budget/quantity/time frame). I just had a designer try to explain how crop marks work to me last week. My staff was in stitches over it.   When I find a good designer, I refer them as much work as I can to keep them in business."
Design,3b9c8z,demainlespoulpes,4,Sat Jun 27 02:49:56 2015 UTC,"By digital I mean communication devices, not printers.  As for bleeds, yes they are the most common issue we run into in addition to image resolution. On digitally printed projects we point out where the designer went wrong so they can fix their own files. In those cases we're processing PDFs. When it comes to offset, we do the file assembly and part of our job is to fix those little issues the designer missed. It's not much of a headache, in my experience.  As for expensive paper, what kind of papers are you talking about? Where applicable, quote the job both ways to show them the cost differences. Paper is the biggest determining factor in regards to print quality and I respect any designer willing to pay for high-quality since it makes our jobs easier and the finished piece looks better. Your house stock is probably a no. 3 sheet so brightness and surface usually suffers when a more expensive paper is swapped out.  In regards to pricing, yes that's always a battle. I usually don't waste my time when I get a sense price is the only determining factor on if someone will go with me. After all, I can spend the time I lose dealing with a price-sensitive client on a client who's willing to pay a fair market value for my work."
Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,7,Sat Jun 27 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"Not all bleeds are easy to recreate and on a $75 job how much art time can you give away when the designer was already paid to do it right?  Understand, this is from the perspective of a small mom and pop printer. Our house sheet is Mohawk color copy, it's nice for digital work. I don't mind quoting a paper if they are willing to spend the money, but I'd say 49 times out of 50 they balk at the cost. Our average print run is 500 ish. Often they want a paper that is only available in a folio size and that means cutting and shipping charges on top of the special paper costs, OR it is available, but only as a special order and comes by the carton. They just don't plan ahead on small projects.  Quoting both ways is fine but when they go with the house stock every time it is annoying to constantly source and price new papers you know they won't buy. I too respect designers that care about the final look and are either willing to be reasonable or pay for it.   I love my job, but its been a hell of a month and I needed to vent. Thanks!"

All the salesperson has to do is communicate the fact that they will have to pay additional for the paper and it'll take more time to come in. Quote it both ways and let the client decide what they want to do. You look good for trying to save them money, and if they go with the special order paper you've got extra inventory you can sell again later. Also, you might have a sample afterwards you can show on a unique stock versus the same old 4/4 on white uncoated that looks the same as the other guy's work across the street."

I think drummondaw works in an entirely different type of print shop than we do. I deal with customers who have been given crappy files by their designers. They have very limited budgets, time, and knowledge of the industry.   We stay very busy so taking the time to correct bleeds and margins on a $40 job is a bit ridiculous, however we rarely charge the customer for that time because it's usually an issue only because their designer didn't know what they were doing. We feel badly about punishing the customer with an additional charge for something that their designer should have provided them with in the first place.  (Note: This does not include our corporate clients who generally have multiple designers on staff. Because we've trained them about printing over the years, they know how to design for us and they accept higher costs and longer turnaround times. We are happy to quote as many paper types as they want because these are the clients who give us the big bucks.)  I went to school for graphic design and happened to stumble into printing, so I know both worlds. I also know now that every graphic designer should learn about printing. I still do freelance design work, and I would be embarrassed to be a designer who knew nothing about something as simple as putting together print-ready files."
Design,3b9c8z,robinsonick,2,Sat Jun 27 05:47:37 2015 UTC,"As someone who also works in printing, I agree on all points.  It's always refreshing when a client actually specs a specific stock -- it usually means they know what they're looking for.

Clients want to pay bottom dollar and receive top tier work at the same time; and it just doesn't work that way."

I was referring to bare basics like RGB v CMYK, resolution, bleeds, etc.   Yours is a great viewpoint to have if you're dealing with experienced agencies but very much another when dealing with new, inexperienced designers or the dreaded hobbyists. Just earlier today I got a 36dpi PNG when I asked for the client's logo. At least once a week I get a screen cap from vistaprint and asked ""just print this"". This is common here at my current day job but was extremely rare in my last press shop. Different clients, etc. have different levels of basic understanding. In addition, poor file prep on the design side only costs more money (in labor horus) in production as well as adding time to the turn-around, both of which are detrimental to the client.  Anyhoo, great work putting the thread together. Some interesting reading =) Cheers!"
Design,3b9c8z,specialvillain,2,Mon Jun 29 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"In that case, bounce it back and tell them what needs to be fixed. If a company hires a designer to design something and they can't build a basic print file they really shouldn't be designing something professionally. These are the same people who probably wouldn't read a document if laid in front of them. After all, the information on how to build a print file is out there on the web in many many places...  link  When the work/time investment to fix their file, or make note of issues, gets to the point where it takes out a chunk of profit they're not a client worth having. Not knowing how to prep something is just laziness on their part, not ignorance. This stuff is all really easy to look up and many designers do a great job of it, so why can't they?"

Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,8,Sat Jun 27 02:37:45 2015 UTC,The key to doing this stuff is to have the guts to fail at it. We've had numerous failures through developing the techniques we're able to print. You're not going to develop new things by only trying to do it once (or never starting in the first place). Invest heavily in R&D and don't wait for your suppliers to do it for you. Seek out new suppliers constantly and don't get married to any one vendor.

Design,3b9c8z,MarsNeedsGuitars,9,Sat Jun 27 02:53:17 2015 UTC,"For digital jobs we prefer PDF files with images as CMYK and 300 DPI. We process the file in prepress and ensure everything will print correctly and then make the client aware of any problems. Although the digital press can take RGB files, it's not recommended. If you have some images preconverted as CMYK with one profile (yours) and we use our profile to convert the remainder of RGB images there's a disconnect.  For offset jobs we prefer PDFs for content and an InDesign package with links, fonts and InDesign files. We assemble all of the files and make any necessary prepress tweaks. In addition, we have full retouching capabilities and if we see something like a neutral gray built out of 4/c we'll GCR (gray component replacement) the image so it prints correctly on press.   All of our presses (even our Indigo) are set up for G7 color standards so we can get color consistency across the brand no matter where the piece prints. Digital jobs are also compared to our soft-proofing system (Insite) for color using color calibrated monitors in a light booth with the proper lighting. Yes, soft-proofing isn't 100% accurate, but it's a lot closer than just blindly running color."

I'm new to the design world, just finished up my bachelors and my internships, now I'm headed into the professional world where I'm going to need to build a relationship with printers and print shops. What's the best way to start the conversation with a printer to build a good work and professional relationship? What approaches do you most appreciate? What approaches immediately turn you off to a potential client? Thanks again!!   Edit for typos."
Design,3b9c8z,catglitch,5,Sat Jun 27 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"First, talk to your fellow design community and get some recommendations on printers. Go to a design gathering or an AIGA event and start talking to people. Get a few contacts so you have some options. Not every printing company has the same capabilities.  When approaching a printer, we like designers who have an interest in our work. Do plant tours and ask tons of questions so you can learn how they operate and what their capabilities are. Also, look at their work as that's a big determining factor in who their client base is. For instance, if you see a lot of traditional 4/c work with bad design and you're working for a high-end agency, it probably won't be a fit. You will rarely meet a print salesman who won't jump at an opportunity to speak with a potential client. Personally, I love talking to recent grads since it's a good opportunity to build a relationship and they'll bring me into their future employers. I teach them and make them look good, and they help me get some business in return.  Like my last sentence mentions, a relationship goes both ways. The printer should be helping you get some good fresh ideas and you should be letting him produce work done with those ideas. What turns us printers off is when we spend time working through a project with someone and then they go to another vendor over a small price difference. Doing that means you won't get much more help from that person since they're just helping their competition. Also, don't make price your most important factor - think quality. If you pay someone $1,000 less to print something and the job screws up you won't look like a hero for saving the $1,000."
Design,3b9c8z,jasperspee,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:15:07 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the thorough reply! Do those AIGA events go nation wide? I'm close to a few mid sized cities but about 4-6 hours away from a major city depending which direction you're driving. The company that I interned at seemed to have a good relationship with their printer. The only downside I ever saw with the partnership was how far away they are (about 45 min). It's not a terrible drive but I was at my internship for a year and never met anyone from the print shop nor did my boss ever travel down there. Items were always just delivered. How important is it to be close to your printer?
Design,3b9c8z,rpd9803,3,Sat Jun 27 04:17:24 2015 UTC,"AIGA is in many major cities, but design meetups are all over the place. You can even hop on LinkedIn and ask around.  If a printer isn't close to you it's not a huge deal if they're producing the work correctly. For more special projects it might be worth the drive to check things out. I have clients I've never met face-to-face and that's just the nature of our business sometimes when distance is involved.  That said, the fact that the printer is only 45 minutes away and didn't take the time to visit with you guys on occasion isn't a good sign. I'm guessing you guys didn't do a ton of print work ;)."

Any advice for someone looking to branch out on their own in 2015?"
Design,3b9c8z,tequilapancake,6,Sat Jun 27 03:12:49 2015 UTC,"Build up a client base for your design capabilities, but keep it on the down low. Once you have a significant client base established you can then branch out onto your own.   Believe it or not, sales is a very difficult thing to do. You may see the salespeople at your current company and think they have it easy, but remember that if they don't sell they don't eat. When you develop the sales skill only then will you be able to get out on your own. Build that confidence, learn how to work with people and more importantly, learn to communicate how you will help a client's business succeed. It sounds easy, but it's not."

Design,3b9c8z,thescimitar,2,Sat Jun 27 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered what tools you use to layup on larger sheets. Say if I have a particular smallish project w/ bleed to print, you'd probably lay that up multiple times on an sheet right? What do you use to economise space and still be able to guillotine or die-cut?"
Design,3b9c8z,thescimitar,3,Sat Jun 27 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"http://graphics.kodak.com/us/en/product/printing_workflow/production_planning/preps_software/  The artwork also determines layout. For instance, if I have similar images I'd rather have those laid out from gripper to tail on the sheet since the ink keys run that direction. In addition, if I'm running a spot color with reversed out areas that could create a potential ghosting problem on press; in this case we actually cock the layout slightly to keep the ink uniform on press. When a cocked layout gets to the cutter we'll do what's called ""cutting on a bias"" and build a jig at the proper angle to cut everything down."
Design,3b9c8z,puppyShaker,2,Sat Jun 27 04:08:18 2015 UTC,cock the layout slightly   Do you mean putting it on a slight angle?  That's really interesting. Is it because of the angle that spot colours are etched?
Design,3b9c8z,sudin,2,Sat Jun 27 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, putting it on an angle. It's because of the ink takeoff in the press. For instance, if you have a solid square in a spot color with a reversed out circle inside of it as paper white it'll ghost the circle into the pieces above it. When you angle the layout the ink is taken off of the plates/rollers more uniformly, eliminating the ghost."

Design,3b9c8z,avidworks,2,Sat Jun 27 04:33:29 2015 UTC,How have you seen your industry change over the past 10 or so years? It seems like the printing industry is more cutthroat now than ever before.   Also! Is there any way to get an accurate representation of what a print will look like without a physical proof? We almost never get to see proofs due to the quick turnaround time our clients demand. I learned the hard way that darks get darker when they are printed and the first banner I did just looked like a solid black background. I've always wondered if there were any tricks aside from experience. (hopefully that makes sense)
Design,3b9c8z,normanhome,2,Sat Jun 27 06:27:46 2015 UTC,"The industry is more price focused now than it ever has before. The declining demand for print has forced printers to compete primarily on price, thus making print a commodity. In our business, we focus more on the effects and inline techniques so competition isn't as much of an issue. In addition, we innovate ways to do things that our competitor's haven't. For instance, we just introduced a silver ink that can replicate the appearance of a foil stamp. Since our competitors don't have that ink, they have to quote the jobs as foil stamping and we destroy them.  You can't get an accurate representation of print without seeing a physical proof on the correct substrate. That said, things will look a little different on press since it's actual ink versus a donor from a proofing system."
Design,3b9c8z,adhere2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you are referring to as a ""physical proof"", but for offset work your printer should have the capablity of outputting a press color calibrated Epson/Digital Contract proof."
Design,3b9c8z,jonivono,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"Well, on an offset job an Epson won't be accurate since it's not on the correct substrate.

Design,3b9c8z,adhere2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I guess you guys are way ahead of what we have.

The minute and hour hands move by receiving electrical pulses from a central clock, making sure they are in sync. The second hand runs on an electrical motor in the clock itself.

Apple was initially accused of using the clock design without permission.   Although the exact details of the licensing agreement are confidential,  it was reported that Apple ultimately paid Swiss national rail operator SBB about CHF 20M (about US$22.4M as of January 2014) to license the use of the clock design.

Design,3b5d6e,vuxanov,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"Weeeell... The term 'HTML5' basically means using HTML5 elements, CSS3 properties, and javascript. In my case I didn't even use any true HTML5 elements (except for maybe the doctype). I did use CSS3 though. I could have used a canvas element, but for something quick like this, CSS3 did the trick just fine.   The best way to start learning is to just build stuff like this on the fly. Have an idea? Try making it. You can follow some online tutorials, but if you want to truly learn blaze your own path.   Learning the basics of HTML and CSS is a great start and absolutely essential to doing any web development. There are two main types of web developers: frontend (client side) and backend (server side).   Javascript is a frontend language. Because you're commenting in a design subreddit, I'm sure that's where you are wanting to head. Frontend development is way more frustrating than backend to me because of cross browser compatibility. On the flipside, you get to make cool shit that makes people say, ""that's awesome!""  PHP is a backend language. For a frontend guy, you don't have to know PHP, but knowing it doesn't hurt. The more you know, the better off you'll be.   I'll be honest, I've used a wordpress theme on one project. I don't have too much to comment on that other than I prefer to build things myself. It's good that you want to dive into something because it doesn't suit your needs. That's kinda how my path started.   What to look for? Learn HTML, CSS. Know those tools well. HTML will be fairly simple. CSS will be stupidly frustrating because it's not semantic and the rules for what you can and can't use are always changing. After you have those down, learn javascript."

Design,3b5d6e,ZippytheQuick,5,Fri Jun 26 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"Watch designer here: I draw watches in illustrator almost every day.   Some tips. Draw one index at the 12 position. Select this index then select the rotate tool. Hold alt and click this tool at the center of the watch (use rulers and guides to did center) this will pop up the rotate options where you can enter the degree rotation.  30degrees for hours, 6 degrees for minute and seconds, 1.2 degrees for fine chronograph track. Press copy to create one index copied and rotated to the proper position.  Then select the white arrow tool and click on this new index and the original index and hit Cntrl+g to group them. Then with the white arrow tool only select the second index and press Cntrl+d the appropriate number of times to make all other indexes. Because you grouped the first 2, all new indexes will be grouped with them.   To make a sunray dial create a circle with a gradient fill that goes white, grey, white,grey, white.  Try to make it symmetrical. Make sure there is no outline color. Copy and paste this circle directly on top of itself. Cntrl+c then Cntrl+f to paste in front. Scale the front copy down very small.  Select both circles and go to object,blend,make. This will blend the 2 together with one step between them. Next with this still selected got to object,blend,options and choose specify steps. Change the number to something between 40 and 60.  The higher the number the smoother the blend, but it will slow you computer down if you have a lot of these high blends on one page."

Whenever i buy a new gadget, or see some well wrapped boutique product in a store, I can't help but gawk. I love the idea of creating something beautiful like that, and being able to have a tactile experience with it.   Now, I don't plan on going into packaging design as a career (not at the moment anyways), but more so as a personal hobby. Making packaging for gifts on special occasions for friends, making 'packaging' for organizational purposes and so I can just create some physical objects that I can actually hold featuring my designs (and to help really sell a design concept to a client, if need be). I also want to mention that I know virtually nothing about packaging design. In fact, I know very little about print, beyond basic business cards. And of course, I don't need to make hundreds/thousands of an item, just one.   So my question is: how do I go about crafting one-off 'package' designs by myself? And what are some resources that I can go to to learn more about this field?   Thanks! :)"

To be blunt, basically every element in these mockups isn't following iOS interface best practices - buttons, text, tab bar, spacing, segmented controls, etc.   This is where the Apple HIG's come in handy because they're really explicit and help people without a strong UI background to be able to create good enough UI simply by following the guidelines.

If we were back in the south where I come from and someone tried to silence you or get you to lose your job because of your views on abortion or gay rights, then I would defend you.  If we were in Israel and someone tried to silence or imprison you because you spoke out about the occupation of Palestine, then I would defend you.  But here on Reddit, it seems the high moral inquisition of the day seems to 3rd wave feminism, and anything that that group of people find morally objectionable needs to be sanitized and any creators of objectionable content need to be silenced.  I have a problem with that.  The entire point and need of freedom of expression is that we don't always agree. If everyone always thought exactly the same thing then it wouldn't be an issue.   It is precisely because different groups of people find different things offensive that the only way to ensure a level playing field is to let everybody be offensive equally."

So, notice I never said that it should be illegal for reddit, a private company, to moderate its site content however it pleases.  I am making a rational argument that if we want other people to tolerate our bullshit, then we have to tolerate the bullshit of others.   Furthermore, specifically on the topic of ""offensiveness"", that humor, creativity, and ultimately intellectual expression all hinge on the ability to say things that certain people find offensive, and that if why try to create what Pao so fondly calls ""safe spaces"" we will simply sanitize and sterilize the site.

Its not specifically about branding but it's great regardless of what design field you're pursuing.   http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Design-Love-Everyday-Things/dp/0465051367/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435259539&sr=1-1&keywords=emotional+design  Designing Brand Identity  Is a pretty standard book in most courses. I've yet to see a student who hasn't seen this at some point.   http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Brand-Identity-Essential-Branding/dp/1118099206/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435259469&sr=1-1&keywords=branding

I think they are just trying to hard to find a negative.   As for the overall design, I agree with the two previous points: the beams do appear optically off-center, and the the hand clutching the phone would probably be a bit more inspiring if it was held more at an angle than straight up. The current display is fine, but it is a bit softer in its approach and, most likely unintentionally, focuses the viewer's attention to the contortion of the wrist rather than the phone. Also, I would lower the contrast between the beams and the background as well. There is a little competition between them and the text at the moment."

Making something that has clever subtleties mixed into it and works well in all colours and sizes is not an easy task. The bulk of a logo price will be made up from the hourly rate from which a designer works, just like a mechanic will charge you their hourly rate to fix your car. It certainly is not price fixing when it is made up from working for an hourly pay. Price fixing would be every designer saying ""oh let's charge 10k cos we can"" without it being based on anything of merit such as the time it takes to create.

It's important to have a clear direction of what you want in your design before you hire someone. I think around $75-100 should get you a decent vectorized logo. Get them to outline their process and deliverables before they start. Personally I would go to dribbble and search terms like - brand, identity, logo, mark, and monogram - and then choose someone who doesn't have a lot of followers (more likely to be cheaper and less busy), but has a good portfolio.

Working for free promotes you as a hobbyist; someone who's enthusiastic but lacks the muscle to make money at it. Those who are good at it make money from it because their work gets money for the client, which they them share. The better you are, the more money there should be to share.  Here are the common arguments for working for free and their rough translations:  ""It gives me a creative outlet"" - I'm not good enough to win interesting contracts which pay.  ""It's good self-promotion"" - I promote myself to people who want free work because people who pay won't listen.  ""It helps startups who have no budget"" - It helps people whose ideas are so bad that they can't get any investment.  ""It will lead to bigger things"" - I'm hoping a big shot will notice me and give me a break because I can't earn one fair and square.  I don't work for free. It's not a matter of principle, it's because I don't have enough time. If you're a good designer you should be able to fill 18 hour days with cool work, all day every day.

But that would be the entire point of the rebrand and new browser, to take on Chrome, yes? ie has proven so far to be incapable of doing so.   I replied to the half of the sentence that I had objection to. The context is right there, in your own post...   Yes, but your reply made it seem as if I had said they didn't make a new lightweight browser at all, which is patently untrue. Obviously they did. I said they should have made a lightweight browser and rebranded it. One or the other wasn't enough, the whole thought is needed here.  Anyhoo I don't wish to drag this out any further, naturally you're entitled to your own opinion on the logo and ie. Have a great day."

Design,3anjvm,Kobaru,3,Mon Jun 22 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"Actually I see, in the order :    Stock photo Fish logo Same font every line   Meaning, there's no real graphic anything in this. This is clearly the job of someone who don't know what he's doing.  To improve easily, if you don't know anything. Try to play first with font weight (bold, light, etc.) and style (italic).  Then find something to really ""background"" (as a verb) your creation, related to your theme or place.  Eventually try out some ""Random shit font"" (meaning it's more a drawing than a type) on ONE OR TWO LINES MAX. The one you used for ""Burnt Tuna"" is quiet good, but take too much space, and may be a little bit ""too classic"", it feels like you got this from Word 2003.  You should be good to go for a minimalistic good creation from someone who had no experience in it, and now got one.  I hope this is useful, excuse me if my ton is a bit harsh. Creation is about experience, if you have none, that's very good to try, but I doesn't mean we have to be gentle with you :p"
