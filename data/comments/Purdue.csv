Purdue,3e3by0,Starving_Kids,5,Wed Jul 22 13:48:57 2015 UTC,The fact that Harvard isn't in the list tells you how credible it is.
Purdue,3e3by0,peyton_brady,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:15:35 2015 UTC,Still pretty cool Purdue is there. I'm not sure Harvard beats those private schools for CS.

Purdue,3e2pu3,TheRealSpaceTrout,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:26 2015 UTC,Right next to the DLR; which is next to the Police Station (close to Martin Jischke and Harrison).
Purdue,3e2pu3,NostalgicForever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:01:17 2015 UTC,It looks NOTHING like this in real life.  This is a beautiful photo.  When you see this in person it looks like a carnival ride or piece of playground equipment. Not to mention the media used to make the sun doesn't match its planets. Its a confusing piece at best.
Purdue,3e4hj6,thehoods,4,Tue Jul 21 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"You know where the classy food court is? It's the HTM Cafe. I don't know if only HTM students work there, but the food and atmosphere are much better. That was a nice little discovery.  Although one time someone called the cops on me for having a fake samurai sword on me. It was for Japanese class, and I was calmly eating soup."

Purdue,3e4hj6,therealsutano,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's sort of why I'm choosing food service, it seemed like a safe option that will still let me work the hours I want (10-14 a week)"

Purdue,3e2cdl,TheFunkwich,17,Tue Jul 21 12:32:47 2015 UTC,"The official seal of Purdue was officially inaugurated during the university's centennial in 1969. Consisting of elements from emblems that had been used unofficially for 73 years, the current seal depicts a griffin, symbolizing strength, and a three-part shield, representing education, research, and service."
Purdue,3e2cdl,manata,7,Tue Jul 21 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"This is low quality, but you can see an older version of this seal in the 1967 Rose Bowl game program (on the left)."
Purdue,3e2cdl,NoFunInBand,4,Tue Jul 21 13:38:23 2015 UTC,"I like the seal, but I've always had a weird pet peeve against mixing capital and lowercase letters like this. It just looks a bit too uncomfortable for me"

Purdue,3e2cdl,3Vil_Admin,3,Tue Jul 21 12:37:53 2015 UTC,And in my opinion should be brought back as our official logo.
Purdue,3e2cdl,kestrel1,12,Tue Jul 21 12:38:13 2015 UTC,"It is the official seal for the University and has been since 1969. It is reserved to be used on academic and official documents. The logo used more casually and what represents the University academically is the Signature Block logo.  The Block P, Motion P, and Boilermaker are all identity marks that represent the athletic teams of the University. You'll note that those logos are never used in any academic documents."
Purdue,3e2cdl,kk_knee,0,Tue Jul 21 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"There is yet another, found on diplomas, that is just a big P in a circle. Also, the Signature Block logo is on the background of transcripts."

Purdue,3e4rm8,robbyboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:25:01 2015 UTC,Professors ignore emailed requests for research positions because they get so many of them. You need to just show up at their office. I'm sure you'll be able to find something when you get back.
Purdue,3e59ih,UDK450,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"I had some buddies that did that. Had all 4 beds in the ""quiet study/sleep room"" and made the other room the party room. RAs shut that down pretty quick"
Purdue,3e59ih,kobear403,2,Wed Jul 22 01:55:12 2015 UTC,"What objection did they have? That the beds were all in one room, or that they were ""partying"" in the other room? My group of friends aren't a rambunctious sort. No ""partying"" in the ways of alcohol/other illicit activities will be occurring. However, there may be cries of uproar during video game tournaments and such."
Purdue,3e59ih,kobear403,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:11 2015 UTC,I think 4 people sleeping in 1 room is against fire code or something. Had nothing to do with rambunctiousness
Purdue,3e59ih,macaronimaniaa9,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:37:47 2015 UTC,I'm finding it difficult to find this fire code that supposedly disallows it. Anyone with better Google Fu than I?
Purdue,3e59ih,macaronimaniaa9,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:01:19 2015 UTC,I think it's technically a safety hazard? I heard a lot of things about some of the older guys in the connector sector in Wiley doing that. I'm not sure if it ever happened though.
Purdue,3e26f6,indy500watermelon,3,Tue Jul 21 11:27:56 2015 UTC,"Nearly every dorm, and many fraternities enter the Grand Prix, some with multiple entries. There are also many other student organizations and professional societies that enter.   The karts are built by the student teams, but with the exception of the best teams the karts are reused year after year.   The entries are financed through sponsorship and organization's activity funds. At minimum it costs about $1000 to field a kart for one year, with some teams spending upwards of $10,000.   As a freshman your best bet is to join a team, work hard, and learn as much as you can.   Grand Prix is a lot of fun, and definitely something to get involved in at Purdue."

Purdue,3e26f6,TheFunkwich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:09 2015 UTC,I was in Earhart this past year; I don't think they have their own team. Try motorsports club?

Purdue,3e26f6,UDK450,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"Earhart does have a team. It's in partnership with Shreve. Shrevehart (as it's called) works on it together.

Purdue,3e35eg,_FruitLoopin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:34 2015 UTC,Most of the campus jobs for students won't grant you a pass even if you're working the required hours. Your supervisor has to sign off on it and they usually won't for students from what I've seen.

If you don't even get a prompt for the password, then you're not even connecting to the server (so check your hostname and port number).

I very rarely went to class both semesters and only studied starting from the day before the exam (no joke)... I ended up with A's both semesters.

Purdue,3dvxby,Heroic_Lime,5,Sun Jul 19 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"The good news is that it's the easiest Calc class. Similarly if you're taking it 1st semester a lot of the class will be freshmen who aren't used to college, so that can help your curve. Despite massive class sizes outside of test weeks office hours usually aren't very full, so if you regularly come in they're usually pretty helpful. Take advantage of the resources and it's hard to get less than a C."
Purdue,3dvxby,makeshiftreaper,2,Mon Jul 20 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"Isn't 154 trig?  Because trig is pretty much pre-calc.  I took 154, 161, 162, 261 and 351 at Purdue and I remember 154 being especially difficult.  Not to say the others were easier but when trig is new to you it's just as difficult as calculus when it's new to you.  If you got trough 154 you'll get through the next course too."
Purdue,3dvxby,squareChimp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:37 2015 UTC,"Calc 1 isn't that bad. The best thing you can do is try to not worry as much about it. If it ends up being really difficult for you, you can have your professor or TA help you more or find a friend that knows it really well and have them tutor you. The fact that you haven't had any real pre-calc just means there might be a few things you need to spend a little extra time studying. Seriously, don't worry about it."
Purdue,3dvxby,mtn_dewgamefuel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:58:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've never taken a calc class before 16010 and I really did enjoy the class. I took 158 before I took 16010 and thought 16010 was easier. I had a great instructor which probably also helped a lot. If you need extra help make sure to go to office hours and SI!"

Purdue,3dtja4,flyeagle87,7,Sun Jul 19 08:49:19 2015 UTC,Email a nursing or preprofessional advisor. Any advice you get on here is going to be an educated guess at best. They still respond pretty quickly over the summer.
Purdue,3dtja4,robocop93pu,3,Sun Jul 19 12:39:44 2015 UTC,"This advice goes for all questions about grades, courses, programs, transcripts, etc.  Only the advisors can give you any kind of binding answers."
Purdue,3dtja4,UnknownBinary,6,Sun Jul 19 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"I've heard that the nursing program is just as competitive as the pre-pharm program.  If you're hoping you could ""slip in"" with barely their minimum gpa, then the few codo spots that open up per semester are likely going to go to someone else above you on a list.   But definitely talk to an advisor.  On another note, woo for pre-pharm drops! XD"
Purdue,3dtja4,macaronimaniaa9,2,Sun Jul 19 13:15:09 2015 UTC,The way it works is if no one drops out as a sophomore than no one gets in. If one person drops one gets in. I tried codoing  over my sophomore I didn't get in. I stuck it out in my major and now that I'm recently graduated I'm working hard at finding the right program for me and that's short enough so I can start my life. If you wanna be a nursing continue to look elsewhere don't waste your time in something you don't enjoy hoping that you'll eventually like it
Purdue,3dtja4,Benchliberator,2,Sun Jul 19 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"The official requirements for this year are a minimum 3.0 GPA (see here. In reality, I've heard that you pretty much need a 4.0 to have a decent shot at getting in. The nursing school simply doesn't have very many slots available. Every potential nursing CODO student I met last year was always stressing about staying as close to the 4.0 mark as possible. If you have any more questions just ask.   Edit:  I would like to add that if you really want to be a nurse, all hope isn't lost. One pathway is finishing a four year degree here at Purdue in whatever you enjoy (while also fulfilling any pre-req's). Once you graduate, you can apply for second degree accelerated BSN programs. Purdue (and many other schools) have these accelerated programs. I think most of them take two years to complete."
Purdue,3dtja4,Nob1816,2,Sun Jul 19 13:17:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry if you see this twice, but is it CGPA or GPA? I emailed an advisor and she talked about ""have you even taken any science classes? Have you met any of the requirements for nursing? I think you're beet suited for a different major"" and didn't respond to me after that. So I think I'm just a waste of time to them"
Purdue,3dtja4,Nob1816,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:36:36 2015 UTC,I can't say for sure which GPA they would look at. The nursing school does have two advisers. If one of them blew you off you could try the other one.

Realistically, I don't think you will be able to CODO in. Have you considered other similar jobs? Pre-physician's assistant is pretty popular here."

Bathroom attached to your room and shared w/ your next door neighbors(4 people per bathroom). It is cleaned weekly for you. Doors are heavy. Sound travels well from hallway, but isn't really an issue. Mostly upper classmen, but there are other freshmen. Gold loop and silver loop bus stops within less than a block, making it easy to get to class in bad weather. Hillenbrand dining court brunch on Sunday mornings (Hillenbrunch). Kinda far-ish from campus buildings, but not too bad. Bike/skateboard doesn't hurt to have. Overall good dorm."

Purdue,3dru7b,pancake117,2,Sat Jul 18 22:31:25 2015 UTC,There are locks on Both doors to prevent access to your room. I am not sure of locks inside the bathroom so you can prevent others from coming in while in use.
Purdue,3dru7b,bagged_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"I think you are incorrect. My roommate and I could not lock our bathroom door from the outside to prevent the suitemates and their guests from potentially coming into our room. I believe this is primarily a fire code rule - if both rooms could lock the bathroom from the outside, the person inside could be trapped.Thankfully our suitemates were nice guys, but the issue still remains that your room is only as secure as all 4 suitemates allow (provided you have a double)."
Purdue,3dru7b,pancake117,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:23:08 2015 UTC,"Someone is saying the bathroom doors lock from the inside though (I assume so you can lock it when your inside).

They are cleaned once a week during the school week(so not weekends)at a prearranged time that will depend upon which floor you are on. Your RA will tell you when this is. It's never terribly early though. They do knock before entering and if you're still in bed they'll often do the next bathroom and come back to yours later."

You don't have to be in your room, they can clean the bathroom while you're gone. You have to take everything out of the bathroom before they get there.

Personally I'd like to see if a few more of these admin positions could be eliminated/fazed out in order to either offset the tuition freeze, hire more professors, or be used for scholarships. These administrators don't necessarily have to be fired, you could just use attrition to eliminate a few posts after their current holders retire if that's a better solution."
Purdue,3dosrg,bremsstrahs_lung,9,Sat Jul 18 04:21:16 2015 UTC,Reduced public support is a (perhaps the) major cause of increasing tuition at public universities.
Purdue,3dosrg,cookie_partie,4,Sat Jul 18 09:45:25 2015 UTC,"I'd put this at [citation needed]. Purdue hasn't seen a net decrease in state or federal appropriations over the last ten years but we still increased tuition during that time.   Additionally, student tuition still forms a plurality of the University's income. Student tuition income has increased 272M over the last ten years while the total operating budget has increased 659M  Thankfully, since we are a public university, all of this data is public"
Purdue,3dosrg,cookie_partie,4,Sat Jul 18 15:53:22 2015 UTC,"Net decrease, no. A 2% total increase over 10 years isn't close to keeping up with the 25% increase in CPI that we have seen over that time, though."
Purdue,3dosrg,cookie_partie,2,Sat Jul 18 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"Then the question is does low (increase to) public funding -> higher tuition or higher tuition -> less need for more public funding or something else -> higher tuition, less funding"
Purdue,3dosrg,Hamandjam44,3,Sat Jul 18 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"The Chronicle of Higher Education has looked into this. Their stance is that states have changed their view on public post-secondary education, changing from a belief that public colleges and university benefit both individuals and society to a belief that they benefit the individual primarily. One source here and another, linking that article, here.   This change in viewpoint has led to a decrease in public funding and a larger share of tuition being taken on by students. Data for specific public institutions presented here.   There is also this data, which shows that tuition at publics has increased significantly faster than at privates (with public 4-year institutions, like Purdue, still having half of the tuition of privates).   There are other issues involved, for sure, such as decreasing rates of research funding and a desire to recruit students using new, pretty buildings; however, state legislative bodies changing views on the role and benefits of post-secondary education has made it a larger problem at public institutions."
Purdue,3dosrg,happybobjr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the research!   Hopefully we/the US can figure out the best way to handle this while keeping secondary education affordable to everyone. Of course doing more than just identifying what's wrong might take a millennia
Purdue,3dosrg,Hamandjam44,24,Sat Jul 18 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a decent move on behalf of the university. Clear up a high paying job that can be done by people already on the payroll.  ""For example, less than 4 percent of Purdue's faculty are African-American""  I don't like this fact. There are so many ethnicities/races present at Purdue each one will seem small.

By aiming to make students equal they're actually playing favoritism (i.e. not treating them as equal). And since diversity statistics are a selling point nowadays and somehow are indicative that a school promotes an open atmosphere, the true goals of the program lean even more towards favoritism to amp up statistics.   Instead of tackling the issues of micro-aggressions and discrimination through through diversity training for both the students and the faculty, the money is dumped to increase numbers that look good on paper."
Purdue,3dosrg,Hamandjam44,6,Sat Jul 18 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"I think the goal is to give a bump to numbers so that more people think it is a good place then more people attend and eventually that bump isn't needed anymore. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working all that well.   The problem with diversity training is that if you force it, it becomes a joke. Think back to AlchoholEDU- it was required and everyone just clicked through it and didn't care at all. There needs to be a way to incentivize diversity training for students and faculty without making it required."

Purdue,3dt8fh,Chuckie_Finster_AMA,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"Indiana is possibly the worst state to try to do anything in regards to alcohol. Instead of treating real crime seriously, they decide to crack down on alcohol related offenses like it will destroy the fabric of their society. Best of luck, but I recommend alternative house parties, or going to Louiseville/Chicago."
Purdue,3dt8fh,twentysomethinger,-9,Sun Jul 19 08:29:47 2015 UTC,"I frequented the bars alot last year and know most bouncers on campus. The difficulty highly differs by sex. Females can get in easily if they just show some form of ID at all. I have seen girls use their roommates ID literally right after their roommate used it. They pass it behind their backs down the line. Even when the girls name is super long and unique like ""Natasha schlemerhorngargler"". These girls think they are being so clever but the bouncers know it's happening but they need all the girls they can get to improve the ratio and they have plausible deniability. So for girls it's easy. If you know bouncers you can get an underage girl in even without ID. Guy on the other hand have to have a good fake or sibblings ID. I suggest also don't come off as a trouble maker. Be sober, quiet, and in a group. If you are drunk, loud, and alone the bouncers will think twice about even wanting you there. You might try to make conversation with the bouncer like; ""what's the ratio like tonight? Better than lastnight?"" ""Any good looking girls in tonight?"" ""Are you a new bouncer? I haven't seen you here before."" ""Are the specials good tonight?"" All these either get them distracted, thinking you have bar experience, and to top that off they get attached somewhat and it makes it harder for them to turn you away. Also buying bottle service can help and finding bars that aren't crowded. At a crowded bar they will get selective about people coming in. On a dead night bouncers will let anyone in with ID real or fake. A good night and they don't even let real ID guys in if they don't have a Purdue ID or aren't with someone that has one or dressed well. I've seen a lot of townys get turned away during peak times. Also anyone looking like trouble gets taken out. My advice is not to try it. Go to frat parties and drink free liquor. Most of the time all you have to do to get into frat parties is know a brother, have a 2 to 1 girl guy ratio, or say you are thinking about rushing but want to see how the parties are first. Some house parties only charge a cover. Also when asked who you know at the party say Alex. There's always an Alex, Zach, Dylan, or Jake. Pick really common names start to generalize and if they still pester you then lie as best you can or tell them to go get someone else to talk to you. Then just avoid them after they leave to get back up. Worst case you get kicked out and then just hang out in the yard. They still bother you then spread word that the cops are coming and the girls get scared and leave. Ruins the party. Pro tip: never pay for a cup at house parties. Instead go to the kitchen. Find a cup that looks like the ones being sold as cover. Wash it at the sink with their dish soap. Then enjoy. I never paid for a cup ever. If the cup seller notices and asks questions just say you bought it off someone else when they were in the bathroom or something. I am not paying 5 bucks for a solo cup to drink jungle juice that cost the host only 2 bucks per gallon to make. Don't know why the downvotes but I go to the bars often and speak from experience. Maybe most of the people on here just downvote because they have no idea what they are talking about? Sure bar owners aren't going to risk their license but they don't work the door. Guys getting paid 10 bucks an hour do and the bartenders earn off tips so they want anyone with money in. That's the truth of it."

Have you taken PHYS 172/272 yet? The astronomy classes you'll have to take for that minor aren't the non-mathematical, observation-based courses either, as your probably aware.

This can be very rewarding if they are offering a class on a topic that interests you. In previous semesters these topics have included the JFK assassination, space exploration, and rock and roll music.  The out-of-class workload usually consists of reading some books and maybe writing a couple of short essays."

That being said, FS 470 wasn't what I would call easy, but it was fun to taste lots of different wines for minimal cost.  Upper level HIST is also great, as has been mentioned already.  I will say that the upper level HIST courses I took often required a longer final paper; somewhere around 10-20 pages.  You can always email a professor and see how much time and writing will be required.    There is also CSR 342, Personal Finance.  Maybe not ""fun"" but useful.  Film and Video Studies (FVS) sometimes has cool courses study specific directors or film styles.    HORT 360 is flower arranging.  You are graded on your arrangements, which can be challenging, but the class is full of girls.  MET 349 is offered sporadically and lets you design and make your own guitar.

And I would like to emphasize that if you do take his class. Do the reading. He'll occasionally take participation by giving you a question from it to answer.   However, I was terrible at keeping up with the reading, but it really didn't hurt me.   Also, there is one big group project. He assigns the groups, and gives you plenty of time to get it completed.   Lastly, if you take notes in class, the study guides are normally taken directly from the PowerPoint.

It really depends what's important to you, though, as well as your price range, in deciding which ownership is for you. Three major omissions if you are talking about the off-campus-but-walking-distance are Cochran, Basham, and Granite. Non-walking distance places you might have forgotten are Willowbrook and The Avenue. If you let us know what factors are most important (proximity, fast/reliable internet, good maintenance, etc.) to you then I'm sure people can comment on the pros and cons of certain places. I have been in Cochran for two years (going on three) and love them."
Purdue,3dgzbe,ChristafuhMoltisanti,2,Thu Jul 16 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Walking-distance isn't so important to me since I have a car, but being close-r to campus would be considered a plus but not something I would consider over higher priority things. I would really just like somewhere with reliable/fast internet (mandatory), relatively responsive maintenance, and ideally somewhere that infestation (cockroaches and mice I've had problems with) hasn't been a huge issue. I forgot about Cochran; I've had a friend who just finished living with them for a year and has said great things. However, living ""just far enough"" but still close to campus would also be great, since I work as a waiter off Creasy and 26."

We have never had problems with internet even though it's Comcast. We legitimately have upwards of 20 devices connected at all times and the speeds are still respectable. Not extremely familiar with mbps, but we have no problem streaming on platforms like HBO GO and Netflix. Maintenance takes care of problems within 48 hours usually, and the system to put in requests online is great. Infestation problems have never crossed my mind. Depending on your budget for rent, it may make more sense to live closer to campus and sacrifice the drive to work because parking on campus every day is a pain. You might look at the southern edge of campus like Williamsburg on the Wabash, Waterfront, or River Market. They are cheaper because of distance but still walkable to campus."
Purdue,3dgzbe,egshef,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend lived at both Beau Jardin and Ashley Oakes and I spent a lot of time with him at both places so I feel like I could give you a bit of info. Both are reasonably well sized for the price and you'll get much more bang for your buck then some other places that are walking distance to campus. If you have a car then they're both fine but if not I would lean towards Beau Jardin since there's a bus stop right outside of the apartment complex. Both are fine if you have a pet, too, which I don't know how important that is to you but it's nice to know if you do have or do want an animal both places are pet friendly.   In terms of living environment I would tend to lean more towards Beau Jardin just because there are more students there where at Ashley Oakes there are a lot of families. I personally don't like kids (and especially) screaming babies so yeah, take that as you will. One plus of Beau Jardin was a liquor store walking distance from the apartments, and both places are close to a multitude of eating establishments. One downside was that Beau Jardin had Frontier as an ISP but I believe they switched to Comcast (not totally sure, though). I don't remember there being huge internet issues at either place, though, and we were gaming pretty frequently. If I was still living in the area I would consider moving to either place since I've had nothing but pretty great experiences (with the exception of one management issue that was solved at Ashley Oakes).   Also, please for the love of God do not move into Parkway. My boyfriend moved in to a bed bug ridden apartment and it's basically a slum. It's a legitimately shitty place to live and the price and size of the apartments do not outweigh how horrible it is to live there."

Cambridge estates used to be pretty rough (mostly drugs & domestic violence) 10 years ago, maybe it's gotten better since then, but it would have had to have improved pretty drastically for me to consider moving there.  I haven't heard good things about Georgetown or Deerfield either, but have No personal knowledge.   I think Ashley Oakes and timber edge are good, although in traffic Ashley Oakes might be one that takes a little while to get to campus."

Southridge commons never seemed that shady to me, but that's a 10 minute drive to campus as well.  cheswick (~10 min drive) or beau jardin (~5 min drive) may be your best bets, as they appear pretty safe, and consist of mainly students. ashley oaks is pretty safe, as well. hawthorne properties is also pretty nice, but even further east of the interstate and a 20 minute drive."

The Neon Cactus is the bar you would probably make the most drives from/to. Especially when it's cold outside. Once enough people know your number and know you are actually a reliable driver, you don't need Uber or whatever.  Do you have a big car (truck) that can transport furniture/other big stuff? Maybe that's also a service you can offer."

Purdue,3dg7zz,njmpark,3,Thu Jul 16 07:42:17 2015 UTC,"On 6/30/2015, After I contacted my professor and selected my courses for next semester, I checked the e-mail address that used to apply Purdue university. I found the another e-mail about selecting courses. At that moment, I only registered three classes. As a transfer student, I lost so many credits. So I was worried about I can not graduate on time.  So I simply asked professor how to other  two select courses. But I forget to write down ""other two "". Then it appears like I repeatedly asked same question on different e-mail address. The professor noticed that, asked me to explain it and call her now. I did not reply. I did not call. I was traveled to Tibet during that time. I was thinking almost everything about my application is done. I could just relax before going to embassy. On 7/8/2015, ISS contacted me about this situation again. And I replied ""Sorry about your confusion. It all results in my false expression. Since I have registered three classes right now, what I really want to know is when I can register another English class. Is the registration still available?"" ISS did not reply any e-mail after that. But Purdue did reply all my questions about tuition, SEVIS transfer information at same time. So I did not realize the storm was coming to me. Without further contact,on 7/13 Purdue informed me taking away my offer. Ironically, it is the same day I got my I-20. I was just about to get the Visa. After that, I made countless phone calls to ISS and my professor. I explained everything to them with my shaking voice. They insisted they gave me a chance and now is too late. What I did is academic fraud. They also questioned who did my ALEKS test(I got 91 on the third time. OMG, These are really large numbers in that test). I sent image of my calculation note and browser history. It did not work. Now, the professor informed me ISS will make a decision tomorrow morning. Even though according to the phone call I made, they will not let me in for my entire life."
Purdue,3dg7zz,hurrdurr24,3,Thu Jul 16 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"There has to be more to this story.  Nothing that you have described is academic fraud.  Offers of admission are not revoked just because you use two emails or don't reply immediately.  If that was the case I would never be able to admit anyone.  I'm not saying you are lying, but I think there must be more to the story.  But, if you truly believe that something against the law has happened, you should contact The Graduate School to ask them about the situation.  Ask to speak with Dr. Tom Atkinson.

Purdue,3dg7zz,mock94,2,Thu Jul 16 02:16:19 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would  (1) Explain to them if your email was hacked or compromised, otherwise that you had 2 emails and you were unsure which one to use. (2) Explain that you did not have constant internet access when you were in Tibet and that meant that you could not reply to their emails promptly. (3) Apologize for using the "" sorry for 'your' confusion "" miscommunication and that you did not mean to be disrespectful. (4) You need to keep insisting that you were the one who took the ALEKS even after you showed them proof that you did it.  Other than that, you need to accept the facts and move on see if the other university that accepted you will take you. I hope everything gets cleared up."

The no initial fees was really convenient for me moving in from 12 hours away which was nice. The apartments are nice, although they are a little on the older side, they kind of felt 70's or so, but they were clean. The place was also pretty quiet overall which was nice. The staff and maintenance were also nice and helpful.  There's a bus stop right across the street which goes straight down to campus which was convenient, and WalMart really close was nice. They are further away from campus and especially the bar scene, if that matters to you, but that distance is part of the reason for the lesser cost. Also, I'm notr sure I agree with your comment of ""Considering how much cheaper this place is compared to every other place around"" once you avoid the places really close to campus, or the specific ""collegey"" places, I think there are a number of other places around the same price.

Purdue,3dasmg,Wubbls,7,Tue Jul 14 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"EE as far as I know has several spaces for elective ECE courses that can be on either end of the spectrum of EE-CompE. CompE, on the other hand, is much less flexible in this regard. It seems that (and hopefully someone corrects me if I'm wrong), you can graduate with an EE degree with a solid background of CompE material (or whatever concentration you care to choose), whereas a CompE degree is pretty much just that. A computer engineering degree.  One more point worth mentioning is that it is much harder (although still feasible) to go from EE to CompE than it is to go from CompE to EE.  I just finished my second year in EE but I'm changing my major to AAE with a minor in EE so take all of this with a grain of salt :)  ECE is a fascinating discipline and Purdue has an amazing ECE department, so whether you choose EE or CompE, I hope you make the more important decision to come to this fantastic school. Boiler Up!"
Purdue,3dasmg,iDooby,2,Tue Jul 14 21:35:21 2015 UTC,"Great response friend, I'm seriously considering attendance so hopefully I'll be admitted hehe. I'm still deciding between aero and elec/comp because I love computers, circuits and the like but also love space and rockets n'shit. You know if its feasible to major in ECE and minor in AAE? If not than I'll probably go with your route of major in AAE and minor in EE or CS. Thanks again friend. Boiler Up!"
Purdue,3dasmg,iDooby,3,Tue Jul 14 22:04:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Purdue does not offer an AAE minor. Once I decided I needed more aerospace in my curriculum, I looked into it and emailed several staff members, but alas, it is not possible to get an AAE minor. It is, however, very possible to get a minor in ECE with an AAE major, and if you are interested in electrical systems, I would highly encourage you to do this! The ECE minor gives you a very solid background in circuitry and the theory behind the most widely used components in industry. As a bonus, ECE 201 counts towards the AAE major as well as the ECE minor.  One thing that I should warn you is that these ECE courses are extremely difficult. They will test your ability to push yourself academically, and throwing these in with an already challenging major like AAE may prove to be very tough. I am most likely extending my graduation date by a semester or two because I'm changing my major so late, but it is still possible to graduate on time. Be ready to put yourself to the test, because Purdue and ECE do not f*** around."

Purdue,3dasmg,rogerrrr,5,Wed Jul 15 04:49:55 2015 UTC,"I'm an EE major. CompE is a subdiscipline of EE that has its own major.   With EE, you have a few required classes, then you're free to take whatever else as an elective, assuming you meet the prereqs of course.   With CompE, you have a very rigid curriculum of programming, computer hardware, and integrated circuits classes. I'm simplifying here, so bear with me. Also, this is on top of a lot of the basic circuits classes that EE kids have to take. All of these classes are available to EE, students, though some are difficult to get to with the vast prereq train for some of the upper level classes. I wanna say you have the choice of about 4 different ECE classes, but don't quote me on the number.   You don't have to worry about this now, unless maybe if you're a transfer student. You don't pick you're department until end of freshman year. You should also decide by then which of the majors you want. It's easier to go from CompE to we than the other way around. There are more requirements early on for CompE majors.   Let me know if you have any more specific questions. I'll do my best to answer."

Regardless of the degree I wanna go into the aero industry. Purdue sounds like a great school and I'm excited to join you guys!"
Purdue,3dasmg,synackrst,2,Tue Jul 14 22:36:03 2015 UTC,"I did the VIP (Vertically Integrated Projects) course in ECE and the professor was a joint AAE/ECE professor. Because of that, the research that he facilitated for us was deeply rooted in both disciplines. It involved developing antennas that would pick up satellite transmissions that have bounced off the ocean waves, and this would allow us to measure how choppy or rough the ocean was. Orbital mechanics, signal noise, power densities, and space losses were all involved. Pretty cool stuff, however we did not get very far during the one semester I did it due to lack of time and experience.  So yes! It is possible to find these areas of interest that cross between the two disciplines. The more you ask relevant staff, the more likely you will be to find these opportunities. Clubs are also a great way to get involved in space design on an electrical level. I plan on joining one called Lunabotics this coming fall."
Purdue,3dasmg,beetlebeatle,2,Tue Jul 14 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to take any classes in the Aero department. Maybe one at the most. But this doesn't mean you can't get involved.   It's more work, but you could join a club that has an Aero project of some sort. If its all AAE kids, then I'm sure they'll love to have someone whose familiar with the electrical side of things. There's also the option of working with a professor, but those can be pretty hard to land.   If you wanna go into Aero, why not just study it? Or do Mechanical with a Aero specialization. You'll probably have an easier time having a job in that specific industry, though it's not impossible with a EE degree either."

Shameless plug for Purdue Solar Racing which is awesome and many alumni end up in automotive or aerospace companies thanks to our sponsors and experience.
Purdue,3dasmg,goo3r,2,Wed Jul 15 01:24:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it's like at the main campus, but I xfered to IUPUI, and we take a number of EE courses, then a number of CS courses. I wouldn't call it a subspecialty of EE because of the number of CS courses.  If you enjoy programming and CS, I would major in CompE. I like the low-level view that CompE provides, and while I plan on pursuing CS in grad school, I have a perspective of what goes on at the machine level that my CS colleagues do not have.  If you're interested in going into Aero, keep in mind that a lot goes into Aero that is not designing wings and bodies. Aero is a very multidisciplinary field. So you can still go into the field having no experience in Aeronautical design, because there are so many other things to work on."
Purdue,3dasmg,CombatTrooper,2,Wed Jul 15 08:57:01 2015 UTC,"major in EE or CE   FYI CE is short for civil engineering, CompE is computer engineering. It's best to not get them mixed up because it will confuse people."

Purdue,3db7gv,RenesisMSP,3,Tue Jul 14 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Cary SW and have lofted before. The loft provides more room (slightly less than 2 beds worth of space) and also provides a free pullup / chinup bar. In my opinion, this extra space is of marginal utility. Even without the loft, you can still probably fit a fridge and a chair and maybe a bit more if you stack your dressers.  I say that the gained space isn't a big deal because Cary SW is small and hot. Most time spent in the rooms will be probably be split between sleeping, homework, and video games / tv. There isn't a huge need for extra space.  That being said, I'm headed back to Cary SW both to live near some friends and because it is the cheapest dorm on campus. My roommate has also spent a year in Cary SW before, but he wants a loft for the extra space. I'm fine with splitting the cost for the loft.  tl dr: In my opinion, it isn't a huge deal. If you want a couch or more chairs in your room, get the loft."
Purdue,3db7gv,bagged_,2,Tue Jul 14 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"Great, this is exactly what I was looking for.  I have one quick question that goes alongside this.  If we're to loft our beds in Cary SW, does only one person have to pay the loft fee?  I know that in other rooms, it's on a per-bed basis, but since it's normally a bunk in Cary SW, I'm guessing that if you pay once, they just split the bunk into two lofted beds?  Thanks for your help!"
Purdue,3db7gv,bagged_,2,Tue Jul 14 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"Correct. There is one fee for the loft. It is up to you and your roommate how you want to pay for it. For my freshman year, I paid for mine, picked it up and assembled it with my family, and then had my roommate pay me back half of it later."
Purdue,3db7gv,trbp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:31 2015 UTC,I lived in Cary SW 3 years ago. One person pays the loft fee.
Purdue,3db7gv,Mxous,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:02:09 2015 UTC,Pretty much a repeat of bagged_. Lofted my first year in Cary SW. I guess it gave us a lot more room but in the end we didn't need it. Neither of us really brought enough stuff to justify it so I recommend keeping that in mind when deciding to spend the money. Also it's a bitch to set up in the summer heat.
Purdue,3db7gv,Spitfirre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:16:22 2015 UTC,"CAUTION: Make sure to check the room you are going in beforehand is large enough!  I was unfortunate to get a squished room in SW. I was the last room at the end of a hall, and it was significantly smaller than the other rooms in our hall. It was basically a single. The ""loft"" we got was not the one I was expecting. Basically we got two sets of bunk beds, just without the bottom bed. It turned out to take up more space than just scrapping the loft.  I cannot remember the room number, but it sucked"
Purdue,3db7gv,bass1025,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Figure I'll give you the flip side opinion since most of the ones here say that the extra space was nice but not that useful. My roommate and I lofted 2 years ago when we were in SW, and it definitely made a world of difference as to how we used our room. We fit a futon under one bed and put a dresser under the other with our TV on it, and another friend on our floor used the same setup. Our hall was very social and close (we still are all living together between 3 apartments now, 2 years later) and spent a TON of time in the 2 lofted rooms, just because there was more space and seating. If you don't plan on using your room for more than homework, sleeping, and keeping to yourself, then if you don't loft you're fine, but I personally think it's worth it if you plan on actually hanging out with friends in your room. Fair warning though, the lofts put your bed VERY close to the ceiling (maybe 3 feet of head room), so fair warning if you're claustrophobic."
Purdue,3db7gv,Ryantist1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"When I lived in Cary SW we built a custom loft for my bed. For my roommates bed, we flipped the brackets on the bunk bed frame to gain some height and also used 4 x 4 posts under that to lift the other one up. We shoved both dressers under his bed and put a couch and fridge under mine. With the desks across from each bed we both had our own personal space to eat sleep, game etc...   Made life living in a Cary closet much better than the bunk bed setup you get by default."

Overall, while the closets are made to sound like a complete and total nightmare, they really aren't bad at all. The rooms get hot, so definitely get a few fans. (I HIGHLY recommend one like this if you can afford one, it moves a ton of air, and is handy for drying if you have issues with the dryers) The nice thing about the heat is that people tend to leave their doors open to create a draft, and generally are pretty sociable and move around, so you'll make a bunch of new friends if you're open to talking to people.

A PhD student I know in Aero came in with a Physics bachelors only and little to no formal engineering education (just a couple extracurricular research experiences). Yes, that person had to play catch up (as will you) but they also managed to keep up just fine. Get on it from the start and you should be fine.  Next, get in touch with Aero Assist, the department's graduate student organization, especially their mentorship program. They can give you a lot of direction and point you to useful resources.  Finally, it sounds like you have a normal case of Impostor Syndrome, feeling like you don't belong or aren't good enough to be here and it's only a matter of time until everyone sees it. A lot of grad students feel this way at first (or even later!). Maybe you'll need time or guidance or something else to move past it, but remember that this is a common feeling and it should pass. Purdue thinks you're good enough to be here and your work will prove it."

Take advantage of the Aero lab on the 2nd floor of Armstrong.  It's always full of both undergrad and grad students working through problems/studying/etc.  Most of the coding we did (at least at the undergrad level) was with MATLAB, so you should be fine in that regard."

Assuming the program isn't aiming for high attrition, trust the admissions committee.  They looked at your application, and from that information decided you are a good fit for the program.  I came into my program under-prepared compared to the rest of my cohort, and I'm still here.  There will probably be uncomfortable moments, and you'll have to work seemingly harder than everyone else (which will be discouraging).  BUT...trust yourself, trust your abilities, and don't be afraid to ask for help from class members and professors.   Starting grad school is terrifying for most people even if they don't show it.  Know that you aren't alone, and try to find someone else in the program to be a study/vent buddy.  It will help the adjustment process immensely.    Again...I know nothing about engineering so my advice may not jive with the environment of the department...but hopefully it does!"

Best common bathrooms too, as they were renovated only recently. Trust me, the ones in other Freshman dorms are not nearly as good. Also in close proximity to Purdue West and three bus stops (two going to campus and one going to Walmart).

We asked why ours is slower and apparently it depends on your proximity to a node or some crap like that. Even though it's not as fast as his, it's pretty close to what I was paying for before so it's still alright. I'm not sure how much congestion there will be in the fall because we still have to set it up through Comcast and have our own modem and router and everything, the company just pays the bill."

You absolutely do not want Frontier, because even though they aren't Comcast(huge +) they sell 6Mbps internet for the same price that Comcast sells 25Mbps. I bought my own modem/router combo, which saves about 8 bucks a month but the router is shit, so save yourself and get both. I can confirm I get 60 down and 10 up.

You'll be doing group projects focussing on engineering economics, coding in python, C, and matlab, robotics, statistics, and physics as well as a few other topics. That being said, engineering is difficult and its harder to get an A at purdue than the other schools you listed, but you shouldnt have a problem. Jobs know this and account for it in hiring (google adds .5 to All purdue GPAs when accessing candidates).  Aspects that arent so great:    Our football team blows  Its the 8th hardest school in the country to get an A (as i said, potential employers know this) Social Scene is largely limitted to greek life. There arent as many house parties as a lot of other schools. That being said greek life is huge at purdue (3rd in the country) so there tends to be a house for everyone who wants to get involved and clubs will also throw parties West lafayette isnt the best college town. Theres decent food options, but there arent enough bars and there isnt a ton to do. We are pretty close to chicago and Indi tho.   I honestly cant think of anything else.

I was like you coming out of high school with awesome grades and what not. Don't take that for granted. My four years at Purdue were some of the most difficult and challenging of my life. My job now is challenging, but Purdue definitely got me ready for it.   People always complained about the lack of things to do and the football team sucking. Engineering will keep you busy and there's enough to do around outside of that. There's lots of clubs and even more awesome people. Also, the quality of the sports team should have no impact on your school decision.  Outside of the Midwest, everyone thinks Purdue is Ivy League, which is really nice."

A couple people tried to convince me to take it easy and just retake calc 1 or 2 to ""facilitate the transition to college"" but fuck that I went right into calc 3 and did fine.

Purdue,3cvk4u,no1herebutuschickens,3,Sat Jul 11 05:09:03 2015 UTC,"Well the right answer would be to make sure you read the book, do the homework, and ask questions to the professor during office hours or to the TA during recitation. If you show interest in their class then they will do everything they can to guide you.  But I only ever did one of those things and only ever really studied for physics 342 (holy hell that class was hard). I didn't study much in my years at Purdue and managed well enough.  And I just remembered another thing. You can almost always find online pdfs of you textbooks for free (sometimes solution manuals as well)."

Purdue,3cvk4u,StopWeirdJokes,2,Mon Jul 13 16:08:15 2015 UTC,"The best answer is to not ""study like hell all night before a test."" While this may work for some, I can guarantee you it will be much less stressful if you adopt a daily study schedule, so that when everyone else is cramming the night before the exam, you can sit down, do a practice test to ensure you've got it, and then laugh while you watch Netflix and everyone else is busy. Get a good night's sleep, and laugh as you walk out of the exam 30 minutes early. At least, that's what I hope to accomplish next semester. Studying the night before didn't work to well for me.

As far as Question #1), here is some info that was certainly not passed along to you during tours:   Winters here BLOW.  You might be used to the weather, but really, is one ever used to the winters?  Find a warm coat; now find a warmer coat. Bring that. There will generally be construction going on throughout your four years that will make you question humanity itself. Weekends will really be boring if you don't take time and effort to go out and meet new people with common or uncommon interests.  This can be done without the use of the Greek system if you choose. Almost every student at Purdue got A's in high school.  Begin to accept C's if you can convince yourself you did your best.  C's - in a lot of instances - are nothing to scoff at. Your freshman roommate might suck.  You might not get along in the slightest - I never did -, but that's okay and a part of the experience.  Stick it out for a year or two, and then get an apartment with your friends. There will be days and weeks in which you want nothing to do with Purdue.  You'll be done with friends, school work, and just life in general.  Don't give up.  Everyone experiences this to varying degrees.  The ones who succeed are the ones who seek out the positive and grasp on to that.   I see you were in Varsity Show Choir.  Check out the Purdue Glee Club.

Purdue,3cvk4u,TiberianRebel,3,Sun Jul 12 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"AAE Sophomore here. Glad you are choosing one of the best colleges in the nation for your degree (or most other engineering majors TBH). Honestly, for a bachelor's degree, it really doesn't matter whether you go to Michigan Tech/UIUC/GA Tech (unless MIT, which is a totally different story). They will all give you an excellent education. That being said, Purdue AAE has consistently been ranked in the top 5-6 colleges for undergrad AAE, so you're making an excellent choice. If this isn't enough, consider that the majority of the workforce at GE Aviation, one of the largest producers of aircraft engines, consists of Purdue grads. This is only one example; pretty much every aero company/government organization will strongly value your Purdue degree. I am currently co-oping at Gulfstream, and there are a lot of Purdue grads there too.   I have to agree, West Lafayette/Lafayette can be dead at times, but this is more than made up for by the awesome community. Not only are you guaranteed to find a group of people who you will like, but also your professors will also be one on one with you (particularly your Aero profs), which is definitely something you will come to value a lot in your later classes.   As for your chances, you are completely fine. I got in with a lower GPA than you, and with about half as many AP's.   One thing to note is you do not get accepted directly into the specific college of your choice; instead, you spend your first year in the First Year Engineering (FYE) program. During these two semesters you complete your pre-requisites like calculus, physics, and chemistry classes (although you can test out if you got 5s or 4s on corresponding APs), as well as two introductory ""engineering"" courses which teach you the fundamentals of engineering thought processes and MATLAB.   After FYE, you list your top 3 college of engineering choices, and as long as you have a GPA above a 2.8 (preferrably over a 3.0), you will most likely get in.   If you have any questions/want general advice, feel free to PM me!"
Purdue,3cvk4u,Mseeeee,3,Sat Jul 11 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"This all sounds awesome. I'm happy to know that the aero professors are supportive. I'm excited that my chances are alright, and now I'm even more excited to apply. I don't have specific questions now, but I may PM a few your way in the next few months. Thanks!"
Purdue,3cvk4u,avngr,5,Sat Jul 11 04:29:50 2015 UTC,"Like the other answer, I am also only just starting in Fall, but I can attempt to answer the 2nd question and just provide a few more details.  1.) As you saw, the campus itself is quite beautiful. I really appreciate the architecture of (most) of the buildings and they seem to do a decent job of making everything look pretty. The surrounding area is relatively simple: To the north, east, and south of campus there are some non-university West Lafayatte buildings before you hit suburbs, but the campus is basically all of WL besides the village area to the East and another concentration of businesses to the north-east. It all basically feels the same though, and in my mind it seems like there is a decent selection of cool places to eat and hang out, etc. Much, much more than a smaller school could offer, but considerably less than a school that's in a larger city. Across the river, there doesn't seem to be anything too interesting going on besides some more bistros and coffee shops, but exploring the Lafayette side of town may interest you for a little bit. Overall, it seems like the area would be able to keep your interest, but after 4 years you may be tired of whatever local scene you discover. I guess it boils down to how you feel about location, some prefer their massive public schools in big cities (OSU, kinda Michigan) and some like them out in the middle of nowhere (IU!). I'd say Purdue, as well as schools like UIUC, kinda make their own towns feel like small cities, and not like suburban towns.  2.) As far as rankings for Mechanical Engineering goes, I know Purdue is very, very well regarded. I'd rank the 5 best Engineering schools in the Big 10 as so:  1.UIUC 2.Purdue/Michigan 3.Northwestern 4.Wisconsin  I really don't know enough to try and give a solid ME-specific rating to those schools ranked as #2 though, as far as I can tell and have heard, they're both great. An aerospace ranking list would basically only feature Purdue though, I am very much convinced that it is better than any other Big 10 school.  3.)I would say you have a very strong chance of getting into both the University and Honors College. Keep in mind, Purdue has a reputation of being a very easy place to get into, but a very hard place to graduate from. Your GPA, ACT, and extra curriculars are really strong. I don't think Purdue will have any aversion to accepting another white male either, so don't worry there. As far as aerospace and ME go, they're very very competitive programs, but I think you're in just fine. Any AP classes that you have credit for that apply to either of these majors would make you look good, so that should help. I had friends get turned down from ME and a few other ENGR majors with great GPA's and solid scores, but that could have been just the luck of the draw for them, and I doubt they had much more than 32 on the ACT, so don't worry! You should get into whichever you pick just fine.   Edit: Clarification and me fixing my time-specific opening, which no longer applied upon me hitting ""save"""
Purdue,3cvk4u,UDK450,2,Sat Jul 11 04:24:11 2015 UTC,"There is a great selection of more artsy/interesting bars and restaurants on downtown Lafayette. Definitely worth checking out! Regular festivals and a lot of live music of all genres, too."

I visited UIUC and felt that Purdue felt better to me. I got the feeling that I was at the epicenter of Midwestern aero engineering at Purdue with alumni including so many astronauts and Amelia Earhart. As of now, I think that Purdue is the best fit for me. I'm excited for my chances at Honors and the challenge that comes with it."
Purdue,3cvk4u,Nob1816,3,Sat Jul 11 04:46:53 2015 UTC,"You're definitely at the right place. Purdue might not be the top engineering school overall, but when if you're talking about aero, no one - especially in the big 10 - compares. Don't forget Purdue just announced plans for a huge 980-acre aerospace tech park that rolls Royce is already looking at investing in. Others are sure to follow. With that, like 23 nasa astronauts who were grads and Amelia Earharts connection, I don't think there's a better place."
Purdue,3cvk4u,no1herebutuschickens,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:41:13 2015 UTC,I didn't know about the tech park at all! I'll definitely look into it. There's just one more reason to apply.

Purdue,3cvk4u,UDK450,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"Yes! As far as Aero Engineering goes you seriously cannot top it, I wouldn't value another program above Purdue, the cost is fair and if you feel like you fit on campus that's an even bigger upside.   I've lived in an even smaller town (literally 400 people or so within limits) but I would commute to Indianapolis for HS, so Purdue feels like a great balance between the two for me and I also really feel a good fit on campus. I checked out about 8 different Campuses around the U.S. and Purdue felt the most like a place I could call home, I didn't even feel any imposter syndrome during orientation haha. Boiler Up!"
Purdue,3cvk4u,getonmyhype,2,Sat Jul 11 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Purdue has just felt the best for me so far. That's a huge draw to the university, but the fact the the aerospace program is top-notch only makes it a better fit."
Purdue,3cvk4u,UDK450,3,Sat Jul 11 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"Going to buck the trend a bit with regard to the honors programs. The Honors College is a joke if you're an engineer (Unless they've changed it in the last year or two); the honors courses selections are usually bizarre and often esoteric in topic and won't count for anything in engineering other than uncategorized credit. In theory, you can get honors contracts, but in ECE, I couldn't find a single professor in my first 3 semesters who would do one (and the courses were hard enough by themselves). That said, do the Honors College because you get priority registration, which is truly a blessing. I took maybe 6 credits worth of honors courses, but still had priority registration the entire time; it's clutch when it comes to avoiding bad professors and not having to haul your ass across campus to sit through Com114 at 730 on a Monday morning.  In a similar vein, all the students I know who did honors first-year engineering were miserable. That's not to say the regular FYE is any better, but  I would argue it's mildly less frustrating. If they still have you programming the robots, I'd probably go regular."
Purdue,3cvk4u,TheBen1818,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I will look into the honors program more to make sure it is worth it for me. With all these positive reviews, it's good to here another opinion."
Purdue,3cvk4u,getonmyhype,2,Sat Jul 11 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with this—definitely see if you can ask around with the honors college. I, like you, had very high grades and a lot of APs but I decided to not do honors. All of the professors wanted me to go honors, but all the former students I talked to said it was kinda crazy and past your first year, there don’t seem to be any straight-up honors courses. I believe you usually do something extra for the class to make it honors, but again I’m not in the program so I’m not totally sure. The regular FYE classes are still pretty challenging and focus on programming with MATLAB which was totally new to me. As of 3 years ago, honors was still building robots and they became the bane of everyone’s existence in those classes. The priority registration is definitely a perk, but I came in with so many AP credits, dual credits, and also some test-out credits that I was pretty far ahead already and never had issues with registration or picking dorms. I will recommend that if you are currently taking some sort of language (especially Spanish) take the test-out exam for it during registration because you can snag free college credits. I got 12 hours of German right off the bat and most of the people who did Spanish got at least 6 which helps knock out gen eds. Armstrong is my home base as a materials engineer and it’s hands down my favorite building on campus. It’s kind of sad because if you’re not aero or materials, you don’t really do much with Armstrong after your first year so you lucked out there. Pm me if you have any questions about the other side of the honors fence here but know that no matter what, you are going to work hard and have a blast!"
Purdue,3cvk4u,throwawaymvq1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'll weigh my existing college credits against the benefits of Honors to make my decision. I have taken 4 years of Spanish (1 year AP), so I will also look into credits there. Unfortunately, I am not signed up for a second year of AP, so the information will not be fresh by next year. While the priority scheduling may be only slightly helpful, one of my main draws to Honors is the brand new dorm that is opening Fall 2016. I'll really look into the pros and cons before making any decisions. I can tell that Armstrong is wonderful. I am excited to hear that my work will be centered there. I'll keep your username around for the future in case I have questions. Thanks!"

Purdue,3cvimh,GreekTuMe,3,Sat Jul 11 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"Hi there, welcome to Purdue. I was an RA in Wiley for two years (just graduated), so I can give you my opinion. Owen is the hall that has (by far) the most incidents reported (alcohol and drugs, mostly), and I believe also the most 911 calls for alcohol transport.   Okay, enough statistics.   That being said, this is mostly due to its proximity to sororities right next to it. It's right next to Ford dining court, so getting to food quickly is always nice (although Ford can get kind of boring since most of the food is fried). It's laid out the same way as Tark and Wiley, two wings split with approximately 400 residents each. Tark is all guys and is across the street from you, and Wiley is connected to that which is half girls, half guys.   Owen is in a great location, campus-wise. If you workout, you are about a 3 or 4 minute walk from the co-rec. The three res halls I mentioned are also the three halls closest to campus, in general. It is mostly a first-year dorm, and most people tend to move either out or to Wiley / Tark for their further years (because of their proximity to campus, gym and Wiley Dining Court).   You'll have fun, I promise. If your RA sucks, I'm sorry. It happens."

Purdue,3cvimh,BornTradition,4,Mon Jul 13 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"Owen is just like Tark and Wiley in terms of layout. I personally enjoyed its proximity to ARMS. I believe that the public spaces in Owen were recently renovated because it has a ""newer"" vibe compared to the other two. A box fan is a must the first few weeks, but temperatures become manageable quite quickly. The Walmart by Purdue always has a ton of fans the first few weeks if you don't want to pack one.  I don't really understand how people can say if a dorm is social or not, because I believe that that's a function of the residents of the dorm, who are always changing.  That being said, if you want to be social go to the common area, keep your door open, seek people out. If that's not your thing, then people will let you keep to yourself."

If you've ever even had a thought about rushing a fraternity/sorority, owen hall is the place to do it from.   The busby (basement) is a dope place to both study all night and go to after a night of drinking to chill out.   I lived there last year and it was by far the dorm with the best dudes and best girls on both sides.   Owen hall is easily the best if you use it that way.   It's also right by krach which is a dope study building too, close enough to wiley that it's not a hassle and of course right next to ford."
Purdue,3cvimh,macaronimaniaa9,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:39:21 2015 UTC,It's kinda just meh. Set up like wiley and tark but still slightly fancier than the two? Lesser than earhart and Shreve.

Purdue,3cv3fm,zerr69,5,Sat Jul 11 00:46:52 2015 UTC,"I roomed in Cary my freshman and sophomore year. There's no AC, but that stops mattering after the first month of classes (bring a box fan anyway). The rooms are small and crowded. I'd recommend raising your beds for more room (you'll see what I mean when you get there). It's a sausagefest, but it's not bad. You're also very close to campus. As for dining courts, you have Ford being the closest, but if you want better quality, go to Wiley which is slightly further. You also have Cary Knight Spot Grill which is amazing imo.   Have fun! It's certainly not everyone's taste but I liked it well enough."
Purdue,3cv3fm,Beanz122,2,Sat Jul 11 00:58:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely have lofted beds! Thank you!"

Purdue,3cv3fm,DweebsUnited,2,Mon Jul 13 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"You're right across the street from Ford, the standalone dining court. You also have Knight spot grill in the basement, but you have to use dining dollars there. Both good options.   Also its called Cary closets, but I've only lived in Tark, so I can't say much about the rooms there."
Purdue,3cv3fm,HighCurrent,2,Sat Jul 11 00:57:45 2015 UTC,Rooms are extremely tiny.  Like so tiny you will walk in and wonder how the hell 2 people are going to fit in it.  You'll manage though.  Make sure to get a loft because that will allow you to get a futon or something in there.  No AC which sucks for the first month or two.  Keep your door open to meet new people on your floor.  All residents in Cary are automatically apart of the Cary club which throws some random events in the quad throughout the year.  I'd go to them they are usually fun.  The quad is also a nice place to throw a frisbee or something.  I don't know how much dining has changed but when I was there the Cary Knight Spot had some pretty good sandwiches you can use your dining dollars on.  Ford dinning hall is right across the street so you'll probably use that a lot in the winter.  It has ok food.  Wiley has better food but it's a bit further.  When I was there it also had absolutely no seating so you had to get there early.  It is also right next to the football stadium so have fun getting woken up by that damn train every Saturday morning during football season.  Also don't be a cunt and pull the fire alarm unless there's a fire.
Purdue,3cv3fm,preprandial,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"I worked in Cary and it's pretty nice. It definitely has more of a community feel than some of the other dorms, plus it's the closest one to campus (unless you make Hawkins count). The rooms are definitely the smallest of most of the dorms on campus, but that's really not a big deal.       Cary doesn't have AC, but that doesn't matter. I lived in Harrison freshman year and barely used my AC at all. You'll make out fine with a fan and the windows, at least until late September.        You're right by ford, and it's a pretty nice dining court (I preferred it over Earhart and hillenbrand). Knight spot is also right inside, which also has some good food (I'd say it's a bit better than the dining halls)."

Purdue,3cpnp5,RuskiUS,4,Thu Jul 9 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"No problem. I'm sure they did. But still: 50 bikes divided among 13 stations means there won't be a ton of bikes at any one place. But as demand grows (which I'm sure it will), they could probably easily add more bikes to the fleet."

I bet lots of people will ride downhill to class and ride the bus back to their car. I know lots of people in my department in Arms ride their bikes down to DLR. This looks like it might work pretty well for them.
Purdue,3cpnp5,saintsagan,2,Fri Jul 10 03:57:27 2015 UTC,Anyone else give a com 114 speech about implementing this?
Purdue,3cpnp5,pryan12,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:52:34 2015 UTC,Mine was about increased bike infrastructure in 2001.
Purdue,3cpnp5,Nob1816,3,Tue Jul 14 22:48:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see why we need a bike share for campus. Buying an old bike that will get you from point A to point B is cheap enough as it is. They really should be investing that money in better bike infrastructure like separated lanes.   Or, that's what I was going to say, but after looking into the article a bit more, I have a few different comments. $25 for a yearly membership is definitely less than the cost of owning and regular upkeep of a bike. I get that additional costs after the yearly membership are necessary to keep bikes cycling through users and being returned to the station, but 3 hours is just barely enough to get through a solid block of classes that you have to get to and from without being able to return the bike. They probably took that into account, though. M-F would probably be the times that this gets the most traffic, assuming people use it."
Purdue,3cpnp5,pryan12,9,Thu Jul 9 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"3 hours is just barely enough to get through a solid block of classes that you have to get to and from without being able to return the bike.   If my understanding of bike shares is correct, this wouldn't be a problem since you would just put the bike in the station before the class block started (restarting your 3 hour window). Or am I misinterpreting what you are saying?"
Purdue,3cpnp5,WiF1,4,Thu Jul 9 23:00:46 2015 UTC,"If the stations are easily accessible, yeah you just return it and restart your window. The worst case scenario is having 10 minutes to get across campus for classes (when a lot of people would use a bike), and the station is too far from your class building to return the bike and make it to class in time. It looks like they've got a good spread of stations all over heavily trafficked areas on campus, but there are a few buildings where I could see this happening."
Purdue,3cpnp5,stickyrickysanty,3,Thu Jul 9 23:10:14 2015 UTC,"50 bikes spread out across 13 stations for ~30,000 undergrads (alone) seems meager."
Purdue,3cpnp5,cracked-cardinal,5,Fri Jul 10 06:42:51 2015 UTC,Gotta start somewhere.
Purdue,3cpnp5,stuntman_rod,2,Fri Jul 10 10:26:43 2015 UTC,"Meager maybe, but why invest in a huge venture if you don't know how it will go. Also, take around the the people who already have bikes, longboard, or just do not want to ride bikes, it's fairly manageable. I'm really hoping that this will cause a mutual respect between bikers and non biking students to respect the rules in place. I.E. Bike paths and riding on the street."
Purdue,3cpnp5,pryan12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:24:11 2015 UTC,"One thing not mentioned in the story: Zagster is a ""turnkey"" solution. That means they service all the bikes and even provide 24/7 customer service for the $25 membership fees. So you don't have to worry about your brakes failing or your chain rusting. My guess is upkeep could cost roughly $25 a year, if not more, for your own bike. Also, Purdue hopes after a year the program can survive on its own solely through memberships. Right now, its being launched with a $75,000 grant."
Purdue,3crc8t,reillyr,4,Fri Jul 10 03:47:08 2015 UTC,"Are you an Employee? If not, you won't have access to exchange services. If you're a student using MyMail this might be what you're looking for."

Purdue,3crc8t,Duck_Napkins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't need to do anything with exchange.   Just open up your outlook account settings, and add the correct information. You can find that here"
Purdue,3crc8t,pancake117,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:36:56 2015 UTC,I found the settings that work. Here is how to do it. You set it up with the pop or imap settings. Then after the first image choose more settings for the next set settings.
Purdue,3clndb,sporterjc,9,Wed Jul 8 21:38:07 2015 UTC,Wait they actually robbed someone at gunpoint and then tried to use the credit cards they stole an hour later?  To order fucking pizza delivery? Like when they have to give them their address?  http://replygif.net/i/775.gif

Purdue,3cr8ia,the_future_engineer,7,Fri Jul 10 03:15:28 2015 UTC,huh?  ETA: effective communication is the most effective skill you can have/build as an engineer.  The ability to take responsibility for your work is probably the 2nd most important.
Purdue,3cr8ia,bunnysuitman,8,Fri Jul 10 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"No clue what apcs and apush stand for but your grades seem pretty normal for a Purdue admit.   Just a side note, you probably shouldn't blame your grades on your teacher."

Purdue,3cr8ia,StopWeirdJokes,7,Sat Jul 11 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"As someone who deals with my own issues, just be careful with the whole depression thing. It doesn't just go away and Purdue can definitely take a toll on your mental health.  I would be cautious, period.   We do have services for that through CAPS."
Purdue,3cr8ia,macaronimaniaa9,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"Also, CAPS counseling is free for several sessions. So if you're not sure you can try it without worrying about the cost and see how it goes.   College is really stressful. Definitely take advantage of the resources your college offers, even if its not Purdue."

Purdue,3cr8ia,Beanz122,5,Fri Jul 10 10:00:45 2015 UTC,It probably helped that Purdue isn't hard to get into at all. Friends in my graduating class who took like one AP max still got accepted into Purdue.

It'll be a good time!"
Purdue,3cgupa,WiF1,6,Tue Jul 7 20:24:28 2015 UTC,If you have a residence hall permit you can leave it in residence hall spots over break without a problem.
Purdue,3cgupa,theferriswheel,4,Tue Jul 7 21:55:05 2015 UTC,This- parking in the residence hall garage will likely be your best bet. It'll also keep your car out of any snow and away from the plows/bad drivers.
Purdue,3cgupa,therealsutano,2,Wed Jul 8 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. Parking is relaxed during Christmas break which means that you don't need a permit to park at residence halls during that time."

Spots start opening towards the end of finals week when students go home for break.  I've had plenty of friends do this in the past."
Purdue,3cgupa,beechnutsanctions,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:32:02 2015 UTC,The West Lafayette police are fine with students just leaving their cars there for three weeks?
Purdue,3cgupa,nerdyloser12,2,Tue Jul 7 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"I think West Lafayette technically has a 24 hour limit, but I know plenty of people who've done that before with no trouble."
Purdue,3cgupa,StressOverStrain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"Those two streets are generally unrestricted in time, but Purdue/W Lafayette has been changing some things around so make sure to check.   All the cars on Russell were ticketed/towed a couple times last year for snow removal so I would not recommend parking there."
Purdue,3cgupa,salarkin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:11:17 2015 UTC,"Cities usually have limits on how long you can park a car on the street without moving it, though. Could be as little as 48 hours. Not sure what the local ordinances are or if they're even enforced, but something to be aware of."
Purdue,3cgupa,salarkin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"Do you have a friend in a fraternity, sorority or co-op that has a space designated for them? See if any of them will let you park in their spot for the length of break. I would have let my friend do that back when I was on campus."

Purdue,3cfnc3,TheHaven94,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:08:33 2015 UTC,BGRi is Boiler Gold Rush International. It is a program designed for international students to help them get acclimated to campus before BGR. It happens a few days before BGR.
Purdue,3cfnc3,dferrari7,2,Wed Jul 8 17:39:50 2015 UTC,Just got a an email from the bursar office saying it is due July 13th
Purdue,3ccgdi,sargunster,4,Mon Jul 6 20:51:08 2015 UTC,Have you tried emailing the appropriate offices? That would be a heck of a lot easier than reverse engineering the API.
Purdue,3ccgdi,WiF1,2,Mon Jul 6 21:08:07 2015 UTC,Which offices do you suggest contacting? Just the Housing and Food Services office?
Purdue,3ccgdi,WiF1,3,Mon Jul 6 21:17:20 2015 UTC,Yes. They'll likely just forward your inquiry to the actual office that can handle your request for info.
Purdue,3ccgdi,greenelfs,2,Mon Jul 6 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"I think the ones you have listed are the only ones available right now. I was working on an app that used the v2 API last summer, and it was abruptly scratched. Looks like it is back for good now."
Purdue,3ccgdi,vestige,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, those aren't the only ones available. I just found two new API operations:  http://api.hfs.purdue.edu/menus/v2/items/{item-id} http://api.hfs.purdue.edu/menus/v2/items/{item-id}/schedule  I'll add them to the doc.  EDIT: and now three more:  http://api.hfs.purdue.edu/menus/v2/items/searchUpcoming/{search-terms} http://api.hfs.purdue.edu/menus/v2/file/{file-id} http://api.hfs.purdue.edu/menus/v2/favorites  I don't know how to authenticate for the last one though."
Purdue,3ccgdi,vestige,2,Mon Jul 6 22:48:48 2015 UTC,I wrote v1 of the menus API service back when I worked for Purdue. Glad to see they continued to update and extend it.
