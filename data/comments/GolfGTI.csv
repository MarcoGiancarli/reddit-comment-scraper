GolfGTI,3e50e3,rajavoce,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:08:11 2015 UTC,For tire rotations they don't unmount the tires ..they literally just switch the wheels usually front to back and back to front for fwd car.

In the mk6/5 (and I assume 7s as well), the emblem just pops off (need something flat and rigid to pry it off).  Note that it is held on by a ton of clips, so removing the VW and not filling in the holes would look really weird.  Also note that the VW emblem makes it flush, so you would have some indent if the emblem is not there.  http://i637.photobucket.com/albums/uu100/Dponce88/P1010119.jpg  You can buy cheap replacement emblems from eBay or china and paint them as you wish (mine was around $10) or OEM for around $50 (I think, its been a while since I looked)  Edit:  I think I remember someone on some forums making custom ones (although it may have been for the front only)"

So whenever you go around a turn the lights move with your vehicle so ""no area goes unlit.""   As far as the sunroof goes, I love it as well. Not only does it provide more ventilation and airflow when it's hot as balls out, but I think it makes the car look sharper from a visual standpoint (again, my opinion). The navigation isn't a necessity for me either, but I think of it this way. If I'm just cruising around and come to a road I've never been on, I always turn the navigation on just to see when sharp turns come up, etc. It's actually pretty useful. I've only ever used the GPS itself once when I first bought the car. If I need to get somewhere I've never been before I usually just use my phone.  Hope this helps!"
GolfGTI,3dymia,PM_ME_YOUR_TRADRACK,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:09 2015 UTC,One thing to consider is the head unit will be waaay nicer in the new car.

I am not a fan of vw and their infotainment features. We get much less for the $$ compared to others. The back up camera display on mk7 looks like it's taken from 2005."

GolfGTI,3dv0kf,CrunchyBones,2,Sun Jul 19 23:04:46 2015 UTC,They are software updates for your ecu.  Stage one is just a tune.  Stage two is a tune and a 3 inch down pipe maybe a new cold air intake.  Stage one is the most bang for your buck.  Start there.
GolfGTI,3dv0kf,DoDus1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:28:05 2015 UTC,true... i think I learned a little bit. Apparantly APR KO3/KO4 is widely used for an upgraded turbocharger kit. Any thoughts on those?
GolfGTI,3dv0kf,Rellikx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"What's your intended usage for your gti? Unless are planning to track you ride a few times a month, there better uses for your money then the k04 swap. Go with an APR ECU tuning, a stage 2 CAI, and a 3 in downpipe and ecs tuning diverted upgrade. Go apr because they don't charge to upgrade your tune maps. I used to tell my clients when I did their car drive it for awhile if it's not what u want we can add. But once youu bolt on you can't return it."
GolfGTI,3dv0kf,DoDus1,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:08 2015 UTC,Go apr because they don't charge to upgrade your tune maps   Isn't that only if you buy their extremely overpriced DP?
GolfGTI,3dv0kf,bobglaub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:23:11 2015 UTC,APR is mid range there are quite  few more expensive down pipes on the market.

GolfGTI,3dv0kf,sbujrb,3,Mon Jul 20 04:18:38 2015 UTC,"Your gti already has a turbo. Start small. Stage 1. If you want more, down pipe and stage 2 and intake it. If you still want more, look into the k04. The tunes will be free from APR if you go that route. Most do.   It's called stage 1 because it is literally, your first stage in tuning. Stage 2 is a step up. They all work together. Stage 3 builds on stages 1 and 2. You won't need to undo anything you've already done."

GolfGTI,3dv0kf,doyouevenglass,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:41:20 2015 UTC,"An stage 1 ECU tune plus CAI adds about 70hp on the GTI. 3 in downpipe reduces back pressure on the turbo, giving it a faster spool. Once you drive the car in this stage, you may feel that a turbo upgrade is unnecessary for your purposes. I personally don't suggest turbo upgrades on a dd. VW put a very conservative tune on the GTI. Stage 1 work unleashes alot of power.  The Apr k04 kit is normally $2800 and to me that's alot of money wasted if you get to unleash the full powere on a regular basis."

Both on the door skin, and in the hinge area.   Finally got the rear hatch submitted but never heard back if they approved it. I sold the car partly because I was tired of dealing with the rust.  Generally speaking, Snicker has it right. You go to the dealer, they take photos and then submit the claim. Can take a couple of months. They'll take your car to their body shop to get it replaced (depends on your dealer) and you will not get a loaner while its in the shop.  Good luck, hope you get it all fixed up under warranty!"

Yes there some some random luck of the draw issues but that's like any car.   I love the audio system. Fender is a great brand and it sounds really nice. Volume half way up is loud but still clear quality.   To me, the lighting package is not an option, it's mandatory. The better lights, adaptive lighting, and what I feel is a more aggressive look makes it a no brainer, especially for only 1000 bucks.   I have the 4 door autobahn with lighting and paid just over 32 out the door.   As far as 2 vs 4 door, it's a matter of preference. The consensus seems to be if you have a family four door is best, if you don't two door is. I don't have a family but I like the accessibility of four doors for when I go shopping for groceries and such."

I got out the door for 27,899 total.. including taxes, registration, etc. I went through USAA so I got a super decent price.. and I haggled for 2 hours to get it even lower. :)  I've had no mechanical issues or anything. I really, really love it.  Good luck!!"

My wifes chickenhead friends were riding back there tonight and were commenting on how much room there is for activities back there. Seriously. Head to a dealership and sit in the back of one. You will probably be pretty surprised.
GolfGTI,3dsg04,Turtlegalore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"It's a first year car so of course it's going to have some issues but that is what the warranty is for.   I think the fender audio isn't really necessary, the base radio set up properly sounds good, it lacks low end, but you can add a subwoofer and amplifier which will fill that in while turning the bass off from the door speakers for even more midrange clarity.   A friend of mine actually put in an 8 inch 250 watt powered subwoofer made by JL audio it takes up very little space and sounds excellent it was not cheap at around 500 dollars installed but well worth it.   The lighting package I think is worth it. Halogens in this day don't really cut it for me, and the drl's and led tails are sharp looking."

I've seen a thread of a lot of people on VWV complaining about the 2-door not having enough door stops. Like there's barely open (not enough to get out) and way too open, hit the car next to you."
GolfGTI,3dsg04,derekson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:11 2015 UTC,"This is sort of true.  There's one stop that's enough room to get out, but not much more, then after that it keeps going until it's nearly 90 degrees open.  Still glad I went 2 door.  My rationale was that it looks better (slightly), is lighter (slightly), and is cheaper (slightly).  To be clear, all 3 are small differences against the 4 door, but they added up to enough for me."
GolfGTI,3dsg04,jt2893,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:13:05 2015 UTC,"4k miles on my 2015 se, no problems so far. The Fender sound system is incredible. Very adjustable to your personal preferences and very clear. I only turn it up half to 3/4 of its max volume, which is very loud, and I have yet to hear any distortion. Lighting package os 100% worth the price. I paid 28,600 for an se 4 door with performance and lighting packages. I prefer 4 door but that's a personal issue. I have a kid so I need space for her car seat. 4 door was the better option for me."
GolfGTI,3dsg04,nerdpox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:20 2015 UTC,I agree with all of the comments but if you get the LP package you can ONLY use LP headlights. No aftermarket sets because of the ecu. Now the LP headlights look great but you can get better looking more functional higher quality headlights called eds reps. They have 4 led U shaped lights instead of just 2. And they also include hid's and cornering lights as well. I love my 2015 and wish I could afford the nice lights but I could only afford a cheap s model with no LP or pp
GolfGTI,3dsg04,GonzoMadness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:22:51 2015 UTC,very good point on the headlights. i think if you were doing s with performance package and aftermarket lights is the way to go.
GolfGTI,3dsg04,nerdpox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:02 2015 UTC,The aftermarket headlights don't include the adaptive lighting feature that turns the lights when you corner. I'll take that (and the increased resale value that comes with OEM Lighting Package) over an inner U that lights up as a DRL.
GolfGTI,3dsg04,GonzoMadness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:33:39 2015 UTC,It does have a cornering light that acts in the same manner from what I understand on his site
GolfGTI,3dsg04,nerdpox,2,Mon Jul 20 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"What you're referring to is a static cornering light, also known as the same thing my 1991 Cadillac Sedan DeVille had: a light that flicks on when you have the headlights on and use a turn signal.

Generally for this platform, APR's stage terminology is fairly similar to other companies and even other platforms.   Stage 1 for turbo cars usually means a tune and maybe an intake. Stage 2 usually means an intake and upgraded exhaust components (like downpipe or just header-back exhaust). Stage 3 is probably all bolt ons that can help a turbo car. Of course there may be some mix and match here and there.   Now if you have parts from different companies, you would just say the stage based on what mods you have done and most people will get an idea of where you're at. You can always clarify if need be"

The scenario seems to be when it's warm and I have my windows down / sunroof open / AC off as I leave work, then try to close windows & sunroof and turn on AC when I get on the highway. The AC blows hot air instead of cold, even when set to Max AC.  The other 99% of the time the AC works fine, so I suspect it's some weird software thing rather than a mechanical problem.

Here is the really odd part, if you then turned off the Ac button, but left the thermostat to cold and fan on, the Ac would stay engaged for 15-20 minutes before it turned off and blew ambient temperature air as it should.  As long as I left the Ac on I was good.  It took a couple trips to the dealer to convince them that the problem existed (I also had to learn the pattern to be able to reproduce the issue).

I got the code again a month ago at 65k miles. I had a scan tool this time. I reset the code and hoped it was a fluke. Nope, a week later it was back. I fished out my intake manifold warranty extension letter and made an appointment with a closer dealership. They covered it but recommended a carbon buildup removal for $300ish while they had it open.

GolfGTI,3dnj6h,Franklyimfrank,12,Fri Jul 17 18:41:25 2015 UTC,We did a video all about the warranty issues link below.  In regards to longevity as mentioned the clutch could be an issue but otherwise its unlikely you'll experience any other issues.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJN7p4sUo1U
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,DeutscheAutoParts,5,Fri Jul 17 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"OP, you're not going to get a better response than this."
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,danw650,7,Fri Jul 17 22:05:04 2015 UTC,If you have a manual transmission you may have to replace and/or upgrade your clutch to keep it from slipping.  Other parts may wear out more quickly than they would with stock power.  Not all dealerships are mod-friendly re: warranty work.
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,jabatasu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:45 2015 UTC,What's required to replace or upgrade the clutch? How expensive is that? Is it only required if you experience slipping after the mod or is it generally recommended for any modding on manual GTIs?
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,obstreperouspear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:47:28 2015 UTC,"My ride is still completely stock but from what I've read, it's better to see if your stock clutch can handle it before you bother replacing or upgrading it. Some stock clutches are stronger than others.  You can either replace just the clutch disc or the entire clutch (including pressure plate, etc.) Many people say that replacing the clutch disc only is sufficient while others say the stock pressure plate is a weak link as well.   There are downsides to upgraded clutches versus stock, like increased clutch chatter (noise at idle) and a change in the engagement point and feel that some might not enjoy.   If you just replace the disc, it would probably run about $1k (including labor) and if you replace the whole clutch more like $2k."
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,jabatasu,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:08 2015 UTC,I'd like to thank everyone for any information given. I will be doing stage 1 in September(waiter/bartender in Vegas summer is the slow time) and getting some better tires. Anyone have a recommendations for better tires?
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,cjbt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:57:19 2015 UTC,something sticky. Michelin pilot supersports are tires that people would recommend. There are others out there though.

GolfGTI,3dnj6h,ILoveToEatLobster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"PSS's are nice, but probably a bit overkill unless you're running canyons and switchbacks or tracking the car. I ended up getting Bridgestone RE760s for just over $700 for the set with install, balancing, disposal, and road hazard warranty. Only downside is no mileage-warranty, but I've never bothered pursing one as it's a pain in the ass and requires you to go down to the wear-bars, which I don't feel is very safe."
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,Freesmackies,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"If you have a manual the downside is this will most likely cause your clutch to slip.  For some it's immediate, some its eventual and some are still going 40k miles after the tune.  DSG does not have this problem.  You will run into warranty issues.  This is a big white area though, the dealership will have to prove the tune directly caused the issue you are trying to have warrantied.  Pretty much any place you go to will reset the ECU to stock, but dealerships can also look at boost logs to see that you've been tuned so.... there's that."
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,thesausageprince,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"The only thing I am currently worried about is what revision I have on the turbo in my MkVII, as I know they've been replaced a few times and I don't want to tune one that has a higher rate of failure and be stuck footing the bill for that."
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,Freesmackies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:13:14 2015 UTC,Shouldn't they be replacing that for you free of charge? It's a recall right?
GolfGTI,3dnj6h,cipher021,2,Sat Jul 18 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"I would assume yes, but the way people make it sound is that once you are tuned vw will blame all failures on the tune, putting anything covered under warranty outside of that coverage. I'm probably being over paranoid though."

Also, depending on what model you have, stage 2 tends to be at the limit of the stock clutch, causing it to slip (on mk6 and mk7 platforms. Idk if mk5 and earlier have the same weak clutch issues)"

I'm looking at my local classifieds right now and the 2012-2014 GTI's are all going for about $21k-$29k CDN with approximately the same mileage. So, again, I feel like that's a pretty reasonable price. Hope that helps.  As for my input on the car itself -- a Mk6 GTI is loads of fun to drive whether you get the DSG or the 6-speed manual versions. They're super peppy, very responsive and look damn good even when they're bone stock. You can't get a much better car for the price they are.

That's where websites like KBB, TrueCar, etc. and personal maintenance records help. That's how I would approach it."

Based on your description, it definitely sounds like a misfire.  The best diagnosis is to scan, read the code.  The code will tell you if there is a misfire on any particular cylinder, now swap that coilpack to another cylinder and see if the misfire moves to that cylinder (scan again & read the code).    I've also heard that once one of these coilpacks goes bad, a few more, if not all of them, tend to follow suit.  If you can afford to, i'd recommend replacing the coilpacks & the spark plugs with them."

Three things I think help you out in terms of negotiating cost, at least they helped me when I negotiated with the dealer.    I was leasing an in stock 2015 It was month end (they were really keen to deliver the car before end of June) I managed to get two dealers working against each other.    In terms of my specific situation, I managed to get about $100 off per month off the vw.ca posted lease payment of $550/month to about $440/month. I did have an $8k trade in but I took the cash, and only leveraged the tax savings (about $1200). All in all the deal was weird to work out, on paper they were $500 above invoice but they waived all fees, and did some magic math to get me that monthly lease rate.   In terms of how I did it, it was unintentional that I managed to get two dealers working against each other. I visited a dealer referred to me by a friend of a friend, and they gave me $7,500 for my trade and $450/month on the lease for an Autobahn without PP. In Canada there are only 2 trim levels, autobahn and autobahn with PP. The remaining options are leather and nav.   I then went to my sales that sold me my old car and whom I am friends with. I was giving him the courtesy of doing the deal for me instead, but asked for an extra $500 cash since it wouldn't be fair to the first dealer if the deals were the same (I believe in time priority). He ended up giving me $8k trade in, plus $450/month on an Autobahn with PP. The PP alone is a $2.3k option in Canada. I obviously took the deal.   The reason they offered me this car with the PP was because they didn't have one without the PP with the colours and features I want. Also they really wanted to move the car before the end of the month, insisting that delivery be in June (I was dealing with them the last weekend of June), and I suspect these are the last in stock GTIs with model year 2015.   I think this situation can be replicated if you look out for an in stock 2015 at month end (perhaps put or feelers mid month, so about now).   Good luck! It's a great car"

I've had many, many people complain about this issue in my years at the dealer and after coaching them a little they had zero issues. It's not like a normal automatic transmission, it has to shift out of whatever gear it was in and into the gear you selected manually. Regular auto is instant due to being hydraulic pressure and not the mechanical movement."

You cannot immediately shift gears from one direction to the opposite, neither can it. It also looks for input from internal sensors to verify there is no movement to keep from gears shearing or syncros from an early death.   Two count ensures the gear has changed.

GolfGTI,3dc4c4,adreamofironice,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:55:29 2015 UTC,It really depends on your insurance and your deductible. I ended up paying $100 for my deductible to get my whole windshield replaced about 3 weeks ago. Now in terms of the body...I can't really say as I've never had body work done. I would quote about 2-3 body shops and see what your insurance is willing to pay.

Also, the car is not an ""automatic"" per say.  It uses a class/industry leading dual clutch transmission which is more closely related to a manual tranny, also found on very high end sport cars.  As far as this community and other Vw enthusiast go, refer the transmission as the ""DSG transmission"" or simply the ""DSG"".  I know all to well trying to explain the DSG to non car people and I have come to this conculsion, for them this is an automatic.  If they ask why I got an auto, I tell them I'm a pansy and leave it at that.  Explaining to someone the idea of the DSG and explaining that it drives like an automatic just doesn't work in most cases.  Even some of your car friendly friends will not understand the DSG.

The appropriate oil I'd seen recommened in forums and whatnot had been replaced with a newer product, with a different part number.  There's both a fill plug and a drain plug for the MT. Two different kinds of fittings to get them loose depending on the model. One uses a 12 point double-square and the other a 10mm hex, so look under your car to see which you have and get the appropriate tool.  Raise the car high enough and be sure to be super safety conscious. Widowmaker jacks are not cool. Got to block it up or use car stands on appropriate stable ground.  Drain and refill. It's full when it won't take anymore. My car holds about 2.3 liters. I drained the old oil into a empty clear gatorade bottle so I could take a look at it... and then compare the quantity to what I put in. Worked on 1:1 on the comparison, as it should have.  The bottles of oil I bought at the dealership have a lengthy 'straw' built right into the jug. I was able to fill the trans with little issue.

Denvers, Detroits, and Austins are all just ok in my opinion.   I would save up some money and replace them with a nice set of 17's when you're done with your first set of tires. 17's will ride better, weigh less, and have cheaper equivalent tire options. I'm probably going to do that anyways even though I have the Lagunas. Been looking at the TR (Tire Rack) Motorsports MT1's for a lightweight wheel."

GolfGTI,3d7kbm,Proweirdo,16,Tue Jul 14 03:21:34 2015 UTC,I think this covers most if not all bases.
GolfGTI,3d7kbm,SkySniper,18,Tue Jul 14 03:58:45 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Woops, this was meant to be a top-level comment and not a reply to this comment. Sorry about that.  I'm going to assume you're a complete beginner at understanding how any manual transmission works. I had to teach my younger brother how to use his and he's got the hang of it now so I'll just repeat what I told him.  First you have to understand how your RPM will affect acceleration, and then you have to learn how you can use gear selection to get your RPM exactly where you want it.  The first thing you should do is accelerate from a complete stop and cycle through all the gears, paying attention to your RPMs as you go. As you begin to move in 1st, you'll notice that there isn't a whole lot of power from 1000-3000 RPMs, however, once you move past there you'll begin to feel the power from the engine kick in. You should have plenty of power for accelerating all the way from 3500-6500 RPM. Once you hit 6500 RPM, you'll want to shift to avoid going too far into the redline. (The DSG will automatically shift up if you go too far into redline, but its best to avoid making it do this shift for you at all costs.)  So you just shifted up into 2nd gear. Look at your RPMs and notice how they drop back down. As you continue accelerating, your RPMs will once again climb up to the redline where you'll shift. Rinse, and repeat. By waiting until the redline to shift up, you're ensuring that once in the new gear, your RPMs will land in a spot that already starts you off with plenty of power. To really understand this concept, try accelerating from a stop again, but this time shift at around 4000 RPM. You'll notice that your RPMs will drop to a point significantly lower than they were when you were shifting near redline. This means it will take longer for your RPM to climb back to where you are making the most power, and you will accelerate at a slower pace. We'll call this span of RPM where you are making the most power the ""powerband.""  For additional reference, here is a graph from APR showing how much power your car has at each RPM (This is a mk6 GTI but it will be similar for other generations.) Only pay attention to the red dotted line, that is how your RPM correlates to horsepower. (The solid lines are showing possible power gains if you were to purchase a stage 1 APR tune).  So now lets say you've done your accelerating and now you just want to cruise at the speed you're at. Shift up, all the way up. Why? Well higher gears = lower RPMs, and lower RPMs = better fuel economy. If you don't want to be accelerating, there is no reasoning behind sitting in a low gear at a high RPM burning fuel. But now lets say you're all the way up in 6th and you want to accelerate again. You could try pressing the gas pedal to make those RPM climb and give you more power, but you'll see they'll be struggling to get anywhere. Here's where you'll want to downshift. By shifting down, you're essentially asking your car to bump up the RPM. And as you've learned, more RPM = more go fast.  Depending on things like what speed you're traveling and what gear you're starting in, you may want to downshift multiple gears at once to reach an even higher RPM and get that engine power sooner. In a normal manual transmission, you would simply jump multiple gears, for example 6th -> 4th. However in a DSG, you cannot do this. You have to go one at a time. No biggie. Just downshift, you'll notice the RPM increase, wait a second or so, and downshift again. Now depending on how well you judged how much you needed to shift, you should be right at the beginning of the powerband, ready to accelerate at full power all the way through this gear. You want to try to land right at the beginning of the powerband, because if you downshift too far and land too far in, you won't have as much space available ahead of you (in the form of RPM) before you'll reach redline and have to shift again.  Once again, after finishing your acceleration and reaching the speed you want to cruise at, shift back into the highest gear you can for best fuel economy. Also, you don't have to worry about downshifting when you come to a stop. The DSG will take care of all of that for you.  So lets recap:  Higher Gear = Lower RPM = Less Power = Better Fuel Economy  Lower Gear = Higher RPM = MOAR POWAHH = Worse Fuel Economy  You'll have to analyze all these things when making judgement calls about when to shift and how many gears to shift. This is just something you will learn over time by practicing, and pretty soon it will just become second nature. Hopefully some of this helps you, now go get out there and enjoy your car!"

GolfGTI,3d7kbm,binkerfluid,10,Tue Jul 14 04:49:21 2015 UTC,am I the only one who kind of hates driving in S?
GolfGTI,3d7kbm,juaquin,4,Tue Jul 14 05:13:36 2015 UTC,"No. I basically never use it. It almost always holds gears for too long, is overly aggresive, downshifts at pretty high RPMs which makes a lot of noise (scaring pedestrians), etc. I either drive in D, or in manual and let the car downshift itself when pulling up to a stop light.  I think it would be really useful for autocross/track driving if you want to focus on things other than shifting, but for daily driving and canyon carving, I would go with manual mode all day long.  I would use S more if I could choose whether to do rev-matched downshifts or not."
GolfGTI,3d7kbm,a_dub,2,Tue Jul 14 05:43:22 2015 UTC,I've said it before....D is to lethargic and S is to aggressive. I tend to only drive in manual.

GolfGTI,3d7kbm,mmiski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"If it didn't chug so much gas I'd love it. The throttle feels much more responsive in Sport mode since it's always in the proper revs for instant power delivery. Which is what I think a hot hatch should feel like. Even though the higher build quality may fool owners into thinking it's some tame luxury car, deep down inside it's still a crude econobox hot hatch.  Regarding Drive mode, I just can't get over that damn throttle lag. That's my biggest complaint with the GTI. I know it's always there because I can feel it anytime I'm coming up to some stop and go traffic. It makes me want to keep it in Sport mode permanently. So then I might give that a try for a day or two. And it'll end up being just as fun as I want it to be. But eventually the adult side of my brain will take over because of the guilt. The guilt of burning all that damn gas just to have a few thrills here and there.  I swear this car gives me a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality sometimes. I've never felt this sort of thing while driving any other car. I actually wish it didn't come with the two options, just so I can be forced into Sport and Manual modes only. :-("

GolfGTI,3d7kbm,impruv,2,Tue Jul 14 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"To ride this, I had a question regarding manual mode DSG. Is it bad to let it auto downshift when I'm coming to a stop at say a stop sign or red light? I notice it seems to downshift later than when in D mode.

GolfGTI,3d7kbm,a_dub,2,Tue Jul 14 15:56:03 2015 UTC,I'm no expert but letting the computer choose your downshift in manual mode should be no different than in D and safe for your transmission and engine.

GolfGTI,3d7kbm,impruv,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:43:39 2015 UTC,I'm talking about coming to a full stop... which in case I would have to downshift to 1st? So I'm asking whether it's okay to let it do that itself. On the comment of 'less stress for brakes' that is pretty silly no? Changing brakes are way cheaper then changing an engine/transmission. No reason to add wear and tear to something more expensive to service/replace.
GolfGTI,3d7kbm,rocksauce,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:07:37 2015 UTC,You are correct. Brakes are cheaper than an engine. Engine braking under serious driving conditions can be pretty hard on the transmission and engine.
GolfGTI,3d7kbm,Stanleynator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:02:18 2015 UTC,"When your going to slow for the gear it will automatically down shifts for you, even in manual. by the time you've coasted to a stop it will have put itself in 1st. other example if I've come off the motorway in 6th doing 70 and coast to 40 without changing gear then accelerate it will already be in 4th. In automatic mode it will down shift quicker to keep up torque.  It wont lug at the engine since you've got 2 clutches and it will auto downshift if needed"
GolfGTI,3d7kbm,impruv,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, the only reason I bring it up is like you said, automatic mode it downshifts earlier (around 1200 rpm) whereas in manual mode it seems to do it just under 1000 or so and wasn't sure if that was bad. Not to mention it just felt rougher whenever it downshifts in manual rather than auto."
GolfGTI,3d7kbm,sixtyfivedays,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, no I don't think it is bad. Manual mode just lets you override what the computer is doing.

GolfGTI,3d77lp,rajavoce,0,Tue Jul 14 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"Opposite effect, actually. It would make the hood cooler as it will deflect the radiant heat away from being absorbed, and with the low profile engine bay trim, I'm hoping the radiant heat will escape more efficiently now rather than being absorbed by the hood (with out the reflective sheet). I'm going to wrap other bits (intake pipe, charge pipe, discharge pipe, open intake box side walls) as well as it is a cheap mod and also cheaper than ceramic coating (also not permanent). IMO, the plastic engine cover is useless."
GolfGTI,3d77lp,theohuxtable,2,Tue Jul 14 17:02:14 2015 UTC,Im talking about the heat blanket not the engine cover. The gold foild is deflecting the heat right onto your engine.

Also, where in WA are you from. I grew up in Vancouver/ Camas area. I live on the East Coast now, and the Dub scene is just not what it was back in the PNW."
GolfGTI,3d5nup,zed0K,2,Tue Jul 14 04:46:02 2015 UTC,Yep AF. I bought US so I could bring it back with me. It sucks how impossible it is to bring euro spec to the US.   I grew up in Spokane. I was a bit sad to see the VW scene there was fairly small when I was back recently. And even more sad was there were basically no hatchbacks. I guess my car will be fairly unique when I make it back to the states.
GolfGTI,3d5nup,zed0K,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:51:30 2015 UTC,"In SW Washington / Portland OR area the Dub scene is great. I used to own a Mk2 Jetta. I loved driving around and giving the peace sign (which I always interpreted as a V for Volkswagen) to other VW drivers. It was always enthusiastically returned, and usually we would both drop a gear and floor it, reveling in the glory of our German automobiles together. While there is a decent Dub presence in the DC area where I live now (stationed at Andrews, I'm in the Navy), the vibe of the scene is simply lacking. I just bought my Deep Black Pearl Mk7 GTI 2 dr 6MT in March and I love it more and more every day. I'm sure you'll have a similar experience. Cheers! Or should I say, Prost!"

GolfGTI,3d5l2f,akrazyazzho,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"Start w/ the basic maintenance and also do a carbon cleaning, coolant system flush and tranny flush, and fuel system cleaning.  A engine flush may also not be a terrible idea (get some cheaper oil, do an oil change w/ cheap oil, drive about 10 miles, do a real oil change w/ either synthetic or high mileage oil).  Seeing how you are up there, check for vacuum leaks, and lose/torn boost hoses.  I had a few vacuum leaks and minor boost leak issues in my Mk4."

I will do the tranny and try to get something for the fuel system.   Which lines should I check for leaks? I have checked the PCV and that was fine. Wondering if the DV has anything to do with it"
GolfGTI,3d5l2f,aMiracleAtJordanHare,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"I followed this guild for vacuum leaks but of course this is for the 1.8T on the Mk4.  I am not familiar w/ the Mk5 system but I'm sure the vacuum system is extensively covered by someone.  Vacuum leaks, especially larger ones will cause issues w/ normal driving/overall engine efficiency/smoothness.  Boost hoses, especially the rubber ones tend to crack since they are constantly in motion (the engine side moves as to the things they connect are typically bolted to the car).  The DV maybe an issues as well.  On the Mk6, they just fail and start to stick, causing issues w/ holding boost.  Not sure where the DV is on the Mk5 but if you can get to it, checking it would be a good idea."

The turbo is also oil lubricated and cooled which may account for the extra oil consumption you're talking about, if there is a bad seal in the turbo oil can leak through and get burned in the exhaust. Does the car smoke more than it used to when you get on it?"
GolfGTI,3d5g5u,splitcliffhanger,6,Mon Jul 13 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's either DSG (paddle shifters) or 6 speed manual for GTIs."
GolfGTI,3d5g5u,cornchips88,4,Mon Jul 13 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"To add, the DSG (""automatic"") is different than most you've driven - it's a dual-clutch automatic.  This means it shifts much, much faster than typical automatics, regardless of if they have paddles or not.  While there's no clutch to feel biting like in a manual, it still feels much more direct and connected than a typical auto where you're essentially asking the transmission to change gears w/ a paddle.  In the DSG-equipped GTIs it's just pull-BANG, pull-BANG - the gear shifts are super quick and whenever you tell it to."

On top of that, the A3 is pretty much a GTI with a different badge and a somewhat better interior, but that's debatable.

Apparently - 2DR GTI is highest to insure, then 4DR and finally the A3 is cheapest of the 3 to insure. And i was thinking it'd be the other way around. beats me. The only logic i would assume would be that GTI would be classified under a ""race car"" category and A3 is not.  The other being A3 has higher safety features/lower accident rate ?   the insurance premium is a big factor in my decision, I realized."
GolfGTI,3d5g5u,audiomortis,0,Mon Jul 20 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"The DSG (automatic) itself is an added cost option, but all DSG-equipped GTIs have both the shift paddles on the steering wheel and can also be manually shifted with the gear lever."
GolfGTI,3d5g5u,Corpulu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think my MK7 can be shifted from the lever, but rather, i use the lever to lock it into manual mode where I use the paddles to shift without the car changing gears for me (unless I'm going to over rev or stall the car).  I can use the paddles whenever I like though and it will default back to automatic after a while, or I can press and hold the + paddle and it will put it back in auto mode."

GolfGTI,3d5g5u,juaquin,3,Tue Jul 14 03:30:56 2015 UTC,i use the lever to lock it into manual mode   Push up or down and it will shift (should have a +/- symbol by it denoting which direction upshifts and which downshifts - towards the front will be an upshift in our cars but most other dual clutches I have seen are reversed)
GolfGTI,3d5g5u,Rellikx,2,Tue Jul 14 05:04:30 2015 UTC,Yeah that's annoying. My father's BMW is opposite and I'll get confused if I drive his car when I'm visiting. FWIW I think their way is more standard as it mimics a sequential shift box. Not sure why VW decides to do it differently.

GolfGTI,3d5dmj,akrazyazzho,2,Mon Jul 13 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"It does not.  The 2010 Gti's have a TPS that is in the wheel.  They switched to the ABS system in 2011, getting rid of the physical sensor.  OP is not only silly for taking this picture (while moving) but oblivious to the fact that you reset the light/sensing system by holding the TPS button in the glove box for 3 seconds.  The spares have no such sensors at all."
GolfGTI,3d5dmj,89ford194569,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"I waited until i was on a nice straight stretch to snap the photo. And yes, it was a combination of mostly downhill and some flat areas. I hit 100 going through a tunnel and thought I had missed my chance. The surprising part for me was that I was that there was no coasting involved, stayed in gear the entire time. After 13 miles, finished with a nice 61 mpg average."
GolfGTI,3d5dmj,Pakman332,3,Mon Jul 13 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"In gear is where you will have the best economy when coasting. When you are in neutral or in the clutch, the engine is disconnected and using fuel to keep itself idling (same condition you get just idling when stopped) When coasting in gear, the momentum of the car is keeping the engine spinning and often the ECU will stop injecting fuel, therefore using much less fuel and giving you the high numbers."
GolfGTI,3d5dmj,CGorman68,2,Mon Jul 13 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting, TIL! I had always been under the impression that higher rpm = higher fuel consumption."
GolfGTI,3d5dmj,slatfreq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:57:32 2015 UTC,But it also limits your acceleration downhill. He would not have hit 100 while in gear with the engine holding him back

I only ask because I have the black helix ones and I love the look of them but the problem is since its a clear smoked lens, you need to use red bulbs instead of the normal white ones and sadly the pigment on the burns off so quick and they go beyond dim so I was curious what your set up was because they looked great."
GolfGTI,3d1ocr,ChallengerDeepHouse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:49 2015 UTC,Yeah mine were the all black helix ones with the red bulbs in them.

GolfGTI,3d2tw7,lykos11,2,Mon Jul 13 12:48:17 2015 UTC,This is what I do pretty much. Fold the seat down and let them have the whole hatch. We put the lid between the front and back so they can't jump up to the front seats and acts as a separator. We also put down a waterproof blanket and cover the top edges of the backseat with it. The top of the front seats get some hair and drool on them but I take it in to get vacuumed once a week or so for that.  My seats are fine but my door panels have taken a beating. My dogs love to stand on them to stick their heads out the window and there are some scratches there and the speaker cover has chipped off in a couple places. I have resorted to buying some gel pillows and wedging them between the seat and the door when I close it. So far so good.

GolfGTI,3d1ltr,kariudo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:52:34 2015 UTC,How do you wash your car in a place like that? I'm moving out of my parents' house to an apartment complex and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.
GolfGTI,3d1ltr,bignosebigmoney,2,Sun Jul 12 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, so it's story time. I live in an apartment complex and formerly was allowed to wash my car there using one of the spigots on a building; however, when I was getting setup to wash my car I discovered they hung a rather infuriating sign that said the water was now to only be used for watering plants etc, and that the insurance company forbid the washing of cars on the complex property. Seems ridiculous, but what am I gonna do about it. So... plan B, load everything into the car and take my GTI and my GF and her Rabbit and head to her Mom's place a few towns away. Soo, technically my solution was in this case to find someone else who had a spigot I could borrow in their front yard. The other option is finding a self service car wash with coin operated pressure washers and you do the rest with your own stuff (but the one closet to me forbids hand washing... stupid as hell).  Sooo, moving on, here is how I do it:  You will need the following:   (2) 5 gallon buckets (I use homedepot ones, nice and cheap) (2) Gamma seal bucket lids (they are amazing, you can get them on amazon) (2) Grid guards (these are the secret to not covering a black car in swirls lol) microfiber wash mit with noodly appendages (great description right?) A bunch of microfiber clothes (get them in bulk for cheap from harbor freight) At least 2 waffle microfiber drying clothes Soap (I usually use meguiars gold, easy to find and works great) Wax & Dry spray   Put the guards in the buckets and fill them each about 4 inches up passed the guard with HOT water from a tub. Seal them up with the gamma lids if you have to go somewhere else to do the wash and throw them in your car.  Trick when you do the wash is to add the soap to one bucket and keep straight which one is your wash bucket. Then as you work your way top down on the car, you clean your mit in the other bucket (rubbing it on the grit guard to help clean off dirt so your dont scratch your baby). The rest is pretty much common sense probably on washing the car down. I finish off with a light spray on wax and dry (eagle one), buffing down to a nice shine with the waffles and then use the little micro fibers for details/wheels/etc.  If you cant get access to a hose/spigot:  I do this in the winter when hoses arent an option for me or when I don't have access to a hose etc.  Substitute Optimum NoRinse (amazing blue stuff that also makes a good detailer in different concetrations) for soap. Then I use a 2 Gallon garden sprayer (harbor freight, cheap), to spray the car down first with a stronger mix of ONR, then wash down with bucket ONR. Just like the name implys, no need to rinse, you can do the whole thing with JUST the 2 buckets (sprayer just makes it easier to me and is a good way to loosen off crud first). Trick with the ONR process is to use a LOT of microfibers so that you arent carrying dirt around your car.   Anyway, that got really long winded fast, but I hope it helps. Feel free to ask me about something if I didn't explain something well."

GolfGTI,3d1q9w,Fooshoa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:53:45 2015 UTC,I had to warrantee my stock clutch from a stage one tune.  I've had this new one just as long now but with no problems.  I did start to treat this new clutch much different from the original one.  I came from a six speed 2003 Matrix and was use to feathering the gas with the clutch release.  I did this with my 2013 GTI on the original clutch and believe what lead to the problem of slipping.  The gas should not be pressed until the clutch is fully released on a stage one tune with a stock clutch.  I think if you do this you should have a much longer life span.  Excluding first gear and reverse obviously.

If you don't have any warrantee left its $400+  Water pump has been mentioned.  Carbon build up from direct injection. Clean every 35-40k Injectors.  If you tune it and you're MT.

GolfGTI,3d0dmp,iAtty,2,Sun Jul 12 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"So, the intake manifold is not going to be an issue on your car. 2012 and up didn't have the bad manifold, at least I've never seen any reported, and mine had the new revision (mine was 2012).  As far as the carbon build up, any car with DI will have it, and the Italian tune up method has been proven to help with it. Ideally, if you drive hard often enough you'll clean the carbon out enough but if you want every few thousand miles you can drive on the interstate in 4th gear or whatever it takes to be at 4-5k RPM while cruising to clean out the build up. It won't get rid of everything but it will make it cleaner and prolong the time between tearing it down to clean it.   I would recommend a cheap OBDII reader and a spare set of coil packs. Coil packs on VWAG engines of that era are the weakest link. My 2012 had the new water pump so no issues there but I blew two fuel pumps in warranty."

GolfGTI,3d2h8h,mmiski,6,Mon Jul 13 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"Well keep in mind cost reductions are going to happen with each new generation no matter what. They generally try to trim away at several areas of manufacturing for many reasons—fewer parts and different materials result in quicker and cheaper manufacturing, improved handling via weight loss, and improved reliability (less to go wrong). When it's done properly it's not necessarily a bad thing.  One thing to keep in mind is that the Mk7 is still fairly new. These problems pop up all the time with early model years. The Mk5 and Mk6 generations were both imported from Wolfsburg and they both had their share of early model year problems too.  And I can confirm that the paint quality on my '08 Rabbit wasn't any better either. By the 4th year of ownership my hood had tons of chipped paint and rust spots. The worst of it was along the front edge. My ex's '07 Rabbit's ""soft touch"" interior materials also started peeling like crazy. And apparently lots of Rabbit/Jetta owners in humid regions (Florida especially) experienced tons of saggy headliner issues.  Then I got my 2014 Wolfsburg Edition GTI in April of 2014. It had 2 factory defects which had to be addressed about a month into ownership (crooked bluetooth cluster buttons and a compass module installed backwards). Then at 14,000 miles my revision BB water pump decides to die. So yeah, even the very last model year of a generation (built in Germany no less) still has its share of problems. Oh well, shit happens. I still love my GTI.  Anyway I don't see this as a German versus Mexican thing at all. Actually if you search around early Vortex threads of people who analyzed the hell out of both Euro and North American spec Mk7 Golf/GTIs (from car shows, press events, etc.), you'll see that there's actually no difference whatsoever aside from a few optional features, larger touchscreen, and the lack of an electronic parking brake. The build quality is identical.  The only difference is you've got robots in Mexico putting together the core parts of the car instead of robots in Germany doing it. The actual equipment, programming, manufacturing process, etc. is still brought over and planned out by VW of Germany. The location doesn't change any of the things that matter."

This is important. The Mk6 had all kinds of issues coming out the gate, some of which aren't entirely resolved today. Intake manifolds, water pumps, carbon buildup, etc. There weren't many interior / build quality issues though."
GolfGTI,3d2h8h,mmiski,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"There weren't many interior / build quality issues though.   If you knew where to look there certainly were! The interior of the earlier Mk5 models had somthing called ""Soft Touch"" paint along certain spots—window switches, radio knobs/buttons, AC knobs, etc. Over time this material would start to peel away. My ex's '07 Rabbit had peeling window switches and radio preset buttons. In more extreme cases it would look this bad. I think the problem was eventually resolved with the 2008+ model year, because mine sure as hell didn't have it.  Various Mk6 owners also made complaints about the cloth seats on the Golf/GTI ""fraying"" along the side bolster areas. My new GTI's premium cloth seat is already showing signs of slight wear at 15,000 miles (best way I can describe it is slight ""puffing""). I don't wear any abrasive clothing materials like denim or even anything with metal buttons. I think it's just from the friction of getting in and out of the car repeatedly. Anyway it's just one of the things I've accepted as being a minor flaw.  Then there's the infamous sagging headliner issue. This primarily affected people living in more humid regions, like Florida. I think the heat and humidity would warm up whatever adhesive VW used and caused the fabric to separate from the headliner foam. Seriously, Google search ""sagging headliner GTI"", ""Golf"", or ""Jetta"" and you'll see dozens of threads about Mk5 and Mk6 owners with this problem. The problem is so common that myturbodiesel.com even wrote up a DIY guide for it.  Anyway I could go on and find even more build quality problems, but I think you get the idea. Not trying to bash VW either. Just saying no car is completely immune to these type of problems."

The quality has been the same and none of my cars have had more problems that another. Anecdotal obviously but my experience also reflects that of many other VW owners I know.   Also, remember that even if your car is assembled in Germany, most of the parts aren't actually made in Germany, I've seen parts made in various different countries around the world, from China to Eastern Europe including North America. Most of the assembly is also automated and full of checks and balances. It's all about how the assembly line is engineered and the quality of the various components that go into the car. If a vehicle is properly designed and the manufacturing process is well engineered, it won't make a difference wether a car is made in Germany by Jens or Mexico by José.   I haven't really read up on it but the MK7 also seem to have a new frame technology that is used across many models and brands."

If you waxed the car there should NEVER be any residue that would come off or move while driving. What product was it and what process did you follow? As for cleaning it off, you can use an APC (all purpose cleaner) but make sure you dilute it with extra water. Any parts store should carry a basic APC in a spray bottle, and you can just pour some into a bowl, mix it 50/50 with water, and dip your microfiber in it to clean things up."
GolfGTI,3cyfjl,Whirlspell,2,Sat Jul 11 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"Here is a picture of part of the rubber trim. You can't see the wax on it too well, but in person it's more noticeable.  For the wax, I used Meguiar's Ultimate Paste Wax. I applied it using circular motions on the body, ensuring full coverage. I did sections of the car at a time, letting the wax dry for about 5-10 minutes then wiped it off using a microfiber towel. I only put on one coat of wax though."
GolfGTI,3cyfjl,Whirlspell,2,Sat Jul 11 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, it's probably just residue from buffing the wax off. It's much harder to see the wax on a white car but make sure you've buffed it ALL so that you don't end up with rock-hard old nasty paste on your paint. If cleaning the rubber trim with a basic APC still doesn't do the trick, there are lots of great silicon lubricants you can use on the trim (and it will protect the trim, too, like wax does on your paint). There are also products specifically made to make black rubber and plastics look like new and will make black stuff even darker."

GolfGTI,3cyfjl,rajavoce,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:37:51 2015 UTC,All purpose cleaner diluted 10:1 should work. Use simple green or something non toxic.   If you don't want to do that Mcguires sells a trim detailer that is used for removing wax.   And just for future times use some painters tape on the trim before you wax it. Just prevents the hassle of having to clean it off. I waxed my car two weeks ago and made the same mistake.

GolfGTI,3ct2mv,J-Thrilla,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:09:29 2015 UTC,"I don't care what the guy in the article called it. It's wrong. A wing provides lift. What you see there on that car provides down force.  There's a lot of words that are mutable in their meaning and exchange, but this one needs be used the way it was meant to be used.  I know folks are going to continue to call it a wing... they always will, but if I can get just a few people to understand the difference I'd be ok with that."

GolfGTI,3ct2mv,SCphotog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"The spoiler on a gti is a spoiler because it doesn't have a aerofoil profile and it doesn't have air flowing over both sides of it do generate lift. Lift does not mean up, it's just the force resulting from a difference in pressure on opposite sides of an object"
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,The_Pwnosaurus,6,Sat Jul 11 12:11:45 2015 UTC,"This is a wing...  It DOES provide lift, just in a different direction. If it's not a wing, what is it?  Don't say spoiler. A spoiler is usually a lip designed to interrupt airflow over a car to ""spoil"" lift.  But what do I know, I'm only an automotive engineer...."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,The_Pwnosaurus,3,Sat Jul 11 12:08:08 2015 UTC,"Goes, against what I was taught... But I did the research, and I was wrong.   Seems more than just a bit counter-intuitive to think of inverting lift.. that doesn't make sense to me, if you move down instead of up, that's a down-force. I find it difficult to reconcile the word 'lift' with pushing down.  So, to recap. A spoiler disrupts or otherwise spoils 'drag' on a car. The wing provides down-force otherwise creates 'drag'.  On the front of a car a spoiler might also be an air-dam, preventing airflow beneath the car. Because otherwise it might... lift off the ground. ;)  Anyway.... live and learn. I learn a lot by being wrong on the internet. I admit it stings my pride once in a while, but the overall benefit is worth it, and the sting doesn't last very long.  Thanks folks. :)  Edit: no one thought my sticker was funny? That shniz cracks me up. ""Tyrion dies"" :D"
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,SCphotog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"Well, you won me over. I won't call it a wing if it provides down force. Thanks for clearing it up."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,J-Thrilla,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that... only saying that I found it counter-intuitive to associate 'lift' with moving in a downward direction, which I think is fairly understandable, no ?  The wiki makes mention of this...  ""While the common meaning of the word ""lift"" assumes that lift opposes weight, lift in the technical sense used in this article can be in any direction with respect to gravity, since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity.""  When speaking about this kind of force in this context, 'lift' can mean downward, but I think it's fair to say that's well outside of the common definition of the word for which we associate lift with the opposition of gravity, as was mentioned in the wiki. Language is a strange beast. Something that need be static and yet mutable simultaneously.   Link to the rest of the wiki.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_%28force%29"

GolfGTI,3ct2mv,SCphotog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:18:24 2015 UTC,Makes me sad that the Ford Focus RS and even the ST for that matter is more GTI than a GTI these days.  The RS is coming next year and has more HP than this.  I mean the new RS's are even built in Germany... Unless VW pulls their head out of their asses soon I'm afraid my 15th VW may be my last one.
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,morriscode,6,Fri Jul 10 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"The GTI has never been the extreme option. It has been and will always continue to be a sporty but practical and measured daily driver hatchback, not a flashy track machine.   The ST's are a lot of fun but they don't match the interior quality and overall refinement, which is exactly what VW is going for. Of course, no one would fault you for deciding to switch if that's your thing."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,juaquin,2,Fri Jul 10 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"The MKI GTI was small and built for performance. I hear what you're saying about refinement, my MKV and Tiguan were both nice. I love VW don't get me wrong I have always loved them. It just seems the GTI has been getting bigger and bigger and it doesn't give me the same feeling as driving a MKI or MK2 GTI did."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,morriscode,2,Fri Jul 10 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"They added the r line for peak performance and refinement. Like the guy above, the gti has evolved into a sporty get around town kind of car. Like it or not."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,bobglaub,2,Fri Jul 10 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"Ftr, the gti's listed bhp is basically its whp (210-220hp) while the ST gets about 250whp stock. With a tune on both, both the gti and ST jump to about 290whp.   So, if its performance you want, a tune can make the gti on par with the ST while still getting the superior quality."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,pbrunts,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:29:15 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm well aware of that. I've Apr tuned my GTI, I just think that the price your placing on the gap in a better quality is diminishing."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,morriscode,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:09:28 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying (and I think you're getting) is that the cars ultimately perform about the same but the quality (interior, features, etc) make it better. But value is subjective and always subject to diminution.   I'd give the quality more credence based on how I would enjoy it. And I think when I finally buy my new GTI in the next year I will be holding on to it until a better option comes about. So, I'm not gonna worry about the actual price value of that quality because it's always going to diminish.   Basically, given enough years, a Toyota and Mercedes will flow towards the same price. But I'd imagine the years it takes to get there would be so much more enjoyable in a Mercedes."
GolfGTI,3ct2mv,pbrunts,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:47:54 2015 UTC,Also I think the mk7 is just as fast as the ST anyway. It just doesn't want to announce it to the world.

I plan to drive my mk4 for another couple years but after that I don't know if I'll stick with the brand.  On top of other manufacturers stepping on the GTI hot hatch territory my local dealership is downright hostile to the tuning community.

Aside from that, look from any unusual wear/damage to your car, check tires, the suspension and any loose body parts that can rub/catch.    Check for any leaks to the engine/tranny and check the CVboots while you are down there.    If you are skilled (checking it doesnt require much but if you have no idea what you are doing then don't.

Maybe they are trying to flip it quickly before they have to really clean it up and look at it and find out whats wrong with it.  GTI's are kind of a cult car so they know it will sell.

GolfGTI,3cpsgx,Th3_W4nk3r,3,Fri Jul 10 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"I'd make sure to check out the carfax. It's priced about $1500 below blue book, so I'd be cautious. Try to get maintenance records if you can and see if all the scheduled service was done and if the water pump has been replaced. The first mk6's had crappy water pumps, but if it's been replaced, it's probably with the newer part and you should be good.  Also strikes me as strange that they didn't bother to clean it or even vacuum it before the photo shoot.  The 2010 came with HIDs standard, but 2011+ came standard with halogens. You can always upgrade them later if you get a 2011+ with halogens. I have a base 2012 and I personally think the halogens are more than acceptable.   The 2010s like the one you posted came with 17"" Denvers rather than the 18"" Detroits which were standard on 2011+ I believe. The description in the link says ""upgraded wheels"" which is not true and would be another red flag about that dealership for me.  I paid about 18k for a certified 2012 with 29k miles about 2 months ago. Yes, that's more than the 12k for the one you linked, but I have the balance of the factory 36k warranty plus an extra 24k certified warranty after that. You might want to consider looking at a newer/lower mileage one; might be worth the extra price in the long run, at least in my case I decided it was.  EDIT: I'm wrong about HIDs being standard on 2010s. :)"

GolfGTI,3cpsgx,bl3nd0r,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:50:00 2015 UTC,Maybe I misunderstood something I read on the internet. It could have been that mk5's came standard with HIDs and not any of the mk6's. Sorry about the misinformation.

It was priced incredibly well but had sat on the lot for a month without ever being cleaned. I had a bad feeling from the start but I really wanted a GTI so I went and looked at it. Damn was I right, first off they didn't even want to let me drive it. The guy said it was due to the rain. Secondly the interior was stained, and the car smelt like something died in a vent. However it did have a clean carfax and a few service records. My advice with a used car is follow your gut instinct. Also, talk to your local dealer to see if they could possibly get you a CPO car. Thats what I'm doing now, but the wait is forever  (probably because I want a 4door manual). Good luck!"

GolfGTI,3cpycb,DeutscheAutoParts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:26:00 2015 UTC,Oklahoma city area. This quote was from a vw dealership so I know it's expensive for that reason alone but still I though that seemed high.   I am even wandering how much of that was just labor and how much was the price of the parts. I am looking that up as well but I wanted to seek advice on here before combing through the forums

My MK7 just went through AC issues (Manufactured defect) I don't know if you've gone to Fowler in Norman yet but IMO they are the best dealership we have around here.  You definitely need a flush though (10 years of HVAC experience) any contaminants will just eat away at that new compressor.
GolfGTI,3cpycb,bdhudd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"Hey. I was at Cable vw in central okc. I saw some place called eurosport in Norman that works on imports but did not get a quote from them yet. I will add Fowler to my list of people to call about it.   With hvac experience, you might be able to help me with something. Service rep said that the newer compressors for vw aren't prone to the same fault that the older ones were. If that's true I should not buy a used one?"

Looking through their products, and assuming 2K for brakes, 3 grand for the roll-bar and strengthening hardware along with light wheels, track tires, and their various intercooler,downpipes, turbo, etc....probably looks like 20K total investment over MSRP before the body work (stickers, paint).

GolfGTI,3cm2h3,TheTusselmaster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:35:05 2015 UTC,Extended Warrenty… man the only thing I worry about is VW. My dealership said the boost logs are the only thing that point towards a tune and VW is the only one who asks for that. I could be wrong and if someone has some experience that contradicts that I would be interested to hear about it. Also the tune can be reversed before service (Which is why the boost log is the pointer).   About the dealership search APRs site for dealerships that do the tune usually they're a turner friendly dealership if they are affiliate with them. Also I have a Unitronic Stage 1 that I'm very happy with. Unless your dead set on APR search both to broaden your search! Best of luck!
GolfGTI,3cm2h3,bdhudd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:24:50 2015 UTC,Find a dealer that provides tunes - a lot of VW dealerships also work with companies like APR.
GolfGTI,3cm2h3,th3m1ke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:42:49 2015 UTC,Just keep trying dealerships. Honestly the tunes are pretty safe and the 2.0t is a pretty solid engine. The only known issues with it is the intake manifold which VW has its own extended warranty on till I believe 120k. Also the carbon buildup but a tune doesn't really effect that.  They'd also have to prove the tune caused the failure to void the warranty. I really wouldn't worry about it go tune it.
GolfGTI,3cm2h3,rajavoce,2,Thu Jul 9 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"Just keep trying dealerships   OP said ""person from the warranty company"" - it's an extended warranty from a third party. Which dealership you use won't really matter, it's up to the company to approve or deny.  OP, it's always a risk. If you want the tune, do it, but you should expect that if you have issues related to the engine, they're going to fight you on it. They're in the business to make money on warranties, and they will do what they can to avoid paying out."
GolfGTI,3cm2h3,juaquin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:30:15 2015 UTC,Yeah but the likelihood of having a engine problem is low is what I said.
GolfGTI,3cm2h3,rajavoce,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:04:32 2015 UTC,I agree with that. It's just a question of your risk tolerance.
GolfGTI,3cm2h3,juaquin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:07:21 2015 UTC,Realistically though I don't think a tune will give him any problems that would void his warranty. The issues that the car is likely to have is not related to the engine

GolfGTI,3chtkf,Trax87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"There is a premium charge for leasing a GTi. That's why it's more expensive to lease a GTi than a BMW 328i. VW does this to encourage people to buy these cars out right. They know it's a very specific market, and that market likes to drive fast and dangerous, so they tack on a premium.  As far as leasing goes, try not to focus on how much it is per month. Instead negotiate the total cost of the lease. Once you decide the total cost of the lease, you can break it down however you want in terms of money down and a monthly payment.  Also, make sure you wait until the last day of the month to buy. You'll be able to apply max pressure when negotiating, especially if the dealership is desperate to meet quota for that month."

As someone who absolutely hates the style of the Mk7 mirrors, I think blacking them out (either a glossy piano black or carbon fiber) makes them look A LOT better. It blends it in more with the windows and the surrounding black trim.  I also made a quick mockup of what it would look like with the stem/lower part painted to match the body color. Please excuse the crudeness as I don't have Photoshop on this computer (best I could do with Pixlr). Anyway I think both look better than stock."

After that adjusting your speakers so that there's little to no bass coming from them. In the open cabin a subwoofer hits very hard. I have a 12"" and I personally really enjoy it but I think a 10 is also fine depending on the type of music you listen to.   Price wise it all adds up but it's worth it, it's something you'd use and enjoy everyday and you can always switch the sub and amp over to a new car if you get one down the line.   You're looking at probably about 100 dollars to have the car wired for such assuming you don't know how to do it yourself and anywhere from 300-600 to get a sub and amp in there."

GolfGTI,3ceezo,alcalinebattery,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:04:33 2015 UTC,Huh? You can do the necessary adjustments on your cars music player/stereo/whatever.   Your subwoofer amplifier will do the rest (to amplify and modify the signal for the sub)
GolfGTI,3ceezo,adreamofironice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:08:10 2015 UTC,"/u/CGorman68 is correct.  If your head unit does not have RCA out, which is the norm when running an audio signal to an amp, then you will need to splice into the speaker wires with a line out converter to obtain those RCAs.   Edit: Here is what you will need, what is linked to in /u/CGorman68 post will work, but a tad bit expensive and too much control for OP.  http://www.crutchfield.com/p_142LOC90/Scosche-LOC90-Speaker-to-RCA-Line-Output-Converter.html?tp=2001"
GolfGTI,3ceezo,alcalinebattery,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:41:21 2015 UTC,"What? Correct me if I misunderstood, but your point with these devices is just to convert the speaker output (no 'plug', just these plug-the-wire-thingys) to RCA?  Couldn't one just use an RCA cable and cut the plugs off from the other end?"
GolfGTI,3ceezo,Noobshul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:58:22 2015 UTC,"The only way that you would be able to do that is if your amplifier accepts a low signal turn on. The LOC helps send a signal for the amplifier to turn on. There are amplifiers that can listen for a low signal to turn on. I currently have a Kicker ZX750.1 and have the same thing going from my RCD-510 to my amplifier using this - http://www.kicker.com/KISL  I am pretty sure any OEM VW headunit doesn't have RCAs out, so unless you change your headunit, you will need either an LOC or an amplifier that can automatically turn on via a low signal input."
GolfGTI,3ceezo,alcalinebattery,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:22:50 2015 UTC,What would be the difference between RCA speaker output and a plugless speaker output? Why would the signal be any weaker?

GolfGTI,3cdi7t,neomazer19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:36:56 2015 UTC,I think the audio system on the MKVII auto mutes if it detects no audio for a few seconds. Then once music starts playing it removes the mute but sometimes it also resets the audio to the level of your minimum startup volume you set in settings on the head unit.  This also happens to me if I am playing music then make or receive a phone call. It also sometimes just stays muted after hanging up and I have to manually raise the volume to unmute it.

I've bought shift boots on eBay before, and it always seems like a gamble - half the time they are terrible. This one claimed it was cut for Mk5/Mk6 GTI fitment, but there's no way that was true. I spent about two hours in my living room carefully trimming and stapling the shift boot onto the plastic inner frame that pops out of the shift boot trim piece. It was an extremely frustrating process, but I think it looks great now that everything's back together. I followed THIS GUIDE which was helpful, but like the author mentions - your car will probably come apart in a slightly different way. Also, the guide warns you not to smash your face in with the OEM knob when you pull it off, and I tried not to... but still smashed my own face in. It was very painful. The Forge knob itself is awesome - very large and comfortable in the hand. I think this knob would actually be too big for some people (heh, heh). It sits about an inch lower than OEM height (you can adjust yours or even cut your shaft to be shorter if you want). One downside is that with a weighted knob and lower position, the plastic bracket and rubber bushings of the OEM shifter assembly become very obvious.

There are thousands of dollars dumped into that car. 15k miles is low, though. As a point of comparison, there's a 2010 GTI DSG on Carmax right now with 19k miles and a sticker price of $19,500. The APR tune, intake and downpipe are worth around $1,500, so his pricing makes sense. I'd be asking lots of questions about why they're selling a car that was clearly supposed to last a while. Also consider that the clutch will need to be replaced sooner than normal with the stage 2 tune."

Got a set from them when they first started up and advertised on GolfMKV.com and they have been going strong ever since.

GolfGTI,3c7jyi,wrestrepo,3,Sun Jul 5 18:54:48 2015 UTC,I typically use a breaker bar and a 17 mm impact socket for removal. Then when I slap the other wheels on I use my Tekton 10-150 ft. lb. torque wrench to torque them up to 90 ft. lb. The wrench can be had for ~$35 and it works pretty well.

GolfGTI,3c7jyi,Rellikx,2,Sun Jul 5 17:19:37 2015 UTC,The actual tightening doesn't need to be exactly by the book. Tightening by hand (or by feet) goes close enough.

When I noticed that the car was driving a little rough and the steering wasn't as responsive, I figured it was due to the rought rainy weather we have had in Houston these last couple of days. Alas, that wasn't the case. I'll be going to the dealership Monday to talk to the GM. Do you guys have any tips in terms of talking to the dealership and also some suggestions for the letter that I'll be writing to VW of North America for their fuck-up?

GolfGTI,3c4729,XMaximaniaX,2,Sun Jul 5 05:36:49 2015 UTC,"VW contracted the turbo design and fabrication to IHI, so it's been more their problem than anyone's.

Google ""mk7 GTI turbo fail"" and it should be the top result."

For some reason, I was under the impression that the Mk7s were given K04 turbos as upgrades to the Mk6 GTI's K03. Is that not the case then?

GolfGTI,3c4729,XMaximaniaX,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think since the Mk6 the turbos have been produced by IHI which is actually a Japanese corporation. The k03, k03s, k04, etc used from the mk4 and the mk5 were produced by KKK which I think is a German company.  A k04 is now an aftermarket upgrade for stage3 in the mk6 GTI's."

And it seems that in the US it's exactly the opposite.   But what bothers me a little is using the letter Ä. I understand that for you it seems like a German version of A, but actually it is a completely different letter with different pronunciation, so seeing it in a word where it doesn't belong, is a little annoying."
GolfGTI,3bzk99,happ3ns,0,Fri Jul 3 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"What bothers me in Europe though, is that a lot of cars have a big recess in the bumper matching the size of standard EU plates (both my current Polo and my Golf had this). When people put a tiny US-size plate which doesn't fill the EU recess on one of those bumpers, it just looks stupid.  I agree with you on the Ä thing though. A and Ä are not the same thing and cannot be interchanged. I'm talking about it from the perspective of the Nordic languages, but from a German perspective I think a plate like that makes even less sense, since ""das"" is a German word that has nothing to do with the letter Ä."

GolfGTI,3bz1ig,FrontsideFaceplant,2,Fri Jul 3 08:40:03 2015 UTC,2006-2008 came with the FSI and has a timing belt.  2009 came with the TSI and has a timing chain.  Timing chains typically last much longer than timing belts. This is usually why you see recommendations to replace timing belts every 50k miles or so.
GolfGTI,3bz1ig,dumbbirds,2,Fri Jul 3 09:39:34 2015 UTC,"The rumors you've heard are true and are from a very vocal minority of users.  To my knowledge the tensioner problem has no official driving pattern or habit associated with its cause of failure, but there is, however, a most-up-to-date revision available to be installed along with a great deal of DIY material for more savvy drivers.  My local VW dealership has had zero concerns related to this issue, and my recommendation would be to get it inspected to see if the tensioner is the revised part because the timing chain is not supposed to be serviced for quite a long time (200km iirc? which would give you approx 35kmi before changing it).  Apart from that, if it has been professionally/maturely owned, then you can guess it wasn't beaten to death and left leaning on the engine without the e-brake when parked (which a good deal of people guess is what stresses the tensioner)."

Most people generally ignore the lines and space their car out in relation to yours. So if they tend to park closely to other cars on one particular side, they'll just continue their habit regardless of line placement.  Now I just park far the hell away from everyone, leaving about a 4-5 spot gap from the last car in the crowd. Inside the lines and in a non-douchey way. It's far enough away to provide a nice buffer zone, but not too far out by itself. The last thing you want to do is draw too much attention to trolls and vandals.  On the plus side the damage happened in an area that's removable/replaceable. It would've been way worse if it happened to the rear quarter panel portion of the car, which not only can't be replaced but also makes dent removable more difficult."

GolfGTI,3bqwzv,CubicleByThePrinter,3,Wed Jul 1 12:47:19 2015 UTC,Timing chains are going to be the most costly repair on that car.  When VR6 engines get higher mileage they need new timing chains and guides.  The transmission needs to come out to do them so this is a pretty big job. Also depending on mileage it might be time for a clutch as well.
GolfGTI,3bqwzv,DeutscheAutoParts,5,Wed Jul 1 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"Meaning, when you wrestle the whole engine and transmission you should do the clutch job while you are down there."

Also worth noting it's not necessary until around 100-125k+ miles (or if you're hearing excessive rattling from the engine... an engine with timing chains tend to be noisier than those with a belt).   Every car has it's thing. Overall, this car is very reliable. My 2.8 VR had 145k miles when I traded it in and it had no issues."

GolfGTI,3bqd0j,Caydus,4,Wed Jul 1 08:18:43 2015 UTC,"You say ""front heavy FWD"" but it is certainly no worse than a WRX in that regard.  RWD is more pure, but I'm here to tell you The Mk7 Performance Pack points as good as any FWD or AWD car I have ever driven.  The reason I bought the Mk7 PP was just so I could get power-down traction, which a chipped Mk5 or Mk6 is always going to desire.  Also... Any driver aids can be turned off if you pull the fuses."
GolfGTI,3bqd0j,mixer73,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:29:34 2015 UTC,"Aye. I think the mk6 GTI is around 62/48 and the WRX is 60/40. Not enough to make any significant impact, though the AWD lets me put the hammer down almost at any point after the braking zone and it'll grip all the way out of the corner while going anywhere near WOT before the wheels are straight on the GTI makes for much scrabbling front tyres and understeer. That's where the LSD of the Mk7 PP would help, though haven't driven it at the limit so can't be sure. As for the electronic aids, yep, you can pull the fuse for it, though that would mean losing TC, ESC, ABS and XDS. I definitely want to keep ABS and XDS at least."
GolfGTI,3bqd0j,mixer73,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:54:14 2015 UTC,"The diff in the PP is absolutely sensational, it is ridiculously quick, only thing that compares that I have driven is an Evo."
GolfGTI,3bqd0j,SlimKlim,2,Fri Jul 3 09:56:55 2015 UTC,"Any sort of track duty that wouldn't be suitable for a GTI, probably isn't suitable for any car, if it's your only car.   Not to be a debbie downer, but when you're on track your standard insurance policy immediately becomes null & void. You can purchase track day insurance but it tends to be catastrophically expensive. So with that in mind, you probably don't want to do much more than a few HPDE 1 events, ""Dub Deliverance"", ""Fridays At The Track"" etc per year in your only car. Trust me, I've watched a friend ball up a $40k Subaru like a tin can, it's not pretty.  So if you're looking to get your feet wet the GTI is a great car to get started. I'd do as many autocrosses as you can register for because it's cheap, low-risk and easy on tires and brakes, and get out to a few HPDE weekends. Once you start to graduate into HPDE 2/3 and start thinking about getting competitive, I'd buy a dedicated track car that you can afford to walk away from."
GolfGTI,3bqd0j,Rellikx,2,Wed Jul 1 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid advice.  I too have known too many people that purchased a car they could barely afford, only to have to have it destroyed due to track mishaps and overconfidence."

True it is my only car, though I don't need it for work, not that it won't hurt if I turn it into a metal pancake, in all aspects of the word. It'll probably only be a handful of times a year at the circuit and the track I go to (Wakefield Park) is pretty forgiving, no walls except by the front straight. The new circuit that's being built (Luddenham Raceway) seems that way too, though there's still the chance of going shiny side down."

I learn a ton every single time.  I definitely plan on doing more track days.  If you're anything like me and like to track occasionally, then I think you're fine.  If you're trying to track competitively, you may want to look into an AWD vehicle.  Just my 2¢."
GolfGTI,3bqd0j,aMiracleAtJordanHare,2,Wed Jul 1 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, think in going to be doing it on and off, doubt it'll be competitive. If I do go competitive, the answer is MX-5 (keep the Reddit car horde happy). I've got a 2010 mk6. One of the first batch that made it into the country. I think sometime in 2012 they let TC get turned all the way off, but in my model short of swapping ecus or pulling fuses and losing ABS & XDS it doesn't go all the off. There has been talk of disabling the steering angle sensor, though nobody's tested that enough for it to be safe on track. Basically it means no rotation at all. Mainly, no fun times with lift off oversteer. Unfortunately for coming to that event, wrong continent... From Aus, though the invite is appreciated!"

From what I understand some oil Pans have sensors, mine didn't so they had to order another one which was extra 2 days. Like I said, I didn't do it my self but its very strait forward.  You just unbolt all the screws that are holding the pan, get your new oil pan and apply gasket sealant and bolt back on. Of course you want to drain all the oil if you can.

GolfGTI,3bn603,DeutscheAutoParts,2,Wed Jul 1 14:12:30 2015 UTC,Changing your oil pan is not terribly tough.  It really depends on your level of experience and comfort of tackling a job like this.  The important part if you are buying the parts on your own is getting to additional parts required of you don't have an oil level sensor.   All of the OEM oil pans come with a hole for a sensor and if you dont have one you need to purchase a block off plate gasket and nuts.

GolfGTI,3biz3v,AtariXL,3,Tue Jun 30 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"Most of it's on vwvortex.com, but you have to weed through all the ""my dealer told me"" and ""I think..."" posts.  The production schedule was posted back in April (I think) and it outlined when each model would transition to 2016.  Fun fact, the R tansitioned a month ago and cars will be arriving in Canada very soon.      The preliminary / leaked Canada order guide was posted a month ago and the NA guide came out mid-June.  The two big changes are the radio and DAP package.  Radio is changing to the MIB II unit which has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  DAP now includes autonomous braking, lane assist, and adaptive cruise control.  VW would shoot itself in the foot and hurt current sales if they published 2016 details, so they seem to be dragging it out to the bitter end.       I'm going with a silver SE 4 door / auto / LP / PP / DCC and maybe DAP depending on final price & features.  The first dealer who agrees to Partner Program pricing and will swap wheels with a Golf SEL will get my money.      Good luck with your GTI purchase!      Forgot to add for the credibility part, the order guide was leaked by the same user who leaked it last year.  VWOA and dealership employees have posted screenshots of orders and helped with production dates.  Lastly, VW announced the MIB II change well over a year ago, and there's a guy with a 2016 R who posted a quick pic & impression of the new radio."

If your employer is not in the program, many people join the SCCA for $30(?) since they're eligible for Partner Pricing.      It's a quick, no bullshit way to negotiate a car deal.  I bought my last GTI at partner pricing plus a wheel swap, and that's how I plan to get my next one.      Congrats on the order!

GolfGTI,3biz3v,AtariXL,2,Wed Jul 1 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the gold!  I'm a big fan of Audi/VW, so I love to help people who aren't familiar with the brand.      Dealers are actually reimbursed for the discount and I think it even says so on the form.  It's a guaranteed sale vs. spending/wasting a lot of time on a customer who may not buy, or will take a dealers offer straight to another dealership.  Dealers prefer customers who don't do research or use willpower, but they don't exactly hate the partner program.  Many dealers will sell at $500 below and not even require the Partner Program form, but don't make any assumptions.      The dealership will provide invoice pricing, and you can use something like MSNAuto.com to verify.  Always trust, but verify...      Personally, I would recommend nailing down your pricing with the dealership asap.  If you wait two months until the car is here, your negotiating power may be out the window.  If the dealer won't agree, you can get your deposit back (required by law) and move on to the next dealership.  If you don't want them to drill holes in your front bumper for a license plate, or you want to swap wheels with a different model, get that documented as part of your deal.      If you're trading in a vehicle, the same theory applies - do your homework!  If you look on autotrader, kbb, get a quote from carmax, etc. you will know exactly what your car is worth."
GolfGTI,3bj5hc,Awake00,6,Mon Jun 29 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"Possibly front tires need to be refitted + equilibrated. Simple thing, doesn't cost a lot, fixable fast at a service."
GolfGTI,3bj5hc,wifinotworking,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:38:13 2015 UTC,Since it's German should I take it to the dealer? Is what you said the same as a balance and alignment?
GolfGTI,3bj5hc,wifinotworking,2,Tue Jun 30 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I meant balance and alignment, I just translated the words used in my language too literally into english. No need to go to a dealer, a street corner service will do the job. Probably they will take down the tire from the rim, put it back and then do a balance + alignment."
GolfGTI,3bj5hc,goneskiing_42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"Yea, tires are brand new when I bought the car used a month ago.  Dont remember feeling the vibration when i drove it home a 100 miles from orlando to jacksonville.   I did some research and it said that if your car is german it may require special parts that your typical tire/lube place might not have thats why I asked about the dealer.  I'm guessing maybe one of the balancing weights fell off or something.    Anyway, Ill check it out.  Thanks for your help!"

GolfGTI,3bk0hz,Rellikx,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:48:33 2015 UTC,I guess it's just a case of not looking hard enough. How did you put your rear badge on? Or did it have the little plastic clips that fit right in?

Here's my predicament: certified pre owned for $28,500 with only 4500 miles on it and 4.5 years left of warranty. Just lighting pack.  Or: brand new for $31,000. Pp, lighting, and driver assist. Also SE vs Autobahn on certified  I could pay significantly less and get a longer warranty for no pp. I've also always modded and tuned, but never tracked my cars.   Opinions?"

GolfGTI,3bj0yf,zed0K,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:54:22 2015 UTC,"I would ask why the person traded it, get some reasoning behind it. I would go with the PP gti in the end though, untouched and the performance benefits are definitely worth it."
GolfGTI,3bj0yf,SirNLeo,2,Mon Jun 29 20:31:46 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Employee leased the car for 3yrs but traded in as soon as they got one with pp. Since it was a lease and because he wanted pp I bet he romped on the engine for 4500 miles.   Thanks for the input. Hopefully you'll see a new car post from me in the next week

GolfGTI,3bj0yf,cannybananas,3,Tue Jun 30 04:10:37 2015 UTC,I test drove an SE without the PP and those were a little less than satisfactory. But the PP brakes are the same rotors and pads used on the Golf R so those things will slow your shit down in a hurry

GolfGTI,3bg1ff,Jausst,4,Sun Jun 28 23:41:21 2015 UTC,Yup. I was stopped in traffic once and saw a girl staring at her phone and going about 35mph. She was about 150 feet from me and wasn't slowing down. I had to floor it into the turn lane to avoid having my car totaled by her. She hit her brakes at the last second and almost hit the car that was in front of me. If I hadn't gotten out of the way my car would have been easily totaled.
GolfGTI,3bg1ff,Jausst,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:50:27 2015 UTC,Yeah going to work yesterday I passed a guy in a nice AMG. Dude has a phone in the left hand talking and a SECOND phone in his right texting while using that same hand to steer the car.  Asshole.

GolfGTI,3bf82v,rancid_squirts,0,Mon Jun 29 00:17:06 2015 UTC,How do you use a pressure washer and not take off your paint?  I tried one time with the soap attachment but I have more pressure when I urinate.   Just fearful if I use the actual pressure goodbye paint and hello empty savings account.
GolfGTI,3bf82v,rancid_squirts,2,Mon Jun 29 13:57:35 2015 UTC,Dude it takes a lot to remove the paint. Even if you plastic dip your car the paint won't come off with a pressure washer.

GolfGTI,3bbff1,cjbt,3,Sat Jun 27 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm in the training and I jokingly asked if I could run the course in my car. They said sure, but any damage was on me and to keep shiny side up.   Needless to say, the course is a lot easier and much more fun in the GTI than it is in a charger or crown Vic. I found some of the upper limits, like a sharp turn at 60 is too much for the GTI, but I could still do it about 20 mph faster than the Charger could.   As for racing and such, private property or a track works, depending on state laws. It will vary greatly depending on where you are. For example, my state has only a handful of traffic laws that pertain to private property, too. Most only apply to public roadways."

GolfGTI,3bbb0r,sbujrb,3,Sat Jun 27 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"No you don't have to do anything. The intake is optional with the stage 1 tune but it's generally recommended.   Stage 2 is when you need a downpipe, full turboback is optional but the catback part gives you most of the sound.   I'd reccomend getting the stage 1 and intake, and then later when you have the cash to spare going stage two with a full turboback."
GolfGTI,3bbb0r,rajavoce,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think I want to hit stage 2 because this will be my daily and it might get out of control, but we'll see. Thanks bro"
GolfGTI,3bbb0r,rajavoce,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:44:31 2015 UTC,Stage 2 isn't that much more power but it's a smoother powerband and the exhaust looks and sounds nice haha
GolfGTI,3bbb0r,Peylix,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:58:35 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. 1 to 2 isn't as big of a jump from stock to 1. But I did notice a decent gain over stage 1 when I went to 2.  Some argue the power comes more from the DP than the tune (which I tend to agree with as I ran a DP w/o the stage 2 file for a week. After flashing the stage 2 tune, it felt the same but smoother powerband with the new power.)  Granted this is on a MKV. OPs car is a MKVII. Which btw Stage 1 on a MKVII is as powerful/fast as my car at 2+ right now haha. I love the new gen engines."
GolfGTI,3bbb0r,rajavoce,3,Sun Jun 28 02:57:31 2015 UTC,Yeah you just feel the engine breathing better and it spooling up quicker. Which in turn smooths out the powerband a bit. The tune really just adjusts the ecu for the freed up exhaust and gets rid of the cel it would normally give. It's not as drastic as stage 1 but it's worth getting for sure
GolfGTI,3b9x3c,plaggard,2,Sat Jun 27 04:39:50 2015 UTC,Looks nice man! I'm currently saving for a mk4 myself
GolfGTI,3b9x3c,DoctorGreen17,3,Sat Jun 27 06:04:50 2015 UTC,Thanks! 2.8 or 1.8T?
GolfGTI,3b9x3c,DoctorGreen17,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:31:25 2015 UTC,"Not too sure yet, still deciding. Which one would you recommend?"
GolfGTI,3b9x3c,DoctorGreen17,2,Sat Jun 27 20:55:34 2015 UTC,"They both have their advantages. I love my turbo, but I'm really jealous of the exhaust note on the VR6. The VR6 has smooth power delivery, but I love hearing and feeling the turbo fire up and go to work. I've heard the 1.8t is more tunable too, but I'm not sure how true that is. Needs oil changes pretty often though. If you get a 1.8t, make sure it's a later mk4 because they gave it more power. Look for the AWP engine code."
GolfGTI,3b9x3c,CaptainTwerkThunder,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:21:52 2015 UTC,Awesome man thanks. I'll definitely keep my eye out for the AWP :)

Bought it November of last year with 80k on the clock.  Since then I've done:  -Timing belt/water pump  -Strut Mounts  -RF Tie rod  -R8 coils with IE adapter plates  -Plugs/tuneup/clean throttle body and mass air sensor.  -Amsoil in the motor and tranny  -Many small interior/exterior fixes (Gah, why are the interiors so damn fragile???)  -Full 3 stage detail (M105/205 with a DA, then Collinite 845)  -Black/red piping GTI (from the dealer) floor mats that I got for Xmas  It's finally starting to feel like it's 'Mine' at this point.  It's my first VW, and even though it's a pain in the ass to keep maintained, now that I've got it at a baseline, I'm loving the little fucker.  I did my homework and knew what I was getting into, but still, the stories about these cars being high maintenance are no joke.   Future plans include a 42DD 2.5 turbo back and intake, APR stage 1 flash, and probably an Eibach strut/spring kit.  It's my daily, and I just want it nice and streetable with some modest power gains.  I'm very much a 'If it doesn't make the car perform better, then I'm not wasting $$ on it' kinda guy. A lot of the exterior mods and VW stance culture don't interest me much, TBH.  I like my cars clean and classy...   OP, your car is a good example of that aesthetic.  Looks great."

GolfGTI,3b5749,SlimKlim,2,Fri Jun 26 08:45:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the '15 is that much better. The MK6 generation is essentially a reheated MK5, which came in in 2005 as a 2006 model, so a 2013 MK6 is pretty freakin' long in the tooth at this point. That said it's still a great car so if the pricing works for you then go for it.   It's hard to describe what makes the GTI special to people who don't get it or have decided they don't like them. It's not the fastest car, it doesn't have the best ride, it's not the most efficient, it's not the most luxurious, it's not the most well-equipped and it's not the cheapest or most reliable.   However for those of us who are considering all those things on a sliding scale, it's the only option. I didn't test drive anything except the MK7 because literally nothing compares to it. I wanted a FWD, fairly efficient car with subtle styling that doesn't scream ""look at me"". I wanted it to be quick and fun to drive, but also a comfortable place to sit in traffic. I care more about how solid a car feels and how well it rides than I do about having airconditioned seats.   For some people it just works, I like Jeremy Clarkson's summary of them, the GTI is all things to all men, you can park it on the street knowing it won't be vandalized, and have it valet parked without being embarrassed."
GolfGTI,3b5749,Rellikx,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"idk, price wise, the 12s and 13s are just so cheap right now.  My '12 with 11k miles was 18,000 OTD 1 year ago, so I imagine they are even cheaper now.  I test drove them both back then, and just couldnt justify paying 10k more for the mk7.    Then again, I never liked the mk7 body style as much as the mk6s, so I am a bit biased.  If I liked the mk7 body more, I would have probably considered it a bit more.  Also, the mk5 GTI had a different engine than the mk6, so I dont really consider it a ""reheated"" mk5 (well except for the last half of the last year for mk5s)  Either way, I agree with you on the GTIs in general.  I'd rather drive any GTI over any other car in similar price range (shit, Id even take a GTI over some more expensive cars).    GTI feeling = best feeling"
GolfGTI,3b5749,SlimKlim,2,Fri Jun 26 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"The MKV had the TSI motor starting in 2008.5, my MKV was a 2009 with a TSI. And even though the motor had some reliability improvements, having driven both, you'd have to be a super nerd to notice the difference between a stock FSI and stock TSI MKV.  The interior on the MKVI was a staggering improvement over the mediocre quality in the MKV, but otherwise the changes from MKV to MKVI were pretty subtle, very similar ride quality, same basic chassis.   The MK7 is larger, wider, and lighter than the previous generations. The difference in handling is noticeable and the MK7 has significantly less body roll and feels ""lighter"" on turn in than the MKV and VI in my opinion.  You're getting a heck of a lot of car if you get a good price on a low mileage MKVI, but he asked how big the difference was between the VI and VII, and it is pretty significant. The MKVI chassis is based on 10 year old technology and the motor is 6 year old technology, the MKVII is truly brand new and it shows when you drive them back to back, at least in my experience."

You could definitely do better if you were willing to go in and buy the silver 4-door S with DAP and lighting that they can't get rid of, but if you want one of the more desirable combinations, you won't have a ton of wiggle room.   If it helps mine is a 4-door, white, SE, DSG + LP, sticker price was 31,500ish, I paid somewhere in the ballpark of 29,600. You'll  have to forgive me, i don't have the paperwork nearby and its hard to remember what numbers include the monster mats and destination charge and stuff, so I'm not sure how accurate that is.   I admittedly have the lame commuter-car version of the GTI, if you're more hardcore than me and can get by with less options, I've heard of people getting out the door with 2-door manual transmission S models in the neighborhood of 23-24k. You could add the performance pack on top of that and have a ~25k monster (granted without keyless access and a sunroof) Personally my commute is 8 miles and my average speed is 12-14mph during those 8 miles, I get infinitely more use out of the nice stereo, sunroof, and high tech transmission than I ever would out of a differential."

GolfGTI,3b7j2g,MDVYN,2,Fri Jun 26 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"The Audi TT shift lever balancer gives the MK4 5 speed a shorter throw and it's relatively inexpensive. It's not a LOT shorter but a little and on the cheap.  There are many aftermarket short throw options.  If you just replace the balancer to shorten the throw, it's really easy and by doing it you'll be adjusting the linkage. Not a bad thing to check now and again anyway.  I bought an inexpensive 'Tsudo' exhaust for my 1.8T MK4 GTI and it's been very nice... for years, with no issues, no rust. It sounds awesome.   Folks like to poo-poo the cheapy exhaust systems but I've been very happy with mine, and people often complment the sound.  CAI I think for a VR6 is going to be a matter of preference mostly. I would be concerned about fitment the most.  I have an MK5 too. It's got a K&N Typhoon intake that's been solid. Bolts right in, no bullshit, just fits and does the job.  If you replace the entire enclosure, pretty easy. I tried to replace just my bulbs with LEDs. Some wouldn't fit into the space and the ones that did seemed to not really be bright enough, so I stuck with regular bulbs. That was a couple of years ago.... I know Cree style LED's a re much brighter and they might have made their way into auto lights by now.  If you go the HID route... for all the things that are good in the world please aim your headlights."
GolfGTI,3b7j2g,SCphotog,2,Fri Jun 26 17:19:42 2015 UTC,"I drive the same year VR6. I've got a Magnaflow exhaust, CAI (Forget which brand, honestly there just tubes) with a K&N filter and a Unitronic Stage 1+ tune.   The #1 thing I would recommend is a decent exhaust. Its not going to add much power, if any, but you get that lovely VR6 growl.  The Unitronic tune felt like it added a few ponies on the butt dyno, but what it really helps out is throttle lag. I noticed right away that the engine was WAY more responsive after the tune. Its not going to be a night and day increase power wise, but I felt it was worth it.   Replacing the tail lights are easy. Just a few nuts to take off in the trunk area. HID headlights are going to require a proper HID kit and headlights that can support them. You have to remove the bumper to replace the headlights but its not that hard to do."

Other options is possibly picking up another car for these kind of responsibilities, older accord or Camry? Can be had for cheap and you can sell it for not much less than what you payed for in like 2 years.   What car does your wife have, and how often do you need to put the baby in your car   I just feel like it'd be really tedious putting the baby in and out the backseat"
GolfGTI,3b598w,rajavoce,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"I am the designated dropper offer and my wife picks her up, so I will be using it as child transport every weekday.  My wife has a kia rio hatchback, 2012 I think. It fits snug in the back, but she has 4 doors and access to the seat is much better. I've been looking around for any 4 door gti, even a newerish one and they aren't really in the area (private sellers).   It isn't so bad getting her in and out now, as she has a detachable seat with a base. The seat she will need soon is a monstrosity and you have to take her out of the seat to get her out of the car. Which will be a pain."

GolfGTI,3b2eke,Godoftheblackflame,8,Thu Jun 25 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a lot of these questions can only be answered by you.  Most financial gurus I've seen recommend never buy a new car (always buy one two years old or so), and I've never seen one really recommend leasing, for the most part.  I bought brand new, so I obviously did not follow the gurus to the letter.  :)  However, I've only had two cars since I turned 21, and I'm 45 now.  I try to enjoy the years without car payments.  Brings me to reliability.  After a certain point, all cars need repairs.  Parts wear out.  Service intervals need to be performed.  My rationale is if I set aside money for these repairs in advance, all while paying off the car, then once again, I think I truly get to enjoy the car payment-less years.  To the kids--I have two of them, and for me that makes a four door a must.  My car isn't the main kiddie hauler, but it needs to be able to do so.  While kids can get in the back seat of a two door, it is so much easier with a four door.  Especially if you are putting in and taking out car seats.  Depreciation--I did not buy gap insurance, because according to my credit union's ""will you ever be upside down"" calculator, it was never going to happen with this car.  To me, that's another way of looking at it, and saying, yep, holds it's value.  Truly, though, that will vary depending on the care of the car, the options, much more than I could predict.  All predictions are that--just predictions.  I could have been ""OK"" with some Honda or Toyota, and then satisfied the ""I bought something super reliable"" side.  But my thinking is that if I am in this car for the long run, I want to have fun as well (edit: not a slam on those makes of cars).  And I don't feel I bought something that was on the unreliable side.  All makes and models of vehicles will have their trouble spots.  But that was for me, your emotions and thoughts may be different.  Good luck with the decision."
GolfGTI,3b2eke,OKComputer2012,5,Thu Jun 25 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"The space in the back of the 4 door GTI is impressive. Never mind kids, medium-sized adults can sit in the back with no problem. I'm a tall driver and with the seat in my driving position there is still behind me to sit another person just under my height.   I ultimately decided to purchase because I could see myself driving this still in 10 to 15 years with small kids in the back (I'm in my mid-20s with no kids... for now). If anything, my concern would be that the leather on my car would not hold up that well to the treatment offered by kids, but I'd imagine the cloth would be much more durable anyway and cheaper to boot.   In terms of handling or sportiness, I never found the 5 dr to be considerably less so than the 3 door in my test drives, and the 3 dr is just as easy to park. If you've got the budget to get a 5 dr*, then I highly recommend it.   *edited for numbers"
GolfGTI,3b2eke,codespyder,4,Thu Jun 25 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"I am in a similar sort of position.  Have you driven one yet?  The 4 door is a must for me, I think with the prospect of kids it should be for you also.  I don't really see any downsides except a bit more weight.    I also wouldn't worry about the manual transmission, from what I have seen, they are in more demand than automatics.  A lease is only good if you want new but can't afford to buy new.  I have found that if you do a 6 or 7 year term on a purchase, the payments end up close to or less than a lease.  That comes with its own set of risks, but I think it may be wiser than a lease (you can always pay it off faster, but a lease is a lease)."
GolfGTI,3b2eke,Hewbacca,4,Thu Jun 25 14:21:14 2015 UTC,"I'm just coming out of leasing my first car, and I have to say I'm happy with my experience.  Prior to this, I only bought used cars, figured let someone else pay for the depreciation, but when I was in the market for my last car the price of used cars just seemed to have spiked.    I was nervous about a commitment to a brand new car, getting stuck with a lemon, impossible to track down electrical issues, don't get me wrong it’s not like these things can’t happen with a used car, but my financial commitment to a new car would be much more significant, so for my peace of mind I decided to lease.  I really felt if I had problems or got into an accident with it, I could just walk away from the car down the road, granted with no equity, but also not stuck paying for a car with issues.    Fast forward three years, my 2012 GLI is coming off lease, I have 24k miles, I love my car, and it has been great.  I feel like I have a lot of options coming out of it.  I know the car intimately, I can feel good about buying outright, I can turn my equity in on a new Lease or purchase, (I’m leasing a 2015 GTI, picking it up any day now).  So now the downside?  Am I in a perpetual car payment?  Maybe, but I have wanted a GTI since I cracked up my ’86 10 years ago, but I went with the GLI in 2012 because my kids were still in car seats, but now with boosters the 5 door autobahn will be perfect!    The main factor is as with any decision you make go in with your eyes wide open.  Make sure you understand what you need to do to make the lease work for you, get the appropriate mileage so you can stay within the constants of the lease, don’t go mod crazy off the bat, if you want to mod it you can but I would try to decide early on if you want to buy it before you start investing more money into it.   A lease can be a good way to go about getting a car that may be a little out of your price range, and defer a long term commitment.    I guess the TLDR version is no one can tell you what right choice is for you, this is my experience, and so far it’s been good three years from now I may feel very differently."
GolfGTI,3b2eke,Steves_Dad,3,Thu Jun 25 14:33:13 2015 UTC,"So let's say you get a base model GTI, manual, no Performance Pack, LP or anything.  $5,000 down, $378 a month for 60 months, according to VW (dealer should be less) for a $25.6K MSRP GTI you will be out of pocket $27.7k in the end. Payments stretched over 5 years.  A lease on the same car is $750 down, $350 a month, over 35 months ($750 down includes the first payment, so really it is just $400 down + first month), with 15k miles allotted per year. $13k is what you pay for the car over 3 years. Payment at the end of 3 years if you want to keep the car will be $14,800. $27.8k total at the end if you want to own it, through the payments made monthly and what you owe at the end. Nearly no risk in this investment. Turns out you don't like the car? Don't buy it at the end. Turns out your life changed dramatically and you need a truck or something completely different? Don't buy it at the end. Turns out there is some new car coming out that you simply must have? Easy, don't buy your leased car at the end. See where I am going?  Now here is where you are the only one that can give the answer. Do you think your life will change a lot 3 years from now, to the point where you want a new car?   If you buy it, you will be 5 years out before you are done with payments. In 5 years, if we follow a 2010 GTI to see the depreciation (even though I expect MK7s to hold their value a little better) we see a 5 year old GTI is worth $10-12k when it is in good to great condition with 75k miles on it (15k a year, following what most leases can/will allow).   So over 5 years you paid $27.7k into a car and can sell it for $11k (rough average). This means you lost $16.7k in the car over 5 years - $278 a month - and this does not take into account any repairs you needed to take care of. There is risk here.  If you lease, you pay $13k over 3 years, at $350 a month, but probably wont get hit with any maintenance (it use to be all maintenance was covered by the 3 year lease, so you weren't out of pocket, ever). The risk here is less since you will only have the car to 45k miles, aren't on the hook for any costly repairs or maintenance, and don't really have to worry about overall condition (within reason) of the car at the end of 3 years. You have minimal risk here.  A lot of people look down on leasing. It's 'paying too much to rent a nicer car than you are able to afford, and you own nothing at the end of it' is a common logic for many people. My family can afford to buy cars in cash, and we still lease. No risk. New car every 3 years. We drive them really, really hard, and then get something new. My mother leased a BMW X3 and liked it, so when her 3 year lease was up, she purchased a brand new one. That was nearly 4 years ago, and she regrets it. Not because it is a bad car, she loves the car, but she wants a new car right now and would have traded her decision to buy and instead leased it at the drop of a hat. Sure, she could sell it and lease something new, but she has no payments, and cant justify to herself to shell out monthly for something new over sitting with a car she is just 'meh' with and not having to pay for anything other than repairs. She already forked over a large sum for the car, and even though she can make some of that back, and in the long run it makes little difference, she just feels stuck with the car.  There are ways to work some cars so that the lease + buyout at the end is less than purchasing the car outright. So I know people that do that.  There are some cars that just make sense to lease when certain banks calculate their worth incorrectly. I know someone driving a fully loaded 2015 Toyota Tacoma TRD PRO Double Cab ($40K+ truck) for $1,000 down, and $200 a month for 3 years. At the end of the lease, he will find something else equally as ridiculous and cheap for what it is.  Leasing, in some smart cases, allows you to 'own' the primo miles on some nice cars cheaply. You can buy a 2-3 year old car for about the same cost as a 3 year lease, it's true. But again, you are getting a 3 year old car, you take on more risk (in the form of possible repairs), and the value of reselling it once you are done (unless you really luck out) is minimal. So why not lease a new car?"
GolfGTI,3b2eke,Janus408,3,Thu Jun 25 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"The GTI will be a decent family car. Will it be cavernous inside? No but for what you use to for most days I'm sure it will be good. In Europe a golf/GTI is a family car so it will work here if you work within its limitations (trunk is only so big)  The 2 door vs 4 door conundrum is one that has pros and cons. My old boss has always had 2 door cars and he's raised 3 kids. But I personally would have a 4 door. My mom had a golf cl 3 door way back in the day and she swore that if she had to do it again she would have spent the extra to get a 4 door.   If you are considering leasing you could lease for a couple of years and then if the kiddies appear you could always change it for a 4 door GTI, Jetta, Tiguan or a minivan (gasp).  In terms of reliability you will have to stay up on your maintenance and make sure you use  reputable VW parts or high quality aftermarket parts, but from what I've seen they aren't considerably more than Hondas and Toyotas. Also keep in mind you don't have to go to a dealership for your wear and tear work. Just keep detailed service logs and use genuine VW parts where possible."
GolfGTI,3b2eke,cmackenzie93,3,Thu Jun 25 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"2013 GTI Lessee here. This is my first lease, but so far its been a great experience for me. I've heard many horror stories about leasing, but if you know the terms of your lease and are confident that you can meet them you should be golden. The 2 main things you need to focus on are milage and maintenance. As long as you stay under your milage and complete the required scheduled maint you shouldn't have any surprise payments/fines when you turn the car in. There are a lot of reasons why I decided to lease, but the biggest for me were:  1 Low monthly car payment. The car payment on my 2013 GTI lease is within $20 of the 2005 Subaru Impreza I owned prior to my lease.  2 Sales tax on $13,000 is much less than $26,000.  3 You aren't taking out a loan to pay the lease, just paying your monthly car payment, so no interest rate.  4 I've heard maint on a turbocharged cars can be expensive, I'll be returning the car just as its getting broken in (3.5 year lease).  Everyone is different. If you can't stay within your milage or afford the required scheduled maint you'll pay out the ass when the time comes to return the car. Also, per my lease agreement I was required to have gap insurance and a certain amount of coverage. Make sure you go over the lease contract thoroughly and you'll be set."
GolfGTI,3b2eke,develitate,2,Thu Jun 25 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"Not to nitpick, but there is an interest rate on a lease. You essentially are paying the expected depreciation on the vehicle based on the number of miles driven. If your depreciation is $13,000 over 3 years for 15K miles/year, then you have the choice to pay $13,000 immediately at the beginning of your lease OR make monthly payments. If you choose to pay monthly, like I imagine 100% of leasers do (and are encouraged to do generally), then you will pay an interest rate called a monetary factor. Monetary factor is a (relatively) unknown lever dealers can manipulate to increase their profit. Essentially, if you make monthly payments, your total will be greater than the $13,000 depreciation of the car. The monetary factor is written into your lease contract and is negotiable to a certain degree."

Changed the coils to the R8 red top coils and a fresh set of NGK Lazer Platinum plugs and that fixed it.

GolfGTI,3axpgu,Baltorussian,2,Wed Jun 24 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Bought it in February with just over 30k on it. Surprising too because it's a Texas car. But I live in a relatively small town. My work commute is only 4.5 miles and I haven't road tripped in it yet. Guy I bought it from only put 6k miles in the year he had it. He drove it 8 hours home from Houston, to Dallas a couple times, but mostly just back and forth from his job a few miles away from his house. The low mileage was a huge reason I bought it."

GolfGTI,3axpgu,gentlecrab,2,Wed Jun 24 21:40:18 2015 UTC,You have literally doubled the mileage I have on my MK5 and then some. Impressive. Here's to 150k more!
GolfGTI,3axpgu,galador,3,Wed Jun 24 21:36:59 2015 UTC,Here is a recent shot  http://imgur.com/x3cmyRe
GolfGTI,3b1eyz,Jigetz,4,Thu Jun 25 04:47:57 2015 UTC,"I have an early 2013 model that I bought new almost three years ago and it now has 60k miles. I've had zero issues and do the maintenance myself. I was tuned at 10k and stage 2 at 20k. Currently have an intake, throttle body pipe, intercooler, downpipe, catback exhaust, intercooler, APR tune, and  APR DSG reflash. The car runs like a gem. Here's my advice:  Oil change every 7k miles at the max.  For the love of high compression engines use 91 or 93 octane fuel, or the European equivalent. Octane is a hydrocarbon, it serves a purpose, it's not magic, don't be cheap and stupid.  Don't beat the piss out of it, but go WOT at least once a day to blow out the carbon and have fun. Take it on the highway every now and then and drive above 3k rpms.  Most importantly just enjoy your car and don't neglect it. If you drive it like a Prius you're dumb and purchased the wrong car. It needs to be driven so have fun because it's a great car. Remember, there is a vocal minority of people who had/have bad luck with this car like any other model. The rest of us barely make a peep because we're too busy enjoying our purchase. GolfMK6 is a great resource, but they'll make you paranoid. My dad has a purchased new 02 RSX Type S with 170k miles and no issues. He's actually slapping a supercharger on that bitch now. Bottom line, he read the forums and almost lost his mind, 170k later and its been nothing but a champ. Discretion."
GolfGTI,3b1eyz,v1user,3,Thu Jun 25 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"The DSG service would be coming up.  The DSG service is not expensive @ $160 every 40k if you do it yourself. Some dealers do quote you at close to ~$500 for that.  You will have an issue w/ carbon build up on the intake side of things. You will have an issue w/ mold buildup on the A/c evaporator (easy fix). These two issues are simple DYI jobs (the carbon one just takes a lot of time).  There is a potential for water pump issues, it affects close to 3% (made up number, sort of, this is a number provided by my friends at my local Vw dealer) of our cars. There maybe a intake manifold failure but that is covered upto 120k by an extended factory warranty. Both issues are extensively covered by Vw and the water pump one is covered in ""good faith"" by most dealers even beyond the warranty period which includes a loaner.  Some cars have issues w/ the fuel pumps, small amount.  Other than that, the car is pretty solid and reliable. It has its standard set off issues w/ car ownership but nothing crazy and parts are not bad at all. Oil changes, brake pads (much less so on the DSG), rotors, spark plugs, coil packs, and other normal items like brake fluid, coolant flushes, and disposable items like washer fluid.  As long as you know the known faults, this car is generally very well rounded and a great choice no matter its use. Keep in mind there is no car out there that has no issues to speak of, each car out there has its own set of kinks.  Would like to add that I got mine @ 27k miles for $17k over a year ago, DSG sunroof and in a more expensive area. You should be able to find a lower mile one than the one you are looking at."
GolfGTI,3b1eyz,akrazyazzho,2,Thu Jun 25 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thorough reply!

GolfGTI,3b1eyz,akrazyazzho,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"here you go man  It is simple but it takes time.  No matter what, you will have to do it at some point.  Some people do it at 25k, some of them have clean valves where as others have dirty ones.  Most will agree 50k is really good to do it at.  As your engine gets older, the more often you should do it."

GolfGTI,3b1eyz,mmiski,2,Thu Jun 25 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"This was posted yesterday. Might answer some of your questions.  Long story short water pump failure is probably the single biggest problem with the mk6 gen. It has gone through quite a number of revisions over the last few years. And unfortunately 2013 and 2014 model years aren't immune either.  The water pump on my 2014 died at 14,200 miles. The factory installed pump was revision ""BB"". My dealership replaced it with a newer ""BG"" revision. It might still be too early to tell, but I haven't heard of any ""BG"" revision pumps failing yet. So hopefully VW ironed that problem out.  Aside from that my 2014 GTI has been very reliable. Just keep an eye on the coolant once in a while and you should be fine."

GolfGTI,3aykbs,autonomous2323,3,Wed Jun 24 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"There's really only two differences:   Maps: Unitronic is going to map the throttle/boost/etc differently than APR is. Obviously they don't make this info public so you don't really know what the difference is, but Unitronic is known for being a bit more aggressive. One company might also offer more maps than the other (different maps for different octanes, less aggressive maps, etc) Control: APR offers a bluetooth setup that lets you change your tune via your phone if you want to pay extra for that; otherwise you use the control stalk. Unitronic offers a cable that lets you do basically the same thing from your computer."

GolfGTI,3aykbs,juaquin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:02:37 2015 UTC,Yeah their all pretty similar honestly. But unitronic is definitely known to have the smoothest power delivery.

This should be enough to stop the seat belt being a total annoyance while still maintaining your arm/hand position and leg position.    I found that in the GTI, I sit a lot further 'up' than in most cars because it feels right to me that way, but YMMV."

I'll see how long I can tolerate it, I really feel like moving the receptacle back would fix my issue so I'm definitely going to look into that option, if it can be done safely and easy to reverse when I sell it."

GolfGTI,3awt6z,TDN12,2,Wed Jun 24 05:07:57 2015 UTC,"All jokes aside, there are a few common issues with the MKVII, and I've been unlucky enough to have a couple of them.   At low RPM (1500-2500) when pressing the gas pedal, there is a ringing noise coming from the passenger side engine compartment. There is a different noise than the fuel line rattle. It is metallic and sounds like a high pitch ringing. There is currently no fix. It is likely  a waste gate actuator rattle like on previous generations. Door creaks - the passenger and driver doors creak and tick. I put irrigation tubing inside the felt liner and I use silicon lube to reduce it. It helps. Radio resetting to 87.7 - this is a firmware issue and has been fixed. If your system does this, take it to the dealership and ask for the recent software update. Of course, I've done that and the dealer says that mine is up to date... it's not. Dealers are stupid. Can't swap driving modes on infotainment - this will go away after the car cools down. It's meaningless, as the hardware actually is swapping modes. Just annoying. Fuel line rattle - the fuel lines tend to rattle together in their canal. Newer builds are suppose to have this taken care of at the factory; they install foam in the canal to prevent the lines from banging together. You can do this on your own if you know how. Wheels that haven't been fully painted. Check behind the ""spokes"" on the wheel and in the barrel. Look for unpainted areas. Dealers are required to address this. Strut pucks left in upon delivery. You'll know if you have this problem - the car will feel awful when going over bumps. It's very uncommon now.   That's about it. No major problems. All together it's an awesome car. Sadly, dealerships tend not to want to do warranty work. They also tend to be ignorant. Push hard to get the work done if there's a problem. That's what the warranty is for."
GolfGTI,3awt6z,okcookie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:21:09 2015 UTC,Check the wheels to make sure they are fully painted.  Took 2 dealers and 3 sets of wheels to correct the issue

The infotainment screen wouldn't let me change driving modes (normal/sport/individual). The menu would come up but everything was greyed out.  Press and hold power button for radio for ~10s, it preformed a hard reboot, worked afterwards. At the same time (or as a result), the one-touch up-down on my front driver window stopped working. There's a procedure for resetting that; roll the window all the way down, press down for 3s, roll it all the way up, press up for 3s. Also works fine now.  Basically, they were minor issues that were user-fixable... as long as you know how / read the manual."

In all seriousness, you just have to worry about is making sure your dealer takes care of the Strut Pucks and watch your fuel rail.  Also make sure your panels are properly seated, your dash is not shaky or rattling and if any of it does. Take it back right away and demand them to fix it. Mexican VW's are extremely well known to be put together very sub par."

If not, it's been recording data for that long and perhaps someone at the dealership was idling the car or it was turned on without the engine running.   And if that's the case, then I wouldn't be concerned. The car computer is showing what it shows based on the data it has been collecting since the car's build date. I think your best bet is to reset the data for the extended period on your next fill up and monitor it from there."

Also note, if you drive your car in a spirited fasion, that lower MPG is expected (however not that low).

GolfGTI,3ax104,Rellikx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:01:16 2015 UTC,Well this is in full auto mode right? The car needs to decide how many gears to drop to accelerate as quickly as you're requesting. If you manually drop it to second gear doing around 40 it takes off right away right?

Do you have long idle times when you turn the car on or before you turn it off? Are you sure you aren't accelerating unnecessarily quickly? I know you said driving in sport gives you better mileage but it shouldn't, as it causes the engine to rev higher.   It does take the car a while to get to higher mpg but it shouldn't be that low. At all. Mine was getting about 26mpg when I first bought it and now at 3500 miles I'm a bit over 29."

GolfGTI,3auiil,zed0K,2,Wed Jun 24 12:49:17 2015 UTC,Is this vehicle from a VW dealership? If so is it CPO?   If it is CPO then you will have a longer warranty than buying new. The 2014 GTI was the last year for the car so it hopefully has had time to work out any links in the building process. It was also the last German built GTI if that means anything to you.   It won't be as reliable as your Toyota. But it will also be a hell of a lot more engaging and enjoyable to drive.

GolfGTI,3auiil,cmackenzie93,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:47:47 2015 UTC,Yeah the new MKVII are made in Mexico. With car max you can look at getting the extended warranty a Jalopnik writer has one and has quite an interesting story on how much it has covered on his Range Rover.   However if you take good care of the car you won't have many issues. I have a 2003 GTI that was babied and it has never failed me. Fires up on the coldest of days and can still haul ass. They are amazingly capable cars a hoot and a half to drive

I bought a 2014 Wolfsburg new for less than that when they were getting ready for the 2015 models. That might be an ok price for a Driver's Edition, but if you're paying that much, I would maybe think about a base model 2015.  Whether you should do it at all depends - how much money do you have to play with and do you really want the performance? Yeah it's an amazing car, but not having car payments is also amazing, depending on your financial situation. If you want a Mk7 model with some packages, I would recommend waiting a year or two and saving up the money, rather than going with the 24k Mk6."

I can keep looking or wait a little while longer maybe.  Honestly, if I played my cards right and was going for the 2014 that I am looking at, I could pay it all off with cash."
GolfGTI,3auiil,revvedupboston,2,Tue Jun 23 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"The Edition's only came in 5dr so you're covered there. Honestly it sounds pretty high for a Wolfsburg - the list price for the Wolfsburg was $25,890. If you want to get that one, I would make them come down on price - less than $2k off list price for a used, last generation, basically base-model car that isn't CPO is not a fair price. I would want to pay $21-22k for that.  That 2015 for $23k sounds like an ok deal. If you still want the Mk6, you could use that price to bring them down. Or you could just buy the 2015.

For a sport trim hatchback it gets great fuel economy (regularly achieve 29-31 MPG). It's faster and more fun than the '08 Rabbit I replaced it with. BUT I also know I'm going to pay more for maintenance—with the 18"" tires and DSG maintenance every 40k miles.  The 2.0T is notorious for carbon buildup issues. But that issue isn't exclusive to VW (it's a trait shared by many direct injection engines).  Water pump failures are also common with this generation. Mine took a dump 2 weeks ago at 14k miles. The car came with the ""BB"" revision pump and was replaced by the ""BG"" revision one (latest one). Hopefully they finally have it fixed for good.  But yeah I love my GTI inside and out.

It's the perfect car for the city. It's a smooth, confortable, subdued car when you're driving normally, but just push down on the throttle a little more and you have a raging beast wanting to get out. It's a great compromise.  Sure, a Huracan would be nice, but I would probably drive it less than my GTI, and I'd be far more stressed doing it because literally anything happening to the car is practically an instant few thousand dollars down the drain.  So while I'm neither the OP nor the person you replied to, I'd call it my dream car. It's affordable enough that damaging it (while still horrible) won't absolutely destroy you, powerful enough when you want it, but calm and subdued otherwise. Very few cars strike that balance as well as the GTI."

GolfGTI,3aq6kz,mc-sane,4,Mon Jun 22 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"You're being taken to the cleaners on either interest or residual. Have them give you the rates and residual.  Basically, (Sale Price - Residual) is your purchase amount (depending on state, you may have to add some taxes or fees onto this, so it won't be exact). Then subtract your downpayment from that, then calculate the loan amount over 3 years at your given interest rate.  Let's say the car has a sale price of 30k, residual of 15k. You're basically purchasing 15k, let's say there are 1k worth of taxes/fees, and your 2k down, means your financing 14k over 3 years. $475/mo comes out to 13.5% interest, which would be absurd.  I bought my GTI (~27k sale price, ~24k financed after taxes/fees/downpayment) and I'm paying about 420/mo (60mo, 1.9%). No way would I pay >$50 more a month to lease."
GolfGTI,3aq6kz,waybj,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately leases aren't that simple.  The problem is, leases include financing on the residual amount as well as the ""borrowed amount"" using a concept referred to as the money factor.  (They actually charge interest on the car's sale price PLUS the residual value). The residual value is money they are not profiting off of while it is tied up in your car, so they charge you interest on it.  So you would want to figure out the interest including the residual value.  See this article for an explanation: http://www.edmunds.com/car-leasing/calculate-your-own-lease-payment.html.    In the above example, at 3%, the lease payment should be $414.86 a month.  So $475 is high, but not that high. $475 would correspond to a 6.5% interest rate.  This is also approximate and doesn't include taxes and fees, which could cause $475 to be reasonable depending on the buyer's credit score.  Leasing should usually be cheaper than buying the same car, given the same buyer.  For a 60 month financing (or longer), buying can get to be almost as cheap or better.  I made a spreadsheet to calculate this for me which I can pull up on my phone in the showroom.  I'd be happy to send it to anyone who wants it."
GolfGTI,3aq6kz,Hewbacca,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"I just spoke with the dealer again and asked what the monthly payment for 0 down would be, he provided the below.  If you decide to take to route of locating a 15' we would be happy to pursue that option. For a  3 year lease at 15,000 miles per year and 0 down you would be in the area of $550/mo. Those numbers are using this months lease incentives on a similarly priced GTI. Let me know which option would be preferable for you.  That seems extremely high. Would you consider this to be normal? My credit is perfectly fine."
GolfGTI,3aq6kz,Hewbacca,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say.  What is the price of the car?  Chances are he is assuming full MSRP, which is part of the problem.  Everything can be negotiated.  Talk him down to 6-8% off MSRP at least, its a 2015.    Then I need to know what the residual value is to figure it out.  60% is a good rule of thumb for 12k mile leases, for 15k leases its less.  Did you ask for a 15k mile lease?  If not, 12 will be less expensive.  Assuming a $29k price, a 50% residual value ($14,500), 36 month lease at 3%, the payment comes out to $457.  There are likely other taxes and fees that are not included in that.  So $500 is probably more reasonable.  If you do go that route, I'd go in saying your budget is $475, and see if he can make $500 or so happen.  As a comparison, if the car costs $26,500 and has a 60% residual value (probably a 12k mile lease), at 3% that comes out to $347, almost $100 less.  So just by dropping the miles and negotiating the price a little, you should be able to get his number down to $450 or less.  I've found you can often do almost as good or better if you buy the car and do a 6 or 7 year loan.  That comes with its own set of risks, but might also be worth considering."
GolfGTI,3aq6kz,Janus408,3,Wed Jun 24 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"$700 down, $348 per month.  It should be around that. $400+ means you are either getting taken, or your credit rating is bad."
GolfGTI,3aq6kz,Janus408,3,Mon Jun 22 17:32:24 2015 UTC,"Then the dealer was trying to pull some bullshit with you I think. Maybe calculated for residual being much lower than it should be, or something else shady.  For a GTI with MSRP of around $29k, you should have around $13,500 in total payments (with $750 down, not $700 like I stated above) - leaving $15,500ish in residual value.   Your payments make the car $19,500 over 3 years - leaving less than $10k residual, which is way off. A SE GTI with 45k miles on it is going to be worth more than $10k in 3 years. So the dealer is trying to hose you by skewing the residual value. And again, that down payment is way too high.  The dealer is calculating the car depreciation to be like 66% in 3 years - which is not right. Try a different dealer."

GolfGTI,3ajf7l,Rellikx,3,Sat Jun 20 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"This does not void warranty, and is essentially foolproof to do.  I changed it to 5 from 3 and think its perfect.

I would also recommend R8 coils.  The factory ones are notorious for going out, and these are cheaper than factory, more reliable, look better for what that's worth, and is a super easy ""upgrade"".  I agree with water/meth being something if you wanted to upgrade more than what you're thinking about doing.  No need for it unless you're looking at upgrading more.  Your intake is going to be preferential as well.  Make sure to check if you have a secondary intake though, as when you go aftermarket, you will probably have a hose left open.  You can find a small filter to fit on the end of it though no problem.  I would save for adjustable coilovers.  Just my .02 hope it helps a little."

These help alleviate some of the problems that the stock car has when you increase power. If it's a manual, then you need to start thinking about new clutch disk and/or flywheel upgrade. A catch can maybe to be on the safe side?   Edit: Also, the HPFP (high pressure fuel pump) can have problems so keep an eye on that."

With 4 doors it's easy.  Also easier to have more than 1 extra passenger in the car.    The only ""drawback"" with 4 doors is that I believe the car is designed as a 2 door first and then the extra doors are added.  So the front doors are shorter on a 4 door than on the 2 door.  This means that my seat in the 4 door is slightly behind the pillar that separates the front and rear doors.  If it were a 2 door it'd probably be even or slightly in front of the pillar.

They offer the higher models with cloth in Canada so maybe some have leaked through to the US market like the S's with DCC.  That'd probably be your best bet to get a sunroof + cloth.  Either that or get an SE to get the sunroof and then trade your leather seats to someone that has an S?  You can go on sites like VWVortex and post in their classifieds section that you're looking to swap interiors.  Or check junk yards for totaled ones.    If it matters - I went with the SE model to get the sunroof because I had a sunroof in my previous car and enjoyed it, plus I think it makes the car look cooler (unless you have black, then it blends in).  That said, from the outside it appears to be huge, but when you open it and view it from the inside it's about the same size as any other cars sunroof which was a bit of a letdown.  Also, as cool as I think the plaid interior is, I felt like the leather was more adult-like."

From what I've heard, intakes have a minimal performance effect on GTI due to the turbo.  Mostly people get a new intake to increase/alter the turbo noise.  Based on that, I would assume an air filter would also have a fairly low amount of impact."
GolfGTI,3aaj56,fish_dog_head,4,Thu Jun 18 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"Intakes have an impact due to the Turbo getting more air. But I think the way you were saying it, was that adding an intake wouldn't benefit much. Which, I agree. Manufacturers have pretty much ""perfected"" an intake for a turbocharged car. The benefit of an aftermarket intake is noise, and a slighttt more air, adding maybe one or two hp/lb. Increase in throttle response might come, but could be placebo.   When tuning, an intake is preferred so that you can custom tune it to how much air is being thrown into the engine."

GolfGTI,3aaj56,noroom,2,Fri Jun 19 05:24:46 2015 UTC,Just go with a stock MANN filter. Filters and even cold air intakes do next to nothing in terms of performance gains for a turbo engine as the air will still be hot when it comes out of the turbo. A nice big intercooler will be the only way to get any real gains (besides tunes of course).

Needless to say I just ordered an intake that should give a 10hp boost in the upper rev range with my tune, but even having seen a dyno sheet I don't expect much."

The ecu is designed to change what its doing to maintain stock performance. If your air filter is clean then don't worry about it unless you want that blow off noise, or you are getting the car tuned."

Honestly, there is no real noticeable performance gain till you get a tune which makes the most of the extra air flow.

The dealership I was at also had a college grad promotion where they would pay the first payment. Since I graduated last year, they let me do it.   I'll tell you that the price of my GTI was 30200. 4 year lease 10k miles. Reason why I did that was because they got my monthly payment down to what I said I could pay.

I get away with checking mine every 15k-20k, and end up replacing it while I have it out. Usually not much wear though, for me. It's extremely important to check it, however.   If your intake cam lobe wears through the cam follower you'll probably end up with a big bill for a new cam, follower, and fuel pump. Maybe others..  Stay on top of it. If you check on it/have dealer check it, and change when needed you'll be okay. If you ignore it, prepare yourself."

I didn't want to have to pay for that pricey timing belt/water pump change that was about due either. The GTI is a lot more quiet on the road IMO, but that's comparing an 8 year old vehicle to a brand new one. And I love having the same amount of HP in a car that's a fraction of the weight. If I had the money I would've bought another new A4, but with a wedding on the way it was out of the question. You'll love either one. German engineering FTW!"

GolfGTI,3a37fv,alternativesurfer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:40:02 2015 UTC,My MK6 Golf went 32k miles on the same pair of tires before I traded it in for my MK7 and still had at least another 10k in them.  Granted they were some shitty Continental economy tires and not Pirelli's or Bridgestones.
GolfGTI,3a37fv,helmetsmash,2,Tue Jun 16 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's perfectly reasonable."
GolfGTI,3a37fv,phantomtofu,2,Tue Jun 16 22:09:22 2015 UTC,I'll chime in with another MK6 anecdote; my stock Pirellis are at 34k and I intend to use them until I put my winters on in 5 months or so.
GolfGTI,3a37fv,superspeck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"I switched the stock perellis out at 34k after buying the car at 32k. I'm at 44k and seem to be about 2/3 of the way through the Michelin Pilot Super Sports that I put on.   90% of my driving is on city surface streets, I rarely leave traction control enabled, and I sort of have a tendency to flog it, so I wouldn't take my tire wear as normal. I'm probably more along the lines of the top ten percent of tire usage, and everyone who uses tires worse than I do spends more time on the track."
GolfGTI,3a0ca6,jisforjoe,2,Tue Jun 16 06:02:30 2015 UTC,what made you pick red?
GolfGTI,3a0ca6,d0gbals,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:13:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP, but I have a red one.  I just like it better than the other colors available.  The blue is nothing special to me.  The white is bland.  The black is cool, but black shows dirt super easy and I live in a hot area as is which will just be even worse in a black car.  Silver is OK.  Red looks good and doesn't show dirt that easily.    Although sometimes I do wish I had picked black.  The red accents really stand out against the black.  On the red car everything is red so things get lost.  On black the side badges, stripe in the headlights, exhaust pipes, taillights, etc. all stand out more than they do on a red car.    That said - if Limestone Gray Metallic was available in the US I think I would have picked it.  I like how it looks like different colors depending on the lighting/angles.  None of the other colors do that."

For winter wheels, get yourself of wheels from craigslist, VWVortex Forums, ebay, etc and then get some rubber from tire rack.

GolfGTI,3a0lib,Rellikx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:52:10 2015 UTC,"What? Why would you expect your alarm to go off just because someone pulled the handle? That's going to be you pretty often when you forget to unlock the car. As long as they don't open the door, who cares if someone tries the handle?  It's a basic alarm - it goes off when a door is opened if the alarm is armed. There is no broken glass sensor or interior proximity sensor - those are notorious for setting off false alarms.  Why would you buy an aftermarket system? It does exactly what it needs to. What else do you think is necessary? Also, the computer will not let the car start unless it recognizes your RFID chipped key. It's incredibly hard to steal a modern vehicle."
GolfGTI,3a0lib,juaquin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:02:23 2015 UTC,with new cars you're more likely to get car jacked than for anyone to try and steal the car because of what everyone else is saying about the chipped key
GolfGTI,3a0lib,lykos11,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"If the car is locked and I try to open it from the outside the alarm won't go off.   Well, yea. If you try to open your house door and it's locked, your house alarm won't go off. If you try to enter a business after it's closed, its alarm won't go off (unless you succeed).  In terms of stealing the car, unlikely. If it's not civic, camry, F-150, it's not very high on the list of cars to steal. That, and the standard security and lockout features are pretty advanced. Might still get robbed though.  In past models, I don't believe broken glass caused an alarm to go off. I know it didn't on my Mk4."

GolfGTI,39x9dw,herbalblend,24,Mon Jun 15 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"I used to be an installer at Safelite. I've certainly seen plenty of new windshields on high-end cars run above the thousand dollar mark.   Was that for OEM glass? If so, that's a pretty reasonable price from what I've seen.   As far as aftermarket brands go, try and stick to Pilkington, PGW, PPG, and even the Safelite-brand glass, SGC, is very good in my experience. You want to stay away from FY (Fuyao) and XYG. VERY cheaply made, tons of defects, poor fitment, just a nightmare.   Also, if it's OEM, make sure it's still wrapped when they bring it to you. If it's not, that's a dead giveaway of something fishy. And make sure it has the same markings as your current windshield. Should have a small VW/Audi logo and the brand should be Saint Gobain-Sekurit, if I recall."

GolfGTI,39x9dw,ArtistApart,10,Tue Jun 16 02:53:19 2015 UTC,"I've been through 2 windshields on my 2015 already- luckily my insurance covers windshield at no deductible.  However, the first time I had to drive around with a shattered windshield for 10 days before State Farm figured out there is no aftermarket part available and its unique to that vehicle only.   So, basically you're only getting OEM on a limited part- that would explain the cost."
GolfGTI,39x9dw,ArtistApart,2,Mon Jun 15 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"I drive about 60k miles a year, it's pretty common, especially in upstate NY, and CT"

GolfGTI,39x9dw,ArtistApart,4,Mon Jun 15 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"Yes it's a mk7, 32k miles as of this morning.   As for reliability I may be the wrong person to ask for a few reasons, it's almost all highway miles, but mine had a major warranty issue when I first bought it, so i was in loaner cars for 3 months while VW got it sorted out. They ended up giving me a cash settlement and extending my warranty. That's the tl;dr- details below.   However, SINCE that, I haven't had any issues. No check engine lights, no stalls or anything.  The DSG is significantly more sluggish than my 2011 before this, and the ride is not nearly as smooth as my Mk6 (which sucks long distance).  But the agility, pickup and options are significantly improved, it had some cold start sluggish feelings in the winter- so I'll have them check that at next oil change, but I may just be sensitive to this car.    Longer Warranty issues: car had a vibration at 70-75mph. Like... Spill coffee bad.  I took it in every weekend for them to tell me it was fixed when it wasn't.  They put me in loaners when I got insistent on the matter.  They performed/replaced: the transmission, the front axel, the wheel barring, and... Something else that escapes me now (sorry- I'm not a car guy).  All these parts needed to be special ordered (I bought in sept). By December I invoked lemon law.  After dealing with the company that handles customers issues (no VW- this is some ridiculous middle man company) I started blasting emails. During all this, they actually fixed it right after Christmas (it was the part that connects the wheel to the axel).    I told them I want the new car I'm entitled to by law, because I had no reason to have faith in this one.  VW head office called me and offered my fixed car back and a check for 12 months of payments.  I declined and said I needed an extended warranty in writing to go with that.  We eventually settled on the extended warranty and 9 months of payments (which actually worked out better for me, because I had already had this vehicle tinted and the headlights upgraded.)"

GolfGTI,39xdzk,yidavs,2,Mon Jun 15 16:04:29 2015 UTC,Make sure the strut pucks have been removed apparently many dealers forget to remove them when they transport the cars
GolfGTI,39xdzk,rajavoce,0,Mon Jun 15 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"Should have mentioned that I have already checked this, well, I should say I checked the fronts since I dont think they put shipping pucks in the rears."
GolfGTI,39xdzk,bellboy18,2,Mon Jun 15 18:15:24 2015 UTC,They put them in the rear as well
GolfGTI,39xdzk,bellboy18,-1,Mon Jun 15 18:57:19 2015 UTC,Are you absolutely positive? Because from everything I have read on forums and such they are only on the fronts.
GolfGTI,39xdzk,bellboy18,2,Mon Jun 15 19:12:38 2015 UTC,I've seen people post pictures of four pucks each from one corner of the car. So yeah.
GolfGTI,39xdzk,ColonelAdama,-1,Mon Jun 15 19:21:47 2015 UTC,Source please? Because I havent been able to find any evidence of this. Also the rear strut design doesnt seem to have anywhere to hide a set of pucks since the spring and the shock are separate.

GolfGTI,39xyog,zed0K,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"It's more about having to also order the SE trim with performance package before even being able to spec DCC,.. I don't mind the performance package, but don't need the things that the SE trim comes with .  I did test drive a DCC equipped car and checkout the various settings but not on the same day as I drove the base non DCC car. Honestly ,I couldn't make out much difference but maybe I wasn't tuned in to the car enough  Which is why I'm  interested in what others have to say Thanks"
GolfGTI,39xyog,zed0K,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"No problemo. You will notice it for sure once you are use to the car. That being said, the PP is good for the LSD but again, no daily driving benefit. Bigger brake kit is nice, but you could get almost the same performance for less money. Regardless of what you choose to do, the car is great and you'll love it once you buy one!"
GolfGTI,39xyog,derekson,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"If you're already going to get an SE w/PP then paying $800 extra for DCC seems like a good move, but if you don't really want SE or don't want PP otherwise then it's a lot to pay if DCC is what you're really after.  Several S models w/PP were produced with DCC even though the combo wasn't on the order sheets, maybe if you can find one of those you'd get exactly what you're after?"
GolfGTI,39xyog,Tkoo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:15:53 2015 UTC,True. It's finding one of these rare cars that seems to be the issue. Dealers only seem interested in pushing what's on their lots
GolfGTI,39xyog,sbujrb,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:30:26 2015 UTC,"Would loved to have gotten one with DCC. Currently driving a SE with PP, DAP and LP. I would swap the DAP for DCC in a heartbeat as the DAP is giving me more headaches than helping but finding the 4 door DSG in pure white was a challenge in itself so I bought it while I could. Too impatient to order :)  The ride is a bit harsh at times and I do a 5 hour commute every weekend and had my butt go a bit numb :|"
GolfGTI,39wtgo,atom808,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:17:01 2015 UTC,"The stock cat back is a pretty good exhaust at 2.5"" piping. The biggest restriction in these cars is the cat so whatever dp you get consider that you get what you pay for. Pretty much you need to buy a good dp to make it perform better than the stock one. The tsi downpipe is suppose to flow pretty well. I'm in the same boat as you and after a lot of reading have concluded not to get a cheap down pipe. You will probably get a little performance increase without changing the tune, but you will still be peaking at the same amount of boost. My advice on the clutch is be prepared. The clutch may be ok, it may not. You are right around the max for it."
GolfGTI,39wtgo,rocksauce,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"I'm running the full eurojet turboback with no cat and eurojet cbe. I live in the bay area and haven't had any issues with my exhaust. Since most mustang's with magnaflow exhausts are louder than me with no cat, I don't get any trouble.   If you wanted exhaust tone that was variable, I definitely say go with Eurojet. That way you can swap in and out a catalytic converter as you please, as its v-band clamps holding it in. Very useful and sounds really good. With the catalytic converter in I get no highway drone at all"
GolfGTI,39wtgo,bellboy18,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"Cat back exhaust will give you a louder sounding exhaust but minimal performance gains as the stock CBE is already quite good, respectively.  Getting a down pipe exhaust will give you huge gains (in comparison to your carbonio intake).  If you decide to just get a DP your car will throw a CEL because the cat will be different, generally providing better flow and therefore triggering the CEL.  You can overcome this by getting an O2 spacer which won't trigger the CEL or getting your car retuned which will solve this and also give you the maximum gains from the DP.  It's generally cheaper to get a non-APR exhaust and pay for the extra to retune your car then to buy an APR branded one with a free stage 2 upgrade.  It will give you more flexibility in what you want in an exhaust as well.  I personally went with a 3"" ceramic coated 42DD down pipe and kept the stock cat back so it wouldn't be much louder.  It is louder than stock but not overly loud to the point where I draw attention.  HP and torque gain was the biggest factor here and I'm also running APR stage 2."
GolfGTI,39wtgo,bwenstar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I decided to take the risk and get a 42DD dp and go stage 2 and see how my stock clutch holds up. Few questions, how much does it cost to get my ecu reflashed from apr to get from stg 1 to stg 2? Do I need anything else to have the 42DD dp fit with my stock CAT? R8 coil pack necessary for stage 2?"
GolfGTI,39wtgo,bwenstar,2,Tue Jun 23 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"Not exact sure on the cost for reflashing your car sorry.  I live in Australia and we have Australia tax which makes everything twice as expensive.  I think when I upgraded it was around $295 or something.  This cost was waivered for me as I also purchased their VWRacing intake as well.   It should bolt up directly no need for adapters etc.  There should be guides online on how to do it properly if you don't have much experience in doing so.  Again I'm in a MKV GTI so it might be slightly different but in a sense still similar.  There are discussions about the R8 coilpacks vs. stock, discussion here: http://www.golfmkv.com/forums/showthread.php?t=183710 Basically how I look at it, the upgraded coilpacks look better, cheap replacement upgrade and if I'm running more power than stock paying $70 odd isn't a huge hit on the wallet.  I'm running a K04 on my FSI with bolt ons so I took precautionary measures when modifying it.  This included an oil catch can, upgraded DV etc. (again people argue whether it's all worth it vs. cost) but to me if it causes no deteriment to my car and even if there's a minute increase in reliability/peace of mind, that's good enough for me.    Stage 2 MKVI GTI would be plenty (before doing any serious mods) and you should have an immense amount of fun with the DP installed!"
GolfGTI,39wtgo,bwenstar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"In no way I'm a car mechanic so I'd have to ask a shop to get my dp installed. I will most likely get the r8 coil installed as well just to get a peace of mind. I'm looking at the 42dd website right now and they have few options I can select like street series or race series, resonated or not, and stainless steel or stainless steel with vband flanges. Any these upgrades necessary? Wondering if I should find a dp second handed or not"

GolfGTI,39jlho,Awake00,3,Sun Jun 14 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"Don't get Autobahn just for the sound system.  You can purchase OEM looking headunits for pretty cheap that retain all OEM functionality (reverse cam, steeringwheel buttons, parking sensors, etc) + more.  These seem to cost around 300-400 and are pretty awesome.  Have you been in both to compare the sound?  I couldn't really tell any difference, but I am not an audiophile by any means."
GolfGTI,39jlho,Rellikx,0,Fri Jun 12 11:29:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I have nice headphones and speakers at home but my GTI has the regular sound system. In a noisy environment (car driving down a road) I don't think there's a significant difference - I wouldn't buy a car just for that. If you like the other stuff that comes in the Autobahn, go for it, just saying that the sound system isn't a big deal.  Personally, I would make the decision based on manual vs DSG. OP, you have to decide which is the better transmission for you, and not just based on having to learn - do you commute in traffic? Will someone else who can't drive stick need to drive the car? Are you interested in learning? Etc. To me, that's the biggest difference between the two."
GolfGTI,39jlho,juaquin,3,Fri Jun 12 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Tough decision. You can learn manual pretty easily, I wouldn't worry about it. If you are planning to tune, then DSG may be better because stage 2 the clutch will likely fail on Manual and you're looking at ~$1,500 (includes labor). As far as Dynaudio, it is a nice system, but the Kessy is also awesome! I never really take my keys out of my pockets when I approach my car, its great. What are the color choices btw? You have to get a color you like."
GolfGTI,39jlho,cevil203,2,Fri Jun 12 14:41:02 2015 UTC,Id take the autobahn. The manual is pretty easy to learn you'll be driving fine after like 3-4 days.  Plus you get a lot more than just dynaudio

GolfGTI,39jlho,damnyou777,2,Fri Jun 12 06:17:20 2015 UTC,"I would buy the manual but that's my specific preference. My first car was a manual 19 years ago, then I spent the last 15 years in automatic. When I bought my first GTI 2 months ago I specifically shopped for a manual and this is the most fun I've ever had driving; I'm so, so happy with my choice. I even live in the city where everyone said I wouldn't want a manual and they were all wrong. Now when I get back in an automatic it just feels so bland, boring and weak. Having said that, I've never driven the DSG and I'm told it's ""just as fun"" as a manny, people say it's the best of both worlds. As far as ease of driving/learning, this is one of the smoothest, easiest manual transmissions I've ever had the pleasure of shifting. If you get the opportunity, drive a friend's manual again a few times to get the basic hang of it before you go and test drive the GTI so you can really give it fair consideration."

Scrub with a brush, rinse off Clay bar the entire car with diluted Optimum No Rinse for lubrication Wax and seal using Collinite 845   You can skip the foam gun, but you'll definitely want to use the 2 bucket system when washing every time. Clay bar and Collinite 845 will only need to be done every few months or when something bad happens. Like others said, /r/AutoDetailing is a super helpful sub complete with progress logs that can help you decide."
GolfGTI,39ia82,rajavoce,4,Fri Jun 12 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"Two bucket method at home, or go to a coin operated car wash if it's more convenient.   If you want something a little more fancy look into one of those foam gun options but their pricier."
GolfGTI,39ia82,Fox06WRX,3,Thu Jun 11 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"Do you own a pressure washer? If so, look into getting a foam cannon. Great way to wash the car without needing to touch it very much.

I highly recommend taking the old bulb out and reinstalling it a couple of times to get the feel for it before putting a new one in.  Be careful not to touch to actual bulb at all.  Like someone else said, oil can make them explode next time they heat up.    This all assumes you have HIDs by the way.  If it's just regular headlights it's super easy.

GolfGTI,39au9e,Peylix,3,Wed Jun 10 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"Super easy you don't have to open the whole panel, just two small access panels to undo the inner lights,  there's a small tab you just pull them down from  Here's a picture of that : http://i.imgur.com/aWXml9u.jpg  The outer lights you just pull back at some of the carpet. The whole thing probably takes about half an hour if you're careful and double checking everything. It probably took me closer to 45 just making sure the fitment was spot on.   We did however take off the whole panel before to do the wiper delete it wasn't that hard either."

I love mine but its been a lot of work getting it to every day reliability. Learn to drive stick and find a manual instead though. You'll have a much better time of it.
GolfGTI,39f8ud,Walbargs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:38:37 2015 UTC,How much work are we talking about?  And I do want to learn to drive stick but all of my family's cars are auto and hiring an instructor with a manual car is rather expensive so I don't really have any options to practice.
GolfGTI,39f8ud,Walbargs,4,Thu Jun 11 10:08:53 2015 UTC,I'd say a weekend out of every month spent fiddling about with something. That's the case with any old car though you've got to know what you're getting into.  It's all quite straightforward though and these are popular cars so spares and help is always available.  Stick is easy you just need to practice clutch control. I'm from uk though so everyone drives a manual.  Half the fun of these cars is keeping the engine on the boil by working the gearbox. I think you'd miss something by having the auto. It's a very different car between 4-6k rpm
GolfGTI,39f8ud,CubicleByThePrinter,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:22:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment about getting the auto. Here in Australia I don't think stick is quite as ubiquitous hah.

Yea I stalled it three times during the test drive, but I bought it anyway. I was able to pick up on it really quickly and now it's like second nature. I would be disappointed with an auto after driving manual. If you have a friend with a manual car, just spend like an hour or two starting it and driving down the street. Watching youtube videos to understand how the transmission works and people describing how to drive it also really helps."

You should be able to get something newer and more reliable for 5k (~$4k usd). The 2000 golf is a turd for 5k. If I HAD to choose between the 2, the mk2...  I don't know the market there, but in the US, you can get something better for those prices. Should be able to find a VR6 Mk4 for around 5k. May be 12v, way better whatever is in that golf."

Repair wise I've driven mine ~6k miles and have only done an oil change. I did bend a rim but that's because roads in IL suck ass.  I suggest test driving an R and putting it through its paces.

GolfGTI,39e4nn,juaquin,2,Thu Jun 11 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"The 2016's will have Android Auto / Carplay, which in my opinion is a pretty big upgrade if this is your daily driver. You're only going to use the performance for a few minutes on your commute and maybe some on the weekends - you'll be using music, maps, etc basically every day. I would go with the MK7 for that reason.  If you want more performance later, you can always tune. Reliability has never been a concern for ECU tunes before, except for coil packs (which are cheap and easily replaced with the better R8 coils) and the clutch on manual cars (not quite as cheap). And a Stage 1 Mk7 GTI makes more power than a stock Mk6 R - the new engine is a beast."

The entertainment system in the mk6 R is plenty for most people, car play and android auto is such a minor thing you could always retrofit later anyways.   I'm not knocking either car, but the R is superior to a GTI in the eyes of most people. Especially if you live where there's a lot of snow and rain where the awd would be especially helpful."

GolfGTI,39e4nn,damnyou777,2,Thu Jun 11 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"Stage 1 would honestly hardly do anything to the car. You're only changing the engine timing a little and adding a little boost. The amount of gains is well within what the engine can handle, especially on the Golf R. The Golf R comes from the factory with upgraded internals. Most tuning shops can get nearly 500hp out of it before they need to do any additional reinforcing.   I've done well over 20k miles with stage 1 and it has never caused an issue for me."
GolfGTI,39e4nn,juaquin,0,Thu Jun 11 19:03:42 2015 UTC,You void your powertrain warranty with a tune.
GolfGTI,39e4nn,damnyou777,2,Thu Jun 11 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as ""voiding a warranty"". I don't know why people still think that's a thing. The warranty covers the whole car; modifying one part of it does not void the contract.  What tuning does do is increase the chances of warranty coverage for a specific problem being declined. In this case, if your turbo blew, they might try to decline coverage for the repair under warranty. The contract is in effect, they have just decided that this incident is not covered under it. You can fight this with VWoA or in court; may or may not be worth your time. However, if your control arm snaps, they will still happily honor the warranty for that incident."
GolfGTI,39e4nn,juaquin,-1,Thu Jun 11 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, but basically anything engine related, even like the fuel parts, will not be covered."
GolfGTI,39e4nn,cjbt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"Again, that totally depends on the modifications, the tech, the service advisor, the dealer, and VW. You stated:   You void your powertrain warranty with a tune.   That statement is flat out wrong. The only way to void the warranty is with the agreement of both parties or breaking the terms of the contract (by law in the US, there is no termination of a warranty for modifications, so it is not a term)."
GolfGTI,39e4nn,damnyou777,-1,Thu Jun 11 22:48:37 2015 UTC,What I'm saying is that VW will have the right to reject your request for a repair with anything powertrain related. They will show that the problem could have been caused by the tune. There was a thread on a forum with a VW insider regarding tuning. You should go read it and see for yourself. I don't have it.
GolfGTI,39e4nn,thebbman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:56:26 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that VW will have the right to reject your request for a repair   That may be what you're trying to say, but it's not what you said. I was pointing out why what you said was wrong before someone else bought into this ""voided warranty"" bs that gets passed around. It's also not a ""right"", they can always try to deny, doesn't mean it will hold up in court."

I'm really satisifed with the fit and finish (i went with the square bars), but if you do choose the square bars be sure to dish the extra cash for the fairing. (Makes a massive difference in sound/howl over 100km/h). Not sure about the VW specific model, but my VW dealer actually recommended I pay extra and go for the Thule setup. Hope this is of some assistance!  They have a kickass website you can basically build the rack on the site, it will tell you exactly which parts you need, and install is easy as pie"
GolfGTI,39d7pt,Macgregor55,3,Thu Jun 11 01:03:21 2015 UTC,Would you recommend the square bars with the fairing or the aero?   I'm still torn between the whispbars from Yakima or the aero from Thule. But I'm not super rich and may end up with the square and fairing.

That said, I hated it before I got the fairing (drove a total of 2 days before I found a fairing nearby to go and purchase). All in, you are roughly the same cost to just bite the bullet and buy the aero bars alone vs the square+fairing, but I don't know how much better those are by comparison. I have never been in a vehicle with the aero bars."

Just the difference in mileage and noise is crazy. For my mk5 gti I went with the OEM bars with a fairing as it was the best combination of fit/ finish and price, I'm a cheap ass. I'm not a fan of the square bars I think they look old and clunky along with being loud.     The VW OEM bars are made by Thule and so they have the Thule T-bolt attachment rails on top which means no ugly straps and mounts from whatever accessory's you mount on them. I made a wooden roof rack and just used 3/8in bolts into the T-slot to mount it, looks very clean and works well.    My opinion    Aero Bars > VW OEM > square bars"

It won't make a big difference in the snow - the electronic diff in the regular car will apply the brake to the wheel that's free spinning. The real LSD is only going to make a difference in high speed cornering, not low speed snow.  If you want the performance pack and money isn't a big concern, I'd say get it, but if you're looking for somewhere to trim some budget, I'd say you can live without it.  The best way to know, of course, is to drive them.

GolfGTI,39b7f3,CrunchyBones,2,Wed Jun 10 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"Daily driving you won't notice it, because you're not operating the car in a way where the wheels would have any reason to spin. It will be better in the rain and maybe the snow.  But hit up your local winding road and you will quickly figure it out.  A lot of people disagree with me on this. My GTI is not a ""daily driver""...because I work from home and I have a truck for bad weather and errands. My GTI is for fun drives down canyon roads and like 2-3 times/week driving. That said, I cannot possibly begin to comprehend people who wouldn't get the perf package. I understand these people exist, and I'm fine with them having their opinions, and we can hang out, but for me personally -- does not compute. The LSD and the brakes are just too good."

GolfGTI,397836,thesausageprince,5,Wed Jun 10 04:31:14 2015 UTC,Our temp gauges aren't 100% accurate either. VW chose to dumb it down by leveling the needle out to 190° perfectly because they didn't want the average consumer freaking out whenever they saw any fluctuation.  Personally I love the Beetle's center mounted gauge pod. Having any type of boost gauge is still a welcome change when you consider how quiet the GTI can be sometimes (DV instead of BOV). And I honestly wouldn't mind owning a Beetle myself. Had one for a loaner and it was still a blast to drive around. The redesign also looks great IMO.

GolfGTI,395sf6,NOPEitsTuckChesta,2,Tue Jun 9 13:34:35 2015 UTC,Raceland makes a decent coilover suspension for like $350. That's if you just want to go low. Solowerks has a budget coilover suspension that won't slam your car but improve handling and retain ride comfort for $500. I know that's more than what you want to spend but it's the best budget suspension I can think of. Or you can search around some forms for a used set.
GolfGTI,395sf6,Screaming_Silence,3,Tue Jun 9 18:31:46 2015 UTC,"Op, put aside a bit more too. Strut mounts, sway bar bushings, the rods etc may need some replacing on a car of that age. Look at engine, trans mounts while down there"

GolfGTI,395sf6,dLuR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:57:30 2015 UTC,Cheapish coils. If you get springs you spend more or the same as a decent set of coils once you replace all the shit that is bad or is going to go bad soon. Plus once you lower it it will never be low enough and this way you can slam that shit

GolfGTI,39484x,wolfenkraft,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:56:37 2015 UTC,"I think the system where the car parks itself is ""Park Assist"", while ""Park Pilot"" is just a specific function of the parking sensors.

Here's info from the UK VW site about Park Assist: http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/technology/parking-and-manoeuvring/park-assist  And you can see on the parking sensor page that the onscreen display showing the sensor system is called ParkPilot: http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/technology/parking-and-manoeuvring/parking-sensors"

Contrary to the thought that it's like hitting a wall at 80mph, both cars absorb their share (half) of the impact and the effect is just like hitting something stationary at 40. I think Mythbusters did an episode on this."

GolfGTI,3902f5,mmiski,3,Mon Jun 8 13:20:25 2015 UTC,Headrests are mostly for rear impact. Helping avoid whiplash from your head flinging rearward.
GolfGTI,3902f5,element515,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that the Beetle has the same steering wheel shape (and presumably same airbag since it's also assembled in Mexico), but it got a ""marginal"" rating instead because of how the head took a glancing blow to the airbag before hitting the dashboard trim. I'm wondering if they can get the same thing to happen with the GTI under the right circumstances with multiple test runs.  By comparison the Mk6's steering wheel airbag seems to cover a slightly larger area. Not trying to turn this into a flamewar btw. Just curious as to whether the new (more circular) steering wheel shape maybe compromises the size and shape of the airbag more. Although I'm sure the Mk7 no doubt has way better structural rigidity along the A-pillar since the small overlap test only became a big thing until recently. So there should at least be less cabin intrusion."
GolfGTI,3902f5,fts902,2,Mon Jun 8 13:34:02 2015 UTC,"Head sliding to the side is a failure of the seatbelt to restrain the body from twisting to the side. A larger airbag would help, but the big thing is the seatbelt. The beetle also doesn't have curtin airbags that help in this situation. All in all, that is one of the worst front on collisions you can get. It's a newer test and many cars do terrible including some BMWs."

GolfGTI,3902f5,fts902,2,Mon Jun 8 18:15:53 2015 UTC,"Didn't say you can not survive, but it's a hard test. This test involves a crash head on to the front quarter or third of the car. Usually, the front crash structure doesn't extend that far plus the front wheel can be pushed into the passenger compartment. There's tons of variables. Just because your dad is fine, doesn't mean the design is solid. It's just pushing safety standards further. All newer models of cars are doing well in this test now because they are designed to handle it."

GolfGTI,3902f5,mmiski,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:56:13 2015 UTC,You're also comparing a 40% overlap with a ~20% overlap test. The physics are different between the two.
GolfGTI,3902f5,Noone666,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:22:35 2015 UTC,I know the crash tests are different. It was more of a comparison of airbag size/shape. You can clearly see that the Mk6 has a bigger one.

GolfGTI,3902f5,Noone666,3,Mon Jun 8 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"The North American spec Mk7 Golf R will be imported from Germany.  I've owned Mexican built cars before and honestly I haven't had any major problems with them. Also my 2014 Wolfsburg Edition GTI (built in Wolfsburg) had its own build quality issues the moment I drove it off the lot. None of them were super serious, but they were still annoying nonetheless...  The Bluetooth button cluster in front of the sunglasses holder was installed cock-eyed. Being somewhat OCD this annoyed me to the point where I took it to the dealership to have it popped in place so it would sit flush.  The compass module was also installed completely backwards. It gave me opposite direction readings despite my efforts to calibrate it. Dealership fixed that also by pulling the rear headliner down and re-orienting it.  The passenger side window also pops up about a 1/4"" higher than the driver side when I use the one-touch down feature. I let that one slide since I didn't want them disassembling the door."

GolfGTI,3925lk,JaisBit,2,Mon Jun 8 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely check your oil. It could just be that your car has burned off some oil, and that's why the computer is telling you you're due for a service.   My 2015 GTI is at a little over 5,000 miles, and I went ahead and changed my oil yesterday, rather than wait for the 10,000 mile interval. I'm getting a sample of my old oil analyzed to determine whether it could have safely run for another 5,000, so that I'll have a better idea of how often I should change it in the future."

GolfGTI,38xpnn,airjordanc,2,Mon Jun 8 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"Price is kinda high for the mileage. But if you decide to go through with it, tell them you're not going to buy the car unless they remove that fucking badge they put in on the rear hatch."
GolfGTI,38xpnn,rbuicki,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm good with the pricing and could probably get them down to 16500, just wondering from a reliablity standpoint as it has 50k and is 4 years old."
GolfGTI,38xpnn,rbuicki,3,Sun Jun 7 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"I have a 2012 GLI which is a GTI in sedan form. It has 65k miles now, and has been relatively reliable. All I have replaced are coil packs and the PCV. Other than that, it has been super reliable. I may have to do my water pump soon, however. In GTI's, the water pump seems to go out sooner than GLI's, but with the GTI at that mileage, i'm sure it's gone out already and been replaced by now. Mine isn't a DSG though, I have a 6 speed manual. I am not too sure about DSG reliability, but I know that it has been greatly improved from the 2006-2010 DSG transmissions."
GolfGTI,38xpnn,TheTallRussian,3,Sun Jun 7 20:58:51 2015 UTC,Owner of a 2008 gti here. Just clicked over 90k. Dsg is running great. Changed the fluid and filter last week. Fluid came out very clean. Runs great.  I have had to replace my diverter valve with a GFB dv+ because my diaphragm tore. Common known issue with earlier cars.  Other than that it's been nice and reliable. (Oh yeah also FSI engine)
GolfGTI,38xpnn,Rellikx,2,Sun Jun 7 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"6 months ago, I purchased my 2012 GTI (10k miles) with CPO for 18.5k OTD.  Definitely try to haggle down.  Since it is at 50k, ensure that the DSG flush was performed at 40k.  Someone on here recently purchased one at around 50k and then found that the trany wasnt flushed"
GolfGTI,38xpnn,iHateMyUserName2,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"50k and you're worried about reliability? Seriously? 150k, sure. If you get it, got the DSG oil changed unless you have proof that it was done then do the cam follower (if necessary)."
GolfGTI,38xpnn,iHateMyUserName2,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:00:14 2015 UTC,"Not really worried about the cars reliability but the owner maintenance, I know how temperamental these cars can be when not following the recommended maintenance schedule (unlike jap cars) which is why I was drawn to this particular one.  Owned a B5 passat 1.8t years back and that thing was a disaster, previous owner didn't really take care of it and I was left with the aftermath, engine sludge, control arms, MAF etc."
GolfGTI,38xpnn,rajavoce,2,Sun Jun 7 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"Again I have to disagree in this case. Prior to 50k you've only got DSG fluid. All the other crap other than engine oil or an air filter is just extras at best. These things aren't temperamental, they're machines. When a MAF gets dirt in it, it gets clogged. When the oil doesn't get changed, you have sludge build up, simple as that. Just because they're German doesn't mean they need any special treatment. I'm sure you'll be fine.  Edit: not trying to be harsh, but I'm tired of seeing the constant ""well it's German so_____""  and usually it's followed with they cost more to fix or they need more maintenance. No,  they're just the same as anything else- if you keep up with it, chances are it'll be fine just the same with any other car."

GolfGTI,38xpnn,Ze1612,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:03:21 2015 UTC,"Hey howitzer, from a reliability standpoint the Mk6 is pretty good as far as German autos go.  I suggest you do some research on their water pump issues and symptoms, as well as look into making sure the DSG tranny has been well maintained.  You should be looking to get that price down, my 2012 Manual I got for 16k OTD with 45k miles on it with a pristine carfax.  The drivetrain is fantastic and well documented as it is a popular one to mod so most of the maintenance has DIY guides done for you on vortex and golfmk6 forums.  To give you an idea, there are guys who mod the hell out of these Mk6 to run 10s quarter mile with the stock transmission :p  Make sure she's well taken care of and get the price down and you'll have a keeper!"

My guess would be either a faulty switch for the horn or a bad clock spring. Getting a VCDS scan should help you narrow it down. Any major VW/Audi shop should have one, or you can check http://www.maptive.com/ver3/VCDS_Locator to see if you can find someone in your area to bring one by."

GolfGTI,38utl0,Tobaccula,3,Sun Jun 7 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"Do you have vcds? If so, you should run a log of block 115 of the engine, it will show requested and actual boost, do a WOT pull in 3rd gear. Look at the log and see if the car is requesting more than 10 psi and you just aren't getting it. Doesn't sound like an n75 issue, but I guess I wouldn't rule it out, you could also try the technical 1.8t thread on vortex, usually get smart people there. Good Luck."

GolfGTI,38so4x,ImperatorFeles,3,Sat Jun 6 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"You could plastidip your wheels as a solution and when you go to get them repaired, peel the dip off."
GolfGTI,38so4x,pauljordanvan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"I second this, plastidip is a cheap, non-permanent, solution that would work well here and make your wheels look much better."
GolfGTI,38so4x,bassmanbob,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:21:45 2015 UTC,"True metallic would probably be the way to go, if you want that oem look. They make an aluminum version now specifically for this issue(curbing rims). https://www.dipyourcar.com/True-Metallic-Wheel-Kit.html  This is very dependent on your feeling about plastidip, but would be the most cost effective solution. I had a set of winter rims I dipped black and they lasted though 6 years of winters, car washes, salt, and snow.  You could also look for mobile rim repair places near you, or ask a car dealership who they use. I went this route years ago for a rim I curbed and I was totally satisfied with the repair. Or buy a used rim someone is selling."
GolfGTI,38so4x,TheMantelope,3,Sun Jun 7 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"Aluminum doesn't really corrode the same way steel does.  An oxide film is formed immediately upon exposure to oxygen, once that occurs it serves as a protective layer stopping further corrosion. I am an engineer so I understand materials pretty well, aside from looking ugly your wheels should be fine, don't worry I got some curb rash on my Detroits as well."
GolfGTI,38so4x,dubbl_bubbl,2,Sat Jun 6 18:28:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not overly concerned about cosmetics. It bothers me that it looks like that which is why I want to have it fixed but if it's not doing any lasting damage I don't mind leaving it for a few more months. Thanks for the info
GolfGTI,38so4x,dubbl_bubbl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Aluminum oxide is very durable & protective, Anodizing is actually an artificial way of growing the oxide layer thicker than it would be in normal circumstances, the whole dye process is actually not required and a separate thing.  The only thing is that after awhile the oxide layer will start to look dull, which is why there is a clearcoat on the rims it is to keep them shiny, that is about it.  I sprayed the face of my rims with plastidip and it looked pretty good, its starting to peel so I will probably look at getting them powdercoated in the winter."

For me (manual Mk6 presently 55k mi), I put the car into neutral, engage the E-brake, wait 5-10s or until I feel the car ""fall back"" onto the rest point of the E-brake (you will only usually feel this as a noticeable jerk on an incline which is why if it's a flat surface I wait 5-10s), and then put it into first, key to off, and clutch out.  It's my hunch that drivers whom let the car fall back onto first gear damage the tensioner (if you look at how the mechanism works, maybe you can agree)."

GolfGTI,38rx22,CrunchyBones,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"But then your insurance company knows about the damage. They'll either make you fix it and provide them with proof or have you sign a waiver saying that you can't claim the damage at a later date.  If you have a loan out for the car, the bank will be rather upset that you're devaluing their asset and might force you to fix it as well. That's why they force you to carry full coverage."

GolfGTI,38rx22,shvndrgn,2,Sun Jun 7 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"Crunchy's right here. If your deducible is only $500, likely any body panel that needs to be repainted will come to out more than that.

GolfGTI,38luc1,jgebelein,2,Sat Jun 6 20:18:58 2015 UTC,Used their instructions and it took us a little under an hour.  Removing the stock side arm was the trickiest part.  There's not a lot of clearance between the slot where the arm goes and the sidewall underneath the battery.  So to pull it out required me to push the stock assembly with the counterweight down and back.  That let me rotate the arm far enough back that I could get the clearance I needed.

GolfGTI,38memd,aMiracleAtJordanHare,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:47:07 2015 UTC,What made you decide to make the switch?
GolfGTI,38memd,aMiracleAtJordanHare,6,Fri Jun 5 05:57:50 2015 UTC,"A few reasons:   Mini is no longer the fun spirited car maker that makes small performance cars with personality. They make a car for as many people as the can cram into a seat. I understand why, i would too if I were them because it's good for the bottom line.  Because of #1 the community is dead. It used to be unique to own a mini. We all used to wave and smile and talk about our cars. I counted 172 waves from me before I got a response. If the community is dead then I felt so was my loyalty.  The dealer does not care any longer. The front does not employ sales people who know anything about the car, not one of them could help with keeping me at mini instead of going VW and the service department has terrible follow up, plus no car wash. What happened to the mini touch that I remembered? No aftermarket support from mini. The company is as far from mod friendly as possible. With the gen1 cars there were not enough of them on the road to get performance companies to invest enough money and time to create a solid performance mod range for the car (there were a few, but it either felt like significant performance was left untouched, or reliability went to hell.) Mini's reliability is not good and my warranty ran out last month. Last weekend I began hearing to end noise. A bad sign.  There are several cars in the subcompact / hot hatch segment that compete with mini.  The back seat is tiny and the ride is harsh. Roads in Denver suck and the potholes made me feel like I was taking my life in my hands. I was surprised I had not cracked a rim.    If the company no longer is excited about the cars and they are just a profit machine that has wheels and an engine, then I can look at other things to do the same thing.  I looked at the Ford Focus st, mazdaspeed 3, wrx, gti, fiat 500 abarth, mini f56, to find a replacement for the mini.   Mini f56 - it's a mini with all the mini bits replaced with Bmw bits. Feels quicker than the r56, but no more comfortable, it's expensive and not as fast as the mkvii. Back seat is still worthless.  Wrx- great performance. No more hatchback. Used cars hard to find and generally ridden hard. Cheap feeling. The wrx, ford and Mazda feel like you could scratch the paint and see the coca cola logo underneath. The wrx would leave me always wishing I bought an sti which is not in the same price range.  Mazdaspeed 3. Great car. Used only. Cheap interior and massive torque steer. Harsh ride. Focus st- good price, quick car. Right amount of space. I like the look better than the wrx or Mazda. However the interior is cheap again.  Gti - this is what I went with so I have the best to say about it. I also spent the most time test driving them. Well built. The back seat is really usable. The car is comfortable and you can tell it is the same company that makes Audi. The interior is well insulated, seats are comfortable driving position is placed right and has just enough adjustment to get perfectly situated. Windscreen (windshield) is a great size. Nice and large with the right amount of curve to give you a great field of view. The hood slopes a bit too much, you need to know where your corners are. The handling is great, but far from the wow that is the mini, same with the brakes. The mini brakes were firmer and instant. The rear seat is excellent. Had 3 200+ lb guys in it on day two.  Has a good sized trunk (compared to the mini). The dsg transmission is perfect for me. Reliable and quick, but great for traffic. Can handle more power than the manual and supported for modding the car (the minis was not). The mkvi vs mkvii:  the 7 is an all around nicer car. More power, slightly larger interior and quite a bit nicer too. But it was more money and the first U.S. Year for that model. The mkvi hit all my check boxes and for a lot less money."

GolfGTI,38memd,caught_undertow,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"It was better, but not great. Far better than Ford in the 2000-2005 years when parts fell off on their own.

If your radio takes a shit and you have a stage 1 tune, you should be fine. However if your spark plugs catch fire or your fuel pump explodes, well, yea they can say it was the tune and not put it through the warranty. And then you'd have to pay out of pocket."
GolfGTI,38lxcb,RazerHail,3,Fri Jun 5 04:34:07 2015 UTC,Depends on your dealership and whether they will work with you to prevent it. But yes in general it will flag TD1 if it's connected and will void warranty.
GolfGTI,38lxcb,impruv,2,Fri Jun 5 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, there is no ""voiding"" a warranty. The warranty exists for the full length. The question is whether a specific service will be covered under warranty.   If you've tuned your engine and your turbo explodes, there's a good chance that they're going to deny that warranty claim because you have modified that system. You can fight them over it, but it's going to be a lot of work and you may not end up winning anyways.   On the other hand, if your control arms snaps, they shouldn't give you any issue. The warranty is still in effect and they have no ground to stand on for denying that warranty claim.  With a MkVII, I would probably wait a year or two until they shake out the issues in that car.

GolfGTI,38lxcb,Pass1veJ,3,Fri Jun 5 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"Here's another way to look at it. Don't mod if you can't afford to fix outside of warranty.  Will they always decline you? Absolutely not. Lots of dealerships probably won't sweat it. Some will.   What's going to go wrong first if you mod? Well, the water pump is a probable one. That's not terribly expensive. The brakes and tires and clutch are consumables. Anything else starts becoming a bit more major.   You need to decide if that's worth it to you. Do you put on a lot of miles? Maybe it pays to be safe. Then again maybe that means you're missing out on a daily basis. Do you keep an emergency fund? Maybe that makes it worth the risk.   I personally drove 1 year stock and now a year and a half stage 1. I'm low miles and no issues at all. No regrets with stage 1. If I bought a new MK7 to replace my MK6, I'd chip it right off the lot.  YMMV"
GolfGTI,38ku7k,my2ndaccct,5,Thu Jun 4 21:32:08 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind you are buying a over ten year old car.  With that in mind then you should expect normal keep up w/ this car and a small amount more since Vws don't age to gracefully.  My 1.8T was a love/hate relationship but it never left me stranded and the engine itself was solid w/ no issues at all.  It did have many boost leaks, oil leaks (valve cover gasket - expected on this engine), vacuum leaks, failing sensors, cracked hoses, cracked coolant plumbing, common coil packs outings & pooling oil in the boost plumbing.  It was at the point where I was replacing something monthly but as I said it never left me stranded.  Many say the 1.8T is a pain and is one of the worst examples of a German engine.  I highly disagree, with the right tools this car was no harder to work on than a v6 Accord or Camry but then I am a little mechanically inclined and I can follow DYIs all day.  I got it tuned @ 41k when I got it, went to 122k and the only issue it developed was the turbo seals started to fail (which is a bit expected w/ a tune).  The person I know bought that car off of me and replaced the turbo, she is running strong to this day.  I did it the right way though, any issues I stayed on top of and if there was a problem I addressed it the smart way and basically right away.  I also stayed on top of fluid flushes and the like and making sure she was topped off."
GolfGTI,38ku7k,akrazyazzho,2,Thu Jun 4 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I don't mind sinking some money into upkeep/repairs but don't really want to push over $1.5k initially. The replacing things monthly doesn't sound appealing obviously, but it won't be a DD anyway. I guess I'll have to just check it out in person and see what needs to be done."
GolfGTI,38ku7k,jtm141990,2,Thu Jun 4 22:43:38 2015 UTC,"9 months on my '02 1.8T and I've had issues. Broken tie rod, torn CV boot, worn control arm bushings, dead radiator fan, failed ignition mechanism, dead alternator, clogged catalytic converter, cracked coolant flange, lots of cracked hosing, and a few other small issues.   Previous owner did the timing belt but tires, brakes, fluids all neglected. Check for maintenance/functionality on all of these if you can. Also verify the interior plastic. Everything on the inside of these vehicles is cheap and will crack or break if you use just a little too much force. Driver's side door handle, gas cap cover release mechanism, central armrest, rear paneling are a few of the problems I inherited from the previous owner. Do extensive test driving on a bumpy road to see how much rattling you have.  All in all it's a great car that's fun to drive but requires a lot of love and care."

I replaced the timing belt, suspension, coolant flange, and the valve cover gasket when I got it, Id say if the timing belt has been done that is a good chunk of money you wont have to worry about but my best advice is take it to a shop that knows german cars/VW and pay a few bucks for a detailed inspection. you will love the car I am sure :)"

GolfGTI,38dcvj,MadMaxMercer,8,Wed Jun 3 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"I will have to politely disagree with Noone, I've been running APR tunes and parts for years (MkV and my current Mk6) and I've never had a problem. They are well made, hassle free parts and tunes that just flat out work. Also, if you take your car into a dealership and they run a code on your car it will be flagged if its tuned. This is potentially a problem if you have a major problem that is supposed to be covered by warranty as they can try to prove it was the fault of your tune but the burden of proof is on them. I found a dealership that is cool about tuned cars and I take mine there for random stuff, talk to the tune shop and see if they have anyone that works with them."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,Un_Delincuente,2,Wed Jun 3 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"After warranty because just on the off chance that they void a repair due to being tuned. First new car, I can wait to add power at the end. I tell myself I can wait, shit, I want stage one NOW, but I'll hold off."

Also do you the DSG? I drive it often on ""manual"" but can't really hear the turbo unless I hit 4k or 5k rpm. Even then it's not as loud as I wish it would be."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,Awake00,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"I do have a DSG. Yeah, cant hear it much on manual mode down low, but in normal D mode you can hear it if you get up to 2100 RPM and then let off. Don't gun it to 2100, just slow and ""heavy"" so that it doesn't change to a lower gear.   Question with DSG. At around 8/9 mph in crawling traffic, do you get a slight hesitation / jerkiness at super low speeds? This only happens if i slowly accelerate to 8/9 mph then let off and coast, the dsg wants to shift up or down idk, its ""confused"" and the rpm needle kinda jiggles up and down. Doesnt do it all the time, but it does it. And then also a slight grinding noise on first gear when you let off at low RPM. Maybe im being sensitive, came from a CVT, so its massively different."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,MT1982,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:31:12 2015 UTC,I thought it was just me not knowing how to give it enough gas at that speed but I do get what you mean. It is really noticeable when I come close to stopping at a light as it turns green and I step on the gas as usual. I guess it might be a computer thing where it gets confused as it down shifts while it also accelerates. Haven't found a way to really compensate that.
GolfGTI,38dcvj,JackIsColors,3,Wed Jun 3 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Same. It's common. The dsg is more of an automated manual car than a regular automatic.

GolfGTI,38dcvj,markymark1429,2,Wed Jun 3 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"I suggest Unitronic for tuning because it's usually a bit more aggressive, and still less choppy than APR. With more hp Unis tune feels more spread out throughout the powerband. CTS Turbo has tons of stuff for the Mark 7."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,WheninRome,2,Wed Jun 3 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"The Injen is actually really appealing to me due to sound and price. If I hate it, ill sell it and get a CTS Turbo intake, i've read that people have been selling theirs and getting the injen.   I really want a at home solution for tuning, does Uni have that? I really just want it because I dont fully ""trust"" a tuning shop. I should find one that I do trust, but do they do anything custom anyways? They just flash the APR/Revo/Unitronic tune and then you're outs and onto the road. Eurodyne has a flash tool which seems great. Like a COBB Accessport."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,markymark1429,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"Uni does have a handheld loader called the Uni connect. It doesn't necessarily matter what shop you go to, because they don't change anything on the tune. All they do is buy a file from the tuning company and just load it to your ecu via the obd2 port. They never actually open the file.   Eurodynes maester program does come with a loader and adjustable settings but as you can see it is very expensive and quite hard to use from what I understand."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,EdisMoochy,2,Wed Jun 3 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"Uniconnect hasn't been released for the Mk7's (yet, they keep saying its coming).  Eurodyne is the only at-home solution right now. However, they haven't released maestro yet for the mk7's."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,WheninRome,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:31:03 2015 UTC,"It seems you are correct! My apologies.   But as I said before, do you actually need an at home loader? I thought about buying one before but I thought the extra cash would be unnecessary. Any reputable shop will load the program and take it off for you free of charge, seeing as it only takes minutes. Sure, you actually have to go down there and get it done, but it's worth the couple hundred bucks IMO."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,WheninRome,2,Wed Jun 3 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"The Mk7's, both GTI's and R's, have a turbo failure issue still. Removing the tune before getting a tow to the dealership is what people prefer the home loaders for. Also, my nearest tuner is 2 hours away. While I like the guy and respect him a lot, that's a lot of driving just for a flash, especially if I ever have an issue with my car.   When maestro releases, that is another benefit. I haven't used it yet, so I can't say anything about it really.  I bought a cheap $100 windows tablet to do both VCDS and the Eurodyne tune from. As long as I have cell/wifi signal, I can tune/detune my car, try out stage 1, 1.5, 2, and any other that Eurodyne may release, which as of right now, is at no additional cost."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,BdayEvryDay,2,Wed Jun 3 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"Now that would have been a definite factor for me as well, however my shop is less than 5 minutes away from me.   The maestro program seems to have great reviews and has what appears to be something similar to a wot box program integrated into it.   Good luck to whatever path you choose to take!"

I've had a personal experience with them where they flashed my car with a half-baked tune, meaning half the programming was theirs, half was stock (DSG tune).

GolfGTI,38dcvj,mynameisvlad,2,Wed Jun 3 21:15:00 2015 UTC,An intake probably your best bet. Like an open filter one not the boxed off apr one
GolfGTI,38dcvj,two_nibbles,2,Wed Jun 3 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"Open element intake would be best. Something like Injen or CTS. Cheap is just as good as the $450+ ones, as long as it's not too cheap.  A CTS Turbo Blow off valve would work well also.  I'm reluctant to say the APR Turbo Muffler Delete will give you that much sound over doing the other 2 options."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,Noone666,7,Wed Jun 3 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"Blow off valve would actually hurt performance in our cars. It would be very slight and probably not that noticeable, but it's removing functionality purely for the sake of making noise. Our turbos are built with a recirculating system that saves boost on throttle liftoff between gears. Replacing the diverter valve with a blow off valve causes the boost that would be saved to dump to atmosphere instead.  TLDR: don't get a BOV."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,Banging_Tramps,4,Wed Jun 3 15:34:33 2015 UTC,Please don't add a blow off valve. We don't drive Hondas (for good reason)
GolfGTI,38dcvj,GolfGTIGuy,2,Wed Jun 3 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. Adding an open element intake creates almost the same sound as the BOV does on these cars. Removing insulation and weatherstripping would make it the sound louder as well, but you're against a blow off valve?

GolfGTI,38dcvj,champyg,-4,Wed Jun 3 17:54:36 2015 UTC,It's the difference between s deverter system and a blow off system. A gti deverts. Do research on what that means.
GolfGTI,38dcvj,WheninRome,2,Wed Jun 3 16:51:57 2015 UTC,"I say get a stage one tune, after I got mine my turbo is much much louder than it was before. Also an intake like others are saying will make the ""woosh"" sound much louder, but a tune will make the turbo whistle louder."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,WheninRome,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:07:36 2015 UTC,"I agree. I only have Eurodyne Stage 1.5 and my turbo is much louder. It boosts sooner, higher, and longer than on stock. It is noticeable now and I love it."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,ChrisBerke,2,Wed Jun 3 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"Cant go wrong with apr. I have their intake on my mk6 and their stage 2 tune. The stage 1 tune increased the turbo noise even with the stock intake. Once i added the intake the spool and diverter valve are very noisy. When you have the sunroof slid open it screams, its a lot of fun. Dont get one of those chinsy ebay ones do it right. I would recommend apr or the forge twintake. Not sure if they make a twintake for mk7 yet tho."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,WheninRome,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"In addition to the intake as many have said here are a couple other options short of going k04:  Get more boost! A stage 1 tune will essentially double your boost pressure with no hardware requirments. Or you could...  Get a downpipe. In my MKVI, there was a small muffler section at the very beginning of the downpipe. Getting a high flow downpipe let me hear my turbo a lot more, even before a tune. It will give you an improved exhaust sound also and get you ready for Stage 2.  Even with stage 2, don't expect HUGE spool noise. These cars come with small turbos that are quite by design. If you want everybody on the road to know you're boosted, you'll have to go k04 or bigger."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,ChrisBerke,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"Good options if OP is wanting to increase performance as well.   here are a couple other options short of going k04:   There is no K04 for the Mk7.   A stage 1 tune will essentially double your boost pressure with no hardware requirments   Stock is 17-18 psi, APR stage 1 is 26 psi peak, 20 psi sustained. Not quite double, but it is pretty high. Eurodyne Stage 2 peaks at 29 psi, not sure what APR stage 2, maybe 30 psi based on what Google is telling me. Regardless, more pressure does equal more to be vented when the valve is triggered, which equates to more sound.   Get a downpipe.   I didn't get more of my turbo sound after putting on a downpipe, just exhaust noise. Plus, without a stage 2 tune, the downpipe will cause a CEL, except for AWE's downpipe which guarantees no CEL. However, at that point you're just overspending for a sound increase.   you'll have to go k04 or bigger.   The only option right now for a larger turbo is the Golf R Turbo. The only tuning company that makes a tune for that right now is Unitronic. Not against it at all, but that's a $4300 purchase (turbo + tune + supporting hardware). APR has a couple of options in the works, they showed it off at SoWo, but no major details yet."
GolfGTI,38dcvj,Awake00,4,Wed Jun 3 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks for clarifying all those points. I was working on the assumption that everything was similar to my MKVI. Forgot how different everything is from MKV and MKVI to the new MKVIIs.   As far as downpipe noise, it was kind of a weird increase in noise. It wasn't that I could really hear the spool louder, but it's like I could hear the turbo mixed in with the exhaust if that makes sense. Sort of how you can hear the turbo in an Abarth 500.  So are the new Golf Rs not still using k04?"

GolfGTI,3895pw,two_nibbles,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:08:53 2015 UTC,Yup yup.
GolfGTI,3895pw,Bleezy79,2,Tue Jun 2 21:11:05 2015 UTC,Some details would be nice.  Why new engine?  What happened to the old one?
GolfGTI,3895pw,aphd,4,Tue Jun 2 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"Since I just had the same treatment on my Mk.6, I thought I would chime in. In my case the engine was knocking and way down on power. We took it in, they replaced the lifters, and it still had the issue. They replaced the entire engine with 59k miles on the clock (60k warranty) for exactly $0.00 USD."
GolfGTI,3895pw,th3m1ke,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:19:40 2015 UTC,"Nice, now with a new engine and new warranty that dub should break 300k miles! haha"

GolfGTI,38b5im,C41n,4,Wed Jun 3 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"Well you will probably find mk4's and possibly mk5's. With the mk4 id go 1.8t. It doesn't have that beautiful sound like the vr, but after a few simple cheap mods you can get it tuned to somewhere around 220-240 hp. It's been a fun reliable dd for me, and I'm running 22 psi with no issues to speak of as of yet. And if you do end up with a 1.8t I highly recommend the eurocustoms stage 2 tune."
GolfGTI,38b5im,jabor93,3,Wed Jun 3 02:16:39 2015 UTC,Never had a turbo anything before. That does sound fun. Lots to learn there.  Thanks for the answer!
GolfGTI,38b5im,airjordanc,3,Wed Jun 3 02:24:50 2015 UTC,I have an mk4 1.8t and it can sound ALMOST as beastly as the vr6...very fun and spirited drive too with endless build possibilities.   but if I were to be buying again I would be considering an mk2 with a newer 1.8t or vr6 swap
GolfGTI,38b5im,HighDecepticon,3,Wed Jun 3 16:52:31 2015 UTC,How about an R32?
GolfGTI,38b5im,GTEAEYE,4,Wed Jun 3 12:57:14 2015 UTC,even an abused mk4 r32 is about twice his budget
GolfGTI,38b5im,HighDecepticon,2,Wed Jun 3 13:23:21 2015 UTC,I totally missed the budget part! My bad.
GolfGTI,38b5im,GTEAEYE,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"I know nothing of the the R32. I could get financing, just prefer to own outright. Will research the R32 tonight after work out of curiosity."
GolfGTI,38b5im,airjordanc,2,Wed Jun 3 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"R32 is a GTI with all wheel drive, vr6, 6 speed with all the goodies.  Marvelous exhaust note too.  Fantastic cars.  They are relatively rare and hold their value pretty well, probably worth on average ~$10,000 for the mk4 and ~$15,000 for the mkv, of course dependent on condition and mileage."
GolfGTI,38b5im,GTEAEYE,2,Wed Jun 3 16:46:53 2015 UTC,imho if your going to spend that much on a car with AWD might as well go with something that has quattro instead of the haldex system.
GolfGTI,38b5im,airjordanc,2,Wed Jun 3 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"I have never worked on one, only driven them, but I don't have a single issue with the Haldex system with the 6spd in the R32's."
GolfGTI,389mlv,Proweirdo,2,Tue Jun 2 20:06:33 2015 UTC,DSG Service at 40k is the biggest thing

GolfGTI,389mlv,derekson,2,Tue Jun 2 22:17:01 2015 UTC,If my memory serves me right the TSI has a timing chain and the FSI is a belt. Chains are far superior.
GolfGTI,389mlv,Hotrhompson,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing is definitely the TSI vs FSI engine. 2008.5 and on have the TSI, which is more reliable than the FSI."
GolfGTI,389mlv,TheGreenTurtle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, that's probably the biggest thing here. Get that TSI engine if at all possible.   Here's a list of issues with the FSI engine: http://www.golfmkv.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2421679&postcount=9"
GolfGTI,389mlv,juaquin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"Might be worth asking if the water pump is stock.  I know on Mk6s they're problematic, so I'm assuming Mk5 was the same.  Mine went right around 100k miles, but some have gone much earlier.  It would be $500-$600 to replace it at dealer if/when it breaks, so that could potentially be bargaining power."
GolfGTI,38a69v,likeasomebooody,2,Tue Jun 2 21:55:05 2015 UTC,Yes the joke is that Raceland makes ricer products so it's riceland. That beluga is probably the same generic pipe as the raceland/godspeed dp

There's not much info out there on it, but the handful of people who claim to own it have nothing bad to say, surprisingly.  The tips are a bit juvenile imo, but those should be easy to swap out.

After researching around the internet I tried replacing this http://www.amazon.com/Dorman-917-064-Diaphragm-Repair-Volkswagen/dp/B00CFJT6AE. That really didn't seem to help in my case, but this was the fix for a lot of people with this high pitched squeal. I took it to the guy who did my transmission service and he tried fixing it, but didn't really help. I ended up taking it into vw to look at it. Fortunately for me my car was still under warranty because there was a lot wrong with my car. The car was in the shop for around 6 weeks, again they fixed a lot. They ended up fixing everything they found under warranty. If I were you I would buy the replacement part first because for a lot of people it fixed it, it's cheap, and not hard to fix. If that doesn't do it, I would take it into vw. Now the car is better than ever. It drives great. In my case I didn't need the car so I could leave it into the shop for a while.  Hope this helps"

GolfGTI,38547i,rjohnson5481,2,Mon Jun 1 23:45:09 2015 UTC,There is a decent chance the water pump is failing since this is a common problem w/ the car.  Good thing is that the dealer will cover and give you a loaner if you need it.  Keep an eye on the coolant levels and if it is low in the mornings then its the water pump.
GolfGTI,38547i,rjohnson5481,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I told them I knew it was an issue and they said at first that was probably it.

GolfGTI,38547i,DeutscheAutoParts,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"Same happened to me,  really slow loss,  dealer gave me the same crap.    Seems to me that it's probably leaking but the dealers just throw a pressure tester on it and call it a day.    I also have a 13 GTI"
GolfGTI,38547i,DeutscheAutoParts,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:39:28 2015 UTC,Did they ever replace the water pump? How did you find out it was a slow leak?  This issue is also ridiculous. Users were reporting pumps going out at ~10k miles years ago and it still hasn't been addressed. I bought a late model year because I figured things like this would have been vetted out by now.
GolfGTI,38547i,DeutscheAutoParts,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:20:25 2015 UTC,"They did not.  I'm honestly just waiting for to leak again.  My suggestion,  if you have a warranty,  get road side assistance and don't worry about it.    I think my leaks only when it's 100+ outside,  so they don't find the leak when they Park it and pressure test it."

GolfGTI,38547i,DeutscheAutoParts,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:57:58 2015 UTC,Triple A is exactly what i was saying. So that if the leak goes catastrophic you're not stranded because you're out of coolant.

What tends to happen is the internal sensor in the bottle sporadically thinks there is no coolant.  The sends a signal to the car saying hey there is not coolant, but in actuality the coolant level is fine.  Link to the bottle below. The car was not overheating at the time the light came on correct?  https://deutscheautoparts.com/1k0-121-407-a.html"

GolfGTI,384wfi,airjordanc,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:46:09 2015 UTC,Basically running all those things on your car takes extra hp you could be putting down to the wheels. Removing it nets you a few horse power. It's really only needed if your trying to squeeze all the power out of your engine. If you have a 1.8t you should think about removing the pcv system first and replace with an oil catch can to prolong the life of your turbo/engine
GolfGTI,382kre,NOPEitsTuckChesta,3,Mon Jun 1 11:59:27 2015 UTC,"These are classic symptoms of an early head gasket problem, specifically a warped head.  The tolerance is greater when the engine is cool, and so it spews some white smoke, but then when things get to temp it runs fine.  If you are very gentle with it, you might get several thousand more miles.  Check your compression when the engine is cold.  You should see a notably lower number in the middle cylinders.  I would say that you can probably drive it as is until it dies if you want to, but that you'll be better off to do the head gasket now if you can find a way to do that."
GolfGTI,382kre,andpassword,2,Mon Jun 1 15:03:48 2015 UTC,Definitely an early sign of a head gasket going out. Once it does finally bite the bullet is when you typically see overheating occur. Do you smell any coolant after its been driven for a little bit?

For me I used to get that a lot until I changed some of my stick driving habits. 1- if you are slowing to a stop or to low speed from a high speed either press the clutch in and jog the gears with the speed as it falls, downshift rev match, or clutch in stick to neutral and clutch out to reset the synchro. 2- same thing for speed changes. Never skip a gear. Always jog the stick to the gear you want before engaging the clutch.   Not sure if it's actually improved anything or if it's a mental thing but I rarely get 2nd gear crunchiness anymore. Just be consistent and don't skip gears without a neutral clutch disengage. Probably tons more eloquent material on manual synchros elsewhere on the web."
GolfGTI,381jd2,johnnybrochill,2,Mon Jun 1 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did some reading up on how to preserve my clutch for as long as possible, and I've started shifting back to neutral instead of keeping the clutch pedal depressed when I expect to be sitting at a red light or anything. So due to that, if I'm say exiting the freeway I'll be in 6th gear, then shift to neutral in preparation for stopping/selecting a lower gear if I don't need to come to a complete stop. That's correct habit then, right?   Also, what do you mean when you say jogging the gears/stick?  Thanks for the reply! I think you're right  in that it may just be driving habits, as I did some driving yesterday and noticed it doesn't happen all the time, maybe 50%, which in my mind implies it's something I'm doing."
GolfGTI,381jd2,johnnybrochill,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"In the freeway exit situation, you would want to ""jog the gears"". So if you are coming off in 6th gear, clutch in - neutral, clutch still in - select 4th gear (skipping 5th without letting off the clutch to allow for the synchro to reset) that can mess with the synchro since logically for it, you would want to ""jog the gears"" meaning go: clutch in, 6th - 5th - 4th, then clutch out after or while tapping the gas to be at the proper rev for 4th gear at your given speed, or whatever gear is most appropriate for the speed depending on when you want to re-engage the clutch.   Ideally though, while the car is in motion you should always be in gear, but its not always necessary when slowing down to a stop. Generally nowadays ill try to rev match and downshift to help slow the car and maintain engagement in case i need gas in a pinch.   Probably not the best explanation, but i hope this helps!"
GolfGTI,380wea,sbujrb,3,Mon Jun 1 01:06:48 2015 UTC,I thought it had to be from a vw dealer to be cpo.   Perhaps they have their own warranty for the car or something. But you can call your local vw dealer with the vin number for more information
GolfGTI,380wea,rajavoce,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:41:35 2015 UTC,Yea. AutoNation calls cars certified after their own inspection. What's the carfax say? All up to date on necessary services?
GolfGTI,380wea,Awake00,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:22:00 2015 UTC,"CarFax seems to be spotless, but does not say that it was certified which is why I am skeptical about the car.

GolfGTI,380wea,Technosphere,3,Mon Jun 1 08:14:17 2015 UTC,"CPO in general at most dealers means nothing. Means they say it is certified that it was checked, but that means squat. A certified car can have a problem like any other car. A different brand of dealer could have their own warranty, or that parent of them also sells VW. You have to ask.  A VW CPO means it would have a 2yr/24k on it. It stacks on top of what factory warranty is left. You can also purchase an extended coverage on top of the CPO. When a CPO car is sold it will be in VW's system. You can verify it via the paperwork and calling.  Beware of double talk. My wife bought a Jetta at Desert VW in Vegas many years ago. The double talker kept saying the car was certified, but dodged questions when she asked about it being a CPO. She knew what a CPO VW meant. He kept saying certified and that it had 2 years, which it had through VW already. They gave no CPO paperwork and it took a lot of calls to VWOA and the dealer before they agreed to CPO it and pay the CPO money to VW."

Only difference, is that I don't have any ""CPO Paperwork"" as they told me they have nothing like that and it is stored in their systems.  Any time I come in, they always mention it is CPO(presumably some flag in their system).  They did mention that a car can only be CPOed by a VW dealer.  They mentioned it isn't impossible for 3rd party dealers to CPO a car through VW, but that it was extremely uncommon.  I would not trust a CPO VW from a 3rd party unless they have very good paperwork to prove it."

Also who every you talked to on the phone has no idea about the car and probably doesn't know any real info on the car.  The CPO they offer won't hold up at a Vw dealer unless it still falls under the standard warranty but understand their CPO means nothing at the Vw service center."

After driving the MT, I was 99.5% sure I was going to get it, but as all salesmen do, they wanted me to try the DSG for a bigger sale.  The DSG was instantly awesome.  There coincidentally was some shitty traffic heading to the interstate; it was instantly gratifying to throw it in D for once, and not deal with that.  After getting on the highway I put it in M for some fun pulls.  People say you dont feel ""in control"" with the DSG, but the instant shifts made me feel pretty in control.  I haven't regretted it since!  If anything, I like it more now than before as it does take some getting used to.  Note:  If I didn't have so much stop and go traffic in my daily driving, I very well may have gone with the MT.  Have you test driven it yet?  Make sure you actually try it out (M mode and S mode) and have fun with it.  It isn't for everyone, so don't get a car that you won't like.  Nothing worse than resenting a purchase of a whole car over the transmission."

GolfGTI,381giu,SlimKlim,3,Mon Jun 1 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"If you've driven a stick you can use the paddles. :) I've had this conversation with my mom (who has been driving stick for nearly 40 years) and my GF (who has practiced it enough to understand the concept, even if she's a bit clunky on execution), both of them are chicken to use the paddles, no matter how much I promise them it's no different from operating a manual car, you simply press a button instead of having to do all the footwork.   Next time you test drive one throw it in M and play around with it, you'll get the hang of it in about 12 seconds. Don't lift off the throttle like you would in a manual car, it changes gear far too quickly for that. So basically, you drive it exactly like you would any automatic car, pressing the right paddle to change up and the left one to change down. The car will not overrev itself so you can slap buttons all day long with reckless abandon and not hurt the car.  My plan with the GF is to wait for the next time she asks to drive it (shouldn't be long) and just lock her into ""M"" from the passenger's seat and force her to press the darn buttons. She loves driving the car and jumps at the opportunity, but she still has no idea how much fun the car can really be, because she's always hitting the throttle when the car is already in 6th gear so there's a big delay before any power comes in."
GolfGTI,381giu,SlimKlim,2,Mon Jun 1 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"That's really helpful. My first response would be to take my foot off to change gears, so that's good to know."
GolfGTI,381giu,Awake00,4,Mon Jun 1 20:37:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's logical, when people tell you it operates like a manual transmission without the clutch, people who are used to driving manual assume that's the case.   It actually used to be, the ""SMG"" transmissions in the 00-06 BMW M3s were HORRENDOUS compared to the DSG. It was essentially a standard 6-speed trans with a hydraulic unit mounted on it to slam gears for you, and you either needed to have you foot more or less buried in the carpet when you shifted, or if you were driving slowly you had to actuate the throttle pedal as if you were driving a regular manual transmission."

GolfGTI,381giu,tmiw,3,Mon Jun 1 15:24:47 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a diehard gearhead and I've intentionally bought not one but two DSG cars. There are perks and disadvantages to each option, even when you remove the obvious things like ""happy wife = happy life"" or that the DSG is easier in traffic. And I won't bore anyone with the ""DSG is faster"" argument, that makes my eyes roll too.  The manual is the most engaging option. Every time you're in the car you're driving it. If your primary goal for this car is to have fun, and the secondary goals are to get good fuel economy and be relatively practical, then you want the manual transmission car. The DSG is the happy compromise. If you live in an area with a lot of traffic, or just don't like pumping your left foot all the time, then you still get all of the unadulterated GTI fun without all the clutch pedal.   That's not to say that you're giving up much with the DSG. It has some of it's own perks you can't get with the manual transmission.  1.) Seamless shifts that keep the motor in boost. Accelerating with moderate throttle in D or M mode, the car will just ""click"" through gears, giving you a feeling of seamless acceleration. Sometimes it feels like I hit a torque sweet-spot in the next gear and I'll get a satisfying little surge immediately after it changes gear without moving the throttle. After having a DSG MKV for a couple years, this was the biggest thing I noticed when I test drove the stick. Lovely transmission, would've happily bought it if it were the only option, but after getting used to the DSG, the manual felt like i threw out an anchor every time I clutched in. I've grown accustom to surfing a wave of torque during my commute.  2.) Occasionally, when you change gear angrily enough, and you're perhaps under an overpass or near a retaining wall with the windows down, the exhaust will produce a noise that'll make a man weak in the knees. It never fails to make me giggle. This is the best video example I've found. https://youtu.be/SmnTX7oNnuk?t=54s  Ultimately it's up to you. If you really think you'd miss having the ""proper"" transmission for the old school hot hatch experience, then you shouldn't get the DSG. If it's such a problem for your wife pick up an automatic beater to use as a winter/wife car. If you don't live in a perfect world where you commute 20 miles on a perfect ribbon of tarmac with zero traffic, the DSG will not dissapoint. Once you get used to it you might not want to go back, like me.  One caveat for my situation worth disclosing: I have a project car so on the weekends I can still get my clutch pedal fix. If the GTI was my only car, I'm not 100% sure if I'd have the DSG.   Still, 4-5 years ago I was one of those idiots that thought just because I drove a manual transmission, everyone else should do, and they were somehow inferior for choosing an automatic because it was ""too easy."" Once I got that stick out of my ass I realized there's space in the enthusiast world for all kinds of drivetrain options, and neither of them is ""better"" than the other one. They just offer different experiences, and both of them are awesome."

Yes, having a traditional manual is more fun in the sense that it's more involved.

Don't get me wrong, the DSG is a great transmission and is much nicer than a slush box, but it just doesn't put a smile on my face or give me the sense of satisfaction that a manual does, even when I'm using the paddles. I may be wrong, but I think I could have gotten used to the clutch in Houston traffic.

There is manual mode if you want that control. Sports mode, which I use rarely, is even kind of fun if you want a more sporty drive mode.  Some would say there is a bit of a learning curve with the DSG. Sometimes it doesn't behave the way you are anticipating because of the computer inside is always trying to guess what gear you are coming up to next. So when you want to downshift to accelerate, if you aren't holding the gas when you do this, the car will hesitate a bit before going because it thinks you are downshifting to slow down. This is the case for MKVs at least. There are a few other quirks but once you know them, no biggie.

Another thing to consider is, who knows when the R400 will actually be available? And when it finally does become available, will it be limited first and then mass-produced like the R was? You'd be looking at quite a wait."

GolfGTI,37yfle,ardweebno,1 point,Sun May 31 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"If you're in the United States, I would absolutely not wait, for 2 reasons: 1) I would bet money we're not going to see the car here at all, 2) if we do actually get it, it's not going to be anytime soon - you could probably do a 3 year lease on a 2016 R, and get the R400 when you turn it in.  If it actually did come here, I can't imagine it would be close to the R in price. It's a model that I don't think would bring vw any new customers, so it would really only compete against the R itself. It doesn't make financial sense to me for them to bring it here, but if it were to come I think it'd be a delicate pricing dance to fit it around the R, S3, and RS3 sedan (whenever that comes).   I bought a 2015 R, and I have to say I absolutely love it. It's the first car I've ever owned with only 2 pedals, and after 2+ months and 1,500 miles I've not had a moment of regret!"
GolfGTI,37yfle,slush-puppie,2,Sun May 31 21:30:18 2015 UTC,You don't think a R400 would take away people looking at a Suby STI???
GolfGTI,37yfle,bdhudd,2,Mon Jun 1 03:55:33 2015 UTC,"I obviously have no idea what the R400 price would be in America, but I have to assume $45,000-50,000? The GTI is roughly $25-35k, which lines up with the WRX. The R $37-40k, which lines up with the STI. I just think the R400 would be a notch above price-wise.   The STI starts around $35,000 right? I don't know how optioned out you can get them, but I picture the R400 being a bit too high to sway anyone truly cross-shopping the cars. As much as it's nice to cross-shop cars based on performance, money has a lot more to do with it, so it'd probably be more against BMWs, Audi, etc. And I don't know how well VW would expect to do in that range (see previous expensive VWs like Phaeton and W8 Passats), or if they'd be willing to step on Audi toes.   Of course, hopefully I'm wrong, and it comes here, and is like $42k. I just know that most cars that excite me don't come here, and I find the R400 very exciting :("

GolfGTI,37vlme,crackindong,3,Sat May 30 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"I usually let it idle until its close 100 and then keep the RPMs low until it reaches 190 (if starting from 0, this is for my mk6, not sure of optimal temp for the mk7s).  Id also check to ensure that the dealer didn't fail and leave the strut pucks in. This is a common issue for MK6s and MK7s  Other than that, keep up with maintenance (and dont forget the DSG flushes).  I have driven autos and manuals, and I have never regretted going DSG (also stop and go city traffic for me) so ignore the DSG haters.  I am not a big fan of neither D nor S modes, so I am in manual mode almost 99% of the time."
GolfGTI,37vlme,Rellikx,2,Sat May 30 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"Nice purchase! I personally have a manual gearbox but you can't go wrong with DSG. Volkswagen has really come a long way with that transmission. I'd say take it easy for the first 1000 miles, although its OK if you want to give it a little burst of speed once in a while. (How can you resist? Amirite?) Letting the car warm up is a good idea, so try not to wind up and push the turbo too hard from a cold start. I recommend grabbing some motor oil just in case for the break in period if you need to top off, and making sure your fluid levels are always good. Turbochargers can chew through oil sometimes and VW motors need some extra tender love and care. I'm not 100% sure about letting it idle after you drive it. There are turbo timers that will cool off the turbo after you shut down the engine (see if you can hear it, next time you turn your car off after a drive). Other than that... Don't crash it and she will be good to you. :D"

I've only heard good things but the DSG (assuming you got a newer gti with dsg). I think there are only 2 arguments for getting a standard over a dsg.    They're more fun.

It has a flared end on the charge pipe, and a metal collar on the s hose. When you push the collar into the flared end of the chargepipe, there is a spring clip that locks them together. You need to jack up the car and put it on stands and get under it to find out if that's where it is coming apart. If that's not where the issue is, then it could be any of the worm gear clamps that hold any of the other boost hoses to their respective parts. I suggest that if you are not mechanically inclined, that you take your car to a mechanic who specializes in vw or general euro vehicles and have them diagnose and repair."

GolfGTI,37tfxo,nxc5,3,Sat May 30 12:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yes!  The GTI is an excellent drive for the money imo.  If you're looking for some extra fun throw a stage one tune and a cold air intake on there.  Straight roads will be more exciting, that's what I did."
GolfGTI,37tfxo,Icy_Hot_Ballz,1 point,Sat May 30 13:16:39 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha still haven't bought the car and already talking about tunes! Judging by this sub and several other sites I visited, tuning GTI is pretty much commonplace. A lot of people say you can tune it to easily get a 50% increase in power out of a stock GTI."
GolfGTI,37tfxo,Pass1veJ,2,Sat May 30 13:28:59 2015 UTC,All depend on how much modding you are willing to do.  There is definitely a happy medium and you have to know when to stop imo because everything you do is a trade off with the drive ability.  Stage one tune and CAI are a great place to start.
GolfGTI,37tfxo,bobglaub,2,Sat May 30 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Stage one tune, cold air intake, and a more open exhaust system and the car will be fun to drive straight just for the sound!   The last part isn't so important though because the exhaust on the mk7 GTI already sounds amazing. But the intake will give you all sorts of awesome turbo sounds."
GolfGTI,37tfxo,Jloot,1 point,Sat May 30 16:26:20 2015 UTC,"""All sorts of turbo sounds"" this sounds so amazing! Hahaha getting me excited for my first GTI! I drove the mk6 never tried the mk7 they say it feels different...definitely gonna test drive before buying"
GolfGTI,37tfxo,Pass1veJ,2,Sat May 30 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"I used to be a Sales Rep at a VW store here in Ontario, Canada. I've sold quite a few mk7 GTIs myself.  I've driven a mk3, mk4, mk5, mk6 and mk7 GTI. Actually quite a few of each. I've driven the mk7 with DSG and with 6spd, and with/without the performance pack. The mk7 feels much different than mk6, if you drove the two back to back it would blow your mind.  The mk7 Golf is by far the best Golf yet. It is the biggest, the most powerful, and the most advanced. I prefer the mk4 generation for the looks, but the performance and overall value of the mk7 is way up there. Even saying that, the mk7 is absolutely stunning, especially in person and up close. It truly is a gorgeous car. Especially with a nice set of wide aftermarket wheels and the VWR springs you can buy at the dealer.   The interior of the mk7 is amazing. It feels very quality. Everything is tight, the inputs feel spot on. The steering and shifter feel are great. Even the pedals shy away from typical VW pedal feel and have a bit more weight and response to them.   What I love about the Golf is that it has 5 seats, a generous hatch space, and fits in anywhere. It's happy to cruise the downtown strip, the highway, canyon roads, snow, whatever you throw at it, it can handle it. I also like that the car is very tame and comfortable when you aren't driving it hard. With the DSG, you throw it into D and just cruise. But if you want to have fun, a couple downshifts and a foot to the floor and the car starts to make an incredible exhaust note. That wonderful, tight 4 cylinder noise, with a little bit of grunt and rasp. (Half of this sound is fake thanks to Volkswagen's SoundAktor, but it sounds nice regardless-- and it can be removed)  From the factory, there is very little turbo or induction noise. Slap an aftermarket performance air filter on there and it will instantly wake the car up. The sound it makes will make the car seem faster. If it works anything like the 1.8T VW/Audi motor, a more open intake will transfer the sound from the exhaust system and more into the intake side. You will also get that wonderful WOOOSH sound every time you let off the throttle under heavy load (when the turbo is spooled up)   The car is QUICK right out of the box. So don't be concerned about tuning it right away. An aftermarket air filter is literally the first mod I would do besides wheels/tires and suspension. But really, the car is outstanding just the way it is. I have a knack for modifying vehicles though.   I could type about the GTI forever. I'm a die-hard Volkswagen fan and have worked there for over 3 years. I may no longer be there, but I am still heavily involved in my local VW community and visit the dealership where I worked often, in fact I was there hanging out with the guys today!   wisasamz, if you have any questions or concerns about the GTI, anything at all, please feel free to ask and I can offer you all sorts of information on the GTI or VW in general. I would be happy to help!   Pursue this car! You will not regret it!!!"
GolfGTI,37ua30,adreamofironice,5,Sat May 30 13:16:55 2015 UTC,You might want to replace the cabin air filter.  I think they replace it every 10k or 20k miles for 50 bucks. It's a lot cheaper if you do it yourself.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DRNNKI/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_9?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER

FWIW, I have a block off plate that deletes that whole system, the valve on the MKV is weak so I went with the BSH block off plate. There is a second dump out the exhaust so it's not really necessary. Look into catch cans, block off plates, or just google PCV and you'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about it."
GolfGTI,37rdvj,professorgrandpa,4,Fri May 29 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely recommend getting different brake pads. A decent set of track pads wont be too terribly expensive (my hawks were about $300, but they are also not the cheapest i could get from them). I took my GTI out on stock pads for my first HPDE and ate through the entire thing. They had less than 15k on them before the event. They also caught fire.   As far as things to look over, the governing body should have a safety checklist for you to review and turn in at the safety inspections before the event. At least thats how my local NASA organization does it.  I havent been in a mk7, but my lightly modded Mk6 holds its own at the track pretty well. Be safe, be ready to learn, and have a great time!"
GolfGTI,37rdvj,NCSUGray90,3,Fri May 29 21:54:28 2015 UTC,"You can probably survive on your stock pads for one event, but they will be shot when you're done. Your brake fluid will also cook. Before your second event plan on new appropriate pads and some Motul 600 fluid or similar with a higher boiling point. Do it on your stock tires, which suck, but are great for learning this sort of thing as they give you lots of feedback. I've done two 2-day HPDE events so far in my Mk6 and it's the most fun I've had in a car. Otherwise make sure you're car is in perfect working order, do what your instructor tells you, and you'll have a blast!"

But they will hold up a helluva lot better on the track. Ran those on my mk6 GTI and damn they did a good job.   I'd also look into better tires. The stock pirelli's suck total donkey dick. Look into the Michelin Pilot Super Sport. They're sticky and dont chunk off on the track, and are great daily tires too."

GolfGTI,37p6bw,scooby103,8,Fri May 29 10:48:44 2015 UTC,All about that power to weight ratio. Having a vr6t probably helps too.
GolfGTI,37p6bw,vdubgti18t,3,Fri May 29 12:11:13 2015 UTC,"They weight nothing. They don't have a front subframe. They have very little meat on their bones. There have also been some cool rare factory cars that spurred a lot of builds like rallye golfs, limited edition g60 syncro golfs, 16vg60s etc. Vw has also used a lot of interchangeable parts so the community has a vast record of the combinations of heads, bottom ends and forced induction that are all relatively easy to pull off. I like vws because I've had so many and know how they go about designing things. People like to hate on them, but many of them are incredibly simple to work on. My 2001 tdi looks very similar to a 78 diesel rabbit with different fiel management. Light chassis, tons ways to build them and a strong community results in some whacky builds."

From what I can tell, the interior is nice enough to rival my coworkers BMWs and Audis. For the price, I can afford everything I want. It's not huge, but should be big enough as my family's second car after the minivan. And it's got just enough power to be lots of fun, but also not silly.  Plus, the other options in my price range (v6/turbo optima, Altima, accord etc) don't get me excited."

I was definitely starting to feel like I had grown out of the WRX, but I still wanted a car that was fun to drive. I honestly think the GTI is the best car I have ever owned. I don't feel self conscious driving it, but then again I live in Los Angeles and work in the entertainment industry, which isn't the least bit conservative."

Driving it normally is a beautiful experience.  It's smooth and responsive.  But once in a while I open it up and see what this beautiful car is capable of.  I've thrown it in to some off ramps at what would have been a completely unsafe speed for any other car I've ever driven.  It handles it like it is on rails.  Driven like this, the car brings out my adrenaline junky.  But there is no feedback from the wheels.  Not a major issue, just different than what I'm used to feeling when I push a car."

My previous car was a 2012 Tiguan which I got after my MK5 GTI when my daughter was born. The whole time I was driving the Tiguan, I was almost always thinking about how much more fun I had in my previous GTI. Don't get me wrong, the Tiguan was a great vehicle but it wasn't fun like the GTI can be.   If you need a car to get you from point A to B then the GTI might not be for you, if you enjoy driving then the GTI is a great choice.   Edit: the only negative I can think of is that it seems to get dirtier (it's white) than my previous GTI (also white). Not sure if it's different aero dynamics that cause road grime to accumulate differently but the hatch is always grimy and the areas around the wheel wells is always dirty with black grime."

GolfGTI,37m9yn,wolfman86,1 point,Fri May 29 02:18:31 2015 UTC,I c an think of more.....
GolfGTI,37m8dk,JaisBit,5,Thu May 28 17:27:56 2015 UTC,When you take off the oil filter make sure the o ring comes off with it it's a simple check and then it's a direct plug and play for the new one.   Then you undo the bolt and let the oil drain and then simply fill the oil back to spec. It's honestly really simple and if you can change brake pads this should be a piece of cake. Don't overthink it.   Here's an awesome guide from the golf 7 forum http://www.golfmk7.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4991
GolfGTI,37m8dk,rajavoce,2,Thu May 28 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not overthinking things is always a challenge for me. Also, the guy at the VW parts department started making me doubt myself, because he was asking why I wanted to change the oil so early, and talking about warranty issues if I screw something up. I know I should have just ignored him, but he got under my skin.  So I want to replace the filter before draining the old oil?"
GolfGTI,37m8dk,rajavoce,3,Thu May 28 17:36:24 2015 UTC,Drain the oil then replace the filter and fill the oil.
GolfGTI,37m8dk,rajavoce,1 point,Thu May 28 18:01:50 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Thanks!
GolfGTI,37m8dk,rajavoce,1 point,Thu May 28 18:07:50 2015 UTC,After you've done it once or twice you won't be nervous about it anymore. All it takes is a little practice. Also I wouldn't wait until 10k for a oil change either I have no idea why vw suggests that interval I do mine every 5k as well and car runs great.
GolfGTI,37m8dk,Rellikx,1 point,Thu May 28 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"Synthetic oil significantly increased oil life time over conventional, which had to be changed every 3-5k miles tops. 10k is generally perfectly safe. That said, I understand that VWs kind of have a history of burning oil, and I don't blame anyone for being more cautious."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,pacifictoast,1 point,Thu May 28 20:26:50 2015 UTC,I've always used synthetic oils though and I thought the rule of thumb was 3k for regular and 6k for synthetic. So I just changed it every 5k and my oil is dirty then
GolfGTI,37m8dk,liar_rabbit,1 point,Thu May 28 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"Most modern cars are fine going 10k between changes of synthetic oil. That said, I would definitely check it every few thousand miles as VWs (and other brands) really do burn quite a bit of oil, and top it off if levels fall."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,liar_rabbit,1 point,Thu May 28 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"changed it every 5k and my oil is dirty then   Dirty as reported by an oil analysis, or just looks dirty?  Synthetic will look dirty almost immediately.  My first oil change (since I owned it) was at 17k miles, which was 7k after the previous change.  Analysis showed no issues at all."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,liar_rabbit,1 point,Thu May 28 21:48:02 2015 UTC,I would also like to know why you're changing the oil so early. Do you know something that the designers of the engine don't? It's a waste of your time and money to do anything beyond the recommended (which is already very conservative).
GolfGTI,37m8dk,Rellikx,1 point,Fri May 29 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"Well, it's my time and my money, isn't it? I' didn't post this to start yet another debate over how often people should get their oil changed."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,rocksauce,2,Fri May 29 15:10:53 2015 UTC,Why do this yourself at 5k? The dealer doesn't cover this?
GolfGTI,37m8dk,liar_rabbit,3,Thu May 28 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"AFAIK the dealer only covers the 10K recommended maintenance. I know there's some debate about whether it makes more sense to just do what VW recommends, but I hold to the belief that the cleaner you keep the oil in your engine, the better and longer it will run."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,2112user,2,Thu May 28 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"That sucks, my first 3 regularly scheduled services were covered by the dealer. And yes, clean oil is better. Without sending the oil out for analysis, no one knows if it needs done or not though.  At the end of the day it's your car and you have to do what makes you comfortable. Me? I follow the service manual so when something goes wrong ( it is a vw after all) they have no one to blame but themselves."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,noroom,2,Fri May 29 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I keep going back and forth in my head about it. I'm also conscious about the environment, so I don't want to create more waste oil than is necessary. I'll probably do this oil change at 5K, do the scheduled one at 10k, and then stick with the recommended intervals after that. I don't know."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,noroom,2,Fri May 29 00:59:35 2015 UTC,"You should send a sample here and see what the results are. If they indicate its well used up, maybe stick to your early schedule."
GolfGTI,37m8dk,noroom,1 point,Fri May 29 02:17:25 2015 UTC,I'll do that. Thanks.
GolfGTI,37m8dk,noroom,0,Fri May 29 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, VW were kinda douchebags to me about my covered oil change.  I had oil already ready for my first change, so I wanted to push my free one up to the next interval, but apparently if you go over the mileage, they wont do it (20k in my case, since it was CPO).    I just had them do that one, and Ill take the next one"
GolfGTI,37m8dk,AlfieAlfie,1 point,Thu May 28 21:51:48 2015 UTC,It's 10k intervals. A lot of us do 5k because the turbo floats on a thin layer of oil and turbos are expensive.

I got a new-to-me 2011 Golf TDI in March (56,xxx mi) and my gear change from 1st to 2nd was a bit rougher than I would have anticipated. The 40k DSG service had not been done.   I had it done last month at 60k and my gear changes are much more smooth now, really only noticeable at the first two stop signs from my house when I roll out in the AM. Just my personal experience with a rough shifting Golf. YMMV."

You went 20k after 40k, and i'm only at 10k after 40k.  Do you think thats a big issue?  Did they say anything to you when you showed up at 60k to have the 40k service done?"
GolfGTI,37jj5y,thistlegirl,1 point,Thu May 28 14:22:37 2015 UTC,"IMHO, it could be.  Cars are stupid expensive & manufacture recommended maintenance schedules are probably not just a tool to sell motor oil.  But I'm not a mechanic, I don't play one on TV and I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.  The mechanics who changed it in mine said that is could potentially be an issue, and advised against letting it go that long in the future.... like you, I got my car used & the previous owners dropped the ball on that one.  It's not terribly expensive to have done, and cheaper to do it yourself if you have tools and time. Why risk a big $$$ repair. Just my humble opinion. :)"

I'm replacing the fluid within the next 1000 miles and will do my 80k service on time to make up for it.

GolfGTI,37jj5y,1800hurrdurr,1 point,Sat May 30 23:12:23 2015 UTC,Its like it can't seem to find where it wants to sit and its just like somebody is tapping the brakes with small lurches here and there. Only happens in the mornings on first start up or after its been sitting for a while. Pretty much when the fluid isnt up to temperature.

GolfGTI,37jj5y,superspeck,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"I have never known anyone to go over on the DSG service, so I am unaware of any major complications that might arise from doing it late.  It is also fairly easy to do it yourself, so it may have already been done and you would never know (dealer sucks for not explaining this to you, by the way).  Since you are having DSG problems though, it is likely that it was never done.  I would get it done ASAP (hopefully your dealer is cheap, if not online guides can help you DIY it)"
GolfGTI,37jj5y,superspeck,1 point,Thu May 28 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the previous owner wanted to ditch it once they realized they hit a $600+ maintenance interval (around $400ish is the 40k DSG service). Also, you have no warranty anymore as the car is 6 years old. Powertrain warranty is 5yr/60,000mi."

GolfGTI,37gxqj,jdswhatwhat,3,Wed May 27 21:58:20 2015 UTC,Yes but he spends the majority of the review comparing it to the R and not talking about the car how he feels about the performance package
GolfGTI,37gxqj,Rellikx,1 point,Wed May 27 21:35:14 2015 UTC,I think he was doing that because the MK6 R really wasn't worth the money and MK7 R is.  Also he said they were basically the same car tooling around town only when you really get on the gas does the R start to out shine the GTI with PP.
GolfGTI,37gxqj,Rellikx,2,Wed May 27 21:48:07 2015 UTC,R is better than the GTI for the money   Guess that depends if you can afford an R or not ;)

If someone wants your wheels bad enough they'll just hammer a socket on and take it off. It's similar to those damn locking gas caps....if they want your gas they'll just puncture the tank and leave you worse off.
GolfGTI,37jemo,Hotrhompson,4,Thu May 28 03:42:09 2015 UTC,Unless you absolutely see yourself in a bad area I would say stay lock less. I just went through a huge headache finding my key on eBay because at one of my service appointments someone did not put the key back in the trunk. This has happened to me over two different VW's. I've learned my lesson I check my trunk after each service and make sure the key is there from now on.  Honestly no one is going to steal your OEM wheels.

GolfGTI,37jemo,serpicowasright,2,Thu May 28 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"Instead of putting them in the trunk, when I have to get any work done, I usually take it out of my trunk and put it in my cup holder before I head to the dealership/shop.

Look at ones like these that have a floating ring surrounding the key portion, so that tapping on a socket won't work. One because it's oversized and leaves no room to fit over it and two it rotates freely so no way to torque the nut except from the inside with the key."
GolfGTI,37j04d,OCgngstr,2,Wed May 27 23:53:17 2015 UTC,I don't think even a p3 gauge will do MPG.  It'll do speed though then you could leave the MFD on the MPG screen.

Production in Mexico will switch over from 2015 to 2016 in late June for the GTI, so cars should start hitting dealer lots in Aug/Sep.      Dealerships simply want to lock you in as a customer, and if you give them a deposit before negotiating a final price, it's telling.      Even when final pricing / configurations are available, my VW/Audi strategy is to negotiate a deal based on invoice pricing.  VW Partner program is invoice, SCCA partnership is $500 below invoice, and you can certainly go lower.      Stay strong and good luck!"

GolfGTI,37comg,aMiracleAtJordanHare,4,Tue May 26 18:26:01 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he covered his existing body panels in real carbon fiber and applied a clearcoat.  He didn't rebuild the whole car out of carbon fiber.

I can get behind nearly any other car modification as long as it's aesthetically pleasing. But the way his car and others look I can only see this. It's just disproportionate and looks 'wrong' to me. I can't really explain it otherwise. The carbon fiber is sexy and enhances the look. The wheel not lining up with the wheel well is mildly infuriating.

Check your bushings, tie rods, ball joints, etc. You should put in a cold air intake for sure, and an after-market exhaust will make the VR6 purr. You could buy some nice wheels, maybe a new suspension kit and lower it a bit. Could get some xenon headlights or something."

GolfGTI,37euoe,FernineE,1 point,Thu May 28 01:05:34 2015 UTC,"I just got one a month ago as well. Making sure its all sorted out first should be priority like most others will say.  An exhaust goes a long way with a vr6 so that should be near the top of your list.  A decent set of coilovers or springs should be high priority too to make it handle better and get rid of the fender gap.    A stage 1 tune (the 93 octane) from APR or Unitronic is cheap and well worth it.  I don't think there's any 93 octane stations in California so I've put that off for mine.  If you only have about $200 per month to mess with, I have one word for you: Exhaust."

How it works here is you leave the car for windshield replacement, pick it up a few hours later and pay $180, insurance covers the remaining ~$500.   I haven't had any issues at all with the new windshield, seal, or rain sensor and it looks OEM (probably is OEM).  Go with a reputable shop that uses quality/OEM parts and everything should be fine."

GolfGTI,37d9h5,MotorboatingSofaB,2,Thu May 28 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"Just my 2cents, but I would skip the maintenance packages they try to sell you.  They will say that the wheels and tires cost an arm and a leg and paying an extra $40 a month will be worth it.    However, the tires they put on the car are shit.  I got the Neros, but now they come with P7 all season which grip for shit and they will replace them with the same tire.  You're better off at using the tires until they are no longer usable and then getting some Hankook v12 Evo2s or PSSs.  Wheel sets can be bought for 500-600 a set.  So I would forgo the wheel and tire package.  If you want to get an extended B2B warranty then I could see getting that but really isn't necessary."

GolfGTI,37d9h5,MGWhat,1 point,Wed May 27 12:11:21 2015 UTC,"It's true it definitely does.  But if you do the math the wheel/tire road hazard comes out to $900,which isn't too bad for 5 yrs peace of mind for a lot of people.  Also, it covers after market wheels & tires as long as they fit OEM size specifications."
GolfGTI,37d9h5,iamnerd,1 point,Wed May 27 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you arrived at the $900 figure.   Getting the ""basic"" package, which is the cheapest with road hazard protection, the cost is $64 a month ($459 minus $395).  $64 per month for 36 months comes out to a total of $2,304.    That's quite a bit of money for peace-of-mind on the wheels and tires.    It also covers your fluids and filters as well, but it really depends how much you drive each year as to whether or not that is a decent deal.  As far as the excessive wear and tear are concerned, who's to say they won't shaft you and say that something is considered normal wear and tear if you ever try to make a claim.  Personally, I'd put that money in the bank.  If I ever damage a tire, I could buy a better set with road hazard protection from TireRack.com and still have a decent bit of money left over."
GolfGTI,37d9h5,carabobo,1 point,Thu May 28 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"I think we must be talking about two different packages.    I'm talking about the road hazard tire protection.  In the pic he posted, it's 459 with tire protection vs. 434 without = $25, then $25x36mo = 900.  However, I should mention that the dealership I purchased from did not package the different options together.  For example, I had the option of getting the wheel & tire protection only if I wanted it; it was not forced bundled with the car care upgrade + excess wear & tear, as it appears to be above.  But I think you could strong arm them out of a bundle if you wanted it.  Different dealerships pull different bullshit to nickel & dime you.  My main point was that the $25/mo (or even $11-$13 if you have a 6+ year loan) is not that bad for peace of mind for wheel + tire protection.  Not nearly as bad as OP comment suggesed"

GolfGTI,37a3nv,fasterdriver,1 point,Tue May 26 02:36:08 2015 UTC,Most of the aftermarket headlights are designed for non Lp cars as far as I know. You lose the height adjustment option as that only comes on Lp packages. And the grill has to be replaced with the Lp grill because of the red line running through the headlights and grill is a different height and angle. I want to get the eds reps as they seem the highest quality.

It could be right next to the Hazard indicator, and could be called the Hazard causer.  Now I just want to hear when the hell the 2016 GTI is coming out, and whether it'll have this.

GolfGTI,37c0ts,kampfy3,2,Tue May 26 19:23:12 2015 UTC,This. So much this.  If you want Android on your stereo get one of the many decks available on Alibaba.  You can check your Facebook while on the highway all you want then.  We'll see you in a few weeks with a post of your totaled GTI.  :)  I like that Android Auto and CarPlay both limit what you can do. The simplified and much more limited interface is exactly what you need while driving.
GolfGTI,37c0ts,methnen,9,Tue May 26 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"This is no surprise... This is the functionality and interface that was shown years ago at Google IO. The people waiting for it understand exactly what it is.   It provides the features of a car navigation/entertainment system in a sleek, updatable format designed by Google. That's what it has always been.   All you need to do in a car is use navigation, listen to music and respond to text communications and calls in a manner that does not compromise the safety of your driving. That's what Android Auto does. No Twitter, Facebook, browser, etc. You don't need that. You shouldn't be using that in your car.   Anyone disappointed by this didn't understand Android Auto in the first place. It does what car manufacturers have tried to do, but it does it well and it does it better.   Nothing more."
GolfGTI,37c0ts,HaoBianTai,-2,Tue May 26 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"Albeit with some limitations I didn't expect. Why not just mirror ""allowable ""apps like Waze rather than relying on compatibility patches or perhaps rebulids of existing apps (like the Spotify for Android Auto as in the video). It looked promising on paper but now that i'm finding out more about the product, I can't imagine this feature being the 'make it or break it"" feature that's being hyped."
GolfGTI,37c0ts,HaoBianTai,1 point,Tue May 26 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"I am sure a lot of that had to do with Google wanting to meet any and all safety parameters set out by vehicle manufacturers. Getting something like this into vehicle whose manufacturers already have a proprietary solution takes a lot of negotiating.  You are right, however. If you are comparing Android Auto to your phone on a dash mount, your phone wins out (although it isn't as safe or quick to access navigation or music). However, most people are comparing Android Auto to the proprietary solutions present in cars. In this way Android Auto wipes the floor with auto makers' own solutions. This is where Google is trying to compete.  In the future, Google plans to release a local, Android based OS for automakers to install that would completely replace their own nav systems."
GolfGTI,37c0ts,Gratuitousity,0,Tue May 26 16:39:10 2015 UTC,"That's just bad coding on the Spotify dev's part.  It's not a separate app as implied, it's simply a set of API-implementing methods that tell the head unit what to display.  Just like any other feature in any app, the onus is on the app's developers to implement features.  This should be an easy one, with many large names (Waze included) having support day 1 if not very very soon."
GolfGTI,37c0ts,iamnerd,1 point,Tue May 26 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"Android Auto/Spotify will only require that you download one app for both Android Auto and the normal interface.  How do I know this for sure?  If you have a phone that will support Android Auto, you can download the app now if you want; although, there's not much you can do with it until you connect it to a car that supports it.  You can review compatible apps for it though.  It shows that Spotify is supported and that I already have it installed.  I never installed a version of Spotify that was specific to Android Auto so its just using the original app and just changing the interface."
GolfGTI,37c0ts,Gratuitousity,1 point,Sun May 31 12:43:57 2015 UTC,"Right! I'm saying their implementation is misleading cause putting ""Spotify for Android Auto"" implies a separate app, even though it isn't."

GolfGTI,377esq,MotorboatingSofaB,27,Mon May 25 14:20:30 2015 UTC,Dude. You are not supposed to fuel a running car! Even accessory power should be turned off when fueling.
GolfGTI,377esq,TokesNoMo,2,Mon May 25 14:48:07 2015 UTC,I usually turn off my car but I have been noticing that after ~75 miles from filled up the needle drops rapidly to 3/4 filled.  So I wanted to see what happens during refueling.
GolfGTI,377esq,manny2206,3,Mon May 25 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"Don't quote on me on this, but from what I understand, car manufactures make the gauges in such a way that when you have a (mostly full) tank of gas the needle will stay above the 3/4 mark for a while giving you the impression of lower fuel consumption. This is equally true for your empty/almost empty part, the needle will stay for a long time on low, giving you a sense that you're really stretching out that fuel consumption. I would try to find source but I'm pooping and on mobile .^"
GolfGTI,377esq,hiddentalent,2,Mon May 25 16:55:17 2015 UTC,"That might be a side effect that the manufacturers are happy about, but it's not why this happens.   Fuel gauges work by using a floater device, similar to what's in your toilet. It's typically about 2"" round, and when it's free floating about 0.5"" are submerged in has. When the fuel tank is completely full, the device is basically submerged. But it stays in the ""full"" position (i.e., all the way at the top of the tank) until you've burned enough gas for the fuel level to drop 1.5"", then it starts working again. Same thing with the last little bit in the tank - the gauge can't differentiate between ""the floater just landed on the bottom, but you have half an inch of gas left"" and ""no gas at all."""
GolfGTI,377esq,BeerNChips,2,Mon May 25 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"This same thing happens in my mk5, except it falls to about 7/8 of full rather than 3/4 of full after a good bit of driving with it at full."

GolfGTI,377esq,Rellikx,3,Mon May 25 15:51:30 2015 UTC,"A CEL is definitely possible, but it doesnt have to do with refueling directly.  It has to do with having the gas door and cap open while the engine is running, which can most definitely throw a CEL.

GolfGTI,377esq,cannibalsock,6,Wed May 27 21:00:52 2015 UTC,That gauge is attached to a float in the tank on a lever arm like in your toilet. Could be that it gets a little stuck then pops up. Definitely wouldn't be concerned.

GolfGTI,373ogs,Xylaphonic,2,Sun May 24 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"1) Is it a TSI or FSI? You'll know when you look at the engine. It will say ""TSI"" on it which is timing chain. As for the differences? TSI is the MK6 and MK7 platform, more reliable (allegedly), less maintenance schedule, more aftermarket support, better cam follower design. FSI has a cam follower that NEEDS to be replaced every 15,000 km or so. If it isn't replaced, it wears through and your HPFP driver will punch into the camshaft, grinding down both your HPFP punch and your camshaft, requiring about $2000 worth of repairs and a fully rebuilt head. 2) How much was it maintained and how many km? If it's FSI and it has somewhere around 130-140k km, you might be due for a timing belt replacement soon and that can be costly. The belt repair parts alone are around $150-250 USD and the labor is nothing short of around $450-500 USD, usually more. 3) Can you deal with the gas requirements and expensive oil? I wasn't prepared for this. I got my MK5 and the premium gas requirement and synthetic oil requirement took a toll on me. I've adjusted to it since but going from cheap $15-30 USD oil changes to almost $60-70 a pop (even $40 if you buy the oil/filter yourself) can be eye opening. 3) Has it had any repairs? These cars can be problem children if they have a recurring issue. Mine has a recurring tire pressure sensor issue and a recurring airbag alert issue. I've had both issues repaired multiple times over an extended warranty due to recall issues with those parts, but it still takes time out of my schedule. Here in the US, VW doesn't give rentals for recall warranties so when I bring it in for the airbag issue, they fix it free but I have to fuck off for a while on my own while it's fixed at my own expenses/time/costs. 4) Check the headliner for sagging. Mine, it has gotten more prevalent over the last 5-6 months but for some people it's a deal breaker. Your headliner WILL sag unless it's been replaced by something else. Try to find a GTI with sagging headliner and ask yourself if it will bother you. It's not a question of if, but when, especially with MK5's. 5) MK5 GTI's come with Xenon HID's by default. I also wasn't prepared for this. I got the MK5 and thought man, these lights are badass, I love them! And then a bulb went. $30 each (around 15 quid or shillings or pounds or? Just look up my stuff in USD and convert it! I don't know what you guys use in the kingdom or whatever). And it turns out, a dead bulb was actually a BLESSING. I looked up how much ballasts are to replace and I almost had a heart attack. 6) FSI's have a really bad carbon build up issue. The TSI's have it too but maybe not as bad as the FSI's. After about 20,000 miles or 30,000 kilometers, the intake ports on the cylinder head have a very gunky black dried carbon build up. It's costly to clean and seafoam doesn't do SQUAT to it. Even a walnut blaster (which is the coolest tool I've ever heard of and officially in my top 10 list of zombie apocalypse weapons) can barely scratch it. You have to remove the intake manifold, fuel injectors to get to the ports. If you pay to have it done, no less than $1000 USD. Doing it yourself can take anywhere from 12 hours to an entire weekend. And it's not a very simple thing to do either. Other than that, I love my GTI and it's rock solid reliable."

GolfGTI,3738p5,jayy42,4,Sun May 24 13:33:41 2015 UTC,"When I was looking for a MK7 I went into it initially wanting a PP, but then opted not to get one.  I never got to test drive a PP car as none of the local dealers had any on their lots at all.  So I wasn't able to do a back to back comparison between the two.  That said, I doubt you'd really notice much of a difference in a PP car over a non-PP car in daily driving.  If you take it to a track you might see a difference like /u/a_chuck said.    My take on it was that it's just more electronic parts that could break and cost a lot of money to repair so I was fine to do without it.  I also had a mental hurdle that there was a ""better"" GTI available and I wasn't getting it - I was getting the weak version.  Once I convinced myself that it was just more parts that'll need eventual replacing then I was able to just forget it and get a non-PP car.    I wasn't able to find any videos/articles about a direct comparison, apples to apples, of a non-PP car to a PP car either.  So that helped sway me some as well.  The closest I could find was a 2-door, 6MT vs. a 4-door DSG.  One had PP and one didn't.  Pointless video as they aren't identical builds so the results don't mean much.  To properly compare they need to have the same # of doors and the same transmission.    I did go for the LP because I don't like driving at night and the brighter lights help me see better.  I personally think they look a lot better as well.  The LED DRL are nice.    Also keep in mind that if you wait and order a 2016 it'll maybe, potentially, probably come with the bigger screen that the foreign markets get."
GolfGTI,3738p5,MT1982,2,Sun May 24 16:43:34 2015 UTC,I have a an S with PP/LP/MT and I test drove 2 without the PP. You really need to drive one with it. It is an amazing feat of engineering and makes the car break the rules of physics. The LSD on these cars are very special
GolfGTI,3738p5,That_Brown_Man,1 point,Mon May 25 04:50:30 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Did you test drive them back to back or test drive the non-PP ones and then order the PP?  The videos I've seen have all seemed to indicate that you'd notice the most difference on a track.  Without having driven one I just couldn't picture it doing much for me cruising around town at 30-40mph or helping any on straight highways.  I don't have many winding roads near me.
GolfGTI,3738p5,MT1982,1 point,Mon May 25 13:22:45 2015 UTC,"I have a base S. I had no problems on all seasons with no LSD this past winter in New England, so I think you'll be fine without it for snow.   That being said, I reallllly wish I had the PP. I do track my car - and I think that is where you'd probably see the most difference. For daily spirited driving, maybe not so much. But! For the added cost, the PP seems like  no brainer to me.   Also, I just noticed this weekend - while a fully tricked out GTI and an R are within spitting distance, it seems the R still doesn't come with the reverse camera, sunroof, or driver assistance package."

Are you using proper oil grades for your region? How often do you do oil changes?  Your next VW car will be synthetic, cost more for oil but the consumption rate is less."

GolfGTI,3718z7,Koppenflak,1 point,Sun May 24 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  My 2008 is good for about 3,500 miles before I have to consider top up the oil, but I drive with it almost always in DSG manual, and rarely do I use sport mode.  Sport mode is NOT a good indicator of the car's normal consumption of fuel and oil. Because it's a turbo charged engine, the car is simply going to eat oil - there is nothing you can do about it - and the higher it revs and the more aggressively you drive, the more it's going to chew up oil and fuel.  Mitigation? Drive less aggressively. It's a fun car (that is presumably why you have it) but you're expecting efficiency while thrashing it, so this is not a surprising outcome."
GolfGTI,3718z7,raabco,1 point,Sun May 24 00:38:16 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, sounds like it somewhat expected.   My last car was a mini cooper S, and I thrashed it, but it didn't run through oil like this. I guess being supercharged is a different animal.   Thanks!"
GolfGTI,3718z7,Pickleteets,3,Sun May 24 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"Any other symptoms (white/blue smoke from exhaust, boost problems, MPG issues)?  My 07 FSI has always consumed oil at a rate where I'd go from MAX to MIN on my dipstick about every 1000 miles (bought it off a lease return @ ~22k mi). A PITA, but I just made a habit of checking every fill up and topping it off when needed. A few years ago it got much worse so I took it to the dealership and they said I needed to replace the turbo. Not happy with their diagnosis (I'd just had a new K04 installed by 034 Motorsports less than 20k mi before then), I did some poking around online. I came across this thread and a few others like it. Decided I'd try switching the valve cover first since it was something I could do myself and was a fraction of the cost of a new turbo. Turns out this solved my oil consumption problem so well that it now consumes far less than it ever has (about half a qt over the last 2500 mi). A new VC will cost about $200 and will take an hour or 2 to change. IMO, worth checking out before doing anything more drastic.   Edit: Another possible fix would be to replace your PCV valve which is even cheaper and only takes a couple of minutes."

GolfGTI,36qu62,Mordaine,1 point,Thu May 21 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Its unfortunate that the new R's will not hold their value as much as the older. I think the mk4 R is really the only car that held its value so well. The mk6 holds it decently well too as it was a significant change.  The new R's are going to be too plenty to be going for the current asking price. The new R400 is already in the talks to be a base $40k car. That's just a pinch over the current R's which are no where near worth the asking price. Future R's will be lower in price as they will need to fit the R400 in the category as a Base STI and the new Focus.   I'm not bashing on your purchase at all, in fact its a awesome purchase. I think the mk7 R's are a great example of VW moving in the right direction. Though it has taken them such a long time, at least its a car people can finally look at that is in the performance category as the STI and Evo. However, its a little too late.   Purchasing a R right now is like purchasing a novelty. You are the first to take the dive into a new generation of novelty car. It does not quite have everything that it could, as the newer R's will have more options. But then again, you buy a R these days because its a VW enthusiast car.   All in all, $40+k (after taxes) for a below 300hp car that has nice interior is a bit much. But it is a awesome car for sure. Just not worth going upside down over at all.   I have a 13 WRX (moved on from a Mk6 GTI with 20k miles and very first non VW/Audi vehicle I have ever owned) that puts down about 330whp. I have spent no more than $26k for the car and about $2k in parts and performance. VW has a ways to go, but I have good faith in the R400 finally being able to give a real performance hatch since the mk4 R32.   Beautiful car though!!!!....wanna race?

So even if it was a stock wrx that then had $2k of mods it wouldn't be an accurate comparison, I love Subarus but the level of refinement alone makes the R worth it.  Plus $2k in mods puts you in the stage 2 category I would guess (unless the car already had mods), no way it makes over 300 to the wheels on a stage 2.

GolfGTI,36qu62,Mordaine,1 point,Fri May 22 11:14:51 2015 UTC,"It makes well over 300 on stage 2. It's not hard at all to get there.

All I'm running is Invidia catless downpipe, invidia q300, pro tune and a Cobb intake and I promise you she sits very nicely above 300hp. Ill just remind myself of this post and get you the dyno sheet.   No it does not include mods to the 26k. I bought it used with 9k miles on it. I think when we are comparing performance, it is very accurate to the R but I agree with you on the refinement. My mk6 was easy to drive and a blast to drive and had such a well put together feel. All my VW/Audis did. My Subaru is just a muscle driven rattling machine. In aspects of performance, shock value and surprise, my WRX blows the doors off of my GTI.   Now the mk7 was a perfect upgrade for the GTI but even when pulling and havin fun with one, my WRX came out on top everytime. But there is a point where having a rattling muscle machine is fun and you want to have a refined, fun hatch experience and that is where the mk7 GTI shines. But I'm not in the popular opinions of Subaru guys as I think the Hatch WRX and Hatch STI is horrible and in no way would I ever choose one over a GTI mk6 or mk7. Plus that APR tune on the mk7 is like night and day. What a beast!!!!!  Why did you turn in your STI? Value wise, it's going to hold it's value much more than the GTI. What package GTI did you get? The mk7 really took time to grow on me as I was super partial to the mk6. Did you get the APR tune done? I think no matter what way you go, Subaru or VW, they make some awesome budget fun performance cars"
GolfGTI,36qu62,Bazgab,1 point,Fri May 22 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"Really? I know they make over 300 at the crank with a Stage 2, all info I saw had Stage 2 WRXs around 270hp with a pro tune (makes sense as stock car only has slightly over 200hp to the wheels, dat 25% drivetrain loss).  Not trying to question you, just the numbers I saw posted all the time.  Oh man I loved the STI hatch, it is so practical although I do think the sedan looks slightly better.  I got rid of the STI for some of the reasons you stated.  The WRX and STI are ""rattling muscle machines"", I was getting sick of the unrefined interior, lots of cabin noise, stiff ride, bad gas mileage, etc.  Going from the STI to the Mk7, I am extremely satisfied with my decision.  Only things I will miss are the AWD and doing rallyx (and the sound of course).    I got the 4-dr GTI 6-spd manual autobahn w/ performance pack.  I only have the neuspeed module now as I am concerned with TD1 flag at dealer until some of the tunes are proven to not trigger it.  Plus some are still missing the ability to change the tune on the fly, which is why I wouldn't go APR.  Will probably go unitronic or eurodyne stage 2 if I go that route.  Waiting to see how the Berger JB4 module turns out for the Mk7, that would be my ideal solution.  Enjoy the WRX! Like you said, you can't go wrong with either company's performance cars."
GolfGTI,36qu62,Mordaine,1 point,Fri May 22 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"I pulled around 235whp on the dyno stock and when I did the OTS from Cobb i was sitting aroubd 250whp. It was what they advertised at about a 9%ish gain. However, as soon as you open them up and get a good tune, you can see around 310whp with everything supporting a protune. Just cost a little extra.   I miss the hell out of the ease to upgrade a VW/Audi.   Yeah, you said it best about the WRX/STI. I have the limited and the leather is nice but the only way to stop the rattling is to jump on the gas to hear that beautiful engine or to turn the music all the way up hahaha. Dude, does it love to eat gas.....  I think how you described the upgrade is the exact reason a GTI/R will be considered better in those areas. Plus you get more than enough power to play with and not have to suffer from the WRX/STI issues.   I had no idea that the dealers will flag the car. All the dealers around here in WA were really really supportive of tunes to the GTI and R. I had one even help their customers get situated on tunes for their GTI's and honored the warranty.  Good luck with the car man!"

Even if it does, I'd be maybe a little bit annoyed but not for long.  As I mentioned in another comment, I've wanted the vw performance car for a while. The fact that I've finally been able to get one is my biggest thing and I couldn't be happier - the other portion too is it took some serious convincing of my wife as to why I would get this - we have our first child on the way and she doesn't love the idea of me driving a baby around in 420hp (as if I can't mod this r...lol)"

I use to be super mad at the styling and look on the mk7 but fell in love with the R because I think it is everything the GTI should have been. But the GTI is not a AWD car and that's where the R shines. It's a a fast, comfortable, sleek and sexy Golf. I think the R400 or rumored r420 is going to be the balls to the wall golf that was just built for speed.   But your right man, when you look at performance VW's the R is hands down the best car to get not just because of numbers, but because it is so badass"

For me it comes down to three things:   It's cool in the sun (I live in a very hot state), It's the best at hiding dust/dirt between showers, It's ""stealth mode"" as far as looking like a fast car.   That last one could definitely be a drawback rather than a bonus, depending on your preferences. But as a 40 year old buying my first performance car, I want something with some restraint, at least on the outside. And if the red car next to me gets the speeding ticket, that's a bonus, too."

I say drivers edition as it has the xenons and moonroof. The kenwood cd player is worth way less than whatever was stock in there. Again the price is terribly overpriced, I would not pay more than 18k for this. For comparison, in December I purchased a used 2013 Autobahn from a local BMW dealer, 19k miles, for 21k. Mine is a year newer, and an actual autobahn that includes leather and GPS. For comparisons sake: this has ~10,000  more miles (-$1k), is missing leather and GPS (-$1k) and a year older (-$1k).

GolfGTI,36lhy9,ramoose,2,Thu May 21 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly? In my opinion, shop around at other dealers (not VW dealer). VW dealer will rape you, BUT if you go to, say a Ford dealer with a GTI, they will almost always price it lower and be more willing to negotiate. I just got a 2014 Tiguan for the gf at the Mini Dealer for 18k. It has 12k miles and a few upgrades from base. Most VW dealers want 20k+ for something like this. Maybe not a steal, but we paid what it was worth, maybe a little less.  If you get something cheap cheap (less than 16k), you may want to hit up the VW dealer so you get the certified pre-owned warranty. This will be pricier but similarly priced to a 3rd party warranty and better, imo. These will be rare at this price point, but is possible.  Buying the right car at the right price takes time. If money is no object (you're willing to spend 20k), go the VW dealer and get something from them. You can get a 2012 maybe 13 for around 20k, depending on package and mileage. VW dealer will negotiate and if you have a trade-in, that may be where most of the negotiating takes place.   Good luck!"

GolfGTI,36lhy9,so_numb,2,Wed May 20 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"This comment and your post title seem contradictory...   Are you looking for info on the sound system or the car itself; what sort of info do you want to know?   Edit: so I just looked at the car in the link, and it's way over priced. It says it's ""autobahn / base"" but as far as I can tell there's nothing ""autobahn"" about it. If it was an autobahn it would have leather seats & navigation, which this doesn't. I'm thinking it could be a Wolfsburg due to the sunroof, but I'm not sure with the few details they give. Carmax doesn't negotiate as far as I know, so I would avoid them unless they actually have a good price. Most people on here have reported paying about $18k for base GTI with under 25k miles. Definitely run the VIN through an online decoder to see exactly what this car is.   I say keep looking, just my two cents."
GolfGTI,36lhy9,juaquin,1 point,Wed May 20 11:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking it could be a Wolfsburg due to the sunroof   Nope, Wolfsburg Edition does not have sunroof. Wolfsburg is a base model with a couple limited edition touches (golf ball shift knob, red trimmed seatbelts, Laguna or Serron wheels). Also the Edition cars were only available in 2013 and 2014, this is a 2012 - and they only came in 4-door.  Your options are then base with lighting, leather, sunroof or an Autobahn model. Because you can clearly see a regular keyed ignition in the photos, this is not Autobahn (has keyless ignition KESSY system).  So this is a regular model with lighting, leather, and sunroof packages. I agree, $21k is high for this. I would be more comfortable around 18-19."

GolfGTI,36iqmx,zed0K,1 point,Wed May 20 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"Right now it's basically confirmed that they will get USB instead of the dumb MDI, as well as rumored that they are adding MIB II with a newer, higher res info-tainment system with CarPlay and Android Auto support."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,iamnerd,1 point,Wed May 20 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"To me this is not worth the wait, maybe for the screen res. But the MDI cable can be had on amazon for 20 dollars. I hope there is more for the 2016."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,zed0K,1 point,Wed May 20 14:35:21 2015 UTC,"Not worth the wait?   Perhaps my local dealer is lying, but they told me that they should start getting 2016 models in by the end of June 2015.  I'm willing to wait a month for Android Auto.    OP was concerned about first model year issues as well.  While they are likely to be resolved on the later build 2015 models, it would be less likely to find one of these CPO.  If he's considering buying new, it would probably be worth it to wait.  I would imagine the updated head unit would increase resale value as well."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,iamnerd,1 point,Thu May 21 02:17:47 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't increase it that much. 2016 will be worth more than the 2015 due to being a year newer, not really because of the radio  If I were looking at 2016s I would get on the list now, or order yours now as the wait for a 2015 at my dealer was 3-4 months back in April. Just got lucky that they had one that I liked."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,zed0K,1 point,Thu May 21 12:09:05 2015 UTC,"Poor choice of words when I said it would increase the resale value.  What I meant was that if you ever went to sell it, the desirability of the 2016 would be greater than that of an equally equipped 2015 due to the upgraded head unit.    I plan to get a 2016 myself.  I spoke with my local dealer at the beginning of April and they said that the area rep found one in production that met my specifications and it should arrive at the dealership by the end of June.  I specifically waited for the 2016 because of the new head unit."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,DeadDoug,1 point,Fri May 22 00:50:53 2015 UTC,"If you can wait, then yeah definitely do it. I wanted mine before summer so I got the 15. Great car btw, you'll love it. You should put a deposit on it, so they hold it for sure"
GolfGTI,36iqmx,juaquin,2,Fri May 22 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'll give some perspective. I live in a big city in the upper midwest.   I am a lazy fuck so I take my mkVI to a garage for oil changes. It costs me about $90. Yes, it is worth $40 to me to not have to deal with the bullshit of doing it myself.   I'm a little north of 50k miles right now. Nothing major has had to be repaired (other than hitting two potholes last winter!!)   I just did a DSG fluid replacement at a garage that cost me $180."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,AspektUSA,1 point,Tue May 19 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, $90? That's what my overpriced dealer here in the country's most expensive city (SF) charges, and that includes up to $20 reimbursement for cab fare. Most of the independent shops wanted ~$55-70.   I bought the maintenance plan so I take it to the dealer, but if I still have the car when that's up, you can bet I won't be paying $90 to get my oil changed."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,rajavoce,1 point,Tue May 19 23:03:27 2015 UTC,"$90 is pretty pricey, I could find a better deal around me for that if I needed. For some reason I would think the DSG flush would be more expensive, glad to hear its not."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,AspektUSA,2,Wed May 20 03:22:09 2015 UTC,"An oil change is roughly $55-65 or so to do yourself, just as a benchmark. You only have to do it once a year or every 10k"
GolfGTI,36iqmx,rajavoce,0,Tue May 19 19:52:02 2015 UTC,You should be doing it every 5k.
GolfGTI,36iqmx,AspektUSA,2,Tue May 19 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"10k is perfectly fine.  I ran my 2.0 TSI Jetta 65,000mi with not one issue, doing 10k from new."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,rajavoce,0,Wed May 20 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"That's just in your case, but if you really wanna take good care of your car it's  pretty much general knowledge that you should change your oil every 3k for a standard oil, and 6k for synthetics. 5k is a safe number. Oil after 10k miles would be filthy, pitch black I bet when you drain it."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,bellboy18,1 point,Wed May 20 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"You're totally throwing money away at 5k. Sure if you drive for hours in stop n go traffic, or do lots of very short drives you should change sooner. 10k is fine, and there's no reason to doubt why theyd set it as such. The most amount of engine wear occurs in the first few hundred miles until the new oil settles in chemically within the engine, especially when changing brands."
GolfGTI,36iqmx,rajavoce,1 point,Wed May 20 05:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sure 10k is acceptable but I do 5k and note that my oil is dirty at that mileage. You're right it depends on your driving, but 10k in my opinion is on the extreme end and it doesn't hurt to change it every 5k, I'd go 8k at most honestly. Especially if your car is modded and you drive it enthusiastically."
GolfGTI,36k4vo,amin111,3,Tue May 19 23:50:43 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Only if you really need the all wheel drive  Have you modded your gti at all, it'd make it a lot more exciting with stage 2 and supporting mods   I think if you really want to upgrade you should be looking towards an S4 or something of the sort"
GolfGTI,36hw5v,tomny79,2,Tue May 19 14:40:33 2015 UTC,My mkvi has low rattle coming from the engine as well it comes and goes. It sounds  like what your having but its hard to say without hearing it.
GolfGTI,36hw5v,generalcirca,2,Tue May 19 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"There is the possibility it's the exhaust hanger that's come loose... Take it to your dealer and have them listen to the noise- at the very least they could help you identify it. Mine did and put it up on the lifts and gave me a new one!  The hanger can come loose from going over a really large bump or, in my case, getting rear ended. :("
GolfGTI,36hw5v,zumacroom,2,Tue May 19 22:50:25 2015 UTC,Shit I was rear ended a couple weeks ago but never thought that would happen. My s4 was rear ended twice and wrx once and never had anything get jarred loose or squeaky so I never even put two and two together!  Wanted to avoid dealership becuSe it's just always a pain but prob have no choice now. Thanks! And thanks to everyone else that basically said the same.
GolfGTI,36hw5v,rocksauce,1 point,Tue May 19 23:30:29 2015 UTC,Are you under warrantee?
GolfGTI,36hw5v,rocksauce,1 point,Wed May 20 00:37:14 2015 UTC,Yeah i got it brand new in July.
GolfGTI,36hw5v,lykos11,1 point,Wed May 20 00:42:42 2015 UTC,"I would take it in. A squeak and a rattle are pretty different. Some times the downpipe can make a bit of noise. If something is wrong you want it on record with VW. Sucks taking it in, but it's at least under warrantee. Working in these engines can be a pain. My mk5 always seems to cut me whenever I go poking around."

GolfGTI,36fixt,IByrdl,32,Tue May 19 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"Body looks good, wheels look awful"
GolfGTI,36fixt,TheXenochrist,15,Tue May 19 00:46:13 2015 UTC,Love the blue but personally hate the plasti-dipped austins.
GolfGTI,36fixt,travisstaysgold,3,Tue May 19 00:39:42 2015 UTC,The idea sounds good...The result on the wheels not so much
GolfGTI,36fixt,BuiltToSpil1,5,Tue May 19 03:30:53 2015 UTC,I personally hate the look of black plasti dipped wheels.
GolfGTI,36fixt,ElFerraz,2,Tue May 19 05:16:29 2015 UTC,I think the austins would look great not dipped
GolfGTI,36fixt,zed0K,2,Tue May 19 12:29:22 2015 UTC,"I also do not like the wheels, kinda ruins it for me. The car itself, however, looks great."
GolfGTI,36fixt,kelbywest,1 point,Tue May 19 23:37:19 2015 UTC,love it
GolfGTI,36fixt,loafer,1 point,Tue May 19 00:28:00 2015 UTC,That body color looks fantastic.
GolfGTI,36fixt,mramato12,1 point,Tue May 19 05:12:19 2015 UTC,"If I was to do it, I would've added a gloss coat on top and left the wheels alone."
GolfGTI,36fixt,damnyou777,1 point,Tue May 19 05:42:03 2015 UTC,Do you even mask things off when you dip a car or do you just spray and peel off what you don't want?
GolfGTI,36fixt,two_nibbles,1 point,Tue May 19 12:29:48 2015 UTC,That body is sexy AF
GolfGTI,36fixt,Rotflmfaocopter,1 point,Thu May 21 00:52:01 2015 UTC,First time I've ever seen a plasti dipped car look decent. They've always look splotchy and just bad. It's all in the prep just like any paint. And knowing how to use a gun. I like the wheels.
GolfGTI,36h9ch,bart0,3,Tue May 19 11:21:58 2015 UTC,"Well, got Revo stage 1 last week (check my history) because I heard good reviews about it. All I gotta say is it feels like another car. The lag to take off is gone, the car feels lighter as I take off because of the added boost and I feel like I can get more MPG's when cruising after the tune. Now it feels like I own a true sports car."
GolfGTI,36h9ch,mk6ent,2,Tue May 19 13:33:05 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for low end power, an ECU flash is gonna get you something around 60ft lbs of tq. You're gonna feel that pull a lot in any mode you choose."
GolfGTI,36h9ch,pbrunts,2,Tue May 19 12:38:15 2015 UTC,"You'll feel the tune in any mode, but most noticeably in sport/manual. If you're in gas-saving auto mode and punch it to pass, it'll go from family cruiser to sports car in the span of a downshift. Second gear has an insane response...you'll be giggling every time you hit the gas. 100% worth getting the tune, if you ask me (which you didn't)."
GolfGTI,36h9ch,katskratcher,2,Tue May 19 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"If you put your foot down in ""D"" you can still get up to high revs before it shifts. DSG is very adaptable and seems to anticipate what kind of driving you'd like to do. In ""S"" it only knows how to go to 7k RPM before shifting.   You could also try shifting with the paddles or the shifter slid over into ""+/-""   You should have a quarter mile race with the TDI and GTI. I guarantee that the GTI has more acceleration, what you're feeling with the TDI is, as you correctly described, the higher low-end torque."
GolfGTI,36h9ch,mikey_the_kid,1 point,Tue May 19 18:33:44 2015 UTC,I guess the low-end torque is what I'd experience more often in daily driving than the rev limit (maybe I'm driving wrong ;). I'm excited to get it done now.
GolfGTI,36h9ch,kbexperience,1 point,Tue May 19 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"I certainly experience way more push back in the seat in Sport/Manual mode. Drive is for fuel economy, and it will upshift as quickly as it can. It will still get up and go, but it takes a lot longer. If you're trying to save fuel, why worry about it pushing you back in your seat? If it is doing that, you're not saving any fuel."
GolfGTI,36h9ch,kbexperience,1 point,Tue May 19 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like to save fuel as much as possible in general driving (don't we all), but when I need to accelerate I'd like the feeling of get-up-and-go. I know they're mutually exclusive :)"
GolfGTI,36h9ch,akrazyazzho,1 point,Tue May 19 16:18:35 2015 UTC,I usually just throw it in S or manual when I wanna go fast. :)
GolfGTI,36h9ch,akrazyazzho,1 point,Tue May 19 16:40:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for all your comments. They were the last things I needed to know to cover my bases and convince me to go stage 1.  Will do it at the next APR sale (apparently/hopefully in October?). Can't wait.
GolfGTI,36h9ch,rckola86,1 point,Tue May 19 14:58:15 2015 UTC,"Apr currently has their amazing sale going on right now - They will also have one in the fall and prob in the summer.  If money is an issue I understand, I just wanted to make sure you are aware of the sale."
GolfGTI,36h9ch,rckola86,2,Tue May 19 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I saw this in the other thread. It's actually the reason I've ramped up my questions on this sub, to potentially decide before this sale ends. It's not money at the moment, but a time shortage."
