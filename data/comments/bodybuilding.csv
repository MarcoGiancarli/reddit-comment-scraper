Of course, it's part of the competitions if you're planning to compete but that doesn't mean everyone that doesn't compete has to do it as well. Bodybuilding is tracking your progress, improving your physique and eventually getting lean if that's how you like to see yourself. I don't see bodybuilding as everyone competing and young competitors using steroids at the moment. How I look at it is to create a very beautiful body that I can be proud of and to not compare myself to others if that's not my wish.  I never really liked bodybuilding for the steroid use because it just got out of hand. I only liked the '70s and '80s. I do however admire/like the modern bodybuilders for their amazing achievements but I would never want to look like them. I'm not bashing steroid users because I know they all need an equal chance to win against other competitors, but using steroids while your aren't competing...? Risk your health and question your inner strength to just look better? Why not believe in yourself, work hard and see bodybuilding as a long adventure where you can learn stuff?"

Longest relationship of my life, never gotten this far into a long term, never really even passed the ""honeymoon"" phase with most girls. Don't get me wrong, we have some pretty awesome sex but I have a 7-5 day schedule and she works late day and night shifts. Lately we haven't had as much time.  Anyways, I'm in the prime of my life and my physique is better than it's been ever, but I feel so disappointed that I'm not actually getting to ""climb"" or use my achievements. Yeah I was already getting some so it's not a huge worry, but I wish I could feel like my progress was actually resulting in something.  It's okay, next time I'm single will be the best time of my life, I just wish I could feel some extra reward. I'm probably just sick of the gf life really."

I guess what I'm really complaining about is, over the past 2 years I've become in the best shape of my life.

Not saying any of that to judge you, but life is way too short to feel the way you do.  I'm also in my 20s and I'm starting to feel that way too, since getting serious about lifting. I've always been the ""fat/chubby but 'cute'"" girl in groups. Never been a head turner, but lately I've been wanting that kind of attention.. I'm not sure if that's bad. (Un)fortunately, I just semi-recently split with my long-ish term BF, so I'm looking forward to experiencing single life with confidence and (hopefully soon) good looks and physique.  Good luck man.

Some girls don't understand that, and it makes dating hard. But, I met my fiancée (soon to be wife), and she completely understands my desire and drive. After we had our son 11 months ago, she started joining me in an effort to ""get her body back"" (I love her either way), and we've bonded even closer over the effort and drive that comes with lifting. She's even pushing me to try and compete in a physique comp, and get back into mma (which I had to take a break from due to the birth of my son). Basically, it's hard with the wrong ones, but perfect with the right one."

At the end I got her number, sometimes I've caught girls looking at me and I like that feel. I've always loved lifting and I don't do it for girls but for me, girls are just a great bonus IMO."

But it gives us another thing to bond over--I call him on the way back from the gym and he congratulates me on my progress for the day. We try to cut/bulk at the same time because living together and eating together make different diets hard.

bodybuilding,3e2kai,xXsavagewulfXx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:01 2015 UTC,"that's one observation that I wanted to make. Because swimming involves more muscles than traditional cardio and actually has movements resembling bodybuilding exercises, myself and all the swimmers I know have already had a solid base. We all have some muscle, mainly in the legs and lats, some arms (depending on if sprinter or distance) and ok chests. Additionally, the strength is also there. Most people I know who swim (including myself) can bench 135 and ohp pretty well, along with some pretty strong squats and 2-3 plate deadlifts and 10+ pullups. Just out of curiosity, what stroke did you do? Did you do high school or club swimming before college? how did your experience go?"

bodybuilding,3dz7m4,Aumentar,11,Tue Jul 21 00:53:53 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ I thought I was too poor to blast. How do I even get some test?  Online? Or just asking around shady gyms?
bodybuilding,3dz7m4,the_real_chronos,86,Tue Jul 21 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"Just gonna be a stickler here and say you cannot ask for gear sources on this sub. That being said, there are plenty of places to find information on that. I'm not gonna be the one to tell you. Don't ask dudes at gyms, you're probably just gonna be shooting vegetable oil into your ass.  There is a lot more to gear than just testosterone. Most people run Testosterone Enanthate at 500mg/week and you typically pin (pin means injecting) twice a week at 250/mg each. This is to spread out the test so you don't get highs and lows and so you don't get super pains from injecting a lot at once.  Great now you're on gear.. What now?? Well nothing really, stay on course. Keep doing the 500/mg a week. You need to start being aware of potential side effects. 500/mg a week wont produce much, but as you use testosterone your body naturally turns some of it into estrogen. This can be really bad. No you probably wont die, but you can get acne, get emotional, get limp dick or grow bitch tits (called gynecomastia if you wanna learn more). You need to control these side effects by taking an Aromatase inhibitor. This stops your bodies production of estrogen. This is good, and typically people take some form of AI everday or every other day.  Okay, so you did 10 of 500mg/week and you look like Goku. Sweet.  No you stop taking it and all is well, right?  WRONG! You need to recover your natural testosterone production quickly so you don't lose the muscle gained and so you don't fuck your system up. How is this done? With a medicine called SERM's. Typically these are meant for women with breast cancer, and I don't want to get into how they work exactly but they sort of work like the AI's we talked about earlier. These will kick your nuts into overdrive and you'll start producing natural testosterone again. Typically, you wait until the half life of your ester has worn off since your last pin before you start this Post Cycle Therapy (PCT).  Testosterone Enanthate is one type of testosterone in the ester Enanthate. I think it has a half life of 14 days, don't quote me on that. basically, 2-3 weeks after your last shot you start PCT.  Now of course this is all for educational shit. It can get expensive but a typical 10 week cycle with EVERYTHING you need is probably around 200$. And you really don't have to cycle often.. Once a year is fine, or fuck it Once a life is fine. Whatever you are comfortable with.  Head over to /r/steroids and learn more."

bodybuilding,3dz7m4,fpsdr0p,4,Tue Jul 21 10:22:23 2015 UTC,"There is a massive misconception and misinformation around steroids. The truth is steroids can be done safely with minimal to no side effects. In fact, if you have low test doing gear and brining your levels up to optimal is actually a medicinal practice.  Go on Google and look up drug hazard charts and almost universally steroids will be near the bottom. Tobacco is far worse, so is alcohol. Testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone.. Women who become men take it, older men take it to keep their youth and body builders use it to pack on mass.  Can you abuse it? Sure. You can abuse anything. If you do research, keep up on your bloodwork and make sure everything is going swell you can use gear safely. That isn't to say it doesn't have some hazards, it does of course. Abuse or long term use can increase risks for heart attack (considerably less so than smoking or drinking, though), can increase blood pressure, acne, extreme sexual libido and blood pressure may increase. But again its never anything compared to smoking or even caffeine typically.  A lot of people ask if you can OD from gear. Maybe, but it would be hard to do. More realistically you could screw up your long term hormone production but even these can be fixed with medication.  Do your research and do it well."

I'm usually pretty lazy and don't read the more scientific articles but I would be interested if anyone had any counter research against this article.

I am 21yrs, 6'4"", and have gone from 185-245-207lbs since i started lifting. I've only been lifting for a year and a half and I feel like I should put on more real quality muscle (not tons of fat like my first bulk) before doing an intense cut.   Do you think (in general of course, everyone is different) it would be better to cut until one is lean but small and then build back up slowly, or just try a very lean bulk from a semi-lean state (six pack showing, sometimes visible striations) bf and then cut hard?"
bodybuilding,3dz7m4,Singulaire,6,Mon Jul 20 22:50:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting question, I actually just had to deal with this. When I first started lifting heavy about 2 years ago, I had terrible form and hurt my rotator cuffs on dumbbell chest press. When I was closer to being about 90% recovered, I had to decide if I wanted to get sub-10% BF or just start bulking around 12% (I had minimal size after being out for so long).   I ended up getting as lean as I possibly could and now that I'm fully recovered I have started a lean bulk. My thoughts are that I will have to lose the fat regardless, so why start with more?  Keep in mind, I did work abs and physical therapy exercises often, so I had some muscle, but I was ""small"" by the standards in this sub. I say cut till very lean and bulk after. Good luck."

Once a week frequency anyone? You detrain before the next session in most cases unless anabolics are involved.  The link to fitness blackbook is not about LBM, they used a made up ideal of 'Adonis Index'as a measure, it has no scientific studies referenced, muscle loss while dieting is a real thing even at higher bodyfat percentages, and it can be significant if your protein intake is too low, look up the studies on Pubmed.  I've seen the link to Bayseian Bodybuilding before used to claim this about protein intake, it misses one key point, the recommendation is 1g/lb of LBM, NOT bodyweight... doing it by bodyweight is pointless because fat mass does not require protein.  On anabolic window you're correct, the windows is more like 24 hours.  The cardio and muscle gain, that's very context specific, if you're running a lot after you do your bodybuilding then sure, it interferes a moderate amount, I recommend reading about mTOR and AMPK in studies to find out more about why cardio can actually mess up strength and size gains.  Cherrypicking."

But the study they are citing is this one: http://www.academia.edu/5995411/Lower_limit_of_body_fat_in_healthy_active_men  -You tend to hear lb/g of bodyweight rather than lean mass. Probably for simplicity's sake (having to find out your bf%), much like rounding up to 1g/lb is. Add in supplement companies wanting you to consume as much as possible. Also if you're pretty lean to begin with, the difference is not that great. And if you're fat, you'll end up in that 0.6-0.8 range anyway.  -I'll look into the cardio studies, but I would guess that for lifters who have no plans to step on stage, the cardiovascular benefits are probably greater than any small amount of muscle/strength loss."

Everyone wants to know what to take but there's nobody in the bodybuilding community who wants to share that information so all the noobs turn to Bostin Lloyd.   Sure they can read the forums and steroid subreddits but there's so much conflicting information, they probably end up getting discouraged. Bostin Lloyd comes off as unequivocal so they trust him.  If someone like Steve Cook or Jeff Seid or O'Hearn came forward and broke down all their cycles, Lloyd would be a ghost."

bodybuilding,3e1ruo,TheWolfofTO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:32 2015 UTC,"train shoulders more frequently. higher frequency is going to be better than pounding out  a shitload of sets and reps one day a week.   the reason is if you do shoulders not soften you will have more protein synthesis(not too sure about the wording on this but you can only gain so much muscle after 1 workout, so gain muscle multiple time a a week)"
bodybuilding,3e1ruo,cuntpuncher_69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:31 2015 UTC,I've been on that split minus the cardio for a while and have seen good results so far. I recently added a lot more volume to arms as they were slightly underdeveloped compared to my shoulders.
bodybuilding,3e1ruo,mutatedllama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:57:08 2015 UTC,"I dk what your current routine is, but I saw good shoulder gains when I combined shoulders and legs to one day. I'm not a competitive bodybuilder and lift at home, so squat, SLDL/good mornings and some calf work is fine for me as far as legs."

bodybuilding,3e1ruo,kobenator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've dropped deadlift (at least for now) due to a back injury scare I had a few weeks back. It's just not worth it for me anymore. I had my glory days on the DL, time to move on."

bodybuilding,3e1ruo,mutatedllama,6,Tue Jul 21 11:00:20 2015 UTC,"Pre exhaust the lats with some standing straight bar cable pullovers, then close grip underhand pulldowns, then bent over BB rows overhand grip, then partial deads or rack pulls, and then weighted hyper extensions."

bodybuilding,3e1ruo,TheWolfofTO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:38:47 2015 UTC,Stop doing overhand lat pull downs. Only do Supinated and neutral grip. 8 sets to failure. Comepletely unflex your lats in between sets. Everyone just flexes their lats and curls the weight the whole set. Set the stack down if you have to on each rep and the first thing you should move is your lats then pull it down

You could also alternate doing doing 5/3/1 bench and OHP for push day too, and then have some lighter (3x10) work on those main lifts as well.

I've been on a cut since March/April. My numbers have gone down for sure. For example, on DL I was around 335 lbs in March, went down to 285 lbs, and have fought my way back to 300 lbs. BTW, I love DLs.  This is a routine I built up over several months. It takes roughly 2 hours/day, mostly because the ab work seems to double the time.  Here is the deal:   My program is based on ""Bigger Leaner Stronger"" by M Mathews. I love that program! But I've messed around with it a good bit. I'm 6'3 roughly and 220 lbs. Was 217 lbs 2014 q3 and 245 lbs 2015 q1 after bulk. My winter intake was 3500 cals/day. My current intake is 2000 cals/day. My maintenance is roughly 2300 cals/day. I am on Atkins and have been since March/April. I do eat carbs at least once a week, usually on a weekend day. I strongly suspect I am doing some redundant exercises on some days and neglecting other areas by doubling up on some parts of a muscle group. I'm guessing this happens on chest, arm, and shoulder day. I enjoy doing DL's twice a week. I alternate front and oblique days re: abs. I am losing steam. When I was on a surplus I had tons of energy, but I believe that doing abs that much plus having a 6 day routine is wearing me down. I [temporarily] cut out abs this week to reduce the time in gym/day. I think doing them daily is a bit much plus it adds a ton of time on the clock. Would like to reduce my time to 1-1.5 hours/day. I am thinking of doing a DL set on Fri/Shoulders and cutting out Sat AM entirely. That would put me in a 5-day routine.   My long-term goal is to look lean and vascular (Physique). I look pretty good right now but am trying to get down to 210 lbs while maintaining this level of strength.  Would love some feedback on optimizing this program."

In general, all of my sets are 12-10-8-6 reps.  I have on occasion messed around with 15-20 rep sets, but not sure if that's right or wrong.  Mon - Chest Shoulders:   Flat DB Press - 4x12-6 DB Shoulder Press - 4x12-6 Incline DB Press - 4x12-6 Machine Lateral Raises - 4x12-6 Chest Cable Fly's - 4x12-6 Delt Finisher - 3x12 (Bent DB Lat Fly - Standing DB Lat Fly - Front Raises)   Wed - Bicep/Tricep   Wide Grip Machine Curl - 4x12-6 Close Grip Cable Tricep Ext - 4x12-6 Cable Isolation Curls (single arm at a time) - 4x12-6 Skull Crushers - 4x12-6 Hammer Curl - 4x12-6 Dips - 4x12   Friday - Back-Legs:   Lat Pulldown: 4x12-6 Squats: 4x15-12 Cable Rows: 4x12-6 Seated Calf Raises: 4x20-15 Back Extension: 4x20-15 Leg Press: 4x20-15   I can be honest and say I'm seeing some growth, I'm getting stronger, but I think I'm only now learning how much I don't know."
bodybuilding,3e1ruo,Geriskury,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"Could I get a critique for my routine please? (Upper/Lower 4 days per week). I've done PPL before, I know it's better if you got the time. My joints have a history of being banged up hence the relative low volume. I do light rotator cuff strengthening (including face pulls) with bands and cables on upper body day to warm up. I can't do OHP due to discomfort in my elbow tendon.

bodybuilding,3e1ruo,GLOOTS_OF_PEACE,2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:24 2015 UTC,looks like a solid weekly low volume prog to me. press and dips is all you have for chest and triceps but imo if ur tendons need a rest that's fine. dont forget ur face pulls either (i know u do them in warmup but definitely don't skip them)

I never really do barbell incline (almost strictly dumbbell because the only incline barbell I can do at my current gym is on the smith machine), but when I do, I would flair my arms out. I never knew that was bad form. Also, I have a long reach for my height, so I don't go all the way down. People always give me shit for it, but my shoulder always hurts if I do. Do you know if this applies to flat bench as well? I had to stop going all the way down to my chest on flat bench as well as widen my grip, because if not I get terrible shoulder impingement. I still get a great chest pump, but it inflates my numbers quite a bit lol"

bodybuilding,3e2a61,Jungelbobo,11,Tue Jul 21 12:10:41 2015 UTC,As a beginner you should concentrate on contracting your back fully with good form. Concentrate on the squeeze of your back. On most row movements a good tip is to pull with your elbows. Imagine your arms as simply attaching your back to the bar. This does change a but the further you go but the basics are still fundamental. Good luck bro  Edit- you arms can still be working as long as your back is doing the majority
bodybuilding,3e2a61,Imprintingprotocol,2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:44 2015 UTC,"thanks. The tips of how to feel the back is really useful. I actually have no problem feeling it in the back. But I always feel I am doing too heavy when I my arms are working ,even so slightly. I will try increase the weight as long as I can feel my back still working more than my arms."

Depending on your level, you might even go as far as to choose a weight that you can hold at the top for a full second and fully focus on squeezing your back muscles.  For years I made the mistake of using way too heavy weights on rows, jerking them up with my triceps, and winding up with criminally weak lats."

And I mean absolutely no disrespect when I ask this:  Is it possible for a female bikini pro to compete successfully without having breast implants?  Obviously being so lean would most likely kill all breast size in almost every woman out there, hence the need for fake breasts.  But would a 'flatter' woman without breast implants be able to do well or would judges score her poorly because of lack of visible breasts?"

bodybuilding,3dwltq,PurpleBootedBandit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:33 2015 UTC,Steady state works just as well for me. It's mostly about timing for me because I work a ton. I can't do sprints in the am. Gasses me out to much. I usually do fasted cardio steady state 30-40min 5 days a week. Work 10-12 hours. Go back to the gym train. A few times a week I fit in hill sprints just to change things up.

Out of control guts, competitors getting more and more freakish, I just don't know about the sustainability of the bodybuilding industry. It seems to me like the general public are becoming increasingly interested in figure/physique style bodies anyway.  Sometimes I think there might be just as much money in being a ""fitness personality"" as there is in being a full-time bodybuilder. Don't get me wrong, a lot of these YouTube stars still look incredible but they don't ever have to reach show condition and still have huge followings and have made it."
bodybuilding,3dyzi2,ieGod,13,Mon Jul 20 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"The money has always been with the personality, and not the bodybuilding itself. You need to know how to market yourself and network. Arnold and Franco had a side gig doing real estate. Gaspari started an incredibly successful supplement company. I'm sure there are countless others where they have side jobs/gigs/businesses.

If it'd be the '70s I'd die to stand next to Arnold to represent one of the greatest physiques in the world. Now I'm not hating on mass monsters like Dorian Yates, Ronnie Coleman and current Mr. Olympia contenders but it changed so much and became so different to the point that I just don't want to look like them. I still respect/like them and find them very impressive though. I hope this makes sense because I did a pretty bad job at explaining my thoughts. :P"

Isn't it a lot easier to cut a bunch of fat in 6 months than put on a bunch of muscle in that same time? Also, some girls come from an athletic background and then get into lifting so they are starting with a solid base. They might only have been lifting for 6 months but did gymnastics for 10 years or something.  There absolutely are girls that start off complete skinnyfat weaklings who aren't going to be competition-ready despite having trained for years. Not speaking from experience or anything"

Yeah all a fat girl has to do is learn to lift weights, then do so with enough intensity to not lose significant muscle mass on a steep cut (incredibly difficult for even the most experienced lifters). And then instead of the 1-3months like people in this sub bitch about they have to do it for a year or more and hope they don't get loose skin.

bodybuilding,3dxc3k,lokethor,5,Mon Jul 20 20:07:16 2015 UTC,I see what you are saying but to be fair there is a difference between the skinny girls that train for a few months and a quality bikini/figure competitor.  My wife is a figure competitor and I guarantee you half or more of the people in this sub couldn't hang with her. She trains like a freak. Diets just as hard as me and has quality shredded muscle mass. My point is there are competitors in those divisions that put in the same work as those of us that compete in bb. Really the same annoyance could be had with the skinny dudes that train for a year or two and throw on a pair of board shorts and call themselves physique competitors. (Again I am not talking about quality physique guys here. Nothing but respect for them.)

I just get annoyed when a bikini competitor that's been at it for a year understands the demands of bodybuilding between the hours of training, eating, and pinning. Definitely a different lifestyle. Now, there are women's physique competitors that put in as much or more work than do, but last week at a party a girl who is entering her first bikini contest after 3 months of dieting and a few more of lifting tried to give me advice on my routine. I was like, are you fucking kidding me?"
bodybuilding,3dxc3k,PrincessofPersuasia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:52 2015 UTC,Just because they've been working out for 6 months doesn't mean they'll be success in the comp.
bodybuilding,3dxc3k,BioshockBrah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who wants to compete in both bikini and figure, it drives me nuts. It's not so much the generally shorter prep time, but the fact that there really isn't consistent judging criteria in bikini. A girl could prep for 3 months and another could prep for a year and the 3 month girl could win because of the position of the moon, the day of the week, or 3 judges liking softness and 2 liking a more defined look. I just wish there would be more consistent judging criteria. Yes, there would initially be less entries, but at least the division would be more respected.   Regarding the shorter prep times, the thing that bothers me is that so many girls think they're incredible gifts from God (#blessed) and overcame their greatest struggle after training for a couple months. There are incredible competitors who have trained for years and deserve all of the credit and respect they get because they busted their butts FOR YEARS. You shouldn't command respect because you won a local tournament after a short prep. Respect is something that comes with time and training and with the way that bikini is structured now many competitors fail to realize that."

bodybuilding,3dzyc8,TeehehePANDA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:38 2015 UTC,"For females, it depends on your build. Bikini is geared more towards ""hippy"" girls. You don't have to be as lean as the other divisions, and you are scored better for having that hourglass shape (and boob implants help).  To do figure+, I'd say a more narrow waist, with larger lats (which are obviously built in the gym) scores you higher. You can diet down all you want, but some girls just have bigger hips, those girls should try and stay within bikini. Boob jobs help in this division as well.  For men, idk. Your cycle?"
bodybuilding,3dzyc8,WinkeyFace18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:04 2015 UTC,"As a female I don't think my build limits me to bikini, I started out a very hourglass shape, so much so that when I got clothes tailored I frequently got comments that my waist was so tiny but constant alterations had to be made to get my thighs and hips into pants. As I spent more time in the gym and dialed in my diet my boobs went from an F to a B cup. Now I'd say I could easily compete in figure next year if I wanted to make that commitment to my comp prep and get seriously lean.  For me, that's the deciding factor - how much commitment I'm prepared to give to my prep. Personally after competing 3 times this year, I'd rather take a break from dieting so restrictively and spending so much money on food, supps & coaching."
