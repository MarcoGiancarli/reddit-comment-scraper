4chan,3dxi9n,3nterShift,7,Mon Jul 20 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"Condoms don't protect from herpes. If a person has herpes the contagious area is more or less like an speedo swimsuit would cover around the genitals. This means that if you are a male, the condom will only cover a part of your pennis, leaving unprotected the base of it and the area around it, where you can also get herpes. In the case of women is even worse, because the base of the pennis will run around a big area of your vagina, so condoms are kind of useless.   The best way to be protected from herpes is to actually only have sex with a regular partner.  Also, remember herpes is asymptotic. If you cannot see it, it doesn't mean anything. Ah, and it will stay with you until you die, and even if years passed from your last outbreak, you can still transmit it to other people."
4chan,3dxi9n,the_phet,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:44 2015 UTC,The best way to protect from herpes is to avoid all physical contact with everyone.  Anyone who has ever had a cold sore has the herpes virus.

4chan,3dxi9n,Kylethetrashpile,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"Cold sores are not exactly the same as genital herpes. Remember that herpes only means ""dormant in your nervous system"", chicken pox -- shingles are also an herpes.  If you have cold sores, you won't have outbreaks on your genitals. If you have cold sores and have sex with someone who has genital herpes and you're unlucky, you will also have herpes on your genital area. Different virus, you can have both. Having one doesn't protect from the other. Cold sores is not consisted an STD. Genital herpes is an STD"
4chan,3dxi9n,th30be,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"Oral herpes (HSV-1) and genital herpes (HSV-2) are different viruses, but they can both exist in both areas.

Bring software that can detect both duplicate and near-duplicate images, and if you have a friend with experience in identifying fakes it wouldn't hurt to bring them along as well."

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can splat you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my Splattershot Jr. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Inkopolis Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to splat your miserable ass off the face of the arena, you little shit.

4chan,3dwe1m,VoloNoscere,3,Mon Jul 20 13:20:45 2015 UTC,"that josephus text is a proven forgery AND was written well after Jesus was supposed to have died.    Proven Forgery: The section of the Testimonium Flavianum that you are referencing contains a multitude of syntactic irregularities compared to the rest of the text. Chiefly being, the bizarre praise that Josephus seems to heap on ""the messiah"" when Josephus was in fact a devout Jew (jews do not accept that the messiah has come yet, they are still waiting). Well after Jesus's supposed lifetime: No brainer here, there are 0 primary sources, say you accepted the forgery as actually being written by Josephus, it would have no historical value anyway; In terms of proving or disproving whether or not Jesus existed. Imagine someone today wrote a Facebook post wherein they stated ""I heard a rumour from the New York Mayor that a citizen's business associate's grandfather met this awesome guy back in 1934 that could drink 20 bottles of vodka and piss out clean water"". You can see that the Facebook post, which essentially amounts to a folk tale, would offer no valuable information at all as to whether or not that man actually existed."
4chan,3dwe1m,Jetharred,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"There were three passages where Josephus wrote about Jesus.  In the Testimonius, it is widely regarded to have been interpolated after being written, but not wholly fabricated. The interpolation was probably not by Christians as the interpolations don't perfectly fit the New Testament.  The other passages where Jesus is described are regarded as authentic by almost all modern scholarship.  Edit: once again, Josephus has historical value for many other things. You cannot merely discount the parts of his work that you don't want to be true.  What about the passage where he describes James, Jesus' brother?

4chan,3dwgfs,JourdanWithaU,6,Mon Jul 20 17:56:07 2015 UTC,All bowling balls are the same volume. They need to be compatible with the ball return equipment and be fair to the game. Can't just throw a huge ball to hit all the pins.
4chan,3dwgfs,fullmoan,4,Mon Jul 20 18:49:55 2015 UTC,Sure you can. Just build a ball that deflates once it gets to the end. Bam.
4chan,3dwgfs,MrRibbotron,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:02 2015 UTC,How do you build a deflating ball out of the stone they make bowling balls out of?
4chan,3dwgfs,fullmoan,303,Tue Jul 21 06:55:19 2015 UTC,Build a ball that's filled with water and has air pockets that expand after its thrown to make it beach ball sized. Knock down all the pins and it quickly goes back to normal. Maybe you could do some sort of shell that slides out from under itself so it doesn't crumple when it hits the pins.
4chan,3dwgfs,cre_ate_eve,125,Tue Jul 21 07:14:02 2015 UTC,"i would assume there are standards for the diameter for the ball.  And then the density of water would depend on temperature, altitude, and salinity"

4chan,3dwgfs,PbAsHg,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"The Nagant revolver fires a round that creates a seal around the cylinder opening, stopping gases from escaping and allowing the revolver to be effectively suppressed. It also marginally increases velocity."
4chan,3dwgfs,DeviousRetard,107,Mon Jul 20 17:22:53 2015 UTC,At the expense of not being able to flip out the cylinder for a faster reload time as you would have with a more standard revolver.  One round at a time.

This assumption invalidates all the crap you wrote.  Everyone is stupider for reading this shit.  You're one of those imbeciles who believes that having an opinion is much more important than knowing facts, right?  Go educate yourself about HIV.  TL;DR is that if you're not black, not a gay man, not an intravenous drug user -- you pretty much don't have to worry about HIV at all.  Period.  Transmission rates for blood transfusion are only 90%.  Unprotected receptive intercourse has ridiculously low transmission rate: the risk of her contracting HIV from receptive penile-vaginal intercourse is 0.08%, from receptive anal intercourse is less than 1.5%.  Source: http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/risk.html  Even if she did have HIV, her husband would have only 0.04% of contracting it from her by the means of insertive penile-vaginal intercourse.  Husband has to have ~1732 unprotected sexual intercourses until his odds of getting aids would reach 50%."

It basically says women should have more sexual choice then men (as a sort of compensation for male privilege?) which is really anti-egalitarian - the egalitarian view is that sex is the choice of both participants. And an ""unbalanced"" open relationship where one has more sex than the other really doesn't make sense unless one partner is far more sexual than the other."

Not quite. (Source: had surgery to fix mine a couple weeks ago)  There are two different surgery options, the older Ratvitch and the newer Nuss. The Ratvitch is invasive: your chest is cut open down the middle, your sternum etc are forced into the correct position.  The Nuss is non-invasive (or much less so): two small slits are made in the side of your torso, a couple inches below the armpits. In this procedure, the metal bar is inserted to force everything into the correct position. The bar stays in for 2-3 years before it is removed.  The Nuss leaves barely any noticeable scar, and has a much faster recovery time than the older one. At this point, the only thing that still hurts me is sneezing because it entails sucking a massive amount of air in really fast."
4chan,3ds0o4,Odale,7,Sun Jul 19 04:13:45 2015 UTC,"Got the Nuss procedure done almost 8 years ago. The bar is still in my chest. I wouldn't count on it getting taken out anytime soon. Last time I was in, about 6 months ago, they said a lot of doctors are leaving the bar in permanently to avoid risk of the chest returning back to the way it was before the operation. Also, I highly recommend buying some scar cream and massaging it into your scars once or twice a day. I did that for a few weeks after my operation and my scars are barely visible now."
4chan,3ds0o4,MerryMacattack,5,Sun Jul 19 02:29:58 2015 UTC,Is there anywhere I can look to see any sort of visual so I can understand this procedure?

I had this operation done when I was in 7th grade and yes, it is as painful as it looks. I watched the video they took of my operation the day after the surgery and watching how the procedure works made me want to puke."
4chan,3ds0o4,blood_muffin,5,Sun Jul 19 02:47:12 2015 UTC,Seems pretty intense. The way the surgeon just smacked the bar into him at 2:09 of the first video made me cringe.

4chan,3drljs,seatai,5,Mon Jul 20 07:31:59 2015 UTC,"How has Microsoft maintained its bottom line better than Sony? I think both the One and the PS4 are made by Foxconn with AMD APU's, so the manufacturing prices should be fairly similar.  Edit: remembered the number ""4"" has a negative superstitious undertone in some Asian cultures, maybe that's affected sales slightly in some markets?"
4chan,3drljs,retardcharizard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:03:16 2015 UTC,"Sony is just bad with money, AFAIK. The PS4 is selling very very very well but they lose money on almost all other ventures and that's their issue. Even though their hardware is pretty good (I love my Bravia and surround sound system), it doesn't profit. Even if Xbox does poorly, Microsoft has a lot of other sources of income that balance it out. It looks like though, that Xbox has really shifted into gear this season with their focus on PC gaming as well as the Xbox consoles. Bring more competitive, esports friendly games, seems to be a long term plan for them."

Your silly little proxy won't protect you. I've hacked into many computers and spied on the users. I've hacked into games. I have been hacking since I had a computer. It's what I was raised to do. You have no idea to the extent of fear which you should be feeling. All you are is just a community of internet creeps. Have you ever murdered anyone? I have no empathy and I will probably feel joy peeling your skin off your face.  You think I'm giving you an empty threat? Believe that. I have contacts in dark places that you don't want to know about. If you live even close to me you better fear for your life. Track my IP if you want to, but I am smart enough to use a library computer. Hack into my account if you want, but it'll just make it easier for me to track you.  With love,  A psychopath  P.S. I would fear for your life while you still have it."

4chan,3drt30,1000percenttrue,2,Sun Jul 19 06:12:36 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid, we had pretty big bathrooms in our school. You would figure they'd have toilet paper always stocked in there, right? Wrong. This one time, I had to take a shit really bad. I penguin-legged it into the bathrooms, went into a stall, and unleashed a huge torrent of diarrhea into the toilet bowl. As soon as I finished, I grabbed for the toilet paper. And what did I find? Nothing. An empty toilet paper dispenser. So I had exit the stall with my pants only halfway pulled up to avoid getting shit all over them, and go into the other stall. But guess what? The other stall was locked. There was nobody in there, some fucknut managed to lock the door after they were done taking a shit. So I had to crawl on the piss-soaked floor and go under the stall door. AND GUESS FUCKING WHAT?! There was no toilet paper in this stall either. At this time I didn't know about the trick of using your socks to wipe your ass, so I had only one choice. I had to sit down on the toilet, scoop up the residual shit on my asshole with my fingers, and paint it on the wall like a (literally) shitty finger paint project to get rid of the diarrhea covering my anus. That bathroom wall completely covered in streaks of shit is a testament to the desperate struggle man faces in the search for things to wipe their ass with.  Also, nice diss to Anon with that contrast between them and a tree."

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your crop gave me cancer anyway."

This one time, I had to take a shit really bad. I penguin-legged it into the bathrooms, went into a stall, and unleashed a huge torrent of diarrhea into the toilet bowl. As soon as I finished, I grabbed for the toilet paper. And what did I find? Nothing. An empty toilet paper dispenser. So I had exit the stall with my pants only halfway pulled up to avoid getting shit all over them, and go into the other stall. But guess what? The other stall was locked. There was nobody in there, some fucknut managed to lock the door after they were done taking a shit. So I had to crawl on the piss-soaked floor and go under the stall door. AND GUESS FUCKING WHAT?! There was no toilet paper in this stall either. At this time I didn't know about the trick of using your socks to wipe your ass, so I had only one choice. I had to sit down on the toilet, scoop up the residual shit on my asshole with my fingers, and paint it on the wall like a (literally) shitty finger paint project to get rid of the diarrhea covering my anus. That bathroom wall completely covered in streaks of shit is a testament to the desperate struggle man faces in the search for things to wipe their ass with.  Also, nice diss to Anon with that contrast between them and a tree."

4chan,3dogze,delifresh1,2,Sat Jul 18 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"Strongest nation on Earth for 67 years and counting   Enjoy it while it lasts, because before you France was the most powerful country on Earth. And before France it was the Roman Empire... do you see a trend here?   Highest GDP on Earth   No, the award goes to the European Union (and even economics professors recognize that fact). Also we get 4 weeks vacation per year at the very least, no sick days bullshit (instead call in sick whenever you are), and many more benefits.   Worth 51% of the global economy   See point above. Also don't forget about China.   Largest navy in the world   Yes, that's true. It's only boats though. Meanwhile 30 million of your people live below the poverty line but hey, gotta keep them boats floating.   Military bases on 1/3rd of the Earth   That is correct, I checked it out. However consider that with this much coverage, your army is the most talked about - Americans like to claim that their Marines are tough (although now they're talking more about Seal Team Six ever since the Osama operation), but there are much more powerful military branches in other armies. They aren't talked about because they don't strut like a peacock on national TV.   Only country with a functioning railgun   No, tested railgun. It's probable that it will see deployment soon. But as the US army is modernizing itself, it calls foreign companies to do the development, such as many new weapons being designed by FN (a Belgian arms maker).   30 years technologically superior   Source and definitions please.   Only military capable of producing drones   We get it, you have a big dick. That's also false.   Developing a new generation of spaceships   That's actually true, and I'm very happy that at least one country in the world is investing in a space program.   Only country to have been to the Moon   First and only, yes, but that's because there's no reason to go the Moon. It would be a waste of time and money.   Only country to have a private sector working in space programs   That's not true.   Global center of the arts [snip]   Yes, but not entirely. You have enough space, population and cities to become the global centre of the arts, but you don't have the monopoly on representations of the arts - for example, many political summits are hosted every year in Europe, not in the United States.   Owns the most cities   That's not an achievement. What's the difference between a city of 10'000 and two cities of 5'000?   Won WW2 singlehandedly   Well now you're just baiting... oh   Leader of the free world   My conclusion is that the USA may be the world's first superpower (certainly not the only one) today, but it will not keep this title indefinitely. As I stated earlier, we have seen superpowers come and go throughout history for various reasons.     Follow our elections   Because it's all our media talks about. You are right, though. In a sense.   Eat our food   Not really. There's a shitton of MacDonald's but that's it, you'll be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of Burger Kings in a single European country. Believe me, generally European food found in grocery stores is tastier than US food.   Watch our movies and shows   That is correct, and there is no argument to be made there. I wish my country could learn to make movies.   You wear our clothes   Yes, but not at any higher rate than you do in the US. Also most designer clothes (the real designer clothes, not the Indian manufacture with a logo on it) are European.   You copy our vernacular   If we speak English, which is pretty much limited to Great-Britain and Ireland.   You access American websites   Congratulations, you understand that the Internet is not limited by countries. What's next, closing a website when the store closes for the night?   You copy our Constitution and laws   mfw fags don't know about Common and Roman law.   You read our books, etc. art, etc.   Yes, but not only yours. A little cultural openness never hurt anybody, maybe you should read more Hugo and Dostoevsky in the US.   Use our weapons   We use European weapons. The list is endless. I'll admit there's a certain charm to a Revolver though.   Drive our cars   If we're poor and if it's being sold for pennies only.   The global economy is based on US dollars   Because you were the winners of World War 2 while the Cold war was polarizing the world, and we needed one. Do you know that French is still the diplomatic language of the world? Why do you think that is?   Our military maintain bases on your soil   You have bases in less than half of Europe. Interestingly, I found out that Great-Britain also has a ton of military bases in the world. You're hardly the sole player of this game.   When our President speaks, you listen.   Alas, you are correct."

Between them, Alabama, and Louisiana (three objectively worst states in the union) the population that is below the national poverty line is staggering. Nice thing is that no one ever comes out of those states so they can't infect the rest of us with their shitty poverty, but that also means they never improve either. Louisiana got the worst of it honestly; they used to be a culturally rich, well educated state with a lot of great income from sugar plantations, but the Civil War really ruined them. In fact Louisiana had a very large black population who were better educated and richer than most of the rest of the entire nation. Now it's all poor people with no resources."

Big cities are a problem because they mix a lot of shitty shithole people who don't belong with the people who are actually doing stuff.

Any time a girl approaches, I nonverbally communicate to them they should back off because they are wasting their time. What should I do to have sex with them?   Step 1: be really attractive. Girls are infinitely shallow and only respond to pretty faces and bodies  Step 2: don't be unattractive. Girls are too dumb to pick up on signals that you don't like yourself. They  don't see any correlation between treating yourself well, and treating others well. They only see that you're ugly and don't notice yout pathetic slumped shoulders and self defeated expression"

4chan,3djwb7,Hexonloire,5,Fri Jul 17 08:07:56 2015 UTC,"You know, that is the one thing I really couldn't put my finger on. I looked over the comic again after reading your comment and noticed a few other interesting things though. After meeting tiny animals brain dude, Skeleton Jelly says ""Am I Skull Town Jelly? No! I am Skeleton Jelly."" This line caught my eye not only because of the play on words, but because bones of the skull and general cranial region ossify through Intramembranous Ossification, which is a very different process compared to the Endochondral Ossification that Skeleton Jelly goes through. Hence, his violent reaction against becoming Skull Town Jelly.   The man with many hands and eyes that Skeleton Jelly meets reminds me of the Hypothalamus gland in that it is the main link between the endocrine and nervous system. The hypothalamus receives a lot of information and dictates a lot of developmental instruction, explaining the 360 degree vision and all the hands held like traffic signs.  To me, the well is just a source of ground substance, which helps alter a chondrocyte's chemical makeup to prepare it for apoptosis and ossification.   The guy who chews up Skeleton Jelly represents the mechanism by which chondrocytes perform apoptosis, but we don't exactly know what that mechanism is yet, so I can't say for sure. (Osteoblasts is what I assume, but more research must be done).  The last character our Jelly meets is my favourite. Taking my previous assumptions to be correct, Jelly must be inside a human body, and the squares of all the walls are various cells, right? Well we meet this alien-shaped character who looks almost human - at least in the early developmental stages. My guess is a fetus for that reason, and Jelly must be in a pregnant woman. This makes sense to me as well because the female pelvis expands and gets slightly denser in late term pregnancies to support more weight, correct center of mass, etc...   Of course the comic falls closer to making a commentary about the crises of identity and existentialism, but I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the working human anatomy and Skeleton Jelly's little adventure."

4chan,3diu4s,Guyote_,16,Fri Jul 17 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"True story. I did the 23andme genetic testing stuff, and found that one of my traits was ""Asparagus Metabolite Detection: Higher Odds of Detection"".  Some people are able to detect a distinct smell in their urine after eating asparagus, while other people don't notice a thing. Those who do catch a whiff liken the smell to rotten or boiling cabbage. The odor is thought to be due to an excreted metabolite called methanethiol, a sulfur-containing compound. Whether smelling the asparagus scent in urine is due to the ability to produce methanethiol, or the ability to detect it, hasn't quite been figured out yet. Regardless, family-based studies suggest that there is a genetic component to this odd human trait.  It's so bad, that if I eat Asparagus, I can't have sex with the wife (I ain't gonna subject her to my stinky spoo) for at least a couple days because OMG IT SMELLS LIKE BURNING RUBBER COMING OUT OF MY DICK.

4chan,3diu4s,Nogoodsense,5,Thu Jul 16 23:18:35 2015 UTC,Once and it's true. I was drinking alcohol in pineapples all day then went to a strip club that night and got all horned up. Went back to the hotel room and wanked it in the shower. Tasted the load and it was without a doubt sweet. I've tasted it before in the past and it was a salty flavor. This time it was totally different.

4chan,3diu4s,Regvlas,5,Fri Jul 17 01:51:43 2015 UTC,That's correct. Was just mentioning another food that's always mentioned related to cum enhancement. Pineapple is the only one I'm aware of that's supposed to improve taste.

I'm curious how old you are? I might have had (some of) your opinions when I was around 17-20, where I went from having many shitty friends, to having just a few. Now in my upper 20s, I have 3 male friends, lots of 'friend' coworkers, but I always have a GF (a fault of mine; because I have few friends, I am horrible about how quickly I'll let a girl move in with me).  I certainly felt like ""well fuck it, these guys really aren't good friends anymore,"" in my late teens / very early twenties.  My criteria changed, which required reflection and eventually altering the way I act to facilitate that change. That's more what I'm talking about.  I think maybe, if you care, you would value very few, but meaningful relationships. People who, over time, you decide to befriend; after time, that 'guard' you're describing drops and more of you shows. It sounds like your guard is maybe worth examining"

As soon as I got a job and a schedule and people realized that I was actually gay because a couple years ago I had gotten a BF, they very quickly stopped wanting to be my friends.  And now I don't have a BF because he had horrible habits and was a pig. =/  I do have a guard up around strangers for sure though now. I've been through a lot of negativity with people and would almost rather not deal with people if I don't have to anymore. Not to mention my job is socially and emotionally draining. If I knew I couldn't get the job I wanted in an IT role I would have chosen something else that involves getting yelled at less for something that isn't my fault and not my responsibility to fix."

When I entered the work force my job was similar, but I was a 401k phone center rep, then a pre licensed broker, then licensed broker. I was making good money, but the environment was horrible and tense. I left the field right after getting licensed and have a much happier career in b2b development/sales.   Sorry to hear about the friends I guess, but it sounds like they weren't really friends anyway. I can relate to that.

Some choose to believe there is an afterlife, but for most of us, we know in the bottom of our hearts that life is absurd, and that once we die we just cease to exist, and that there will be nothing left of us once our heart stops beating.

4chan,3dlfbq,kingfish101,5,Fri Jul 17 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"Actual answer:  Some males, during puberty, get a hard, pebble-like thing located under their nipple. This is due to something like some gland or whatever kicking into gear as testosterone increases, and the body deciding to shut off forever the ability to lactate, since it's starting ""male"" puberty and not ""female"" puberty. Apparently there's some hormone gland behind the nipple; I dunno. They're all over the place.  Apparently this is a fairly common occurrence. They go away on their own by the end of puberty, so I don't know what OP was talking about with getting rid of them, since that sounds like a dangerous, retarded maneuver."

4chan,3dg4gv,IchDien,31,Thu Jul 16 14:18:58 2015 UTC,"Unlikely anyways.  More like Chad gets really hammered every weekend, and on one particular friday night decides to make a beer run while simultaneously blowing 0.2. He gathers his fake ID, hops in his 2014 BMW SUV (but in his successful father's name) and takes off, exceeding the speed limit by an average of 15 miles per hour.  On one particularly dimly-lit road, anon is walking alone. Anon lives in the same town as Chad, but doesn't go to the same university. Anon is barely above NEET tier, working at a 7-11 where he is generally by himself and has no motivation to act friendly to all the degenerate customers who make the shops doors ring. After a particularly long shift (he was forced to cover because the other employee got arrested with meth) anon gets out late and plans on getting in a little video gaming. He really needs it too, since lately he's been depressed. He's going nowhere, he has no friends, and his parents have a hard time hiding their disappointment. He keeps his face at the ground, too demotivated to look ahead - more problems.  Here are two protagonists meet. Chad loses control when cresting a hill and swerves across the two opposite lanes of the road to run into anon, causing him to be massively injured, and the BMW is totalled. Chad stumbles out, unscathed. He starts freaking out about how his dad is going to be pissed, when one of his bros along for the run notices anon bleeding out. Chad calls the ambulance and runs away knowing it doesn't look good.  Anon is declared dead as soon as the ambulance arrives. The police follow soon after, and learn chad was driving. They find him at his parents mansions and let him know he's under investigation, but not under arrest yet. He calls his girlfriend, Stacy, and tells her he needs to speak to her dad, who is a partner at the largest law firm in the area. Being the boyfriend of his daughter and a good family friend through his father,  chad gets Stacy's dad to represent him. Stacy, meanwhile takes to twitter and facebook to convince the town that chad is a good guy and didn't do anything wrong, and being a popular fellow it grows. Eventually the police close the investigation and rule it as an accident.  Anons funeral is held shortly later. However, the only people who show up are his parents. The funeral takes longer than they expected, however, and so they leave early before the burial to make sure they don't miss their flight to Miami, the first stop on their goal to live out their lives had they not accidentally had and kept anon instead of aborting him. They claim the life insurance policy they took out on him and live happily ever after."

But if you go listen to that scene it's pretty clear that Bane isn't being cut off by the FBI dude, he's replying to the ""big guy"" statement.  ""But why would Bane feel the need to point out he's a big guy compared to FBI guy?? Bane is big compared to everyone. It makes more sense that he would be threatening him!!"" you might say. Ah, but Bane is threatening him, he's simply being subtle about it. Sure, he's big for everyone, but right at that moment the only person who should be concerned about his size is the agent who, as we find out, is about to be killed by Bane.

He can feel his stuffing absorbing the life giving sugary solution, but it gives him no sustenance. No comfort. The refraction of the bottom of the cup provides more views of his life, his lie, and the set he is on. None of this is real. He has never known what it's like to be alive, or to feel.

We usually do this because our parents did it, who learned from their parents, who grew up in the Depression where hoarding food and buying as much as you could when you could was a necessity.   Also, unless you live in the city-city, grocery stores are often like a few miles away, and many people go and run all their errands at once and drive anyway."

4chan,3dj3jx,hero1012878,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the Greek: τεκτονικός ""pertaining to building"")[1] is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motion of Earth's lithosphere. This theoretical model builds on the concept of continental drift which was developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. The geoscientific community accepted the theory after the concepts of seafloor spreading were later developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (on Earth, the crust and upper mantle), is broken up into tectonic plates. On Earth, there are seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates. Where plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary; convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually.[2]  Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust. Along convergent boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the globe remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) propose gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.[3]  Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has greater strength than the underlying asthenosphere. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection. Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in differences in gravitational forces) and drag, with downward suction, at the subduction zones. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the Sun and Moon. The relative importance of each of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate."

4chan,3daibl,Chipper_chap,4,Wed Jul 15 00:39:12 2015 UTC,still waiting for an answer
4chan,3daibl,FEED_ME_YOUR_EYES,27,Wed Jul 15 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"From a physics perspective, swimming with the use of fins is the same as flying. Air and water are both fluids with different viscosities. The fins on a fish are like wings on a bird or a plane in that they generate lift through their interaction with the surrounding fluid."
4chan,3daibl,Chipper_chap,14,Wed Jul 15 02:40:23 2015 UTC,"thats not the funny response I was looking for, but thanks i guess."
4chan,3daibl,whiskey4breakfast,12,Wed Jul 15 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah except it's not the same fucking thing at all. Birds and planes generate lift to combat gravity, things swimming in the ocean just have to propel themselves in a certain direction. Are you really comparing an eagle to a fucking manatee? From a non autistic perspective, you are fucking retarded."
4chan,3daibl,FEED_ME_YOUR_EYES,13,Wed Jul 15 00:13:39 2015 UTC,It doesn't apply to all fish; a lot of them use buoyancy to counter gravity instead (you seem to be under the impression that gravity doesn't exist underwater). Sharks for example are a clear example of fish that rely on lift.
4chan,3daibl,AtomicSteve21,2,Wed Jul 15 00:27:02 2015 UTC,lift - generated by air pressure differentials.   buoyancy - generated by water pressure differentials.   A balloon and a swim bladder are not so different.
4chan,3daibl,TardisTechnologist,2,Tue Jul 14 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"Lift can still happen underwater, a fish propelling itself forward can angle it's side fins to provide lift without use of buoyancy.  Similarly buoyancy can occur above ground, a hot air balloon employs buoyancy by being less dense than its surrounding materials causing it to float.  Fish of different species may use both buoyancy and lift to varying extents."

4chan,3dcn9c,hardcorebrowser,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"That kind of makes sense though. Redguards don't look like complete ass in Skyrim (they look even worse than everyone else in Oblivion), and they're actually part of the lore. In the Lore they barely have any resemblance to Africans, and I'm pretty sure they have white voice actors. Chances are, if you go looking for this specific mod, you might be racist."
4chan,3dcn9c,accepting_upvotes,4,Wed Jul 15 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't use the mod, but I care about what it stands for. Nexus can do what they want, but I think that's kind of a dick move. Let people be racist if they want. Nexus does allow all sorts of non-lore-friendly mods, like anime weapons. I don't know about the actors, but there are plenty of black-sounding Redguards (mainly the guys) but I personally think Orcs are more black."
4chan,3dcn9c,Waffocalypse,2,Wed Jul 15 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, all that death and suffering. Like the slave trade, rape, and murder that is already in the base game. It's all virtual  Ideally, I'd want to live in a world where people could express their beliefs, even if not everyone likes them, and not be persecuted. If someone made a mod that turned the Nords black or gave Imperials big noses, I'd be fine with that too. I bet you'r one of those far-left faggots that think it was right to ban the Confederate flag from private use."
4chan,3dcn9c,Waffocalypse,2,Wed Jul 15 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying the suffering of virtual people doesn't matter, because they don't exist or have feelings.  I agree that it should be removed from government buildings. But they banned it on private property, too, and that goes against freedom of speech.  For the record, while I am not down with slavery, and am not a dumb redneck, the Confederate flag stood for a lot of things, not just slavery, and a lot of people in the south didn't own slaves or even agree with it. This country was built on the backs of slavery, and is just as much a part of our history as the good stuff, and to deny that would be unamerican, just as much as not owning a gun, or weighing under 300 lbs."

Dont actually try this, Ive never tried this and i don't know what im talking about.  pls no gitmo"

I thought the cinematography was amazing, but the movie is a disappointing shell of a great work of philosophy and sci-fi. At least it isn't as bad as the I, Robot adaption, which literally missed the entire point of the book."
4chan,3d9e7o,Every_Geth,6,Tue Jul 14 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, I think they wisely chose what to adapt and what to leave out. Electric Sheep is a great book, but it's not all cinema-friendly.

As they close the gate you barge in and hold the remaining workers hostage. Take money and put into bags. Run out to across the street and get in your get away car. Drive for 3-4 hours to airport. Ditch car in long term parking. Go home through cab. Tip your cab driver. Profit.

4chan,3d5lmw,manbrasucks,766,Tue Jul 14 02:09:30 2015 UTC,"My best friend and I came up with a suicide alternative back when we were teens.   GO NATIVE  die the way you should,  naturally    Give all of your possessions to anyone-doesn't matter..including the clothes off your back.  Live in the wilderness until you die.      If you survive,  congrats, keep going!    If you die,  congrats, mission accomplished.   Here's why going native works:  You'll be so focused on surviving,  all of your problems will be dwarfed.   There are only two outcomes: being a royal survival badass or dying. Both options are way cooler than your mom finding your lifeless body."
4chan,3d5lmw,Real-op,342,Mon Jul 13 21:24:28 2015 UTC,I always just thought you should rob a bank. If you succeed then you're rich and if you fail then you die by cop.

4chan,3d5lmw,DemiDualism,18,Mon Jul 13 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"Is your depression causing rampant suicidal thoughts that you find yourself having trouble containing as the thoughts invade everything you do squeezing the life out of you so that your body is in constant fight or flight mode with itself and the only way to ""get out"" is to release life itself from your body?   If so, you should talk to someone. A lack of money may only be providing a seed for your depression to latch onto and disarm you with an excuse.  If you obtain lots of money the depression will evolve to have a new seed to distract you"

But sometimes, just out of the blue, bam; all I can do is lay in bed fantasize / plan out how to just ending it. How to do it without hurting anyone, or how to do it quickly or painlessly. Or how to do it so nobody finds my body, etc.  I went to a range for the first time a week or two ago. Was having the time of my life and all of sudden my brain goes ""You know, you could just shoot yourself right now and finally be done with it."" I had to take a break to clear my head after that.  Generally it passes after a couple days, sometimes it stays for weeks on end though. It's the reason I was kicked out of school for missing too much time. It's been like this since the 5th or 6th grade, but increased ten fold towards the end of Jr high."
4chan,3d5lmw,manbrasucks,10,Mon Jul 13 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"You'll have to use a doctor or therapist to figure out if it's a physical or mental root cause, and would do so if it affects your quality of life like it did for school. Do note that suicidal thoughts are common, i would have the same ones at a gun range.  It's the inability to let them go that you would want to look into or having inclinations to act on it  Anecdotal based question: are you tired a lot and could almost always go for a nap? If so, look into if you have apnea.  Using myself as a source, chronic fatigue can cause depression,   as well as symptoms of a host of other mental illness"

4chan,3d5lmw,rigormortisGrandma,2,Mon Jul 13 22:55:38 2015 UTC,This has honestly been my thoughts for as long as I can remember!  Either succeed and your problems are temporary solved or go out shooting

For maximum trauma, I'll hop in straight after a little kid without waiting my turn. Just after I start sliding down, I shoot myself. This gets the attention of everyone nearby, so all eyes are on the slide. If I don't wait my turn, then first they see the little kid pop out crying from the loud noise. The water I'm sliding in travels faster than me, so for a couple seconds everyone just sees blood coming out of the slide. Finally, my dead weight hits the landing pool at full speed. For effect, I'd hope my body doesn't float up at all, but I guess it probably would.   I haven't been to a water park in a while but I guess it would be pretty hard to get a gun in there these days.

It represents a time where they were happy, before the stress and hardship of adult life hit them. Also, I'm guessing that the antisocial autists have a special affinity for games, which were places of solace that they could understand and potentially use to bond with other players the way they are unable to do in regular social settings.   Either way, Nintendo made games that were simple fun and almost universally loved, and are therefore a rare untainted spot of sunlight in the unusually dark and shit stained hearts of 4chan.   I have played literally none of those games, but even I can appreciate the sadness these people are feeling over the passing of a man so dedicated to his craft long after he ""made it."""

Cancer of the bile duct is a rare occurence, a patient has a better prognosis if a benign tumour is found in the duct. If his polyp was benign, the doctors could have left it there and it normally wouldn't cause problems (normally). Most polyps or growths are found in the GI tract, but if there is a growth in the bile duct, more than likely, it is cancerous and it is one of the hardest to treat and diagnose."

The 1920 Kiev Offensive (or Kiev Operation), sometimes considered to have started the Soviet-Polish War,[1] was an attempt by the armed forces of the newly re-emerged Poland led by Józef Piłsudski, in alliance with the Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura, to seize the territories of modern-day Ukraine which fell under the Soviet control after the Bolshevik Revolution.[1] The operation led to a Soviet counteroffensive resulting in the creation of the short-lived Galician Soviet Socialist Republic, and ended amicably with the formal Peace of Riga of 1921."

They came when they could - US also showed up in Europe Hitler already lost the war, but are quite willing to take credit for his defeat.

The official Polish government report on war damages prepared in 1947 put Poland's war dead at 6,028,000; 3.0 million ethnic Poles and 3.0 million Jews not including losses of Polish citizens from the Ukrainian and Belarusian ethnic groups. This figure was disputed when the communist system collapsed by the Polish historian Czesław Łuczak who put total losses at 6.0 million; 3.0 million Jews, 2.0 million ethnic Poles, and 1.0 million Polish citizens from the other ethnic groups not included in the 1947 report on war damages.[2][3] In 2009 the Polish government-affiliated Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) published the study ""Polska 1939–1945. Straty osobowe i ofiary represji pod dwiema okupacjami"" (Poland 1939-1945. Human Losses and Victims of Repression Under the Two Occupations) that estimated Poland's war dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million Poles and Jews, including 150,000 during the Soviet occupation.   ...   Most Polish citizens who perished in the war were civilian victims of the war crimes and crimes against humanity during the occupation by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) estimates total deaths under the German occupation at 5,470,000 to 5.670,000 Jews and Poles,[7] 2,770,000 Poles,[8] 2.7 to 2.9 million Jews [9] According to IPN research there were also 150,000 victims of Soviet repression.[10]"

Poland claims it to be a genocide with about 22,000 dead. Except, genocide was never on the mind of the Russians believe it or not. Russia states that if this is genocide then the soviet POW held near the USSR border is also genocide considering 16-20,00 died in those prisons.

What is however a surprise is that the Soviets still chose to extend Poland until the Oder. They didn't have to do that, but now you reap the rewards.

Sony is already investing heavily in VR, which seems like the next logical step for immersive gaming. I'm not sure Nintendo will be able to score another hit like the Wii anytime soon, especially since the two consoles before and the one after have been fairly disappointing. Even the Wii wasn't perfect, starved as it was for good third party titles, and it's pretty much a secondary console for 'casual' gamers and party settings."

So ... relatively shitty.  This doesn't necessarily say much about their profitability though, and it seems Nintendo's historical revenues have been fairly consistent before hitting a peak with the first Wii in 2009.  http://www.zeldainformer.com/articles/a-deeper-analysis-of-nintendos-financials-why-they-cant-drop-hardware#.VaQWm_mqpBc  edit: Also, Nintendo has always made a fuckload of money with handheld sales."
4chan,3d37tp,jplayer01,4,Mon Jul 13 19:52:37 2015 UTC,Well the PS2 had a hugely inflated marketshare by a fuckton of people buying it as a cheap DVD player. N64 didn't pick up too well since the SNES was still selling like hotcakes when when it was released.

Not being fat is a matter of not eating more calories than you burn off.  Don't blame the food because you have no self-control.  To answer the question, foods high in calories taste good because in normal circumstances during our evolution, high-calorie foods were scarce, so we needed to know what was high in calories so we could eat enough calories to not die."

Just to clear a few things up, Muslims are just like anybody else, and they level to which they practice their values varies greatly on an individual level. Also.   Islamic values have a lot in common with original feminism, but there would be a lot of conflict with modern tumbler feminism. The 'obedient to husbands' thing is over simplified. Women are supposed to 'obey their husbands' but so are men supposed to 'obey their wives'. They almost certainly will not do anal. The Trustworthiness of any individual varies wildly regardless of religion. Contraceptives are allowed, but you are supposed to have a family when your circumstances are prepared. Quite possibly cannot cook or clean. A correctly groomed beard is actually a symbol of piety. That is correct. Hygiene is certainly a core value (and so is shaving your pubes -for both sexes).    Dealing with the virtues of Islam every day would be a bitch though.   I presume you mean the rituals? The virtues are quite simple and apart from those directly related to worship, you more than likely already believe in most of them yourself. It's the same with most other religions, the core values tend to be about being good to others (even if they are not always practiced)."

4chan,3d0myj,happeningpodcast,42,Sun Jul 12 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"I guess male virgins believe that once a girl is fucked, her pussy is just completely blown out and never works right again (despite the fact that doctors routinely perform surgeries on women post-childbirth to make them even tighter than virgins). There's some neckbeard chart floating around that shows the divorce rate as a function of number of sexual partners a woman's had.  The rate is like 20% for virgins, and like 70% for 15+ partners.  I guess the neckbeards have some image in their head of a virgin damsel princess who's a size two with 34DDs and is heir to a kingdom, who just stays pure out of principle.  In actuality, the girls who are virgins are most likely not virgins by choice.  They're fucking fat, gross, poor, and disgusting, and settle for whatever they can get and never risk loneliness by chancing divorce."

4chan,3d0gjy,bacchic_ritual,84,Sun Jul 12 17:35:09 2015 UTC,I mean the shows on teen nick often have a beta white male who always is pursuing the main female character while there is a black character that comes off as alpha. While the lead male talks about feelings and often doesn't get the girl the black character gets whatever he wants. That's what I mean by the teen nick cuckholding.

Signs that Mojo is Muslim  1) he wants to conquer the world and enslave all of mankind to his ideas (he says this explicitly in the PPG movie). This is textbook Islam.  2) He keeps a clock by his bedside that very clearly resembles an Azan prayer clock, complete with its gold minaret.  3) His lair is filled with decor that resembles Islamic art/architecture Curtains and wallpaper are decorated with lines that mimic Islamic calligraphy - complete with the diacritical marks that are the hallmark of Arabic script  4) Islamic/Arabic sounding music is often played when he is on screen  5) Mojo sometimes will mumble unintelligible syllables, in a manner that strongly resemble a Muslim reciting the Quran.  6) To achieve his goal of conquering the world, Mojo often lies to the Girls and to the people of Townsville, just as Muslims are told to do, in accordance with Islamic doctrines of deception (kitman in Sunnism, taqiyya in Shiism), which stem from the hadith in which the prophet is said to have said ""War is deceit"".  7) Mojo, like devout Muslims, complain constantly of being oppressed, all while carrying out all kinds of evil.   The responses of the people of Townsville, the Mayor, and the Girls also strongly resemble the failed responses of Western governments to Islamic terrorism. The Mayor is scared all the time, and the Girls, who represent the power of the state, are naive about Mojo's design, just like the US government is about Islam.   You can only see and understand these things if you are politically informed about how Islam works, and how it causes its practitioners to behave."

4chan,3cy7my,ZambiaDude,7,Sun Jul 12 04:47:52 2015 UTC,"""the state of being male or female (typically used with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones).  the members of one or other sex""  Technically,  both arguments are correct going by the definition. It can viewed as biological or social, depending on who's talking. It gets murky with some people though, myself included, because the only synonym is ""sex"" and that's strictly biological and nobody ever argues that is used in reference to social constructs.   If you were born with a certain set of chromosomes, you're a dude. If you have the other set, you're a chick. People disagree, but that doesn't make the science behind it any less true."
4chan,3cy7my,Westboro_Fag_Tits,5,Sun Jul 12 06:56:39 2015 UTC,Gender roles are certainly a social construct
4chan,3cy7my,MrAbomidable,34,Sun Jul 12 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"He didn't say gender roles, he said gender, which implies that a group of village elders gathered during a lunar eclipse and invented men or some shit like that."
4chan,3cy7my,Juggz666,13,Sun Jul 12 04:55:17 2015 UTC,"On a side note, just because something is a social construct doesn't mean we should disregard it. Language, money, rule of law, and a host of other things are social constructs."
4chan,3cy7my,0b3r0n,4,Sun Jul 12 05:23:31 2015 UTC,"It's simple, gender refers to your identity while sex refers to your biological status. All identities are socially constructed."
4chan,3cy7my,catoftrash,2,Sun Jul 12 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"Right, like nursing children. As we can see outside of human society, this is not done predominantly by one gender... oh wait, it totally is."
4chan,3cy7my,davorzdralo,16,Sun Jul 12 11:19:52 2015 UTC,"Outside of tumblr, feminist blogs, and sociology classes, the word gender is usually used to refer to sex. See the definitions at http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gender : a :  sex <the feminine gender> b :  the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex  Yes, for a certain definition of gender, it is a social construct. But you don't need to correct someone every time they use the word in reference to sex, because it's a perfectly valid usage of the word. The context makes it obvious what /u/Anglan meant."
4chan,3cy7my,RevealForOne,7,Sun Jul 12 06:21:20 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that gender is evolutionary and instinctive rather than social. Pretty much every society in the world has basically followed the same gender stereotypes since before global travel existed. Just look at the animal kingdom. Mammals, specifically primates, have very similar gender politics outside of learned behaviour."
4chan,3cy7my,StarBeasting,6,Sun Jul 12 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"Well, people just say gender is a social construct, it's really the same thing as sex pretty much, but if you want to get into the new fun definitions of it, gender can basically be anything and literally anything can mean you're transgendered.  Wore pink once?  What about a skirt?  Nantucket red, that's like pink right?  Are you butch (if grill) or effeminate (guy) then you're transgendered.  Enjoy having people forced to take you seriously for being slightly more annoying than a normal annoying person."

They harbour special hatred for anyone they can perceive as a gender traitor, though, and in some amazing leap of logic have decided that trans men dominate all transgender-related conversations. The fact that the male/female ratio amongst trans people is close to even but most people think it's 99% female would like to disagree with them."

4chan,3cy7my,rawrnnn,29,Sun Jul 12 00:39:19 2015 UTC,I've talked with people in classes I've had who have said men can't be raped. One dude said a guy can't be raped because there's no chance for pregnancy. Someone immediately asked if he thought forcible sodomy on a woman wasn't rape either and he just said it was different when the victim is female.   One girl asked another time how a guy could possibly be raped since she doesn't think a dude can get hard in that circumstance. I don't think she considered sodomy on a dude as rape either or she just hadn't considered a dude raping another dude.   Tl:dr - some people are just stupid as fuck.

So, why the mysterious absence of supporting evidence? TheUPisstillascam provides contrary evidence, and for the most part has gone unanswered, except by you, demanding more contrary evidence.

4chan,3cyc70,MrRedditUser420,17,Sun Jul 12 15:16:42 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Also because life over there is very family-centric and outward appearances matter a lot. Not to mention there are so many hierarchical factors in India besides just income. In the US, you wouldnt want your daughter getting serious with a guy with no education who works at KFC, right? Well over there, they also factor all this plus caste, the spouses family, the spouses family's education, the spouses star-sign, the spouses past history with marriages, etc etc. Whether your child loves the person he/she will marry comes nearly last.  This is also why we have a ton of ugly people. Arranged marriage is reaching its long arm into our gene pool, and pulling the 'manual override' lever on natural selection."

4chan,3cyc70,Kakarot_faps,2,Sun Jul 12 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Most of these are down to cultural differences in how we treat people:   Indian guys never tip   Because, here in India, most places add a 10% 'service charge' to the bill (in addition to service taxes), and actively discourage tipping. Plus, by nature, we're cheap. We try to save money wherever possible, even if relatively well off. Tipping just isn't a thing here, and definitely not to the degree it is in Europe, or the States.   always talk down to me and my coworkers   Because you're there to 'serve' them, and therefore, in their eyes, inherently an inferior person.   get really upset over small things   This, again, is a way of asserting their position of power. "" I'm the customer here, and whatever I say goes "". It's about asserting superiority over 'the working class', which is seen as a 'lower' category of people here.   In most other countries, kids in their late teens begin taking up jobs to supplement their income, and eventually sustain themselves. So, they have a much more acute understanding of the fact that their server at a restaurant (for example) is just someone like them. They've all gone through a similar stage in life.  Here in India, we're supported by our parents until we graduate college and get a 'proper' office job, so that sense of entitlement stays with us, and leaves us prone to applying our 'working class' prejudices everywhere else as well.  EDIT: And I've just realized that I'm replying to a 4-day old comment. Awkward."

4chan,3cyc70,tiberius776,4,Sun Jul 12 14:26:09 2015 UTC,"More complicated than that. Living in a culture of scarcity makes people less generous, which in turn erodes trust. Basically, poverty fosters clan formation and isolation rather than a sense of community. That makes people feel less accountable when they harm others not in their circle, leading to douchier behavior. I suspect the lack of media and recreational activity in poor regions also contributes to the douchiness, since there is no exposure to a wider friendly society that would judge people for antisocial tendencies.   Also, living in filth and hunger would piss anybody off."

This verbal diarrhea is hard to read. I assume you're American, I can see the obesity in the speech.   I know, the world and your country is changing. People's horizons are expanding. The world is leaving you behind and you feel as if the only avenue to hate on gays, immigrants and in general, your betters is the internet. It's OK, there's still a choice.  You don't Have to live in that basement for the rest of your days. You can end it. It will be the only real thing you will do, all your life. The greatest contribution you will have is to not consume any more. But, be nice about it. Don't do it pills or clean your mouth out with buck shot. Don't hang yourself. I doubt anything but 1"" steel rope can support you anyway and I don't like the chances of that cross beam either.  Don't make the paramedics and firefighters have to use the jaws of life on you to wrench you from the too narrow basement door. I assume they'll be called there because of the smell first. It's disgusting. You'll probably end up as a bloated corpse photograph on /r/wtf.  Go with some dignity. Strip off the nylon clothes and jump in the river with weights, so you end up as food for the fish and don't have a chance to be a coward and back out. Don't take your cheap clothes with you so they end up as undesirable accoutrements for large sea mammals.  Another way is suicide by cop. This is tricky. You have to make them believe that the butterball in front of them is actually a threat. So, have a live weapon and clean clothes, so you're taken seriously. I doubt you will be a threat even if you wanted to be, so don't worry about hurting them. They won't miss, you're at least 20 times the size of their standard firing range targets at 80 meters.  Last, don't bother leaving a letter. First, your prose doesn't look like it'll improve soon, and your fat digits probably can't work a pen enough for your writing look like anything legible. Second, no one in your life wants to read it. Your mom, I think she may have wanted to read it sometime, but it'll be just another disappointment in an entire life of disappoints. It'll be in some evidence locker somewhere for the rest of its days where no one will care.

Chinese people are generally unhappy, Beijing is a smog filled city, it has a dictatorship which is corrupt to its very core.   Also, there are no mountains of garbage with children playing in sewage or corpses in rivers.   Too right, you've been reading Chinese articles on India. They're killing unborn fetuses inside the mothers and incinerating them, people are jumping to their deaths because they can't work a 60 hour shift anymore. There's nothing you can't achieve if you throw ridiculously high amounts of human suffering at it. The Indian government is a democracy that doesn't believe in killing citizens or in war as a way to enrich the economy. In a country with over a billion people trickle down economics work rather slower, but the results are rather more permanent, as in the case of Europe.  There's a few thousand square miles of oil slick in the gulf and animals with opil slicks washing up on America's beaches. I'll say this about China and the USA, they have excellent sanitation. They hide their poverty rather better. People's tap water is flammable in some parts of America. You don't hear about those, because powerful lobbies suppress those stories. The Chinese will overtake the west as the number one economy soon, and soon after that, India will, because our economy is built on infrastructure, innovation and a skilled labour force. You can't manufacture your way into a strong economy, America tried that. Pretty soon, you have too many people with too much, expecting too much for too little work.

The man crosses the pool without being harmed by staying in their sight out of their reach."

You could say it's a deep bog, but since you don't, he could walk across a shallow concrete pool in a suit of armor.  Doesn't say the person's not carrying anything. You could say he's got nothing but the clothes on his back, but since you don't, he could feed the alligators, or simply distract them, with meat.  Doesn't say the person isn't already familiar with the alligators. You could say the man reached this pool by accident while exploring, but since you don't, he could be their trainer, and they know if they don't bite him they'll get fed soon.  Doesn't say he ever enters the pool. You could say he wades through the pool, but since you don't, he could have just crossed a foot bridge that goes over the pool.  Doesn't say how big the pool is, or where the alligators are in relation to the man. You could say it's a small pool, but since you don't, he could be crossing a massive pool where the alligators don't have enough time to actually reach him because they're out on the far edges.  Yes, some of these are a bit of a stretch for a riddle, but given the information present, those are all viable solutions."

One local restaurant offers the beef and the cheapest in the menu is a $200 extremely small meal.

4chan,3cvztd,cyanydeez,51,Sat Jul 11 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Here is my vision if I were doing a new Ghostbusters movie.  After some badass previews of a new Die Hard, RoboCop, and a redo (not reboot) to the 3rd live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, we see a view of the beautiful nightlife of New York city and the screen slowly starts to focus on a group of kids reenacting Michael Jacksons ""Bad"" and in the middle of it the music stops and the real ghost of Michael Jackson (who is flailing a baby at them by the leg) pops out of nowhere and scares the shit out of all the children. The music resumes and diminuendos as you see the children being chased and the screen pans out and focuses on the only window with the lights on in a tall building. As the camara closes in on the window you realize that there is a person looking out the window and you hear a woman's nasally voice ask ""whats all that racket out there?"" To which Rick Moranis responds ""I think I just saw Condoleezza Rice chase some children. New York is so wierd now."" Rick Moranis turns away from the window and starts to walk towards the couch in the living room and you see Annie Potts sitting there with a bowl of popcorn in front of a tv and asks ""Weirder than being turned into a demonic dog?"" Moranis laughs as he tries to sit next to her all sauve but his elbow slipps off the back edge of the couch and makes Potts drop the popcorn all over the floor. They both in as adorably dorky as possible apologize to each other and they both rush to the floor to try to clean up the mess and at some point they pause and stare into each other's eyes and they begin to slowly move in for a kiss when BAM! Slimer pops up from underneath the floor and decides to cock block Moranis by stealing his kiss. Hilarity ensues as a pissed of Moranis starts to capture Slimer with the popcorn bowl and ""Bad"" starts to play again. Potts, chill as a boss, calmly watches the chaos and slowly reaches into her purse and pulls out a small yellow and black striped electronic device and REVERSE BAM! Slimer is caught, Potts makes a remark about the new redesigned ghost traps and we look back at Moranis covered in slime infront of a now destroyed living room. Camera zooms in on his face and his only response is ""Will you excuse me, I have to make a call"" and then the screen turns black and while the screen is black you hear Potts ask ""Who are you going to call?""  ""The Ghostbusters.""   THE GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO POPS CENTER SCREEN, TRIPPLE BAM! STANDING OVATION FROM EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE THEATER!"

4chan,3ctam2,kindlebluemoon,2,Fri Jul 10 21:57:53 2015 UTC,Personality > looks. I only realized that in my late 20's though.

4chan,3ctam2,TheCuntDestroyer,5,Sat Jul 11 01:08:07 2015 UTC,I had this realization on dating sites. I used it for a month or so as a straight man and got nothing. Then I switched over to just gay and was inundated with messages.
4chan,3ctam2,stridernfs,6,Sat Jul 11 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"Reason:   gay guys aren't slut shamed the same way women are if they are promiscuous so they can message all they like. You would get the same effect changing your online dating profile to be a female. Straight women are used to not having to be the one who initiated the flirting, usually..."
4chan,3ctam2,Invisible_toothbrush,8,Sat Jul 11 04:26:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah slut shaming is stupid, but I don't think slut shaming comes into the equation when women are ignoring just friendly messages that aren't asking to have sex. I never asked for sex as a startup conversation from straight females or gay males, and there were more males wanting to have a conversation because they mostly got conversations about sex.  Women just do not have to try when it comes to finding dates."

4chan,3ctam2,monsda,3,Sat Jul 11 01:03:55 2015 UTC,I dunno. I find lots of guys irresistibly hot and most girls don't find them attractive really at all. The standards for women ARE way higher than gay men. Basically just have a cute face and don't be fat and gays will be all over you.

That doesn't create an extraneous answer.   x2 + 2x - 3 = 0  skipped step 1: (x - 1) (x + 3) = 0  skipped step 2: (x + 3) = 0 / (x - 1) = 0  x = -3   From skipped step 1 to 2, you divide by (x - 1), but since x = 1, you are dividing by 0. That's the only thing you're basically never allowed to do. That's why you can a wrong answer.  EDIT: The actual answer is x = 1. When you divide by (x - 1), you ARE DIVIDING BY 0.

He said that (x-1) equals 0 (cause the solution is 1) so that's why 0 / (x - 1) is diving by 0. It's basically 0/0.  Of course that doesn't fucking matter cause that's not how you solve something like that.  > x2 + 2x - 3 = 0  > (x - 1) (x + 3) = 0  > (x - 1) = 0 AND (x + 3) = 0  > x=1 AND x=-3  Just use your brain and pick the right solution.

4chan,3cs6gm,Ein326,78,Fri Jul 10 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"I've actually spent quite a long time analyzing the story.  GTAV is the first game in the series where the single player narrative and gameplay are fundamentally intertwined.  As an example- in other GTA games, the characters resolve the ending by simply killing all their enemies and winning. And this ending still does come up in option ""C"", to a degree.  But, follow the story arcs, and you have a washed-up alcoholic bank robber who learns yoga and how to reconnect with his family through peaceful conflict resolution, a young black man who has realized the hollowness and futility espoused by ""gangster"" lifestyle, and an entrepreneurial psychopath who has come to realize that he now lives in a world where there's no real place for people like him anymore. In every single possible interpretation of the game, one of the points being driven home is that the old ways are over."
4chan,3cs6gm,Ad__Hominem,45,Fri Jul 10 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"In every single possible interpretation of the game, one of the points being driven home is that the old ways are over.   I agree with you full heartedly, but a point you seem to miss is the rampant hypocrisy in the game. Micheals wife blames him for their dysfunctional family while she openly cheats on him and has numerous affairs, which does more to destroy the family than anything micheal has done."
4chan,3cs6gm,Ein326,24,Fri Jul 10 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"I've noticed you've made several comments about Michael's wife being the catalyst for the problems of the game.  That's simply not true. While I'm not going to excuse her infidelity, the game makes it overwhelmingly clear that Michael self-destructed the relationship entirely on his own. He was having multiple affairs before the start of the game, and withdrawn from associating with his family. She was definitely making things worse, but he was the root cause of the problem.  And, it was his own choice to get back into the game. He was looking for an excuse, any excuse, to get back into the game. And Franklin served it to up him by framing him as a hero."
4chan,3cs6gm,Ad__Hominem,2,Fri Jul 10 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"He was having multiple affairs before the start of the game,   Wait, what? I don't remember this ever being mentioned..."

4chan,3cs6gm,Ad__Hominem,4,Fri Jul 10 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"Literally every problem the characters in the game have stems from them doing stupid 'guy' stuff.  Sure, it's about heists and corruption but so much of it has to do with guys feeling like they have to be men."

One night I'm playing and as I walk out of my apartment I'm instantly gunned down. Great, this shit. Alright, respawn, and killed again by the same guy. I spawn again, get on a bike, and get away before I get killed again. I don't really pay attention to where I'm going, and end up at the top of the map.  I'm still cruising on my bike when I get sniped. That guy from my apartment followed me all the way to the top of the map just to kill me. And again, and again, and again. Then he turns on his mic and says hi. I didn't have a mic in, but he keeps going. He starts saying that I look hot, and I have a nice ass, and he wants to meet me so he can touch me. All while continuing to kill me.  Then it dawns on me that he thinks I'm actually a girl. So I plug my mic in and give him the bad news. The guy quit out of the game after that."

4chan,3cs6gm,iMini,25,Fri Jul 10 20:11:31 2015 UTC,I actually think it would be kinda awesome to have the main character in GTA to be a woman.  It would open up so many different opportunities and storylines.

4chan,3cpwxt,a_monkeys_head,3,Fri Jul 10 02:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, classically that is how you define momentum. If a photon has an energy, E (and we know you can get energy from E = mV2 / 2) then you can simply divide out one of the velocities (in this case, the speed of light, c) to get the expression for momentum p = E/c.  However, the expression p = mV is not meaningful to photons because of... reasons. The best way to describe it is that: you know it takes energy to accelerate an object up to a certain speed (inertia, things resist changes in motion). The heavier an object is the more energy required to bring it up to a certain speed. You could then extend that logic to the speed of light, the maximum speed that any tangible thing moves as far as we know. It would essentially require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with any mass to that speed, so we are comfortable theorizing that photons have energy, momentum, but not any mass.   I'm sure you could find threads in /r/AskScience which would put my attempted explanation to shame."

Everything is just a bit too slick and clean in new CGI and it detracts from the realism, but I assure you, the CGI itself is probably leagues better, just over-utiised. In older movies the environments looked a lot more like when you step outside, but now they're all amazing unreal spectacles, some people like this more, some less."

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

4chan,3coxyi,thipp,8,Thu Jul 9 23:21:39 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

4chan,3coxyi,thipp,10,Thu Jul 9 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist  ”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”  At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.  ”How old is this rock, pinhead?”  The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”  ”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”  The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!  The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.  The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.  Semper Fi."
4chan,3coxyi,thipp,3,Thu Jul 9 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"Dude you need to quit fucking snap chatting mckenna. Stop. She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna ""get some"" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :)"

4chan,3cscxg,J-DAR,12,Fri Jul 10 11:56:39 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but I think he has a point. A similar situation that he could've referenced was Japan where everyone is overworked and undersexed, thus their population is slowly declining because of 1. lack of reproduction and 2. insane suicide rates. If people don't feel like they have a purpose in life or can't have fun amongst themselves or with others, then what's the point of living? Emotions and desires make life meaningful, so to deny those pleasures is to strip away man's right to enjoy himself on a fundamental level."
4chan,3cscxg,J-DAR,2,Fri Jul 10 12:23:52 2015 UTC,Oh I agree he does have a point much of my recreation is illegal drugs but like unregulated pot sales there is a lot of unregulated prostitution in which police look the other way.
4chan,3cscxg,SafroAmurai,11,Fri Jul 10 12:51:53 2015 UTC,"which is why legalisation Kills two birds with one stone. Lonely men are happy because the get some booty and the government is happy because they can regulate and tax prostitution. Furthermore, illegal prostitution is made infinitely more difficult, less common and thus gives the police time and resources for more important things. Like, you know, shooting black people"
4chan,3cscxg,lucidsleeper,2,Fri Jul 10 13:04:43 2015 UTC,He might be a butthurt neckbeard who can't get laid but he's right about the progression of society regarding consumerism of recreational drugs and sex to maintain stability.

This is just me sitting on a couch. I don't remember a ton after that but I like physically wasn't able to think anymore and had to be babysat.

4chan,3cnr3p,carlsaischa,11,Thu Jul 9 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"You've never used arrays? I mean, knowledge of pointers is pretty essential for operations on arrays, and I would imagine that you would use them quite extensively in physics, for storing similar data in a neat way with easy access."

4chan,3cnr3p,Phrygue,6,Thu Jul 9 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"Arrays are pointers in C. Basically an array is just a pointer to the first element in it. Accessing an array like array[0] is the same as *array.

4chan,3cnr3p,henno13,3,Fri Jul 10 11:20:01 2015 UTC,"Still need computer to do full explanation.   Quick and dirty: memory address is a literal location in memory, like 0xff503a00. A pointer is a number that holds a memory address. Pointers take up space on the stack, and can be allocated to the heap.  A reference, much like a pointer is a number which contains a memory address the primary difference between the two is that a reference shares the same memory address as the original variable even though it also takes up space on the stack. Pointers can be reassigned, references cannot be, pointers can be changed with ++ and -- to iterate over arrays, references can't.   Both can be allocated to the heap.   My original comment was how hard this is to explain to someone not technical.   Edit: also a pointer has its own address as well, it's a number sort of like an int but its size is defined by the computer's architecture."
4chan,3cnr3p,OwlVision,2,Fri Jul 10 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, in saying that a memory address is different from a pointer. Instead I was thinking of you meaning something like 32 binary bits that can be used to represent a number from 0 to 232 or '1234' is different from an unsigned int or pointer.   And yes, a reference is basically a const pointer, but is still a pointer regardless. (For most, if not all compiler implementations anyways).  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3954764/how-is-reference-implemented-internally"

4chan,3cnr3p,Kerfulfel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:19:44 2015 UTC,I've kind of wanted to learn coding but don't know where to start. I'm worried whatever language I learn will be outdated by the time I'm proficient in it since languages seem to pop up and change all the fucking time. Where should someone wanting to learn start? C++? HTML 5? JAVA? I really don't fucking know.
4chan,3cnr3p,is_this_4chon,4,Thu Jul 9 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"You can start on any language, the logic stays the same on most programming. Head on to /r/learnprogramming, they can help you better."
4chan,3cnr3p,henno13,2,Thu Jul 9 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"This. As someone who for the longest time only wrote Java and kind of felt bad about it, once you get to know other languages (C/C++, Python, Haskell, Bash, PHP) you realize that they're all kind of the same.  Good programming practices will never become outdated. Hell, C is still the backbone of most of our operating systems, and that's been true for decades."
4chan,3cnr3p,lets-get-dangerous,3,Thu Jul 9 22:37:34 2015 UTC,"This is a very subjective topic, and some of the answers given to you are good ones. However, I just wanted to say that you're afraid of learning something outdated is the wrong way to look at it completely.   Firstly, C was developed in the 70s, and it's still one of the most popular languages today. Leading on to my next point, many languages are fundamentally similar. If you learn Java, you can easily go use that to learn C and vice versa, the syntax itself is very similar and the fundamental workings are exactly the same, same with C# (which is essentially an MS Java clone with nicer features), C++, Python, whatever. Programming is a transferable skill. Once you are proficient in one language, it's very easy to move between them."
4chan,3cnr3p,Icypixel,2,Thu Jul 9 22:45:39 2015 UTC,"My personal recommendation is to start with Java. There are some really good, free ebooks and learning websites where you can get the hang of it in a few hours. Once you feel you 'get' how the language works, it won't be difficult grasp the other popular languages like C++ or objective c, c#, etc. It also depends on what you want to achieve..."

It gives you a very simple overview of how fundamentals work, and you can very easily transfer it over to any modern language."
4chan,3cnr3p,Cunnilingus123,0,Fri Jul 10 17:13:55 2015 UTC,java first. it's strictly OOP and you don't have to fuck around with pointers while you're learning the basics. plus java play and grails are huge right now.

It was just his panel of far left bloggers and sjw types regurgitating the majority leftist opinion on the topic of the day to huge claps and cheers from the audience. They must be using applause and laughter signs for that show because anytime they said anything at all the audience burst into applause and laughter often before they even finish saying a single sentence.   typical nightly show  panel with blogger bertha lovejoy, rolling stone journalist David Everjewstein, rapper Jamal Rapkins and last but not least Some other black guy  I think killing black people and racism is wrong  Cheers and whistling  Well the problem is just that cops and government are killing black people and they're racist and it's bad  even larger cheers and applause  It's really the while privileged male patriarchy, constantly oppressing women and minorities  The audience is in a frenzy of clapping and buzzing agreement  TIME TO KEEP IT 100  Are you Racist at all?  no.  audience cheers  YOU KEPT IT 100!!   Worst replacement for Colbert imaginable.

They are equal in the eyes of the law (equal in a human sense as well), and the facts are the facts.    I'm not even a supporter of increased gun control.

4chan,3cmyd4,RightCross4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:59:53 2015 UTC,You expect that the number will go up if guns are banned ? That kids in detrot should be packing so they don't get killed?
4chan,3cmyd4,KrimzonK,4,Fri Jul 10 11:21:30 2015 UTC,"Your point was that banning guns got rid of massacres. Mass shootings, while tragic, are the smallest contributor to gun deaths.  Detroit has the most strict gun control policies. Has it done any good? Making something illegal does not limit availability to criminals. How is this difficult to understand?"
4chan,3cmyd4,RightCross4,-1,Fri Jul 10 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"There's a huge different between gun control and gun ban. Especially when surrounding states does not enforce  similar measures. Detroit also have higher incidence of gun related crime and crime in general in comparison to other state before introduction of those measures. Don't cheery pick facts to support your argument.  Many countries have successfully and drastically reduce gun related violence by banning guns.  While it is true that criminal will have access to gun, it will make it more expensive and difficult to do so. And even if gun ban ONLY stops shooting spree by removing easy access to firearm from mentally disturbed individuals then that in itself is enough. There's no statistics to show that arming people with guns reduce crime rate.  But you believe what you want."

There are at least 310 Million guns in the United States. 93% of crimes involving guns are done so with illegally owned guns. Restricting gun control does not prevent criminals from accessing guns, as has been shown every single time that gun access is restricted in America.

These rights are not granted by the government, they exist in nature and The Constitution merely affirms that they exist.  When people talk about compromising on gun rights, they are talking about surrendering freedoms. There have already been too many surrendering of these freedoms, The National Firearms Act of 1934, The Gun Control Act of 1968, and more. What part of ""Shall not be infringed"" do you gun grabbers not understand?"
4chan,3cmyd4,Dookiestain_LaFlair,-3,Thu Jul 9 18:44:49 2015 UTC,What a load of shit. Guns aren't a natural right. Guns are barely a thousand years old. How can something entirely artificially constructed be a natural right? This is just bullshit justifications because MUH GUNS.

4chan,3ckua8,ZimBeans,-13,Wed Jul 8 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, to be fair, she did kinda have it coming. Not saying the guy was in the right for being a violent asshole, but you should expect violent assholes to do that kind of shit when you wear a flag that symbolizes something they really don't like."
4chan,3ckua8,Spartanhero613,8,Wed Jul 8 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, so if i wear a t-shirt with the german flag, then some jew should break my nose too?  What about turks, i am slav, so i should beat up every turk that shows his flag. I mean we were fucking slaves too for 500 years,more than murica exsists.  Get over it and shut the fuck up you dumb niggers."
4chan,3ckua8,Kakarot_faps,2,Thu Jul 9 03:08:09 2015 UTC,Why do people care about this shit anymore  It's not like many people alive now were slaves because they were black
4chan,3ckua8,ZimBeans,0,Thu Jul 9 04:47:28 2015 UTC,If you wear a shirt with a nazi flag then yeah I hope a Jew bashes your fucking face in. The German flag isn't the same regime. I'd have no issue with someone wearing the modern Tennessee flag.
4chan,3ckua8,Kakarot_faps,2,Thu Jul 9 03:41:41 2015 UTC,Where i live i would go to jail in about 10min with a nazi flag t-shirt.
4chan,3ckua8,blazkow,2,Thu Jul 9 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"Germany pls. Also the confederate flag isn't ""his flag"" it's the flag of his great great grandpappy. His flag is the Tennessee flag. Now if that Turk was wearing an ottoman 17th century which was known as a country that was famous for enslaving Slavs? That's a legit punch in the face worth too."
4chan,3ckua8,ZimBeans,-1,Thu Jul 9 04:16:41 2015 UTC,Never did I say that they SHOULD. I very clearly fucking stated that they WILL regardless of if they should or not.

4chan,3ckua8,blazkow,7,Wed Jul 8 23:36:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you are saying that I can not support my team because someone else gets their feelings hurt? Well newsflash bud, feelings are gonna get hurt and that doesn't really give anyone a reason to back down. Everyone has the right to fight for what they believe in whether they be right, wrong, good, or bad. Fighting for what you believed in ignited the beginning of America. You have the same bullshit mentality as those ""Russian nationalists"" and tumblrinas imo."
4chan,3ckua8,thezman9225,-6,Thu Jul 9 00:26:42 2015 UTC,"Are you fucking autistic? I mean that while these people who hurt others because they disagree with them are morons of the highest degree, people should not go out of their way to provoke them. It's like being in a cage with a bull and waving a red flag, it is the bull's fault for goring you, but you could have prevented it by not waving that red flag. I'm not using that to excuse the bull, just saying that you walked into it."
4chan,3ckua8,blazkow,4,Thu Jul 9 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"No one should be afraid/unable to express themselves dumbass, that's freedom of speech. The initial situation you described is unlikely in the first place. So lets bring things down to real life with a different flag. Lets say I am walking around with a gay pride flag on my shirt and someone says that what I wear offends them or even they try to hit me. First off, I would never have known that the situation was gonna happen. Secondly, just because I got hit means that I have to shut up because someone else does not agree with me? No, you pick yourself the fuck up and move on with life. Not sit and apologize and coop yourself up in a shell where you hope to not hurt someone's fee fees."
4chan,3ckua8,thezman9225,-4,Thu Jul 9 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I fucking agree. That's the problem though, there are people who think that freedom of speech means freedom to suppress speech. I'm not saying anyone has the right to suppress speech, just that there are dicks who do it anyway, so might as well go with what won't provoke them."
4chan,3ckua8,blazkow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:16:43 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, we shouldn't hide for people who disagree. People do not have the right to suppress speech, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't LET them suppress it."
4chan,3ckua8,RACE_WAR_NOW,-1,Thu Jul 9 01:30:42 2015 UTC,"We shouldn't. But we should accept what will happen as a consequence to our expression, because not everyone plays by the rules."

A bunch of other insurgents started swarming to my location, so I pulled out my KABAR and shanked one of those dirty sand niggers right in the throat, but while this was happening some other Hadji got ahold of my AUG and the fresh mag that I dropped when the sniper nailed me. He loaded it up and tagged me twice in the right lung before I pulled out my Deagle and returned fire as he was squeezing off a third shot.

4chan,3cfh2w,uptotwentycharacters,21,Tue Jul 7 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"Potentially a posse of muggles with non gunpowder weapons > an average wizard. One of the few times muggle/wizard conflict history is mentioned, it's made clear that wizards, on the occasion they were actually caught, let themselves be burned because it was simple to do some charms that would render them immune to fire for a time and appear to be dead.  It's probably a lot more difficult to mitigate people stabbing the fuck out of you. In the books/movies only really powerful wizards like Dumbledore are seen able to deal with threats involving large amounts of non magical damage."

I'm not sure about wand/apparate thing. in Deathly Hallows Ron tried apparating without the wand, but it's hard to tell why exactly he failed. it was in Malfoy Manor's cellar and Luna mentioned it was escape-proof, but we don't know how would it go if it was somewhere else. anyway, Ron was just a big walking ginger failure when it came to apparate anywhere, even with his wand."

A video of a girl cutting her wrist began circulation under the false pretense that it was shot and uploaded by the girl in question (after she died?) that was actually a video of some other random girl who would slit her wrists on tumblr anyway until she lost the use of her hand.

4chan,3cdeq5,TheRealSpoder,2,Tue Jul 7 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"I find that home schoolers are either really smart and creative, really dumb, or really sheltered. In our co-op we had plenty of smart kids who have gone on to do some pretty neat stuff. We had plenty of kids with some sort of autism who were being coddled by their mothers or who were just plain dumb because they didn't put forth any effort into learning. And we had plenty of kids who were home schooled because their parents were very political/religious, which is the worst kind of home schooling.  The sheltering really comes down to the parents, just like every other example of shitty child rearing. There are tons of people who go to public school who are incredibly sheltered as well (Mormon kids, for example). It's definitely easier to be sheltered when you're home schooled, but home schooling absolutely isn't the cause. I think home schooling worked out for me, but it doesn't work out for everyone. It really depends on the kid and the parents and should be decided on a case-by-case basis, which is why I never recommend people home school their kids, even if it worked well for me."

One one hand I wrote a string quartet that got performed at 15, on the other hand, I screenshotted the results of an autism quiz I took online (for a 4chan thread) which surprisingly seems to think I have autism.   http://i.imgur.com/IkOhekw.png  Though I don't really have autism, I am pretty much as antisocial as one could get and I think homeschooling may have contributed to that as well as the smartness."

4chan,3cct16,kpyle,7,Tue Jul 7 13:57:47 2015 UTC,There are two variables. Are you satisfied? Is your wife satisfied? If the answer to both is yes then keep doing what you're doing. If the answer to one or both is no then something needs to change usually.

Essentially you're both working a full-time job, and kids can cause all sorts of extra stress and problems at the most random times and dominate your lives (Again, that's normal).   As long as you're making an effort to satisfy her emotionally and physically, and taking at least decent care of yourself, you should be good."
4chan,3cct16,m15wallis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:29:38 2015 UTC,"It's all relative. In every relationship, there's a High-Desire Partner (HDP) and a Low-Desire Partner (LDP). In one relationship, you could be the HDP if you wanted to have sex every day, whereas your partner didn't; in another relationship, you could be the LDP if your partner wanted to have sex twice a day, while you were still comfortable with once a day. Understanding this, the idea of there being a ""normal"" amount of sex, or thinking that there is a certain number of times per week a couple must keep up to be ""healthy"", doesn't really make sense - no matter what magazines like Cosmo says. Whatever your level of sexual activity, as long as you and your partner are happy, then I say good job - you have a healthy relationship that works.  Also - the above situation is the exception, not the rule. Most couples will have some intimacy / sex related issues eventually. These kinds of problems are normal - so don't sweat it when you encounter them. A resource I found helpful is this book"

We had a small-ish server, a Vent server, and we'd map out projects to work on when we could. Built two or three huge PVP arenas, infinite obsidian generators, sky-castles, hellevators, the works.  One of my bros mods /r/entgaming with me so we figured we'd put the server info in the sidebar and maybe some other people would want to pop in, dick around, maybe try out the arenas and shit. It was a pretty small sub back then (still isn't very big) so we didn't figure much would happen.  After a day, a dude showed up, looted all our shit, and dynamited every last goddamn thing. My other friend, who was running the server, of course didn't have a backup for the world because he's a fucking genius.  I didn't feel much like playing after that."

4chan,3cbnnd,dilplunk,5,Tue Jul 7 00:45:07 2015 UTC,His financial breakdown he produced at his presidential run announcement showed he has around 300 million liquid cash and the rest is tied in various holdings and projected value of business agreements. Among that list and large line items at that were clothing and miss America related stuff but I'm sure those pageants and clothes are worth a lot less now that he's lost major distribution channels tv and macys.

4chan,3cbnnd,accesiviale,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:40:23 2015 UTC,Most businessmen don't have much in liquid cash holding. He's a real estate investor and evaluator so it makes sense that most of his wealth is tied up in those assets.

4chan,3cbnnd,medstoodent345,3,Tue Jul 7 20:06:02 2015 UTC,"No I think YOU need an explanation. Full siblings share (statistically) 50% of their genetic material.  Because of independent assortment of chromosomes during gametogenesis each gamete contains 50% of each parents' total number of chromosomes (46, ""2n""); but not the same set of 23 each time. There are 223 different possible gametes that can be created from the genome of each parent (not even taking recombination into account). Full siblings can actually share anywhere from 0-100% of the same chromosomes but because of the law of averages and the large sample space statistically they are 50% related on average.  Therefore half-siblings share only 25% of their chromosomes (again on average, it could be anywhere from 0-50%) from their one common parent. In this case the size of the population is somewhat irrelevant because no matter how big it is the gene pool is still 25% composed of the same chromosomal material - more than enough opportunity for homozygosity of deleterious recessive traits to occur with relative frequency."
4chan,3cbnnd,demalition90,4,Tue Jul 7 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"You're right, my mistake it's 25%. Still inbreeding and still a huge risk for recessive diseases and traits."

That only helps if you assume that the first generation of children are growing up and then breeding with each others mothers. I guess it's possible? That would definitely be the best way to avoid a genetic shitshow within a few generations.   People seem to overestimate the effects of inbreeding    It's hard to overestimate the effects of an entire population of half-siblings breeding with each other. It's very different than something like Genghis Khan, who was bringing new people/women into the pool from everywhere he went. His children weren't breeding with each other.

4chan,3cbnnd,JACrazy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:25:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the reason we don't inbreed is because if you have similar genes it is more likely that a unwanted recessive gene will come about, and after awhile it can lead to serious defects. However contrary to popular belief this doesn't happen in 1 or two generations, it can take quite a while and a very small breeding pool before it becomes a significant problem. With OP's plan there would be a whole island of women who are not related to each other and as long as sisters aren't marrying their children off to each other it should be fine.  For proof look at how many people are related to Genghis Khan, or look at small island cultures with small populations. or even isolated African tribes.  So TL;DR yeah if the whole island decided having the same dad meant it's ok to go full incest maybe they would be freaks after a couple hundred years, but they wouldn't."

For proof look at how many people are related to Genghis Khan, or look at small island cultures with small populations. or even isolated African tribes.   First off, Ghenkis Khan simply impregnated a lot of women. There is no evidence that his children were all sleeping with each other, like in OP's situation. There's a big difference between breeding with cousins and breeding with half-siblings. Neither is ideal, but half-siblings share 25% of their genetic material.

Given 800 years ago when Genghis Khan lived you fill it about 32 generations (every 25 years) which would mean you have about 4 billion ancestors.

I can link to articles about them. Here is what we think about Khan. And it's even less than the 2% I mentioned. Taken from wiki:  "" Zerjal et al. (2003) identified a Y-chromosomal lineage present in about 8% of the men in a large region of Asia (about 0.5% of the world total). The paper suggests that the pattern of variation within the lineage is consistent with a hypothesis that it originated in Mongolia about 1,000 years ago, and thus several generations prior to the birth of Genghis. Such a spread would be too rapid to have occurred by genetic drift, and must therefore be the result of selection. The authors propose that the lineage is carried by likely male-line descendants of Genghis Khan and his close male relatives, and that it has spread through social selection due to the power that Genghis Khan and his direct descendants held and a society which allowed one man to have many children through having multiple wives and widespread rape in conquered cities.

4chan,3cb1ov,MCI21,59,Mon Jul 6 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"It's normal for American boys who are unsure of or uncomfortable with their sexuality and who are bombarded with non-stop gay stuff all over the media, especially with all the court stuff that's been going on for the past few years. It's a simple exploration of sexuality and boundaries.   In a country like Nigeria, where homosexuality is outlawed, you will see a lot less of it; there is little room to explore when something can get you life in jail. I'm sure there is still stuff going on in private between younger boys, as I'm sure many of us experienced (and rarely admit).   It is definitely weird, though, especially past college age when most people have fully figured out their sexuality. If you are 25 and still grabbing your friend's dick as a joke, well... I don't even know."

4chan,3cb1ov,El_Spacho,16,Tue Jul 7 00:22:20 2015 UTC,"I used to campaign, really hard, that if you have the ability to suck your own dick, it doesn't make you gay. My reasoning behind this was that it's not considered gay to give yourself a handjob (fap) so the same reasoning should apply to giving yourself a blowjob. I would argue that if you agree that that giving another man a handjob is gay and yourself not, you have to give the same logic to the oral type (gay to someone else, not gay to yourself). HOWEVER. I have taken a massive u turn. It is gay to suck yourself off. When normal fapping, you are fapping and looking at something else i.e lesbian porn or a girl getting fucked hard (for straight fags). U are not really thinking about that nice firm penis and rubbing it softly. However when sucking ur own dick, u not looking at something else and only thinking about sucking hard cock. Gay"

Gay     wrong, pic related    it hurts your back at first but after a few nights stretching then you got a good technique down, wrapping your legs behind your neck is the perfect position but that takes a while to perfect due to the stretching etc so you can use your arms to pull your legs down and that helps arch your back and pull your dick closer to your mouth, I focus on the hetrosexual porn on my screen and it's not gay at all bro"

There was a kid we used to pick on in Secondary School who decided to 'transition' after school. I started talking to him on facebook and met up with him at christmas. I took him on a date and treated him like a women, and eventually we went back to his flat. I treated him like a complete cockwhore, and after a few hours of rough fucking I started full on beating the shit out of him, calling him a faggot and saying he should kill himself. I left him in a puddle of sweat, cum and his own blood and took a picture which I sent to a few of my buddies and we all had a good laugh.  That's not gay, that's just alpha."

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo."

As well since we are working with two digit numbers it would make sense to work in mod 100. In that case every two digit number is every other numbers additive inverse (as any two numbers added together equals to 100, the proof of which is left as an exercise for the reader). But sadly ab + 00 = 100 = 00 != ab so we only have 3/4 of the necessary properties to be an abelian group"

On top of them, there's Ulysses, Superboy Prime, Brainiac, General Zod, Bizarro/B-Zero, etc. Most of Batman's villains are pretty fucking dumb too, it's Rocksteady's writing ability that made them good. Plus a Superman game could have more references to the greater DC universe instead of just Batman's rogues gallery of mostly C-listers like Firefly and Copperhead, mostly cause Hades or Black Adam would kill Batman before he could do some internal monologueing."

4chan,3c7rn7,FallenWind,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:24:53 2015 UTC,"Are you comparing that to the current SSGSS Goku though I mean if it's just SS# Superman is gonna win every day, on the other hand SSGSS is at the level of gods, it's reached the point where he should be able to easily destroy realities, Super Buu and SS3 Gotenks could create holes in reality just by yelling really loud, SS3 is so much weaker than SSG it barley register and SSGSS is so much above SSG its hardly comparable. So at this point SSGSS should easily be able to just destroy entire realities with little effort if he wanted to. Current power could simply teleport an insane distance away pinpoint supermans location and blast him with an energy blast so powerful it should be able to easily shatter realities."
4chan,3c7rn7,cosmiccrystalponies,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"That's quite the jump, especially since the most they've been able to destroy is Solar Systems. And plus the reason they were able to put the hole in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber was because of its incredibly wonky nature. Its worth noting that outside of it, they'd never done it again in a fight, not even the villains.   And besides. If it REALLY comes down to it, Superman CAN just phase through all of Gokus ki blasts."
4chan,3c7rn7,FallenWind,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"Well it might be its wonky nature is is true that it was still possible at SS3,which can't even compare to SSG not to mention SSGSS, which someone else pointed out is also no longer even just Ki, but more of a mystic transformation, more along the lines of divine which any divine power is generally classified as magic making superman ineffective against it."
4chan,3c7rn7,cosmiccrystalponies,3,Mon Jul 6 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"Well, if I'm correct, SSJ God is a transformation that is magical in nature, meaning it bypasses Superman's invincibility. Supes would be crushed by a single punch. I might be wrong though"

Light speed is a light breeze to him (though no DBz character can move at light speed).   There are too many characters who can win so I'll keep it to just a simple 2 of the god characters in Marvel or DC. DC has ""The Spectre"", a vengeful agent of God who can warp reality to however he likes, has infinite physical durability if he so chooses and can re-create the big bang. Marvel has the ""Living Tribunal"", who is the Judge across the Multiverse and can depower the Infinite Gauntlet, which has universal level omnipotence.

Bat-God gets annoying, but not as annoying as ""I already have a suit for this"" Iron Man or ""My brain is the biggest deus ex machina in all of fiction"" Reed Richards.  But Superman has 3 weaknesses and regularly fights people as strong or stronger than him. When you pit him against some normal dude, yeah he's OP, he's fucking Superman. So that's why you have him fight Doomsday or Darkseid or Metallo, and leave guys like the Joker to Batman, who would have his asshole absolutely destroyed if he got within 100 feet of Doomsday.   If you think Marvel's heroes aren't OP, just look at The Hulk or Thor's actual comic feats, and not the pussified MCU versions. If there is any superhero stronger than Superman, it's Thor. His fucking hammer alone has more powers than Superman does."

4chan,3c6ybu,RJ815,14,Sun Jul 5 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"It's uncommon for foreigners to clap for the same variety of things that Americans might clap for. Clapping for a national anthem can be seen as odd if not disrespectful compared to the more somber approach other countries can take. One of the weirdest IMO is clapping at the conclusion of a film they really liked, because it's not like that applause is in any way reaching the creators of the film. Clapping for a good or unusual performance at some show is more reasonable, but even then Americans might clap mid-performance whereas other countries might only clap at the end of a specific act or perhaps even only at the end of the entire show.  I'm not sure what, if any, other countries tip their waiters and waitresses. Usually the wage situation is different in other countries to make tipping seem unnecessary, or even outright rude in a ""your employer doesn't give enough of a shit about you to actually pay you properly"" kind of way. Foreigners can find tipping a very bizarre phenomenon because it's mostly restricted to the food industry only (you don't tip your doctor for instance) and because it can feel like a hidden extra percentage on top of the listed price, and some travel guides even describe it in such a way to make it seem deceitful rather than just a cultural thing that isn't commonly questioned by locals."
4chan,3c6ybu,Canuck117,6,Mon Jul 6 02:58:27 2015 UTC,Tips are dumb because the restaurant should pay their own goddamn employees.  Applause because Americans tend to applaud after shit like movies and successful airplane landings.

4chan,3c6f64,xtrmmnmlst,209,Sun Jul 5 08:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah here's a few things. Germany did actually lose WWI quite badly, however the homefront thought they were winning due to propaganda. When the Treaty of Versailles came through one of the terms was the installation of a new democratic governmental system. This new government was then forced to take the full blame of the events of WWI, creating the ""stab in the back"" myth (The myth that Germany wasn't losing but the new government fucked over Germany and stabbed the German people in the back by surrendering). The new Weimar government struggled economically and got fucked in 1923 when hyperinflation occurred. Ultimately this government was kinda okay from then onwards until about 1929, where they got fucked once again due to the great depression and the massive reparation denbts they owed to everyone. Enter Hitler and the NSDAP (Nazis).  Hitler was elected as chancellor in 1932, arguably the best possible time for economic recovery in history as the great depression wound down and by 1934 it was mostly over. Thus the massive job creation. He got the economy on track and managed to recover but it was in line with global economic recovery at the time so while it sounds absolutely incredible, it's not as impressive in the context of the period.  Emigration was always legal, Jews included. Hitler didn't change anything, he just had power to change those things from 1933 and paid no mind to it until a few years down the track.  There were literally no ethnic Germans in large numbers outside Germany by 1939. This was a key factor Hitler's foreign policy called volksgemeinshaft (All German people united under one country). he spent the years from 1933 to 1939 making sure that every major group of ethnic Germans was under German rule (recapture of the Rhineland, Invasion of Czechoslovakia, invasion of Austria, etc.). The real cause of the outbreak of the war was ""polish"" soldiers attacking a German outpost near the border. This of course is a myth/straight out wrong. Many historians believe the attack (which was insubstantial and only involved about a hundred men and was not recognised by the Polish government) was staged by the German army dressing in Polish uniforms and attacking their own outpost on Hitler's orders. Logically Hitler then decided to completely annihilate the country in retaliation for this ""crime"" that he most likely perpetuated.  Russia and Germany teamed up mainly because Poland was weak and Russia are kinda douches but also because Russia was unable to fight a war at that time. There are plenty of arguments that say Russia used the time bought by their non aggression pact and alliance with Germany to accelerate production of war armaments that were later used to fight Germany on the Eastern front. They were most certainly not ready for war and when they did attack Germany later in the war they were severely under equipped, often sharing guns (one between two is an optimistic figure by about 1942) and uniforms/winter clothes (many men in the Russian Army simply froze to death when the winter rolled around). The allies were barely in a position to fight Germany, let alone Russia, which meant that Russia couldn't be attacked at the start of the war and later it was unnecessary as Russia had declared on Germany. The western front was also attacked first as a means of subduing the Allies so that Russia could be attacked after and Germany could successfully expand their country, according to Hitler's policy of lebensraum (living space for the German people), which meant the Allies didn't give a toss about Russia at the time because Germany was destroying them militarily. So while it sounds like a smart argument on paper, the Allies literally couldn't attack Russia and were only fighting Germany because they were invading France. Britain didn't even join the war until a bit after the invasion of France and both economies were completely incapable of supporting another war at the time.  TL;DR Most of what he said is completely wrong or easily explained by looking at the context. I'm willing to bet the documentary is neo nazi propaganda."
4chan,3c6f64,firenine09,25,Sun Jul 5 11:02:54 2015 UTC,"Almost completly correct, especially the fact that the 4chan post is complete bs. Expect for one point.  There were large numbers of ethnic germans outside Germany. In Czechoslowakia there were around 3 million ethnic germans (which is quite a lot compared to the overall population). Most of them were expulsed after the war ended. There were also around 100 thousand germans in Slovakia.   Hitler did use these people in order to justify his aggressive expansion policy towards the east. However it was always his plan to expand way beyond the territoies in which germans settled in order to aquire more land."

4chan,3c6f64,BlackForestMountain,9,Mon Jul 6 02:27:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything u say is true but you leave out that Germany, even though planning to attack Poland, did not intend to do so in 1939 already. They were forced into that position. You might remember Eastprussia? It was once connected to Germany (pre WWI) but this connection was cut off as a ""reputationreparation payment"" for Poland so that they get a coast line. Germany in the 1930s asked Poland multiple times if they were allowed to build an Autobahn or traintrack through Poland's new coastline to have a cheap, easy and economical not destroying way of supplying Eastprussia. Well, Poland due to having the backing of France (who told them in case they get attacked by Germany, they were to declare war) and thus also Great Britain, who had a similar treaty with Poland and France, declined this request by Germany on multiple occasions. Early to the start of the war Germany had three choices:   1) Going bankrupt by continuing to ""feed"" Eastprussia by water way  2) Abandoning Eastprussia and thus giving it most likely to Poland or Russia  3) Declaring war on Poland  Option 1) was no choice for them as they just came out of depression, option 2) was absolutely impossible for the Nazi regime due to their dogma. Thus only option 3) was viable for them even though it was a bit too early for their likings (They were planning an attack but wanted to wait for   a) have France, Great Britain and/or Russia on their side  b) be strong enough to fight of France (mind you that during that time France actually had the strongest and biggest standing army of Europe)  c) Be strong enough to fend of British air attacks  Thus, even though the war was already planned, the timing for it was full fault of Poland  PS: The attack by the way was no surprise for Poland, they had their army already called to arms but were overrun so easily because fighting with horses against tanks isn't the smartest thing in the world."
4chan,3c6f64,aphexmoon,2,Sun Jul 5 13:27:15 2015 UTC,What do you expect when you ally yourself with Western European countries. I didn't know that about the French not helping the Polish but I do know the British were supposed to help Poland if Poland got invaded but they never did. If thats true about the French also then WW2 could have been avoided so much more quickly. Poland is just some insignificant Eastern European country to them and allying with Russia was much better choice.
4chan,3c6f64,BlackForestMountain,-1,Sun Jul 5 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"What you quoted of mine text us absolutely true, and does not contradict yours.

4chan,3c6f64,aphexmoon,5,Sun Jul 5 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Congratulations. you're still buying into Nazi propaganda. The Polish army never charged German tanks at the Battle of Krojanty.

Then we started getting numbers.  We decided to start swapping the numbers around. Randomly. In the end chads were ringing betas. Chads ringing chads. Betas ringing chads. Etc. The matrix was formed.  Weeks later, some guy writes us a message. Furious, he told us how he was receiving dick pics for weeks and rang the party. The guy thought he was our invented girl.

I fought a war my mother forbade me to do. A few wounds down the line, I'm still the bitter asshole I was beofore.  My parents had good paying jobs. But you don't have to be getting rich to enjoy life.(and neither of them made more than 120k a year, her FAR less actually) I am by no means getting rich, but I like what I do. I'm damn good at it. I will not date someone who isn't willing to work. This isn't the 50's anymore."

So the government obviously had dog catchers go out and deal with them. But then tree hugging retards like OP went out and put collars on the dogs so that nobody would hurt them.

When i was in high school all the edgy girls claimed to be bisexual, but they obviously said that for attention.  I think one of the reason its frustrating to deal with in other people, is that if you even broach the idea that its more psychological then physiological, people get hyper offended and call you various names that end with -ist.

So pretty much the only option available at that point, if their dysphoria is too severe for them to cope with, is to transition."

4chan,3c3nof,TroublingMink59,7,Sat Jul 4 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"Studies such as Gorin-Lazard, Audrey, et al [1], conclude there's evidence that high rates of satisfaction for those who undergo HRT exist. A large proportion of those who were dissatisfied were shown to suffer from issues relating to their life in general, how they are treated by people, self perception and issues with integrating into society. But what of the validity of transgender beliefs? Dysphoria is a frequently occurring factor experienced in transsexual individuals and there's evidence to suggest that dysphoria can be measured; Zhou et al (1995) [2] found sex a-typical differences in the stria terminalis of the brain stem when studying transgender subjects, confirmed again in a study by Kruijver et al (2000) [3]. There's evidence to suggest the differences in the stria appear in transgender individuals who have specifically experienced dysphoria and are not present in other individuals. This validates the proposition that dysphoria, as a concept, exists for transsexuals.  There's a wealth of other suggestive studies carried on the brains of transgender individuals. In Luders et al. (2009) [4], MRIs were taken of trans-women brains. There was a significantly larger volume of grey matter in the right Putamen compared to men.  Rametti et al (2011), in their study of trans-women found that trans-women ""differed from both male and female controls bilaterally in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract."" The nature of these differences suggests that some fasciculi do not complete the masculinization process in trans-women during brain development.  After Berglund et al (2008) [5] demonstrated that brain activation in trans-women was similar to female controls (and dis-similar to male controls), Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab (2008) [6] investigated the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus, which is composed of two subnuclei, interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH) 3 and 4. They showed for the first time that INAH3 volume and number of neurons of trans-women is similar to that of control females. The same study includes analysis of a trans-man who also had a INAH3 volume and number of neurons within the male control range.  Schöning et al (2010) [7] found that male controls exhibited significantly greater activation of the left parietal cortex when performing mental rotation tasks. They also they found that trans-women (both those who has started HRT and those who had not), exhibited strong activation in the temporo-occipital regions in comparison to control males.

Success of a treatment for the mentally ill is not usually gauged on personal satisfaction, but rather on their ability to integrate and become functioning members of society following it.   Gender identity disorder, which is where the ideal of mental illness comes from has been replaced by gender dysphoria. It is no longer regarded as a mental illness following new research. Even the poorly written DSM-5 of all things no longer defines gender identity disorder as valid and does not classify being trans as a mental illness. Because it is not a mental illness, we treat like a medical condition, to provide an increase in the quality of life for the individual.   ""Also, for those who had sexual reassignment surgery, most said they were “satisfied” with the operation “but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn’t have the surgery.”   For starters, McHugh's work is incredibly flawed and dated. I've read a lot of his work and it's actually difficult to read; it's that badly written. His citations are of poor quality, referring to the likes of Blanchard and Anne Lawrence, he makes constant assumptions, and it literally reads like you would expect, somebody who really hates transgender people and believes they shouldn't be treated, but fails to provide convincing arguments or quality evidence. In the instance you quote, he refers to research carried out on very old transsexual individuals, who have had less than ideal transitions and are physically not passing.  He then goes on to superficially evaluate their views on their physical appearance as a marker for psychological welfare. How he tries to define psychosocial adjustment by physical appearance just isn't good enough.  As an practitioner he has been widely discredited for numerous reasons. I quote Dr Dan Karasic of WPATH's response: ""McHugh does cite one study from 2011, by Cecilia Dhejne, MD and colleagues at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. However, he misunderstands Dr. Dhejnes work. In the paper, Dr. Dhejne states that the study was not designed to draw conclusions on the efficacy of transgender surgeries, yet McHugh does exactly that. A closer reading of the paper shows that the increased mortality is in those who had surgery before 1989, and that mortality in trans people after 1989 is not statistically different from the general population. A recently published paper by Dr. Dhejne and colleagues shows that the regret rate for those having surgery from 2001-2010 is only 0.3%. Dr. Dhejnes work shows that outcomes for transgender surgery have improved tremendously in the past 30 years, which supports the HHS decision to remove trans exclusions.""  http://www.wpath.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=1635&pk_association_webpage=4905  Evidence that shows that there are brain differences suggest that transgenderism has biological causation."

Transition treatments should be used cautiously but they're still pretty much the only effective choice for severe gender dysphoria (though full transition may not be neccessary for people who have only mild dysphoria).  And yes, I know that Huffington Post is known to have liberal bias. But CNS news also has conservative bias (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercast_News_Service and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Research_Center) so the two might kind of balance out.

Here's the conclusion taken from the actual study:    Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population.

I don't think cancer and being a trans is really equivalent."

4chan,3c3nof,Syntactico,2,Sun Jul 5 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"Well of course you couldn't, because they are not raised in a vacuum. They would see on TV and and school etc what boy are and what girls are and figure out their place based on those queues.   In a parallel universe, boys might be wearing pink dresses, and girls might be into action figures. Gender is definitely and demonstrably a social construct. Its the arbitrary array of behaviours, norms, grooming preferences etc that are assigned to a sex. Pink isn't somehow feminine outside of an arbitrary gender construct.   If you kept a boy isolated from society so they didn't know any better, but raised them as a girl, of course they would think they were a girl. How would they know any different? They would wear dresses and play with dolls and love it because before puberty its all just a costume.   There is no way that I can see that a person KNOWS they want to wear a dress and makeup biologically. This is simply some kind of body dismorphia like any other (some people want to be dolphins, but that's not medically possible so its not catered to)."
4chan,3c3nof,LickitySplit939,3,Sun Jul 5 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"This argument holds up well if you're talking about children, but it crumbles the moment hormones kick in because of obvious reasons.   There is no way that I can see that a person KNOWS they want to wear a dress and makeup biologically.   I don't really understand why this matters. At some point growing up the gender became part of their identity, even if it was a purely social construct (it isn't, because of hormones) how is it relevant to transgenders and sex reassignment surgery?"
4chan,3c3nof,_hlt,2,Sun Jul 5 00:31:25 2015 UTC,"Bottom line: you don't get to determine your sex at birth. Gender is ultimately the sex identity of the brain and other hormone secreting glands in the body - probably a combination of both. If a transgender individual can grow up in this same social environment as everyone else and ultimately identify with the other sex throughout their entire life as opposed to their actual sex which for which the ""proper"" behavior will be repeatedly explained by others in this social construct to that individual and the individual is still ""transgender"" then gender can't be an environmental result. Assigning different behaviors to each sex and raising a child to have those behaviors is a completely different issue."

The general consensus is that it is not a mental illness, backed up by the evidence and research that has been done in recent years. That's why even the DSM-5 states that gender identity disorder is no longer a ""thing"" and that being trans isn't a mental illness."
4chan,3c3nof,ske105,-2,Sat Jul 4 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"Gender dysphoria can be defined as a mental disorder in some cases, but new research goes against this classification. Being transgender is not defined as a mental illness, but some trans individuals can indeed develop a mental disorder (due to a mixture of societal pressures and their own conflict with their perceived gender vs how they feel).  Gender dysphoria ""implies a temporary mental state rather than an all-encompassing disorder"", something which occurs in some trans people for a temporary period of time. It's defined as ""distress and disability"".  Whether gender dysphoria could be considered a mental disorder is a difficult and complex issue, but under the medical systems that exist, it most definitely is required in order for trans people to be treated. It's important to remember that being gay was only removed from the DSM in 1973 and was itself considered a disorder until then."
4chan,3c3nof,ske105,-2,Sun Jul 5 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"Being transgender isn't defined by gender dysphoria, as the DSM defines it, that's the whole point of the change from gender identity disorder. Gender identity disorder implied that any notion of gender difference or transgenderism (it's a real word) means mental illness. Gender dysphoria is just a possible temporary outcome for transgender individuals, which may or may not be defined as a disorder (but is in the DSM).  The issue is complex: www.cognethic.org/cm/cmv3i2_Zhao.pdf&ved=0CB8QFjAA&usg=AFQjCNGRQoA9gjapEVDfZEaH776-Q2GUKA&sig2=gfBLFAeQgZbDFyD23YGokA"

Your definition of homosexuality and transexuality as being a mental illness is not one that I agree with, but I'm not going to be able to change your mind. That's fine, I don't mind what your opinion is, I'm always interested to hear the other side of why people believe LGBT is all mental illness and for what reasons. I personally feel I have good, justified reasons for what I've said, but clearly you believe the same.  I don't feel that you personally have something against LGBT, but maybe it's their apparent demand for rights/hypersensitivity that annoys you? If the vocal proponents bother you then I apologise on their behalf; not all people are like that. Nor do we hate everyone else as the vocal individuals seem to convey. I believe in mutual respect and intelligent discussion. Most everyone wants to have equal (or more) rights to others and also want to be happy and I'm hopeful that's something we can at least agree on."
4chan,3c3nof,shrekter,0,Sun Jul 5 19:53:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your post history goes against your claim as a member of LGBTQ.  I am not wrong. Your opinion of a definition and fact is based upon the DSM 5 which has widely been critised for numerous reasons. The fact that it is currently used does not make it any more an authority than the collective works of more recent quality research and WPATH.  Dysphoria is something that transgender people get, but not all transgender people experience it. For those who have it, it is unlikely that they will have it for their whole life. Therefore it is considered something that is temporary.  For some reason you seem to believe gender dysphoria is equal to being transgender when obviously it's not, they're different terms with different meanings. Not all people have it. Transgender individuals are expressly not in the DSM5, only dysphoria, which may or may not be present.  ""Medicine"" as you say is not always a set of rigid definitions as you seem to think it is. Obviously practitioners are led to follow guidelines, but numerous guidelines often exist for the same condition. In the presence of research, definitions evolve, although it can take a long time. The DSM 5 has many flaws, not just relating to transgenderism; most medical professionals are well aware of its limitations. Yet somehow you seem to think of it as an up-to-date authority, even with Blanchard on the board, who still believes being transgender is fetishistic based upon his poorly written research.   Apparently your need to be seen superior has led you to a position whereby you still wish to discuss an issue to no point. Clearly we have differences but I do not see the benefit of continuing my discussion with you when neither of us will change our minds. Whilst there may not a definitive answer (against the fact that you think that there is), you will indeed find the future will hold definitive proof of what we have discussed."

More than one-third (35.7 percent) of adults are considered to be obese. More than 1 in 20 (6.3 percent) have extreme obesity. Almost 3 in 4 men (74 percent) are considered to be overweight or obese.   Source: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/overweight-obesity-statistics.aspx  The US population is about 320 million people. If two thirds of your country is overweight that's 200 million people. 100 million of which are obese.  Australia's population is about 23 million. The US has 4 times as many obese people as Australia has people.

Their sensitive areas are clearly defined, their eyes are very expressive, their bodies are very expressive and they communicate clearly whether or not they're enjoying themselves; they're basically the Tomy or FisherPrice of sex. They speak in high pitched voices like ""oh no! don't put that there!"" and they have very little hair and nothing that can penetrate you.  How the fuck is that manly?   A man is a tossup. A coin. He can be penetrated or he can flip you the fuck over and penetrate you; its all a battle of will and strength to see who is the strongest which ultimately defines who becomes the fuckpuppet of the other man -- or potentially even becoming a manly throne to fuck the one ontop. They have hair everywhere, fucking beards and are nothing but hard surfaces, sharp edges, right angles and manliness.  He's more like a motor-bike. A big fuck off chopper. You can go fast but you gotta have some fucking common sense. Observe the rules of the road. Wear proper gear and watch yourself because your balls could get roasted by your fucking gas-tank or your legs by your exhaust if you're a fucking idiot. But you will go far faster.

It was only when Vlad the Impaler was truly defeated; sodomized as a boy for the actions of his father as a form of revenge following the man's death that he became the utter monster of a man we know today; and it is only when you have sunk to the bottom and seen the worst of yourself can you truly rise and become the greatest most badass motherfucker you are capable of being.

4chan,3c1noz,TrentGgrims,2,Sat Jul 4 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"To explain the concept of ""heat death"", you have to explain first that not all kinds of energy can be used to do work.  For example, you can take energy from the heat transfer from a hot region to a cold one, since it is a spontaneous process, while you can't convert water to ice in a hot environment and use the energy difference (that's why your fridge uses energy: the spent energy must be at least equal to the one taken from the cold object, and reversely, you can't take all the energy from the ""natural"" transfer from hot to cold; you must take less than half).  From this knowledge, that is, that all spontaneous process go in only one direction (from ""hot"" to ""cold""), it follows that any non-spontaneous process (your fridge) is ""forced"" upon the system, and that, in turn, all energy in the universe will be in a uniform state after all ""spontaneous processes"" have taken its course. At that point, there will be no ""extra"" energy in the universe, and there will be no change for all of eternity. That is the heat death of the universe.  If you want more information, you might want to ask in r/askscience. They will probably give a more detailed explanation . Hope I've been of help."

4chan,3bw244,FUCKRIGHTOFFYOUCUNT,121,Thu Jul 2 22:01:37 2015 UTC,Good lord those sound awful. I imagine it's 99% autistic weebs and le quirky grils with cat ear headbands and 1% 7/10 women who are regarded as 10/10 because they are showing a small amount of cleavage and wearing tights. Basically it's /r/gaming irl
4chan,3bw244,Brobi_WanKenobi,18,Fri Jul 3 00:02:55 2015 UTC,Then there are 2/3 super hot girls though in cosplay with a camera crew following them for their porn site
4chan,3bw244,i_hate_fanboys,9,Sat Jul 4 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"Less cleavage than you think. (unless you go to something big like comic con which is really just an excuse to be slutty. Halloween 2.0)  It's really just tumblr fandoms irl, but toned down a little (since really, very few people are crazy irl like they are online, but you can definitely tell).   Mostly guys and girls. All pretty awkward, but they fit in with each other, so good for them.   Couple of normal people and confident guys/girls that seem really uninterested in whats going on (despite being in consplay for something, so I assume they just don't fit in with the awkward super dorky nerdy animuu crowd).   Seems like fun if it's your kind of crowd.   At least that's my limited experience and having awful luck when it comes to booking hotels. There's always some fucking convention.   The most annoying was some superman convention. Hotels were booked out for miles, I could barely drive anymore, it was like fucking 4am.   But yeah, you won't find any stereotypical 4chan type autistic weeaboos there (at least not many), mostly tumblr level dorks and such. Functional in real life, but definitely not 'normies'. You can tell they're uncomfortable around you, but they know how to do small talk and all that  The amount of home stuck cosplay is always too damn high though."

Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as 'nymphets.'  It will be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones. In fact, I would have the reader see 'nine' and 'fourteen' as the boundaries—the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks—of an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea."

I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don’t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you’re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The “epic” Banana guy, isn’t it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it’s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that’s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she’s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even try to talk with you because all you say is “I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE.” You’ve become a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he’s done a million times now. And that’s all you’ll ever be."

They use WebMD to self diagnose; Sadness becomes bipolar, mood swings become multiple personality disorders, and being insecure becomes social anxiety.

I haven't seen it being used to describe anything but state of mind.  Like if you were really angry you wouldn't be in a good headspace to make good decisions, so you'd calm yourself down first (or just make bad decisions.  I'm not the boss of you).  If you're bored and fidgety you're not in a good headspace to learn something.  It's thrown around a bit when people talk about meditation.

4chan,3btc4o,ChessPiece19,44,Thu Jul 2 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to the History of China podcasts. The Northern Wei dynasty was so scared of emperor dowagers (the mother of the crownprince, who'd be in total control if the emperor died and the prince was too young, like Queen Cersei before Joffrey's crowned), that they had a rule dictating that whenever a prince was declared crown prince, the mother had to be killed.  If an entire dynasty of emperors is obligated to kill their wives whenever they declare a crown prince, it says something about how much they fear their wives to be in total control after their death. History shows repeatedly that there is quite some reason for this, as time and again empresses would kill their husbands and groom the crown princes to gain total control themselves.  At that time, being in total control of China was god tier."

4chan,3btc4o,Spartanhero613,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:20:30 2015 UTC,"The Northern Wei dynasty had this giant manned wall in their frigid north where they fended off barbarians. It used to be an honourable occupation at first, but eventually, being sent to the wall was a punishment and it was manned merely by criminals.  The Han dynasty (iirc) had fallen because a eunich with an extensive spy network had manipulated his way into control in court.  Several Chinese empresses have killed their husband to rule as an empress dowager until their child came of age, and usually kept control even when the crown prince was crowned, by letting the spoiled brat have fun.  The war of the roses between the Lancasters and the Yorks was ended when the Yorks claimants to the thrones had been killed and the Lancaster heir married a York princess.  Venice was a city built on thousands of islands, and it had a large control over the world via its trade and its bank.

Essentially the bible says to rest on the seventh or Sabbath day and Shmita is an entire year that is meant as a sabbath year.  A lot of things happen during a Shmita year. Most people just don't pay enough attention. Shmita is a year of blessings, where debts are removed for those who have done God's will, and a year of judgement for those who have disobeyed it.               Look back at the last 14 years. The year of Shmita ends in September. 2001 and 2008 were Shmita years as is this one. September 11, 2001 twin towers. September 29, 2008 stock market crash.

According to Christianity, Jesus died in order to wipe away that sin.   ...   Do not think that I have come to do away with or undo the Law or the Prophets; I have come not to do away with or undo but to complete and fulfill them.  For truly I tell you, until the sky and earth pass away and perish, not one smallest letter nor one little hook [identifying certain Hebrew letters] will pass from the Law until all things [it foreshadows] are accomplished.  Whoever then breaks or does away with or relaxes one of the least [important] of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least [important] in the kingdom of heaven, but he who practices them and teaches others to do so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  For I tell you, unless your righteousness (your uprightness and your right standing with God) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   ^ Matthew 5:17-20 AMP   What shall we say [to all this]? Are we to remain in sin in order that God’s grace (favor and mercy) may multiply and overflow?  Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?   ^ Romans 6:1-2 AMP  To fulfill the law means to obey it, in a sense. It means that Jesus fulfilled the law such that we don't have to. That regardless of our actions, if we follow Him, God considers us in obedience to the law, in regards to our ultimate judgement and where we go after.  But Christianity isn't just about the binary thing of Heaven VS Hell. Jesus is the solution to that part.   It's also about our relationship with God, which our sin has an affect on. Just because God calls us square for our ""after"" life (paraphrased) doesn't mean we are free from the effects that sin has in this life between us and Him.   TL;DR: Jesus didn't abolish the law. We don't have to fret about fulfilling it to not be damned, but we should strive to anyway to be closer to God.  Edit: removed references from where I copied the scriptures from (such as [a] and what-not)."

However, there are two kinds of laws in Leviticus. Social, and moral.   Social laws are the ones I just mentioned. These are in place to distinguish the Jews from the Pagans, as the Jews were God's people.   The moral laws includes things like homosexual acts, bestiality, murder, what have you. Things that God said were immoral acts, not to be indulged in not just to be set apart from the pagans, but because they were sinful in and of themselves.  Christ died to fulfill the laws. This doesn't mean that all laws were obliterated(although some were), only the social laws. This means that Christians no longer have to be set apart from pagans, as in Christ ""there is neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female,"" etc. Which is to say that anyone who believes in God can be saved, not just Jews.

I will be their God,     and they will be my people. 34 No longer will they teach their neighbor,     or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me,     from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord. “For I will forgive their wickedness     and will remember their sins no more.”"

4chan,3bsd3v,Andreus,31,Wed Jul 1 23:33:35 2015 UTC,"Notice, how all the anti-gay lines are from the book of Leviticus... I submit, for your reading pleasure, some other choice no-no's from Leviticus: Going to church within 33 days after giving birth to a boy (12:4) [Actually, she’s unclean a week, and then another 33 days. Then she has to offer up a sacrifice.] Going to church within 66 days after giving birth to a girl (12:5) [Actually, she’s unclean a week, and then another 66 days. Then she has to offer up a sacrifice.] Reaping to the very edges of a field (19:9) [To be left for the poor. No penalty given.] Picking up grapes that have fallen in your  vineyard (19:10) [To be left for the poor. No penalty given.] Mixing fabrics in clothing (19:19) [No penalty given.] Eating fruit from a tree within four years of planting it (19:23) [No penalty given. May only apply to fruit trees planted in Israel.] Trimming your beard (19:27) [No penalty given.] Cursing your father or mother (punishable by death) (20:9) [Death, as noted.] Eating fat (3:17) [That one’s “a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.” All fat is to be saved for offerings to God. Normal penalty.]    So yeah... gonna take his book with a grain of salt... which I really should be including in an offering to God: Failing to include salt in offerings to God (2:13) [Normal penalty.]    The point is, the Bible may contain solid lessons about morality and how you should treat people, but it was written THOUSANDS of years ago... By men, not God. It may be the word of God as they believe it, but that doesn't make them or it infallible. Interpretation needs to adapt and evolve to the times. Some time ago, it was written that the Earth was flat, by learned men. We now know that it isn't. Just because something was written by someone or some people to whom we ascribe authority doesn't make it dogmatic.

And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.1 Corinthians 6:9-11       That's New Testament. Leviticus can be a little wierd but those were the old laws that Jesus died so we no longer had to follow to be saved.

That sure does seem a lot better than the US pal! Where you can just walk in, buy a gun, and walk out, own unlimited amount of anything, defend yourself in every state, and in most states you don't have the police coming in."

The type of guns and ammo you can buy is restricted in the US as well.  Why would you want to display your gun? Your firearm shouldn't be shown unless you intend to use it. Furthermore brandishing is illegal in some states.   Where you can just walk in, buy a gun, and walk out, own unlimited amount of anything   That sounds terrible, probably the reason for your ridiculous gun crime rates.  We don't care about defending ourselves because our country isn't a third world war zone. How would a gun allow you to defend yourself anyway? The criminal's going to be armed as well."

Probably another couple of thousand total I  other games.   edit: 850 hours each on Civ 5 and Vicky 2, 900 on CK 2. I'll tack on another 100 hours each for offline time.  4500 hours total for steam games (accounting for estimated offline times), 80 hours in the Witcher 3, I'm going to estimate 500 hours for minecraft (used to be part of some faggy worldbuilders but the mods were assholes when they got slightly famous with 376 hours on Origin games and I'll estimate 400 hours for uplay games as it's faggy and doesn't give gameplay time on its app.   Overall 5856 hours on PC gaming accounting for offline time."

4chan,3bqw2i,dickholedoug,6,Thu Jul 2 03:59:05 2015 UTC,Life as no inherent meaning.  Everything you do is a distraction so time passes faster and you don't have to think about how meaningless life is.

4chan,3bqw2i,dickholedoug,2,Wed Jul 1 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"This is true if you think about life from the perspective of the universe.  If you think about life from your own perspective in a given moment, life is about acting in a way that makes you feel very good in that random moment, since you have a limited amount of time and you want to be happy most of that time. Life is objectively easier if you are happy (since you don't even notice that you are alive and time is passing).  So yeah, in the grand scheme of things life makes no sense, but to you as a living human being your actions make sense, since they decide how you feel (and feeling good is better for you than feeling bad)."

4chan,3bqw2i,anon445,53,Thu Jul 2 00:46:08 2015 UTC,The reason why time passes is because you enjoy them.

4chan,3bqw2i,anon445,0,Wed Jul 1 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"I feel you, I think there's two types of time going faster - actually losing track of it while being fully conscious, and then there's the times where you're on autopilot and time seems to fly, but only because you're on autopilot. Like when you're working a monotonous job or driving a long distance."
4chan,3bqw2i,gummz,10,Wed Jul 1 21:42:20 2015 UTC,So what your saying is that you don't like Bejeweled so therefore  it only exists to burn time.
4chan,3bqw2i,IlIllIlllIllIlI,-3,Wed Jul 1 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying no person gets anything out of it other than their attention in order for them to pass time more quickly. It's like any other repetitive task that can get a person into the ""flow state.""  It's a state that's generally pleasant (in fact, it's what makes most games ""good""), but there's not much else to be gained. You could enjoy almost the exact same experience by sitting there with your eyes closed and being more than a novice at meditation.  EDIT: If anyone has reasons for playing it other than passing time and getting in the ""flow state,"" please speak up. I'd love to hear your perspective."
4chan,3bqw2i,anon445,3,Wed Jul 1 21:31:02 2015 UTC,It's actually incredibly satisfying. Easily addicting.

4chan,3bqw2i,anon445,2,Wed Jul 1 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"No, that doesn't explain it at all. When you finally get that one Tetris piece that annihilates a half dozen lines? That is not ""flow state,"" that is the simple satisfaction of reward. Bejeweled is like that only more satisfying.  Of course it's a waste of time, but your waste of time has no extra validity over  Grandma's."
4chan,3bqw2i,HowTheyGetcha,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"Alright, I can buy that. Continuous seeking of those micro-releases from dopamine, which also explains the addictive nature of it.

4chan,3bqw2i,anon445,2,Wed Jul 1 22:41:55 2015 UTC,"My mother plays Bejeweled, Tetris, et al on recc of her Stroke doctor. Anything to get her to focus & (hopefully) fix neurons. She used to play Morrowind before the strokes tho, so I've no idea what the medical basis is."
4chan,3bqw2i,plenism,3,Wed Jul 1 23:48:29 2015 UTC,Anything to get her to focus   It's why these games (and meditation) can be healthy. They improve concentration and can even lower blood pressure/heart rate (really depends on the game) and make a person physically (but mostly mentally) healthier.
4chan,3bqw2i,anon445,3,Thu Jul 2 00:06:16 2015 UTC,I understand how folks don't get what you are saying. It's a simple concept.

4chan,3bu6tj,RETRACTDONG,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"Fent is really strong, and usually administered in nanograms. People can have vastly different ceilings on fent, and effective dosages can vary. I used to be able to take up to 200ng (patch form) of fent without ODing, whereas you might not even be able to take 10. You'd at least get sick from it and have to take it off. This is also why so many addicts die from overdoses, because heroin is laced with fent (due to how much cheaper it is to cut. I think it might be heavier as well).

Or are you just regurgitating what you hear on TV?   It's funny, basically anyone in a position of power is suddenly ""power-hungry."" People call their bosses power-hungry, politicians, etc. What a coincidence, the people that have authority over other people frequently get called ""power-hungry."" I'm sure that has nothing to do with those people's own feelings about authority. In the sense that police have power and the cops sought out those jobs, yes. But you're making a sweeping generalization and even if it was true, this isn't an illuminating insight. But if I had to characterize it, ""stupid overused cliches that don't actually contribute anything to the conversation"" is probably the strongest theme of your post, so...   with low intelligence   Here's where your autism kicks in and you feel the need to let everyone know that you're smarter than the cops. And you use another sweeping generalization to do it. I'm not saying you have to be a brain surgeon to be a cop but it takes more smarts than many other non-degree jobs out there (and many of them do have degrees). I worked closely with a private security company and the bulk of their employees were washouts who failed the entrance exam for the city or state academies. The mere fact that you need to pass things like that to get the job already puts it well ahead of a large chunk of the American workforce. Now maybe you don't need to pass tests or learn criminal law to serve on the force in Podunk, but you certainly do for many of the major city departments and all state troopers. But you're just talking out of your ass and making generalizations, so you wouldn't get into the nuances between different departments or types of cops.   who are ordered to spend most of their time annoying people over petty bullshit, all while getting payed by us.   Really? The commissioner says ""hey, go out and annoy people over petty bullshit?"" It's a huge conspiracy just to piss you off, right? Politicians would love to go to their constituents and say ""crime is down"" which would mean police would avoid making arrests if possible (not to mention they avoid the paperwork). And I think you're confused over what a police force is. They're not there to pick and choose the laws they enforce. If the law is that marijuana is illegal, whether the cop thinks that law is stupid or not, he's supposed to bust you if he sees you smoking a joint. The mouthbreathers of this country see that and get mad at the cops, and then they go elect the idiots who make stupid law after stupid law over and over and over. The politicians are the ones who emphasize or deemphasize enforcement strategies. You think the War on Drugs came from some ""power hungry cops?"" Seriously? But fuck da police is so much easier, right?  Cap it off with ""all getting payed by us"" like that is news to anyone who can zip their fly without getting their dick caught. Yes, the police get paid by the state. They are positions that are funded through taxes, just like a gazillion other positions. So fucking what?   There are some great officers who actually care about helping people but as things are set up now the police in general are shit.   Summing up: SOME ARE GOOD SOME ARE BAD MOSTLY BAD THO. This devastating insight brought to you by the same man behind ""power hungry people with low intelligence."" And ""as things are set up now?"" Could you be any more vague about that? What is the nationwide ""set up"" that makes police in general shit? (This is all rhetorical by the way, I really really don't care what you think).  Rather than recognize that these are complex issues and there's likely huge variation state to state and city to city, you instead made broad generalization after broad generalization to ultimately arrive at the conclusion that the police are big meanyfaces out to get you. Oh, and you're also smarter than them, coincidentally. It's an oversimplification, it's not an original thought, it doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the conversation, and it's not well-thought out. That's what made me think that you were of ""low intelligence.""   Then, after asserting your superiority over an entire group of people, the cherry on top was you making a boneheaded spelling error. I would let that go in 99% of posts because most posts aren't people talking about how dumb they think everyone else is. I will say that it's that special kind of spelling error - not a typo, not something that can be blamed on autocorrect. No, see you typed out ""p-a-y-e-d,"" which is honestly kind of troubling. Those of us who learned the word ""paid"" in the 3rd grade pretty much closed down the door in our mind to ever typing out ""payed,"" even absentmindedly, because it's not a word. It'd be like if I called you an asswhole. Now, it's not a big deal, that extra w, but the fact that it snuck in there points to the fact that maybe, just maybe, some part of me thinks it could be spelled that way."

4chan,3bpt2r,Crispyshores,3,Wed Jul 1 11:41:00 2015 UTC,That's because the shit restaurants you eat at don't use POS systems. Try going somewhere nice.
4chan,3bpt2r,broman_dude,21,Wed Jul 1 12:26:04 2015 UTC,"That's the case at even the nicest restaurants in a lot of Europe.  We don't sign, we use chip and pin, so a portable pad is brought over to put your card in and put in your pin.  Never leaves your sight."

4chan,3bpt2r,krippington,8,Wed Jul 1 11:49:10 2015 UTC,"Chip and pin doesn't mean a thing when making online purchases, like Netflix."
4chan,3bpt2r,sprakes_,7,Wed Jul 1 13:48:04 2015 UTC,My bank has 2 factor authentication (card info and SMS with one-time code) when paying online. Welcome to the IT age.
4chan,3bpt2r,MrLethalWeapon,5,Wed Jul 1 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"Right, but Netflix trial doesn't charge anything. It just asks for a valid credit card so it CAN charge you at the end, which won't happen since you will cancel after the trial ends. 2-factor authentication doesn't matter if the amount doesn't even show up on the card."
4chan,3bpt2r,HoggleSnarf,2,Wed Jul 1 16:11:02 2015 UTC,I like this. I hope to see it implimented in more places.
4chan,3bpt2r,kingsizeddong,4,Wed Jul 1 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"I was responding to a comment about paying by card in a restaurant. If I'm paying via chip and pin, the waiter isn't gonna be seeing my number, hence he can't get Netflix with my card. This isn't a hard concept, honestly."
4chan,3bpt2r,RomeroGoon,6,Wed Jul 1 14:36:41 2015 UTC,"chip and PIN is broken, man in the middle attack can prevent the PIN from being verified."
4chan,3bpt2r,ghost-of-harrenhal,3,Wed Jul 1 11:57:09 2015 UTC,"The only ""man in the middle"" attack I've been involved with is when someone is stood in the middle of an already weak bluetooth signal between the payment terminal and the card reader, and the poor waiter/waitress/waitotherkin can't quite grasp that the reader is auto-declining the transaction because there's no connection, as opposed to not being authorised by the bank.  The card's fine, stand closer to the dammed base station!"

4chan,3bpt2r,im_so_random_xd_lol,140,Wed Jul 1 14:33:02 2015 UTC,Perfect crime. Saves $8 a month. Could go to federal prison for 15 years if caught.
4chan,3bpt2r,TriangleWaffle,144,Wed Jul 1 13:21:35 2015 UTC,Cancelling BEFORE end of the trial would be a smarter approach.

4chan,3bpt2r,WEINER_SCHLAP,43,Wed Jul 1 12:55:43 2015 UTC,This scheme to save $8 a month seems pretty annoying to keep up with.
4chan,3bpt2r,Futuramafryday,31,Wed Jul 1 11:33:43 2015 UTC,"NEETs, uh, find a way."
4chan,3bpt2r,Mr_Strangelove_MSc,14,Wed Jul 1 12:43:30 2015 UTC,I think it would probably take about 15 mins to create an account and maybe 15 to delete. so that's a half-hour of effort to save 8 bucks a month. that works out to be more cost effective than paying if said person's wage is less than 16 bucks an hour. I think.  Also maybe I'm talking out my ass.
4chan,3bpt2r,cakeandbeer,13,Wed Jul 1 12:59:34 2015 UTC,Shit when I start getting paid $16 I might consider not stealing netflix
4chan,3bpt2r,accepting_upvotes,10,Wed Jul 1 14:26:20 2015 UTC,You're not taking in account the ordeal of copying a person's credit card info and...you know... Repeatedly doing something illegal.
4chan,3bpt2r,NormalNormalNormal,6,Wed Jul 1 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"It's perfect for someone who wants to experience the thrill of stealing without (some of) the moral and ethical baggage, and who also digs Netflix.  The best part is that you don't have to be bummed out over having to create new profiles because Netflix's recommendation algorithm sucks so damn much now."
4chan,3bpt2r,dafuzzbudd,5,Wed Jul 1 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"You also have to nick their credit card, then put it back again."
4chan,3bpt2r,Izlud3,2,Wed Jul 1 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much at any crappy job you can make more than that in an hour. The whole process of stealing the info, making the account, and cancelling probably takes almost an hour.  I refuse to believe anyone is stupid enough to think this was a good idea.  Also how can you so easily steal a different person's credit card info every month without getting caught? I mean do people really just leave their credit cards lying around in front of him?  I know the story is made up, but he should at least make it believable."
4chan,3bpt2r,vagina_fang,21,Wed Jul 1 20:16:15 2015 UTC,36% of American homes have a Netflix account.  This doesn't sound like a great scheme

4chan,3bpt2r,ClassyJacket,14,Wed Jul 1 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"It is two concurrent screens. As long as not all 3 are in use at the same time you are fine.  If you try to use all 3 at the same time I think it even just blocks you from doing so, no problems created."
4chan,3bpt2r,Scrub_Printer,4,Wed Jul 1 12:55:15 2015 UTC,That... makes a lot more sense.  Blocking you from accessing when you happen to use many different machines seemed like a very EA thing anyways.

Then get green peppers, onions, lettuce, ranch on top and then a few shreds of lettuce on the ranch to keep the ranch from sticking to the wrapper when they roll it up.   Make sure to get macaroni salad, the sweet potato chips (as part of the combo) and another bag of sweet poatato chips because they are so good you will want to eat a whole bag with just half a sub. Also get some of the sweet rolls too. This should set you back about fifteen dollars, but it sub is a good two meals."

McCarthy does rely too much on her shtick. I'd blame that more on Hollywood than anything. She's been in other movies without falling back on it, and has done a really good job. This being a comedy though, I'd imagine that we're going to see her play the bumbling fat girl.   The only one I don't like is the Leslie Jones. I'm hoping they aren't going to play her as the angry black stereotype, the only characters she seems to play on SNL."

If they are not willing to accept the bail out terms, and are willing to risk the Euro zone as a whole, they should not be a part of it."
4chan,3bohic,chsmith1,4,Wed Jul 1 08:32:45 2015 UTC,Austerity is the last thing a struggling economy needs. Trying to extract money from Greece is only going to weaken their economy further. Germany is bowing to the demands of the international creditors who made bad loans. The best thing for Greece would be to leave the Eurozone so they could create their own currency.
4chan,3bohic,willardmillard,3,Wed Jul 1 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"Creating a currency based on their economy at this moment, baring in mind that they are the first developed nation to default on the IMF in modern history, would mean the currency would be worthless. Which would mean the people of Greece, which hold there money in Euros would lose out as they change to the new currency. In 2011 German and France should not have bailed out the creditors and took on the debt. They should have let the private creditor go bankrupt. Austerity may not be the best thing but it is what Greece needed, after changing to the Euro the Greek government went mad, over spending on unnecessary investments - 2004 Olympics, the biggest recycling plant in Europe (unused) and a massive investment in the railways without increasing the cost of the investment to the customer  (which most governments/companies do) but on to the taxpayer.  If they did have their own currency, I'm sure they would just over spend and quantative ease, which would more than like lead to hyper inflation. They should accept the terms and stuck in up."

She went on to explain to me that by time I was born she had already lost her virginity and she was already giving mad bj's to chaps in Dublin. After banging her that night we went in for one more session in the morning before we both left for work. Luckily I didn't catch anything. Ended up losing contact but heard a story few years later they were all at a local watering hole in Singapore when a round of Jäeger shots were offered. She said that she would rather drink cum than that horrible Shit. Cue their mate picks up fresh shot glass, walks to bathroom, rubs one out into the shot glass, returns with a fresh organic 38 degree steaming shot of one's finest natural jizz that money can't buy. Without hesitation she nails it down and licks the glass clean. I fucked that and came out clean. A true wtf moment in life."

4chan,3bn50k,RobMillsyMills,15,Tue Jun 30 19:08:31 2015 UTC,"I met and flirted with Lindsay Lohan last year without realizing who she was.  Last year, I vacationed overseas. I was at LAX waiting in line at the security checkpoint - big-ass line of people. All of a sudden people started murmuring quietly and I could hear the clicking and beeping of camera drives, so I turned to see what was up.  Walking down the terminal bridges from the parking structures was a flock of paparazzi. They were pointing their cameras in my general direction, so I knew there had to be a celebrity close by. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a woman out of the corner of my eye.  Standing besides me, outside of the line and escorted by two suited men, was a very attractive redhead, dressed down in casual clothing (typical for celebrities in public here in LA). I barely had time to think of something before she turned her head and we made eye contact.  ""Now look what you've done,"" I said.  She looked puzzled.  I maintained eye contact but nodded my head sideways in the direction of the paparazzi. ""You've led them right to me. What were you thinking, woman?""  She smiled big and turned towards me. There was a brief, intense moment of silence and then she said ""I'm sorry. It was careless, wasn't it?""  ""This is a bad way for you to start our relationship. But I can forgive, under the right circumstances.""  We walked very briefly. The bodyguards she was with were trying to get her priority screening, so there wasn't much time to work - but she was into me. I didn't give her beauty or her apparent status as a celebrity any credence, and I dropped one cocky neg after the other. By the time her escort ushered her through, we were at the topic of sex and she was laughing. I'm sure that with some fast talking, luck, and a blatant disregard for my own personal safety I could have cleared security along with her by just insisting hard enough - but I didn't feel ready to start some shit at an airport. Not before my flight, and not just for some pussy.  So we parted ways without ever exchanging names. She went through the checkpoint.  After she'd left, all of the other girls in the line were making huge fucking eyes at me and smiling. One guy in the line said ""Duuuuude..."" and gave me a brofist.  ""Who the fuck was that?"" I asked him, bumping fists.  ""Dude, that was Lindsay Lohan.""  I had no idea who that was. I think he saw the obliviousness in my face because he laughed.  Well, now I know."

4chan,3bn50k,umop3pi5dn,7,Wed Jul 1 13:53:16 2015 UTC,"Last year, my mom made me go to my gay aunt's house for a family reunion in Milwaukee. I was at LAX waiting in the security line with my mom, playing Pokemon Silver on my GBA. All of a sudden people started murmuring quietly and I could hear the clicking and beeping of camera drives, so I turned and said, ""Moooooooooooommmm, what the fuuuuuuuck!!""  Walking down the terminal bridges from the parking structures was a flock of paparazzi. They were pointing their cameras in my general direction, like a bunch of faggots. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a woman out of the corner of my eye.  Standing besides me, outside of the line and escorted by two suited men, was a very attractive redhead, dressed down in casual clothing (typical for celebrities in public here in LA). I barely had time to adjust my fanny pack and tuck my meme tshirt into the waste band of my underpants before I diverted eye contact with her.  ""Uh...h...hi..."" I said, in an almost inaudible whisper, with buzzing ears. I could feel my face becoming redder by the moment.  She adjusted her sunglasses and looked down at me.   I shuffled and adjusted my weight between my feet, staring intently at my belly and socks and sandals.  ""H....hi.."" I squeaked again.   She gave me a weak and completely uninterested smile -- kind of like the smile you'd give to a sick old dog begging for table scraps and then she said ""Hello"" while checking her phone.  ""M...m....Mean g...girls w....was a g...good m...movie..."" I managed to blurt out unevenly. By this time some people were watching me.  I tried to talk with her more, but by that time she had gotten a phone call. I tried to think of more movies, or even some tactic I read about on /r/TheRedPill. My moment of glory was slowly fading as the woman and her escorts began to wander away.  Suddenly, the line had begun moving and mom gently tugged at my shoulder. ""Quit it, bitch!"" I screamed and darted off toward  m'lady.  ""W...wait..."" I huffed, ""T...take me w...with y...you!""  I caught up to them and tried to grasp her hand. She let out a shriek and I was immediately tackled to the ground by one of the suited men. Some of the girls that had been in the line were now around me, as a heavy knee pressed against my throat. Their eyes were all wide as they took videos and pictures of me on the ground.   One guy from the line shouted, ""Dude! That neckbeard tried to touch Lindsey Lohan."" Then he gave me the finger and lauged right in my face.  That night in prison I beat it so hard to her and my brief moment together."
