Chevy,3e2l4f,nRRe,3,Tue Jul 21 13:54:57 2015 UTC,Seems to be a lot of cobalt SS/TC's on here lately! And a sedan too. Those are pretty rare!
Chevy,3e2l4f,lpg975,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"well they only made the SS/TC Sedan in 09.  mines 1 of 63 in the ""Sport Red Tintcoat Metallic"".  Kinda cool to think about sometimes."
Chevy,3e2l4f,lpg975,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. I just have a black 2008 SS/TC coupe. I wanted yellow or blue, but I would have had to travel way too far to find one. One well, I still love my slobalt!"
Chevy,3e2l4f,ledzepp3,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"i refer to it as the Brobalt =)  and yeah Yellow would have been awesome to find, i think they only made like 15 yellow sedans."
Chevy,3e31p4,TheNaud,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"My family has been driving Chevys for quite some time, I've never in my life experienced an ad that was tailored to me through Onstar. Ever. We've gone through phases of paying for Onstar and not paying for it, and still, never got an ad of that sort. There is a way to remove Onstar from the car, I'm not personally able to do it, but if you google it, I've heard it takes ~5 minutes and no real skill. I don't know if you can get a non-Onstar installed vehicle as an individual consumer, the only time I've ever seen it is in fleet vehicles, which are all barebone models and/or bought in bulk. I'm not sure where you heard about the advertisements, I'm quite confused by that. Even XM, which is totally separate from Onstar, doesn't tailor ads based on location (on the stations that even do ads at all). AFAIK, the GPS aspect of Onstar is only for if you call them up and ask where you parked or to locate your car if it's stolen, both of which must be manually activated by either you through the Android/iOS app or by an Onstar agent when you call them. But like I said, if you're really that concerned about it, I've heard it is possible to remove the Onstar system relatively easily.  Hope this helps."
Chevy,3e31p4,boothroyd917,0,Tue Jul 21 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"I do appreciate the feedback. I had targeted adds from the once or twice before I got rid of the other. I've googled it and even seen OnStar reps talking about even calling in and canceling your account doesn't stop them from having control or even sending you ads. It was irritating.   Thank you again for the feedback though. I really don't want to have to get behind the new nav systems to see about removing the antenna, but that may be the only solution."
Chevy,3e31p4,boothroyd917,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, obviously it's your call, but maybe talk to your dealer about it? Like I said, I've never heard of Onstar doing that before, so I'm just as confused as you are, haha."
Chevy,3e31p4,HunterMajors,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:30 2015 UTC,My 14 sierra has no onstar.  So it's possible to get models without them.

Chevy,3e2hri,KaBoOM_444,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:30 2015 UTC,I meant H3's for highs and i think its H3 for highs. Thats just what I was told
Chevy,3e2hri,KaBoOM_444,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"ahhhh okay I misunderstood. Assuming you installed the balasts properly and your connections / grounds are good, have you checked the fuses?"
Chevy,3e2hri,Fluffyg3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:19 2015 UTC,Fuses are good and ballast theres only one way to install them I thought. grounds care great.
Chevy,3e0z4i,mango-roller,3,Tue Jul 21 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think that they're assuming that most customers would not pay the premium for the 6.2 and that those who would are shopping for a Yukon as opposed to a Suburban.   I think they're just trying to boost the ""luxurious"" and ""premium"" image of the GMC brand."
Chevy,3e0z4i,bignosebigmoney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:41 2015 UTC,This exactly.
Chevy,3e0z4i,sexandliquor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:03:57 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but if that were the case why not restrict the 6.2 to the Sierra only?"
Chevy,3e0z4i,bignosebigmoney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the 6.2 will definitely sell better in the Silverado/Sierra because people will want it for towing  purposes. While it isn't 100% fair to the vehicle, I think Chevy is marketing the Suburban/Yukon to soccer moms and they're hoping that a more powerful engine will promote a premium image of GMC amongst thst segment of the market. So yeah, it's illogical, but I think it's a marketing scheme more than anything else. My mom just bought a Yukon with the 6.2 and it was 100% because she liked the feeling of having more power, not for any utilitarian reason."
Chevy,3e0z4i,StaticMachine,0,Tue Jul 21 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"It's called a Escalade ESV, it's a $6000 option that gives your Suburban a 6.2 liter. It's the trim package above LTZ, lol!"

Chevy,3dussy,Absence-of-Faith,3,Sun Jul 19 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"Did you diag the switch? Or replace it on a whim? Pull the switch back out and check for good continuity when the switch is closed, and make sure there's no continuity when the switch is open (I'm assuming you have a meter, based on your other details). Basically, if you have good ground from the bulb socket, you follow it down at each component starting with the pos (+) terminal on the bulb socket and probe for power. If all of a sudden you have 12vDC, then check for a break in the wire between where you found power and where you didn't have power. That's about all I can tell you without looking at a diagram. Do you have DRL? That might change things. If you can hit me up with a diagram, I could tell you exactly what to probe for and where. Good luck though! Electrical problems are fun!"
Chevy,3dussy,GreasyAssMechanic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"No DLR. I replaced everything that in replaced just on hunches. The dash switch was the last thing I changed out and I only did that because when it was out of the dash and in the ""on"" position, I noticed it was very hot in my hand. So for $10 more, I changed it. I HAD a voltmeter, but it crapped out on me (cheap one from Harbor Freight, I'll get a better one later this week) but I'll check out the sockets and let you know. Thank you for the advice. It's over 100 degrees out right now so I'm done for the day."
Chevy,3dussy,GreasyAssMechanic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"haha 100 degrees where I am too, I feel you. Autozone usually has wiring diagrams on their site. You have to sign up for them, but if you know how to read one that would be infinitely easier."

Chevy,3df6vq,frixel,2,Sun Jul 19 05:46:54 2015 UTC,"I have a 2007 Torrent which is pretty much the same. It's getting up there in mileage but is still our day to day car (our other one is a Silverado which is impractical to use daily since both my wife and I work downtown). The only issue I ever had with it really has been the battery seems to drain easy. Like if I play the radio with the engine off while washing it I'll get the low voltage warning. Other than that nothing besides replacing the bulbs in the taillights a few times and the elevators for the hatch once. Great car we have taken it on huge road trips 3,000 km or more and has never let us down.  I find it to be more comfortable and roomier than the Sportage."
Chevy,3df6vq,Iguanosaurus,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:28 2015 UTC,Only experience i have with equinoxs is that they tow very easy. Small front end helped that. Last time they parked in my spot.
Chevy,3df6vq,hunterfg12,2,Wed Jul 15 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"I have purchased two for my wife, a 2010 and a 2013. She loves it for her daily commute (30 mi each way) a couple of small issues but nothing bad. It is a solid car, the hood is high enough a a deer doesn't fly over it and smash the window(experience). The one major issue is a GM one, we purchased a the navigation option and GM has orphaned that model of nav, so we can't even get map updates. We'll probably get the next model when it's out,  but definitely will never get another nav option from GM. Rides well for trips, a limo like rear seat, great cargo area, decent fuel economy for the 4, decent power even with 4 adults and luggage."
Chevy,3df6vq,BwanaPC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:01:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that! I've been looking at a few from '11 an '12 that have the navigation screen; they probably won't have updated maps, either right? Other than that, it's good for road trips an stuff like that, right?"
Chevy,3df6vq,BwanaPC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"Don't know about 11-12, just the 13 we got the end of 2012 doesn't have updates, otherwise the Equinox is built for road trips. My wife and I both like the comfort, firmness and features of the drivers seat, but my daughter thinks it's an uncomfortable seat to drive on."
Chevy,3df6vq,hobbestigertx,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"I have a 2011 Equinox 2LT with the 2.4L engine that I bought a few months ago. I looked at all the small/mid CUVs and it basically came down to choosing between the Tiguan, CX-5, and the Equinox. I ended up going with the Equinox mainly because it was the largest and roomiest in this segment, as well as giving the best bang for the buck. The Tiguan was my favorite of the bunch, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay that much for this type of car.  Anyway, the Equinox rides well, is very quiet, and gets fairly good gas mileage--I am averaging around 24mpg in mostly city driving. I have yet to get 30mpg on the highway though (it's rated at 22/32/26), but it makes for a great long distance cruiser.  The Eco button does improve gas mileage a bit at the expense of throttle response. I usually turn it off if I am heavy traffic, but otherwise I leave it on.  While I was not thrilled with the idea of getting a CUV, the car has grown on me quite a bit. I plan on keeping it for another two years or so before I move into something that I really want. I have had no issues other that replacing the original battery.  I would not buy a first generation Equinox. Buy a 2010 or newer."

Chevy,3df6vq,Abe504,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"I had one as a rental a while ago and the throttle response was not exactly good. That's probably because I had it in eco mode and was not driving it ecologically, though. Go test drive a few and see if you like them."

Chevy,3df6vq,dogedogeee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"as always the 2lt seems to be the best trim for the buck, if you can get a 2013 or newer for the mylink radio. The v6 you don't need unless you live in the hills, better get the 4 and better gas mileage, same with 2wd unless you are in a place with a winter.
