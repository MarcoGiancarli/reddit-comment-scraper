In the end, he was a better tactical fighter than strategist. Give him a battle and he could generally do pretty well - and a couple of times he managed to rescue the Afrika Korps from pretty dire circumstances - but his long term planning and strategy weren't where they needed to be for someone in his command position."

Your claim about the Wehrmacht is so fucking far off base I can't even begin to give a reply other than ""go read and educate yourself before you start propagating blatant lies.""  And the Luftwaffe divebombed Polish and Russian villages for shits and giggles--and even strafed ghettos for target practice. The Luftwaffe was responsible for the aerial bombardment of countless towns and villages with the express purpose of killing innocent civilians. What, for example, would you call the Luftwaffe's bombing of the Warsaw Ghetto, or even Warsaw's non-Jewish civilian population itself during the 1944 Uprising if not ""participation in the holocaust""? Not to mention that the head of the Luftwaffe was Herman Goering, Hitler's #2 and someone directly responsible for the Holocaust. And let's not forget that the Luftwaffe participated in inhumane human experimentation that have been deemed warcrimes.   Damn SS giving everyone a bad name.   The biggest fucking myth of WWII is that ""only the SS and the Nazi Party were bad guys!"" That's complete and utter bullshit. The German nation gave themselves a bad name--the German people as a whole avidly and proactively supported and participated in the conquest, rape, and destruction of Europe. That does not mean that the German people alive today are responsible for this--Germany has made remarkable efforts to atone for and distance itself from the past, and it is to be commended. But trying to paint WWII in some apologist light does a huge injustice to the millions who died because one nation gave in to it's dark side.  Obligatory /r/badhistory and /r/ShitWehraboosSay plug."

Surely someone is an ""asshole"" if they torture animals for fun, but is someone an ""asshole"" if they have zero moral issue with factory farming? What if they have a pet dog that they put on a leash every time they walk it even if it's not required, does that make them an ""asshole""? What if they wear leather belts? Is every single person who has ever put on a leather belt an ""asshole""?   I agree being against gay rights is pretty clearly bigoted, but animal rights is such a broad category that I seriously doubt there is anyone that is for every animal right (squishing ants is now a felony!) or against every animal right (having a bad day? break your neighbor's pet's legs!)."

Again making crazy comparisons. There's a biological imperative that shows being gay goes against the way we are built, are you saying there's one for interracial marriage as well? Because by drawing that comparison, which is a logical fallacy by the way, that's what you are insinuating.  Also the burden of proof is on them to prove that people are born gay, not the other way around. And why is that? Because we have thousands of years showing people aren't born gay, and when they are it's the same thing as someone who's predisposed to being depressed, or a serial killer. Do depressed people just get to say, hey I'm depressed, I don't have to go to work today? No. Do people predisposed to being killers get off when they've killed someone?  Now, I'm willing to have a discussion about this, Lord knows we're in need of one. All we get are people calling names and then other people acting like I've just killed their cat, that I must be a horrible person.

There is evidence to suggest being gay is productive to society by increasing the workforce without increasing the population or a help to build a support structure in case parents die there someone who has no children to raise theirs.   Because by drawing that comparison, which is a logical fallacy by the way, that's what you are insinuating.   Lol, what? How is that a logical fallacy, do you even know what that means?   Also the burden of proof is on them to prove that people are born gay, not the other way around.   What no there's not, I'm not entirely sure your not a troll. In cases where someone can or cannot exist it is the burden of proof to proof it does. However in this case the conditions are people are born gay or people become gay after their born, we don't have evidence to support either but we don't assume people become gay after birth for no reason.  Edit to your edit cause you added a lot of stuff:   Because we have thousands of years showing people aren't born gay, and when they are it's the same thing as someone who's predisposed to being depressed, or a serial killer. Do depressed people just get to say, hey I'm depressed, I don't have to go to work today? No. Do people predisposed to being killers get off when they've killed someone?   This is a logical fallacy in case you were wondering, what evidence is there that people aren't born gay from history, there's lot of gay people through out history, and lots of society that didn't condemn it.   Now, I'm willing to have a discussion about this, Lord knows we're in need of one. All we get are people calling names and then other people acting like I've just killed their cat, that I must be a horrible person. Our in-grown moral compasses, our biology, everything goes against being gay.    Maybe your in grown moral compasses does, but it's not societies, until the spread of Abraham religions lots of societies had no problem with gay relationships.   Now if we're talking about if they should be allowed to get married.. well let he without sin cast the first stone. I drink, eat in excess, I've had sex out of marriage..

Lol, you haven't said a single thing rooted in fact and have provided no statistics. I have had this argument a hundred times, and never has anyone provided a legitimate argument against either being gay or same sex marriage, judging from your previous comments you won't be the first.   Yes that is the argument, nurture vs nature. And until you prove it is nature it's purely nurture to the extent that I stated in my second paragraph. Why? Because it is unnatural to be gay in that being gay is two males or two females together. The biological imperative is to reproduce.   You lack some very basic knowledge of biology, nature has no intentions, being able to reproduce means nothing if you can't take off spring. But regardless, why is being unnatural(which is not, there is plenty of homosexual behavior in the animal kingdom) wrong? Why is it immoral?

So if I provided a logical fallacy, he's what you need to do, quote what I said then point to a definition of a logical fallacy(you can't just say logical fallacy, there's different kinds) and then we'll discuss your problems.  I'll give you an example: You said this:   And why is that? Because we have thousands of years showing people aren't born gay, and when they are it's the same thing as someone who's predisposed to being depressed, or a serial killer. Do depressed people just get to say, hey I'm depressed, I don't have to go to work today? No. Do people predisposed to being killers get off when they've killed someone?   This is a faulty comparison because being gay doesn't inhibit your abilitiy to work or cause harm to others.   Can you do something like that"
BlackPeopleTwitter,3e17g4,gohhygohhy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"See now you are trying to use my arguments against me. Except all I had to do was google gay marriage instability and I found these articles:  http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/cdozo18&div=59&id=&page=  http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/d_demo_diversity_1996.pdf  http://papers.ccpr.ucla.edu/papers/PWP-CCPR-2010-013/PWP-CCPR-2010-013.pdf  Social scientists have for decades been studying same-sex relationships and how these relationships are similar to (or different from) heterosexual relationships. Many researchers posit that it is social structures—such as legal marriage—that help to make relationships last. In a new study of the stability of same-sex versus heterosexual relationships, Charles Lau of the California Center for Population Research finds that same-sex cohabiters are far more likely to dissolve their relationships than are either heterosexual cohabiters or married couples. And while Lau speculates that a more positive social view of homosexuality and stronger social supports (such as the institutionalization of gay “marriage”) might strengthen such commitments, he also posits that “the elevated rate of dissolution [of same-sex couples]” might be “due to the types of people who enter same-sex unions.”  “compared to married couples, the dissolution rates for male and female same-sex cohabiters were seven and five times higher, respectively.”  Also when I was comparing depression and serial killers it was about the biology, not the economic effect.. which is obvious.   But go ahead, keep spinning your wheels trying to make this about me being an idiot.. You are doing a great job showing just how clueless all of you social justice warriors are."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3e17g4,rregular,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"Alright, in the interest of changing your mind I will briefly go over this comment then I'd like to start the conversation over by establishing where we disagree and then addressing each point because right now the argument is all over the place.  Firstly, your point about same sex marriages dissolving, it doesn't matter, why would we say, ""Hey, because you guys don't stay together as long as us you can't get married.""   Secondly, on the same point, two of your studies are from 1996, you need to bring studies at least made in the last decade.   I will readdress your studies and provide counters to them either later in this comment or later when address these points again.   Also when I was comparing depression and serial killers it was about the biology, not the economic effect.. which is obvious.    You were trying to make the appeal that being gay is a disorder which shouldn't be indulged in, it's not. Being gay, in homosexual relationships doesn't affect how happy or product you are and doesn't hurt anyone else like depression or being a serial killer, that's why it was a logical fallacy.  Now, on to a new conversation, I'm going to establish the arguments currently in question:   Being against gay rights does or doesn't make you a bigot. Being gay is or isn't unnatural. Being gay (or in a same sex relationship) is or isn't immoral. Same sex marriage is or isn't immoral Same sex partnerships are or are not stable for children.   Firstly, we need to talk about the context of morality, you've mentioned sin before so I assume you're a Christian. We're going to discuss civil same sex relationships in a secular society, biblical arguments hold no ground in that, let me know if you'd rather discuss them in a religious sense.  So addressing #1, so we already know you don't think interracial marriage and gay marriage are equal. Lets discuss that first. The difference in the controversies between interracial marriage and gay marriage is that one people couldn't marry others of different races and on people couldn't marry others of the same gender, but other than that the situation is the same. Gay marriage is opposed religiously, like interracial marriage was, interracial marriage and gay marriage were changed by the supreme court. The marriages of others don't affect anyone else because both parties are consenting. One other difference is that at the time interracial marriage had much lower approval than gay marriage.   So let me ask you is being against interracial marriage bigoted?  If so, how is being against gay marriage not?  On to #2, there is recorded and notable gay relations in the animal kingdom, and numerous societies in which gay people were accepted, what evidence is there that being gay is unnatural? Nature doesn't have an intention, evolution isn't just having an offspring, it's about making a functioning way of life and having gay people either improves that or doesn't affect it, like being left handed. Now you might say it's a disorder like being depressed or being a serial killer. Neither of those are unnatural, they aren't man made, they're part of the genetic make up. Being gay however has no negatives to it like disorders, which is why it isn't classified as one.  Number 3, what makes something immoral? There's a couple common answers, one is religious definitions, which we aren't counting. One is something is immoral if it doesn't harm to others, which being gay or having gay relations doesn't. One is anything that inhibits a productive society, which being gay doesn't. I can't think of a definition of immorality in which being gay would be classified as it.  Number 4, this is very similar to #3, in your other point that gay marriages fall apart quicker, which if we look at this study made in 2011 says that gay marriages divorce at around 1.1% a year where straight marriages divorce at around 2% a year: http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Marriage-Dissolution-FINAL.pdf  Even if there was a likelier chance of divorce for gay couples why would that matter? Does it make it immoral or wrong?  And the final point that kids don't do as well in gay partnerships has been proven wrong plenty of times: http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/gender-society/same-sex-marriage-children-well-being-research-roundup   We conclude that there is a clear consensus in the social science literature indicating that American children living within same-sex parent households fare just as well as those children residing within different-sex parent households over a wide array of well-being measures: academic performance, cognitive development, social development, psychological health, early sexual activity, and substance abuse.  Extensive data available from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social, psychological, and sexual health despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma. Many studies have demonstrated that children’s well-being is affected much more by their relationships with their parents, their parents’ sense of competence and security, and the presence of social and economic support for the family than by the gender or the sexual orientation of their parents. Lack of opportunity for same-gender couples to marry adds to families’ stress, which affects the health and welfare of all household members.   The 17-year-old daughters and sons of lesbian mothers were rated significantly higher in social, school/academic, and total competence and significantly lower in social problems, rule-breaking, aggressive, and externalizing problem behavior than their age-matched counterparts… Within the lesbian family sample, no Child Behavior Checklist differences were found among adolescent offspring who were conceived by known, as-yet-unknown, and permanently unknown donors or between offspring whose mothers were still together and offspring whose mothers had separated… Adolescents who have been reared in lesbian-mother families since birth demonstrate healthy psychological adjustment.    This from the American Psychological Association:   Lesbian and heterosexual women have not been found to differ markedly either in their overall mental health or in their approaches to child rearing. Research on gay fathers likewise suggests that they are likely to divide the work involved in child care relatively evenly and that they are happy with their couple relationships   Source. This article has a lot of useful information on the subject."

BlackPeopleTwitter,3dzimr,writhinginnoodles,126,Mon Jul 20 22:14:17 2015 UTC,A torturous debate left the Los Angeles City Council sharply divided by race Tuesday as members weighed whether to restore a settlement offered to a black firefighter whose dinner had been laced with dog food.    http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~hfairchi/News/Blacks/FirefighterLAT112906.htm
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dzimr,Bannedfromfun,73,Mon Jul 20 22:55:28 2015 UTC,"But other members said they had come to view it as a firehouse prank, especially after photos surfaced showing Pierce taking part in hazing rituals banned by a Fire Department that has repeatedly been accused in audits and other lawsuits of subjecting blacks to hostile conditions.   I'm not saying it wasn't racist, as you can see there's definitely some issue with the Fire Department there.  But have you ever worked with Fire? There's a LOT of pranking/hazing that goes on everywhere, helps some people to deal with the stress.   I guess the question is, does this thing only happen to the black employees? Should be interesting to see it in court. I can definitely see why the Mayor would prefer that to just an outright 2.7 million settlement.  Edit: Just to be clear, stress of the job can explain the hazing culture in first responders, but it doesn't excuse feeding someone dogfood or other shitty actions."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dzimr,christophicas,25,Tue Jul 21 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"With a decision expected today, all three black members — Bernard C. Parks, Jan Perry and Herb Wesson — said they would vote to override the veto because the white firefighters who doctored Pierce's spaghetti committed an act that could be viewed as racist   So wait, a criteria for something to qualify as a hate crime is simply that it could potentially be viewed as racist? No proof or evidence required that it was actually racially motivated, only that someone, somewhere could view it that way? That really opens the flood gates..."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dzimr,Bannedfromfun,8,Tue Jul 21 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"It's shitty, because it sounds like the Fire Department does have actual problems given the amount of reporting. And honestly, if it WAS a racial issue than it SHOULD go to court rather than be swept under the carpet with a bribe.  Which sucks for the dude involved, but the process is intentionally impersonal because that's the only way it works.  The whole thing where he took part in the hazing previously especially throws some doubt on the racial part. Like I said, is it just that the Firehall has a shitty hazing culture, or are they specifically targeting the dude because he's black?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dzimr,ohmanyouresosmart,11,Tue Jul 21 01:30:58 2015 UTC,I'm a firefighter in a heavily dominated  Caucasian department. I can tell you that we go out of the way to make it a safe place for our black employees. They never even get pranks done to them. It almost makes me uncomfortable that no one picks on them or pranks them!

BlackPeopleTwitter,3dzimr,Capetorial,130,Tue Jul 21 01:12:43 2015 UTC,"Because whenever I see a chance, I try to push people (gently so as to not provoke a defensive stance on their part) in a more wholesome direction. I try to break the confirmation bias that's so very prevalent there. It's just a little effort to fix errors in people. All you have to do is get someone to question their own worldview.  But I'm a skilled debater and I'm not emotionally invested in the outcomes of my interactions, which gives me an edge over most people whom would do what I do.  Also, it's scientifically interesting. Visit some time and you'll see they're obsessed with cuckoldery. They use it as an insult and a threat. They say if you date outside your race, you'll become a cuck. If you let your wife hang out with men of color, you'll become a cuck. This is obviously an inferiority complex manifesting but I never thought it'd be so prominent when observed closely.  Note: I never join in the circlejerk or reinforce their beliefs. I ensure that I don't have a cover to blow, so to speak. Dissenting views is allowed there."

At the same time she was like a typical father figure as well. We never expected her to do hard physical labour, but always out of her own accord she would do ""a mans job"".

Immediately reconsidered when I got the shirt and there was a giant fucking swastika on it because I ordered the alternate cover by mistake.

I mean, if you just think black dudes don't look as good as whites or asians or whatever.... whatever. cool I guess. but when you're like ""I don't date black guys."" You're saying that all black guys are the same. by that token, you're saying that all black people are the same.   except for you. that's some wildly racist shit. and not only are they 'all the same' but apparently they're terrible. so terrible that it makes you swing in the opposite direction. that's some cold shit."

I think when people negatively react to a certain immutable aspect of your identity, you may try to protect yourself by disassociating yourself from it.

BlackPeopleTwitter,3dyn7i,Omariamariaaa,8,Tue Jul 21 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"Very true and supported by science:   After 22 years, researchers found that the women who worked on rotating night shifts for more than five years were up to 11% more likely to have died early compared to those who never worked these shifts. In fact, those working for more than 15 years on rotating night shifts had a 38% higher risk of dying from heart disease than nurses who only worked during the day. Surprisingly, rotating night shifts were also linked to a 25% higher risk of dying from lung cancer and 33% greater risk of colon cancer death. The increased risk of lung cancer could be attributed to a higher rate of smoking among night shift workers, says Schernhammer.   source"

Then you get used to it and adjust and learn to turn your phone off because you don't need an alarm. Black out your windows with duct tape and blankets. Invest in a nice loud fan for white noise so you don't wake up to garbage trucks and people mowing grass. You learn that the world is amazing when everyone else is at work and you're not. Empty shopping centers, empty movie theatres, empty everything. Then you start to wonder why the hell these places are even open so early. No one's here why aren't business hours later?

Or you can get lied to and made to think they're at their ""best friend's house"" when really they're out somewhere raw dogging it.  Not AT ALL saying this is the best way to raise a teenager, I'm just saying i didn't come out messed up from it or anything. I wasn't a slut with a ""cool mom"". And i didn't end up pregnant lol.

BlackPeopleTwitter,3dyqol,Stunlock-,10,Mon Jul 20 22:06:36 2015 UTC,he just released a new album a few weeks ago. second highest critically acclaimed hip hop album of the year so far (behind Kendricks)
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dyqol,adam_jc,3,Mon Jul 20 22:59:37 2015 UTC,imo Summertime '06 wasn't that good. It felt like a Jhené Aiko album with a lot of Vince Staples features (and excellent production)
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dyqol,boastingtoaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:22:17 2015 UTC,the most impressive thing to me about Summertime was the vibe it gave off. most of it sounded eerie and it was like it sonically portrayed a feeling of paranoia and uneasiness to the listener. i think Vince tried to make the listening experience feel as if the listener was in his shoes on the streets
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dyqol,adam_jc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The eerie minimalism and paranoia of his life was pretty well done. But there was so much of it just so bland.  I think what Vince was trying to emulate with the album was verse 2 on 65 Hunnid. It was depressing, it was eerie, and it sounded great. Summertime '06 had that, and diluted it."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3dyqol,boastingtoaster,8,Tue Jul 21 09:00:47 2015 UTC,i cant believe people love the new kendrick that much.  It was good but there have been some really awesome releases this year that i listened to a lot more then Kendrick.

BlackPeopleTwitter,3e1e4i,kangaroooooo,2,Tue Jul 21 07:20:30 2015 UTC,It's a quick test you'd do after you read a book to see how well you understood the content. There was a minimum to how many you are supposed to take. But it was encouraged for you to read as many books as possible and take all the tests. That usually lead to some prizes and maybe even bragging rights.

BlackPeopleTwitter,3e1e4i,Madeforbegging,3,Tue Jul 21 07:42:52 2015 UTC,"AR or ""Accelerated Reader"" was/is a program used by schools to encourage children to read books. Not every book was available in the program, but quite a few were. Books were set at a specific reading level based on content, and each book had a different number of total points you could get.  I believe students had a specific number of points they had to reach, but they were sometimes given prizes for getting more than the minimum.  AR isn't the only program of it's kind. One that is gaining popularity now is called Lexile, but I believe the principle is the same."

BlackPeopleTwitter,3e0asc,andrews2547,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"Buffalo wing soda. They actually have a whole range of sodas including bacon, sweet corn, pumpkin pie, ranch dressing, peanut butter & jelly and coffee. Aerosol cheese and deepfried butter are still American food products. English food might be bland, but at least it's not weird."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3e0asc,zag83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"English food might be bland, but at least it's not weird.   Granted, but you're equating American food to very specific niche products that hardly anyone uses. American food staples are more like hamburgers, BBQ, fried chicken, deli sandwiches, steak, and Americanized versions of pizza, Mexican food and Chinese food which are vastly different from the original incarnations.   I'm sure I could find a lot of weird examples of English food like the spotted dick if I really wanted to. I don't think any neutral party would choose English cuisine over American cuisine."

Still says she's black, and the whole thing is a misunderstanding. Like what, she misunderstood who those two white people were who raised her? Maybe she thought they were just really, really nice. What's amazing is that she's spent so long fashioning her hair to make it look like a black person's, that's what she's doing for work now."
