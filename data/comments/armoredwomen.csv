armoredwomen,3baidq,runixzan,5,Sat Jun 27 09:54:19 2015 UTC,"I ran the image through Waifu2X, an image upscaling tool designed specifically for anime images. I doubled the resolution. Here's for all you wallpaper makers out there."
armoredwomen,3baidq,Levy_Wilson,7,Sat Jun 27 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"So, fun story, a little while ago I came across Waifu2x and, after some testing, knew it was the program I needed to get some wallpapers up to the size I want out of them (I occasionally find it useful for other images).  Trick is, I find the web interface a little tricky sometimes and it had no options for processing multiple files easily. I did a little digging and it was also a little unkind when it comes to preserving colour properly.  I tried to set it up myself in an Ubuntu VM (because apparantley Torch7 is nigh impossible to make run in Windows) and despite the fact that I managed to get my hand on the CUDNN software required for it, I don't have Nvidia hardware (which means I pretty much couldn't make it work anyway).  So I did the next best thing. I decided it would be as good a time as any to learn Python. I was able to write a script that will take any set of input images, pick the ones that are below the maximum size output of Waifu2x, resize (as needed) to be below the maximum input size, upload them, download the result, and run the product through an imagemagick command line (which I don't pretend to understand, but which seems to keep the colour data true).  I haven't actually published this script anywhere (except to show it off to a few friends) because I didn't want to end up causing some sort of traffic spike that takes down this free service.  But since you're doing the exact thing that I've considered doing around here myself (except not, because I'm a selectively lazy cunt), and perhaps just because you're the first person I've seen mention, I'd be willing to share the script with you if you're interested.  For the record, Waifu2x, though designed explicitly for anime/manga images, works pretty well on anything except actual photos (and, therefore, probably anything designed to be photorealistic). Most of the images I run through it are concept art or renders and, at most, the noise reduction can kick in where it's technically not supposed to (and occasionally interfere with textures, i.e. paint brush effects on digital paintings and the like).  That said, it relies on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically Nvidia's CUDNN (which they only hand out directly to people doing research work, though I've seen them give it to people who outright said they're looking to upscale manga rips), and it learns what it's trying to achieve through a library of high-quality PNG images, so you could potentially train it to operate on photorealistic images."
armoredwomen,3baidq,FoxtrotZero,2,Sat Jun 27 22:48:43 2015 UTC,This is fucking excellent. A few drawings away from professional I say :-)
armoredwomen,3baidq,Robocroakie,3,Sat Jun 27 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"This is a superb drawing! I really like the armour design, though I have a few questions about it (I realize that this isn't OP's own work, but y'all could always speculate on the answers).   The scale mail around the waist seems like it'd be intended to improve flexibility over a full-plate plackart. However, there's that bizarre-yet-aesthetic breastplate extension coming down over the sternum. That, in turn, seems like it'd completely negate all of the flexibility gained from having scale instead of plate, because she would no longer be able to bend over without stabbing herself. Does that sound right, or am I mistaking the function of that extension?"
armoredwomen,3baidq,YearOfTheMoose,3,Sun Jun 28 02:20:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe the extension is not rigid, and bends when she moves? Also the scale section would still improve her twisting and arching mobility, even if the extension were rigid. Probably the artist's reason for the scale section was to make the ensemble look more feminine."

armoredwomen,3b3av2,ErroneousBosch,64,Thu Jun 25 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"While the costumes are nice (if bland), they either don't really fit the characters or the complaints are based on utterly wrong information going by the blurbs.  Wonder Woman - Already wears armor when needed, and has bounced between several different designs for years, only some of them looking like a one piece. And yes, most of them keep the ""twins"" covered. In fact, her upcoming costume looks to be covering her fully. I'd hardly call her modern boots heels, either. Also, the costume idea here strips away the Amazonian influences some of her better costumes have had. She looks too bland now. And why the lasso? Don't they know she also carries a sword and shield?  Suoergirl - My first issue with the redesign is it ditches the red and blue scheme. While whoever wrote this thinks it's ""atrocious"", it's also an easy way to tell someone is Kryptonian. There have been deviations before, and it's generally agreed that they're horrible. So the writer has an issue letting a teenager going out of the house in the (not applicable any longer) ""cheap cheerleader costume"", but they think a teenager wearing a one piece bodysuit is better?  Elektra - Not too familiar with the character, but the wiki says she does in fact have powers. This costume also ditches any and all red, and she now looks like generic ninja #48335.   Black Canary - What is it with these stupid goggles lately? Regardless, this costume covers less than her most recent costume, which also ditches the half-jacket. Now I'm really not sure the writer keeps up with comics, or if they're just looking for things in older costumes to bitch about.  Ms. Marvel - Is now Captain Marvel and has been for a while, wears a full body costume, and is getting a movie. The current Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan) is a teenager who is mostly covered.   Vampirella - Is not, and never will be Buffy. They should have gone for a classy look instead of... this.  Red Sonja - Is not bad. Plain looking, but it's a start.  Power Girl - Really needs some official work done in the comics, I agree. However this Galatea (from the Justice League cartoon) take isn't the way to go. I'd say keep the white, ditch the boob window, draw her looking actually powerful looking and bulkier instead of ""boobs = power!"" strong, keep the cape and make it a more regal design. This artist seems to fall back on ""painted on bodysuit and add accessories"", which isn't really any better than current design philosophy.  Zatanna - Looks almost exactly like Nico Minoru from the Runaways. This person really doesn't seem to know the history of the character, as her father Giovanni Zatara wore a tuxedo - tophat included."
armoredwomen,3b3av2,tinkyXIII,18,Thu Jun 25 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"Woah now, let's back up on my Red Sonja.  First off, she's a barbarian, and most barbarians don't wear a whole lot because that's what they're comfortable in.

Pantaloons and cossack apparel, is not only an untapped goldmine for designs, but makes some sense to use it for Red Sonja. And it is much more original then generic adventurer armor."

armoredwomen,3b3av2,Zammin,18,Thu Jun 25 20:52:07 2015 UTC,"""The same costume 6 times and 2 other designs""  Elektra looks generic now. I like the idea, but execution is terrible. She's a former member of an ancient clan of assassins. Maybe give her some more old school ninja flavor.  Wonder woman is also dumb. She doesn't need body armor. I've said it forever. She needs a gladiator style skirt, knee high boots, an armored chest piece, and armored pauldrons. Basically she needs to dress like a spartan.  Power Girl probably doesn't need a featureless onesie like all her other interpretations, but she needs the cape. I don't have any real problems, but for a super powered kryptonian, she doesn't fucking need dumbass body armor  Ms Marvel doesn't need fucking body armor either. Her current Captain Marvel costume (hair notwithstanding) is fucking great and I'll fight anyone that disagrees. Kamala Khan also has a great costume. It looks like it was designed and made by a teenager, which is the fucking point. Dumbass body armor ruins that.  Red Sonja and Vampirella are okay I guess.  Supergirl needs to look like Superman. I'll give concessions on the skirt, but she needs the bright, popping colors.  I'll defend Zatanna's costume. She's supposed to look like a Vegas showgirl with a flair for showmanship. Besides, its different. It's not practical, but her powers don't rely on practicality.  This is a dumb article and it tried to pass off six of the same design for female characters, and gave them all the same problem.  I like that their idea for Black Canary is ""her old costume with a bunch of random shit added to it"". Keep it simple, stupid. If your whole idea is "" more lines"" then it's a bad idea. The best costumes are relatively simple. Easy to draw, not a lot of action on it. Makes action easier to follow, makes the artists job easier, and holds up better over time."

armoredwomen,3aordu,runixzan,0,Mon Jun 22 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"Palace guards come in two flavours. One is ceremonial, where instead of equipment they are dressed in flamboyant and good-looking attire with a lot of bright colours. The other is the on duty guard, who is equipped with useful and comfortable attire that allows them to operate while being constantly mobile. They are given either a side arm or a short spear/poleaxe. The drawn picture includes neither of these, its dumb looking weapons with combat armour whose design could not be more unpragmatic. Imagine trying to sit with those spiky plates or even putting them on. Having plate indoors is already not feasible and this design seems to have struck the goldilocks zone of uselessness, unpragmatismn and kitchness. Think about it, what is this armour trying to be? Good looking and ceremonial? Its heavy plate with combat tools strapped all around it, its ugly to say the least. Combat ready and for war? The first tool you have to have is a helmet, you can take many blows to your body but only one to the head is enough to kill you. Instead this thing has a some sort of useless ring with no structural support to protect the head or absorb damage. and dont even get me started on the stupid weapon or skin tight plate, this thing would hinder some one more than protecting them."

Also with bayonets fixed they are probably bracing for a charge. And they seem to be holding a berm. SO, in this case this could be a viable strategy. As they are on the defensive with cover so putting the most guns along the perimeter does kinda make sense."

armoredwomen,38dpx2,fyrenwater,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"In the cannon of my story that particular unit is the 6th ""Storm Guards"" Regiment of Foot. An elite, guards regiment that is sworn to never retreat or surrender. Ideally they should never really be in a fire fight, instead charging straight into the depths of the enemy with a bayonet fixed or acting as the corner stone of a last ditch defence or rear guard action.   95% of all other infantry units on the field do not wear armour as they are more reliant on the musket, as opposed to the bayonet. Since the armour cannot stop a slug it would only hinder them. There are a larger proportion of cavalry units that use armour when compared to napoleonic europe however. This is because the military tradition comes from a medieval history in which armour was very important to social status and effectiveness in combat.  For this reason almost all officers and prestigious military units use armour in some way or another."

Sticking tits on the main character doesn't actually change anything if the background characters have the same flaws as the original. Actually, considering Zelda is actually a fairly dynamic character in most of the games. This version of Link is actually worse than most of Zelda's iterations."

Feels more like it's a checkmark on someone's agenda rather than a natural evolution of the series. Contrived really from my perspective.

(The Dresden piece suggests a bit more with the ""sneak out"" comment but still.)  However just imagine gender swapping the roles of Link/Zelda back. That's a very common portrayal of female side characters and it's just as flat and uninteresting. I think that's why the Dresden piece framed Link as they did, because it stands out when a male character is in that role.  Maybe everyone on this subreddit knows this but this obviously had a wider audience."

armoredwomen,374bcy,5i1v3r,6,Mon May 25 06:26:39 2015 UTC,"Most popular leads of franchises tend to be blank slates. It lets players project onto them better. Gordon Freeman, Link, Corvo, Samus, Mario, etc., they all have zero personality so that players can fill in the blanks however they like. Background/secondary characters have depth to give the players a reason to care."

armoredwomen,374bcy,Adahn5,3,Mon May 25 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"The combat system posited here could make for very dynamic gameplay. Combined with Zelda's sheika training, each school of magic would make for a different style of play. Twilight magic would make for stealthy gameplay, Divine would be used to enhance existing combat abilities, and Arcane would be CC/environment control. Proper meshing between magic and actual combat would make for a very deep system.  This may not sound ground breaking (Bioshock has done something similar with Plasmids), but for the Zelda franchise, which has had samey gameplay for decades now, it would be a paradigm shift, and one I'd be interested in. The Wii U controller could make using the magic system very intuitive as well. This isn't the first time Zleda: Clockwork Empire has been posted, and each time, I really wish Nintendo would do something different with such a fantastic franchise."

armoredwomen,35pqti,lordsiva1,-16,Wed May 13 13:55:39 2015 UTC,"Mabye you should check it out a bit more. This is only one of a handful of times in which this sort of thing happens.  Where an SJW comes in and tell people to say no to one thing but yes to the other...   http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/35mtab/alternate_female_armor_expectations_say_no_to/  Rather than actual advocate of any sort of customisation in a fictional unverise as long as its practical. .dont reveal skin or unarmoured bits that can be armoured just like this armour. No crotch plate and alot of cloth.  Yet who am I talking to? Some one who frequents SRS and Gamer gazi both subs that are notorious for being shit shows that are extreme circle jerks.  Now lets take what spawned this.  http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/35jrm1/female_armor_expectations/  Most of the comments are not a shit show unlike the other. First it doesnt presume to tell people to say no to one or the other. It is just a concept of what they would like. Thus the comments talk about the practicalities of said armour. Which in a fiction universe based on material we dont know the properties of is purely hypothetical.  So what if force is directed to the sternum? mabye it was disigned that the sternum has a highly expensive material that can absorb more force thus it would be better to deflect shots to said area than risk fracturing the weaker sections.  Its also in my option that this isn't necessarily boob plate. In a medieval context? Yea. But in the future there may not be a need to bind breasts down and the space inside is either for shock gel or ornamental or whatever.  This doesnt accentuate the breasts as part of a full plate on the chest. Instead it seems to be light armour that is form fitting with a cloth attachment to other segments of armour. Think more separation of scale armour to increase movement. What I dont like is the open sides, though OP images have far more openings in far more vital locations."

Its plain to see by the top comments on a person history what their views are or whether your bullshitting.  /r/quityourbullshit has also lead me to this practice though not to the extent of actual reading all the history.  It is this that made me find it ironic that you can call any sub a shit show when you are active of SRS.

While this armour is reasonable it is still unrealistic in terms of protection with a crotch gap rather than a breast gap thus may push it to unreasonable.  Whereas the no to boob plates was exactly the opposite. Disregarding the validy of said armour (with in the case isnt exactly boob plate) and demanding no choice in the matter classic SJW.

As to whether this is reasonable space armour. How the hell would you know what would be reasonable in space combat? Especially in a fictional universe.  The groves, dips and no crotch plate makes this unpractical in a fire fight unless the cloth part is the actual armour.

armoredwomen,35pqti,Mech9k,15,Tue May 12 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"How is it not irrational hatred? Most of us were just saying that boob-plate is unrealistic and impractical and those criticisms were met with:   SJW's feel their answer is the only answer.   .   ""no one wants to hear that crap""  a thought that has never crossed a SJW's mind   .   I bet these same folks think it's ""sexual"" if they encounter a voluptuous woman IRL. SJW's are counter productive to themselves.   .   All hail our SJW tumblerettes.   .   ...Its a new era of SJW McCarthyism...   .   If you want my opinion this whole realism argument against boobplates is a strawman set up by SJW who know they'll be ridiculed if they come out and say "" it's demeaning to women !!! ""."
armoredwomen,35pqti,Dewbasaur,-1,Tue May 12 22:58:25 2015 UTC,None of these are irrational fears when directed at SJWs. They have provided their own history within SC forums and the wider world that all these sentiments hold true.  None of these comments are targeted at the people saying boob plate is unrealistic or impractical. Which for a matter of fact is illogical for many reasons. First and foremost being that in it takes place in a science fiction universe where the properties of the armour is unknown or the forces it has to deal with.  The boob plate in question cant technically be described as such as it is not full plate armour with the boobs accentuated. Rather is a light armour with shells of armour attached to a flexible cloth much like OP's picture. Unlike OP's picture it has only one fatal opening at the sides which are much less egarious than the multiple front facing opening in OP armour.  One of the main others being that the boobs would direct force to the sternum. Again how do you not think maybe this is a deliberate design issue or that the groves and bumps in OP's armour dont present the same problem on a wider scale? I covered more reasons why in another post here.  I'd also like to add that none of these replies were aimed at comments that said that boob plate was impractical or unrealistic. Rather they were aimed at the OP's armour and title which demanded we say no to boob plate yet in boob plate thread and this thread there general consensus was do what you want as long as there is a variety of both types. OR the comments especially the lower ones youve highlighted were lamenting the obvious push of SJW in SC and the wider world. Where instead of being sex positive it has now turned sex negative with witch hunts to boot.  None of this is also hate speech. Instead it is mocking a certain mentality that seems counter intuitive or hypocritical. Its not even vitriolic or name calling. Unless you consider SJW a slur. Again it is just criticism and if you cant take the heat...  Tl;DR Irational hatred would require no source upon which to base said critique rather there is a large and easily targetable base on which to lament upon.  As to armour I think ive explained enough to get the gist.

armoredwomen,35eo77,Anotherchallenger,13,Sat May 9 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"That's a nice picture. I like it when scenes aren't posing with weapons for the camera but a scene of its own right, the image being an invisible viewport into a world.  Looks like the female commander is getting ready to leave, putting her gauntlets on, having her sword handed to her by presumably her squire (who looks like a girl, but could be a boy, can't decide).  The guy behind her doesn't look too happy. Maybe she leaves into danger or maybe she leaves at an inopportune time, leaving him having to deal with some annoying business :P"

armoredwomen,35eo77,ToffeeKing,3,Sat May 9 20:11:35 2015 UTC,"Heh, thanks. I've started using his name as a nick online as a teenager, shortly after i've read Earthsea (more than a decade ago). I always thought him more interesting than Ged who was too restless and aambitious for my taste. But Ogion/Aihal was content and relaxed and becoming wise like him was my goal :) (That said i'd probably not let it rain completely unchecked over my stuff so i'm probably not quite there yet :D).

armoredwomen,35eo77,Aihal,3,Sun May 10 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, on all counts. While I do appreciate posed art, even the best of it pales in comparison to this type of picture. Rather than just ""this is a person and here is their picture,"" this tells a story. Any image that tells a story so well, so quickly, is fantastic.  I like your interpretation, and I hadn't actually thought of it that way. I think I saw more solemnity and ritual in the image than you did. I see it as a kind of solemn moment before a major event. She's armoring to do something that she doesn't want to do, and probably worked hard to prevent. The man behind her is a subordinate of some type, and he is as equally upset that she has to do whatever it is and he feels he let her down by failing to prevent it in his own right. The soldiers behind him are there in case things go completely wrong, and the situation dissolves even further.  Different stories from the same image. That is the mark of good art."
armoredwomen,35eo77,PariahSilver,3,Sun May 10 01:57:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Late in school i had a German classes teacher (i'm German and was in a german school so German classes were like English classes in an english school) who actually said to me once ""No, your interpretation [of this novel] is wrong! I've looked it up in the interpretation guide!"" (Some book with an example way of interpreting the novel), haha. I mean if i had made logical errors in my interpretation that'd be right of her to point out. But just flat out ""interpretation wrong"" because i had interpreted it differently than her… Needless to say it eroded any type of respect i might have had for that teacher."
armoredwomen,35eo77,Aihal,3,Sun May 10 05:17:13 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah that's awful, she certainly failed as a teacher in that respect. My favorite thing in the world is to hear people's different interpretations of my books, what things meant to them, and none of them are ever wrong because reading it was their experience.  All art, in any form, is entirely subjective opinion. :)"

Ridiculous(ly big) weapons are probably even more widespread a trope in fantasy than silly female armor. I don't think most people ever actually swung around (used as a tool) a sledgehammer for example so in a lot of fantasy art they make the weapon be as a big as a woman's torso. They also think two-handed swords should be huuuge and really heavy and hard to lift… and all those things. Oh well."

armoredwomen,34l77w,Osmodius,1 point,Sat May 2 11:37:48 2015 UTC,"It makes a bit more sense in context. This is art for a magic card that uses the ""megamorph"" mechanic.  Mechanically, this means you can play the card face-down, obscuring which card it actually is. Flavorfully, this is depicted by the person/creature being obscured by a swirling cloud of burning smoke that hides what's within.  When this creature is turned face-up (emerging from the smoke), it kills another creature, and becomes permanently stronger. Thus the name. That said, the art does emphasize the ""stronger"" part a bit more than the ""assassination"" part."
armoredwomen,34l77w,legendaryBuffoon,2,Sat May 2 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah I can see it.    I suppose an assassin on a battlefield would be much more focused on taking out an enemy, rather than what I was imagining (sneaking through a castle and silently killing the king or something)."

armoredwomen,33yrkc,LevTheRed,3,Mon Apr 27 10:07:59 2015 UTC,"Not defending boob-plates as armor, but they don't tend to matter for the 40k women who tend to have them. Armor for the major factions in the 40k universe is often unwieldy to the point of being impractical because protecting its user is generally its secondary purpose. Its primary purpose is to serve as a non-verbal message as to who the wearer is.  Rogue Traders and Inquisitors wear it to show off Imperial iconography and their opulent wealth. They're also generally incredibly vain and don't really care if their armor is effective because they don't generally fight. They pay others to do it for them.  Sisters of Battle wear it because their faction is incredibly gendered by its very nature. They are the Women at Arms of the Ecclesiarchy and the brides of the Emperor. Don't even get me started on the Sisters Repentia.  Guards(wo)men (even Chaos ones) tend to be more practical with their armor."
armoredwomen,33yrkc,Peggle20,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:45:20 2015 UTC,"Cracking your sternum when you fall on your face tends to be kinda important regardless of universe. Just because boob plate is a convention in a particular setting doesn't make it practical or realistic, however you spin it."
armoredwomen,33yrkc,LevTheRed,4,Mon Apr 27 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"The point I'm trying to make is that these people don't care about practicality. They're people who literally destroy whole, innocent planets to make a point to the one next door that has fewer people on it. Who think camouflage is cowardly and go into battle waving vexilla. Who spend time and money making bolt-action laser rifles when they already have automatic ones. Who will send thousands of soldiers into a meat grinder knowing most will die rather than flank it.  They aren't the kind of women who are normally on this sub - Brave, practical warriors who fight sensibly. They (and, to be fair, the men) are psychotic monsters living in a galaxy filled with psychotic monsters who wear special outfits so everyone knows exactly which kind of psychotic monster they are.  Except the Tau. This could be an man or woman and we wouldn't be able to tell without taking off their armor."

Their numbers were pitifully small, she realized. The crash had killed many, and five other dragons kept the rest of the horde occupied. Six of the beasts were enough to guarantee a moment of glory for every fighter who deserved one.  Her heavy blade—as long and as wide as her arm—bit deep into the dragon's flank, and she ducked as its wing lashed out in response to the pain. It tried to wheel around and face her, but a mighty swing from a towering orc's blade knocked its head back and sent a spray of sharp-smelling blood in its wake.  Alesha nodded, watching the orc, a soft heel who had yet to earn his war name, despite fighting in many battles. This was his moment, and she wanted to witness it.  A true warrior would have leaped into the opening his mighty blow had created, driving his sword into the creature's neck. An orc as strong as this one might even have been able to sever the head with a well-placed strike. There was the briefest pause as the others watched, anticipating the moment of glory."

With blood running down her back where the dragon's claws had raked her flesh, she pulled a spear from a dead man's back and plunged it into the beast's mouth, up into its brain. The spear shaft splintered, but the dragon died in an instant. She didn't remember if she had been afraid as the monstrous head lunged at her.  What she remembered was the panic that came after. Earning her war name had been her only goal. When the fight was over, she stood silently among the other young ones who were boasting of their accomplishments and the bold, grisly names they would choose. Headsmasher. Skullcleaver. Wingbreaker—Gedruk had been among them. Some of them, mostly orcs, boasted of their ancestors' deeds and spoke of their pride in adopting those ancestors' names. She had been so different—only sixteen, a boy in everyone's eyes but her own, about to choose and declare her name before the khan and all the Mardu.  The khan had walked among the warriors, hearing the tales of their glorious deeds. One by one, they declared their new war names, and each time, the khan shouted the names for all to hear. Each time, the horde shouted the name as one, shaking the earth.  Then the khan came to Alesha. She stood before him, snakes coiling in the pit of her stomach, and told how she had slain her first dragon. The khan nodded and asked her name.  ""Alesha,"" she said, as loudly as she could. Just Alesha, her grandmother's name.""  ""Alesha!"" the khan shouted, without a moment's pause.  And the whole gathered horde shouted ""Alesha!"" in reply. The warriors of the Mardu shouted her name.  In that moment, if anyone had told her that in three years' time she would be khan, she just might have dared to believe it.""

armoredwomen,328x69,PostOfficeBuddy,7,Sat Apr 11 18:28:20 2015 UTC,It's the second season.  Also the one in the front is a guy.
armoredwomen,328x69,thebrassthief,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:41:28 2015 UTC,Hah. That's quite an update for a game to go from sword/sorcery to modern guns.

armoredwomen,2yfq9u,Diceslice,4,Mon Mar 9 19:09:47 2015 UTC,The sword guard is a horned skull. But for a figure such as Joan of Arc one skull is one too many I think (unless you count the one in her head).
armoredwomen,2yfq9u,EpsilonRose,5,Mon Mar 9 19:16:33 2015 UTC,Her knee guards also look a bit like skulls or helmeted faces.

I thought that she was maybe some royalty on parade or something, but turns out it's an actress dressed as the real world female bushi Nakano Takeko, who, going by this photo, was easily the actress's equal in cuteness department.  Wikipedia:   Nakano, born in Edo, was the daughter of Nakano Heinai, an Aizu official. She was thoroughly trained in the martial and literary arts, and was adopted by her teacher Akaoka Daisuke.   Sadly, she was wounded by a bullet and beheaded on battlefield by her sister so that her head wouldn't be taken as trophy. Intense for an anime plot, but in real world what we have is that a beautiful woman got shot and had her head cut off by the person she loved most. Fuck old Japan."

armoredwomen,2y6s9r,TastyBrainMeats,26,Sat Mar 7 00:52:35 2015 UTC,"""No female Astartes"" was one of the silliest decisions GW has ever made.  Thankfully,  the SoB are badass in their own right.  They don't NEED fancy geneseeds to kick ass in the Emperor's name."
armoredwomen,2y6s9r,Nick_Furry,15,Sat Mar 7 02:15:50 2015 UTC,"Especially as all other gendered races and armies that I can remember have female warriors of equal skill and stats. (Guard (including PDF and Navy), Inquisition, Eldar (and DE), SoB (Obviously), Tau, Chaos all have examples of female soldiers). I quit 40k before the Imperial Knights were out, but I assume the pilots can be female too.  Its just a strange decision."

armoredwomen,2y6s9r,Genie_GM,9,Mon Mar 9 04:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Sisters of Battle are awesome.  I don't mind there being no female astartes. It works, just as there are no male Sisters of Battle. It would have been cool with more gender representation in the Guard though."
armoredwomen,2y6s9r,Guarder22,8,Sat Mar 7 03:42:19 2015 UTC,Though the 40k nerd in me cringes a bit at both female and soviet Space Marines.

armoredwomen,2y6s9r,Bananasonfire,5,Sat Mar 7 02:29:09 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that you needed to have the Black Carapace installed in order to receive the full benefits of power armour?
armoredwomen,2y6s9r,Guarder22,6,Sat Mar 7 07:10:27 2015 UTC,Black carapace increases reaction speed in power armor. Basically black carapace allows the user to move like they were in gym clothes without it you move like you are wearing heavy power armor.
armoredwomen,2y6s9r,ziberoo,6,Sat Mar 7 07:19:14 2015 UTC,"Necromunda features non-marines in power armor. It's not as good as the space marine's armor, but it doesn't require a black carapace."
armoredwomen,2y6s9r,Blekanly,4,Sat Mar 7 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"Space marine power armour is not the only power armour. The Black carapace is essentially an incredibly advanced information transfer between space marine power armor and the space marine's brain, allowing them unparalleled freedom within the armour.  Generally the point of power armour is to create a suit of armour that supports itself, rather than being supported by the person. This allows much heavier armour and increase in physical ability, particularly in lifting.  The dexterity of someone in power armour is limited by how sophisticated the control system is; shitty power armour limits even your range of motion and forces you into jerky motion. Space marines, on the other hand, feel like they're wearing nothing at all.nothing at all"

armoredwomen,2y6s9r,ziberoo,8,Sat Mar 7 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it more of a shame they are so much weaker than space marines; they could have made an all-female space marine chapter with the standard marine base stats but instead created some sort of imperial guard with boobplate, bolters and matching haircuts."
armoredwomen,2y6s9r,leXie_Concussion,7,Sat Mar 7 13:47:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, my main interaction with 40k has been through Dawn of War, and there, SoB seemed roughly on a par with other factions. I don't know how that translates into the tabletop game. I liked that they had a distinct feel to other Imperium (like having more flame weapons for cleansing and whatnot), though."
armoredwomen,2y6s9r,ceanji,3,Sat Mar 7 13:58:40 2015 UTC,In the tabletop they are as strong/tough as a imperial guard but as skilled as a space marine. They also have space marine equivelant armour and weapons.

armoredwomen,2y3nfc,evilplantosaveworld,2,Fri Mar 6 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"I figure they're meant to be waved about like a quarterstaff, except that doesn't work because a quarterstaff works by you being able to move your hands up and down the entire length and thus being able to change how you use it at a moments notice. A double-sword like that just has one grib in the middle, you can't grip it by the end for a better swing…  And then not only that but she holds two of them… wat."
armoredwomen,2y3nfc,Aihal,5,Fri Mar 6 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"She looks like a Thalmor. Not that that's a bad thing from a ""looks bad ass"" point of view, I just have an urge to jump her and her mage friend as they patrol the roads of Skyrim."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,thechiefmaster,63,Thu Mar 5 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the fact that Princess Peach is considered a character in need of this treatment.

armoredwomen,2y25ay,Milhouse_is_a_meme,16,Thu Mar 5 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as much as I like the concept, the ZS is precisely what it needs to be - a serviceable thing to wear when her armor is unusable."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,KallyWally,19,Fri Mar 6 01:54:19 2015 UTC,Also doesn't Iron Man have a pretty similar thing. A body tight suit that is covered in sensors that when he's wearing the full suit help him control it more precisely and be able to monitor his health.
armoredwomen,2y25ay,vincent118,15,Fri Mar 6 03:14:56 2015 UTC,"Is he ever even pictured in it? Like, as often as Samus is in the Zero Suit. It serves a purpose, but the game makes excuses to put her in it for unnecessary lengths of time."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Aspel,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:47:12 2015 UTC,Which game are you talking about exactly because she is usually put into it when her power suit is destroyed in some way.
armoredwomen,2y25ay,mrshadoninja,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:31:40 2015 UTC,Isn't there one where she's in the Zero Suit for most of it? For the Gameboy?
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Aspel,3,Sun Mar 8 22:36:47 2015 UTC,"Well she does spend a bit of time in it during Zero Mission, but that is because her power suit was lost when her ship was destroyed after being shot down by space pirates. If you have not played Zero Mission I would recommend playing it."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,mrshadoninja,5,Sun Mar 8 23:06:14 2015 UTC,But he's a guy so it's completely different
armoredwomen,2y25ay,M0b1us0ne,11,Fri Mar 6 05:17:03 2015 UTC,"No, it's different because he doesn't run around wearing it all the time."

armoredwomen,2y25ay,squishles,22,Fri Mar 6 07:04:48 2015 UTC,"The samus one kinda bothers me, that blue suit is what she wears under the armor. Why would you armor what is essentially what you wear under the armor you already have."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,LadyAlekto,8,Fri Mar 6 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, i adore this frost paint, i want this on my wall, in large o0  The 2 i have a problem is jean's(phoenix) and wanda's(scarlett witch) outfits.  These outfits arent practicable, i cant imagine them battling anyone with these dresses. Or devouring supernovas....  (one could add samus' ""too many pockets"" on this list as well)"
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Aspel,7,Fri Mar 6 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"I like some of them, hate some of them. Some of them look like good redesigns done by subpar artists or artists who made poor choices (the Chun Li one in particular looks like a well thought out but badly drawn one, why are her leg and arm moving together like that? Why is the shadow recoiling the opposite way of the swing?)  The Samus one, despite not fitting with what the Zero Suit is for, looks really good. Makes her look like a resistance soldier. I really love the Power Girl one. I think making her breasts smaller is a bit of a bad choice (a redesign should work with the original, she has big breasts, deal with it as a designer), but I love super heroes with jackets, and I like the sort of tight jumpsuit-with-padding look. I also really love the I/O symbol as a way to fill her hole. And I'm one of the people who actually thinks that this conversation is actually touching. Especially with that sleeveless top, it looks like a workout uniform with a bit of padding on the legs, and I like that look a lot more than the bathing suit most superheroes wear. Go fight crime in some yoga pants and a sports bra. Much more sensible than beach wear."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Zammin,15,Fri Mar 6 09:03:53 2015 UTC,"Very interesting and cool! What I like about pretty much all of the redesigns is that they all feel like they have a story behind them; as the character is put in view as a subject as opposed to an object, their new outfits are therefore part of their story and thus more fitting overall.  Heck, the Samus one almost seems like a full story in and of itself.  Again, really cool!"
armoredwomen,2y25ay,tinkyXIII,29,Thu Mar 5 21:27:51 2015 UTC,"That's funny, as the Samus design is the only one I take issue with. The Zero Suit is what she has on while inside her power armor, so it has to be skin tight on her. Even while piloting her ship, she wears the power armor, so the flight suit-style additions here aren't really necessary."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Zeero92,11,Thu Mar 5 22:35:23 2015 UTC,"I was thinking something similar. I still think that the design looked awesome, but it was far too bulky to be realistically (pft.) worn inside the power armour."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Andrasito,9,Thu Mar 5 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Most of them were interesting, very well though or drawn, but the Samus one just misses the whole point of the suit. Have they seen how is the regular Samus suit? You can't get much more armored than that without being a complete tank."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Zammin,7,Thu Mar 5 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the thing; I imagined that this version of the Zero Suit was more of a prototype combat suit; something she wears either before she actually gets the full power armor, or a suit she wears in the event that she can't wear the full power armor.  Thus, she'd wear much less under the actual power armor, but this Zero Suit would be combat ready.  And I got that from the fact that this version has little elements from the Power Suit, such as the shoulderpads and general helmet shape.  Like I said, these pictures seem to tell their own stories in addition to being a cosmetic change; I might be reading too much into it but I find it brilliant."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Monosentence,3,Fri Mar 6 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"I think their artistic iteration of ZS Samus and the reasonably skin tight ZS for use when she is without the full power armor are two different entities. Their version is if ZS Samus needed to gear up her only suit (ZS) with some extras for a certain amount of time, or as an AU (Alternate universe) version of herself where she never has the power armor for some reason."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Aspel,2,Fri Mar 6 02:41:13 2015 UTC,"It's a good redesign, but yeah, it's obviously from someone who doesn't know the character well enough (or someone who just wanted to focus on the Zero Suit).  I mean, I like it, though. It reminds me of Metal Gear Ac!d. Or at least 2, which is the one I played."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Jacks_Username,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:48:28 2015 UTC,I really like the hat they gave her. A little of a call back to the NASA Communication Carrier/Snoopy cap look.
armoredwomen,2y25ay,tbbbrr,10,Fri Mar 6 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"Really like these ideas. In most cases I still would prefer the originals, but that Scarlet Witch and Nariko drawings are actually better."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,SecretKarmaSerenade,13,Thu Mar 5 22:22:51 2015 UTC,"I dislike Scarlett Witch's original costume a lot, but I hate the gypsy gear more.  I like modern costumes for modern day heroes.  Something you can look good in without going full blown cosplay."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Monosentence,4,Thu Mar 5 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"Aye, some of the switches to another version were kind of silly. My favorite was probably Storm though, much more badass than the original.   The Heavenly Sword one irked me a little though. Both of them are great, but from what little I remember of the hour or so I played of HS, Nariko was from a tribe or some sort of specific set of people that dressed like that culturally. Their iteration of Nariko looks more like a westernized/European knight in essence."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,LeifEriksonisawesome,5,Fri Mar 6 02:44:08 2015 UTC,The Storm one was definitely on point.
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Aspel,2,Fri Mar 6 04:30:30 2015 UTC,"Nariko looks like a monk to me. Like, Player's Handbook style monk."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Raptor_Jetpack,11,Fri Mar 6 08:54:20 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, most of this are kinda shit. Like they just saw a picture and know nothing about the character. Peach wears a dress cause she's a princess and a political figure, not a fighter. While the Zero Suit is fucking stupid, adding a whole bunch of shit onto her would make it harder to get into a powered suit of armor. Samus should just be wearing pants and a t-shirt under her suit, no need for it to be skin tight cause there's no way a highly advanced awesome power suit is gonna be hampered by some slightly loose clothing.   A lot of the other ones don't change much, or make them even MORE revealing."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,alfonsoelsabio,7,Fri Mar 6 04:17:19 2015 UTC,I enjoy that some of the characters are still clearly sexy--but without being ridiculous.  Emma Frost for example.
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Aspel,3,Fri Mar 6 03:00:40 2015 UTC,I think Frost should have pants. But at the same time she honestly does seem the time to dress half naked and dare someone to call her on it.
armoredwomen,2y25ay,alfonsoelsabio,3,Fri Mar 6 08:55:08 2015 UTC,Exactly! What I like about it is that the characters who are still sexy and/or scantily clad are the ones who seem like they'd want to be.

armoredwomen,2y25ay,hinowisaybye,2,Tue Apr 14 19:29:27 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how to broach this subject, since I usually stay out of this argument, but here goes.  I find this thing kind of annoying. It implies that men are incapable of not objectifying a women if she's wearing skimpy clothing. I feel I'm more than capable enough of seeing a girl in barely-clothing, consciously being aware that I find her sexy, and consciously being aware that being sexy is not her only purpose in life. There are other things that the feminist bring up that I agree with. The seeming hatred against scantly clad women is not one of them."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,hinowisaybye,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:08:29 2015 UTC,"Feminists don't hate scantily clad women. What we hate is the use of objectification (i.e. scantily clad) to control, shame, harass and diminish people, most often women.   Feminists aren't afraid of female sexuality, and don't want to repress it. But we want want female sexuality to be in the hands of girls and women. When it's men designing the characters with such an emphasis on portraying her to be what men find sexy, that's fucked up."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,hinowisaybye,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:24:34 2015 UTC,It's fucked up for men to draw what they find sexy? Or it's fucked up for men to define what they find sexy?
armoredwomen,2y25ay,The-Atom,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"It's fucked up for the vast majority of girls and women's representation, portrayals, and otherwise female visibility to be based in male desire. It should be based on what makes girls and women who they are (as people), not what makes them sexy."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,jdmgto,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's wrong to make anybody feel like sex or sexuality is their purpose in life. Even if it's through portrayals of women in shows. But there seems to be an opinion that men defining what they find attractive in women, or portraying women as sexy is fundamentally wrong. This seems odd to me. Attraction has a biological purpose. It is meant to aid in the finding of a healthy mate. Most of what is attractive is from an instinctual stand point. Being globally universal in it's definition. The standards of heterosexual attraction are then subsequently defined by the opposite sex. I don't get to choose why I am or am not attractive to women. Women do not get to choose why they are or are not attractive to me. Even outside of heterosexuality this still holds true in a sense. The point is, nobody gets to choose what makes them sexy. That is defined by somebody else."
armoredwomen,2y25ay,Sarahmint,2,Wed Apr 22 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"The only one I semi-sorta disagree with is the Polaris one. Now, the redesign definitely works better as a character, but as a piece of artwork I like the original on the left."

But I was wrong.  Not only is that real, it's current. In Barbie's decades of existence, she's been an astronaut, president, McDonald's worker, seventeen shades of supermodel, working mom, fairy princess, swan princess, cop, etcetera... but she's never been a superhero. But, she's not just a superhero. Girls said they wish there were more super heroes, but they were split on whether princesses (who have all their power through monarchy and birth) were better than superheroes (who have all their power through birth, fate, science accidents, or money). Judging from this commercial, she goes to the 70s Superman school of powers, and has whatever is convenient. Also, much like 70s Superman, she ignores actual danger in favour of abusing her powers for mundane things.  Also, Ken is Lois Lane.  That said, Barbie has been a superhero before, but other than one person commenting on io9 and Barbie as Black Canary, the only hits I got for ""Barbie Superhero"" were this stupid thing."

She-Ra is introduced in the animated movie The Secret of the Sword as Force Captain Adora, a member of the Evil Horde that rules the planet Etheria. Princess Adora discovers that she is the long lost twin sister of Prince Adam of Eternia, having been kidnapped as a baby by the Horde's leader Hordak.

armoredwomen,2utmfu,therm0s_,5,Thu Feb 5 09:03:05 2015 UTC,Who needs chest armor when you have two shields?

armoredwomen,2ums1g,Exastiken,3,Tue Feb 3 15:01:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing fellow fan!

armoredwomen,2uglbu,kuracpicka,12,Mon Feb 2 00:10:08 2015 UTC,A user over in /r/ImaginaryWarriors said you guys might enjoy this picture.
armoredwomen,2uglbu,StrangeGibberish,5,Mon Feb 2 00:11:53 2015 UTC,And I think we do. :-)
armoredwomen,2uglbu,Thallassa,27,Mon Feb 2 15:24:20 2015 UTC,Still a woman though. And in armor :D
armoredwomen,2uglbu,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,26,Mon Feb 2 02:24:16 2015 UTC,That means she's a woman who knows what she's about.
armoredwomen,2uglbu,Darthnerdster,23,Mon Feb 2 03:26:34 2015 UTC,Transwomen are still women
armoredwomen,2uglbu,mightylcanis,1 point,Mon Feb 2 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"She's... Not trans. It's a case like Joan of Arc, or Mulan. Crossdressing and/or deceit != trans"
armoredwomen,2uglbu,UnspokenRealms,2,Mon Feb 2 07:20:51 2015 UTC,She's definitely trans. The Uncharted Realms story about her is very clear about that (as are Wizards employees).
armoredwomen,2uglbu,NicoleSpengler,20,Thu May 14 20:00:50 2015 UTC,Unfortunately?
