Agario,3e1xav,iamaquantumcomputer,4,Tue Jul 21 14:24:35 2015 UTC,"A bigger reason is teamers imo. On the EU servers there are teamers everywhere and you very rarely hit #1 without shooting at least one W at someone. On the Russian servers it's 1000x easier to get on the leaderboard because there are less players and less teamers. Also on mobile it's easy to hit 15k+ because there are a lot more new players and very very few teamers (because of the controls).   The reason teamers make it harder to get to 15k+ alone and shit is because they split inefficiently and then feed into their partner. But when you press W the receiver doesn't get 100% of the mass, they get like 80% so if you are 1k blob and split for a 50 mass blob it actually hurts you when you team."

Agario,3e2t2u,donwilson,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:22 2015 UTC,Likely a rounding error when the game is plotting each team's percentage. That's likely 97-99% when it should be 100%.

It's really annoying when you're certain that if you survive a certain cell trying to eat you, you can eat some smaller allies around that cell to eventually eat that bigger cell.

Agario,3e3oq7,Headphonaut,4,Tue Jul 21 18:39:30 2015 UTC,Probably easier to implement. Square corners also change the game in that you have to be careful of not getting encircled by a bigger blob against a corner without a way out.

Agario,3e448s,Puzii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"I believe that the mass total of each server is constant, keeping a constant area covered in either player blobs or eatable blobs. That might explain the massive spawning of food when giants are present and the famine while all blobs locks at 400. I've got no idea wether i'm right or not though, but that would prevent the game getting overly filled"
Agario,3e448s,DoktorBBQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"The pellet spawn rate is constant and even, but at some point the combined mass decay of all cells outweighs it, so there is an upper limit to how much mass can be there.   massive spawning of food when giants are present and the famine while all blobs locks at 400   It's just that the bigger a cell gets, the more restricted its movement becomes. The cell becomes slower and it can no longer reach areas of the map surrounded by viruses, which means that as bigger cells emerge there aren't as many cells to consume the pellets in those restricted areas. So, those areas have a surplus of food.  On the other hand, when the server is fresh and has a lot of small blobs, they can move with speed and ease wherever they please, so the pellets are consumed evenly all across the map."
Agario,3e3zmi,pjs2004,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:19 2015 UTC,You don't get XP for eating cells or getting mass. There was already a thread about this: How does the Exp system work for levels?!

Agario,3e19bh,Catfish3,2,Tue Jul 21 06:13:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. I think there would be enough teams. According to AGCNiby, AGC, VOZ, GS, VIP, Yin, poker and TW are all scrimming with each other in the Asian servers. That's 7 clans in Asia alone. If you read his post here ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Agario/comments/3cpbls/representative_of_asia_we_love_agario/ ) some clans have massive amounts of players - some have already split into multiple clans. I am hopeful that it's doable. Also in Asia are some national tags although not really clans (AUS and NZ), while INA (probably Indonesia) seem to be growing quite well.  Yes the language barrier is an issue. However I've learnt a lot about asian languages since playing agario ;)"

Most people express themselves by working to hurt others, so that they might become larger, even though it has nothing to do with achieving any win condition and is really just people finding joy in being jerks. Some even team up to hurt others, because they lack the skill to hurt other people as effectively without the help of other jerks.  This is human nature.

The Bait - a team player that specializes in luring or shooting viruses for a teammate.  The Fly - give him some w to make him go away... or not. Their strategy consists of, in team mode, to swarm around allies until it is painfully clear no w will be given. They're also those annoying pests that are just too small to splitkill. Do not feed, no matter what.  The Loki - skilled players that have grown bored, but have nothing else to do. To keep entertained, they will follow and taunt players who fail chase or do something stupid; w to help others succeed in eating -- only to virus them immediately after; or just shoot w in random directions or just suicide into a spawner.

The script's creator has made it so that's the default name, so people can identify them and just kill them."
Agario,3dypth,genito66666,5,Mon Jul 20 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"All that one really has to do is press esc and change the name, since the script only sets it to ""NotReallyABot"" on startup and doesn't make any checks afterward to confirm that it was set correctly.  Regarding ""12 year old asshats"" not being capable of altering the cell's default name in the script, it doesn't matter how old you are if you're naturally a problem solver - it's so basic that you'll figure it out once you realize that you already have an understanding of the problem and all of the tools needed to address it.    Anyway, the real issue here is that the bot (a 3rd-party program) has access to controls which vanilla players do not, giving solely its users an unfair advantage in-game; that is the definition of cheating, so it will be interesting to see the dev team's reaction.

Agario,3e09hp,johnmmxii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:30:04 2015 UTC,It will work on teams alright but what about someone who is virus feeding or in some split state due to any reason the person eating it would get a lot less mass then it would usually get plus say if the number one is in 4 pieces and i try to eat him/her i would get a significantly lower mass and might not even become number 1 after eating the current number 1
Agario,3e09hp,originalkiller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"Easy solution: make it give you 16 instances of eating a person and getting 100% of their mass before the diminishing returns kicks in.   Doing it that way would still discourage teaming ultimately even if they can team for a very short while, as team players would run out of their 16 ""free"" opportunity to share mass quickly. Meanwhile, other players likely wouldn't ever notice it affecting them at all, because most people don't eat mass from the same person over 16 times in a run.   ps the list should probably purge old entries after enough time. If I eat one player who split into 16 cells, play for 25 minutes and then run into the same player again, I should be able to eat them again without the anti-teaming mechanic in my way. The fine-tuning on that is something that would have to be play-tested to nail down, if Zeach were ever to actually do enact anything like this."
Agario,3e09hp,Afrobean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not a programmer, but I think keeping the list on the client side would be prone to all kind of attacks. Single players would try to take advantage of the list, let alone teamers.  Size of the list is really a matter of preference. 16 if you prefer exponential growth when you eat a split, smaller if you don't want that. I thought about keeping things easy on the server side, not something like 'count how many pieces have been eaten and after then decrease the point by x%' sort of logic. Hence a single array-list of N elements; not a complete linked-list of cells/pieces eaten by my cell.  A single list would be much easier to implement (I believe), and without the requirement of purging the list. If you eat 4 pieces of one cell and play 25 minutes without eating any other cell and come across the same cell again, well my friend, other forces must be in charge of your game play ;)  And as you say, it all comes down to whether Zeach would want to invest time and effort into preventing teams in the FFA mode."
Agario,3e09hp,Afrobean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:46 2015 UTC,"I thought about that, but wanted to keep the OP short. One solution is, as mentioned by Afrobean, to have a list of 16 elements.  But I'd still prefer a smaller list. When you eat a cell blasted by a virus, you grow exponentially. This gives very small chances to the other cell to defend itself and continue the game. It's all a matter of preference, really. In one extreme case, I moved to the top of the leaderboard in less than 15 seconds after I started the game, eating in succession two cells and a large split. If you want to have this chance, you'd go for the current state of growth. On the other hand I'm okay with not being able to become no 1 after eating the current no 1. Anything goes as long as it helps stopping teams."
