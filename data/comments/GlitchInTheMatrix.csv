At least as sciency as the X-Files was (i.e. fictional psuedoscience).  However, stick it out. The first season isn't great due to the actress playing the lead not quite finding her feet yet. Somewhere in the second season it all comes together into one of the best character dramas on TV ever, with the science stuff more as a plot device for them to interact brilliantly. And the actress becomes one of the finest workers in the industry too, playing multiple versions of herself, totally believably."

I don't understand, how could you show no signs of memory loss if you are describing very significant memory loss and confusion.  I can't try to give you a diagnosis but what I would suggest, if you didn't already, is to find a nearby academic medical center and go to that ER, and try to get an immediate appointment with an affiliated neurologist.  The reason for the urgency is that recovery can sometimes become less likely with greater time.  I also suggest getting checked by a psychiatrist, because of the close relation between neurology and psychiatry, and the change in cognition you are describing may be in their intersection."

GlitchInTheMatrix,3ckrwg,langejansen,0,Thu Jul 9 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"Here's what we know/think we know about the limbic brain:   In 1878, the French neurologist Paul Broca called attention to the fact that, on the medial surface of the mammalian brain, right underneath the cortex, there exits an area containing several nuclei of gray matter (neurons) which he denominated limbic lobe (from the Latin word ""limbus"" that implies the idea of circle, ring, surrounding, etc) since it forms a kind of border around the brain stem ( in another part of this text we shall write more about these nuclei).  The entirety of these structures, that, years later would receive the name of ""limbic system"", developed with the emergence of the inferior ( primitive) mammals. This system commands certain behaviors that are necessary for the survival of all mammals. It gives rise and modulates specific functions that allow the animal to distinguish between the agreeable and the disagreeable. Here specific affective functions are developed, such as the one that induces the females to nurse and protect their toddlers, or the one which induces these animals to develop ludic behaviors (playful moods). Emotions and feelings, like wrath, fright, passion, love, hate, joy and sadness, are mammalian inventions, originated in the limbic system. This system is also responsible for some aspects of personal identity and for important functions related to memory.   http://www.healing-arts.org/n-r-limbic.htm  I can see that unusual limbic activity might contribute to your symptoms. Someone posted earlier about being knocked out during an accident.  They lived an entire detailed life during that time, including courting, marrying, and having children. But in this time frame only a few seconds passed, and they woke up to a reality in which none of those events ever existed. Nevertheless, the person felt great mourning for the loss of his wife and children."

GlitchInTheMatrix,3ckrwg,5secondstozerotime,3,Thu Jul 9 06:22:10 2015 UTC,"I am going to jump in here and give you a hypothesis and give you a strong message get a second medical opinion NOW  Now I will explain why.  The facts are the you had a head injury.  The brain is a funny organ and we really don't understand how it works.  A massive head trauma where a big chunk of brain matter is destroyed can often not show any effect while a small lesion on a critical part of the brain can cause profound effects.  If you think of a house, think of the difference in effect between knocking out a wall between rooms (big) and a gas leak (small but deadly).  Here is what I think may have happened.  You have suffered memory loss. The injury did cause you to lose selective memories. But the mind always tries to compensate so when it realized memories were missing, it used a non-damaged part of the brain to create new memories, trying to repair the damage.  It might have taken images from your past, movies, fantasies and or just made them up to try and compensate for the missing memories.  The ""unusual limbic activity"" may in fact be exactly a side effect of that process.   You do need to follow this up.  As much as I love glitches, I love it more when people who are injured get better.  Edit to add:  You need to see someone who can do a full investigation and see if there are any other anomalies.  I remember in graduate school studying the case of a young man who suffered a head injury  There seemed to be no after effects until one day the psychiatrist saw him sitting out side the office.  He told the psychiatrist that he didn't know how to use a door knob.  But was more interesting, is that it never struck him as unusual that he didn't know.  Such are head injuries"

GlitchInTheMatrix,3ckrwg,BadAdviceBot,2,Thu Jul 9 05:57:22 2015 UTC,"update: okay guys it got even weirder. remember how i told you guys earlier that i am a lakers fan in my real life? i have a no. 17 j.lin jersey hanging on my chair in the desk near my bed in my room. just about 30 minutes ago i walked past my room through the hall and into the kitchen. i looked at my room and i saw the jersey there, hanging. i swear it was there! it was faded orange since it's one of my favorite to wear when the guys and me play ball. so i walked past my room, went into the kitchen to get a drink, and on my way back i passed my room again and into the living i room, i peeked inside and what the actual fuck, right there where the j.lin jersey was hanging earlier is a fucking t.mozgov #20 jersey! in faded dark red! i took a double take and the j.lin jersey was nowhere to be found! i swear, i feel like someone (or something?) is fucking with my mind and i'm seeing things that i know should be there, but are different now."

I met her at work an older wiser employee that took a liking to an eager young copy writer.  At first it was simple things: a smile that lingered a little,  a higher pitched laugh, the gleam of curiosity in her eye.  The conversations were always deeper, she let her guard down and I felt comfortable enough to tell her truths and quirks about me that I somehow couldn't tell my friends.  I had no fear of her.  She was different.  Older, wiser but warmer.  My friends tried to ""save"" me of course.  They introduced me to a few vapid,vain, stuck up girls all of the deluded or stupid enough to believe reality TV was real and they strived to live it. They told me she was just a replacement for my mother, who left when I was 8,  that she could make me happy, the age difference would kill our love.  My father only said ""whatever makes you happy"" as dry and empty as he could manage before disappearing into his work again.  So it was love and we loved as much as we could before her insecurities open a wound in our love a wound that would not heal, that killed the light in our lives.  As we grew older she became more and more demanding.  More and more jealous.  I felt trapped.  She had guilt ed me into pushing my friends away.  My father was as dry and distant as ever.  I had no one.  So I stayed.  She would pick me up from work, as she was now retired. She would demand to see my phone after every call.  The joy and warmth in her eyes was gone the comforting acceptance in her voice was a memory. I held onto for hope that one day I could again rest once I once again made some grand gesture to prove my love.  Maybe she would finally believe in my love.  But she could not I had a heart attack at 44.  My hair was gone. My blood pressure was high and still she was relentless.    There was no hope, nothing to save, the dream had died.  I had always feared leaving.  I thought I could make it alone.  But finally at 47 the misery was stoner than my fear.  So I left. Beaten batter ed but free.  3 years passed as I rebuilt my life.  I had my first apartment, a car in my name, a girlfriend.  Slowly I was growing up.  I would be whole after all it seemed.   Then one day I saw her.  At a crossroads fittingly enough. We both stared. Some part of me wanted an apology.  Some part wanted to apologize.  We stared at each other for what could have been hours neither able to move one. My heart was wrenching.  Sweat was forming some horrid pressure, guilt maybe?  Then from seemingly nowhere a car passed between us.  Like a tumbleweed  between gunfighters.  And the spell was broken both of us had to move on. Forward. Though I turned right to not cross her path."

It was night, 10-11pm and I was with 2 of my friends deep in the forest tripping hard for the last 3-4 hours, took 300ug was first time. We were without any lights around us we could only see the moon and it lightened paths that much so we could see walking, just dark and forest around us. We were sitting on a wooden bench chilling and trying to roll for the last 45 minutes, people will understand, it was an intensive trip. Finally we rolled just started smoking. I sent it to my friend on the left and seen he is sitting next to me... but when I looked between his legs where I would usually see a part of a bench, there wasn't anything, that thinking happend in a second. I asked him, hey what the fuck are you sitting on. He looked down, stood up said nothing but we all knew what is going on, we didn't have to say anything. A part of a bench where he was sitting was invisible. I touched the bench on the top where he was sitting and I could feel it, so I pushed my hand under the bench like I was going to touch my hands from above and under the bench and I couldn't because there was a solid surface between them (a bench) but I could see my hand which was under the bench through wooden bench from above. It wasn't only a glitch for me, but all three of us in the same time. Weird, right?"
GlitchInTheMatrix,3c0ken,Nzl,3,Fri Jul 3 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"I swear the weirdest shit happens when tripping and not just visually or mentally I mean things that multiple people experience together or things that physically happen.  What I am about to write was not a glitch, just a weird thing that had a legit explanation but just to help my point of ""weird shit happens"".  When I first took shrooms me and my mates went to a big old field with a wood on the edge. My mate ran into the woods to take a piss and then started shouting for us to come to him saying ""you gotta see this man,  you gotta!"" Curious, we ran to him (incase it was something living that would run away or something) and all of us saw the most defined witches face in the tree. After a while we all had a laugh about it, saying that there is no way that we were all setting the same hallucination. Then my mate pointed to his arm saying ""guys... It's angry!"" He was bleeding but nothing that looked too bad. We all laughed at him then my other mate stopped laughing really suddenly. His entire leg was covered in blood!  At this point we freak out and all leg it out of there only to realise that the bushes we ran through were all brambles. Being so transfixed in the trip we were having, none of us realised the brambles cutting us... Ye it was dumb.  We decided to go back to get a photo of the witch's face just to compare when we were sober... it was just a witch's face in a tree. No trip caused any of it and it was the strangest thing we saw the whole time!  I'll try dig up the photo of it in a sec  Edit: behold mother shroom  Edit 2: just to clarify, I wasnt saying that your experience was not a glitch."

It was always girls, usually somewhere between 7 and 10 or so and we were always doing different things.  In these dreams my wife was never there, it was just me and the girls.    Years later I had a child, and as I knew it would be she was a girl. She was everything I hoped for and more.  Not long after we had another, a girl again.   With two beautiful daughters I am now divorced from my wife (well, pending divorce) my girls are 5 and 6. They look like the memories I had of them but that is more likely my subconscious filling in the blanks.

Unfortunately I don't often recall my dreams so clearly like she is able to, so I wouldn't even know even if I had seen him in my dreams as well at some point.

GlitchInTheMatrix,3apwcn,Baccano2015,3,Tue Jun 23 17:43:44 2015 UTC,It was a couple years ago but I'm like 99% sure he went in.
GlitchInTheMatrix,3apwcn,BassBeerNBabes,6,Sun Jun 28 18:54:32 2015 UTC,An alien in a human guise. He unlocked the bathroom to be nice right before being teleported out.

GlitchInTheMatrix,3apwcn,Plopoholic,2,Mon Jun 22 16:04:20 2015 UTC,Did the briefcase guy look a bit like this?
GlitchInTheMatrix,3apwcn,gloomyzombi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"Whoa, a toilet on a train? That surprised me more than turdman. In Australia, no commuter trains have toilets. Only long distance trains like the Ghan have them."
GlitchInTheMatrix,3apwcn,gloomyzombi,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:53:09 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure what you mean by the door being loud and facing one way?
GlitchInTheMatrix,3apwcn,El_Dave,5,Mon Jun 22 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"Loud as in it makes a lot of noise when it's closed or opened. It's a sliding door, like how some closets are, and the plastic is quite loud when you slide it open.   Facing one way just means that the opening is only about one person wide, it doesn't wrap around a corner or anything like those sliding doors sometimes do. So the idea is that if he were to leave, even if he immediately went in the opposite direction we are standing, he would've been in direct eyeline of the people who were faced toward it. And then obviously since it was loud, we would have heard the door open. Especially the woman who was waiting to use it."
GlitchInTheMatrix,3apwcn,gloomyzombi,2,Mon Jun 22 16:31:31 2015 UTC,Oh okay thanks for the explanation. I think it may have been a G-man.
GlitchInTheMatrix,3am2gr,flow_mass,5,Sun Jun 21 15:40:21 2015 UTC,"I don't really have an explanation, however, I had a similar experience once. I had these diamond hair pins that I wore to my violin recitals, but I had lost one and could not find it for the life of me. I had a dream long after I had lost the one that it was under my box of cassette tapes. I decided to look there, not expecting anything, but it was there. It's a strange feeling, isn't it?"
GlitchInTheMatrix,3am2gr,impulsivedevelopment,5,Sun Jun 21 19:55:31 2015 UTC,My step mother had a dream that her parents house caught fire the day before it caught fire and I usually have dreams about an old friend I haven't talked to in a while and I'll either see them the next day or they'll contact me via Facebook or phone.  Weird!!!!!!
GlitchInTheMatrix,3am2gr,titan42z,2,Sun Jun 21 22:01:15 2015 UTC,I also have dreams that predict random things.

And this lady my mom knew somehow dropped off some old toys and there were some VHS tapes in there. One of them was Atlantis: The Lost Empire. I remember watching it more than once. And then, years later, my family and I saw it in theaters. I think about this quite a bit and try to make sense of it. It's so bizarre I've never said anything about it."
GlitchInTheMatrix,3aen1j,ikeepadreamjournal,10,Fri Jun 19 16:10:52 2015 UTC,Maybe it was the Japanese film Kimba the White Lion. It's very similar to The Lion King.

GlitchInTheMatrix,3aen1j,Nessasayswhat,2,Tue Jun 23 19:41:42 2015 UTC,Interesting! My entire life weird things have happened to me. When I was in the seventh grade my teacher let the class watch a news cast of when Kennedy was shot and I was completely devastated and felt like/knew it was not the first time I've seen that. I used to lucid dream all the time as a child as well.

She said she even remembered doing it when nobody was around, because she knew she shouldn't be able to do it.   I don't have any significant memories of it myself, except that I used to have super vivid dreams about being able to float almost every night as a kid. I still have them from time to time, and they're always very positive. I wake up feeling differently after having them. It really shocked me when she told me, because it stands out as a dream theme I always remember and hold dear."

GlitchInTheMatrix,3abumv,BubbleButtUngaBungas,11,Sun Jun 21 00:07:19 2015 UTC,Same here.  And not just stairs either.  Maybe bring younger makes small heights seem much bigger?
GlitchInTheMatrix,3abumv,itsm0ntag,12,Thu Jun 18 23:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yeh most likely this.   As a kid my mum used to take me into her work which was in the city. Near the bulding she worked in was what i thought a massive skyscraper with a huge koala statue on top.   Fast foward a decade, i revisit the place and the buliding is actually like 3 stories high and the koala is tiny."
GlitchInTheMatrix,3abumv,strikerJAG,5,Fri Jun 19 09:02:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, vividly. I wonder why this is a shared dream? I remember taking floating steps down the staircase, drifting down maybe four steps at a time. Never experienced it as an adult."

GlitchInTheMatrix,3abumv,peaches-in-heck,3,Fri Jun 19 10:47:52 2015 UTC,Madeleine L'Engle always maintained that she was able to do this as a child.
GlitchInTheMatrix,3abumv,terrybyte73,3,Thu Jun 18 21:12:19 2015 UTC,I've had this exact same memory. But no way could I easily jump all the way down the stairs now. I think it might be psychological because I now know how much falling down the stairs could hurt me.
GlitchInTheMatrix,3abumv,OnePoundFishMan,4,Fri Jun 26 12:21:55 2015 UTC,"This isn't a glitch in the matrix.  I did it all the time down carpeted stairs as a kid.  I'd hold onto the railing and let the bottoms of my feet (in socks) skim the tops of the steps, kinda like surfing down the stairs.  If I misjudged and applied too much or too little friction to a step, I'd start to either tip forward or my feet would start to go out from under me.  I could tighten my grip on the railing and stop myself from falling.  I was small enough so that stopping myself with the railing didn't require too much hand/arm strength, and it didn't pull the railing out of the wall.  It was easier to do down stairs that had a railing attached to a wall rather than a railing supported by bars coming up from the floor, because I could lean into the wall a little to control my speed and for lateral support if needed.  Fuck now I'm gonna try doing that again as soon as I find some carpeted stairs..."
GlitchInTheMatrix,3abumv,ribbitman,3,Tue Jun 23 20:01:03 2015 UTC,This what I also envisioned.  I used to be able to glide down the stairs also.  One day I was back at my mothers house as an adult and i looked down the stairs and can imagine ever being able to do that without getting hurt!

GlitchInTheMatrix,37963l,HumanistGeek,3,Tue Jun 2 01:18:47 2015 UTC,"At this point I don't think I can even prove that I didn't just take out the contents of the box and claim them missing. I opened the box in my car in front of the post office with no witnesses.   However, there was a camera in the parking lot and I did contact my local police department when the post office employees were basically refusing to help me. I was trying to tell them that I'd like to file a police report and prove that I didn't take anything out of the box but in the moment I was so flustered that I don't think I communicated effectively and the PD just told me to deal with it through the post office.   The box has been in my possession for over a week now. For all anyone knows I could have been the one who cut the bottom open and taped it back together."
GlitchInTheMatrix,37963l,HumanistGeek,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:55:48 2015 UTC,"I just think that theft within the USPS would interest someone. Why would your package be targeted? Was it randomly selected, or did a scan show the smartphone?"
GlitchInTheMatrix,37963l,TurnPunchKick,2,Tue Jun 2 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"I asked my sister if anyone at her post office had seen her insert the phone into the box before she shipped it but she said no one saw. My guess is that it was randomly selected.   I don't even know where exactly the phone was taken. It could have been the post office in my sister's town, in Goleta CA where the package was processed, or in my own town's post office.   I have a feeling it was in my own post office only based off of how unhelpful and completely unsympathetic they were. The supervisor even inspected the package and at one point he was looking at the bottom where the tape was taped over. I remember he noticed the line at the bottom of the box but he didn't say anything about it. At that time, I didn't think that line was suspicious either but I wasn't thinking clearly, I was so mentally unprepared.   I would love if something were done about this but at this point I can't prove jack shit."

GlitchInTheMatrix,375dp0,cheesemonkie03,3,Mon May 25 05:30:13 2015 UTC,They stole your phone and repackaged it so it wouldn't look opened. Then they reprinted your tracking number and put it on the box. This is why she should have put insurance on the package... Good luck OP.
GlitchInTheMatrix,375dp0,Ender070,3,Mon May 25 06:29:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think they repackaged it because the addresses written on the box are still in my sister's handwriting, at least,  I'm pretty sure it's her handwriting...  We're the kind of people who think that nothing bad usually happens to us so she did not put insurance on it. I never thought I'd ever have something like this happen to me."

You also might have subconsciously pieced together that your company was being bought out and the dream served to ""warn"" you of the ""danger"" ahead.  As for the woman let's just say your lonely or some shit about mommy issues or something idk.  If you do happen to meet a young lady with a familiar voice who you end up falling in love with, please let us know.  Maybe you did see the future.  It has happened before to people with similar stories as yours keep an open mind.  If you get the same symptoms don't fight it embrace it, poke around in your ""dream"" look for something concrete.

It should make no difference if I or anybody else believes your story to be true or not but I will say that I do believe this story. Without relying excessively on being too analytical or ""logical"" I simply find the tone of your account to ring true on an intuitive level.   Time might not be as rigid as we general think. Confined to the physical world it might appear unshakable but if you approach time from the perspective of a state of pure consciousness (sans your physical body), an individual might be able to experience time in a more fluid manner, maybe even in a non-local nature.  Thanks for sharing! Totally inspiring."

The coolest one was my friend (she's female, I'm female, we're both married to men) holding my hand when I really wanted to hold her hand. Try to explain that as random :)  Another one - I was worrying one morning about not existing, and my husband, when he FIRST woke up, came downstairs and first thing (without me saying a word), said, ""you exist"". He's skeptical about psi, but he had to agree that was pretty cool, too.  Another one - telling my cat, ""look at me if you understand what I'm saying"", and he does.  It's a thing.

The psychologist Edward B. Titchener in his book A Textbook of Psychology (1928), explained déjà vu as caused by a person having a brief glimpse of an object or situation, before the brain has completed ""constructing"" a full conscious perception of the experience. Such a ""partial perception"" then results in a false sense of familiarity.  Scientific approaches reject the explanation of déjà vu as ""precognition"" or ""prophecy"", but rather explain it as an anomaly of memory, which creates a distinct impression that an experience is ""being recalled"".   This explanation is supported by the fact that the sense of ""recollection"" at the time is strong in most cases, but that the circumstances of the ""previous"" experience (when, where, and how the earlier experience occurred) are uncertain or believed to be impossible.

If you set an alarm for about 3 hours after you go to bed, record yourself really subtly saying ""duuuuude you're asleeep"".    The tricky bit is keeping calm, and remaining asleep.  Once you get good at it, you can rehearse things, spawn anyone/thing you want.  I recently solved a software issue I was having while sleeping, woke up, and had the issue fixed almost instantly.

I wouldn't worry too much about it. It doesn't seem to be a harmful experience. Just an interesting phenomenon.  An example of one of my experiences was a dream where my cousins (identical triplets) were hiding behind a large door, splashing water, and then the door swings back and one of them gets bumped on the head. I thought I was a strange dream and thought nothing of it because dreams don't always make sense. About 2 weeks later, my mom are at the triplets' house with their mom and we are going to the children's hospital. Apparently they scheduled us all to get some vaccinations done on the same day. Well the triplets and I aren't too thrilled, but the waiting room has some awesome toys and stuff so we play hard and rough house. We become thirsty and discover a water fountain behind a propped open door. There is enough room for the 4 of us to fit back there and we all get a drink. Then instead of going back to play, one of the triplets starts splashing water onto us and before I know it, there is a little hidden splash war going on. Anyway, a nurse comes out of the doorway, leans on the door, which bumps one of the triplets in the head, and I start telling my mom I knew that was going to happen. And she said something to the effect of yeah, that's what happens when you rough-house behind a door in the waiting room, and didn't get that I knew the detail in which all that was going to happen. I tried to tell her I dreamed about it happening a couple weeks ago, but she just kind of just disregarded it."

However, this one mathematician wrote a book that stated that we can't be in a programmed universe bc irrational numbers exist, and they would be impossible to code.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2yprr0,till_apert,3,Fri May 15 00:39:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I didn't say that the brains of the intelligent life forms in the universe without any irrational numbers would be able to come up with the concept of irrational numbers. But if they did, it would not be difficult to make a computer program to represent them.  For example, I can create a computer program that performs on several 10,000-dimensional variables. This does not imply that our universe has 10,000 dimensions. I'm just saying computers can represent anything you want for them to represent. You can create your own concept called a gorglax number and represent it in a computer. A computer is pretty much all syntax, with no real regard for semantics. This is where my disclaimer enters, that a brain in such a universe might not be able to come up with the idea of irrational numbers, but if it did, it would also be able to program a computer to represent it, just as it programs a computer to represent the number 7 or the string 'hello' or anything else, since it all boils down to a string of symbols whose true physical meaning does not really relate to the actual idea being represented.  Unfortunately, our understanding as puny human beings in the vastness of the universe is so imperfect that I would suppose we ourselves cannot say perfectly which of the mathematical ideas we have developed so far are timeless and pure mathematical truths and which are folly to be burned down by the progression and propagation of new ideas, discoveries, lemmas, and proofs.  All that said, I have a final concept to pass on to you. I don't think a universe without irrational numbers has any chance of being even remotely similar to our universe. The existence of irrational numbers is bound up so tightly in the very universe-ness of our universe that without it, the universe becomes something so incomprehensible and vague that we do not have tools to discuss its nature of even guess what it might be like there. But I would still wager that, if they are able to create something recognizeable as a computer, and if they are willing to imagine irrational numbers, they will be able to represent them in a computer program, because it is simple to represent boats and stock exchanges and actual physical audio vibrations and a million other things much more variegated and surprisingly different from each other than irrational numbers are different from rational ones."

Foreign accent syndrome usually results from a stroke,  but can also develop from head trauma,  migraines  or developmental problems.  The condition was first reported in 1907,  and between 1941 and 2009 there were sixty-two recorded cases.   Its symptoms result from distorted articulatory planning and coordination processes and although popular news articles commonly attempt to identify the closest regional accent, speakers suffering from foreign accent syndrome acquire neither a specific foreign accent nor any additional fluency in a foreign language. Despite an unconfirmed news report in 2010 that a Croatian speaker has gained the ability to speak fluent German after emergence from a coma,  there has been no verified case where a patient's foreign language skills have improved after a brain injury. There have been a few reported cases of children and siblings picking up the new accent from someone with foreign accent syndrome.

Most of the time it breaks down quite quickly when I see something abnormal but the other week I had one where I was walking down a long road when realised I was dreaming. I kept walking trying to find something to do to make use of the lucid dream before it broke down. Then I realised that the edges of the streets looked time backdrops, like 2d cavases with buildings painted on them. I went up to one that was painted like a warehouse and the canvas slowly turned into a real building as though my brain had noticed that I realised it wasn't real. I went through a huge door and stood in awe as I watched the dream construct the inside of the warehouse. The walls seemed to grow out the ground and gain detail, the ceiling started out flat then bent into slanted corrugated iron. Then I looked at a beer can on the floor which was Green and had unreadable text in the carlsberg font looked away and looked back and it was then in symbols that slid round the can as it rolled along the ground. And that was when the dream broke down. I shouldn't have looked at the can! Was fascinating though; Watching my brain create things in front of me."

One time I was having a dream, and it was boring as fuck, I mean literally I was standing on a hill, surrounded by millions of other hills, with woods off in the distance. I actually realized my dream sucked during it, and decided ""hell, since I'm lucid dreaming, I think I'll go for a fly...""

I was the only one about and looked at the kitchen clock (analogue) and thought it had just broken so I checked me phone and that had also frozen, went to my room and so had my alarm clock. I didn't really think much of it, just thought it was a crazy coincidence so went back to the kitchen, carried on cooking then the clock on the wall started moving quickly as though catching up the time it missed. My phone did the same thing. Ran to my room but the alarm clock was back to normal time again. I was a bit freaked out and never mentioned it to anyone until now. Still no explanation for it.

The article says that the bible has no reference to the colour blue, but in reality it does. The Old Testament makes reference to a colour called ""techelet"", which translates to turquoise - a form of blue. In fact, the Talmud, the Babylonian Jewish commentary which was around the same time as the Romans makes reference to the Zohar, which was around during the time of the Greeks, which claims that blue is a bad colour to see in a dream. So clearly blue was a colour which was not only seen but recognised during those times. Furthermore, Moses' staff and the Tablets which contained the Ten Commandments were made of sapphire, and what colour is that? Blue. It is possible that the poet mentioned was colour blind, or lived mainland and didn't see the ocean and was too poor to see blue dye, or simply didn't like the colour blue.

Nothing too specific, but I felt confidence in knowing that no matter what happened next, I somewhere deep within me had experienced it before, perhaps in a dream. I honestly felt like a prophet of sorts.   Although I had this never ending flow of comfortability about my surroundings; time and space, I somehow just could not ""see"" where I was going after 18 years.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2w7bx3,crystallynntadaizy,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:45:11 2015 UTC,Whenever this happens I always do weird stuff to slightly change things. Once I had one that me and my boyfriend got into a fight about something so when I saw it happening I stopped and explained it to him. We ended up laughing instead of fighting so that was good but I haven't had one happen since then
GlitchInTheMatrix,2w7bx3,Arc_sephias,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"This happens to me as well fairly frequently, but it started about 6 years ago. As time went on, the déjà vu started getting super complex, and I'm to the point now where it lasts for a minute at a time. The amazing thing is though, that when I feel it start happening, I remember the whole dream and know exactly what is about to happen. However, I can't stop it from happening. For example, if I know during the lapse that I'm going to say something, I cannot stop myself from saying it, as if my mind forces me to. I'm not exactly scared because I have some crazy theories on the concept of time and how the mind controls it and I think it would be really cool to tap in to this ""power"" we have but can't control. Just thought I'd share."

Certain aspects of information is stored in slightly different ways and if ""tickled"" with the right stimulus (like a laser at the right angle), all aspects come forth to form an imagination that seems too complete to be stored in a brain at all.

I hadn't smoked any herb since the day before, and I'm a daily smoker so I know I was straight at the time. Our spot is a very small patch of woods on a beach overlooking a big Lake. Maybe 400 feet out from the road. In the last 50 foot stretch you have to climb over a fallen log. As we were doing that, we heard a roar of wind and snapping branches. Looked ahead and there was a 20 foot wingspan monster taking off. It's wings blew a big divot in the sand even. We both stood there frozen and watched it fly up and across the lake. Idk how nobody else saw or reported it. There were boats fishing and there's no chance they didn't see it.   Edit: I call it a pterodactyl because that's the closest thing I can think of. There wasn't a tail or I'd have called it a dragon. I didn't notice any feathers but it's entirely possible it had them. It had a distinct head too. Not quite as pointed as a pterodactyl but definitely not rounded like a bird. Also, I realize saying I was going for a smoke diminishes my credibility to some, but anyone who uses marijuana regularly knows it doesn't make shit like that happen 24 hours later. Or ever. Don't wanna omit that fact."

A few days age I ""lost"" the charger for my cell phone. I know exactly where I had it plugged in and used it a week before. Most likely I unplugged it, but what happened then...? I don't remember having it it put somewhere. It's not on the floor. Still haven't found it. Some years ago, I wanted to leave the house, tapped on my pocket... my keys where not there. Frantically searching the few rooms I remembered being in. My mother confirmed that I had not been anywhere else. No key to be found. Worlds like ""Magic"" were used. Finally I gave up and opened the door to the staircase leading upstairs to my room. They keys were lying on the windowsill of the window by the staircase. CURSES!!!   There were other things but in most cases it was relatively easy to believe that I put the item there and then never looked at the right spot for much too long time. Actually, this ""not looking at the right spot for too long"" may be the real glitch. I mean, once I look for something like keys, I first look at the most obvious places, then the less obvious ones, then the unlikely ones, then getting desperate and start over, hoping that I forgot an obvious place... and often the keys are at an obvious place, just the only one I never thought of looking at.  Is there any explanation for that effect?  @OP: if the ""vanishing point"" (<-literally) is just this one spot, you could set up a web cam observing it. I bet nothing will vanish anymore.

It could be because the font glyph cache has ran out of room, or there's simply a bug in the glyph rendering code.  Could even be a dev debug feature that's somehow turned on.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2r11eq,ftfstko,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:28:59 2015 UTC,"Ah ok then. Sorry!  It sounds very similar to what I was working on.  I was working on a slightly obscure and old version of webkit, which that app likely uses (if not a variant of) and was studying its glyph caching method.  'Glyphs' are individual font characters.  I could get this kind of thing to happen by filling the glyph cache up and then returning to a previous ""page"". This page would have references to a now old glyph cache page, which had been cleared/erased from memory, which meant the glyphs rendered oddly.  It might be completely different in this case, but my point is, it's likely just a software bug. :)  A side note: A glyph cache works by rendering all characters of the font, in their font size and style, into a big blob of memory. I could go and view this 'texture' to see how it looked and how well it had packed things together. Its purpose is so that the character 'a' is rendered once, and the app just has to refer to this region of the glyph cache whenever an 'a' shows up, in a webpage for example, saving video memory.  Edit: An example of what a glyph cache looks like: http://i.stack.imgur.com/e1Gal.png"

Anyway one lonely night where I was desperate enough for distraction to really spend way more time and effort than was reasonable trying to get any channel to show and show at all and I was cramping up and everything hurt holding my arms up twisting the wire this way and that and listening for any break in the sound of static, the sound of failure and desperation when suddenly I got the wire twisted in perfectly and got the sound of static to abruptly stop and I could only hear silence... I held everything as still as I could waiting to hear if I'd just killed the set or had just happened upon a quiet moment between bits of dialog of some perfectly tuned in show...

When him and his friends came out high they were lifters so they thought of something hilarious. They would take people's cars and literally move them all over the parking lot. This was about 10 strong israeli and Russian teenagers. It would help people sober up quicker and prevent as many people drunk driving and they would enjoy laughing at all the confused people.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2osq7h,xStahl,1 point,Sat Dec 13 18:47:41 2014 UTC,"It's a form of lucid dreaming. I've done this a couple of times. It happened when I was tired but not enough to fully fall asleep - but well on the way to being asleep.  I was lying in bed, staring at my phone. I was conscious enough to know what I was doing and control it. Looking at the phone the first time gave me a normal display of text. Looking away and then looking back the text degraded. Word breaks were roughly in the same place, but the letters had changed. I looked back and forth a few more times, and the text degraded more.  So somewhere in my head there's a model of a cellphone screen. That model is very accurate apart from the bits that change - and those switch up on a whim when you're dreaming because there's nothing to lock the model to a specific representation of text.  Oddly I don't remember ever seeing pictures on the cellphone screen in the dream - that's either because I spend most of my time on my phone surfing reddit, or because those pictures are treated like windows (literally, looking through into somewhere else), so my brain special-cases them  TL;DR: Some variation on lucid dreaming ftw."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2opfvn,Luxifer,17,Tue Dec 9 01:11:43 2014 UTC,"The solution is as odd one, but not inconceivable. You were watching videos, and began getting weary. You paused the video to get ready for bed, but as you prepared to shut everything down you passed out at your computer. During this time, you dreamed you finished the video, turned off your computer and went to bed as per normal. Why, you ask? Because you do it regularly and were getting ready to go to bed, so when you fell asleep you dreamed of doing it. Waking up between 6:20 and 7, you realized you have fallen asleep at your computer. Still half asleep, you quietly walked into the living room, thinking it was the middle of the night, and fell to sleep there. Having bizar dreams due to sleeping in an irregular place, you awoke to your sister. Being sleepy, you had not turned off your computer nor lights, and never changed out of your clothes. After all, you had dreamed you did all those things; it didn't occur to your half asleep self that you hadn't done them. You mom wouldn't have heard anything, your dad wouldn't have seen you when left for work, and your sister, seeing you asleep on the couch, awoke you at 7."

GlitchInTheMatrix,2opfvn,wes205,2,Wed Dec 10 12:17:00 2014 UTC,This seems like a solid explanation; might add that his dad getting ready/leaving at 6:20 is likely what caused him to wake up and head downstairs. (Especially if he thought it was still the middle of the night and woke up to a noise)

GlitchInTheMatrix,2omx6s,sparrow5,7,Mon Dec 8 14:05:15 2014 UTC,All good questions. The reason my work and house keys are not together with my car keys is I have two cars. One is an every day work car and the other is a 600hp import that I only drive occasionally. So I always need my work/house keys but I could be driving either car on a particular day. The door on my house locks automatically when you pull it shut. No need for the keys to lock it.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2oeh8d,laughingrrrl,5,Fri Dec 5 22:30:50 2014 UTC,There were no spots to put them in.  There were no empty spots or bell shaped spots.  My thought is the two chocolate bells were somehow laid on top of the top layer of chocolates?

These things happen when dealing with the dynamics of this quantum world on a grandular level.  They both did and did not take a chocolate out of the box.

I'm totally speculating though.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2muqmq,AmantisAsoko,3,Fri Nov 21 01:03:47 2014 UTC,"For a long time I've had recurring dreams where I'm in a nice neighborhood on a lake.  I also seem to always have dreams that I'm on a ship and I'm with a crew on a mission.  That's kind of the foundation for all the other weird things that happen.  I've lived on ships for years though so that makes sense.  But the neighborhood on a lake... I grew up near a lot of lakes so that kinda makes sense too.  Very interesting how seamless the setting is for all of your dreams though.  Next time you have a lucid dream, I would try to ask those people you're with if they are dreaming too.  Usually when I tell someone in a dream that they're just part of my imagination they get really pissed.  Maybe they can help you figure out what it means."

GlitchInTheMatrix,2mq0ky,donchaknoowww,9,Wed Nov 19 03:04:55 2014 UTC,They're called blood oranges for the vivid color of the flesh and juice. They usually look like regular oranges and usually have a raspberry-ish flavor. Here's the wiki on them. It has pics of a sliced blood orange so you can compare.
GlitchInTheMatrix,2mq0ky,Autumnsprings,0,Wed Nov 19 02:03:08 2014 UTC,"Blood orange:       The blood orange is a variety of orange (Citrus × sinensis) with crimson, almost-blood-colored flesh. The fruit is roughly the same size as an average orange, but sometimes can be smaller or larger; its skin is usually pitted, but can be smooth. The distinctive dark flesh color is due to the presence of anthocyanins, a family of antioxidant pigments common to many flowers and fruit, but uncommon in citrus fruits.  The flesh develops its characteristic maroon color when the fruit develops with low temperatures during the night.  Sometimes there is dark coloring on the exterior of the rind as well, depending on the variety of blood orange. The skin can be tougher and harder to peel than that of other oranges.

I was at a friends house who lived back in the woods. Because of the location we could drink a few beers without getting hassled. My friend Sara and her boyfriend were inside and I was sitting on the porch with her brother Tim who was drinking since that morning and obviously wasted. He was staring intently at his car sitting in the driving and in slurred words said ""I want to die"". I'm more of a happy drunk and just smiled and nudged him with my shoulder saying ""Oh come on Tim you don't mean that"" He looked at with with pure determination and said ""No i do. I want to get in that car right there, go as fast as i can go slam into a tree and die."" As soon as he said those words I felt cold and it was almost like i was daydreaming and i saw it happen. I was got freaked out and made him promise he wouldn't get into the car. At the moment i had such a strong conviction it would come true but I shook off the feeling. Soon I forgot about it. A week passed and I got a phone call that Tim and Sara's boyfriend got into a car accident. Sara and her man got in a fight. He stormed off and Tim followed. Tim wasn't driving though and had his seatbelt on that saved him. He was going 90 around a corner on a back mountain road and lost control. They slammed into a tree and Tim made it but his friend died on impact. I got shivers just remembering"

You can take your pick:   People have loads of thoughts and dreams all the time, so it's inevitable there will occasionally be some correspondence. 'Narrative coherence' - If you have a strong feeling of familiarity, it will often get 'filled in' with history by your mind. However, It is reasonably common to have dreams/thoughts which anticipate future events. The quickest 'explanation' is that time is all-at-once and you're always getting useful insights about other things out of nowhere - ""hey, I better get the oil checked on my car"" - so why not insights of a more advanced, extreme future-oriented nature?"

I think i had another one.'. Im almost sure i see it from a prior dream because almost every time it happens i am either looking at a familiar face or no face at all. (Since in dreams you cant create faces) And what do you mean by 'filled in by history'?

Now, make of that what you will - are the meds suppressing memories, or are they regulating a brain quirk? And so on.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2khws5,Autodidact420,1 point,Sun Nov 23 07:15:02 2014 UTC,"Frame of reference:       In physics, a frame of reference (or reference frame) may refer to a coordinate system used to represent and measure properties of objects, such as their position and orientation, at different moments of time. It may also refer to a set of axes used for such representation. In a weaker sense, a reference frame does not specify coordinates, but only defines the same 3-dimensional space for all moments of time such that the frame can distinguish objects at rest from those that are moving.  In Einsteinian relativity, reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes ""observational frame of reference"" (or ""observational reference frame""), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its origin. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the coordinate time, which does not correspond across different frames moving relatively each other.

But, yeah, it's all pointing to the same old idea: your current experience is basically a mind-dream, and that's why it has gaps - a big infinite space when you direct your attention to where your head should be - and odd properties - you can 'feel out' into space, which you wouldn't be able to do if it were really 'out there'.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,heresmyglitchbitch,6,Mon Sep 29 20:37:16 2014 UTC,"Your story reminds me of something that happened to a friend of mine many years ago. He was hiking alone on a forest trail many miles from civilization. There was no one around but himself. The trail he was spans a huge forested area.  Because the area is full of bears he was making a lot of noise to scare them off.   Being a classics geek who actually speaks Latin he decided to recite various passages from Latin authors, in Latin, as he walked along the path. I am sure that the bears were impressed with his Latin oration.  Suddenly a group of hikers coming the other way appeared on the trail. A woman in the group was wearing a t-shirt with a quote in Latin of the same passage that he had been saying out loud."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,Trieste02,1 point,Tue Sep 30 08:08:30 2014 UTC,Why do these things happen?!
GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,Trieste02,5,Tue Sep 30 23:31:32 2014 UTC,"Synchronicity is an amazing coordinating principle that organizes the universe a meaningful way, without there being a cause and effect relationship. In other words we can see the relationship between the two events, but we cannot see any link between them. For example, in the case I described there was obviously no connection between the man reciting latin in the middle of the forest and the woman wearing the T shirt with the same latin text, yet they are obviously connected. What is even more amazing is how many things had to fall in place in both of their lives for this chance encounter to happen. He had to study Latin in university, he had to like hiking and be pretentions enough to recite Latin to the bears, he had to be on that particular trail, at that particular time, and she had to also be on that articular trail, going the opposite way (or he would not have seen the text on the front), and have somewhere found a T shirt that had a long Latin quotation from a classical author. Perhaps she too spoke Latin, making the intersection of these two people even more significant yet random  So what causes it. Some have speculated that it points to the fact that our reality is not what it seems, that it is clearly influenced by our subconscious mind. Or it might be evidence of a trickster god that enjoys showing these subtle glimpses of his hand in your life.  I have experienced many synchronistic events myself, and they have always amazed me. Interestingly synchronicity is attracting some serious scientific study as it may be related to quantum entanglement."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,TriumphantGeorge,2,Tue Sep 30 23:43:10 2014 UTC,"Extra points for you, I think!  The universe is all one static shape, which we traverse as 'moments'. Synchronicities are a coinciding of two events; they are the same event, part of a single pattern, unfolding in your experience.  That, and there's something out there that loves messing with us, definitely."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,Trieste02,1 point,Fri Oct 3 10:08:12 2014 UTC,I have never heard it described this way. Very interesting. Thanks
GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,Solarslave,0,Fri Oct 3 13:24:47 2014 UTC,"So the events are merely aspects of the pattern that have always been there and our experiences are the result of our limited perception of that pattern?  Also, I don't think that space or this universe or that universe has any ending and therefore is shapeless. I also don't think it's static in the sense that the eternal state of positive and negative forces keeps the pattern in motion. It appears that even out of nothing or just the negative forces alone, something will emerge and that something is usually in motion."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sun Oct 5 00:37:01 2014 UTC,"The pattern/shape can be modified, as a whole. You only experience one moment from one perspective, but your intentions set a ""experience target"" that affects all time and space.   There is a momentum/motion to the patterns, but it's all result, no cause.  Hence synchronicities can seem retro-causal; all the events are actually seeded as one event/pattern by an intention."

GlitchInTheMatrix,2htlzf,Ixine,0,Wed Oct 1 06:52:10 2014 UTC,I also like what Jung had to say about Syncronicity possibly indicating an underlying pattern in nature.

So of course, I apologize for any mistakes and I'll try to go back and catch them before I post. I'm not really sure if this is a good place to share this. If it's not, I'll remove myself and my post to another sub.   Anyways, I'm ""attending"" online classes, University of Phoenix. Our classroom formatting got switched a few months ago. Before, students could submit an assignment just how you'd attach one to an email. After the switch, we now have to upload it, select the file, and then submit it and ""sign"" it.   A couple weeks in, I accidentally uploaded two assignments and apparently, forgot to finish the submission proceas. Sure, I could see how I may have accidentally done that. I was disappointed that I got no credit on the two, but hey, whatever.   Anyways, almost three months went by, I obsessively check and re check to be sure I submitted the week's assignments. Now, four weeks ago, I started a new class. The first week, one of my assignments had two copies of one required screenshot, and was missing another. I was confused, but I caught it before the assignment was due, and figured that hey, that was something I might not have noticed as well.   The next week (or rather, after the next week's assignments had been graded), I see the teachers comment on one, explaining the assignment all over again, and I've got a score of zero...The fuck?.. I go look to see what I had submitted, and it's a copy of one of the first week's assignments. What the hell? I checked that shut. Know I did. Whatever. I turned it in and lose a couple points for lateness.   The next week, I make double, triple fucking sure I've got the right assignments in. Yep. I'm good, those are the correct assignments. Gave the files REALLY specific names so I could really be damn sure. A couple days late, I check my grades. Again, one assignment from the teacher had a complete explanation of what I was supposed to do. Check my file, and is a copy of the other assignment I turned in that week. I don't even know. I've either gone nuts or been hacked. I changed my password, again, after submitting the assignments this week. I took screenshot of the page showing the file submitted just in case. I have certain accounts with simple passwords, but for my school account is a damn complicated and nonsensical series of letters and numbers, that nobody else has ever been given, and that is also not written, or saved, anywhere. It's just only in my head.   The worst part is the teacher who's treating me like an idiot, though I suppose I might be one. Edit: Fixed a spelling mistake.  Edit: FTFY"

GlitchInTheMatrix,2f9nv0,milchu,29,Tue Sep 2 15:58:49 2014 UTC,"For those who wanted to read with some formatting:  Necessary details to start with? I guess one would be that English isn't my first language, as I am from India so I might have difficulty in expressing myself during some circumstances. It's not that important, just that anyone who is Indian has a vague idea of how the telephone network lines work here. The last but not the least, I have a very uncommon name for an Indian guy, you would need this info as I’ve changed my name in the story for the sake of it.   We got our first land-line phone installed in the late '90s (most probably 1998, I honestly do not remember..sorry!). The number was 4519484(number changed for the better, no point looking it up). If you were to call it up from an outer state, the prefix 016-(changed) is to be added. I was a kid at that time and we were really happy since not all the households in our neighborhood had a phone at that time. It was pretty cool, we were proud of it. I have two elder sisters who were in school at that time, the eldest being 9yrs. elder to me (Indian families, no big deal, don't ask). My name comes from combining the initial letters of the names of my two sisters, hence, the unusualness.   Anyway, we had a dog that died in the year 2007. My old champ, a Spitz who lived his life to the fullest.   The phone had been disconnected in the mid-2000s since every family member of ours had a mobile phone (Yes, including me, a kid). A year or two before it got disconnected, due to some new government regulations or amendment I honestly don't remember, the first digit of every phone number in our state was changed from 4 to 2. So, like all land-lines, ours became from 4519484 to 2519484.   Now, here I must mention a weird habit I had of dialing my own land-line number from the land-line itself(hence, getting a busy tone...yeah, I had too much time to kill). When I got my first cellphone, the habit didn't go away, in fact, in my free time, I used to dial both the numbers(4519484 as well as 2519484) always ending up getting the message that the numbers are invalid. I really missed those days (I used to prank call a lot since we didn't have a Caller-ID then, also it was the only way of talking to my friends outside of school so I had a lot of fun memories with it).   Today, 2014, I'm a grown ass person with a smartphone working in a nationalised bank (No name given..duh) and my habit had faded with time, almost diminished but... a few months ago, I had been sitting idle in my office with no customers to cater to (it was really hot outside so no one came). What do I do, I pick up the bank's phone, randomly with no idea of what to do next, my subconscious mind makes my fingers dial the old land-line i.e.4519484. Now, I should specify the message that actually used to be delivered while dialing this number after the initial digit was changed, the message used to be ""SORRY, YOU SEEMED TO HAVE DIALED A WRONG NUMBER, PLEASE CHECK THE DIGITS FOR CONFIRMATION"".   Moving on, I dialed my own old land-line and surprisingly, the bell goes.   My heart skips a beat, I don't know what to do, the first thought was that a new series of land-lines must have been started using the old numbers that have long been disconnected. Curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to know who picks up, afterall, if anything goes wrong I can always pretend that I'm from the Bank and probably dialed a wrong number while trying to get to some other person. ""Hello!"", says the voice on the other end. The moment I heard the voice, all the memories of my childhood, everything I had left behind to become the person I am today, came in a sudden flash-back.   My whole world shook.   Why? because the voice, I don't know if I sound insane, please believe me, the voice was of my mother. But not her voice as it was towards her later age before her death, but the way it was at the time our house got its first phone. She sounded young, pleasant, busy as if she was doing some household chore and I disturbed her. ""Hello"", she said again, my throat choked, tears welled up.   I don’t know what to do. What the hell was wrong with me, it could have easily been another woman with a similar voice, right? NO. It was HER voice, I knew it. Deep inside my heart, I knew I had tapped something way out of my reach as a sentient being(sorry for the word, nothing better in my mind). It was almost like all my life I had that extra-ordinary habit, for this particular day. Someone/something far bigger than us was toying with me. What else made tears come out was the bark I heard behind her voice. My old champ, happy and alive, young and energetic. I could recognize his panting from any other dog, let alone his bark. He always barked when the phone rang.  “Hello? Who is it?”, she said, practically shouting. “Maa”, all I could say, before the first loud sob came, followed by a stuttered breathing!? If that’s what you call it. The lady paused for a moment, probably wondering what the hell was happening,”Son I think you dialled a wrong number”. That was it, I couldn’t take it anymore, I cried like a baby. It WAS her, my god, the voice, the tone, the love. I’m still crying and I always do when I remember her. My mother was the closest person I ever had, the pains she took to make me study, the money problems we had since my dad had a lot of issues, she had been the breadwinner for the house for the most of our lives, that is, until the day she got sick and no one could save her.   “It’s me Rohit, Maa…I love you”, I muttered while weeping. “Rohit?...Where is he? What happened to him? Who the hell are you?”, she shouted. That is when a fear took over me, fear of the unknown I guess. ‘This shouldn’t be happening’ kind of fear. Or ‘this is some goddamn devil work playing with your fucking mind, probably to drive you insane’ kind of fear. Or as I’ve seen what they call it here, the ‘nope! Nope! Nope!’ kind of fear. I slammed the phone down. I was shaking way too much to even stand up, I was almost pulling my hair, all the while crying. My colleagues were all over me, asking the exact question I couldn’t answer, “What the hell happened?”   Turns out I passed out, I woke up in one of my customer’s clinic. Feeling everything as if it was a dream. My blood pressure had gone low enough to kill me in my unconscious state, but thankfully, it didn’t. What happened afterwards? Nothing, I never tried the number, too afraid. Even though I almost know I’d get the wrong number message back again, I know the phone wouldn’t be picked ever again by anyone. My instincts tell me it was a one time glitch in God’s timeframe that I had come across. In any case, I do not wish to take the risk.   I just wanted to get this out of my system, thank you all for reading.   TLDR: I phoned in the past... like IN the PAST"

It was about 10 years ago in my old house. We had a land line at the time, with caller id. It was early Saturday morning and I was getting ready for work.  My husband had the day off and was just sitting around on the computer while I was preparing to leave when our phone rang. The caller ID said it was an unavailable number.  Now, normally we never answered these calls because they were usually solicitors and what not, but for some reason my husband felt compelled to answer it. I remember clear as day seeing his face when he said ""Hello?"". He went completely white and said ""Hello?"" again. He hung up the phone and just stood there looking like he had seen a ghost. I asked him who it was. He said it was his mom. The line was pretty static, and all he heard was her saying hello once. Then the line went dead.   She had passed away the previous year, and he never really talked much about her. He was very close to her and I think he held a lot in when she passed. He is not one for emotions. He also never believed in spiritual things or ghosts of any kind. He also is not into practical jokes or pranks of any kind. This was the real deal. I have never seen him so shaken up or visibly disturbed by something like this. He started crying and was adamant that his deceased mother had just called him and said hello from beyond.  To this day I still get goosebumps when I think of this incident.  Your story reminded me of this and I just thought I would share this with you. Not many people can believe these things unless they experience them personally.   I take comfort in knowing that there could possibly be more than just what a person may see or hear in this life and definitely believe in super natural happenings.    Thank you for sharing your story. And know you are not alone. I believe your mom is watching over you and this happened for a reason.  Even though it was scary,  I would take comfort in the universe connecting you one last time with someone who was near and dear to you."

For instance, if the back of the frame was not normal and looked like a single piece, one of you may have mistaken them as a wooden board or something? Also, were they just stacked? or displayed outward at all? Lastly, you seem like you were pretty upset about this, how would you describe your wife's ""devotion"" to the cause of finding them?  While you were constantly ""looking"" for them when packing and unpacking, she very easily could have let her guard down and mistook them for something else."

My wife is also a graduate of this school, and feels the same way about her diploma as I do about mine.

We'd gotten to our basement and we were going through some things that had literally been tossed in there when we moved and not gone through since. Found a jewelry box of mine I hadn't seen in years and that I had thought was missing. I opened it up to see if any treasures from my childhood were inside. It was a box with a little picture frame type thing on top. I saw something behind the picture that was in there and pulled it out out of curiousity, thinking it was another old photgraph. It was my card.  No clue, dude. No clue."

GlitchInTheMatrix,2dtkt1,Phat_Guy,7,Sun Aug 17 19:31:05 2014 UTC,"Humans have an internal body clock. I don't think we can consciously know what time it is, but after about an hour is spent on an activity, we do know approximately that an hour should have passed, although not to the minute. With some practice, it is possible to wake up at the same hour everyday - to the minute.  So, you might have had that going on for you - your dream was a window into your subconscious - telling the time for you.  Or it might have been a simple case of placing the image after you wake up. You have seen the clock in the dream, and there was a gap in your memory as to what it said, so when you look at the clock after you wake up you expect to see two minutes less than your clock. Your brain automatically fills the gap, making it seem as if your dream occurred that way."

At the same time I am dreaming and mixing what I see in my room with what's in my head.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2dtkt1,Toxicitor,1 point,Fri Sep 5 13:14:08 2014 UTC,"The Nightmare:       The Nightmare is a 1781 oil painting by Anglo- Swiss artist Henry Fuseli (1741–1825). Since its creation, it has remained Fuseli's best-known work. With its first exhibition in 1782 at the Royal Academy of London, the image became famous; an engraved version was widely distributed and the painting was parodied in political satire. Due to its fame, Fuseli painted at least three other versions of the painting.  Interpretations of The Nightmare have varied widely. The canvas seems to portray simultaneously a dreaming woman and the content of her nightmare. The incubus and the horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists.  Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, which has since been interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Freudian ideas about the unconscious.

The long distance to the pins and straight lines of the lanes will create distortions that your visual cortex tries to compensate for. What will appear as your ball rolling directly to a pin will actually be curvature around it. From that distance and speed your brain will have a hard time processing whether or not the ball is in the right place to hit the pin at the moment of impact.

It's hard to explain but imagine your life like a timeline. Time is linear, and everything that happens in your life occur on this line. Some of these life events are significant enough to cause a ripple like effect, blurring the timeline/causing glimpses or fragments of these events to occur in your mind before they actually happen. The reason you can pick up on those glimpses is because you're one of those people who are more sensitive to it.   I hope that makes sense. It's something some people believe and it offers kind of an explanation for some of your glitches. Take from it what you will :)   I had a similar thing happen to me. I was in a car accident when I was 14, it was easily the worst, most traumatic event of my life. The thing is I had a 'vision' of it the day before it happened, I saw it as vividly as if someone was holding a photograph of the crash scene in front of my face. Everything I saw in that 'vision' was identical to the actual crash the next day, right down to the type of accident it was. I wish I had acted on my impulses... Then I could have stopped it happening.   Anyway, I think you and I might be like those people who are just sensitive to those ripples of the future. If you look into it you'll see that it's not that uncommon, you'd be surprised at how many people have either seen full blown visions of their near future or just get strong feelings/sensations when stuff is about happen."

I was also drunk. There was a third person in the car. The driver went to a fairly secluded car park and started doing donuts. He crashed into a parked vehicle, and we went and collected any debris and left. I realise now you're all thinking I'm a huge cunt and deserve any punishment I get but if you can get past that please read on. I decided in my drunk head that he was now unsuitable to drive and it would be a better idea for me to drive, and I drove his car into a lamp post. Everyone was OK. We then took all identification out of the car and ripped the ignition to make it seem like it was a theft. The police have managed to identify the vehicle through witnesses. Initially the driver said that he was too drunk and I was driving all the time. But we agreed that he would say that he drove initially and crashed into the parked vehicle. However he told his dad (who was the actual owner of the car) that he had NOT driven the car that night, and as the owner of the car, his dad was the one to get questioned about it. I then got questioned and made up a story of me doing it all, so as not to confuse the story, but afterwards I feel like I have fucked myself over way too badly. I am now in for charges of 2 crashes without reporting them and also attempt to stage a theft. The only thing I was adamant about was that I was not drunk at the time. Anyone know of any options I have here? What are the penalties for changing statements? I'm not a bad person and I have never drunk driven before in my life (24). What can I do?"

Let me know if you want it edited differently or have anything changed so you can see anything in particular! http://i.imgur.com/NBZhTfj.jpg
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,Laur-Ent,5,Sun Aug 3 02:51:52 2014 UTC,"Thanks, this actually really helped. I showed a couple of friends the photo in hopes of figuring out what it is and one of them said it was a picture of the highschool taken from the roof of the building beside it, and this confirms it."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,Laur-Ent,2,Sun Aug 3 02:56:38 2014 UTC,"Interesting. Is it hard to get onto that roof? You could go there yourself (not alone though hopefully) and investigate. I'm so interested now.   Anyway I edited the other photo you sent me.   Those lights form the kind of pattern that occurs when either the camera, or the subject, moves while the photo is being taken. If that's the case in this photo, then the subject appears to be about 6 luminescent dots in the sky. They're too bright and clear to be very far away as well. If they were stars, there would be other stars in the photo, not just 6 grouped together. And if the lights were on a building or something, the building itself would be in the photo too.   I edited the photo in a way that if there were any solid objects in the photo, they would show up. But nothing showed up at all which suggests this photo was taken in a really dark field with nothing around at all. There's also apparently no city lights or buildings or anything in the background. So this field would have to have nothing beyond it except maybe a dark forest or something in the distance. At least nothing which is lit or is reflective."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,Psychotr0n,2,Sun Aug 3 04:49:47 2014 UTC,"I know the way up. When I was younger me and a few of my friends used to climb onto miscellaneous roofs across our town, just for shits and giggles. We'd climb up and look around typically before just leaving. I have been on the roof in the past, about a week or two back, but I was intoxicated (like most people that bother with the roof) when I went up and with a few people. As well as a slightly more recent one that happened when I went up with a few other friends, but neither of these times correlate with the date of the photo, or the time frame. The construction fence wasn't there when we did, but I was peaking around earlier and found a really big gap in the fences. It's a fairly easy roof to scale. I'll have to keep digging. Either way, I'm a bit more curious about the second. I'd be lieing if I said your discoveries didn't unnerve me. My phones always either in my pocket or in my room. So if it were in a dark field, that would mean it was taken by somebody with access to my room. I live in a shit neighborhood so I don't k ow if it was stolen, but if it were I doubt I'd have seen it again so soon"
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,Drchains,1 point,Sun Aug 3 07:07:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, if you actually look closely at the bottom you can see what appears to be grass (Maybe a light source coming from the camera/flashlight?), so I am thinking that it's in a field next to a sidewalk, maybe the light is a road lamp? Maybe it's situated near a road? Just a wild guess, but I guess you might see the road if it were a road lamp..."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,VAPossum,3,Mon Aug 4 02:46:37 2014 UTC,"I dug up the other one, any clue what this might be? http://i.imgur.com/rCi2nHw.jpg  Kind of looks like Christmas lights"

GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,iamthedigitalcheese,2,Fri Aug 22 04:00:44 2014 UTC,Is there any chance that one of your friends/roommates keeps stealing your phone and taking weird photos to freak you out?
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,half_a_pony,1 point,Sun Aug 3 11:57:18 2014 UTC,"I doubt it. The second ones still unexplained, and the first one could've been taken by my friend Alex, his phone broke and he uses mine for Facebook. But it would be useless there without internet. So I doubt it"
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cgko2,tenaciousfall,3,Sun Aug 3 19:44:59 2014 UTC,"SO, turns out the first pic is a pic my drunken friend took from the rooftop of one of the schools. We were there and unwanted my phone as a flashlight and apparently either hadn't figured out I have a flashlight app or hadn't figured out taking photos for the flash is a terrible fucking idea. Still no clue what the second photo is."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2cbi6q,Pie4prez,2,Fri Aug 1 08:13:08 2014 UTC,"I do enjoy the coincidences like that too. Although with the number of city names repeated in every state, I think it'd be more worthwhile if this happened somewhere else."

GlitchInTheMatrix,2c7fos,theodork69,1 point,Fri Aug 1 02:23:26 2014 UTC,"That same kind of thing happened to me just last Thursday. Me and my friend (16-17 years old) were driving to band practice and we thought we should pick up another kid. We both looked at the clock and decided ""5:47. We got time."" So we drove to his house, nocked on the door, he didn't answer. I assumed this was because he has a porch with a thin glass door then on the inside of the porch he has a heavier wooden door. After many tries his mom answered and told us he had already gotten a ride. So We got back in the car and got about halfway to school and we both looked at the clock and it was still 5:47. We both noticed but kinda shrugged it off"

GlitchInTheMatrix,2c3cex,Cthalimus,2,Thu Jul 31 05:11:54 2014 UTC,"When I was younger I had a crappy little car with a huge dent in the front left side. It wasn't a very popular car, but I would sometimes see the same model in different colors around town. Once I was on my way home and a car drove by me that was identical to mine down to the left side dent.   Your boyfriend probably saw someone else driving the same car. When he saw the car he didn't even question whether or not it was you, so it is possible that by second guessing it he created a false memory of the woman looking identical to you when in fact she probably didn't.   This is just conjecture, but I would bet something similar to this is actually what happened.   EDIT: /u/Alkenisto posted a briefer version of this first"

A few months go by, and I'm at my first residents hall meeting, and this girl asked our Resident Manager about due dates for the summer housing applications and then about the end of the year extended housing agreements.

GlitchInTheMatrix,2amrdt,Dr_vIQtor,1 point,Mon Jul 14 23:48:55 2014 UTC,"It is truly bizarre that your ex-roommate's number is showing up, through, but before you can really call it a glitch, you need to troubleshoot the much-more-likely technical aspect as well.  First, test this on other phones. Try it on landlines rather than (or in addition to) cell phones, since people have custom contact listings on cells.    If it repeats, then somehow, the phone company has decided your ex-roommate's name should be applied to your account.  Fix with phone company.  If it does not repeat, then try to test it with a neighbor of your parents' who also uses the same phone service they do.  See if it repeats.  If it does, but only when calls are coming into customers of that cable service, then talk to said cable service to let them know there's a problem.  If it does not repeat with the neighbor, and happens only with your parents' house, your parents need to talk to the cable company to see if maybe there's some odd setting they've got, like a custom contact, that somehow has been connected to your incoming number.  If that also fails--if you show up normal on every other phone you try, cannot repeat the error outside of calling your parents' house, and there's no ""custom contacts"" sort of thing going on with your parents' phone setup--then you've got a real glitch in the Matrix."

GlitchInTheMatrix,2agcpn,theweltinator,1 point,Sat Jul 12 19:42:56 2014 UTC,"This is one of the most common things posted on here. Several people on this subreddit have dreams of random events, which they usually forget until it the event they dreamed about happens when they're awake. For example, when I was in second grade, we were doing an activity, and halfway through, I realize that I remember seeing this exact thing written on my paper, in the exact same way. This was the first time my class had done said activity. This is one of the earliest times this happened to me. When I was younger, I usually only remembered the dream after it started ""happening"" when I was awake, but when I got older, I started remembering the dream before I experienced it awake.   Most recent time, I was jogging on a street near my house, when I realize I've seen this exact stretch of road before, from the exact angle, and I then turned my head and looked at a different spot exactly the way I remembered in my dream. Then I think, ""I remember this. A car is about to come up behind me."" I hear a sound. Guess what? A car has just driven up from around a corner behind me. It drives past, and I'm still ""remembering"" this situation, like I've experienced all this too. Then it ends. But it was all exactly the same, I even remember thinking in the dream ""I remember this. A car is about to comee up behind me.""  Usually just insignificant little events in the dreams, nothing life-changing or actually useful to know about my future, but it's still freaky when it happens. I only know one other person IRL who this happens to, one of my friends. No one else I know though."
GlitchInTheMatrix,2agcpn,MBpintas,1 point,Thu Jul 17 20:42:54 2014 UTC,"I didn't know this happened to other people. It happens to me too. But it's sometimes really short, like a single moment when I was standing behind a curly haired man in a queue. 2 days later, it happened. Creepy shit."

GlitchInTheMatrix,29zzaa,peacepineapple,1 point,Tue Jul 8 09:01:35 2014 UTC,"Something like this happens to me as well. It's a very odd and uncomfortable feeling and it seems like a certain category of things trigger it. So here's what happens to me: usually the ""trigger"" is some type of repetitive motion. For example, rubbing a pencil back and forth quickly on a piece of paper for a long amount of time. Then things get weird. Things seem fast and slow at the same time. If I observe how I'm moving in comparison to the world around me, it feels slow, but if I just think of how I'm moving it seems so fast. Also, things seem weirdly loud. Not painful, but just so full of noise. It's something that has happened since I was little, maybe once in every two months. I've actually learned how to make the feeling go away. If I walk around and do things very slowly in a quiet place, it seems to go away. It's really fucking weird feeling"

He said call him when you got back, you called him, he noticed that you called, so he knew you were home. You went and made a sandwich and ten minutes later you called again.

I was playing it in my room and having a blast when I took it out to play a different game and the cartridge fell behind my bed. My bed was always clean underneath and naturally I went diving under there to get it but it was gone. I searched all along the wall, underneath the bed, even the lining of the box spring and looked all over my room for it but I never could find it."

GlitchInTheMatrix,29agcf,tastytastyavocado,2,Mon Jun 30 18:36:07 2014 UTC,"If this was a thing it would have happened more often and to the degree that e.g. archeological discovery could be a seance of reminiscing.  In fact, past lives would have a lot of consequences that are missing in the world as we know it. In order to support the hypothesis you must add a clause of special, privileged knowledge. And usually this reflects the psychology of the proponent and not the nature of the existing universe. This means ruling out said attitude and looking at it inter subjectively, bringing us back to the current view that past lives would entail too many differences from the universe we inhabit."

It's not strictly speaking 'classic' deja vu when it is actually a premonition or 'memory' that has been proven by a map drawing. This requires actual knowledge that shouldn't be known beforehand. It would be 'classic' if it was a momentary lapse in the brain updating the flow of time properly for a few seconds. Just being pedantic ;)"

From what I have read about when something 'jumps' or teleports that if the action is fast enough it creates a vacuum where the object was.

GlitchInTheMatrix,287p9q,RockmyCock,8,Sun Jun 15 18:09:32 2014 UTC,"If you're envisioning these things well before you see them, then you have a real glitch going on.  If it's deja vu, it's likely just your brain.  For lack of a properly scientific explanation, deja vu results when the brain glitches (no pun intended) and ""replays"" something as it's seeing it, or right after it.  I envision it like a mental stutter, though that's probably not correct.  It happens in a way that gives you that ""I've seen this before"" look.  It could be you're pretty wired towards having deja vu, which is why it happens.  As for the TV show thing, that's often a case of coincidence, but because it's so odd, it really stands out to us as almost supernatural.  tl;dr: neurological or psychological reasons for most of this stuff, but I wouldn't rule out a proper glitch."

Usually the time period was about a few weeks to a few months between when I had the dream and then encountered the deja vu, but a few of them were as you mentioned years apart. Usually the dreams were of places I'd never been before and were impossible for me to have been before; i.e. foreign countries or places of work/study. This happened at least 7-10 times growing up.  I don't remember the specifics of any of them, but there is one that I had a few months ago that has yet to resolve itself. Something about an argument with a  future girlfriend and watching TV late at night in some common area, possibly med school I guess. I feel like we were older in the dream, like 26-27ish"

GlitchInTheMatrix,27xgzw,FoxylambA,8,Thu Jul 3 08:31:13 2014 UTC,"The explanation I heard for deja vu was that your brain tags new experiences with ""I remember this happening a long time ago"" rather than ""I remember this happening less than a second ago"", it's a misfiling fault. Of course it's going to be detailed because you literally just made the memory, but it got misfiled under ""deepest childhood"" rather than ""right now"".  The only way you could actually be sure it wasn't a false memory is with proof from outside your own brain.  Try this experiment out for a demonstration of how your own brain can fool you. Go listen to some audio that you have never heard before, try to predict the next words, you will probably find that it feels like you are predicting the words like a millisecond before you actually hear them. This is due to the lag time in processing speed, most of the time your brain fools you into thinking that you heard the sound of the word ""hippo"" (for example) at the same time you recognised it as the word hippo. In reality it's a mishmash of perception and processing events that your brain tags as having happened at the same time."

They seem to be about really trivial events and conversations after I dream them, but when they unfold in real life and I get that sense of déjà vu, and after the major change in hindsight I realise inevitably they are the trivial events and stuff that happen right before some major upheaval.  The events don't seem to be related to the upheaval but it's a very useful heads up all the same."

I dreamt that i was walking around a wooden building with painted red siding. When i got to the back side, there was a small concrete basketball court and trees scattered around on 3 sides.  When i was 15, i went on a church camping trip in a state I've never been to. A few friends and i were exploring the camp site when i see the basketball court from my dream. The building we had just walked around had red painted wooden siding exactly as i had seen it in the dream. Then i see the trees scattered around just as i remembered them.  I had not only seen all of this before, i had exactly retraced my steps from the dream. I love that feeling."

It was morning and I was getting ready for school. I lived only with my Mom at the time. She got ready in her bathroom, connected to the master bedroom, and I got ready in the smaller bathroom down the hall.  I was walking towards my bathroom but noticed the door was closed and could see the light on through the space under the door. I figured my Mom was in there for some reason and considered knocking and asking why she wasn't using her own bathroom, but instead I continued down the hall, figuring I would use her bathroom if she was using mine.  I go into her bathroom and she is in there, and she asks me if I need anything. I turn around and go back down the hall towards my bathroom, and the door is open and the light is off."

GlitchInTheMatrix,27m66q,EnlightenedEnigma,10,Sun Jun 8 13:02:04 2014 UTC,I've gotten calls from 000-000-0000 in the past. I'm pretty sure blockbuster was one place to have that number on caller ID.  Lots of companies these days use viop or a different method to spoof the number that shows up on an individuals phone.
GlitchInTheMatrix,27m66q,90blacktsiawd,3,Sun Jun 8 15:53:35 2014 UTC,yea I have no doubt there are ways to get around that- I just thought it was odd how even after my number was changed I was still receiving these calls. Its a possibility is was one of my friends but its been years and they still haven't told me.
GlitchInTheMatrix,27m66q,90blacktsiawd,5,Sun Jun 8 18:40:34 2014 UTC,It absolutely could be one of your friends screwing with you. Or it could just be one or two random telemarketing companies that use robo callers that spoofs its number. But its def not a glitch.

GlitchInTheMatrix,27m66q,smeezy,4,Sat Jul 5 21:37:43 2014 UTC,Also after this I changed my number and only added my closest friends. I do believe they called one more time but I didn't answer.

GlitchInTheMatrix,279kiq,KornymthaFR,2,Thu Jun 5 23:26:10 2014 UTC,"Here is another quick story, not sure if it counts as a glitch, but still creepy. This happened a couple of years ago. It was about 7:30/8 at night when I started feeling very nervous even though I had no reason to feel that way. As the time went by I got more and more nervous, I decided to go to bed at about 10pm. Once I laid down my nervousness level probably doubled for no reason. For hours I twisted and turned in my bed, I just couldn't get rid of this horrible feeling. It was about 1:30am when I finally fell asleep. I woke up after maybe 15 minutes, gasping for breath after a nasty, disturbing dream. In this dream I was in a strange house I had never seen before when suddenly the place started shaking and then there was a huge wave that engulfed everything. I woke up right after I died from drowning. This made me even more nervous because I never have vivid dreams, especially nightmares. I laid there for a bit longer when I decided to watch some TV thinking maybe it will help ease the nervousness. I turned on the TV and the news came on. In big letters it said, ""BREAKING NEWS: HUGE EARTHQUAKE CAUSES TSUNAMI* IN JAPAN."" Once I read that ALL nervousness just disappeared. I was confused now. Was that dream from somebody else's perspective? Just a weird coincidence? I'm still not sure, still creeps me out thinking about the dream. It was just so...real in a strange way.  *I'm not sure if it was a tsunami or something similar. I just know the earthquake caused a a huge wave that took out tons of people and houses. It was back in 2010 I believe, so I forgot what it was called."

GlitchInTheMatrix,2779u8,Duudeski,2,Tue Jun 3 17:25:15 2014 UTC,It also has happened to me at an elevator nearby where i work. But i do not think its any sort of electrical surge or anything like that because I have had the same feeling from touching other non-electrical objects.

If you had of passed her, walking opposite ways, turned a corner and she walked past you again, in the opposite direction, and then it happened a few seconds later on another corner; I could believe this. But you dasher in the morning one place, then in the afternoon at another place, then the same morning place as always the next morning?

These seizures are sometimes referred to as petit mal seizures (from the French for ""little illness"", a term dating from the late 18th century).  Absence seizures are characterized by a brief loss and return of consciousness, generally not followed by a period of lethargy (without a notable postictal state).

Weirdly, I was the only kid outside in the neighborhood for a few minutes.  It had to be just after lunch, because I remember I was waiting for my brothers to come outside.  As a time waster, I started to jump up and down on the water meter cover there in the front yard.  So, I'm turned facing the front door and start jumping up and down in that one spot.  After a few jumps, I just stop midair.  I was hanging frozen in the air for a few seconds, just silently freaking out trying to figure out how this was happening.  All of a sudden, I just drop back to the ground and everything went back to normal.  A half second after my feet hit the ground, I ran inside the house to see what was taking my brothers so long.

GlitchInTheMatrix,24tsw5,OutsideObserver,5,Fri May 9 18:42:14 2014 UTC,"Shimabara Rebellion:       The Shimabara Rebellion (島原の乱, Shimabara no ran ?) was an uprising in southwestern Japan lasting from December 17, 1637 to April 15, 1638, during the Edo period. It largely involved peasants, most of them Catholic Christians.  It was one of only a handful of instances of serious unrest during the relatively peaceful period of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule.  In the wake of the Matsukura clan's construction of a new castle at Shimabara, taxes were drastically raised, which provoked anger from local peasants and rōnin, samurai without masters. Religious persecution of the local Catholics exacerbated the discontent, which turned into open revolt in 1637. The Tokugawa Shogunate sent a force of over 125,000 troops to suppress the rebellion and after a lengthy siege against the rebels at Hara Castle, defeated them.  In the wake of the rebellion, the Catholic rebel leader Amakusa Shiro was beheaded and the prohibition of Christianity was strictly enforced. Japan's national seclusion policy was tightened and official persecution of Christianity continued until the 1850s. Following the successful suppression of the rebellion, the daimyo of Shimabara, Matsukura Katsuie, was beheaded for misruling, becoming the one and only daimyo to be beheaded during the Edo period.

High-frequency audible noise of article  Cathode ray tube:       50 Hz/60 Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734 Hz (for NTSC systems) or 15,625 Hz (for PAL systems).  These frequencies are at the upper range of human hearing and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.  The sound is due to magnetostriction in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the flyback transformer.  This problem does not occur on 100/120 Hz TVs and on non-CGA computer displays, because they are working on much higher frequencies (22 kHz to >100 kHz) compared to the low-frequency noise (50 Hz or 60 Hz) of mains hum.

GlitchInTheMatrix,24703l,akambe,9,Mon Apr 28 17:12:21 2014 UTC,"As much as I can remember, The party just repeated but I know that it was three separate days."

If you are over 14, you'll soon find out that the majority of humans on this planet had dreams where they did normal things like getting up, getting dressed, going to the toilet, going to school/work etc just to wake up and having to do it all over again.  I know you all like to have a story to put on here but it is wearing thin now. Maybe before posting you could Google it first, then you'd know it is as common as muck and not worth posting.

The first thought I had was that your brother had taken the stripes off. Maybe they were glued on. Considering that he is capable of playing tricks without confessing, I'd assume that he would also take stuff off and not tell anyone either. These things are usually made quite cheaply."
GlitchInTheMatrix,241iju,PUPiDDAJ,1 point,Sun Apr 27 15:21:07 2014 UTC,"The stripes were not glued on or somehow attached to the worm, but the worm's fur itself was coloured. The red and the white fur was made out of the same material. There was nothing to be ripped off, all the fur is still there, but it's white now. With the ""gap"" I meant a tiny line between the white and the blue/red fur, probably there because the manufacturers had to change the material at that point to continue with the other colour. It's kind of hard to explain, but I hope you can roughly understand what I'm trying to say."

I've also been half-asleep and seen something completely innocent, but my mind twisted it to think it was something else. This happened when my cat caught a bird and brought it inside. It was still alive and for some reason, I thought it was a severed hand flopping around and flipped the hell out. I wasn't until I woke up fully that I realized I was a little crazy when I was only half-awake. Maybe something like that is what you experienced? And maybe your mom blanches at the subject because the way you reacted that night scared her?"

I do think it was a dream though, not one where you have to lie in bed  but one that carried on when you were up and doing things. Your brain was still half asleep [this is a real thing, in people who suffer from night hag syndrome, their body is still asleep and their brain is half awake. Hence they see all sorts of things that look incredibly real and they are awake.] Your mother's reaction must be investigated further by asking her why she's so scared to tell you.

Maybe it was a rare animal that escaped its cage that your family ought not to have had, and that is why they don't want to talk about it now?

I grabbed it expecting it to be stale tasting, but it tasted brand new and had no dust on it, I thought my sister had left it on the shelf, so I asked all of my sisters and my mom (everyone that was there, or had been there since the start of the move) if they had done it and the all said no. so I continued packing up and forgot about it.  the very next day, the same exact thing happened, once again forgot about it, and on the third day it HAPPENED AGAIN. note that on the second and third days I reached in exactly the same spot and there was only one when I found it, after the third time I decided to check the entire shelf and there were no others, but it didn't happen again the fourth day."

We let it go to VM and later checked it. Again we hear the garbled and muffeled sound of our own voices. Except, this time our voices were raised like we were in an argument. That one really scared my husband who is rational Richard.   I still have those voice mails saved on my phone. I need to learn how to upload them.  Also, I tried to use google in hopes of finding a similar story to mine but I could not find anything at all. Sure, people have always gotten weird calls, but this was personal and on a whole different level."
GlitchInTheMatrix,235wax,Vicky_Vallencourt,2,Sun Apr 20 23:56:43 2014 UTC,"Given that you can't remember having the conversation you heard my theory might not make sense, but I'll mention it anyway.   Maybe you had called your husband, he didn't answer, then as you were leaving him a voice mail he called back. Instead of cutting off the voice mail kept recording.   When I get cutoff from leaving a voice mail sometimes an ""unknown number"" will call me back, and it's the system asking if I'd like to send my rerecord my message. The call you got could have been the voice mail service and the voice mail you heard could have been your phone conversation that accidentally recorded and sent."
GlitchInTheMatrix,235wax,yeah_habitual_liar,2,Wed Apr 30 04:28:58 2014 UTC,"I cannot discount that as a possibility. I don't really remember what exactly I was doing or where the phone was at the time the message was left.   Something about it still strikes me as weird. Maybe it isn't my husband and I at all? Who knows, it certainly sounded exactly like us although the context of what I could decipher of the conversation was very alien to me."
GlitchInTheMatrix,235wax,Vicky_Vallencourt,1 point,Thu May 1 02:06:56 2014 UTC,"This is neat. Is like updates to this. But to upload them, you could always just play then back (with good speakers of it's a smart phone) and use a mic to record.  Maybe have you and your husband being filmed while displaying it so the viewer has a live comparison of the voices."
GlitchInTheMatrix,235wax,Tanya3,1 point,Tue Apr 22 09:32:15 2014 UTC,"Use ""virtual voicemail"" if you can. You can save the file like that. Or go oldschool and record with a mic."

GlitchInTheMatrix,235wax,OuttaSightVegemite,1 point,Thu Apr 17 10:29:38 2014 UTC,I got a voicemail like that on my phone once too! I was at my friends' place and the 3 of us were sitting in the backyard by a fire. I went inside to grab new beers and saw that I had a VM but no missed call. When I listened to the message it was the 3 of us talking outside not 5 minutes earlier. All 3 of our phones were inside on the counter the entire time.
GlitchInTheMatrix,235wax,rcg90,7,Thu Jun 19 21:49:49 2014 UTC,Maybe it was a friend of yours playing a trick on both of you?

As your hand entered your pocket it instinctively opened to grasp some change. That's when your key got mingled with the coins. I think you handed the key and the change to the apparition...which later returned it, along with the message that they didn't want your key, only ""something for the train."""

My parents lost a set of keys. We looked all over the place and then suddenly they appeared out of thin air, about 3 feet off the ground, and dropped to the floor. My parents and I all saw it and we all agree it was paranormal.   There was no where the keys could have been sitting before falling (it was in the middle of the room) with no furniture close by and we all saw them blink into existence before falling under the influence of gravity.  The above incident was one of many. The house we lived in was haunted, I believe. We eventually got the fuck out of there."

I always thought glitches were more like unexplained events that suggested our reality is not what it seems to be. In my view, an example of precognition is not really a glitch. But  yes, in answer to your question I think most people have had some experience of precognition like yours ranging from the common place (thinking of someone you havent heard from in a while and then getting a phone call from them shortly afterwards) or more interesting examples like yours."

In your previous life you passed together with your loved one and in the memory you were upset because you weren't sure if your souls would rejoin together again in your current life.   I also remember a moment in time there SEEMED to me that where we were going was longer than that. (hours days years?)   I don't understand that, to be perfectly honest.  It should be noted that I'm not particularly religious and don't necessarily believe in reincarnation, but if this is true, and if my assessment of this is accurate, that's absolutely reincarnation."

I also wonder how much of people with certain types of asperger's and other autism are affected by similar things but maybe don't/can't explain it, that maybe having other frequencies turned down, some are turned up. Ya know?"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1zrdz1,Mindsequalone,2,Fri Mar 7 02:17:54 2014 UTC,We know very little of the power of the human mind. Maybe people who have been affected in normal areas have unlocked areas typically not accessible. So it is possible that the human species has a potential for telepathy. A mother and her link with her child and visa versa. This could be an example. EX moms know when there child is in danger or being stupid. EX2 child know when something is wrong with there mother.

GlitchInTheMatrix,1zpwhg,dldozer,4,Thu Mar 6 17:54:49 2014 UTC,"I have been reading these journals all day long. A lot of what I remembered was wrong, but so close to the reality. I've also been flooded with emotion just realizing that what I'm reading is my past, that these experiences are mine. Or they were the experiences of all my personalities at the times they were in the driver seat. I'm starting to understand and remember the true past I've had, but being only a singular personality now, it all still feels like a foreign experience. Like I'm remembering scenes in a movie instead of the event itself. Someone previously asked if the hormones I take could create the false memories. While that doesn't seem possible, they may have had a hand in my personality merge. How? No one seems to be able to answer that unfortunately.  There is a single journal entry that really makes me think that theory is plausible. The old primary personality, who the rest of us seemed to simply refer to as ""The Primary"" and the woman that the rest of us seemed to split off from, mentioned that she was feeling more and more whole each day. Like she was finally feeling peace with her body and 2 of the others in her head. I was apparently one of the 2 that agreed, but there was apparently a guy that wanted nothing to do with us as we ruined ""his masculine physique."" The primary was having none of it though, and seemed to have an argument with him as stated in that entry. That was the last entry from the primary, and it was 3 days before the incident.  What happened in our head that fateful night, I can't even begin to remember, but maybe I'm not meant to.  (Each personality had their own name, and they will all be kept private out of desire for privacy for myself)"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1zpwhg,angelspast,2,Thu Mar 6 19:14:22 2014 UTC,"I do feel that this is a coping mechanism. I have had a couple of people close to me experience dysphoria and it is pretty hardcore sometimes. It has got to be hard being in the wrong body when everyone is calling you a male and your dominant personality is female. The splitting of personalities usually occurs when you are trying to deal with something traumatic like that, and would allow you to be your feminine self, while also allowing you to be confused about it. The male personality is most likely a physical representation of your doubts and issues you experienced while transitioning. I believe the female personality is your complete feminine ideal self which, since it was split from the male personality, would not acknowledge the fact that you were on hormones/had a penis. It seems the hormones allowed you dominant personality to take control as you are not having such a raging internal battle with yourself. Sorry for rambling, I hope it all makes sense. I don't think you are cray, i think you are just trying to deal with the fact that you are a woman and your body doesn't seem to reflect that correctly, when you are asleep those dormant personalities could take charge."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1zpwhg,angelspast,2,Mon Mar 17 01:05:14 2014 UTC,"It's been a while since I logged into this account, but I thought I'd still respond to your comment. I finished reading my journals and got my complete medical history to help piece together everything I went through. It seems that my personalities began to spilt and solidify as I went through puberty. But I was also aware of all my personalities after some time passed. There seemed to be communication between them, but I can't remember any of that. Even the time I spent with multiple personalities is still a foggy memory. I remember parts of my past, all from the perspective of myself, but the experiences were spread across the various personalities.  Since I've become a single personality though, things seem to be greatly improving. The first day was really fucking weird, mostly due to the missing details being filled in by my newly fused self. Things were probably jumbled around a bit in that process, but I'm comfortable with who I am now. My mom loves me as her daughter, and treats me as if I was always female. I did have to learn how to handle having a penis on my own though. It's pretty simple though, and I'm able to get through each day without issue. I'm now a functioning member of society again, and I have a future ahead of me. I look forward to being able to hold a job and supporting myself without state aid."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1yxqwo,foxfaction,2,Tue Feb 25 23:23:30 2014 UTC,"I get that feeling a lot when I tell stories from childhood. It almost makes you second guess yourself as if you made it up. To be honest memory is such a bizarre/fragile thing that I wouldn't be surprised. If you think about it, any story you tell is going to differ from what happened in reality. It's just the degree of difference that changes. Anything that has happened with more than one witness is going to have two point of views. Physical factors like angle/distance will create differences and also mental factors like emotions and attitude will significantly alter a story. I actually have a story that always gives me that feeling. I had a very attractive math teacher in tenth grade. She had huge boobs and routinely walked around checking homework. One day as she was leaning over my desk a button (or multiple) broke off of her shirt exposing her fun bags. She promptly ran out of the room. The thing is I've brought it up to someone who was in the class before (we're both 23 now) and he said he remembered but his reaction to my story said otherwise. I know for sure this happened it just seems too lucky. One day I'll reach out to the teacher finally confirm.  Ps - if you are an attractive math teacher who fits the role in my story please message me."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1y2txn,yourenot,2,Mon Feb 17 17:42:40 2014 UTC,Alright then.  Figured it was worth asking.
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y2txn,CrazyTillItHurts,1 point,Mon Feb 17 17:51:09 2014 UTC,Yeah. I wish I could explain it off that easily. This is precisely why I was so disturbed.

GlitchInTheMatrix,1y2txn,Blankato,1 point,Mon Feb 17 18:08:48 2014 UTC,"I mean... I really don't want to sound crazy. I know I wasn't in sleep paralysis or a waking dream, I know there was no way it could be a prank, I know I was awake and I know what I saw. But I can't explain it.  I literally almost had an emotional/mental breakdown because this scared me so much. I was to the point of trying to find off campus living I was so afraid of him and my dorm. It was far and away the most unsettling thing I've ever experienced."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,stefneh5295,3,Sun Feb 16 21:58:20 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure what you're describing IS deja vu. Some people might describe it as a ""ooh I've felt this before"" kind of thing, but I think in your case that feeling may only manifest after you ""got something right."" I think this would also explain why when you started ""testing"" it, it stopped working."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,Lunchbox725,3,Mon Feb 17 03:25:03 2014 UTC,"After reading this again I want to clarify what I meant...this is just my theory, but what if that feeling that you ""predicted"" something that happened IS the déjà vu. After it happens, your mind tricks you into overwhelmingly thinking that you had predicted what just happened, even though you actually hadn't. Does that make sense? Next time you think it's happening, try writing down your prediction. If it then happens anyway, my theory would be wrong. I'd be willing to bet, though, that the time between your ""prediction"" and the event is always so small that you wouldn't ever have time to write it down or otherwise document it. I think that would also support the idea that it's our brain playing tricks on you."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,Lunchbox725,1 point,Mon Feb 17 04:42:46 2014 UTC,"Well I'm open to your thoughts 100%, you could well be right, I could just be making myself think that. It's just weird because it only started to un-sync and I started getting it wrong when I was trying to mess it up, on purposely not doing what I thought was supposed to happen. Only then it started being wrong. And I went back to playing along with it not doing anything I didn't think I was supposed to happen and it synced again. It's very weird, I know. And it really could just be me being paranoid or something xD It could be my mind playing tricks on me, but like you say with writing it down, i kind of just do that in my head, it's very strange. I get that ""déjà vu"" feeling, and then I just say in my head what I feel they will say, so for example if I say something to my brother, and before he answers I get the déjà vu feeling, I instantly have a thought it my head what he will say, but it's not as if I myself have thought it up, if that makes sense? it's more as if something told me? and I would say in my head ""now he says 'I have a test next week it's going to suck' "" and then he actually says it. and for the longest time I thought that was normal, to just suddenly know the next sentence, as if I already read ahead of the script.  and yeh, to be honest if I did predict what he said correctly but I stopped him and said ""WAIT I need to write down something"" that would probably mess up any kind of ""sync"" there could of been, instead of saying what he was maybe ""intended"" to say or that I thought he would say, he might just stop and be like... what are you on? and lose track of what he was going to say. So that's usually why I ""play"" along, because there's this feeling that if I ""stray"" from the script, I'll mess up the scene? haha xD No idea if any of this makes sense, but I'm trying to explain the best I can xD sorry if I am confusing."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,third3y3guy,2,Mon Feb 17 15:01:00 2014 UTC,"I've actually experienced this once. I've had many Deja Vus before, and strangely, they do come in groups. You know how you can 'feel' that the Deja Vu is happening, this one time I was going through one. It was so intense that what my family member was saying I was also thinking in exact sync. Then, I started to predict the words they were saying before they said it. This lasted for less than a minute. I just kept on with my day without saying anything."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,Shivermetimbersmatey,1 point,Mon Feb 17 04:14:23 2014 UTC,"Yeh déjà vu is a very strange feeling, it's almost unexplainable xD there really is nothing that I can relate it to, if I was trying to explain the feeling literally the only thing I would be able to say is that it feels like... déjà vu. haha xD But that really is exactly what happens to me when I get it. I've never really told anyone, not properly. More so just a ""I knew you were going to say that"" and they shake it off as a ""OH they know me so well!"" and it's like, that really isn't what it was, but I will let you think that haha.  It's also weird how it only lasts for what feels like a split second, then it goes away."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,Shivermetimbersmatey,2,Mon Feb 17 14:46:51 2014 UTC,"This same experience happened to me frequently when I was young. Sometimes as many as 3 or 4 times a day. It was kind of neat at first...then it started getting annoying. It seems so unexplainable at first. Your brain tries to rationalize how this is possible. Free will vs fatalism...that kind of stuff.   I finally realized that the first experience is in a dream. Then as it happens in reality, whenever that is, you get the feeling of familiarity. You start to recall the dream as it occurs. That's why you get the feeling you have been there before. It's buried in your  subconscious dream that you don't remember when you wake up the next day.  Not until it happens.   I started writing down my dreams as I woke in the middle of the night. I had some interesting experiences. And in the meantime, had developed some annoying phobias because if it.   What you have explained is identical to my experiences. I believe you have dreamt the initial occurrence."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,Shivermetimbersmatey,1 point,Mon Feb 17 04:56:03 2014 UTC,"Oh, that is pretty interesting! I can't say that I have ever felt as if I was re-remembering a dream, but that is interesting that that is what it is for you. I've always had really bad problems with sleeping, from sleep walking completely unconscious, to sleep walking half there and kind of ""watching"" my body move independently from me, Being stuck in sleep paralysis and having some really torturous nightmares I've actually had to train myself to force myself out of... My dreams usually feel extremely real at the time, no matter how surreal, then when I wake I realise it was a dream. (Pretty obviously like most people haha) So for all I know, It very well could be that I'm dreaming it without knowing. I've tried to jump out a window apparently! in my sleep because I thought I was trapped, haha xD so there's no reason I couldn't do that? Dreaming in itself is a very interesting topic xD So in a way, you actually 'predict' an event that will happen the following day through your dreams? that's interesting :o It makes me wonder how your mind knew? or that we already know how our lives play out subconsciously? I mean, they do tarot cards and readings which are supposed to be you ""getting in touch"" with your subconscious, and from my experiences they have been quite accurate most of the time. So I think that may be a really possible theory!  If you don't mind me asking of course, what kind of phobias have you developed? From what I know, I have ""Phonophobia"", to sum it up, suspense KILLS me. haha. If you were to hold a balloon and tell me you were going to pop it, but not tell me when, that little ""phobia"" switch of unnecessary fear and frustration flicks on. It's not so bad now I have somewhat ""conquered"" it, I'm definitely more in control of it then I used to be. But it's interesting for me to hear how people developed theirs. :D"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y3acq,MisScarlettBegonias,2,Mon Feb 17 14:41:31 2014 UTC,"I understand exactly what you are saying. There is no dream recall during a déjà vu. Just that feeling of familiarity. I had the same feelings you had. Deja vu would go by and it would be a neat experience.   Then one night, I woke from a dream and realized that this was a future déjà vu. In the dream itself I remember laughing and realizing. The hard part is trying to get some reference of the dream itself. It's impossible to understand what the future looks like. So I wrote the dream down...not that I needed to. Because as it happened, it was exactly as I had seen it in the dream. And I laughed just as I did in the dream.  My déjà vu frequency was getting high. Sometimes 3 times a day. Maybe 10 times a week. And the more they come, the more I would look at my dreams. Try to get a feeling for which ones were bogus silly dreams and which ones were going to happen. This is where phobias kick in. I had a dream of an incident on a plane once. It got to the point where I struggled to get on a plane. I am still a nervous flyer. I sit on the left had side of a plane every time. This one example of the phobias.   People have countless dreams they do t recall. What feels like a night of no dreams, I promise is full of brain activity. You just don't remember them.   There is a lot of detail I am omitting but I've come to the conclusion that it is an interesting phenomenon and I can't do anything about it.  I hope that helps to fill in some of the gaps from my first comments. If you ever want any more info, i'd be happy to answer whatever questions or any issues you may have.  Oh, and get your damn sleeping thing figured out :)"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y2k1e,Commack,3,Sun Feb 16 17:21:50 2014 UTC,"Maybe you knew about it before, but subconsciously :P it's pretty crazy the little things our brain actually pick up without us knowing. Some people think it's crazy but the whole subliminal messaging thing is a good example of it. You might have glanced or picked up on little things to do with the event beforehand, and then dreamt about it. Obviously it's only an idea. It's still pretty strange. :P"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y2k1e,stefneh5295,3,Sun Feb 16 20:46:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's something to think about. Hopefully it was something like that because it's creepy if I actually dreamed about it without knowing what the event was. I like the topic of dreaming though, it's very interesting."

I've read about people that have sworn they have met each other through astro projecting, which was pretty interesting to think about!   Oh! oh so very interesting indeed. It is strange to think as to why we dream? I mean, there is bound to be a more scientific reason, but open mindedly on a more spiritual level, I love to think about it! I've had a LOT of problems with sleeping in the past and it really gets me thinking. I have had instances of being stuck in my dreams what felt like infinitely, some very torturous dreams which I actually ended up having to train myself to be able to force myself out of! being stuck in paralysis, sleep walking with me not being there at all (completely unconscious) and sleep walking half there kind of ""watching/experiencing my body do things independently""... oh some very strange crap!"

GlitchInTheMatrix,1xzzfg,bedheadprincess,3,Sun Feb 16 04:31:42 2014 UTC,One time I was driving past a fancy all boys private school on my lunch break in my friends car. I threw a cheese sandwich and it went STRAIGHT THROUGH a gap in the vertical bars lining their playground (about 1.5 inches apart each) from a car going at 40mph and smacked a Year 11 (16 year old) in the head. He then turned to the nearest awkward Year 7 (11 year old) and pounced on him. Still feel a bit bad about that but it was a bitchin' throw.

GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,SuperFishy,2,Sun Feb 16 06:13:14 2014 UTC,"I don't see this as a glitch, although it is intriguing. When your mind starts to get into that ""higher level"" thinking (i.e. pondering the interconnectedness of the universe), you become extremely attuned to the present and start to think outside the ""self"": our minds possess the ability to see well beyond our first person view. Hence, the Instagram post may have been attracted to your consciousness (or vice versa) because of your heightened awareness.   Side note: you say you are ""in awe at the amazing power of LSD"". LSD simply helped facilitate your cognitive changes; your mind, however, always has this ability for higher levels of thinking whether or not you consume a drug. For example, I reached the same realm of thinking - where everything just made sense - on separate occasions through shrooms one time and DXM another. There are many different paths that lead the mind to the same level of awareness."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,maxterbator710,2,Sun Feb 16 06:29:24 2014 UTC,"I agree with you and you're theory behind the coincidence is interesting! I to have gotten to a somewhat ""outside myself"" state both on a come down from MD and just taking nos (Nitrous oxide canisters inhaled via balloon) and both were some of the most amazing experiences I have had. I find it funny that a lot of people have said to me that Drugs are silly and you're just out of it, you make that ""crap"" up because you are off your face. Yet a lot of people have had similar experiences using different drugs, that all seem to be on the same level. There's even people that claim to get to that state just meditating and training their minds! I personally think that people have been told that drugs are bad, and because its part of the ""unknown"" they are afraid to think any differently. Drugs don't just invent this stuff, it activates parts of our brains that we don't really use and it plays with chemicals that we already have. I'm babbling, yes! but I find this stuff very interesting!"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,stefneh5295,2,Sun Feb 16 21:05:56 2014 UTC,"Absolutely, I am actually now 18 months sober and have been able to have glimpses of the ""outside self"" thinking. It is definitely more difficult without drugs, but it is also much more rewarding and sticks with you longer. I feel it is a much more genuine experience without the ""shortcut"" of drugs, and I will eagerly continue exploring these realms of consciousness!"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,maxterbator710,1 point,Sun Feb 16 21:36:33 2014 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you there, i admit there are some things i still want to try for experiences sake, but i would love to work a little harder to get to those same lengths without drugs. I've heard some amazing things and it really is exciting just to think what are minds are capable of. Lucid dreaming (i have only managed to do once :(. ) and astro projection are also things i would love to give a try. :')"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,stefneh5295,2,Sun Feb 16 21:42:19 2014 UTC,"I have ALWAYS had a strong fascination with ""awaking"" drugs, that are known for shattering your reality for good, and giving you a wider perspective. I think it really is amazing, and I haven't yet but am very interesting in trying LSD. I have had a few drug related experiences that have changed me for life, for the good, I'm quite light bodied so simpler things blow me away. And I really love this stuff, this is the stuff I hear of that I want to experience. Losing reality is an exciting concept to me. Me and my sister are quite open minded people and we have both had strange coincidences happen that really make you think. Is there something bigger behind it? I'm atheist, but open minded to any concept or theory behind this kind of stuff. We have tried things like tarot cards and that kind of stuff as well, and that is always so interesting. xD"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,stefneh5295,2,Sun Feb 16 20:57:04 2014 UTC,"I have very similar interests with expanding the mind. I just find it so interesting that a simple molecule can vastly alter ones perceptions. Also before this experience, I considered myself atheist but have since become agnostic because I kept getting this reoccurring thought of universal consciousness, which was rather convincing at the time. More of a feeling of a higher power rather than a ""god"". I have still been contemplating this since then.  Anyway I recommend you try it. It was a life changing experience for both my friend and I. I definitely think you would gain some insight if you do. Just do your research and do it safely."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,stefneh5295,2,Sun Feb 16 21:16:42 2014 UTC,"I can totally understand the feeling of a higher power! Quick warning that I may go on a rant about an experience! I am sorry in advance!   I had this one time where I slipped into an almost meditative state, sadly to say it was influenced by drugs, but none the less a wonderful experience. Everything around me dimmed, I was in a room full of people with a movie blaring in the background yet all of that melted away. as if I turnt my ears off, I could no longer hear anyone, and my eyes lost focus of the things around me. It was wonderful, that's what you aim for when you meditate and I have tried a lot of times but the brain gets really quite annoyed when you try to ignore it! anyway, I started to hear this, higher being, I felt connected with something or someone. At the time it felt like myself, just a higher version of myself. Up in some kind of higher dimension or something I have absolutely no idea, but I started talking to this person, and I started asking very important questions. The kind of questions people have come to just accept that will never be answered. Why am I here, What's my purpose, where will I end up. That kind of thing. and this strange being, this person... answered my questions. They knew everything and everything made sense. In that moment I felt complete and I felt as if I could live my life, anything could happen and it wouldn't matter because I had my answers. I started writing them down on my hand, I thought it's something I should document, right? Naturally, I took notes. But I started to come down, my eyes were starting to focus back to the unimportant things in the room, my ears started tuning back in to the random conversation going on in the room. I came out of that state and it was an extremely strange feeling.   But I was absolutely heartbroken when I looked back at my hand. It was one of the weirdest experiences I had ever had, because I had written everything down, but not in English. not in any language, I had written it in symbols that at the time only made sense to me. I had my answers right in front of me, and I couldn't read them! xD It's as if I made up my own language, and as I came down, it was decided I wasn't ready to actually know them. and it was taken away from me. it was a very heart sinking feeling and I went to my friend in distress, and told her what happened, we took minor drugs together fairly often, very much ""on the same wavelength"" kind of people so we would get together and share experiences that were very strangely similar, she comforted me and told me she knew exactly how I felt. I asked her why, and she lead me to the corner of a room, where the exact same thing happened to her and she had scribbled on the wall. Obviously her own little nonsense language, but the fact that the exact same thing happened to her was... mind blowing.  I don't follow religion, mainly because I'm put off by all the hatred and war that has come from it, I also don't agree with it 100% but the main story to it, the concept of god... the genuine parts are very much possible. People back then may well have had similar experiences. They do say that that part of the brain was very much active at one point and these days its all shrivelled up and actually takes some work to get back into... (at least from what I have heard) so I could very much see that kind of perspective to religion and the possibilities of there being higher beings or a god. I especially love the theory that we are one with 'god' and the universe. It amazing to think about this stuff! I'm sorry! rant over! I had done a little research, but you are right. I should look into it a bit more before I try it and find me a good friend to try it with! it's definitely on the to-do list!"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,autowikibot,2,Sun Feb 16 22:21:59 2014 UTC,"Dont be sorry! I actually very much enjoy reading intriguing events like this. That is exactly how I felt in that moment; everything was so clear and obvious, but know it's just a blur. My reasoning behind feeling this universal truth was because I kept thinking, without a doubt in my mind, that science and religion was all looking for the same thing. Every spiritual person looking for their god was the exact same as any physicist trying to determine the fabled Unified Theory of physics. It's the same thing they are seeking. It was very bizarre but so convincing at the same time.   Anyway, I would be very interested in the symbols you wrote down if you remember any of them. I had a similar experience with symbols during this trip when I dcided to just start drawing on a piece of paper and look at the outcome. When my pen hit the paper, it was so strange, like I could feel the exact path of where it needed to go. All I needed to do was move my hand and my mind determined where it should go, although I wasn't actively imagining anything to draw, it just happened. Turns out I kept drawing this spiral over and over again. I researched it later and found out it is a spiral created by a sequence of numbers called the Fibonacci series. I found out that this same spiral is seen in nature almost everywhere from shells, to pinecones, to flowers, and many many more. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number  Heres an interesting video I found of it too after the experience. Watch parts 2 and 3 as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0"

GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,stefneh5295,2,Sun Feb 16 23:16:56 2014 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you :) The shame is that we are all looking for the same thing, we are all striving to feed our curiosity and have this knowledge and reassurance about our universal, a real understanding. yet a lot of people focus on the differences rather then the similarities. A lot of war is based off of religion, but really religion is all the same thing, it's the same underlining concept and most of the time people are just ignorant over the details. Which is quite saddening. Like you said, whether it's a scientist or a spiritual person. It shouldn't really matter. I know there's a massive stereotype about drugs and hippies with the whole ""peace and love"" thing, but with the experiences I have had I can't help but have that mind set, it's more so looking at the bigger picture. People fight over petty things and our worlds slowly being destroyed, there is corruption everywhere, we absolutely have the resources to put everyone on this earth in a good place. People don't need to be poor, if we put our time into helping each other we would likely advance so much quicker. Can you imagine a world with no concept of money? what if there's someone in a third-world country with the capacity to come to a ground breaking revelation that could change our world forever, and they never get that chance because of the situation they were born into, you know? It's crazy!  And unfortunately I didn't copy it to paper, I really really wish I did because it would of been something interesting to look back on. It was such a surreal experience. And I kind of know what you mean with it feeling right, I like art and drawing quite a bit as it is, and it's a strange feeling when I can just sit and draw and have no idea what I'm doing yet it feels so right. I randomly get these burning desires to draw as if there's something I just need to get down on paper, it's weird. I remember once I managed to get a load of gel pens on a come down from MD. It was so strange, I gave each pen a personality, a real persona and they had deep complex feelings and thoughts, both independently and towards the other pens, and I drew with them but as I went along it was like I was telling myself a story, I really should of kept this stuff or wrote down straight after was it was about. But I poured my heart and soul into these pens, it was really really strange. and then the drawing that came out of it was a perfect story in my eyes. To other people it was the scribblings of a man person, but to me it all made sense, and it all meant something. there was meaning and passion behind it. then when I was somewhat sober again it was like, what brought that on? why did I create these little people? xD haha.  The Fibonacci series is interesting also! I remember watching a documentary on it and being mind blown at just how important it is without even realising it, the fact you were drawing it as well, that's strange yet interesting xD especially if you only discovered what it was afterwards. where as you drew the spiral? I remember as a kid and in school, they would always have these random lessons they would just give you paper and tell you to draw, or doodle. and I would sit there and half the page with a line, half that half, half that half... and so on. EXACTLY like on that wiki page! It's mind blowing to me, that there is actually potential that everything that we discover we actually already know on a subconscious level. And drugs can most definitely bring out that subconscious. Atleast that is my opinion xD"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,stefneh5295,2,Sun Feb 16 23:57:20 2014 UTC,"You know, its not often I get to have discussions like this as my friends are not ones to have deep intellectual conversations with, so this is refreshing. I have pretty much mirrored opinions on the social matters you brought up because it does all make sense. I don't see why condemning pointless wars and corruption while hoping for peace, equality, and unity in the world is viewed as a bad stereotype by a lot of people. I'm sure if everyone had experiences like ours, the world would be much different for the better."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1y1k4m,WhatChuuuSay,2,Mon Feb 17 00:17:36 2014 UTC,"Well I would say me to, but in all honesty I don't have any friends any more xD I used to have friends, and for a short while there were pretty treasured to me. I had a few that were on the exact same wavelength as me, we were close, but taking drugs together brung me so much closer to them. MD, obviously the ""love drug"" just made these deep connections with people. But unfortunately I was pretty crushed by the same people, we are all pretty ""depressed"" and somewhat uncompleted people, after a while they chose drugs over friendship, and no matter how much you try to help someone, and be there for them, when they chose a drug over you... couldn't really do that any more :L so I cut myself off from everyone and I've been on my ones ever since then. I don't regret it though, I would rather be on my own then have friends that will take your support and yet leave you hanging when you need them the most. and exactly, that's why people say if there is more intelligent life forms out there, they'd probably take one look at us and run the other way :L Humans just seem to be getting more and more destructive. We are supposed to be the higher intelligence species on this planet yet we do the stupidest things sometimes! xD I've watched documentaries and such on capitalism recent as well and it sank my heart to see how blinded a lot of people are by sheer money and power. Something like 1% of people in the US have more wealth then the rest of the US population combined... what really is the need? how much money does a person need haha. It will buy them material things, sure. But it won't buy them any kind of understanding or knowledge about the true face of the universe and just exactly how it works, all those questions people have in life just through naturally being curious beings, searching and striving for answers... money won't buy you that. And in my opinion, That really is what I want. I would of thought that's something everyone wanted. But it's hard to think so when people would rather collect cars and houses and jewellery then understand themselves and understand why we are here. It genuinely scares me how... blind? people can be. You are definitely right in saying that if everyone experienced what we have, they wouldn't see things the same again. They might actually care about the bigger picture. Care about other people and actually contribute something meaningful to the world. I've read about people that think that there will be a ""end of the world"". Not in the sense of the world blowing up and everyone dying haha xD but rather, everyone ""descending"" to higher plains of thinking. I suppose much like how we feel when we have taken drugs, it changes you for the better and you think about everything differently. and I read this stuff and just thought to myself... It's an insanely ""out there"" idea... but man, would that be amazing. hahaha one can dream I suppose? xD"

I first experienced that during my first pot experience or something similar. I felt disconnected from my body, my vision and perception changed as if I literally died and was looking through life as a higher being.    The exact feeling went away a couple hours but I had : and still do, to a less degree symptoms of depersonalization.   So much so that I hardly know what being my ""old"" self was.    I am 27 this happened when I was 21.    I had no idea about my symptoms until I googled ""feel like I am dreaming"", ""detaches after pot"" etc.    Throughout this journey I have kept up with the little research there is on depersonalization by reading medicine journals, online forums etc.    The symptoms hardly are responsive to medication. However I did come across an article that mentioned the combo of Zoloft and lamictal had some effects on a pilot study.  This research has turned my life around, it made the symptoms lessen, although they do linger.    Sorry, looks like I went a bit on a tangent there!"

It was launched in 1994 by Apple Computer and was marketed for three years before being discontinued in 1997. Three models of the product were built including the 100 and 150, both built by Kodak; and the 200, built by Fujifilm. The QuickTake cameras had a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels maximum (0.3 Mpx). The 200 model is only officially compatible with the Apple Macintosh, while the 100 and 150 model are compatible with both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. Because the QuickTake 200 is almost identical to the Fuji DS-7 or to Samsung's Kenox SSC-350N, Fuji's software for that camera can be used to gain Windows compatibility for the QuickTake 200. Some other software replacements also exist.

I think time travel is one of those things that you have to accept that if it's possible at all, it will have already been done.  Then you just keep an eye out for temporally anomalous sightings in archives, etc.  The thing that I think it very interesting about the Chaplin instance is that no one thought anything of it in all the intervening years between when it was made and when it was discovered a few years ago because no one recognized what the person might be holding.  Today, even a child would recognize that as a mobile phone just by the silouette but no one had a frame of reference from the 1920 until 2010 because mobile weren't like that yet.  My point is, if this is actual footage of a time traveller, how many more might we be looking at today but we don't see them as such because we lack the frame of reference needed to recognize it?"

All he had to say was ""See kelseykiwi, it just goes to show how much time you waste doing that stuff"" cause he hates that I smoke.  I know every step I took from his car to my bedroom, it took me maybe 30 seconds, and I looked at the time as I was sitting down.  There's no way it took me five minutes.

I could not make out his individual words but i just knew it was him (even though i had no reason too; i did not know he was using the radio). anyway, it is very common for radio signals to be picked up on cheap, or even in some cases expensive headphones. The fact that you heard what you heard could just be because the voice was unclear but because it scared you your brain was more open to suggestion. perhaps the the explanation was even simpler and it was some kind of radio play."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1r604w,darkmighty,4,Mon Dec 16 00:25:56 2013 UTC,"I'd say it's a false memory. Definitely different from a dream and not necessarily a conspiracy thing.  It happened to me once when I was ten or so. My family and I had been in Florida for the previous two weeks and, shortly after returning from the (wonderful) trip, I started telling some of my friends a story about something happening to me in Florida.  Everything was fine until my brother heard me tell one of our common friends and he said he couldn't remember anything like that happening at all.  We had a discussion when I tried to provide as many details as possible but he really couldn't recall a minute of the scene, so we just decided it was weird and moved on.  Not long after I was telling the same story to another friend, in the presence of a boy who had already heard it (from me, obviously). He waited for me to finish telling it then told me with the most puzzled expression I've ever seen on a kid that many details from the story had changed since I first told him about it.  That night I asked my parents if they could remember it, they couldn't and I freaked out. I could remember around twenty minutes of something happening in vivid detail, it was actually more detailed than most memories I had from the Florida trip.  It took a few hours but I got over the shock and pieced most of it together: while recalling the trip, I had somehow managed getting mixed up between what were actual memories and what was an unsurprising ten-year-old's daydream.  The thing is, it didn't really work like a memory. Like the time when I tried to make my brother remember it, I was modifying the memory to fit additional details as fast as I could imagine them. The false memory was malleable.   In the end it warped the story enough to become significantly different from the original daydream and, being an easily verifiable memory, I found out about it without too much trouble.  The story itself? I can't tell you about it. Exactly like once I had modified it in my mind I couldn't remember the original version, the realisation of what had happened to me forced me to forget it entirely. In a matter of weeks I couldn't remember a second of the story itself, and anything my brother, parents and friends told me I had said didn't ring a bell.  My point is that false memories are more common than we believe they are, especially among children's minds, only we rarely find out how much we have lied to ourselves. This is an explanation for how you came to remember seeing hoverboards for sale at Target.  How did your ex-boyfriend reach the same memory? As I said, a false memory can be instantly replaced by new details and make you believe it had always been that way. Telling him about your version of it may have changed a related false memory of his, until you had pretty much the same.  I just find this explanation more rational and likely than an actual glitch in reality. Our brains are far from being perfect, such complexity implies many glitches as well. If you've read all of this then thank you for your attention and I hope I have helped.  Also, sorry for being 18 days late..."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1putf5,itsmikeydalton,6,Mon Nov 4 04:25:39 2013 UTC,"I have something similar without the tragedies at the end. Whenever I'm under extreme duress, I usually get moments and remember experiencing key details and trains of thought. I guess mine can be pretty traumatizing in their own way."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1putf5,Nostalgia_Drive,6,Mon Nov 4 10:21:45 2013 UTC,"When I was younger, I used to have these experiences often. ""Tragedies"" were sometimes small things like a kid in my 2nd grade class dropping his pencil box. But sometimes there were big tragedies like driving through heavy traffic and the car in front, adjacent to the (US) front passenger's side flipping, causing multiple-car pile ups. Whenever I would feel the deja-vu, I'd remember how the tragedy happened in my dreams, then pretty much brace for it -- but it would never come. What I came to realize is that the deja-vu isn't necessarily a premonition of the future, as much as it is a premonition of the thoughts I'm going to have at that particular moment in time. There's no telling when that moment will come, or if I'll even remember it before it comes. But the one thing that is always constant is the feeling of familiarity and occasionally the feeling of impending... something. I used to find myself completely freaking out over my deja-vu when I was younger. The deja-vu moments always seemed to come at times in my life when I was about to make a choice, or in the middle of a conversation, sending me into a minor sort of panic attack. These days, I've become quite calm about it, and have tried to use them as ""check points"" to tell me that I'm on track for whatever life I may or may not have planned before I incarnated here."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1putf5,ohheyimluke,3,Mon Nov 4 16:03:00 2013 UTC,"""What I came to realize is that the deja-vu isn't necessarily a premonition of the future, as much as it is a premonition of the thoughts I'm going to have at that particular moment in time.""  You put it best. When I get this, I see things with my own eyes for a few seconds, but what sticks with me the most is my thoughts and feelings in that moment. I can recall sitting in high school band class wondering when a lecture will end, years before I even saw the room. Most other times it's a glimpse of anything really, followed by a few quick words, like ""man, that really didn't work out"", etc."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1putf5,GrantH527,2,Sat Nov 30 07:08:06 2013 UTC,"I experience the same thing, several times a month. I usually change what I am doing when I have the experience specifically to avert whatever tragedy I feel is going to happen.   It bothers me because I swear I dreamt it before but I can't remember when and I'm aware of how easily we can trick ourselves. I've settled into the idea that it's just a mindfuck rather than premonition but I'm still compelled to change the events."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1ntk7t,cujolemons,18,Sun Oct 6 06:36:31 2013 UTC,"Ok back from work :-) Ok basically sleep consist of different phases of sleep, one of these phases are are REM sleep aka dream sleeping. When you monitor a sleeping person with an EEG, its hard to tell wether a person is sleeping or dreaming. This is because the EEG pattern is almost the same, because the brain is very active during this phase of sleeping. There are ways to differentiate between the wake stage and the dream stage one of these are look a eye movement - REM sleep stands for rapid eye movement sleep. Another way is to look at the muscle tone in the body, because you are actually paralyzed during REM sleep, which is a defense mechanism, preventing you from living out your dream. There are people who don't have this ""break"", who then live out their dream, which in worst case scenarios can result in killing you bed partner - which has happened.  Well back to the hypnagogic hallucination which you experienced - as I said this can be provoked by either lack of sleep or medication. It's hard to explain what it is, but some say it is the brain being sub conscious, like waking up during the dream. A classic hypnagogic hallucination is the feeling where you wake up, and you are not able to move - sleep paralysis. The temporally paralysis is not most scary thing about this situation, the most scary thing are the shadow people - I tried this myself. imagine this you wake during the night - you are not able to move, and you thing to yourself - Am I dead? and then you see a shadow walking towards you from the door opening - this is fucking scary. And you try your best to wake up, but when you wake up - you wake in another dream it feels like it is impossible to wake up from this nightmare.  Some experts actually think that ghost stories and people reporting seeing these shadow people during the night are actually just experiencing sleep paralysis or hypnagogic hallucinations.  If you experience these sleep paralysis on a regular basis please see your doctor, because Sleep paralysis can be associated with a number of sleep diseases, including narcolepsy.  Personally my worst case of sleep paralysis were on board of a plane, where i had it during the flight, and kept dreaming that we were crashing down. Scared shitless I tried my best to wake up, but nothing worked until i suddenly jumped up in the air, resulting in my head smashing in the overhead compartment.

Before we moved in, I was playing in the completely empty house with my mom. I threw a small ball into an open closet area and when I went to get it, it was gone. She saw me throw it and goes into the closet to look for it, but she couldn't find it either.   This was a completely empty house, finished, with no holes or openings to lose anything in. We hadn't even started moving our stuff in. We spent half an hour debating where on earth the ball ended up and another hour throwing other things into the closet to try and recreate the disappearance.  We never found the ball.

After tearing up the kitchen looking for it (I have young kids) and getting berated by my wife I had run out of plausible places.  I then realised there was this minute crack between the oven and the cupboard next to it. I laughingly said (to my fuming wife) it must have bounced off the floor and orientated just right to fit in this gap that i could barely fit a piece of paper in.  Anyway, it must have obviously been a million to 1 shot because after pulling out the oven, there it was. No idea how it even fit through."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1ntpm9,Urabutln,5,Sun Oct 6 05:45:15 2013 UTC,"This is, weirdly, not impossible. Every time some object collides with a barrier, some of the particles in the atoms of that object will ""borrow"" energy from their future selves (I know, but yeah) and pass right through the barrier. Net result is nothing, since stuff will just snap back together. BUT: if every single particle in every atom in every molecule (or even just a large majority) in an object decided to borrow energy at the SAME TIME, the WHOLE object would just teleport through the barrier. This is incredibly unlikely, but NOT impossible. It s my go-to excuse when I miss the ball in sports, anyway.  About that Lego ship though, it sounds like you jumped realities..."

But there are lots of things that don't make sense. Why did some of the ship break off? I explained away finding the pieces in my closet as they might have bounced in there, but in the garage? The matrix part comes from the pieces that crossed the barrier portal thing disappearing and my mom retaining no memory of it.   I should add the wing pieces that didn't cross or that were in my closet did not vanish, but were lost to time."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1ntpm9,alphawuff91,2,Sun Oct 6 05:42:25 2013 UTC,"OK, I realize your post is almost two weeks old, but probably you won't mind my speculation. It seems that you might have been ""sharing space"" with a counterpart in a nearby dimension. My belief is that consciousness only exists in one instance at a time, and somehow your consciousness was bouncing back and forth between two dimensions without realizing what was happening (aside from the warbling wall-portal—perhaps the defect in dimensional fabric?)  So in one dimension, your mom took you to Target to buy you the Lego set, and that's why you have the memory. But in the other dimension, she didn't take you, and that's why she doesn't have the memory nor physical evidence (the receipt). Somehow you were later able to go back to the Lego dimension and find the pieces in the garage (maybe there's a hole in the wall in ""that place""), but later you traveled back and the Lego set vanished again, as it was a product of another place.   My question is: do you still have the two pieces of Lego? What did your mom say that you two did together, if you didn't actually go to Target? Anyway, hang onto those Lego bricks… they are literally out of this world."

I don't think it specifically mentioned the sky as a surface this phenomenon could occur but since it is expansive-giving it the appearance of being flat- and all one color, it fits all the criteria.

It doesnt mean time changes to 10:06 whenever I look at a clock, it means your brain actively filters out non-useful information, and ""usefulness"" can be subjective because it associates memories with emotions.

Time lost phenomenon is world-wide and has been recorded for ages. I believe they happen and are real.   My BF and I had a lost time experience last year. We do smoke but not this night. We are night owls and game a lot. We were taking a break just browsing the internet on our separate PCs. It was roughly 4:15am. Suddenly, it said 4:40am on my clock. I felt a quick rush of anxiety and my head felt dizzy. Before I could say anything to my BF, he asked did 20 mins of time just go by?!?! We were spooked, to say the least.

The man was right, the two of you don't need each other anymore.  I've had it happen hundreds of times, in my case the live person verified we were meeting in dreams. Why did it happen?  There's a number of different explanations, karmic connection from other lifetimes to a glitch in the matrix, who knows.  How did it happen?  Good question--but if you think of all this as just one ""energy ball,"" so to speak, space and time being just ""one"" thing, then a concept like ""currents and eddies"" makes running into someone from another time period or place somewhat more possible.  In any case, it interesting to think about.  The point now is that you're safe, and that's it's unlikely you'll run into her again.  I'd say that you and your Dad do think about things in the same way, and the fact that your brothers rejected the man in the dream is just your subconscious' way of telling you that your brothers don't have this propensity."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1mryco,thedraindeimo,4,Sun Sep 29 14:54:55 2013 UTC,"This will be long. My best friend, call him T, passed almost four years ago in march. It was a car accident. 75 miles an hour on a back road, on a ""victory lap"" for getting with a beautiful girl. This kid was the most loved member of our friend group, and even our town, a woodsman, an adventure leader, an all around stellar person. there were over 600 people at his funeral.   A few months prior we were all hanging out a mutual friends house and T was on mushrooms, we're on the porch and talking and shit, and all of a sudden he goes white as a ghost and passes out with his eyes open. We wake him up, the girls are screaming, its a shit show, he passes out again. Repeat. Hes finally up, we get him some fresh fruit and talk, he says he doesnt remember anything.   A few weeks later he and I are driving together and he starts talking about it. He said that when he was out he was a disembodied spirit and he knew then that he could ""go anywhere, and do anything"" and he told me ""come march, im gonna leave, and you might not see me again, im not going to make a big deal out of it, so i just wanted to let you know now."" I laughed and shrugged it off. In the next later months he started doing a lot of LSD and mushrooms, and getting really into ""The Secret,"" if youve heard of that fucking book. I became more and more detached from that set of friends, because i'd done my time with psychedelics and didn't care to do them again, but we were still really close.  Sometime in the winter, I had a dream in which me, T, and a mutual friend, B, were walking down a snowy, beautiful road, just bullshitting and smoking cigarettes, when T just runs off into the woods, as he often did, and me and B start talking about what life would be like without him, if he actually left, what would change, what would stay the same, it got pretty damn serious. I woke up went ""that was odd"" and went about my day.  Fast forward to march. A shitty time in my town. For whatever reason, bad things happen in march here. And remember, T said he would be leaving in march. A bunch of us including, him and B are at a buddy's house. T is there with a girl, teaching her how to play pool. We're all drinking whisky and carrying on, having a great fucking time. At one point we're outside and T is so happy that hes literally doing cartwheels around the yard. We go back inside and he sits down next to me with his nalgene water bottle in his hands, with 5 stickers on it. He says ""do you know why I have these stickers on my water bottle?"" I say no. He says ""these are the 5 things you need in life"" and he explains why. I remember one was a flashlight, one was a canoe, but i cannot for the life of me remember the rest. I wish I could. I start laughing and shit and he gets really damn serious about it and says that I fucking have to pay attention. It freaked me out a little bit, so I payed attention.  T, another friend, and T's girl leave. Me and B and the homeowner are still hanging out, drinking and watching a movie. 40 minutes goes by, and we hear the sirens. We think ""someones having a bad day, the homies are definitely home by now, but just in case lets call them"" no answer from either. Fuck. Again. Nope. Fuck. Ok. Drive to his house and see if his car is there. No. Fuck. He must have stayed at his girls house...nothing we can do except go to bed.  Woke up the next morning to the most painful phone call of my life. The bastard made good on his promise, he bounced when he said he would bounce.   I dreamt about him a lot after that. We all did. Some of us had the same dreams. Some were just bullshit dreams, and some were definitely him. The circumstances leading up to it were very strange, and after my dream in the woods with B, I knew it would happen, deep down, and it makes less and less sense as the years go on, but I guess that's just the way of the world.   I like to think that the sonofabitch is just off on the next adventure, and we'll meet past the next bend in the river."

On this basis, an old friend of mine calculated that at a Roullette Table, if 11 diferent numbers are drawn over 11 consecutive spins, there's a 95% chance that the 12th spin will be one of the previous 11. We put it to the test a few years ago and actually won some nice beer money, of course, he hadn't factored in the 0 or double 0 which completely fucked up the system, however my point is, sometimes, these things aren't as unlikely to occur as they may at first seem. Although, you'd need to speak to someone who actually has a clue about maths, they'd possibly explain it better. Still, that would freak me out too, nice glitch."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1m077p,MistaJinx,4,Wed Sep 11 00:11:25 2013 UTC,"Its 100% possible. Its not that humans can't breathe water. Its that its too heavy. Think about it, in womb, you breathe amniotic fluid so its not that its a liquid. Water has plenty of oxygen. The diaphragm is too weak to push the water out of the lungs. Also, there is a part of the brain that controls how much of our strength we can use subconsciously. We don't think about lifting a car off of someone when adrenaline hits and that's part of it. So in theory, you could've not been thinking about it and just been able to do it. Then when you retried it you thought about the possibility of not being able to do it.   Also, that may be why when someone is drowning, this doesn't happen. It could be fear and the thought of I need air or I die."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1lv8k9,Thessilonius,2,Wed Sep 11 07:32:59 2013 UTC,"I got that with The Simpsons all the time! My theory is: we retain some residual knowledge of the sequence these shows are shown on TV schedules, usually their 'proper' order. If we see episode 5 of Season 3, we probably subconsciously remember bits from Episode 6.  Then, the following day, or week, the network puts on the show in the same order we last seen it.   Of course, that wouldn't explain it happening with shows we haven't even seen for months or years, then think of a scene from the day or hour before it comes on TV, or appears on DVD as we walk into a friend's house, etc."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1lv8k9,jimijokk,5,Tue Oct 1 18:49:56 2013 UTC,"I used to have this happen a great deal in my late teens and all through my twenties. As I started getting older the frequency has slowed down quite a bit. Now that I'm past forty it still happens, but it is much more rare.  Here's how I view it:   Everyone has heard the whole 'reality is made up of infinite universes all spun off from one another by every decision we make or everything that happens in the world' theory.  I think this is incorrect, I feel that everything can POTENTIALLY happen by choice or chance, and then those things are limited down by situational probability based on universal constants etc.  Picture reality like a large tree, barren of leaves. Each decision we make or random event in the world is a probability wave collapsing into a certainty. From the smallest branches, to larger branches, all merging toward the trunk.   The trunk is the most probable event and is what actually takes place in reality.   I think some of us can feel those probability waves collapsing when they're close to becoming reality, and we therefore see a few minutes into the future at random. Or 'feel' a few minutes into it.   With me it's been generally small things. One time I opened my door coming home and knew the light would burn out before I turned it on. Another time while sitting in slow traffic I had a tremendous sense of danger ahead and minutes later one car tried to pull into another lane causing an accident. A myriad of things like that."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1lv8k9,dbenson81,1 point,Mon Sep 9 12:50:17 2013 UTC,"A weird thing that happens with me when I'm DJing at home, recording a mix, is that I'll think of a place while a particular song is on, then a long time later I'll have the mix on in a vehicle and will find myself at the place I was thinking of when that song is playing on the mix. I have thought there's maybe a self-fulfilling prophecy thing going on with it(It could be I'm directing myself towards the place), but it happens when I'm being driven by other people to a destination of their choosing.  It also happens with people, I think of them when a song is on and the next time I hear it, I'm with them.   At one point, every time I played 'Can U Feel It' by Fingers, inc, I thought of my boss and, even weirder, every time I played 'Acid Trax' by Phuture, I would think of her husband, who I had never even met. Fast forward a year or so, and I bump into them both at a boat party where the guest of honour is Larry Heard, aka 'Fingers, inc'.     Later that night I went to an after party with them and I got on the decks to play a couple of songs, then my boss's husband went on immediately after me and played 'Acid Trax'! Very bizarre.  A couple of times, when I was a kid(I would never sing out loud now! :)  ) I started singing a song and the person with me asked 'How did you know I was thinking of that song'!!!!  It's probably all coincidence, but it definitely makes one wonder if things like the Universal Mind or some kind of a Morphogenetic Field for all consciousness exist."

I woke up before my alarm & saw it was 6:30, so I decided to get up 15 mins early and go ahead & hop in the shower to get ready for school. It was winter, so it was still dark outside that early. I took a long leisurely shower, excited to have gotten up early and not be rushing to get ready. After my shower, I walked in my room & was surprised to see that the first signs of dawn hadn't started showing through the window yet. I looked at my digital clock, and then saw that it was only 3:30am!!! But I swear that when I got up I saw the clock say 6:30... I felt like I had traveled back in time!!!"

GlitchInTheMatrix,1lbgdy,portrayaloflife,12,Fri Aug 30 06:04:38 2013 UTC,I have heard of moviemakers broadcasting movies on unused channels after selecting a panel from the public. They are asked to watch a tv pilot or movie at a certain time on a certain channel and then fill out a questionnaire or take a phone poll about it.    The general public isn't aware of the broadcast but might stumble upon it on their own.
GlitchInTheMatrix,1lbgdy,Schly,5,Fri Aug 30 06:44:33 2013 UTC,"This may have happened back before VCR's and such, but nowadays?  I can't imagine any movie company - much less a big one - doing something like this.  Everyone records everything.  They risk millions in lost ticket sales."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1kaerv,Chitowngaming,12,Tue Aug 13 20:07:31 2013 UTC,You know that scientists are discovering more and more evidence that points to our reality being a simulation.
GlitchInTheMatrix,1kaerv,Clever-username-,7,Wed Aug 14 13:34:53 2013 UTC,"But if our reality is indeed a simulation, how are we discovering it? How can those contained within something, something with the express purpose of not allowing us to know of its existence and is therefore in at least minor control of our lives, allowing us to know that it exists?"
GlitchInTheMatrix,1kaerv,Chitowngaming,3,Wed Aug 21 04:37:18 2013 UTC,"Here is one of many articles.  In fact, this theory has been kicked around since the time of Plato.  TLDR; if the universe is a simulation then at some point the energy of the universe should hit some sort of cap, like Truman finding the wall in the movie.    Silas Beane from the University of Bonn and colleagues have calculated, in a paper published in arXiv that as cosmic particles fly through the universe, they lose energy and change direction and spread out across a spectrum of energy values. There's a known limit to how much energy those particles have, though, and Beane and his colleagues have calculated that this seemingly arbitrary cliff in the spectrum is consistent with the kind of boundary that you'd find if there was an underlying lattice governing the limits of a simulator."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1kaerv,Clever-username-,4,Wed Aug 21 10:47:47 2013 UTC,"Even then, what is this ""simulator"" simulating. Are you implying that there's another similar universe ""outside"" the simulation and if so, what is the purpose of a simulation, or virtual re-enactment? Is the theory that we are trapped in a simulation or a virtual reality?  It just seems as though we are scientifically comparing this ""simulation"" to the modern simulations we have today, with our culture which is obviously far less advanced that any capable of creating a simulation as complex as our world but we still expect this ""simulation"" to modern virtual limits."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1kaerv,Chitowngaming,2,Wed Aug 21 12:19:07 2013 UTC,"Read the article, I am not implying anything, take from it what you will and read up on it further if it interests you.    With that said-When we create, albeit minute particles, it creates a lattice that holds a system together.  Take this to a scale the size of your body or the universe and that remains true.  So when cosmic rays were observed hitting the same kind of lattice and capping out at certain energy levels, cosmic rays that should be limitless in energy by the way, it points to a possible simulation.  The article goes over all of that."

Morning rolls around and my gf literally walks through the mancave and right by the couch to let the dog out and consequently back in before she head off to work.

Take a picture just as someone walks past you, and they are mostly on one side of the shot (Picture 1 in the example I am giving you)  Step 3. Then take a picture after they have walked into the distance and shuffled their bags around a bit. (Picture 2 in the example I am giving you)  Step 4. Then take a picture of a second or 'third' person walking in the distance (Picture 3 in the example I am giving you)  Step 5. Splice the 3 images together, neater than I have done, on the blue lines in the example I am giving you.  Step 6.

I'll tell you in advance that I don't have an answer to what happened but would like to hear your thoughts. It's all true and a major puzzle to me.  Our top loading washing machine is in the basement, it's a nice basement not a dark, spooky place. The room has bright lights and because it's in the basement there is no way to enter this room from outside the house. Okay, here we go At least a half dozen times in the past year I've gone done to put the wash into the dryer after the washing time should have long elapsed. Imagine my surprise to find the wash not finished and the top cover/lid of the washing machine up. The fact that the lid is up means that the washing cycle has not been completed. Each time I just scratched my head and wondered how this could happen.  Just the other day it happened again. This time as I went back into the wash room I switched on the light and looked to see the top up once again. But this time I heard something move in the room. It was the sound like a dog would make if you woke him from sleeping and he bounced up, we don't have any pets. The hair on my arms went straight up as I looked around the room but I never found anything."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1hbvg3,AnonymousTurker,6,Sat Jun 29 22:27:52 2013 UTC,You actually looked around the room? You brave soul.   The lid being open would probably be enough for me to nope right on outta there.
GlitchInTheMatrix,1hbvg3,TLema,4,Thu Jul 18 15:23:41 2013 UTC,"That sounds exactly like what I experienced.  No noise though, though I am usually playing music pretty loud.  I have experienced other ghostly things recently in my house though.  For example, I've heard loud crashing sounds at night, like my bike fell over on the wood floor.  I've been alone in the house when I heard it to.  Weird stuff."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1hbvg3,TheTuzz,6,Sun Jun 30 03:35:12 2013 UTC,Are you sure you remembered to put the lid down in the first place?
GlitchInTheMatrix,1hbvg3,jsiemian,3,Sun Jun 30 14:21:31 2013 UTC,"Yes, because it was mid cycle when it was opened.  My clothes were soaked because it didn't go through the spin cycle."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1hbvg3,Liverbones,5,Mon Jul 1 05:11:06 2013 UTC,"Lid was left open.   Start the load. Fill it up. Forget to close the lid. Clothes are all wet and the wash cycle never begins. It's a safety mechanism in the washer. It can't spin with the lid open. People do this all the time.   Next time you are 100% sure you closed the lid, put something on top of the washer (e.g. Laundry basket).   It won't happen ever again."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1hbvg3,Curiouscrispy,2,Wed Jul 10 11:32:27 2013 UTC,"The thing is that the dial was already at the spin cycle, which means it had been going for a while.

GlitchInTheMatrix,1cdpxs,SisterDino,3,Tue Apr 16 01:10:55 2013 UTC,"A similar thing happened to my dad. He grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada before leaving prior to his senior year of high school to live in Los Angeles, California. He had a good friend while in Vancouver with bright reddish orange hair and a distinctive walk. Soon after graduating high school in 1968, he enlisted in the US Navy and went to Vietnam and all over the pacific for a number of years working as an aircraft mechanic and loadmaster. Some time in the late 70's or early 80's he was on deployment and his aircraft carrier pulled into Hong Kong for a port call. My dad went and his buddies went for some beer in the expat area of Soho. While walking down the street he sees a guy with the familiar walk and distinctive reddish orange hair walking ahead of him. He runs up to the guy and sure enough, it was his friend from Vancouver BC. His friend was working in the banking industry and living in Hong Kong for a year or two. He had a couple beers with the guy, then parted ways and my dad hasn't seen him since."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1cdpxs,Australian_Translate,3,Tue Apr 16 02:06:10 2013 UTC,"When I was a little girl I used to go to Absegami Lake every summer with my mom and siblings. It was a campground lake with a playground, trails, and a food stand. When I was 8 I was playing with these boys and my siblings. We would play wrestling and race in the water. One of the boys slipped under water and drowned. It was so sad and frightening. We didn't go back the next summer and we started going to the beach with my aunt and her kids.   Fast forward to last year I took my husband back there while driving around my area checking out damage from Hurricane Sandy. Out of towners call it Bass River, New Gretna Lake, Egg Harbor River and there are a few other names. He says to me, I've been here before! My cousin drowned when I was ten after wrestling with these white kids (he's black). I met my husband when I was 8 and if not for that horrible tragedy we would probably not even remember!"

GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,LinZ14,27,Tue Apr 2 13:22:57 2013 UTC,"Deja vu's are actually easy to explain. Basically your short term memory is fucking up. You are watching something, your memory is placing it in the right part of your brain, but also simultaneously recalling it. That's why there's a little 'lag' on it and feels fresh at the same time."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,Darkstar1756,7,Wed Apr 3 12:50:57 2013 UTC,"Exactly. There are a couple of other ways that deja vu can be experienced too, including subliminally - experiencing something subliminally because your focus is elsewhere before experiencing it consciously just moments later. Here's a good detailed description of how it works."

He had predictive dreams and approached it with the mind of a scientist, preempted string theory and quantum theory to establish the concept of split dimensions of consciousness.   It sounds hocus pocus, mumbo jumbo, but it's fairly well respected. Also the third time I've referred people to this book on reddit in as many days - everyone's having predictive dreams all of a sudden."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,CrazyTillItHurts,3,Tue Apr 2 22:36:02 2013 UTC,well honestly i wouldnt have said anything except i have been reading a lot of things on reddit about people having them and im like thats happened to me before.
GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,jack134,2,Tue Apr 2 23:00:26 2013 UTC,"Yes I've heard of this in one of my college classes from a Professor. Basically there's like a constant rhythm to everything if you will, like a pulse that was once in synchronicity with everything. I forget how or what but it eventually was misaligned (so they think). When you experience Deja Vu it's like a part of the rhythm is reconnecting with you for a moment."

GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,Cellophane7,3,Wed Jun 19 22:58:09 2013 UTC,"Same here, it's like at random moments during the day or while dreaming I get this sort of ridiculously specific vision of a future event, either at a place I know or a place I haven't even been to yet, and then I remember it although not consciously and when it occurs, a long time after the vision, it hits me an instant before it occurs. It freaks me out, it happens so often. For example, I remember having had dream about staring at an airplane during a sunset while swimming in my uncle's swimming pool in the US when I still lived in Venezuela and then about a year later, after moving to the US, I experienced the exact same scenario..."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,Taiytoes,6,Wed Apr 3 12:15:39 2013 UTC,"When you dream, you are firing off memories that you may or may not be able to retrieve while conscious. Your logic bit in your brain ties all of these random firings together into a somewhat coherent situation. It is your brains way of evaluating what you know and putting it into random scenarios as like a ""practice run"". You will inevitably dream about things you will do, places you have heard about, even if you consciously can't recall them."
GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,SubtlePineapple,7,Tue Apr 2 14:01:20 2013 UTC,but i remember dreams about specific conversations. word for word. thats what usually makes me remember my dream is someone saying a sentence. word for word what i dreamt
GlitchInTheMatrix,1bigb8,ReginaPhilangie,1 point,Tue Apr 2 14:34:05 2013 UTC,"the problem is that you recall the vision after it happens. you see something then you recall it as something you seen before. try writing down your next vivid vision before it will happen. then when it happens you can be sure you see it first and not assume you did. your memory might be playing tricks here, registering something new as something older."

It's kinda hard to explain, it's almost like I feel my actions/thoughts for the next 10-15 seconds are preplanned or scripted. Not that I'm out of control of myself, but like I'm stumbling down a hill and have a hard time slowing myself if I tried. I could break it off if I wanted.

It might be improbable that the water in the trough contained a starfish larvae but doesn't seem impossible. Where does the water come from? Oh or maybe it came from rain. The larvae was swept up by storm winds or something and rained into the trough. Far fetched but who knows.

It was green/brown, covered in moss, squishy, and obviously dead. It was also a watering trough in the middle of our ranch.

She was confused and stated we did have school. That night, a freak storm came in and flooded the entire city. We didn't have school that week.   I woke up 5 minutes before the calls came in that my grandmother, then grandfather had died.   I had nightmares about a tidal wave for a few days before the big Indian/Indonesian tsunami. I kept telling my family and when it happened, every just stared at me and wouldn't talk to me.

GlitchInTheMatrix,1a3cfp,HazratMahdie,2,Wed Mar 27 14:49:24 2013 UTC,Earthquakes are separated into two different types of waves. P and S waves. It's not uncommon to experience both quakes minutes apart from each other.

GlitchInTheMatrix,190fx4,juicydeucy,15,Thu Jan 9 07:37:50 2014 UTC,"It's not a glitch. It's called patter recognition. DO you remember all the other times where you've seen the clock at 7.32? or at 1.44? No, because you don't take note of it. It's safe to say you look at the clock more than once a day. You don't recall all those other times because those numbers are not significant to you. You always realize you look at the clock at 11.34 because those numbers are significant (but only to you). You take note every time you see it. So the next time you see it, you're gonna think ""damn it, there it is again."" But when you look at the clock at 6.30PM, you say nothing or don't even take note because 630 means nothing to you. I'm sure you've seen the clock showing different times more than you actually see it at 11.34. As for it spelling 'hell' upside down on a digital clock - this  is probably why you find those numbers so significant."

GlitchInTheMatrix,18s9l2,larzi,27,Tue Feb 19 00:21:32 2013 UTC,It is because you remember it and look out for it. You always look at the clock but don't really process the time in your head just its relevance to what you have in your day. Every ten times you come across 11 and go OH MY GOD ITS 11 AGAIN as if it was the first time you looked at the clock this whole time but it wasn't. It was just the only time you catch yourself looking at the clock. This is very common.

I see something happen, involving people or places I don't know, and years later it will happen for real. I've never tried to change it though. It usually doesn't involve me anyways, I'm always an observer. The only time that it mattered, I was at my grandparents shop. It had a small rock waterfall and pond thing. Not large, but about 4 feet deep. I had a waking dream, long before they ever bought this shop, about a little girl tripping and falling headfirst into the pond. She had wandered away from her parents or whatever - no one was around. The weird part was that during the vision, it showed me first, and I could hear the conversation that I was having. It then zoomed away from me and around the building to where the pond was. So I have this vision, didn't get it (I was like... six or seven at the time of the vision) and so just ignored it. Then, about two years later, I was visiting my grandparent's new shop. I was talking to them and then for whatever reason I just took off in a dead run to the pond. It was the same convo as the vision, word for word although I didn't really process why I was running at the time. As I rounded the corner I saw the little girl trip and fall head first into the pond. She was only about three. I pulled her out and she was fine, barely enough time to panic. It was hella weird. Only time that has happened to me. I've remembered it ever since.   Oh and they put a fence up to keep customers out of the back area where the pond was."

So basically a new experience that should be getting written into short term memory is instead crossed over into the long term memory, so it feels like you've done it before. It's one of several theories that kinda makes sense to me. Still trips me out though.   Dont know about any of you, but any déjà vu involving ""the phone is going to ring"" just hasn't panned out. I swore the phone would ring but it never did."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,AgentOmega,8,Mon Feb 18 16:28:42 2013 UTC,"That would be a good explanation, if it wasn't that I had deja vu about places I had never been and people I had never met. Those dreams are so strange that when I wake up I clearly remember and ask myself what was going on, only discovering the context months or years later. So it's not just a vague sensation that something already happened, it's the clear memory of the dream I had, that sometime can span forward several seconds in time."

Like, once, I was being chased by this gigantic panda ( it's weird, I know. ) and it was about to kill me, and I just remembered that I could stop a dream and just closed my eyes, and opened my real eyes. I wake up then.  That's how I usually wake up from a dream, and I didn't know how I knew how to do that before, but it just came naturally to me."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,Hiraldo,3,Thu Oct 17 13:42:16 2013 UTC,"Different people have different ways of inducing it, but one that comes to mind is my friend's way:  Periodically throughout the day question yourself if you are dreaming or not. By habitually asking yourself this, your brain will ask during your dreams. Then when it comes to being in your dream you can answer saying, ""Actually, yes I am dreaming."" I don't remember what he told me about staying in lucid dreaming, but usually the dreamer becomes overly excited and wakes themselves up."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,MagTron14,2,Wed Jul 24 11:26:35 2013 UTC,"Really interesting idea, I'll have to try it. Thanks for the info."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,shutitshelby,1 point,Wed Jul 24 22:35:21 2013 UTC,"Definitely be careful about the getting over excited thing. When you realize you're dreaming you will become aware of your actual surroundings, so you have to try to maintain the dream or you'll just end up awake. The first three or four times I was aware I was dreaming I simply woke up after a very short period of time, it took a little to be able to keep myself in the dream."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,auburnstark,3,Thu Aug 1 19:34:26 2013 UTC,"Be careful about lucid dreaming. I have ISP, or Isolated Sleep Paralysis, and I know when people try to trigger an OOBE, or an Out of Body Experience, or a lucid dream, they fall into ISP. I've been afflicted since before I can remember and it's not fun at all. Honestly, I'd rather just not try having a lucid dream at all because the risks are too high."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,Stibemies,1 point,Mon Jul 29 21:36:49 2013 UTC,I have experienced that here and there and my attempts at lucid dreaming got ugly because of it. One tip I was given by someone who has experimented with lucid dreaming for years was to draw something on your body so that you know you're dreaming if it isn't there. My subconscious is a huge dick so when it got weird and I tried to see if I was awake or not OF COURSE the elaborate drawing I'd placed on my left foot was there and then I began to panic and realized I couldn't move...   It was rough shit. Do not recommend.
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,SchroedingersHat,1 point,Sat Aug 10 20:48:58 2013 UTC,"I sometimes get deja-vus exactly like other posters in this thread. This one time I noticed that it was going to happen, and I remembered in the dream I had asked someone a question. I thought I was pretty clever when I decided not to ask it, but regretted a minute later when I thought about the universe-destroying consequences of me not asking the question. I've had them before, but after that I decided I would write it down if it ever happened, but I haven't been seeing much dreams since, so no chance yet. I can kind of understand how the scientists say it works, but it still feels very weird to me, since to me it has always been true that I could see into future(I've had deja-vus like that all my life, though not after the one in this post)."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,SchroedingersHat,2,Wed Jul 24 12:00:37 2013 UTC,"Memory is surprisingly malleable. I have had similar impressions in the past, but not once have I been able to write down ahead of time something that actually came to pass in enough detail that it wasn't ambiguous or mistakable for a more likely event or general class of likely events.  Try this, then you can know for sure whether it is just your mind playing tricks on you."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,essiejayne,2,Wed Jul 24 09:33:22 2013 UTC,"Well, the problems with writing down what happens in a dream are:  1) I usually don't know beforehand if the dream is just brain garbage, or a deja vu. Only when it happens in reality I connect the dots.  2) My deja vus aren't about important and meaningful stuff. Usually are brief (5-10 secs) pieces of a moment in the future. We spend 95% of our lives doing trivial tasks or having unimportant conversations. If you take 10 secs of a conversation out of context they look meaningless.  Only living through that moment again grants me the context to interpret those seconds."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,yourmommo,0,Sun Jul 28 13:05:22 2013 UTC,In that case it sounds just like everyone else's deja vu which has nothing to do with predicting the future and everything to do with your brain playing shenanigans.

(also some weird images of dogs, and stairs). It was so vivid that I when I woke up I immediatly called my mother to tell her about it, and then went to spend the morning with my Ouma. After I had gone back home, my Aunt called me to say my Ouma had died about 30 minutes after I had left her. (I had nothing to do with it, I promise!)  So anyway. Hello 5 month old post!"

I'm talking like I was 4 or 5 years old. I knew these things happened to me but it really freaked me out that something I had reoccurring dreams about from 10ish years ago actually came true.

About a week or so later, a terrorist attack occurred (can't remember all the details) in which a bomb was exploded on a plane killing everyone onboard, raining bodies down. 2. Slightly less dark and scary. He said he also used to dream about a NASCAR series in which trucks were used instead of cars, and after a while this became real in what is now the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series."

GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,Amaryllis_Versis,2,Sun Jul 28 13:06:51 2013 UTC,"Same boat here. It started when I was around 13. I would have the odd dream that I would wake up in the middle of. Sure enough, the exact same event would unfold before my very eyes at some point in the future. At first I thought it was cool. I never told anyone except a family member. Who would believe such a crazy story? As I got older, it became more frequent. I remember a specific time during University where I had 6 or 7 events in one day. It was getting annoying. On top of that, it was starting to get difficult to separate a silly dream from a potential event. I dreamt of a catastrophic experience, which felt like a dream...but was it a déjà vu? I still deal with a certain stupid phobia. Which dream was going to happen and which was just a figment of my imagination? I never knew. Because each dream is so bizarre and you have no reference to draw on when you are talking about future events. Unless you are dreaming of flying like Superman, it's tough to know a bogus dream from something coming down the pipe.  And how do you bring it up to someone...""Hey, I'm struggling with something, and to prove it, I'll recite exactly what you are about to do and say.""   I remember going to see a psychic as a student. My friends were freaked out by her so I decided to go and check out the B.S. Of course, having these crazy dreams, I was always intrigued by this type of mysterious profession. The hacks and scammers. The very first thing she said to me before we even sat down was ""You think you have the power. But get over it"". She blew my mind.  That was 15 years ago. It maybe happens once a year now. I have gotten over trying to figure out why and what and how. But it had significant impact on my perception of reality as I was growing up. And no one can tell me, or anyone who has had this shit, that there is a logical explanation for it in brain chemistry."

GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,Lord_Kogav,2,Thu Jun 20 15:09:06 2013 UTC,I don't believe that much in the supernatural but I myself had deja-vu dreams from 5 to about 13 years old. They were always very short though and never had conversation. One I remember specifically was some sort of vine/staff thing with a carving on it in some room. The next day I went to my friend's house who I had never visited before. He had the same room and the staff that he made was laying in the same spot. I really don't know how to explain those things.
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,lipslikemarylin,2,Wed Jul 24 09:11:41 2013 UTC,"I've had these sorts of experiences for most of my life. The most vivid are also the most mundane. When I was seven or eight years old, I dreamt of walking into K-Mart with my mom, and there was a man with  an odd hat walking out. A few months later, there was the man with the hat. That sounds so dull as I type it out. I work at a museum now, and years before I had even considered applying there, I dreamt of having a conversation with some girl I had never met in an office I'd never been in, where some old guy walked in to talk to me. And then, years later, that dream-memory is triggered by a certain sequence of words, and I know the old guy (my boss) is going to walk in.   Alright. Now let's get to the cool stuff. I can relate to the dual deja-vu's. I had pneumonia last year and it went on for months, getting pretty bad where I couldn't breathe. My doctor prescribed me a narcotic cough syrup, saying it was the greatest thing ever. It was, but for none of the reasons he cited.   The first couple days were fine. I could breathe. By the third day, and into the seventeenth, I was high all day every day. I didn't eat or drink much water, so I lost 10 pounds in a week and was constantly tired. But the dreams—oh the dreams were so vivid. I experienced that dual timeline deja-vu thing.  In one particular dream, I was in some sort of dome amphitheater, that kind of looked like that Chinese Olympics birdcage thing. There were hundreds of people inside, and we were waiting for something. Then it exploded. Not sure if it was a bomb or fire, but I died. You're supposed to wake up when you die in dreams. Well that didn't happen. I stayed dead. I could see the people investigating the incident, poking my body. I was looking through my eyes but also through the eyes of the other people.  Then it reset.  I went through the dream again, but that time nothing happened. Everything went on as usual, and it was one of strangest dream experiences I've had.   I also dreamt of watching the beginning and end of the universe, simultaneously. One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. All of creation and destruction at once.   Semi-relatedly, I've had a recurring dream that's always the same since I've been a kid. So this has been going strong for close to 20 years. Goes like this.  I'm standing in a line that zig-zags and stretches on toward a sign, that's like one of those ticker signs at train stations or airports, that tells you about destinations. There are trains all over the place, crossing through the line as they go...somewhere. I usually get hit by one of these trains as I inch forward in the line. When I was high on that syrupy gravel, I made it to the front of the line. When the other people got to the front, they read the sign and got onto whatever train they were supposed to be on. But the sign made no sense to me. It was in a language I couldn't read, just a bunch of numbers and letters and characters randomly assembled, like a code. A fast-moving code, because it was constantly changing, and when the letters and numbers got to the top of the board, they would float off into the dark ""sky"" above me, as bright glowing colors.   Which reminds me. When I was going through withdrawals after that month of being high, every person I saw or tried to interact with glowed in a different color or pattern. Also one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. The glowing said something about the character of the person. It was a flickering glow, as if at any moment, it would go out and the person would cease to be. As if we're in constant flux between two incompatible places."
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,troll_trollingsworth,2,Sat Jul 27 02:47:39 2013 UTC,"i have experienced this as well. the parallel probability lines in time always exist, it is the direction of your consciousness to observe them that gives them reality to you subjectively. all time is simultaneous, it is the limitations on perception which cause the experience of time. you are experiencing time freedom, because you are aware of the 2nd dimension of time, allowing you movement between parallel lines of causality"
GlitchInTheMatrix,18qxnt,xILubez,2,Sat Jul 27 08:33:27 2013 UTC,"I've had similar dreams. Although probably because I've been at school most of my life, they usually happened in that environment. Most of them were vague enough to be dismissed as just deja-vu feelings, but some of them amazed me enough to stick.  Particularly, once I dreamt I was walking down my school's hall, coming back from phys. ed. class and I just randomly looked at some classmate and said precisely ""I know what you did last saturday night."", and she simply answered ""Oh, I watched [some movie whose title I shamefully forgot a few years ago - was it 'Pirates of the Caribbean' something? I think it had Johnny Depp in it]"".  I say random things like that at random times, but that specific situation had never happened to me before (usually people dismiss me when I get too random) and I really didn't recognize that classmate's face (which at first I thought was because, well, that part of my brain was turned off in my sleep) so that dream kind of persisted in my memory for a while.  So, next year, some new classmates got into my school and at first I didn't pay much attention to them. But at some point, when I had stopped thinking about that dream, I befriended one of them and one day I was coming back from P.E. and, without realizing what I was doing, I randomly said to her ""I know what you did last saturday night."" and surprisingly she gave me the exact same answer as in my dream. At first I just felt a very strong deja-vu, but it didn't take long for me to remember the dream and I froze speechless until the teacher started to worry about me and I got moving. After that moment I felt like the face in the dream was really hers, but that I can't vow for.  So sometimes I dream about people I don't know and I usually remember those dreams because of that peculiarity (and usually I do get to meet that person afterwards). But sometimes I get strong deja-vu feelings without remembering a specific dream (and once I even had what seemed like a deja-vu of a deja-vu of a dream of a deja-vu - very crazy feeling). And sometimes I meet someone and I feel very strongly that I have seen that person somewhere before (that happened almost everyday while I was studying at Harvard Summer School and meeting tons of different people from around the globe). But most of the times my dreams are fantasy, although they seem to happen in the same consistent - I even drew a map of it! - world/landscape that's partially based on reality (but that has crazy stuff like a shopping center that connects to every ""city"" in the dreamworld, like a yggdrasil tree, and islands where some natural disaster happens all the time).  Probably because of such interesting dreams I had had, when I watched Inception I suddenly became avid for lucid dreaming. So I did some research online, memorized the usual experiments (trying to turn the light on and off, with and without a physical switch, and crossing over a mirror) and went to sleep trying to conduct myself towards a lucid dream. Well, I suppose it sort of worked, since I felt very lucid in the dream and suddenly began to ask myself whether or not I was dreaming. I even asked some people crazy (although very ""me"") questions like ""Am I dreaming?"". All I got were nasty looks and one or another ""Of course not!"". I tried to read stuff on the walls and found myself capable of doing so, and I decided, for once, that it was definitely not a dream. And that seemed true until I actually woke up and realized the irony.  But then, a few days later in another realistic dream I did realize I was dreaming, but just the knowledge seemed to make it unstable somehow, ready to collapse and force me to wake up. Still, I actually successfully performed both lightning experiments and managed to cross a mirror I found myself capable of summoning on any wall. The other side of the ""portal"" was literally the same room, but as soon as I arrived there the people jumped at me and, well, killed me. It was actually kind of scary, since they happened to be my parents.  Ever since I had a few other successful attempts to manipulate dreams, but I found that the more I manipulate stuff directly, the more the dream citizens seem to hate and want to kill me. Still, it's priceless to be a god of a world. And I found out that if I focus, I can keep a greatly detailed memory of the dream, although it makes me wake up tired and usually makes the dream likely to collapse. Once I pushed my memory so hard that I ended up being sucked (by a vortex in the sea) to what I think of as my Subconscience, which was like an unfinished, raw and dilapidated concrete hallway of doors, each leading to a memory (I know because I opened one and found myself in a very early, very vivid childhood memory of my old apartment, but I immediately panicked and walked back - never mix dreams with memories, it's the fastest route to insanity!), that had no ceiling (just some ominous, cold white, indirect light where it should be) and a doorless room with lots of Harry Potter's magic beans scattered over the floor, and somehow I knew each one represented someone I knew. It's been a while since my last experience, but I suppose that's a busy college life with no time for dreams for you.  Anyway, back into topic, I suppose, I do get ""memories"" from alternate realities as well, but it's not from dreams. It's usually stuff I remember as if they were true, very strongly, like playing a nice 2D MMORPG a few years back, and then I go look for evidence and I realize they never could have happened (there's no MMORPG like the one you remember, just a very, very worse one, not called Maple but MapleStory, that has crappy graphics and crappier gameplay - and no spear as the main weapon of the game).  I suspect I cross timelines whenever I have strong migraines, because every time that happens I feel afterwards as if the world got slightly different somehow (that might be just me being paranoid, but sometimes it even feels like someone is changing it towards some large scale goal, but it could be that I am traveling towards it, IDK).  It also makes me shiver whenever I read some book or watch some series/movie about alternate realities (and I have been doing that with increasing frequency) and find out they had very similar ideas to the ones I had independently. Sometimes I wonder if even some of my fantasy dreams (most likely the futuristic ones about space pioneering) are not actually alternate realities or futures of sorts, because once in a while I find authors that describe them in their stories with great similarity - and I'm sure I had never heard of their work.  Well, I could go on talking about this sort of stuff for hours, but TL;DR, right? The last thing is that my mother says once she dreamt of her distant aunt saying goodbye to her and the next day her mother got the news that she had died."

I was driving home late from work and noticed a lot of lights, trucks, and people next to the woods at the edge of a baseball field. It turns out to be a movie being filmed. Standing around they ask me to be an extra. During some scene where I am supposed to just be in the background, I say something to the two main characters conversing. They decided to edit the script and I would be background guy who says a few one liners throughout the movie. It is a low budget movie so everyone is carted around to filming locations via large yellow school bus. The next morning we end up on scene on some 2 lane road going through miles of woods. One of the actresses feels sick so we film what we can. The next day The actress is gone but half of everyone is just as sick as she was. Over the next few days out find out there was some nerve gas released into the air by a Chinese spy plane, which caused the infected to go mad and kill everyone around them before dying a few days later. So after running, hiding, evading, it is only apparently me and Steve Bushemi left. We break into an empty bank in an office complex and find our way up to the top floor of the building... and old storage attic. We are tired, hungry, and going a little mad.  Steve Bushemi starts talking to his dead mother on a phone which clearly has the wire torn from the phone base. Obviously he is mad from all of the goings on. You can hear the infected pounding on the reinforced door. Steve Bushemi tells his mother ""Hold on, someone is pounding on the door""... and walks over and opens it.

My bedtime was around 7:30 or 8, all year around, so during the summer it was still daylight for awhile when I went to bed. One night, I was laying in bed, looking out the nearby window. I was not at all sleepy, I remember this was what I was thinking. I decided to try and close my eyes any way. To my astonishment, after a brief moment of laying there with closed eyes, I open them and its morning. Not sunrise even, it's 8-9 in the morning. ~12 hours passed in almost the literal blink of an eye. I had no sensation of any time having passed whatsoever.

I would lay in bed awake and rambunctious as a child and do random things just to avoid having to sleep. One night I asked my dad to get me a glass of water. As he left to get it, I curled myself into an unnatural shape with my face pressed into the blanket and counted to ten. When I looked up again, the sun was coming up, even though it had been 8 PM just a few seconds ago. I went to my parents room and woke them up asking what had happened, but my dad said that when he came back into the room I was fast asleep--but I clearly remember counting to ten without any interruption.

When I was maybe 9-10 years old, I stayed at a hotel on the way to some random family vacation of some sort. Some of the lights in the hotel were still on, as my parents hadnt gone to sleep. I figured I'd take off my watch, et it on the bedside table, set my gameboy there, then pass out. I se tthe stuff down, got in bed, and just close my eyes and reopened them like a blink that lasts about half a second. When my eyes were open, it was morning and I was stunned at what exactly happened.

GlitchInTheMatrix,177a9o,gaiseric,2,Thu Jan 24 18:21:28 2013 UTC,"A few years ago, I took care of my great-grandparents in their home 24/7. After 2 years, my great-grandpa finally passed on. Everybody in my immediate family was in the room with him when he passed. Here's 3 of our stories:  1) My story: my bedroom at my great-grandparents' house was a guest bedroom in the basement. It was a split-level house, meaning that there's 2 small sets of stairs. This is important. Well it was a normal night, I had plugged in my phone charger next to the bed, as well as a ""noise maker"" that was in every bedroom. I woke up in the middle of the night FREEZING. I mean, the coldness actually woke me up. I had a space heater (unplugged) across the room, but decided to just go back to sleep. I wake up a while later, and I'm so hot that I'm sweating. I wake up, look over, and see the same space heater plugged in, right beside me, on full blast. The only other people in the house were my aunt (who has MS) and my great-grandma (who has polio). Both of them have to use the stair lift just to get down the stairs, and it is EXTREMELY loud. And naturally, they both looked at me like I was crazy when I asked them if they had done it...  2) My sisters story: my sister just recently moved in with my mom (who now lives in my great-grandparents house, since my great-grandma got admitted to the nursing home). She always complained of my mom's ""no junk food"" rule. My mom wouldn't allow any sweets or anything in the house since they were ""dieting"". My sister comes home one day, opens her bedroom door & finds a perfect pile of jelly beans laying in the center of her bed. My great-grandpa was notorious for his sweet tooth. Nobody else had been home all day, and there were no wrappers or any other evidence in the trash cans.   3) My mom's story: my mom was cooking in the kitchen shortly after she had moved into my great-grandparents house. Her boyfriend was upstairs in the bedroom, watching TV. My mom started walking into the dining room to put plates on the table, and she said that she felt a hand shove her out of the way. She said she could feel the heat & individual fingers. Looked around & she was still the only person downstairs.   4) My mom's boyfriend (bonus story!) : my mom's boyfriend (who is a complete skeptic, and actually disregarded the last 3 stories) was sitting in their bedroom upstairs. He was at his computer & heard something fall off their dresser. He went over to pick up the object off the floor. As he stood up to place it back on the dresser, everything came flying off towards him, as if ""someone had taken their hand and knocked it across everything"". My mom came upstairs when she heard him screaming & said he was completely white in the face.   TL;DR: everyone who watched my great-grandpa die has had creepy stuff happen to them. More specifically, things he was famous for"

GlitchInTheMatrix,14j3vv,JohnnyJizzum,14,Mon Feb 18 18:53:24 2013 UTC,"This actually very easily explainable, as one commenter has already alluded to: your parents are just very shitty at hide-and-go-seek. Why? Because your brain will sometimes just ""see"" what it expects to see, regardless of what is actually before it. This has been demonstrated scientifically in numerous ways. If you do a youtube search, you can see examples, like this TV special where they hired an actor holding a map to ask a random person on a city street for directions. The actor will be, say, a large black man. Then they'll have other actors pass between the two of them carrying a large mattress or something. During this split moment where the two can't see each other, a different actor will come in to replace the black man, holding the same map- only the new actor will be a skinny blond woman. The vast majority of random people didn't even notice, and continued telling directions as if nothing had happened.  As for my own case in point: an actual game of hide-and-go-seek.  I was playing with my sister when I was a teen, and she was hiding in the left-most, near corner of her room, with nothing obstructing the view. For some reason, I thought this was a stupid place to hide, so I just kind of walked in and did a once-over on her room. According to her, I looked right at her, but it didn't register in my brain for some reason. She had to stop herself from laughing and almost got up. Instead, I just turned around and walked out, continuing my search. Hope that helps. edit- clarity"

GlitchInTheMatrix,14j3vv,anotheronelikethis,52,Wed May 8 14:36:10 2013 UTC,"You should read ""The Threat"" by Dr. David Jacobs. He is a psychologist that uses hypnosis therapy to help people remember what happened in events very similar to this one. People disappear for a few hours or sometimes a day or two and return with no memory of what happened. After hypnosis they relive what actually happened and it turns out they were abducted by aliens. This would also explain the metal detector thing as many people said the aliens put an ""implant"" way up their nose into their skull.   Unfortunately, whenever someone brings up aliens/UFOs, they are immediately labeled as a ""kook"" by most people. I'm not saying that you were definitely abducted, and I'm not even saying that I 100% believe aliens exist, but I do think it's worth an intelligent investigation. Completely assuming blindly that aliens do not exist is a very non scientific and frankly illogical stance IMO"

GlitchInTheMatrix,14j3vv,anotheronelikethis,17,Wed Jan 16 16:51:51 2013 UTC,"Completely assuming blindly that aliens do not exist is a very non scientific and frankly illogical stance IMO   Seems like more of a grasping at straws defense of your beliefs, which you claim not to believe, which sounds a bit weird, but whatever.  Point is, most science-minded people don't do that. If aliens exist, somebody would have to posit they exist (obviously, many have). If someone posits something extraordinary exists, they must provide extraordinary evidence.   There is no extraordinary evidence that aliens regularly visit Earth, abduct people, and leave alien technology in them. Specifically, the plate idea/ ""an implant way up their nose into their skull"" would be pretty good evidence. Nothing like this has been found, except implanted by human doctors.  So, in summation: ""completely assuming blindly that aliens do not exist"" and ""severely doubting an extraordinary claim without sufficient evidence to support it"" are entirely different things."
GlitchInTheMatrix,14j3vv,Luckyyo,2,Mon Feb 18 18:45:45 2013 UTC,"Fair enough.  I am not saying that I 100% believe in aliens, I am just saying that I don't doubt the possibility of their existence.  Believing in aliens is never a very popular stance, however there are significantly many instances of unexplainable occurances relating to UFOs and UFO sightings to warrant some investigation.  Most professionals will not touch the topic with a ten foot pole, because of the fact that they are almost immediately laughed at and are not taken seriously from then on out.  This results in a large absence of reliable research on the topic. I respect David Jacobs for facing this.  If you actually read some of his work, he is not some kook trying to scare people, he is a very well educated man that took on the task of doing serious research into the UFO phenomenon.  I don't claim to know if aliens exist or not, however I do think there is enough evidence and unexplained events surrounding them to make it very difficult for anyone that has actually looked into it to ""severely doubt"" their existence."

Basically, if even one civilization could ever have reached the point of running simulations, then it would be likely they could run an astronomical number of them, perhaps dwarfing the number of real civilizations. In that case, assuming it is logically possible that we are in fact a simulation (I am skeptical), then it is reasonable to conclude that we are more likely to be a simulation than 'real'."

GlitchInTheMatrix,ysles,Annie42,19,Mon Aug 27 00:37:35 2012 UTC,"If this is genuine clairvoyance , you possess a power no human has ever been proved to have.   Keep a notebook by your bed, and write down details of your dreams, as accurately and thoroughly as you can. Draw pictures if possible. If what you describe then happens, you can see the future. Or, possibly, it's entirely random and you're just joining two similar, arbitrary things in a moment which feels like realisation.   Or, of course, if what you write down doesn't happen, it's just déjà vou. This is caused by a brain miscategorising an event as a 'threat' instead of 'normal thing that's happening' so it takes on strange significance. Usually happens when you're tired or sick, and the brain is malfunctioning.   Interestingly, attributing wrong or over-significance to things, strange feelings or sensations, hallucinations, or repeated dejavou in general, are some of the many mental symptoms of epilepsy - which mostly plagues sufferers with these sort of strange mental affect, and only gives 20% of sufferers actuall convulsive, twitching-on-floor seizures.

Mine are dreams but not so much clear (but has improved slightly) except for bits and mostly it's during my sleeping so its more a memory upon waking. I'll say, gee, I wonder why I dreamed Amy saying that? Then I'll be at a dinner 3 weeks later, she'll be talking and say what I saw. The thing is, it started out very déjà vu. It was boring stuff, seeing a scene or someone do something, but not their face or where I'm at. I began to state 'I want to see more relevant information', like who's talking and what's said. Then it's slowly evolved to this. It's not frequent, but its definitely become more significant in amount and clarity of info.  It's cool, but not a superpower...yet. And despite the nay Sayers, I don't think this is memory manipulation. I think you, me and others are seeing 'it' as well as 'it' is happening. Not one influencing the other.

GlitchInTheMatrix,ysles,tomcatfish,2,Thu Nov 1 01:37:03 2012 UTC,"what might be happening (and a simple down to earth rational explanation for deja vu) is misplaced memories. So the event happens and the part of your brain thats assigned to process it and rate its relevance (forget now, forget in two minutes, begin long term assimilation) misfires and wires it back to you 6 months before right after waking up or whatever.  From your position it seems like precognizance/ deja vu, but its really just your subjective perception of reality playing tricks on you.  A dream journal would clarify things, also if you had the event journaled and you could bust it out right after the event, it would totally make the other person / people involved flip out."

GlitchInTheMatrix,ybaxm,dochdaswars,2,Thu Aug 23 05:30:14 2012 UTC,very true. but i most certainly flicked that switch just once into the on position.

Maybe you have a weird electric glitch too?"

GlitchInTheMatrix,vvhtb,ObscureSaint,32,Sun Jul 1 09:59:05 2012 UTC,"I would say your story is similar to when I skydived. They called it ""sensory overload"".  I was hanging from the wing of the plane, very excited (not really scared, more curious what free fall would feel like) and then the next thing I knew, the parachute had opened and I was gliding.  It was a static-line jump, which means there's a rip-cord tied to the airplane that rips your parachute out for you so you don't have to. It's about 100 feet long and is the way to guarantee that newbies can have their chute deployed automatically.  Essentially, I blacked out about 3-8 seconds. I don't actually remember letting go. My guess is you had subconscience alarms going off which started your adrenaline rush early, triggering ""sensory overload"" before the incident hit."
GlitchInTheMatrix,vvhtb,MALON,13,Sun Jul 1 19:09:02 2012 UTC,"I've been thinking about this, and I wonder: did you black out for 3-8 seconds, or was there just some lag while ""the system"" tried to load the next zone for your freefall?"
GlitchInTheMatrix,vvhtb,T0xicati0N,8,Sun Aug 26 17:41:56 2012 UTC,"You black it out. I have tons of lacking memories just because of overload. Or let's rather say..I don't have 'em. It's something different, if your brain ""lags"", say: can't work. You wouldn't have been able to catch your dad then. You'd've just stood there, staring at your dad, while he fell. If your brain's logged off, it is logged off, you're done, just standing and watching. But you had a rush of adrenaline, sensing danger and adrenaline is a helluva drug. I'm actually a quite soft dude, but when this fucker once made me flip I somehow lifted him up. Can't even remember it. He just suddenly was up in the air and back down on the ground, flat out, another missing memory to me. Adrenaline does a lot of funky stuff to you and it's proven (lmgtfy, if you like, I guess the paper my professor once gave out in class, wherever the fuck it is, won't be proof enough to you?) that your brain shuts down everything unnecessary until the whatever dangerous thing is done happening, if shit's going down. That dude right there pointing his gun at you? Bam, you're under the table, fuck how did you get there? You don't know, but you're safe. No thinking, no detailed memory logging, but a ton of higher physical response to threats. We become machines in situations of angst."

GlitchInTheMatrix,vvhtb,BosskHogg,11,Tue Feb 12 02:07:26 2013 UTC,"Wow! Amazing story!  I would chalk this up to adrenaline. It goes hand in hand with the classic ""mom lifts car to save her child story."". It's amazing what the human body is capable of doing. Seems like everyone was in the right place at the right time!    Glad to hear you and your dad are ok!"
GlitchInTheMatrix,vvhtb,SonOfSatan,7,Sun Jul 1 16:27:11 2012 UTC,"You just blacked out from the stress, that's a common occurance. The adrenaline gave you the strength to catch your dad, and your body just acted out on reflex, that's why you were screaming at him when you were concious, and didn't even realise it was you screaming. And I'm guessing your dad is about 6 foot (you could be unwittingly exaggerating the distance) and considering he fell backward, if you were cradling his head when you came to, you would've been the length of his body away from where you were initially standing."

So each day for a week me and my two friends with me would wake up to said alarm, I would wake up but be still laying in bed we'd talk and discuss things but everyday I would be looking at something then a sort of black flash or fast blink would go by and I'd wake up and only remember looking at the one spot and I'd still was continuing to look at that certain spot."
