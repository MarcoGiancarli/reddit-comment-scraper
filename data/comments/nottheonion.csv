He therefore stays and pushes the buttons at that exact time on that exact day, the shuffling has been unique since the guy stayed on and would have been a very exact mix schedule of billions of bounces over months and months with the other guy.

nottheonion,3e2edi,Timmyty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"There used to be a lot of fraud with tickets in Canada. But it's 2015 now and there are a lot of preventative measures in place:  1) Tickets are required to be signed by the customer before they are allowed to be scanned. They use mystery shoppers to make sure retailers follow protocol.  2) After tickets are checked, they are to be returned back to the customer along with the validation slip. The validation slip shows the entire serial # of the ticket and will say how much the ticket won ($0, $5, etc).  3) Terminals are equipped with ""self-checker"" units now where a customer can scan their own tickets and it will tell them how much they won.  4) Any store selling lottery tickets would most likely have video surveillance. The lottery corporations know the exact time each ticket was purchased and can ask for proof of video surveillance for said time. They also ask every winner of $1,000+ where/when they purchased and checked their tickets. If there are doubts, they could even ask for proof of purchase (if they don't to start with). As most people these days pay using debit/credit, these can be tracked back to the actual person who purchased the ticket (and why I ALWAYS pay by card rather than cash for lottery). There was even a winner out west that went unclaimed and they tracked her down through her payment method.  5) Retailers are supposed to use a ""retailer play"" option on the terminal which labels tickets purchased as a retailer play.   That's just a few of the big ones. Yes, fraud still probably happens. But it's much more unlikely these days as it was years ago. I know a few locations in my city that lost their lottery terminal by not following the rules."

We were largely unharmed, but we were sent to the hospital as a precaution. I got released first, and while I was waiting for them to finish tests on my buddy I got hungry. The cafeteria was closed so I went to the gas station next door to buy a few things. I had a few dollars cash left over so I bought one of those scratch-offs. I ended up winning $100K off it. After taxes, I had about $60K to spend. Unfortunately, I don't have any left, because fortunately, I used it to pay off my student loans and double-pay my mortgage for 2 years. But--my mortgage is all the debt I have left and it's almost paid off, so I'm not complaining."

nottheonion,3dxylu,w0mpum,116,Mon Jul 20 17:07:57 2015 UTC,"I think the author is counting on their audience not understanding Chinese culture as they try to sprinkle fairy dust over the ending.  Making a big deal about him having a copy of the story of the stone (also known as dream of the red chamber, or hongloumeng, 红楼梦) is pretty absurd. That novel is probably in the personal library of every chinese person who pretends to be educated, and is a story familiar to everyone from childhood through its many tv adapations and such. Wow, criminal had copy of one of the most popular novels in existence, must be some deeper meaning there.  Also, the quotation of the opening line is a pretty tortured reading. The author of the novel is making a very specific point about the origin of his book, and I really don't see how anyone could translate it even close to the way the journalists here did: 作者自云曾歷過一番夢幻之後，故將真事隱去，而借「通靈」說此《石頭記》一書也，故曰「甄士隱」云云。但書中所記何事何人？自己又云：今風塵碌碌，一事無成，忽念及當日所有之女子，一一細考較去，覺其行止見識皆出我之上，我堂堂鬚眉，誠不若彼裙釵。 The translation is so distorted I wasn't even sure it was of the opening line, the only resemblance seems to be the word illusion appears...  It's really not ok to misquote things and make all sorts of unjustified implications just to write a more dramatic article. Bad journalism.  EDIT: On the general theme represented by this article of ""don't piss off your Chinese girlfriend or she will make sure you go to jail"" there is also the interesting trend of angry mistresses getting their powerful official lovers arrested by revealing their corruption. One article here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ji-yingnan-and-other-jilted-mistresses-expose-chinese-officials-corruption/2013/07/25/8d8d35f6-eb02-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html"

nottheonion,3dxylu,man_gomer_lot,6,Mon Jul 20 22:08:39 2015 UTC,"Very possible. Westerners constantly make too much of random little things they know about China, drawing all sorts of odd implications. There was a highly reviewed book a few years back from a PhD in linguistics who had lived in China: http://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Chinese-Mandarin-Lessons-Language/dp/0802779131 . She discovered that tone determines the meaning of words in Chinese, and then spends most of a chapter talking about how hard it was to explain to Chinese people that tone is used to convey emotion in English, how she tried to explain it to many of her Chinese friends, and how they can't grasp that concept because tone is so tied to meaning in their minds.  Except tone is also used to convey meaning in Chinese, in a pretty analogous way (ie, a general lifting of tone on the last few words of a sentence for a question, a falling for a statement, similar things for anger, etc). One wonders how she got herself so confused.  Then there's all the random published books where someone uses the random experience they had on a train to extrapolate some grand theory of China..."

nottheonion,3dwny9,RicePaddySquatter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"Southern States seceding was not the cause of the war.  Not by a long shot.  The south didn't secede to violently oppose the north, they did it to peacefully separate from a government they didn't agree with (whether they were right or wrong is another discussion).  Southern States seceded, formed a confederacy, and immediately moved to send delegates to form peace treaties and open trade between the two nations.  The president at the time, James Buchanan, threw them out.  After Lincoln's inauguration he maintained the same stance towards the Confederacy, but acknowledged the individual states as separate governments (states had considerably more autonomy back then, and were more akin to the organization of the EU now than the US' current status).  While all of this was happening, the state of South Carolina (not the confederacy) was attempting to remove Union troops from it's territory, offering them free passage out of the state.  The Union gave explicit orders to those troops not to abandon their post and to fight to the death - prior to hostilities starting.  The official start of the war was caused by Confederate troops firing on Union troops at Ft Sumter, whom were informed prior to bombardment because the Confederate commander really just wanted them to leave peacefully, as the Union Commander was a long time friend of his.  Hostilities broke out at Ft Sumter because President Lincoln refused to remove troops from South Carolina, and the Confederate government gave the order to remove the union by force.  Both sides bear equal responsibility for the start of the war itself - and it had nothing to do with slavery.  Secession and formation of the Confederacy were due to slavery.  Initiation of hostilities was not.  In no speech made by Lincoln, in no official declaration by the Union government, was slavery ever mentioned as cause for war.  In fact, it was never even mentioned until Lincoln's famous Antietam address (granted abolition of slavery was part of the Republican party platform, and that party's victory without winning a single southern state sparked the secession).  Keeping the states united, however, was frequently mentioned - Lincoln even threatened those states that had seceded in his inaugural address, using the line ""Shall it be peace, or the sword?""

In my family I have a relative that fought in nearly every conflict in US history to include the revolutionary war, and the civil war. My great uncle fought in Vietnam, my Grandpa served in Korea, my cousin and myself both served in Afghanistan.  I'm a son of the revolution and a son of the confederacy. I fully acknowledge that the war was started because of slavery. Abraham's plan to ban slave practices in frontier states would have led to the slow natural death of slavery in the US, and that would mean huge economic damage for the South. The fact that he was elected despite not receiving even one vote in any southern state just sparked the war. The south felt like they had no voice with the federal government.   The man who went and fought for his state probably didn't give two flying fucks about the politics or states rights or slavery. He fought for his state, he fought alongside his brothers and friends. He gave blood sweat and tears for his friends to his left and his right. When I went off to war I was just some 18 year old kid who didn't know shit about the geopolitical situation that the world was in and I doubt my ancestor did either. He gave part of himself for his family and the people around him.  I'm proud of what my family did. I'm proud I get to have that connection to history.

The man is my favorite president and I'm very happy he won, but how can you not understand how it would make southerners feel when he was elected without anyone in the south wanting him president? Not one god damn vote. They had literally no say in who was elected.    states do not have the right to just pick and up leave if they don't like the president   Well, at the time they kind of did. That was part of the argument of cession. They weren't originally a single nation, but a bunch of colonies united. United States if you will. The end of the Civil War and Lincolns brilliant handling of the conflict is what turned the states into a unified country.    I'd be interested to see if Lincoln received no votes in the south if slaves were given voting representation alongside their land owning masters.   Every slave could have had the right to vote and he still would have gotten none. That's how ballots work. And I think it's a ridiculous question to begin with. I already know slavery was bad, I already am glad the south lost, I already am happy that for the most part slavery has been nearly entirely eliminated.    You seem to romanticize the past as fighting for something great but the ugly truth is this was a fight over owning human beings as property and I'd sooner kill myself then kill others in the name of that fight.

You are calling for history to be forgotten. You can't forget the bad and only remember the good. You have to acknowledge them both. They flag never once flew over a state that had legal slavery. The American flag however did, so it's insane to tell me what it represents. You're trying to tell me I can't be happy to be a southerner or be happy that I'm a son of the confederacy and you could not be more wrong. It's like me trying to tell you not to be proud of a single world war two vet because of the horrible crimes committed on the Japanese Americans. You have to remember the past and remember the mistakes or else you may be doomed to repeat them, but that doesn't mean you sweep the entire thing under the rug.   You can't take something and say it represents slavery when that could not be further from the truth.    only to be viewed in proper context.    But your context is somehow more valid than my context? You can be happy your side lost the war, happy a terrible thing came to an end, and still proud to be a part of a defining moment in our nations past.  You know what, let's play this your way. The 13th amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865. This freed all slaves in the Union. Slaves were all already free in the south as of January 1, 1863. This means the Union had legal slavery for nearly 3 years after the South. THE UNION REPRESENTS SLAVERY! IF YOU SALUTE THE US FLAG YOU ARE A RACIST! YOU CAN NOT BE PROUD OF A FLAG THAT FLEW OVER SLAVE STATES! LOOK AT PROPER CONTEXT!  I'm here misrepresenting facts, and telling people how to look at the past, what fun. It's impossible to say the confederate flag represents crimes if you don't also accept that ever symbol of every nation and every people throughout all of history and the entire future of humanity also represents every crime committed by the people for whom it represents."

They could have men in Atlanta when Georgia seceded; that wouldn't make him not in another country. They can say it's owned by the federal government, but it's not their land if the state it's in is not yours anymore.  Have you read much on it? Robert Anderson left For Moultrie, and secretly relocated to Fort Sumter, on his own account, not on a superiors orders. His keeping the fort with those some 128 men was what sparked the ""South""'s attack, after they repeatedly asked him to leave their land. He went there to provide defense under an attack that probably wouldn't have come, but in that relocation, he provoked the War Between the States.    I'm going to quote this long thing here.   LINDA: The United States is just that - a union of states, sovereign states. We each entered the union as sovereign states and as sovereign states we can secede from it.  JOHN: Every state surrendered the right to leave the Union when it joined the Union in the first place. The Constitution was written in the name of the people of the United States. One people - one nation. Not a group of states thinking and acting like independent countries. That idea went out with the Articles of Confederation.  LINDA: Still, each state has the right to make its own laws for what goes on inside its own borders. The laws of your states up North are no better than our state laws down South, in the eyes of the Constitution.  JOHN: When it comes to slavery, you're wrong. Your slave system violates the very principles that made us a nation in the first place.  LINDA: Now you may not like slavery, but that has nothing to do with the law or the Constitution. Our law says slaves are property - not citizens, and the Supreme Court ruled that there in nothing unconstitutional about that.  JOHN: To its shame…  LINDA: Well, in this Union you say we can't secede from - the people of every state must respect and protect the laws of the others. We Southerners don't get any respect or protection from you in the North. When our slaves run away, you try to hide them or block our right to take them back.  JOHN: Look, most of us in the North believe slavery is evil, and we will do everything we can to stop it from spreading at least in our own states. If you come North to catch a runaway slave, we're going to make you prove that you have the right person. We're going to help her go to court and to try to prove that she's free - you consider that ""interference"" in your affairs. Well, maybe we can't get rid of slavery in the South, but you would turn us into slave catchers in our own states. We won't do it.  LINDA: You say you only want to limit slavery to where it already exists, but now you've elected President Lincoln who comes right out and says that he wants to put slavery ""on the road to extinction.""  JOHN: The federal government should have the power - and I would say it has the moral duty - to ban slavery wherever it can.  LINDA: Not when the Supreme Court says it can't. You're so righteous about slavery being wrong, but we have the Constitution on our side. We're breaking no law, but it's obvious that you are not going to leave us alone to live as law-abiding Americans.  JOHN: The Northern States can't just sit by any longer and let slavery destroy the freedom our nation stands for.  LINDA: And the Southern States can't remain in the union when other states are bent on destroying our free way of life. It's suicide.  JOHN: You’ve got it backwards. Remaining a Union is the only way for freedom to survive.  LINDA: Why don't you just take your idea of freedom and go your way, and let me secede and go mine? Maybe that way we'll all survive.   That's probably basically how it all went down.  Also:   President James Buchanan gave a different voice—one much more accommodating to the views of the secessionists and the 'slave' states—in the midst of the pre-War secession crisis. In his final State of the Union address to Congress, on December 3, 1860, he acknowledged his view that the South, ""after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union""; but he also drew his apocalyptic vision of the results to be expected from secession:  ""In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy, it must be on the principle that the Federal Government is a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties. If this be so, the Confederacy [here referring to the existing Union] is a rope of sand, to be penetrated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the States. In this manner our thirty-three States may resolve themselves into as many petty, jarring, and hostile republics, each one retiring from the Union without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such a course. By this process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments in a few weeks which cost our forefathers many years of toil, privation, and blood to establish.""   Also, people may argue that slavery is immoral, and people have the right to be free, to live how they wish. Following that logic, aren't we all, as states, slaves to the federal government, then and now? We can't secede, our rights as people and states have diminished, all to end slavery, which was almost definitely, if not definitely, going to end on its own within the end of the century."
nottheonion,3dwny9,someuglydude,8,Mon Jul 20 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"This is the same drivel we've been hearing for a hundred years now.  The fundamental problem you are completely ignoring is what constitutes 'their land' is totally subjective.  The border states were literally split in two, between those that wished to stay in the union and those that wished to leave.  Violence was inevitable.  The southern states raised an army months before Fort Sumpter.  The confederacy knew that succession would almost certainly result in violence.  People had been killing each other for years in the western territories merely over the conflict of the states being free or slave.  Plenty of forts were given up by the Union without a fight.  Plenty of forts in or near the south had not yet been given up.  There are a thousand places of disputed territory between the north and the south that could have resulted in a violent confrontation even if the north left Fort Sumpter.   Also, people may argue that slavery is immoral, and people have the right to be free, to live how they wish. Following that logic, aren't we all, as states, slaves to the federal government, then and now? We can't secede, our rights as people and states have diminished, all to end slavery, which was almost definitely, if not definitely, going to end on its own within the end of the century.   Just stop dude.  The CSA government trampled all over the idea of individual liberties.  Do you think the confederacy respected the rights of it's citizens who wished to remain in the union?  Do you think they took a democratic vote on it?  Do you think they hesitated to use violence against the communities in the south that had no wish to secede?  The rich plantation class in the south started the war, and they cared very little about the best interests of the poor men at the bottom who would die fighting it.  Slavery would not have died a natural death.  There were more slaves in the south in 1860 than at any other time.  The war was fought over the expansion of slavery into the western territories.  Lincoln and the northern politicians greatest wish was for slavery to die a natural death.  The confederates fought an entire war to prevent that natural death from happening."

nottheonion,3dwny9,ReducedToRubble,3,Mon Jul 20 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Sherman destroyed property. While it's true that, as in every war, there were individuals who took it upon themselves to do heinous acts, it was by no means a mandate to the march or a direct order. That's a myth perpetrated by the southern revisionist history that is desperate to paint themselves as the victims of northern aggression.  The South has received surrender terms that were of tremendous leniency. To suggest that the Southerners were innocent while the Northerners were demonic is absurd. It is because of this untruthful narrative that the confederate apologists, to this day, refuse to acknowledge slavery's role in the war: To admit otherwise is to deconstruct the entire fabrication of southern moral superiority.  The only other thing I have to say is this:   You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out. I know I had no hand in making this war, and I know I will make more sacrifices to-day than any of you to secure peace. But you cannot have peace and a division of our country. If the United States submits to a division now, it will not stop, but will go on until we reap the fate of Mexico, which is eternal war. The United States does and must assert its authority, wherever it once had power; for, if it relaxes one bit to pressure, it is gone, and I believe that such is the national feeling. This feeling assumes various shapes, but always comes back to that of Union. Once admit the Union, once more acknowledge the authority of the national Government, and, instead of devoting your houses and streets and roads to the dread uses of war, I and this army become at once your protectors and supporters, shielding you from danger, let it come from what quarter it may. I know that a few individuals cannot resist a torrent of error and passion, such as swept the South into rebellion, but you can point out, so that we may know those who desire a government, and those who insist on war and its desolation.  ...  I myself have seen in Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, hundreds and thousands of women and children fleeing from your armies and desperadoes, hungry and with bleeding feet. In Memphis, Vicksburg, and Mississippi, we fed thousands and thousands of the families of rebel soldiers left on our hands, and whom we could not see starve. Now that war comes to you, you feel very different. You deprecate its horrors, but did not feel them when you sent car-loads of soldiers and ammunition, and moulded shells and shot, to carry war into Kentucky and Tennessee, to desolate the homes of hundreds and thousands of good people who only asked to live in peace at their old homes, and under the Government of their inheritance. But these comparisons are idle. I want peace, and believe it can only be reached through union and war, and I will ever conduct war with a view to perfect an early success.   ~ General Sherman in addressing the Atlantan people who did not wish to evacuate the city."

nottheonion,3dwny9,Roggvir,23,Mon Jul 20 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"There is some half truth there.  The civil war was definitely about slavery. The north was against slavery and the south was for slavery. There were other issues too, but politically north and south was becoming distant. The next republican candidate Lincoln was a favor to win the election because of the North. The southern leaders said that they'll exit the union if Lincoln was to become the president. Without any southern vote, Lincoln became the president and the US was going to be disjointed. Lincoln did not go to war to end slavery. Lincoln said during inauguration:   ""I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.""   Despite Lincoln's personal dislike of slavery, he felt keeping the union was more important than slavery.  TL;DR: Slavery was what drove the north and south apart. But keeping the union was what caused the war."
nottheonion,3dwny9,itsecurityguy,13,Mon Jul 20 04:39:54 2015 UTC,"Partially right, Lincoln was a tipping point, since the American Revolution there was a struggle for power between North and South. Leading up to the 1840s new states in the Union were on a one for one trade meaning one new Southern state for every new Northern state. From the 1840s until Civil War Northern politicians started almost exclusively only introducing Northern states, this shifted the power dramatically into Northern states hands. Slavery was the economic model of the South and parts of the North. Ending slavery quickly in one sweep would cripple the South. Southern states feared this and the power the North had stacked in its favor. Essentially they saw the Union no longer representative of their states. This drove the secession, its an attribute shared by the founding fathers of the Union prior to the American Revolution. While some of the major reasons are deplorable (slavery) in today's context the underlying theme is not so different from the past and what a lot of political arguments are about in contemporary times."

At the same time, if I read between the lines, you seem to assume your belief is correct without explaining why your belief wouldn’t also be the result of ignorance or extenuation.    What I can mention is that neither the received opinions about the Civil War taught in grade schools, nor those held by certain reactionaries to these opinions are accurate. Largely they support, and are symptoms of, greater ideological issues. In any case, although slavery was a cause for divide that triggered the Civil War, reality is much more complicated. Other major contributing factors were socio-economic and infrastructural differences, different economic models, different models of westward expansion, labor law, differences in interpretations of the powers and limitations of states’ rights and federal rights, and so on.  Once again, ultimately slavery was a major cause behind the war, but as a cause it was much more complicated than a moral issue of right and wrong, and it tied into interpretations of the Constitution, political representation, economic models and so on."

Another argument I've seen is how did the confederacy get so much support if the majority of people didn't own slaves and many didn't benefit from them?

nottheonion,3dwny9,Nicklovn,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:34 2015 UTC,Why slavery was the primary issue? Its still odd to me historically but here's the basics: Southern economy is built on slavery. When an economy is built around something it is generally not feasible to eliminate that something (saudi arabia without oil?).  Southerners felt convinced that Lincoln would elimimate slavery even though he publicly stated he was not interested in that. Thus the CSA is formed.

For states like Virginia and Tennessee (the Upper South) there was more diverse reasoning.   While I won't deny slavery being the key issue, those two (and maybe North Carolina) found themselves stuck between a rock and hard place. Culturally and economically they were more closely aligned to the South but they were no political firebrands either. Reading some of the Virginia Succession debates you can see some very practical viewpoints. When Lincoln made the call (or demand depending on your sentiments) for troops they had to make a choice. The fervor of Sumter and the call for troops was enough to carry the day.   One of the more interesting hypothetical's of the war is if Lincoln allows the evacuation of Ft Sumter like so many other forts, or doesn't call for troops immediately after its fired upon. The situation in Washington was pretty fluid at the time, it could have gone many different ways.   VA and Tennessee (and maybe NC) might not have succeeded. You have a very different situation in that case. Best case they are able to talk them back into the Union and slavery might end naturally, though likely many years later. Or the South has to engage in a war without three of the most important states in the Confederacy by contributions and it ends much quicker with far less destruction.  All very interesting stuff.

nottheonion,3dwny9,Tb1969,3,Mon Jul 20 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"So why did those Union States stay in the Union if they knew their slavery would be outlawed eventually?  Simple. Lincoln was not a dictator.  He could not legislate the freedom of the slaves; that;s not what the executive branch does.  He could only make Executive Orders and those orders being limited in scope and time frame he could not affect the remaining Union States.  He could enforce his orders in regions that were in insurrection.    Those Northern States who still had slavery knew that they were going to lose their slaves if they stayed with the Union and did so anyway.  The North including the few slave owning states were about winding down slavery and phasing it out over decades as abolitionists had been doing for decades.  The South accelerated everything by attacking Union soldiers and starting the war.  Without slavery the South would not have gone to war.  There will always be issues on the table like tithes and railroad expansion but these were minor.  No, slavery was the cause of the war.  All of the Southern state's secession letters talked about slavery as the primary if not implying the only issue driving them to do what they did.  It was all about slavery.  It was a War of Northern Aggression against Slavers"

As it is, Trump is merely a bombastic candidate with little chance of winning, and is getting media attention precisely because he's so infuriating. Outrage is good for views, and so reporters (without any deliberate coordination!) are incentivized to report on him. Meanwhile, Trump (also completely independently!) is incentivized to act as outrageously as possible, which gets him more attention. More media attention means a surge in the polls when the field so crowded, which gets even more media attention, and so on.  It's the same process that makes celebrities a thing.

Well maybe women wouldn't find it as hard to get into politics if so many (not all, thank you) women would stop blaming so much on the fact that they are a woman. If you think the press are rude and superficial about politicians, feel free to address that (or ignore it, because let's face it, people are probably going to say worse things about you if you're a politician and you're going to need a thick skin), but don't make blatantly untrue statements about how it's all happening because you're a female and then ask for special treatment.

They then went on as one of the hold-out creditors, which refused to accept a debt restructuring deal or a payment plan.  Because they wouldn't make a deal, Argentina defaulted, and they got nothing...  The entire fiasco was pretty much pure loss to them, it basically amounted to, ""Either agree to this legal obligation to pay $120B you don't have, or do nothing at all.""

How do you know that they aren't the rightful owner, or that they aren't acting on behalf of the rightful owner? A quick check on Google turns up an interesting post:   A client recently presented several bonds along with a request for an opinion of value. He asked, “Are these bonds for real?” If so, their value could be over $100 million dollars with accrued interest, and could be used as an asset in a corporation or sold for cash.  The bonds were 7% Gold Bonds dated May 21st 1875, without coupons, due November 1st 1880.  The bonds sold were collateralized by the proceeds of the sale of Peruvian Guano. The Bonds were guaranteed by the Peruvian Government and had the signature of the Plenipotentiary of Peru in Washington D.C. and bore the seal with the coat of arms of Peru.

No do I do not have scholarly citations. Do you require scholarly citations for all deductive arguments? If so, then I can't imagine you to be a very engaging debater.  There are certainly downsides to firearm ownership. Accidents do happen and they are often very tragic. However, the idea that someone shall not have the right to defend themselves is something I believe to be worth the risk.  You seem at assert that no one applies proper gun safety all of the time. Any scholarly citations? Of course some people employ gun safety ALL of the time. The basic concepts are not that difficult to employ 100% of the time and they DO prevent all gun accidents. (Again no scholarly citation.) If you can provide an example of a death where perfect gun safety was implemented I would be shocked. Perhaps there are a handful due to some kind of grave malfunction.  I want to leave you with a fairly extreme, yet definitely applicable, example. What if a woman (or really anyone) is in total fear for her life from someone. Perhaps a deranged ex-husband/boyfriend. If perfect gun control is in place, this woman's life is indefensible. That person could take her life without her having ANY ability in which to defend herself. That is something that I believe should NEVER be allowed.

Any scholarly citations?   I assert that nobody is perfect. I do not have any evidence that shows no-one is perfect I do however have many cases to cite of people with weapons training still not having followed gun safety rules all the time and leading to documented cases of harm to themselves or others. I can provide the cases in question but it's a simple as a Google search to find them yourself. If needed though I can provide.    Of course some people employ gun safety ALL of the time.   I refute this claim. Not a single being on this planet is perfect, that's why we have accidents. Even something as simple as walking is imperfect, I've certainly been known for having two left feet. No matter how simple something is, no human is perfect at its execution and/or application at all times. To suggest otherwise, I would need to see studies.    Perhaps there are a handful due to some kind of grave malfunction.   Even the manufacture of these devices are imperfect and can lead to accidents.   To your thought experiment:    If perfect gun control is in place, this woman's life is indefensible.    I disagree. Gun control is not banning guns. This is a fatal flaw in your argument. She can certainly have a gun, a gun that she can defend herself with in her own residence or in public where guns are allowed as long as it is clearly visible. Studies have shown that assault weapons cause more harm than good and usually do not help in personal defence, that's why I am for controlling public access to these weapons.   I do not thing the founding fathers had in mind automatic and semi automatic weapons in mind when granting the right to bear arms.

Kind of glad you brought that up because it's just another example of a word you're using improperly. This is not terrorism, this is not war, and he is not Hitler. It's very likely just a crazy guy who got zero treatment and zero therapy."
nottheonion,3dqb3n,Zulban,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:43:52 2015 UTC,"Your reading to far into this.  My point is that this is rapidly starting to look like a pretty clear cut case of an Islamic extremist attacking the US.  He didnt ""declare war"".  We are already at a de facto state of war with ISIS/L and its supporters.  This is starting to look more and more like part of that war. Especially when you look at the texts he sent, the twitter traffic from ISIS taking credit for the attack, and his personal history.  Whether he is a lone wolf inspired to act or whether he was radicalized and trained directly by a fundamentalist group is irrelevant. What is relevant is whether or not this was an act that he was committing as part of the ongoing war with ISIS/L  War is not just a matter between nations.  It can be between religions, ideologies, political movements ect.  To simply write it off a something that only nations (and we will just ignore for a minute that the Islamic State has declared itself a nation) can participate in would discount hundreds of different conflicts throughout history.  Just because this guys family said he was depressed doesnt make it the single factor that lead to this.    Hell, if a family member of mine did this I would probably try to say he was mentally ill too.  Nobody wants to think that their brother or son would ever do something like this."

To make things more interesting almost all of our gun crime here in the US comes from people who arent legally able to own firearms anyways (around 80% is connected to gang or drug violence, usually in a certain few urban areas), meaning more laws probably wont stop them.

This is why the rules about no guns on military property make sense.  80% of the military work support jobs and are not necessarily weapon savvy. People with little weapon experience, like this guy, pick up a gun and try to feel like Rambo. There's armed guards at military bases. The only issue is the few places off post like the recruiting centers. In reality there will be a hundred times more incidents of negligent discharge casualties than terrorist attacks prevented."
nottheonion,3dqb3n,exodus787,5,Sat Jul 18 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, this guy screwed up big time, but I have to disagree with you on several points.  ""Why would anyone have a round chambered?"" Because all modern firearms designed for self defense are designed to have a round kept in the chamber. When properly holstered, a safety is not necessary to keep the gun from discharging. However, a pocket is not a holster.  The armed guards that you say are there to protect the military bases did no good to the 5 people that were killed by the shooter earlier this week. As you said, there are no armed guards at the recruiting centers. I guess personal stationed there are just SOL?  And as for the ""hundreds of times more incidents of negligent discharges"", statistics show that you are much more likely to be injured or killed by any number of other mundane causes than by negligent discharge of a firearm.  Finally, I don't believe that one's ability to accurately wield a firearm should be considered when talking about requirements to own and use one. I do feel that you should be responsible for your actions and the consequences.  Perhaps the reason that most military personal that are not weapon savvy is the prohibition of owning weapons while living or working on government property?"

Let me put it to you in these terms, if we took data from just yesterday: For every terrorist attack on a recruiting station, there was 1 negligent discharge.

I'm also gambling that the either didn't have a safety or a safety that was very affirmative; add keys or a pocket knife getting caught on the trigger and you have the perfect dumb-ass situation.

I'm paying a premium to live in a shitty one-room studio, but the fucking beach is my front yard!""  So you buy a grill.  You get all ready for summer.  You move in.  It's going to be grand.  Then the first day you grill, you get your meats out, leave them on the grill, and turn around to grab a spatula off the picnic table.  Turn back not 10 seconds later, and the meat's gone.  Strewn everywhere.  One little peck out of every hot dog.  You run to clean it up, and in your haste you don't think.  The bastard gulls have now dived down to the picnic table.  They snatched up the rolls and strewn them everywhere too.  Fuck.  The seagulls destroyed your cookout.  Later that week, you go out to start your car to head to work in the morning.  Your windshield is spidered to shit.  You realize the little bastards had been dropping clams onto your car since dawn trying to crack them.  It looks like they had a 50/50 success rate, half the time breaking the clam, half the time busting up the windshield or the paint job on the poor old Camry.  Son of a bitch!  You think.  You knew the salt air would rust the car more quickly.  But you never considered that the fucking gulls would actively use the your Toyota as a clam anvil.  The summer wanes.  The fall comes on, and soon it's getting cold and blustery.  The fun of living at the beach starts waning too, but water's warmer in fall than spring, so at least there's a warm breeze.    And then, out of nowhere, the first Nor'easter hits.  You knew this was coming.  But holy shit you didn't think it through.  The waves come up and swamp your road.  There's no escape now but by boat.  You don't own a boat.  The cold sand blows in at 70MPH.  It completely destroys the new windshield you put in because the fucking gulls killed your last one.  The salt water pours over your driveway and the salt spray hits every one of the paint wounds the gulls left in the car's body.  For the next few weeks, you drive through huge salt puddles to get in and out of your neighborhood, spraying your undercarriage with the most corrosive salt puddles ever, since they get saltier as they slowly evaporate.  By the next summer, my car was just about fucked.  And I decided three things:  1) If you're going to live on the water, find some place up higher with a better escape road, and  2) If you're going to live on the water, get a beater or a garage.  3) Fuck seagulls."

I have one for my Smith & Wesson M&P15-22 but i haven't actually gotten around to using it yet lol.

nottheonion,3dn2ai,BlackRind,23,Sun Jul 19 02:24:48 2015 UTC,"For those that want to avoid GIF hell:  Atlanta radio show “The Bert Show” had a guest on this week who has managed to incite the rage of just about every millennial in the state of Georgia (and beyond, the show is syndicated in 11 states).   The woman, a 22-year-old college junior named Kim, who did not give her last name on air and was allowed to use a voice disguiser to even further shield her identity, came to the three hosts with a confession: in just short three years she had managed to blow through a $90,000 college fund left to her by her grandparents. Kim has one year left of school and no way to cover her remaining $20,000 tuition balance.  Read more: 3 reasons money isn't making you happy  The show’s hosts try to give Kim the benefit of the doubt. She’s come to them (for some untold reason — perhaps a financial aid officer would have been a wiser choice) in a time of great need and they at least want to try to help her.  But what followed has to be one of the most painful interviews that has ever been aired on national radio. Kim manages to personify just about every parent’s worst nightmare — an entitled 20-something who asks for handouts rather than face the very real financial challenges of young adulthood. You can listen to the full interview online at TheBertShow.com, but we’ve shared the highlights of Kim’s cringe-inducing description of her predicament below.  ""Years ago my grandparents set up a college fund for me, which was amazing, and I haven’t been very good with my budget for school. The first payment for my senior year just arrived and I don’t have the money basically. I’ve just been avoiding it. I knew the bill was coming.”  “I used it to budget for school clothes and college break money. I probably should have not done that. I took a trip to Europe. The Europe thing I thought was part of my education and that’s how I tried to justify that.”  “Maybe [my parents] should have taught me to budget or something. They never sat me down and had a real serious talk about it.”  “[My parents] said there was nothing they could do for me. They’re not being honest with me saying they don't have [money] because my dad has worked for like a million years and they have a retirement account.”  “Then my parents suggested I go take out a loan at a credit union and I’m, like, how am I supposed to do that?""  “I have to go inside the bank to get a loan?”  Bert Show co-host Jeff Dauler: ""You could get a job for the school ...maybe the cafeteria's hiring.""  Kim: ""That’s embarrassing.""  “I know they’re trying to teach me a lesson and blah blah blah and character building but, like, I hope they realize [working part-time] could have such a negative effect on my grades and as a person.""  Here’s what’s most infuriating about Kim’s situation: Not only is she admitting that she had — and squandered — a $90,000 college fund that was supposed to cover her college expenses , but she completely lacks any remorse. She says she feels ""stressed"" but not once does she seem grateful for her good fortune or ashamed about blowing it in three short years.  Not surprisingly, The Bert Show’s hosts have a really hard time keeping it together during their conversation with Kim. We have to give major kudos to co-host Kristin Klingshirn who (despite the fact that she herself had to work three jobs to pay for college, she said) was the only one who did not completely give up on Kim’s ability to get it together.  “I think you’re learning an even more valuable lesson than you could in any of your classes,” Klingshirn told her.    Eventually, it does seem as if Kim starts to get the message. Her parents refused to cosign a loan to cover her tuition shortfall unless she got a job. She called the show on Thursday to give her fourth and final update: She has come to grips with the fact that she will, indeed, have to get a job. We almost felt a bit sorry for her when she started explaining how difficult it has been to find a place that will hire her because she has no job history.  “I feel like I’m back at square one,” she said. “I’m hustling to do this and to make this work.”  Listening to this young woman slowly start to understand the value of abstract concepts like hard work and responsibility was as equally gratifying as it was boggling to the mind. All we have to say is this: “The Bert Show” deserves a special award for services to their country. Thanks to them, there may be one less 20-something out there giving millennials a bad rap.  Update: Given the rabid response I've gotten from readers on this story, I feel compelled to add some more context to Kim's situation. Yes, plenty of students juggle work and school to cover their tuition costs. In fact, three-quarters of college students work at least part-time throughout school to cover tuition costs, according to a forthcoming survey from student lender Sallie Mae. But simply telling a college student to ""get a job"" to cover their tuition is somewhat shortsighted.   Bad budgeting skills or not, college students are matriculating at a time when it has never been more expensive to get a college degree. Yes, students can cope with this cost by applying for scholarships, low-interest federal student loans or work-study programs on campus. But even that might not be enough.   Working 20 hours a week at a part-time job at today’s federal minimum wage rate ($7.25), it would take the average college student more than five years to pay off the average net tuition cost at a public-four year university ($36,000). And that doesn’t include expenses like housing, transportation and food. At the same time, household wages have fallen flat and fixed costs like housing and health care are rising exponentially. What Kim has unfortunately realized is that kids who don't have plush college funds typically have only way to cover college costs and that is student debt. And that is how our country has found itself with a $1 trillion student debt crisis on its hands. More than one-quarter of today’s 38 million student debtors are strapped with $50,000 or more in student loan debt and the average graduate carries nearly $30,000."

Not because of this obviously financial incompetent woman with no concept of how the real world works, but how stories like this are used by previous generations as a smear campaign against millennials. It takes away from the legitimate concerns millennials have over the astronomical rise in the cost of secondary education with a comparatively small rise in wages. Cherry picked stories about naive 20 somethings with poor money management and work ethic is reinforcing previous generation's ridiculous notion that millennials are entitled slackers that just want to live off the tit of their parents and the government. Believing this allows Baby Boomers and Gen Xers to take no responsibility for the real problems they created for millennials. They simplify millennials lack of success to the fact that they are unwilling to get a job and actually work their way through life. For every one of the slacker 20 somethings in these stories, there are 100 working their asses off at historically low minimum wage jobs and still walking out of school $50k+ in debt and no job adequate enough to pay if off. Policy change and reform for secondary education and minimum wage will never come if biased shit about millennials like this keep coming out that mask the real problems."

But:   You're certainly right that college tuition is rising faster than inflation and wages at a time when the demand/expectation/requirement for a college degree is also rising, and that's a real problem. When I see that parents gave their daughter control over 90k for college, and had not raised her to be responsible with that money, yes I do still lay a lot of that blame on the parents.

I get your point, but there is a lot that people can make to avoid going into that much debt.   First, what's the scenario here?  Are people actually working for $7.50 an hour to pay for each and every dollar that they will need for an education?  My guess is that a lot of students are working part-time to help with their expenses, which in my opinion should be part of the mix, but also federal grants (I paid for part of my education with a pell grant, but I graduated in 1993... I honestly don't know if that option is still available).    I took some loans but not a lot; I graduated with less than $5,000 in debts and according to this inflation calculator that's about $8,200 today which is manageable.   I also lived with my parents and took public transport to work.  Another variable in the equation is what major you choose; if this young lady in the story blew 90,000 in one of those fake ""studies"" degrees that are common today she may not be able to find a job that would justify her expenses.  I graduated with a degree in computer science from a small private college in my state; it was not the best school in my region, but it was the one I could afford.  I've been working non-stop in my field, I'm not wealthy but I do well.  There are other majors that offer excellent job prospects for young people today and won't cost you an arm and a leg.  I'm 47, but if I was a high-school graduate today I would be looking at jobs in the mining industry or manufacturing... some of which don't even require a college degree..."

nottheonion,3dn2ai,Bonerkiin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Chomsky is not some sort of mythical all-knowing demi-god, but sometimes he cuts to the chase and speaks the plain, blunt truth in such a way that shocks us and makes us think we're stupid because we never thought of it that way.  Once upon a time I was a tenure-track compsci professor. That experience thoroughly disgusted me about higher education. Teaching at public and even private schools was far more honest and honorable in comparison. In public schools grades are basically honest and may only sometimes be based on who your parents are or if the teacher likes you or not. At the post-secondary level, grades revolved around financial aid.  For example, the grade of ""D"" was essentially eliminated. I had to have a very, very, very good reason to flunk a student. The reason? Because financial aid required the student to maintain a ""C"" average. Though state institutions and non-profit, the administrations understand who is paying the bills -- the federal government via financial aid. And those non-profit institutions subtly/tactfully changed to reflect the fiscal reality.  What sickened me was to see the system up close. As a veteran, I could not help but to see the analogy to military recruiters/salesmen lying to clueless teens to get them to join the military -- the system was that corrupt and dishonest. It simply is a way of preying on the young and inexperienced.  The system of allowing clueless young college students to rent absurdly expensive off-campus apartments with student loans paying for them was insane. Students routinely got ""kickbacks"" of student loan money to go on Caribbean vacations -- again, all rolled up on student loans. I knew those students were hanging themselves, but the entire system is corrupt. It seems to me to be designed to make banks rich with risk-free loans via saddling students with debt peonage/bondage. Chomsky's quote offers another angle of discipline.  An aside: When I lived in Germany I was shocked that Germans gave young people an even longer period of time for paid vacations than older workers. The Germans' thought was that they're young and carefree, they should enjoy life, and there will be plenty of time for them to work their asses off when they're 30-something and have kids. I thought that was a nice attitude.  Here in the US we see things differently. We see young people as clueless and merely as people to screw over and exploit extra hard."

They did teach me how to make the most of the money you have. But the level of work I put into my life at that time, and even now, is because of who I am, not what I was taught.  Some of that was because if I wanted something, my parents told me to find a way to pay for it. I wasnt coddled, or handed anything. Personal drive pushed me to where I got to. This kid was coddled and made to be a real life princess who didnt have to take any responsibility.   THAT, is bad parenting."

It wouldn't hurt you in the long run if both your pinkies were removed as a baby, so I assume you'd be perfectly fine with that?

The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis.

I know I'm in the minority here, but I wouldn't fight for my country if I thought it was in the wrong, and I don't condone others who would. It's worth keeping in mind that the people memorialized here weren't poor ignorant locals who were press-ganged into fighting the damnyankees--Davis, Lee, and Jackson were powerful men who had the opportunity to pick a side, and they picked the one that was defending slavery.  When the men who fervently supported and defended the Confederacy are excused on the grounds that it's only natural to fight back, it doesn't just unjustifiably rehabilitate their historical images. It also silences the memories of those who took the moral high ground. There were people in the South--a minority in most areas but well worth remembering--who refused to go along with the prevailing evil of their society. This includes White men who refused to serve in the Confederate army, as well as those men and women, White and Black, who risked their lives and often those of their families to lead slave revolts or to support the underground railroad.  These people played an important role in history, especially in Georgia where Sherman's March benefited from local recruitment (primarily but not exclusively Black) which in turn meant slavery ended more quickly there than it otherwise would have. But in a narrative where Lee, Jackson, and Davis are patriots, such moral heroes are inevitably cast as traitors.  On a totally unrelated point:   I have the old state flag on my wall in my room, right next to my American flag. I like it cause it's my heritage.  I can't tell you how many times somebody has accused my family of owning slaves [...] My dad's family walked off the boat from Poland in 1910, and my mom's came from Mexico in the 30s.   It would seem to me that you can't have it both ways. Either you identify with old Georgian heritage, in which case that heritage absolutely includes slavery and I understand why someone would want to call you out on it; or you don't identify with that heritage, in which case why exactly are you flying that flag?

War was coming to these peoples doorstep and the war machine that was coming doesn't give a shit about your individual politics. Lee was in favor of the Union until Virginia seceded and he fought for the South because he knew what the impending war meant for his home.   Imagine if your a Southern man who didn't believe in slavery but the fight is coming to your area. Are your politics going to stop them from destroying trains you depend on for goods/trade? Will it stop them from burning crops that you need or Union soldiers from killing your loved ones? Will it stop the women in your family from being treated roughly by an invading force far from home?  Under your logic everyone who fights against the US in the Middle East must be evil. It doesn't matter if their family has been hassled  or possibly killed, their leaders were oppressive so they ought to suck it up for the greater good.

Let's start with the fact that the first shots of the Civil War at Fort Sumter were from Confederate soldiers onto Union troops.  The Confederacy was the initial aggressor of the war, so claiming that people had to fight in order to preserve their homes is disingenuous.  Secondly, Sherman's scorched earth policy wasn't really a scorched earth policy.  Yes, his soldiers had to scavenge for food, but the only places he really targeted for destruction were the state capitals to send a message that secession was wrong.  Other than that he did pretty well at keeping an army of that size under control.  The only exceptions were when local Confederate sympathizers would try to deceive the Union soldiers, placing them in danger.  As you can imagine, they didn't take too kindly to that.  There were many places where Sherman didn't ruin life for civilians living in the South.  His main objective was to destroy the supplies and supply lines feeding the Confederate forces all while battling a Confederate army.  It's not as though he went on an attack of nothing but civilian targets.  The entire march to the sea was a series of skirmishes and flanking maneuvers aimed at driving back the confederate forces under the command of Joseph Johnson."

In 1915 the KKK was re-formed at a meeting at the foot of Stone Mountain. A year later the United Daughters of the Confederacy commissioned a ginormous carving of Georgian Confederate war heroes, and they chose Stone Mountain because of the site's symbolic value as a place where southern white pride had been reborn. The Klan helped the UDC's fundraising drives to raise money for the project, and the land's owner gave the Klan perpetual rights to use Stone Mountain as a site for meetings."

That said, there are lots of previous examples of statues of deposed leaders being destroyed when regimes or attitudes change. Do you feel the same way about various statues of Hitler, Stalin, or Lenin that were mostly destroyed after 1945, 1956, and 1989 respectively?

But while everyone else looked in horror, ISIS believed that they were doing the right thing. Based on the beliefs that they currently hold, no other idoltry should be allowed on Earth and it's their job to destroy it. However, this wasn't always their view and it's not the view of most Muslims. Yet even though this view is a fairly recent one, and even though they've only been in control of those areas for a short period of time,  their actions will have permanent consequences on the preservation of history.   While we can all see the error of their ways and the permanent harm that a knee-jerk decision can make on history, this is exactly what people are pushing for now. They're asking the government to destroy a piece of history that they do not agree with.

I'm just saying, I also have asthma and didn't suffer any kind of attack (and I was still fine a week later).   However, if she's not used to spicey foods then these are/would have been too hot for her. I could imagine it irritating her throat/airways, and caused her to have difficulty breathing, especially if she panicked or something.

Malcolm Little, for example, entered prison as a petty thug but after years of self-directed reading left as the future civil rights leader Malcolm X.    The idea is that the deeper your social/political understanding is the less likely you are to commit acts of crime.  Allowing this guy to read about other points of view and to broaden his political understanding would at the least do no harm (I doubt he will just become a more erudite mass killer), and would most likely give him a broader political and historical base that would militate against committing these sort of actions.  It fits in with the broader idea that prison exists to reform individuals to make the world better and not to punish them.

The night when her bright hearth full of fire took reign and she moved forward towards her dream, Freedom!  Free, joyful, she wandered eating the freshest grass she had ever eaten, seen the strangest animals she'd ever seen. That when she heard a small yelp. A sound so faint most wouldn't even have noticed they even heard it but a mother knows such sounds. She found a calf whom was attacked, she nursed it back to health. She took that lost young calf  under it's wings, fought for it fought for their survival. always on the run, free roaming bovine. She swore that she would give him the chance to a better life a life of full freedom, Yet the young calf disappeared, possibly died most likely during the cold harsh polish winters. Unable to carry that flame, that light, that dream alive, the years took their tolls on her, eroding her once mighty free range spirit.  She soon realized that the end was near. The night was cold, cold. They came upon her like lighting and thunder tearing  as sunder the stillness of the night. The light of 3, no 5, trucks light driving up behind her. The angry engines roaring!  The yelling of the farmers, their fuming howls of rage. Surrounded, hungry, the will to fight beaten out her, she gave in, she gave in, gave up to her captors.

If you know this, and are knowingly supporting the ""slander"" of ILLEGAL immigrants, that is a much larger issue. We have a SERIOUS issue with national security and it is INCREDIBLY important that we stop this flow of illegal immigrants before something VERY serious happens. Our nation is at force protection BRAVO because we have a major terrorist group hot on our heels. This isn't about racism, Mexican people provide so much for our nation, and they should be INSULTED that after all they've done to come here LEGALLY that people are making a bad name for their race by FLOWING into the nation illegally.

nottheonion,3dgkfq,KageJittai,2,Thu Jul 16 12:23:06 2015 UTC,"That's really not at all true.  Obama ran in 2008 saying he wanted to allow gays to serve in the military, and wanted to get rid of DOMA.   He didn't go as far as being in favor of gay marriage in 2008, true, but after he won the first two fights and got rid of both ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" and DOMA he pivoted towards being in favor of gay marriage as well.

nottheonion,3dgkfq,Yosarian2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:44 2015 UTC,Do we give the presidents who appointed the other 3 justices who voted in favor the credit too?
nottheonion,3dgkfq,KageJittai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Bill Clinton should get a lot of credit for appointing Ruth Bater Ginsburg and Stephen Brier (not just for this case; either; those two judges are great.)   The 5th judge here is Kennedy, who was appointed by Reagen.  That's an interesting case; it's worth mentioning that Reagen also appointed Antonin Scalia, who was the loudest voice on the court arguing against gay marriage.    Kennedy is really the only judge on the court who doesn't follow the simple ""liberal judges got appointed be democrats, conservative judges got appointed by republicans"" pattern; he's basically a moderate, who's conservative on some issues but progressive on others."
nottheonion,3dgkfq,Yosarian2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the idea of crediting presidents with the rulings of the SCOTUS.  Considering that short of appointment, they have no real control of what happens afterwards.  Especially years down the road."
nottheonion,3dgkfq,KageJittai,2,Thu Jul 16 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"That's reasonable, although the basic rule of ""if you want a supreme court that makes progressive decisions, then elect a progressive president"" is still a good rule of thumb.  That's not all Obama did, though.   In the earlier gay marriage cases they decided in 2013 (the DOMA one and the California one) Obama took the unusual step of actually having the Justice department refuse to defend the DOMA law in court, saying he thought it was unconstitutional and indefensible.   I'm not sure if that ended up making a difference, but it was certanly something the Supreme Court noticed and commented on."

Most carriers of polio experience no symptoms, they become silent carriers for the disease. Children who are not potty trained are the most susceptible to the disease for obvious reasons, making daycares hotbeds for the disease to spread, and children don't always remember to wash their hands once they do become potty trained. And even if a person knew they were an asymptomatic carrier of polio, there is no cure, making their only option to be extra careful when they wash their hands. On top of that, polio is virtually dead in America thanks to the polio vaccine, so it would take someone travelling to or visiting from a country where its not so dead to spread it here, and if you think a city like Seattle doesn't get international travellers you're dreaming. Polio won't come overnight, but you will regret it when it does come."

We've been administering it to all children since the 1950s, if there was a problem with it then it would be apparent by now. I am not against testing the safety of it, but until something is actually shown to be wrong with it that is worse than polio I think we should still keep administering it. Symptomatic polio is far worse than any possible side effect the vaccine may or may not have, if it was then it would have been made very clear by the 1960s, if not sooner. Again, there is no evidence that vaccines are bad for you unless you're allergic.

The only way to counter the anti vac folks is to provide pro vac  arguments in a rational, friendly way.  Dismissive, confrontational to condescending pro vac folks do more harm then good.

You need a source of it, so someone needs to be infected and exposed to enough people to begin spreading the virus  Second - Slow response to the problem. If one or two people are infected and there is a response almost immediately, it will be contained quickly.  Young children, and anyone who fails to wash their hands properly risk infection as well as spreading the virus. Public washrooms, schools, and additional public places in which a large number of people pass through and handle the same objects repetitively through the day are the prime subjects of infection.

The disease is very rare in the US, but as soon as one person catches it and visits Seattle it can spread much more quickly and easily. You'll notice that the US didn't have an Ebola epidemic while other countries did even though there isn't even a vaccine for it. We managed this through controlling travel and containing those who did catch it until they were no longer at risk of giving it to others. Hopefully if polio shows up in the US again we will take similar measures to ensure it doesn't spread. We can however make it less likely by vaccinating everyone, just like most places now require you to wear your seatbelt.

And your comment about lazy people putting personal happiness first is just outright and demonstrably stupid. People get into relationships to make their lives better. If being with someone makes your life worse, you shouldn't be with them. Putting personal happiness first in a relationship that is supposed to make each person happier is the act of an intelligent person, not a lazy person.  Love is supposed to make each person in the relationship happier, yet you believe its about sticking it out when the relationship is shitty instead of gasp actually doing something to improve the relationship like what this article is about.  It sounds to me like you are an extremely clingy person who can't even fathom what a healthy relationship is like; maybe you are stuck on the idea of love instead of what love actually is.

The divorce rate is not well over 50%, that's a myth, go back and do some research. So right out of the gate, you're spewing BS. Not everyone gets into relationships to feel better, they also get into relationships because it's convenient. Which happens in marriage also, but we're talking about living situations, not marriage. Living with someone but seeing them on your terms is lazy. It means you only want enough of them to make you happy, and yes, lazy people do put their own happiness first. Lazy, selfish people. You cat like suffering is the only alternative to happiness. It's not about sacrifice, it's about putting someone else before you in an act of love for them, which is what this whole thing kind of hinges on. THAT DOES make people happy. So there is happiness both ways, but the lazy person just puts theirs first and foremost, which DOES also make the relationship healthier because the other person does it too. That's my take on the matter and I'll leave it at that instead of stooping to your level of name calling and assumptions. You seem to have a simple view of love, but love is complex."

The able-bodied adults who do not have children can only receive food benefits for three months if they are unemployed or must work at least 20 hours a week to receive help beyond that point. Last month, only 13,000 or 2.1% of the total recipients were in this category. Food benefits are a very small amount and are not intended to be a person's entire food budget, thus the name ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program."" In fact, the average SNAP benefit is $4.27 per person per day or $1.42 per meal.

My point was more that this guy, who apparently had so much trash littering his property that it was visible from the curb, felt the need to begrudge a poor man some cans. Where I'm from, if someone asks if they can haul away the garbage strewn about your property, you usually say, ""sure,"" not, ""Hell no, that's like $3.50 worth of scrap metal I've got saved up!""

Kentucky borders more states than any other state in the United States and so it's a reasonable road trip whether you're coming from Florida, New York, Chicago, the Midwest or even Texas. You can't fly with weed (except Oregon) so a lot of folks jump in their car. Kentucky also has a considerable weed smoking sub-culture. Those were all just me guessing and the founders probably didn't consider all that when they started it but its centralized location may have contributed to its success.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebowski_Fest  Edit: Tennessee and Missouri border 8 states and Kentucky only borders 7"

I've been telling people for over 20 years some bullshit... My whole life has been a lie!   However-  In Oregon you can grow your own weed as long as its not in public. You can have half a pound of weed in your house and you can legally travel with an ounce of it on you. This includes taking it on in state flights.   http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/10/travel/portland-oregon-airport-marijuana-in-state-flights-feat/

I don't know if my local news just has some bias or if Trump really is managing to rise in the polls, but I am certainly not worried about a Trump presidency, if he somehow manages to win the republican primaries (appeal to all the crazy grandparents etc), it would only mean an almost guaranteed loss for the republicans in the general election.

I have no idea what you could honestly find so terrible about this guy.  My guess is he's from the right and doesn't like leftist politicians being popular, so a person running for president of the United States (an extremely important role warranting mass publicity) gaining mass publicity on Reddit is ""worship"".

nottheonion,3d5k1a,steezylemonsqueezy,56,Tue Jul 14 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but I'll bite. I don't hate the guy. He has some weird ideas about taxes and securities, but my biggest problem with him is that he's a completely unrealistic candidate. Here's my reply from elsewhere in the thread:   Dude I'm pretty hesitant to hop on the bernie sanders band wagon. There's so much left that he hasn't even touched on. Sure he's got some nice ideas about social issues (although they're a tad idealistic, I mean he hasn't suggested a single way that he could accomplish them, just that he's going to change things), but what is his foreign policy? How is he going to deal with minority issues? I mean vermont is nice and all but it's just about the most homogenous state in the US and I don't think they really export anything internationally. The guy literally has zero experience in most areas that the president has to deal with, especially compared to Bush who was the governer of Florida, and Clinton who has been the senator of NY and the secretary of state. Compared to all of his competitors he's underqualified, underexperienced, and not to mention old as fuck. If he gets elected he'll be pushing 80 by the time he gets out of his first term (which would make him the oldest president in history). Presidency is a high stress job that takes a toll on people. Just google before and after pictures of two term presidents, it looks like they aged 20 years in the span of 8. If I'm being frank, I'm not certain that Sanders would survive four years in office, which means that he's going to need a damn good VP before I'll even consider voting for him. I hate to rain on the Bernie Sanders parade but lets be realistic. A 74 year old self proclaimed socialist from Vermont is not going to win the presidency. The only reason it seems like he has a chance is because reddit's user base is predominately in their teens and 20s so there's a skew towards ultra liberal idealistic candidates."

With that said. I think that nothing at all is going to come of this. ATTC and other non-profit tissue banks legally provide human tissues (although they mostly trade in cell lines) for a fee. They come from somewhere, and tissue providers are allowed to get reimbursed for the costs of storage, shipping, etc.   While it really sounds to me like PP is structuring prices to make a profit, I think that it would be very easy to charge $X for packaging materials and $Y for storage and $Z for technician fees and make it come out to pretty much whatever they want without showing a profit. It is even possible that they really are being honest about it.   So, again, I would not be sad if the earth opened up and swallowed down every PP branch in the world, provided no people were harmed in the process, but I think it is possible that nothing illegal is happening and probable that this is going nowhere."

nottheonion,3d3pj3,MadBotanist,634,Mon Jul 13 19:55:25 2015 UTC,"Storytime.  I went to a murder mystery with my in-laws. One of the actors was a good looking young guy, around 19/20. Part of the game involved searching the characters, looking in their pockets for evidence. For the female actors, they basically let them check their jacket pockets, and then offered any stuff they missed to them - the people searching them all seemed sheepish. When it got to the young guy, a bunch of women volunteered, and the old guy in charge picked a drunk middle aged woman. The old guy then just left her to do it, encouraging her to be bad, and moved on. This woman started by feeling him up, patting him down, and didn't even look in his pockets. The whole room was cheering, and I looked at my wife, and she looked as horrified as I felt. This woman was draping herself around him, she squeezed his ass a bunch of times, and then she started cupping his junk. I mean that - she was full on cupping this kid's balls and cock openly, displaying it in front of the whole room and looking around and laughing.   He never gave any form of consent, was clearly uncomfortable and trying to redirect her to his pockets, and she was just meant to be checking his pockets as instructed. The guy was trying to keep smiling and play the part, but he didn't look comfortable. Finally, she stuck her hand down his pants, and he jumped away. Everyone laughed and the main old guy just moved her on, sat her down, and carried on as if it was all funny. The kid was OK as far as I could see, but I didn't get a chance to ask. Probably the most depressing part of it was when she went back to her seat, the guy exchanged a look with another young male actor next to him, looking sympathetic, that was so telling. It basically said, 'another one. Just part of the job'. I should have done something about it, but it was my mother and father in law's anniversary weekend, and they'd brought us all along - and if I'd objected in a room for of 60+ plus people who all thought it was great, I'd have ruined the entire thing. To be honest, I felt intimidated and shocked - I can't imagine how he felt. Selfish, I know, but that was what stopped me.  I complained to the hotel the next morning, when no one else was there."

nottheonion,3d3pj3,platoandfriends,15,Mon Jul 13 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think another thing is the upbringing. Girls are taught that their bodies are not to be touched. Boys aren't taught the same thing in the same way.  I know that most of my male friends would be uncomfortable with the situation, but would find no real harm in it - after all, there is no physical damage. It's just someone running their hands over me as a one-time occurrence. It's happened plenty of times before in many different situations. I would be very uncomfortable and tell the person to stop or most likely just step away in disgust, but I'm not in any immediate danger (note that this is just me, I am not speaking generally about men here). But that's not the same with girls. All throughout childhood (at least a typical childhood where I was raised) boys have plenty of physical contact - people throwing them, catching them, blocking them, shouldering them (mostly in sports, in case that wasn't obvious). Girls had this to a much lesser extent. At some point, boys are taught that they can no longer physically touch girls in the same way that they did before when playing tag or red rover or marco polo. It's as if any touch is a bad touch. Meanwhile on the other side/gender of things, guys aren't sexualized as much and so ""it's not the same"" - I don't think that men and women will ever be equal, because they're two different things (wow, looking back on that, that was worded poorly - what I mean is that for example a women can get pregnant and a man cannot. You can obviously not treat a pregnant woman in exactly the same manner as a man. And there is the issue - many people believe equality is in identical treatment, and because of the fundamental differences of gender, it isn't. But you can't easily quantify similar treatment, so identical it is). But they can have equal rights, that sure is possible.  As for /u/explain_that_shit's comment down below, I agree. I understand (as much as I can, I guess) why some people are more comfortable with the same gender examining them, but I think that it's indicative of the two desires that society has nowadays on this matter - gender equality, and gender rights. You've got people pushing for gender equality, but oh no that doesn't include being professionally treated by the opposite gender (unprofessional staff aside, for the moment, as well as the simple and reasonable request to have the same gender examiner for mere courtesy). I'm probably talking about this too much on my only reddit account, and will probably regret it. Oh well.  The take-home message is that I believe that both genders have the same rights to comfort and equality."

This involving educating staff, and making it clear to customers what is and isn't acceptable behaviour in person and in writing amongst other things.  5) contact the guest in question and inform her that other guests made these complaints and it was entirely unacceptable.

I love my band and the fans that show up all the time are almost always some of the greatest people I know, in their own fucked up and weird ways. We don't make much (if any) money, but we do it for fun and that's what counts.  Nearly every time we've had an issue with a patron though, it's always been a 40+ year old woman who had far too much to drink, wanders on stage and wants to dance on us, touch our gear, try to touch us inappropriately, etc. I've had at least three situations where some creepy meth-head looking older woman tells me she likes what I do with my fingers and grab me, while I'm playing a fucking song. (I'm the bass player.)  We're a small band. We don't have security, the bars we play at almost never have bouncers and the bar staff are usually just good looking women so they're not really going to get into a fight over a patron being creepy.  It's frustrating because I don't really know what to do other than ruin the entire set because I tell her to get the fuck off the stage and she throws a fit. We lose money that way, so it's easier to just turn my back and ignore her until the end of the song when I can ask her to get off the stage. At our favorite couple of local places, I try to recruit one or two of the regulars to grab anybody who bothers us while we're working and I pay them by buying a drink or two.  It's scary especially for me, because I've had issues where it became physical and I had to rely on my bandmates to help me hide because of these women. I'm 5'4"", I'm not a very big guy at all and I'm carrying expensive gear while being approached in the parking lot at 3am. Many of these women are bigger than I am, so the whole size disparity argument doesn't really sit well with me sometimes. ""You're stronger than she is! Just defend yourself!"" Yup, and I will lose when I get jumped by a bunch of idiots for pushing her away from me.  Anybody who says men will never get harassed by women are wrong.

At it the local chapter of the NAACP showed up. In support of maintaining the name. Why? When asked, they said read a history of the man.    I won't go into too much detail, but the kkk wasnt what it later became. As the grand Wizard he sought to dissolve the organization and did. (It later regrouped and became what we know). He was a big name in reunification and ultimately was not a champion for the freed slaves, but supported their cause publicly.  He found himself supporting his home much like Robert E Lee and was caught on the wrong side of history, but was ultimately a respectable man.  (Now, what the symbol of him has come to be is far from respectable...)  Edit: slavery was horrible. He was a slave owner. In that he is very hard to respect without a ton of study of that period.

Prior to the civil war most great Americans owned slaves and we don't blink about showing them respect.  It something that gets swept under the rug during history classes but Washington owned slaves and so did Jefferson.  Jefferson had the gaul to write 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.' while denying other men their unalienable right to liberty.  We respect great men based on how easily accessible and understandable their greatness is and usually with complete disregard for the evil shit they did.  The founding fathers are almost universally respected (in the US) because its super easy to understand that liberty and governmental representation are important.    Nathan Bedford Forest is a lot harder to respect outright because not many people understand that he's arguably a major progenitor of the blitzkrieg tactic, he saw that cavalry could change the tide of a battle with its ability to rapidly deploy troops to key areas in a battle or a campaign(homeboy was the furstest with the mostest.)  We don't respect great men because they didn't do evil shit (the vast majority of them did), we respect them because they did great things.  Best example, look at Genghis Khan, we all refer to that dude as 'Great King' in his own god damn language almost 1,000 years after his death and he might have been the single worst thing to have ever happened to the eastern half of the fucking planet."

Say something like: ""Although he fought on the side of the Confederacy, we honor this man for his work afterwards to help out the newly freed slaves.""

nottheonion,3d5inl,stinkyfastball,0,Tue Jul 14 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'd fight a cougar if I had to but I think your optimism may be misplaced. Without a weapon a cougar would make quick work of even a strong man. Their main food is deer, and I wouldn't want to fight a deer either. They only rarely ever kill humans because they don't try to fight us, and when confronted they tend to run rather then fight. Sort of like how if you run from a wild dog it will chase you, but if you charge it, it will likely run away. Except the cougars don't naturally try to chase man like dogs will. Not to mention humans are usually in groups and carry weapons and fire so they have learned to fear us.    Here is a video of a man fighting, and losing badly, to a cougars primary prey. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1A-qkLNijo  Consider the fact that you probably couldn't beat the cougars primary food source in a fight before claiming how easy they are to kill with a pen.    Here's another video. I would not want to fuck around with that deer, and the cougar makes quick work of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeOWbPBNYPE"
nottheonion,3d5inl,CassandraVindicated,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:07:36 2015 UTC,"I was going on the assumption that you weren't surprised with a neck shot right from the start. Not much you can do about that if they get their teeth in.  I never said it would be easy, in fact, I said it would likely cost you. Maybe I shouldn't have said it was ""almost a sure thing"" if you have a weapon, but your odds go up significantly.  My point was that it can be done; it has been done many times. There have only been three fatal cougar attacks in North America this century."
nottheonion,3d5inl,stinkyfastball,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, but that's because cougars would rather not fight people in the first place, not because they are easy to fight.  Same thing with black bears in canada, very few fatalities, but that doesn't change the fact that I wouldn't want to have to fight a black bear. In most cases people beat off the attacking bear with sticks, but realistically the bear is thinking ""fuck this shit, i'm dipping"". Without a gun/axe/spear or other actual weapon, there isn't a lot you could do to mortally wound a bear or a cougar. If it wanted to it could easily persist and get the kill. Its fortunate for mankind that these animals are easily deterred. I'm not trying to fear monger cougars, they certainly normally don't attack people, and if attacked of course you should fight back because it will very likely run away when you put up resistance, but still, I wouldn't want to be locked in a cage with one, that's for sure."
nottheonion,3d5inl,CassandraVindicated,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:27 2015 UTC,I'd never want to fight one either. You're right about mostly needing to dissuade them from continuing the attack; you don't have to mortally wound it.

nottheonion,3d4y8m,duckterrorist,23,Mon Jul 13 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"So here's the deal, there's 2 kinds of bankruptcy that people usually file. IANAL, so here's a layman's explanation:  Chapter 7 - Very fast, you declare the value of everything you own and everything you owe and the court takes your stuff and sells it. Your creditors (the people you owe) have to make do with the money that comes out of that. If it's enough money, yay for them!  Chapter 11 - Usually takes 3 years to settle. As soon as you file, all of your creditors (people you owe) basically have to fuck off until you get your shit together financially (they aren't allowed to try and collect from you, but interest still acrues). You can usually back out early if you're ready, otherwise, your creditors have to wait until you show up in court ~3 years later at which time, parts of your debt might get cancelled. At the very least, the court will probably allow you to propose a payment plan to repay the creditor.  Fiddy is using Chapter 11, most probably to screw his sex-tape lady-friend once again, except this time financially. She won't see a dime for at least 3 years, and even then, she'll probably be getting a monthly payment over a 5-10 year period..  Fiddy's probably fine financially this is clearly a legal strategy to avoid paying the full judgement.  He will have an ultimatum in the next 3 years at which point he will have a final opportunity to get rich or die tryin' where this situation is concerned."

It was a zealot pushing life after death as fact based on ""out of body experiences."" Anytime I asked a question or cast doubt on something she said she would cut me off and tell me to see her after class, so I couldn't spread doubt to anyone slightly less gullible. Everything she talked about she stated as though it was a proven and accepted fact, established in scientific literature, conveniently she didn't have any sources handy beyond the book which was basically just anecdotes.   http://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Investigation-Phenomenon-Survival-Bodily/dp/0062517392  When I came to her office with information from neuroscientists and philosphers who have disagreed with Moody she told me that the brain is just the radio that receives our spirit's ""energy"" and that the information I had was wrong and wouldn't be shared with the class.  The exam questions literally stated after half the questions. (According to the lectures) She knew what she was saying and asking people top regurgitate was not fact and could not be demonstrated beyond anecdotes and so everything had to be by the standard of ""the lectures.""   Example questions would be things like ""Does the human spirit persist beyond death (According to the lectures)?""  This was the only course I ever complained about, I notified the head of her Dept. and the Board of Trustees that this material was being taught as fact.

An extremely important discovery, absolutely. After that they found that pork and bovine inulins could be used for humans, I believe it was a private lab in California that figured out how to make the first human (synthetic) insulin.

Anyone not familiar with the story of the crazed racist Black Studies professor Leonard Jefferies at NYC's City College should really read up. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Jeffries   It's worth noting that this course is being offered through the anthropology department, not through any department related to  biomedical sciences.  If it's true that most of the students who took it had ""a strong biomedicine backgound"", it was probably very useful to them to get an inside view of the pseudoscience anti-vaccine movement.  I'd be a lot more worried about the effects on anthropology and other humanities majors, who would be much less equipped to see through the irrational claims.    Before pointing a finger at U of Toronto for this ignorance-promoting anti-vaccine course, we should take a long hard look at the bigger landscape of academia, in which humanities and social sciences departments in most schools are loaded with promoters of extremely biased, and largely ignorance-based political and social ideologies.

If they get a quick overview of it in school and then get some reading on how it's basically distilled bullshit entirely reliant upon the placebo effect, they'll be better able to engage with patients that actually believe in this stuff.   Writing all this reminds me of an astronomy professor I had back in college. The first day of class, before the first lecture even began, he wrote ""THIS IS NOT ASTROLOGY"" on the board, underlined it, and stared angrily at the class for a few seconds before inviting anyone interested in learning about astrological signs to kindly get the fuck out."

Your story of the terrible persecution of a florist who lost her job because of her christian beliefs is rife with the mental gymnastics fundamentslists use any time they are told that they are not special, and everyone doesn't have to follow their rules.   When your employer gives you a task to do, and you refuse to do it, they are free to fire you. This had zero to do with her beliefs, and everything to do with her refusal to perform her job. The fact that she disagrees with gay marriage is completely irrelevant. If her job is to make floral arrangements, she does not get to pick and choose which customers are served, her employer does. If she refuses to do what her job requires, and she is fired, this is not a violation of her religious freedom. It is dismissal for cause."

What if I opened a business and believed that Christians can only order peanut butter and jelly because I, in my heart of hearts, believe that they shouldn't be eating anything else? What if all businesses practiced this - in every state across the country. Your non Christian friends are served steak and given drinks at any restaurant at a discount. You are given peanut butter and jelly with no water at a premium with the attitude that you should be grateful you are even allowed in my restaurant. This is how discrimination works. Just because you have Christians making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in the kitchen does not make this an ethically sound situation. These are why laws are in place, at the Federal level - to protect the disenfranchised and minorities from this type of discrimination.  If you want to get together on Sunday and talk about how gays and lesbians are an abomination in the eyes of God, you are fully protected to do so by the U.S. Constitution. The instant that you start discriminating against a group of people in public space, that's when the laws kick in to protect their individual rights.

No, I don't think so.  It's called persecution, and it will continue to get worse for believers as we move forward, just as the Bible says it will.

This is no different than if another couple opens a business and decides it refuse services to a Christian people or groups. This type of legal precedent works both ways. The difference between the two is the latter does not happen. But if you go into business, you should familiarize yourself with U.S. Law (or at least the basics in the Constitution & amendments). Big Corporations are VERY careful on how they treat public space for this very reason.  Christians do need to share this country with non-Christians and strict doctrine has no place in public space. U.S. Laws are there to protect all individuals best it can. It took a long time to get civil rights just for women and minorities so we have a ways to go still.  If Christians are losing their jobs because of their faith, they should sue.  Its within their rights - if they actually have case they will win. I simply don't think this is happening otherwise it would be plastered all over the news.  Christians are human too and can say and do dumb things that get themselves fired (just like a non-Christian) that has nothing to do with their faith.

That's Snoop Dogg.  And what about William James Adams Jr.? Again no idea? He's better known as will.i.am.  Now a little more historic. What about Siddhartha Gautama? A lot of people in regions of Asia know him much better as [the] Buddha.  Josip Broz is the birthname of Tito, former president of Yugoslavia.  IceFrog is the internet identity of someone whose legal name we do not know.  Gloria Jean Watkins is well-known in her ideological circle, but mention the name and you'll see question marks appear above heads. Mention bell hooks, though, and the question marks disappear.  Not many people would know William I of Normandy. Call him a bastard or a conqueror, though, and the number of people that remember the name increases.  The same goes for Alexander III of Macedon, of course, better known as Alexander the Great.  A little more meta? Ben Eisenkop used to make the rounds here on reddit. I'm sure you know him. But who is he? I'll give you a hint. He's a scientist and he was banned for vote manipulation. Why, he is /u/unidan.  And the list goes on, and on, and on. For the entirety of human history, names have served as an identifier, not as a legal instrument. I live in a free country, and I suppose you do, too. Given this freedom, it should be entirely within my right to determine how I want to identify myself to the world.  I understand the use of legal names, but the law has absolutely nothing to do with people expressing themselves on Facebook. If everybody knows me as /u/Rubykuby and I want to be known as such, then fuck Facebook if they want to force a different identity upon me.  There are countless of reasons why someone might want to use a name different than the one that is on their passport. Maybe they don't like it. Maybe they want to make a clean break with their past. Maybe the name doesn't fit their identity. Maybe the name just isn't good. Maybe they were given a nickname by a friend, and the nickname gradually became their actual name. Maybe they are hiding from someone. Maybe they just like their new name better.  Facebook has absolutely no authority to determine how people identify themselves."

God save us if we're not allowed to criticise existing policies anymore. If that were the case, slavery would still be legal in, well, the entire fucking world.  But clearly you cannot understand that someone might carry a different name than the one on their passport. So I'll ask you this hypothetical question. If Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas Queen, Defender of the Faith wishes to sign up for Facebook, what should her name be? Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor? Should she throw a ""queen"" in there for good measure? Or can she simply be Queen Elizabeth II?  Perhaps we should look at her passport, then. Except ... she doesn't have a passport. Well fuck.  But she's not the only person in the world who doesn't have a passport. Should everybody who doesn't have a passport be banned from a social media website? What does having a passport have to do with talking to friends online? And what if the passport is wrong, such as the case with Mohammed, who has the first name ""FNU"" on his passport, because of an error in administration. Should Mohammed sign up as FNU on Facebook?  That's ridiculous."

There are circumstances where one's legal name can differ from birth name. Consider that some governments reject or modify tribal names, yet the person would still identify as their tribal name in their daily life despite having a possibly different name on their government documentation.  Consider that certain tones in how a name is written can also have implications, much like calling someone ""Johnathon Smith"" when they're known as ""Johnny Smith"", the former would sound like it's coming from a mother rather than the person themselves if they're known as the latter.  Consider that say an immigrant from the middle east to the US or Canada may render the English form of their name to better fit in with everyone else using the Latin character set, to which there are many arabic names that do not translate well to English due to the vast differences . Should these people be expected to use their arabic character set name that none of their friends can read or pronounce or even recognize?  Sure, I could see Facebook holding government documented names in record behind the scenes for accountability reasons, but to have those names publicized is unreasonable. It makes sense in a small scale with a small group of friends... say a small self-run forum that you host yourself, but it doesn't make sense on a multi-million user site to have those names attached to every post."

Facebook privacy settings have improved over time, but if someone's determined to get your information, they're meaningless. Most cases, Facebook's privacy settings are pretty much a placebo. All it takes is one of your family members to begin posting information about you under your name and there's nothing you can do to limit the spread of that information. Background check websites also routinely scrape Facebook for peritinent information on people and compile data using methods that are very hard to defend against if you're a user of any social networking site.  The only way privacy settings really work on Facebook is if you don't use the site for its intended purposes; Don't have any ""Friends""; Don't post on other people's walls/pages; Don't comment anywhere etc. The moment you post something outside of your profile, you become public.  I've done a few personal audits in my work where an inocculous comment like: ""I will be there"" to a few event pages (like concerts) in a geographically similar area can tell you that the person is most likely living in that region.  As far as blocking, blocking is something relevant to the 90's before the Internet and ""Real World"" really started mingling. Nowadays, blocking just leads to escalation. Someone finds you're in a specific city with a specific name? They'll try the phonebook, etc. It can become very expensive on your time and money.  I often tell people that using Facebook is bad for their privacy anyways. People often forget the ""Networking"" part in ""Social Networking"" where their information is relayed through their personal ""social network"" and all it takes is one leaky profile or set of lips and data's out there."

Most anti domestic violence ad are stunningly hetronormative and it gives the wrong idea to people that may be victims of this that they would not be taken seriously by the authorities etc. Infact two popular female basketball players were involved in such a situation and even the police had to be called, but few weeks later their wedding pictures was on people magazine like nothing happened. The whole incident was swept under a rug. Not saying we should be prying into people's personal business but if it was a hetro relationship there would have been an uproar and news outlets would have been on the case 24/7. We do need to have more awareness about domestic violence in same sex relationships... Whether you statistics support my earlier post or not."

Not reading a contract is not a valid legal argument. If the other party did what was reasonable to bring the terms to your attention, they are enforceable. Basically, as long as they made it clear that there ARE terms are you COULD have read them, they is enforceable.   Most contracts you enter into online will have a forum selection clause as well which defines the only legal jurisdiction in which one can settle legal disputes.

I don't think it's ok to assume there will be less cars on the road longterm because of the HOV lanes. Traffic was already bad before them, and car owning population isn't decreasing.   Where I live, the HOV lanes accommodate bus routes that would otherwise be stuck in the same gridlock.   Environmentally, they require very little resources to implement, even if it requires adding a whole lane, compared to LRT/Subway/rail. I think the biggest win is getting people concerned about transit. Love em' or hate em', the lanes do get people talking about better transit options, and perhaps even changing their habits."

Ideal state (encouraging carpooling) does not equal real state (the lane sits empty because people cant or wont).  Also in many places the hov rules are ignored and not enforced. Example is Nashville where i live.
nottheonion,3d063q,Kahoots113,6,Sun Jul 12 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think the ""common logic error"" is actually perceiving the lanes as empty. I regularly see cars in them, moving.... maybe the perception that they are empty is because there are fewer cars, hence more space?   I agree that HOV lanes don't create an ideal state for the majority of drivers. Will there ever be one perfect solution for getting individuals from A to B? I like to think it will require many different strategies, including HOV or similar, and even then it will be far from perfect.

This is fine, except the subject/target of consent is not specified. Was it to kiss? Lick? Stroke? It also doesn't specify a maximum time limit or other constraint. Use of a breast is also not always a requirement for Intercourse so checking for breast==null should be performed before attempting to use it. Any error code or exception is not handled.   int thrusts;   Uninitialized variable which will probably default to zero thrusts is this what was intended?   consent.ask(thrusts);    Based on a guess of the previous invocation of 'ask', it accepts a single parameter of type 'erogenousZones', yet here is attempting to use an integer. Even if the method was overloaded to accept an integer,  the subject or target of the consent has not been specified. (though you could imply that it is a 'penis' based on the name of the surrounding class). A better generic way would be to allow different objects to ""thrust"" at different targets, eg, Finger in mouth, or tongue in ear.

I understand the issues with rape and it's horrible that it happens, but these laws are only going to make it easier to mess up a guys life over what could be a simple misunderstanding.

nottheonion,3cxj8o,TaylessQQmorePEWPEW,51,Sun Jul 12 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"As many people have mentioned, proof of consent would be a huge difficulty.   Maybe they can make an app that works something like mojoupgrade.com where both people put in what they're interested in to see what the other person is up to do and use that as consent. They could have some pre-created ones for different situations like ""Girlfriend"", ""hot 1 night stand"", or whatever and have their selections pre-made. Then do a thumb print and a signature to show its actually them and you're good to go. It would be a bit annoying but would be better than illegally recording the whole thing.   Another thing that others haven't really talked about is defining sexual terminology. If person 1 thinks that a slang sexual term means one thing and person 2 thinks something else and gives consent, when person 1 does that action then person 2 can claim rape because that's not what they signed up for.   Lastly, this terrifies me that men could be railroaded even faster than they already can be currently. I totally support the idea behind this law that all people deserve to consent to any sexual activity they engage in but, in reality, this net is so wide that it will catch many more innocent people than serial rapists.   The article said that false allegations of rape occur at 2-8%. While this feels quite low to me (I used to be an RA), the result of this law will be almost a 100% conviction rate on those 8% of people accused of rape. Considering how many hundreds of thousands of college students there are and how many sexual acts happen between them, we are talking about thousands of people with bright futures ending up in jail or on a sex offenders registry. It might not be a life sentence but it will ruin the lives of those accused."

nottheonion,3cy206,Reeses007,3,Sun Jul 12 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"While that may be cool, an artificial neuron doesn't help people like airplanes or refrigeration or the automobile.  Norway is an oil state, Finland was dependent on the corporation Nokia to build up what they had, Iceland is a tiny island state that could function well under pretty much any form of government, and Switzerland is hardly socialist- they love capitalism, banking and large corporations. Poland was under a communist regime during the Cold War, but look how well they turned out.    http://www.studyabroad.careers360.com/top-100-engineering-colleges-world-2014  If you look at the list of top ten engineering colleges, six are American, three are British and one is Swiss. The first Swedish one comes in at... number 78.   In fact, if we go by population the ratio of Swedish to American top 100 schools should be 1:32, but instead it is more like 1:36. This is even more significant when you consider that a considerable majority of the American schools are ahead of the Swedish one.  One can hardly deny that top engineering colleges are some of the most vital assets to innovation. Artificial neurons mean shit if they can't be packaged and used in some way.   So while purely academic interests may still be incentivized in a socialist system (because they people researching them are motivated by knowledge and not by profit), innovation that actually matters (like having decent colleges, even if expensive) develops far better in a country that still has a profit motive for knowledge."
nottheonion,3cy206,Not_Bull_Crap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"You do realize there's still pay differences in socialist countries right? Janitors and doctors aren't paid the same if that's your thought process, so there's absolutely still pay incentive. The point of systems like this is to not allow 1% of the country to own 99% of the wealth and control the country, buy politicians, etc. (see Citizen United). And if anything, with college education being free I think that would drive more people to really do what they want to do, rather than being scared off by outrageous tuition and a 100k debt sentence. So while there is still pay incentives, there's also incentives to actually pursue what you want to pursue. (Not that isn't a option here in the states, but makes it far more readily available.  How artificial neuron development isn't innovation is beyond me. There's potential this could be used to treat a variety of mental/brain issues.   But this is just my viewpoint on the issue, to each their own (and I'm not saying ""I'm right, you're wrong"", again, just expressing my view).

Many, many important inventions came from the U.S. and other countries that don't have Nordic-style programs.  Those free colleges? They aren't as good as paid colleges in the U.S., at least when you consider actual education and not debt, and that's a fact.   Citizens United was a solid decision. I don't know about you, but I believe that people should have the right to make whatever political donations they want, or set up whatever campaigns. It is a logical extension of free speech, given that speech can't really be spread without using funds. I also believe that groups of people obviously have the same rights as the people within them- whether those groups are corporations, churches, nonprofits, political parties, the media, or something else entirely."
nottheonion,3cy206,Not_Bull_Crap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"I dont have such a black and white view of it. Economically capitalism works and will likely always have a place in functioning society. However the pursuit of wealth is too often glorified in our culture although it is not that pursuit itself that is negative it is the priority it is given. Corporations are neither inherently good or bad they are mixed bag. A single corporation is made up of many different people with different goals and priorities but frequently its only the ones who increase profits who are put in decision making rolls where those who increase quality, morale, and ethical responsibility are left powerless. This isn't a problem with capitalism the economic system its a problem with the philosophy of capitalism which needs to be tempered by morality and rationality for it to really be valuable to us. In the end what is the point of wealth and technology if the cost is a part of our soul?"

He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature.  Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the ""holding temperature"" of its coffee.   Source"

Thing is though, if you have to pay for medical expenses then even squeezing your head a bit too hard when you go for a shit could bankrupt you.  In that kind of context, if you can find someone to blame for whatever medical expenses you have, however good the pretext is or not, you're going to sue and with things like contingency fees it's likely you can find a lawyer willing to help if the case has some merit.  Whereas, somewhere like Britain when they talk of ""compensation culture"" it really is criticising people who are seen as trying to profit from falling down or tripping up.  When many people would just get up and dust themselves off and perhaps blame themselves for being clumsy. Worst case if they needed a trip to the doctor or an accident and emergency hospital the costs are already covered by the national health service.  The downside these days is how ridiculous schools, councils and other public / government organisations need to be to avoid being sued - like banning certain playground games or activities or keeping kids indoors because there's a thin layer of snow on the ground.

nottheonion,3cvftz,truthink,5,Sat Jul 11 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah what happened was one group of cops walked up to him after he played the national anthem and told him to move to the sidewalk. So he did that and played one verse from Stranglehold by Ted Nugent and a different group of cops came up and arrested him, apparently unaware that the other cops told him he was ok if he moved off the street. Of course this all happened in a nice, normally quiet beach town where the cops don't really have anything better to do. They took him downtown and, because he was cooperative, they did not put him in jail but they did uphold the charge.   I'll post an update here if I hear anything. This story got a lot more attention than we expected. I bet he'd be down to do a casual AMA if there is any interest in that"

For example, in the US we have programs to educate people inorder to give them skills, this way they go from being an unskilled worker to a skilled worker amd thefore will have more employment options. I agree with this it is a good idea. On the otherhand programs such as welfare that give people X amount of dollars a week i do not agree with. Personally i think that money could be put to better use, such as more money in our housing programs or food stamps. The idea of giving people plain money does not sit well with me for various reasons. As a whole i think social programs are good because they help people get on their feet and become productive members of society (aka get a job and start paying taxes). I dont think we need more of them tho, i think what we have is good but is so corrupt and bloated that they arent as effective as they should be. Instead of drawing up new programs we should refine the ones we already have. But thats just my 2 cents"

Trump believes Obama is from Kenya - because his country would never legitimately elect a black man, or even let one into the White House.  Trump believes we should just bomb everyone who disagrees with US Policy.  Trump is in favor of what he calls ""traditional marriage"", even though he's had multiple divorces.    Anybody who criticizes that is just making him a victim of the liberal media.  There is no attempt at consistency or rigorous thinking.  That's just for wimpy eggheads.  The base eats this crap up.  Trump IS the Republican Party and that is why they have 17 candidates running.  After the Southern Strategy succeeded and Reagan convinced everyone that welfare queens were eating steak and lobster on the taxpayer dime Republicans lost touch with reality.

However, this poll is only indicative of 452 total votes; moreover, it's taken specifically from the website YouGov.com, which mostly takes research from people who are already have memberships to the website.  The poll's survey was asked only to registered Republicans and Independents. These particular individuals are obviously interested enough to voice their opinions online by logging into a survey, and thus the poll itself has to be taken with a grain of salt. It's not truly representative of the entirety of the U.S., or even necessarily the majority of registered Republicans/Independents, but specifically of those who already answer YouGov polls on a regular basis.  In other words, while it isn't necessarily a terrible sample size, there are a lot of things to consider about the polling mechanism itself that suggest this may not be the way real-world Republican voters might feel, nor is it truly indicative of the way U.S. politics is shaping up.  There may be a more reputable poll that comes along further down the line that suggests that this is an accurate assessment, but on the whole, it carries little weight."

Basically, arguments FOR same sex marriage, no-fault divorce and other ""non-traditional"" stuff, argues that it don't affect anyone beside those that the law changes directly talk about (for example same sex couples, or couples that want to divorce).  The arguments against it, is that although it ""seemly"" affect only a subset of a population, it DOES affect the whole country, with cultural changes, changes in birth rates, changes in how children are raised (example: every country that had no-fault divorce law passed, had an explosion of single-parent children and children raised with help of nannies).  The ""progressive"" argument is that such laws benefit individuals, the other side, it is that such laws damage society as whole (even if for many individuals it would be better).  Also this is why when both sides are arguing frequently they don't get even near understanding each other, they are discussing a single subject, but with very different aims, to a progressive person, the conservative argument, that defends something that declines individual happiness, is wrong, to a conservative person, something that risks the country long term stability is wrong, but frequently neither of them state that explicitly, to them it is a obvious thing that is ""background"" to the conversation.  A metaphor would be two people arguing, one defending that oranges are better than bananas because of their acid taste, the other defending bananas because a sweet taste is better, without any of them realizing the orange defender prefers acid taste in first place, and the banana defender prefers sweet taste in first place."

(KABC) --  Several hours after dropping his car off at a Nissan dealership, an employee at a Taco Bell in Moreno Valley found two mechanics in his vehicle in the drive-thru lane.  ""I was just livid in my mind, you know, having something like that happen to you,"" Randy Jones said.  He had taken his Nissan 350Z to the Raceway Nissan dealership in the 6000 block of Sycamore Canyon Boulevard in Riverside earlier in the day to have some work done.  ""My heart was racing because I'm like I'm not paying them nearly $300 just to drive from Riverside to Moreno Valley in my vehicle,"" he said.  The dealership told Eyewitness News the mechanics did violate policy. Their standard test-drive route is 4.8 miles, and the two mechanics drove Jones' car a distance of close to seven miles.  Raceway Nissan did not want to appear on camera, but the service manager told Eyewitness News he's bent over backward to make Jones happy, and that the two mechanics have since been fired. Raceway Nissan towed Jones' car to another dealership, where the work was completed for free.  ""They broke a contract,"" Jones said. ""At the end of the day, I don't feel like they did me a favor, I think they gave me what was owed to me."""

OTOH, my 98 Silverado 1500 with a short bed is rated for 2200 pounds of weight in the bed (so much for the 'half ton' designation), which would probably be about at it's max.  The humans in there would displace roughly the same amount that they took up so it would be pretty close.

When I was growing up, my mom had this 24 pound orange tabby who hated dogs, would chase them and beat the living hell out of them. That cat simply did not give a fuck. Anyway, we took him to camp and a relative brought their dog without telling us before hand, so naturally we kept the cat in a room away from the dog because we all knew what a shithead he would be if he saw the dog. Someone ended up leaving the bedroom door open and the cat went nuts, absolutely lost it's shit when it saw the dog, attached itself to the dog with such ferocity that my mom tried to kick it off, which ended up making the cat turn it's attention towards my mom's leg. He literally attacked her leg and it took myself and a grown man to get him off of her leg. She ended up needing over 40 stitches.  TLDR - Don't underestimate how vicious cats can be.

This works for both those who hate him and those who agree with him.  The media loves them some The Donald.  He's a 24 hours news cycles teaser gold mine. His corporate mogul status grants him a special spot where no matter what comes out of his mouth, there will be a large sector who will instantly hate him.  Powerful feelings one way or the other generate interest and that equates to dollars.  Say what you will about The Donald, but you can't listen to one of his tirades and just say ""Meh"".

That's why the training is there.  Novel concept, I know.   For adolescents between the ages 15-24, suicide is the third leading cause of death.   That is a mental health issue, not a gun issue.   General consensus among mental health experts note that the longer a person has time to consider self harm, the less likely they are to commit it. They often cite guns as being detrimental to someone considering self harm as it requires the least amount of preparation of any form of self harm to commit.   You act like there will be no supervision and no management of the training.  Any teacher training people in something like this knows the risks.     ...and you want to provide them with more guns?   Yes.  Criminals will acquire guns regardless of what the laws are.  Gun control laws only take guns away from law-abiding people, and  cripple their ability to learn responsible gun use."

The way your government has been acting lately, I'm sure they want all avenues of citizen revolt to be as closed off as possible.  So, yay for your disarmament.  /s   I'm not saying there won't be any supervision, I'm saying there can't be constant supervision. It's similar to how the majority of infant deaths and deaths by drowning and electrocution have been attributed to a short lapse in supervision.   You cannot prevent every accident. Accidents happen without guns.  Taking away guns will not magically take away possibility of death or injury.   That 80% I mentioned, not accident related, those numbers were related to suicide.   Again, that is a mental health issue, not a gun issue.   Regardless of it's effectiveness as a mass shooting counter measure, by increasing the amount of guns available to adolescents you are enabling suicide.   And by decreasing the amount of guns, you are enabling  tyranny and murder.  At least suicide is a choice."

Calling them names on the internet, or the implication of force to be used if they cross the final line?  History is more full of examples of the latter.   but taking away guns, will magically take away the possibility of getting shot.   One might think so, but there's this inconvenient thing called the black market, and also the fact that criminals get a gun when they want a gun.  I heard one story of a guy stealing one from a park ranger.  There is always a way.  You can even 3d print them now.  Gun control laws have good intentions, but are ineffective.   Disarmament is in the best interest of national mental and physical health, that is the point I was making.   Disarmament is mostly irrelevant to mental and physical health.  What you need to fix that problem is mental health services, medical care, and safety training.   Murder rates have decreased in every nation that has disarmed. As far as tyranny goes, if you think your rebel militia armed with M16s stands a chance against the strongest military power in the world, then you're deluding yourself. You can be nuked, from space, with iPhones ha ha.   The military comes from the people, and would be very reticent to shoot their own.  A nuke is powerful, but wouldn't kill everyone before some very important people got seriously hurt from millions of armed, angry citizens, very likely some military mixed in."

nottheonion,3cjbma,GodOfAllAtheists,37,Wed Jul 8 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"The issue here is that children can't consent. Having an attraction doesn't condone non-consensual actions.

So if (the majority of) straight and gay people can avoid performing rape, sexual assault, or invading the privacy of people who have not consented, we can expect the same of pedophiles.  Basically if it's a reasonable expectation for, say, straight men to not install shower cams in the houses of attractive women, then it's also a reasonable expectation for a pedophile to not possess child porn.

Recent research, while often limited to sex offenders — because of the stigma of pedophilia — suggests that the disorder may have neurological origins. Pedophilia could result from a failure in the brain to identify which environmental stimuli should provoke a sexual response. M.R.I.s of sex offenders with pedophilia show fewer of the neural pathways known as white matter in their brains. Men with pedophilia are three times more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous, a finding that strongly suggests a neurological cause. Some findings also suggest that disturbances in neurodevelopment in utero or early childhood increase the risk of pedophilia. Studies have also shown that men with pedophilia have, on average, lower scores on tests of visual-spatial ability and verbal memory."

From what I hear, in the US, if you are convicted of pedophilia related crimes, you serve your sentance as dictated by the court, then when you leave prison, you are confined to a special institution that is meant to ""treat"" pedophiles, indefinitely.  You can either co-operate with treatment, which probably ends in them telling you that to leave you have to take chemical castration medication, or you can refuse to co-operate with treatment, which most do, and they'll just lock you up for the rest of your life.  Alan Turing, probably one of the most important person in the history of computer science, was chemically castrated after the police found out he was a practicing homosexual, back when it was still illegal in the UK. He was found dead two years later and the inquest found it was suicide. His death is widely attributed to be a direct result of how he was treated...  I'm not saying pedophiles aren't twisted dangerous people. Many of them are psychopaths who will lie and manipulate to get what they want, but I think treating pedophilia as a crime is wrong. Pedophilia is a mental sickness. Child molestation is a crime.  The documentary on the US pedophile ""colony"" i saw made it feel like this wasn't being done to try to help people manage and deal with what they were, it was about locking them up and controlling them. I don't think the place actually wanted any success stories for ""treatment"" because if treatment and rehabilitation worked to a satisfactory standard, it meant rehousing pedophiles in a community somewhere and they didn't want to deal with the PR backlash."

While I understand punishing those who support the sick industry of creating it, setting up a system where they could come for treatment and therapy if they come forward for help instead of indiscriminately punishing them would probably be best for all of society.  Imagine you were abused once and kept having confusing and conflicting thoughts about it. One day, you decide to do a quick search for images, and, bam, you're a criminal. Now you get stuck in a rut. You know it's wrong, but it's therapeutic in a way and you're scared to talk to anyone about it because you'll be seen a sick criminal.   That kind of untreated problem leads to worse behaviors in some, when access to mental healthcare may have been able to fix it.

I remember an early MJ initiative on the Cal ballot during my youth.   American popular support for entirely removing legal restrictions and punishments on marijuana is new on the broad level. I'd be very interested in poll data from before the past decade where most Americans, or even most Californians, supported full legalization and taxation of marijuana. The ""moralists"" have been in charge in America for a very, very long time.  The cultural mores and moral panic that led to marijuana (and cocaine, and actually Prohibition itself) becoming illegal in the first place found the highest levels of support among the emerging middle class. While various business leaders with investments in the cause do their best to influence the matter, these laws were largely passed before ""Pig Pharma"" was the institution it became in modern times. The stricter punishments added during the Reagan 80s were also widely supported by the population; the prison-industrial complex sprung up as a result of the changes in laws, largely, rather than being an instigator.  I'm not arguing that our system isn't super fucked up, or that the combination of money and power is dangerous and counterproductive to the will of the people. My main point is that ""money"" isn't what drives policy; money influences particular outcomes, but large-scale movements in policy typically align with popular support. With drugs and prostitution, our current policy is definitely aligned with the popular sentiment of the era of their passing."

The youngest of the siblings is nine years old, regardless of the reason for them choosing not to maintain a relationship with the father, there is no law against it, nor is it lawful for them to recieve 9 years in prison for this.  Now look at that line again, part of it sticks out:   or until they attempt to have a relationship with their father.   Essentially, the father now has power of imprisonment over his children. At any stage he can inform the court that they have formed a stable relationship and they will be released. However, if the father protest this immediately it would mean they wouldn't recieve prison time at all, which any sane/loving parent would likely do.  This suggest that the father was content with this outcome, which reflects poorly on the judge. A domestic squabble such as this, isn't infact against the law, the children have been charged with contempt of court, which is incredibly difficult to prove. Essentially, statements made by the children need to be proven as a lie. The children were on trial for defying a court order to see their father, it is impossible to understand how such an order could be legal and imposed.   Gorycyca berated the older child, telling him that she doubted he had a very high I.Q. because he continued to defy her court order to have a relationship with his father   For the Judge to make such a harsh ruling on what is clearly already a very traumatic period in their lives, is unimaginable. It's understandable that many reditors have questioned her sanity but I believe there may be a conflict of interest or perhaps an instance of corruption, which the judges statements support when stated:   You, young man, have got it wrong. I think your father is a great man who has gone through hoops for you to have a relationship with you.   The judge relied on testimoneys more friends and colleagues of the father to judge the character of the father and came to the conclusion that a relationship between his children  and himself should be mandatory by law with punishment of up to 9 years in prison.  TL;DR: The judge is pretty much Juror 3 from the play twelve angry men."

The argument is that it 'promotes critical thinking' when in reality it's simply a thinly-veiled tactic to resist the inconvenient truths found in modern scientific discovery.  Just because someone has a teaching license doesn't mean they should be allowed to teach whatever the fuck they want, without regard for the truth.

The legend of Vlad the Impaler (a bona fide historical person) goes along that after fighting the heathens to the south Vlad returns to his castle to find his fields burned and his wife raped and murdered while he was away on his crusade. He curses God and defiles his temple, and as a punishment God curses him to walk the land forever but to never again feel the sun's warmth or enjoy the taste of food or wine. The story of Cain being the first vampire became popular due to Vampire: the masquerade, although it is based somewhat in apocryphal Christian/gnostic texts. There is also (I just learned googling) a fair number of theorists who suppose that Judas might have become the first vampire after killing himself following his betrayal of Jesus, although D&D leads me to believe that he would more likely become a ghast or a wight. Dungeons and Dragons is actually a pretty fair amalgamation of various world beliefs regarding the supernatural, as it has been collected from the various mythologies and fantasy stories of the worlds different cultures. In d&d the first vampire was a fallen paladin who cursed his God, much like the tale of Vlad Tepes."

When I was around 17 (I think, I'm 25 now), just after a big breakup, and I was off for my summer holidays. I was playing atleast 14-18 hours a day of WoW, barely ate anything away from my computer and didn't leave the house for about 3 months.   I started to realise how bad it was because I could no longer leave the house at all. I'd sit looking out the window at the people I used to hang around with but I couldn't bring myself to leave the house. If I stepped outside at all I started to feel dizzy and unwell so would immediately go back inside.   I completely stopped playing games because I wanted to go out to see my friends but I still couldn't do it. There was about another 2-3 weeks of me staying around the house unable to leave before I managed to bring myself to text a friend and see if they wanted to come over just to talk for a while.   I still couldn't leave the house, I would just stand at my front door and talk to them there, after a while say goodbye and head back in. I continued this for another week or 2, before my friends finally convinced me to head out with them.   It was very difficult to get over but thanks to my friends, and my need for contact with the outside world, I got better. Have never felt it that bad again but still sometimes if I don't leave the house for a couple of days I start to feel that way again, I know not to let it stop me."

I really hate how reddit jumps on a bandwagon even when we only have one side. We should all know how dumb parents can be by now.   Andrew Nussbaum, a lawyer who serves as a hearing examiner for several school systems surrounding Washington, rendered a 30-page opinion Monday and agreed that principal Sandra Blondell of Park Elementary School in Anne Arundel County, Maryland acted properly when she removed the boy from school.   Sauce 1   In a 30-page opinion, hearing examiner Andrew W. Nussbaum supported a principal’s assertion that the suspension was based on a history of problems, not the pastry episode. “The evidence is clear that suspension is used as a last resort,” Nussbaum wrote.  In Nussbaum’s opinion, dated June 26, he rejected arguments from the boy’s family that the school overreacted and that the suspension arose from a bias against guns. The father said he was told the day that the boy was suspended that it was for playing as if he had a gun, not for ongoing problems.   Nussbaum wrote: “As much as the parents want this case to be about a ‘gun,’ it is, rather, a case about classroom disruption from a student who has had a long history of disruptive behavior and for whom the school had attempted a list of other strategies and interventions before resorting to a suspension.”   Nussbaum said he was convinced that “had the student chewed his cereal bar into the shape of a cat and ran around the room, disrupting the classroom and making ‘meow’ cat sounds, the result would have been exactly the same.”   Nussbaum also said he found it troubling that the family allowed news media to attend the student’s hearing, noting the possibility that the child’s reputation would be tarnished.    Sauce 2  Note: I removed some paragraphs of what the family lawyer said back and what the author thought needed added in about guns in general."

But maybe it was just Georgia joining the confederates because of slavery? Let's hear from Mississippi (again, 2nd sentence in the document):   Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.   South Carolina:   increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery   Virginia:   the Federal Government, having perverted said powers, not only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern Slaveholding States.   Texas:   maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits   In total the word ""slave"" appears 83 times across those 5 short documents, with Texas having arguably the most racist wording. But I can see how the people of Texas can get confused about the cause of the war.."
nottheonion,3cgrka,Sphinxer,4,Wed Jul 8 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"I actually just went and read it, they talk about slavery a lot, but they also talk a lot about their perceived slights at the hands of the federal government in the form of special treatment of business interests of the north that came at the expense of the south.   They also talk about how it was pervieved by them that the northern states (and people) were becoming hostile to them (I would say rightfully so, but regardless). For example they talk about how their public officials, or southern residents accompanied by slaves were sometimes violently attacked when travelling through the north.  THis in fact goes deeper than what you have led on.   http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html?referrer=https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/3cgrka/texas_officials_schools_should_teach_that_slavery/"
nottheonion,3cgrka,dcman00000,0,Wed Jul 8 18:47:26 2015 UTC,It's all still about slavery though. The 'special treatment' for northern businesses were about laws that benefited non-slaveholders.

So let me say that again, slavery was the primary reason. In fact the civil war may have started anyways even without these relatively minor side shows.

Taking away slavery, which was a fundamental part of the southern economy, was considered a property rights violation and threatened the structure of their lifestyle to the Confederate states."

Famous for ""Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.""

nottheonion,3cgrka,IdlyCurious,2,Wed Jul 8 11:14:23 2015 UTC,"Both comments are correct. The basis of State's Rights in the early Confederacy was centered on their most intrinsic tool, the 'old-world' conception of slavery. States were successful in their economy through slavery because it was acceptable dogma. Necessarily the Northern economy valued this utility negatively, and thus relations began to fracture. The confederacy was built around slavery, which deserved reproach, but its split was not necessarily moral or even political- but simply deterministic."

I'm sorry what? Let's leave the ""government crown"" part alone for now, even though that's hilarious on it's own. Substituting ISIS for British mercenaries?

Wearing a sexy or revealing outfit at a friends get together is enough to get your teaching contract voided in some areas of the photo is posted on face book.  Campaigning for a political cause can be cause for censure (good luck proving it though).  If a parent doesn't like a teacher because their precious, perfect child never turned in his/her homework and fails, then the parents will try to get the teacher fired.  Meanwhile, you can look at photos of the parents doings and find the same exact things posted on facebook.  Showing her ass when she's not at work can get her terminated.  This is a reasonably new development because insane parents are stalking teachers and the friends of teachers on Facebook to get them terminated.  There are teachers I know who were fired for pictures posted on Facebook.  Two of them don't even have a Facebook account but happened to be at a friends party when pictures were taken in a private home, which were then tagged with their names.  It's not worth it to teach if you get fired for drinking alcohol in a revealing outfit at a house party in a private house.

nottheonion,3c9dvu,MaxFreedomMoussa,28,Mon Jul 6 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost nothing in your comment.  Prison is supposed to be a place to house criminals, in an attempt to punish them and rehabilitate them. By denying a criminal any attempt of rehabilitation and only punishment will, as studies show, only lead to recriminalization. Essentially if the way he says he is treated is true and continues, if he gets out, he will be MORE likely to recommit crimes, such as the one he did. Which no sane person would say that they want him to do.  Mercy is giving leniency above and beyond what is called for. Getting a Fair Trial with Due Process is not mercy, it is a requirement to determine his guilt. If we could not ensure he is treated fairly by the law, then even if he is guilty he should not receive the punishment because the court was unfair. Denying a fair trial to some will always lead to doing so for more people, this has been proven through out history that if the courts do not treat people fairly it will only lead to violence.  If the prison is keeping him detained in a way differently than other similar criminals, he is by definition being treated cruelly. Justice is never about vengeance or punishment it is ensuring that fairness and equality are preserved when making a decision."

Here, usually there's both a ""minimum"" and ""maximum"" jail time for a given sentence. After the minimum, the person gets a hearing by a parole board, who have the option to either free the person or leave them in prison, depending on circumstances. After the first opportunity, there's a regular schedule of parole hearings, generally once a year.  For instance, someone convicted of manslaughter might be sentenced to six years, but be up for parole in 3. Decisions are typically based on the person's behavior in prison, their status outside (such as whether it's a first offense), the severity and circumstances of the crime, and other factors.   Sentences without the possibility of parole are usually reserved for particularly serious cases, such as first degree premeditated murder committed while in the act of another felony (such as robbery or rape), when the offender has a significant criminal history, or murders in which there was particular evidence of premeditation. Only about 2.2% of current US prisoners are in prison without parole. That said, Breivik would certainly have qualified."

While I don't quite agree with her response, she does have a point. It's pretty petty to go to a concert just to fly flags with shit against the performer on them. And what a waste of time, for you to spend your night around said performer when you obviously can't stand him.    The alleged owner of the flag isn’t happy, either. Speaking to NME, a festival-goer known simply as Aoibheann said she and her friends were “gutted” to discover their flag had been stolen and claimed that its removal made finding their tent far more difficult late at night. “I don’t care who you are, you have no right to steal my stuff and vandalise it. Get off your high horse and stop nicking things.” Explaining the motivations behind the flag, Aoibheann said she and her fellow punters had no intention of taking the flag to West’s performance.   They were ""gutted"". They truly thought they would be treated with more respect than that /s ...Get off your high horse and stop writing ""FUCK [artist name here]"" at the concert of said artist. I mean, again, if you hate 'em so much don't spend money on tickets to watch 'em. And if your sole purpose for attending the concert is to spew fucks, you need something better to do."

I don't believe that they made it innocently with no intention of waving it sometime during his concert because that would just be a new kind of stupid.  But whether they did or not is not even the point; it's the fact that they made that sort of thing. I've just never understood people devoting so much time towards something/one that they seem to hate. It's petty.

On Sunday, the alligator, anywhere from 8-feet to 11-feet long, swam within 30 feet of the dock. On Wednesday, it got right up against the marina's seawall.  But that didn't stop 12-year-old Bryan Jeffrey Griffin from plunging into his swimming hole late in the evening, near the marina where fisherman routinely clean their fish and sometimes throw the remains into the water. Even when his two friends pulled him from the river after spotting the alligator close at hand, Bryan jumped right back in. When his friends, including 14-year-old Justin VanGorder, tried pulling him out again, Bryan hit them and told them he wanted to swim. He splashed around for a few more seconds and got about 20 feet from shore.  ""We saw gators all day,"" said Justin. ""Every time we saw them, we would get out of the water."" Justin said he and the other boy saw some alligators and got out of the water, but Brian wouldn't get out. ""We screamed at him to get out, but he wouldn't,"" Justin said.

Benzene is a notorious cause of bone marrow failure. Substantial quantities of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data link benzene to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and bone marrow abnormalities.[52][53] The specific hematologic malignancies that benzene is associated with include: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).[54] The American Petroleum Institute (API) stated in 1948 that ""it is generally considered that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene is zero.""[55] The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) classifies benzene as a human carcinogen. Long-term exposure to excessive levels of benzene in the air causes leukemia, a potentially fatal cancer of the blood-forming organs. In particular, Acute myeloid leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (AML & ANLL) is not disputed to be caused by benzene.[56] IARC rated benzene as ""known to be carcinogenic to humans"" (Group 1). Because benzene is ubiquitous in gasoline and hydrocarbon fuels are in use everywhere, human exposure to benzene is a global health problem. Benzene targets liver, kidney, lung, heart and the brain and can cause DNA strand breaks, chromosomal damage, etc. Benzene causes cancer in animals including humans. Benzene has been shown to cause cancer in both sexes of multiple species of laboratory animals exposed via various routes.[57][58] Some women who inhaled high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries. Benzene exposure has been linked directly to the neural birth defects spina bifida and anencephaly.[59] Men exposed to high levels of benzene are more likely to have an abnormal amount of chromosomes in their sperm, which impacts fertility and fetal development.[60] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene#Health_effects"

That was a huge factor in the rise of Fascism & if you read some commentators of the Greek situation I feel there are some similarities; that the current situation is all their fault & they should suffer to rectify it.   I think Fascism is an understandable response if you feel the Democratic process is failing you, that your countrymen are idiots/sheep that need a strong ruler to unite them & lead you. The Golden Dawn have gained support in Greece in recent years so the trend is there.  I just think people like to think the worse is behind us & we have 'moved on' as a society, but the Peace & Prosperity after the Second World War is a historic anomaly; so I think we need to look at what has prevented the usual wars & conflicts that were so historically common in Europe & make sure that we don't allow short sighted blame to pull the continent into another war."

They're no different than the Republican Party in that aspect. And the often anti muslim remark. That again is not different than the Tea Party.

nottheonion,3c06ua,Low_discrepancy,4,Sat Jul 4 08:27:12 2015 UTC,"This comment is bullshit.    First, European is a bad way to look at it since the cultural and political differences between the various countries are massive. There's fairly little overlap between Norwegian and Greek culture and political situation.  Second, the difference in the way politics is done in Europe overall makes smaller groups come up. No shit the US doesn't have a nazi party being elected, they only have TWO PARTIES (well they have more but only 2 that actually matter in any way whatsoever). If you can't get above 50% support for your position, you don't get a vote (yes yes, oversimplification, you get the point). Meanwhile the cutoff for at least minimal political representation in most of Europe is between 2 and 4 percent (depending on country). The list of countries that couldn't show to a 4% fuckhead population is pretty fucking short.  Third, you are lying. Some few countries have neonazi parties with enough votes to get on parliament (or that country's equivalent), but even in the worse cases of that we're still talking <10% (like Greece's golden dawn party). Most of the Europe doesn't have a neonazi party with any power at all, bigger right side parties having eaten up any votes they might otherwise have gotten.    And fourth, since you brought up the Swizz. The swizz federal police have released numbers on the extreme right in their country, it's 0.025% of the population that can be described as ""far right"" and ""far right sympathizers"".  You are a liar, that is all."

nottheonion,3c06ua,potentialhijabi1,3,Fri Jul 3 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"This is partially to do with the language IIRC. Basically the Icelandic language is really grammar heavy, but it is also unusual in that typically there are no loan words, with new terms such as 'television' being translated using previously existing words. The word for 'television' (sjònvarp) actually translates as 'seeing projection' for example.   Similarly, grammatical case is important in Icelandic and so it would be a nightmare of an issue if names that couldn't be declined to the grammar rules of the language, especially for computers and digital input, were accepted. Hence why it's simply easier to have a list of approved names, so no disputes happen.   You can however request a name that's not on the approved list if it conforms to Icelandic grammar."

It didn't have that with same-sex couples. With multi-partner couples, however, it does have plenty of compelling interests. Half of the tax code is written for married people. The sex of the individuals doesn't make a difference, but the number of individuals does. Laws written for two people may not work for, say, 50 people. And even if they would, there's no way a court could make such a hefty economic assessment.   Moreover, spousal privilege laws would be immediately abused. Crime syndicates would suddenly marry up, thus preventing any chance of anyone testifying against anyone else. We could simply do away with spousal privilege, but that would fundamentally weaken the bonds of marriage. As far as I'm concerned, spousal privilege is actually the best thing marriage has going for it on the legal landscape.   Edit: In case there's any confusion, these arguments do not apply to laws criminalizing bigamy. Well, they do, but in reverse. The government doesn't have any compelling interest in outlawing bigamy or cohabitation of multiple partners. And even if it did have some interest, it would still be a violation of the First Amendment's protection of religion. When challenged, these laws tend to fall quickly (such as in Utah in 2013). Interestingly, I suspect a lot of people support the legal argument against criminalization of bigamy but not the exact same legal argument against legalization of bigamy."

Tax laws have specific economic goals in mind. Changing the entire basis of thousands of laws will radically upset the economy. That's more than a compelling governmental interest.    Spousal privilege already generally doesn't apply if the communication was made to plan or further a crime.   That will be up to the government to prove in the first place. Spousal privilege will prevent that sort of information from becoming known in the first place. Moreover, not all communication between criminals regards the planning and furtherance of a crime.

A 10 year sentence doesn't just go and become a 20 year sentence on someone's suggestion or say so.  Being committed to a hospital is a whole other thing.  You are generally committed until someone with an expensive degree decides you are fit for society.  They can renew your commitment until the day you die.  People have this Hollywood idea that you can fake crazy and skip out of the hospital in 6 months.  Go ahead and try it and report back about how it goes.  First you get evaluated for competency.   The vast majority of people are eventually found competent to stand trial, though it may take several months.  Then you have your day(s) in court.  Simply losing your shit one day does not get you out of facing the music.  Now all the people that you spent the last 8 months trying to bamboozle get to testify.  If you think it's easy to keep up the charade long enough to fool people who have done this for a living for decades you might actually be crazy enough to pull this off.  Most people in this position actually end up in plain ol' prison.  You have to be irrideemably crazy to get committed, and once you are, they own you.  Now you get to wonder if you will be free forever.  Recommitment hearings are a lot like parole board hearings.  You show up, you listen to hospital staff explain why you can't be released, you get recommitted.  Rinse and repeat.  Yeah, man.  It's a breeze."

An owner getting less than FMV is the exception rather than the rule in the jurisdiction where I live, even where entire properties are taken. It depends where you are and what governmental body you are dealing with, but a property owner here can request (and such a request is granted as a matter of course) a jury trial in a condemnation case if they do not feel the offer is fair.

nottheonion,3brg9h,BigBankHank,12,Wed Jul 1 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yep. One of Obama's victories in my opinion. I've been living check to check my whole adult life; before the rule change I probably spent $1000/yr in manipulated overdraft fees, where if the bank had just declined the transaction (because of the way they manipulate deposits and debits and before smartphone apps I had no way of knowing if a transaction would create an overdraft -- most often it wouldn't have happened at all if they had just let transactions post chronologically) I wouldn't have taken what amounted to a $5 loan I never wanted, at 700% interest.   Once I stopped at a BK, got a $6 value meal; cashier screwed up, ended up wringing up the burger / drink in separate transactions. Became a $76 meal.   Now I've opted out of overdraft protection, haven't missed it for a second, haven't paid a $35 overdraft since late 2009 / early 2010 when the bill passed.  This is just another example of a poor tax -- where, through no fault of their own (except by virtue of being poor), poor people are nickeled and dimed disproportionately. Unless you've lived it, it's hard to imagine how difficult it is to climb out of poverty."

I called them, explained that I wouldn't see any money until the first of the month, go told ""not to worry about it"".   After remaining overdrawn for two days I started seeing $10 fines imposed for Extended Overdraft, that the bank refused to compensate or reverse. $35 fee plus four days of $10 per day in Extended Overdraft fees plus the original check that overdrafted me in the first place meant I was at -$115 by the time my paycheck came in.

That wasn't the end of it of course, because his time in court had already cost him a lot of money, he went after the bank demanding compensation. Still, Bank of America ignored him completely.    5 months later and still no response from the bank, the man took the case to court again and was given a writ of execution, enabling him to seize the banks assets as payment for what they owed him.

The courts sided with him, and told the bank to pay his legal fees. They dragged their heels and delayed paying him, hoping that he would eventually just give up. Finally, he got tired of waiting and showed up with the sheriff to foreclose on the branch.

nottheonion,3brg9h,scootah,7,Wed Jul 1 22:04:04 2015 UTC,"I live in another country, so maybe it's different here. But unused budget to government departments here is usually used as an excuse to decrease next years budget. Public servants advance their careers based on how many people they supervise, and how much budget they oversee. So having your budget reduced next year is always a backwards career step for any public servant.   This has many flow on effects. But not least of them, is that if the years budget has been spent and allocated - the last thing they want is refunded money or or other incoming checks. Getting approval to spend that money is a NIGHTMARE. It almost never gets through the red tape in time for the next budget review - but it totally counts as unspent budgetary funds when they're being reviewed - so it drops their next yearly budget.  I used to work for a pretty big IT vendor. Not the biggest in the country, or a manufacturer. But a big company that resells all the major IT solutions and had a lot of government clients. They would regularly issue refunds because something had been fucked up - sometimes it was a straight up clerical error. Some times something upstream would fuck up so they couldn't deliver all of an order. Whatever. Big company, big complicated transactions. Refunds happen. Government departments would NEVER cash those cheques. It created too much personal work for staff in the departments and it set their careers back too far. They'd just bin the refund cheques and never claim the money. The money to honor those cheques would just sit in a bank account waiting for the statutory requirements to expire (7 years I think?), then the money would get used by the accounting team to cancel out bad debts or other costs they had to zero out from somewhere to balance the books. At any given time, that account had a rolling balance in the 8 figure range. And the first number wasn't a particularly low.  As a tax payer - that shit is fucking outrageous.  But I'm told it's pretty standard for any big supplier who works with government departments."

It omits Polish reception of 50 000 Chechen refugees, acceptance of Vietnam community from East Germany and help to 250 000 Ukrainians.  Let us start from the point that contrary to main thesis of the article Poland has no obligation to accept thousands of so called refugees, until they prove they really are persecuted. The whole entry point is thus wrong. The appropriate procedure is applied and results are, most of refugees have no right for asylum. And I believe in this outcome. The second false point is mixing economic migration and political. Poland is home to  more than 100 000 Vietnamese and more than 200 000 Ukrainians. Both groups are hard working and found their place in polish society. Moreover, unlike UK, accepted foreigners can really feel in Poland like at home. The precondition is that Poles should perceive their presence beneficial for the society. There are many cases, when Muslims, married to Polish women, and performing socially useful jobs like medicine doctors, have been accepted by the community. The acceptance usually started with recommendation of the local parishioner.   I completely misunderstand while Poles shall be educated to accept thousands of Muslim immigrants, including ISIS and Al-Quaeda collaborates, only because they succeeded doing the way through Mediterranean. As far as I am concerned those people are neither persecuted nor their reception is beneficial for economy.  The obvious goal of immigration policy shall be bringing people, who bring some value and those who can easily assimilate.  Black, Muslim Eritreans are opposite example. Moreover, they know it and they want to settle in Sweden, UK or Germany.  If somebody believes that Poles and Eritreans both shall be forced to accept each other as neighbors and that we need to apply considerable amount of social engineering to achieve this goal, I would answer please find the other, positive goal.

nottheonion,3bvh3f,AlexanderMalinowski,2,Thu Jul 2 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"""You are aware that the nazis wanted to destroy diversity""  Are aware what nonsenses are you saying? German Nazi's simply killed people, who they believed were enemies, including 6 millions of Polish citizens. However, their dream society looked like Appartheid.  ""you should have the same responsibilities as other countries"" There is no such a responsibility on behalf of EU member countries. Diversity in UK and France is the result of colonial past. Poland had no colonies. Diversity in US is result of Slavery. Poles are grand children of former slaves (surfs) as well. Poles have no obligations to take Muslim Eritreans or Somalis.  ""a lot of diversity in the us because of thousands of polish immigrants and workers.""  Actually US since 1925 applied very low quotas on Polish immigrants, so this point actually works against you. US could block Polish immigration, Poland has the same right.  ""which nearby country are you talking about that is trying to make slaves of poland?"" Are you completely unaware of Muslim slavery? Between 15th and 18th century Turkey and Tatarian Crimea took slaves on Polish soil almost every year.  In addition Muslim Caliphate between 8th and 11th century bought large numbers of Slavic slaves, also from territory of Poland.  Can you imagine how many thousand of women had been raped in the course of Muslim slavery? They have never apologized and even nowadays claim the Muslim slavery is good.  Why we shall be obliged to take in successors of rapists?"

There's not just descendants of English and African people living here.  It sounded like you were saying that there was a country currently trying to enslave poles.

You have eradicated indigenous population and you opened the land for immigration. This is your way, your land, you can do whatever you do, for example you blocked immigration from Poland. Poles in Poland are indigenous population, who successfully overcome all attempts of the foreign powers to enslave, conquer or eradicate us. (From Polish perspective Nazi Germany and Soviet Union had attempted to eradicate Poles and successfully implemented part of that plan.)  We don't have any obligation to open the land for immigration or to make the country diverse. If you study the history of Poland, Poland used to be very diverse country, but sometimes it worked and sometimes not. Russian roulette.  In Europe the only working properly modern structure is national state. There is some leftist ideology, which want us to believe future of Europe is in united states of Europe or multiculturalism.

It is simply false. If you don't bother to read wiki I may enlighten you: the immigration crisis is triggered by smuggling large numbers of Somalis and Eritreans to Europe. Basically they are Muslims without useful skills and having no connection to Poland.  I think if we believe Eritreans are persecuted in Eritrea, let us send there navy and make order, so they can have decent life there. Poland should become more attractive for skilled immigrants from neighboring Eastern European countries. This is real challenge, but it might solve many problems. Putting immigration of Muslims from Africa as task for Poland is crazy idea from the start. Italians shall develop the way to deal with the smugglers gangs and Poland can help them implement these plans.

Security is expensive -- very expensive. And in this case, it really doesn't work, and never can. You can control a given passageway, one of human scale. It's pretty much impossible to control a border that size, no matter how big a wall you build or how much money you pour into it. It's a hopeless money pit that might be politically popular, but can't possibly solve the problem it promises to.  The problem, after all, is not that Mexico is a warlike country filled with warlike people trying to get at us. The problem is nothing more dramatic -- but no less significant -- than a severe economic gradient across a margin narrow enough to be meaningful at human scale. That's it.  The only solution that would ever work would be for the U.S. to aggressively invest in Mexico's future, to help build it up. That would have to come with a temporary power-sharing arrangement, that would pair U.S. money with U.S. force, to make sure that that investment goes where it should and does what it should, and because we have sufficient power to crush the cartels if we really committed to it, in close partnership with Mexico. That could be a dicey political issue on both sides. Or hell, maybe investment by itself would be sufficient, since cartels need staff, and most people will only take a shitty, dangerous job for good money if they don't have other good options.  As it happens, that's also the cheapest and probably fastest solution, too. But because of the nature of U.S. politics and culture, it's a very hard sell. Not because it can't be argued, but because it flies in the face of what can only be truthfully described as patent bigotry on the part of many Americans towards Latinos in general and Mexicans in particular.  Most Americans are unaware of, do not understand, or simply reject the true economic relationship between our peoples. They worry and complain about 'wetbacks' ""stealing our jobs,"" but most Americans would not do the very hard and demanding work that many Mexican immigrants do. (Many are not physically capable of it.) Most Americans don't want or can't work those jobs that are being 'taken'.  Nor do they appreciate now important it is that someone does them. Many of those jobs are essential, or have some ancillary effect such as keeping produce prices down.*  Americans need to forget about this wall, or fence, and everything associated with it. At best, it can only slow the tide. We cannot solve economic disparity with walls and guards and guns, nor can we shut out its effects. The wall is at best a very leaky dam, and a very expensive one to maintain. If we spent a similar amount on trying help Mexico get better, both countries would benefit much more in a much shorter time. All we have to do is get over ourselves.  * This gets into a tangential issue that Americans need to come to terms with at some point. We complain about the cost of produce, but in truth, we're underpaying for much of it, specifically because we're benefiting from cheap labour in that industry. If everyone involved with bringing produce to us was paid fairly and decently, produce would be much more costly. Price is a powerful political force, but I'd like to think that decency was, also. Americans often bemoan the passing of what they consider our golden age of a century ago, when we built great and majestic buildings and ships and so on, overlooking the fact that those monuments to our greatness were made possible by poor wages and even worse working conditions, and the death or ruin of many people, including whole families. The reason we can't afford stuff like that now is that we got better as a people and have tried to stop sacrificing other humans to our egos. At some point, we have to do the same in respect to our food."

This is a very common fallacy, of comparing two things that seem to have some relationship, but have no rational connection. This particular one comes up very commonly in gun control discussions, because it's an easy way to avoid the harder discussions that are more relevant, by redirecting the conversation into irrelevant territory that's easier to navigate.  For example, birth has, so far, a 100% death rate. If you're born, you are going to die. There is so far no known cure. In the U.S., cars are one of the biggest killers; but by itself, that suggests neither that cars should be banned, nor that that's a more urgent concern than a different one rationally unrelated to cars. It might suggest priority, if a choice must be made, but if you were to shrug off something like poisoned medicine on the logic that cars kill more people, you'd be letting yourself get diverted by a rational irrelevancy.  No doubt, unhealthy diet kills -- in all countries, not just violent ones. It's not strictly relevant what the numbers are in any of them compared to some other thing that also happens to be killing people in the same country, any more than comparing it to the birth rate.  I appreciate that people care about these things, as they should, as well as OP's good intentions. It's certainly shocking how many people are dying due to poor diet, in Mexico or anywhere else. But I want people to be consciously aware of why the comparison made is not relevant or meaningful, even in violent countries. Because a great deal of time, words, and energy are wasted in making those meaningless comparisons, often diverting from truly important and meaningful discussions while real people still die."

From an interview with one of the professors at the school who performed the study:   First, we determined the levels of sugar-sweetened beverage intake around the world, by country, age, sex and time. Next, we obtained other evidence from long-term observational studies, supported by clinical trials, about how sugar-sweetened beverage intake relates to obesity and diabetes. Then we evaluated the obesity and diabetes rates in all countries, by age and sex.  All these inputs went into a complex model to determine the number of preventable deaths if people didn’t drink sugar-sweetened beverages.    Looking further into the issue, over 75,000 people died of diabetes alone in Mexico in 2008, and heart disease accounted for another 60,000 (the latest year which I could find decent numbers).

nottheonion,3bns7s,Rodents210,33,Tue Jun 30 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"I wanted to start off by saying I believe this man is mentally ill or mentally deficient. The only thing that the article really alluded to is mental illness or deficiency. It did not report on the state of this man's room or elaborate on his interests such as whether or not he liked anime or browsed 4chan. I'm not a betting man but I'd be willing to say that both of these facts would be true.   So you might ask yourself ""What kind of man would go off the rails like this and abuse his grandmother and break her things?"". Many people who are heavily addicted to the internet start to become irrational when their access is taken away. Like when, perhaps, comcast guy comes in to plug a new modem in. If this man was mentally ill or deficient it is not a far stretch to assume that this was the simple trigger. Whatever it was it doesn't matter. On 4chan, I've read several stories (whether fake or true I don't know, some were quite believable) written by anonymous users that graphically detail the extent of their disrespect, manipulation and disregard for others around them . It's sad to say that these cases are not isolated, and there are more families suffering because of people like this who are allowed to essentially do what they want (even if it's nothing) at the cost of others.  I was triggered a little by this article because when I was younger (I'm 25 now) my parents never used to let me play games on my nintendo 64 or use the internet on the computer. To put a long story short I was kicked out of home from 13-18 and returned home at 18 with a job and with that job I bought a computer and paid for the internet. My parents were concerned with how much I was using the internet (and I tend to agree with them now, though I didn't at the time) and they started taking the modem out when they went to bed which infuriated me. I ended up getting angry and violent and did irrational things that I'm not proud of. The end result was that I was out of home for good, had to make it on my own from that moment on. Unlike thousands, maybe more, I had to fend for myself and find a place to live. It wasn't smooth sailing and I'm 25 now and only just getting my feet on the ground. Still addicted to the internet.  I'm rambling.  Point here is there's alot of people who are essentially deadweight on those around them. In my circumstances, I had a job, was an adult, etc... and I was pissed off at my parents for treating me like a kid when they put me in foster care, like what gave them the right to decide how I spent my time? The deadweights though? They'll lie, steal, manipulate, disrespect, disregard and straight up abuse mentally, emotionally, physically. They'll do it to those who are around them. They won't care. It's all about their fucking obsession, whatever it may be. I've seen only the surface of their perversion thanks to 4chan. Piss jars being one of the things that I legit couldn't believe was a real thing but is. I can't pretend to know the beast that this man is, but I know the beast that I was. Shockingly hard to admit but I draw parallels to these people and it sickens me. They don't get dealt with because the people around them are weak. That's what it comes down to."

No divorce means you have a situation like Ireland used to have: no ability to get divorced means you have people who remain married but separated from abusive partners.  Divorce may be a horrible thing to go through, but it at least gives both parties legal recourse to end their relationship in a way that a third party gets to adjudicate—at least in theory, it is done fairly.  Incidentally, it seems quite likely that the divorce rate for gay couples will remain lower than it is for straight couples. If you've had to wait years and years to get married, you tend to be a bit less likely to jump in and do it without really thinking about it.  And the legal situation pre-SCOTUS was weird. You might have a bisexual person who marries a same-sex partner in a state where same-sex marriage is legal, but then they could also theoretically go to a state where same-sex marriage isn't legal and marry an opposite sex person. And if the state tells them they are already married, well, they aren't. That state doesn't recognise the same-sex marriage.  Even if you ignore all the happy equality feel-good stuff, the pre-SCOTUS situation was untenable long term just for weird legal logistical reasons."

Representatives of at least two of the city's Hatha yoga studios — the Aura and Ingara — have received letters outlining Nizhnevartovsk officials' plans to halt yoga classes in city facilities. Both schools rent out space at a stadium and public meeting hall called Samotlor.  One of the letters, seen by Kommersant and addressed from Nizhnevartovsk First Deputy Head Sergei Levkin to the head of social and youth policy Marianna Parfenova asks that she take all necessary measures to stop Hatha yoga lessons from taking place at the stadium."

Japanese will give the impression on understanding and agreement and afterwards wil ask lots of clarification and confirmation questions so that in the end things get done without anyone losing face over not understanding something.   The Indian case is more of a ""say anything to get the business and then bullshit all the way"". The idea is to get the client to pay you money until they give up and cancel the project or fire your ass. Doesn't matter to them as they'll just move on to the next contract where they'll do the same thing.

The average indian isn't too proud to learn hindi [seriously?!], but they may not need it, have access to learning it, nor have any desire in speaking the language of upper class/urban citizens who make their socioeconomic conditions so hard to get out of as it is (at least in the north, this is my understanding).   So part of it is that these tribes have developed as independent, somewhat self-sufficient communities over generations and even centuries, they don't need hindi to get by. While they may be indian, they don't feel a need to speak hindi to be indian, and they don't need it to get by in their day-to-day either. All of their education, services, and commodities are delivered in their native language, and for the average indian, the likelihood of upping and moving to the big city and needing to speak hindi isn't that high. You may be misunderstanding how hard it is to educated a full 1/7th of the world in one language, nevermind how valuable it would be. They've been growing up oin a country large enough to be its own continent, in discrete towns in somewhat autonomous states for decades and decades. Furthermore, in developing countries, the goal is to get them literate in any language, why make it something fancy and not fitted to their situation, to make it a language mum and dad don't even speak at home, making it even harder. I'm discussing switching everyone to Hindi, not discussing English education in this context.   Ataturk tried to do rush all these ethnic muting/homogenization/westernization projects in turkey, and now turkey is a cultural disaster with a severe identity crisis. Turks for some reason are frightfully proud of him and love him like stockholm syndrome'd children, but that's a story for another time. Indians will find their way organically when they need to. They don't need to homogenize their ethnic identity, they're all different and have the right to nurture the cultures that built them if its not at any detriment to their well-being.   Why is it called pride when developing countries are discussed, but chalked up to 'maintaining identity/heritage' in western countries? seems a little unfair."

However, do the Greeks deserve to be punished over and over with austerity measures? Is the current Greek government that evil for promising their people they wouldn't keep introducing new austerity measures, and stick to it? Not really.

It's not really about what the Greeks as a people deserve... sure they don't deserve not being able to withdraw their money from the bank.  But bad things are going to happen anyway, deserved or not.  You're right in saying it's the government (and years of bad financial policy) that created this disaster.  The austerity measures were actually helping, but then they got tired of the austerity measures, which were rough, but ultimately made things better.  So they voted in this new government that did away with the austerity measures, and well... we can all see the effects.    I would definitely hold the current government responsible for making promises it can't keep.  Their campaign was basically ""we're going to let you have your cake and eat it too.  No austerity, no defaults.  Money will just happen and everything will be wonderful!""  This is simply what happens when that government inevitably fails to deliver the impossible after promising it.  The thing is, the austerity was never a punishment.  The reality was that there wasn't any money, and somebody was going to get screwed.  So who do you screw?  Screw the banks?  Sure, but then the liquidity collapses and the economy is fucked.  Screw the businesses?  Sure, and then the economy grinds to a halt and there's widespread unemployment.  Screw the pensions?  People will riot.  Screw the people in the prime of their lives?  People will riot.  The austerity measures were pretty much an attempt to make things suck the least of all possible choices... because there was no money."

nottheonion,3bnubh,cyberdork,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:06:59 2015 UTC,That's complete bullshit. First of all many of the austerity measured they previously agreed to were never ever implemented or have been worked around. The understandably pissed off creditors demanded further benefit cuts (which would guarantee a reduction in the deficit) and tax hikes (which potentially reduces the deficit). The greek government only agreed to increase taxes.

You fix it, and she says she can't pay today. The user I've been discussing this with says this is not a theft of service. But the same criteria apply, right?  This other user also says the same contract law doesn't apply because you're not a business. So if she goes into the computer repair shop, and still says ""I can't pay today"", is this somehow different?  The elements of a contract apply in each case, (taxi; you fixing the computer; and the shop fixing the computer) so why would one be theft of services when the other is not?

What I'd expect would be a lot of bullshit propaganda about protecting the interests of ethnic Russians, and a bunch of dramatic terrorist attacks, and some bullshit separatist movement that has been nothing but a bunch of grumpy dudes in a pub suddenly starts showing up with weaponry and causing trouble. Shit gets noisier and nastier, the national government has a surprising amount of trouble containing these ""separatists"", and all the while Russia is pretending they have nothing to do with it. Eventually maybe there's a coup, and then a popular referendum to change the constitution, which everyone knows was rigged but nobody can really prove it, and hey presto Finland/Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania is once again a satellite of Moscow... but there was never any precipitating event over which NATO would have gone to war with Russia.

Ilfeld, who divides his time between London and Israel, devised Diving Chess after seeing the boxing version in London.  “I thought it was kind of stupid, actually. There’s a fighting round and then a round of chess. But it means that someone who is big and strong but not very good at chess could still win. It’s either a knockout or a checkmate,” Ilfeld told the The Times of Israel.  “I thought it would be nice to have some sort of sport version where the body type or the gender didn’t matter. So then I had this epiphany about bringing chess into the pool. Regular chess is played with a clock. If you play in a pool, it depends on breath control,” says Ilfeld.  This is how Diving Chess works: The waterproof, weighted board and magnetic pieces are at the bottom of the pool, and the players take turns diving down and making their move. They can stay down making a decision as long as they can hold their breath."

nottheonion,3bjs2s,N8thanEL,110,Mon Jun 29 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"This is the new recipe for news these days:   Find an idiot on twitter who says something incredibly stupid against something you like. Write an article with a title  that implies it is a significant event, even though it is only a select few people on twitter, if they are being sincere about it at all. Your readers all feel better than ""all those stupid people on the other side of my issues"" that the article is about. Clicks, likes, tons more exposure than those few idiots ever could have dreamed of come in. Repeat until a miracle happens.   Don't reward this lazy and sadly prevalent form of journalism even when calling it out in a satirical context.   Reddit doesn't like to hear all of this because they are equally, if not more, affected than the average person, but it's the truth. The collective skepticism the place is famous for becomes very anemic when dealing with things they already have a strong opinion towards. It would be cool and funny if we found that those who stood against our principles had an average  IQ of 10, but these silly over-reported twitter posts in no way come close to that and actually have a detrimental effect in making more lazy journalism directed to us in the future and uniting extreme views."

The study found, surprise surprise, that people who rely more on intuitive judgments (their ""gut"") for knowledge were more likely to dismiss evolution.

I was Christened at birth but then grew up with a God fearin' Bible-belt grandma who had me baptised at 9. In my early teens I really sat down and tried to go page by page and decide what made logical sense to me and what I could not believe under ANY circumstances from the bible. I didn't make it 100 pages before I decided I just cannot devote my life to this nonsense. I'll find my own path.   I marvel at people that accept the bible as word for word truth.

At the point in my life when I decided to make my own decisions and actually grow up, I decided that I wouldn't absolutely dismiss religion, nor would I blindly follow it. These seemed to be the only pathways for my family and the religious people I knew. Instead, I wanted to actually think about it and make my own personal assessments of something that was hailed as undeniable truth by those who introduced me to it. It's sad because the majority of people who follow and truly believe in their religion are the people who were told to do exactly that.  Like most, when I judged the book by what it was actually saying,  the kinds of practices and viewpoints held by those in my church, the mindset that all those religious people had, I just couldn't believe in it. I'm fine with people following religion or believing in God, but I always urge them to do it by their own will. Do they truly believe that? Is that what they, themselves, want?   And what's even more sad is    There is nothing that can be said to someone like that. Nothing.   I would want to urge otherwise, I would want to say that a lot of people just need to be pushed to form their own opinions, but for a lot of them, this blind belief in their philosophy is actually a be all, end all viewpoint.

I simply cannot fathom how Biblical Literalists endure.    I went to a Jesuit college and I remember when some Creationists wanted to come and speak.

It seemed to me that it doesn't take long to realize that such arguments go nowhere. I learned that after a long series of frustrating lessons when it came to trying to get through to some of them.  It always seemed to me I'd hit a wall where my opponent would simply STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER and reject a fact or piece of evidence without analyzing it at all, simply because they don't like what it says (and what's more, most will admit it, saying things like, ""I don't care what that says or this says or what we found out there, I still think yadda yadda"").   That's so confusing for someone like me; they were basically admitting the only way their position works is if they make a deal with themselves to not think about it too much. Most religious people I've talked to actually seem to go into a flat-out panic if I can push their limits enough to actually sit down and THINK about what they believe in ways they never had before, and shut down immediately and refuse to listen further.

Evolution can't be a law since it isn't something that always happens and gives the same result.   We do however know for a fact that evolution occurs. This is why we have, ""the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection."" Whether or not evolution happens isn't the theory. WHY it happens is the theory."

nottheonion,3bis5b,WolfNippleChips,4,Tue Jun 30 13:57:38 2015 UTC,Those who reject evolution are lucky it is not a selective factor in the survival.

It gets a bit trickier when we get down to the brass tacks because evolution is not about survival of the species but passing on of the genes. The two are close but not the same.

On the correct side, lgbt people just want to live their lives happily with their partner and be able to live as a family in peace. Soooo, which side needs to think harder and stop being monstrous human beings? The fact that any of this is a debate is absolutely disgusting, and it makes me ashamed to be human in the modern age. Our technology has vastly improved, but our morality is still millennia old, so seriously start thinking harder apes.  In reference to global warming, like I said below: One side is backed mostly by big oil and politicians, the other side is backed by the vast majority of scientific minds. Yet the conclusion that is drawn by dissenters is that the scientists are the ones that are bribed, and the politicians and big oil are spending and campaigning to inform the public. Seriously those dipshits need to start thinking harder and look at big oil's track record.  Do you see the pattern that shows which side is thinking harder and which side is just thinking comfortably? The side of history that thinks nothing needs to change, is usually the wrong side."

As for gay marriage, I cannot for the life of me understand how two gay people getting married somewhere possibly impacts my life.  What possible gain is there in preventing them from getting married?  ""Sanctity of marriage"" is complete nonsense.  Unless a person is also trying to make divorce illegal I consider all sanctity of marriage arguments null and void.

Both sides are not equal, you have people who know that all concepts of god so far have been man made and are inherently false, and people who think there is literally an immortal being watching and guiding every single person.

It's more fluid than just straight/gay, or even straight/gay/bi.  What does that mean? Well, take a man whose sexuality is fluid. They identify as straight because it's the closest label to what they feel. Maybe they're curious, but they don't date men because the drive to explore their sexuality is not overwhelming, and doesn't surpass the social stigma.  But what if there's no social stigma? What if it's totally normal and accepted to explore this aspect of their sexuality? What if there were raised in a culture that encouraged it? Even a little curiosity would be reason enough to experiment. Of course it's more likely that they will!  I don't think that's a bad thing. I feel bad if someone lives their whole life in the closet, but if you're religious you might see it as ""resisting the temptation of sin"", or something along those lines.  Marriage itself isn't so important, but it's a big symbol of social acceptance. Homosexuality is only going to become more socially acceptable, and this is a big step. And when it's more accepted, yes, more people will have gay sex. It's really not a crazy idea.
