She had a shady background and took charge of Reddit in the midst of controversial changes to the company.   She either did a bad job, or she was thrown under the bus. The only way you could involve sexism in that, is to claim that the board of Reddit threw her under a bus because she was a woman.   In the announcement she made when she quit from the position, she said that she could not see her being able to meet the demand of growth the board wanted. I'm inclined to believe her own word as that being the main reason."

Obama petitioned them to start it up again.  Look at it this way.  The appellate court can rule it unconstitutional, illegal, whatever.  Because the FISC is the court that reenacted it and they are not bound by the appellate court ruling even if the appellate court rules in the ACLU's favor this time the FISC can still just ignore the ruling.  Since the appellate court can't make them comply and Obama has no intention of appealing the appellate court's ruling the Supreme Court will never get the appeal in effect insulating them from any Supreme Court ruling.  If you can't see how fucked up that is then we are all fucked.  This is why we can't have this court nor any part of our government that isn't accountable to the civilian courts."
