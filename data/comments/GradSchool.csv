GradSchool,3e5np0,WeoWeoSimon,6,Wed Jul 22 03:38:56 2015 UTC,"Here are a few tips that come to mind, from my two years (so far) of an English grad degree.   You won't have time to read everything. Don't sweat it, but pick up as fast as you can the ability to find and remember the important parts. This goes not only for assigned reading, but also researching in general. Meet with your professors as often as possible. Your connections with the professors are really what will make or break your experience and success. For that matter, upperclassmen in your program not only know more about the program than you, but will become part of the job market before you. It's important to have those friends and see those processes before you have to do them yourself. Starting thinking about term papers at least two months before they're due.  Try to make every paper you write a publishable one. There's no point in writing papers if it's not an area that you could possibly present at a conference or publish in a journal, so might as well make your term papers count in real life.   That's what I can think of right now. Good luck!"
GradSchool,3e5np0,raggedpanda,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments! If you don't mind me asking, was it difficult to manage a personal life for the first year? For my program, you generally take four courses each semester; I heard from other grad students here that the first year is brutal and unhealthy. I'd just like to have a couple hours each week to stay in shape and play sports, provided that my time management skills are good."
GradSchool,3e5np0,savdec449,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:06:24 2015 UTC,"So, I think one thing that I'd say is that your professors know and understand your work load. Since they accepted you into the program, then have a reasonable expectation that you will be able to do it. However, when too many things begin to come up, like raggedpanda said, you just begin to triage things. Read parts of secondary/theoretical books deeply; skim the chapters that don't relate as directly to your interests.   Also, remember, you don't have to take 4 seminars on 19th century British novels, and that some professors are just harder than others in a seminar setting. Talk to older students, ask for syllabi ahead of time--you'll be able to build a workable term.  Finally--be real with yourself when it comes to your mental health. I'm not really ""in"" to working out, but even a little exercise goes a long way to making the work that I do for the rest of the day more fruitful. Burning out is a real risk, so treat however you need to destress as a necessary portion of your day."
GradSchool,3e5np0,Eskimo12345,0,Wed Jul 22 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"Don't sweat it. Four courses is a comparatively small course load when put alongside Engineering or a STEM degree. Ignore any and all comments saying that you will not get a job, or that your degree is easier to obtain: it is not. Don't trash talk your own degree. Know that you are doing something you love. Have some faith that things will work out financially, but don't delude yourself into slacking. The people you want to associate with will not treat your degree as a second-class or 'worthless' option. Learn why you are taking your degree, and formulate a defense for having taken that degree: you are taking a degree in persuasive argumentation skills, and this means you should be able to convince yourself and others that that degree has value. Finally: start developing an exit strategy - when you complete your humanities degree, your learning isn't done. With a literature degree you will /need/ to pick up something that makes you employable. Consider teaching overseas, going into publishing, or obtaining a one-year college degree directly after university. All of these suggestions are meant to help you think ahead, and avoid pitfalls. Best of luck. University is a fucking blast."
GradSchool,3e5np0,savdec449,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:17:26 2015 UTC,"It is not a small course load in a graduate setting.   Edit to add: Just to clarify, there is a real cultural difference between how STEM graduate degrees treat coursework, and how courses function in the humanities. For instance, my sig other is in chemistry, and she has been told over and over that her research comes first, and that courses are a sort of secondary concern. In the humanities, however, the line isn't as clearly divided. Our research, pre-comprehensive exams, often consists of our coursework and the essays that we produce at the conclusion of each term. As such, there is a different kind of weight on coursework--it is, after all, the only metric our programs have to judge us by."

GradSchool,3e5np0,thundahcunt,2,Wed Jul 22 06:12:18 2015 UTC,"Hello there! :)  I'm a grad. student about to finish my MA in English Lit. (YAY HUMANITIES! I'll find a job someday to pay off these massive student loans)  It's hard to give broad advice, just because not only is every department different, but every professor/advisor as well. With that said, here's my advice:   Don't get intimidated! You got into the program, that means they felt you were every bit as worthy as all the other people who got in.  Visit professors often - the students in my program that spent time out of class meeting with professors not only ended up doing better working and earning higher grades, but also had a better idea of who they might work well with on their thesis.  Get close with your cohort - download a group messaging app ( such as groupme) and have everyone sign up during orientation (this might be the only time you're all together). This made it so easy to arrange hanging out when we collectively needed to blow off some steam, or even just figure out who was on campus to grab a coffee and study with (it's also why we now have some pretty great inside jokes). Academics are important, but these are the people you're going to be in the trenches with; they're your best allies, and often, your best sources of information when your department is being less than forthcoming. If you're not comfortable with lit. theory, bone up now (http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300#sessions). You seriously can't know enough lit. theory. Find grad. associations and join! It's a great way to meet other grad. students who share a common interest. Sometimes your advisor ends up being the least expected choice - and sometimes the advisor that makes the most sense on paper is the absolute worst choice you can make. You need to be even more judicious when it comes to course selection - make smart choices! Sometimes the hardest part of the degree is all the b.s. admin stuff - double checking financial aid's math or figuring out confusing and random registration rules. Meet with your advisor/someone who knows the admin. side of everything and make sure you have all your ducks in a row. The website isn't always accurate, and it's always shitty to find out you missed a deadline for something you had no idea existed.   . . . .I probably have more, but it's bedtime!"
GradSchool,3e2qzu,platonicly,20,Tue Jul 21 14:42:58 2015 UTC,"Start with reading the relevant and related literature in your field. This will give you an idea for 1) what has been done in your field, 2) what has not been done (each paper usually identifies future research opportunities), and 3) how other people write original research papers. After reading a paper write ~2-3 sentences (total) describing 1) what they did, 2) how they did it, 3) why they did it, and 4) what they didn't do. Combine all paper summaries into your background + lit review sections for your first paper. You now would have a road map for doing your own research.  edit: writing is never done on the first draft."
GradSchool,3e2qzu,fundhelpman,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"thank you very much, I find this advice very helpful!!"
GradSchool,3e2qzu,thielemodululz,5,Tue Jul 21 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"Great question. When I was first starting out I had a lot of confusion about what it was that made something worthy of being an article. If it contributes some new knowledge to the scientific community that wasn't previously available, it should be publishable."
GradSchool,3e2qzu,Pinch_roll,6,Tue Jul 21 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"What is your field? For science grad students, the answer is very simple: start by performing original research, and explain what you did   Papers written for classes in undergrad are more of a basic lit review than an original research article (which is what I assume you mean by ""creating something original"").   I think the answer to your question begins with this advice: you need to perform the research before you can think about writing an original paper. I'm assuming you are finishing undergrad and beginning a masters soon, and haven't worked as a researcher before? If so, just relax because you need to acclimate yourself to research, pick a topic, and put in some serious lab/reading time before writing about publishing. One step at a time!  When I started grad school, we had a "" soft "" requirement of 3 first author publications to graduate with a PhD, and for the first couple of years that seemed to be an impossible task. I had never published anything, and even as I ran more experiments and read more journal articles it still seemed like I was far away from publishing anything. Gradually, though, I began to realize that each experiment was another piece of the story I was trying to tell, and before I knew it I was outlining my first manuscript and writing the background. Lean heavily on your advisor - they've done this a lot, and don't be embarrassed of sending them drafts.   After the first paper, subsequent ones are 1000% easier"
GradSchool,3e2qzu,GrandPappyDuPlenty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"thanks. my field is philosophy. so some of the advice won't apply to me personally, but it gives me a general idea now. I am just finding it very hard to understand what has been done and what hasn't. I am currently doing an MA, so the PhD is not all too far away and I am worried that my proposal won't be 'original'. I gotta start reading more, I guess, but I have only got that much time, so I am freaking out a bit!"
GradSchool,3e2qzu,Pinch_roll,3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"Some advice regarding philosophy in particular:  Your proposal for your PhD applications doesn't need to be original; it needs to be interesting and demonstrate competence and sophistication. From what I've seen and heard, MA students usually have less of a problem with the statement of purpose than folks coming straight from undergrad.  In terms of originality in actual papers and research, you're right that it's important to find what has and hasn't been done on particular topics. I think having a good advisor helps here, as does having a large network of people interested in similar things to you. A lot of original work consists of making new connections, but it's just hard to know what's new without having a pretty solid working knowledge of a problem's literature. The nice thing about PhD apps is that it's not like anyone expects you to have an in-depth working knowledge of an entire field. If you can demonstrate that kind of familiarity with one or two problems, that can help to show that you're capable of doing the same thing with a wider scope later on.  Oh and even without the help of an advisor to guide you through the literature: find a recent important paper, go through the sources and read the relevant papers, go through their sources and read the relevant papers, etc.  You'll usually end up finding most of the major papers."
GradSchool,3e2qzu,aint_frontin_whi_chu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Gotcha - I don't have any experience with that field, but I think the main points apply. If you are reading cutting edge papers, try to envision what sorts of questions are raised, or remain unanswered. Sometimes the discussion section is a good source of information. Good luck! I really think you should schedule a sit-down with your advisor of he's the helpful sort. Mine was a huge source of advice for times like these."
GradSchool,3e2qzu,herennius,2,Wed Jul 22 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"You need to read to know what's been written. There's no way around it.

If things discussed in class were relevant, I'd add that to my thinking. About a month in, I'd have a solid topic and will have done all the general reading I need. Then I'd begin to think specifically about my new, well-honed topic. I'd read up on that and begin writing the paper, working on it until the final weeks of class."

GradSchool,3e3s52,Newt_Ron_Starr,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:28 2015 UTC,"I can't really speak about the computer science field in particular because my experience is on the physics side, but a transition from math/physics to CS is entirely possible. At my university, a good portion (~25%) of the grad students in physics work on computational biophysics. They tend to be pretty evenly split on their background. About half of them came from a physics background and have learned the CS, and about half came from CS and are learning the physics. Graduates that have done this program and wanted to pursue CS after getting their Ph.D. have gone on and worked at Apple, Google, Facebook, and various defense contractors doing CS. So, even if you feel your background might hamper your entry into a dedicated CS graduate program, there are options that your physics background will make available. Computational physics is becoming more and more important and I have even seen entire talks at physics conferences dedicated to pure CS topics.  As far as actually getting your foot in the door, the school itself isn't as important in my opinion as the research group you are working with. There are outstanding researchers that operate in little known universities just like there can be not great researchers at the MIT's and Harvards of the world. Do some research into a field that you find interesting, and get to know who researches that. Once you know who you are interested in, get in touch with them and ask them questions. If you establish a relationship with the researcher and they want you in their group, they can make your admission happen even if you did go to a no name school."

Like you say, the material will be the same, but the researchers at better schools will generally have a better research program going and will have more connections for you post-grad school and will just in general look better on a resume.    I don't know what kind of GPA you need for Berkeley, but I assume it is high (there's other stuff too that I guess could offset one's GPA, but a higher GPA obviously translates to a better probability of getting in).    You could apply to several good grad schools at different levels and have a few safety schools and take the best option.  You could also look into what part of the country you'd like to live."
GradSchool,3e3s52,Slim_Shady_SIT_DOWN,2,Tue Jul 21 19:49:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't see if you mentioned Masters or PhD. The GPA actually isn't as important if going for a PhD. You need publications to get into the top 5 schools though. If you shoot for a Masters, I think you would absolutely stand a shot. In fact, as I'm typing this I'm thinking that you really should be shooting for a Masters. Don't worry about knowing too much though, if you concentrate hard you can nail down the basics of CS pretty quickly (a semester or so)."
GradSchool,3e3s52,Slim_Shady_SIT_DOWN,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:17:48 2015 UTC,"This seems like sound advice.  A master's will cost me money but a) an M.S. in CS will almost definitely pay itself off and b) I'll have money stashed away or c) I could do it slowly while working (there's a pretty good but not terribly competitive program in my area at a school that caters to a lot of professionals in the area) and be more competitive applicant for phd programs and get better at my job.  Alternatively, I could maybe try Georgia Tech's masters program?  I'll probably have a publication or two, but it will be in analytical chemistry of all things.

GradSchool,3e3m3r,proteins911,7,Tue Jul 21 22:40:18 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need to talk to the head of the department or an ombudsman about this if you're getting pressured into publishing?

I've learned over the last two years that the only person who can help me is me... Involving others just fucks things up more  My plan is to just hand in an-as-near 100% honest version of the data that we do haveto my boss, skimpy as the honest data may be - And to make sure to state very clearly any uncertainties I have about the data I am presenting. My goal is to get a skeleton of a paper down, then open it up from comments from people with actual power so that rel change can happen and be enforced rather than rediverted by people in power. If we can agree on what ""complete"" looks like, then we can get the damn thing done.  It is just so fucking stressful"

Raising any issue with any outside party is just going to make my experience more shitty, make no one trust me, and drag this PhD  out more...

I think another thing is to set clear goals and expectations with your advisor. Have a timeline and make sure you're both aware of it and on board.

It's a big enough benefit to keep you motivated and interested in it, I think.  There are a couple of other things I really enjoy about it. One is that I know exactly what I'm putting into my body. This is particularly important to me as I have some digestive issues, so it's nice to stay on top of what I'm eating. But even more than that, if you have any health goals at all, it's nice to feel a little bit more in control of what you're doing.  The other is that cooking can actually be really relaxing. This might sound crazy. As someone very new to cooking, I know the feeling of it all seems overwhelming and being in the kitchen can be a very not calm experience. But once you get a few basic things down, it's actually nice to just take the time away from other things and spend it cooking for yourself. There's a sort of weird meditative trance aspect to it. Everything sort of has it's place in the meal, and you learn the little routines to put things together. I don't know. I know this sounds weird but, it can actually just be a really nice relaxing experience.  Also, if you know how to cook, you can host dinner parties and look awesome. I'm a dude in my 20's. If I have my friends over and prepare something even halfway decent, people are blown away."

I'm struggling with my thesis right now (only because my adviser doesn't know what he wants and makes me rewrite everything because he decides the paper should go in a different direction each week), but in the end, I will hold a piece of paper in my hand that says I did it. And so will you. If you want it.   If you don't then screw everyone in your family who has advanced degrees. I wanted to get a Phd until I took on this degree. Now I cannot wait until the day that I walk out of my school for the last time and never walk back into one for the rest of my life. You don't need to be a piece of paper to feel accepted. As others have said, life is too short to be unhappy. The only reason I stuck to my program is because it was one year. I had told myself if I failed my first semester I would quit, but I passed. By then I only had 2 more to go. Then 1 more to go. Now I only have a conclusion to write. If my program was 2 years I would have dropped out ages ago.   You said you were turning 21 soon, you have so much time to go to grad school should you choose to leave, don't let the idea of it being too late to stop you. A girl in my class is on her second Master's program, but she always took time in between them and worked for about a year or so to prevent burn out and to have some fun.   I cannot tell you what to do and I feel like I'm now rambling, but you need to do what you think it right. There is no right or wrong decision here."
GradSchool,3e1fi6,kittypaloosa,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not alone.  I'm entering the fourth year of my PhD with no first author publications and having not yet completed quals.  I feel like having a STEM BS makes things worse because you see your friends graduating, finding fulfilling careers, and moving on with their lives.  At least for you, I don't see this being a problem yet.  You're extremely young: young enough to get an MS in the time it takes many to get a BS.  It is literally the last push you'll have to do academically unless you take the red pill and go PhD, which I can't suggest at the moment.  If there is a way for you to finish with minimal effort and lackluster grades, I'd say do it over not finishing at all.  I'm mainly just writing to say, there are a lot of people in your position and I know what you're going through.  Good luck!!"
GradSchool,3e1fi6,skrenename4147,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"I think what you're experiencing is quite similar to what I did when I was in my first year of my master's degree; burnout. You had just finished an undergraduate degree which was quite an undertaking on its own. I was like you too, well kind of, because I feel that I was young when I graduated and decided to go to grad school while I'm still young. I was really depressed and the reason was similar as yours. I was lucky one of my bestfriend was in my programs and a lot of my friends started to move closer to my location for their careers so I had an amazing support system, and I think that was one of the reason I survived. Having a good advisor really helped too. My advisor did his best to find projects within his expertise that I am able and happily do so that I can produce the best work that I could. So OP, if possible you need to find people you can hang with when you're not working or take up a hobby that at least makes you happy (mine is LEGO). If you're unable to, ask for a semester off (or some time) to rest your mind, unwind and reevaluate your choices. I hope you find success in whatever you choose to do."

Just going to say the social aspect of this is probably affecting you more than you realise.   I was in a similar position when I started my PhD. In the end I had to grit my teeth and just go to stuff. I avoided the departmental stuff because that was usually filled with arse-licking undergrads stealing all the time of the interesting professors and killing any conversation going. I went to the rock and metal Society instead. Made a friend/ casual acquaintance but that was enough to start with. Knowing you have someone to have a pint with at the end of a rough day makes a difference. I also started playing a sport which helped my mood immensely.  And for the record, your institution not appearing in the news much academically doesn't matter as much at post graduate level. Or so I've been told anyway. Bit annoyed on your behalf about those footballers. We have a similar issue with the rugby club..."

Now I use it to blog about outreach events that I do or updates in my research life. I think its a great way to communicate my science with people back home that might not quite get what I'm doing.  I use weebly and I have no complaints! It has nice templates that you can also edit or build your own with CSS/HTML if your into designing your own stuff. I also know people that use wix.

GradSchool,3dzrvl,Hokieploidy,5,Mon Jul 20 23:39:45 2015 UTC,"This is so weird. Throughout my college career, undergraduate and graduate, I've had the opposite impression of academia. Most professors I've met have been weird and decidedly not conformist. While there's department politics, the most successful professors are the ones that are most direct in saying what they want. And people ignore any social flaws if the professor is capable of getting great grants and doing good research.  Is this a field specific phenomenon? Maybe certain fields are more prone to falling into this mindset than others?"
GradSchool,3dzrvl,uvvapp,6,Tue Jul 21 01:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'd guess field-specific, mixed with a bit of 'the job market is ridiculously competitive so things you might be forgiven after the job are not during an interview' and 'Karen Kelsky is more conformist than most in academia'"
GradSchool,3dzrvl,stuffedOwl,3,Tue Jul 21 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"Your comment on the job market being so competitive has got me thinking that it might be the fields without many options outside of academia that causes this weird social structure to form.  I've had experience in chemistry, engineering, and computer science. In these fields, PhD graduates can choose between going to industry or to academia - in fact, industry craves capable PhD graduates in these fields, and is willing to pay very good money to grab them. Maybe academia in these fields had to respond to this by becoming more hip, cool, and open-minded to pull back some of the best graduates.  It's just a working hypothesis for now, but it's an interesting thought."
GradSchool,3dzrvl,uvvapp,5,Tue Jul 21 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think this article is a bit harsh too. Think about other types of career counseling, I think what she does is help you show your best side and focus on what's important. It's similar to prep courses for the GRE or how to get into graduate school. You learn how to wade through all the crap that's not important and present your best self. I used all of her advice free on her site to craft my cover letter, research and teaching statements and all about her recommendations for good questions to ask during interviews and how to be most professional. We never got these practical tips in graduate school! I went on several interviews and landed a great faculty position. I'm sure my documents helped me get in the door but I ultimately had to be the person that I 'sold' them on and back it all up. So I think she's helped many of us learn this side of the process and it's still a ton of work, not some easy way out or trickery that the author suggests. Plus her tips on negotiation really helped me make sure I wasn't selling myself short and knew my value, important given that women typically don't ask for what they deserve. I will definitely recommend her book to students/post docs I know looking for faculty positions."

The only advice I can offer is to be vigilant with your time:   Make to-do lists with actual blocks to check when tasks are complete, Set aside specific blocks of time to focus on school work, and Research the Pomodoro studying technique.   If you really commit to it, it can be done.  Anything short of full dedication will make it quite difficult.  Good luck either way!"

Each candidate  presented a research seminar where they discussed previous research, future research plans and objectives that they would try to accomplish in the first five years of hiring (Funding, major projects, etc). Each candidate also gave a teaching seminar where they would teach grad students an actual lesson they prepared so we could observe how well they convey information and get along with students. Unsure if you will need to do something similar but Id be surprise if you didn't have to give some sort of presentation."

What I did was write my whole first draft as a series of dot points. I started at the big ideas, then kept nesting more dot points as new things came to mind. This let me see the flow of the thesis, as well as whether I was adequately supporting the big ideas. It also meant that I could restructure the thesis just by copy-pasting a few lines.  Once that job was done, I started expanding those dot points into prose. Worked it just enough so that fit together acceptably, and sent that straight off to my supervisors for early feedback. Their job at that point was to find gaps in reasoning or poorly-explained areas.  Oh EDIT: I wrote my thesis (70k words) in the space of six weeks. I had a comfortable writing pace because I had prepared well, and I had pre-written the Methods and Materials, but I had to leave it that late because results were still coming in."
GradSchool,3dx6ie,FormatOnceAYear,20,Mon Jul 20 09:52:29 2015 UTC,"The hardest part by far is starting the writing. There's a lot of anxiety over making it sound good, when in reality, the first draft is going to be a piece of crap no matter how long you've been writing for.   I spent way too long trying to write everything perfectly on my first draft, and my quality suffered as a result. Instead, when I wrote down the draft first without any restriction and then revised after, I wrote a higher quality piece of work.   The process differs from person to person, but the writing in itself is undeniably the most challenging part."

Most I had already read during the last two years, and highlighted for this very step. Broke down the introduction into subsections, wrote these.  After all of this, wrote my discussion on the project. This step is more like telling our story, the voyage from beginning to end, and all the problems and solutions we came up with.  Wrote the abstract and conclusion. Checked all my references (which were added during writing).   It took me 2 months of serious writing, with a few months of chemdraw images and some procedures and experimentals."

It doesn't even have to be related to my work, it's just important to get into the habit of writing. I collect all my bits of writing in Evernote and tag them and then I have a virtual notebook full of paragraphs and short pieces of writing that I can use and abuse at a later date.

GradSchool,3dwgzk,adamchalupa,11,Mon Jul 20 02:46:20 2015 UTC,"Firstly I would try cross-posting to /r/Edinburgh and maybe /r/Scotland for help with the specifics of flat hunting in that city. Also check out gumtree.com for listings. It's the British Craigslist. Be aware though that it's festival season so don't worry when you see the prices for flats are insane for the month of August. The whole city loses its fucking mind for the duration. Like if SXSW was a theatre festival that lasted a month.   The Student Union will also be able to help with flat hunting. They should have a list of resources as well as information about clubs and societies that will be important for meeting people and even travelling a bit.   Have a look at list.co.uk and theskinny.co.uk for ideas of things to do in the city. The initial weeks before your course starts are going to be lonely so try to get yourself out and about as much as possible. When you're not setting up bank accounts/getting your student card etc, try to travel as much as you can. Glasgow is awesome and the highlands are very close.  The culture shock is impossible to predict. Scottish people do drink a lot and swear a lot and are pretty sarcastic. But they're friendly. Edinburgh's kind of an anomaly in Scotland though as its a bit posher and you'll get people who basically sound English. The weather is honestly always shite. Get a good lightweight waterproof jacket and remember that human skin is basically waterproof. Good shoes too.   As for jet lag, just make sure as soon as you get on the plane you set your watch to Scottish time and then rest according to what it tells you. Drink plenty of water on the flight too. When you arrive, make sure you stay awake until at least 10pm the first two nights and you should be fine after that.  Good luck!"

I did a year of my undergrad in Aberdeen and made some terrific friends by joining a club and drinking with them. I don't know about the new tramway in Edinburgh, but I biked everywhere in Aberdeen. Ceilidhs (pronounced Kai-lees) are Scottish dance parties. Edinburgh is a terrific city, but try to get out to the highlands at least once while you're there. Get a decent umbrella. Everything will be damp all the time compared to TX. Good luck!"
GradSchool,3dwgzk,maplevanwax,3,Mon Jul 20 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"Avoid the trams. In fact, don't mention the trams. If you see a tram, try to pretend it doesn't exist.  I'm partly joking, but they went hopelessly overbudget (~£625m overbudget) and produced a transport network no-one actually wanted, which for long journeys (i.e. city centre to the airport) is worse than the bus it was meant to replace. Oh, also it basically made the city centre a traffic nightmare for 5 years while they actually built it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Trams"

GradSchool,3dwgzk,JugheadStoned,4,Mon Jul 20 06:25:16 2015 UTC,"As a recent transplant from Louisiana to the UK, I can offer the following first-hand experience.  Getting my visa was the worst experience I've had with government ever, and for reference, I file taxes every year. Which by the way, you still have to do even though you'll be living in the UK. It would be prudent to ask an accountant to help you figure out how much to set aside, and you'll need to ask your university if they can give you a tax form with all the relevant information in January, though you can get an extension from the IRS if necessary.  The jet lag will put you in a daze for the first week. I thought I'd be okay, since I was used to waking up early, and figured I could sleep in a little, but I found myself waking up at 3 am for no good reason. Try not to have anything big planned for that first week, and try to write things down instead of depending on your sleep-deprived memory.  Scotland may be easier than the south of england for housing, but I was only prepared for the sticker shock and not the fast pace at which housing seems to disappear.   If you ever cook, you'll quickly realize most receipes are in weights instead of volumes. As in, you will need a kitchen scale, which is something I previously only saw in houses of people who took dieting seriously.  If you are on Sprint, your phone will not work, not even in an emergency. You need a phone with a SIM card. Because you don't have a UK credit card, you will need to buy one right-out and add minutes monthly.  I still haven't gotten my bank account, because I am waiting on a national insurance number. For you, as a student, I think you can get an account with a ""status"" letter from the university. But be prepared to be frustrated.  I used my US credit card and debit card for the first two weeks here, and the transaction fees (3% for international, but that will depend on your company) really suck.   I set up an account on gumtree, spareroom.co.uk, zoopla, and flatshare. You should look at a place before you rent, and look for double-glazed windows, gas heating, and, as a graduate student, probably non-student housing. Student housing, at least where I am, is really loud and gross, like frat-row noise with low socioeconomic area garbage and grime levels.  I got a lot of really great advice a few months before I left from reddit here!"
GradSchool,3dwgzk,aww0110,4,Mon Jul 20 11:00:04 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I'm just wrapping up my MSc at University of Edinburgh. You'll love it, I've had a blast.   Bank accounts: for a one-year student checking account, they're basically the same. I am with Bank of Scotland as there's a branch a stone's throw from my flat. I advise you do the same. Do get an account with a bank here, it makes things a lot easier, like if you don't want to pay international fees/atm fees, get a part-time job, or volunteer with events at the uni and they pay you for that (do SCI-FUN! Your contact is Stuart Dunbar for that. It's a science outreach program the university puts on, and it's a little extra moolah). Apply for a National Insurance Number, that'll let you work (and volunteer w the uni for pay).   Bike: Bikes get stolen here. Don't keep yours locked up outside your flat; bring it in. Get a UV pen and write your details somewhere on it so if it is stolen you can get it back more easily. The bus system in town is great, and it's very walkable.   Program difficulty: No idea! Not my field :P  Flat hunting: As others have said, gumtree.com and through the university (specifically The Advice Place. They're the go-to for everything). Since your program starts in September you won't have to hunt during the Fringe.  General advice: The university puts on a TON of events just for international students in the intro week, and even a lot of international graduate students, or just graduate students! Go to every ceilidh you can (comfy shoes, kilt not required). As for how much stuff costs, it seems pricey because it is (the 20% VAT included in everything doesn't help, but it makes calculating what's in your basket really easy!). Drinks out are costly, anywhere from £3 (rare) to £4, even £5 a pint. A fair amount of places do a student discount; get a Snapfax card from the Advice Place which shows what places do a discount. Some do but aren't in the Snapfax, so always ask!   You'll be at the King's Buildings (KB) campus a lot, which is 2.2 miles south of the central part of town. The uni has a shuttle bus during the school year from the Center campus to KB that runs early in the morning to 6pmish? You can pick up bus ticket vouchers after the shuttle stops running at the KB library if you need to grab a bus to wherever you live.  If you have any other questions, let me know, would be glad to have a distraction from writing my dissertation :P   Edit: I've just realized I'll be around for a while after I wrap up, so if you want to meet up for a pint we should do that!"

Culture shock is going to happen, and it will hurt. Just hang in there until you go back to a normal mood. If you feel lonely or like you don't fit, that happens to the best of us. it takes time. don't worry if at the beginning you Skype with your family a lot and then almost never. also normal.  talk to current students for anything practical. if you're staying for a period of a year, I'd get a bank account, research and talk to students about this. if you want a bike, I'd get an used one once I'm there. feel free to message me if you have any questions!  source: i have lived in 4 countries in 3 continents."
GradSchool,3dwgzk,lilymoffitt,4,Mon Jul 20 06:29:57 2015 UTC,"I've visited Scotland several times over the last few years to work with one of my collaborators.  Here are some of the things I have learned:   If you don't already have one, you're going to want to get a credit card with a smart chip in it.  A lot of credit card readers in Scotland don't take traditional credit cards. You should also plan to regularly withdraw pounds from an ATM machine.  A lot of places in Scotland don't take credit cards at all. Some ATM machines in Scotland dispense Scottish banknotes, which work as well as pounds in Scotland but won't be accepted elsewhere. Don't be surprised if your American bank automatically suspends your debit card shortly after you arrive, even if you warn them beforehand that  you will be travelling.  (This has happened to me every single time I have visited.) Just be sure to have enough cash on hand to deal with this.  You will need to call the bank to get your card turned back on. Your American cellphone will not work unless you have some reason to think that it will. Jet lag has never been a big deal for me.  Your flight will probably be overnight, so you'll be dead tired when you get there, but you should try to avoid sleeping through the first day.  Just take a nap and then try to go to bed at a reasonable time. A lot of the best food in Scotland is Indian and Turkish food.  If you're not familiar with Indian food, just get chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and a mango lassi.  The most popular Turkish food seems to be something called  doner, which is absolutely delicious, and for some reason isn't popular in the U.S. Ordering ""bacon"" will result in something tasty that is only vaguely similar to bacon.  Most places serve something called a full English breakfast that's pretty good, but could really use some pancakes. Sometimes when you order coffee you will be served a french press.  Just wait a few minutes while the coffee steeps, and then press it down slowly before pouring. Fish & chips are tasty, mostly because they have lots of very fresh fish.  Try putting brown sauce on it (both the fish and the fries). ""Sandwich"" usually means something like this.  ""Baguette"" refers to something like this. Guinness on tap is the best.  No, wait, flights of Scotch are the best.  By the way, Scotch is just called ""whisky"" in Scotland. Public transportation tends to be pretty good, though I don't know much about Edinburgh specifically.  If you want to travel somewhere, the thing to do is to buy train tickets.  These can usually be purchased at the train station immediately before travelling, but it's probably better to buy them online a few days beforehand. Be aware that there are two train stations in Edinburgh.  Don't end up at the wrong one! Everyone is very liberal by American standards.  I think of myself as a moderate in the U.S., but when I go to Scotland I'm a crazy conservative. If you arrive in August, you may have some trouble in Edinburgh because of the festival.  For example, you might find that there are no hotel rooms available anywhere in the city. American electronic devices will not work in Scotland unless you get an adapter.  Even then, you have to make sure that 220 volts is ok, or you could fry your device.  See here.  Every outlet also has a switch on it, which turns the power on and off.  Some outlets won't let you plug something in or unplug it unless the switch is off. Perfectly normal-looking bottles of water will sometimes turn out to be carbonated."

You might not be able to find peanut butter or good bbq. Because of the different accent and different words for things (hey, at least it's English, though!) it will take more concentration just to talk to people and it will drain your energy a bit.   Other advice I have read is sound. A bank account will be a good idea. Also, be aware of the immigration rules. When you get there you might have 72 hours to check in with the city hall to declare your presence, stuff like that, and you might be required to get a national ID card.

If you're going that route, you might be better off going to work with a company that will help pay to get you through such a program rather than doing it on your own.  It would take longer, but frankly, I think the work experience will be more valuable.  As for MPA vs MBA, that comes down to you.  What do you want to do for the next decade?

In addition, (and I'm not against online degrees in principle) but my understanding is that the merits of an MBA are to be found primarily in the connections you make while in school. I suppose this is the case in all programs but especially so in an MBA where the focus is primarily on group-work case studies.  Lastly, I'm a huge proponent of education for the sake of knowledge but I'm against racking up serious student loans when you don't see a clear pay-off from doing so. In other words, don't do a master's degree arbitrarily, if it has the potential to damage your financial future.   Good luck."

It is something that is exhausting and takes commitment so I wouldn't jump into anything if you are not ready.    Ultimately, what do you want to get out of the program?

GradSchool,3dv7d2,applemus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"If you enjoyed the labor negotiations, there are entire master's programs that are focused on labor and industrial relations.  Otherwise, I will reiterate what others have already said: STOP and figure out what it is that you want to do in the next ten years. If your alma mater has career services available for alumni (assuming you've graduated), make use of them. Ask about the Myers Briggs personality test, the Strong Interest Inventory, and any other career exploration tools they can provide you. If they don't have that info, ask the great Google or even your local librarian.   MBAs ARE becoming more and more common, so I would advise you, if you did pursue that degree, to find a program with a distinguishing feature that plays up to your interests: an option to focus on venture capitalism, or international development, or human resources, or whatever.

But previously I belonged to a nearby climbing gym and used their stuff pretty regularly."
GradSchool,3dus8g,Izawwlgood,4,Sun Jul 19 20:09:50 2015 UTC,Yes! We have an awesome gym! Our gym was voted as one of the best gyms in the US for a 4-year university. I'm going to miss it next month when I start a new program at another school.
GradSchool,3dus8g,gingerlovingcat,9,Sun Jul 19 21:16:39 2015 UTC,Our school's gym is too overrun with under grads to be able to get a substantial workout in at a reasonable hour.  I was using our pool for a while until I ran into a few students mid-change in the locker room. Now I pay for the pool that's closer to my house.

GradSchool,3dus8g,axel_val,3,Sun Jul 19 23:37:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on the time you go most the time.  Really early morning and towards closing time tend to be least busy as a rule of thumb.  My gym closes at 9, so I go around 7-7:30 and there's usually only 2-3 people at most on the machines I use.  But my gym is also split into two areas, each with two separate weight lifting spots.  The area I use is only machines, no free weights, near the cardio stuff and hockey rink/basketball court.  You just have to find your spot and then scope out the time that works best for you."
GradSchool,3dus8g,I_want_hard_work,4,Mon Jul 20 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"The thing is that undergrads are (in general) on a way later schedule than us.  We keep more ""adult"" hours.

I actually just use Wii Fit U at home, which has actually been pretty incredible at keeping me in shape. It gives more variety than working out at the gym, I don't have to leave my house, and it is convenient to just start and complete a 30-45 minute workout.

It's a great stress reliever and it helps me fit into my clothes. Lol. I sit and stand all day, so it's nice to be able to find a class or run/lift weights to keep me limber and active. There are always a few grad students in my classes, so I don't feel so awkward going to them (I'm often mistaken as an undergrad anyway sooo) . There are also a few professors in the class/on the track/weights area.  With a huge university, the gym facilities are pretty nice - I love it! You should totally use the gym, especially if you're already getting charged for it (unless your department advises against it).

GradSchool,3du72a,TheSimpleMinded,12,Sun Jul 19 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"In the United States, grad school can mean a lot of different things. A graduate degree is anything beyond a bachelor's degree, such as a master's degree, PhD, MD (medical doctor), J.D. (Juris Doctor), and more.  Typically, a master's degree takes about two years, while the other degrees take much longer. A MD is usually four years, while a PhD is usually five years or more.  Some occupations, such as physician's assistant and social work, require a master's level education in their specific program.  Graduate school has some very distinct differences from undergraduate school.   Graduate programs are specialized and intensive--while undergrad contained major courses as well as electives, graduate programs are solely focused on the area of study. Graduate programs typically have a much heavier workload than undergrad. If you are working on a PhD or some master's, you may be required to do a great deal of research and write a thesis. While some undergrad programs (esp. honors programs) require theses, the graduate level thesis will probably require much more work.    I wouldn't stress about looking up programs now. Once you are well established in your undergrad curriculum and have a good idea of what you want your occupation to be, you can look into grad school with a more focused perspective."

GradSchool,3du72a,smday55,3,Sun Jul 19 20:04:13 2015 UTC,"Many graduate schools are geared toward graduating PhDs not Masters.  In general, a PhD is for a future scholar and a Masters is for a future industrialist.  Both usually spend the first year two on the same core courses.  After the core work is completed there is usually a qualifying exam, which Masters students generally don't have to take but PhDs do, Masters students kick out a thesis, maybe take a couple of classes and are done.  PhDs will continue with a year or so of classes and then prepare a dissertation that is supposed to represent a contribution to the pool of human knowledge.   One of the biggest things I notice is that getting through the first year or so requires being a good student.  You have to be able to meet assignment deadlines with quality work, function on low sleep levels, make sense of textbooks and lectures, etc.  And, as NBA rookies notice, pretty much everybody stood out as an undergraduate.  The next bit, thought, requires being a good scholar.  This is something you won't know you have until you get there.  I've seen a lot of great students leave programs because they didn't like or couldn't do research.  I've seen some pretty mediocre students who barely got through the qualifier kick out some great research."
GradSchool,3dvjuq,ipohtwine,16,Sun Jul 19 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"Stop posting about it on Reddit and start writing.   Set daily goals (e.g., write 500 words).  Also set weekly and monthly goals.

Perhaps create an incentive for yourself (if I meet my daily goal X days in a row, I get to do Y)."
GradSchool,3dvjuq,escapevelocity11,6,Sun Jul 19 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is different, but for me it helped to get out of the house and go to a dedicated place to write. When you're home it's easy to procrastinate. My office was in my lab and there were lots people around during the day, so I would go to the library during the day, and then get dinner and work in my lab in the evening. Being alone, but still in a space dedicated to work helped me focus.  Turn off your internet while you're working, and don't turn it on unless you are intentionally taking a break or you need (really need) to look something up. If you need to do research, don't let yourself even check unrelated sites until your scheduled break.  Don't keep your goals to yourself. If you plan to finish a chapter by Friday, tell everyone you can so they can help to hold you accountable. If you have an advisor, tell them about your plan and schedule regular meetings to make sure you are on track and to keep you on a deadline. I find I'm much more productive if other people are expecting things from me.  Lastly, beginning writing is the hardest part, so start with something simple. The methods are usually pretty formulaic so that is where I usually begin, but you could even begin with the acknowledgements or abstract as long as it gets you started.

And it doesn't really feel like anxiety; I will think there will be too much traffic, I don't have the right clothes, I'm a little low on money - anything to prevent myself from having to do whatever is making me afraid. I'm not saying that is what's happening to you, just something to think about. Before I started graduate school, I stayed with my dad for a couple of weeks, cried myself to sleep most nights, didn't want eat, I couldn't think of anything other than how much I didn't want to go to graduate school.   I graduated in December with my PhD, and I'm proud I did it. It sounds like this masters is something you really want to do, but your anxiety is getting in the way. Which is understandable! It can feel like I'm drowning in fear-jello sometimes. But remember all of the other things you have gotten through in life - if you decide to do this, you'll get through it too.  As far as some of the specifics you mentioned: My husband moved 6 months before me when he finished grad school. We made sure to talk often, but we were both so busy that it made the absence a lot easier to deal with. Check with your university and see if they have a ""campus ride"" or shuttle service (police or on-campus security that will drive you around at night). It's very bad press for students on campus to be hurt in a crime, they usually have something to mitigate the chances of that happening. Universities also often offer therapy for their students, it might be worth checking on. Not saying you need it, just might be helpful to ease the transition, regardless of your decision. Lastly, try not to feel like you ""have to"" get your masters, or do this masters in particular. This is a choice, it will help you accomplish something that you value, and you should do it because you want to not because you feel like you have no other options. Good luck!"

If you can't do an Ed major where you are and have to do what sounds like a sketchy grad program instead, I'd look elsewhere.

If we move and I still have to get a masters to teach there, I will start applying this spring after he's settled into a job. If we stay here, I will be applying to another program that sounds like a much better fit (I initially didn't apply because it's through a private school and I thought that tuition would be higher, but it's actually not)."

But I really think you should give it a shot. Whenever I have some big change like that coming up, I get this nervous feeling and feel like I don't want to do it at all, even if it's something I really wanted. I did my undergrad in 3 years and was riddled with anxiety as well, so I can relate to the struggle and exhaustion. Just know nerves are normal, and try your best to tough it out until you've started and had a chance to settle in. If it's wrong for you, that's fine, but you won't know for sure unless you try."

But I'd suggest you read over this post which discusses how to remedy poor grades.  For grad schools, the defining factor is whether you're consistently doing poorly in classes. If you end up with one or two poor grades, admissions committees understand that people are human and stuff happens. They'll probably assume something was happening in your personal life that influenced your grades that term (and as you said you were going through things, they wouldn't be wrong).  Now if you had a fair number of poor performances, then you'd have reason to be worried. Otherwise, I'd just apply so long as you aren't showing poor marks in many classes."
GradSchool,3dr55n,newyorker9789,8,Sat Jul 18 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"A good student in a STEM field can often get a ""free ride"" for a master's. That means, no tuition, and a stipend for being a teaching or research assistant. A master's gives you further education/training, which will be desirable for many jobs in that you will be advanced beyond what you would have with a BA/BS. People with PhDs are overtrained for many of those jobs; they will want an academic of a research position, which will not compete with most jobs posted for people with a masters. If you go for a master's, and like it and are good at it, you can also apply for a Ph.D. afterwards, although it may take you a little longer that way.  Talk to your academic adviser, not us!!"
GradSchool,3dr55n,ProfessorUnrat,2,Sat Jul 18 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's common for MS students to get RA positions these days. Hell, it's hard enough for PhD students to get funding with these terrible grant success rates. I've never seen an MS student get a full RA position."
GradSchool,3dr55n,OpticaScientiae,3,Sun Jul 19 05:54:04 2015 UTC,"To address the how do you contact the PI's question, you can basically just email them cold, unless you happen to have a connection to them through another professor. Just send a polite email with a brief blurb on who you are and what your interests/goals are, tell them you admire their work and would love to talk with them and possibly work with them. Also look in to REU's for next summer.   As far as the masters question, it's a bit more complicated. If your goal is to ultimately get a PhD, there's no point going for your masters, just jump right in to PhD programs. While every school differs, generally masters programs are not funded, while PhDs are (I can see in the comments some people have their masters funded, but I have to say this isn't the norm, so definitely check when you're looking in to programs). Similarly, some schools don't actually take masters students who aren't also looking to get a PhD, so the list of school you could apply to could be narrowed. Definitely check this out too.   I don't know anything much about your background or career goals, but just as my general two cents, I'd say stick with the PhD plan. If you think you're going to want one, no point delaying it, particularly when getting a masters first won't offer any significant benefits in this case and will likely cost you quite a bit of money. However, if you're unsure if academia is right for you or if getting a PhD is really what you want, it may be worth considering a masters.  I did my masters first and now am in a PhD, although I took a fairly strange path, but I'd be happy to answer any questions if you have them about my experience."
GradSchool,3dr55n,MinaHarker1897,4,Sat Jul 18 21:27:08 2015 UTC,"It depends what your career and financial goals are. Masters programs you need to pay for, and are generally easier to get into. PhD programs award a Masters, are harder to get into, and you will receive a stipend. That said, taking a Masters from a PhD program is generally viewed negatively.  I would say in the biological fields, a Masters is not terribly valuable, given the absolute glut of PhDs. Generally speaking, the Masters students I know and know of are either using it as a stepping stone to get into a PhD program, dropped out of a PhD program (for various reasons, some wholly valid), or already have an advanced tech position lined up in industry.  Of course, YMMV"
GradSchool,3dr55n,Izawwlgood,3,Sat Jul 18 18:08:26 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with all of this, but there are certainly masters programs you don't need to pay for. All of the students in my masters program were attending for free, and about half of us were teaching/research assistants and receiving a stipend. I get the feeling it's not the norm, but if you're interested and look around enough, you can probably find one."
GradSchool,3dr55n,Hal_Pal,3,Sat Jul 18 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"Well, that's certainly true. It's harder to get into those kind of programs, especially because there are so many people who are willing to do an unfunded master program. Of course, it's silly for anyone to do an unfunded master in the US unless it's to recuperate from a terrible undergrad for a later PhD."

It demonstrates a reflexive understanding of your interests and that you're not tied to one specific project. Moreover, it will placate your committee about burning out and losing interest in your topic a few years down the line.   The downsides are a loose foundation, but by this point professors typically trust you to know how to read efficiently/find out seminal pieces. Additionally, professors are usually keen on giving you some articles and books to see how you receive them as an outsider.  Ultimately, I wouldn't over think it too much. Depending on your course work option(s) you may not even be behind, as most people re-read things they've read when they get into their PhD program because they'll get something different from it reading it after having completed an MA or RAship."

Then you apply to those places with your writing sample as best prepared as you can possibly make it--it's ok if it's on Nietzsche or Hegel--and say that you're interested in ancient and explain why in your statement of intent. If you've written a good writing sample, there are people there who will be able to tell, and there are also people there who do what you want to do. You wont be committed to doing German philosophy on arrival.  Now, if by ""focused mainly"" on the former you mean ""no one is going to be able to tell I have any interests or background outside of German philosophy from my transcripts"" you might be in a little more trouble, but the same idea applies: find places where there's overlap between what you have done and what you want to do it, then ingratiate yourself with the people you want to work with if/when you get in.

Let me add my usual caveat: the Gourmet Report, while the biggest and most well-known ranking of philosophy departments, is essentially a popularity contest run by someone who appears to be an asshole. It does tell you about the general ""consensus"" regarding a department across the discipline, but it should absolutely be regarded as the starting point, and not the ending point, of your research into departments. Once you get a general idea from the PGR, I would suggest looking at the schools themselves to determine (a) who you would work with there (and whether the ranking is based on one old guy who's retiring or moving next year), (b) what the funding is like, (c) what their placement record is, etc.   I did not know that Cambridge was 'good' for 19th Century German Philosophy!   Hmmm. It isn't. Why did I think that? Probably because I just get the various UK departments confused... Oh yes. I though Chris Janaway was there, but he's actually at Southampton.  As for German philosophy vs. Ancient? Because I think Nietzsche, Kant, and the various German philosopher-scientists are much more interesting than Plato and Aristotle. But that's a personal preference."

GradSchool,3dr7wo,MaceWumpus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:58:28 2015 UTC,"Leiter's just outspoken. But the PGR is generally not really contested by anyone outside of the SPEP crowd.   The second sentence is definitely false. Literally every philosopher of science I've talked to thinks that the PGR philosophy of science sub-field rankings are imperfect at best. They acknowledge that there aren't better rankings out there, but I have never heard one of them say that the PGR rankings are good; one philosopher of biology at a major department told me to just throw the biology rankings out. There's a difference here between saying that the whole project is worthless (almost certainly false) and saying that the rankings are flawed representations of the field (almost certainly true). The former may be a fringe position; the latter is not.  Additionally, despite Leiter's rhetoric, the people who were challenging him this last time around weren't just continental philosophers or ""fringe""; they were very well respected philosophers (much better philosophers than Leiter himself) at places like MIT and NYU who had serious qualms about the PGR and/or its management.   As for Leiter being an asshole, I thought the emails that surfaced were pretty damning on that count. Now, I hear that he's a really nice person face-to-face--hence the qualifier in my original statement. But people can be assholes in one context and really nice in another, and it seems to me that all of the publicly available evidence points to him being a truly horrendous person to have a disagreement with (including, I'll add, his professional work on Nietzsche, which is (a) really bad and (b) filled with personal attacks on those who disagree with him)."
GradSchool,3dr7wo,PhDforaDay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.

GradSchool,3doj6u,rainydayoctober,15,Sat Jul 18 01:10:46 2015 UTC,"I am proud to say that I had no connections whatsoever.  I applied to probably 40 jobs over the span of a few months.  Eventually, a recruiter from the company I am currently at sent an email to me (may have even been a mass email), and I replied to her telling her that I felt I would be great for the position and would apply right away.  I did so and got interviews a few weeks later.    I did leave with a masters degree, and it was even non-thesis.  People in industry don't seem to care whether it is thesis or not, even though there is a big difference in academia.  At my company, non-PhDs actually can rise way to the top.  I think some of the tip-top positions are more easily given to PhDs, and I think having a PhD commands more respect, but it is not necessary.  It's funny because people in academia told me I wouldn't be able to do research if I left, and I'm a senior researcher.  Other companies may be different though.  If you read my responses to one of the other comments, you can see why I left.  There were a lot of factors out of my control, coupled with a lack of interest and drive, coupled with the realization that I was in it primarily for ego, and (to be completely candid) coupled with my fear of failing any kind of oral grilling due to my social anxiety, which usually renders me unable to think clearly even when I know the correct answer on paper.

I met one Phd student who told me that she left because she didn't have a clear plan of what to do afterwards. The other reason had to do with the opportunity cost of continuing, that is, she wanted to make more money.  2) How did your advisor feel about you leaving? My PI got a bit upset when she had a couple of PhD candidates leave after 2 years (they went on to law school and med school).  3) What kind of job do you have now? What are the pros/cons in working in industry?"
GradSchool,3doj6u,Izawwlgood,8,Sat Jul 18 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"1)  There are a few answers to this question.  a.  I wasn't interested enough in my field ""expand the boundary of human knowledge"" in that area.  I was more the type that just wanted to make cool stuff and make money rather than become hyper-focused on one thing.  b.  I hated that my work was so esoteric and didn't seem to have any real-world application or help anyone.    c.  I felt that I was mainly in the PhD because of ego.  I wanted to attain ""the highest"" degree.  If academic titles were stripped away, I would have probably never embarked on the PhD.  And ego is a weak reason to pursue something.  d.  I went from one hyper-motivated professor to a super lazy one that always stayed home ""sick"" or took trips for weeks or months.    e.  I have huge social anxiety when public speaking, and I failed the oral part of my first qualifying exam.  I could have re-taken it, but I just didn't want to deal with going into the ringer again.  f.  My lazy PI lost funding for me for a month (and the dept picked it up after that) and had a history of empty promises.  I didn't want to deal with the fear of losing funding (which was my paycheck) because I wouldn't have been able to pay the bills.    2)  My adviser wasn't too bad about it, but like I said above, he had lost funding for me and I had only been in his lab for about 8 months, so he didn't lose too much.  He had had much worse cases of people leaving in the past.    3)  I am a senior researcher at a medical device company.    Pros:  $$, the work that you do actually matters to a lot of people, you don't take your work home with you  Cons:  8.5 hour days feel long,  lots of protocols and paperwork, less freedom in the ideas you can pursue because you answer to supervisors  (although in research there is still a bit of freedom, just not as much as academia!)"

I honestly just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, and I'm rapidly finding that self loathing and ego pursuing isn't enough reason to put yourself through all this crap if you don't enjoy it.

GradSchool,3doj6u,_Zell,3,Sat Jul 18 18:13:36 2015 UTC,Good for you! I'm glad you've found something that makes you happy.  Do you think you're taken as seriously as PhDs? We're you limited in what jobs were willing to consider you without a PhD.
GradSchool,3doj6u,CaptainDickFarm,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:48 2015 UTC,"I think anyone with a higher degree is always going to be taken more seriously.  That's just the world that we live in, where things are based on credentials and academic titles.  I'd personally rather live in a world where you are judged based on how knowledgeable you are and how well you perform in your position.  There are many smart PhDs but there were also PhD students that just got walked through everything by either their PI or other people.  And after years of research in industry working on big projects, are you really less qualified than someone who just did a different project in an academic environment and then got letters behind their name for it?"
GradSchool,3doj6u,NUnato,2,Sat Jul 18 04:01:31 2015 UTC,What was your field of study? How much do you think your experiences in grad school contributed to you being qualified for your current job in industry?
GradSchool,3doj6u,CaptainDickFarm,2,Sat Jul 18 02:14:18 2015 UTC,My field is chemistry/materials-science.  All the research I did in undergrad and graduate school qualified me for what I do now.
GradSchool,3doj6u,CaptainDickFarm,2,Sat Jul 18 02:20:00 2015 UTC,How long were you in the program before you decided to leave? Were you able to leave immediately with a master's?
GradSchool,3doj6u,dbzgtfan4ever,2,Sat Jul 18 04:10:28 2015 UTC,I was in the program for a little over 1 year (Fall + Spring + Fall semesters) when I made the decision that I would leave.  Then I finished my fourth semester (Spring) and left with a non-thesis masters degree.  So it ended up being ~21 months or two academic years.
GradSchool,3doj6u,bulkthehulk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:17:16 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of leaving the program now so that I don't have to worry about cumes in the fall. (I've only been in the program for a year). But every ""I left my PhD program"" story is about people who are ABD. I don't really want to go through the ringer of cumes if I'm not going to stay, but then I would lose my funding. Did you lose your funding immediately?"
GradSchool,3doj6u,bulkthehulk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how much you love your field.    I don't know whether your cumes are oral, written or both (mine were both), but if you really want to be at the cusp of your field and are passionate, you can get through the cumes with a bit of work, and you shouldn't let that stop you.    As far as funding goes, I think it depends on your PI.  If you are working on a project, you may be able to stay on funding for awhile as you finish up a project or whatever.  The other thing is that they won't know until you announce it.  In my situation, my PI was having money issues with the entire lab when I was considering leaving (and it contributed to my decision).  I also wanted to be as honest as possible and announce my decision so as to not lead anyone on and then abruptly quit.  However, in theory, you could apply for work and then announce it much later on.  I ended up talking to professors early on and securing a TAship for my last semester and took out a tiny bit in loan money to help cover living expenses.  It wasn't too bad for taking the completely honest route haha."

GradSchool,3dlje6,quicklywho,44,Fri Jul 17 06:30:06 2015 UTC,"A PhD is earned by the work you did, not by the conclusions you reach. If your code is doing something wrong that you didn't realize, it's certainly not a good situation to be in, but it doesn't invalidate the fact that you put a lot of work into getting to this point and accumulated a lot of expertise in the subject along the way, and because of that, it shouldn't mean that your PhD is toast. Heck, just the fact that you were able to realize that your code wasn't doing what you thought is a sign that you are very familiar with your project.  Now, it is probably true that nobody would notice if you didn't say anything, but I don't think it's worth wrecking your conscience for it. I'd say talk to your supervisor and express that you'd like to correct this. If you've just done the preliminary submission before your defense, you can send a correction to your readers and incorporate the correct results into your defense. Or if you've submitted the final version to your university's thesis repository, it might not be too late to request that your submission be retracted until you can fix it. And if it is too late... well, nobody checks archived dissertations for correctness, so while there's nothing you can do, it doesn't matter. Just make sure that if you cite or reference your thesis anywhere (like in your CV), you give a source where an updated version with the correct results will be available.  For what it's worth, I found a math error in my thesis - after graduating - that could have invalidated the main conclusion of the work and two published papers based on it... if it hadn't been canceled out by another math error later on in the derivation. So I know what it's like to panic about these things. If that helps ;-)"

The good news is that after crunching numbers all night, I'm tentatively hopeful that my conclusions are unchanged and that my results are actually better than they were before. I still have some explaining to do, but I think this is the best possible outcome.  I have just done the preliminary submission, so that's good. I will speak with my supervisor soon and see what the best course of action is. For the record, I never considered not telling anyone - it just occurred to me that this probably happens all the time and not everyone would be up front.

You may (or may not) have trouble getting into a top top program like MIT, but that probably varies by field, and regardless I would expect you should be able to get into at least a respectable program if you have good grades/GRE's.  Not sure how much research experience matters for Master's admissions but having that, even in a different field, also can't hurt.    If you're applying directly to Ph.D. programs, you might have some trouble switching to an entirely new field since professors will always prefer students with relevant research experience.  If you've done well so far you might be able to find a spot somewhere, but it will likely be a lower-ranked program.  I would NOT recommend starting a Ph.D. directly from undergrad if you are completely changing fields since it's hard to know how much you'll enjoy the research if you haven't already done something similar.  A Master's would allow you to get your feet wet in a shorter term project and also make you more competitive for Ph.D. programs since you'll have some relevant experience by the end of it.  TL;DR If you're doing a Master's first (which I recommend), I think you'll be OK.  Ph.D. might be more of a problem."

Consider this: * You do not procrastinate much   You are motivated You stay on task You are applying good time management skills   The problem is your time estimates for tasks. For most of my undergrad I was a full-time soldier and a full-time student, usually working 100-20 hours a week between the two. When I got to gradschool I felt like I was not getting anything done, much like you. It took me a while to realize that I was vastly underestimating the time requirements for my tasks.  The nature of a graduate work is different from discipline to discipline, but they all require a lot of time. I do a lot of cross-disciplinary work, and the time I devote to the same task in the different fields are completely different. Even if you are doing your graduate work in the same field as your undergraduate, the graduate version of the work consumes much more time.   I think the best advice I could offer is:   1) increase the time estimates  2) schedule regular breaks, and take more of them than you would have in undergrad  You know the problem is not in your work ethic or time management, so incrementally increase the amount of time you expect a task to take until it is an accurate assessment. You also need to schedule breaks. What you are doing is not only more time intensive but also more mentally intensive. That means you need more breaks during a set period time than you are used to giving yourself. Failing to do so will only wear you out faster, making it take longer than if you had taken a break. Secondly, because the period of time it will take you to get something done is greater, the number of breaks will also need to increase. In short, take more breaks more often, or you will get even less done.  I had a hard time with this last part. I would just get into my zone and try and power through my work without breaks like I had done in undergrad. A few hours later I would realize I had stopped accomplishing much of anything a few hours ago. Not only was I to exhausted to get much more done that day, but I had also wasted a few hours from trying to work while being burnt out (as a side note, you will get burnt out. You need to plan for when this inevitably happens, not just to try and avoid it). To get around this problem, I set a timer for 50-60 minutes. When the timer went off I stopped. I did not hit the snooze button and work for just five more minutes, I stopped. I would then force myself to take a break. I would sometimes set a timer for10-20 minutes. Other times I would watch an episode of the Colbert Report, or play a round of some sort of computer game (usually MechWarrior or some other game with a timed match length).  I hope some of this helps, and was not too long."
GradSchool,3dm540,orangecamo,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"The thing with research is it takes time. For me, it fluctuates. I have intensely busy 15 hour days then several 2 or 3 hour days then some pretty steady 8 hour days. Also, when you are doing research, you are (or at least should be) doing something no one has ever done. There are always going to be differences and things won't always work right the first time. My adviser always tells me ""if research were easy/fast/worked the first time, everyone would get PhDs in a year."" I always aim to do something every day that brings me closer to finishing, that is all anyone can ask of you. Also, remember to take some time for yourself. You are only in your first year and you don't want to get burned out. It is a marathon, not a sprint."
GradSchool,3dm540,insomniac365,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:07:34 2015 UTC,"This is how it goes. Even if you proactively manage and stay on top of things, other things come up, or the things you thought would be a cinch take some unexpected extra work to get through. Part of that is human nature - we can be horrible judges of how long things will actually take us to complete.  The summer research planning thing happens to everyone I've talked to, and it's happened to me every year. Maybe a combination of typical poor human judgment and ridiculous enthusiasm.  I would be another vote for the ""welcome to research"" approach - you are totally not alone in this. It's been a huge part of my learning process to understand what I can and cannot realistically accomplish/promise by a particular date."
GradSchool,3dm540,littlesigmasquared,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:38:16 2015 UTC,I discovered this phenomena quickly when I began working in a research lab as an undergraduate.

GradSchool,3dn7ad,no_other_plans,2,Fri Jul 17 17:13:54 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on flexibility of your institution and advisor. Perhaps you could get a co-supervisor who has more expertise in the area. Or propose a collaboration with a group at another institution so you can spend some time there, although that's more complicated in terms of funding.  I was in a similar situation for an interdisciplinary project during my Master's thesis, my PI was fine with starting a collaboration with a different department. But he had lots of funding and didn't really care about sharing 'credit', he also understood that the project wasn't his area of expertise and would benefit from outside support.  A switch wouldn't necessarily burn bridges if you are early in the program, just don't let it drag on too long if you are confident of your decision, and don't actually say to anyone that you think your supervisor isn't a 'real' expert."

GradSchool,3divj0,2015throwawayPhD,8,Thu Jul 16 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I am very sorry you're going through such a tough time in what should be the most focused and productive learning experience of your academic career. At this point, I have a few tips I suggest you take.      1 ) Communicate with your PI exclusively via e-mail. He's already proven his word cannot be trusted, and should you go over his head to the dean, e-mails can be used to help procure a good defense. Otherwise, you absolutely can expect for your side not to be taken on a PhD-vs-PI basis. On this note, it's worth thinking about polite ways to essentially spam his inbox. PIs like this aren't stupid, and will avoid e-mailing you. Act stupid if you must and lie about a glitch or say you didn't know if he got it. Mark (URGENT) in your subject lines. He will respond.     2) You need to think of what you have to lose. I suggest sending your PI one e-mail being very frank and direct about what you are experiencing vs. what you expected, and how that directly relates to what he verbally told you. If things get worse or heated, forward the conversation to his superior. What would you lose by dropping him as a PI? Would you have to restart your PhD? Could you transfer to another project with another advisor?   My point here is that if you have nothing to lose and you've already been very direct with him about your experience vs what he told you, do whatever it takes to drop his ass.      3) I'm glad that you've meditated. I do hope that you continue to do it. Get into a ritual. Only allot yourself so many hours a day to do work - even if it's a lot of hours and a lot of work - don't go over. Compromising your mental and physical health to a degree is part of being a grad student, but there is a threshold. Don't kill yourself. Don't make achieving your goals be detrimental to your own health.       good luck!"
GradSchool,3divj0,E4R,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the support.  These are all very good strategies.  I think I need to try and have another frank discussion with the guy about the expectations versus reality--something I'm not looking forward to doing but something that's probably necessary at this point.    I won't lose anything by staying with the dude; I'm close to finishing and he can't do much else to screw me over (the work I'm doing now is minimal, so is something that I can put up with).  It's more that I'm completely fed up with him.  Good advice about thinking about what I have to lose by leaving.  At this point I'm not sure.  I think I should talk with a postgrad rep in administration about it.  The mental health element is one of the most important things I've learned about this entire process. Reached somewhat of a breaking point a year or two ago.  Now I'm doing a much better job trying to take care of myself.  I think PhD is stressful for everyone.  It's about making sure that you don't let the stress completely take over your life."
GradSchool,3divj0,thielemodululz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with securing your work agreements and contracts. I am simply blown away at he percentage of students on here who go into PhD programs with funding that is tenuous to temporary at best, often none at all. It's probably no coincidence that the majority of students complaining on here are falling into this category, it is a huge source of problems. A stable student can't do good work, and neither can a disgruntled one.   Look for a lab that can fund you and has a history of getting all of its students to graduation (students not dropping out or changing labs) with decent publications. Generally a source of stable funding is going to be tied to an already funded project that has required objectives, outcomes and deadlines, so you might think you will be giving up some freedom with the direction you can take your thesis, but projects are written to leave room for innovation (that's the point of the project!), so you will still have plenty of opportunity to be a real scientist. However, this small sacrifice in perceived freedom is worth the security and in the end the stable environment will give you the opportunity to do those side projects and innovative things you've been thinking about."
GradSchool,3divj0,thielemodululz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"""A stable student can't do good work, and neither can a disgruntled one."" Perfect way of putting it.  Often it's not about the workload- people work hard all the time and do fine- its the emotional labour and stress brought on by crummy situations that goes along with that workload.  Starting a PhD without steady funding might be OK if you know exactly what you're getting in to (I personally wouldn't do it); it gets worse when things are unclear.  There's a lot of PhD horror stories involving advisers.  From what I gather most university regulations are pretty lax in terms of the requirements and rights.  This needs to change, both on paper and in practice.  Every PhD should start with a 1 day brief explaining requirements and offering an overview of the support structures available for them if things start going awry.  You've also hit the nail on the head when it comes to assessing past performance at a place as an indication of what's to be expected.  Although the university is decent, my specific section has a pretty bad history of students switching out, low publication records, etc.  A good, structured, project is a plus to all this. If you're considering a PhD, you should try and do a informational interviews with current students, asking them very specific questions related to 1) funding stability 2) outside work requirements and 3) level of adviser supervision/support.  I'd bet most students would hesitate to talk down their program, but asking quantifiable questions would be a way of getting the info in a straightforward manner."

GradSchool,3djxgv,ihatechickens,10,Thu Jul 16 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"Probably not. Graduate school is more like a job than an extension of college. If you want to party all the time and go to sporting events, you either aren't going to get a phd or it will take you ten years. Also, the bulk of people living in grad student dorms are international students, and in my experience they have more on the line than domestic students, and tend to work crazy hours. Not to mention that most grad student dorms are more like apartments, so they don't have that dorm feeling.   Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that there's nothing fun about grad school--people drink and hang out, but it's more of a low key vibe. Most people in their mid/late 20s early 30s would rather have a beer and conversation than go to a rager with a bunch of teenagers. School spirit and sports pride is also minimal (and I go to a big sports school). People tend to care more about their undergrad institution, and no one really is that invested."

If you're still young or not obviously much older, you can probably make undergrad friends pretty easily and do stuff with them if you wanted.

It's not just my department either, all the science/math/engineering departments seem to have drinking events going on both on and off campus. The grad student union has a yearly kegger.  Even the professors join in; we have a department happy ""hour"" every few months with undergrad seniors, grad students and professors that ends up kinda wild. My advisor was talking about starting a weekly trip to a brewpub at lunch.  The dorms are pretty awful so people tend to rent houses off campus, and we have about a dozen frats and sororities.   I'd say I go out to bars twice a week and party/go clubbing every 3 weeks during the school year.

Like did you just get low grades for like 1-3 semesters and then brought them back up or did you consistently get a mix of B's and C's? If it was concentrated in a specific time period it might be easier to explain that something dramatic happened. If you consistently got lower grades then maybe it will be harder to explain. I think it can be good to show that you went through something and overcame it, but you also want to be careful about over sharing, you can allude to something severe happening but you don't have to share the details on getting raped etc, but maybe let them know that you were recently diagnosed with PTSD due to events that occurred in your childhood and that you have a whole new outlook now that you are being treated for that, maybe you could reflect on how this experience has changed you or will give you a unique perspective on your work etc. Be careful to not let it sound like a sob story, a lot of people have had rough lives and are able to do well in school, (but yes sometimes things do happen to affect you) focus on what you learned and how you have taken steps to improve your life and outlook."
GradSchool,3di2t1,E4R,4,Thu Jul 16 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be the negative one here. Sorry, a 3.7 in community college won't do much for you. A 2.4 is almost certainly to low for most programs. You could try, But it is unlikely to work out. Better to find something else to do.   You can explain away a bad semester that drops you down, but explaining away a 2.4 is pretty unlikely. Remember that grad school is much harder than undergrad."
GradSchool,3di2t1,greytoque,3,Thu Jul 16 21:40:58 2015 UTC,I know you're torn between looking like you're just making excuses and fearing the admissions will view you as a poor student if you don't explain. I believe Admissions departments usually take into consideration death in the family. Go with that. I'm very sorry you went through such an enormously horrendous experience - just make it clear that you had severe circumstances which led to your lower-than-average GPA. Good luck.
GradSchool,3di2t1,regular_guy_26,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"Fairly certain the Grad School won't take personal problems into account, when reviewing your grades. Life is hard. We all have problems. What would that say about their admission standards, if they accepted you, with sub-standard grades, simply because you feel you had a tough life? What about the person who emigrated here from China without any money, no family support, working 40hrs/wk to pay through undergrad, and maintained a 4.0? If that person had a 2.0, would you expect the grad-school to accept them, just because they had it tough coming up?   I'm sorry you had a hard time of it. Really, I sympathize, but life is tough and really SUCKS sometimes. Next, you'll want to companies you're going to apply to jobs with after grad-school, to consider hiring you even though your undergrad records blow, simply because mommy died and your depressed.  I don't mean to be harsh, sorry... but life IS harsh.  It's sort of like giving ALL the kids trophies, simply for playing (even the last place team). We're doing a generation of children an injustice by coddling them and pussifying them.  And now I'll wait to get flamed, and told how insensitive I am.  Flame away Reddit."

Apart from him getting paid from a scarce money pool, I don't see why this would be an issue? Why would he have a project when his project is doing whatever you want? Teach him what you need him to know for your project to advance faster and that's it. Use him to advance your own work.  This advisor of your is an hands-off and feet-off supervisor. Stop thinking he exists because he doesn't. Use all the money possible to advance your projects for graduation or to write more papers, use that kid like he's your slave and stop relying on this advisor of yours because he checked out a long time ago."
GradSchool,3dgo2j,biocomputer,11,Thu Jul 16 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"Have you ever supervised a new undergrad student, let alone a high school student?  They are useless.  They're more of a hindrance than a help.  I certainly wouldn't trust one to do any part of my project.  After a few months a decent undergrad could do some of the more basic lab work.  If the OP's student is only around until school starts again in September they might just be getting the hang of things by the time they leave the lab, but maybe not even by then because as the OP said, they've never even used a pipette (for people outside the field: a pipette is the most basic piece of equipment in just about any molecular-biology-related lab).  An undergrad that's going to stick around for a year or two can be a great asset, a high school student that's only there for 2 months won't be much use to the lab."
GradSchool,3dgo2j,thielemodululz,4,Thu Jul 16 05:34:57 2015 UTC,"You can get productivity out of inexperienced people. The thing is that you have to realize they aren't going to learn your project or how to advance it. You need to give them ONE thing or ONE specific task that they need to be in charge of, like making buffers or weighing stuff or any other kind of repetitive task in the lab you hate doing. They can also wash your glassware, fill pipette tip boxes, etc.   Maybe they have a special talent you don't know about. One year we had a high school kid with no lab experience, never held a pipette like your student. He seemed pretty worthless. Then we found out he was the president of an electronics club and that he had this whole other skillset we hadn't even considered. He ended up building some control systems on some cheap incubators, essentially turning them into expensive incubators, that enabled some new types of experiements. We even loaned him out to some other labs to help them fix some electronics on their broken equipment in exchange for favors from those other labs later. Find that silver lining."

A lot of REU and high school program funding comes from separate grants and outreach initiatives that are much easier to get than say an NIH or NSF grant.   Having a summer student is also great for a CV and to get your first taste of advising. If you can't manage a summer student how are you going to manage your own lab one day? You're also going to be an important part in that student's career path. If he/she has a good experience it might lead to a career in science/academia and can be a big help in getting them into a better college or grad school. You should consider the ripple effect being a good mentor can have, and try not to let the inconvenience of it or your own distaste for your advisor get in the way."

GradSchool,3dfkur,TheDozenOne,5,Wed Jul 15 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's typical, but it's certainly common. I remember my first conference in grad school. Our PI basically ignored everyone from the lab in and out of talks. One of our other 1st years broke off from the group at lunch time the second day and tried to glom on to the PI to bring him to lunch with us. She ended up tagging along with the PI to lunch with his peers, and later reported that it was a pretty miserable experience--conversations she didn't follow, basically ignored by everyone except for a brief moment when she got put on the spot about research and had nothing coherent to say.   The thing to remember is that your profs see you regularly, but generally only get to interact with their direct peers & old grad school/post doc pals in person a few times per year. Conferences are a time for profs & grad students to network & socialize with others outside their regular daily circle. Some of us also treat conferences as quasi-vacations: when you're on vacation, do you want people from work interrupting your flow to make small talk?   In short, don't worry about it! If anything, wait until you get back to your home institution then chat briefly with them about the talks & research that excited you both."

GradSchool,3dg56q,momosito,6,Thu Jul 16 00:29:30 2015 UTC,The road to being a tenured professor in Physics is probably the worst it's been in decades. You have to really want it and know that you can dedicate a lifetime to it. It would also help to get a realistic assessment of the path and work involved from current faculty. For most of your life you would be making well below industry wages for your experience.   Not trying to be harsh here.
GradSchool,3dg56q,MedPhysPHD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:29:37 2015 UTC,I see. What would be my opportunities as proceeding forward from a B.S in Physics?
GradSchool,3dg56q,MedPhysPHD,3,Thu Jul 16 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"I want to say something before I torpedo your dreams here. Professors at major universities have a significant part of their time dedicated to research, and most of them are hired/fired based primarily on their research. Teaching is a tertiary concern. Not to say that you can't find good teachers, but that isn't what is really rewarded.  This does not preclude teaching at the high school, community college, or liberal arts college level. Since most don't have to work the tightrope walk of grant funding, they dedicate their full time towards teaching. And it isn't a bad gig by any means. They work for 9-10 months of the year and then have summers to pursue other projects. That can mean working another job, volunteering, or  vacationing depending on your finances. STEM teachers in general will always be in demand because, and I'll be blunt, they don't make nearly what industrial jobs do. But if you are truly passionate about it, it can really be bliss and it's an occupation that has the easiest time incorporating a family. Benefits and salary also tend to go up over time, and you earn a pension at public institutions.  What I am trying to point out here is that those who want to teach science are and have been increasingly going elsewhere to do it. That is just how that works.   As for what you can do now, most universities have teaching workshops, programs, etc. that can help those pursue an education minor or get real experience in a classroom. Talk to an advisor to see if something like that exists at your school."
GradSchool,3dg56q,savdec449,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:30:23 2015 UTC,"Plus, most academic jobs (regardless of discipline) go to people from the top 10 or 20 programs. So you need to have done well enough in undergrad to get into a program that will give you the chance of an academic job in the future."
GradSchool,3dg56q,Izawwlgood,2,Thu Jul 16 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"Generally -  After undergrad you would apply to a PhD program in some area of physics. After getting your PhD you would apply for postdocs. After doing a few postdocs, you would apply for tenure track positions. After spending a couple of years teaching and heading a lab or a group, you would submit your tenure package.  The thing to remember is that every step of this includes the presumption of 'having done exemplary work in the previous step, at a top tier institution, and having more than a small amount of luck on your side'.  Tenured professors earn well, probably 90-130k or so, though that is not remotely commensurate with the time spent schooling and working, and is at least in the life sciences, only about 2-6% of PhD recipients go on to become tenured professors."
GradSchool,3dg56q,Tertbutyl42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:26:10 2015 UTC,"If it's being a teacher that appeals to you, then you would have a much easier time teaching physics at a high school level. Not saying you should give your dreams of course, but everyone I know who is on their way to becoming a professor doesn't really do anything except work in the lab/read about the field. You have to dedicate your entire life to achieving it, so if that's not something you're prepared to do (I'm definitely not, I like my free time!), then it's probably not for you.  If you have your B.S. in physics, I would expect you could get into a masters program for just about any hard science (chemistry, biology). Maybe even buisiness or education, but I have no idea for sure."
GradSchool,3dg56q,Second_Foundationeer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:07:23 2015 UTC,"It's not likely to be a successful road (if success = tenured professorship). The numbers are terrible. In my subfield, I looked at two ""young"" professors that I worked/work with to get a sense of what their publication rate was if I wanted to become a professor. I think I remember counting something like 9 publications during PhD+postdoc for the experimentalist (I think about a half of them were PRLs). There was something in the ballpark of ~20 during PhD+postdoc+staff scientist for the computationalist/theorist (including many PRLs, some higher tier but specific to plasma journals, and one Science publication which is rare for fusion apparently). These two profs are young enough that they provide a good sense of what's necessary, but it's also only gotten more difficult to become a professor because funding has tightened since then..  Of course, it also depends on the subfield. If you went into condensed matter, you are probably more able to find a job in industry afterwards so you can have the best of both worlds."

I've never heard of a rejection letter being approved by a dean, but my knowledge of administrative workings across the country isn't that great. It's much less usual to be accepted without an interview, but it does happen.  Usually it's because of some mitigating circumstance (the applicant lives outside the country, or has unsurmountable time conflicts, for example.)   So maybe this means some sort of acceptance offer is on the way to you.  However, it does seem like you're missing some key information about what's going on, and if you're accepted, it will be under strange/confusing circumstances, and with limited options.  If you're very passionate about graduate school, it might be worth considering pursuing something related for a year (finding a job in a related field, taking some additional classes if that option is open to you, etc.) and then have another try at the GRE and the application process again in the next year or two, with more experience and maybe some better scores.  That could result in you being much more secure and confident entering the next stage of your education.  Graduate school is hard enough on self-image and emotional health already; going into it feeling shaky about your own confidence level, or the confidence of others in you, would be a rough position to start from."
GradSchool,3deq6r,neurobeegirl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:39:22 2015 UTC,This was unimaginably helpful. Thank you so much for you detailed response! I understand now that maybe something related to funding afforded them to contact me at this time.   Thanks!

I am in a bio masters program and there are NO official interviews for our program. It is certainly not a top notch program, but it is very research based. If a student has found an advisor who is willing to accept them into their lab, that lab has funding, and the student meets some basic GPA/GRE criteria they are accepted. Oh, and a personal essay in the application.   I think of it like you interview with your advisor, so maybe if this professor you are emailing with likes you that's all they need."

GradSchool,3ddkv8,cookie-scone,2,Wed Jul 15 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"A couple things to point out. First, nearly everybody in Leuven speaks English, so no worries on not knowing Flemish. Second, Belgium has crazy strict laws on work permits, so going there on a student visa will totally exclude you from finding legal employment, even if you were fluent in the local languages.  However, student housing in Belgium can quite cheap (look into ""kots""), although far from luxruious.   Otherwise, if you are looking to get your foot into the EU it's a great place. Just a hop away from the EU capital and in a location that makes visiting all parts of Europe quite easy. Also, the reputation of the university is excellent."

The one bad thing is that nobody really comes in during the spring so you don't get the sense of community that the fall entrance kids get.  I should also say that I had already talked to the professor I wanted to work with and had a spot in his lab waiting for me, which made the process much easier."
GradSchool,3dekfr,_omicron,3,Wed Jul 15 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind I'm not in your field so I might have no idea what I'm talking about.  I'd say your research experience is pretty good.  Sure, there are people who come out of undergrad with 1-2+ successful papers, but that's not the norm.  I've seen people admitted into top 5 programs with zero research experience.  You have a good foundation to work with here.  I think the main thing that will make the difference is a set of solid recommendations from academics.  Getting good recommendations from your former research supervisors will be critical.  As far as what to do in the meantime, the ideal situation would be somehow working in a lab you want to be accepted to.  You're going to need a sizable chunk of luck to pull that off, but it would be the best way.  Go ahead and apply for those lab tech positions.  The worst thing they can say is no.  Barring that, working in industry in something related wouldn't be bad.  Some professors prefer to have students with industry experience.  Emailing professors you're interested in and asking how you can become a better candidate would be appropriate.  Just keep it as short as you can possibly make it.  They may not respond, but it won't hurt you."

Remember, a chem undergrad can do many other things, most people don't even end up in chemistry after doing them. Some go to law, medicine, physics or other sciences. And I'm of the opinion taking extra time to figure that out for ones' self is wholly beneficial and practical in the long run. I know people that rushed into PhDs and hated every minute. So I would say be sure of what you want, take your time, prioritize, then execute your objectives."

GradSchool,3ddq9p,Tertbutyl42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think your GPA would end up being a problem. Most great programs want at least a 3.5 and most decent programs want >3.0. I'd say you'd be fine if you were like 2.92 or something, but you really aren't close to 3.0 at all. I do agree with others that your undergrad research experience could make up for it, but I haven't known any serious undergrad researchers who had 2.68 GPAs. Do you think you'd have good references to back it up? How intense/frequent was your research? Three years is a long time to not have your name at least grouped into one publication for supporting work.  Even if we say your GPA won't matter, there are other problems you'd likely encounter. Why do you think your company would offer to pay for you to retake classes you did poorly in? You already would have the full time position, so going back to correct some mistakes in calculus holds no real benefit. They would have to be aware that you're trying to improve your chances at going to grad school. An employer isn't going to support that decision financially, because you'd be leaving for a PhD program for at least 5 years and you will be forced to quit your job. They'd be paying for your personal professional development with nothing for them to reap in the end. Businesses don't throw around freebies like that. Also, retaking 2 or 3 classes and acing them will have only a minimal effect on your overall weighted GPA. It wouldn't be worth your time either way.  The important thing to consider is, WHY do you want a PhD? You'd be taking a huge pay cut for at least the next 5 years, probably 7-8 when you factor in a post-doc. You'd be missing out on a lot of money and promotions in that time. If I were you, I might look into a local master's program that might allow you to attend part-time. I really don't know if these exist, but if they do, your employer actually might cover that one. And since a master's isn't paid by the university or professor, it's not as risky to admit someone with a poor GPA."

GradSchool,3daxho,kawaiitrash,5,Tue Jul 14 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the program you're applying to. I dropped out of college my first go-round due to not knowing what I'd want to be doing and the dissolution of a relationship. God abysmal grades the last year prior to leaving. Messed around a few years looking for a job (left school right as the economy was tanking) and finally transferred and finished up.  In my letter of intent for my program I addressed it in being uncertain what I wanted to do with my degree. And that after a few years off reassessing I came back with precise determination (or something).  But again it comes down to your program. Mine's relatively small, new and interdisciplinary (as well as a Master's). But I also had letters of rec from people in my field, did spectacular in ugrad research, and scored nicely on the GREs. But yeah, address your past but don't dwell on it. Use your years after coming back to school as evidence that you've grown and are ready for the next step in your education."

GradSchool,3daxho,sulaymanf,2,Wed Jul 15 00:33:03 2015 UTC,"Hi. So I did this. Went to a few schools, dropped out... ten years later lost my job of 10 years... got an associates online and went back to finish bachelors at state school. I got into a VERY good MA program at a top tier school. They didn't ask or seem to care one lick about anything before the last 2 years. My transcript GPA shows my last 2 years 3.96 I love my discipline and am dedicated. I don't think they give a flip about what I did 10 years ago.  To add, a Professor at another school said, when I showed concern over being an older student, that he prefers them for his graduate students. We've already ""failed"" he said and fought back. We know how to take disappointment and don't break down or give up as easily. Seems that describes both of us. Good luck.  I'll also add that on all the MA apps I filled out they asked for my GPA AT EACH SCHOOL... and NEVER a cumulative one. The GPA I give is the one where I got my BA- which is the only transcript they care about and it shows my previous schools anyway (and some of those C's). I said nothing about that time of my life in my personal statement because it didn't apply. In my case my 'growth experience' in my letter was growing up in a creationist household and finally learning about evolution as an adult- learning critical thinking- and valuing science. I avoided anything that hinted at my age because I was scared of ageism. I wouldn't sweat it."
GradSchool,3daxho,Astra_Starr,2,Wed Jul 15 00:44:04 2015 UTC,"This is advice mainly for research based grad programs. Course-based programs are very, very easy to get into; just shell out the money.  Get experience in your field.  You have to remember that professors are just looking for indicators that you can do successful research. GPA and GRE are very weak indicators of success in research. The strongest indicator is successful past research or work. A publication, or at least an interesting project under another professor."

Make sure those schools are doing the specific part of computer science you want to study, and have faculty that mesh with your interests. Ensure that your grades and test scores meet or exceed the school's requirements. Using the remaining university names, start a search to determine the likelihood you'll find employment out of that school, MSc graduation rates, and how well they rank.   ** It is not easy to decide on grad schools.  I began my research about two years before I even began applying, compiling documents, lists, ranking, etc. over the course of 5-6 hours once a week for years.  Once I had those down, I began researching the areas the schools were in, cost of living, etc.  I ended up applying to six schools, and once I got my acceptances, I started bouncing them off each other until I got funding.

I've met a few people who have done post-bacc work, and they have been very successful into getting into whatever school they wanted, including Princeton. Combine post-bacc work with the work you've already done, and I say you have a very good chance of getting into whatever grad school you want. Good luck!"
GradSchool,3dc0le,AutumnSnow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"I've been involved closely with one of the programs, I would say one powerful aspect I've noticed was that these programs are generally great at getting scholars to science conferences. The networking you do there with schools (including fee waivers, graduate programs directly talking to you and getting your information) is monumental for advancing your application.  One thing to keep in mind is that some of the NIH postbacs have application dates specifically after the graduate school applications go in. You can apply to graduate schools, and if you don't get into any you like, just submit a few NIH postbac ones as well."
GradSchool,3dc0le,Hokieploidy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:26:17 2015 UTC,"My friend did one. She had decent research experience prior to it, but her grades were.. not at all great. Her post-bac at the NIH helped a lot because she got a pretty good publication out of it, she got to meet even more people in her research community, and she got a third really strong recommendation letter out of it. Overall, I think it was probably an important factor in helping her get into her current PhD program (don't know enough about her field to understand where it really stands as a grad program, but apparently a top 15 in general?)."

I'm doing my PhD and most of the people I know have upwards of 70-80k in debt and we're in the humanities. It's good to seek out other options obviously (debt is terrifying and super stressful), but I don't think 40k total is all that shocking in case you need to take loans out as a back up plan. Good luck though!"

The TAs at my university have considered unionizing, but nothing ever comes of it.)

If you're already having two professors write you letters, then the third could come from the famous researcher. If only one letter is coming from a professor, then that might seem a little strange.   It strikes me as odd to ask someone who you only met a couple of conferences (but, if you got to know each other well enough could be alright) to write you a letter of recommendation (but I kind of hate networking at conferences, so maybe that's just me). If you do ask him, be sure to include your CV/resume and any other relevant information that will help him to become more familiarized with your work, if you think he doesn't know it well enough. If he is not comfortable with writing you a letter, for the reasons that you mentioned above, then he will probably tell you that, and frankly, it is his responsibility to do so.   Where you are applying is also a factor to consider. Are either of your possible letter writers alumni of any of the places that you're applying? Do you know if they happen to have any personal connections to any of the faculty in the programs to which you're applying? All things to take into consideration."

He even invited me to come study in Toulouse way back when. I just don't really want to enter into the French education system as a student. I suppose he'll tell me if he doesn't want to write it, you're right.   My choice is school is based on geography more than anything, it's a good program but not the world's greatest. That's fine, I lost my father four years ago and don't want to go far from my mom. I'm okay if I don't get a job. . . I've been thinking about this thing for 15 years now and want to finish it."

So I'd try him first, and in the unlikely scenario that you don't hear back from him or he lets you know know that he doesn't think he's the best person to write you a letter, then go with the second reader. Names do go a long way in academia, and it kind of seems like all the big names know each other...so best of luck!"

If you get in, you'll likely end up meeting more people that will become more relevant to future needs for recommendation letters, so this may be the last one you ask of her, anyway ;)  There are a few old PIs I know that don't mind writing recommendation letters for those who deserve one - they think of it as a way of paying back all of the folks they once asked for a recommendation letter from, and expect you to do the same once you're in the position to write one for someone else.  They spent time to mentor you, and the mentor relationship doesn't necessarily end when you are no longer physically present.  Good luck!"

Cost of living in Vancouver is pretty high (if you thought Toronto was bad...). I know more people from out of province who turned down offers from UBC/SFU than actually accepted them, because they couldn't make the funding work to live without needing roommates or parental support. It is a bit easier if you have a partner who a) has a job and b) that job can relocate them to the coast, but as a single person it is really rough if you want to live alone and close to campus and not in a basement.  Both UBC and SFU produce great PhDs who sometimes even go on to get TT jobs!  But go into this with your eyes open. Take a look at the base funding, then make a rough budget and then check out pad mapper. Be realistic about where you can afford to live and see if that actually matches with your mental picture of what it would be like to live in the lower mainland.

GradSchool,3dar7x,lesbianoralien,2,Tue Jul 14 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"Graduate school is a full-time job and a half. Once you start in a lab, you are going to be very busy, very fast.  I think you need to sit down and have a conversation with your dean or some other leadership at your school. The fact that you have a standing anxiety issue is cause for alarm; the fact fact that it is already causing you issues as you are about to enter the most stressful period of your life raises serious red flags at the moment.  My advice to you is take a year off. Maybe a semester, but I would be really aggressive with this if I were you. Give yourself some time to decompress, collect yourself, and most importantly, seek professional help.

I think you will do much better during your PhD since you know how to pick an advisor and know what you want to do. I say, if you want to, go for it.   If you're worried about publications (I was/am too), can you present a poster at a conference? Sure, it's not the same as a paper, but it's something. I applied to PhD programs before I finished my MS, so my lack of publications (conference oral presentation but no papers) didn't seem to keep me from getting into a program (I got into 1/4 programs I applied to, but I would imagine my mediocre undergrad GPA and unreasonable research goals were issues; that and I applied to a school with a poor research match just for the location). However, I can only speculate on what I perceived to be weak points. Perhaps someone else can give a more definitive answer."
GradSchool,3d9tz6,sweet_stromatolites,2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:13 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live, a master's is either great experience in and of itself, or doesn't hurt you. In Europe, you are required to do a master's before applying for PhD programs, and hardly anyone expects publications at that point, but some students have 1 first author paper, maybe 1-2 non-first-author papers. If you are applying for PhD positions in the US, you will likely have to do the master's portion over again (i.e., you don't get to skip ahead 2 of the 6-7 years just because you have a master's degree). In this case, experience is experience, and it will help you in the interview when people ask what you've done and you haven't just been an RA for a year in undergrad.  I got a mediocre, overpriced master's degree, but I needed it to apply for PhD programs because I live in Europe. I didn't get any publications out of it but I convinced the PhD program committee I was motivated and I came out top of the application pool. I highly enjoyed my PhD time and now I have a postdoc position I absolutely love. If you're passionate about research, keep going!"

I'd suggest you do some research on the websites of departments involved in the kind of research you would like to pursue. They usually have precious information on their admission process, on the kinds of financial aid they can offer, etc. After that, you will probably have plenty of more concrete matters on which people can provide advice. It turns out that what you should know about will vary a lot depending on your field, your departments of interest, and so on."
GradSchool,3d6w2i,andumar,3,Tue Jul 14 02:24:46 2015 UTC,"I'm more concerned about whether or not international students receive funding or teaching positions to help pay for the costs. AS far as finding research that interests me, I'll have to find that on my own."
GradSchool,3d6w2i,andumar,5,Tue Jul 14 03:21:31 2015 UTC,"Right, so that is going to depend heavily on specifics such as field, university and department. But it is certainly possible to be an international student and have your costs covered in one way or another - this is my case. Many of the top universities provide their doctoral students with full tuition fellowships or waivers, as well as a stipend that is quite enough to live on, regardless of where you are from. In general, it seems that international students cost more to universities if they are going to fund you, but they will make sure to secure these funds if they are interested in your work. As soon as you are in a program, you will likely be encouraged to apply for external sources of funding to cover your costs.  Graduate programs usually make it clear on their website if they are able to provide you with some form of financial support or not."
GradSchool,3d6w2i,breovus,2,Tue Jul 14 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that my field is classics and so is bound to differ from your field. Don't go to any grad program on either side of the border if they aren't willing to fund you. I'm in Canada and my funding pretty much pays off my tuition and my TAing helps me keep my head above water. I collaborate with more Americans in my own research, and they all get substantially more funding than any of the Grad students I know in Canada. So.... yea... in my field for graduate school if you're not getting funded, then they are not valuing you enough.   Remember. You're powerfully capable, motivated, and full of untapped potential. A grad program should want you just as much as you want them. Anything less and you're selling yourself short, in my opinion.  Edit: also, good luck! It's really scary at first, and you're gonna feel so overwhelmed and like you're an imposter. Everyone feels that way at some point. Brush that off! You can and will succeed! :) Own it!"

GradSchool,3d6w2i,wurdle,2,Tue Jul 14 03:52:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, my bad, for some reason I assumed you were just finishing your Bachelors and looking into American grad schools for the first time. So many programs in the US just assume you're doing an MA/PhD there, so figured that's what you were alluding to. My bad!  Didn't mean to go all Danny Tanner on your ass, if you're finishing your Masters then you know all too well what I'm talking about already I'm sure! And good luck on the defense!   Concerning your family, what is your situation like in Hamilton in that regard? Would you be giving up close relatives that live nearby? If you've already lived away for a couple years, then are you used to being away enough that you think you could keep going until you're done the PhD?  I can understand your apprehension regardless! I wound up in BC living in a tiny furnished dorm on campus in a city in which I had zero connections/relations. It was really freaking shitty. There was also a significant age gap, so outside of my academic life I was just in a different stage of life than so many of my scholastic peers. So I just didn't fit in. And man, nothing kills free time and a social life harder than Grad school. I slacked off hard the first month and felt like I was paying for it the next two years! Put that all into the mix when you're on your own and tough gets tougher.   But let's get back to you...   I'm more concerned about whether or not international students receive funding or teaching positions to help pay for the costs   So, at first you mentioned your concern was funding.   You understand how...um... ""living conditions"" are for grad students in Canada. And you also know that it's generally rosier on the sunnier side of the border. So I don't know why that's giving you pause. But next you say...   My main concern is that I have no family in the US.   Now all of a sudden your main concern is not having family nearby.   Now ya know how much I can sympathize, I've been there. But there is an end date to the experience and you don't have to live there forever. Hell, a lot of ABD's don't even live in the city of their university anymore. And don't forget the luxuries we take for granted like Skype. We can see and talk to our loved ones daily if time was made for it. So it can be done!  Now, I'm not going to go questioning anything because it's not my business, but I'm getting the impression of natural apprehension here. That or you're not elaborating your concerns directly enough if more concerns only come up in comments ;) Regardless of whether or not you're chomping-at-the-bit-gung-ho about a PhD in America, I think you might get something out of this Quick Speech at a TedX Talk at the University of Waterloo about a few years ago. It's been something I've watched both when feeling really high and really, really low about Graduate School and academia altogether. Luckily, it sounds like you'll have fruitful opportunities outside of the university, so that's another great perk going in your favour!   I definitely think you'd be doing yourself a lot of favours heading south. I collaborate with a boat load of Americans. Honestly, at an academic level there seems to be such similar cultures between the two countries. Plus, it's been my experience that Americans fucking love having a chill Canadian around. It's like we're maple-fucking-leprechauns or something... just drop a farcical ""aboot"" and even southern hens turn into chucklefucks on you. It's weird. But also kinda cool. And let me just say thank god that a lot of American girls seem to have a thing for the professor-type†...   ... I think you said it best. Sometimes you have to go where the opportunities lie!     †okay not a lot but still... definitely go to more conferences though..."

International students should receive funding for any program where domestic students are funded, especially if you're in engineering.  However, you won't be eligible for most fellowships so you might have to TA depending on your professor's source of funding.  For a PhD student, you should be funded.  In my experience, the funding situation is actually much better than in Canada, or at least I'm paid a lot more than my friends who stayed in Canada.  You might have to TA, though, if your advisor isn't as well established.  The situation for Canadian international students studying in the states is easier than other international students, but getting a PhD doesn't guarantee citizenship.  Unlike in Canada, international students are considered non-immigrants and in fact you technically aren't allowed to have the intention to stay in the country (so if they ask say you're going to go back to Canada when you're done).  In practice, though, most people I know are able to get hired by a US company after graduating."

GradSchool,3d6w2i,lepgirl,3,Thu Jul 16 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a Canadian at an American university, although in a rather different field. I am fully funded (I am a TA, which gives me tuition waivers and a salary and I have a fellowship on top of that) and I would say that any program you consider should waive tuition and provide some support.   An important thing to remember: if you are on an F-1 student visa, you will not be able to work anywhere except your university. Any work on the side is illegal, so make sure there is sufficient work on campus. You can also usually stay and work for one year outside your contract.   You mention that you want to naturalize eventually. Are you already in line for citizenship (i.e. do you have an American parent)? In case you aren't here are some tips. DO NOT MENTION THIS TO ANYONE (at least not any government employees). The understanding for an F-1 visa is that you intend to go home, and they will ask questions to verify that. This does not mean that nobody stays (in fact many do), but this has to come later. As a Canadian with a graduate degree, you are in a good position to get a green card, but it is not guaranteed. You may need to find a job first (or get married). Citizenship is a LONG way off."

As long as you're diligent and responsible with your time and your communication, you'll find that you've entered a line of work that is pretty forgiving of mistakes and ignorance, so long as you make an effort to improve and fix things.  Advice for how to stay sane and healthy? Remember that this is a job. You aren't under any real obligation to be there for more than, say, 9-10 hour days, and if you find yourself doing so more often than not, you should look at your time management skills. Similarly, while weekends are probably going to happen, it's important to remember to do stuff for yourself still. Check out local shows or museums or activity groups, and make use of them. Exercise right, eat right, and don't treat grad school like extended undergrad - you are not here to party, you are not here to stave of making real decisions about your future, and you are not in college.  In the mean time, I highly suggest just vacationing and relaxing. You won't get a ton of time off during grad school, so enjoy the interim. Before staring grad school, I quit my job as a lab tech in... May? or so, and spent the summer relaxing and traveling. I went to NZ for 2 months. I started a WoW addiction, did a lot of road tripping, etc."

Prioritize and choose yourself over your work. Seriously, enough is enough. As a rule, don't work more than 40 hours a week and if you work significantly more one week, take time off the next. Take at least one day a week you don't do anything related to your PhD. Take longer breaks every now and then. Set some boundaries and keep to them. Learn to say no."
GradSchool,3d5bp8,Djatha,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"Just recognize that you're going to feel like a fish out of water during your first semester.

It's stressful, but so worth it if you're passionate about what you're doing. I'm in an I/O psych program and I hang out with the clinical psych students often; psych grad school is fun.

GradSchool,3d5bp8,AssDotCom,3,Tue Jul 14 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone else's advice pretty far is sound. One more thing I'd ad: don't go it alone. Rely on your cohort and the people in your grad program for support, and help others out as well. Keep each other accountable with your work, but also help pick each other up when you're down. My program chair said on the first day ""the only people who don't make it through this program are people who alienate themselves from everyone else""."

Long story short, keep records on everything, record conversations, play nice with everyone (this will be hard, most people in grad school are dicks due to the stress), try to be friendly but not friends with everyone (don't over trust...rule of thumb if they won't get blitzed in front of you, or some other super vulnerable event, don't trust them), keep a group of friends out of grad school, work out, meal prep for the week (cheaper, easier and you will love to eat homemade meals), don't start shit and don't take it, get a dog, study hard and always, write 30 minutes every day, read at least one academic paper a day (and really really read it, find its strengths, flaws, and learn from it), attend all department and lab seminars, and truly invest in your program. Make everyone love you and if they don't...who cares. Remember, you don't know who you will need and who you will want on your side.   And when you hit the second week and want to leave, don't. You can and will succeed. The important word in that sentence is you. You have to do the work. You have to invest. You have to keep that passion. And you can. And will."

However, based on what you are saying, you are either truly a freak of nature or are about to learn a very hard lesson in grad school. It is nice they gave you a study guide and hopefully they adhere to it. However, it is my experience that most grad students, even the most brilliant, study around the clock up to a month before the exam. Most students start their preparations 6 months out onward. If you have done that, and truly know the material, relax. If not...um...relax."

I printed conceptual notes for each question I planned to answer, recorded myself reading them, and reread and listened to them over and over for a few hours.  Looking back on my answers, they nearly mimicked the notes I pulled directly from the texts and other course material.  I feel as if I did pretty well on the exam.

Your research experience and connections to professors in the department are now more important; your grades are less important. Forget anything you may believe about the requirements for getting into an Ivy League school as an undergrad; it's just not relevant.  That being said, even though it's not relevant:   See I worry because when I was applying to undergrad, it seemed that Ivys had reqs I couldn't reach, when they asked for a perfect GPA, I had a 3.6, when they wanted a 2400 on their sats, I had just broken a 2000.   That's just not true. Only a fraction (order of 10%) of the undergrads at even the top Ivy League schools have perfect SAT scores and perfect grades."

GradSchool,3d3fw8,OpticaScientiae,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they don't impact acceptance rates but many professors are aware that being the most brilliant student in the classroom doesn't necessarily translate to an ability to do research or come up with novel ideas. They are looking for someone who shows interest in the research they are doing and an ability to look beyond what's written. A professor does not have to be on an admissions committee to have an impact on the committee. Connections do not have to be a hop of 1. Many times it's better to know someone even partially than have perfect grades. That being said, I had about a 3.6 GPA and went to a masters program to bring my grades up to get into a good program."

That is, so long as you are above a certain point (like 3.5 or so for top schools), the best candidates don't necessarily have the best GPA's and the research experience/lab fit is most important. So you need the grades to get looked at, but they're not what get you accepted.   After doing the application cycle and speaking with people on admissions committees, I've found that to be pretty true (at least where I applied)."
GradSchool,3d3fw8,smbtuckma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, it probably works like a threshold.

Blindly attending an Ivy, just because of its status, may not result in the best experience.   What you really should do is read up on the literature, see what current topics grab your interest, and seek out researchers in those areas. For example, the top research in human biomechanics is coming out of Virginia, UNC, Penn, and some others. Going to an Ivy would be fine, but the most exciting research may not be occurring there. If, through your reading, you find a professor you want to work under, and they happen to work at an Ivy, yatzee. But I'm willing to bet that there will be quite a few researchers that catch your eye that are not at an Ivy.   Compile a wish list of professors you would want to work under, and start contacting them to see if they have any room in their lab for a new PhD student. This will give you a chance to feel out the professor not just the school. Who your adviser is will have the largest single impact on your experience in grad school. I've had my own near miss working with a professor who would have made my time in the program miserable. A good adviser will help you through the process, a great adviser will help you reach new heights, a poor adviser can be a time trap and possibly present an insurmountable challenge to graduating.

If you PM me I can give you more specifics (I don't want to slander schools on the internet), but I can tell you the program just won't be as invested in you as an analogous tier 1 non-ivy. The other, non-ivy, top tier schools actually need to maintain their reputation (ivy can just rely on the name) and will thus throw a lot of resources into helping their students.

I would recommend, without me having to write a whole book of advice, just pick the general area you're interested in, and read a few things. As you read, find a few critiques. As you read more similar articles, and you see a ""theme"" in your critiques, you can identify a gap in the literature, and attack it that way. Or, if you're in a quantitative social sciences program: find a dataset that is easy to use (I recommend ELS, or others hosted on EDAT), look at the variables contained therein, and come up with a small research question. A good place to look for datasets is the ICPSR @ UMich. Just put the pen to paper everyday, and write something, let your ideas flow, not necessarily academic.

However, after talking to him about it, I got a new project that wasn't so sucky, and I realized that it wasn't so bad after all. What I actually hated was the classes/bullshit and not the research, which is what the focus of a PhD is anyway.   Not saying that you shouldn't leave, I'm just saying that your adviser is there to help and mentor you, and I'm sure that he/she will have some good insight into your options and help you make the right choice."
GradSchool,3d3npq,Tertbutyl42,0,Tue Jul 14 19:51:45 2015 UTC,"Of course the experience ain't wasted. If for nothing else, you've learned something about yourself that's valuable in your future pursuits. Putting nothing on your resume isn't an option as it introduces a gap potential employers will wonder about what and why. If you have been a ""PhD employee"" instead of a ""PhD student"", you can write off you PhD as ""working as a researcher on Y at university X"" without mentioning the PhD part. I don't know what you mean with ""graduate/limited experience position"", but although you will be less interesting to potential employers than freshly graduates—they probably think you're more expensive, less naive, and over-all ""hard to work with""—, you still have the degree plus three years of working as/on a PhD. There are companies that value research experience. I wouldn't do so unless you are certain you know what you want to do. With respect to Education, don't go that route unless you know from experience that you like to work as a teacher and all it entails. Many new teachers drop out in their first year of teaching, or if they survive that, in the first five years of teaching. Furthermore, in my experience, being a teacher is very challenging the first couple of years, but throughout a teaching career, the responsibilities, challenges, and outlook stays quite constant. Unless you go on into management or support, that's basically it. That's great if teaching is your calling, but otherwise it gets (intellectually) boring and frustrating pretty fast. At least, that's my experience when I taught in high school."

GradSchool,3d3npq,Djatha,2,Mon Jul 13 11:01:02 2015 UTC,"In my country, ""PhD students"" are employees of the university like any other employee, with a reasonably good salary, benefits, responsibilities, and the like. Of course, when you list your PhD as work experience, any potential employer worth its while will ask you if you didn't think about doing a PhD :-)  As I was looking for a job outside academia, depending on the company and function, I sometimes would not mention my PhD but list the project as work experience as a ""researcher"", detailing the practical stuff I did. I found that some interviewers/employers didn't understand or like PhDs for some reason—I always took that as a sign not that the company probably wasn't a good fit—and not mentioning it would get me an interview more easily. On the other hand, the reverse seemed also to be true: some companies prefer graduates with advanced degrees over working experience as a good indicator for culture fit."

I would not work in a lab you are not interested in.  Edit: The reason you should go where the money is is because without a PI, you won't have research. You'd be a year behind in research and while you would have coursework under your belt, any later potential PIs will not be able to judge you based on your research. Students who can't get research done don't graduate at a timely rate. Unfortunately, what with grants being like this nowadays, it might never work out for you.

If you spend the first year trying to find someone, you then have to add that time to the end, where you won't be paid, but will still be expected to pay tuition with no stipend, no salary and no TA/RA opportunities. While you should be nailing down your project, you're busy having coffee meetings, and trying to sort out who will be responsible for making sure you finish on time. Also, without a PI to fight for you and to provide you with support/guidance, you're basically a ship with no engine, no rudder and no paddles. You'll be left adrift and to fend for yourself, because most departments don't care about you once you're in.  I'm not trying to be negative.

Second, talked about him as a model for how I wanted to progress in my career using his teaching instruction as examples. Third, I tied it together with the college's mission statement and how he fits in with the mission of the college.   Much like a cover letter, I kept it at around a page.

And I don't know the truth of it, but he often brags about not having to take part in taking care of the baby. And he comes to campus (no, not the office) to escape the family. So.. yeah, sure is going against the grain and actively helping women scholars with kids by supporting a male ""scholar"" with a baby who's not doing scholarly work. About the same level of support for feminism like funding a female murderer because she's going against the grain. Good thinking!"
GradSchool,3d5cpp,coffee__,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:38:19 2015 UTC,It sounds like this guy is an asshole. I stand by what I said though. You shouldn't have to give up your life to get a PhD.

Having two advisers can be great if it works out, and a nightmare if it doesn't. Just like having an adviser. But it doesn't sound like that's really all that's going on.  If you're leaving grad school entirely (for a 'summer internship'?), this is all kind of a moot point. If you've got publications to your name, and want to continue in research in some capacity, you can probably convince people to listen to you long enough to be considered as a candidate."

GradSchool,3cz8ir,pretendtofly,5,Sun Jul 12 03:12:26 2015 UTC,"I completely understand how you feel. I spent the last two weeks writing every single day to finish my thesis in order to meet the deadline, and even after sending it to my committee, I just felt frustrated. The whole process reinforced my feelings of inadequacy from the last two years. I just don't have the mind of a research scientist. I actually started the program as a stepping stone for something else and realized halfway through that I absolutely hated it and it wouldn't help me in the future. I decided to finish because I had already put in the work. Needless to say, it wasn't the best decision for me.   That being said, I hope that you did pursue your M.S. because you are passionate about it. I found it extremely difficult to motivate myself because I hated my program and just didn't care. You really have to be sure this is something you enjoy before heading down the PhD track. Self-doubt is normal, especially in a period of stress. You made it this far, which proves you are definitely capable of earning a PhD. You just need to be sure that this is something you enjoy.  As for your anxiety...I'm not sure if you suffer from regular anxiety and need medication or therapy or if it's just because everything at the moment is very stressful and overwhelming. If it's the latter, here's my advice to you. First off, stop thinking about disappointing people. Your main focus right now to is finish your thesis. If it feels overwhelming, set small, attainable goals for each day. When I first started writing, I kept thinking about how much I had to do, and it stressed me out to the point I couldn't even start the thesis. Once I reframed my mindset and made a goal to finish chapter one by the end of the week, it helped a lot. It felt doable and really helped with my focus. And if you feel like you absolutely can't write anymore, it's okay to take a break. I'd usually take a 2-3 hour break for food, mindless internet surfing, a nap, cleaning, a walk, grocery shopping, or whatever. It also helps to change up your location when writing. I usually holed up at home, but when I needed to get out of the house, I'd set up at a coffee shop for a few hours.     Remember, take it day by day, and worry about things as they come. Focus on writing, break it up into daily goals (i.e. 1-2 pages a day), treat yourself with breaks. These next few weeks will suck, but you are not alone in your struggle and once you're done, you'll be extremely proud of yourself and what you are capable of doing. Good luck!"
GradSchool,3cz8ir,bearboat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:56:47 2015 UTC,"Heyyyy....I started my program as a stepping stone for something else as well. I also constantly doubted myself and felt frustrated all throughout the program. I also have a PI who doesn't care until it's time to submit data for a grant (I wish she would have at least done the proper lit revew for the grant before she assigned me a project that was partly a dead end). The complete lack of support from her and sheer frustration during this experience has definitely made me not want to pursue a PhD. I also couldn't start writing my thesis for a long time because I kept getting extremely anxious about how much I had to write. Sooo ya, I just needed to point out some similarities because HEY, IT'S NOT JUST ME.   What did you do your MS in?"
GradSchool,3cz8ir,gingerlovingcat,2,Sun Jul 12 08:27:42 2015 UTC,"My MS is in animal science with vet school in mind. The program itself was described as a way to boost your GPA and gain veterinary experience, but once I started, I realized the program was very research heavy and wasn't going to give me what the admissions was looking for...which was essentially clinical experience and a higher undergrad GPA. I also barely got to work with animals.  I think your PI really makes a difference in your experience, and I really hate mine. I've never felt like a valued team member, even though I've put in a significant amount of grunt work. He told me not to get a job when I started, but I'm the only one in the lab with no stipend, even though he has been getting funding. This has led to resentment on my part and a huge lack of motivation. He is also extremely passive aggressive and unprofessional. Instead of asking me directly about certain issues he had with me, he'd go to my other lab members first and then send a passive aggressive email to the entire group (""I heard from someone that a member in our group did this"") to publicly shame me...and most of the time, he was misinformed. The environment of the entire lab is just very catty, and everyone has a huge superiority complex. If you do things differently, you are weird. They talk mad shit about one particular student for being awkward/weird, and my PI laughs and encourages it... Definitely makes me wonder what they say about me when I'm not around.   So no, it's not just you! Sounds like we both have had negative experiences with our programs, which is unfortunate, but the end is near! I'm so excited to peace the fuck out!"
GradSchool,3cz8ir,bearboat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"ALSO, I saw what you commented below about your PI telling you you wouldn't be able to graduate this summer. This is the EXACT same thing that happened to me! My PI and I have weekly meetings, where we had extensively discussed the timeline for me to graduate this summer. I literally had just talked to him on Friday about the timeline, and on Monday, he comes in, tells me he doesn't think I will be able to graduate in the summer, and that I should just move on since I already got into the design program I had applied for. I initially conceded because I just was tired and knew he had some sort of beef with me but wasn't going to be direct with me. But after talking to my boyfriend and friends, they convinced me to still try for summer graduation. So I went back, told him I didn't know what changed his mind about our previously discussed timeline, and that I'd like to graduate in the summer with a degree I earned. He told me to prove him wrong. Here I am about to defend in a few days :)"
GradSchool,3cz8ir,bearboat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:21:02 2015 UTC,"Vet school...cool! It sounds like you were misled about the program which really sucks. Ugh your PI sounds kind of shitty. Definitely very unprofessional. I'm sorry you had to deal with him and a catty drama-filled lab on top of it.  I've been lucky that for the most part, my PI hasn't been passive aggressive or unprofessional. Once when my cells kept dying for no reason and I was troubleshooting, trying to figure out why, she made a nasty comment that she needs grad students who actually want to do research and work hard (I guess she didn't believe me? It turned out to be the media). Another time I was having a lot of trouble getting useable qRT-PCR data when she told me she was very disappointed in me because I wasn't going to present at a conference after I told her I didn't have enough data. I ended up doing a LOT of qRT-PCR troubleshooting. She was pretty unsupportive throughout this time and kept discouraging me from troubleshooting. Finally one day, she actually said ""We don't want to reinvent the wheel"" in regards to troubleshooting. I ignored what she said and spoke to one of my committee members who figured out that the primers we were using in lab were about 10x too concentrated. I also found out we were using the wrong protocol. All of this misinformation had been passed down from student to student throughout the last 5-6 years. When I explained all of this to my PI, her reaction was ""....Oh. You weren't using so-and-so's thesis for the protocol?"" No, I was using the protocol marked qRT-PCR protcol which I was trained to use by the last grad student, who was trained by the grad student before her.   The biggest issue with my advisor is that she is not invested in the lab. She's content to teach one course a year, renew a grant every year or so, publish a paper every few years and pursue her hobbies. When I started in the lab, I was the only active grad student with a lab full of undergrads. I asked her if it would be ok to schedule lab meetings bc I had effectively become lab mom. I was picking up after everyone else, ordering and stocking all supplies, training everyone, I was doing it all. When I said I could email everyone, she insisted she would schedule it. She never did so I talked to her about it again and again, she insisted she'd take care of it. We have NEVER had a lab meeting. It's ridiculous. So I've basically stayed lab mom through the last 2.5 years and take care of everything. I have a lot of responsibilities in the lab and through it all I can honestly say I'm dependable, I do my job well, and I've gone above and beyond time and time again, including go so far as to optimize our protocols. After putting in all the work and research to optimize our protocols, she wouldn't let me actually change our protocols in lab. Taking all of this into account, during one of our last meetings when we were talking about some info I found in the lit review I did, she actually said to me ""You didn't show enough initiative. Most grad students are like that though"". I was unable to find any lit on the novel gene in my project pertaining to the cell type I'm studying it in except for one source that specifically says this gene is not expressed in my cell type. Since she had written a grant and gotten funding for this project, meaning she did lit review, and she assigned it to me, I figured she had done her homework. Apparently she hadn't and it sucks that I took her word for everything but I guess this was a good lesson for me as well.  Holy moly that was a hell of a rant.....I'm sorry about that lol. I am extremely lucky that my lab mates have mostly been good though and I've made some really good friends through my lab. I'm glad you're so excited to move on. I'm glad you're getting out of that toxic environment and moving on bigger and better things. Are you going to vet school or are you moving onto something else?"

I've had some counseling but they've never suggested medication and I'm kind of nervous to bring it up myself. I'd just like to be better on my own, you know?

GradSchool,3cz8ir,bearboat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"I completely understand the hesitation about taking meds--I was just wondering if you had extreme anxiety in general and that the stress is exacerbating it to the point where my advice wouldn't be very helpful to you without some counseling or medicine.   But seriously, just make a daily goal of writing a page or two, a few sentences, or whatever you think is reasonable, and take breaks. It really helps! Don't let this period of time dissuade you from pursuing a PhD if you love the field. Writing is tough, but you'll get through it!"
GradSchool,3cz8ir,gingerlovingcat,3,Sun Jul 12 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"Hey there buddy.....I was in a similar position as you are now just a little while ago. I finished a complete draft of my thesis just yesterday.   When it came to writing my thesis, just making myself start writing was by far my biggest problem. Just thinking about how much I had to get done was so overwhelming that I couldn't start. One of the biggest things that helped reduce my anxiety enough for me to start writing was to tell myself that I was going to try to write 5 sentences for that day. Just 5 sentences. That doesn't seem like a difficult goal to fulfill, right? It's easy enough where I just need to make myself concentrate long enough to write 5 sentences but as soon as I get a few sentences in, I get in my groove and keep writing. So just give yourself a small initial goal so you can start writing.  In terms of disappointing people, you have to try to understand that your parents, family, and friends are proud of you. You're doing a Master's program and writing your thesis. It's not an easy thing to do, otherwise everyone and their grandma would be doing one. Forget about disappointing them, you're ahead of the curve already. Now, your advisor may not be proud of you per se because of a need to maintain a professional relationship. However, your advisor has done this before themselves AND is probably not a first-time advisor so they probably understand the anxiety and stress involved so don't worry about disappointing them because unless you totally half-ass your thesis, they won't be disappointed. If you're really worried, try talking to your PI. My PI hasn't been very supportive or invested in my (and the rest of the lab's) research and maybe yours won't be either. If that's the case, you just have to remind yourself that you're almost at the finish line and all you need to do is finish writing because your ultimate goal right now is to complete your Master's.   If you're questioning whether you want to continue with a PhD program, you can try talking to your advisor. If you don't feel like they will be helpful or supportive, you can try to talk to your future advisor (assuming you already know which lab you'll be in). You can also try to figure out if you can defer enrollment for a year (I have no idea if this can be done for PhD programs) so you can have a chance to chill and do some soul searching without being under pressure from your Master's program.  I was freaking the fuck out a few weeks ago and actually posted on here asking for help and now I'm dishing out advice. I had no idea this day would come. Hindsight is 20/20 man.  Hoping you all the best!"
GradSchool,3cz8ir,gingerlovingcat,2,Sun Jul 12 08:17:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the support. Unfortunately I think my advisor is part of the problem that is making me question things, so I don't really think I can ask him for advice. I kind of like the idea of deferring, but I think it would probably be too late to do that, plus I am kind of excited about starting new, so maybe it will be okay?"
GradSchool,3cz8ir,Bentonkb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  I'm sorry about your advisor. I definitely know how much harder that makes things. Can you talk to another faculty member or grad student whose opinion you can trust? I would advise you to really do some soul searching so you can be sure you want to continue onto your PhD before you do so. I would get more info on deferring at your new school just so that you can make a more informed decision and not rush into things simply because you're under pressure.   Whatever you decide, remember that your goal is to simply finish your Master's program so that you can move onto the next part of your life and not have this looming in the back of your mind. After I was a few weeks into writing my thesis, I discussed timelines with my advisor and seemed to get a fairly positive reaction from her. Literally two days later she randomly came to lab while I was writing my thesis and told me she didn't see me finishing by the end of this summer and should count on finishing the end of next year (I'm starting a rigorous one year CLS program in August so even if I worked on my thesis while in the program, I wouldn't be able to graduate from my Master's program until after finishing the CLS program. This is because I would effectively have to drop-out of my Master's program to start the CLS program because the way things are set up, I can't be a student at both programs at the same time). Needless to say, this was the last thing I needed to hear. It made my anxiety shoot through the roof and had me feeling like there's no point in working my ass off now if she's bluntly telling me I'm not going to finish. Thankfully, my friend and former grad student in our lab convinced me to prove her wrong. I slowly started writing again and now she's commenting on her edits that I did a pretty good job and on top of that, we're coordinating a date for me to defend my thesis at the end of this month.   So my final piece of advice for you is this: Be strong and keep going, even if you're encountering negativity. I dealt with my advisor, my parents almost divorcing, and near relapse of depression while I was writing and made it through the other side with hard work and determination. I'm not trying to minimize your problems at all but if I was able to do this under these conditions, I believe you can too.   Good luck and keep in touch! I want to know when you're going to do your defense! =)"

It is not a pleasant process, but you have to power through or all of your work goes to waste.  One thing that worked for me is making an outline of the whole document then just typing up anything I could think up to put something (anything) in the blank sections. No references, no formatting, no editing, just typing. When that was done my attitude changed and the rest seemed like just an editing session. In truth, much of what I had written didn't get used, but it served as a set of notes for the final text.  Another thing that helped was doing creative work, like starting a new section, in the morning when I was fresh. In the afternoon I couldn't think straight, but I could still do grunt work, like formatting zillions of references."

Have a room set aside, if at all possible, and treat it like an office.   Split the days into morning and afternoon - again, be as rigorous as possible. Timetable it, just broadly - by subject or task, whatever. If the day at school knocks out a whole day, that leaves 8 sessions a week - one solid session for each subject, and three floaters for assignments.  Which you should start way sooner than you think. That due date is a trap - the only way to really work it is to pick the three most urgent (trade off due dates/length/complexity) and there's your three floating sessions - starting tomorrow. The best time for starting a paper, if you actually have everything you need, is ""last week"", but tomorrow will do.   Other than that, just a good calendar, or even spreadsheet. All your deliverables, all their dependencies, all the dates. It's a bit anal, and frankly hugely boring. But it keeps you on top of things."

Well, no, that's actually just what conference speakers are hoping will happen: that interested people from the audience will come up and ask them questions.  Anyway, one thing you could try is meeting up with some of the more senior grad students - as opposed to well-established researchers - at the conference. They'll probably appreciate having someone more on their level to talk to."
GradSchool,3cv6mm,diazona,13,Sat Jul 11 06:56:45 2015 UTC,You're basically right that you're not going to have a lot to talk about given that you just started graduate school. In your position I would say that networking shouldn't be your main focus at this conference. I would focus your efforts on learning new ideas and figuring out how you might apply them to your own research. Networking would be more important if you were a senior graduate student and look for PhD/Post Doc opportunities. In this case it would also be more natural because as a senior you will have accumulated much more knowledge than you currently have.
GradSchool,3cv6mm,basil_fresh,4,Sat Jul 11 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"I am very happy when people come up to me just to discuss my work. So, I think you do have something to bring to the table. Ask questions, seek clarification on anything that confused you during the presentation. Remember, at one point, the other person was in your shoes once, and now they DO have something to offer. But, maybe you work/are interested in a very niche field, even if you have no pubs to speak of - people DO want to talk to you too!"
GradSchool,3cv6mm,tah_infity_n_beyarnd,2,Sat Jul 11 05:08:22 2015 UTC,Just try to ask questions and show your interest. Even if you come off as naiive the presenter will enjoy the attention.

Work on an elevator pitch. Even if you're early stage, you can still talk about your intended area of study, background, etc.   I also suggest you make use of the poster sessions, assuming your conference has some. These are literally set up with the expectation that you, the attendee, go up to presenters and ask them for a summary for their research. Most will gladly welcome the opportunity to share their work (plus, it gets pretty boring standing next to a poster). If there is a particular person you wanted to meet, look them up in the agenda beforehand and do some prep work before you talk.  Don't forget to bring business cards!"

In my experience, many researchers can get so caught up in their own niche that a simple question from outside their niche or field can spur a completely new or different thought process, and in some cases, can even help solve a problem.  Questions from ""outsiders"" help others think outside the box, which is rarely a bad thing in any scientific field.  I gave my first poster presentation last year and was terrified.  I thought I wouldn't be able to answer a single question, but not only was able to answer every single one, my poster got so much attention that I had to stay an hour and a half past the scheduled poster session.  My point is - give yourself more credit than you are.  Ask questions - that's what the posters are for, and learn all you can!  I've always heard that questions are a form of compliment in science.  And like /u/ElectricCurrent said, if you find someone's poster interesting, tell them - even if you don't have any questions.  If I get a compliment on my work it gives me a boost of confidence and lets me know that others see my work in a more positive rather than negative light.    Put yourself out there and have fun! :)"
GradSchool,3cvse0,PhatAmy04,10,Sat Jul 11 04:45:19 2015 UTC,"Prioritize and identify the things that matter less, and be okay with doing just enough for those things. It may take some time to figure out what those things are, and sometimes it may also take some time to figure out what is just enough. Since you're just starting, be prepared to take a while to get the hang of things.  Exercise is totally doable if your department is close to the school gym. I know some people who go off to swim every day for an hour just before lunch. Others prefer to work out at the end of the day, so when they finish and go home they're ready to go to sleep. Another way to get your exercise in is to walk or bike to/from campus.  Yes. Take at least 1 day off a week, and make sure whatever you do that day that it isn't on or around campus. You may not feel this need right off the bat, but you'll appreciate it down the road when you've experienced what it's like to be overwhelmed 24/7. The day off is a plus if it involves people outside of school at least some of the time (that's my personal preference, some of my colleagues seem to enjoy each other's company both in and out of school and even on facebook almost 24/7 (no thanks!))."
GradSchool,3cvse0,gradonetwo,6,Sat Jul 11 06:48:03 2015 UTC,I work my ass off at all my responsibilities.  But I exercise 4-6 times a week and take as much time off as I need to maintain my mental and emotional health (usually 1-2 days a week).  It's really the non-work that makes the work possible for me.  But that's just me.  Oh and getting away from campus is huge boost for me.  I love to go camping/backpacking and just get-away-from-it-all.
GradSchool,3cvse0,mguggis,2,Sat Jul 11 07:21:25 2015 UTC,"Getting away from campus is great advice - I will be living on campus first semester (as I am an international student) so I will try hard not to spend 100 percent of my time on campus! Also, I am glad you guys find time to exercise - the campus gym is a 10-15min walk from my building so I thought maybe I could go there during lunch as I find it re-energizes me for the afternoon.  I guess if I work hard during my actual work time and don't procrastinate I can get at least one day off a week - my current professor told me that students often overestimate how much time they spend actually studying and the 10 hours they say they study for each class is probably an overestimation."
GradSchool,3cvse0,patesta,6,Sat Jul 11 09:06:16 2015 UTC,"I heard the 60-70 hours per week thing too before I started, but after I did (and a friend of mine tracked it), we honestly rarely exceeded 50 hours a week (usually around 40). We fell into a natural swing of things and made time for free time and leisurely activity. And honestly, you have to if you want to maintain an optimal energy level throughout the first year. Best of luck.  Edit: and a good chunk of my cohort maintained pretty physically active lifestyles. You just have to pick your hobbies."

GradSchool,3cvse0,MidnightMarauderz,4,Sat Jul 11 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"7-10 hours a week for each class? That's crazy.  You'll take several classes that aren't interesting/relevant to your research — You'll quickly figure out how to do as little work as possible in order to get A's in those classes.   I think the biggest thing for me was learning how to start working immediately in the gaps I have. For example, I might get out of class at 1300 and but have a meeting at 1500... I had to learn to just sit down and bang out as much as possible in those two hours. In your first few years when taking classes, you often don't have the luxury of having a huge 5hr block in the daytime to just sit down and read/write.   Also, the ""one day a week without school"" is personal preference. I probably work ~40hrs a week, but I spread it out. I usually work for ~3hrs hours on Saturday and a couple more on Sunday. This leaves me plenty of time during the week to watch sports, cook (a hobby of mine), go to the gym, and play basketball."

Also, for me, here is my sample schedule, to avoid burnout, and have time for ""real life."" It's not ideal, but it works for me.    4:00 AM - 5:00 AM - Wake-up, eat breakfast, morning chores and walking the dog for morning exercise 5:00 AM - 6:00 AM - Catch-up on news, take time to meditate about my day, review my to-do list, head to office 7:00 AM  - 11:00 AM - Reading time 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM - Class #1 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM - Lunch, take a walk 1:30 PM - 4:30 PM - Writing time 4:30 PM - 7:30 PM - Class #2 7:30 PM - 8:30 PM - Go home, make dinner, walk dog 8:30 PM - 11:30 PM - Compile notes, do assignments, write schedule for following day  Of course this changes as my class schedule changes. Basically, make 8 hours a day available for scholastic items, and do this Monday to Friday. I save my light reading for weekends, so I can work, but it seems ""fun."" I do my schedule on Saturdays too. Sundays I do nothing school related, except make sure tasks are ready to turn in. I do my personal stuff on Sundays like making a big breakfast, running errands, paying bills, playing with my dog, gardening or some fun hobby, longer meditation, I call my mom every Sunday and my grandma, and cleaning/laundry. At certain times per year, Sunday gets heavy because of holidays/travel/other personal obligations. But, to stay sane, I do a little something every day ""hobby-ish"" that is fun and pleasing to me, to get my mind off school ""stuff."" But, prioritize your goals, be flexible, and have a plan for the inevitable procrastination period. And most importantly... DON'T CHECK EMAILS ON THE WEEKEND, unless they are pressing and life changing. I alert all my colleagues, profs, and students that I only check mail during office hours 9-5 M-F. Absolutely never another time. I do not accommodate student emergencies ""Oh I had no idea there was an assignment due even though you reminded us 10 times and put it on the syllabus"" that seem to arise via email, at 3:30 AM. Also, master the art of multi-tasking. Like, when you walk to class, also read a book. When you poo, when you shower, also read a book. While studying, take notes and write it up as a lesson plan as if you had to teach others, so that way your course prep gets done without you having to say ""oh darn I need to write this course before fall term, and I have 3 weeks. Dang!"""

My PI was never involved in the day-to-day nuances of my project as he typically spends most of his time in his office. Also the focus of my project is in an area outside of his expertise, so I had to explain things to him fairly often. I recently submitted my thesis to him, and he returned it to me with comments asking why I was talking about x,y,z in my thesis...although we had previously talked about it extensively before during several meetings. I sent him a panicked email, thinking that I'd have to rewrite the whole thing if I had misunderstood. Turns out he got confused and that I was right. Point is, your PI/advisors don't know everything, even if they'd like to think they do. You just have to build a case for the analysis you are doing with more rationale/background and support it with results. Sucks they're condescending, but don't feel bad about it.

GradSchool,3csg84,jdk519,2,Fri Jul 10 12:06:17 2015 UTC,"I took this same path. Undergraduate degree is BSEE, then went to MIT for the SDM graduate certificate. I am now doing a weekend MBA program. I think the fact that the certificate is from MIT gets me more brand awareness and a second look more than the certificate itself. Like all things, I find the skills I gained during the program more valuable than the certificate I am holding. If you think the program will provide you with specific skills that you can apply to help you contribute more value at work, go for it. One secondary benefit of the certificate program was it served as something of a ""tune up"" program to get me back into the academic mindset and helped me work out kinks in managing my professional and academic workload. YMMV."
GradSchool,3csg84,bambari,2,Fri Jul 10 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"Another comment: your unique situation may change your view, but I would never enroll in an MBA program that takes 4-5 years. That is entirely too drawn out in my opinion. My program is 2 years beginning to end, and I much prefer that structure. I will be graduating before people who started a different program 2 years before me, and they are envious to say the least. Something to consider as you look at prospective programs."
GradSchool,3csg84,bambari,2,Fri Jul 10 13:17:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I'm estimating 4-5 years for MBA since I would still be working full time and the programs I am looking at are around 50 credits. My job is in DC, so I'm looking at University of Maryland for a grad certificate in ME. Did you take the sdm program online? I'm also looking at Stanford's management sciences and engineering certificate and obviously would have to complete that online, but am concerned the online stigma will deplete the prestige of that."
GradSchool,3csg84,bambari,2,Fri Jul 10 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"I did complete SDM from a distance, plus two residence weeks in Cambridge. This format was fine for a grad certificate, but I couldn't do it for a Masters. I have discussed the program with multiple prospective employers and no one devalued the experience due to the distance format.  My MBA program (Ross) is 60 credits in two years and I am working full-time in an engineering management role. It is stressful and busy, but doable. You just need to decide what you value and what works best for your personal situation. I will say this: if you are serious about a career as an executive manager, how many execs do you know you did their MBA in night school over 4-5 years? Not many. You give up a lot of post-MBA career years. Obviously I am biased, but I see the business schools promoting Weekend programs over Evening programs as their dominate Part-Time offering."

They sponsored me to attend the program and disseminate the knowledge throughout our business.   SDM Masters would certainly have a lot of overlap with MBA. The only business class we did in the grad cert was Technology Strategy (diffusion of innovations type of class), so very different from what I am doing in MBA now.  SDM and MBA are both a lot of work. I probably average 20 hours of coursework per week, up to 40 hours some weeks. This is on top of 40+ hrs per week in day job.

GradSchool,3cuorh,ethicaldilemna,2,Sat Jul 11 01:55:38 2015 UTC,Sounds like you have an excellent chance! It also can't hurt that one of the professors in the Penn history department started her career at Vanderbilt (I took a seminar with her while I was in undergrad at Vandy).

GradSchool,3cuorh,aliud_quelquechose,2,Sat Jul 11 02:46:14 2015 UTC,"IMO you're focusing too much on things that don't matter much (because you're already well set). Vanderbilt, undergraduate fellowships, LoC research experience, good numbers. That's all good, and won't keep you out, but you won't get in on those alone.   You need to focus on your writing sample, letters of recommendation, and statement of purpose. I don't know about History as a discipline, but I would imagine you should probably be looking at the top range. Vanderbilt surely has strong faculty members. They are your best guide to understanding the disciplinary landscape today. What are the leading programs? The ones placing consistently to good tenure-track positions? Or to museum/archive positions? And so on. Talk to faculty. And make sure you develop an absolutely excellent writing sample and statement of purpose by fall."

GradSchool,3cuorh,Gradschoolkool,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:35:06 2015 UTC,"Thos statistics make you competitive but what field are you applying to work with and does Penn have the right person to advise you in that field. That is the deciding factor, certainly more than internships (honestly not that important), GPA (which everyone who will be considered should a 3.5 bare minimum). Quality of writing sample is also very important. High grades and test score are meaningless if you are a poor writer. Or worse, deluded into thinking you are a good writer by enabling high school, undergraduate teachers."

GradSchool,3cuorh,Unturned1,3,Sat Jul 11 04:21:10 2015 UTC,Would be pretty unlikely to have a published article in History at this stage. It's not STEM where publishing is dime a dozen.
GradSchool,3cuorh,PhDforaDay,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:59:34 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to be an article in a full-fledged academic journal. Even an article in one of the many student publications out there will help make him stand out. Presentations at student conferences will also go a long way.
GradSchool,3cuorh,Timmyc62,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:33:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about this area of study, so how are research and advances in the field disseminated if not in peer-reviewed publications?"
GradSchool,3cuorh,thielemodululz,2,Sun Jul 12 09:57:23 2015 UTC,"at this stage.   Unlike STEM where it's possible to tag on as co-author #45 or something, most articles in the humanities are single-author. They also take far more time to develop because they don't look at discrete ""problems"" that can be resolved by experiments one way or another. Therefore, it is generally very unlikely that an undergraduate understands the field adequately, or has developed the chops, so to speak, to publish an article in a standard journal of the field. As someone else noted, however, it may be more likely in an undergraduate-only journal (which of course wouldn't be as highly regarded as a publication in a leading journal)."
GradSchool,3cuorh,PhDforaDay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:06:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, so, dissemination of results is by basically the same mechanism, but the process of how it comes about is totally different. Why not multi-author papers, though? Wouldn't things advance much faster in collaborations? In STEM the people involved in the study meet, brainstorm, plan, share ideas and ultimately attack the problem as a team. People shouldn't be added to papers for no reason (although it does happen). The average number of authors on my papers is between four and five, but in one instance I am on a paper with like 30, but nobody considers those types of publications as legitimate."
GradSchool,3cuorh,thielemodululz,3,Sun Jul 12 10:14:43 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally different ideologies of research and of systems of knowledge. Fundamentally different questions being asked, and fundamentally different approaches to formulating questions.  There isn't much to be gained from collaboration in my field (history of art) except in rare instances, simply because so much of research in the humanities depends on the way one writes. Some of the thinkers and theorists I adore, for instance, have done their best work not just in the terms of their argument or their archival work, but in the performance of their writing itself. This would make more sense if you are familiar with the work of Derrida, Stanley Cavell, Akira Lippit, or Homi Bhabha. Writing is itself an intrinsic part of humanistic scholarship in a way unthinkable in STEM.   It does not lend itself well to collaboration. That's my own take on it; others may understand it differently. But as a graduate student, I can say that when I take up a book or article or even the general corpus of a particular scholar, I take it up with a view toward finding a way into their mind, to trace the unfolding of their thought. Can you imagine Hegel writing Phenomenology of Spirit as a collaborative enterprise? Or Lessing's writing on the Laocoon as a group endeavor? It's just absurd.   I don't often need to read papers in STEM, but on the few occasions I have, the entire format, structure, and execution--they have been massively dull. It's all rather utilitarian with no care or indeed necessity for the unfolding of thought. Rather they tend to simply chart steps from A to B with a view toward conclusion C. I'm of the view that conclusions are less interesting than the progression, which is why I value the performance of writing in humanistic work so much."
GradSchool,3ctkft,needsomeedjumcation,3,Fri Jul 10 17:42:21 2015 UTC,"If you don't have much research experience (it doesn't sound like you do), then you probably can't get into any phd programs. Masters programs are less common, and generally aren't funded. It is possible to apply for TA or RA positions as a masters student, but your chances of actually getting consistent funding are somewhat low, so if you go the masters route be prepared to take out loans. Phd programs are normally funded, and provide a living stipend. If you really want to go that route, start applying for lab technician positions at every university in Washington. After a year or two of teching, your chances of getting into a phd program will be much higher. Working for a biotech company would also be a good way of getting experience before applying. I know you say you can't get a job, but there are tons of jobs in the Seattle area, so you should be able to find something.

GradSchool,3ctkft,boston_butt_roast,2,Fri Jul 10 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to have substantial research experience, and no where do you really indicate what sort of career you'd be specifically pursuing with a MS/PhD. By my understanding, your rationale is that a higher degree will increase your chances at actually getting a lab job. If this is accurate, I would strongly advise against grad school. Had you done a lot of lab work and expressed an explicit desire to be the head of exciting research projects, I'd absolutely encourage you to go for a PhD.   It's a very slippery slope that you're already in the midst of heading down. Think about it. Why'd you go to college? To get a degree that helps land you a better job. You didn't head into a narrow major like accounting or engineering, where everything you study is focused on one specified career. You went into chemistry, which is relatively poorly defined in terms of what you're ""training"" to become. You didn't do any significant research as an undergrad, so it appears that you didn't head into your major fully committed to a career in the lab. You just hoped that the degree would be ""enough"" and would get you in the door somewhere (which I totally get).  Well, now you're in debt for a degree that didn't get you a job as you'd thought. Time to double down and take it one step further. They'll definitely take you seriously with a MS, right? Maybe. Or maybe you'll just climb further into debt and still struggle to find a job. It's competitive and there are no guarantees.   What about a PhD? Those programs are funded so at least you won't have to worry about loans as you would with a MS. Anyone would hire a PhD, right? Again, no guarantees. I have a PhD and have been unemployed for all of 2015. I'm not saying I regret my decision to get a PhD, but it would be a hard sell if I'd have known then what I know now.   After your PhD, you're pretty much expected to go into a postdoc. It is extremely rare for an industrial lab to hire a new PhD in an entry level position, and just as unlikely to find something full-time with a university. I lost my excitement for research toward the end of my PhD. It's essential to be passionate about research as a PhD/postdoc, because the pay is horrendous and the hours just as unreasonable. I saw what would be expected of me as a postdoc and decided I was done with all of it. I'd rather struggle now than waste a few more years hating life and making no money.  But check this: even with a postdoc, the market is still competitive. Unless your professor is a big shot, your school is ivy league, or you know the right person, there still aren't any guarantees. I know a number of people who encountered problems finding employment after a postdoc and had to find a second postdoc. I decided that I'd rather not take the risk of being in my mid-30s and still without a 401k. Just keep in mind: even with more letters after your name, you could still be facing down these same problems in 10 more years."
GradSchool,3ctkft,dweed4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for the most part but I do feel your reply is a bit cynical. I'll try and address something here--I didn't decide to be a chemist for money or prestige or anything like that. I don't want to be the next Bill Nye. Chemistry just makes sense to me, and I love doing it. I love working in a lab environment, I love doing synthesis, and I love working as a TA and helping students learn the science behind what they're doing. I'd love to teach I think, being a college professor sounds like something I could see myself doing down the road. It's true I don't know what I want to do specifically, but I know I love organic and inorganic chemistry. I love mechanisms and other things I know a lot of people find boring or tedious. I was hoping becoming a lab tech would open the door to me finding what I love; working in a certain lab setting might help me realize what kind of scientist I truly want to be while making money. That...didn't exactly work out. I just hoped education would open the door to discovering what I want, and so far it hasn't, so I figured maybe I'd go back and learn all that I can for now. Thanks for your input, though, and sorry to hear you're struggling as well."

In all actuality, if you graduated from there, they already know just about everything there is to know about you.  To boot, I'd inquire as to whether a formal hiring process would take place.  It's likely that it would.  Every place I know of that is hiring - universities included - are more or less mandated to post the position and conduct interviews at a minimum.

I'm surprised your department head sent out a query for fall so early in the summer, but they probably got sidetracked with convocation/summer teaching evals, etc. They probably also had to wait until fall registration opened to get a rough idea of how many intro sections they would be able to run.  The informal stuff is also normal too. Adjuncting is often a word of mouth thing (IME, it could be more formal elsewhere). I assume that you a) showed up for all your classes you were scheduled to teach and b) don't have horrible teaching evaluations.  At the school I work for once you teach your first course successfully and the students seem to like you, they try to keep offering you courses whenever they  have something that fits your skill set.  Also, you actually found out about fall teaching quite early. Some schools won't start slotting in adjuncts until a week or two before fall classes start."

Labs are more or less babysitting to make sure no one does anything stupid. Familiarizing yourself with the experiments a day or two beforehand is the only prep you'll need for a lab.  If it's a recitation you'll be doing, then I would highly recommend attending the lecture with the students. This may or may not be possible depending on your schedule with your own classes/obligations. It's much easier to re-familiarize yourself with the material in an hour class than flying blind before a recitation, unsure of how far into the material the professor has covered. I found it helpful to see how the professor taught some difficult concept to the students because I could then either build off of it or offer the students a better/easier explanation if I felt there was one. Also, the students frequently ask questions pertaining to quizzes/exams/dates/assignments that I otherwise would not have known had I not been in the class."

Your GPA isn't bad.  Considering the bar for non-Ivy League undergraduate graduation is a mean of 2.0, 3.38 is a bit of an achievement really. Chemistry grades aren't likely to affect an OT graduate school application. I also had a lower GPA my first two years.  It climbed from 3.2 to 3.62 in my last two years in which I took classes relevant to my graduate program. B's aren't as bad as you think.  That's still above average! If volunteering isn't mandatory and you are doing it anyway, that will score you some points. To make your application stand out, explain why you want to be an OT.  Avoid how convenient it would be and instead highlight how you want to help people and so on and whatnot.  Highlight your academic successes thus far and be confident throughout the process.

During the day, I try to break my time into chunks and accomplish little bits during those periods of focused work. I also drink lots of water so I am forced to get up to pee a lot.

I'm in the process of leaving (not sure when exactly yet), and to make the most of it, I have basically tried to tailor all my courses/projects, etc. so that they allow me to learn and incorporate skills that are useful in the non-academic world (and still actually contributing to my field/department in some way, 'cause otherwise they'd kick me out by now). What gets me is I have all these other duties that are in the grand scheme of things mostly a waste of time for me (other than that they mean I get my stipend), so it's a bit of a constant struggle.

We can't all be research professors and that's what the degree trains people for. You should be commended for expanding your skills beyond research but I think the whole damn system should start incorporating diverse skill sets into the program so they don't leave most of the people who matriculate over-educated in a subject that isn't practical for getting a job anywhere but in academia.
GradSchool,3clp2v,gradonetwo,6,Thu Jul 9 04:55:30 2015 UTC,"Very well said. And what's worse is you're flat out ridiculed if someone catches on to what you're doing. You'll get told things like ""<chuckle> Oh you don't know what it means to have a phd"".   No you ignorant fuck. I get it. I get this whole process. I'm just not doing it that way. Because once you get out of academia, a PhD is just a piece of paper that says you're qualified to do this or that. Industry doesn't give a shit what you publish or if you wrote your dissertation with .75"" margins on all sides except for the left which has a margin of 1"". They want you to do something that makes them money. And unfortunately, academia doesn't seem to know anything about that.   Eh. Sorry.

GradSchool,3clp2v,gradonetwo,3,Thu Jul 9 05:33:51 2015 UTC,"Research is supposed to be about progress of some kind so it shocks me sometimes how backward people can be about PhD education. The end product of the degree could be the research thesis, but the training should be for teaching advanced problem-solving, experimental design, project management, communication, and analysis.  In the end, you would have an army of people who can think deeply through most problems and could apply their abilities in many career fields. Given the choice between someone who has been actively trained in all of those things and someone who did research on their one esoteric topic for 6 years, I would bet that any employer would rather hire the first. Sure that second person is an expert in their project, but how could you be sure that if you asked them tackle something different, they would even be able to?"

We can't all be research professors and that's what the degree trains people for.   Yup, I've said this before. If they're gonna keep accepting way more people than the academic market is ever gonna need, they should modify their programs to allow, if not train, people to work in the non-academic world as well. The biggest obstacle to this is that most professors (save perhaps for the newest generation) don't have any non-academic experience and thus are unable to help even if they want to. Instead, they hire career counselors who come in to give talks, but often they don't even necessarily have the experience of transitioning out of academia themselves and end up giving general advice that you can find online."
GradSchool,3clp2v,GeneticsGuy,2,Thu Jul 9 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to get the ball rolling is to start a seminar series that invites professionals from industry, journalism, sales, business, etc. with PhDs to come and give talks about their transition out of academia and what skills are most useful for their career fields. Catch is that you need funding to start something like that, especially if your university is far away from where most jobs would be. I tried to get some non-academic speakers for a summer career seminar at my university last year but unfortunately we didn't have funding to bring people in from outside and most of the people at my university are, of course, academics."

We do have some of these events here at my university, but they are heavily targeted toward people who are about to finish (and very STEM heavy, naturally). I think they need to advertise it to everybody, including entering students. Some skills just can't be obtained overnight when you are preparing to defend your dissertation, far from it. Way better to start practicing those skills throughout your time in the program. There needs to be more bridges between academia and the outside world and what better way than to have your students (at least some even if not all) actually doing that as part of their program."

Mine wanted both my boyfriend and I to independently make 3x the rent per month, and they wouldn't trust that he would have a job here because his transfer hadn't gone through with his company yet, so we had to get my parents to cosign.   Anyway, I did a similar transition from working for 5 years. I'm only a year in, but things are ok. Money hasn't been too bad - I get a stipend and it's certainly less than I used to make, but I also don't spend much (cook at home, don't go out too often, don't buy clothes or anything often, don't buy coffees/lunches all the time like many other grad students do). I also didn't work a very high paying job before and the new city isn't crazy expensive, so maybe that's why the transition isn't too bad.   I think the hardest part is having less free time with my boyfriend and not having a lot of friends here. We used to have weekends off together and we used to have similar schedules during the week. Now we are sometimes like ships passing in the night because his work hours are all over the place and I often work long hours. The people at my school are friendly and we do social things every couple of weeks, but as a couple, we don't really have friends and nobody comes over. We used to have friends drop by often just to chat and have a few beers, and would host dinner parties a lot, so I miss that (though I don't remember the last time I felt I had the energy to host a party anyway)."

GradSchool,3ck5ma,arieltheginger,14,Wed Jul 8 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"In my area (maths), and I believe this generalizes well, grades from upper-level classes matter far more to admissions committees than grades from lower-level classes. I believe you would be better off raising your GPA via upper-level classes related to your grad school interests. It will look better on your transcript and the knowledge gained will be more valuable to you in grad school. For those reasons, I think that route is far more likely to get you accepted into grad school than raising your GPA with A.A.-level classes."
GradSchool,3ck5ma,gourmetbum,2,Wed Jul 8 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"Since I already graduated, how would I go about taking upper-level classes at a university?

If I paid for going to a school as a non-matriculated student, wouldn't it make more sense to go and get another (albeit, lesser degree), take upper level classes for actual credit and also raise my grades at the same time? I'm not disagreeing with you, I am just wondering what options I have."
GradSchool,3ck5ma,croak_monsieur,5,Wed Jul 8 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"See if a local university offers a non-degree-seeking student option. You would still be taking the classes for credit and a grade, but you wouldn't be formally admitted to the university or a specific degree program. Taking and excelling in some challenging relevant coursework (potentially at the masters level) would be an excellent way to show grad programs that you are serious. Also, don't just get a grade - get a mentor. This is your chance to get a faculty member or two to write a strong letter of recommendation on your behalf. Any reputable grad school will require them and it helps to have them come from another academic who can accurately assess your recent classroom performance.  From there on out, the statement of purpose practically writes itself. ""I had some problems as an undergrad due to A and B. Consequently, my grades suffered. I realized how much I loved this subject, so I began taking classes at University of Whatever. I want to continue my studies here to pursue a career as a ..."" Please see the enclosed letters from Drs. X and Y about how I'm the most driven student they've seen in years."
GradSchool,3ck5ma,apple-jacks,2,Wed Jul 8 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"Hi, not gourmetbum, but jumping in so I can quote your text here and build off of their contributions:    Would I have to do it as a non-matriculated student?    Yes. You would likely contact the department/professor/graduate school, enroll as a non-matriculating student, and attend class, demonstrating your ability to complete graduate-level coursework.  Remember, one reason why GPA is a factor for admissions is to have some indication of your ability to perform in coursework.  But there are differences between undergraduate and graduate coursework, even upper level courses at a community college for your associates.    If I paid for going to a school as a non-matriculated student, wouldn't it make more sense to go and get another (albeit, lesser degree), take upper level classes for actual credit and also raise my grades at the same time?   Before I answer this, I'll let you know that I am such a dork I took classes for fun between undergrad and grad school.  I have credits from a community college on my complete transcript. While I didn't earn a degree, those credits are listed separately as ""post-baccalaureate credits"" on my college record so that perfect 4.0 doesn't count towards my undergraduate total (3.5).  So, your admissions crew would see two GPAs: one for your associates, one for your undergrad degree. It would maybe explain the low undergraduate GPA (which can be explained elsewhere in your admissions materials), but the bigger question  - can you handle graduate level coursework - goes unanswered.   It seems that you are thinking it would be a waste to take credits without earning a degree. I would recommend that you think about non-matriculating classes and what they demonstrate to admissions: They demonstrate your ability to perform in graduate-level coursework and they help you to understand what will be expected of you in graduate level coursework - especially for a program that is coursework-heavy like your MSW.   The ""waste"" is in thinking that all credits must lead towards a degree.  You might want to do some reappraisal and think of non-matriculating courses as pre-requisites to the degree you desire.  Sometimes in life, the payout comes further down the road -  while it doesn't count towards a degree, it gets you to the larger goal you desire.   There are other pros of non-matriculation. If you are able to take classes in social work or a related field, you would have graduate level professors that could speak to your ability to handle graduate level workloads if you develop and maintain those relationships with the professors.  I've had classes with non-matriculating students and while their goals were different (one was ""I'm not sure if grad school is for me"" and the other was ""I'm not sure which focus in the larger discipline fits me"") they were able to really understand what our courses were like in my department.   If you really, truly, absolutely, do not want to waste your time in non-matriculating courses, you could start another master's program and not finish it, but this is suggested only to point out the larger issues.  You would run into the same GPA problem.  You would also have to explain not why you're not finishing the degree if you did get in to the MSW program you desire.  You may also burn bridges because you'd be taking up a spot from someone that wants to be in that other master's program and you did it only as a stepping stone. I suggest that only to help you see that the non-matriculating student suggestion is valid and worth considering. Don't take away from my post that I'm advising you to do this; in fact, if we were friends I would recommend you take non-matriculating courses, despite the cost. It's an investment in you and your desired future which is a better investment than an associate's degree when you already have a bachelor's degree."

But like others have said, there are other things you can do, too.  Contacting the departments you're interested in will be a good start.  Maybe talk to some grad students already in those departments, try to get some feel for the requirements.

Any answer that you receive here will be very general- I'd suggest you contact the programs you are interested in and see how they look at post baccalaureate coursework.  For instance, some Public Health programs will admit you if you do well in your last 60 credit hours.  Other PH programs will look at your junior and senior credit hours (last 60 specifically as they pertain to those years).  Finally, other programs want to see your overall.  So- best to eMail the admissions staff for the programs you might be interested in attending.

Your gen ed requirements should transfer from your first bachelor's, and you can jump right into coursework for your new major.

You can do some low level undergrad classes with just a masters though.  If you find your self lacking motivation and you haven't made much headway on your research, it could easily be more than 3 years before you finally finish. I'm in a similar situation and feel that the combination of topic, advisor, and peers heavily contribute to a lack of interest. So the problem may not be that you don't like research, and instead be that you don't like the specific type of research or research group you are currently working with. If you could join a different program you may find the negative feelings all go away.  You can ask for a leave/sabbatical and go work for a year or two, and worst case scenario then you come back to the PhD and pick up where you left off."

GradSchool,3ckfng,Second_Foundationeer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:42:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was sort of under the impression that a Master's is required at the minimum, but considering how many PhDs are out and about these days that need jobs, a Master's doesn't really make you a competitive applicant."
GradSchool,3ckfng,dyslexda,2,Wed Jul 8 18:31:15 2015 UTC,Yeah.. it kinda sucks because finishing the PhD vs the Master is not a good indication of teaching ability.
GradSchool,3ckfng,SweaterFish,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"Unless you're comfortable with high school, teaching at the university level pretty much requires a PhD for any respect. Those with Masters are usually relegated to adjuncts, or if they're lucky, long term, non-tenured teaching. That said, if you want to do primary/secondary education, a Masters is definitely all you need, and you could do well with it."

They do their best in hiring committees to assess your teaching ability, dedication, collegiality, etc. They're not dumb after all."
GradSchool,3ckfng,Second_Foundationeer,2,Wed Jul 8 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"The people I've talked to at community colleges and undergrad teaching focused colleges that don't require PhDs have always told me that a PhD does not give you a leg up on other applicants.    That's simply not true in many places now, with a few possible exceptions. I've spent my career (20+ years now) in the SLAC world and we don't even consider applicants without Ph.D.s for adjunct positions. The CCs in my state do still advertise with the MS/MA as the minimum qualification, but my colleagues there tell me they haven't hired anyone without a Ph.D. for a TT position in 10+ years, with a few exceptions in programs like English where an MFA is sometimes considered a terminal degree.  Just look at the ads in the Chronicle during hiring season, or follow the jobs wiki for any field of interest-- there are basically no TT positions advertised for MA/MS holders, and it's very rare to see someone with a master's degree make even the first cut in a search pool.  There are exceptions of course, especially for very poorly resourced schools or institutions in places that nobody wants to live/work. But for the most part, a Ph.D. has become the requisite for TT hires across all of academe in recent years."
GradSchool,3ckfng,SweaterFish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"That's good to know! It's probably different everywhere, and depends most on how focused the school is on undergraduate education."

GradSchool,3ckfng,SweaterFish,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, still, what people think they do and thus proclaim are not always what they actually do. I don't have any doubt that your friends are smart and do look for applicants based on strengths, but, supposing they had to choose between the one with a master and the one with a PhD, what reasons would they have for choosing the one with the master? And, assuming this is true for this one local region, I don't think it'd hold out in the general trend when looking more globally."
GradSchool,3ckfng,MattHasslefront,2,Thu Jul 9 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"supposing they had to choose between the one with a master and the one with a PhD, what reasons would they have for choosing the one with the master?    They will hire the Ph.D., because the dean told them to, because having a faculty with higher level degrees is important to marketing. Look at all the schools (i.e. basically all schools) that formally publish a statistic like ""percentage of faculty holding terminal degrees in their field"" as part of their basic admission info."
GradSchool,3ckfng,biochemistree,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"Well, one thing I've gleaned from faculty at these schools is that there's a little extra suspicion about someone coming in with a PhD, that they may not really consider a college like that a position they want to stick with for the long-term. Like it'd just be a ""stepping stone"". Also at many of these schools that I've looked at, PhDs start at a higher pay grade than Masters, so if two candidates were hypothetically perfectly matched, maybe there'd actually be some financial reason to prefer the MS, though it's probably not really significant at least at the departmental level."

Or maybe it just requires more self-discipline than I have, who knows! Time off may be the best thing. Thanks!"
GradSchool,3ckfng,biochemistree,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"The advice I've gotten is to find a lab/professor that already has a topic which needs research and become the go-to guy. Even if you hate it, already having the topic picked for you shortens your time to completion. I don't necessarily condone this as it entails doing work you don't love potentially for years - but at least it will earn you the degree and then you're free to pick your own work from there.

GradSchool,3ckfng,SnowblindAlbino,5,Wed Jul 8 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"You're at a good point in your graduate career to be making this decision. A year from now, it would be ill-advised not to push through for the PhD. If you're going to jump ship with a MS, now's the time.  Your decision here needs to hinge entirely upon what career(s) you'd like to ultimately pursue. I would spend a considerable amount of time researching your options within and outside of academia with either a PhD or MS.  With regard to teaching, here are your options:  With a MS, as someone mentioned, you could likely get a position at a community college. However, this will almost certainly be an adjunct position. I would make every possible effort to avoid pursuing anything adjunct. Google ""adjunct PhD problem"" if you're unfamiliar with why it's a terrible idea. Alternatively, you could easily get a teaching certification and find work teaching high school.  With a PhD, I'm assuming that you'd have your sights set on teaching without considering a post-doc. At a community college, you'd have a much better shot at obtaining a secure full-time position. Be aware, however, that salary potential at CC isn't stellar. And opportunities for advancement are limited unless you move into an administrative role. At any other type of university (R01/PUI), you'd be qualified for an adjunct position. Again, you'll want to avoid this. You'd be overqualified for HS teaching, so those extra years for the PhD would be a waste.  With regard to non-academic jobs, there are a wealth of excellent opportunities outside of benchwork with a PhD. Management consulting, patent law, healthcare marketing, technical writing, curator at a museum, application scientist, medical science liaison, and so much more. You're in a great position to narrow your focus among these so that you can start strengthening your resume in preparation for a non-academic job market.  For instance, patent law is a great option for a PhD. You can get hired on as a technology specialist at an IP firm with a starting salary anywhere between $80-120k. They typically train you in patent law, and you have options to progress further up the chain (often at the firm's expense). A research post-doc is unnecessary to go this route. However, if you'd like to get into this after graduating, you have a couple of years to gain experience that will help land you a solid job at a firm. Volunteer at your university's tech transfer office or find a local law firm that works in IP that would allow you to work as an unpaid intern.   With a MS, your non-teaching/non-research jobs are extremely limited. I'd say get your MS if you want to do lab tech level research in industry or if you want to teach CC/HS. Otherwise, a PhD would give you the most options. Just be sure to fully understand these options and choose a focus sooner rather than later."

GradSchool,3ckfng,CaptainDickFarm,3,Wed Jul 8 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"No problem. Let me know if you have any questions about alternative career paths or anything. I waited to the bitter end of a PhD to make serious considerations about the complicated job market for PhDs not wanting to take a post-doc, so I'm well aware of what's out there and what I should've done in retrospect."
GradSchool,3ckfng,omnomnomscience,3,Wed Jul 8 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree that a MS limits you in non-teaching and non-research jobs. In fact, I'd say that an MS is the better option if your plans aren't academia, research, or being a subject matter expert. In my experience in industry, a master's is generally preferred to a PhD outside of lab or SME positions."
GradSchool,3ckfng,omnomnomscience,3,Wed Jul 8 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"You won't get a teaching position beyond adjuncting without a terminal degree these days; even though the CCs in my state still officially advertise as ""MS required, Ph.D. preferred"" they don't bother to look at MS applicants since they are flooded with Ph.D.s. At an SLAC you won't even get that close.  Research expectations are relatively minimal at the lowest-ranked public institutions, some small privates (esp. religious ones), and most CCs. But they all have higher teaching loads and will expect a great deal of experience from the top applicants in the pool-- if you are serious about an academic career with a teaching emphasis then you must actively work on developing that portfolio before you finish.  Simply working as TA is meaningless today; you must be instructor of record on your own courses and ideally have done some serious class development work as well as taken some courses in pedagogy.  As a department chair and frequent search committee chair at an SLAC I can tell you we don't even consider applicants without substantial teaching experience any more-- and we require a book or 3-4 articles for tenure. Places with lower scholarship requirements often have higher expectations for teaching experience at the time of initial hire.  Edit: here's a good column on the CC market for anyone considering it from grad school. Read the comments below especially, then wrap your heads around a 5/5 teaching load and the expectation of CC-specific teaching experience to even get a foot in the door."
GradSchool,3ckfng,lemons47,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:40:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I do a lot of outreach beyond being a TA (mentoring a group of freshman students in my College, participating in fun science activities with kids, stuff like that), but I've never had the opportunity to actually be an instructor of record on my own course, so I'm curious how I could go about doing that. I'm not sure my University (which has plenty of lecturers, postdocs, and research associates all looking to get teaching experience, in addition to profs that have teaching requirements) really would accept a graduate student as a course instructor. But I should probably just research it some more."
GradSchool,3ckfng,lemons47,2,Thu Jul 9 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"If you can't get the experience at your own school then your school is not preparing grads for teaching careers, period. That's on them, but it hurts you and your peers. The common workarounds are to look for adjunct work at other schools in the area-- CCs, liberal arts colleges, state branch campuses, etc. --to get your foot in the door and start building a portfolio. In some fields there are also teaching post-docs that allow recent grads to accumulate serious teaching experience in 1-2 years, working with a mentor, so they are ready to transition into professional life.  In the late 1990s when I was finishing grad school my university hired the top graduate students as ""associate instructors"" or visiting instructors (depending on whether ABD or not); these students taught their own courses. Once I'd done that a few times I was deemed qualified to hire as an adjunct at my own school, and from there I taught at other local colleges. By the time I went on the market I'd developed and taught a half-dozen courses (in addition to a similar number as a TA) so was able to present as a capable teacher when applying to SLACs like the one I work at now. When we review applications for adjunct and TT positions the first thing we look for is teaching experience; anyone who has not taught at least one course on their own gets tossed immediately, no matter how great their research potential. This is seen not only as a practical matter (i.e. we want to see them proven in the classroom) but there's also a general assumption that anyone who is serious about a teaching-centered career will do whatever it takes to gain that experience.  Sadly many graduate departments/faculty have yet to figure this out."
GradSchool,3ckfng,jgbradley1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"That's really good to know! Thanks for your help, I'll start looking around my university and nearby to see what sort of options there are for grad students (and if not for grad students, recent grads at least). Maybe it's these positions are just not heavily advertised to myself or other students in my department since most go on to do research. I do have friends that have designed some of their own peer-to-peer courses for teaching stats to other grad students, but they don't get paid for it (they are on fellowships though, while I am required to be a TA - not exactly an excuse, just sort of seemed like something I wouldn't have time for in the past)."
GradSchool,3ckfng,jgbradley1,2,Thu Jul 9 21:16:38 2015 UTC,"Similar boat - starting sixth year, hopefully not too far from graduating, virtually positive I don't want to continue with bench science.  Finishing is in my best interest, but it may not be in yours. You'll have to decide - having a PhD will lend weight to your application, for virtually anything you apply to, but it may be easier to get where you want faster by not getting the PhD. You'll have to think about it.  The problems you listed are fixable. You can get around a bad adviser by making good decisions with your peers and other faculty. You can get around imposter syndrome by... I dunno, talking to a therapist, a friend, faculty. You can buckle down and finish the work.

I honestly hope no one reviews me though, because the fewer students in my classes, the better (less grading! fewer emails to respond to!). I'm also only at my school for a short period of time, so at this point, ratings wouldn't even be helpful for future students.

GradSchool,3chg0f,fixmycupofcaffeine,3,Wed Jul 8 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"One of the things that I'd recommend doing first/the most is figuring out who the top scholars in the field are, if they're still alive, where they teach, and if they're accepting new students. The most important consideration when picking a graduate program is your advisor (and if they offer you funding. But if they accept you, they will offer you funding. An offer without funding is really a polite rejection letter).   Look back through scholarly articles that you read in undergrad. What was particularly memorable for you? Why? What else have they written? Are they a prominent scholar, an up and coming scholar, or somewhere in between? (There are advantages and disadvantages to all three). That's not a bad place to start if you're totally unsure right now about who you might want to work with.   Note: I come from the Humanities so things might be a little different, but no matter the field, your advisor needs to be a very important part of your decision."

He also prefers that we spend that time working on our projects, not reading (in his mind reading is something you do at home on your own time). Some people have advisors who are ok with them working from home though. I can't really give you good advice for avoiding burnout, but having a hobby or activity outside of lab helps. Make friends outside your program. Seek professional help if you are ever concerned about your mental health."

As for hobbies, I have that covered, don't worry!"
GradSchool,3cftf7,ihatechickens,3,Tue Jul 7 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you are in a more ecology based program. I'm more biomedical. I have enough experiments to keep me occupied for the next twenty years, I will never run out of things to do in lab. There's always more work, it's never ending. Even just within my thesis projects, I can always think of interesting things I could try (or boring things I should be doing). The main point of a phd is to contribute something novel to the field. That means you have to do something no one has done before, and there are going to be surprises and problems along the way. Your plan will change. It puts you in a situation where you're trying a lot of different things, or trying to find out more about whatever it is you're studying. It's not as cut and dry as writing a proposal, doing it, and writing a thesis. If it were that easy, the retention rate would be a lot higher.   Edit: I should add that things like image processing I would count as ""work"" so I do that sort of stuff in lab more often than at home."
GradSchool,3cftf7,richardludwig,2,Tue Jul 7 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"I had a similar path-- I completed my my MS from a small teaching university and went on to a large research university for my PhD. The difference was my MS was really more of a ""professional"" masters and not really geared toward continuing on, and so that was a major challenge and struggle I dealt with once I got to my PhD institution since research was never something I'd even ever really done before.  I am in a science field (nutrition), but our program had two paths-- the lab or applied. I did applied.   As others have mentioned, it will depend on your advisor on what the requirements are, but for the most part, I worked from home on assignments and research (unless I was collecting data out in the community). I commuted for my PhD, and taught a couple of classes, so aside from driving to teach or go to class (or a weekly meeting with my advisor), I mostly worked from home (although I eventually switched to a coffee shop because I got way too distracted at my house).   I hope that helps, and good luck!"
GradSchool,3cftf7,SweaterFish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to see others' responses, but I've had some issues with this transition, too. Not that it's really a bid deal since as far as I can tell no one cares whether I spend 8 hours in the lab or not as long as I produce proposals and analyses (and eventually papers, I guess). Still, I've been unsure whether I'm really using my time effectively.  You definitely could spend a 40 hour week working on stuff in the lab. No problem. Reading papers alone could be a 40 hour job, but also time spent learning software packages, developing models in R, responding to e-mails, etc. And everyone keeps reminding that it's never too early to start writing. There's no doubt you could stay busy on a variety of things and hopefully the variety is what would keep you from burning out.  Personally, I've just never worked that way, though. Some (but not all) other people in my lab do and especially it seems like post-docs do, so maybe this is something you learn during the course of your program? I'm only at the end of my first year and so far I'm still spending a lot of time ""working from home,"" which means I sleep in, putter around in the garden, spend time browsing Reddit, etc. Still, my tasks get done and I do plenty of reading and I'm well on track as far as I can judge, so I'm trying not to worry too much about it.  My guess is that if you completed an unfunded Masters while working full time, you are already pretty good at being productive, so now you can enjoy really digging in to academic life. Work your ass off, but enjoy it."
GradSchool,3chiyt,orcamania5,3,Tue Jul 7 23:20:41 2015 UTC,"Check with your department. My gut says no, publishing is usually not expected of master's students. Your thesis is an entirely internal document that may or may not have publication potential."

The 2 data chapters are two separate experiments that include materials methods, data, discussion etc. Each of my 2 data chapters will be molded into a manuscript for publication. Meaning that the data chapter in my thesis may be 20 or 30 pages but the manuscript sent in for publishing will be shorter. I know its common for advisors to get in on students publications.

GradSchool,3chiyt,Captina,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"The answer to your post is: No, in most cases. But I think wanting to know the answer to this kind of question is why you have an adviser, and why you probably have a graduate student handbook. Is it conceivable you have not asked your adviser about this (but are asking redditors instead)? There is a difference between needing to publish to get your degree, and having publication as a reasonable goal of any scientific project."
GradSchool,3chiyt,ProfessorUnrat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"No, not even in a PhD program, although it is rare for a PhD graduate to have no publications. I do know at least one PhD graduate who never published a paper (and he's doing fine -- just not in academia). It's probably even rarer in the (especially non-theoretical) sciences because you're likely working in some lab with ongoing experiments that must eventually be published in some form.  You are expected to publish especially as a PhD student (not as much master's), but I would be surprised to find any graduate program actually having it written in their requirements that its students must have a publication to graduate. The only requirements are usually (give or take depending on your field, degree, and department/university): qualifying exams/papers/prospectus, thesis/dissertation + defense, some core courses, internship, foreign languages.  If you really want to be sure ask your key administrative coordinator/department staff, they're the ones who actually know to the T what you need because they're the one's doing all the paperwork for you."
GradSchool,3chiyt,gradonetwo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:34:20 2015 UTC,"I find it surprising to not publish a single paper while doing PhD and that there are PhD programs that do not require you to publish. Ultimately, publishing will net you a better job after you get your degree and (correct me if I am wrong but...) my belief is that publishing articles may let you finish your PhD quicker.  Little bit off topic but at this point, I am not sure if I am going to pursue doing PhD after finishing my Masters as I have read that currently, universities are pumping out more PhD graduates than there are jobs available, leading to over-qualified PhD graduates to take full or part-time high school teachers, adjunct profs, and other craiglist jobs with poor salary and pay."
GradSchool,3chiyt,gradonetwo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:18:29 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the field regarding publishing. Most programs at least in the humanities definitely do not require publication for someone to complete their degree. The dissertation is already supposed to be of high (publishable) quality and contribute to their field in some way, and there are other metrics of contribution such as presenting your research at conferences (which doesn't necessarily result in publication).  But yes, it is unusual for a PhD graduate to not have published anything. And yes, almost all academic programs want their students to publish early and as much as possible if they can. Publishing (at high quality journals) will make you more competitive against other applicants for an academic job for sure (especially at a research institution). But for non-academic non-research jobs out there, they most likely won't care so much or at all (probably depends on the field again).  Yup, they are over accepting and overchurning PhDs. It's all about more money (and cheap labor) for the departments/universities. Competition for TT positions is extremely fierce, and you'd have to be very flexible about relocating. You can work just as hard outside of academia and earn better, so it comes down to whether you are passionate enough about any aspect of being in academia."
GradSchool,3chiyt,gradonetwo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I should also add that there are journals out there that will take almost anything, so solely using publication as a criterion for degree completion is not necessarily effective. Specifying which journals (or conferences) are okay is also unrealistic (there are too many out there to keep tabs on, and they keep growing). Also, publishing can be a very slow process. It is not uncommon to wait half a year to a year after submission to see your paper actually in print (if it even gets accepted in the first place)."

Frankly, flunking out was the best thing that could have happened, I'm a 100 times happier now. Like I said, I'm not worried about the narrative, merely the CV and first impressions.  Could you clarify ""leaving it draws attention to it""? Do you mean leaving (adding) it in my CV or leaving it out (omitting)? Omitting it leaves a gap of 2 years that I spent (partially) backpacking across Europe and volunteering in an eco village. My new research interests arise directly from these experiences. If I do add the masters to the conventional layout of a CV, where do I write it??!  Hehe, impeccable only in that I had research and publications quite young.

GradSchool,3cg6mu,Djatha,2,Tue Jul 7 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"I meant omitting it.   The biggest problem is, of course, that you cannot control the other end: how will the people reading your CV interpret your narrative?    Omitting it leaves a gap of 2 years that I spent (partially) backpacking across Europe and volunteering in an eco village. My new research interests arise directly from these experiences.   Then write this in your CV, either under a separate heading like ""Other"" or ""Volunteer work"", or, and this is what I would do, as part of the aims section of the CV.  Personally, I only add finished degrees to my CV and the ones I am currently pursuing. The unfinished degrees I don't mention, ever. That doesn't help you much, I suppose, as you cannot account for the whole 2 years. If you're invited to interview, these two years, be it the backpacking or the masters, will come up.  I suppose, if you're young still and don't have any (relevant) work experience, all you have is your education (and hobbies, and volunteer work, and such things). As you indicate the masters has no relation to your PhD, not finishing it is a natural part of switching fields. This fits in with your realization during your stay in Europe why you wanted to switch to the field your PhD is in. This does seem to make for a nice consistent narrative that does not put you in a negative light."

Addressing it in your personal statement when you actually apply makes a lot more sense, it's really more of a personal experience than a professional one from the way you describe it. You'll probably have to submit transcripts, too, I think, so it's not like you're covering it up or anything. It's just not the kind of thing that goes on a CV.  I don't know what your field is, but in mine (organismal/evolutionary biology) nobody will care that you have a ""gap"" in your CV, assuming they even notice it. In fact, taking time off after undergrad before applying to grad school is considered a positive, even if you're just sowing wild oats (insert invasive species joke here). Though if you have a job related to your field at some point in the interim, that's even better, and it sounds like maybe you have."

Unfortunately, taking postgrad classes do nothing to alter an established GPA, so you're stuck with that 2.95.   However, prerequisites can prove to graduate programs that you've gotten your act together.

They might be flattered that you are so enthusiastic about their work since research can be pretty thankless. They might be looking for a post-doc in a couple of years and it could put you at the top of their candidate list. It never hurts to MAKE CONNECTIONS. Just like any other field, academia is as much about who you know as what you know.    For lack of a better analogy, you really have to treat it like the ""dating scene"" and be bold, introduce yourself to as many people as you can at conferences and find people to network with and collaborate with on researchgate, etc.   If you've cited them a lot there is a pretty good chance they know who you are, maybe even peer-reviewed your publications.

My second assumption is that you're not going for a non-thesis Masters (i.e. you are planning on something research related and not just paying for a diploma). Given that, then here's my experience:  If so, then hopefully your college is either A) known by the faculty where you are applying or (better yet) B) previously attended by the faculty where you are applying for. Beyond that, you need the same as any other applicant which is research experience, good test scores and to sell yourself right.   Once you're in you will probably be judged by your command of the English language. If it's poor then people will let a lot of things slide but might avoid listening/talking due to the extra hassle of decoding what you're saying. If you're good in English then people will point out the mundane things in a rather annoying way, but at least you'll have their attention.   Also you'll have a hard time finding scholarships, fellowships, and grant opportunities since many (but not all) require U.S. citizenship.   Other than that you'll quickly realize there's more international students than there are Americans, but everyone will be in their own little clique. Please don't be cliquey!"

GradSchool,3cbwnz,skrenename4147,7,Mon Jul 6 20:53:36 2015 UTC,"No one really wants postdocs to get overtime. The goal is to increase the salary to $50K.  Yes, some postdocs will get fired. Yes, graduating PhDs will have more competition for fewer postdoc spots. Yes, many PIs will find it hard to pay the higher salary. No, none of these are compelling arguments for avoiding reasonable minimum salaries for postdocs.  The same arguments can be made in any business or sector. ""You poor laborers asking for minimum wage - you are the ones who will get fired!""  There are really good reasons for labor laws and minimum wage."
GradSchool,3cbwnz,newyorklenny,2,Tue Jul 7 05:44:44 2015 UTC,"it'll be cheaper for most labs to just pay the new minimum than overtime. NIH might get an unrelated budget boost, much of which might end up going to this, but NSF and other funding agencies probably won't."
GradSchool,3cbwnz,neuromusic,2,Tue Jul 7 03:51:29 2015 UTC,"All that will actually happen with this is that, at most, there will be some sentence added to the contract declaring that it's a 40 hour work week, if there wasn't already.  In reality, everyone knows the postdoc will end up working more than 40 hours but they will simply have no route to claim overtime.    It's already like this in other countries, and was already like this in US federal government positions as well.  My postdoc contract in Denmark, as all contracts, said it's a 37 hour/week position.  While no one can make me work more than this, it's all self-regulated and I have to work more than 37 hours/week to have a remotely successful chance of building my CV for my career."

GradSchool,3cbwnz,newyorklenny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:57:49 2015 UTC,"As it says in the article, the talk about raising NIH postdoc salary levels has been going on for a long time and is completely independent from Obama's proposed changes for designating exempt employees.   ""Many researchers have debated how to improve the plight of postdocs, who often find themselves stuck in low-paying positions and facing a competitive market for permanent academic jobs. A committee convened by the US National Academies last year recommended raising the starting postdoc salary from $42,840 to $50,000. Paying for overtime is another idea, but until Obama’s proposal is finalized and approved, it is hard to say whether postdocs would be eligible for this kind of pay, Huang explains. She notes that the current rules of the Fair Labor Standards Act exempt “scientists” from overtime pay, but not “technicians”. In her opinion, across-the-board increases in stipends would be a more reasonable way to ensure that postdocs are paid at a level that is compatible with their education and experience.""  I'm not saying that postdoc salaries will never go up - I'm saying that there's no way they'll ever be collecting overtime and that any salary increases will probably not be related to changing of exemption status."
GradSchool,3cbjue,anchyd,13,Mon Jul 6 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"This adds another example of why 'STEM' is a useless buzzword to my collection of complaints about the term. As someone in the 'M' with no labs, lots of required courses for my degree, and no expectation of starting research in your first year, graduate classes in my field probably don't look much like what you'll encounter in the 'S'.  We take mostly lecture-based courses with a heavy homework load. Special topics courses that are run more discussion-style are low-key with reading and final projects, but these are usually electives and not the majority of our coursework. We have a lot of international students and there is a disappointingly high proportion of homework word-for-word copying issues, so professors base grades mostly on in-class exam performance. All in all my courses aren't that different from undergrad, just harder."
GradSchool,3cbjue,normee,4,Mon Jul 6 21:09:34 2015 UTC,"I am quite surprised that academics use that term to be honest.  If anyone, they must know how absurd it is to summarize, categorize and generalize all the fields with a measly word like STEM."
GradSchool,3cbjue,sepehrhm,19,Mon Jul 6 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"In my experience, graduate courses are much more low-key. They're usually not organised quite as well as undergraduate courses, although of course this depends on the class. For me, most of my courses had different lecturers who specialised in different areas of research for each class. This wound up with me listening to several varied areas of intense research on a specific topic; the trade-off was that the course as a whole did not seem as consistent, most likely due to all of the different professors each teaching only one or two lectures. The professors also expect that you'll learn most of the stuff on your own (i.e., study their lectures outside of class), so don't expect much hand-holding. Just attend the lectures, try to keep a fresh outlook for each one (since many of them will be wildly different from one-another), and study when you have time. Usually there is not much homework--sometimes none at all--and the tests aren't there to trick you, but simply to test your knowledge and make sure you're capable of learning complex material. You've already been accepted to graduate school, so your university will expect that you can learn things on your own now, even complex things.   In summary: graduate classes are more focused on specific areas of research, but the overarching consistency is lessened; the professors won't hold your hand; you're expected to learn things on your own (but by all means, contact a professor if you're struggling!). Best of luck!"
GradSchool,3cbjue,xkhakuran,6,Mon Jul 6 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot more of a 'fly by the seat of your pants' feel to it (from both the student and the professor end.) It's very easy in these classes to exceed your prof's knowledge on the topic if the subject isn't their primary focus."

Basically my undergrad classes were insane, and my graduate classes were a cakewalk in terms of grading. Basically what would happen is we would have to read a lot, comment on papers, and submit our comments as ""homework"". Some classes had projects, and those were more difficult, but were graded easily. Exams were absurdly difficult (most people do not finish), but again were graded on huge curves.  I asked the dean about this, and he said, ""the filter is at the door. Once you're in, you're in. We want you to do good research, not compete over GPA."" Every semester we have evaluations. The department goes over our research and decides whether we're progressing. If you're not doing good research, you are given a warning.

GradSchool,3cbjue,skrenename4147,3,Mon Jul 6 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"It will depend on your school and your professor. My experience was that the core Grad level classes required a deeper knowledge of 300 and 400 level undergrad material. Which meant it was harder, but if you remember your undergrad 300 and 400 level material pretty well, the grad classes will be building on what you already know.   Then there are the seminar, colloquium, and journal club style classes. Those are different. Most are pass/fail, and don't require as much effort.   If you have full professors teaching a course, you have a pretty good chance of them being lazy. Associate professors will be more motivated, and Non-tenured professors will have something to prove (Edit: if they are brand new (year 1 or 2) avoid them in the pass fail classes if you can)."

So the professors aren't trying to fail you. If you go to class (I probably only went to ~half of the classes) and put at least a little effort into the homework/projects/whatever, you should be fine. Hell, I took a graduate General Relativity course and got a B, and that was super hard.  Also, I feel like the coursework is typically much more relatable to your own work and interests, so it is easier to be involved and interested.  In my experience, I would say the majority of graduate classes were project-based that focused on giving you experience in stuff that might actually be useful (i.e. proposal writing, programming, presenting, working with others, etc.). A few I had were typical homework+exam classes. There were also a couple that had one-on-one oral exams with the professor. This might depend on the program, but they were also all pretty small (say, ~20 students) and they were much more laid back than undergrad. For example, the graduate students and the professors are much closer to friend- or mentor-level than master-student level, especially if you've been in the grad program for a while. There's a good chance some of the students do research with the professor. Also, I found all of the students to be more of a community, people helping other people, hanging out, etc. because now you are all basically co-workers who are going to be interacting with each other for several years, rather than random students going to the same class."

If they ask you a question and you actually do not know the answer do not try to bullshit. They asks the questions because they typically know the answers to them and want your interpretation. You can typically say things like: ""In my research I never came across that, That is a really great question I will have to look into that, and as a last resort I do not know"".

A few months ago, things went awry in both personal and professional ways, which resulted in not getting nearly enough work done to the disappointment of my supervisors. I emailed a draft chapter to my main advisor, who wasn't too impressed. I ended up having what was described as an 'urgent meeting' with both of my supervisors, the dean of humanities and head of research degrees in which I just explained everything - that I could not face one more day of a PhD, the added stress I felt because I had been awarded funding and the fact that I was losing sleep over a thesis that I just couldn't give a crap about. After this, it was decided that I would submit a masters dissertation (MPhil) by December, and I'm very close to finishing.

The article here provides a little more detail:    Dekker has set two Open Access targets: 40% of scientific publications should be made available through Open Access by 2016, and 100% by 2024. The preferred route is through gold Open Access – where the work is ‘born Open Access’. This means there is no cost for readers – and no subscriptions.   But the failure to reach a deal is not simply about the percent of publications that are open access. The sticking point is most likely how to work the financials of it to avoid the sort of things that the UK system is experiencing (discussed in the second half of the second article).  In the UK, it looks like the Elsevier hybrid open access journals are something of a financial rip off for schools."

Until the US or the rest of Europe is on board with boycotting for-profit Journals, Dutch research is not going to make or break the trend.   I'm all for open-access, but this isn't enough. Furthermore, trying to convince an organization to work for free sounds as ludicrous as it is. Quality control, organization and well-regulated peer-review are all possible because someone is getting paid to do it."

GradSchool,3cbklh,ReapFrog,2,Mon Jul 6 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"This advice is if you're looking into U.S. programs, not too sure about international programs: Some schools accept GMAT scores, those that are known for their business program, Ivy League scools, or MBA. Most common one is GRE for grad school in humanities, applied sciences, engineering (mostly, depends on the school), mathematics, and so on. If the schools you want to attend do not care about either GRE/GMAT, I would not recommend taking them because of money and time. Here in the U.S. it's mostly required or recommended that you take one or another for grad school, with a larger group of schools preferring the GRE."
GradSchool,3cbklh,ninjafizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"This is kind of like writing a resume for a job application.  If most of the schools you plan to apply to do not require either test, then don't take it.  If some do require one test or the other, do take it and do your best.  Then, if you get a great score, include it in the applications even where it is not required.  If you got a bad score, don't include it in the applications where it is not required."
GradSchool,3cbklh,JaiMoh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:17:20 2015 UTC,Most MBA's I'm familiar with prefer GMAT but like you said a lot is interchangeable. GRE still has plenty of math so don't go for that option just to avoid it. If your GPA is high then I assume you are well studied. Neither test really requires much prep to do well on and they aren't that expensive. Personally I would just take one and get it out of the way while the material is fresh in your mind. Down the road you may want to do something that requires a test and then you will have o study.
GradSchool,3cd98h,adademicq123,2,Tue Jul 7 00:31:39 2015 UTC,"Are you a high school senior? Go to the school with a stronger program in your major. What you do during the program (i.e. getting research experience) is more important than your school name. Of course GPA is important but most people applying will have good GPA, so your research experience is what will make you stand out.  All PhD programs worth their salt are funded in the US so don't rule grad school in the US out. Europe/Canada/Australia have cheaper tuition but the chances of international students getting full funding are MUCH, MUCH lower."

In the end, I went back to a pad of paper and a pen.   It depends on your program, honestly. If you're in (certain areas of)the humanities, there is often very little to memorize in any given class period (exception, perhaps: Large programs with lectures), so notes are mostly mnemonics for ideas on how to use the texts discussed in your own work.   If you truly have a lot to remember and organize from your course periods, I found that an iPad just cannot replace a laptop for detail/subtlety within notes.  If you're new to a program, I would start with what you already have (the laptop) and see what the veteran students are using for that program's teaching formats."

I took notes for all of my required coursework on it, and I found it especially helpful for reading papers-- I could easily download PDFs onto it and highlight passages and take notes as I read. No more need for constantly printing out papers. It was also great to be able to zoom in and out easily on specific passages/graphs with a pinch of the fingers.   I have a MacBook and hate taking notes by typing, and didn't want to schlep around a bunch of binders with loose-leaf, so the iPad has been great. I rarely brought my laptop to campus those first couple years when I was taking classes. The iPad was lovely to have and I've never regretted it. The app I used for note taking is Notes Plus.

You can make your intro a short stand-alone document that summarizes everything and then the following chapters can be summaries of your individual experiments. Of course the short intros to the experimental chapters will be found in the overall summary (your intro), so no big deal.   What your adviser cares about is that your methods are well documented (so that they can be used by future students), and that your data is well-organized and presented in a form that lends itself to interpretation so that he/she can determine what is publishable. As far as the form of the thesis, as long as you are following the formatting rules of the university you have a lot of freedom.   That being said, what diazona said is true, it does seem a bit weak and lazy to just cut and paste, but on the other hand, since almost nobody will read it .... if a tree falls in the woods and there is nobody there to hear it ..."

The biggest mistake that grad students make is putting too much time into their thesis and not enough into articles. If you are applying for a job that requires a PhD, EVERY applicant is going to have a PhD. What will distinguish you from the other applicants is your publication record."

I had a friend who was in a similar position, and was with an incompetent person showing him how to use a piece of equipment and then he (the incompetent person) broke it resulting in $20,000 damage. My friend was partially blamed for it resulting in his removal from that project and another project he was the lead on.  Cover your ass in case your PI won't work with you on fixing his incompetence.   That being said, I think you should talk to your PI again and come up with a game plan to see how you can get the guy up to speed. It sounds like his education is lacking, so maybe get him to take some more courses?  What exactly did he do in Korea? Their universities tend to have excellent reputations for quality of education."

Honestly, writing up clear and simple instructions for use of each apparatus isn't a terrible idea even when you think your coworkers are competent, because otherwise Bob teaches Sally, and Sally teaches Fred because she thinks she knows it well enough, and Fred teaches Susan because they're friends even though Fred hardly ever uses the thing, and it's a game of telephone with plenty of details lost along the way.  Also, if the equipment is even remotely breakable, for fuck's sake keep a written log of who uses it when."

When he arrived he later confessed that (as I suspected) it was just a publication factory in Korea and in fact he did almost zero  hands on work, he simply wrote papers because he speaks English. So now he has two science degrees and I'd say about a grade 12 grasp of math, phys, and chem by western standards. He takes full advantage of a super nice PhD student when he needs work done and even then he literally has to be shown step by step what to do. He has no understanding of the 'big picture' and doesn't even really know what the words he's saying mean, he just throws out buzzwords and makes evasive and non-definitive answers when asked anything.

I'm assuming you're some kind of student or postdoc who's going to leave the lab in a few years anyway. At some point you just start keeping a mental file of ""things I will look out for when choosing my next lab / avoid doing when I have my own lab""; you accept that you're only responsible for your own problems, and make absolutely sure that other people's problems don't become yours.

She shows up later and leave earlier than everybody, even when she has to perform lengthy experiments that require other people to help her. As a rookie I am suppose to assist her on some acquisitions, but after setting up and learning the technique by myself I realized that she knows nothing about what we are doing and she just doesn't care. She even has her headphones in when we are supposed to work together on something!  There are numerous tells of her fucking things up, not keeping important documents up to date and even putting herself in dangerous situations (like walking in front of a fenced off powerful UV laser >.<). And wherever she goes she always leave a mess of tools and equipment.  To top everything she told my PI she was quiting after 2 years in her PhD program because she got accepted in a journalism school (we are doing research in physics). She had gotten in the PhD program through a special grant that will probably be denied to our lab in the future because of that. My PI seems to be relieve and furious she is leaving.  The strategy in the lab for dealing with her seems to be to strictly stick to your job, report everything you do directly our PI with her in CC. Our PI knows and understand the situation."

An external monitor so you don't have to keep switching windows. I keep a sweater and a blanket nearby because I am prone to getting cold. I love those big desk top calendars and the sort of double size sticky notes because I love having something to write down my side thoughts so I can focus on what I am doing and come back to those thoughts later. I'm religious so I also keep some little palm crosses and iconography to remind me that someone has my back.  I'm also really lame so I print out stupid inspirational quotes and comics every now and then and tape them to the walls. If I am looking forward to some sort of event I keep reminders of that (academic or otherwise.  I even keep my DragonCon badges hanging up because it's just something I look forward to and I know that if I get enough work done before I go I can just focus on fun when I am there.)
GradSchool,3c3kvu,xueye,70,Sat Jul 4 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"One of the things that is helpful for me, but which many people in academia probably don't get, is not asking me to make choices. All my mental energy gets used up in classes, group work, projects, deadlines, juggling all the switches from school to job to whatnot. So even though asking, ""Well, what would you like for dinner? What can I do for you? Do you want me to get you X? Do you need Y?"" seems really helpful and thoughtful, at the end of the day it would make me want to scream. Because by that point I just don't know any more. I've used up all my brain-coins on school an work, I have no more to give on the subject of pizza v. burgers, or what have you.   Having little things taken care of, like food or laundry or dishes, helps me immensely. Just having an orderly space around...it does wonders for my mental state. I've known/heard of people who just take the plunge and splurge on a professional housecleaning service a couple of times a year, and they tend to find it takes a huge weight off."

Its professional training for a career in research (presumably). It drives me nuts when my SO calls it ""school"" - it isn't school to me. Its a job with real responsibilities and productivity pressure. Its important to respect that and not make insensitive or offhand comments that her time is less valuable or her days less stressful. Most people don't get that about grad school even though they don't intend to be dismissive of it."
GradSchool,3c3kvu,swedishberry,22,Sat Jul 4 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, you're a sweetheart for asking.  Second, my answer might not be super-helpful because my SO was a fellow grad student, so we didn't have the problem of one half not understanding academic life (but we did have an assortment of other challenges in our situation). Still, I think that you are already being supportive by just trying to understand and caring enough to ask questions. You are right: academia can be an unhealthy environment, even toxic, and it can be very isolating. Make sure your SO keeps in touch with her friends outside of school. They are a good ""reality check.""  Understand the academic calendar so you know when your SO might be extra busy and extra stressed (e.g. finals weeks) - also ask about the program timeline, like when she might be expected to take qualifying/comprehensive exams. At these busy times, it would be freaking awesome if you could make sure she has healthy, comforting food to eat - brains need fuel, but when we get busy it is easy to just snack on junk food and forget to eat a proper meal. If you live together, you could pick up some extra household chores in these busy weeks to free up her time to study or write. After the semester ends she might have a bit of downtime, so maybe you could take a weekend trip together to relax and reconnect.  Grad school is hard on couples, but keeping the relationship together is far from impossible - just keep the lines of communication open and remember to love and respect each other. When it's not working, talk it out and try a new approach. Hopefully she is as thoughtful and committed as you are, and if so,  you'll be just fine!"
GradSchool,3c3kvu,playingdecoy,15,Sat Jul 4 13:42:59 2015 UTC,"Adding to what /u/swedishberry wrote, try to understand that the reading your SO does is work. They may have spent the whole day sitting on the couch reading papers, and it doesn't look like much, but it's tiring."
GradSchool,3c3kvu,Prolix_Logodaedalist,6,Sat Jul 4 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"So far, great answers. I'd also like to add, make sure that your SO is taking care of her physical health. All the stress, sleepless nights, the worrying--It can do a number on their bodies. I've gotten sick at the end of every. single. term. Help her schedule dentist/doctor appointments if she needs them, and help her keep track of appointments. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of things outside of academia and papers, and homework, and research, and presentations, and, and, and... .  Make sure rent gets paid. Make sure ALL the bills get paid. Even hers. There just so many deadlines that we have to keep track of, that car payment many not be on the top of the list.   There are going to be times where she will get upset for no reason and yell at the toaster because it burnt our toast. It will probably also be your fault somehow.  Stress is a weird thing. Weird things will happen. Just be supportive. she'll probably apologize to you (and the toaster) when the paper/project is done.   There will be times when your SO will feel like she doesn't belong in her department, or feels like she's fraud. Gently encourage her and remind her that she's there for a reason and it will all be worth it in the end. Imposter Syndrome is a real thing.   Finally, if it's been a while, initiate sex, but don't get upset if she says no. Sex is a great stress reliever. However, sometimes we may not have the brainspace to think/worry about that stuff."

My PhD is lab-based and sometimes a long experiment can take all day/evening. My bf doesn't usually cook (the kitchen is my turf), but during super busy times he'd usually make dinner or order takeout for us both. During those days I'm super grateful for a comforting bowl of food waiting for me when I come home late and tired.  Another thing I appreciate is that he'd offer to be my practice audience for important presentations, even though he's always hated chemistry and my project is quite specific. At the end of the day, being supportive doesn't require specific ""insider knowledge"" or even interest in the particular topic, I just appreciate that he's there for me to lend an ear or shoulder, and I'd do the same for him."
GradSchool,3c3kvu,gooey_mushroom,4,Sat Jul 4 14:51:39 2015 UTC,"I can't help but sometime think the environment is a little... not toxic   Oh, it very much is at times.  There's a lot of competitiveness, a lot of ego and time and effort invested in things that don't work out, bad advisers, bad co-workers... there's a lot of stressors.  Just understanding that and accepting/acknowledging that being a grad student is difficult works wonders for us.  It validates our suffering.  My SO was a grad student as well, so she was further along.  It actually worked out pretty well because I was supportive for her during dissertation and she's going to be supportive when I take quals next year.  /u/multirachael's advice was good. If I could generalize it, basically our mind is pulled in many different directions and exhausted.  So the last thing we want to do is use our brain in any capacity whatsoever.  Think about athletes who train every day; they're not going to want to help you move or paint a room or do anything physical with you because they are just spent.  I actually don't mind doing things like dishes or cleaning my room because it provides a nice distraction but everyone's milage varies.  I'd suggest asking her the same stuff you're asking us.  Again, when you're in grad school you're surrounded all day by other graduate students and everyone seems to be having more success than you.  Having someone outside validate just how difficult it is can work wonders."
GradSchool,3c3kvu,I_want_hard_work,2,Sat Jul 4 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"You are so sweet for asking about this! I have two pieces of advice that kind of contradict each other.  First: her research is important. She spends a ton of time working on her thesis projects and her whole mind is occupied with them a lot of the time. You should treat her research as important, too, and take an interest in it. My partner doesn't have to understand all the details, but it really makes a difference to me when my SO is interested in what I do and remembers important major concepts. Then I can talk about something I did at the lab today without having it become a massive lecture re-explaining all the background information.   Second: help her expand her life beyond research. As a PhD student, it's so easy to fall into the trap of thinking your thesis is the only thing that matters in your life, and that your value as a person is directly tied to how well your research is going. Cultivate shared hobbies with her and create opportunities for her to achieve goals and finish projects that have nothing to do with research. This could be training for a race together, doing an art project, volunteering for a local charity... anything fun and stress-relieving where she can feel like she's making progress and kicking ass, because that is a rare feeling in academic life. Give her lots of genuine praise for her achievements in these things -- nobody ever praises our academic work; the best we can hope for is the absence of professors' criticism.   And, of course, the very best thing you can do is talk to your fiancee about what she needs, since her needs might be different from mine."

However, we were not always LD, we met in undergrad. I went off to grad school and he went off to the Navy. I also live by myself in a college town where I do not know a lot of people (I go to a different school than I did for my undergrad).   I have mild depression, anxiety, ADHD, and an eating disorder. So being in graduate school is extra hard for my well-being. Whenever I am feeling super down, I will call my SO (he isn't overseas, so I can call him at almost anytime). He is really good at calming me down...he has even calmly talked me out of killing myself. He never raises his tone of voice, which is very soothing for me. He never gets angry with me for being so manic. He never says to me, ""you're overreacting"" or ""calm down, its just school."" If he were to say these things, it would drive me up the wall because he has no idea what its like in higher academia. People tend to not understand the huge difference between undergrad and graduate school. Some people I know basically think that its just a ""small extension"" of undergrad work, which is SO FALSE. Its a completely different world; it's 100x more work; the level of learning and comprehension is extraordinarily different.    You're right, we do isolate ourselves more. I think it has to do with sort of being competitive with one another, and because its hard to be around people who are just as stressed as you are (lots of negative energy). Since we are LD, there isn't much he can do directly. Rather, he has to used his words very carefully with me lol. One thing he always reminds me to do is take a goddamn break. I am an extreme overachiever, I work hard for my 4.0 GPA. I work myself to pure exhaustion and disillusionment. He HAS to remind me all the time to put my work away and go outside for a little bit, go workout, or have a tasty meal, etc.   Just from my point of view, one of the things you shouldn't do is try to understand her graduate school problems, because its going to be frustrating for the both of you if you try. Its one of those things that you can't understand unless you've been through it. She may say, ""you just don't understand."" And you should respond with, ""You're right, I don't, but I want to be supportive"" and just talk calmly with her about her day.

She's listens to what's upsetting me, and asks questions to increase her understanding of the issues I'm facing. Most of the issues I'm facing are just a different shade of the same sort of issues anyone in any job faces - issues between coworkers, issues with my PI, issues with the work itself, etc.  Academia is only as toxic as the people who don't know how to handle being in it - it's a somewhat atypical working environment, but then, today, lots of work environments are atypical. For example, the people I entered the program with, my class cohort, are all extremely supportive of one another. We can go weeks without seeing some individuals, but we're all there for one another if needed. My lab mates are the same way. I don't think this is particularly different than having good coworkers, and part of having good coworkers means being a good coworker.  So, you know. Normal couple stuff. Have lots of sex.

Ames Lab isn't a part of Iowa State, but it's on campus and there's a lot of crossovers between ISU and Ames Lab. Ames Lab pulls in a lot of great research money and was a part of a $100m grant a few years ago for rare earth research. Regardless of what you do, you'll be well connected at Iowa State.  Also, I liked Ames a lot more than Baltimore. Homewood is gorgeous, but the cost of living is so much higher.

Especially in academia, your chances of doing a PhD later are substantially diminished with an online program because of the lack of research/publication opportunities. I know people have different reasons for going for an online degree (family/work obligations, cost etc.), but just keep that in mind and think about how much this degree is supposed help your career goals.

I rewrote the section and ended up really strengthening the paper by making a much more solid link to sources supporting my choices, then just submitted the paper to a different journal and got a pretty easy R&R.

Don't write papers by yourself. (Unless you are particularly fond of rejection.) Until you have published 100 papers, you shouldn't be sole authoring a paper. Even then, 9 times out of 10, it'd be better to get a second opinion. Translating the editor's verdict: ""This is interesting work, but it's not presented right."" You need to get someone with more experience involved, and this should be your supervisor (unless s/he is a moron)."

GradSchool,3c01wb,hojoojoh,8,Fri Jul 3 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"All? I've written and published papers in History, Computer Science, and Mathematics Education, and in all cases my first drafts were naively unsuited for publication. After my supervisors, colleagues, or random other researchers went over it, it always improved drastically. The style, the choice of words, the strength of your claims, the way to enter and continue a discussion, what literature to include and what not, and so on, are all things I had/have trouble with, as I was/am not yet privy to the nuances of the particular community of research I was/am working in."
GradSchool,3c01wb,Djatha,3,Fri Jul 3 17:57:33 2015 UTC,"I suppose I read that as getting your supervisor to co-author with you.  Of course having a fresh set of eyes (especially those of an expert) is common, advisable, and maybe even necessary in the writing processes across any fields.  Co-authorship (w/ supervisor) is something else.  Something I don't know much about or see very often in history."
GradSchool,3c01wb,hojoojoh,6,Fri Jul 3 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm coming from a science background, where co-authorship is almost a given. But even in a subject where co-authorship is uncommon, getting proper feedback is still important, especially for a first paper."
GradSchool,3c01wb,sb452,2,Fri Jul 3 19:03:43 2015 UTC,"True. Doing history is often a quite lone occupation, I suppose. I think I have only one history paper published with a second author, for the rest I was the lone author. In Computer Science it is often common to include all the people in the projectgroup who contributed to the research the paper is about. In Education, too, I suppose, although the project groups are usually smaller."

I think I have only one history paper published with a second author, for the rest I was the lone author.    Yep. My first publication in history was in the late 1980s and co-authored with a peer (another student). Since then the only things I've co-authored have been introductions to co-edited volumes or articles in science/interdisciplinary journals. All of my history pubs, including my books/book chapters, have been solo.  Historians generally don't like to play with others."
GradSchool,3c01wb,SnowblindAlbino,2,Sat Jul 4 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"Historians generally don't like to play with others.   True. Doing research/science is often a collaborative effort, if not bureaucratically, then in spirit. The only time I have had conflicts with other researchers regarding sharing, supporting, and collaborating with each other, was with other historians.   Once, at a conference, we were talking about some obscure sources and although I Immediately I offered to send my bibliography to the others, the others didn't offer to give anything back. More so, when I explicitly asked, one even outright told me he wouldn't share it with me because it was his ""discovery"" and I was a fool to share mine with him, for he would use it to ""scoop"" me. This lack of cooperation was one of the reasons I changed fields, actually."

Indeed. I remember being told by my undergraduate advisor never to reveal my sources to people unless I was publishing my work-- knowing how to find (and use) sources was what made our work valuable. I would go that far necessarily, but I'm also not going to share my primary source finds with others who might publish them first! My first book was based on two years of painstaking archival research and I remember a guy at a conference asking me to share my sources so he could use them in a paper he was writing-- I told him he'd have to wait for the book as I damn sure wasn't going to give him the results of my hard work so he could rush it into a journal while my book was in press."
GradSchool,3c01wb,SnowblindAlbino,2,Sat Jul 4 22:43:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I hate blanket advice that assumes all disciplines have the same standards. Historians do have coauthors but it tends to be the first person writes a paper, lets person #2 look over it/provide input, and then puts the 2nd person's name on the paper with the understanding that person #2 will do the same for them at a later date. It's a way for friends/peers to boost their publications when they first start out. At least that's how it's been explained to me."
GradSchool,3c01wb,annerevenant,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:15:20 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's the nuances of publishing your advisor has experience in that you do not.

That is field-depenent of course; in many there is no collaboration at all. My advisor never read a word of any of my papers and didn't see my diss chapters until they were done. The book that came from the diss was entirely my own own, and while he (and others) were noted in the acknowledgements they had nothing to do with the research or writing beyond approving the diss.  It's great to have feedback, and everyone needs an editor. But not all fields or projects are collaborative."

GradSchool,3c01wb,commac,5,Sat Jul 4 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's just as weird; I would never allow someone to put my name on anything that I did not have final editing authority on at the very least. No way I'd let my reputation in any way rest in the hands of a graduate student. But of course, that's how some of these STEM folks get 200+ publications-- they don't actually write any of them themselves and often their ""contribution"" is simply funding or supervising a lab. It's a very different world from most of the humanities and social sciences, and for good reason.  Personally, I find collaboration usually quite frustrating and almost always end up writing or rewriting the final product myself, as I'm never very happy with the drafts written by others, be it a major grant application, a journal article, or just a departmental memo. By contrast, I have colleagues who don't ever want to write anything and are happy enough to put their name on anything that seems to have been spell checked at some point."
GradSchool,3c01wb,SnowblindAlbino,12,Sat Jul 4 06:02:58 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but TS violated the ethical standards of every major publisher on earth. I've submitted around 30 articles and EVERY TIME you have to click the radio button that says ALL AUTHORS have read and approved of the manuscript.   Also, if you are using your adviser's lab and equipment or if you are working on one of his/her funded projects, it is a bit more than a formality that they are an author.

No. It would likely violate the journal's authorship policy to submit a paper without the consent of all the authors. In fact, the journal may require contact information for all authors as part of the submission process and then, upon submission, send out ""you have been listed as an author on a submitted paper"" notifications via email to all authors."

It's a completely standard part of the process, not a bad reflection on you.

But the original SVM (a very popular machine learning technique) paper was rejected multiple times before finally being accepted. Another paper got rejected many times before finally getting accepted, and also winning the ""test of time award"" 10 years later.   So, rejection is definitely a part of the process and it is extremely difficult to get a paper accepted on the first attempt. Your supervisor MUST be kept updated about the reviews and you are both responsible for whatever happened to the paper. Finally, I think it is considered unacceptable to submit a paper without an author's consent. If you submit to another journal without your supervisor knowledge, he will be mad even if it gets accepted."

No that is not okay, since he's a co-author, he not only should be informed about the state of the paper out of courtesy, but also out of the fact that his name is on the paper. It's not like he's not going to find out, and why would you think it's better if he found out indirectly months from now? That's a terrible idea.  It's a rejection, so what, rejection is the norm not the exception. Your supervisor (presumably is) empathetic, and (presumably) wants to help you. He's been there probably countless times before.  The other thing to think is why wouldn't you make your paper better by incorporating the editor's feedback. Though this paper did not go to review, for papers that do and get rejected, a lot of the time if you send them to another journal, you'll get some of the same reviewers just because your field is small (yes?).

That gives me time to stew on it and hate the reviewer for being so wrong then I can get some distance on it and see what comments are valid and what aren't.

I did an engineering degree through a distance program and used TA as well.  For TA, just remember there is a 2 year commitment after the last semester you take TA. If you're planning on separating or something keep that in mind to ensure you don't screw yourself over. The TA commitment run concurrent to any other service commitments which is good. The approval process was fairly straightforward for me. I would look into the on base education office and find someone local you can talk to who has used TA at your base/unit. It usually a pain to find the right person and the correct email/phone to get the whole process going. My information is a few years old, and a different service, so definitely check with someone local on the reporting requirements and commitments.  I don't know what schools are good in your field but I would start there to narrow down the options. I can give you my views on a quality distance program (which may have different requirements than you) if you are interested in that. I suggest looking at schools with programs you're interested in. Look at professors who do work you are interested in. If none of that matters to you then just look at rankings/cost and find someplace that fits under TA or close to it.   For the GRE, I used a GRE study book and went through that several times. In my field the math portion is most important and I never even looked at the verbal section. This is most likely opposite for you so I would suggest studying lots and going through many practice exams.   To get some general education, if you've been out of school for a while, I would suggest looking at a local college in your area. That way you could take some classes locally, assuming your unit will give you a little leeway to complete classes.  This way you can hopefully transfer credits to a more desirable program if needed. Doing classes locally/in-person is much better than doing the distance route. My experience is that people never understood that my distance program was just as rigorous as being in school. Just because I'm downloading my classes doesn't mean it's okay to expect me to do a bunch of shit additional duties like everyone else who's not managing a half-time degree."

Personally, I feel like I can conduct sufficient research on the topic without the aid of a graduate program, but I'm concerned that research done in this fashion will not be taken seriously by ""academia.""    I'd be more concerned that the research done in this fashion would be utterly without merit.  It sounds like you haven't done a lot of research about how this all works."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,Izawwlgood,-14,Sat Jul 4 15:40:36 2015 UTC,"I understand your concern, and partially your skepticism. but utterly means completely, absolutely. Claiming that you absolutely have to be a graduate program student in order to produce quality, valid research is a slippery slope. if you had said ""research done in this fashion would most likely have less merit,"" then I'd be inclined to agree with you, as I agree that graduate programs provide enormous benefits in terms of refining one's research. but you're basically saying it's impossible for a person to adequately research a specific topic on their own. i don't know for certain that I personally will be able to get my research published without entering a grad program. but I do know that human beings have the potential, the capacity to do so. it just requires a lot of reading, and asking a lot of questions."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,PhDforaDay,15,Sat Jul 4 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"I'll be nice and brief here.   Academe is not a club of enthusiasts; it's a community of professionals. Just like there are ""bankers,"" and within that category there are those working in investment, ForEx, or whatever zillion-and-one other sub-categories. Thus, there is a community of linguistic scholars--people who've spent most of their lives researching some very finely focused questions, but who are also in contact with the general ebbs and flows of professional research in linguistics. What you're saying is that you're going to, without being a part of this circulation of conversations, this discourse, come up with something that is going to make an impact.   So, right away, the chances are vanishingly small. This isn't mathematics where it is, infrequently, the case that some complete maverick storms the profession with an unheard-of approach that solves a century-old problem.   Have you considered how, precisely, you are going to go about your research? How will you access articles, databases, archives, source documents, etc. etc. whatever is needed? Most of them require institutional access, else (thanks to greed-suffused publishers) you are looking at $80 or more per article in many cases. What debt? Any linguistics program worth the name will be fully funded, will give you a stipend, health insurance, etc. Any PhD program in any field is going to give you that much at minimum. Have you even looked at the program terms of good linguistics departments? You are proposing to offer research that sidesteps peer review. Not just at the point of publication, but in the very development of your contribution: methodology, contextualization in the current conversations, etc. That is absurd and against the very principle of professional scholarship.  ""...feel confident I can continue forward without making errors/assumptions.""   You have so much to learn that I won't even bother criticizing this assertion."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,mambeu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:38:04 2015 UTC,".3 You are proposing to offer research that sidesteps peer review. Not just at the point of publication, but in the very development of your contribution: methodology, contextualization in the current conversations, etc. That is absurd and against the very principle of professional scholarship.   How did you get from ""publishing without going to grad school"" to ""sidestepping peer review""? The latter is not necessitated by the former, and I don't see where in OP's posts s/he gives that impression."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,PhDforaDay,-7,Mon Jul 13 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"All of the linguistics articles I wish to cite are widely available. I have no interest in using the latest buzzword articles behind fee-based gated research communities, particularly when you yourself admitted these systems are largely designed to make a quick buck. No, I think you'll find that the best research is talked about so much that it is almost always very easy to access. Not until now, as I was pretty set against attending a grad program until I discovered many of them fully fund their students. I'm so glad I made this thread. A lot of people have been very helpful. Debatable; if the content is valid, and it is accepted by a peer-reviewed publisher, then that does not side-step peer review at all. You can preach all you want that one cannot possibly form a coherent research paper without the help of those who have ""put in the time,"" but that seems more like a lack of faith in a person's ability to think and research independently. If all the articles I wish to expand upon are accessible, I can see their methodology and contextualization within the article, within the books that they publish. You're essentially saying that reading others' work, and expanding on it using a logical process and unbiased, objective analysis, is absurd. That's absurd.    The accusations that I view myself as some maverick Isaac Newton are tiresome at best, and have no merit. All I said was I was interested in developing my own ideas on linguistics, and was worried about accumulating debt. To equate this to being a maverick storming the profession is more indicative of your bitterness than my pretentiousness."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,Izawwlgood,5,Sun Jul 5 00:30:16 2015 UTC,"Your first point is both misguided and incorrect. If you a) have ""no interest"" in engaging with emerging scholarship (i.e., recent literature), and b) think that these are about ""buzzwords,"" you are very badly off the mark, and also need to ask why anyone would pay attention to your own contributions, which we may suppose would be neither appropriately contextualized nor written in the language of the profession. I don't know who you think is ""talking"" about research, but my experience has been that it is not the general public. Not when it comes to the latest developments in a field. Or even sub-field.  As to your third: if you believe, as you seem to do, that you are capable of independently producing the level of work that professional scholars train for, and master, over the course of a PhD--my best wishes to you. It has little to do with ""putting in the time"" and more to do with the fact that a PhD is so much more about simply doing some coursework or making professional connections: it's about learning the contours of one's tiny sub-specialization(s) within a field, about mastering the conversations of those specializations and understanding the larger picture, about learning how to ask research questions and what questions one's field currently needs asking, and then to produce work that makes an attempt to respond to some such question. You want to insist on your ability to do all of this on your own. Very well, then. Nothing to add.  Your insistence on using poorly considered words like ""unbiased"" and ""objective"" really just underscore how out of touch you already are--others have pointed this out and you've mostly responded with antagonism. I have no interest in exchanging further words on this. As I said, your premises and conclusions are both misinformed and mistaken. You can do anything you like. Anyone can! Just don't expect any professional to care. It has nothing to do with ""bitterness"" (what would I even be bitter about? I obviously do not give much weight to your assertions, and I am not even in linguistics--none of this exactly matters to me...) and more to do with irritation that thinking processes such as yours exist."

Jack Horner. Newton. Ramanujan. I don't mean to be rude, but you probably aren't one of those. You probably aren't aware of even the introductory level graduate work in a manner that I would deem your ideas worth my time, and I'm not even in your field.  I'm sure there are people who can read a lot of medical texts and be very knowledgeable. I would not, in a million years, under any circumstances, want one of them to perform surgery on me or my loved ones.   People have the potential, the capacity to do great stuff without entering a graduate program program, but you're doing yourself and the entire academic body of achievements humans have accomplished a grave disservice if you think you can ignore that entire body of work and 'do it yourself'."

It's not a matter of your loved one living or dying; either my proposal is sound and meets the requirements of a publisher and is accepted, or it doesn't, and is rejected. It is strange that you equate a decision to avoid a grad program with ""ignoring the entire body of work,"" as if universities somehow control the current body of knowledge that is in reality contained in books and widely accessible research articles all over the world. I have no intention of ignoring the progress others have made; in fact, I plan on digesting every ounce of it. It's a fallacy that you can't digest it on your own and expand on it without the help of some gatekeeping authority. Keep in mind I never claimed to be ""above"" academia, only that I wasn't sure if I could afford it."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,Miz_Boots,7,Sun Jul 5 00:39:09 2015 UTC,"Your entire post is a strawman and shift of the goalposts. I've repeatedly stated it's possible to contribute without having gone to grad school. I was also quite clear in stating why it's unlikely you will.  Academia is NOT the gatekeeper of the knowledge, but what you're doing is akin to walking into a business meeting, where professionals are discussing the company and clients they've worked for/with for years, maybe decades, and you're presuming you know more than them.  You probably don't.  Feel free to submit, seriously, there are journals specifically for this, and indeed, if the purpose of a journal is to evaluate the work on it's merit, not it's name, then your work will be put to the test it deserves.  Just don't be surprised if what you present is critically lacking in fundamental ways, for a number of reasons. The fact that you thought you had to pay for graduate programs is a good canary in the coal mine that you haven't really researched this matter sufficiently."

This makes me think, as I stated, that you have not done much in the way of research on this matter, and are convinced you can contribute to a field without doing much of the work that will get you to the point where you can actually contribute.  It's quite arrogant if you think about it for a second."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,savdec449,9,Sun Jul 5 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"Short answer: not necessarily, but...   Assuming that the publication/research in question is in fact valid   This is really where having colleagues in academia would be of benefit. Going through the a grad degree with a supervisor to guide your individual research is a huge benefit. Especially in a field as close knit as linguistics (I swear, everybody in a given subfield knows everyone else), having a supervisor with relevant interests would answer your question right away as to whether your project is worth pursuing.  Not knowing your specific situation, or where your interest in linguistics lies, I totally understand not wanting to pursue a graduate degree if your career goals don't require it. I would just be worried that you're missing out on a solid research background to fully be able to address your research question. You could try posting some of your ideas to /r/linguistics. Might be a quick way to get some feedback on the validity of your research question."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,gradonetwo,-6,Sat Jul 4 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, and you're right, a grad degree offers a ton of resources that I wouldn't have on my own.

GradSchool,3c3lwv,gradonetwo,2,Sat Jul 4 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"That's great! I'd argue that grad school should definitely NOT burn a hole in your wallet.

GradSchool,3c3lwv,savdec449,-6,Sat Jul 4 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"Woah! Everytime I've mentioned thinking about going to graduate school, the response I get is always ""save your money."" Or I hear people who say they went to grad school and they're crippled by debt... By fund you mean provide money for just the research, or also living expenses and that sort of thing? And does this lack of tuition vary depending on whether you're applying for a Masters vs PhD? It seems like if they fund their students then it couldn't hurt to apply, and I would much prefer learning in a structured environment."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,bs6,7,Sat Jul 4 14:08:51 2015 UTC,"Usually PhDs are funded (tuition covered + living stipend, typically by doing a half-time RA or TA position).  The amount you'll get (EDIT: for the living stipend) varies by location and your field.  Master's degrees are usually not funded (along with medical school, law school, and most MBA programs) and this is usually where the ""omg debt"" attitude comes from.  SOME MA/MS programs are funded, but they are very rare."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,Second_Foundationeer,-3,Sat Jul 4 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"I see! I was confused because I always viewed Masters degrees as prerequisites for PhD's, kind of like how Bachelor's degrees are prerequisites for post-bacc education. So you think I should either go for PhD or skip post-bacc altogether? I can't see the feasibility in getting a Masters in a field that has such a poor job market."
GradSchool,3c3lwv,pappypapaya,4,Sat Jul 4 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"In the humanities, you would earn it en route to your PhD; in a science PhD, the Masters is different, but something you're less likely to earn en route."

GradSchool,3c3lwv,Illinformedpseudoint,-4,Sat Jul 4 16:33:54 2015 UTC,true. how do they assess your background in linguistics? is it solely by looking at the courses you've taken in undergrad/masters? or is it possible to prove your knowledge of the field through the statement of purpose/writing section of applications?
GradSchool,3c3lwv,andrewpolidori,2,Sat Jul 4 17:12:32 2015 UTC,"Letters of rec are quite important, and having a good writing sample that demonstrates your ability to do good linguistic analysis. Your statement of purpose should focus more on why you want to study at the particular department, which faculty you'd want to work with and why (making clear how your research interests align with theirs). Preferably you have taken at least some linguistics courses and did well on them, although, while it has been the case that people have perfectly been able to get into PhD programs from other fields (usually STEM, philosophy, language studies that have linguistics in them -- the thread here is logical thinking skills), these days a BA linguistics has become so common that this is becoming rare. If you have work experience that requires linguistic analysis or demonstration of linguistics skills, those are good to add to your statement, too. But the statement is definitely not a place for proving your knowledge as much as describing what you've done and how that ties in with what you want to do at the department."

That will open up many doors into labs that other students that need funding will not be able to get into. It will also make you more competitive in desirable labs that do have a lot of funding because every wants ""free"" grad students.  For picking a lab, choose one that is fast paced and publishes a lot. It will get you out faster. I am a PhD student and require publications to finish- I'm not sure what the requirements are for a Master's but the more you publish- even small articles or low impact journals- will help you get employed after.   In my program you can choose an advisor in whatever department as long as they have an appointment in your department. For example, I wanted to work for an advisor in the school of medicine so we filled out a form for him to be part of biomedical science. It's all just paperwork. Many students I know work in the school of dentistry, or came in under genetics but work in a cancer or neuro lab.   Remember that the goal is to graduate and then start your career. Don't get stuck pursuing ""science for science's sake"". Choose a lab that will get you out and then you can choose what you want to do with the rest of your career.

Choose a lab that will get you out and then you can choose what you want to do with the rest of your career.   This. When interviewing with different lab advisers, make sure their philosophies and management style of their students align with your goals. Ask [the lab students themselves] how long it takes for the typical person to graduate with their MS from that lab. From experience, you don't want to be stuck with a PI who believes in doing the science for science's sake, especially if you're paying out of pocket. The beauty of being on a grant/being funded is that it generally only sustains a certain amount of time, thus you should be done with your research within that time frame.   Be sure to formulate professional and polite questions that will help you determine objective alignment with research and your career.  Good luck!"

I picked a small lab with very little funding, but I LOVE what I study. You're free to pick an advisor who has the time, but maybe not the money for a new student.  I wanted a good advisor-student relationship for my lab. I asked other grad students in the lab and the advisor about how much interaction with the boss was normal, what is the best way to contact the boss, what lab hours were expected, what the graduation requirements were, etc. I knew what I wanted in a lab and made sure that it was a right fit for me. It may not be as big of a commitment for you, but make sure you won't be miserable.  In picking an advisor outside of your discipline, find someone who recognizes your strengths and can advise you well on what your degree will be in. My PI is in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and I am Biomedical Engineering. If she wasn't well versed in my field, I would be the lab ""expert"" as a first year. Just make sure you have the support you need. Also, that your department say that they CAN advise you, but that's just paperwork."
GradSchool,3bz4r1,clammyjmoosen,2,Fri Jul 3 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"The short answer is ""yes,"" but what do you mean by your own funding? You mean the PI won't have to pay your salary? Do you mean that in addition to your salary you are also bringing along a budget for consumables and small equipment (a research fellowship)?  In any case, the more you bring to the table the less risk you are to any PI and the more freedom you will have to work on what you want, as opposed to being paid by a project that has to produce results and deliverables within the context of that particular project.  I would concentrate on finding a PI who can give you total access to the particular equipment you will need and who has already published in the area you want to study.   However, if you want to work on your own thing and don't already have a work plan or something already written that resembles a project, the PI might still balk at you. You are going to talk up space, time, and resources and if you are totally disorganized it is still a losing proposition for the PI, so be prepared and organized. If you don't feel you can do this kind of preparation your best bet would be to find a PI who already has something funded that is close to what you want to do. The work will already be structured (which will save lots of time) and the PI will be (should be) motivated to see you succeed because it means their funded project succeeds."

Have you considered a 3rd option, like getting a project manager job or something similar, so you could stay in place for a while? I would think it would be a lot easier to be on your own when your daughter starts school.   I would not advise doing a PhD in an un-accredited program, especially if you want to do research. Also, if you want to do research, you should be in a program matching your research interests, because you need that experience. A PhD program for research is more like an apprenticeship, it will set you up for the work that you will do afterword. It's not really worth it to do the degree in a program that doesn't meet your needs, unless you just want to teach. Hope that helps, sorry I don't have the exact experience you're looking for!"

By design it finds the minimum amount of time you need to memorize something.  And I'll second /u/cdb3492 in the idea that you should look for the overall message. Find or figure out what the central message is, try to integrate that into your existing knowledgebase, and then go back and look for details that put more nuance on the subject.  And to second /u/Azhain's line of thought: it's also important to know what you don't know, as well as knowing what you need to know to answer a given question (i.e., what are the relevant factors, how much do they influence the outcome?)"

You're doing great.  I find it enormously helpful to not take notes while reading unless I'm answering a question. Use a highlighter and use sticky notes in the book to write notes or questions you've thought of. This helps me to stay more engaged with the book.  Repetitive, non-melodic meditation music helps me to focus when I'm having trouble working efficiently, especially if I'm getting tired. There is a ton on youtube. Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmtZrA-O1WY or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nby5jgjb0Dk  I'm also a fan of the 1-3-5 rule, where each day you set a to-do list with 1 big task, 3 moderate tasks, and 5 small tasks, and when you are working on one and you start losing focus or getting discouraged, take a break from that, complete one of your 5 small tasks, and return to your original task. That way I stay productive doing something."
GradSchool,3bx4k3,eavc,4,Fri Jul 3 07:38:59 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the reading thing. It's pretty routine in any discipline to have a mega shit ton of reading to do. It's impossible to do it all, and most of the time professors don't expect that you have read everything word for word. What you should be focusing on at this point is you- what ideas in the text speak to you very clearly and meaningfully?   Answer the questions, but do so in ways you find personally meaningful. You won't do particularly amazing writing or speaking about things that you don't enjoy. In relation to your efficiency question- would you rather know a lot of stuff that you think is unimportant, or a smaller and more thorough understanding of the things that matter to you in the discipline?   You're there to sponge, but also to wring out that sponge and make some meaning!"
GradSchool,3bx4k3,_sarahdactyl_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this.  For an aspiring English teacher, I've been doing a crappy job of reading with a purpose; I've just been trying to gather/organize/synthesize all the information I could find. Instead, what I could do is look at the questions first and then read only for that. Like, only pull out information that will help answer those questions. The rest -- anything that I connect with but doesn't answer a question -- can be pulled out later on, on my own terms."
GradSchool,3bx4k3,Djatha,2,Fri Jul 3 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"I find what questions I need the text for, and I skim the chapter/s for only that information. I feel like I'm cheating myself, or the kids I'll one day work with, and I'm setting myself up for failure.   You're only cheating yourself if those topics are topics you care about (or if you're entirely missing out on being exposed to some new topic).  And absolutely don't feel guilty. Everyone's busy; everyone has to make choices and compromises about what gets shortchanged.  I tend to skip or skim a ton of assigned reading (out of necessity). But I'm clear on the topics I find interesting and spend a lot of extra time on reading and work that nobody assigned me as I try to really delve into those topics.  Graduate school is about beginning to develop expertise. Ultimately there's a great deal of self-direction that has to happen to get there. It's your education to spend how you choose. Don't let it happen to you - you dictate what you want to get from it and then make no apologies."

I learned it early in primary school and got good at it during my long, long educational career. Annotating text structure, makes for great and fast re-reading of a text. It also helps finding the good parts of a text. Assuming well written texts, regardless true or not: read the first and last paragraph of a section; read the first and last line of a paragraph; then decide if it is worth to read the whole thing. Most often it isn't. (Note to self: my own texts have the same problem ... :-) Titles and headings are often a good summary. Don't write things down that do not add anything to that ""summary"" written by the author. Okayish is good enough. Don't sweat it. Most people are probably worse at it than you are.

GradSchool,3bx4k3,krazy_dragon,4,Sat Jul 4 10:15:46 2015 UTC,"Oh - and to actually answer your question...   Wikipedia, Kahn Academy, and review articles all make for excellent sources with respect to efficiently orienting yourself to a topic Challenge yourself to take a less perfectionistic approach to the process of writing. Think, write, edit, and turn it in. But do it all under reasonable time constraints and with an attitude of embracing whatever room for improvement it turns up. Push the limits of how little time you can do something in. This is definitely true of coursework but also true of publications if you have coauthors you can go back and forth with. Otherwise you might be wasting a ton of time for little marginal improvement to the end product and never know it. Flaws and failure are learning opportunities - expose your weaknesses so they can be worked on. The obvious one when reading a study - abstract, method, results, discussion - depending on what you're reading for, you can get everything from one or two paragraphs of one or two of those sections. You basically never need to read an entire paper unless you really care about it or it's utterly novel material to you. There's probably a learning curve. You'll get exposed to the big topics and ideas eventually and then have to do less ponderous reading to get subsequent material. Be clear on your priorities. A little redundant with some of what I said in my other comment, but it helps to be clear on what you want to cut corners on and to own it. Skip a class. Aim for a B. Don't say 'yes' just because. What opportunities are available to you now and only now? You probably will need to continue learning (for real) to be as effective as you want to be as a professional. You could 100% master everything in all of your courses and still you'd be outside of competence within 15 years if you don't keep up with developments in the field. So don't freak out over needing to get everything learned within 2 or 3 years. It's a long-term proposition. I do other work during meetings or sometimes class if I can without it being too obvious or rude or causing me other problems.   You'll find your equilibrium at some point probably naturally.

Changing schools would have most likely had a negative impact on my career and my happiness.  This is something that everybody needs to decide for themselves, but don't feel like you're not allowed to stay at the same place.  It's a guideline, not a hard rule.

It's hard to find a room in a large shared house that costs less than $500/month, and I simply can't justify the cost when I can live for free in much better conditions.

It is not. Maturity and responsibility levels are vastly different. This is the one that stood out the most. My classmates who stayed at the same uni did not see grad school as career step, they saw it as a next step.

Getting a degree in grad school is stressful and can cost a lot of money. A name isn't the only thing that will get you in; you need an application to convince them to let you in.

That's a pretty inappropriate duel role relationship, ethics wise. I think it's likely that a lot of the conversations you are having with your professor would be more productive with a therapist who is not involved with your program because you could feel more comfortable talking to them about your classmates. Is there a particular reason therapy needs to happen with a professor? Could you request that you see someone else (someone unaffiliated with the school)?"
GradSchool,3buko9,SirFancybottom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:12:29 2015 UTC,I was never really given a choice of who my therapist would be.

GradSchool,3buko9,Izawwlgood,5,Fri Jul 3 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"So if you're in the field of speech pathology does your professor even have the appropriate training to be conducting therapy? I'm guessing not because if she did she would have taken the ethics classes that would have told her that duel role relationships (like this one) are to be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and this is definitely not necessary. Even if she hasn't, how can she and the others involved in setting this up actually believe that you and she can truly separate the roles of student/professor and client/therapist. From what you've said in other replies it sounds like not having your professor as a therapist isn't really an option. It sounds like you might just have to power through the ""therapy"" if you want to be successful in your program, but I want to validate that the situation you are in sounds incredibly uncomfortable, and you are completely justified in not feeling okay with it. I would encourage you, also, to seek out some therapy outside of your department, to do some real work on whatever interpersonal issues you have and to work through any issues that might come up working with your professor as a therapist."

GradSchool,3buko9,OpticaScientiae,6,Fri Jul 3 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it's up to you.  I don't see anything in your description that unambiguously suggests that your professor is overstepping her boundaries, but at the same time if you don't feel comfortable with the setup she mustn't force you to comply.  If you really feel uncomfortable, you need to voice it to her firmly and explain to her why you feel this way.  Then it's up to you if after her counterarguments you choose to set up boundaries and continue or politely demand a change due to the discomfort it causes you; eg, to have someone else be the therapist, or not ask you to report your conversations with others.  From what I've read, though, it sounds like your advisor is genuinely helping you through interpersonal skills by pushing you out of your comfort zone in the temporary, controlled settings that is your classmates.  I would do my best to benefit from what the advisor is offering.  Again, though, it's all for nil if you're uncomfortable with the circumstance.  You are uncomfortable with being taken out of your comfort zone, and that is normal.  But if placing this amount of trust in your advisor and letting your advisor into this circle of intimacy is too much for you, then there is no point in the whole thing, and I'm sure your advisor realizes this and will oblige some changes so that you are not uncomfortable."

Ideally you'll love your research topic, but you at least need to really like your general research area because that can influence what you get to do for a career.  Look for a quality, tenured or tenure-track with every intention to make it to tenure (a lot of people say go for tenure, but one of the most helpful profs on my committee was a first year tenure track prof), preferably young advisor that meshes well with your needs (i.e., does micromanaging stress you out?) I say young advisors tend to be better because (in my experience) older advisors are often tired and ready to be done with teaching emotionally, so they may not be as invested in your success or as challenging and helpful. Also, younger professors aren't as set in their ideas and tend to be much more open to groundbreaking studies. Look for someone who corrects your work. That means they are invested in your success, even though it hurts a little sometimes. Seriously: the ones that closely constructively criticize/correct your work are so important to your success.  And if you don't have enough time for sleep and some recreation/relaxation during your average week, something is wrong, and you should talk to your advisor about strategies to be more productive/reduce workload slightly/manage time/prioritize/etc."
GradSchool,3btwxh,waterwheel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:38:20 2015 UTC,"This is actually something that I've been thinking about a lot. A more established advisor would tend to have a bigger lab, which I guess would mean greater productivity and more resources to support me, but at the same time may also mean I may not have as much contact with the advisor himself and would be working with a post-doc for the most part. A younger, less established advisor does sound more ideal the way you describe it, but how much should I consider publication history when choosing the lab? Because a younger professor would likely not have had enough time to show a consistent, high level of productivity and it might be a riskier choice, right? I imagine that I should be shooting for a middle ground, not a completely fresh prof that just got the job a year ago, but also not somebody that is so established that they don't care enough."

I can only speak for the situation in Ontario, but my sense is that getting any sort of funding for international students (especially masters and not doctoral) in Canada is very difficult -- and definitely not as generous -- compared to the US.  Vancouver is a very expensive city (on par with LA) so if you have financial constraints, you might want to look at other schools in Asia for similar programs. HK and Singapore both have top-tier universities with English as the language of instruction. If you're dead set on Canada, check McGill because Montreal is a lot cheaper than Vancouver (but tuition is higher than UBC's, so I'm not sure how much that levels the playing field).  Canadian universities are pretty focused on GPA (unlike other places where they take a more holistic approach with admissions and your GRE, research experience, publications etc. are all considered equally) so make sure you do well in classes."

You can look at PsyD or PhD programmes - most of these programmes come with some funding.  As far as I know, NUS (National University of Singapore) does not provide funding for master's programmes, even for their own students.

As far as I can tell, they're mostly meant to be feeder programs for applicants who couldn't make it into med school on their first attempt. (Feel free to correct me if I've got that impression wrong.) The most useful thing that has come out of my masters is learning how to and being comfortable running my own research project, from conception to completion. The classes I took were good and I learned a lot but they weren't all that different from undergrad as far as how much a class stretched me and what general skills (study, critical thinking, etc) it taught me.

You would need to take care of some deficiencies in geology courses, so take a good look at a good school's Geology or Geophysics BS requirements are before you decide to apply. Physical Chemistry might also be an interesting topic that I know far less about. You can also use statistics in a lot of fields, so it would probably be a versatile degree. Relating to statistics, Actuarial Science tends to be a good field from what I hear.   Science fields usually won't accept you unless you have funding. I have no idea about engineering, though. MS in geology are almost always funded, but I hear in physics they usually aren't (can anyone confirm?), so it would depend on the field you choose.  All in all, don't go to grad school to study something you don't love.  MS degrees are short, but still difficult. Your employer will hire you for the skills you learn in grad school, so you will probably be using whatever you were doing in your career.  Application cycles depend on the school. In the US, almost all schools accept applications in November-February for the following Fall. There are definitely schools that accept for January start, but you'll have to go looking for those."

Far better to have a technically-focused degree with experience-focused work history.  Any subtle differences between the paths you choose will be far outweighed by the burden of taking on more debt. Do everything you can to avoid taking out loans. Please. Going into college, I had everyone around me encouraging me to go to the ""better"" school that required loans as opposed to the public university that offered a full-ride.

It's easier in hindsight to make the statement that you still had the ultimate choice, but it's quite another when your social groups and family are firmly pushing you into something and projecting their fears and potential consequences onto you. Going against that kind of pressure is incredibly difficult, especially in our younger years before we're experienced enough to see for ourselves the way that the world works.   I personally get a discount because I work in higher education. My husband completed his degree with the discount, and I take online classes at a more leisurely pace to eventually acquire mine. I don't know how people who don't have scholarships/discounts/etc do it. I REALLY feel for you.

For getting a postdoc job, who you know is most important as well, so if your advisor can introduce you to other big shots then you are sorted.

Most entry level jobs will be training you will not get in school but they understand (and may prefer) to train you themselves.

GradSchool,3bn0ep,Cannibalsnail,3,Tue Jun 30 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"PhD student in a MatSE program here.  For almost all schools, masters students do not receive a stipend.  When I applied, the only masters program that I knew of that offered a stipend was Johns Hopkins (if you're interested in BioE).  For international students, I believe it is much harder to get a scholarship because of the larger base and fewer slots available.  Universities may offer their own scholarships but they may and likely prioritize PhD candidates over masters candidates.  The only international masters student I know of in my program had a Fullbright scholarship.  You can enroll in a PhD program and leave after 2 years with a masters.  However, this is generally frowned upon as you will likely be lying to the department as well as your adviser about you intents when you apply/interview/attend.  Lots of people drop out of a PhD program with a masters so it's not as if the department/your adviser will know you planned it.  However, there is certainly the moral dilemma you should consider."

I'm an international, and full funding for PhD programs was offered by all the schools that I looked at - but that's likely not the case for masters programs.  I agree that it's weird that US MSc degrees cost money - masters degrees (in some fields) are not really seen as terminal degrees in the US, and so that's probably why."
GradSchool,3bn0ep,eddotman,3,Tue Jun 30 15:25:39 2015 UTC,"As /u/Srozbun said, the funding for graduate students goes to PhD students first, and if there is some leftover, it can go to MS students - but it's been pretty rare. If a MS student is funded at my school, it's probably due to a TAship(teaching assistant ship), but it would be near impossible to be a TA, and do research, and take classes. I started as an MS student and was very surprised to learn that there is very little funding opportunities for MS students, internally and externally.  Dropping out of a PhD program and leaving with an MS is not uncommon, but if you only do it for the sake of funding, please don't share that information with other people!

The first year was fully funded through the school on RA and then the consecutive years were dependent upon whether or not your advisor has money. But honestly it doesn't make sense to do a MS and then a PhD -- it seems like it is a waste of time. After I got my two degrees in Chemistry and Biochemistry, thought about going for a MS until I realized it would add ~2.5-3 years onto my graduate schooling. This didn't make sense financially at all. Straight out of undergrad, I joined a PhD program and have never looked back.   Also it's pretty much a dick move to enter a PhD program with the intention of leaving with a MS.

My secondary advisor is a big-ish name in the field who is very well connected. He's quite tough on his students, and does not hesitate to let people know when they're wrong, or if he thinks that they're not meeting expectations, but once you get to know him and prove yourself he will absolutely bend over backwards to help you. He frequently takes groups of grad students out to dinner and has drinks with them at social events, and makes sure that they know that they are valued in the department.

I'm currently working but I'm still doing research with her as well as attending conferences yearly with the plan of going into a masters-->PhD within the next year or so. Trying to explain who/what I am at conferences is always funny since I act like a grad student but I'm not officially yet - such is life.   Honestly, our relationship is awesome and while we aren't best buddies she is an incredible mentor and has really allowed me to build up a killer CV for my grad school applications in the near-future. I'd make her my real supervisor for my grad school studies but I've been advised (by her, sadly) that I should do my next degree elsewhere so I'm going to sulk off to Toronto and do that."

He's very hands-off, so we'd have planned meetings every few months, brainstorm for ages, and then he'd just let me go at it.  Of course we occasionally disagreed, but as long as I took his ideas seriously he didn't mind if I didn't do everything he suggested.  He offered a lot of helpful career advice even when I wasn't really asking for it yet.  He's fairly open and personal with his students, which gave me a better glimpse into how things worked at the department, how much time he spent on things like grant applications, and how he balanced work with family life."

Only years into my project I realized he was one of the leading people in our field and he's off all the time to one conference or another. We have a good professional relationship, but beyond that we don't have much contact. On the other hand, his and my ideas often align and we share preferences outside our academic work as well—a couple of years ago we discovered we both like to read Fantasy."

He is very well rounded and adapts his style to the student and their needs (He now has 3 at the end of his second year). He is always willing to talk through my project and help me write. I would also say while making me feel driven to accomplish things he had never made me feel bad or that I don't have time to take care of  myself or have a personal life.

She shows no signs of slowing down just because she got tenure, which is great. One of my favorite things about working with her is that she's super supportive of maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and really doesn't want her students to feel like they have to give up on life outside of academia. She has a 6 year old and a newborn, and has been very supportive of her students starting families while in grad school. I don't want kids (and I always get the ""You're next!"" line from the department since every other woman in the lab group has a child or is pregnant), but the lab group treats my sometimes troublesome dog as my family and my advisor is totally cool with me working offset hours (11am-7pm or whatever) so that my fiance and I can have staggered schedules so the dog isn't alone more than ~7 hours, as long as my work gets done. She's very supportive and encouraging, especially when things go wrong (I'm developing a new method and things go wrong a lot!)."

She lives close to the arena where I coach, so I sometimes stop by there if I need to give her something or talk, and she's had me over to see her wisteria and drink matcha too, since she's a Japan and Korea specialist (my focus is in Korea). She is also always forwarding emails about opportunities or events that I might be interested in. I TA'ed for her last year, too, so we had lots of random conversations on the way to the classroom from our department building. When I needed another course for this past semester, she also made a point of bringing me to the Asian Studies holiday party (we're based in anthropology so we're only connected to Asian Studies and I wasn't receiving their emails for some reason at that point) and just introduced me around while asking what courses people involved with Korea would be giving.

My official advisor is a bit younger (mid-career) and the unofficial advisor is much older and a big name. They have different styles, and I have different relationships with them (a bit semi-formal with my official advisor and much more casual with the unofficial advisor). They both care about my research AND about my progress as a researcher. They aren't necessarily the best with letting students know that (some of my lab mates feel otherwise about them, for example), but their awkward, slightly weird social interaction is the kinda awkward, slightly weird social interaction that I am used to so it works out very well. One is usually in the office (except for out of town visits, but still reachable) while the other comes in less frequently but will pop his head in just to say hi. I actually feel like a junior researcher instead of a student with these guys. It's very nice."

GradSchool,3bln67,nitrostudcap,10,Tue Jun 30 05:41:31 2015 UTC,"How difficult will it be to become a professor when I don't have any teaching experience, but I've become an expert in the field via means of work experience and a doctorate degree?   This depends on the field and the school. Mine would never consider hiring anyone without substantial teaching experience, but many will hire people who have never taught directly from industry, at least in to some programs. The lack of experience will limit your options, regardless, but it may be possible to gain some teaching experience along the way-- first as a guest lecturer, then perhaps as an adjunct teaching a course in the summer or at night perhaps. It will depend on your local options.  Re the online degree, that's another issue; my provost has made it quite clear to department chairs that we should not ""embarrass ourselves"" by submiting a list of finalists to him that includes anyone with an online degree. That too, however, will vary from place to place.  One thing you may not be accounting for is age discrimination: it is very real in higher ed and very widespread. Basically, in many places and fields there is no point in even applying if you are clearly over 40. Most tenure-track hires are made with the hope that the successful candidate will serve for 20-30 years...turnover is expensive and disruptive. Further, many department and/or search committee chairs are relucant to hire people who are ""experienced"" because they are often viewed as being set in their ways and harder to mentor than ""fresh"" Ph.D.s. Search committees are also very wary of late-career applicants who appear to want to move into teaching as a hobby or because they think it will be easy; I've seen piles of such applications (mostly from lawyers) that don't go beyond the laughing stage. If you're going to pursue this route be sure to do it in a way to signals you are serious and know what you're doing.  Healthcare admin may well be an exception to what I've said though; I don't know the field and it's possible that in your case industry experience will outweigh other considerations. It's also possible, of course, that in a decade there won't be any more tenure-track positions at the pace things are going now (today 75% of college courses are taught by term/contingent faculty).  One thing I can guarantee though is a massive pay cut if you move from health care admin into teaching. Be sure to account for that in your plans-- look up starting salaries in the AAUP database for a few schools."
GradSchool,3bln67,SnowblindAlbino,3,Tue Jun 30 06:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think it will be very difficult to become a research professor with an on-line degree and a lack of teaching and research experience. However, it might be easier to become a teaching professor or professor of practice at a business school or community college with a specific program in medical administration. These positions place a priority on people who have practical, real world experience in a field but who also have the broader knowledge about frameworks and theories of management and innovation. Even before starting the PhD you might want to approach a local community college and see if they are looking for sessional lecturers on these topics to get some teaching experience and see if its for you."
GradSchool,3bln67,bad_jew,3,Tue Jun 30 12:50:18 2015 UTC,"The answers from /u/SnowblindAlbino and /u/bad_jew are both pretty accurate. Schools like Capella, University of Phoenix, and some other schools got bad reputations early on, and got lumped into the same boat as other degree mills. Online programs have come a long way over the last 5 years or so. I am unfamiliar with ASU, but I live in NC and attend ECU which is part of the NC school systems like UNC Chapel Hill is. (UNC is an excellent public state school, and also where Michael Jordan went!) Since UNC is a state school and has a traditional brick and mortar campus as well, you may face less discrimination for having attended online. Also, despite the lack of saying ""online"" on your degree, employers can still piece it together based on your work history, etc. If you live in a different state and worked in a different state than the school you attended, and have zero research or teaching experience, that is probably a dead giveaway, since most online programs lack TA experience and lab time.  If you already have your masters degree, you can try gaining experience in teaching by going to a smaller college or community college as an associate/adjunct professor and working your way up. Maybe you can couple this with earning your PhD and move into a university or full time spot at a smaller school?"

Yep. While the Phoenix-type diploma will simply get an applicant laughed at before being tossed, search committees do look at files carefully and it's the lack of actual classroom experience that will doom someone with, say, and ASU degree that was largely distance-based. You simply can't learn to teach if you aren't taking classes and TAing youself, so the hiring process will favor those with traditional, in-person, on-campus graduate experiences."

Maybe you could have a meeting with all of them together and express your concerns. You have a right to have an advisor and PI that help you achieve the work you set out to do. I agree that you're limited because of the specialty and not having the option of just changing to someone else.   Playing devil's advocate, maybe they're just really socially inept and think you can handle things on your own so they don't put in much effort? I think if you had a 3rd party meeting you can safely express what's going on and get their side of the story and work out a solution that helps you stay on track with the support you need.   Even if you can't publish yet, keep doing research. Don't let the 'beaurocracy' stall you. Keep doing what you're doing and put yourself on track to graduate. Don't let them hold you back.

Or $84k under with an MA.   Oh .. another thought. At our university, there are often random departments with sudden unmet TA/GA needs, look around for other jobs. Even a paid internship. Your department owns you for as long as they support you, but once they stopped support you are free to work elsewhere. There are jobs out there for students at your university -- other departments, admin departments, research centers ... go get one. If you're lucky you will have regular full support with tuition compensation. If you're less lucky, you will still have a part time job (internship) that will cover some of this cost."

Whereas a bachelors in physics (from most places) doesn't have industry jobs waiting; it's just a base for further study.  But you need to consider if you're actually going to make it out of there now. Is it feasible with your GPA? If you've got a thesis, and not a ""project"" or coursework masters, you may need to convince your adviser that you're making the right decision for both of you. i.e. he shouldn't sink PhD funding into you only for you to fail/bail. Otherwise you're not defending successfully.  Get some loans lined up and see if you can find any TA positions in the physics department (familiar material)."

Because you sound like this isn't for you. And I'm kinda like you. I don't punch mirrors, but when I'm miserable I end up with a lot of 'I don't give a fuck' behavior, do a bunch of regrettable things, then move on and realize I'm actually a really smart, nice, capable person when I'm in a good environment.   So I guess the only thing I would have done is made it less clear I was going to bail, because this is what honesty gets you. No funding, possibly passive aggressive behavior, probably a very limp wristed advisor until you're out of there. Now I know a lot of people, especially on this sub, will say that isn't fair to him or that isn't right or whatever. Bullshit. In academia it's everyone for themselves, and he's aware of that. I had advisor bail on me at the end of my first year. He didn't tell me he was planning on moving, he just let me know after he was sure he'd move (about 2 months before he left.) Now he did offer to have me transfer where he went, but it just wasn't feasible. Point being, I think your only mistake was disclosing your plans and losing out on that finding. In the cutthroat poker game of academia, it's best to keep your hand out of sight.   So anyway, water under the bridge. I would not recommend performing a ritual to disembowel yourself. What I would do is set your eyes on that master's, and how you're going to go about life after. First off, you need to get your ass into gear making it look like you're a rockstar. Do whatever you can to knock your grades up. Even if it means retaking a class that you know you can perform better in, go for it. 15 credits is like 2/3 of a years worth of credits right? So retaking a class or two shouldn't set you back. Also, since you're going to be really feeling your debt now more than ever, bust your ass to get a paid internship. With an undergrad in physics and some engineering grad studies, you should be able to get something for money. This summer is still possible, but unlikely. You're more likely going to have to go in fall, spring or next summer. That's OK, start applying yesterday.   After all that, look ahead to where you want to work. Try to network, apply early (you can absolutely apply before you graduate), talk to people, go to career fairs, build your resume, start talking like a professional. In a few years you'll be making money and you'll never look back."
GradSchool,3bkwm1,EzDi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:49:51 2015 UTC,"In most schools that I have experience with, retaking a class will not erase the original grade. In addition, the retake may not count toward getting out of there and therefore just be money down the drain."
GradSchool,3bkwm1,adrenalineadrenaline,2,Tue Jun 30 05:06:45 2015 UTC,"Well, from personal experience, most schools will allow you to substitute the course or retake the course but with the current course and grades onto the final report sheets.  However, if the policy allows, OP might be able to retake the course during the semesters rather than summer school thereby saving money.  This is what I did. Had severe allergy problems in one semester and a broken wrist in another, failing or getting a D in 8 courses, during those periods. However, I just powered through in the normal semesters by redoing the courses or substituting them, graduating with the rest of my batch."

So in OPs case, that would be 1 free class that could be spent on nothing or work.   But it's just an idea. If the logistics don't work, they don't work. Just talking from my experience."
GradSchool,3bkwm1,adrenalineadrenaline,3,Tue Jun 30 05:35:41 2015 UTC,"In my experience with engineering, nobody sees your transcript until you're hired. Even then, it's only to verify degree and maybe GPA. Your GPA is usually on your resume/CV and they'll punt you if you lied when they see your transcript.  Maybe someone out there wants an unofficial at the interview. If not, any other class has the same final effect and allows OP to list ""I know BLAH"" on a resume which could be more useful."

In that case OP is better off saving money taking something that will count because the final effect on GPA is the same.   If retakes do count or the old grade is thrown out (u/fatboy93's school), your first suggestion is good."

A professor offers you three guaranteed years of funding and you email them to ask if they can hold it for two years?  That's just insulting. Please.  I hope you didn't send this email yet, because you definitely would have killed that opportunity.  You feel bad for your current professor and school that accepted you, I get it.  But is there anything legally stopping you from backing out of the deal?  And even so, do you have ANY obligation after this summer other than ""being nice""?  They offered you what they did because you likely ARE better than their normal crop of students.  That's the reality of it.  But multiple years of funding in an area you want at a school you want with a professor who is supposed to be a good advisor... that's the jackpot.  I'm sorry, but you're going to regret this (and many other decisions in life) if your main motivator is not ruffling feathers at the expense of yourself. Do you want to attend your backup school because you feel sorry for them?  Personally I would do anything outside of breaking legal obligations to go to school #1.  If that other professor wants you to start this summer, I'd honestly jump to that school if I wasn't legally obligated to stay.  Explain to your current prof the situation.  Academia is a ruthless place.  They understand that, otherwise they wouldn't be in their position.  People talking about ""burning bridges"" have no clue what they're talking about. A bridge hasn't even been built yet.  You've been working there for two weeks.  If your dream job called and you'd been working at the supermarket for two weeks, would you turn it down?  How is this any different? You get to go to your dream school and another student whose only chance at grad school is #3 might get the chance to go.  You'd open up a spot for him/her."

As far as personal ethics go, you should ALWAYS follow through on what you said you'd do. Integrity is much more important than what you are suggesting.

Sorry, but you're going to fuck yourself over a ton in life if you're not flexible to changing circumstances.  To think this isn't par for the course in academia is incredibly naive.  No jury of academics would convict someone for changing to that other school when they've only been working at the current one for two weeks.  Their department isn't going to fall apart because OP isn't there.  They'll hire another graduate student and by the time the fall rolls around life will be business as usual. If you don't look out for yourself, you're going to get railroaded in life, much less academia."

It will make you more productive in the long run to turn your mind off for a little bit regarding work and just enjoy yourself. While I haven't been able to take an entire summer off, I've definitely cut back on my hours at work and purposefully engaged in non-work activities (e.g., cooking, working out, movies) that don't allow me to think about school. I've worked less and produced more. Enjoy your summer and don't let work creep in too much - that will negatively impact what should otherwise be some solid recovery time.

GradSchool,3bisrg,Sltz,2,Mon Jun 29 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"This is me! I was doing super full time courses for the first two semesters of my Master's to the point where I mentally burnt out (three courses a semester plus two TAships - I was absolutely done). I could've graduated and finished over the summer, but I decided to take it off completely - I will still graduate with the rest of my cohort who have only been doing one and two courses a semester like normal people.  I thought I would be reading and preparing my writing sample for a PhD application over these months but I still haven't gotten around to it. I'm so fried from anything to do with reading and writing or thinking really at all.. I can read the news and some short stories and I'm done. This leads me to believe that I needed this break.. I also wasn't sleeping and taking pills for anxiety during my last semester so it's extra justified!  That said, I do get really anxious about not being academically productive. For the first month or so I was really unhappy and it took me a long time to adjust. I took a random window washing job for just two days a week to pay rent and them some and have been focusing on lifting weights which is a huge hobby of mine. I have a routine based around the latter and it makes summer and life more enjoyable! I also train sometimes at a gym 45 minutes away by bike so getting there and training are a good portion of my day and make me feel productive enough to content myself with just that plus some reading or baking later in the day :) I think the trick is finding an activity that you can do every day that you really enjoy and can progress in and base it off of that :)"
GradSchool,3bisrg,dontspotmewatchme,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:44:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in the writing phase so I won't be doing that until I'm finished. But during my first summer in grad school I took an intensive language course out of state for 6 weeks and took it easy when I wasn't in class or doing homework. Other than that, I took about 3 months off after my comps while on fellowship abroad when I was supposed to be researching. I may have been farther along now if I hadn't, or I may have worked myself to the point of quitting without that time, who knows. But I've always tried to make sure I take breaks and enjoy life to mitigate the extent to which the misery of grad school consumes my relative youthful years. Usually I return with renewed motivation and productivity.  I think it's completely reasonable to take time away from your studies. Try to find something to occupy your time to give you a sense of accomplishment, like traveling or picking up a hobby. Aside from advancing toward my PhD, over the past few years I've become quite the home chef, baker and mechanic, and my guitar-playing abilities have increased exponentially. Those are all things that both help me feel more accomplished and are the few activities I can do that allow me to completely shut out grad school thoughts and just be me."

GradSchool,3bisrg,iceonfire1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"Instead of taking the whole summer off, I usually take part of the summer off, like 2-3 weeks, usually traveling. I don't bring any work with me whatsoever, just enjoy the new sights and people I meet. It's fantastic.  This summer I'm also semi-off in the sense that I'm seriously considering leaving the program, and so I'm actually busy doing a lot of stuff to make the transition, but I'm super enjoying it that it doesn't even feel like work. I'm still gonna do a 1-2 week vacation trip, though. For me, it's all about getting away from your everyday environment, and gaining new perspectives on everything, the world outside and from the outside in as well. It's easy to become myopic when you're so set in your routines.  Taking the whole summer off is not a bad idea, either, though I think most people can't afford it. If you can and are willing, by all means! I would say do stuff you enjoy, join some fun program or do something meaningful that you normally wouldn't have time to do (it could be volunteer work, or maybe an acrobatics class, or some diy project). There are cheap ways to travel as well."

I keep waiting for the day my adviser finally tells me to my face that all I am doing is summarizing the good ideas of others and throwing in some archival research in the middle for padding that offers nothing but incoherent and irrelevant fluff on the page. Imposter syndrome can be a bitch.  Hang in there! PhDs are infamous for making you feel dumber, not smarter. I myself am included in this category, but I always think back to my two favorite philosophers who are known to have quoted some other guy in saying, ""The only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing"" (Bill and Ted).  Just lug through and finish it out. Think back to how far you've come - I think you owe it to yourself to get a damn piece of paper for all that trouble. Even if your dissertation is total crap, which is unlikely, if you don't get a job in your field and never publish what you wrote, no one will ever know. But you'll have a PhD that will open many doors. And your insider experience should show you that making your way through grad school and finishing is itself quite a damn accomplishment. And if you do end up getting an academy position, you have time to revise and expand everything you've done to iron out the deficiencies you see right now. That's all part of the process.  Think about the young professors and fresh PhDs you've met and talked to on the way. Some seem more confident than others, but I've never met ANYONE within a few years of finishing their dissertation that talked about their dissertation like it was gold on paper. Even when the younger profs came into my seminars to discuss their dissertation-turned 1st book, I could always tell they were sick of that topic and were nowhere near as confident and headstrong in discussing it as they were on other topics. There's something about your first major work that seems to remain a source of insecurity.  No one writes a dissertation that is immediately publishable by a respectable press. Hell, I've read no shortage of books published from prestigious presses that I thought rested on bullshit and shoddy analysis. Others have written entire books on topics I thought they could have condensed into one article or chapter.  A lot of us go through this self-doubt. A lot of us probably regret starting.

I saw one through most of my MS and so did about half of the students in the department (that were open about it. I would not be surprised if there were more.)  Honestly, that's exactly how I felt when I was finishing my MS. I thought my work benefited no one, was pretty much already known, and was really low quality. I submitted it to my committee, and they gave me pointers on how to improve it, or at least qualify for why it wasn't perfect (remember that getting non-information from a study is still information. I studied samples from a lot of locations and most of them yielded nothing. It gave me no data to work with, but it was still valuable to the scientific community because the next person won't have to waste that time.)   I actually did an entire section of my thesis qualitatively when it should have been quantitative (I didn't really know what I was doing). I really felt like I'd screwed up, but that was the best I could do. According to what I wrote in my thesis, the data is intended to be an overview and not an in-depth statistical analysis, and was therefore excellent for its intended purpose.  NEVER FORGET THIS: You actually do know your research topic better than anyone else, even if you think your knowledge is flawed.  It's science; everyone's knowledge is flawed, so the goal is to make it better, even if we can only do that in microsteps. Your work may not be perfect, but it is the best of humanity's knowledge in that topic and should be shared.   When your advisor says you are ready to defend, you'll pass. Professors will not risk their reputations by letting their colleagues hear inferior work that they have advised their student to do. So if your professor says it's good enough to defend, your advisor is also saying it actually is good enough for the scientific community.   You just need to be prepared to defend by rehearsing your presentation, knowing what your thesis says, and thinking of answers to questions your committee may have, and you will be fine."
GradSchool,3bk0sd,acehigh93,3,Mon Jun 29 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"In my experience, these outreach programs often focus more on giving kids first-hand experience with STEM in a, to them, meaningful way and over-all the fun-factor seems to be more important than the learning factor. Furthermore, there'll be people already working in the outreach program who can help you better with this than some random person on the Internet. Not only can they give you a better feeling of the (learning) environment they try to create, but they can tell you all about previous lessons.   Generally, students of this age are very curious and willing to do almost anything until they get bored. Don't underestimate their understanding, as adults often do; don't be afraid to challenge them. Rather than trivial ""school"" problems, offer them authentic complex problems that are close to their world-view and engage them to explore the problem.  Having paper and pencils at hand is always a good idea. You can ask them to express their understanding of a topic in a drawing or ""model"" and subsequently have them present their models and discuss them in class. Be sure to include every student in that discussion, discuss alternatives, and take them seriously. Try to have the students discuss it themselves and offer only guidance to keep the discussion going, on topic, and safe (make explicit what kind of behaviour is unacceptable, and what is acceptable).

PhD comics understood me when I thought no one else did.    If she doesn't have one, an E-reader.  This serves several functions.  One, if she needs it to she can put PDFs on it, it's not terribly efficient and I prefer to be able to write notes on papers, but sometimes it will do.  The second is she will probably have downtime here and there where she just wants to escape from psychology.

Enthusiasm alone might not be enough, but knowledgeable enthusiasm has a much better shot.  For the PIs you've identified, look up their prior published work on their websites or at the library, wherever you need to go to get access.  Read it and think about it.  Read some related work, or relate their work to what you already know from your undergraduate courses.  When you contact them, write a succinct first letter and not a show-offy one, but use your reading to articulate to them why you find their work interesting, and how you see your own intellectual interests and goals fitting with it.  If you have any good connections to faculty from your undergraduate institution, and still feel comfortable contacting them for advice, it might be worth letting them know of your current interests and what schools/PIs you are considering.  Even if they are in a different field, they might have some social connection to one or more of the people you're considering.  They might be able to give guidance on how to get in touch with those people."

What are their research interests? Is there a diverse spread of topics being covered? Does anyone's interests align with your own? Sure, a PhD might not be your ultimate goal, but I'm sure it helps to enrich your experience if you look for a good academic fit. Also see how/if MA students get funding. Are there fellowships? TA-ships? Will health insurance be covered? Any help with moving costs? I'd spend some time researching how programs support their students."

Vancouver-proper is expensive for cost of living but the suburbs are much more affordable.  I lived in Coquitlam during my final year of undergrad and less for a relatively new two bedroom, two balcony, two bathroom apartment (split between two people) as I did for a single room closer to the city.

GradSchool,3bdav8,nuskit,5,Mon Jun 29 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"Generally you find a broad topic you are good at/really enjoy.  Then you learn more about that.  Hopefully your university has a topic you are somewhat interested in, at least loosely, and you can try and work in that lab and gain experience.  What will probably happen is your interests will shift towards a more refined or slightly different topic related to your current work.  If you are interested enough you will know how to search for the main PIs on the papers you are reading and look at their other papers.  Most PIs have a few different topics, sometimes pretty different.  Then as you are starting to think about graduating undergrad you try and talk to the PI in the lab you have been in if they know the person and you try and contact them to see if they are interested in you and give them a short summary of what you have been working on and ask questions about their work and if they might have room in your lab.  You might go back and forth for a while and then he will remember you and if he is interested he will talk to the admissions commitee and you will have a way better shot of getting in.  Depending on the university you will probably have to do rotations even if you are sure you know who you want to work for.    Another thing is lab dynamics,  See if you can talk to people that work in the lab.  Ask how hands on they are, some PIs just let the grad students do their own thing and don't give much guidence, but they expect results so you are on your own.  Others will be nagging you, but always be there to talk about issues you are having.  Different students need different things.    This is the ideal method.  It doesn't always happen, but it's the best advice I can give.  Who knows, if you are a freshman you might switch your major to dance theatre next year."
GradSchool,3bdav8,RNAPII,2,Sun Jun 28 04:58:03 2015 UTC,"I think you'll need a bit more experience as an undergrad delving into these topics before you know which questions to ask. IMO, you're thinking ahead, but WAYYY too early."

GradSchool,3bdav8,jimi_sanchez,3,Tue Jun 30 14:35:07 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to ""find a topic"" as a first year undergraduate, or probably as any undergraduate.  I can't even imagine attempting this.  Right now you should focus on just learning as much as you can in general and figuring out what very broadly interests you from what you encounter in your classes, personal reading, etc.  How this normally works in the real world is that you do not have totally free choice to choose any topic (unless you have a fellowship and strongly desire to do so, but it's not recommended) - you apply to a program where there are professors doing certain discrete areas of research, and you join one of their labs.  If they're funding you, which is the case at least 70% of the time, then they have a grant to do a particular thing or it will be exploratory work related to what they're doing.  Most of the time, your PhD supervisor largely picks your topic for you.  As you actually do the research, the focus may change, and things may become more ""your own"".  But you're basically continuously reading the literature related to exactly what you've ended up doing the entire time, and you normally don't really start doing that heavily until grad school.  And yeah, once you know your topic when you're already in grad school, then the best way to get any grasp on the subject is to start reading review papers.  There are too many tens of thousands of review papers to just start randomly reading them without a topic, IMHO."

GradSchool,3bc40m,airwalker12,3,Sun Jun 28 03:30:17 2015 UTC,"You have some valid concerns. I was worried too about starting meds while in my phd program. But I was VERY depressed/anxious and it was getting in the way of me doing any work. I decided it was worth the try to investigate. I went to campus health and saw a specialist and now am on meds and see a therapist to help with my anxiety.  I think it has helped me.  I sometimes worry if I have lost my edge, but I also have been able to get back to work.  I recommend talking to a specialist and telling them your concerns and finding out what works for you.  I am on fluoxetine, with trazedone to help with sleeping (though I rarely take it).  We started me off on 10mg and slowly moved up to 40mg. Side effects include being thirsty, and in the mornings I felt a bit disoriented but that went away.  I have been told it will affect sex drive, not sure if that is true but seems like it.  I worry more that I will forget to take my meds than anything else.  I think therapy has helped me more.  As far as being on forever - I am not sure that is the case. I do think that you would want to step down from the medication, and have supervision during that time. But I am sure it could be done.  As they have told me - I have situational anxiety brought on by grad school lol.  I think getting help in any form will help you with the anxiety. Doing something about your problems feels much better than just suffering."
GradSchool,3bc40m,evilgeologist,3,Sun Jun 28 00:33:42 2015 UTC,"I was briefly on anti anxiety meds during grad school. During my second year, I started having panic attacks and going multiple nights at a time without sleep. I was on a rotating regimen of OTC sleep meds to try to help, but when that stopped working I went to the student health center and was given some benzodiazepines. They provided immediate relief. The first few times they did knock me out if I took them during the day, but after that I found that I became completely able to function on them, just without the knife edge of anxiety pressing on my back. Some people are prescribed them chronically, but I only took them whenever I felt particularly anxious-- at first this was every 2-3 days (again still in rotation with the OTC meds to help me sleep), then it was every week or so, and finally after quals were over I think months passed before I took my last pills. I do not take them anymore and I don't think they dulled me at all. If I had another period of acute stress I would get another course.  Note that if your anxiety is deemed more chronic or related to depression, they will probably want to put you on an antidepressant instead. Those have to be taken every day and take longer to be effectual (as opposed to benzodiazepines which are short-acting and actually fairly addictive from a pharmacological perspective-- their use requires care). Anyways antidepressants weren't appropriate for my case but may be for yours."
GradSchool,3bc40m,panniculus,3,Sun Jun 28 00:45:44 2015 UTC,"Lorazepam. Super small dose, taken as needed. It doesn't stay in your system longer than 8 hours and has had no side effects for me (I tend to be rather sensitive to meds). I'm also in what I hope is the last year of the program and would rarely sleep if not for this stuff. It's not a sleeping med, just helps calm down those anxious thoughts that keep me up. I do find when I don't take it, I have crazy vivid dreams, which makes me wonder what it is doing to all that problem solving that happens when you sleep. So, I try not to take it too much. I'm also on Wellbutrin in an attempt to quit smoking. That's not going so well, and it does have side effects (leaves me feeling dulled and less creative, but I also don't go into the despair spirals nearly as often).  I would also echo the others here and suggest you start with an appointment with a therapist (and GP). I suggest going to your campus wellness center as they can often point you to a sliding-scale clinic for therapy."
GradSchool,3bc40m,aliud_quelquechose,2,Sun Jun 28 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"Just FYI: the half-life of lorazepam is 10-20 hours, so it's not true that it doesn't stay in your system for longer than 8."

I have been on them since the beginning of March and gradually increased my dose. I find that I am starting to notice the effects. It definitely takes the edge off. I am more relaxed and less stressed out.  I was a mess in February.  I haven't noticed the medication directly affecting my productivity.  In fact I think it has improved!   The only downside is that I have insomnia. But It is early morning insomnia, which means it is related to anxiety/depression.   I guess what I am trying to say is that you need to take care of yourself. If it is becoming overwhelming and your school has a mental health clinic then go! One appointment won't hurt. At one point in beginning I didn't see the medication having an effect. But as my sister pointed out, even if I don't necessarily need the medication I still need to learn ways to better manage my stress and let things go. And that is what a therapist is helping me with.   If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! Or ask your doctor about the side effects.  Get as much information as you can and then make a decision.  But you'll never know unless you ask! Things are going to work out! It has worked out for me so far and I know that I am going to continue to make progress.  Take care of yourself physically, socially, but also mentally!"

With those, I was able to actually calm myself and motivate myself enough to work. It helped me a ton. I usually don't like taking medications, but I knew at this point that I needed help and it really did help.  If your psychiatrist says your condition warrants medication, they should take into consideration your past history and decide whether you would need them long term. Many people with anxiety or depression aren't on medication unless they need it during a flare-up."

It's surprising, but many established profs don't struggle with finding topics to research. Actually, I've heard several say they have enough topics to study for several lifetimes.  When the prof asks ""what is your thesis"", it sounds like he/she is saying ""what would I study at a day care?"" I mean, research isn't just ""watching shit to see what happens"". You need to be investigating a question first (the thesis), then go where you can answer the question. The prof simply doesn't see a connection between a question that interests him/her and the day care.  It sounds like, if you want to do some study at the day care, the prof would encourage you.

I've had situations with professors where I go to them with some idea I'm passionate about, where I've already got solid ideas and a plan for the project, and they agree to be involved on some level basically for me--to further my research and because their name on the project will open doors/help get the project published.

Technically you really shouldn't be talking about your personal life except in passing so ""maintaining"" the lie shouldn't be an issue here.   Your advisor should be guiding you academically, that's pretty much it. I've had friends go on dinner dates and outings with their respective supervisors and it was just asking for trouble. There's a specific type of relationship OP should be looking for in her advisor and she needs to set the record straight from the start. Personally I'd recommend not to go with that advisor as it seems like trouble, but if she is set on that research or lab because of its research topic then she should keep all avenues possible to maintain a professional relationship, even if it does mean that she has to lie. OP is a grown up and she can choose what avenue is best for her, because none of us are going to make that decision in her stead"

If you can get multiple sets, that's even better -- you can put together exams by stealing questions from your selection of exams. Mine them for advice; they'll have experienced all the things students will do (miss quizzes and beg for a makeup, skip four straight assignments and ask for extra credit, etc.) and help you write a good syllabus.  Look through the exams and homework assignments to get a feel for the course and what you're supposed to cover. If there's a required textbook, get a copy and read through. You can steal its explanations until you're confident enough to make your own.  The basic concepts in stats (hypothesis testing and inference) can be hard to explain. The ideas are all backwards and intuition quickly leads you astray. I have a whole website and book about the common errors, and you can steal examples and explanations from there. Or just use it to make sure you get the concepts.  And if you get a question you just don't know how to answer, admit it -- better than stumbling around for five minutes trying to say something coherent. Just tell the students you'll get back to them, and do some research after class. They won't mind.

I'd probably ""borrow"" a syllabus from former courses and buy the books the other professors used. Then go through each book chapter-by-chapter. Go on r/learnmath and ask questions if you have any.   As far as presenting goes, I gained a huge amount of confidence from realizing that the worst thing that could happen wasn't all that bad. Plus, most students don't really care if you suck. They just want an A or a B. So, it's less about you and more about their grades.  That being said, think about this as on opportunity. You never really have understood stat. Now you have a chance to 1) improve your own knowledge and 2) help others improve theirs.  In my opinion, a lot of professors who are seasoned professionals forget what it's like to learn something for the first time. So, as a new learner of stat, you might be best-positioned to help your students.   Also, try to have fun. Learning is an adventure. If you can't enjoy it, then what's the point?"
GradSchool,3bbd9t,Sadistic_Sponge,2,Sat Jun 27 16:48:51 2015 UTC,Thanks - this makes me feel a bit better
GradSchool,3bbd9t,agent229,2,Sat Jun 27 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"I had to teach a statistics lab with only one grad stats class under my belt at one point as well. Aside from taking the time to practice any lectures you've got to do to see where you slip up/don't feel like you have a clue what you're talking about (so you can find answers), look at youtube. Seriously. There are many excellent lectures on youtube that help you hear people talking about the material and communicating it clearly, plus you'll see how other people structure their explanations. Obviously you need to know what you're talking about, but as far as communicating effectively it can be helpful!  Btw, do you need to do software teaching as well? If so, get started on finding data and examples soon. It takes very long to come up with relevant examples that don't have many caveats the first time!"
GradSchool,3bbd9t,airwalker12,2,Sat Jun 27 19:23:03 2015 UTC,"On top of the other good advice, I'd suggest trying to use real data sets when possible for examples/exercises to engage the students.

GradSchool,3bbd9t,FeatofClay,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"If you have trouble getting notes from others or want additional viewpoints on the topic, spend some time finding a great textbook. A well written textbook will properly organize the material sequence and create a good foundation for your lectures. It will be stressful, but expect lecture preparation to be at least the length of the lecture and consult multiple sets of notes and textbooks if needed.  I taught a macroeconomics course on extremely short notice from a textbook and syllabus given to me, despite my great disdain for the topic. It was one of my first courses as a teacher, as I had just finished my undergrad less than a month prior. The best advice I can give is to persevere. You will likely never have to teach it again, and you should be able to pick up the skills to teach as you go, making future courses much easier."
GradSchool,3b7spp,quicklywho,12,Fri Jun 26 17:39:40 2015 UTC,I've read that many industry jobs require or strongly desire post doc experience. I'm guessing this was not your experience but am I wrong?
GradSchool,3b7spp,BarryZuckerporn,10,Fri Jun 26 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, most of the postings I saw said BSc required, MSc preferred, and 3-5 years experience in a research environment. I don't know if I even found one that specifically required a PhD let alone a postdoc.  This could well be field specific though. I was applying to data analysis/data science type positions, mostly in oil & gas."
GradSchool,3b7spp,BarryZuckerporn,2,Fri Jun 26 19:51:09 2015 UTC,But you are finishing a PhD right? Did you apply for any jobs that required a PhD?
GradSchool,3b7spp,scptlw,9,Fri Jun 26 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm finishing a PhD. I didn't really see any job postings that required a PhD, it was usually ""MSc or PhD"".  I should note that I'm in Canada, and our master's degree is a bit more involved than it is in the states."
GradSchool,3b7spp,biochemistree,2,Fri Jun 26 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"What is your field? In life sciences this was true when I was looking last year. At conferences I was told by section heads of Merck, Gilead & BMS that they do not hire without at least 1-2 years postdoctoral experience. According to the flair OP has an engineering degree which only requires a masters (at least in the US) for most jobs."
GradSchool,3b7spp,scptlw,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:53:50 2015 UTC,"This is very much the case in the US. I'm currently an unemployed PhD pursuing a non-traditional career, but I did spend some time looking at industry jobs and talking with people in industry.  I did an informational interview with a guy at a local biotech company. He basically told me that a fresh PhD has almost no chance of getting into industry research. It's an odd period that's incredibly unemployable. They want someone to either essentially be a lab tech (BS/MS) or someone who will lead/manage a project (PhD+years experience).   The industry postdoc positions are rare and insanely competitive. Your only other shot is through networking - but even then, it's hard to convince a company to create a viable position for a new PhD unless your contact is high up."

It took me about 6 months to find a job but I had interviews in both the patent law field and medical writing field and ended up choosing patent law.   I had a professional write my resume/cover letter (~$200) - you basically send them the your current resume/CV, the type of job that you're looking to get and they help re-work your resume and cover letter. Resumes are so different than CVs so I found going to someone outside of academia immensely helpful.   If you have any questions feel free to PM me!"
GradSchool,3b7spp,ultra8th,2,Mon Jun 29 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"In my industry job, having a postdoc is actually bad. They consider it ""academic poisoning"".   After ~15 months post PhD graduation - the resume is auto-rejected, period. So if you can do a 1 year post doc, sure..."

GradSchool,3b7spp,hobbitqueen,7,Fri Jul 3 05:45:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for posting this. It was very thorough and helpful. I swear universities are wholly unable to present this quality of advice.  I'm in a very similar situation - I've become the old, bitter grad student due to systematic roadblocks as well as a few individuals who sacrifice their obligations to me (and other students) for their own benefit. I've been racking my brain for how to present myself for this transition, and you've absolutely helped me eek out a few of the remaining 'dark corners'. Gems like the advice of claiming over 5 years experience in X - I knew that I should do it, but you've given me some reassurance of how I may be perceived in writing that. Also the cover letter being your personality while your resume is all business - I knew to do it, but you've given me more confidence on the approach. (I feel like much of the resume advice out there is more geared towards constructing a resume but no anticipation for it's reception.)  Would you mind going into a bit more detail of how you bargain wages? I'm not at all intimidated by the process, in fact I might be too bull headed. My only real experience in big time negotiations is car dealers, but I don't want to really apply the same approach here, as this is more a two-way process as you say. So how would you recommend approaching it? Do you stare them down until they make an offer first? I guess my big idea would be to sort of hint around the estimates I can find online (through glassdoor and whatnot), but to not give them a specific number or range until they've first seen that I know what I'm talking about and propose their own."
GradSchool,3b7spp,ghostofpennwast,3,Sat Jun 27 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I hope some of this helps!  The ""years of experience"" tip came from a friend who got career coaching as part of a layoff package, and she found a new job in short order as well. It seems like confidence is half the battle.  As for wages, I'm not sure what the best approach would be. They asked me my salary expectations and I pretty much just blushed and stammered out a range somewhat randomly. They offered me a number inside that range, so I didn't feel I had much of a bargaining position, and besides, I really wanted that job.  I think if you're good at this kind of thing then getting them to say the number first would be ideal. You should definitely report back if you figure out how to do that :)"
GradSchool,3b7spp,hobbitqueen,5,Sat Jun 27 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"How did you apply for those jobs? Online? Did you have contacts at the companies ahead of time?  Your success rate is impressive, so congrats!"
GradSchool,3b7spp,hobbitqueen,3,Fri Jun 26 23:23:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, online. I submitted my resume into the abyss, and I think I got lucky because I have some specific experience that has become in high demand recently.  I knew the guy doing the hiring at one place, and it's the one where I declined the second interview. I think I probably got the interview because I knew the guy, even though I wasn't a great fit for the job."
GradSchool,3b7spp,OpticaScientiae,3,Fri Jun 26 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"On the thank you notes thing, there are actually many companies who will not offer you a second interview if you do not send a thank you. Ralph Lauren is one I know of for sure.   Did you get a lot of industry interaction in your graduate work? I never really considered how difficult it might be to get an industry job with only academic research experience. My university has very close ties with industry and they frequently come directly to our college to recruit, everyone from undergrad to our faculty (we lost a lot of faculty to one big company about a year ago-it was a big deal because a bunch of classes had to be reassigned)."
GradSchool,3b7spp,80b,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:31:08 2015 UTC,"That's good to know about the thank yous - goes to show that everyone's experience is different. I imagine that thank you notes generally can't hurt - I just shied away from it because a friend told me that his boss saw them as too pushy.  I had basically no industry interaction in my grad work. I have friends in other programs who work closely with industry, but my particular research group does not. There's the usual career fairs and such, but I never really gained anything useful from them.  I've also never heard of faculty jumping ship - that's crazy! It sounds like you've got some strong connections should you want to go down that path."
GradSchool,3b7spp,tc1991,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:23:57 2015 UTC,Is it too forward to write the letter in your car after the interview and leave it with the secretary?  I have often heard that bandied about as a tip.

GradSchool,3baju3,EssaysApps,2,Sat Jun 27 10:20:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on what your field is.   However, from my experience (and as someone who is currently working at their dream internship), it really really helps to know someone who can put in a good word for you at the place where you want to intern.   The best advice that I can give is to just start applying to everywhere that looks vaguely interesting to you. Even if you feel under-qualified, or you think that the applicant pool is going to be huge, there's no harm in trying. Don't be afraid to ask your professors for help in finding places to apply, and for letters of recommendation/advice on personal statements. It is literally their job to set you up for success as much as possible, and they're usually more than willing to help you in any way that they can."

More independent research will always help you; part-time undergraduate research is good, but it isn't the same as doing it full time. And if you do a good job, the reference letter you get will be more detailed and informed than any of the ones your undergraduate professors will be able to right you. Letters matter a lot, so anything you can do to make that happen is worth trying."

GradSchool,3b76fe,ontimeagain,44,Fri Jun 26 14:56:23 2015 UTC,I grew to really hate undergrads.
GradSchool,3b76fe,RNAPII,5,Fri Jun 26 17:26:55 2015 UTC,Why? Just wondering.
GradSchool,3b76fe,KeshasBiggestFan,25,Fri Jun 26 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"This might sound arrogant. That's because it is arrogant.  Many of us that go on to grad school are overachievers and hard workers. Many of us did fairly well in our classes, tried to do the best we could, and beat ourselves up when we got a B+.  Then you get to grad school and get the pleasure of a teaching assistant position. You realize that a large percentage of students don't care. It is apparent from the work they submit that they have done it at the last minute and, often, without paying attention to your advice -- or even the damn instructions. The more that you mark the angrier you get. It wasn't even that hard. A little bit of effort and they could have submitted something halfway decent. They are terrible and you hate having to mark such terrible assignments, passing out all these Fs and Cs.  Then you are told that most of those marks should be anywhere from 10-30% higher, because the university is a business and paying customers shouldn't fail classes.  That's why grad school makes you hate undergraduates.  Also, they always seem to be having fun and you've forgotten what that feels like."
GradSchool,3b76fe,StevenRayOrr,15,Fri Jun 26 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"I hated them because whenever they were around, the line to get coffee was longer."

GradSchool,3b76fe,theextremist04,0,Sat Jun 27 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"I was living year round and saw how much better the college town I lived in was in the summer without the undergrads.  I also TA'd, so that will put a little hate in you.    So after the end of undergrad summer break suddenly there are all these kids everywhere while you are just trying to work, it gets frustrating.  Then you have to deal with them on occasion just walking around.  Say you are trying to get samples and equipment to another lab and suddenly there are 30 kids in the hall as you are pushing a large cart with a very expensive microscope on it.  Those little annoyances add up.  There are probably more, but it's been years since I was complaining about this in grad school."
GradSchool,3b76fe,RNAPII,22,Fri Jun 26 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"This might not be the answer you're looking for but I think the bulk of the changes I experienced are a result of growing older and having more experience... not necessarily specific only to grad school.  For example: I have learned that if I disagree with the way my advisor wants to proceed with a project or troubleshoot, I gather EVIDENCE to show to the contrary why it may not be the best idea.... sounds a little obvious but a lot people will just silently fume at their boss without trying to change things or complain without coming up with a better idea on their own or explaining with logic why something won't work.  This is probably something I could have learned at any job though.  I have also learned that I simply cannot be drunk and have a level-headed conversation with my coworkers about how catcalling is a legitimate issue.  (<- That one came a little late.)  One thing that is strictly science related: I am MUCH more cynical about scientific research than I was in the past.  I've seen so many scientific ""circlejerks"" if you will where they are primarily citing their own work or their buddy's (makes sense since they are the specialists in their field, but I think that's an excellent way to disregard any new ideas or conflicting data)... and my own advisor had me repeat my work over and over and over again (along with many slight technical changes) because the results I was getting didn't support her hypothesis.  Of course there's a balance between accepting results as results and trying to fix any unexpected results that are probably due to technical errors, but I am more aware that this balance is a lot of time out of whack.  Alright, well now that I'm on a cynical/bitter roll, I'll add that I have a better understanding of my own needs as a student and employee.  A lot of people in supervisory positions are, to be blunt, bad bosses.  Some people hand wave and dismiss or belittle complaints, especially in academia, citing that scientists are supposed to be independent and shouldn't expect pats on the backs for doing their job.  While no one should be yelling YIPEE every time your PCR works, part of being a GOOD leader/mentor/supervisor/boss is knowing how to provide support and constructive criticism."

That turned out to be a mistake in years 2-3, when I ended up pretty burnt out. Most of the changes have been negative for me - chronic stress, weight gain, and a shorter temper. Plus, I'm a lot more jaded about research due to the publish or perish mentality of academia that puts more value on producing publishable work than impactful work. Overall, though, I don't regret doing it. I just hope things let up a little once I'm done with the PhD.   Have you started your program yet?"

GradSchool,3b76fe,N1H1L,4,Fri Jun 26 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"I just finished my qualifying exams in my bio PhD program, so my first year is over! I think I changed a lot. For me the biggest change was probably realizing that I need to take care of myself mentally (vs undergrad where I basically focused on grades/research at the expense of a social life and relaxation). I now spend time with friends and lots of date nights with my husband (we were long distance in undergrad), have built in alone time for myself, and have started seeing a therapist to work on some issues I've struggled with. I just joined a lab that is very understanding about work/life balance so hopefully I'll be able to maintain this lifestyle.   I guess in undergrad I did take care of myself in one way: I lost a huge amount of weight, which definitely required splitting some focus away from classes. But the focus on mental well being is great.   Of course, I worry now that my new focus on relaxation will detract from achievement in grad school. But I'm working now to try to figure out a good balance."
GradSchool,3b76fe,gradonetwo,3,Fri Jun 26 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"That's great; don't lose that balance. As they say, grad school is a marathon not a sprint. Sprinting (beyond your actual capacity) -> burnout -> a lot of issues -> some sort of breakdown."

For the first time in my life, I actually cared and stressed about the work I was doing, and that made me learn how to manage my time appropriately.   I also learned to be more okay with people in general. Teaching is hard, but mostly because I wanted all of my students to do well. Unfortunately, not every student cares, especially for a physics class. I learned to be okay with other people not having my interests (even though, at face value, they SHOULD be caring about it!). I was probably more arrogant before grad school, and I was really optimistic about people in general.

I also became more forgiving of myself.  I started to accept that I'd make human mistakes.

As for the lab, you can learn all the critical molecular biology techniques in a couple months while you're actually doing things (we started out cloning our constructs needed to start off our projects), and it's probably not like undergrad lab courses prepare people all that well for it in a real research context anyway.  My advisor was a new professor and he also went through some of the theoretical concepts with us directly for a few days first (PCR etc).    To be fair, I did have experience with some basic microbiological techniques from a past job and masters thesis, and had done some protein purification and ran in vitro reactions before.

GradSchool,3b3qig,simoncolumbus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:54:50 2015 UTC,"Explain. At first glance it appears to be an analogy serving the purpose of an analogy, which is to allow an analogical inference, not serve as proof of an equivalence."
GradSchool,3b3qig,respeckKnuckles,2,Fri Jun 26 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"It's a bad analogy. Division I NCAA basketball players aren't the only NCAA basketball players eligible for the NBA draft. Hell, even non-NCAA (eg NAIA) players may technically be eligible. The NBA teams can take whoever they want, so long as they've completed a year of college and declared for the draft.   To make a more direct analogy, you either need to expand the scope of the NBA draft pool, or restrict the PhD pool to something like AAU R1 PhD grads."
GradSchool,3b3qig,Xelath,2,Fri Jun 26 13:28:53 2015 UTC,"Wait. An analogy consists of a source and target domain. So in the source domain we have a set of people (NCAA Division I basketball players) and a percentage of those people who are successful (where ""successful"" means getting a job playing professionally at some level). In the target domain we have another set (a PhD) with a smaller percentage of successful people than in the source domain. The inference to take from this analogy is that the amount of professorial jobs available to PhDs are much less frequent, proportionally speaking, than the amount of professional player jobs available to NCAA Division I players. That's the purpose of this analogy.  Now you're saying it's a bad analogy because in the source domain, not only do Division I NCAA players have a relatively high chance of getting a professional player job, but they do it while competing with people who aren't in Division I! This can't be said of the target domain really, because the chances of a non-phd getting a professorial job is negligible. So actually it looks like your comment strengthens the inference made by the analogy in OP's title."
GradSchool,3b3qig,respeckKnuckles,-1,Fri Jun 26 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the set of NCAA Division I basketball players isn't the entire universe of eligible persons for the job of NBA basketball player, while all PhD holders are (in theory) the whole universe of people eligible for academic jobs."
GradSchool,3b3qig,Xelath,4,Fri Jun 26 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but that isn't how analogies work. You can't take the elements involved in the analogy, identify any difference between corresponding elements in the source and target, and claim that the entire analogy fails completely. Every analogy has some such differences, if you look closely enough. Otherwise, it wouldn't be an analogical relationship, it would be an equivalence relation. This is an extremely common misunderstanding of analogies.  As I've said, the purpose of an analogy is to draw attention to some higher-level similarity or emphasize some higher-level disparity, and in this case the difference you've identified actually strengthens the emphasis on the higher-level disparity. In other words, the argument that it's extremely hard to get a professorial job is still supported by this analogy (regardless of whether or not there are other arguments, outside of this particular analogy, refuting the argument)."
GradSchool,3b3qig,respeckKnuckles,0,Fri Jun 26 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it isn't an analogy. I'm saying it's a bad analogy. If you make the changes I suggest, it's very well possible that you come to an entirely different conclusion about the higher level disparity. Namely, I suspect that it is easier for a PhD to become TT Faculty than it is for a college basketball player to become an NBA player.   Changing it makes the analogy more complete and strengthens your argument. I can cut up numbers any way I want to make an argument. It doesn't mean that it's valid or good. An argument by analogy is strengthened by how close the analogy is to the situation you're comparing it to. If I make the comparison better, but the conclusion changes, you don't get to defend the original analogy just because you like the conclusion."
GradSchool,3b3qig,Xelath,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"An argument by analogy is strengthened by how close the analogy is to the situation you're comparing it to.   If we accept this, then we would need to have some way to determine how much the pairwise similarities of items in the source and target domains contribute to the overall similarities relevant to the particular argument by analogy. How do you determine this?  Unless you believe in some platonic notion of essential features (a la Mary Hesse's theory of analogy), some believe that this should be captured by how relevant a pairwise feature is, in which case it is completely dependent on what the analogy's intended inference is. I am saying, contrary to the claim you make in your first paragraph, that the feature you've chosen to emphasize does not in any way weaken the intended inference of this particular analogy. Just because it's a difference doesn't mean it's a relevant one."

I am saying, contrary to the claim you make in your first paragraph, that the feature you've chosen to emphasize does not in any way weaken the intended inference of this particular analogy. Just because it's a difference doesn't mean it's a relevant one.   So you're basically saying that I can draw whatever analogy to fit whatever conclusion I want? Because here's the data. According to the link provided in the blog post, there were 4071 draft eligible NCAA players last year, and 354 went pro in some capacity. That's approximately an 8.7% success rate.   On the other hand, with his cited 3000 TT jobs to 36000 PhD grads, that's approximately 8.3% success rate.   You don't get to cherry pick your data to make the numbers sound bad when in reality they're about equal."
GradSchool,3b3qig,Xelath,2,Fri Jun 26 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"How do you determine this?   You argue about it.    Believe me, I agree: bad analogies can really get annoying. I know, most of my graduate work was spent understanding analogy. My question there wasn't about whether people argue about analogies or not. Of course they do. My question was how one is supposed to objectively determine which arguments by analogy are better. Just saying ""you argue about it"" doesn't answer the question, because the question of how the argument is to be resolved is completely unaddressed.    Which is why arguments from analogy aren't very good arguments.   Well...it's a little more complicated than ""always good"" or ""always bad"" when it comes to the space of arguments. You're probably better off thinking of different forms of argumentation as tools, each with their advantages and disadvantages. Deductive reasoning works wonders in mathematics. Analogical reasoning is extremely useful for discovering hypotheses that are possibly useful. The solar system model of the atom, for example, the wave theory of light (the latter might be thought of as an analogy from the wave theory of sound): both ultimately shown to be inaccurate, but they help point us to explanations that can guide later experiments and design models. Now then:   So you're basically saying that I can draw whatever analogy to fit whatever conclusion I want?   Seriously? That's what you're getting out of this?    On the other hand, with his cited 3000 TT jobs to 36000 PhD grads, that's approximately 8.3% success rate. You don't get to cherry pick your data to make the numbers sound bad when in reality they're about equal.

Professional basketball overall is much larger than the 60 so odd people drafted in the NBA.  It is dozens of leagues with hundreds if not thousands of teams across the world and you need not be drafted to play in one of those leagues.  I can't think of a single place that prepares players for those leagues that is nearly as good as NCAA division one basketball.  You seem to be focused on where players drafted for the NBA come from, but that is neither here nor there.  A player playing NCAA ball need not ever play in the NBA to have a long (and very financially lucrative) professional basketball career.    In any event, I feel the comparison is actually a great one."

Often departments will only offer funding for four years, and then you have to apply for more funding if you plan to take longer."

My solution is to drink even more coffee, curse at myself, and grab a legal pad and begin writing stream-of-consciousness nonsense until I realize I'm writing something relevant. I then continue to write until it goes back to nonsense. At that point, I type it up, find the proper citations, and drop it in the relevant thesis chapter Word document.  I'm going through tons of legal pads, but it's the only thing that gets me through the drafting phase."

When I was sick I felt like I couldn't do anything. But, I found out I felt lethargic and lazy because also my body was going through trauma to fight an infection or two off. So, after feeling cured and refreshed, I kind of ""forgot"" what that depression/lack of motivation felt like. I also will just write write write any random stuff, just to get the juices flowing.

I have felt like I was struggling in a similar way as this for the past two years or so. But I realized very recently actually, that nothing would change unless I changed. So I've started making sure I exercise every day and sleep every night, which is a must for me at least, but I'm sure could help you concentrate and feel more positive during your days. I've also started listening to self help audiobooks, one in particular has really helped me called ""The Practicing Mind"" by Thomas Sterner. It discusses how to bring yourself top the present moment, and how to persevere through difficult processes during your life (author makes most analogies to learning music but it all applied to grad school as well for me).   Idk if these things can help you, but this has pulled me up from depression and mild bipolar disorder. I also seek counseling when I feel I need it. Grad school sucks, but you need to remember who you are and what you need in order to be happy and succeed. When you focus on making yourself happy/healthy, everything else just kind of comes along with it. I hope things can work out for you."

Personally, I feel like grad school takes over my life 24/7 and that the constant worries are sometimes offsetting the joy I find in the work I choose that is ""supposed to be stimulating"". There is flexibility, but also a LONG laundry list of things that always need to be done. The constant stress erodes the joy. And sometimes the flexibility is a burden, because I can work from home. Now, at home, all I think about is grad work work work."

GradSchool,3b2lwh,sepehrhm,7,Fri Jun 26 12:18:28 2015 UTC,"Schedule an appointment with a counselor. Your school may have a counseling center you could go to. Try to get in some strenuous exercise if you are able. Work on trying to identify when you are feeling badly about things and determining, without passing judgment, whether your reactions to these moments are constructive. The more you understand about the way you respond to these moments, you will be better able to take control. There are no guarantees with this approach, but I have found it useful."
GradSchool,3b2lwh,fourier_loko,6,Thu Jun 25 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed, when I was struggling with these days I started going to weekly counseling appointments (free for students) and started attending the gym daily (also free for students).   The gym was an hour each day where I could focus on anything else guilt-free and the counselor was amazing just to help me talk through worries."
GradSchool,3b2lwh,breezy727,2,Thu Jun 25 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. I met with someone who was also to help me understand why I feel unmotivated, and help give me daily tasks to increase my confidence. My problem was never feeling accomplished/happy because the journey is several years long in grad school. Now, I have daily goals that I see an end result for very quickly, to give me motivation to complete my other tasks. Like, make a nice meal, fancy. That's something I can ACTUALLY SEE myself start and finish, and feel proud that I can at least finish SOMETHING in my life."

I'm not much of a fan of where I live, so whenever I go on travel (Which I just did) when I come back I get that flattening feeling of ""fuck... I hate this place and everyone in it"" and I can't bring myself to accomplish much.   A HUGE thing that helps me is to diversify my work. Right now I can't get in and look at my code for some reason - it feels impossible. So instead I've taken to studying for our big qual exam. If that failed, I'd maybe go try to fix a couple things in my lab.   And sometimes this doesn't work, like when you've really gotta finish your thesis, like, yesterday. But it can be used so your life isn't 100% ""omg I can't do anything right now."""

GradSchool,3b2lwh,maverickmonk,3,Thu Jun 25 17:23:48 2015 UTC,I used to have a ton of advice for this. But my advice has been failing me for the past month. Grad school sucks sometimes.

Sometimes I'm upset and sad, sometimes I just want to do something else (youtube, reddit, nothing).   I was suppose to get some work done today, it was a totally reasonable goal I set up for myself too. Was going to send it to my prof for review. Well guess what happened. Nothing.   Didn't exercise, didn't do anything fun.   At least I'm not alone?"
GradSchool,3b2lwh,gradmourning,3,Fri Jun 26 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"I go home. Really, truly. If this is happening every single day, then obviously this isn't the best route, but if it's occasional? Yeah, get out of the building and do something else. Generally I go back to my apartment and get some house work done like cleaning/gardening. Or I just read a personal book. Or work on personal writing. Or take a nap. Practice guitar. Play video games. Anything that has nothing to do with chemistry and grad school.  Grad school is not a sprint, it's a marathon. No need to whip yourself by sitting at your desk not being able to do anything. The occasional day out of the building won't slow you down. In fact, I'd argue that since it's helpful for mental health, it'll speed you up because on the other days when you do go in, you're more likely to be productive."
GradSchool,3b2lwh,SuperBeastJ,3,Thu Jun 25 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"One of the best pieces of advice I was given was to sit down and write a single sentence a day.  Some days you may end up writing way more, but others you may only get through a single hard sentence. At least then you made forward progress. Some days after that sentence you have to just decide that the day isn't real, and it's time to have a beer and take a nap.   Forcing yourself to work on those really unmotivated or unproductive days isn't going to do you any favors and you will just get more frustrated. Which is another important piece of advice someone taught me, it's ok to take a breather."

GradSchool,3b2lwh,Kelreth,2,Thu Jun 25 17:10:38 2015 UTC,Go for a run or something else physical that takes your mind totally off of work.  The brain fatigues much like the rest of your body does. You need to rest it periodically if you're going to get stuff done.
GradSchool,3b2lwh,tchomptchomp,2,Thu Jun 25 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"Like you, I struggle with anxiety and writers block. My solution is process-based rather than outcome-based. I've developed a routine that works for me, and as long as I stick to my routine, I consider it a success.   For example, I've learned through trial and error that I'm most productive / creative in the morning. If writing is my number one priority, it has to get done before lunch when the demands of daily life become so overwhelming they can no longer be ignored. I block off three hours of time for myself (after I've had my morning coffee) to work. I also know that I work better away from home, so I try to come to the office or a coffee shop. That's the beginning of my process. If I can do those two things, I know I'm off to a great start.  Then I write. I read over what I've been working on. I modify some sentences. I delete a lot of old stuff and replace it. I tinker. I add. I delete. I write a shitty sentence. I leave it for now because I can't think of anything different. I write a note to myself telling me where I need to go. I put stuff like [ADD TRANSITION HERE] or [QUOTE TOMPKINS HERE] and keep moving. At the end of the day, I know I've done a good job if I write two paragraphs. I'm a meticulous, careful writer who works and reworks sentences, so two paragraphs is actually a lot. Most of the time I only write one.  If you're thinking about writing an article, or a dissertation chapter, or a book, writing a single paragraph and calling it a success sounds insane. But if you're committed to the process--if you think what it means to be a good writer is being dedicated to the act of writing, rather than the pages themselves--you'll stop hating yourself for not having thoughts springing from your mind fully forms. And you'll start to see that after a week you have seven new paragraphs. After two weeks you have 14 paragraphs. After a month you have 28.  Writing isn't unlike running a marathon. If you're thinking about the finish line, you'll start to get exhausted. Just believe in your next step and take satisfaction in the small victories. They will add up."

If room-mate does something you don't like, tell them but be reasonable. For example, if room mate is loud at 3 AM, tell them. But if you like to have everything organised in a very specific way, be prepared to compromise. If there are issues and you don't bring them up, room mate will never know and you will build resentment which might eventually culminate in a blow out.   Same as others said, establish chores and other house issues right away as well.   Take the time to have friendly chat with the person, even if you just have time to say hello. Having a room mate can be the best because you always have someone around if you are lonely or stressed, if you just want to have a movie night etc. You might also get a chance to meet other people you wouldn't normally meet = more friends, more experiences."

There are absolutely zero programs that will not require you to learn the language of the field. If you are not willing to learn and push yourself, then grad school is not for you.  Also, looking within yourself is always the answer. You don't go to grad school because someone else was successful and liked it. You go to grad school because it's the right fit for you. Otherwise you're just going to be miserable and hate your life. So you really have to figure out what your end goal is for your career and make a decision based on that.

It is also entirely self-motivated, as most of the work is independent and you won't have someone supervising you to make sure you make progress. You've got to be seriously committed to succeed in grad school, and it doesn't sound like you are.   I agree that looking within yourself is always the answer.

You'll find that in your lab, you're pretty cut off from the ""immaturity"" that undergrads have a reputation for, anyway, regardless of where you end up   The funny thing about ""grad only"" places is that you still TA, it's just for the other grad/med students.

Given how time-intensive school and rotations can be for the first year it's one of those things I where I try to imagine having to TA and it feels like so much imaginary stress. Nothing more relieving than thinking about stress you don't have. Additionally, I think as a result more of the professors generally enjoy teaching too since it's all self-motivated, already achieved students. I haven't had a single professor since I started that acted like it was a drag or they were there bc they had to be, since you're teaching colleagues basically. I wasn't big on school spirit, although I love my alma mater I definitely enjoy it being on the quieter-side here, event-wise. No homecoming, no sports, no clubs, no shenanigans (my undergrad institution did yearly humans vs zombies tag). If college community was an enjoyable part of your undergrad, I'd reconsider a grad-only institute. It's not to say we don't have fun on our own time (our department has labs host and cater a monthly happy hour on a rotating basis) but it's less meeting-people-distributed-all-over-campus fun. (DM me if you wanna know what program I'm in)"
