Your comment about Apple replacing iPhones out of warranty might have happened to a lucky few but their warranty is only a year and after they will charge for repairs just like LG or Google. Sounds to me like they explained this to you via support, then you asked for escalation and the escalation resource told you the same thing, and you kept pressing.

I was within my warranty period, but I wasn't expecting them to replace the phone due to negligence. And this is why I will be purchasing the Nexus 5 2015 when it's released.

Either way, phone is out of warranty, they don't have to do anything. Drops and scratches aren't the only things that can go wrong either.

You could have exposed the phone to moisture just from the humidity in the air, especially if it's in the bathroom while you shower. There are a million things that could have happened to damage the phone that could be out of their hands. AND it could happen to any manufacturer.  However, it might be worth trying to unlock the bootloader and push a factory image to completely reset the software. Factory reset doesn't quite do this, which is a common troubleshooting step."

They're barely using a tiny corner of their box, and even though my box is much smaller, I'm filling the potential.

I have run the device on 5.1.1 with no encryption and with encryption and I didn't notice the difference.

Samsung also doesn't add the same features to all their devices. A lot of extra features also cannot be uninstalled.  If you want a clean version (aka a ""vanilla experience"") of Android the way Google intended, then get a Nexus.  I've been in T-Mobile stores here in the USA and seen Nexus phones. I'm sure Sprint had some Nexus S models on the shelf back in 2011.  The reason you don't see Nexus a whole lot is because you're a Verizon customer. They're the worst carrier for Nexus users. They don't like that Google wants an unlocked device that can be taken to other carriers, and Verizon doesn't care about timely OS updates (one of the biggest selling points of going with a Nexus).

I bet the only reason they carry the N6 is because they do so much business with Motorola already.  And I think most Nexus 6's were bloat-free.

Nexus,3dddsf,Uskglass_,0,Thu Jul 16 02:20:12 2015 UTC,I held my Note 2 up against a Nexus 6 in store. They are basically the same size.
Nexus,3dddsf,Martins2759,3,Fri Jul 17 00:10:51 2015 UTC,This means we'll probably see the LG Nexus 5 (2015) released with Android M and an 808 or 810 2.1 SoC and this Huawei Nexus 6 will be released later in Q4 or even early Q1 as that's when Qualcomm said we'll see the 820 in the wild.
Nexus,3dddsf,Uskglass_,3,Wed Jul 15 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"That would make the benchmark rumors fake... Because the only thing able to get that kind of score is the 820...   Android M comes out in Q3. We'll see a new Nexus in Late August/September being announced along with it. I just hope the two phones come out at the same time, and not one at a time..."
Nexus,3dddsf,DodneyRangerfield,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:53:09 2015 UTC,Those benchmark rumors are definitely fake (naming scheme alone might be a giveaway) but even if they were real there are other non-Qualcomm possibilities. People are saying Intel (like the Nexus player) or maybe a new Tegra.
Nexus,3dddsf,teamhoun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"808 is a fine choice for the Nexus 5 since it would work much better at a (comparatively) low price. Snapdragon 808, 3GB RAM, 1080p at 5"", 2700mah or a bit more, decent camera and about $300 for the 16GB would be juuuuust fine."
Nexus,3dddsf,DodneyRangerfield,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:52:56 2015 UTC,"The 810 has significantly better graphics power and is still a more powerful processor until it begins throttling. Unless you're performing very cpu-intensive tasks, the 810 is a better choice"
Nexus,3dddsf,RainBTC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:06:30 2015 UTC,"No doubt on that, but i'd still rather have an 808 and a very good price than an 810/820 and a higher price point. If there's anything they should allocate a bigger part of the budget to it's the battery and camera, performance increases now make a smaller impact on the user experience than those two. If you want a phone with top of the line performance, battery life and camera it's not going to be $300-350, let the Nexus 6 (2015) handle that area."

Nexus,3dd4r8,spidahkillah,11,Wed Jul 15 09:42:34 2015 UTC,Happened to me a couple of times too when it goes into battery saver mode. It mostly happens when you use it really heavily and suddenly stop everything. It anticipates that it is going to last only how long 15% of battery will last but when you shut down everything it starts calculating how long it will work with that and goes up to maybe 20%
Nexus,3dd4r8,Arpit17,9,Wed Jul 15 10:15:12 2015 UTC,"Battery percentage is a huge estimation game, based on the speed you are currently discharging, and it is quite a bit abstracted from the actual battery potential as it decreases. The phone uses its software to turn off at, say, 5%, but 0% according to that scale is probably like 20% actual charge for a lithium ion battery (which would be dead for good if it actually hit 0%).  Just correcting its guess at it moved into low-power-usage states."
Nexus,3dd4r8,connormxy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:43:26 2015 UTC,"It judges battery life based on voltage. While the device is under a heavy load, the voltage is pulled down. If it suddenly goes to a little to no load state, like it would when idle, the battery voltage will recover a little bit, making it look like exactly like that. It didn't recover anywhere near to the level it was at before the drain, but it really is just basic physics. See this for some basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8hTQXqURB4"

Nexus,3d8dcj,ThinkBEFOREUPost,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:36 2015 UTC,Yup.  There is a Project Fi app that runs on the phone and probably abstracts all the radios to do the handoffs.  It's how this tech should just work when companies aren't trying to protect their invested networks.

Nexus,3cxsiz,SuperNanoCat,3,Sun Jul 12 05:09:22 2015 UTC,The difference in battery life will be almost unmeasurable by doing this. The screen still has to light up the same pixels and the GPU still runs.   You would be better off downclocking or something.  At any rate you shouldn't be having battery issue sin the first place.

I do have to charge the phone during the day to get me from 7am to 10pm (I usually charge for a little bit when I get home around 530)  Which is why i was wondering if it grabs an extra hour or two I could probably make it through the day on one charge. But if it's relatively negligee say less than 30min in testing I wouldn't care.   I use it a decent amount not a power user but I'd say moderate/heavy versus moderate or low usage.

If you grab a used N5 or wait for the 2015 model, it'd be a simpler transition for your hands.

Nexus,3cnhe9,Schumarker,3,Thu Jul 9 07:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile so bear with me for any typos and the layout.   I've had a nexus 9 since release, I've had it rooted since it was available and I also had dirty unicorn as my ROM for a while. In all honesty the N9 is not a disappointing tablet but it is not an amazing tablet either. I haven't been blown away by its performances but it works.   I'm currently on 5.1.1 rooted and performances right now are decent (there are probably snappier ROMs out there but I've decided to go back to stock for a while).   As to the form factor, I personally love it. It's really easy to read on the N9 in portrait mode. I personally don't watch videos on my tablet, but I read a lot of comics and it offers a really good reading experience.   I can't say anything about the N7 since I never owned one but I'm sure someone else will help you.   I'm honestly on the fence about whether or not I'd recommend the N9. Looking back, it certainly didn't warrant the price I paid at release, and at times,  I think I might have been better off with an ipad.   I'm not sure if this is really helpful or if this is going to help you make your mind, but here's my two cents."

I also had both generations of the Nexus 7 tablet. When my 5 ended up with horrible battery life,  I was bummed that the only Nexus I could replace it with Wasson enormous.  And on top of that my 2013 N7 was ridiculously laggy,  even running KitKat.   After tireless research, and a number of forms both on Reddit and XDA recommending the Xperia line, I replace my mobile with a Z3c. After replacing the slightly dated looking user interface with Nova Launcher, I quickly fell in love with the small form factor, awesome camera, and even better battery life. I invested in a handful of magnetic charges so that I could keep all my ports closed all the time. I've since replaced my Nexus 7 with the Xperia tablet, which addresses your requirement for something smaller than the Nexus 9. It also provides a slim form factor and a very speedy processor. Not to mention both of the units are also shock proof and waterproof. Unless Google comes out with a smaller Nexus Mobile this year, I'll be sticking with a new Sony Xperia come September or November. Sony's being excellent at keeping all the devices up to date in terms of software, and providing roms through their own site.  Just some food for thought"

While the Moto x is definitely a decent phone, it's much too late in the game to pick it up for the long haul.   While I wasn't super upset about the Lollipop delay,  it leads me to believe that any more updates may not be very likely (probably due to the customised chip for the 1st Gen.)   the camera is subpar,  battery is nothing to write home about and up until Lollipop I've found it easy to cause the phone to lag.   I have the xt 1053 and it does NOT support LTE.      Before you disdain other phones due to their size,  spend some serious time with the 5inchers.

I assume coming from a Nexus you would be looking for an unlocked Moto X, which is what I wish I would have done so I wouldn't have to wait longer for the 5.1 update.  It gets decent battery life, about a day usually. Moto voice and active display are huge pros and honestly keeps me from moving to any other phone. Many complained about the camera when it first came out, after many updates for the camera it is pretty decent (it is not on par with the G4 and S6 camera though). Also the Moto X fits very nicely in the hand and it's never been a problem for me to reach any portion of the the screen. The performance has for the most part always been quick and snappy, just a couple lags or freezes occasionally. Not a big deal though. If there are any other questions feel free to ask."

Nexus,3ae7hk,Herp_derpelson,2,Fri Jun 19 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware of this. It's just that they break more easily than a standard glass screen, and break where a standard glass screen doesn't. It's because glass screens are often shielded by the phone's bevel so that any ""corners"" which are weak points where force isn't spread are protected. Since the glass protector sits on top of the regular glass, their corners are out there in the open.

Unless you live at the beach, or for some other reason regularly have sand in your pocket, the chances of scratching your phone screen are virtually nonexistent.   As for shatters, it doesn't really make sense that a screen protector would do much for those, and a bit of googling had plenty of stories confirming. Corner impacts and flat screen impacts, the most likely causes of shattering, would both be avoided better by putting a big ugly thick case on the phone."

Nexus,3a57j0,JerryCronus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of a conspiracy nut anyway. Well...depends how you define the term actually. When someone makes a claim, my first response is usually to look for supporting evidence of that claim. To most people, that makes me a conspiracy theorist. Example: Some guy says something on CNN. Me: ""That's a pretty big claim - it'd be nice to have a source for that."" Everyone else: ""Bro you need some tinfoil?""  Anyway, I always got this weird feeling about the Nexus 6. Built in encryption is a nice feature, don't get me wrong. But I always found it weird that the Nexus 6 purportedly has a dedicated encryption chip, however the OS sends encryption tasks to the CPU anyway. And this is still the case after 3 iterations of Android so far on the 6. And I don't think it's that Android as an OS can't deal with dedicated encryption chips - I've seen nothing to suggest that that's the case. So why not use the dedicated chip?  Anyway, I still bought it and love it. Any kind of action that requires reading and/or writing to storage makes the phone heat up to above normal and kills the battery though. See, storage on the 6 is encrypted by default (you can unencrypt it if you root and wipe your phone), so any read/write task needs to interact with encryption. Which puts a lot of load on the CPU.   Anyway, sorry for the rant. In this messed up head of mine, when I started this comment, I thought that maybe there was some relation to Huawei's hardware backdoors and the fact that Google won't use the dedicated encryption tech in the Nexus 6. I'm not sure what I was thinking. Move along."

If it's overheating, make sure to check for bulges. Backup, because one way or another, you're going to wind up switching phones or clearing all of the memory. Master reset first if it's not a heat issue. You can go through and uninstall all recent apps first, but get started on always being backed up. Always saves you heartbreak.

The first gen Moto X has had all kinds of delays getting Lollipop - even if you buy that Motorola won't send out the updates due to memory leak issues, at least with a Nexus device you have the development community to fall back on to give you choice or have custom roms to fix any issues with stock. That's why I got a Nexus 5 and why I won't consider anything that's not a Nexus at this point.  Plus with Nexus devices you get quick updates much, much longer then any other devices. Things to keep in mind now that the increases in smart phones year to year are becoming less significant and it's more reasonable to hold onto a phone for 2 or 3 years."

Are you updating through WiFi with enough battery/phone on charger?"
Nexus,38c4o6,Hotsolce,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:37:57 2015 UTC,It's the root. As of lollipop Ota updates check your system before updating if anything has changed it doesn't go ahead. This is in case someone has messed with your security. Best bet is to unroot and rest your system back to normal (factory image flash with out changing recovery) then Ota update (you might loose unlock no idea) and flash your modified recovery and root again
Nexus,38c4o6,Kyoraki,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:40:54 2015 UTC,I've the same problem as OP with my O2 OTA for 5.1.1. Will this process wipe any data at all?
Nexus,38c4o6,Hotsolce,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:54:57 2015 UTC,Only if you have to unlock again using the oem unlock command. Or if you flash using the -w operator. Otherwise should be good. Always best to make a nandroid back up or use titanium backup and store them off device before you begin
Nexus,38c4o6,Kyoraki,2,Wed Jun 3 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"So, I had some time on my hands this evening and tried out your method. Turns out there's a few steps you can skip. What I did was backup everything to hell and back, and for the hell of it downloaded a stock as stock can get rom with root, busybox, and nothing else, and flashed it with TWRP.   Wiped the cache, rebooted, and crossed my fingers. Turns out it's worked flawlessly. I even still get that 'O2 App Space' thing in the play store! Take that, unreliable OTA system."
Nexus,38c4o6,Hotsolce,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:01:51 2015 UTC,That's certainly one way to do it! As long as you don't wipe data and you're generally okay. But if you run into issues id suggest you reset it (wipe data) and then use titanium backup to get you the essentials back

Yes, the phone cost slightly more than a comparable android device, which I also considered when replacing my N5. What I think offsets or negates this cost difference is that iPhones hold their resale value better than similarly priced Android phones.

Nexus,37ul73,PantlessKitten,3,Mon Jun 1 12:28:10 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly have a solution, but since he didn't clarify:       When you say install factory images are you saying for me to go back to Kitkat?   Nope. Think of them as Windows install DVDs, except it's Android for your phone. They're, well, images and not installers, but you get the point. You can install any version available directly, including 5.1.1. Factory images for Nexus devices are found here: https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images       Already been on XDA and basically they give crazy instructions for completely wiping or side loading.    Because they're the only two options. You can either install the whole system from scratch (this requires you to unlock your bootloader, which will wipe the device) or sideload the update (not sure if it wipes it or not, I haven't done this one yet), there's no other way around it AFAIK.   If you're not comfortable doing it yourself, you can either have someone else do it for you or wait to see what Google tells you. Unless they have an unheard of of trick up their sleeves, chances are they'll ask you to send your phone and either flash the factory image or sideload the update (most likely the former).        crazy instructions   The instructions / commands do seem intimidating at first, I'll give you that. Out of curiosity, I'll break them down for you (without being too specific about it). Worst case scenario you get an idea of how it works, best case scenario you feel confident enough to do it yourself. Hopefully they won't seem that scary.       First two steps are a preparation thing and are pretty straightforward:     Download the OTA update or Factory Image  (obvious, just make sure you download the one for your device) Enable USB debugging on the phone  (so that it accepts commands from your computer)       Third one is the only tricky one IMHO, depends on the system, but it's a one time thing and it's done on the computer:     Install ADB  (you'll know when it's working because running adb devices while your phone is plugged into the computer with USB debugging on, that command will list your phone)      Fourth is rebooting your phone into the bootloader / fastboot mode, the mode in which the phone accepts that kind of ""low level"" commands.    Turn it on by pressing Power+VolUp (or the other way around). (You'll definitively know if this works because instead of booting normally, it'll show the Android robot and a bit of text)       All that's left to do now is running the actual sideload / factory image flash commands.    Sideloading:     Run adb sideload <filename of update.zip> from your computer   Flashing factory image:    Run fastboot oem unlock to unlock the bootloader (wipes the device, if the device already has the bootloader unlocked you can skip this step. Either way, I can't recall but the phone may reboot at this point. If it does, let it do so and then put it back on bootloader / fastboot mode)   Run the respective flash-all script (it's in the factory image file downloaded)         By this point texts shows on the screen, then the phone boots, seems to be stuck at the 3 colors loading screen, you panic, maybe write a couple posts on Reddit about it, then finally the damn thing starts and you crack a beer to commemorate."
Nexus,37ul73,PantlessKitten,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome thank you. I did find a website here http://www.droid-life.com/2013/02/12/guide-how-to-use-adb-sideload-to-update-a-nexus-without-root-or-custom-recovery/  I should be able to easily handle this now that I know what the steps are but reading forums on XDA sometimes are intimidating and the steps are not that specific.  My only question is, am I supposed to download the OTA 5.1.1 file  on my PC then? The steps that follow seem easy enough and I have been in recovery mode before."
Nexus,37ul73,PantlessKitten,2,Wed Jun 3 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"My only question is, am I supposed to download the OTA 5.1.1 file on my PC then?   Exactly. Running the sideload command pushes the update file from the PC to the tablet (and then the tablet does its thing with it).   Download it to your PC, put it on your desktop, rename it to ""update.zip"" (just to make it easier). Then when you get to the step in which you run the sideload command, simply navigate to the desktop using the Terminal/Command Prompt and run adb sideload update.zip.       In case you can't navigate using Terminal/Command Prompt:     OSX: cd ~/Desktop/ Windows: cd c:/Users/<your_username>/Desktop/ (IIRC)       Make sure you find the right one though, there are different OTA updates for the WiFi and LTE versions. I found some here for upgrading from ""LRX22L"" (you can check your current Build in ""Settings > About phone > Build number).           If it gives you any piece of mind, your tablet won't be touched until you get the adb sideload command to actually run. Since this will be the only command that'll try to change things in the device, don't bother worrying until you get to this one (and it actually runs without spitting an error right away).   After that, if something goes wrong (sometimes it happens), just go through /r/Nexus9 and see how other people fixed the issue."

I can hold my own with this stuff but for a first time go around I need it listed step by step so I make no assumptions or mistakes.  I will be attempting this later today hopefully and hopefully with success.  I do feel bad for anyone who is not capable of doing this sideload method because there is no solution as of right now for this error downloading the OTA on your device."

Nexus,37ul73,vhexs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"thanks unfortunately for me it seems to not want to work.  I have gotten into recovery to  apply the update from the adb and it loads to 47% and then says ""system partition has unexpected contents"" then says ""Error in sideload/package.zip status 7""  Apparently this is an issue and there are multiple possible solutions but anything I looked up about possible reasons why it would do this do not apply to me. I did wipe the partition cache to try and resolve this issue and I am thinking this might be the reason why I am getting this error.  Now it seems like the only way to fix is to flash it again with 5.0.2 or something which i refuse to do. I have found numerous posts on the forums indicating people with the exact issue I have trying to update. This is a google issue and they better fix this because this is getting ridiculous.  Luckily my tablet keeps booting up in 5.0.2 and works but it really is unacceptable to have this happen. I will again reach out to google one more time to see if they are working on a fix and I might consider selling my tablet if it never gets fixed which is sad because I love the nexus line."
Nexus,37ul73,eddied96,2,Wed Jun 3 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"That sucks. Is/was the tablet rooted?   If you end up flashing the factory image, you may as well flash 5.1.1 directly bypassing the OTA update completely. That's how I've been updating my N5 (ever since 5.0), except I dirty flash (by removing the -w flag from one of flash-all's commands) as not to lose any user data (I keep the bootloader unlocked).   I've never tried sideloading before simply because I can't do it. (It's rooted, it'd fail with that particular error message)"

Don't get me wrong, I love almost everything about my Nexus 6, and it does take great photos, but it is slow.  Edit: On the other points, battery life can vary depending on your usage, but generally it's pretty good, and I don't usually have issues getting through a whole day unless I really push it.

Not an issue for everyday users, but I take lots of spontaneous photos of fast moving subjects as a part of my job, and having a fast camera can make a big difference. In my personal experience, the iPhone comes out on top.  Anyway, also in my experience, my Nexus 6 is significantly slower than my M8. It's great for casual photography, and I understand that most people don't require a lighting fast camera, but to answer the question at hand, it's definitely not as fast as an iPhone."
Nexus,369mkt,vegimate,2,Wed May 20 00:48:29 2015 UTC,"Usually get 16-24 hours of time between charges,  and that's in an area with horrid cell service. Not sure why but I rarely get more than 4 hours screen on time.   Camera is OK.  It's better than most reviews say, but it's no iPhone camera. The pictures it takes, when you line them up, are good,  and you can get some decent ones with other camera apps.  The Nexus 6 is one of the few android phones that is supporting the camera2 APIs that came out with lollipop.  This means that camera apps that take advantage of these APIs can have access to way more,  like shutter speed,  iso, exposure,  etc.  So if you do get the Nexus 6,  you can pick up Manuel Camera from the play store to round out your photo taking."

I've avoid the boot loop problem by manually controlling the memory. Every time I drop to 100 or less, I get the boot loop, so as long as I can keep it 300MB+, it's fine for me. Some people don't have memory leak for some reason, but I, unfortunately do.   I was fine 5.0.1 and didn't need any of those programs, but the memory leak problem is huge on 5.1 for me."
Nexus,368vi7,Innovative_Wombat,1 point,Wed May 20 07:16:44 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of any boot loop from the memory leak issue and most people say it's gotten much better in 5.1 (as it has for me). Are you sure your ROM/addons are working as they should ?  In any case, the memory leak issue (the ""classic"" one where memory doesn't get released and the phone is sluggish) can't be helped by any ram/task manager as the underlying mechanism seems to be broken."

This one appears to be 5.1 centric and manually clearing the RAM and closing programs does free up the memory. I've avoided the boot loop by keeping memory at a high level, it's annoying, but it works. I can replicate the boot loop by running down my memory, that's how I know it's the memory leak problem. The system doesn't free up the memory automatically and thus runs out and bam, boot loop."

It seems that it currently works ONLY for people you texted (only through the messenger app).
Nexus,35y40b,zzisrafelzz,3,Thu May 14 18:52:17 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem to change the color of the contact though. If I go into the person's contacts it's still the original color

I'd definitely recommend it.   In my eyes, the nexus 5 and the 6 are two different phones in their own respects. The 5 is convenient and more compact whereas the 6 is bulkier and more luxurious (look at the price difference.) Aside from a few minor things, there isn't anything the nexus 5 can't do that the nexus 6 can. Sure, some of the hardware may be better but with the amount of developers still working behind the n5 the possibilities are really endless.

It's a great phone now. It's fast, R/W speeds are much much better, and overall performance is top notch. Benchmarks are now finally superb - it just took a while to get there.  The curved back is a double edged sword - yes, you can't really type on it when it's flat, but it's so much better to hold in your hand - so it all depends on what is more important to you - typing when it's laying flat or when you're actually holding it.

The graininess is in all S4 generation panels which is a ducking joke that a phone such as the Nexus 6 is stuck with an old ass panel with graininess. This has been my complaint of AMOLED panels since I had the Note 3, until the Note 4 generation panels fixed that. The graininess is hard to explain which is why you don't think you see it. Go on an all white page and start scrolling on medium brightness. Compare the screen to an LCD and you will know it is NOT the same. I wish I could show you a comparison but that means me going to a store and doing it."

Google already has a working version of what they showed off at IO last year because, well, they showed it off on stage. I'm upset because the product they release to the consumer is a different product than what they advertise at IO. In contrast with Apple, which releases the same product to the consumer that they show off on stage at the WWDC.  So in Google's case, it's not like they don't have the ability to release a product at 100% of spec, because they already have it when they go to IO, they just scale back the consumer version, and, to a certain extent, hobble it with inconsistencies (like different pull out menus for each of their own apps). It's like this:   If I, as a tech worker, go from 0% to 60%, release that, then start working on a new project, then, like, whatever (which is what you're describing). What google is doing is going from 0% to say, 90%, scaling back to 60%, releasing that to the consumer, then abandoning everything and moving on to the next iteration."

But sms is completely different.  One weird thing that happened when trying to fix this is I literally went through every texting app and it didn't fix it. Everyone of them was still having problems. I usually use textra as I like the ui, so I remade it my default. Went to settings and turned on the setting to turn off wifi when I get a mms. Then ten minutes later I got a mms in a group message, it detached from the wifi and the mms came through. THEN the wierd thing happened, every message that had not come through to me came in!!! Over 40 messages, and the ones that my phone could not send went through. The thing is these messages were not mms, but simple sms, so they should have no bearing on whether wifi is enabled or not?? Really not sure what is going on, but I have left my wifi off for the time being, and it seems to be working. It is very hard though to tell if my messages are actually going through or if I am getting them because I have to compare the phones of the sender and the reciever irl  tl;dr mms & sms not working, turning on textra no wifi mms may fix it? but shouldn't affect sms but somehow does, something is wrong  EDIT: as of right now I did some googling and this thread popped up, https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/2977wb/are_any_other_tmobile_nexus_users_experiencing/  Im going to try this, let you know if it works"

Nexus,34wd49,BinaryNexus,11,Tue May 5 02:36:39 2015 UTC,I love my Nexus 6. Yes it is a bit big for some people but so far everything is solid.
Nexus,34wd49,ad895,10,Tue May 5 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"Reposting one of my old replies to a similar thread:  I came from a One M8 and a Nexus 5 before that. When I first bought my Nexus 6, I took it out of the box and immediately felt buyers regret. I thought it was way too big and cumbersome and wished I had never bought it.  I never expected to turn so quickly, but within about 2 or 3 days, I had completely changed my mind. I got used to using it with two hands, and figured out the right ways to hold it for one handed use aswell. It felt really natural it no time at all.  Now I don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to a smaller size, and even a 5"" screen feels as tiny as the iPhone used to feel to me. The extra screen real estate is great, and makes browsing and watching media so much more comfortable.  I even have a thick, Otterbox style protective case on it while I'm at work during the week, and when I take it off (on weekends) I'm always pleasantly surprised by how small it feels to me now.  Anyway, don't be put off by its size, its an excellent phone, and it will feel natural in no time. :)  P.S. The speakers are awesome, even coming from a One M8, they are SUPER loud, and my favourite feature!"

I didnt want the size, but it grew very quickly on me. Yeah, a pain to carry, but I refuse to use anything smaller now."
Nexus,34wd49,dark79,2,Wed May 13 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"You'll love the better camera, the front speakers, and longer battery life (usually). That said, i've had mine since launch and I still don't like the size, rounded back, and lack of notification LED. It also took me 4 exchanges to get one that didn't have screen uniformity issues (pink tint on part of the screen).   Currently I'm back on my N5 though because the N6 is constantly disconnecting/connecting to WiFI all day, slaughtering my battery and nothing (including clean flashing and running only stock apps for the day) has fixed it. I honestly prefer the N5 over the N6, but the pros I listed above make it hard to get rid of the N6. I'll probably RMA and hope the replacement doesn't have the same issue or I'll definitely sell it on swappa.  I personally don't find the N6 to be $250 more premium than the N5 or whatever nonsense people say to rationalize the huge price increase from the N5 to the N6. But, if you're getting it for no additional cost, I'd just give it a shot and if you don't like it, you can easily sell it off for more than buying another N5 would cost."

Now, if the case is that they're charging you $200 they wouldn't have if they had sent you a N5, then I don't think I could justify keeping it for the reason I mentioned above.

Nexus,34wd49,EricPlasencia,1 point,Wed May 6 02:02:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't clarify. It's not available through T-Mobile subsidized. So it wouldn't be financially worth it to get one because I can't upgrade into one. You know?
Nexus,34wd49,ExpAwesome,2,Wed May 6 02:56:39 2015 UTC,Um. Nothing is available through T-Mobile subsidize. They don't subsidize. They just break the cost into 24 payments. Which you can do through Motorola's website
Nexus,34wd49,EricPlasencia,0,Wed May 6 03:26:32 2015 UTC,You know what I mean FFS. That phone isn't available through T-Mobile. So I can't upgrade to it.
Nexus,34wd49,EricPlasencia,1 point,Wed May 6 10:41:17 2015 UTC,What is the difference? There is no difference. Whether you get one from their store or a Chinese drug dealer it still works on their network and you still pay full price.  I guess I'm confused what you consider the benefit of an upgrade
Nexus,34wd49,EricPlasencia,1 point,Wed May 6 12:45:22 2015 UTC,"A big difference is the ability to get the phone on a payment plan split over 24 months with the option to return it after 6 months. It's all about how you pay. A lot of people including me don't want to pay the full phone price especially when you're a tech head who wants the latest hardware every year.   Option A for buying phone: Pay under $50 in taxes and $27/month after for the phone.   Option B: Pay $700 up front.   Furthermore, since I'm already in T-Mobile jump there are only a few ways to get out and buy an unlocked phone from a third party.   One option is, buy out the $450 I owe on my iPhone in full then buy the third party phone for its full price. I could then try and sell the iPhone or whatever.   The other option which is easier is to upgrade into a super cheap phone to buy out like a lumia 635 or something that only costs like $150 to buy out."
Nexus,34wd49,EricPlasencia,1 point,Wed May 6 13:50:54 2015 UTC,"The jump program is just a credit card that keeps you locked into the jump program.  Sell phone on craigslist. Meet person at T-Mobile store so you can pay it off in front of them with the money they just gave you.  Use payment plan from Motorola or just a credit card. Whatever.  Buy new phone. Pay whatever you want every month. When you want a new phone sell it and pay off your credit with the money, rinse and repeat."
Nexus,34wd49,WhatWasWhatAbout,2,Wed May 6 14:12:37 2015 UTC,I am a former android nerd who spent years flashing Roms and kernels on a daily basis. I'm kinda worn out by that now.   I just want to buy a phone and have it work perfectly out of the box. I know the nexus 6 could do that but the form factor is large. I'm hoping they release a new nexus 5 or 5.5 with good battery life out of the box to switch back to android.
Nexus,34wd49,eeeeVeeee,1 point,Tue May 5 14:22:41 2015 UTC,To each his own.   Honestly I like each platform for their own reasons. The main reason I stay hooked on iOS is for iMessage. Every single one of my friends is on it and it works great. Sms and mms especially with groups doesn't work well between iPhones and android.   Another reason I stay with iPhone now is the great build. It's slim metal and sexy with killer battery life.
Nexus,34wd49,Steve0mac,1 point,Tue May 5 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"The only android phone that I like in the physical sense is the oneplus one. It has a very minimal design which is imperative. The only knock I have is that it isn't available in aluminum the way the iPhone is but that would of course raise the cost and complicate manufacturing.   I find a lot of android phones tend to have massive hideous branding scarring their faces. The G4 for instance has this stupid LG logo up front for no reason.   What I like about iMessage is first and foremost the fact that everybody I know is on it already. Literally everyone I know with the exception of maybe two people that I don't speak to that commonly. So there is almost nobody I can't reach on iMessage.   Functionality-wise, the group messaging is rock solid. Messages, photos and videos are all sent quickly and consistently. Often on sms with my android phones like my Note 3 before this, mms messages would not send or they would not be viewable on my friends iPhones.   The worst issue was that if I am included in a group message, my replies to the group are sent not to their group thread but instead they are sent individually to each user as separate texts. This happens to this day without fail.   I love how well iMessage manages groups. It aggregates photo history, you can share locations easily, mute specific threads and more.   I'm not saying that this stuff isn't available on Android. I know hangouts is arguably as good a service. It may very well be better. The same goes for other messaging services like Facebook messenger, bbm and what's app. But the problem with those services are that nobody I know uses them and it is impossible to convince one or two of them to switch over let alone all of them. That's just the way it is. If all my friends and family were already using hangouts as their Main service, it would be an easier move to android because like I said, I already love android software."
Nexus,34wd49,WhatWasWhatAbout,1 point,Tue May 5 15:22:04 2015 UTC,The problem is on the iPhone side. The group users all receive the response as individual texts. The android user has no problem responding.   This happens without fail 100% of the time.

Either wait about 30 days without using them, or set your system clock back by 30 days, then toggle the options you don't want anymore on and back off again. You may then set your clock back to the normal time.  These are dynamic tiles, and they only show up when your phone thinks you need them. In this case, in Android 5.0, they show up and hang around after you use them once. The system assumes it is something you like to use, and it continues to show them for a month. Go without using them for a month, and it will hide them.  Android 5.1 got an update to this method that allowed you to long press and hide Hot Spot, Inversion, and Auto-Rotate. For all the others, the clock trick I described is the way to remove them.  Edited for grammar."

Nexus,34ao27,xRabidDonutz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:31:30 2015 UTC,I have a s4 on 4.4.4 and this happens to me
Nexus,3462p0,SimMac,23,Tue Apr 28 16:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'm calling it right now. Nexus 5 2015 will be based off the g4 with a non removable back or battery, available in 32 or 64gb, same processor, same camera but moved to the upper right, stock android camera app instead of the lg manual controls, and same screen. Available in red white blue and black starting November 1st. At $399.99-$449.99"
Nexus,3462p0,Aleon909,5,Tue Apr 28 20:45:33 2015 UTC,"This would be my dream phone.  Right now, I just want to upgrade to the G4 but I'm waiting on the eventual iPhone 7 and new Nexus phone(s) announcement. It's hard holding off, but I know the Nexus could be an absolute beast.  If they did go this route, it would be a near perfect phone for me. The only issues I have with the G4 is LG UX instead of stock Android and no Project Fi support. If the reviews all come in the way I think they will, and this phone doesn't have any random issues like overheating or something, then it's going to be the best overall phone of the year to me by a long-shot.  That gorgeous screen, those razor thin bezels, that incredible camera, and that beautiful hardware would be near perfect paired up with stock Android and a service that is, at least to me, a lot cheaper than what most carriers offer.  My only suggestions is that they have front facing speakers. PLEASE. This would be about the only thing I'd miss jumping from the HTC M8, and if you could offer decent front facing speakers then it would be basically be an unstoppable monster phone.  So yeah, I'd love to see this happen. On the other side of it though, I could see something crazy like the Alcatel OneTouch, that is super cheap at 250$ and is getting rave reviews, be a black horse pick for the new Nexus. It looks the part, maybe just bump up some of the internals and camera or something. I definitely wouldn't prefer it, but I could see it happen.  But yeah, I want this to happen. I want the LG Nexus 5 2015 to happen. It needs to happen. Return the king to the thrown. No unrightful heirs or disputes. This is the phone I think we've all been waiting for, and the phone the Nexus brand, Google and Android deserve."
Nexus,3462p0,Izick,3,Wed Apr 29 11:51:20 2015 UTC,Agree with everything you said.  I just want a nexus 5 with tap to wake and that sweet auto focus.  This and to be compatible with the nexus wireless charger.

I would have killed for the Moto X to have been the next Nexus last year.  There was even a mysterious Band 12 model that never came to light.  I wonder if that was it?
Nexus,3462p0,HoustonZ33,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:56:40 2015 UTC,I'll never be able to buy a new flagship in the foreseeable future due to this. :(
Nexus,3462p0,Ceiryus,2,Wed Apr 29 08:45:50 2015 UTC,Quite possible since Google upped their game in material choices in the last iteration of Nexus' devices. I'm not sure if the G3 is simplistic enough looking for a Nexus line.
Nexus,3462p0,teamhoun,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"Of course google would adapt it, like it did already with the Nexus 4 (LG Optimus G) and the Nexus 5 (LG G2). btw, I think your ""G3"" is a typo, isn't it?"

Nexus,3462p0,Izick,-4,Sun May 17 00:34:02 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer a Samsung nexus. Qualcomm dropped the ball this generation and Samsung has been doing a really great job with design this time around.  Edit: The S6 has the best display tech, and currently the best processors. The G4 is better designed but I'd rather have a Samsung AMOLED and Exynos than a G4 body"
Nexus,3462p0,GrayBoltWolf,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"I hope not either. Would definitely prefer the G4. It looks way more interesting to me than the S6, after using the latter. The S6 only comes off to me as a good upgrade because of how behind Samsung was in materials with the S5, and arguably the S4 even.  I'm waiting on reviews, but I expect the G4 to have the better screen and camera, and I like their materials and the look better than Samsung making a glossy S5 on the front, iPhone 6 on the sides and gaudy iPhone 4S lookalike from the back."
Nexus,3462p0,teamhoun,0,Wed Apr 29 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"I think the G4 looks better, but I'd prefer an AMOLED panel and an Exynos processor to their design. The AMOLED screen will still look better than the G4's display. Even the best LCD panels don't have the deep blacks that AMOLED panels do. The G4 display has excellent calibration, but Samsung displays do pretty well in this regard, and the current generation of AMOLED displays uses very little power. The Exynos 7420 is an absolutely incredible processor, and it easily bests any offerings from Qualcomm or MediaTek. The G4 might have a slightly better camera, and arguably better design, but I think Samsung beats the G4 where it really matters."
Nexus,3462p0,GrayBoltWolf,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:16:24 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily agree, I think thr color calibration and brightness will make the G4 the better screen but hey different strokes.  The only thing I like about the Galaxy S6, from the time I've used it and from what I've seen from the G4, is the fingerprint button. I'd like a Nexus to have one because then Google would make it like a base thing and possibly push it more. It's one of the main draws of an iPhone to me since no major new Android flagships have it yet beside the standard S6/Edge, which I personally have no interest in.  The material and physical design of a phone is important to me, so I'm still hoping the new Nexus is the G4."

Nexus,346tqc,Lucosis,5,Tue Apr 28 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. I think they want to test out the service with the Nexus 6 since they know it's not out their in huge numbers, but will grow a decent amount when Fi launches.  Then in the Fall they'l probably release a new flagship Nexus at a more competitive price, pushing the service hard. Wishful thinking, but I'm really hoping it's a new Nexus 5 based off of the LG G4.  That phone looks nearly perfect to me, so if it has stock Android and maybe front facing speakers too then I couldn't think of a better spearhead device for Fi when they want to make it big this Fall."
Nexus,346tqc,Izick,2,Wed Apr 29 11:58:09 2015 UTC,They're trying it out on the Nexus 6 because it is one of a very few devices that support all the required radio bands.
Nexus,346tqc,Izick,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'd have to think they made it that way with this in mind , even back in late 2015."

Nexus,346tqc,Seeda_Boo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:40:15 2015 UTC,Doesn't google typically go with companies that are struggling instead of the higher end companies? If so they will have to go with another company that lg. which hurts because i love the g series phones and loved my nexus 5.
Nexus,346tqc,littleemp,2,Fri May 1 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"All phones decline in sales, the Nexus 6 isn't unique in this regard. Nexus phones have never been mass appeal devices, thus no sustained blockbuster marketplace. It's six months old but it's still the Nexus flagship device, with no concrete announcement of what's next on that front. A drop in price is not imminent but is on the horizon. Ya gonna wait until whenever (likely late summer/fall) or buy a phone? Current service provider/sellers aren't going to discount them now to effectively put more of them in the hands of customers who will just split the scene for Fi when it comes out."

Nexus,33vmry,REOreddit,7,Sun Apr 26 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"The names reflect screen size (for the most part) so unless they're planning a 7+"" phone (unlikely) they'll most likely use an old name and add the year after it to differentiate (Like they did with the Nexus 7 2013)."

Nexus,33vmry,fleminator,2,Sun Apr 26 01:52:00 2015 UTC,Well if it is true LG us doing it again then maybe the Nexus G. I think it's highly unlikely for them to call a second Nexus 5 when it will look totally different.

Nexus,33qpn1,thederpstinator,-1,Sat Apr 25 15:14:08 2015 UTC,"I loved my Galaxy Nexus but it was time to upgrade. I went in to the Verizon store with full intentions of getting a Nexus 6 until I held it. It was HUGE and cheap feeling. I ended up going with a Galaxy S6 instead and couldn't be happier. Even with a thin case on it, it's sleek, manageable, and feels solid. I hope by the next time I need a new phone Google/Verizon have a better option available because I'd rather have a pure Android phone."
Nexus,33n6n6,bdrrr,9,Thu Apr 23 21:54:51 2015 UTC,I have the Nexus 6 and it seems pretty obvious this was not meant to be a Nexus.  It seems Google quickly negotiated w/ Moto to use their upcoming phablet for a Nexus device once the Android Silver program backfired.

Nexus,33n6n6,Yourothercat,10,Fri Apr 24 13:11:49 2015 UTC,Good. This will hopefully make them revert to smaller form factors once again. The nexus 5 is honestly the PERFECT size for a smart phone.
Nexus,33n6n6,HittingSmoke,5,Thu Apr 23 22:34:47 2015 UTC,I hope they continue with both lines. I loved my Nexus 5 but after moving to a Note 4 (had to go to Verizon for a while) I feel like I'm peeking through a tiny window using the Nexus 5. Went to the N6 recently and it's perfect.
Nexus,33n6n6,Doomfield,3,Thu Apr 23 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"Well the word is they're working with both LG and Huawei, I don't see the point of two devices if you're not doing two form factors. Which is good, because I came around on, and eventually bought, an N6 and love it. I can see it not being for everyone, though."
Nexus,33n6n6,pizzadelivaryguy,0,Thu Apr 23 23:34:58 2015 UTC,"Fully agreed. 5.0"" works perfectly.  I tried the OnePlus One, but it still feels too big, not even okay-ish . I still prefer something like 5.2"" max, such as the Moto X+1, which has a good form factor."
Nexus,33n6n6,Guticb,-1,Thu Apr 23 22:48:19 2015 UTC,5.0 -5.2 is ideal for a 1080p phone. I love my moto x and if the phone gets any bigger than there no point in my having my nvidia shield

Nexus,33n6n6,AndroidPurity,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:26:32 2015 UTC,That's true. It's about 50/50 but it seemed like it was the direction the Nexus Line was moving in up until last November. 2012 Nexus 7 was extremely rushed and it showed. To be honest though the Nexus 9 also doesn't seem that great on quality compared to how much it costs.
Nexus,33n6n6,dzernumbrd,2,Fri Apr 24 17:17:17 2015 UTC,I'm not surprised either. It was thanks to the 5.9 inch screen that kept me from getting one and sure that's probably the main reason for most others too who got a 5 but not a 6. The 9 I think Size isn't as much of an issue since it's a tablet. Just that they priced it like $100 too much.
Nexus,33n6n6,ExpAwesome,2,Sun Apr 26 04:20:28 2015 UTC,"The Nexus 6 is too niche   ...   Good. This will hopefully make them revert to smaller form factors once again.   The only reason I own a Galaxy S6 and instead of a Nexus 6 is that they couldn't get their supply chain in order.  It's nothing to do with form factors.  I wanted a 64GB and wasn't able to buy one for many months after release.  The delay was so long that eventually the S6 was announced and I saw that its camera was going to be better than anything else so I just waited for that.  If they actually had a supply of Nexus 6's then they would have sold a lot more.  As for the Nexus 9, I didn't get one of those for my wife because the reviews of the device were not good."

Looking forward to having twice the coverage plus wifi calling, and my phone bill will be almost half what it is now."
Nexus,33jpkc,Ramacher,2,Thu Apr 23 02:13:25 2015 UTC,I believe you can cancel your service with T-Mobile and stay on the payment plan. But if you default on your payments they will block your phone IMEI #.    My family switched to T-Mobile and I'm the only one that travels frequently. T-Mobile's coverage is atrocious outside of big cities so I canceled my line from the family plan and ported my number over to straight talk with At&t sim. Still using my N5 that I bought with T-Mobile and the payment plan is still with the T-Mobile family plan account.
Nexus,33jpkc,amxn,2,Thu Apr 23 07:43:33 2015 UTC,How much do you pay per month?
Nexus,33jpkc,squatreferee69,2,Thu Apr 23 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"On a family plan. So $10 for a line charge $30 for data, so $40 a month."
Nexus,33jpkc,Blunt_Wizard,2,Thu Apr 23 02:48:00 2015 UTC,"Signed up as well :) for some reason the main sign up page 404'd me? I'm on metropcs, unlimited everything, 60$ a month flat rate, I use around 35 GB a month(once after an injury and I wasn't working I used almost 115 GB in a month), and metro uses T-Mobile towers as well, and where my house is I get 60 MB down and 20 MB up with a ping around 60ms, I might switch if I can properly adjust though, I only use that much data because I never connect to WiFi which I could use 70% of the time which could possibly bring my usage down to less than 10 GB anyway, plus with being able to pause service, or switch your device whenever you want, very appealing"
Nexus,33jpkc,SqueezyCheez85,4,Thu Apr 23 12:41:47 2015 UTC,$10 more than what T-Mobile is offering for 5GB... Isn't it?
Nexus,33jpkc,lostmimic,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:00:52 2015 UTC,For more coverage. If you do the unlimited T-Mobile plan it is $70 so if you are sub 5GB a month then it is cheaper for better coverage
Nexus,33jpkc,Skripka,2,Thu Apr 23 19:58:20 2015 UTC,Not really better coverage at all...T-mo and Sprint coverage are equally bad.  I say that as a Sprint customer.
Nexus,33jpkc,lostmimic,2,Fri Apr 24 16:45:40 2015 UTC,"There are nuggets of locations one has over the other, it may only increase coverage area by like 1-2%, but still something for less :)"

Google Play Services has it's own data management button in Settings > App which is different from the standard ""Clear data"" button most apps have. I have used that to clear the data out of Google Play Services whenever it misbehaves and have never had a problem with it. But I put the disclaimer to do some more research before doing it just in case.  Edit: I just cleared GPS data and rebooted. No problems with any of the 3 accounts I have listed.

Using it on wifi helps.  A bad proximity sensor could be a problem. You can test that easily by making a few test calls.   After using it a few days you should be able to tell better.

I (and many others) had the same poor battery experience until I did these five things:    Root the tablet.  This will allow 2 and 4. If websites with ads seem slow, install ad blocking software. A few user tests show ads can peg the CPU and drain the battery more quickly.  With some ad blocking apps you need to turn off Chrome data saver too. Try Chrome beta.  IMO it's more efficient with less battery drain.  That code will eventually make it into the main Chrome release. Run a custom kernel and control app like elementalX to adjust the CPU settings/run more efficiently. Google made some interesting decisions about how the CPU runs... Read this thread:  http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/general/batterylife-thread-t2928991    I'm not excited that I needed to take these steps BTW.

After taking these steps,  I easily get 7-8 hours screen on time with moderate to heavy load, games, browsing, kindle reading, etc...  Before I was lucky to get 4-5 hours.

Nexus,3292l8,EricPlasencia,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:27:03 2015 UTC,Well I'm thinking of getting the nexus 5 moving from my iPhone 6. How is the battery in general? This is my biggest concern. My previous androids have been awful on battery. What's your usage and percentage at the end of the day?
Nexus,3292l8,mr_clarkekent,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"I use it normally, though I rarely use for calls. I have another phone for that. So it's Mainly Internet and games.  I charge once a day, time of day varies.  When I use it a lot like say 3 to 4 hours of constant, uninterrupted Interneting (chatting and all) somewhere along the day, I find that I'll have to charge it again. But if it's not constant and overly a lot, the battery lasts me a day.  I sleep at around 11, midnight.   Check The review video of MKBHD. He  gives a good review of the other features..  I personally have no problem with it.  I love it.  The only problem might be that fact that most apps haven't yet improved or upgraded for lollipop and 5.1 so once In a while an App may freeze for a few seconds. Which rarely happens also.  Other than that,  the phone is perfect IMO."

Nexus,329gi3,littleemp,3,Sat Apr 11 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"Get a new phone.  Phones are just getting close to coming out of a 'boom' like PCs did in the early 90s.  The difference a year or two makes is substantial when it comes to mobile hardware.   As for short term solutions? Factory reset could speed it up. Flashing a minimal rom without google play services could help extend the life of the phone, but then again you wouldn't have google play services, which means no google apps.  Basically, unless you want to sacrifice the phone's functionality, his best bet is to just get a new phone. You can get a used Nexus 4 for around for like 100 to 140 USD. A used nexus 5 for 150 to 200.  Although your friend's best bet would be to go with a phone made in 2013 or 2014. Spending more is going to mean that the phone will last longer. Be careful buying used off of eBay. You can get some phones that look cosmetically good and work, but have horrendous signal quality, etc.  Swappa is probably your best bet for used phones."

Screens are compable. It doesn't have the camera lump. Build quality and materials are similar.   On paper it is a lesser phone in almost every way. If it weren't for the PS4 remote play I would not have bought it, but there are no deficiencies that make me regret choosing it.   The Z3 has a Micro SD slot.

Nexus,31dwxp,mecrob,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:15:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to point out, before you buy one, that the casting works differently on an Android TV host.  A Chromecast casts it's content into a Chrome webview to display whatever, hence the name. An Android TV device looks for an appropriate receiver on the device based on the content. E.g. Casting from Netflix on a phone to the Nexus Player will open the Netflix app but if the Netflix app is not installed, it will not open anything and not show up as a cast option on the phone.  This will probably change in the near future with updates but when I was using one, this came as a surprise to me."

Xperia Z couldn't make it thru my day (which I consider light/moderate use - check messages, maybe clear collectors on CoC once or twice etc, usually less than 2 hours of screen-on time)  Nexus 6 gets me home with 50 to 40% remaining.  And that was pre-wireless charger (you may already do this on N5), but adding that is amazing (just set my phone down on my desk and it's topping up).  I've heard that I would charge faster by plugging it, but that requires a thought while the wireless requires none."
Nexus,30rcd1,curomo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:10:22 2015 UTC,My experience doesn't seem to match the experience of others who have posted.  Checking my nexus 6 right now - Have had it for 3 days...  46 % battery life - 52 minutes of Screen On Time Android OS - 5% Google play Store - 5% Hangouts - 4% Google Services - 4% Cell standby - 4% Etc...  Is my device defective? This battery life is pretty bad. I fucking love this phone so much though.
Nexus,30rcd1,slilonsky13,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:31:48 2015 UTC,I own both a Nexus 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Had them around 5 months.   Battery life on the Nexus is enough to last me through 1 day but no more. When I'm home I usually have to put it straight on charge. Its average overall considering the size of the battery. I'd gladly have had a 1080p screen instead of QHD.   6 Plus absolutely smokes it in battery life. Its not even close. On average my 6 Plus lasts as long on 1 charge as my Nexus 6 does on 2. Not even kidding.

Nexus,30iecd,Xen0sys,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:04:22 2015 UTC,"Just want to throw it out there but you can keep TWRP on a stock rooted phone and manually apply the system.img, etc via fastboot. All relatively painless and straightforward. This lets you keep root or rather lets you reflash root via TWRP after updating the system.img, etc.  See: http://android.stackexchange.com/a/86846/19168  Yes it's more work than not rooting and keeping stock but it also isn't too much work for the gains of root. You just have to download the factory images and unpack them."

No big deal but that's not how it used to work.  A few hours later I return with my Nexus6 to do the activation in store, and I basically ended up camped there the rest of the afternoon. Turns out that after much frustration by everyone involved, my phone can't be activated since it wasn't purchased from Verizon. That then results in a call to the internal Verizon tech support number, where it gets explained to their tech that the phone is not from Verizon and the various attempts by the employees have failed. At some point in that mess I end up talking to their tech, confirming that the phone is brand new, purchased from Google -- why? none of your damned business, but I make up an excuse of having some google play credit I wanted to use up. The tech tells me he can try to add my Nexus6 into their system but the change request will take a few days to clear, then I'll need to revisit the store to finish the activation. Eventually they let me out of the store with the new sim card still in my Nexus.  Current state is that the phone will connect to the Verizon network but the sim isn't tied to any account; if I load up a web browser it redirects to a page telling me to contact verizon to activate my phone. It's a screen I've seen before, and the Verizon website actually has a helpful page where you can move your number to a different phone and sim card, I used it the last time I bought a phone and it worked flawlessly, unfortunately when I try it now it rejects the IMEI of my new Nexus6.

In addition to publishing any applicable standards, providers must establish a reasonable process for expeditiously reviewing requests from manufacturers, application developers and consumers to employ devices and applications on their networks. If a provider denies such a request, it must offer a specific explanation and an opportunity for amendment of the request to accommodate the provider's concerns.   File a complaint with the FCC and contact one or more of the FCC commissioners directly. I hope you have evidence of your experience."

No device will work on Verizon unless they approve it and the cdma is the backbone of their network.  You will never see a phone on Verizon without cdma, to fall back on outside of lte, which gives them the power to approve and control devices on their network.  If any OEM tried to install their cdma radios for use without Verizon's authorization they would sue and have an injunction against those devices."

The M8 was also nice but seemed like a distant 3rd- it was sort of a 'control' for me.  Suffice to say, display was probably my #1 concern going in other than stock android/battery life, but the difference was so small that I ended up getting the Nexus 6.    Again, I literally just got back from the store with it, but the displays were something I spent some time there comparing.

It was mentioned above about the color change below 5% but overall I'm pleased with it. I knew going in that it wouldn't look as good as a note 4, not that it looks amazing but Samsung had a tendency to turn the contrast up a tad bit to really accentuate colors and make it seem like a way better display. I don't know resolution stuff but I do work with phones at a Best Buy Mobile and that seems to be the consensus with our group and our Samsung rep."

Your phone can measure every piece of data that it sends but it doesn't know if your carrier ever actually gets that data and what the data terms of your contract are.   For example, are you currently on a T-Mobile tower? Are you using a tower from another carrier? Are you using data that doesn't count towards your data limit (i.e. Spotify/Pandora/etc.)? If so, which data exactly? All data in the app? What happens if your phone loses a connection and reconnects (happens all the time from switching towers/losing signal), how much of the data request got through before the connection dropped? Those are just a few examples of stuff your phone can't know.  Picture your data connection in your phone as a guy screaming words at t-mobile.

The Slim is pretty cheap, so I'd be inclined to go for the Spigen one that you've got linked, because it does offer a bit more protection, but if you find the buttons frustrate you, then pick up the Ringke Slim later on."

This has been specifically for T-Mobile, but I live in an area where I seriously need wifi calling, and its not available (yet)   What I like about it:   5.0 (and that I can sideload 5.1) The fact that its been out for 5 months and the Note 4's don't have it yet was a real push for me. Not to mention anything else that'll come after it, I'll have it right away. Dual speakers on the front. Holy shit, does it get loud. I love them.

Nexus,2y5ppt,EricPlasencia,2,Fri Mar 6 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"There doesn't tend to be any issues with SMS/MMS or group chat Bluetooth or device connectivity, but it eases messaging to use google hangouts, its kind of like imessage, just a little different and multiplatform, as long as you have a google plus account you can use hangouts which allows free messaging between other g+ members that you have included in your g+ circles, this allows also for free voice and video calls (group or otherwise), you can also call any U.S. number all over VoIP for free. Hangouts allows you to combine SMS and hangouts messages so you see all messages/ notifications coming from the same place, plus its cross platform, if you download hangouts on an iOS device, or use it on a Mac, PC, or Linux device you can still have access to and reply to your messages. Theres other things too. Google docs is a document viewer/ editor, although adobe also has these applications, google sheets is a Microsoft excel/ spreadsheet editor, google slides is a basically power point editor, all of these work very nicely and are also cross platform, so whatever is uploaded to your sheets, slides, or docs is accessible anywhere, you also get access through google plus an app called photos which once you activate it automatically syncs your photos to your google profile (these images are private of course and not actually on your profile BTW), and the photo storage is immense to say the least and also free, you get access to google drive which is actual cloud storage also free if I remember you get 50gbs free, also there is google play music, which with a subscription allows for an amazing music experience, collection, its basically Spotify on steroids (IMO),  you can buy songs, but it also allows for 20,000 songs to be stored (50,000 with a subscription) for seamless cloud playback so you don't have to waste space on your phone, you get access to google keep, think post-its, but cross platform so you can see them no matter the device your using, and if you share a note with a friend they can see it and if you chose edit it, and you'll see the edits, and they'll see yours, also sheets, slides, and docs, documents can be shared and edited in this way too allowing for groups to easily work together, there's also google play books, its more or less a really clean ereader like app, play games is related to android gaming and is linked through a google plus account so no matter what platform you are on if you can connect a game through a google account it will save your data to your account through play games, you can also use it to explore games, and friends, what they're playing, how they're doing and you can also compare stats between yourselves, etc. Play games is also pretty visually appealing with subtle animations. Play movies and TV allows for purchase of movies or TV shows and offline download/ playback, google translate can translate speach on the fly as well as translate text by using your camera. It displays what your camera is seeing on your screen and then actually changes the languange of what it is on the fly, no need for a picture it just changes what it looks like, say it's a box if cereal, all of the text is now spanish and the colors behind the text and everything's still the same its a neat party trick. You can connect any Bluetooth device and transfer files over Bluetooth, you can also Bluetooth tether internet if you wanted, you can WiFi tether internet, and USB tether internet. You can connect a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse if you'd like and a little mouse pointer comes on screen, and if your phone has slimport or a microhdmi port it can output HDMI to a monitor so you could use it for a more PC like experience with both web browsing and apps, we have NFC so if you're playing music and your boombox has Bluetooth and an NFC tag embedded in it (mine does its quite popular actually) you can tap your phone to it and it'll automatically sync Bluetooth and start playing music you can also buy and set your own NFC tags allowing for you to auto connect to your car when you dock your phone in the car (or WiFi)(also what I do). NFC alsows allows you to tap your phone to someone else's back directly and if they chose to accept you can share photos, links, files, etc.some phones allow for 4k recording BTW,  you can also download movies, music, and applications directly form the internet if you'd like.   Issues imessage users can have 'difficulty' sending/ receiving texts from android, this is actually apples fault and they're going through a lawsuit, and to properly unlink your number from imessage you need to go to a special apple site, also unless you root your device there's not really a way to get reachability on stock android (double tap home button on iOS) and googles stock camera app doesn't take advantage of the new APIs in lollipop because they're geared towards professional photographers so you need to find a lollipop camera app first, and on a plus, I found streaming to be more reliable on android than it was on iOS, I found on iOS my iPhone even with clear ram would kill YouTube unexpectedly sometimes among a couple other issues that may have been due to my router but my chrome cast had no issues, quite honestly I've found 99% of what there is on iOS in android and then quite honestly a metric fuckton more, much much more than I expected in terms of how easily things work, how smoothly everything talks to each other from a software point of view, both iOS and android are pretty speak and very refined, after becoming comfortable with all the options and getting everything settled to my tastes I find much comfort in the level of customizability and raw command power the android interface can put in the users hands"
Nexus,2y5ppt,Blunt_Wizard,2,Fri Mar 6 20:33:12 2015 UTC,Sounds all good. My main concern I guess is not having the nice experience that iMessage has. Literally ALL of my friends are on iMessage so hangouts really does nothing for me.   I just hope that group messaging and mms works well in one thread you know? Want them to see my pics fine and visa versa.
Nexus,2y5ppt,Blunt_Wizard,2,Fri Mar 6 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately group chatting with imessage wont work because group chatting with imessage is ONLY allowed between imessage users, but you can still text normally, the reason why I brought up how multiplatform and fluid hangouts is is because it would allow your friends to at least download it if they wanted to group chat/ call/ video call because all you need is a gmail, so you sign up, add that person to your circles on google plus and start a conversation, plus it works on the computer, unfortunately there's no actual imessagw client because of legal reasons but its a compromise, plus it can work on and PC/Mac/ios anywhere, that's the only drawback and its honestly apples fault with how imessage is coded"

I'd say that the complaints about the battery life and performance are related to the default encryption, which you can disable by flashing a custom ROM. 32gb is fine for everything but storing movies on the device, and if that's something you do, the note 4 is a better purchase. The note 4 also has an IR blaster and the stylus, but the functionality of those is tied into touchwiz, so take that into consideration.

If ARA became popular during the Market Pilot: then ARA might be released globally. When and if that happens, the Nexus line will probably still continue as their flagship smartphone. Turning ARA into a separate product along side Nexus. Mainly due to the Nexus name recognition and offering a non-modular phone.   If ARA becomes much more popular than expected during the Market Pilot (over 50,000 modules sold): then the Nexus line might conform to ARA down the road. Imagine a Nexus phone with ARA-like qualities. A removable camera, battery, screen, or processor using ARA inputs. A type of hybrid between modularity and flagship smartphones.     Will ARA replace Nexus entirely? Most likely no, the brand is too valuable and familiar. Will ARA effect future Nexus products? That sounds more reasonable."

Nexus,2wao3w,jubaarhasan,2,Wed Feb 18 09:15:04 2015 UTC,"How is this possible? I thought the charging speed of a battery had to do with the battery itsel, not the amount of current being delivered to the device."
Nexus,2wao3w,Eyger,7,Wed Feb 18 09:29:50 2015 UTC,"Batteries do have a limit to their charging speed, but nowadays other factors limit the charging speed so low that the battery limit is almost never the problem. Basically three things limit the charging speed:   The battery limit itself: the battery charging controller (chip inside the phone or inside the battery pack) is programmed to not pull more power than the battery can safely handle. This limit is almost never reached because the other ones are reached first. The power of the charger: each charger (either a wall charger or a computer USB port) is manufactured to provide a specific maximum power, drawing more power than the charger can safely handle can lead to bad things (overheating leading to things melting, frying, or/and exploding). The communication between the phone and the charger to agree on a limit: since the phone (actually the charging controller chip inside the phone or inside the battery pack) is the one to ""decide"" how much power will be drawn (and hence how fast it will charge), then it needs to communicate with the charger or use clues to figure out how much power the charger can safely handle. The clues and protocol for communication are defined in the various USB standards.  3a. Modern fast wall-chargers send some special messages to the phone to let it know how powerful they are, so the phone can open the flood gates and charge very quickly (never faster then the battery can handle).  3b. Older or cheaper chargers send more rudimentary clues to the phone to let it know that they are ""simple wall chargers"" and can handle a moderate amount of power.  3c. In the absence of any of the above clues, the phone assumes it is charging from a computer USB port, and not knowing what kind of USB port, it assumes it is a very old and basic one that supports only a tiny bit of power, so the phone charges very slowly as to not overload what he believes is a very weak charger.   So, what I suspect this cable does is to simply change the ""clues"" to make case 3c look like case 3b above, making the phone think that the USB port is actually a moderate wall charger (I may be wrong, maybe it even communicates as case 3a above). This would ""convince"" the phone that it is safer to pull a bit more power from the computer and charge faster.  Edit: If my suspicion is correct, then maybe it could be dangerous to plug such a cable on some computers. Maybe it could ""fry"" the USB port of a computer not prepared to handle the extra power. But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they made something that is still within the boundaries of the USB standard and consequently will not cause electrical problems."
Nexus,2wao3w,BadgerRush,1 point,Wed Feb 18 12:29:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're close, but from reading the idieogogo and wikipedia, it looks like what's happening is the cable is flipping the USB port between a charging port and a data port.  Two quotes from wikipedia:  ""Two types of charging port exist: the charging downstream port (CDP), supporting data transfers as well, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), without data support.""  ""With charging downstream ports, current passing through the thin ground wire may interfere with high-speed data signals; therefore, current draw may not exceed 900 mA during high-speed data transfer.""

You can achieve the same results with custom kernels that support the ""usb fast charging"" option. Many people ignore the thickness of data and charging cables, as most companies don't put the thickness values on the box, but it's a major factor in charging speed. If you plug a very thin cable to a >2A wall charger, you'll still get a slow recharge because the cable will carry 1A, or 0,5A."

No matter what T-Mobile says, Verizon and AT&T have the bigger network. So if you travel a lot, especially through non-major cities... You're better off with Cricket. Or are inside a lot.  But... Cricket caps speeds at 4mbps ('4G')/8mbps ('LTE'). This may be a huge deal breaker for some. For me, I don't care. I'm willing to take a hit to get down to $25/line for 4 lines after taxes. And that's why I'm leaving T-Mobile.. at least for now. Getting better indoor reception will just be a bonus."

When they made the nexus 10 they had a separate ui for the larger tablets (which i loved and am pissed they got rid of) but they changed theyre view on that with one of the jellybean updates kind of giving tablets a blown up phone ui making it kind of pointless for 2 tablet series Asus still got to make 2 nexus 7s. And the 9 kind of brings the 10 and 7 into one series  Now im not sure any of this is real but i thought i should share it. I would like to hear back as your comment has thought put into it"
Nexus,2u77co,jdcnosse,3,Fri Jan 30 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"It just wouldn't make sense from a business perspective to grant the rights to X device for two years in a row every time. You have to remember that Google is constantly creating trends with their products, not following them, so the Nexus program is very fluid and short term as far as planning goes.   I don't think that Google knows what they're bringing to the table in 2016 yet, so it would be silly for them to promise something in advance that may or may not happen. If anything, after all these years, the only thing we can infer is that the Nexus program is only finalized maybe 6 months or so before actual release. (Prototypes may exist a little more in advance, but that's about it.)   We honestly don't know anything other than the fact that if they are bringing a 2015 nexus line up, then it would most likely include a tablet and a phone. Even the Nexus Player v2 is not a sure thing for 2015, just like the Nexus 10 wasn't a sure thing in 2013 or the Nexus 7 in 2014.  Edit: it's not that I think that they are poorly organized or something similar, but due to the fluidity of what the Nexus program has become throughout the years, I just don't think that even Google knows what is in store ahead of whatever they are cooking up this year."

Nexus,2u1eht,dizzi800,120,Thu Jan 29 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"So, about the units here, just a quick lesson:  Thousand, when abbreviated as ""k"" for kilo, is always lowercase.  Thousandth, when abbreviated ""m"" for milli, is always lowercase. (M is the abbreviation for mega, or million, so this is especially confusing.)  Any units named after an individual, like Ampere, are always capital abbreviations, in this case ""A""  Next: Capacity is mAh not mA/h, that is, you  multiply the current (mA) by time (h) to find the power, in this case how long can said battery  provide x amount of current. given that different tasks on the phone require different currents, depending on which components are active, this will only help estimate the life, but you can be pretty safe with an average usage number device to device of similar hardware.  Now in general, saying something like 3.5 thousand thousandths of an Ampere-hour would sound crazy, it is common to refer to battery capacities in mAh, so this is fine.  At any rate, I just thought I'd point this out, and units are kind of a pet hobby of mine so it struck home when I read this post.  Aside from that, I actually agree with what you say here.  I hope that you have a great whatever time of day it is that you read this at, and have left slightly more learned for it.  tfatf"

Nexus,2u1eht,SomeRunner,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:50:06 2015 UTC,I think we're all clear this is fake but if any ones interested I've noticed a pattern to the nexus program and every year my suspicion to this trend strengthin I've noticed that if you count the g1 as a nexus HTC put out 2 Samsung put out 2 lg put out 2 and i assume Motorola's due for a second.  I don't know if the tablet series is following a similar pattern. The nexus 10 throws me off a bit but if you dismiss that then 2 tabs made by Asus i wonder if the next 9 will be by HTC as well. only time will tell if these patterns are real i gues  (remember these are suspicions/opinions i am willing to debate not fight)

That really depends on your financial situation and prioritization of expenditures more than anything else.  Not to go all /r/personalfinance on you, but it sounds like the N9 is a want, not a need.    If you've got money you can allocate for fun purchases like this go for it! If you're having trouble paying the bills or meeting your saving goals (assuming you have them) then hold off on the purchase.  If the N7 is indeed in pristine condition, maybe you could resell it for $100 or so, or gift it to a relative to help justify the upgrade to yourself.  Also, how long ago did you buy the N7? If it's a 2+ year old tablet I'd be more inclined to upgrade myself.  P.S. FYI there is an update to Lollipop rumored to be released in February that should address some of the RAM usage issues."

If you're asking whether its superior to the Nexus 7 (2013) I'd say not really. You're basically getting the same experience since they are both running the same version of Android with the same amount of RAM etc. So (assuming you can sell your N7 for around $100) is the larger screen worth $300 to you?"

That, and I don't really have any desire to run root apps any more. God, I never thought I'd ever say that!  I've got mixed feelings about Touchwiz. Replacing the launcher solves most of the issues on the surface, but the notification drawer and Settings menu are both still dreadful. Overall, the sheer power of the Note 4 means everything runs smoothly as well, so there's no problem with sluggishness from bloat.  And the S-pen. Sheer genius! I love this thing!  So yeah.

My 3rd one still has it but not as noticeably as the first 2 so I just kept it. It's pretty easy to check. Just set the KB to material dark and put the phone in landscape.

In terms of specs, the Note 4 is definitely up there with the Nexus 6, but I find no compelling reason to consider it personally.

I also have it turn off WiFi, turn on auto brightness, and a couple other things. Then when I turn my car off, Bluetooth disconnects so I have Triggers turn off Bluetooth and turn on WiFi. And the nice part is my phone is mounted and charging the whole time!  The nano suction is nice. Definitely not too strong. The magnets are basically doing all of the work. I don't think the nano suction would even be strong enough to hold it without the magnets. I'd say they work very well together.

Nexus,2sucgs,WhatTheFuts,1 point,Sun Jan 18 21:42:50 2015 UTC,yeah i think magnets are def the way to go.    i also really think someone should make this truly wireless.  put a 3000mah battery and a solar charger and bam you've got everything you need to charge your phone on the go and it's actually wireless.  of course you'd have a backup cable just in case it's cloudy or whatever.  but i think that could sell.  just not so sure about how quickly a solar charger could charge a battery that size.

Nexus,2ssycc,JadedDJay,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:31:49 2015 UTC,"Another thing about the ""first"" android phone for you... the stock experience would be a good one to experience first.  the UI skins from manufactures often diverge pretty far from the standard rules.  I believe that up until recently, each of these companies tried to come up with some sort of ""feature"" to make them stand out.    In my experience, most people who start with samsung tend not to enjoy the stock interface when they use my phone and they tend to get confused and are pretty quick to reject it.  I think this is because they don't know what android is supposed to be like.  But since I started with a stock interface, I feel like I am able to navigate skinned interfaces better because I have a reference point and basic understanding of where some of these UI touches and new features were derived.    Moto x has been the darling because, in my opinion, it was the first skinned interface that looked very stock.  The features that were added weren't meant to take over the show, but they were very nice, tasteful additions that complement the stock experience.  They have even made it to the nexus 6."

I've made myself a few 'trick' cables a few years ago, it is piss easy.  It will not charge faster of you are connected to AC, only to a computer. It also is not guaranteed to work with every USB port on a computer since USB2 is rated at 500mA if I'm not mistaken.  You can easily create one of these 'smart' cables by cutting the the 2 data wires and short them with a resistor, making it think that it is connected to AC. (Resistor value should be 200ohm if I recall correctly). You could also add a switch so you can toggle it on or off.  It does look to be built very good tho.

So either equivalent or cheaper than most other flagships.   Outside of size concerns (if op has particularly small hands)  it's a fairly good starter phone.   OP can use this and by the next time that a decision needs to be made,  op will have a better idea of what's important.   Is stock boring or would a skin be preferred.

If you are, you might as well just sideload the update as it'll be just as easy. Force-Check for updates  Edit: do this at your own risk, see replies below.

It's basically clearing your randomly generated unique device ID, and forcing a new one to be generated. This can be problematic as apps can rely on this identifier, and get messed up when it changes. This can cause pretty serious wakelock issues and ruin battery life.

When 5.0 first came out I did a wipe and installed it clean and things were really really terrible. My wife actually uses the 2012 these days as I've got a 2013. Her criteria for usability is probably lower than mine - pretty much all it's used for is Facebook, email & web browsing. But she complained that, with 5.0 on it, it was really sluggish. I noticed that sometimes it worked fine, but some things (eg hitting the 'recent apps' button) could leave you waiting 30 seconds for a result.  When 5.0.2 came out I wiped it & installed the new version clean again. It's been absolutely night-and-day. The tablet's snappy again... perhaps snappier than it was with 4.4, and she loves using it now. I'm very impressed.  So yes - I absolutely recommend 5.0.2 over 5.0.

I've used 7"" tablets, 10"" tablets and 9.7"" touchpad to read comics before and I can honestly say that the Nexus 9 is by far the most comfortable size I've had to date.

However, you might want to check Hearthstone. I recall it being tablet only for now?  Which the N6 would not work (though, may be able to sideload it?) This would be your biggest issue, if you have tablet only apps."
Nexus,2qzw53,linh_nguyen,1 point,Thu Jan 1 14:56:22 2015 UTC,Hearthstone can be sideloaded. I played it on my Nexus 5. Requires a modified apk for the 5. Not sure about the 6.

I had an N7 (2013) and N5; but once I had the N6, I realized that I essentially stopped using the N7, so I repurposed it for my wife.  I can also add a bit of color here in reverting back to the N5 (the N6's form factor is just a bit unwieldy for my preferences/handsize).  Although I hadn't missed the N7 while I had the N6, now that I'm back to the N5...I find its screen lacking for watching Netflix/Hulu/etc.  So, from my experience at least, the N6 did fill both roles quite nicely."

I used my iPad for reading books but I find the 6's screen large enough to comfortably read.  I've heard comics on the 6 are doable, but nowhere near as true-to-life as a tablet experience.  I can't really speak to that though as I don't read comics.  Gaming is fine, get a bluetooth paddle.  Hearthstone requires a bit of a work around to get the APK working on the phone."

So instead of playing games,  reading books,  listening to music and etc... On my phone,  I'd use my tablet instead to preserve my battery.    When you think about it,  that's a really expensive extra battery.    In other words,  I think you'll be fine with a n6.

Nexus,2qwkxq,FibbleDeFlooke,2,Wed Dec 31 08:33:03 2014 UTC,"You're asking whether the display has a 60hz refresh rate. That's the FPS of the display, essentially. That's what you should Google. Now, I'm pretty sure all modern phones have a 60hz screen as standard, after all it's not that difficult and it's a lot harder to deal with resolution. So the hardware should allow it to display 60hz videos. However, what the hardware can do doesn't correspond with what the software will do. Example: when playing games, whether it be on your phone or your computer, if you have a frame counter up you will see the framerate will jump around a lot, or if it's a pretty powerful computer the framerate will stay high and constant. If you get 400fps during a game or whatever, doesn't mean that those frames will actually be displaying (obviously). What I'm trying to say is that the hardware capacity has no relation to what the software will do, and if the software won't play at 60 and only stays at 30 that's only because the software doesn't want to. If the YouTube app doesn't display 60fps it's not because your hardware can't do it, it's because the software is not doing it for whatever reason. In this case, you simply might not have gotten the update, or your internet won't allow it (you're on data or whatever).   TL;DR: Yes the Nexus 6 can do 60fps, it's the YouTube app that's not letting you for some reason, maybe you haven't gotten the update or your internet won't allow it.  In addition to that, people will still upload their videos in 30fps, so there's no point trying to make that 60fps. And all old videos will continue to be in 30fps, as YouTube hasn't processed it to display in 60 and it probably no longer has the files."

Nexus,2qrzue,pap55,2,Wed Dec 31 00:51:24 2014 UTC,Can you elaborate on those things?  I'm just curious.
Nexus,2qrzue,ew73,3,Tue Dec 30 07:34:31 2014 UTC,"Sure.  The few that stand out to me are:   There's no app drawer.  When you install an app, it's on the home screen, and there's no way to not put it there.  Compare to Android, where installed apps are generally added to the home screen, but you can remove it without uninstalling the app.  I find it particularly useful for apps I infrequently use but like to have around, or apps that are present for some secondary functionality they provide, like Facebook (for me) -- I use it because it can merge my FB contacts with my phone, but I rarely spend time actually using the app itself. The ""Display Zoom"" function is strange.  ""Zoomed"" fills the screen with 5 rows of icons plus the Bottom Stuff.  ""Standard"" is slightly smaller, same 5 rows, with an empty, unusable blank space.  Android would almost certainly use this for a 6th row of icons. Siri is laughably bad, when compared to Google Now. Why, after 8 revisions, is there still nothing like a home screen widget?  Is it really that hard?  What's holding Apple back here?   On the flip side, though, I have to say that the hardware behind the iPhone is fantastic.  I even like that fucking lightening connector.  Aside from ""not being standard"", it's better in every way for power / data connection.    I also feel like the quick settings in iOS 8 are implemented better than Android, even though I didn't think to look at the bottom of the screen for such things when I first started."
Nexus,2qrzue,pap55,2,Tue Dec 30 20:19:36 2014 UTC,I was just asking.  It's fun to hear people's perspectives on things like this.  I agree with all your points though.  I like the implementation of quick settings in iOS (especially screen brightness) but it would be nice if  it gave every option like the drop down settings in Android.
Nexus,2qrzue,ProbablyPissed,-1,Tue Dec 30 21:21:13 2014 UTC,"where installed apps are generally added to the home screen, but you can remove it without uninstalling the app.   What exactly is the advantage of having open space on the homescreen instead of apps, other than aesthetic purposes ie seeing your wallpaper.   Siri is laughably bad, when compared to Google Now.   Not really, they both just perform better at different things.   Why, after 8 revisions, is there still nothing like a home screen widget? Is it really that hard? What's holding Apple back here?   Because they, and many other people, understand that people aren't sitting there with their phones on looking at their home screen like they would a computer; a widget is really no more useful to you than opening an app.  They decided to hide widgets in their pulldown notifications menu instead, which can even be accessed from the lock screen."

Nexus,2qdkw1,claytonraymond2004,2,Fri Dec 26 10:32:19 2014 UTC,And suddenly you have a device that is meant to be used across the room that you can no longer read the UI.

Nexus,2qexby,Linkoiram,7,Fri Dec 26 03:05:54 2014 UTC,Just got a qi charger and I love it!
Nexus,2qexby,Meshiest,2,Fri Dec 26 05:44:35 2014 UTC,"Wireless chargers are worth it, although I don't know if that's the answer you're looking for.   I have a nexus 7 2013 and I have a couple Micro USB chargers but they take a few hours to charge   That's probably because they aren't giving enough current. The power adapter that came with your N7 provides more than 2A of power, whereas most phone chargers hover around 1A or 1.2A. Using one of those will definitely take longer to charge your tablet's larger battery.   I am short on power bricks   I don't know what this is meant to indicate. Are you low on available outlets? Don't have many surge protectors?  You still plug inductive chargers into the wall, and some of them don't come with a charger. The ""wireless"" part means no cable between the charging pad and your tablet. If the inductive pad doesn't come with a USB cable or a wall wart, then you'll need to buy one separately and make sure it pulls enough current."
Nexus,2qexby,JimboLodisC,1 point,Mon Dec 29 20:09:07 2014 UTC,A wireless charging pad is EXTRA to your existing charger. You still need the wall adapter and micro USB cable.  Personally i got a wireless charging pad for my desk for my N5. I bought it off ebay for $13. It is great. It means i can charge my phone without consciously thinking about it.  I can sms and answer phone calls and not have to plug it in which sounds lazy but in fact makes a big difference.  For a tablet i probably wouldn't bother. Its not something that you are constantly picking up and putting down.

The default one is good enough for most people, but if you want something else, download something from the app store. Before you do though, try holding down a character similar to what you're looking for and on some keyboards a mini selection menu may pop up.  If not, try downloading something. Since different people can make different keyboards, switching between them quickly isn't always the same. Most will allow you to switch between your installed keyboards easily by holding the space bar for a few seconds, then selecting the keyboard you'd like to use.

See: Telstra, which held all Nexus 5 with Telstra SIM from lollipop update.  Removing carrier SIM will allow you to receive an otherwise restricted OTA no matter where you bought it. Likewise adding a carrier SIM which is holding the update will make sure you don't get notified until either the carrier approves the update or you take the SIM back out."

I'm very curious what your problems with LG's software are as far as stuff you can't fix with root or replace with another better app.  it's possible that the S4's horrible software has diluted my judgment, but aside from the stuff I can replace and fix myself, I think the G3's software is great.  aside from things I would replace immediately regardless like the launcher, keyboard and file manager, there's not a single flaw I see with the G3's system software.  while not quite AOSP, it's a lot cleaner than most manufacturer roms."

Nexus,2otftr,technocr4t,0,Thu Dec 11 11:35:45 2014 UTC,"There is not a technical reason why it won't work. The new LTE iPads come with an ""Apple SIM"" which works on any carrier, but the iPhones have regular carrier-specific nano-SIMs as far as I know. There are some lock-in issues with the Apple SIMs and AT&T but that's not Apple's fault, just AT&T being unable to help themselves from making their customers' lives difficult.  I know that with AT&T I can swap my nano-SIM between my iPhone 5S, Galaxy Note 3, and Nexus 4 (I have a micro-to-nano adapter) with no trouble at all. Just insert the SIM, reboot the phone (not strictly necessary), and I'm good to go. I'm fairly certain if I ever needed a new SIM I could just go to an AT&T store and get one for free.  If you aren't with AT&T, your carrier may have more restrictions, but I imagine they are all pretty much like this."

I'm just weary of buying the same tablet for a 3rd time (sold one to a friend to replace his broken 2012) and now with my SO using my 32gb 2013, I'm trying to find something  different and coming up way short. The Galaxy Tab Pro seems to have a decent dev community and the Shield Tablet is a good alternative, but straying from Nexus is not ideal for me"
Nexus,2o4xc3,my02,1 point,Thu Dec 4 20:44:46 2014 UTC,"There are a couple sub-$200 tablets that are good (LG G Pad being my current low-end favorite), but I wouldn't choose them if I was in the ballpark for a Nexus or better. That leaves relatively few contenders in the $250- $350ish range.   There's the Shield Tablet, which has great reviews if you're into gaming. Otherwise it's probably not what you're after. It has already been updated to 5.0, so support seems decent. I like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S, except for the Samsung bloat. It'll likely get incremental updates, but probably not the next major one. Samsung typically starts out with better hardware but has less update support. Other OEMs may have better update support but have hardware tradeoffs.  I think the new reality is that 1 to 2 major Android version updates is the standard. With how fast the specs are improving I know the OEMs are less likely to push updates to older hardware. Most mainstream apps are going to support older versions for a while. New apps that exclude older versions are not likely to run well on two+ year old hardware anyway.   If anything, I think the main hardware is going to be a more limiting factor than an Android update. My 2012 N7 is still going, but it's noticeably slower than newer stuff. When I get tired of it it won't be because of a lack of Android updates but because the hardware itself can no longer keep up with my expectations based on newer devices."
Nexus,2o4xc3,VesNL,1 point,Thu Dec 4 23:34:17 2014 UTC,"I think that's the reality I'm trying to deal with. Granted the Nexus support will exist after official support stops.

The Shield Tablet is my top contender, I just want the option of using custom ROM and it seems to not really have a dev community for that. Tab Pro 8.4 IS something I was considering but its a bit older. The 2013 7 still seems like the best, but I really am tempted by the 9."

Nexus,2o4rhg,johnjjammock,7,Wed Dec 3 06:29:05 2014 UTC,"I have both.   The size difference is negligible. The 4:3 aspect ratio of the N9 is more compatible with the Lollipop UI (center notification pulldown, etc) than the N10. This might garner some hate, but MY OPINION is that 4:3 ratio is a better fit for most use cases Lollipop moving forward. The N10 is better video wise.   The hardware feels similar, both have a nice soft touch feel, but overall I think the N10 is the better build. The N9 is easier to hold in both portrait and landscape.  Both have beautiful screens. My eyesight has always been 20/6.5, even at 26, and subjectively the N10 is noticeably more sharp. The N9 has better color reproduction, from what I can tell. It just looks like a better panel. I'm partial to resolution, I've been using a Catleap since 2012 and recently upgraded to a 4k Asus TN panel. I'd take res over quality, even when the lower res is ""better."" I can see the difference. Unless you're weird like me the N9 is the better screen.  The N10 is now definitely underpowered for its resolution. The N9 has some hiccups which I attribute to lack of optimization. N10 is underpowered because resolution and two years later its simply underpowered. The N9 is fine hardware wise.  I love my N10. Unless you can get the N10 for a ridiculous deal, buy the N9. It's the better choice for 2014/15."

It has four times as many pixels as the 720p HDTV video standard, hence the name.  This resolution was under consideration by the ATSC in the late 1980s to become the standard HDTV format, because it is exactly 4 times the width and 3 times the height of VGA, which has the same number of lines as NTSC signals at the SDTV 4:3 aspect ratio. Pragmatic technical constraints made them choose the now well-known 16:9 formats with twice (HD) and thrice (FHD) the VGA width instead.

XBMC on the NP plays h264 BD rips fine, but VC1 encoded rips stutter.  So even if XBMC does have trouble with the hi10p clips, it doesn't necessarily mean that the hardware isn't powerful enough, it might be an issue with XBMC itself.  Assuming I can find other video players to sideload onto the NP, I'll try those too.  Update:  OK, first, what the hell did I just watch?  Anyway.  So, via XBMC on the Nexus Player, hi10p videos do NOT play with hardware acelleration turned on.  You get audio, but no video.  Once I turned it off, it played, but it didn't seem 100% smooth.  It was watchable, but I wouldn't say perfect.  Anyway, I'll try to remember to check it out when I get home."

The problem was, that it was animation, and it was hard to find a scene that had lot of fluid motion.  So sometimes when I thought it looked 'jerky', it was actually just a scene with not a lot of animation frames, so it may have been by design.  Some pans definitely were not 100% smooth.  But again, it was watchable, but I don't want to say it was perfect.  I wonder if I can find a hi10p non-anime clip out there that I could do a better test with...hmm..."

Also, how can we use products like this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GTGETFG/ref=s9_al_bw_g107_i1 If devices use different amounts of power, how can these products exist? Do they just have a large amount of power, more than any 5 devices could possibly use, so they just take what they need, or what?   This product puts out 40 W at 5 V, as described in the title. This is 8 A total. So, the sum total of all power drawn by all 5 devices can be no more than 8 A. A tablet will usually use about 2 A these days, and a newer phone will use over 1 A. So, if you're not charging 5 tablets, you'll easily have enough power to charge your devices. Charging 5 tablets won't work well though."

I'm really sad that the n9 was so expensive because I waited for it from when it was announced but knowing that the tablet plus the keyboard cover and taxes were going to cost me north of $800.

I personally have a Nexus 7 2012 but the screen size is so small. I had an iPad 3 which is used 90% for reading, 5% moving watching and 5% for banking.   My Nexus 9 can do everything my iPad could and more. I still largely use it for the same reasons, but movie watching has spiked to about 30% because OTG accessibility gives the Nexus 9 way more functionality over the iPad. Occasionally, I'll hook up a wired mouse and bluetooth keyboard and use it as a laptop.     Gaming hands down is better than both the Nexus 7 2012 and 2013. But if that's ALL you do, get a shield tablet as it's $100 cheaper.   I personally bought my Nexus 9 with proceeds from selling stuff because it's a nice large screen, unlocked, stock android and Android is moving to less and less hardware. When an S2 can run Kitkat decently, heck even a Nexus One can run Kitkat, you know that your device isn't going to suffer from the Apple ""performance crushing buy a new device now please"" update. Aside from the battery issue, a Nexus 9 should be able to handle plenty of OS updates before it has a problem with the iPad 3 has on iOS 8. Longevity alone is worth sizable money that you just can't get on Apple."

Go to a PC on your network, open a command prompt and run the command ""ipconfig"" then use that to enter the following. Keep in mind I've never used the nexus player...  IP address: Whatever your computer returned as it's IP, add 10 to the last number. So if it said 192.168.0.13, enter 192.168.0.23 in the nexus player. If you have trouble with this, try another number close to these, only changing the very last bit, which should be kept lower than 255.  Gateway: enter exactly what IPCONFIG returned for Default Gateway   network prefix length: I would've expected subnet mask here. If it allows you to enter another IP, try entering the value that IPCONFIG returned for Subnet Mask. If it wants a small number try 24 or /24. (24 corresponds to a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, if you have a different mask, post it here)  DNS 1 and 2: enter the IP's given by whatever DNS service you are using. There should always be 2.

I work in the phone industry and have a unique ability to be really fussy about the hardware that's available on the market  I guess I'm also just disappointed that the device didn't follow the same pricing scheme as previous Nexus devices, and also that there was no hardware update to the smaller devices..

If the Nexus Player works with another TV, there may be a compatibility issue between the Nexus Player and the original TV. Contact the manufacturer for additional guidance.

Double check you don't have anything special turned on on the TV, like fancy frame rates, etc., if you haven't already, which I'm guessing you have.  Have you tried a clear cache on the Player in recovery mode? Maybe even a reset?  Also, a new firmware came recently (LRX21V) out so you might see if yours is the latest release, and if you're feeling adventurous and confident, flash it.

Nexus,2ncp2o,disabledquarter,3,Tue Nov 25 07:46:14 2014 UTC,"I went from a Nexus 7 2012 to a Nexus 9 and it was the best decision I've made this year. Here are my uses:   Web browsing Comic book reading Reddit Youtube mkv videos some ebooks   Here's how the whole screen looks while reading comics (imgur might have downsampled the image) :  http://imgur.com/7DpHoVQ  As far as videos goes, the letterboxing does not bother me at all,  because the video is still larger than on my old N7. This thing is blazing fast and I am definitely very happy with it. (I find it to be right size for me)   Would I have been satisfied with  Shield Tablet instead? Probably. Do I regret getting the N9 over any other device? Not one bit.   If someone asks me which are the tablets to get this year, I usually answer with $130=refurbished nexus 7, $175=refurbished g pad 8.3 (if they don't mind living with only xda software support as eternal tinkerers), $300=shield tablet, and $400+=nexus 9 all the way.   Edit: Addressing some of your concerns   Battery life: it is/was only poor during Web browsing because the CPU ramps up very aggressively. They have improved on that a lot to the point where I find it serviceable. If I recall correctly, the Nexus 10 didn't have the greatest battery life to begin with.  Screen is really good. Colors don't over saturated which is especially important for comics in my opinion. (it's the job of colorists to make things pop if they want, not your screen calibration)  as far as manufacturing defects go, I didn't get any showstopper problems and I bought on day one (power button might be a little flush, but I hardly use it because of double tap to wake). 4:3 looks really good for Web browsing and comics. Doesn't bother me for watching videos either.  The speakers won't satisfy any audiophiles, but they are miles better than what any other tablet is offering right now.   The Nexus 10 is a great device, but in no way it is objectively better than a 9. (aspect ratio is a subjective measurement)"

Finally, Android doesn't seem to remember my WiFi connections, I use a portable WiFi modem for when I am out of the house and a lot of the time when I switch from Home to the portable modem, the phone doesn't automatically connect and I have to go into the WiFi menu, select my connection and then have to put in a password (which becomes annoying when the above problem is occurring). Everything else is fantastic, I especially like the notification screen when the phone is locked and being able to double tap the notification to open up the relevant app."

I get ridiculous battery life, it's so smooth and fluid, apps pop open immediately, and I've grown to really like the new silence paradigm. Some of the default settings were bad, but if you spend the time to go through everything and set them as they should be then Lollipop is a significant upgrade over Kitkat.  I do have one weird glitch that I haven't worked out yet. When transferring video files from my phone to my Mac over USB, the phone will occasionally lock up for 1-2 minutes and the transfer fails. It does it about once in every 5GB of transfers. It doesn't need a reboot, it just kind of freezes for a while and Android File Transfer can't communicate with the device--but it knows it's still there."

Lightly pressing the screen made those leaks warp and grow/shrink all over the screen.  The back of the tablet was easily flexed at the lower part, making an audible noise like something was separating from tape or glue.  The device heated up doing the slightest things, such as browsing Reddit on Chrome.  And by heated up I mean uncomfortable hot.  I exchanged it for another one.  The light leaks were even worse and the heating and easily warped screen issues persisted.  Also, if you torqued the tablet by holding it at the 4 edges and turning ever so slightly, the entire tablet would flex.  This is unacceptable in a $500 tablet, IMHO."

While I was on the phone with them I mentioned that I saw their price had dropped by $50, and I asked to have that refunded. They couldn't pay it back to my card, and instead gave a credit to the account I'm on. The problem is that is my family's account, and doesn't go to me at all. Annoying. Secondly, they said that I would be eligible for any promotions within 14 days of purchase, but when I called yesterday they refused to credit me for the $50 Google Play gift card, because I purchased my phone before Friday November 28th despite telling me initially that I would be eligible for all promotions over the two weeks following my purchase.

Really anything at all. After all the reviews, I was prepared for build quality to be total shit. To my pleasant surprise, the only slightly ""loose"" thing is the back cover, only in the sense that it itself is clearly not secured to the tablet. The rest of the tablet, IMO, is actually very well built, with the metal rim making it feel pretty sturdy. Also, according to benchmarks, it's pretty much as powerful as tablets come, with the nvidia tegra k1 (Nexus) beating out the apple a8x (iPad air 2) in a proper 64 bit benchmark. And lollipop feels smooth as hell and I've yet to run into lag in any games, so I don't doubt its performance. Lollipop is also great, btw. It's quite the bang for your buck too, at least when compared to the various iPads. The only significantly better price you'll get for an iPad is the mini 2 I believe, but the nexus 9 will rock the mini 2's world in terms of performance and, well, screen size. TL;DR: I'd go for the nexus 9.  EDIT: Clarification EDIT 2: Benchmark source: http://www.pcworld.com/article/2848130/new-benchmark-puts-nvidia-and-apple-mobile-chips-ahead-of-intels-atom.html"

Tho, with every year we get less, and less ""sponsored devices"". So, I'll have to buy a phone eventually (my Nexus 5s still beautiful tho :)).   Working in phones really puts their prices in a standpoint tbh. Cause at the end of the day? All I really do is text friends, family, and my girl. Occasional, YouTube, twitch, or games (tho rare).

I'd lose calls, barely have good connections in a major city, and just problems all over.  Not to mention being unable to connect internationally...even when I paid for service.  I went to Verizon for two years after them and they were great EXCEPT for their international coverage.  I am now on T-Mobile, which I was on before AT&T.  I left them because at the time, I wanted an iPhone.  Now that everyone has it, there isn't a need...despite that I went to Nexus 5 now.  T-Mobile has been great for me.  Lower prices, plenty of coverage, great international service, I've thankfully not had a problem yet.  Even waaaay back when I was on a Blackberry (before the iPhone), their service was great for me.  AT&T has just been a nightmare not only as a cellular company, but even when I was on their Internet Service.  I'd never go back to anything they offer...which is why I get steamed when phone makers give them exclusivity on flagship phones.  I still think those exclusivity deals is why Windows phone hasn't permeated the market better.  I know I'd rather miss out on a cool phone if it meant signing over to AT&T for two years."

An example of an irritating default,  If you set the volume for the ringer to 0 it will automatically set notifications to 0 no matter what it was set at.   I wanted to keep notification sounds separate from the ringer but on Samsung you can't I can assume they are trying to give an easy way to silence the whole phone but they remove the option of changing this even with rooting.  On the pattern unlock you can't get it to hide the pattern you draw out is another one of those irritating little things.  For every Google app there is a Samsung app trying to take over so you have sVoice trying to be the voice reconnection over google and with most of the Samsung software it works almost ok.     Still, some people do like all the pen apps on the Note but the other factors just drove me to Cyanogen but I'm not a normal user."

Nexus,2m80jd,jtboyz01,1 point,Sat Nov 15 18:43:26 2014 UTC,"Emulators for starters.  I have succeeded in booting up to the bootloader by holding the 'bluetooth device' button while plugging in the power.  You hafto release the button prior to getting to the bootloader otherwise it will assume you mean to 'select' the current bootloader options which is ""NORMAL BOOT"".  This results in then booting to normal android.  Once you can get into the bootloader, the USB drivers will recognize the fastboot device. And you can then proceed to ""fastboot oem unlock"" twice to unlock the nexus player.  This all of course assumes you've enabled USB debugging through the normal methods.  I'm still trying to get ADB drivers to recognize the nexus player, without luck.  I'm also hoping Chainfire has a working root for the nexus player soon.  Ok got the latest drivers from google to finally take on my windows 7 machine.  You hafto get to the dialog ""Have Disk"" and then browse to the drivers from the latest SDK.  Final edit:   Got the emulators working!  had to copy them off my rooted nexus 5 and adb install them onto the nexus player and everything works great."

Kept saying the userdata, system, boot images didn't exist. Thought it was weird since the scripts for the 3 dev previews worked fine. I did revert back to stock 4.4 from the third dev-prev before I did this.  Saw similar issues being reported on XDA forums. The flash-all script has worked fine for some, but not for others.  Caution: Unless you know how to use fastboot, you might (somehow) mess up your phone.  If anyone has this issue, what I did was extract all the files out of the zip archive and manually flashed over all the images, giving a fastboot reboot-bootloader after what images the script did it. If you don't know how to use fastboot, might want to look up on it before attempting.  After that cleared cache, rebooted, and has worked perfectly fine since.

I'm going to keep an eye on reported battery life as that was a big reason I was looking to change (I hesitate to say ""upgrade"" based on what I've read) and it doesn't seem worth it other than the ability to quickly recharge.  Then there's the slow read speed and load times. Seems completely insane that the N5 can load a game that much faster and lag less.  I'm not enthused about a 6"" phone but I could deal with it if the battery and performance were worth it. That does not initially appear to be the case. It's still early though, see if any updates help.  EDIT: So...the slower speeds are maybe due to the mandatory encryption in Lollipop? But no way to turn it off (at the moment)."

It sure as hell isn't worth shelling out another $700 (64gig) when my N5 works great. Would you like to explain why it's ""absolutely an upgrade"" because after reading three reviews now (Anandtech) it's far from that as far as I can tell.  I don't give three shits about having an even bigger screen. I already am not a big fan of AMOLED too and ""oooo bright and colorful"" doesn't sway me. I'd have to see it in person first.  Camera still looks like it has issues. I could not care less that it's 13MP, MP do not make a camera good contrary to popular belief. 8 like on the N5 is more than enough for most people. Bigger != better. Sounds like the focus still hunts a lot, never had that issue on my Thunderbolt or Eris iirc as I remember cussing a lot when I got my N4 and experiencing it's focus issues.  I'd like to see more tests concerning the flash storage speeds since it's possible Ars got a bad one BUT they also noted there was concern over the type that was used as being inferior.   SOT, not impressed, but it's hard to judge based on other people's experiences. I was hoping for better but the quick recharge is nice but I'd like to go to work and make it home without having to charge back up by 2PM (usually down to 15-30%).  All in all, I've seen very little, if anything, that makes me think it's even remotely an ""absolute"" upgrade from my N5.  Edit: It's early, updates will likely come out over the next few months that may change my mind. I'm in no rush to buy, I don't measure/compare my dick length by what phone I have and how new it is, I can wait until next fall and be perfectly happy. I can also buy some cool stuff for $700 that would be a far better use of that money (even though money is not an issue for me)."

I'm going to reread the reviews tonight as I can't focus as much at work but the performance aspect didn't seem that great and even feel short of the N5 in some instances.

Nexus,2m3y4z,Clawz114,2,Thu Nov 13 15:16:48 2014 UTC,I like everything about it. There's nothing I prefer on Kitkat so far.     In particular I like the notification shade with quick settings. The main settings page. Everything is listed in 2 columns now instead of 1. It's more condensed and much more user friendly imo. The app drawer is really nice in terms of how it looks and how it is displayed. All the animations are really nice. The recent apps menu is actually very nice. Better than I was expecting. The new nav buttons are fine. I didn't like them initially but it just seems normal after a few minutes.
Nexus,2m3y4z,STEC06,1 point,Thu Nov 13 18:26:39 2014 UTC,Second the animations. Really nice. They add a smooth quality to the OS.

At first I thought paying a non-subsidized $649 price for a phone was ridiculous. I've gotten used to $200 for even the newest phones on contract.  But Verizon charges $40/month for ""monthly line access"" (apparently T-Mobile doesn't) and their cheapest data plan is $50/month.  So, $90/month compared to $30 for T-Mobile.  Doing the math...  Verizon: $200 (phone) + $2160 ($90*24 - data+line access) = $2360 for 2 years.  T-Mobile: $649 (phone) + $720 ($30*24 - data) = $1369 for 2 years.  Am I doing this right?  Seems crazy."

It has to be a previously unactivated T-mobile SIM.  You'll also need a cutter to knock the full sized SIM down to the nano size.(Or atleast I needed this for the Nexus 5).

While you will get ""unlimited"" web, according to the page you will only get the first 5 GB at 4G speeds (not even LTE) and once you hit the cap you'll get throttled to Edge speeds.

Nexus,2lzqns,foveaii,-1,Wed Nov 12 04:30:54 2014 UTC,I doubt WalMart will actually sell the phones. They sell the activation kits to get on this plan though. The kits include your SIM card and a month of service. If you buy the phone on the Google Play store or from Motorola you can buy the SIM card/activation kit from WalMart and you're good to go. This is exactly what I did with my Nexus 5 and it's been working out great for the past year.

I had a dick smack into me on the streets, knocked my 4 out of my hands and onto the ground, smashed the screen, digitizer isn't working, etc.  Happened in the beginning of October.  So, I thought ""I'll just buy something cheap to get me buy for a few weeks"" and I bought an LG Optimus L90.  Took about 20 minutes before I got pissed off with the silliness LG did, rooted, put a cobbled together CM on there.  Its functional, but painful.  I barely have enough ram to run a few apps at a time.  Storage is crap, I had to remove a ton of my apps that I use sometimes just to leave room for those I use all the time.  GPS is terrible.  The phone is exactly what it was supposed to be - a cheap android phone.  I've been looking forward to today since the announcement by T-Mobile, counting down the days until I will have a phone I can use for more than just email and phone calls (when the screen is responsive, that is - remember that ram issue?).  Now, I get why they delayed things.  Thing is, I'm not getting the 32GB version, so whats in the store does me no good anyway.

I just double checked and it dose ship with lollipop, so next time I need a new phone I might not have to avoid the carrier phones like the plague.  Only reason I can think of to avoid a carrier phones now is the software update delay.

Maybe T-mobile is better about it but I don't have any personal experience with their update roll out system."
Nexus,2m0nz0,IZY2091,2,Wed Nov 12 09:39:46 2014 UTC,"Since there's no difference from the pure version (except for an app or two installed, which can be easily removed), there shouldn't be any extra delay in updates."

The updates can be found online and manually installed, but that requires a person to know how to root a phone and might void warranty. At least that's how it worked back in 2012.

I believe the very highest is 7%, so I guess at worse case scenario you would be looking at $654 before tax, plus the UK tax rate of 20% would be $784, this translates to £494. Keep in mind that not all purchases online (in the US) include sales tax though, it can depend where the item is being purchased from, along with which state you are in.

The limited quantities at the stores will make it look like the phone sold out on the day it's released."
Nexus,2lsb5u,paulisnofun,3,Sun Nov 9 21:35:41 2014 UTC,"This doesn't make sense.  Google has continually not wanted to step on partner toes. You know who cares about this phone? the people subbed here. It's a small number honestly compared to the Galaxy owners out there.  Also, we still have no idea how much retail stock there will be. It won't be everywhere, but we'll see how quickly it sells out for t-mobile. And then the others. For all we know, this is yet another carrier experiment since this is single phone will seemingly work on all major US carriers."

It makes me lose trust in Google as a brand when they release such half baked products. I can't imagine preordering any of their offerings (like I could if I wanted to). The Nexus Player looks like dud based not he reviews, the N9 seems to be plagued with hardware defects, and the N6 seems like a niche phone. So many of us here think Google could make some awesome hardware (they have the Nest Team and the iPod creator!) but they continue to release questionable stuff with no clear direction."

The nexus 5 on the other hand is completely the opposite, I've had it since April and it's almost like new without the need for a case  Based on specs alone though the nexus 4 is still pretty strong! It's got 2gb ram, a snapdragon 600 cpu clocked at 1.5ghz and an Adreno 320 gpu, that's a solid combination and not miles away from being a nexus 5 If it wasn't broken I'd still use it no worries, hell i might even get it fixed"

Nexus,2low62,Norrisemoe,1 point,Sun Nov 9 02:22:59 2014 UTC,"I'd say it DEFINITELY feels better than any previous Nexus tablet. The metal ring around the edge is a really nice touch, and it feels much, much better than the Nexus 10/7 in hand. Personally, I think some of the reviews are overblown. Why? Because they say Google is positioning this as a premium tablet. They are, for sure. But while it isn't as nice as, say, the iPad in build quality, it makes up for it with the fantastic screen (this thing is AMAZING, I love the screen compared with the Nexus 10 or even the 7), the processor, and the touch latency.  What bothers me is that no-one complained that the Nexus 10 wasn't ""premium"" with its $399 pricetag. But the Nexus 9, which is far better in every way, is getting so much criticism.  The Samsung tablets have absolutely amazing displays, though. I've heard great things about them. Feel free to link the reviews you're thinking of, I can peruse them myself to form a better comparison.  It lags in some areas more than you would expect, like multitasking. Loading the app switcher. It isn't much, though. Under half a second delay from button press to menu loaded. I can't imagine Samsung doing any better, or even feeling nearly as fast lol. Within apps it's stupidly fast. Google Keyboard has zero lag when gesture typing (I wrote all of this with the N9), web browsing is quite good (although I find Firefox to be a better touch experience than Chrome on the 9, oddly), swiping around and accessing notifications/quick settings is as smooth as you can get.  I've seen a lot of complaints about the buttons. They all feel plenty tactile to me, except for the volume up for some reason. Hard to hit, the rocker is recessed more at the top than the bottom."

If it did, I'd just take it off with my fingernails (apparently the cover is very easy to remove) and glue the middle down myself!  But, it doesn't. So there's that.

Someone used to have a 2012 N7, but got rid of it for other reasons.  There are a few reasons to go to the Nexus 9.   Screen aspect ratio; if you don't watch a lot of video, I really like it for reading. It's awesome for that. Lots of people mocked the iPad for sticking with an ""ancient"" ratio. I personally think 3:2 is better, but 4:3 is better than 16:9/10 for any kind of reading. Including web browsing. The screen itself. I don't know if it's just the size, or the aspect ratio, or a combination of the two; but the display looks AMAZING. It actually looks very close to the panel in the Nexus 5, except bigger. It's definitely MUCH roomier than the Nexus 7, yet still portable. Build quality. It is definitely a step up from the Nexus 7. It's also quite light, as light as the iPad Air 2. Yes, it is smaller (under an inch smaller diagonally), but it feels good in-hand. The lightness is really nice, though  It does not feel like a luxury device. Do not expect iPad/Surface like design here. But it's much better than other Nexus devices! (Note: I'm not saying Nexus devices feel crappy. The Nexus 9 is simply a lot more premium-feeling (and looking) than other devices. Performance. It is really fast. I have a strong feeling the complaints about lag will be ironed out in software; sometimes it can lag while hitting the multitasking button. Usually under half a second of lag. Sometimes more. Regardless, when in-app: it flies. It can do basically anything you throw at it with no problem whatsoever. Updates. I don't doubt this Nexus device will get updates for years to come. The hardware can certainly handle it; it's absolute top-of-the-line. The 2012 Nexus 7 is end-of-line, most likely. Saved the best for last. TOUCH LATENCY. By far, the best of any Android tablet I've used, and the one thing that has given the iPad a massive advantage in feeling faster than other Android tablets for so long. It's sooo annoying for me. The delay between swiping your finger across the screen and when it registers. The Nexus 7 and 10 were both terrible when compared to the Surface or iPad. The Nexus 4 wasn't that great either. The Nexus 5 was much better, and the Nexus 9 continues that trend.   It's much more important on a tablet than a phone, though, because your swipes need to be faster in order to accomplish the same action in the tablet as on the phone. Hence, the delay becomes much more noticeable. You might think this isn't really important for you. If so, I recommend watching this video. The 10 and 7 are both well over 100ms of delay."

If someone wants an Apple device, this is the best way to convince them that Android can offer just as much if not more than iOS. The hardware is solid, minimal flex. Maybe 0.5-1mm in the dead center of the back, that's about it; if you move even an inch out, the flex minimizes so much it isn't really noticeable.  The performance, touch latency, and software are all absolutely fantastic. It feels very, very polished.

Both of which are starting to improve. My other two issues are hardware related, my biggest one being no Wi-Fi. Not imperative, but I'd love it if the watch could function sans phone. The other being no GPS.

Mine has minimal bleeding on one edge and none of your other problems and it gets just as hot as the shield tablet does and any other tablet will that has the k1. At the moment nobody has figured out how to keep the 64bit processors cool but it doesn't ever get too hot to hold even after playing pvz2 for an hour straight
Nexus,2linzu,dcdttu,1 point,Fri Nov 7 15:47:32 2014 UTC,wait a few weeks for them to resolve the issue and make another batch where theyve worked out the kinks. This is why I'm never an early adopter for any new device. Just like last year when google changed the speakers on the nexus 5. They'll work out the kinks and then this tablet will be awesome.

Nexus,2lh7nz,ridiculouscage,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:19:19 2014 UTC,If you want a solid Qi charger that doesn't slip though just look for the original Nexus Qi charging orb.

Nexus,2ldzid,yokken,0,Wed Nov 5 23:36:26 2014 UTC,In a few months it might drop to regular nexus prices. Maybe the high initial price was just because of the initial expected demand?

The M8 developer edition was around $700 after tax this year and you can find one on Swappa for around $500 - there's a GPE M8 up right now for $490. The N6 has some good specs going on - as long as there are no major issues with manufacturing defects, I think it won't drop below $550 for a 16GB used in good condition for the first 3-6 months."
Nexus,2ldzid,yokken,-1,Wed Nov 5 23:40:01 2014 UTC,HTC did a flash sale at half price for the Nexus 9. A lot of people are questioning the price / value based on a lot of issues with the build quality. That price drop made a lot of people wonder how long the N9 will stay at that price.
Nexus,2ldzid,thinkbox,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:49:14 2014 UTC,"I haven't read anything bad about the build quality on the Nexus 6 so far, and most phones cost $650 outright, so I'd expect the Nexus to follow the same price patterns. I figure it'll lose about 15-25% of its value within a year or so. But I don't buy year-old phones... I buy bleeding edge phones. :)  It is a shame about the Nexus 9 though; I really like the design. If everything on it were just better (screen, battery, performance) I think it'd be deserving of a $349 starting price for a 32GB and $399 for a 64GB. But $480 for a 32GB? No way."
Nexus,2ldzid,yokken,-1,Wed Nov 5 23:56:05 2014 UTC,"While that is bad form to charge users full price and then do a flash sale, it's not fundamentally different from offering free or discounted samples at release.

Nexus,2leciw,Innovative_Wombat,1 point,Wed Nov 5 22:01:57 2014 UTC,Not all of them are being used for research. I also use tabs for keeping a reminder for certain things.  I could use bookmarks but I've found a system that works for me.
Nexus,2leciw,fattienguyen,2,Thu Nov 6 06:22:09 2014 UTC,How many of these apps do you use on a regular basis?
Nexus,2leciw,Innovative_Wombat,2,Wed Nov 5 22:22:03 2014 UTC,"About 50 of them I use once or twice every other day. Others are for specific things,  shopping/ coupons / deals that only get used when I shop (very little but saves lots when I do)  also within those are things Google Apps I uses or can't remove.  I use drive a fuck load but i have Quickoffice I have all the individual office apps,  and of course there's the moto 360 apps,  so I fluctuate between usage around 120 if I'm lucky.  After that it's just very specific apps that I once used for something and haven't used it again or I was trying out some new apps just to see what's out there."

Nexus,2leciw,pvydJxs7,2,Wed Nov 5 20:38:38 2014 UTC,"Yup.  No glass backing on the 5, LTE, bigger screen, better processor, OTG, the list goes on. The N4 was a good phone, but the N5, aside from the size if that's an issue for you, is just better.   And isn't the N4 comparable to the Moto G at this point? One can get a new Moto G for $179 vs a use/refurb N4 for $190. Seems like the Moto G is the better option."

Nexus,2leciw,mrcashmere,3,Wed Nov 5 20:55:24 2014 UTC,"IMO no. The nexus 4 is getting a tad old. Who knows how much longer it will continue to be updated. I had one, it was a fantastic phone, but at this point it seems like a waste to spend that much money on one. If you're wanting to spend only $200 on a phone, get a moto g."
Nexus,2leciw,sultan_ao,2,Thu Nov 6 05:13:27 2014 UTC,I use a Nexus 4 with the N5Experience ROM and I love it to death still. It actually is conflicting when I think about giving it up for the Nexus 6 which I'm planning on purchasing. I personally think the N4 is much more aesthetically pleasing than the Nexus 5. It also had the best OEM bumpers which you can still find easily on eBay or Amazon. I would recommend getting a decent ROM though like the one I mentioned. I have no lag but the biggest problem I have had in the past few months is keep space free even though I do have the 16GB model. The lowest point of the phone is likely the camera because it was made in 2012 and was also a very cheap phone at the time. Other than that it's an amazing phone. I would highly recommend it if it's your cheapest option and you're trying to save money.
Nexus,2leciw,axehomeless,2,Wed Nov 5 21:33:57 2014 UTC,"I've had both the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5, and I highly recommend the Nexus 5 over the 4 (if that's an option for you). That being said, the 4 is still a great phone. Even after two years, it works great but is noticeably slower and laggier and has a lower screen resolution than the Nexus 5. I'd have a hard time switching back after using the 5."

Nexus,2lblk8,Axmis,2,Wed Nov 5 02:32:33 2014 UTC,When you get the push bullet notification you can download the update and manually update your phone.   The OTA could take some time to actually roll out to your particular device because it's rolled out in phases.

Nexus,2lblk8,JimboLodisC,1 point,Wed Nov 5 02:58:18 2014 UTC,"No. You just need the Android SDK, which has a folder inside called platform-tools (Once you've installed an SDK platform). Inside the factory image download is a batch file that installs everything for you.  Keep in mind though that this will wipe everything on the phone (Not the SD though), so do a backup to the SD before you do any of this."

Nexus,2l9lxg,littleemp,2,Tue Nov 4 17:35:02 2014 UTC,"It makes no sense from a business standpoint.  The Nexus 5 performance is only marginally slower than that of the SD 801 or SD 805 in most tasks and it's not like you're going to bring in a much higher density screen than 465 ppi. Making a marginally faster (it could even be argued that it's negligible) while having to divert resources to support its software (which would be completely separate from the N5) makes no sense just to appease a few people.  The one thing they could have done is create a thicker variant with a bigger battery, but aside from that it would've been a complete and utter waste of time and money."

They wouldn't want to eat into the N6 sales by providing an equally as good N5.  The N5 is still a great phone. Likely will be reduced in price a little bit, if anything.  Apple didnt bring along an updated iPhone 5s when they released the iPhone 6.  Samsung didn't update the S4 when the S5 released.  Why would Google?"

Nexus,2l9lxg,theangrypenguin101,2,Wed Nov 5 21:41:58 2014 UTC,Its a good thing I'm not talking about the 5s. The 5c was a rebranding of the 5 with a plastic case.
Nexus,2l9lxg,miahrules,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:03:50 2014 UTC,"Assuming the OP wanted an updated processor and display on the Nexus 5, there is no point.  What should they change on it? Apple changed the back from aluminum, to a plastic (From the iPhone 5 to the iPhone 5C). Updating the processor wouldn't make any sense, seeing as the Snapdragon 800 is still a super performer. It only seems dated because we now have newer ones. But there is no reason for the phone to be revised with new specs or hardware."

The 5 to the 6 is like a jump from the s4 to the note 4.  When Samsung came out with their phablet did they stop updating their smaller galaxy s. NO. Your logic is off because google didn't just make another iteration of their device, they jumped device categories. Samsung and apple both kept a smaller device in the ranks when they released their phablet.  Google did not, but should have."

However, I feel like the Verge offers a lot of conjecture and hyperbole in their reviews, which isn't a good thing when trying to make a decision to purchase a device. And it's typically Apple this or Apple that. Their article serves more as a biased, emotional comparison between the iPad and Nexus 9 than as an actual review of the nexus 9 on its own merits. Comparisons in reviews are fine and should be recommended but they need to be based on real data rather than feelings. More over, they should incorporate more devices and use multiple benchmarks.  Nexus 9 review on the Verge  To contrast, sites like Ars Technica and Anandtech offer facts based reviews, like benchmarks, reviewing the hardware and the software, pros and cons.   Example of a facts based review - Anandtech  I digress, the Verge is not a site for serious techies."

The photoreceptor in the iPhone is physically capable of opening and closing to record an image 240 times a second at best, just like the one in the GS5 can open and close 60 times per second, and the one in my Nexus 1 can do it 30 times per second. My Nexus One cannot physically operate fast enough to record 240 frames per second, the camera isn't good enough and the processor isn't fast enough.   Adding in extra blur frames like you described just makes the motion blurry, it doesn't give you the ability to ""slow down time"" like you can with true 240fps recording.   TL;DR: more samples taken by camera, greater ability to ""slow down time"". ""Blurring"" by adding extra frames does not achieve this."

The only downside is only one of the ports is 2.1A, the other is 1A. It's still a bit faster than Qi wireless charging, which I use the rest of the time, so it makes no difference to me."
Nexus,2kzf5l,juaquin,1 point,Sun Nov 2 20:45:36 2014 UTC,Awesome!   I just bought this:  Anker 2nd Gen Astro Pro2 20000mAh Quad-Port External Battery with PowerIQ™ Technology
Nexus,2kzf5l,eneka,3,Sun Nov 2 20:56:16 2014 UTC,"Anker anything, choose the capacity and features you need. I have their 3000mah stick, 4500mah slim, and 10000mah astro. No issues with any of them."
Nexus,2kzf5l,h4xdaplanet,1 point,Sat Nov 1 20:46:10 2014 UTC,Anker seems like a safe bet! Thanks! :D
Nexus,2kzf5l,dragonsamus,2,Sat Nov 1 23:56:39 2014 UTC,You can also look into ones with quick charge 2.0. They will be more expensive however.
Nexus,2kzf5l,IrekJanek,2,Sat Nov 1 17:59:22 2014 UTC,Have also used the Anker external 5600mah battery. Very affordable and I use mine to keep my phone powered while GPS tracking biking or snowboarding. Easily keeps my phone powered for 8 hours on the mountain with bad service and GPS and music playing the entire time. Have had it for two years I'd say and it still works great despite being dropped in the snow occasionally and falling out of my bike bag

Nexus,2kyhus,NOTashwin,2,Sat Nov 1 20:56:35 2014 UTC,I don't really see the big deal if it on'y installs My Account. Are you really so picky about it being clean that you can't stand even having one app to show your usage?
Nexus,2kyhus,MrBamHam,1 point,Mon Nov 3 00:47:40 2014 UTC,"You're right, it's not a big deal on T-Mobile. But I plan on using Verizon.

Also there is the play music website which is like iTunes even though it is not desktop software. Similar concept though. I saw a thread on here a while back about connecting a sixaxis to lollipop. Do not remember the answer. Yes, speakers are full stereo Cannot speak from experience here, but everything I have read has said it is better than the moto x camera. Most everything about the camera seems positive so far. Depends on the game. Some can take you into ""full screen"" mode where they disappear until you swipe up from the bottom/top. So it depends."
Nexus,2kvgys,ExpAwesome,1 point,Fri Oct 31 13:11:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the answers :). The thing with iTunes is, I organize my music through it all the time. I rarely edit file info before I import it into iTunes. So I'm trying to find a solution which will allow me to sort of import my iTunes music with all information to my upcoming Nexus so that I don't have to go through the hassle of re-editing 8gb of music."
Nexus,2kvgys,jiml78,2,Fri Oct 31 20:27:32 2014 UTC,Not natively.  Doubletwist will use your itunes library and wirelessly sync with your phone(s).   Don't know about the rest.
Nexus,2kvgys,ExpAwesome,1 point,Fri Oct 31 15:11:19 2014 UTC,"Double twist works well, but there are plenty that do similar tasks.   But really, just use Google Play Music and you will have all your songs synced automatically all the time. Just cache the ones you want to listen to offline. Never touch a desktop music program again."
Nexus,2kvgys,jiml78,1 point,Fri Oct 31 18:57:38 2014 UTC,"Don't disagree (I don't use double twist).  But if we are just talking any options, I would also throw Amazon Music.

I imagine the more noticeable thing will be how the aspect-ratio manifests. Check this article out for more info on the topic of choosing aspect ratio.

The only reason I'm getting an N5 is because they already use an android device. So they don't have to learn a new OS. It's not ginormous like say the Nexus 6 or OPO and that's what I can afford off contract. Else I would have gone with a Lumia, Iphone 6 or Xperia device.  The reason I said camera is because it would be nice for them to play around with the phones camera when they don't have their dslr with them.  Still not the biggest issue but it would be a nice to have."

Nexus,2kv7gf,raghiid,1 point,Fri Oct 31 17:01:13 2014 UTC,Thanks. I can't believe I missed this in the reviews.  Question about your current spigen for whatever model you have - is it safe to assume that a non-defective product is going to fit my buttons well and have a big enough space for plugs?
Nexus,2kv7gf,raghiid,2,Fri Oct 31 17:40:02 2014 UTC,"I have the Spigen Ultra Hybrid, it looks great and feels fantastic in the hand in terms of grippy-ness and protection. The buttons were not particularly sensitive for me, but every so often I will try to press the power button and end up changing the volume. The only problem for me is that the back of the Nexus is tapered off at the sides and the case back is flat. Dust and junk gets into it through the crevices of the various openings. It is not a major issue though. It doesn't add that much bulk(and you get used to it quickly), but feels more secure in the hand which makes a world of difference when you are on the go. I have it in black and it is still pristine after months of heavy wear. I don't have headphones with large plugs so I cant help you there, but the opening isn't tight in any way, there is some size to it."

That being said it is a big phone but it has a great screen and battery. I would say the N6 seems like it is not as durable and has a smaller battery. One thing about the droid that is all preference/looks is the the 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen are permanent and not apart of the screen.
Nexus,2kucks,Blood0fMyBlood,1 point,Fri Oct 31 02:12:23 2014 UTC,"in my opinion here are the main points to decide on:  1)size (5.2 vs 6) 2)unlocking the boot loader (droid wont be as easy) 3)battery life (droid will likely last almost twice as long?) 3) capacititive buttons (droid) vs on screen buttons (n6)... this may be petty but it is a big deal for me.  i hate the the droit buttons.  plus once lollipop comes out, they will forever look dated."

I wouldn't be surprised if they were using scripts to grab the first batch of orders.  I get that it's sold out, but I don't see the logic behind not letting us have a true pre-ordering system. Instead, a lot of us spent a lot of time just F5ing the hell out of that page.  I think it's really just Google saying: ""Yeah, you want this phone?

Nexus,2koya8,cheeto0,3,Wed Oct 29 19:05:03 2014 UTC,"Google is likely trying to sell more through carriers than through the Play Store. I would guess they make more revenue selling to carriers. They're on all major networks right now and people are going to be signing up for 2-year contracts with bloated monthly contracts.  I was mashing F5 on all four pages. Only the white model came up for availability. Added it to my cart -- and it immediately refreshed to ""your cart is empty"".  I would guess that Google is selling in waves, rather than continuously. There's no way they would have a few seconds of availability."

Nexus,2koya8,DrDexterMorgan,3,Wed Oct 29 18:15:43 2014 UTC,"All other previous Nexus models offered via carriers used Vanilla Android, even for CDMA networks (Sprint). I'm not aware of any Verizon Nexus phones, but I'm sure they were out there.   Unfortunately, any Nexus on CDMA networks suffered delays in getting firmware updates, although the wait wasn't that long. Nexus 5s on Sprint I believe had MSL codes (Master Subsidy Lock) and therefore couldn't be switched onto another network without a firmware flash and the unlock code, meaning you had to complete your contract.  I could be wrong, but that's what I remember (off the top of my head)."

They'll redirect you to their contingency department when you threaten to cancel. It is unacceptable for them to do so when the upgrade date is only a few days away.

Nexus,2kp5ml,Meekajahama,0,Thu Oct 30 00:52:27 2014 UTC,"Everyone was calling this a preorder. By definition that means before release and before stock is built up. But the fact that this was in the thousands is a joke. Apple ""pre-orders"" hit 4 million. Yeah Google isn't Apple, but a couple thousand is nothing. They should have pushed back longer and had a bigger stock.   Look at the outrage going on all over the android subreddits. They have fucked this up with every major supplier for years. Asus, Samsung, LG and now motorola.   Google can't launch a hardware project if their lives depended on it. Hint: it doesn't.   They don't make any money off the nexus program. Other companies have to get it right because it is what they do. If Apple fucked up an iPhone launch it would mean millions and millions of unhappy customers and billions in lost revenue. They can't afford to fuck it up. Google doesn't care. They do it every time. No statements or apologies, just silence.   If Apple had a bomb like the nexus Q people would call for Tim Cook to be fired and bloggers would talk about it for years ""how did this almost ship?"" But Google just moves on, whatever.   They were even taking preorders for the nexus player before the FCC even approved it so they had to shut it down until that process was done. That is a basic step, something so simple I can't believe Google just forgot about it and put it up for preorder early."

Nexus phones are still intended to be developer phones, a showcase of what android is supposed to be as envisioned by google.  Also historically when they sold on contract they didn't come with bloatware. People often reference the galaxy nexus on verizon. But if you recall, Nexus S also was sold on contract through Best Buy (T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T I believe). I got my nexus s on contract and it came with zero bloatware and fully unlockable."

To be honest, most of the carriers have been pretty mum on the topic so it may be worthwhile to check out both websites and see if they have carrier pricing at the time of pre-orders.   If you are talking about the $699 unlocked version it should work just fine on Sprint."

Nexus 5 has stock Android directly from Google, while OPO has CyanogenMod.   It all depends on what you like. The better processor and more ram won't really affect the performance that much, so my decision would come down to the camera, the size of the screen, and the OS. If you feel like upgrading to a bigger screen, then go for the OPO. If you feel that taking pictures is very  important, then go for the OPO. If you feel that you need timely updates or love stock Android, then go for the Nexus 5. If you love to flash roms and don't care about stock Android, go for the OPO. It all comes down to your preferences."

Nexus,2km29t,littleemp,0,Wed Oct 29 14:39:49 2014 UTC,"There's really no right answer here.  Although I like tablets, I'm personally more willing to invest money in my phone than a new tablet because the phone is a more important and integral device to me.  That said, I already have a tablet. If you don't have a tablet at all, it could be a good buy, especially since your current phone is still fairly new.  It might be worth considering that the Nexus 6's size could be enough to make the tablet seem unnecessary. I know that personally, with the advent of super-sized phones, I'm waiting for more choices in the market of super-sized tablets before I upgrade my tablet (currently an iPad 3)."
Nexus,2km29t,littleemp,0,Tue Oct 28 23:05:11 2014 UTC,"HTC One M8:  It can be converted into an HTC One M8 GPE, so you can be first in line for updates if you want. It uses a Snapdragon 801 already, so the Nexus 6 would only be marginally faster. (Probably not even noticeable outside of benchmarks)  Nexus 6:  Pretty much the best phone there is going to be out there for a while. I don't consider crap from other manufacturers as potential options, because I only care about having the ""Google Experience"" not the cancer ridden crap from Samsung or their ilk. No Drawbacks outside of the financial hit.  Nexus 9:  I used my N7 2012 to read comics, browse the web, reddit, and pretty much anything else I would use my phone for when I am around the house (I put my phone down usually when I'm at home for everything except messaging). For me it was definitely worth it buying a new tablet, because I will use it. Do you think that you'll get as much use of it? If so, you might want to consider getting it. The difference between reading Ultra HD comics in 215-220 ppi and 280-290 ppi is VERY noticeable, especially with a screen that is much more likely to have more vibrant colors. (And reading comics in a 5-6 inch screen versus a 9 inch screen is quite different)     What I would do in your situation: Convert the HTC One to a GPE version and buy a Nexus 9 (16 or 32GB depending on your usage), because the difference in day-to-day performance between the One M8 and N6 will be negligible at worst.  My final piece of advice: Get whatever you actually want to get that'll make you happy."

Nexus,2kkpns,Monroeshindelar,3,Tue Oct 28 21:20:10 2014 UTC,"Maybe. Verizon has little but contempt for unlocked devices. The Nexus 7 debacle proved that Verizon was just making it difficult because they could. Verizon subscribers tested it by removing their SIM cards from their phones, putting them into the Nexus 7 and getting data. There wasn't any technical problems, Verizon was just being an ass.   Thus, if you have an active SIM you probably can just move the card, if you want to setup the Nexus 6 as a new phone with a new contract, you're likely in for a world of hurt as Verizon gives you either blatant lies or the run around for needing to ""certify"" the phone."
Nexus,2kkpns,Innovative_Wombat,2,Tue Oct 28 20:38:07 2014 UTC,"I think this is the right answer. N6 with existing Verizon SIM card should be good to go on Day 1, but N6 with brand new Verizon SIM card might not be able to be activated on Day 1 if Verizon doesn't support the device on Day 1."

Additionally, AFAIK VZW controls which CDMA devices are able to connect to the network via individual devices'  IMEI or MEID. This means you need to somehow register your device with VZW before activating. Hopefully its just a matter of a phone call, but it would be helpful to know more about the official process."
Nexus,2kkpns,madduffy,1 point,Tue Oct 28 16:15:02 2014 UTC,"OTA updates that could fix possible carrier issues or provide carrier features could come from the carrier, but OS/system updates will come from google.

Nexus,2kkpns,markgbe,1 point,Tue Oct 28 16:29:04 2014 UTC,Hopefully they (VZW) aren't as clueless/ignorant of their own systems as Sprint is. It was and still is VERY difficult to convince Sprint that your unlocked Google Play N5 can be activated on their network and for them to give you a SIM card. Heck half the stores don't even realize they have phones that use SIM cards!

I'm currently on Sprint (with a completed contract) and I plan to move over to At&t while upgrading to the N6 in one move.    If I buy the N6 from Google Play store, will I be able to activate it and move over to At&t on my own--ie, online, without going to a store (I'm a college student living on campus and that would be extremely inconvenient)?"

Nexus,2kkpns,bramper,2,Tue Oct 28 19:25:25 2014 UTC,"Sometimes there is the option of having the carrier send you the programmed sim through the mail, and you just stick it into your phone. Not completely sure in your case, though. I don't blame you for not wanting to go to a store... Something else you might try if you have the availability is take your phone to ATT now, and sign up for a new plan with them. That way, when you N6 arrives, you can just switch the sim over and you're set."

There are also higher gauge wires also that help."
Nexus,2km4gl,aznalan15,1 point,Wed Oct 29 15:36:14 2014 UTC,"However, if a cable complies with the USB standard it should be able to accommodate any amperage that is also within the USB standard. Unless you go with an extraordinarily cheap USB cable you don't really run the risk over over-amping the cable, and if you did the cable would still pass the current it would just get hot (which is not good).   Personally I would say with about 99% certainty that the USB cable is not the problem."

You can't draw any conclusions from this comparison you're making simply because there are no parallels between the two cases. If the US version can get the frequencies that you need, then there's no reason for anyone to believe that it will perform any different. With that said, be absolutely sure that it does provides all the bands that you require."

The GPS image gallery for the blue model and the Motorola page for the blue model both show a horrible-looking blue border, but the page at http://google.com/nexus/6/ shows both models having silver, with the blue one only looking slightly darker/bluer. I tried asking GPS support and they said I needed to ask Moto, so I did and they said nobody in their support center had been able to see one in person yet so they could only vouch for what Moto's website says.  This is probably the biggest reason I am waiting to buy; I want to see it in person first. I like the blue back more, but if there is really that much of a difference on the edge color, I will go with white.

We do have a page with information about on our site. May I send you a link to this page today?   http://www.att.com/cellphones/motorola/nexus-6.html#fbid=5X9b_fSx4WI  The rep then went on to say that if ordering through Google on 10/29 it would be purchased at Google's cost with no AT&T subsidized pricing.

Nexus,2kmjg4,rpungello,2,Wed Oct 29 00:18:11 2014 UTC,"First of all, do you own a Mac?  One of the main benefits of the 6+ comes from its interoperability with OS X (this is actually one of the reasons I'm considering leaving Android for a 6+). However, there are third-party apps for Android that can give you many of the same features (Pushbullet, for starters).  That said, as someone who has used both platforms extensively, here's my thoughts on the matter.  iOS is a great operating system. It's (usually) fairly stable, the security/privacy is arguably superior to Android (being able to approve/deny permissions at will is better than having to accept all permissions or not install the app), and the app selection is (in general) better.  However, at the end of the day, it really feels like you're using Apple's phone, not your phone. Don't like something? Sucks to be you, because you probably can't change it (without jailbreaking and sacrificing updates).  This is where Android is different. Don't like the launcher? Go to the Play Store and download a new one, no root required. Don't like the lock screen? Again, get a new one. Yes, there are some things that require root, but at least with the Nexus line, you can always re-root after updating the OS.  Same goes for inter-app communication. For example, Android apps can even intercept URLs and forward them to the correct mobile app (so if you get an email for an Amazon item, tapping it will open the Amazon app, not the site). You get default apps, so you're not strong-armed into using the stock apps.  Then there's the little things:   3rd-party keyboards on Android are also vastly superior to the ones on iOS, since they've been around since the beginning. The back button is easier to reach (though sometimes can cause unexpected behavior) Better multitasking (though this does make it easier for poorly written apps to kill your battery) Apps can control/monitor system functions (I have apps that can monitor CPU/RAM usage and network/disk I/O) Xposed Framework (allows you to easily tweak basically anything, as long as you're rooted)   If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask."
Nexus,2kmjg4,rpungello,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:44:20 2014 UTC,"I have owned on, but right now, I do not. I've tried turning my windows PC into a Hackintosh to get the full experience, but it turned out to be ridiculously hard for my specific combination of hardware, so I gave up on that dream. I'm now running Windows 10 DP though, so it wasn't all too bad.   In terms of privacy, the FBI is cracking down on both Android and iOS for their updated security in their latest iterations of their OS', so I'm willing to say that they're fairly equal. Also, 5.0 SEEMS to have stepped it up a bit on a per-app basis from what I've seen?   That inter-app communication is an entirely new thing to me though, I've never actually heard of it before? Can you provide me with a link to where that is shown? I'd love to see it in action.   1. 3rd party keyboards will inevitably get better at a rapid tempo. But as it stands, you're absolutely correct. 2. Well. Here's one massive complaint I have with Android. in iOS I can just swipe left and right to go back/forward. I've watched a few videos and it seems that Android completely lacks that functionality? That is a large issue I'd have though. The irregularity of the back button is also something which frightens me a bit. MKBHD also discussed that part in a nearly cynical manner. 3. I really prefer the multitasking of iOS over the Lollipop version though. It somehow looks cleaner to me. But that's a minor thing. I hardly spend more than 5 seconds in it regardless. 4. Widgets allow this as well on iOS since iOS8. Vidget is a prime example of that. Not sure about controlling them though, that might definitely be a plus for Android. 5. Yeah, absolutely no clue what this is. I've been out of the Android game for too long I think to know this (SGS3/XE were my last ones. And only toyed around with an unrooted M7 and M8 of my best friend for a bit) Could you tell me more about this?"
Nexus,2kmjg4,dereksalem,1 point,Wed Oct 29 13:38:09 2014 UTC,"I haven't heard anything about Lollipop changing the permissions at all, and my Nexus 4 (which has the L dev preview on it), doesn't seem to have any way of revoking permissions (without mods, at least).  Android has a few different methods of facilitating inter-app communication, which I'll try to explain as simply as possible (not sure what your technical background is).  The first is the intent system. Basically, Android apps are composed of activities. An activity has the ability to tell Android to show a different activity, even from a different app. You can also attach data to the request to switch activities. For apps made by the same developer, they can explicitly tell app A to load a specific view from app B (and pass along any data needed to properly show the view from app B). There are also what I believe are called intent filters. These allow apps to declare a general feature they offer (sending an email, viewing a location on a map, etc...) that any app can call into to perform the desired action. For example, if you want to display something on Google Maps, you don't need to embed anything in your app. You can use intents to call into the actual Google Maps app, which will then display the location.  The other big one is content providers. These basically allow an app to act as a database (of sorts) to other apps. This could allow you to have one main app, and various helper apps that all use the data from the main app.   Yep, I'm sure within a year iOS keyboards will be dramatically improved. Android does have quite a few swipe gestures. Apps that use action bar tabs usually allow swiping between tabs. However, unlike iOS, a swipe in from the left-hand edge of the screen usually brings up a drawer containing extra functionality. One nice thing about Lollipop is that apps can now have separate entries in the multitasking view. So, for example, a browser could show all your tabs there. I could see this being annoying if you have lots of tabs, so I'm hoping there's a way to disable it if that's the case (maybe even on a per-app basis). Already, so it looks like you can monitor system functions, but I'm guessing you can't change them. There are Android apps that can, for example, silence your phone for you given some predefined criteria - something I like, and Apple doesn't allow I don't have a ton of experience (haven't used Xposed yet myself), but from what I can tell, it basically makes it really easy to mod your phone. Traditionally, if you wanted to change the OS at a low level, you have to use a custom ROM (basically a modified version of Android). Xposed lets you install modules that can make system-wide changes, and can be easily turned on and off at will."
Nexus,2kmjg4,PrancingPeach,0,Wed Oct 29 23:01:11 2014 UTC,"This is pretty much my entire feeling on the matter. I use both iOS and Android regularly, and have owned probably every bigname phone for both operating systems since their respective inceptions, and I couldn't agree more.  I like iOS for very specific things, but for my daily driver I can't stand to use it for longer than a few days. My work phone right now is iOS, but anytime I'm using it as my primary phone for awhile I start to pick apart the problems I have with it. With Android, I don't do that because as soon as I notice something I don't like I just change it. Granted, I'm a bit more of a power user than the average joe, but I haven't even rooted my Nexus 5 or done anything extensive with it...I'm using almost all stock stuff."

These are expensive phones. Don't beat yourself up over whatever decision you make, since it's one you're likely to live with for a few years.  The 6+ has a lot going for it: Touch ID and Apple Pay and the best camera on the market to name a few. iOS also tends to get apps first before Android. As an Android user, I basically just stopped browsing Product Hunt when I realized every mobile app was only on iOS. If you're into the Apple Watch, you'll need an iPhone too.  Advantages of the Nexus 6:   Much larger screen (nearly an extra half inch!). The phone itself is barely any bigger, though. Wireless charging. Double tap to wake. Lollipop is amazingly polished and very iOS-like, but it's still Android and you can change basically any aspect of it. Google has a very strong ecosystem on par with Apple's. I personally really like what Google Now has grown into and am excited to see where it goes, and Android has very strong integration with it.   As a final comment, I personally use Macs as my main computers, but I like Android phones so I'm not just totally sucked up into Apple's ecosystem. It's nice to get the best of both worlds."

I even have a plan which allows me to upgrade each year.   I must agree on the Touch ID part, it's absolutely magnificent, I've never been able to unlock a phone (securely) this fast, and it really prevents other users from accessing my phone. Apple Pay isn't available in The Netherlands, and I don't really expect it to be any time soon either.   In terms of apps, that's where my largest fear lies. As you mentioned, iOS tends to receive the new apps first. Instagrams Hyperlapse is a good example of that. I'm sure a lot of the apps will make their way to Android sooner or later. But I'm afraid of being left out of a lot of apps and games primarily.   As far as the Apple Watch goes. It surely looks interesting, but so do the Android Wear watches. But, until they can make it so that I can actually wear one for a week before I need to recharge the thing, I think I'll stick to my analogue one.   The screen is definitely a plus. Higher resolution and size while the overall device is only 1 mm taller. Double Tap to wake isn't all that important for me. Lollipop seems so bloody polished, I just wished they'd keep the old multitasking of Android 4.4.   You've listed some good points though :)"
Nexus,2kmjg4,lightbeat,0,Wed Oct 29 12:56:12 2014 UTC,"I'll mirror what ADubs62 said...Apple Pay is somewhat a non-issue. Google has Google Wallet, which is essentially the same thing. The reason it makes no difference is that any place that supports Apple Pay will also support Google Wallet (because it's the same technology). Either Android or iOS will be able to do an NFC payment then.  TouchID is a huge benefit that only iOS has. None of the fingerprint sensors for Android have been even unremarkably useful, with most of them barely working at all. TouchID is super easy to use, and damn near infallible in the way it works. That's huge.  As for the Apple Watch/Android Wear argument...I currently have an Android Wear watch paired to my daily driver and love it, but I don't have much interest in Apple Watch. It doesn't look like an Apple device, and from what I've seen of the functionality it also doesn't work like an Apple device. My mind may change, but at the moment I have little hope that the Apple Watch will take off like they hope it will. It almost seems like Apple is just hoping their fans will buy it regardless. I'm sure iteration 2 (or 3) will be wonderful, but the initial implementation looks bad (and everyone I've spoken to agreed...even the most die-hard Apple fans)."

I know you have access to google apps on iOS but as you imagine they are not as well integrated as with android, which is understandable. Googles apps are better than anything apple's own made apps have to offer with the exception of iTunes for music.  Hardware wise.... Well, very personal what you like but I can say with some certainty that the screen will be better and bigger on the N6 (and without being a much bigger phone) and performance difference between the two negligible.

It seems that the biggest factor currently is customizability with all the risks involved in that compared to simplicity which (most of the time) just does what it's supposed to. I agree that performance difference, if any, is going to be negligible.   preliminary tests have shown that the iPhone camera does a better job than the Note 4 camera in most situations (read: everything but zoom) but I hardly use it aside from taking the occasional selfie, so that's not too big of a deal for me. It's not like I'm going out to take 50+ pictures of flowers and whatnot.   It seems that google is holding back development on their iOS counterparts knowingly. The latest YouTube app can't even hold on to 1080p streaming. While the browser and 3rd party apps do it perfectly fine. It's annoying."

However what I think is really important is that for me, the future of Android and Google looks just so much more interesting and promising than that of Apple.  Design-wise, not only does it feel like Apple is playing catch up in some aspects, they seem to be progressing ever more slowly (iPad Mini 3 tho...).  For example, compare the design intentions of iOS 7 and Lollipop (the visual overhauls).  iOS 7 seemed to be all about prettying things up. Adding a dash of translucency here, some glass there, flattening some interfaces up.  Material Design, in the end, achieved something of the same: making things look nicer, feel better, but did so not in any arbitrary way at all.  Material Design was built from the foundations, with physics and rules.  On the other hand, Google/Android seems to be finally exploding onto the scene.  They had a rocky start I'd say, and even to this day many people believe Android is still the laggy, unresponsive operating system it was a few years ago.  The truth is, so many people in the US have been with iOS for so long, they don't know what Android is like and have never used it.  Sure I'm biased when I say that Android looks amazing with Lollipop because I'm an Android fan, but I'm not ignorant of iOS either.  I'm actually currently on an iPhone because my S4 broke!"
Nexus,2kmjg4,ADubs62,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:52:07 2014 UTC,"Funny that you should mention that in America so many people use iPhones. In Europe it seems to be the exact opposite. iPhones are not seen as often, at least here in The Netherlands, 9/10 people I know own Android devices. Funnily enough, it's almost always the females who are the owners of iPhones for some reason.   But in essence. Both iOS 8 and Android 5 are just mostly aesthetically different from their predecessors right? iOS 8 does offer a new programming language as well as a new graphics API which developers can use. Does google have something similar like that in Lollipop? Or is it just a very aesthically pleasing upgrade?   And yeah. Android definitely carries a stigma right now. I'm willing to look past that though. I'm not as ignorant as to believe that everything is the same as years ago. That's just simply not how technology works."

Has an excellent selection of apps and games, but they are all limited to Apple's Walled Garden, which is where my biggest gripe with it lies, because it completely stifles innovation in the most basic of ways. Developers can only do as much as Apple allows them to do, you cannot use all these cool customizations to make your device better for you.   Android (Google's Android, not other stuff from Samsung/HTC/Etc):   It is very much a blank canvas that is only as good as you can make it out to be. You don't like the keyboard? Install a new one (I know this is a thing for iOS now too), You want to actually change things around your device? Get Xposed Installer and start getting modules to change Quick Settings, add Multiwindow support, and a myriad other things. You could even install custom firmware that adds even more features such as Paranoid Android.   Windows Phone:   LOL.    The one thing I can tell you that Android will give you is freedom, but what you do with that freedom is up to you. You're clearly not concerned about hardware size or performance, because you're considering a Nexus 6 from an iPhone 6 Plus, so the question becomes ""Do you want to give up whatever you've found valuable in an Apple device for the freedom that Android gives you?""  I honestly can't think of something that an Apple device can do that an Android one cannot do, but I can think of a lot of things that are possible with Android that will not be a reality for Apple devices in the foreseeable future."

Then again, Android also needs root for a lot of things, so those have always been even for me. Especially since I'm really a minimalist.   One thing Android really does well for me, is the possibility to hide all the unwanted icons. Whereas I had to put them into a folder for my iPhone. While it is still only one extra icon. it's one icon I could definitely do without. Widgets never really interested me, as back in the day they were not much more than a battery drain and didn't do much more than the actual app itself.   I've used my stepmoms Lumia for a bit after she got her new iPhone, and I must say, it was a terrible experience. Seriously hardly any developer support.

There is also HDMI-CEC supports, so if your TV supports that (if it's not old it will) then you are already covered remote wise.   HDMI-CEC is basically a protocol for communicating to connected HDMI devices. What does that mean in practice? I can control XBMC on my RPi with my TV remote.  Edit: xbmc also has a ton of plugins, so you can also watch youtube on it and stuff like that, or even stream torrents.

Most of the them have built in ads that you can't disable (even though you paid for the product - be it a tv or player). This is enough to make any smart tv interface or streaming function in the DVD/BD player unusable for me. I actually have the opinion that TVs should just do one thing: Be a TV. I'll purchase a player separately. Don't try to be all the things. Same goes for DVD/BD player: Just do that one thing. That's all I want. The DVD/BD and smart TVs don't get software updates fast enough to justify including the functionality. I can switch out a roku or google tv every year, but the TV I'm going to keep for at least 5 to 10 years and during that time, the ""smart"" interface is never going to get updated.   ChromeCast is still on the market   ...which is a different product, because it requires your phone to operate. Nexus tv doesn't. I can't say that I'll reliably have my phone within arm's reach at all times when I'm at home, but I know for a fact that if I'm on the living room couch, there's definitely going to be a remote within reach."
Nexus,2kgr4n,ProfWhite,2,Mon Oct 27 17:43:16 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with you about the general shitiness of the GUI in Smart TV's and DVD/BD players. You are at the mercy of the manufacturer and the content provider to update the software and this is terrible at best.  I liken how I want today's TV's to be by how my HTPC operates: a dummy monitor, a separate device that controls GUI and content (PC), and external devices that store data (hard drives, DVD/BD player/NAS). That is why I am confused by Google's choice to not include, at a minimum, the ability to add peripherals (USB to storage devices).  This would allow you to throw out the DVD/BD player or integrate your media library into the player.  What was released just adds another device to the mix and it doesn't appeal to a larger market."

I'd imagine you'll be able to do the same thing with the nexus player. IMO, the nexus player is really just a replacement for the roku - they have essentially the same functionality.   And as far as DVD/BD goes, I rent a BD from redbox maybe once every few months. I have a cheap BD player that I got off amazon for $30 that does the trick. If you use DVD/BD more often, however, I'd say a good solution would be a HTPC somewhere in your house with storage and BD player built in, and then hosting the PC on your player in the living room or wherever a-la PLEX or something similar.  I haven't personally used a HTPC attached to my tv in a long time, though, because the main 60"" tv in the living room is hung on the wall, and the roku, set-top box, and BD player I have strapped to the back of the tv to hide all the wires.

For gaming on your sofa you buy a $400 console with lots of titles and modern graphics. For gaming on-the-go you buy Android device.

However, at $99, if they release an updated Nexus Player every year, three years from now you could buy every iteration, and have only spent $400 (assuming you horde the old ones, net could be less if you re-sold them)   At the rate mobile processors are advancing, it's going to be damn close to the current gen, considering unlike X360/PS3 this gen was sold at a profit, with old hardware on X86 processors(a familiar structure for devs), meaning there will NOT be a huge, almost exponential gain in console graphics that we saw last generation.  Plus with apps like Limelight, this thing can stream your $400 gaming PC to the box and have it hidden away in a behind tv mount."

That being said, when people come over they're lost. When people are using something at my house, they want something that's super simple to use. An AppleTV is so powerful for that very reason - they can use the tiny remote because it's incredibly intuitive, but if it doesn't do everything they want they can just beam (AirPlay) content directly from their phones. This is something that can't really be done with the HTPC.  The Nexus Player is great for this situation because it can just ""do it"".

These typically perform kinda shitty. I have a brand new Sony Smart TV And even though it's new and fairly high end, the smart tv functionality is still very sluggish.

Google Player could replace the need for a BD player if it had a drive   This actually could have been a really good idea, but I think the downside to this would have been consumers looking at this as another blu-ray player with streaming functionality, rather as the hub for all online streaming in your family room.

Nexus,2keebd,klesmez,2,Sun Oct 26 23:15:24 2014 UTC,Luckily most displays will come with the digitizer and glass attached to it already.   I'd say you first check with the seller to see if anything can be done before attempting to fix it yourself.

Nexus,2kebpj,LoThro,10,Sun Oct 26 20:22:23 2014 UTC,I remember reading that Google has planned this out because they did not want the Nexus name to be synonymous with a particular manufacturer. They want the Nexus line to be as diverse as possible.
Nexus,2kebpj,ANotSoSlyFox,3,Sun Oct 26 21:49:08 2014 UTC,They're still producing Nexus 5s and probably have an Android Silver phone in development (if it ever becomes a reality). It's the perfect candidate to replace Google Play edition and make it mainstream.
Nexus,2kebpj,isaifu,4,Mon Oct 27 01:59:26 2014 UTC,Google made the nexus line famous...not LG.   It's probably more fair to say that Nexus made LG famous than the other way around.
Nexus,2kebpj,pfc_bgd,0,Tue Oct 28 00:33:19 2014 UTC,"Personally, I have a lot more respect for LG since I owned 2 Nexus devices with little hardware issues."
Nexus,2kebpj,RedTib,3,Tue Oct 28 00:40:36 2014 UTC,"I believe they went with Motorola for two reasons. One, as stated in a previous comment, to mix it up a bit and see what a different manufacturer brought to the table; and secondly because Motorola is a higher quality brand than LG.  Also, there was a period in which Google owned Motorola, but for the most part, they pieced it out and sold it in chunks, including the handset division. They only ended up keeping some of the patents I believe from that deal. It is possible they worked in a deal to the sale of the handset division of Motorola to create an exclusive partnership in the Nexus series down the line, which they may be calling on here.   Frankly, I am much more likely to buy a Motorola Nexus rather than an LG/Samsung/HTC Nexus, even if it costs a bit more, because I believe the quality will be a bit higher."

I've heard the possibility of a delay until after the end of the year, depending on the region. It is my guess they are focusing all of the production to meet US demand first, and then once the stock is under control, work on meeting the demand for the rest of the world.  I would urge caution in ordering the US version of the phone outside of the US/Canada, as I've heard stories in the past about chargers not being the same, and network issues as well."

Kitkat runs well on an Galaxy S2 via Cygenmod. The iPhone 4S on iOS8 is a brick.   So even if the Nexus 6 doesn't get more than 2 year support, the unlocked bootloader and Android's push for less hardware should ensure you can get the newest Android and it will run just fine."

Not to mention it can access flash drives via the Nexus Media Importer app. Couple that with the Dice Player and it can handle any format you throw at it.   As for 5.0, Google seems committed to running on less and less hardware so I'd imagine it will run well. Also, due to the staggered release (aka, not Apple's come and get our broken patches), the update process should be smooth."

Plus, Apple's whole new OS thing is designed to leave devices out in the cold to make you upgrade. That pisses me off.

Everything Google has done indicates that they will continue to support older devices as long as the device is capable of running the update; and at the same time, refining the updates so that they can be supported by more devices. Also, Lollipop itself is designed to be future-proof, with radical unbundling of components from the OS, allowing more to be updated from the App Store than ever before. This means that, even if you find a future Android update isn't optimized for your system, you'll likely be able to continue running the latest app updates if you get stuck on an OS version (and whenever Android 6 is released, it's almost certain the Nexus 5 will be supported).  This and the low price is why I just bought a N5 to replace my dead HTC One."
Nexus,2k8sdq,littleemp,4,Thu Oct 30 02:39:32 2014 UTC,"I would expect for as long as the Nexus 6 does barring any hardware limitations between the two. The snapdragon 805 is only an incremental upgrade over the 800, so if something doesn't run well on the 800, it is very unlikely that it will run well in the 805."
Nexus,2k8sdq,Beaverbeliever2,1 point,Sat Oct 25 00:35:54 2014 UTC,It almost feels like we're at a point where these incremental updates seem unnecessary except to just make more money.
Nexus,2k8sdq,ssswca,1 point,Sat Oct 25 01:34:21 2014 UTC,Especially because for the past few years mobile tech has been ahead of Moore's law by a fair margin. Things will start to slow down soon.
Nexus,2k8sdq,galazam_jones,1 point,Sat Oct 25 02:44:32 2014 UTC,I think the Nexus 5 to 6 is more than just a small incremental update. It is a pretty big jump.
Nexus,2k8sdq,Sevenlore,1 point,Mon Oct 27 19:36:02 2014 UTC,"The Nexus 6 isn't an ""update"" to the Nexus 5."
Nexus,2k8k1a,so-cal_kid,8,Fri Oct 24 22:05:32 2014 UTC,I don't think so. The nexus 6 isn't meant to replace the 5.
Nexus,2k8k1a,bastienvans,1 point,Fri Oct 24 22:28:24 2014 UTC,There was a price drop of the nexus 4 but it happened before the nexus 5 launch. I think the phone does cost a little less to make compared to launch date but not by much. It's still a great deal. Google has nothing to win by lowering the price. They're selling like hot buns since the N6 was announced! I'm thinking buying one myself!
Nexus,2k8k1a,badtrippatate,-1,Fri Oct 24 23:52:35 2014 UTC,"Why would there be? It's not like production for the Nexus 5 became magically cheaper or it is being phased out and they are trying to move the last of the available stock. FYI, people working with customers, more often than not, have no idea what they are talking about, because they don't care to inform themselves beyond of what it is expected of them."
Nexus,2k8k1a,littleemp,5,Fri Oct 24 22:59:14 2014 UTC,"Actually, the Nexus 5 should be cheaper in manufacturing as S800 drops in price as does the rest of the hardware. Apple still offered the iPhone 4 in India because its manufacturing costs for it dropped so low they could sell it at low prices and still hit their expected margins. As time goes on, the older parts should drop in prices. But given that it is JUST $349 we shouldn't be complaining."
Nexus,2k8k1a,Innovative_Wombat,1 point,Sun Oct 26 07:22:14 2014 UTC,"Except I could've had this phone for a year already for the same price, so I'm going to complain. This phone should be cheaper, as it is cheaper to manufacture now, and Google not marking it down is a huge slap in the face to anyone that was hoping for either a refreshed Nexus 5 or price drop, which seemed like the entirety of /r/Nexus until just a couple weeks ago."
Nexus,2k8k1a,Omnibitent,1 point,Mon Oct 27 13:05:05 2014 UTC,"At the end of the day, the Nexus 5 is the cheapest Nexus on the market right now, so Google really doesn't need to drop the price at all, as it is already serving its purpose."

Intuitively I feel like Google's preorder wouldn't start later than a carrier preorder, so here on the east coast I'm going to be up at 3 refreshing that page."

Nexus,2k7h2v,markgbe,1 point,Fri Oct 24 19:54:57 2014 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't really matter since the phone is going to be available from all four major service providers. The quickest way to get the phone is to go to a retail store on launch day and buy it there."
Nexus,2k7h2v,pebbleman,2,Sat Oct 25 03:14:58 2014 UTC,"I thought so too, but after hearing others and doing research myself, it seems like buying from the Play Store is the way to go.  I would save ~$45 by buying off amazon(free ship + 5% chase rewards), but I would have to deal with Motorola directly if something went wrong, whereas if you bought it from the Play Store, you would deal with Google customer service which seems stellar. If it came down to it, Google would send you your replacement phone to use before you send off your broken phone."
Nexus,2k7h2v,phobs,1 point,Sun Oct 26 08:19:13 2014 UTC,Does the Play store have really good warranty support? Wouldn't they just shuffle you off to the manufacturer since they're just a retailer?
Nexus,2k7h2v,ddbaxte,1 point,Sun Oct 26 20:31:20 2014 UTC,"Are the carriers going to offer the same off-contract price as google play store, or will they be charging $100-150 more like T-mobile did for the N4&5?"
Nexus,2k7h2v,sandiegossd,1 point,Sat Oct 25 17:22:46 2014 UTC,"I think a lot of people assume pricing will be the same across the board (unless the carriers feel like offering a discount/incentive). Why?  To my understanding, the Nexus 5 was ""subsidized"" by Google and Sprint/T-Mobile were paying full price, meaning that they had to charge the additional $100 or whatever for the phone.  The Nexus 6, on the other hand, is very obviously not subsidized by Google and that $650 price tag should stick to every carrier selling the phone.  Or not, that's just what I've gotten from reading around."
Nexus,2k7h2v,aznalan15,2,Sat Oct 25 19:17:51 2014 UTC,"what's the on-contract price gonna be, you think?"
Nexus,2k7h2v,sandiegossd,1 point,Sat Oct 25 22:30:46 2014 UTC,"Assuming they do contract pricing for it, I'd say between $199 and $299. For reference, the Droid Turbo (which is similar to the Nexus 6 and is coming out on Verizon) is $199 on contract or $599 without."
Nexus,2k7h2v,sandiegossd,1 point,Sat Oct 25 23:31:03 2014 UTC,"I am on the same boat, looking to order one as soon as it is up.  Stupid iPhone 3gs not cutting it."

Nexus,2k2erf,antuna,0,Thu Oct 23 17:36:26 2014 UTC,"OK so nexus 4 was 4.7"", closer to 5 than 4. And this may be apples to oranges but I feel it's valid, but, a 1tb HDD typically has around 929-932gb of free space as opposed to true 1tb. Now if the nexus numbers were a measure of inches and not generation, then the nexus 4 would've been nexus 5(2012) and nexus 5 would've been nexus 5 (2013) whereas the tablets are inches, not generational numbers. Now, let's say you're right, they simply dropped the decimal on the nexus 4 and called it nexus 4 because not only was it 4th generation, it had 4.x"" and so then with 5 and 6 it was so close to 5"" and 6"" that they just rounded up AND kept generation number.

Nexus,2jw8m7,ImNorwegian,17,Tue Oct 21 15:24:18 2014 UTC,"The complaints I've heard which compare it to the prior Nexi are legitimate: bigger, more expensive, aesthetically similar to Moto X 2014. The people arguing these points probably wanted a second generation Nexus 5 and there's clearly a market for such a device.  However, plenty of people have noticed the positive differences from past Nexi: zero specs compromised, premium build quality throughout (expected), one model available on all major US carriers (VZW customers rejoice), front facing speakers, and active display which is likely exclusive to the 6 due to the Motorola partnership. There's definitely a market for this device among users who want zero compromise from their device's hardware and software and see that the package is a good value at 650-700 USD.  Everyone has their own personal dream phone, so of course an individual feels like they have to compromise their desires when there is only a single new Nexus phone each year. This phone doesn't have everything I wanted, but it is objectively an excellent device and I'm excited that the Nexus 6 is providing something different from the Nexus 5."
Nexus,2jw8m7,madduffy,3,Tue Oct 21 17:30:56 2014 UTC,"I don't think active display is due to the moto partnership. Google owns the patents now, but it requires an amoled screen to do it. Nexus 6 has one, nexus 5 doesn't."

The s5 really felt like it was at the edge of what I was comfortable using, I ended up going back to the moto x.  Even at 6 inches I'm still considering this phone but I would have gladly plunked down the 650 for an ~ 5 inch screen, no questions asked."

Comparison specs note 4 vs nexus 6 so let's see. Better cameras. SD card. Ir blaster. Slightly smaller. Replaceable battery (hopefully an extended battery by ZeroLemon too,) the S Pen, and multiwindow multitasking. What's not to love about the note 4? Especially when you root and remove preinstalled apps you don't want.  Edit: I'm far from a Samsung fanboy. I've had Motorola droid, HTC thunderbolt,HTC evo 3d, samsung galaxy nexus, HTC one x+, HTC one m7, and now nexus 5.

I predict it will sell better than the Nexus 6 because of the features you mentioned.  However, I feel the excitement surrounding each of the devices is even greater due to the competition. Google is bringing a solid alternative to a space dominated by Samsung. The advantages for the Nexus include its purer experience out-of-the-box, its ensured developer-friendly status (though you can get a bootloader unlockable Note 4), fast updates for 2 years, and various other capabilities.  I've always owned dev friendly devices and I've always been rewarded with great ROM and kernel options when stock android wasn't being supported anymore. My OG Droid and GNex have spoiled me in such a way that I devices requiring a ton of community effort to jailbreak are a huge turn-off for me."

The price doesn't bother me, because it obviously has some crazy specs that deserve that price, and I'll be using a student refund for it, anyway.  The bigger screen is something I really want. Like /u/DrYaklagg said, we've wanted a tablet for a while. But I don't see why I should have a phone AND a tablet, when I can just have a phablet that lets me do the same things.

The one thing the two audiences have in common is that they have an appreciation for pure Android over manufacturer skins.

Other Asus tablets with SD card support received custom ROMs that used class 10 memory to create a SD card cache.  Most people report that the issue can be solved by freeing up around 25 to 50% of the on-board storage, putting the tablet in airplane mode and idling it overnight (with Android 4.3+).

Nexus,2jxxg8,jezman,1 point,Fri Oct 24 02:19:47 2014 UTC,"Big Android fan, but I think Android devices are essentially going the Windows way. Devices start lagging a bit as things progress, new settings are added, and software gets upgraded.  My favorite trick is to do a full factory reset - that brings things back up to speed a lot. All you have to do is be a little careful about backing up stuff - too much backup and the data is back making things slow again. Too little, and you lose your progress on Candy Crush Saga or your chat history in Whatsapp :( On the other hand, Google does a great job at syncing all gmail, contact, drive information once you login to your new phone.  Not ideal, as I would like to believe that this problem was solved in mobile devices, but apparently not. And don't get me started on Samsung devices. The day I got to know off the *#9900# trick, I pretty much decided they didn't think things through.  tl;dr - do a full factory reset to bring your device back to speed. But be careful, as you may end up losing data."

There's a reason why they are keeping the Nexus 5 around, just like there is a reason that Apple made a cut down version of the iPhone with a 720p display. It is meant to be an option for another segment, not overlap with the bigger offerings. You're comparing apples to oranges.   I would not be surprised if the Moto X was just a scaled down Nexus 6 and followed suit with a very quick updates,  but that's neither here nor there.   If you want an iPhone 6, then get it, but there's no point in indulging in a charade with devices that don't overlap and, as such, won't meet your expectations because the one thing that differentiates them the most (size) is already not to your liking."

There are so many other Android devices that you can go with if you don't think the Nexus 6 is for you.

Nexus,2jvoor,ExpAwesome,2,Wed Oct 22 06:42:51 2014 UTC,"Your logic makes some sense, the new high end phone from google vs the highend phone from apple. Both are the same price so why not compare?  The thing is that they are the same price because if you buy an apple product, you pay for the brand. The nexus 6 challenges the iphone 6 plus but for a cheaper price."

But OP appears to be right in another case. iPhone 6's security design is really superior. This is because Apple controls hw and sw so they could pull that custom processor.

Nexus,2jvoor,LeoFalto,0,Tue Oct 21 20:18:39 2014 UTC,"I compared the specs and it's quite arguable... Specs are comparable - in some regions better for Nexus, other - iPhone. So hw is comparable."
Nexus,2jvoor,heap42,4,Wed Oct 22 06:39:53 2014 UTC,"Have you considered the 2014 Moto X? It's almost exactly the same physical size as the iPhone 6 despite having a larger screen (because the iPhone has enormous bezels). It also runs basically pure Android, so it's a very Nexus-like experience. To me, it's the most direct competitor of the iPhone 6. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the Nexus 6 is just a blown-up Moto X.  You really can't go wrong with an iPhone 6, though. This is a Nexus subreddit so it's going to be biased, but the iPhone is still a great phone. And it's got Touch ID and Apple Pay. And it'll be able to pair with the Apple Watch, if that's something you're interested in.  The bottom line is the Nexus line has changed. The Nexus 5 was affordable off-contract for many folks; the N6 is not. You can still pick up a Nexus 5, but the hardware is out of date these days and it doesn't offer unique features like Touch ID."
Nexus,2jvoor,TorrAbsolute,1 point,Tue Oct 21 15:11:06 2014 UTC,"If you're here, then it speaks to me that you like the Android experience.  If I'm wrong, then by all means go iPhone.  Me...I waited til the announcement because I wanted to see if they were releasing a 5.2"" Nexus, which they are not.  So I'm waiting for the Nexus 5 restock and will buy one.  Yes, I know the phone is ""old"", but the specs still put it up with many of the new phones now.  If anything, I've learned the specs aren't as big anymore compared to the OS...and how easily you get updates.  This is why I won't buy any Android phone that isn't a pure install.  Not even any of the Samsung Galaxies.  If a Nexus 5 isn't for you and you want Android, then look at the Moto X Pure Edition.  If not, then try an iPhone 6 if you want to go there.  Me...I'm done with iOS and have been loving the Android experience much more for the basics things I normally do on my phone."
Nexus,2jvoor,ADubs62,1 point,Tue Oct 21 15:01:06 2014 UTC,"This depends.   Are you on subsidy? Some European carriers offer it like those in the UK and some do not, like in Spain.   If you're on subsidy, just get the iPhone as you'll replace it within 2 years anyways.   If you're not, get the Nexus 6.   Apple has this obnoxious business strategy of releasing free OS updates that are more and more resource intensive. iPhone 4/4s are effectively bricks on iOS7 and iOS8. And they make it at a certain point impossible to downgrade. iPad 2s are sluggish on iOS7 and iOS8. Apple deliberately does this to make you buy a new iDevice. So if you're planning to keep your phone for more than 2 years, it's a truly bonehead idea to go with Apple as your device will objectively get slower from both a hardware AND software view.   Compare that to Android. Motorola has a really low priced phone, the Moto E running a Qualcomm S200. Compared to the S805 in flagship phones, it's basically a tricycle. But it runs Kitkat and it runs it well. Google has done a fantastic job of going the exact opposite direction from Apple when it comes to hardware requirements to run their OS smoothly. Android 5.0 clearly looks like Google is committed to the less hardware needed. Thus, you're almost certain to be able to run the next 3 OS versions of Android well. Where Apple, you're lucky to run 2 updates without serious performance issues."

The Nexus 6 sold on the Play Store will very likely not work on Verizon's network.

During the work week when I'm in the office (Tues-Fri), I will know better.  My typical use at work leaves me with 65-70% of my battery left at 5.  If it's any greater, then that would indicate an improvement with the device on wifi.   I'll report back with the results!  *One notable difference is the L Dev Preview doesn't have Exchange baked into the Email client, so I'm using a 3rd party one for now.  That might change the overall result, but hey.  Also, I really like the 3rd party client, so I may continue using it. :-)"

I think this caused system instability.  I happened to update to a stable version yesterday evening and rebooted my phone.  Ever since then, the issues I have had seem to have gone away.  Hangouts no longer lags and the frequent home screen redraws I was experiencing are gone.  The only app that is slow is Facebook which is of course normal lolz.

Nexus,2jnnk0,aznalan15,1 point,Sun Oct 26 04:16:45 2014 UTC,Do not sign a conteact!  Did the math with my family plan and you end up paying $800 for a $650 phone.  I believe it is the same for any plan as once you upgrade a phone you pay $40 a month instead of $15 on top of your data package. Better off buying the phone in full.  The other option if you want installments is to do att next where you can trade in your phone yearly if undammaged w/ a $40 fee each time you pick up a new one.  You pay 32.50 extra a a month to pay off the phone (exact price) over 20 months which resets if you get a new.  Use to be a terrible deal but not so much anymore with plan restructuring.  You only pay 40 upfront and in the end only pay phone price plus the $40 fee.  If you dont get a new phone yearly it isnt worth it though.

Probably, though I feel like it will easily be closer to a real keyboard then some tiny unusable one.

A subsidy from US carrier is not what it sounds like. With the exclusion of T-Mobile, you pay more for the phone than if you bought it outright. Plus you are then bound by a contract due to the loan you took on their behalf.  That is no way to justify paying 200 up front for a phone that is going to cost you substantially more in the end.

The Nexus 10 processor is actually STILL quite good single-threaded even though it's two years old. It isn't slow by any means. The GPU is starting to show its age, though.    Especially compared to K1. The K1 is an EXTREMELY capable processor. The most powerful mainstream ARM chip available right now, if I'm not mistaken. The GPU is extremely powerful. Only thing that beats it is Core M (by quite a bit, at a similar TDP), but that's a different price class.  The performance will be leaps and bounds better than the Nexus 10, and that's the biggest thing.   Display. The Nexus 10 display panel was definitely ahead of its time in the Android world, by a lot! It's ridiculously sharp. Its colour calibration is not good at all, though.    HTC is known for making bright displays, and the Nexus line since the Nexus 7 2013 has been known for having very, very well calibrated displays. I have no doubts that the Nexus 9 panel will improve on the Nexus 7, which was already very good (and hence be a lot better than the Nexus 10).   Speakers. Front facing, as the Nexus 10, but HTC has a track record of integrating fantastic speakers. (They look awesome carved out of the glass, too).    They sound amazing on a phone; on a tablet? They'll be fantastic!   Build quality. HTC makes beautiful devices. The metal frame looks like it'll be rock solid!    The front looks beautiful. The back is neat, too; protruding camera, but it's recessed into the thickest point of the tablet. The back is tapered, so it protrudes from the top but it recessed at the bottom (so it won't rub on a table).  And, of course, it's newer. So it'll get upgrades for longer."

If I can sell both, I'll only have to cough up a bit to buy it.   I wouldn't bother with anything Apple these days. Too restrictive. And their patch system is seriously broken. What use is a phone if you can't make calls?   Both the Air 2 and the N9 have solid hardware, but ultimately for it me it comes down to my preference that Android is just superior. Plus, the Nexus 9 has no physical on screen buttons unlike the dreaded non-responsive home screen button on iDevices. You can somewhat alleviate this with the accessibility widget, but it's just easier not to have that problem.   Let's just be totally honest here. Tablets for most people are recreation devices. And in terms of media, Android just wins. Hands down. No contest. I can get a player that will play any format you throw at me. Load up the device with virtually any format and we're good. Apple restricts media to Mp3/4s. No MKV. No FLAC. If you're handling your own media, Android's openness is a billion times better than Apple's closed garden.   As for apps, yes, Apple does get better apps initially, but given that most people download 0 apps a month on their smartphone, I suspect tablet users are similar. As long as the ecosystem has the game you want, you're fine.   The real piece of news I'm waiting for is a confirmation that the Nexus 9 will still allow USB OTG. That IMO would put it far above the iPad Air 2 as you can attach tiny MicroSD readers and then have in theory, infinite storage. And the best part about that, aside from not stressing the NAND in your device is that it's super easy to move content on and off the MicroSDs. Every try delete 2,500 pictures off an iPad that won't recognize as a camera? Outside of sync-ing to an empty folder, you're going to be there a long, long, long time. On a MicroSD, you just select all delete.   Why is your pricing at £400? It's $400 in the US. Shouldn't yours be less in Pound Sterling?"

Nexus,2jli91,sandiegossd,9,Sat Oct 18 10:06:16 2014 UTC,"T-Mobiles equipment installment plan is not a 2yr contract. It is exactly what the name implies. A structured plan to pay full price for equipment. You can essentially pay off the equipment whenever you want. T-Mobile is is often the cheapest option because their rates are also far better than competitors. So 25 bucks plus their unlimited everything puts its to 75 plus tax a month. Much more attractive than at&ts or Verizon's contracts, let alone the next and edge program. Its going to be my route if they offer the 64GB version. I highly doubt they will though."
Nexus,2jli91,ANotSoSlyFox,5,Sat Oct 18 11:53:07 2014 UTC,"This.  The OP needs to do the math to see if it works out for him/her. I pay $40/mo after taxes for my t-mobile plan. I paid $350 for my phone outright.  Or, $40+$15/mo over two years, $15 ""savings"" for every month after.    Verizon may sell you the phone for $200.  How much do you pay per month for you service? does that change after two years? It may be worth it because you need the coverage. Or it may come out to a lot more depending on your data needs.  Personally, verizon comes out more expensive and not worth it for me. But I'm willing to accept the holes in t-mo coverage. And to support t-mo for now."
Nexus,2jli91,linh_nguyen,-3,Sat Oct 18 13:18:31 2014 UTC,T-mobile does not offer the cheapest option. Verizon's prepaid plan costs $45 and includes unlimited talk and text and 500 mb of data (+500 mb more if you activate the auto-pay option). T-mobiles service also sucks terribly (at least in my area).
Nexus,2jli91,ANotSoSlyFox,2,Sat Oct 18 20:05:27 2014 UTC,"I highly doubt Verizon will offer the Nexus 6 as a prepaid option, which will mean you have to buy the phone at full price on the spot. We're trying to avoid that. Only on contract and  on their edge plan. Which gives T-Mobile the edge on prices, no pun intended, as T-Mobile is the only carrier that offers the same pricing tiers on both EIP and prepaid.  Also ""often the cheapest"" doesn't imply ""always the cheapest."""
Nexus,2jli91,ANotSoSlyFox,1 point,Sat Oct 18 20:30:11 2014 UTC,All phones are offered as a prepaid option.
Nexus,2jli91,Knitler,2,Sat Oct 18 21:23:14 2014 UTC,"That's true for any carrier. What I meant was a promotional offer as a prepaid. As in having the phone discounted. Should've been more clear. Also, a shame t-mobile isn't great where you are, it's great where I live. The fact is, prepaid is great if you can buy the phone outright. However, this thread isn't about who has the cheapest rates, it's what the cheapest route to getting the nexus 6. Verizon has a promotion this month that matches their edge pricing to prepaid, so that's $25 for the phone and $45 for the plan. Edge originally is $60. However, the price change is only active for the first 12 months, then it reverts back to $60. It still makes t-mobile cheaper, because the price increase will make it $60 more (not including taxes) for 2 years than T-Mobile. Verizon or at&t very well could offer something insane to make people jump ship from their current carriers. But as of now, T-Mobile is the cheapest route. So until the nexus 6 is released, we don't know who will be the cheapest."

Nexus,2jli91,cbizzle31,1 point,Tue Oct 21 21:32:19 2014 UTC,"No, that one costs $60. In Verizon you get 2gb of data + unlimited talk and text for $55 and you also can also get a device which you pay in quotas over 20 months."

I surely hope other Carriers' ""customized plan"" wouldn't be to charge me full price and a 2yr contract   Do the math of the cost of the phone + your monthly plan price on another carrier and you'll be paying the same phone twice over in the 2 years vs T-Mo.   The kicker being that your monthly bill on the other carrier won't drop after you've essentially paid the full price of the phone. Why would it? Customers think that $300 upfront cost paid for the phone so they keep paying those high plan prices that had the discounted amount baked in."
Nexus,2jli91,blacksheep420,1 point,Sat Oct 18 14:44:11 2014 UTC,"Also consider that with TMO's Jump program that after 6 months, you can return said device to get the latest & greatest that comes out & those original payments for your first device are wiped clean.   Basically you're renting a phone to buy during a 2 year span.  If you get the N6 but dig the S6 when it comes out in March, you'll be able to get one in April."
Nexus,2jli91,mastawyrm,1 point,Sun Oct 19 01:04:56 2014 UTC,Do the math and see if T-Mobile comes out cheaper than the competitors. I'm sure that will be the case. They don't charge you more to cover their ass.

Nexus,2jli91,OutlawBlue9,1 point,Sat Oct 18 11:17:18 2014 UTC,"Yes and no. The ETF from most carriers covers the cost of the device you have purchased on subsidy. T-Mobile doesn't subsidize their phones, nor do they sell contract service; they simply offer a payment plan. Whether you follow the payment plan or not is irrelevant. You are just obligated to pay the cost of the phone. Be that all at once, over 24 months or any time in between. If you end your service, you are still required to pay for the device"

They are more focusing on the rising market in Asia.   How did I come to this conclusion?   HTC is a TW company, while other Asian companies have been used in the past, HTC is not value-based, this plays in later. Additionally, HTC is in a growing market area. The first reviews of the tablet are all in TW / Chinese. (First Hands-on) The higher price is justifiable because of the market they are after. The same reason the ""gold"" iPhone did so well in Asia is also why they're reaching out to an Apple-ish company."

If it's from GP store, there will not be any issues transferring the warranty to your name (I did this). It's not really clear if there'll be any new Nexus 5 stock.....ever. Yes, there were people saying that they'll continue selling the current Nexus 5 along the N6 but many sources (google, wind mobile,etc.) have said that manufacturing of the N5 had stopped in June. Your call really, but IMO you should grab one that's BNIB and get the warranty transferred over. If these N5s were bought from a carrier, the warranty would usually go through the carrier.

If you already have an LTE phone with a sim card you should be able to just swap it in (unless the sim is a different size) and if Not verizon should have a way to activate it since they will be selling it in store anyways.

It's a little misleading since they are meant for different applications though.  But the Tegra is still a phenomenal processor for a tablet.

If you don't purchase directly from Google then don't expect your warranty to be honored by them if anything goes wrong. Not that Amazon has issues with warranties but if their stock becomes limited or your device breaks you will wait on and deal with Amazon not Google.

Nexus,2jg7da,tcc1,6,Thu Oct 16 20:11:23 2014 UTC,Probably middle of the pack at best. This tablet was not designed with that purpose in mind.
Nexus,2jg7da,littleemp,-1,Thu Oct 16 20:59:41 2014 UTC,Is this really a feature that needs a  dedicated purpose to work well? why will the 9 be average at it?
Nexus,2jg7da,Andrroid,5,Thu Oct 16 23:19:36 2014 UTC,"It needs a specific type of digitizer, like wacom, to be able to handle digital pen input. Otherwise its just clunky input."
Nexus,2jg7da,poopyheadthrowaway,-2,Thu Oct 16 23:25:21 2014 UTC,and the nexus 9 has this not?
Nexus,2jg7da,linh_nguyen,3,Thu Oct 16 23:26:50 2014 UTC,Nope. It's the same kind of touchscreen found in most phones and tablets.
Nexus,2jg7da,linh_nguyen,2,Fri Oct 17 14:10:27 2014 UTC,"Finger taps vs pen input tracking is very very different. You need digitizer designed for it (hence surface recommendations). There will be lag when ""writing"" on the N9 and it may be acceptable to you, but I find most people only are ok with it for a note here and there... not sitting down for the purpose of taking detailed notes."
Nexus,2jg7da,poopyheadthrowaway,1 point,Thu Oct 16 23:28:41 2014 UTC,Didn't know that - thanks for this.  Are there any work arounds or does it come down to buying a different tablet? whats the comparison to the shield and the 9?
Nexus,2jg7da,poopyheadthrowaway,1 point,Thu Oct 16 23:42:01 2014 UTC,"Basically, if a tablet didn't come with a pen, it probably is mediocre at it at best.  So you're stuck w/ Samsung (I have not researched how well they compare, but it's still not quite the same as the Surfaces).  It may work for you, I don't know your tolerance. My biggest problem was because of the slight lag, you don't know where your lines are.. so you have to write bigger to compensate.. and thus, on a small screen, I'd always be scrolling. It just wasn't efficient.  I also know people that use a wacom drawing tablet w/ OneNote on their laptops. More accurate.  Lots more bulk, heh."
Nexus,2jg7da,poopyheadthrowaway,1 point,Fri Oct 17 00:10:46 2014 UTC,"Not really. Nvidia tried a workaround with the SHIELD tablet, but it proved to be unsuccessful for things that require precise input, such as note-taking.   Basically, if you want to take handwritten notes on your tablet, you need one specifically designed for that purpose."

Nexus,2jg7da,poopyheadthrowaway,1 point,Fri Oct 17 16:29:00 2014 UTC,"to me it seems like the best performance, the best capacity to keep up with software and updates, best screen, best apps, best battery life, most features will be available for the most cutting edge stuff (ie this nexus).    note taking will be with me, sure, but will only be one of the many things I want to be able to do with my tablet.  I'd be eminently pissed if all it did really well was take notes.  I want a cutting edge machine, and if note taking isnt up to snuff, then I'd rather supplement it with a digital pen and paper solution unless someone tells me i'm being retarded. Another 150 bucks isnt a deal breaker for a device that'll do what i want"
Nexus,2jg7da,kraaayzie,1 point,Fri Oct 17 16:59:26 2014 UTC,Fair enough. I was under the impression that you were getting this primarily as a note-taking device.

Nexus,2jg7da,dexter311,4,Fri Oct 17 00:18:27 2014 UTC,"If the Surface is out of your budget (although it's a great device), take a look at the NVIDIA Shield Tablet. I believe the stylus it comes with is digitized which is ideal for note taking. As a plus, it's cheaper than the Nexus 9 and also uses a K1 processor."
Nexus,2jg7da,nexus9988,3,Thu Oct 16 23:11:41 2014 UTC,"Not good at all. It doesn't have any improvements over the Nexus 7 in that regard.  What you want is a tablet with an active touchscreen. Depending on what platform you want, there are a few options.  Basically, capacitive touchscreens (popularized by the iPhone and found in all modern touchscreen devices) aren't precise enough. They undersample touch inputs and interpolate between them, which means letters will turn into little scratch marks. There are touchscreens with an extra layer of sensors which take a different type of input from a special stylus. They're inconvenient because you need that stylus, but they're also much more precise."
Nexus,2jg7da,uriman,5,Fri Oct 17 03:40:12 2014 UTC,"I'd check out the new Surface. I'm not a Microsoft guy myself, but the pen it includes looks like it would be good for you. Not any specific pen integration offered with Nexus 9."

Nexus,2jgtc3,swight74,2,Fri Oct 17 00:22:02 2014 UTC,"""It's not an amazing machine, but it is amazing at such a low price-point""   OP, sorry but this is a ridiculous statement. The Nexus 5 was absolutely an amazing machine WHEN IT RELEASED even if it cost $500 which it didnt! Suddenly the new flagships are out and people are shitting on the Nexus 5. The Nexus 5 was the 2nd phone to market with the Snap dragon 800 chip. Second only to the phone it was modeled after (LG G2). It introduced small bezels as a standard, included wireless charging and has a stunning display even today. Its got a shitty camera and ok battery life. With those flaws its a fantastic device at $500. Done, no further explanation needed...but wait it cost $350! not $500. Its a phone that would have been a great value at $500 and is unimaginably superb at $350. Its just a year old, technology gets better with time, a lot can happen in a year. /rant     To your point OP, I do think they will keep all 3 models and update each on staggered year basis. Nexus 5 and 7 update in 2015, Nexus 6 and 9 in 2016, etc...  I just wish they would keep the Nexus 4, i'd love a 2015 Sony Z5 Compact Nexus 4"
Nexus,2jgtc3,SayThisFast,1 point,Fri Oct 17 16:41:12 2014 UTC,"Yea in the past it seems like Google has been pricing the Nexus very aggressively. The Nexus 5 and 4 were both much cheaper than their LG counterparts.  I think the 6 shows they are dropping this strategy. It's more expensive than the Moto X. Its priced fairly compared to the Moto X, but regardless its more expensive. This is a break from before when it wasn't ""fair"" so much as ""generously cheap"".  This is probably because plenty of phones are in the $200-300 phone market. Get a Moto G. (Personally I'm eyeing the OnePlus...). Google doesn't need to invent this anymore. And I guess the days when we could buy a top of the line phone for less half the cost of an iPhone are over."
Nexus,2jgtc3,eean,1 point,Fri Oct 17 02:02:40 2014 UTC,"That is bothersome. I hope they sort of stick to a plan that would give access to quality stuff like the 5 cheaply. On another note, it may be a good strategy for a while yet, as making cheap, quality phones running a stock OS will keep upping their market share. Also, I think they like pushing stock Android phones both for development purposes, and the fact that a lot of companies add a lot of terrible shit to Android, really diminishing it's perceived quality.."
Nexus,2jgtc3,eean,1 point,Fri Oct 17 16:55:29 2014 UTC,"be a good strategy for a while yet, as making cheap, quality phones running a stock OS will keep upping their market share   well they evidently disagree with you. :)   I think Nexus was a lot about kicking the other Android vendors in the pants to make better non-contract phones in order to really compete with iPhone on price (since it doesn't matter if you make a cheaper phone if everyone is fooled into thinking its cheap via rent-to-own phone planes.) And I think it's mission accomplished, T-Mobile is really pushing this model and the other operators are slowly coming around. (Overpriced phones isn't a great deal for the operators either.) Now they probably want to make money and not undercut their OEMs."

But you should look into it. It has comparable specs to the N6, and surpasses the Moto X. And the best part- it's not overly priced. Only thing is, you need to find someone to invite you in order to purchase it.  So if you can get past that hurdle, you would have a decent phone in your hands. I'd suggest going to the Oppo subreddits. People often throw out invite codes there. Or if you know someone in real life who would be kind enough to invite you, then there you go.

Nexus,2jhen1,Lightsandbuzz,4,Fri Oct 17 03:05:34 2014 UTC,I think it doesn't make a lot of sense to have a gargantuan 6 inch phone and a small tablet. I like the idea of sticking with the smaller N5 phone and grabbing an upgrade to the Nexus 9 tablet.  Imagine having a Nexus 6 phone and a Nexus 7 tablet. There would be such a small size difference... you would probably never use the tablet since your phone could almost always do what the tablet could (and do it better - faster/newer tech).  I think keeping the N5 and getting the N9 to replace the N7 is the way to go.

The moto x also has a much better front facing speaker and better mics (like for google now commands and voice to text).  The moto x is costs more so its $500 vs $350.  The moto x is a lot more customizable in its look with motomaker, different colors, material backs...etc.  There are other differences of course but imo they are minor.

Nexus,2jepsg,Mirthis,3,Thu Oct 16 11:20:50 2014 UTC,"Same here. Google has priced the new Nexus devices so that we should all explore alternatives.  I have a Nexus 5, and am not in the market for a new phone, but if I was, $650 is way too much money. The perennially premium-priced iPhone 6 is also $650.   I am in the market for a tablet. I had hoped for a larger screen and a lower price. $400 for a 9"" tablet doesn't compare too well to $400 for a 10"" iPad Air.  I like Nexus, but I am not ready to pay Apple prices (or greater) for their devices."
Nexus,2jepsg,BobCollins,1 point,Thu Oct 16 21:26:00 2014 UTC,"Right the same as you, except I'm not looking for a tablet at all and that the price isn't an issue since my company will be paying for it.  I'm still looking for a 4.6"" (5.0"" tops) phone, with tiptop hardware, great display, huge battery, very nice camera and few to zero bloatware apps. I just want a pure Android experience. A microSD would be a plus but it ain't happening on a Nexus, period.  As of today, there's not really any answer to this question, except, maybe, an Xperia Z3 compact, but its display doesn't seem above par."
Nexus,2jepsg,dJe781,1 point,Thu Oct 16 12:15:50 2014 UTC,The Z3 may work better. Is 5.2 I think but should not be too big overal and it's less bulky than the z3 compact
Nexus,2jepsg,RedEyedWarrior,2,Fri Oct 17 15:12:16 2014 UTC,"For the Nexus 9 alternatives, I would recommend the Nexus 7 2013. It's only 7 inches but a 32GB model would only cost you £215 (it costed me €269 in PC world; not sure how much it would cost in the UK). If you want the 4G version, you only have to pay an extra £60 I think. You still get the same 2GB of RAM, a quad-core processor, an excellent camera on the back (which you should only need for taking notes) and it can last two days on a full charge. The processor is a Krait at only 1.5GHz, compared to the 2.3GHz Denver on the 9, but they're both quad-core processors and are very powerful. Let's not forget that the tablet has a sharper display.  If 7 inches is too small, there's the Nexus 10. It's from 2012, but I presume the 32GB costs the same as the 16GB Nexus 9. You won't get 4G or even 3G support, and the processor is only a 1.7GHz dual-core Krait, but it is still a fast processor and you have a sharper display. If you want a big tablet with 4G, then I'd say your best bet would be the Nexus 9. Sony do make good tablets and they usually have good update support, but their software is not open-source.  As for a phone, go for the Z3 compact. Sony has confirmed at all of their Z phones will receive the Lollipop update by early 2015 (source). Even the original Z, which was released in early 2013, will get the update. But if you want to stick with Nexus, go for the 5. It's still a good phone and I'd say it'd cost £320 from the Play Store. But the Nexus 4 is said to be a good phone so I'd recommend waiting and seeing how Lollipop will effect it."
Nexus,2jepsg,RedEyedWarrior,2,Fri Oct 17 18:37:26 2014 UTC,"Thanks. The only issue I currently have with the Nexus 4 is the battery life. During standard days when I'm most of the time on wi-fi (home or office) it's ok, but when I'm most of the time out I can't reach end of day and that's becoming quite a problem. I can wait and see what happens with Lollipop but I doubt there's going to be a drastic change.  At the end I may actually go for the Nexus 5. The 32gb is at 300£ now and when Nexus 6 is out there it may go down a bit.  For the tablet, I just pre-ordered the Nexus 9 LTE version but I may cancel it and get a wi-fi version. 60£ saved and i can get it in white :)"
Nexus,2jepsg,keaukraine,1 point,Thu Oct 16 22:34:09 2014 UTC,"No problem. If you're having problems with the N4's battery, then an upgrade is justified. The Nexus 5 is said to be a savage phone, so definitely worth a look. No point in getting a Nexus 6 if you're also getting a tablet, considering how big the screen is.  As for the Nexus 9, I think you're making a wise choice. Despite being expensive, it is still a good device. I only wished there was a 64gb version rather than a 16gb. Maybe Google and HTC would release one at some point, like the did with the 32gb Nexus 7 2012? But 32gb is still a lot of storage. LTE is awesome; it lets get internet where you don't have wifi access. But if you really want to save yourself £60, wifi versions always get the new updates before the LTE versions. The wait isn't so long though."

Nexus,2jbt79,OutlawBlue9,1 point,Wed Oct 15 18:45:43 2014 UTC,"Build quality was never a strong or core point of Nexus. The subsidised pricing was in that it was flagship specs for midrange money.   I guess Google no longer feel the need to subidise, instead content to just offer the 'pure' experience.   EDIT: I'd never thought the Nexus handsets (or the tablets) were particularly compelling products in themselves if you take price vs spec out of the equation.   I tossed the Nexus 4 and 5 pretty much immediately after better handsets were available, and the Nexus 7 is my primary disposable tablet - I have several (left) and use them wherever I don't care if something gets broken or lost.   But what this means is that I can be a whole lot more judgemental. I've previously dismissed build quality issues on Nexus's just because it's dirt cheap hardware especially given what you get under the hood. Now that's gone away, I can judge it alongside other flagships on an equal footing - so in fact, hope the build quality gets a whole lot better if they're going to be reference Google devices at full price."

They even changed the content to talk about Lollipop.  If they were truly discontinuing them, then they would have removed the 5 from the site completely.  Maybe they're discontinuing the 16GB, or they're out of stock.  I see 32GB ones available on Google Play, so I'll move forward.  The 6 is too big for my tastes, but I wanted to see if Google was going to keep the 5 or not.  I didn't want to buy one and then suddenly not get an upgrade to Lollipop.  Clearly it shows this isn't the case, so I'm going to buy one.  I also agree with many that it would be foolish to not offer a smaller ""smartphone-sized"" device.  All the offerings show they're competing with Apple's offerings.  NOW...I would not be surprised if this time next year they release a Nexus 5 replacement...probably made by Motorola."
Nexus,2jbt79,InternetArtisan,2,Wed Oct 15 18:15:39 2014 UTC,Good points. I agree about the size/price of nexus 6. I wanted a 32 gb phone anyway because my 16 gb iPhone really restricts how much music I can hold anyway. I expected an upgrade to 5.0 even if there was no replacement because that's usually the cycle. The 4 got KitKat as did the nexus 7 2013.

It lags like crazy to the point where it's unusable, the battery lasts for two hours on standby and the USB port lit on fire so I can't even charge it properly (I had to be an external battery charger).

Nexus,2jbt79,pvydJxs7,8,Wed Oct 15 19:55:15 2014 UTC,nah. Not the Nexus price point / appeal I'm used to.  It'd have to really blow away other phones in that price range.  I was thinking about getting the HTC M8 before but the price was an issue.  Now that N6 is as much as any other phone... I'll need to do comparisons.

Nexus,2jbt79,turlian,1 point,Wed Oct 15 16:19:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the Nexus 9 has like a 9 hour battery majorly due to the 64 bit Tegra K1. I'm sure they don't want added flak of a lower battery life on the Nexus 6.  Nvidia is planning on bringing the effiecient Maxwell architecture to Tegra Q1/Q2 2015 at 20 nm (Erista). So maybe we'll see something as powerful as the current dual-core K1 on phones then."

Nexus,2jbt79,dguy101,2,Wed Oct 15 16:24:01 2014 UTC,Can the N9 only be pre-ordered through the play store? I got $305 in rebate cards burning a hole in my pocket... Amazon would make my life so much easier.
Nexus,2jbt79,jetveritech,2,Wed Oct 15 16:26:40 2014 UTC,"Looks like the Nexus Player is $99, with the game controller sold separately at $40."

Nexus,2jbt79,beyondrandom,4,Wed Oct 15 16:10:34 2014 UTC,"Totally disappointing on several levels IMO.   6 inch screen.  Not everyone wants a giant phablet.  I have the Nexus 5.  It's 5 inches, it fits fine in my hand in a case.  It's easy to hold and doesn't bulge in a pocket.  6 inches is massive, pass.  $649 for the 32gb model??! And yet the Nexus 5 32gb was $399? So a $250 jump between models? Pretty shitty IMO.     Looks like I'll be holding onto my Nexus 5 for a while.  Was going to sell it and buy the Nexus 6 if the price was decent.  It's not decent, it's just as expensive as iPhone now.  Way to go Google, you're just like everyone else now."

The nexus 9 is 8.9 inches, 288 dpi, even less than the N7 2012 which is 323 dpi, 4:3 ratio which confused the shit out of me consider that most of the nexus product are aiming toward HD a little bit more.

Perhaps next year the Nexus will go back to a more manageable size and price for you, but there is still also a perfectly good version from last year.  I'm just trying to make the point that there are options available--though they would require you to concede something--for a wide variety of people should they want to upgrade their phone to the most current Nexus.   That said, part of the allure of the Nexus line is also the longevity that comes with knowing that Android will push out updates for you until they believe the hardware can no longer handle it.  You can always go one iteration back (for now, too the Nexus 5) and know that next year it might be better.  And it's generally the same for any line of phones, even those with a single consistent manufacturer (unlike the Google Nexus line)."

Nexus,2jd8ep,SysionUS,1 point,Thu Oct 16 15:47:37 2014 UTC,"The screen size is nowhere near an issue for me. I was playing with my co-worker's new phone today (It's 5.5"" compared to my 5"" phone) and it feels fine. It's also about as wide as the N6 will be, so the N6 will only be taller, which isn't a problem. Any pants/shorts I wear have deep pockets, so I do not mind some added length.  The price point isn't an issue for me, either. With the specs it has, the price point is about correct. They didn't downsize the camera to make the phone cheaper. It has the best specs Google (and Motorola) could give it. Also, I don't mind the price point because I'm just going to be using my school refund in January to get it. I wish I could pre-order it, but I just don't have the money now.  Also, I think this is the start of the Android Silver era. Does anyone remember that idea that was rumored? I bet Google will say that the Nexus 6 is the first Android Silver phone, and that's why it's so high-spec'd and high priced."

Have the dimensions been officially released yet or are people guessing, because the only conclusion I can come to is that they (these dimensions - 83x159.3x10.1 mm (3.27x6.27x0.40 in.)) are wrong, and the Nexus 6 is smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus.    http://i.imgur.com/UZVM1ys.jpg"

Also, OnePlus One runs CM mod, so it won't get a lollipop update any time soon?   I am looking into xperia z2 now. I can get a used one for about $420. However, a lot of their batches have problems with overheating, gaps between bezel and screen, and off center camera and other minor defects. I can't decide what to buy lol."

(You could get a refurbished one from newegg at $499, but full price is 599) I had the m8, and it took great, fast photos, the processor was blazing fast, and I had no real issues with it. Not a huge fan of their android reskin (Zoey 6, I believe,) but other than that, I had no issues with the phone. Photos were stunning, and the software for HTC's camera is so far beyond any other phone I've had. I highly recommend the M8, if you can find it at a good deal."

It does just fine, N6 is just gonna blow everything out of the water for a year or so, complete overkill (good luck convincing anyone you need 3gb ram for stock Android Lollipop). So if you're a spec chaser, the N6 makes perfect sense.  If you're not a spec chaser and you weren't completely enamored by a phablet, N6 doesn't make as much sense anymore.

I honestly didn't expect this phone to go for something as ridiculous as $400, and i have a decent amount of money saved up.  ...then i saw it got released to Verizon, and my contract is expired. Now im in a bit of a dilemma. Buy the phone off contract for the full price (which i can afford) and be safe just in case Verizon is going to be a dick again, or renew my contract and get the phone upfront for a substantially less amount of money, but potentially screw myself over if Verizon asides to dick all of its Nexus customers again.

Nexus,2jbz7w,x1498,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:14:36 2014 UTC,2 things shot down my interest; The price and the screen size
Nexus,2jbz7w,honacc,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:39:08 2014 UTC,"No, the size did. I was looking to upgrade from a Nexus 4 to a phone that was about the same size or slightly larger - a modified Nexus 5 even would have been better.   It's a gamble going phablet-only with the Nexus line, though I understand they wanted to get in line with the competition. I personally am not a fan of large-screen smartphones/phablets, because they're quite unwieldy to handle, and I'm a power user who needs my phone in a single hand to work. Large phone = 2-handed use = not useful.   Having a large phone is a good way to encourage purchasing the wearable peripherals (watches and even Glass), though. Even if Google sells less units, they're definitely going to get more out of each purchase with accessories and peripherals."

Nexus,2jdt3h,xRabidDonutz,1 point,Thu Oct 16 05:05:19 2014 UTC,"Nope.  Once the image is available for the dev community to dig into you'll start seeing versions of Android L on the craziest of phones.  Keep in mind we live in a world where someone put Windows 95 on a Moto 360.  The only limit is the hardware capability.  Honestly I'd say if your phone is less than 3 years old, you'll likely be able to find a 5.0 Rom for it."

Nexus,2jdt3h,Guardian_452,1 point,Thu Oct 16 12:21:19 2014 UTC,"At the very least, you'll need to remove the custom recovery. I also would highly recommend uninstalling Xposed (make sure to do it through the app!). Xposed does not play well with ART. Everything else should be okay, since L wipes /system."

(Also new to that, but I could probably figure it out more easily)  I'm leaning towards trying to the figure out how to remove the custom recovery.  I only had it so I could safely use Xposed.  But I'd rather receive OTA updates without having to manually flash them.  If I can figure out how, I think I'll return to the stock recovery until Xposed supports ART."
Nexus,2jdt3h,littleemp,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:50:22 2014 UTC,"If you're talking about official updates, then you'll most likely have to uninstall xposed framework before doing so, because it tends to conflicts with OTAs/official zip files."

Nexus,2jdt3h,digivation,1 point,Thu Oct 16 13:01:43 2014 UTC,"The piece that is holding you back is the custom recovery. Without the stock recovery, you will not be able to take the update in a traditional sense. Should you return to stock recovery and take the update, you will most likely lose root and your root features (as /system will be written over). It is however fairly easy to regain these.  Bootloader status does not affect taking the update."
Nexus,2jdjwx,bemon,3,Thu Oct 16 01:20:58 2014 UTC,"Well, I would say the Nexus 5 is your top option right now. Some other phones to consider maybe the Moto X or the OnePlus One. The Nexus 5 has an okayish battery, it will last you a day, that camera has gotten better since the release and it will most likely still get updates. The Moto X is a well built phone with stock like android. The OnePlus One is a great buy for the buck, if you can find it. If you want to buy the OnePlus One I would consider to buy it off Swappa. I saw some rumors that the OnePlus Two, or whatever they call it, will be coming out in 2015, so if you can wait see how that phone will be.    What phone are you currently using right now?"

Nexus,2jdhao,caeruleusblu,1 point,Thu Oct 16 01:34:50 2014 UTC,"They are obviously listening to those of us who aren't being drama queens over the size and love the bigger phones.  I've had all 3 Notes. I am a big guy, don't wear skinny jeans and use my phone more than my PC or laptop for media consumption.  I'm just one person, but I know I'm not the only one that is in this situation.  My Note 3 with an Otterbox fits in my pockets just fine. Swype enables me to operate my phone with one hand. My hands aren't huge either.  Just because it doesn't suit you, doesn't mean Google isn't listening to the community.  I'm genuinely sorry they didn't make a second size like so many hoped they would. It would have been nice to have both options out there."

Nexus,2jc7v3,ADubs62,1 point,Wed Oct 15 18:54:11 2014 UTC,Same phone in the same box with the same software.  Only difference is you would need to go through T-Mobile for warranty stuff.

Nexus,2jbf7d,Zubei_,4,Wed Oct 15 13:49:56 2014 UTC,I went the 30$ t mobile route. The coverage can be disappointing but my wallet is happy.  It's bullshit that spotty coverage is even an issue in Rhode Island- it's the 2nd most densely populated state!
Nexus,2jbf7d,pvydJxs7,3,Wed Oct 15 14:57:26 2014 UTC,"I'm also on the $30 t-mobile. Pretty much the same experience. Coverage can be bad at time, though it has rarely caused an issue for me. And $30 a month is awesome. Still considering going up to the $50 for data. All in all I would recommend it."
Nexus,2jbf7d,penguinbass1,3,Wed Oct 15 15:15:58 2014 UTC,I think the best way to answer this is to determine which major carrier has the best coverage in your area and select a MVNO or prepaid plan which uses their towers and has a price / plan that meets your needs.  If you live in an area with spotty T-mobile coverage you probably dont want to use a T-mobile pre paid or MVNO which uses their towers.
Nexus,2jbf7d,littlerob904,2,Wed Oct 15 14:05:43 2014 UTC,im currently using Cricket and i get great coverage/service  the only thing about them is that they cap the data at 8mbps but thats more than enough as im 90% of the time using wifi
Nexus,2jbf7d,paticao,2,Wed Oct 15 14:17:22 2014 UTC,Try T-Mobile by topping up $10 and pay as you go (costs $3). Or their Test Drive program. Maybe visit a store nearby.
Nexus,2jbf7d,isaifu,2,Wed Oct 15 14:41:55 2014 UTC,"I would stray away from Straight Talk if you can...they have a clause in their plans that say if you accidentally pay late, they can close your account at will and you will lose your number. The plans are very appealing, but this fact led me to stray away from their company. Not to mention their customer service is India so if you ever have any issues, it is a pain in the ass. It took an arm and a leg to get my money back after they charged me $45 dollars twice while setting up my account.  If you're looking pay as you go, I'd definitely lean towards the $30 T-Mobile plan or the $60 AT&T plan if you need minutes. If you're not in a LTE T-Mobile area, I would recommend the AT&T plan more simply because AT&T generally has great coverage all over."
Nexus,2jbf7d,dguy101,2,Wed Oct 15 14:57:45 2014 UTC,Sprint should be much better once their new 800Mhz (Band Class 26) LTE service is available.  The service is being turned up across the country as we speak.  Unfortunately you have few Nexus capable MVNO options with them.  I'm personally looking forward to having a next-gen Nexus activated on Ting (a post-paid-per-usage Sprint MVNO) along with a T-Mobile $30 prepaid SIM and booting/jumping back and forth between the two when needed.  Otherwise I would suggest checking out Cricket over Straight Talk.  See /r/NoContract.

But yes, Sprint won't let you buy it unlocked and then activate it. They're the gatekeepers of their network so it still doesn't solve the ""Moto X on Sprint"" problem.

Nexus,2imqjb,cov238,8,Wed Oct 8 04:23:10 2014 UTC,"There's a couple factors to consider:   Price off contract: The Nexus 5 is significantly cheaper than the M8 and S5 off contract. I'm not sure what your phone contract situation is though.  Performance: While it may not have as good of specs, it still performs very well. It's a very smooth and responsive phone. That's the main thing to consider, not benchmarks and CPU clocks. The one negative is the camera is not very good and the battery life is pretty average.  Pure Android: No bloatware to worry about.   As far as iOS vs Android goes, it's all about personal preference. I've used both in the past and the transition was pretty seamless going from iOS to Android. With Android there is more room for customization and it's a more ""open"" OS if that makes sense. iOS works very well, but Apple doesn't give you much freedom.   Another phone worth checking out is the new Moto X. It's not free of bloatware, but it is pretty much as close to stock android as you can get without getting a Nexus. Since you were worried that a Nexus 5 might be too out of date, the Moto X is definitely worth considering. It should also be more affordable than the S5 and M8 are. It's also looking like the Nexus 6 will have a 5.9"" screen, which could be too big for a lot of people. The Moto X is a more reasonable 5.2."""

I'm a nexus guy through and through, but the only two phones outside of Nexus devices that I can recommend in good conscience are Moto X and Xperia Z3 series"
Nexus,2imqjb,littleemp,1 point,Fri Oct 10 03:08:58 2014 UTC,Same can be said for Apple too. Both Apple and Samsung spend more than the GDP of some countries on marketing. iCultists think that Samsung = Android and that every other firm out there doesn't exist. Ask 10 people on the street to name a specific smartphone OTHER than the iPhone or Galaxy series and most won't be able to do it.   Marketing has allowed inferior goods to outsell superior goods that are either less expensive or on parity.
Nexus,2imqjb,Innovative_Wombat,1 point,Tue Oct 14 01:55:05 2014 UTC,"Objectively speaking, Apple does make a good product for the demographic that they are targeting. The difference with samsung is that they don't have a cohesive design philosophy throughout their skin and apps. It just looks messy, unintuitive, and unfinished.   That's not to say that their approach doesn't bring positive things to the market (they spearheaded the bigger screen movement that I am a fan of), but the package that they offer is not one which I am comfortable recommending to others. I don't mock or dissuade their users if that's what they like , but that doesn't mean that I agree with it."
Nexus,2imqjb,littleemp,1 point,Tue Oct 14 02:18:09 2014 UTC,"Apple makes boring, but good products. The question is whether their $300-100 price premium is actually worth the benefits you get from it. Same can be said for Samsung. Is that MicroSD and removable battery worth $300 over the Nexus 5? It is worth $419 more than the Moto G? What can you do on an 5S/S5 that is worth the extra money? What WILL you do on the 5S/S5 that is worth the extra money?   How intelligent is it to spend $419 more on a S5 when all you do is make calls, text, play candy crush and check Facebook and email? All of which the Moto G will handily do.   I think if users took a hard look at what they ACTUALLY do on their devices, they'd realize they're seriously over paying and they'd doing on the basis of marketing.   Personally, if I could get one of those Lumias with an awesome camera to run Android, I'd buy that. I personally don't need a powerful smartphone, I just need a decent camera on it. I've taken a hard look at what I do and I realize I simply don't need the power.   And this is just completely ignoring the devices that Sony, HTC and LG offer that in many ways are better than both the iPhone and Galaxy series."
Nexus,2imqjb,Innovative_Wombat,1 point,Tue Oct 14 02:24:47 2014 UTC,"To be fair, with apple you aren't buying technology so much as you are buying a brand/accessory.

I'm not too familiar with the BoM to comment on the retail price, but I can speak for myself and say that I just like having the fastest available devices.

Nexus,2imqjb,InternetArtisan,1 point,Tue Oct 14 01:53:18 2014 UTC,"Not so much ""No Good"" as extra clutter.  I went from a samsung galaxy S2 to a Nexus 4.  Vanilla android really does everything you want, and is left open for you to download and control your own changes.  Factory add'ons like Samsung's touchwiz just add unecessary features. They look good in commercials but really just confuse operation of the device itself.  They aren't bad, it's just that for some people the vanilla version is better.  When I use my wife's Galaxy S4, I just get annoyed that the behavior is different than my phone.  The single real measureable difference for me:  The nexus phones have googles tethering feature unlocked.  If you buy a carrier branded phone, you won't be able to tether without rooting, or paying the carrier a rediculous monthly fee to allow you to use a feature that they didn't even create.  I don't use it often, but it comes in handy when you are stuck in an airport and really want to use your laptop or tablet for something and the wifi isn't free."
Nexus,2imqjb,derekre3,1 point,Tue Oct 14 17:45:54 2014 UTC,"For me, it's not just the bloatware, but also the possibility of updates.   Too many phone manufacturers put out phones and never updated the OS, thus loading to the fragmentation problems with Android. It's not in their interest to update you, because they want you to buy a new phone instead.   The Nexus line is run the way Apple runs iOS. No bloat, and guaranteed updates as long as your device can handle it.   I think many of these new devices look great, but I'm not shelling out money if I'm suddenly left out when new versions of Android are released.   As for the specs, I don't see the need anymore to have ""top of the line"" if all you're doing is web/email/social media. The handset makers are hitting plateaus since the market isn't doing anything too intense on their devices."
Nexus,2imqjb,Drizz_,1 point,Fri Oct 10 12:25:59 2014 UTC,"I went straight from iOS to the Nexus 5 so I'm not the best person to answer this question, but the consensus seems to be that stock Android generally performs better. Like someone else mentioned, Samsung is especially known for using performance sapping bloatware.   I'll put it this way: I've never once thought when using my Nexus, ""Man I really wish T-Mobile or LG installed their own un-removable software to do this thing I need."" Everything I've ever needed is either built into the OS or downloadable on Google Play.   It's kind of like comparing a computer that you buy from Dell or HP that comes pre-loaded with their software/bloatware to a computer that you did a fresh Windows install on.   The best thing you can do is go try out some Android phones and play around with them. Get your hands on an S5 and see if the bloatware bothers you, etc.   I'd also check out Marques Brownlee's YouTube channel.

Nexus,2imqjb,lightbeat,1 point,Wed Oct 8 20:14:25 2014 UTC,"Actually, should go the opposite way.   In Jellybean and Kitkat, Google made a real effort to actually reduce the hardware required to run newer versions of the OS. That said, devices that are 3+ years old likely won't get updates, but it's a good step to be taking when a device running a Qualcomm S2 can run Kitkat decently. The Moto E can run Kitkat decently.   I agree with truexchill that Apple deliberately makes their OS more intensive to force upgrades. If we all kept our iPads and iPhones for 4+ years, Apple wouldn't make anywhere near their profit lines. It's partially why some of the Android makers are rethinking if they really want to stay on Android as their OS provider is actually making it easier for people NOT to buy new devices for years."
Nexus,2imqjb,Innovative_Wombat,1 point,Tue Oct 14 02:03:13 2014 UTC,"Android updates are usually optional, and it would be sometime before any apps require a newer version.  But, for the most part the update wouldn't be pushed to your device unless it was capable.  With the nexus line for example, google will decide which phones get updated.  And with carrier branded phones, the carrier typically decides. The major difference, the carrier will only prepare an update if the mfg. did.  And they usually lag really far behind.  So, only devices that were released within the last few months of a new version tend to get updates."

No android or apple phone will he exempt from this, you just have to deal with it or not upgrade the software. Your iPhone 4 is what, 4 years old?  Android phones play much nicer with pcs, you do not need any software like iTunes to sync them, you just plug in the USB and can freely transfer media and files to your hearts content.   If the user interface and smoothness of the device is your main selling point defiantly go for a nexus over any other android phone, pure is best. It will receive the latest updates just like your iPhone did when they are released, which is not always true if you buy another android phone.   One thing I much prefer on android ( not sure if this concerns you), the menus. On android all the preference menus are found in the individual app, unlike iPhone that often hide away many app settings within the device settings. It just seems way more logical to control all the settings in the app."
Nexus,2imqjb,tamrinkhan,1 point,Wed Oct 8 23:30:24 2014 UTC,"""Old phones will always feel slow when new software comes out""  Is this still true though, if running stock Android?   The Moto E with its pathetic S2 processor can run 4.4 well. You try running iOS 8 on an iPhone 3GS. That just ain't going to happen. We'll have to see if Android L will keep the new path of less hardware to run new OS, but given that the Moto E can run the same OS as a S5 well does suggest at least for Android that devices with older hardware can run new version of Android well."
Nexus,2imqjb,whtge8,1 point,Tue Oct 14 02:08:54 2014 UTC,"Oh, regarding that.   Google does staggered releases, meaning that only a small group of users will get an update at a time. Does this sound slow? Absolutely. But what this does is allow Google to basically run small tests on users to ensure that they don't get the kind of iOS releases that Apple in recent history has been pushing to the masses.   If an Android patch has problems, Google will patch it before opening up to a wider group. Think of it like a pyramid where the initial release is to a few, and every release of that patch gets bigger and bigger. IMO, this is vastly superior to the way Apple does it which requires Apple to be on it every single time. And as recent history shows, Cupertino just isn't up to snuff like they used to be. When a patch bricks iPhones, that's a huge sign your patch system isn't working.   There will be bugs for some users in Android patches, but there hasn't been anything on the disaster level that Apple's been doing.   I have an iPad 3 and I'm reading the reviews on how iOS8 grinds that tablet to a halt. No upgrade for me!"

I personally like the stock Android look and Samsung bloatware is just too much and also slows the phone down as well. BUT it is a personal preference.

Nexus,2imqjb,lightbeat,1 point,Wed Oct 8 14:22:38 2014 UTC,"Some people buy iPhones because they think it's the trendy thing to do.   I personally think it's funny how Apple's refusal to allow customization has in effect, turned every iPhone and iPad into the same device. You look at anyone's devices and aside from the background, they'll look the same on the screen. Some may be more cluttered with apps, but they're in effect, just clones. Which I find to be uber ironic given how Apple ran that iconic ad bashing Microsoft implying all MS users were drones. Now the key product of Apple are all drones.   You take my nexus 5 and compare to another, and aside from the icon bar at the bottom, it won't even resemble each other.   I highly suggest Dashclock widgets. I have TWO app icons on my home screen. Dashclock adds another 5 within the widget. I also have HD widgets which adds the path to another three apps and lets me pick a color scheme for all of it that makes it gel together. My iPad....looks like a hobo's blanket. Sewed together from dozens of mismatched pieces of cloth.   Stock Android is ""better"" in many senses because it eats up the least amount of resources. All these ""skins"" are resource hogs. Touchwiz by Samsung is one of the worst. And often, these skins don't even add any more value or utility.   What IS a big benefit of Samsung is the removable battery and MicroSD. Which Nexus doesn't have. You may want to consider another path:  The Galaxy S4 (or S5 when it comes out) Google Play Edition. Google takes flagship phones, removes their skins and installs stock Android. You get all of the benefits of a Nexus phone but you get to pick your hardware. The downside is that you're paying full retail."

Samsung devices in particular have a lot of bloat and gimmicky features which slows the device down.  If you want a device that's not a nexus then i would recommend HTC One (m8), motorola or even sony z3/z3 compact.  Nexus devices usually have low camera quality so if camera and photos are important then look into getting other android phones.

Nexus,2ikhbr,spidahkillah,1 point,Tue Oct 7 20:58:24 2014 UTC,"From personal experience, a case isn't required. The back of the phone has good grip and it's slim build makes for a good hold.  However if you are clumsy you could buy a case but it would take away the feeling of the phone. (It genuinely feels nice to hold.)  Also, the only time I ever dropped my nexus 5 was the day I put a case on it. Never encased it since."

Nexus,2igyj1,automaticgainsaying,8,Mon Oct 6 23:37:31 2014 UTC,"Pretty much all modern phones/computers have multiple cores.  You can think of each core as a separate computer (though they do share ram and other stuff).  Each one can be working on different calculations at the same time.  Sometimes a well optimized program will split up the required tasks so that all available cores can grab a piece.  Other times, a program will only make use of a single core, but if you have several programs running they can each have a separate dedicated core.  In short:  It generally helps with multitasking and speeds stuff up, but 2 cores won't actually function at double the speed of a single core."

Nexus,2ift0u,caeruleusblu,3,Mon Oct 6 11:26:57 2014 UTC,There are a number of rumours about a Nexus 5 refresh this autumn (fall) but I haven't seen a lot of supporting evidence - unless anyone can point some out?  If you can wait a week or two we should know for sure soon!  Given the size of the Nexus 6 it would be good if a more 'normal' phone size mobile were released.    A six inch device is going to be too big for many (most)?   Else I'm going to need some bigger trousers...

I see them releasing that alongside an updated N5 (personally this is my hope, and I know a lot of people who don't want that big of a phone). When we get nearer to launch then the stock will start dwindling, but it doesn't appear to have happened yet."

And while the new Nexus phablet will be the technical flagship from Google, the N5 will continue to be the default ""normal sized"" smartphone from Google.  There are plenty of wireless charging options, so don't feel too attached to the official one. The N4 is kinda finicky because it's not an actual Qi-certified device, yet it works with a lot of chargers. Only the Nokia chargers ever gave me problems with my N4. The N5 is actually Qi-certified, so it should be even more compatible than my N4. Just buy an LG charger (orb, puck, or pad) and it should work great."

Nexus,2ibiqi,OutlawBlue9,4,Sun Oct 5 16:21:27 2014 UTC,It also seems to be around the size of the iPhone 6+ judging from the renders which is about the same size of a poptart.

Nexus,2ibiqi,tlkinshtabtaprtysnst,1 point,Sun Oct 5 18:20:09 2014 UTC,I guess it depends on the size of your hands. I can use the iPhone 6+ with one hand. I still really hope they offer some sort of smaller version though.

Nexus,2ibfy9,lamamafia,6,Sat Oct 4 23:58:46 2014 UTC,"Past Nexii have been released at $350 US for the 16 gig model. That said, the only rumors I've seen regarding the Nexus 6 have been $400 at the entry level point. But none of that has been confirmed and none of the top level news sources I trust have said much along the lines of price so I think we're just going to have to wait till it's announced, but I'm banking on it being $400."
Nexus,2ibfy9,OutlawBlue9,3,Sun Oct 5 00:11:17 2014 UTC,That would match what the did with the Nexus 5. The nexus 4 was 300 for 8gb and 350 for 16gb.  Nexus 5 doesn't have an 8gb and is $350/16gb and $400/32gb/  So maybe Nexus 6 will come be $400/32gb and $450/64gb.
Nexus,2ibfy9,cheeto0,-2,Mon Oct 6 05:51:21 2014 UTC,Previous nexii have been around 400. But apparently I heard somewhere (don't have a link atm) that ti could reach up to $600. So possibly similar price as a moto x 2014.
Nexus,2i7dpu,leamdav,4,Fri Oct 3 17:23:06 2014 UTC,"Well, the Moto X was very well received by critics, and the Moto G and E are some of the best rated phones in their price ranges. IIRC, all three are pretty close to stock (a couple little additional Motorola apps included, which were generally received as unintrusive). So that should say something about what you'll get out of a Nexus 6, if the rumors hold true.  If you do go Windows Phone you could do a whole lot worse than Nokia."

Nexus,2i7dpu,JimboLodisC,2,Fri Oct 3 19:07:14 2014 UTC,"If you're interested in a phablet, just go with the Moto Nexus 6. It's going to be the Google phone, the latest and greatest of the Nexus line. I don't think the Nexus 5 is bad, but it sounds like you're more game for the N6 than the N5. If you came into this saying ""I want the best Google phone but I'm not sure about the size"" then I'd talk you into a Nexus 5.  Both are great manufacturers. I have an N4 and love it, and my sis has a Moto X which I'm kinda jealous of... you should be safe either way, but if the size doesn't bother you, why not just buy the flagship of all flagships?"
Nexus,2i7dpu,cheeto0,1 point,Fri Oct 3 21:21:30 2014 UTC,"As far as build quality I think Motorola is the best.  I think their build quality, speakers and mics are better than LG.  LG cameras seem to be better though.  But that could all be software."

I just hope Verizon has no say in it. Just different branding on the case. Verizon crapware and lack of updates will kill this phone. Verizon needs a true nexus device ran by google. I want my updates now not months from now. The lack of updates and manufacturer overlays kill android. I wish google would step in and maintain it.
Nexus,2i4g5t,GenerlAce,1 point,Fri Oct 10 00:47:34 2014 UTC,"I totally get it, and agree that having to ROM a Nexus to get the Nexus experience (like what happened with the GNex) is ridiculous, but I'm seriously fed up with missing out on phones I want because Verizon. Still, I if they're getting the new Nexus I'm fairly confident they'll fuck it up like they do with everything.   In any case, at the end of the day the Nexus line is at the mercy of Verizon. Google can't make Verizon do anything they don't want to, and if they don't cooperate Verizon will simply not support the product. Like they've done with the 5.  When Unlimited Data is inevitably phased out on all VZW customers, I will leave on the spot and go to T-mobile. If I'm going to be using WiFi at every opportunity to conserve my limited data plan, I might as well do it on a carrier that allows me to use any phone I want."

Nexus,2hovt7,no6969el,2,Tue Sep 30 21:51:24 2014 UTC,value=/=price however.. here's to hoping they drop it 100 buckaroos
Nexus,2hovt7,freshme4t,3,Tue Sep 30 22:19:56 2014 UTC,"I'd wait for two reasons:  1) The Nexus 6 will result in the Nexus 5 going on clearance 2) The Nexus 6 MAY also be released with a refreshed Nexus 5 resulting in (1) happening and a not gigantic screen Nexus 5 v2 being released.  So there's a good chance you can either get the current N5 for less, or a new N5 if you don't want the huge ass N6. I personally think the N5's screen is a bit too big as it is. I can't imagine a 6"" screen."

If I were going non-Nexus right now, I'd probably consider the 2nd gen Moto X. I'm currently on PAYGo T-Mobile coverage for both my N4 & N7. I can accept the higher up-front costs for the lower monthlies, because I'll use WiFi whenever possible, but I don't think I can pay contract rates ever again, especially since they aren't lower when bringing your own fully-paid device."

If you don't mind the size get the 6, but if it's too big for you you can get the 5 without worrying about performance or durability."

The fact that you've kept a 3GS for this long is a testament to this. You'll end up replacing Android devices a lot more often than you would an iPhone.  So even though Nexus devices are cheap, the playing field in terms of overall cost to you are actually pretty level with iPhones. I decided to go with a Nexus 5 though, and I don't regret it because I know I'll be forced to replace it and will replace it in a year or two if I end up hating it for some reason. which I don't."

With T-Mobile, I pay 40 ish for the plan after tax. Then a phone over two years is another 20. On contract would come out to 150-250 more, but also with Verizon or att, arguably better coverage. This assumes a new phone every 2yrs. If I keep my phone longer, I see drastic savings."
Nexus,2hkar2,free_beer,1 point,Sat Sep 27 19:29:27 2014 UTC,"Hmm. I'm currently using a Nexus 5, and for me on Rogers it's basically $10 more per month to subsidize a device (iPhone or otherwise).  This translates to roughly $240 extra paid over the course of a two year contract. In fact, unless you break your contract, you can under-pay for the device!  For example, iPhone 6 costs $750. On a two year contract with Rogers it's $260. The upfront cost plus the extra fees over the 2 year term adds up to just over $500.  An unlocked Nexus is still cheaper, but you sure as hell don't pay $1,200 for a device subsidy."

Now find a comparable sim only deal, same minutes, same data etc. Then times that by 24. Take the sim only total away from the other total and that's how much you've paid for your phone.

I mean, apart from the fact that we're saying basically the same thing; if they're over charging you and the only difference is you're buying the phone over two years from them then surely they're over charging for the phone? It's cheaper to buy anything from TVs to cars outright vs monthly payments, why would it be different here?    Edit: Nobody is accusing Apple of inflating their prices, nor are we saying that it only applies to iPhone. The same is true for Samsung, HTC etc. Your service provider jacks up the price because essentially you're buying the device from them in monthly installments."

You can't code apps or 3D games that use more than 1GB. You can't multi-task. You can't even really single-task. Safari kills tabs that you just opened a minute ago.  8MP is 8MP, while competitors are doing 16MP. MP aren't the most important thing, but that's a LOT less detail.  DPI is the same. The resolution is non-standard - apps need to scale and look like crap. Defeats the purpose of having ""retina"" display.  The battery life is necessarily poor, because there is less space to put a battery in a small phone.  That's a lot of inferior specs to be called ""the best phone"". If Samsung released a phone with basically the same specs as last year (same RAM, same camera sensor, same DPI, same battery life; we'd never hear the end of it. When Apple does it, it's the ""best phone"" because it's ""snappy"" and made of metal."

Pixel Count is really one of the least important things when it comes to picture quality...  Some of you other points hold some merit... The screen size is odd, but no apps dont really need to scale because most developers who make apps for the iphone know what the screen size is... videos do have to scale which is a negative point.

Nexus,2hlk9n,AugmentedDragon,2,Sat Sep 27 07:10:21 2014 UTC,"I got the original galaxy note just a few months after it was first released, and the expression I got from everyone I showed the phone to was almost uniformly shock, horror, or disgust (both from tech enthusiasts and filthy casuals alike). Nearly everyone said that phone was too big, and all the bloggers were like ""is it a phone or a tablet""?  The OG Note by the way had a 5.3 inch screen.  Here is the OG Galaxy Note compared to the current Galaxy S5:  http://www.phonearena.com/phones/size#/phones/size/Samsung-Galaxy-S5,Samsung-GALAXY-Note/phones/8202,6116  A phone that was shockingly, almost insultingly large in 2012 would today be considered just a bit plus sized and not at all extraordinary.  My long winded point is that though the idea of a 6 inch phone might be insulting to our sensibilities today, it might become common place when people become accustomed to them and realize the pros of a 6 inch phone (when compared to 5 inch) out weight the cons.    I for one, am psyched for a 6 inch nexus."

Specs that have leaked are a massive size of 5.92 inches with a huge QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 with 498 PPI. That makes it larger than the iPhone 6+ and habe the same res as the LG G3.  Also it's supposed to rock a 2.6GHz quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera that can shoot 4k, a 2-megapixel front-facing shooter and Android L.  From what we know about the nexus line, the internal storage will probably be available in 32 and 64gb versions and won't be expandable, just as the 3,200 mAh battery Propably won't be exchangeable.   Also the thing is called Moto Shamu atm and rumors about the name are nexus 6 (obviously) and nexus x (because Moto X).  Speaking of rumors, it is rumored to come in two sized versions, the smaller one coming at 5.23 inches, which is still bigger than the nexus 5 and the iPhone 6 but, in my opinion, a much better size. Let's just hope the smaller version, if it exists, won't be way inferior to the bigger one.  source: [http://9to5google.com/2014/09/24/exclusive-this-is-shamu-motorolas-upcoming-nexus-6x/](""source"")"

The rumours of a 6 inch device are older but don't think there has been recent leaks on that particular size.   Besides if it's based on the motoX 2014 why would they increase the size?

You may be able to get some idea of the availability/cost of the Nexus X by checking the availability/cost of the recently released 2nd generation Moto X.  I would expect the Nexus X might be around 50-100 USD less than new Moto X.  You can also get an idea of the hardware for the Nexus X by checking out the hardware of the Moto X.  I'm speculating but I wouldn't doubt if it's virtually identical.  For now I'm assuming the Moto X XT1092 is going to be the U.S. Nexus X because Motorola has announced there will be no Sprint Moto X, but this model is compatible with Sprint/T-Mobile/AT&T like the current Nexus 5.  My hope is that some of Motorolas propietary ""Moto"" features will be loadable on the Nexus X."

The other €25 could come from either additional cost for selling the Nexus 5 in Europe (import duties, additional taxes incurred, additional costs associated with meeting European regulations) or simply ""because fuck you"" (AKA: the reason for most prices on digital goods in Australia).  And boom: the $349 USD phone now costs €349. So, yes, €349≅$450, but that doesn't mean the phone doesn't cost $349 in the US, it just means you're paying more for the same hardware.

Nexus,2gm26i,lordmaximus92,1 point,Tue Dec 9 02:10:08 2014 UTC,If I were in your shoes I'd just pay the deductible. $50 more but then you get to keep your warranty :)

Nexus,2geak8,whatmoredoesakidneed,2,Tue Sep 16 10:18:36 2014 UTC,"I dropped my Nexus 5 and it kind of stopped working.  It does this weird booting thing, but shuts off right away.  Anyway, I called Google and told them what happened, and they said that they would replace it.  I had to 'buy' a new Nexus 5.  I would not be charged, but the total amount would be put on a hold.  I would need to return the broken phone, and it would be looked at to see if it falls under warranty.  If it doesn't then I would be charged for the phone.  I decided not to do it, because I don't feel like buying a new Nexus 5, when the next Nexus is probably right around the corner."
Nexus,2geak8,paulisnofun,1 point,Tue Sep 16 17:50:51 2014 UTC,"Huh, that's weird. The rep I talked to told me that the damage I did to my phone wasn't covered under warranty but they'd give me a free replacement anyway. You should call them again."
Nexus,2geak8,jojocy,1 point,Tue Sep 16 23:18:42 2014 UTC,Did you have to order a new phone as a replacement and have Google put a hold for the amount on the card? Edit: changed the way I phrased the question.
Nexus,2geak8,paulisnofun,1 point,Tue Sep 16 23:35:03 2014 UTC,Yes. She said the full amount (free shipping though) would be refunded to me upon receipt of my old phone.
Nexus,2geak8,jojocy,1 point,Wed Sep 17 00:00:50 2014 UTC,Did you send your old charger with the phone? Im RMAing mine for some dead pixels and 2 chargers would be nice :D
Nexus,2geak8,Teeeeeemu,2,Wed Sep 17 13:43:25 2014 UTC,They told me to keep my charger and any other accessories as they would just be sending me a phone on its own.

Nexus,2geak8,jojocy,1 point,Wed Sep 17 15:36:48 2014 UTC,Yeah of course ill keep my sim. Im just guessing if we got the same RMA email... Did you get the 24h link? My email says to return the accessories too but Ive read here that some people have kept both the old and new one...
