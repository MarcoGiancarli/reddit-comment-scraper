girls_smiling,2vuap0,geekboy400,2,Sat Feb 14 03:52:37 2015 UTC,All i see is a floating head...
girls_smiling,2vkflc,Vranak,2,Wed Feb 11 19:28:41 2015 UTC,Another emma stone headless thumb nail!
girls_smiling,2vkyz9,Vranak,2,Wed Feb 11 21:50:09 2015 UTC,She kind of looks like a bug.... Anyone else think that?
girls_smiling,2vkyz9,KismetTheFrog,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:08:09 2015 UTC,The thought did cross my mind.  But a good kind of bug.

girls_smiling,2vehod,westkeifer,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you haven't seen her in Birdman, she really looked this this. It was a bit surreal."
girls_smiling,2vajci,yolofapping,2,Mon Feb 9 12:01:37 2015 UTC,With a outsized personality like hers? I'll call her anything she wants me to!
