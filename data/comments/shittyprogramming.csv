Maybe they copied it to an html file from a php file and it worked so they just went with it. Still pretty shitty but I don't think they're honestly eval'ing php code sent through the query string. That would be some absolute next level stupidity."

Obviously, because it works, there was no need for the client side to fix that, because they aren't using eval() or exec() or even paying attention to parameters at all... :facepalm:  As you can see, the server generates randomly every time (http://www.indianrail.gov.in/captcha_code_file.php), regardless of the parameters passed."

So what you're saying is if someone got a hold of the hashed password database and knew a couple unhashed passwords (e.g. they look up their account and find their hashed password), they could try to decode the algorithm, create a hash-to-unhashed algorithm and just get all of the unhashed passwords?"

The hash simply does not contain enough information to reverse it.   Hash functions can be weak if you can narrow down the possibilities, if they are fast to calculate or if they are prone to collisions.   Collisions occur when different input will hash to the same value. There are only a certain amount of possible hashes, a collision is always possible. However, with a good hash algorithm, collisions should simply never occur in a realistic situation. Even if you try hard to find collisions, you shouldn't be able to find them. In theory you would find them eventually"
shittyprogramming,3dbd0e,BrQQQ,2,Thu Jul 16 04:09:06 2015 UTC,"Just at a high level estimate: not long at all.  Their requirements don't let you use symbols, so you're limited to 26 lower case, 26 upper case, and 10 digits. So 62 possible characters in each spot. There are 626 passwords of length 6, 627 passwords of length 7, and 628 passwords of length 8.  That's a total of about 2.2x1014 passwords, or 220 trillion (American).  Sounds like a lot, but depending on how fast we can throw guesses at the server, it's really not. If we got a hashed password and could throw a million tries a second at it (not out of the realm of possibility) we're down to 7 years. But with gpu's working on it, even a billion tries a second could happen, which would bring us down to 2.5 days to try all combinations.  I'm not up on brute force speeds with current tech, but suffice it to say a dedicated attacker would probably get through this pretty quickly, if try weren't limited by the server (I.e.

Passwords on many of these old systems have to be short because of system-wide string length limitations.  EDIT: Its worth mentioning, all of these AS/400s were pre-POWER ones.

The minifier usually will insert its own semicolons as per the rules of automatic semicolon insertion (so it'll work the same way).  No way browsers will unnecessarily break backwards compatibility simply for good programming practice. A site can work perfectly fine without semicolons. Breaking those would be unacceptable.

They run that script to create some empty files with names that would be interesting to a forensic analyst generate result/log files for their forensics tool with boilerplate details about file info at those fake paths, then demo their software to the customer and show how their software could spot those files and what kind of details it provides about them.  So, they're unethical pieces of shit, but they're not intentionally planting fake evidence or uploading CP anywhere.

shittyprogramming,3c6njv,houad,34,Sun Jul 5 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"You can overload the cast operator for a specific type, so a struct called add is created, stores the result of the two numbers passed in to its constructor, and then when it gets assigned to another value it checks the cast operators for which one it should use based on the type of the value it is trying to be assigned to. Finally it returns the value specified in that overloaded cast operator.  Several operators of the struct are deleted so that the struct cannot be stored, making it appear to be more like a function."
shittyprogramming,3c6njv,Zephilinox,8,Sun Jul 5 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"Ok, thx. So the point is a ""function"" that returns whatever type you want ?"
shittyprogramming,3c6njv,houad,3,Sun Jul 5 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"Well, whatever type you can write a conversion for. It's a bit like Java's toString() method, but for every type."
shittyprogramming,3c6njv,Steve_the_Scout,2,Mon Jul 6 00:04:14 2015 UTC,Does type coercion happen automatically for these?  i.e. will something like cout << MyClass() trigger MyClass's string cast operator?  I'm struggling to see a point to this.
shittyprogramming,3c6njv,SnowdensOfYesteryear,2,Mon Jul 6 03:08:02 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't happen in the case you specify, just when you cast the object or assign it to something of a type you have a cast operator for. So cout << (std::string)(MyClass()) would work, and so would std::string example = MyClass();, in which case it's an implicit cast. To do what you described, you would write your own version of std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const MyClass&);  Like I said, it's like Java's toString() method (or more accurately, String.valueOf()), but for whatever type you want. So essentially the same reason you would define toString() in Java- convenience and more readable code. Of course it could also be less readable as a result- C++ doesn't care, it's the programmer's fault if they make the code less readable with a tool meant to make it more readable.  However, more often than not it does help. For example, you can define an operator bool() for classes that may have an invalid state in order to make error checking more readable, an operator T*() for handle-like classes, or operator std::string() for things that you want to somehow output to a file or the console (or maybe send over a network)."

shittyprogramming,3c6njv,Kerdek,2,Sun Jul 5 19:46:56 2015 UTC,"the overload isn't from the cast operators having different types, it's from overloading the default cast operator for that type."

That basically keeps you from storing an add variable to make it seem more like a function. But, as others have pointed out, you can still make pointers and you can still go add a(1,2).  To fix this, I constructed this monstrosity. It only allows you to ever make an add_type&& which is an rvalue reference (a sort of temporary object), making the struct act exactly like a function. Furthermore, add_type's constructor is private and thus can only be called within add_pass (because they're friends), so you can't construct an add_type without the add function or calling add_pass::make(int) yourself.  The second two deleted functions in the OP do absolutely nothing because neither of those functions were ever defined to begin with."

BlockPos is just a wrapper around x, y, and z integers, with a bunch of related math functions.  The problem is that BlockPos is immutable, so one instance cannot just be reused.  This causes massive object allocations for processes like chunk generation, where every chunk has to reference each of 65536 blocks within it.  So creating a new world at the default render distance of 10 creates 100 chunks of 65536 blocks, which is 6553600 BlockPos instances being created at the same time.

The post is by one of the optifine devs.  As for the deprecated version part, 1.9 isn't out yet and unless it's fixed in 1.9, it'll still be useful information.

Liteloader has no official complete release for 1.8.  And you may need to deal with even older mods.  There's also custom maps designed and balanced on older versions (think CTM / super hostile series maps).    But for vanilla (without mods of any sort) gameplay?  Then everyone is probably using the latest version.    EDIT: I may have misinterpreted your post (""I can download"") -- if so, can you clarify what you meant?  Are you looking for older mods?"
shittyprogramming,3c6oxo,Pokechu22,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:10:13 2015 UTC,Older versions of the base game. It's been years since i've used the game at all. Apparently there's a launcher now?   Thanks for being helpful!
shittyprogramming,3c6oxo,devDorito,2,Mon Jul 6 04:17:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, you want to run older versions of minecraft?  That's pretty easy now!  First, download the launcher from minecraft.net.  Once you've run that, you can select ""New profile"" in the bottom left corner of the screen.  From there, you can edit the version.  If you want to chose versions before 1.0, you'll need to check the checkboxes above that.  You shouldn't need to fiddle with any of the other settings (well, you might want to change the game directory if you're going to use an old version just so that you don't break anything).    You can chose versions pretty far back.  (Down to some versions of ""Cave game"").    If you need to get a server (though I doubt you will), you can use this site."

I can see earning that if it was a freshman and it's a small shop in a rural area, but at that rate you're still going to get the ones that didn't get their first choice of internship.

I can tell you that right now most major software companies will put together base salaries just over six figures, plus yearly bonuses / stock awards in the 20k range, plus another 20k lump sum cash / stock that vests over a few years. And this is for college hires. The downside is that Seattle or the Bay Area are a bit more expensive to live in than rural Illinois.  I would check out GlassDoor.com if you want more data."

They ended up using the display's controller as memory (since the calculator was only ever working with a single number) so whenever a complex operation was in progress the display would rapidly progress through all the intermediate steps until the problem was solved.  It was quite cool to watch, and the source code was ridiculous with 5 lines of comments for every 1 instruction.  EDIT:  I found the original article, but I was not quite accurate.  It was Sinclair, not IBM, and it actually did have internal memory.  I think I was getting the display-as-ram idea from something else I read."
shittyprogramming,3bmszo,compdog,22,Tue Jun 30 20:48:42 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite hacks I've read about:   we need to copy this framebuffer to the display memory during vblank, but there's not enough time. we can make it fast enough if we set the stack pointer to our destination and do a read/push loop instead of an ordinary read/write loop. but the timer interrupt can fire while we're doing that, causing graphical artifacts because it's using our ""stack"" in display memory as an actual stack. we can't disable the timer while we're doing this; the audio system requires precise timing. solution: reverse the direction of the copy (start in the opposite corner of the image) and just let those artifacts happen; they'll be ahead of our copying instead of behind it, so they'll be overwritten with the correct pixels before they're ever displayed. (and just leave a few extra bytes in case the timer interrupt fires when we're on the very last pixel.)"

shittyprogramming,3bmszo,SleepyHarry,14,Wed Jul 1 05:56:56 2015 UTC,"This is much later, but I worked on a PS2 game that did some trickery to achieve an antialiased screen buffer. See, the whole screen buffer with 32bpp color took 1mb of RAM. If you wanted to render it at twice the resolution, you'd need 2mb; if you wanted twice in each direction, which was our goal, you'd need 4mb. Unfortunately the entire GPU memory buffer was 4mb, and that had to include the current frame, the last frame, textures needed for the current frame, and any scratch space.  So, solution: divide up the memory into 1mb chunks, named Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 3, and Texture. Texture just contained textures (""but didn't you have more than 1mb of textures?"" we sure as hell did, we rewrote that chunk of memory a dozen times over every frame).  On one frame, we'd be showing the last frame, in single-resolution 32bpp, which occupied Slot 3. Meanwhile we'd render the next frame into Slot 1 and Slot 2, in 4x-resolution 16bpp - halving the color depth let us fit it in 2mb. Once that was finished we ran a quick process to run over that frame and downsample it to single-resolution 32bpp, starting from the beginning of the frame and running to the end, ending with our next frame occupying only Slot 1.  The problem was that then we couldn't move that frame. So the next frame was rendered into slots 2 and 3, using roughly the same process . . . except since this time, the frame output needed to fit into Slot 3, the downsampling code had to start at the end and downsample the entire frame in reverse order.  One entertaining artifact of this process - because the PS2's ""16bpp"" mode was actually 5 bits per channel, and because we were combining four 16bpp pixels into each 32bpp pixel, we actually ended up with only 7 bits of color per channel. Our game was incapable of outputting non-even color values.  Good times."

These early '3D' engines drew everything as a bunch of vertical stripes, things like walls, enemies etc... To increase performance, images were also stored as vertical stripes (column major order), this way images could be copied from memory to the image buffer faster, since consecutive memory operations are faster. But every image viewer/editor (at the time) assumes images are a bunch of horizontal stripes (row major order) like bitmaps for example. So when you loaded an image straight from the Doom WAD files, they looked like they were flipped and rotated.  More on the Doom wiki here"

At the time, John Carmack even had to invent make use of stuff like FastInvSqrt(), because each and every cycle was of vital importance.   Using a simple table and a pair of indexes (one for the client-side effects, and one for everything that had to be synchronized in multiplayer) was a smart choice. The table was generated using a proper RNG, and in fact it isn't perfectly evenly distributed. But is it a problem? No. It its limited size a problem? No. Doom is a very dynamic game, it's near to impossible for a player to do the exact same things during each gameplay, unless he's trying to. There's no fear of finding recurring patterns.  So, as you said, it's not shitty code. It's not bloated or hard to read, it does what it advertises with no side effects and meets the speed requirements of old hardware.

shittyprogramming,3ba3cj,dermesser,50,Sat Jun 27 13:39:52 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely make an acceptable chat client with frequent AJAX polling and an SQL backend. Obviously a persistent connection solution with push (e.g. websockets) would be better, but that doesn't mean a polling-based solution absolutely won't work.

shittyprogramming,3ba3cj,krakissi,8,Sat Jun 27 14:36:35 2015 UTC,"AJAX polling is fine. The problem is the SQL database.  Sure, you could use a relational database to store messages for a real time chat channel... but you really shouldn't. You could use that as your persistent store, but you either need some other layer to read recent messages and insert new ones (some kind of cache or NoSQL data store), or skip the data store entirely and just broadcast messages to all subscribers via Websockets or SSE."
shittyprogramming,3ba3cj,catcradle5,3,Sat Jun 27 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The prudent solution if you do want to store the log would be to broadcast messages with websockets and then batch insert the messages asynchronously into whichever database you want.   Of course, this guy is obviously just learning and doesn't need anything that can scale, so he could store everything in a file for all I care."

He started to get mad when I couldn't contribute code. Dude, I'm not going to learn Stored Procedures as well as you just to do this wrong.  The thing worked as a prototype/proof-of-concept, but it was very much not scalable, it was difficult to add features to, and was easy to break.  The one line of code I was able to contribute was a filepath, because the dude, skilled DBA as he was (solving coding problems with the one tool he understood well instead of just learning the appropriate tools), could not figure out how to locate files on his own filesystem that lived outside the database. I remember him being really impressed that I was able to do it so easily. I live on the command line, of course I can find files.  The instructor was not technical enough to understand how much we diverged from the design we turned into him, or why I was so dissatisfied with the project; something I revealed to him only after we got our A. It was kind of neat to have everyone in the room jump into the chat during the demo but I really didn't get to build any of it; I was just the ""bullshiteer"" presenting that nonsense with as much nonsense-polish as I could muster.  I don't mean to discredit his skill as a DBA, though. I could not do what he does without years of training that I'm totally not interested in."

shittyprogramming,3a2no3,gojukebox,3,Wed Jun 17 01:57:31 2015 UTC,The only part of this that truly bothers me is that the programmer didn't use 'unsigned int'.  With no effort this could have been a problem in 2018 or later.
shittyprogramming,3a2no3,tictac_lacksit,15,Wed Jun 17 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"There's no real benefit to using an unsigned int in this case versus just a regular int.  If it's going to run into problems with 231, 232 isn't really going to cut it either.  If they took the time to make it an unsigned int they could have just taken the time to make it a long or something."
shittyprogramming,3a2no3,TheBanger,-8,Wed Jun 17 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"K.  Didn't think I'd have to explain.  Of course it doesn't ""cut it"".  I'm talking about TWICE the IDs when you were already in the billions for the programming cost of simply adding 'unsigned'.  The programmer knew these were GameIDs which are (probably) always positive.  How long did it take them to reach 2 billion games, 6 years?  So maybe they would have gained another 4 or 5 years for virtually no effort.  THAT is what makes me think there is a shitty programmer in the mix.  Sure they SHOULD have used GUIDs or ever-growing strings, but I wouldn't rush to r/shittyprogramming everytime I see that someone should have done that.  Maybe we need r/heythisguyisntevenanintermediatelevelprogrammer  EDIT: Forgot to correct you specifically.  There is real benefit to using unsigned int vs int, that is 4 or 5 years of spectating lifetime.  Maybe the problen would have been solved during that time that was bought... and all it would have taken was the word 'unsigned'.  Make it unsigned long long while we're at it."
shittyprogramming,3a2no3,tictac_lacksit,6,Wed Jun 17 00:35:45 2015 UTC,"So you always spend time thinking about whether your variables could be negative or not? And surely you've never had a missed null pointer check somewhere, when we're being pedantic."
shittyprogramming,3a2no3,PingofDing,0,Wed Jun 17 06:25:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, I always care about the signedness of my variables- that's very easy.  It's something that you can foresee immediately, unlike how popular your online game may become in 5-10 years.  I don't blame the guy for using an int.  Maybe they were compiling for x86 when the code was written and he didn't want to use anything more than an int (like 2 ints (long long), GUIDs, strings) because there is more to it than just changing the variable's type in one place.  Ok, I wouldn't fire someone based on that mistake, nor would I call them a 'shittyprogrammer'.  Say he used unsigned int and LoL became obsolete sometime within the next 4 years before this simple issue was discovered.  Or say Riot would refresh the server databases and the old game IDs become archived for stats purposes.  Then his implementation would be, in practice, just fine.  I'm not saying it's great and I'm not saying it's shitty.  Your point about me being a perfectionist is actually what I'm calling all the, yes, pedantic people in this thread.  I am not calling myself a perfectionist.  Maybe you're offended because you're a shittyprogrammer who doesn't ever care whether you're using unsigned/signed variables.  Not sure why you care."

shittyprogramming,3a2no3,siosilvar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:33:50 2015 UTC,"I agree.  But I also think it's possible that Riot would want to cause a 'paradigm shift' and push for a release of LoL 2, or have to rewrite a portion of the code where this problem existed in order to implement another new feature.  Dota 2 is about change up the engine and game modes (introducing custom games).  A scenario like that could have resolved this type of issue.  I wasn't trying to start a conflict with anyone here by expressing that I put more weight on the unsigned/signed issue than the data type choice.

It matters because nothing renders until the client has downloaded these files, and if these files are twice the size they could be then that's double the time it takes to load. I realise sitting on a nice laptop at home with an awesome fibre connection it's easy to shrug these things off, but a large portion of people access the site on mobile, these people might be on a train with less than great signal and cutting down the file size might be the difference between the site loading in 3 seconds rather than 6 and having that person sigh give up and hammer the back button."

Thankfully it's 2 for loops with an if statement nested in another if statement all as part of a method so at the end you just have the 5 closing brackets together but it's still readable.   I'm only 2 years into this so I'm very self conscious about coding style. It's why I'm on this subreddit: So I can know what pisses people off and work on not doing that.

shittyprogramming,39owap,annoyed_freelancer,7,Tue Jun 16 16:38:07 2015 UTC,Front end developers that use more than 3 or 4 levels of SASS indentation need beating over the head.  Long style chains are slow and kind of defeat the purpose of CASCADING style sheets.
shittyprogramming,39owap,CheshireSwift,55,Sat Jun 13 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"This is why I do things like this:                      }//end if                 }//end switch             }//end for         }//end function     }//end class }//end namespace   But that looks like css so your predecessor was an idiot.  Edit: so some of you think this is a really horrible idea. And while I meant it as a joke, I can make some really strong arguments for doing this in some cases. And before we go on, the ""number of levels"" argument makes no sense and bracket highlighting doesn't either when your code stretches above the screen.   So we have namespace, class, and function terminator comments. Those are joke comments meant to highlight the ridiculousness of it. This is also why the ""number of levels"" argument is not only stupid but wrong. Also, don't say that indentation is the savior of readability because I've seen more than a few jackasses set indentation to 2 spaces and then reformat entire files to the new indentation. Incidentally, that's how you drive people to rage.  That leaves:          }//end if     }//end switch }//end for   If your iterator is that long, you're doing something wrong. If your switch is that long, your planning sucks.   But let's assume that you have a valid reason for having three code blocks longer than the screen and terminate all one right after another. You've traced through about 75 lines of code in the middle of a huge, poorly written function. You have no idea which one is which or if it still applies to the code block you're debugging without scrolling up. If I have to scroll two screens to read your single function, you suck but at least do me the favor of telling me which is which."
shittyprogramming,39owap,annoyed_freelancer,48,Sat Jun 13 10:49:51 2015 UTC,"I suspect that if you need to add clutter like that to follow your indentation, you're nestling things too deep and should probably consider breaking your function into a bunch of smaller functions instead.  (EDIT: The thought that maybe you were joking struck me.)  Edit in reply to your edit:  Your strong argument seems to boil down to ""people write bad code, and this is a band-aid for it"". I don't think that changes my argument: you should most likely refactor the function instead of adding more clutter to it."

That doesn't mean I don't know where things are, at least for things that are on the top of other things, like how I can tell that the top of the pile of various anime DVDs contains Clannad, because it says 'Clannad' on the box with a picture of the show, but it's still not the good location for it as opposed to if I put it on the shelf, if I wanted to watch it (and I wasn't just ripping it to the NAS anyway) it'd take me a bit of time. My external hard drive is quite visibly underneath a bunch of unimportant letters I need to put in the recycling, I may be able to tell it's there but I'd still need to dig it out, and for that matter I don't necessarily know what the content of those letters are other than they're on top of my hard drive. Yet you ask me where most things are that are definitely on my desk, and I can find them, but it doesn't mean I can quickly and easy get them if I need them.  I suck at analogies, but you get the idea. Putting //if //for //while //asdf in your code doesn't necessarily mean you can tell what's going on all of a sudden.

If they get some forward thinking and maintainability in the process, you became a little more valuable. At the end of the day, however, they're not asking you in your interview how maintainable your code is. They don't care. They're asking you if you know about the technologies they use or want to use. That's the only value you have to them. Don't ever forget that. So if you're on a team, throw in some good habits and don't do anything to get yourself fired.

If you're unable to identify if a closing brace if for the namespace, class, or method, you're either new or your files suffer from inconsistency. So you should only have to worry about blocks past those.  With that said, it's very language dependent. Scala, for example, has a lot more blocks than Java due to the heavy use of closures.
