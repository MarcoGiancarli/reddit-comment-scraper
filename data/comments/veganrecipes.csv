Store in the fridge after fermentation, will last about 5 months. You can also use a little bit to start another batch, just add more coconut water.   Cultured Nut Cheese:  makes about 3 cups  *2 C whatever type of nuts you prefer (also works with seeds)  *1 C purified water  *1/4 C coconut kefir water  *1 tbsp. salt  Blend nuts/seeds and water together until smooth  Slowly add kefir near the end of blending.  Scoop out and place in a glass bowl to culture  Let the batter sit in a warm place for 8-24h  Test with a non-metal spoon (or else contents separate)  Season to your taste preferences; I used fresh parseley, dill, rosemary, thyme and 2 drops of oregano oil, and the juice of 1/2 lemon  Wrap in a cheese or muslin cloth and place in a container without  a lid in the refrigerator until it is as dry as you want  Should last up to 8 months uncovered and in cheesecloth - the longer it stays in the cloth the stronger and dryer it will become. Lasts longer if covered. Also is just as good if kept as a cream-cheese spread consistency."

I have a lot of time for people sharing their own shake recipes; there's only so many times you can have a chocolate shake before it gets a bit boring. I use a pea protein isolate, a scoop or two of peanut butter, a banana, and a bit of creatine (I take the rest in the morning to make up my 5g). I prefer pea for a lot of reasons, the main one being that it just seems to hit me like whey did before I cut out the dairy.   There's a list of great vegan protein powders on my site: http://gainandgrain.co.uk/category/protein-reviews/  I'll start putting up shake recipes soon. Hopefully I'll manage to break away form my peanut butter addiction and actually start making inventive recipes."

veganrecipes,3dptos,Gain_Grain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Always glad to hear efforts are appreciated. Yeah it's all about trying different ones until you find the one that works for you. Unless I'm reviewing, I stick to pea isolates, maybe hemp, depending on how I feel. I have seen good, consistent results with both for years now. The main factor for me, after protein content, is flavour: if it tastes good an mixes well, and it's relatively cheap, I can easy knock-back 2-3 a day. With vegan powders you have to try a little harder to find the one that tastes great to you I think.   I'm convinced that the addiction to whey is pure propaganda, because I used to drink a lot of the stuff before kicking dairy, and in terms of gaining weight and recovery, I can't see any difference between that and pea protein."
veganrecipes,3dptos,opinionrabbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:48 2015 UTC,The pea protein I tried tasted awful. So awful that I gave up on pea protein and had to throw it in the garbage. Maybe gonna give it another try. Thanks for the great reviews!

veganrecipes,3dh9jx,soulvegan,14,Thu Jul 16 06:56:23 2015 UTC,"I think this is a helpful article, but I don't want vegans to be confused by the statement that ""vitamin b12 is only found naturally in animal products."" This may make it seem like humans are made to eat meat to gain this essential vitamin which is not the case. Rather, vitamin b12 is produced by bacteria. Neither fungi, plants, nor animals (including humans) are capable of producing vitamin B12. Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis. The bacteria that produces it covers soil but in micro amounts. That's why our bodies are good at recycling it. Since we wash our vegetables to avoid bad bacteria, we wash any chance of b12 being on our plants. But the article is accurate when stating that we need to supplement it."
veganrecipes,3dh9jx,kingkev115,2,Thu Jul 16 07:55:55 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a great article, but I disagree with the suggestion of getting vitamin D from the sun.  There's apparently some disagreement in the medical community, but the American Academy of Dermatology and the Skin Cancer Foundation recommend getting vitamin D through supplements and diet.  When I had a deficiency, my internist told me to get fifteen unprotected sun a day and my dermatologist vetoed that because of a family history of skin cancer.  That said, vitamin D deficiencies can be rough.  I was tired and physically weak, plus I had bone pain.  So it's worth mentioning diet to your doctor so they can check various levels."

Either fried in oil or baked and you can add all sorts of spices. Throw them in a pita, take along some tomato/lettuce/onion/cucumber and a bit of tahini & lemon sauce, then during lunch she can just throw everything into the pita and enjoy. You could also make lentil/oat/veggie loaf (with a nice maple syrup, vinegar, and ketchup glaze on top) which you can just cut up in slices, maybe fry it a bit in a pan if you want, and make a sandwich with veggies and mustard. You could also do easy baked tofu slices, either plain (marinated in soy/ginger sauce) or with a spicy sriracha or bbq sauce and use that for salads or sandwiches with veggies.

It's not surprising that making mashed potatoes is done by:   Boiling potatoes until soft Mashing with butter and seasoning   The suggestion of using ""vegan butter"" is facile.  There are a lot of ways to substitute butter in vegan cooking, and a product advertising itself as ""vegan butter"" would be a completely obvious choice for someone wanting to make vegan mashed potatoes. No-one needs an article to tell them that...  If anyone is still curious, you can make mashed potatoes with any oil instead of butter, btw. Vegan in one simple step.  EDIT: Also, do we really believe that the writer tried a wide variety of potatoes to come to the conclusion that ""It’s the type of potatoes that [...] make all the difference."" and that Yukon Gold is best, or is it just that Yukon Gold potatoes (even down to the specifics of being mashed with roasted garlic and chives) were already mentioned in some of the nearly identical recipes from top Google searches for ""vegan mashed potatoes"".

Each 255 calorie serving contains more iron than a serving of beef! Optionally, you can top with apricot preserves for extra iron goodness!  RECIPE:   Optionally ahead of time, soak a cup of raisins in rum in a Tupperware container and a half cup of almonds in a cup of water in your blender. Rum raisins are optional, of course, as regular raisins will work fine! Almond milk can also be substituted for the soaked almonds and water. Preheat oven to 450 and heat up a greased 8 inch cast iron pan. Into the blender, blend the almonds and water + 1 cup chickpea flour (super cheap at your local Indian grocery), 0.5 teaspoons salt, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon red food colouring, 0.25 cups molasses, 0.25 cups apple cider vinegar, 0.5 teaspoons baking soda. I blend twice because chickpea lumps are no fun. Blend and then mix in drained rum raisins with a silicone spatula. Pour mixture into the hot cast iron pan, making sure to scrape that tasty batter off the sides of your blender with that silicone spatula (don't be fooled if you lick the spatula, as the chickpea flour tastes much better cooked), and let cook for about a minute. You may see bubbles form and the edges begin to pull away from the sides and darken. Transfer the hot pan to the oven for about 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Dump out of pan onto a plate. Flip right-side up with another plate, and slice into six servings with a pizza cutter. Optionally, spread apricot preserves to serve as your brunch or afternoon tea."

Finding slightly more exotic vegetables, or something like heirloom tomatoes for a really fresh salad (topped with balsamic vinaigrette, perhaps).  These shaved brussel sprouts with wholegrain mustard sauce are incredibly delicious. Grilled cauliflower would work really well with this sauce, too.  For a light soup appetizer course, you can't beat leek and yellow potatoes with a good sprinkle of smoked paprika. Really simple-- sautee fresh leeks in a good dollop of olive oil, add a bit of crumbled/rubbed rosemary, diced potatoes, and a non-tomato based vegan broth (I like ""chicken style"" broth).  Another soup option: coconut and corn chowder, delicious and summery.  Zucchini noodles are really fun and, of course, low-carb! I like to also add julienned carrots, lightly steamed, for some more color. Or you can keep it all green, add some asparagus sliced on the bias, and make your own vegan pesto (I recommend using walnuts instead of pine nuts).  For something a bit more substantial but still unusual and involved, you can make little tempeh cakes, which are easy to adapt into a small plate alongside some fresh arugula."

Nasu Dengaku is a Japanese dish with eggplant in a miso glaze.  You can google it and make a glaze with mirin and miso and such, but I used to get it from a restaurant with just miso paste and that's how I make it. Slice a Japanese eggplant in half lengthwise, spread a thin layer of miso paste on each flat half (red if you really like the pungent flavor, white if you want it milder) and roast on high heat (400 F) until the eggplant is cooked but not falling apart. Makes a classy app or side.  Stiffed peppers can be carb-y, but you can do them with a small amount of grain and a lot of tofu, chopped up vegetables and seeds and nuts. Always seem classy.  Chocolate mousse is another simple but classy seeming thing - melt dark chocolate, whip into silken tofu in a blender or food processor, chill. Add a fruit compote for extra points."

Then, either stir it into the dish, or just put the broccoli rice into an oiled casserole pan and top with rinotta and bake for a short time at high temp until browned a bit. Or, if you're just trying to make the dish more filling, you could try just blending up some firm silken tofu and throwing that into your normal mix."
veganrecipes,3c86eu,0the0egg0,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:17:05 2015 UTC,Soft tofu crumbles up into inconspicuous bits.  Nutritional yeast would add some protein and even more cheesy flavor.  Flax meal is always a good idea.

veganrecipes,3c58sb,aelinhiril,6,Sun Jul 5 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"Savory secret ingredient at chez Sanpaku is always Marmite, yes the British yeast extract, which I can get at the local Indian/international grocery.  Generally its a mirepoix of either onions/celery/green peppers, or onions/celery/carrots, then garlic, then Marmite when the beans are added. Regional variations are mostly in the spices: cumin + oregano (Mexican), cumin+oregano+black pepper+red wine (Cuban), cumin+clove+cardamoms+cinnamon+bay leaf+chili powder (East Indian) etc.  But Marmite is a great way of adding the free glutamate/umani to dishes that require a savoury note. As it has a lot of salt, ignore salt instructions and season to taste near the end of cooking."

veganrecipes,3c58sb,stephtveg,3,Sun Jul 5 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"I top the rice and beans with kale or chard, since it gets microwave warmed at work, I just stuff the greens on the top and let them steam at work.   Grilled onions or carmlized onions can also add some nice texture and flavor.   As for spices: red pepper flakes, sriracha, habanero hot sauce, cinnamon, mace,   If you need variety, try switching up your grains with quinoa or bulger, and your lentils with black beans or chickpeas.   Black lentils, pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices go very nicely together."
veganrecipes,3c58sb,squidilicious,3,Sun Jul 5 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"My go-to is turmeric, cumin, onion powder, and a shit load of garlic (powder is okay, but fresh is always best). I could eat beans and rice with that seasoning all day long."
veganrecipes,3c58sb,BeetrootRelish,2,Sun Jul 5 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"For the rice I eat I don't usually season it, just cook it with a bit of oil or margarine. I put a bit of salt on top. I like the plain taste, I guess.  I made some beans today which were pretty good. I heated oil in a pan, added a spoon full of diced green chilies and let it cook a few minutes. Then you can add onion/garlic is you want (I used the powder version) and cook that. Add a can of diced tomatoes (my ratio 1:1 but I definitely think more tomatoes should be used), seasonings like garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, paprika, nooch, pepper, a bit of tomato paste, and a bit of stock. Add your beans, bring the mixture to a simmer, turn down the heat, put on a lid, and let it cook until it's not liquidy. It worked well for me as I had all the ingredients on hand--quick, easy, very filling."
veganrecipes,3c58sb,zuckerfee,0,Sat Jul 4 23:35:36 2015 UTC,"Oooh, chilies... yes yes. I like the plain rice, too, but I can't stand plain beans.

veganrecipes,3c58sb,Terrance_aka_Magnus,2,Sat Jul 4 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, my recipe is essentially the makings of a soup haha. Nearly all my recipes are similar to this, it's so versatile. And I can't stand plain beans, either. I heavily seasoned the ones I ate today because they were kidney beans and I really dislike kidney beans texture. Luckily it tasted great mixed in with my rice(:  Chili is super easy to make into a soup, even with how hearty is already is. If you have elbow macaroni (preferably, large) you can throw that in the soup with the stock to make a really nice soup that way."

This first month has been great but I sort of feel like I need to consolidate things down.... simplify my meals a little bit. I like that you point out it is essentially the same ingredients for rice & beans, chili, and bean soup. I know it is kind of obvious but I think I needed to be reminded of that. I have been spending too much on groceries lately. I could also easily substitute the beans for lentils and, voila, lentil soup."
veganrecipes,3c58sb,bethyweasley,4,Sun Jul 5 00:12:35 2015 UTC,"on a side note, lentil soup is an awesome cheap way to use up any veggies you've got laying about: throw a bag of lentils, a cup of uncooked rice, and ~15 cups of water in a pot with whatever vegetables you have handy: onion, garlic, carrots, celery, potatoes, sweet potatoes, kale, ........."
veganrecipes,3c58sb,agnosticbeliever138,2,Sun Jul 5 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you're looking for cheap you don't really need to look further than those few ingredients which can make several different sorts of meals.  Lentil soup is definitely my favorite of all soups, too.

Is there a particular dish you're thinking about? I found this recipe for an eggless wash, if that's what you're thinking about?  For me it's when in doubt, flax egg (it out). It's the easier for me to get a hold of for dishes and it's easy. Flax eggs work great at thickening, to a point, for me. And the flavor/body bit I don't quite follow, in what recipe would this be the case? You could always add more seasoning (nooch!) or incorporate some veggie stock for more flavor in a dish--nothing will be very egg-y, though.  As for custard powder, I had to google it because I had no clue what that was. I'm not much help on that part of your question."

veganrecipes,3axgk5,nguoihanhhuong,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:35:38 2015 UTC,"I have tried this dish following your recipe and I would like to add a few things:   Seasame seeds/ cashews should be put on hot pan for about 1 to 2 minutes before use. It makes the food crunchier. We shouldn't use freshly cooked rice but instead riced cooked previous day sored in the fridge, the rice would then be much much drier and hence, tastes better. I personall don't like ginger, that doesn't fit in Asian tastes After we fry garlic, onions, carrots, pineapples, we should add soy sauce, sugar, salt directly to the mix. Taste then put this mix in a seperate bow. We then proceed to frying rice with low heat (for about 5 to 10 minutes) until we put the mix back in."

veganrecipes,3aldv6,making_sammiches,4,Sun Jun 21 15:26:20 2015 UTC,When I'm baking I usually use almond or coconut milk (although I find coconut milk thickens the batter a bit too much)  and sub coconut oil for butter.
veganrecipes,3aldv6,myxx33,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:23:19 2015 UTC,What is your coconut oil to butter ratio usually?  Can you do it 1:1?  I've always used Earth Balance vegan margarine but I really prefer coconut oil.
veganrecipes,3aldv6,making_sammiches,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:08:25 2015 UTC,I usually do equal measures. If the recipe has very little flour then I'll lower the coconut ratio as I find it can make some recipes very greasy. This recipe calls for a lot of flour and very little butter/oil so it should be fine.

veganrecipes,3ae965,TarAldarion,3,Fri Jun 19 13:38:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the baked seitan has quite a few spices in it and when it is all done, it resembles a kind of wheat gluten sausage in texture, appearance and flavor. Actually, I think it is really wonderful for things like stews because it holds up very well in fluid.  If you want a knock out recipe to try it in,I love it in the Seitanic Red and White Bean Jambalaya recipe from veganomicon.  P.S. if you do try that reciple, its great with white rice. if you want it with brown rice you need to bake it for an additional 40 minutes, despite what the cookbook says."

Then, they're the perfect texture of bbq or for battering and making seitan fingers.  I love cooking."

veganrecipes,3ae965,TarAldarion,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"I second your suggestion of Veganomicon's Seitanic Red and White Bean Jamalaya recipe. I make it with brown rice and bake it 75 minutes in a Breville convection oven. Now use a slow cooker, with no change in recipe proportions, and cook 1 hr.  When I made seitan from scratch I used Honeyville Farms Vital Wheat Gluten which I found to be the best price. Usually got the six pack which lasts years."
veganrecipes,3ae965,teapup,4,Fri Jun 19 14:50:23 2015 UTC,"When I make mine (weekly) I do this:   Take a cup and half of powder and put it into the saucepan I'm going to boil it in. Add some soy sauce and other herbs/spices (pepper, fennel, carraway, basil, mustard seed). Sometimes I stick some Marmite or other yeast stock in there too. Add water until it won't take up any more but make sure you don't add too much otherwise it won't stay together. (If you add too much and there's liquid at the bottom of the pan, pour it away.) Knead it (in the pan) for five minutes or so, basically stretching it and folding it in half onto itself. Break into four pieces, flatten. Top the pan up with plain water and simmer, lid on, for 30-45 minutes (basically until I go 'oh shit I forgot about the seitan'). Leave it to cool in the pan (in the water). Pour the water away and transfer the blobs into a tupperware box and freeze until needed. Defrost a frozen blob in the microwave for about a minute and then slice, then tear into thumb-sized pieces and fry these in olive oil, usually adding some mustard seed and fennel half way through. I tend to not poke about with them too much for the first minute or two but then turn them over individually with a fork to brown the other sides. I basically keep turning the paler looking ones until they're all a nice golden brown colour. Stick on a plate and then watch as my kids eat them all and I have nothing to eat for lunch.   I've been using this method for over a year now and the seitan does vary from very puffy to quite stodgy but it's always quite edible. (I used to add vital yeast flakes to the mix but don't tend to bother nowadays.)"
veganrecipes,3ae965,oniony,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:38:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! That answers a question I didn't know I had-can seitan be frozen. Does it mess with the texture much?
veganrecipes,3ae965,oniony,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it affects the taste at all. The resultant fried seitan tends to be less fluffy but it tastes just fine. I think for the convenience factor it's well worth it.  I've also found that the amount I defrost it affects how it fries too.   Also if you want to avoid frying you can bake or roast it in the oven instead, though I find it too dry without the oil: high protein foods tend to be very dry unless you oil them up."

If you navigate to the google books version of the cookbook, you can see the page that it's on (page 21), so you don't need to buy the cookbook.

veganrecipes,3ab8t4,AdmiralMango,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:37:31 2015 UTC,"Mock duck:       Mock duck is a gluten-based vegetarian food. It is made of wheat gluten, oil, sugar, soy sauce, and salt.   It is thus high in protein. Its distinctive flavor and artificial ""plucked duck"" texture distinguish it from other forms of commercially available gluten products. Mock duck can be found in some Chinese grocery stores or retail outlets providing international selections of food. Similar products may be labeled as ""Mock Abalone"" or ""Cha'i Pow Yu"" (齋鮑魚; pinyin: zhāibàoyú).  Typically, mock duck gains its flavor from the stewing of the gluten product in soy sauce and MSG.

veganrecipes,3a7z91,lithiumninja,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:16:56 2015 UTC,"The best ones I've made are soy creamer based. Here is a basic recipe.    With a basic recipe down, you can play around a bit. For example, you can make the above recipe, but replace the vanilla and the sugar with a disc of Ibarra chocolate. After it comes out of the ice cream maker, quickly stir in another disk of Ibarra that you've chopped up into nice chunks, then toss the whole thing in the freezer to harden.     Or you can leave out the vanilla and replace it with a quarter cup of pureed strawberries. Have a cup of diced strawberries cooling in the fridge while the ice cream is being made. When it comes out of the ice cream maker, toss in the berries, stir and plop it in the freezer."

If they are too many steps then you could blend up some frozen bananas with a little bit of coconut milk and vanilla. So delicious!

veganrecipes,39dy3e,fishbedc,8,Thu Jun 11 02:42:15 2015 UTC,"Here's my recipe, I sort of cludged it together from these two different recipes and veganised it.  Ingredients   500g/1lb 2oz white haricot beans, dried. Actually I used butter beans and think that is better. A big lunk of bacony seitan, if available, cut into chunks, bigger chunks for bigger beans. 50g/2oz/3 tbsp soft brown sugar 45g/3 tbsp black treacle 1 tbsp English mustard (made fresh from powder) 4 cloves 8-10 pickling onions (or 2-3 small onions), some chopped fine, the rest halved if bigger than a golf ball and the largest studded with the cloves 1/2 litre of hot stock (1 veggie Oxo and 1/2 porcini cube seems OK) fresh ground black pepper salt bay leaves   Method     Soak the beans overnight in plenty of fresh cold water and 1tsp bicarbonate of soda.. Drain and rinse, then put in a big pan, with fresh water to cover the beans by about 5cm/2in. Bring to the boil and boil hard for at least 10 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Heat some oil in the slow cooker pan, brown the seitan chunks. Soften the chopped onions with the seitan. Add the beans, sugar, treacle, bay leaves. Cover with the stock, stir everything in. Push the onions in so that they are covered by liquid. Top up with hot water if needed to make sure all just covered. Pop the lid on and put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low. Check after a few hours and add salt as needed and top up with hot water if required. Serve on it's own, with crusty bread (or on toast), gorgeous on a big bed of cabbage. The baked beans will keep in the fridge, in a sealed jar or tupperware container, for two weeks. You can also freeze any leftovers.   Now I added the salt at the start (this recipe is written after the event) which was probably a mistake as I had to cook the damn thing for nigh on 16 hours till they softened up. I also found that topping up the liquid so that all the beans were evenly cooked might have sped things up. I'm still learning to use a slow-cooker (I think our cousins call it a crock-pot?) so any advice gratefully received.  The texture and richness are quite something. I thought of upping it by adding red wine to the stock. Since you can apparently use a slow-cooker to steam things I have conceived of an evil plan to line a pudding bowl with rolled out dumpling dough, fill it with Beans Au Vin, pop a top on it and make vegan steak and kidney pudding. Goddamit that would be a fine thing."

veganrecipes,39bhq0,white_crust_delivery,11,Wed Jun 10 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Just to confirm-if you make something vegan, it'll be OK for the others. Halal covers ritual slaughter and prohibits the consumption of some meats and seafoods; kosher means meat must be purged of blood, prohibits the consumption of some meats and seafoods, and also the consumption of meat and milk together. Vegan foods neatly circumvent all those restrictions :)  How about a stew of the peppers and mushrooms, with baked yams and avocado/spinach salad?"
veganrecipes,39bhq0,Ivyleaf3,6,Wed Jun 10 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"Veggie chili? This could use some: bell pepper, sweet potato/yam, mushrooms, tinned beans, tomato paste (or tin of diced/stewed tomatoes if you have those). And yam or spinach if you're feeling fancy (cube yam and cook in chili; chop and add spinach right at the end, just to wilt it). Add lots of spices: garlic, onion, chili powder, cumin and oregano. Serve on rice. Avocado or guacumole (=avo + lemon!) to garnish.  And apple crisp for dessert? Google will find you more specific instructions for both. You got this, man, have fun!"
veganrecipes,39bhq0,girlontheprairie,3,Wed Jun 10 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"So, out of your ingredients I would make a 3-dish main course, with a bean/pulse main, a yam side and a salad. It's a complete meal, it'll impress your guests, it's easy to cook and it'll use up all of your veg.  Yams: roast the yam with bell peppers, in big chunks, in loads of olive oil with salt and pepper and garlic. Google how long to roast the yam, I suspect about 45 mins and throw in the peppers after 15 mins. I'd get the oil nice and hot in the oven before putting in the yams and baste them every 15 mins.   I'd make an avocado salad with the spinach. You can do a lemon dressing, with about 1/4 lemon juice, 3/4 olive oil, a pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt. Go easy on the salt and sugar - add a tiny bit at a time and taste it after each bit. Black pepper goes in nicely too, or herbs if you have any. You can also add nuts to the salad if you have some, or orange slices/mandarin segments, they go really well.  And the main dish: you can use either the canned beans or dried pulses, if you pre-cook them according to instructions. If you have an onion, fry it first til it's well cooked. Chop the mushrooms and fry them on a hot heat, then add the beans/pulses. Add black pepper and paprika, chili, cayenne or anything smoky, garlic, maybe if you've got some bbq sauce in the fridge add a bit, and a little bit of lemon juice. Cook it on a high heat for a few mins til the spices are cooked and the mushrooms and beans have some golden bits. Then add the pasta sauce and cook it until it's really thick."
veganrecipes,39bhq0,katrionatronica,3,Thu Jun 11 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"There's a bunch of stuff you can do! For nice dinners with friends over I usually try something found at the vegan section of SeriousEats, their recipes are often a fair amount of work but always incredibly good.  If you want something easier, this chickpea and onion stew has been a smash hit with everyone I've cooked it for. It's very easy, takes about an hour, and tastes great.  Slightly fancier, this nut roast recipe is my go-to for potlucks etc., it's good, but needs a light side salad of some sort. I've found the recipe calls for too little fluids, make sure you use enough so it doesn't become dry and (too) crumbly. Decorate with a sprig of thyme!  For dessert, kiwi-lime granita is annoying to make (scrape with a fork every 30 minutes for proper texture - super annoying), but it tastes amazing and is ideal during summer. This recipe isn't vegan (it has honey), but you can sub agave syrup in a 1:1 ratio with no problems. When I make this I tend to make a huge batch and have dessert for a while in the freezer."

I went to three different Asian markets before I was able to find canned Jackfruit in water (not syrup, which is super important). I live in a large metropolitan area so I didn't think it would be so difficult to find. As this recipe mentions, though, you can order it on Amazon."

I learned to tell the difference by feeling the skin-yams have a much rougher, huskier skin whereas sweet potatoes have a thinner skin.  http://www.ncsweetpotatoes.com/sweet-potatoes-101/difference-between-yam-and-sweet-potato/"

veganrecipes,37le23,bmaxxx,2,Thu May 28 13:53:31 2015 UTC,"I encountered this dish as a teenager. My best friend's dad is American and met his future wife while serving in Italy. Eating at their house was always fun because it was multi-generational (""Mama"" moved to the states with them), so every meal was very traditional multi-course Italian.  One summer we had been swimming at the local pool, and I was invited over for lunch. His mom had a variety of dishes ready to go, including this pasta salad which I loved so much, I never forgot it, decades later. I developed a version which comes close, but doesn't beat the original.  -boil pasta. I think she used gnocchiette (little gnocchi shaped pasta), but I use fusili or radiatore, any vegan shape you can find that holds sauce. drain and cool, but don't rinse. Reserve some of the pasta water.  To a blender add at least 2 cups of (pitted!!) kalamata olives, 2 garlic cloves, a teaspoon of dried oregano, a small handful of pine nuts, a small bunch of parsley, and a generous grind or two of pepper.  Blend, adding sufficient extra virgin olive oil to make a loose paste- a little thinner than you think you need.  a dash of vinegar is nice but not essential. you can also make it creamy with the addition of a tablespoon of Vegenaise or the like.  mix in a couple shakes of red pepper flakes at this point if you like it spicy. mix with the cooled pasta. Chill for an hour, covered. at serving time, mix a little pasta water to make it creamier, if needed.  goes really well with a chilled Pinot Grigio on a hot day."
veganrecipes,37le23,SmittyFjordmanjensen,1 point,Thu May 28 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"Since you said you'll already have peppers/mushrooms/tomatoes/onion on hand why not a chilled pasta salad with all those things chopped into it? I like to use interesting pasta shapes, or homemade pasta made half with spinach and half with something else. Sometimes carrots, sometimes apples, depends what I am using for a dressing.  From there you could go Greek with chopped cucumber and Kalamata olives, and top it with a lemon oregano dressing. Just mix the juice from a lemon with a tablespoon Dijon mustard, half a tablespoon dried or a couple teaspoons fresh oregano, 2 garlic clove, salt and pepper to taste, and half cup olive oil with a sprinkle of vinegar.  Or you could go Mexican. Sometimes I make the pasta with a hint of cinnamon and cumin for this one. I add some cooked and rinsed black beans and grilled sweet corn cut from the cob. I dress it with agave jalapeno dressing. Two tablespoons fresh cilantro, three tablespoons lime juice, half a tablespoon agave or a little more to taste, a jalapeno (seeds removed if you don't want it too hot), two cloves garlic, and a cup and a third of cashew sour cream. Thin it down with a bit of olive oil and a sprinkle of vinegar if it seems thick. I like it with some fresh cracked pepper over the top.  Sometimes I make a Thai pasta salad. I lightly 'grill' a few soy beans by tossing them into a hot caste iron pan. I'll throw in sesame seeds, seeded cucumber, fine shredded napa cabbage, maybe a few chopped cashews for crunch. Sometimes I do a peanut dressing in the food processor. I'll throw in peanuts to make about a quarter cup of peanut butter, add 2-3 garlic cloves, around 2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar, 2-3 tablespoons of agave to taste, juice from a lime, about 1 inch square piece of ginger rough chopped, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flake, tablespoon-ish of soy sauce (not more than), handful fresh cilantro leaves (about 2 tablespoons). Sometimes i leave out the pasta and just do that one as a cabbage salad, but I really love it with Cavatappi corkscrews. I also love spinach and apple homemade pasta for this.  Sometimes if I don't have peanuts on hand, I'll saute some carrots, garlic, onion, and a little ginger and lemon grass in a bit of olive oil and add Thai red curry paste. Heating the red curry paste really gets the flavors blooming. Then I blend it up with more olive oil, a little rice wine vinegar, a little lime juice, some sweet chili sauce, and some red bell pepper, and salt, pepper, and agave to taste. You can put out some chili oil for if anyone likes it spicy.  Edit: each variation would be with the base pasta salad with what you have on hand, plus stuff to give it a twist. Hope that was clear."

veganrecipes,37klaz,ausvegguyk,1 point,Thu May 28 08:57:24 2015 UTC,I also tried boiling it too- it looked a little like fishcake- and I wasn't sure if I liked that sort of texture. Do you have a recipe for a brine? Or do you think it is better to just boil it in water?
veganrecipes,37klaz,ausvegguyk,2,Thu May 28 09:02:32 2015 UTC,"i don't have a recipe.. i really like to eyeball things, and experiment rather than copying (personal choice, it's good to get inspiration from things) what i usually do is put some chilli in the seitan itself, and put a mixture of soy sauce, lemon juice, something sweet (raw sugar, agave, etc) in the broth, it's really hard to mess it up, big margin of error, so just add the ingredients to your own taste.  edit: oh, i think i added baking soda to the broth once or twice... i cant recall whether it actually did anything or not  it tastes good with or without the sugar, so that's up to you."
veganrecipes,37klaz,ausvegguyk,2,Thu May 28 09:09:34 2015 UTC,"oh, just looking at the recipe you mentioned, don't put soy in the seitan mixture, only the broth, when i bake it i also usually have the seitan dough rather plain, and bake it in a shallow pool or broth... i think either way works for the oven (mixing it in probably is better for the oven, but might be worth a try for you)"

If you boil it on low hear for a few hours, allow it to cool in the broth, then bake cutlets in an aluminum foil pouch- it should be tender, juicy, and not at all chewy.

veganrecipes,37d9s6,gia_was_here,5,Tue May 26 19:58:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. My favourite way is:  Wash the brine off the Tofu and dry it a touch. Then chop it into cubes or slices and put it in a container. Sprinkle in some ground Ginger and Oregano. Add some Sweet Thai Chilli Sauce And pour in quite a bit of Soy Sauce. Shake it all around and then put a lid on the container and leave it for as long as possible (sometimes I leave it over night, sometimes I leave it for 5 mins. All depends on how much prep time you have). Then I fry it but I try to just put the Tofu in the pan without too much excess Marinate pouring in; otherwise it becomes too strong. Damn, im getting hungry just thinking of it!"
veganrecipes,37d9s6,T-Lloyd25,1 point,Wed May 27 03:53:54 2015 UTC,I'll try it. Thanks.
veganrecipes,37d9s6,machyna,2,Wed May 27 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"You marinate your tofu in that mix, right?"
veganrecipes,37d9s6,comicsandpoppunk,1 point,Wed May 27 02:16:39 2015 UTC,Not marinate. I drain the tofu well (in between papertowels on a plate i put something heavy on it for an hour or longer) then cut it in cubes. I make the spice blend on a plate and then dip every corner of every tofu piece in the spice mixture  and pan fry them.  I'm thinking that marinating tofu ahead of time would definitely make it taste even better.
veganrecipes,37d9s6,armadillokirb,1 point,Wed May 27 03:08:10 2015 UTC,What type of tofu are you using? Is it straight from the brine or do you freeze/defrost it before use?

Mix dry ingredients,  add/mix in wet ingredients bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes.   I think for lavender you can always sub the vanilla extract for lavender extract and add some lavender buds ground up nice and fine. For orange cake sub one cup of the water for orange juice or orange liquor (triple sec or something similar) also add some orange zest. I think that would be really nice with this."

Be sure to double the amount of garlic, though, since roasting mellows out the flavor. Top garlic or red pepper hummus with za'atar, a delicious spice blend made with sumac, thyme, sesame seeds, and salt. I suspect that mild paprika would make a good subsitute for sumac, or you can find a blend pre-made like I did.  Add marinated artichoke hearts (drained) and lightly steamed and drained spinach. This Moroccan-spiced carrot hummus.  Sundried tomato hummus. Skip the chickpeas and use white beans. Add basil (fresh if you can get it), or you can be lazy and add a good dollop of vegan pesto."

veganrecipes,36b179,check4traps,3,Mon May 18 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"Harissa:       Harissa (Arabic: هريسة‎ | harîsa) is a Tunisian hot chili pepper paste the main ingredients of which are roasted red peppers, serrano peppers and other hot chili peppers and spices and herbs such as garlic paste, coriander seed, or caraway as well as some vegetable or olive oil for preservation. It is most closely associated with Tunisia, Libya and Algeria  but recently also making inroads into Morocco according to Moroccan food expert Paula Wolfert.  As with the European cuisine, chili peppers were imported into Maghrebian cuisine via the Columbian Exchange,  presumably during the Spanish occupation of Tunisia between 1535 and 1574.  Recipes for harissa vary according to the household and region. Variations can include the addition of cumin, red peppers, garlic, coriander, and lemon juice. In Saharan regions, harissa can have a smoky flavor. [citation needed] Prepared harissa is also sold in jars, cans, bottles, tubes, plastic bags and other containers.

Smaller soft-shell tacos with avocado, refried beans, etc. would be tasty too.  One thing I do like to do with the breaded chikn products is slice them up and make a bbq chikn pizza--- so good."
veganrecipes,35lrso,carlaacat,2,Mon May 11 19:42:09 2015 UTC,Rubbery? What? The Beyond Meat strips actually tear apart like real chicken. It's eerie. Did you buy them frozen and not completely defrost them?
veganrecipes,35lrso,veggiesandmeows,1 point,Tue May 12 08:21:32 2015 UTC,"Nope, they were fresh from the fridge. Just really dense, overly chewy, and rubbery, stringy texture or not. I prefer more like the texture of Quorn or even Morningstar."
veganrecipes,35lrso,DustbinK,1 point,Tue May 12 11:30:14 2015 UTC,"I prefer Beyond Meat chicken strips. I chop it into cubes and then start with a bit of vegan butter in a pan. I brown the chicken in the butter, then add some taco seasoning, S+P, mesquite seasoning, and a bit of water. When the liquid is gone, I add some almond milk and more taco seasoning. I do this with the milk about 2-3 times until the chicken has reached an almost creamy-like consistency on the outside, reminiscent of how lots of Mexican restaurants cook their chicken for quesadillas. Once it's marinated enough in the pan with those ingredients, I take it out and toss it into tacos with rice, beans, etc. I love it like that! Now I want tacos, damn."

If you buy agar agar flakes, increase the amount to 1.5 TBSP  INSTRUCTIONS   Mix the cashew milk, sweetener, cocoa, vanilla and salt in a pot over medium heat stirring frequently. Mix the kanten with 2 tbsp of hot water to dissolve. Pour the kanten mixture in to the cashew milk mixture and stir continuously for about 5 minutes.

Bean chili, no need for meat and no need for cheese especially if you top it with avocado!  Hummus, of course. I've started making my own and it tastes 200x better than the stuff you can buy in stores.  A lot of Asian dishes involving tofu and vegetables, since they very rarely call for dairy."
veganrecipes,34y75n,camn,3,Tue May 5 15:55:42 2015 UTC,Hummus protip from a Lebanese family: peel the damn chickpeas before you blend it all. It makes a world of difference in the creaminess. Too often have I had subpar hummus at restaurants because the chickpeas weren't peeled.

Recently I've started roasting my garlic first-- it makes a huge difference, and adds extra creaminess to the hummus. You just have to double up the amount of garlic because otherwise it won't be garlicky enough!  It's also tasty with some olive oil drizzled on top and a generous sprinkle of za'atar."

Cut the red peppers in half and under the grill until the skin bubbles and can be peeled off 2.  Submerge the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water for about 1 minute, then remove, then you can peel them easily (remove the hard bit while peeling). Then chop them roughly. 3.  Roughly chop the courgette and onion. 4.     Blend that bad boy up!  You can add more salt or olive oil to taste. Also you can save some of the onion to have finely chopped on top. Also, if you are a cucumber fan you can use that instead of courgette but you will need to peel them for optimum results :)"
