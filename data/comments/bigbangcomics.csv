bigbangcomics,3cuuhb,autowikibot,2,Fri Jul 10 23:49:18 2015 UTC,"Tethys (moon):       Tethys or Saturn III is a mid-sized moon of Saturn about 1,060 km (660 mi) across. It was discovered by G. D. Cassini in 1684 and is named after the titan Tethys of Greek mythology.  Tethys has a low density of 0.98 g/cm3, the lowest of all the major moons in the Solar System, indicating that it is made of water ice with just a small fraction of rock. This is confirmed by the spectroscopy of its surface, which identified water ice as the dominant surface material. A small amount of an unidentified dark material is present as well. The surface of Tethys is very bright, being the second-brightest of the moons of Saturn after Enceladus, and neutral in color.  Tethys is heavily cratered and cut by a number of large faults/graben. The largest impact crater, Odysseus, is about 400 km in diameter, whereas the largest graben, Ithaca Chasma, is about 100 km wide and more than 2000 km long. These two largest surface features may be related. A small part of the surface is covered by smooth plains that may be cryovolcanic in origin. Like all other regular moons of Saturn, Tethys formed from the Saturnian sub-nebula—a disk of gas and dust that surrounded Saturn soon after its formation.  Tethys has been approached by several space probes including Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980), Voyager 2 (1981), and multiple times by Cassini since 2004.

However, parodies of the term “bazinga” did not begin appearing on 4chan until December 25th, in a thread on the /tv/ (Television and Film) board.[17] After the first poster asked why people did not enjoy The Big Bang Theory, the first four responses consisted of nonsense words “bazoopie,” “bazonkers,” “cowabazunga” and “bazopple.” Also on the 25th, an instance of these comics (shown below, left) was shared on Tumblr[19], attributing it to 4chan. The following day, a second, larger /tv/ thread[18] was posted, with low-resolution comics using comic sans and purposefully unfunny science jokes.  http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/465/269/435.jpg  http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/462/312/b23.png  Source: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bazinga"

I've been a sub for a log while now and while most older videos were funny, they would be considered tame by the standards of the videos today.

Personally, the more ridiculous it gets means more hilarity for me. There are posts on here so ridiculous that I wouldn't hesitate to call them modern art.

(November 2013) Penny The Big Bang Theory character Penny bigbangtheory.jpg Kaley Cuoco as Penny First appearance    ""Pilot"" Created by    Chuck Lorre Bill Prady   Portrayed by    Kaley Cuoco Information Nickname(s)       ""Bestie"" (by Amy) ""Slugger"" (by her father Wyatt)   Occupation    Waitress Aspiring actress Student Pharmaceutical rep   Family    Unnamed mother Wyatt (father) Unnamed sister Unnamed brother   Significant other(s)      Dr. Leonard Hofstadter (fiancé) Zack Johnson (2010-2013; annulled)   Nationality     American  Penny is a fictional character on the CBS sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, portrayed by actress Kaley Cuoco. She is the primary female character in the series, befriending her across-the-hall neighbors Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), two physicists who work at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Penny's lack of advanced education, but outgoing personality and common sense drastically contrast with the personalities of the primary male characters in the series, even though she is considered part of their group. She is the love interest of Leonard, with whom she maintains a brief romantic relationship during the third season, which is later resumed in the fifth season and culminates in an engagement at the end of the seventh season. Penny is the only main character of the show whose last name has not been revealed.  Contents  1 Personality     1.1 Interaction with Sheldon     1.2 Nerd traits 2 Financial issues 3 Family 4 Work 5 Relationships 6 Development 7 See also 8 References   Personality  Originally from a small town outside of Omaha, Nebraska, Penny has aspirations of becoming an actress. Until the seventh season, she worked as a waitress at the local Cheesecake Factory.[1][2] She is a Sagittarius, born on December 2.[3] She has full confidence in horoscopes and psychics, which has led to arguments with Sheldon and Leonard about their accuracy.[2][3]  In contrast to the rest of the group, Penny is not well-educated or savvy in a specific technical field, but she has great social skills and is more streetwise than her neighbors. She is very knowledgeable about popular culture.[4] She is messy and disorganized, but appears to like it that way.[5] Having dropped out of community college prior to the start of the series, she is the only regular character with less education than Howard Wolowitz, who has a Master's degree. Despite her weak education, she is insightful. While Sheldon routinely disparages both Penny's and Howard's educations, he occasionally acknowledges her intelligence and potential, though he rarely treats Howard so. He has also asked for her advice more than once regarding various social situations.  Leonard has likened her to The Hulk when she gets angry,[6] while Sheldon once said to recurring character Stuart Bloom that she would ""maul [him] like a rabid wolverine"" if Stuart woke her up from a sound sleep.[7]  A recurring theme is Penny's poor driving. She fails to service her vehicle regularly, and ignores her check engine light, which has been mentioned in multiple episodes.[8][9] She once left her car's passenger side wing mirror in a parking lot.[10] She once hit a Mercedes in a parking lot and left without leaving a note.[11] She also inadvertently revealed that she knocked the mirror off Bernadette's car and did not leave a note.[12] When her car's engine finally fails in Season 7, Leonard buys her a new one so she can go to auditions and pursue her dream of becoming an actress. In Season 8, after founding job as a representative at Bernadette's company, she obtained a company car and sold the one Leonard had bought for her, returning him the money.[13]  In the fifth season episode ""The Speckerman Recurrence"", it is revealed that Penny was a bully during her time at school. However, she seemed to be genuinely unaware of the hurt her actions had caused, and upon her realization, she attempted to make amends with a classmate she tormented, with little success.[14]  A recurring personality trait is her consumption of alcohol, specifically wine. In ""The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition"", Penny, while spending the evening with Bernadette and Amy, observes that they have finished the bottle of wine, and when Bernadette and Amy point out that they consumed only half a glass and no wine at all respectively, Penny snaps, ""Okay, don't judge me! So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"" At the end of that episode, she passes out while the three of them play Twister, and when Bernadette initially fails to revive her, she says ""Penny, we're out of wine"", which manages to wake Penny. In ""The Locomotive Manipulation"", Leonard declines Amy's suggestion that the group spend a weekend in Napa Valley, leading to this exchange:  Leonard: ""I'm not sure it's a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. (Looks at Penny) What? It's a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it's all for laughs.""  Penny: ""That would really piss me off if I didn't have a buzz going on.""   Interaction with Sheldon  A staple of the series' humor is Penny's awkward interactions with Sheldon, which are fueled by the fact that they are almost polar opposites in terms of intellect and social aptitude.  In one episode, Sheldon tries to ""improve"" Penny, rewarding her with chocolate for what he considers ""correct behavior"", as in operant conditioning of lab rats. Leonard noticed it and accused Sheldon of modifying her like Pavlov's Dogs .[15] Although the two characters sometimes clash, and Penny is frequently irritated by Sheldon's obstinacy and lack of social awareness, she has developed an affection for him. She and Leonard occasionally behave as if Sheldon were their child, and Penny is very pleased whenever Sheldon acts tenderly towards her. Penny often calls Sheldon ""sweetie"", a term of endearment she rarely uses with other characters (a fact that Sheldon has himself pointed out), and Penny and Amy are the only principal characters who ever openly demonstrate their genuine fondness for Sheldon.  Evidence of Penny's affection for Sheldon is apparent in various episodes. Penny takes care of Sheldon while he is ill[16] and lets him stay at her apartment when he is locked out of his;[17] Sheldon lent her money when she needed it[18] and takes care of her when she dislocates her shoulder.[10] Despite not being as well versed as the men in geek culture, Penny has shown attention to what each of her friends likes. For instance, during a Christmas episode, Penny gives Sheldon a signed napkin autographed by Leonard Nimoy. In return, Sheldon gives Penny several baskets of bath products and then a long hug, to both her and Leonard's surprise. When Sheldon's World of Warcraft account is hacked and the four men all back down from the much larger hacker who also steals Sheldon's Klingon Bat'leth, Penny kicks the hacker in the groin. Following her breakup with Leonard, Penny takes Sheldon along when she and some friends from work went to Disneyland, for which he is thankful. In the same episode, she notes that she takes Sheldon shopping for his linens. She has also helped Sheldon resolve conflicts with Amy, as in ""The Shiny Trinket Maneuver"".  Sheldon has also acknowledged that he likes Penny, although he claims this was only because he was forced to because Leonard ""made him"", and that Sheldon liking her was a ""hard row to hoe"".[19] Despite Sheldon's overall friendly interaction with Penny, he does, on occasion, not always intentionally, insult her intelligence. Nerd traits  A number of episodes depict Penny's assimilation of nerd culture through her relationship with the men, and has developed to quote some science fiction shows (like Star Trek), and movies (Star Wars). After Sheldon introduces her to the online role-playing game Age of Conan, Penny becomes addicted, to the point of ignoring her friends, her hygiene, her general appearance and her job, and pesters Sheldon incessantly for gaming advice. She finally overcomes her addiction when she realizes she has agreed to go on a virtual date within the game with Howard.[20]  In episodes such as ""The Apology Insufficiency"", ""The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition"", ""The Wheaton Recurrence"" and ""The Love Car Displacement"", she makes casual references to Star Trek.[21] In ""The Bakersfield Expedition"", Penny, Amy and Bernadette read some of the men's comics, believing there is nothing interested in them, only to get into a huge heated argument about whenever or not only Thor could yield his hammer.[22] In season 7's ""The Proton Transmogrification"", she alarms herself when she realizes that she understands Raj and Howard's corny Star Wars-related puns.  Penny sometimes references science and technology-related ideas. In ""The Codpiece Topology"", Penny, having previously learned of Schrödinger's Cat in ""The Tangerine Factor"", is seen explaining that concept to her date. In the ""The Beta Test Initiation"", Penny references beta testing when he uses a software development analogy, to describe their attempt to start a romantic relationship again, although Leonard points out he was technically talking about alpha testing. Financial issues  A recurring theme throughout the series is Penny's ongoing financial problems. This is seen in ""The Financial Permeability"", when she finds herself behind on her bills, and borrows money from Sheldon, only to later become paranoid that he is pestering her for repayment, even though he makes no such indications of this. More subtle references are seen in the fact that she once attempted to pay for her electric bill using a Starbucks gift card,"

bigbangcomics,386mpy,ZebraRT,15,Tue Jun 2 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"The Big Bang Theory is een Amerikaanse komische televisieserie, bedacht door Chuck Lorre en Bill Prady. De serie ging in première op CBS op 24 september 2007. De serie focust zich op het leven van de vijf personages, die in Pasadena wonen. De hoofdrollen worden vertolkt door Jim Parsons als Sheldon Cooper, Johnny Galecki als Leonard Hofstadter, Simon Helberg als Howard Wolowitz, Kunal Nayyar als Raj Koothrappali en Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting als Penny.  In Nederland is de reeks sinds 2 maart 2009 te zien op Veronica. In Vlaanderen is ze sinds 21 december van dat jaar te bekijken op 2BE.  Er zijn inmiddels zeven seizoenen van de serie geproduceerd en CBS heeft nog eens drie extra seizoenen besteld, wat het (voorlopige) totaal op tien seizoenen brengt."

bigbangcomics,2pfxkb,Brave__Toaster,14,Wed Dec 17 05:40:38 2014 UTC,"I don't like the show that much but I think this exaggerates how bad it is. Something you need to keep in mind here is that by removing the laugh track you've removed all the sound where the laugh track would be. This makes it more obvious because not only is the laugh track gone, there's no ambient noise either. If they didn't put a laugh track there in the first place they would at least still have ambient noise obviously. But what you have in this video is a joke plus surrounding noise and then you literally hear nothing, which makes the video more awkward than it really would be without a laugh track."
bigbangcomics,2pfxkb,SinisterExaggerator_,5,Tue Dec 23 21:27:06 2014 UTC,Yeah this guy just silenced out the parts of laughing. He could have sampled the laughs and removed them from the whole audio track.

Your offhanded remark has single handedly made me reevaluate my position on the matter! When you made the insightful comment of (forgive me if I paraphrase) 'k', I was taken aback! I thought to myself, ""/u/UnluckyLuke, have you really thought about all of the subtleties and nuances of your position regarding this matter? Perhaps you should reconsider your outlook."" Oh wait. No I didn't.   lel   why would you use lel instead of lol? Think about it. It doesn't mean anything, its just the modification of the actual acronym lol. You don't even know why you use it. Somewhere, sometime you saw a few people post it and hopped right on board. Too mainstream for lol right? Thats so old, its meaning makes sense but you dont feel comfortable expressing your approval of things on the internet with the common old ""lol"" thats been around for so long. You'll man up and use the purposely misspelled version with no discernible humor or purpose besides making you look like a complete idiot while you maintain the false concept that other people find it amusing or appropriate and using purposely misspelled words shows the world that youre not afraid of anything and are part of some grand inside joke that no one finds funny. Theres a lot going through your head, but you realize I am right. You will try though, to get the best of this exchange. What are you going to go for? Newfag? Summer? oh damn there are so many options to choose from. An implication that I'm underage perhaps? Thats always fresh. Maybe you'll just shut down. I think you should go with something about butthurt or being mad or even comment on the length of the unproportionally long comment that so swiftly brought to your attention that you are a faggot that tries oh so hard to fit in. Careful though, is this even oc? Tsk tsk hard to say dont want to get embarrassed anon. I'm sure you could find some grammar or spelling errors as a last resort. I cant wait, Its always fun playing insult roulette   le   lel seriously guys, and this goes for the entirety of Reddit, this sub included. The ""le"" circlejerk is the most annoying fucking thing on the planet. I guess it implies that the speaker is a neckbeard or something, but honestly, I don't give a fuck. ""Le"" was used as an old internet joke in rage comics back in the day and then died out. Plenty of people were in on the joke back then, and now nobody is. But here's the twist: now, it's ALL OVER THE FUCKING PLACE. /r/lewronggeneration probably being the best example. Seriously, can reddit beat a dead horse any harder? It's the most bullshit cop-out insult in existence, and every time I see it I just assume whoever was writing it is just too stupid to think of a valid criticism, so they just throw ""le"" before whatever they hate. I mean, god damn, does anyone actually use the term ""le"" seriously anymore? No. Now it's just used so people can stroke their dicks over how not awkward they are because they don't use an outdated internet term."
bigbangcomics,2b31jz,UnluckyLuke,6,Thu Aug 7 01:32:03 2014 UTC,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved. In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for free for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply publicize what the music business wants to make money with.  Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. And rock critics will study more of rock history and realize who invented what and who simply exploited it commercially.  Beatles' ""aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll: it replaced syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.  Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for a good reason. They could not figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). THat phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Fours'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"". Not to mention later and far greater British musicians. Not to mention the American musicians who created what the Beatles later sold to the masses.  The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial band."

But the big bang theory is kinda ruined for me now, but these comics has also made me realise how much of their content is repeated and outdated. Sheldon used to make me laugh but after 6 seasons, I just wanna punch him in the throat everytime he does or say something that we are suppose to laugh about.  The catch phrase ""Bazinga!"" started out as a silly thing which made me laugh, but now they are using it way too much which totaly makes some episodes cringe worthy IMO."
