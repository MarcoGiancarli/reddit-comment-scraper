In the books he apparently is commanding the watch to march to Winterfell to help his sister, thus ""For the watch"" -which is a more acceptable reason to kill him in my opinion"
aSongOfMemesAndRage,3d96b1,eltappo,6,Tue Jul 14 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"I had the same emotional reaction to Jon's stabbing in both book and show. The part about him wanting to lead the Watch against the Boltons was like ""Now Jon, you ought not to do that"", but the main thing that really turned the watch against him was the bit with the wildlings and giants being let through. The plan to march on Winterfell with just the proverbial straw."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,3d96b1,Duh_And_Or_Hello_,3,Tue Jul 14 18:04:28 2015 UTC,Is it to help his sister? My initial take away from the Pink Letter was: 1. Ramsay wrote it. 2. Stannis is dead. 3.  Turn over Stannis and Wildling people or 4. I will destroy or at least attack the Night's Watch.  Figuring that ripping out Jon's heart will mean at least some crows dead.    So it's an expanded short sightedNess on the watch's part in both show and book.  It's just the book went into it more.

aSongOfMemesAndRage,3b8vzq,emoposer,-1,Sat Jun 27 05:51:31 2015 UTC,"What I personally don't like about books is that you lose the element of acting. A great actor brings a character to life better than my imagination could. Especially since Game of Thrones has such an incredible cast.   For practical reasons it's impossible for the show to be 1:1 recreation of the books, there is just way too much stuff to cover but the show does do most of it."

aSongOfMemesAndRage,3b8vzq,Spartan152,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem. There's no consistency, there's no arc. They're doing most scenes from the books, sort of, but they're not connected at all anymore. It's going to crush itself under its own weight if this continues.   It's just scene scene scene scene rape scene death scene credits because they're more focused on their piss-poor streamlining of the plot and unnecessary warping of characters to fit their agenda. don't read the books if you love the show, until one is finished. Because otherwise you get to analyze as you watch and become disappointed a little more each day."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,3b8vzq,emoposer,2,Sat Jun 27 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, I haven't read the books. They're sitting on desk but I haven't got past the first page of A Game of Thrones. I definitely would not say there is no arc. Daenerys and Jon had similar arcs both facing large foes (Sons of the Harpy/Army of the Dead) and both underwent large amounts of character development.  Jon showed strong leadership (and ""killed the boy) when he went to save the Wildlings despite massive disapproval and Daenerys reopened the fighting pits and learned that being a politician is as important as being a queen. These are awesome arcs.   Dorne was handled poorly but redeemed somewhat with that shocking death and the emotional build up to it. Arya's story was probably my favorite this season and she had a great arc. It was awesome seeing the struggle between her need for revenge and her desire to become ""no one"".   When it comes to being connected, I think Jamie getting back to King's Landing and getting some Greyjoy next season will make it feel more focused."

But his points were as followed: *Mel thought that Stannis was Azor Ahai, but she misinterpreted it. It was his blood, not necessarily him. * Mel could resurrect Shireen (which could use a red star, salt, and smoke) through blood magic.   Mel technically created a lightbringer sword for Stannis..which Shireeen would have access to. By getting sacrificed for Stannis, she inadvertently sacrificed herself and helps to fulfill the prophecy. The grey scale that she was born with could be in connection with ""waking the dragons from stone."" Baratheons technically have Targaryen blood. She can definitely rally people and connect with them.    I know it is a reach, but I thought it would be fun to share.  (EDIT: formatting)"

aSongOfMemesAndRage,3a1hb9,stillbatting1000,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"This is a comment I made earlier in another thread but it still fits perfect here. I Think it is beyond fucked up that there is more respect for Stannis in this thread alone than there was in the entirety of season 5. I mean they (the show writers) really did him dirty. Stannis is probably the best General in the kingdom (Tywin not being counted) And his army was made to fight like a game of Total War on easy mode. Also According to the aerial shots Stannis had like maybe 2000 (being very generous with the quick head count) and probably closer to 1000 while the CGi Bolton army had them outnumbered and out horsed at least 3 to 1 and could have easily surrounded his entire force in a matter of minutes. Yet somehow the scene ends with Ramsay finishing off soldiers on a grassy hill. Stannis Marched from the woods towards the fields, Ramsay Rode from fields towards the woods. Which means for that soldier who surrendered to Ramsay he would have had to flee TOWARDS WINTERFELL AND TOWARDS THE ADVANCING ARMY. Meanwhile according to the show Stannis fled to the woods where apparently they just let him be. So Camera errors and PlotForce aside they didn't even show his death. (and apparently it is confirmed he is dead) which is just the worst possible Tv or movie Sin you can commit."

aSongOfMemesAndRage,39z77c,im_not_afraid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Ratones Coloraos interview meme of article  El Risitas:       In June 2007, Joya appeared on Jesús Quintero's show Ratones Coloraos and described an incident when he worked as a dishwasher. He describes leaving some paella pans (paelleras) at night in the ocean to soak and clean, and when in the morning he returned to retrieve the pans, they had washed out to sea because of high tide.  The original video was uploaded to YouTube on June 25, 2007 and received over a million views over the eight years before the meme became widespread.    In March 2014, footage from the interview was used by members of Muslim Brotherhood organization to parody the President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.  Other parodies were also produced, usually parodying technology and gaming.  The most viewed versions of the video subtitled Joya as the designer of the Nvidia GTX 970 graphic card, a designer of Team Fortress 2, a Valve employee discussing Dota 2, a Canon representative discussing the C300 camera, and a cinematographer describing shooting on a Red camera.    In March 2015, the meme received its most attention after the launch of the 2015 MacBook, where Joya was subtitled as a designer who worked on the prototype. Within a month of its uploading, the video received over five million views on YouTube.  The meme's impact has been compared to the one of the parodies of the Downfall movie.

aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,SalvadorGnali,-4,Thu Jun 11 16:19:00 2015 UTC,For food and better weather. He's the one I believe to be truly lost.
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,keoghberry,11,Thu Jun 11 16:27:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just as mad at Stannis, believe me, but you really can't compare those.   In the Storms End situation, Stannis and his team were the siege-ee's, not the siege-ers. You also really have to take winter into account, in harsher weathers the people inside Winterfell are going to survive much longer than Stannis' army will outside with no food in a blizzard.  Not agreeing with his decision in any way still, just saying those are very different scenarios."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,thesmonster,8,Thu Jun 11 18:55:06 2015 UTC,"Also, I'd point out that his army is comprised of mostly sell swords. Their loyalty likely stretches as long as the food and warmth does."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,thesmonster,2,Thu Jun 11 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"Considering the views on kin-slaying, I think what he did could be just as detrimental. Keep in mind most still believe that Brienne killed Renly."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,thesmonster,3,Thu Jun 11 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. No one would support him after they found out what he did to Shireen."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,hogwarts5972,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"What he did to Shireen is rather obvious for those in his army right now. Did you mean ""after they found out what he did to Renly""?"
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,AnAssGoblin,3,Fri Jun 12 01:42:42 2015 UTC,"No, that isn't what I meant. What happened to Renly was speculation based on a story from Brienne that no one believed. When anyone heard her story they would laugh because it was so far fetched. The burning of Shireen was witnessed by a great number of people (unlike what happened with Renly). Those people will tell that story. I doubt that anyone in Kings Landing would accept a leader that worships such a foreign God to begin with. Much less a God that would require him to burn his own daughter alive. He would be seen as a monster (and rightly so) by anyone that heard the story. The people in his army know what happened. Most of them looked disgusted and horrified. I imagine there will be deserters, and I imagine those people will spread the story. I don't think Stannis will ever be sitting the Iron Throne now. Sorry for the confusion. I should have expanded that/worded it differently.  Edit: reworded"
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,zimmertr,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, now I understand. I guess you're right. We'll see soon how's it going for Stannis"
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,klug3,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:21:41 2015 UTC,But if the burning of Shireen does work..... He is more powerful then ever to his men.
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,landViking,0,Fri Jun 12 05:36:15 2015 UTC,"Or, perhaps, the ""they"" that was being referred to is the rest of the men in the North and then the rest of Westeros."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,Slacker52,2,Fri Jun 12 03:01:02 2015 UTC,"While the scenarios are different it still speaks to the type of man he is, imo.  But also, funny meme.  Not a serious discussion starter.  If I were to post my thoughts about it, I wouldn't be starting off with that.  :)"
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,landViking,4,Thu Jun 11 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest, who the hell would WANT to go through such torture again?   I mean he ate the book glue and all of that stuff because he didn't have ANY other option or way out to overcome his problem. It was survival mode. Now he is given an option to avoid putting himself and his thousands of men through hell again, not knowing if they will survive or not ."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,landViking,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:10:44 2015 UTC,Is this a joke or did he really eat book glue? I don't remember that lol.
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,jtj-H,2,Fri Jun 12 05:30:42 2015 UTC,In the show he did before Davos smuggled in the onions. In the books they were eating shoe leather and rats.

aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,troglodytic,3,Fri Jun 12 13:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it isn't as though sacrificing her has made all of the Bolton army drop dead immediately.  They're still going to have to fight, men are still going to have to die.  Burning my only daughter and heir isn't worth it to me."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,Housson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:32:06 2015 UTC,Unless that sacrifice awakens an ice Dragon.
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,Housson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard this theory yet, what is it?"
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,MaximusKarma,2,Fri Jun 12 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"There's an ice dragon under winterfell that was awoken when Ramsey took the castle from Theon and burned (burnt? ) it.   There is a Bran chapter where he is warged into summer and sees the dragon emerging (I believe from the crypts? )  It's not a clear view, and the filter from a young boy looking through the eyes of a wolf bring it's validity into question.   I doubt it's real or else we would have a lot more references to it by this point. But it's an interesting passage. Go to /r/asoiaf and search for ice dragon for more."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,organic,0,Fri Jun 12 12:23:28 2015 UTC,"I thought what Bran had seen was just an image in the smoke?  It's definitely been awhile since I've seen the theory, though."

aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,A166524,2,Fri Jun 12 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"Some believe there is an ice dragon sleeping in or beneath the Wall, or at Winterfell, and that Mel will be able to wake it up magically."

aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,Foxyfox-,0,Fri Jun 12 07:05:10 2015 UTC,"Except that AA sacrificed his wife, who I personally believe was willing, and I don't think Stannis is AA. In the books he doesn't seem to truly believe he is, but he recognizes Mel's power.  In the show her leeches haven't managed to kill all three usurpers yet, and they seem to go back and forth on his religious beliefs."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,Foxyfox-,4,Fri Jun 12 12:08:18 2015 UTC,"I think you mean scumbag D&D, would bet money that stannis does not burn shireen in the books, it makes absolutely no sense (just like most of the shit D&D have made up).  She will be burned, but probably by Mel and Selyse behind the mannis' back."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,39g34g,20MinuteDrumSolo,2,Fri Jun 12 04:52:47 2015 UTC,"I actually tend to agree with you. Book Stannis is fighting for his rights and for the rights of his daughter and heir.  Show Stannis, as written, makes no sense to me. I don't believe he would have or did have cause to sacrifice his daughter."
