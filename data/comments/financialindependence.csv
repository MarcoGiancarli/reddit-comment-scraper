Most senior people at my company get 38 days off, which translates to 7 full weeks plus 3 days. On top of this there are several (10ish) national holidays, and essentially an unlimited number of sick days, and we are encouraged to convert some of the extra summer salary into even more holiday. I see colleagues routinely taking 8 weeks off in summer, then 2-3 weeks around Christmas (with all the national holiday around that time helping in the process). I assume that's very nice when you're at the stage of the life when you want to take it easy, but I must wonder if all that is a bit excessive.  Then again, some studies have shown that work efficiency does improve with more rest, and at least the quality of things produced here are world-class.

I think that it's bullshit.   let's say you work 9-5, tack on some commute (depending on where you live etc., that's anywhere from 20 minutes a day to over 2+ hours a day) that leaves you enough time to get home, spend what, 4-5 hours to yourself and then go to bed to do it again? i am very fortunate to live 3 blocks from my office (in NYC, where commutes are very typically 1+ hours for a lot of people) for me to just walk home, take my dog to the dog park for a bit and walk home it's already around 8pm at that point, cook dinner? what, eat at 9pm? play some video games or something until 11, wake up at 7:30 to get up and do it again? it's absolutely ridiculous to have to squeeze your life into 5 hours and then act like you're better than someone else ""living within your means""? what the fuck does that even mean in this context?)    go live and experience other places. i used to live in australia, and even tho they are similarly modeled toward the US in a lot of ways, it was still totally normal to not be at work for 8 hours and never have time to actually go to the beach and surf a bit.. and when you did, people didn't look down on you and act like you're not ""hard workin' 'stralian 'nuff"" if you did. people just realize that there is way more to life than just working for someone and making money until you're too old to do anything with it.   as an american, this is such a weird/stupid american mentality i'll never understand. people for some reason seem to think you're a better person if you work more than someone else...and crazier that people will gloat about it. watch any presidential campaign and all the shit that stirs up around it. as if the only options are either work 3 jobs for 70 hours a week to scrape by or go on welfare because those are the only options."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,fosiacat,19,Tue Jul 21 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"I lived in Switzerland for a year as an exchange student and an intern. I absolutely loved everything that the author talked about, but Switzerland is not the sunny reality that people seem to think it is.  Zurich is boring. Like beyond shopping, swimming in the lake, and going up to the Alps, there's not much to do. Other places have concerts, outdoor restaurants open late, world class museums/galleries, etc. But Zurich has nothing. At least you can take the train to places of interest (like Paris! in 3.5 hours!).  Swiss people are very standoffish. I don't say that as a bad thing in general, but only that it is very difficult to integrate as an expat. If you're the type of person who's okay with only hanging out with expats, that's fine. But I have not actually visited a Swiss person at their house in the entire year I was there, and I found making Swiss friends very difficult. (On the other hand, I had lots of foreign exchange student friends, and made friends with people at work who were not originally from Switzerland.)  Sure, you can be a resident, but you'll never be actually accepted. You can apply for citizenship, but it involves living there for 20 years and having your neighbor/community voting you in. Good luck with that, unless you speak Swiss German (if you're in Zurich).   Switzerland is expensive. Great, you're making $91k and paying 5% in taxes. You also have to pay $2k/month in rent. This is on par with New York, SF, and probably higher rent than Seattle. But it's not an interesting city (see above). It's just expensive. I was there in 2010. The cheapest food we could find was a kebab for $8. Burger King's cheapest burger was $11. Any visit to any restaurant was $40/person.  Sure, they have more vacation days, but they don't have that many bank holidays. Because I have good benefits in the US, I actually get more days off, total, than if I worked in Switzerland.  Lastly, I don't think these numbers apply to unskilled labor. A lot of the unskilled labor are from immigrants, some of them illegal. I seriously doubt they're paid well.  I really liked living in Switzerland, and I have so many memories from that year. But I have also thought a lot about if I want to move back (and I am able to do transfer with work), but my decision at the end has been to not move back. While their structure is nice, it's also stagnant, and it's not somewhere where I can be happy.  I do wish that working part time in the US was more acceptable and came with benefits though."

financialindependence,3e3cp6,supercharged0708,8,Tue Jul 21 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"This is cute but her analysis is flawed.  First of all a wealth tax is not a free lunch over an income tax. You actually end up paying more tax in your lifetime if you're a hard saver trying to accumulate wealth. FI is much more difficult if in addition to paying the inflation tax and mutual fund management fee, you also have to pay a wealth tax to the government. No thanks.  As for pay differentials, looking at broad averages is going to hide important details. America is much larger than Switzerland and contains more low-skill workers. So duh, wages will be lower.  As for flex time, that is a private contract between you and your employer. I personally have a flex contract with my employer where I can work as little as 20 hours a week at the same flat hourly wage. If you provide enough value to your employer, you can negotiate such a contract too because your employer knows he is better off with 20 hours from you than 0. If you're not providing much value to your employer and your employer has better outside options than you, well that's just the nature of the labor market."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,ckr801,19,Tue Jul 21 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your comments. However I can't figure out why the U.S. Favors capital gains rather than a full labor force. By taxing capital gains at a lower rate than wages we discourage workers and promote inheritance, trust funds, and an accumulation of capital by the 1%. The tax laws clearly do not favor the middle class."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,stoic_buffalo,5,Tue Jul 21 19:29:37 2015 UTC,"I would argue that the tax code in the US provides the middle class with many more options that it does in other countries. Just look at this sub for instance. How many times do we hear about how much harder it is to become FI in other countries due to the lack of Tax advantaged accounts. While I understand this is accumulation of capital, which you mentioned specifically, it is not just something for the 1%. Everyone can do it and many of the tax breaks for accumulation are phased out at higher incomes."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,Internally_Combusted,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:43 2015 UTC,"But I wouldn't consider FI people to be typical people.

If that's the case, I'd much choose Switzerland anyway."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,JillyPolla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"While the FI community is definitely niche I would say many of us are just middle class by income unless I am misunderstanding what you're saying here. I said that our tax code gives people options. If they choose not to capitalize on those options that not really the tax codes fault. The tax structure in countries like Switzerland do not allow for overly aggressive saving for an early retirement. There are benefits to their tax structure like free healthcare, better unemployment benefits, and other more generous social programs but that comes at the expense of having the ability to realistically stockpile enough money to retire around 40."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,Internally_Combusted,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"To be middle class you need to have a household (not individual!) income of around 50K. I seriously doubt that most people on FI sub make that little. You see posts here all the time talking about 6 figure salary. Do you think that two people can realistically reach FI making only 50K a year without other sources or windfalls?   Obviously, I'm not talking about 1% people. Those people always have options no matter what country you're in. While USA give more options to those that are in the upper side of the distribution (i.e. making between 80K-200K per person, the majority of aspiring FI) a much better chance at FI, the downside of the US is that those in the middle and at the lower level have much much less options.   Take for example blue collar working class people who work in factories. Those people are never going to be FIRE in both places, but their lives are certainly much better and less stressful in Switzerland than in the US. So no, I don't disagree with you that we aspiring FI would have a much easier time to do so in US, I just wish people acknowledge that there exist more people in this country who are arguably worse off due to our tax structures."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,JillyPolla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:39 2015 UTC,U.S. Favors capital gains rather than a full labor force.    Because: inflation.   You pay capital gains on your return even if there has been inflation. That means that the taxes are actually much higher than most people think they are because most people don't really understand the relationship between inflation and capital gains.   Lets say you make a capital gain of 8 usd on an investment of 100 usd. That is an 8% return which is what you can normally expect on the stock market. If I understand US taxes right the longterm capital gains rate is 23.8% at its highest. That means you will pay 8*0.238 in taxes on that 8 USD profit. That is around 1.9 usd in taxes. But if you had 4% in inflation that year your actual inflation adjusted profit is only 4 USD but you still have to pay 1.9 USD in taxes. That means your actual tax rate after the inflation adjustment is: 47.5% which is higher than the highest marginal tax for salaries.   So it's pretty much a myth that taxes are sooooo low for investments. It's just that you must take into account that there is normally inflation. It's even worse if you invest in bonds because with low yields your taxes might even end up to be larger than your inflation adjusted profit.
financialindependence,3e3cp6,Smartare,16,Tue Jul 21 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't need or want FI if there were better work-life balance and social safety nets here. It's all-or-nothing in America, so I'm choosing all then nothing. Balance would be better."

And I'm sure there are cultural/geo/socio differences between US/Switzerland but I don't think it's just because we're bigger.  That would mean more high skilled workers too and the average should still stay the same."
financialindependence,3e3cp6,spikeeee,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"The size is a huge factor. It has to do with how the population and work is spread throughout the vastness that is the United States. This creates a lot more diversity with both CoL and industry relevance. The cost of living in many parts of this country are fraction of the cost of living in Switzerland which drives down wages. If you look at average wages in similar CoL areas of the US I imagine they are pretty close to if not a little higher than that of Switzerland. Switzerland also has a heavily banking centric economy. The banking sector generally pays more than other sectors in any economy. So for a fair comparison of wages they should be compared cross industry in the two countries and adjusted for CoL.    I am actually not sure where she got her average wage numbers either. The OECD lists the US as leading in average gross income ($56,067) in 2012. Switzerland was 3rd with an average gross income of $53,716. The overall CoL index is showing that it is about 40% cheaper to live in the US than in Switzerland."

financialindependence,3e2j4p,zoodlenoodle,91,Tue Jul 21 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"My Grandparents inherited $2 million dollars, bought a crazy expensive ($million+) house and then trashed it. Wasted all of that money buying diet coke and creepy antiques, plus gambling. Reversed mortgage when they ran out of money.   They recently sold the house and got $200k. Didn't want to buy a $200k house, so they took out a mortgage for a new one. Grandpa's pension wouldn't cover the monthly payment, so they took out additional mortgage when they bought it and put $50k in savings for monthly payment. Recently spent $50k and now they have no money.  Now their health is failing and they have no money to cover LTC. They're also 67 and have bad health because they never took care of themselves.  I wish I was making this up."

As they say, money doesn't solve money problems.  Who I really feel bad for is my parents. I was never particularly close to my grandparents, but my mother is trying to figure out what to do as they age. They had four kids, but the other three are complete deadbeats/unemployed and won't lift a finger for their LTC. The disaster is still about five years away, but she has been trying to prepare now."

Inherited $2mil half a year after declaring bankruptcy (both retired at 58 with next to nothing.  Pension / SS will take care of everything!).  Bought a $750k house a month after the estate settled.  Bought 3 new luxury cars, installed a new pool in the back yard, $20k boat, about $30k in jewelry, 6 new gigantic flat screen TVs, pool table, clothes, and tons of diet coke.  Also spent $70k on a 1/4 acre barren lot as an ""investment"", which has $3k annual carrying costs (including $180 / month in HOA fees alone) and is now valued around $50k.  They were living in a $180k house, didn't bother to sell it for 3 years and let it go to shit, and just recently dumped it for $90k.  Buyer flipped it in 2 months after cleaning it up for the full $180k.  They left all the furniture, cookware, etc. to rot in the old house, because now they were rich and could buy everything new.  Everything was in good, usable condition.  They're a couple years from being bankrupt again and having to sell the new house at a loss (they're letting that one go to shit as well).  Both in mid 60s.  It's infuriating."

I'm just scared that I will fix it and they'll just go back to their old ways again. I'm approaching 50 and these properties were intended to be my parents and my retirement by my grandparents.

We're in a different state than them, so traveling there was non-trivial for her.    refinancing existing hard money loans in my name   Would you be taking on their debt in your name here? I'm not an expert, but it would probably be good to file bankruptcy for them instead of taking it on yourself.   I'm just scared that I will fix it and they'll just go back to their old ways again.   That's exactly what happened to my grandparents. My mother would bail them out and they'd find a new hole to bury themselves in five years later. It's so hard because you can't control their actions, but the consequences of those actions are for them to be homeless..."
financialindependence,3e2j4p,retro_paladin,12,Tue Jul 21 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"Agree 100x. Don't fix their problems by adding to yours. If you take on their debt, they'll likely just dig themselves in another hole. Tread very carefully."

At the rate they are going they will rip through the remainder of the estate within the next 10 years.  I'm trying to work out a scenario that will allow them to turn over a portion of the properties to me in exchange for assuming the debt on those properties which I can re-fi at hopefully lower rates.   I'm hoping I can at least salvage enough value out of them for my (meager) retirement plans but I will have to walk away if I cannot structure a sound deal.  Not a great situation but at least I've caught it before it became completely broken. Now it is a matter of getting them to stay on board.

I hope you were not counting on them.   That's a bad situation if you were expecting an inheritance to carry you through, but don't freak out, and with your own nest egg / retirement, don't take huge financial risks - like doubling down on risk in order to pull yourself out of the fire...   Help them if you like or can, but don't expect a dollar out of this. They'll be lucky if they're still floating. LTC will probably take everything - that and reverse mortgages are pretty much there to take everything elderly people have and leave them with nothing to pass along."

financialindependence,3e2j4p,celtic1888,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:47 2015 UTC,How does somebody with no means to pay get a mortgage for $50k?  Shame on the bank.
financialindependence,3e2j4p,Head,4,Tue Jul 21 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I worded that unclearly. They had $200k, wanted a $300k house, so took a mortgage for $150k, used $150k of their own cash, and put $50k in savings for the payment on the $150k mortgage.  It's still wtf on the bank's end. I honestly have no idea how they got the loan. They foreclosed on two houses about 30 years ago."
financialindependence,3e2j4p,retro_paladin,4,Tue Jul 21 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"It's still wtf on the bank's end   It makes perfect sense.  The bank is confident that if the owners stop paying the mortgage then they can just take back the house and quick sell the house for, say, at least 70% of the original price (so minimum $210k).  Since $210k is larger than than the $150k mortgage, the mortgage is pretty safe for them.  So if the owners pay absolutely nothing to the bank, the bank takes their house, quick sells it, and still makes plenty of profit  (I don't know the law regarding what the bank gets and what the home owners would get, but it seems safe  to say that the bank gets their money back plus profit)."
financialindependence,3e2j4p,joeflux,4,Tue Jul 21 19:24:27 2015 UTC,"Grandpa's pension wouldn't cover the monthly payment, so they took out additional mortgage when they bought it and put $50k in savings for monthly payment. Recently spent $50k now they have no money.   Do you literally mean they took out a mortgage and put the funds from that in an account to use to pay the mortgage bills?   That has to be one of the most insane things I've heard.   At that point you are kind of just betting on dying before the house of Cards crumbles.   Edit: nm saw response below."

financialindependence,3e2j4p,beer_madness,3,Tue Jul 21 19:01:24 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they?  The house doesn't just disappear if the owner dies.  If people (owner, spouse, children, whoever) stop paying the mortgage, the bank just takes back the house and sells it.  If the bank expects the house to be sold for more money than the outstanding mortgage value, then the bank would be absolutely fine."

They're unwilling to give up that house even though they've basically trashed it (grandmother had owned so emotional attachment).  At the beginning of the year, I paid taxes on the house since they can barely keep up the mortgage payments.  Before I did that, I told them that I'd rather give them money for their kids to have some dental work done (they have two kids in HS, also living with us) and they said they'd rather have the house.

Aside from a nice wardrobe (required for the job), she doesn't make any extravagant purchases.  modest house as well.  recently she mentioned that now that she has ""hundreds of thousands"" in savings that she is ready to start interviewing financial planners.  She grew up in a blue collar family that was solidly middle class, but not exactly well off.  in her mind, investing is only for ""rich"" people."

He owed less than $10k on it.  She convinced him to take out ALL the equity, and decided to live like kings for three years.  1) Build a home gym in the basement with top of the line equipment.  The basement flooded, so they ignored it for a month and all that stuff got ruined. The worst part is that they never used the gym, after it was completed, they signed up for the fanciest gym in the area and went there instead.  2) From the flooded basement, they got mold. Called the first guy they say on the phone book. Dude showed up, told them a scary story about home condemnation and dying from mold, and told them $36k to fix it.  She cut them a check on the spot without getting a second opinion.  3) After that, came the termites. They ignored that for about a year. Once the bedroom walled crumbled, it took $12k to get it fixed.  4) The rest of the money went to three vacations per year, renovating the rest of the house, the latest electronics and gadgets every three months, and brand new automobiles for both of them. And a $50k wedding for 120 people, of whom 110 they never saw again.  Once the equity dried up, she was a full time student and he lost his job, so it was then time to cash out the 401ks and any other source of money they had.  Once that went away, you'd figure they'd adjust their budgets and rebuild, but nope. More gadgets and vacations, on credit cards of course. Did I mention that my sister is a shopaholic? The ""retail therapy"" never ended with her and is still on-going.  After a while, they couldn't make their mortgage. So obviously, the bank foreclosed.

They never took care of business regarding the home (and, 5 years later, they still don't know what ended up happening in regards to the foreclosure or the bank, or their two mortgages on it).  At this point, I volunteered to help them sell all that stuff at that house. I went there one weekend, and took pictures of everything to list on ebay and craigslist, which I did. But they never bothered to ship anything that sold, nor meet up or communicate with potential buyers. I gave up on these efforts because I live 2 hours away, I did my part. Turns out they left all that stuff at the house (lots of brand new items, still in boxes, from ""retail therapy""). Well, nobody knows who or how it happened, but somebody went in and took everything. Probably the realtor. Maybe a neighbor. They don't know, they don't care. Thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff, abandoned and gone. And they just did not care in the least.  Once they walked away from the home, they moved into my parent's basement. A month later, my sister announced that she wants a second child, and my second niece came a year later.  They were supposed to live in my parents basement for less than a year, while they saved up and got back on their feet.  It's been about five years since that moment. They both just bought new cars, always with the latest phones and latest laptops. Kids at the top, most expensive schools. Still with ""retail therapy"" and three vacations per year.  My sister has a good job making north of $60k per year. Since she is in school, she takes more student loans than she needs, and stashes the extra money in a savings account, you know, because responsible people have ""savings"".  So that's the current situation. My parents had to delay their retirement, and obviously can't sell their giant home and downsize like they had planned.  Thanks for reading this long post and allowing me to vent. I love my sister, but she is a fucking egotistical, selfish, dumbass bitch.  But hey, at least my nieces are totally adorable!"

(I don't own a car lift) Parts for my cars are about 5-15% more than a basic cars part cost. I just replaced the transmission in my Boxster S. Parts ran around $2200 for a rebuilt unit which is pretty average for a transmission.  However, if he bought a Porsche for $10k, that would leave me to believe it was an older 98-2002 Standard model Boxster as those can be had for about $7-10k.

My dress was an $850 dress on the clearance rack for $300. dress shopping is the funnest part of getting married for a girl, so i recommend going to at least 5-10 stores. DON'T buy the first dress you get excited about. You can go back and get it later if it's still your favorite. Continue the fun shopping and see if you can find a better deal in the mean time. Eventually you'll find one less than $500.   We did really minimal flowers and were originally going to do them ourselves from costco. Get small bouquets, especially if the bride is wearing a fitted dress. You don't want the flowers overwhelming the bride.   Get only beer & wine if it's an option at your venue. Liquor just makes people stupid but a dry wedding is going too far. Beer and wine will save you lots of money (or at least some money) and people can still drink.   Find a venue with a low price per person. We were trying to stay well below $50 a person including alcohol. Watch out for service fee and tax which can add respectively 20% and 6% to your per person cost.   Keep your guests around 200 or less. We invited 200 and had 150 at the wedding. I think a max of 200 guests is reasonable. Think of looking back at your wedding in 20 years. Do you really think you'll still talk to a lot of these people? Forget circumstancial friends unless you are sure your friendship will continue.   I think those are most of the things we went for. Our wedding venue was beautiful but it was in a not-so-great part of town. I think it turned out okay though. we're not out to impress."

He didn't have comprehensive insurance and now needs a new car.  He called me up asking if I could co-sign on a loan.  I of course said no and directed him to /r/personalfinance and gave him advice on how to improve his credit.  A few days later, he calls me again and says he found a dealer willing to work with him, but he didn't have a downpayment, and wanted to know if I could loan him the money.  I explained to him that it's a terrible idea to loan money to family, and I wouldn't do that - but that I would gladly give him a few hundred dollars in this one case with no expectation of it being returned, since I knew he's in a real jam and needs a way to get to work (and hey, a few hundred bucks means a lot less to me now than it used to), but I gave him a little lecture on the importance of taking some responsibility for his choices, etc.    I asked him for account information so I could transfer it over, and he gave me some numbers.  I did an online ACH transfer...and it came back a day later!  Turns out he didn't know the difference between an account number and a debit card number...worse yet, it was his parents' account (who have their own horrible financial problems, but that's a story for a different day).

financialindependence,3e2z63,wvtarheel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:49 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to know the outcome of Vanguard's motion to dismiss. They're seeking to have the case thrown out because Danon, as an in-house lawyer for Vanguard at the time, breached the attorney-client privilege by disseminating confidential information. His response is that he's protected by statute as a whistleblower. If granted, this would end the case without any litigation of the merits of the real issue: the tax scheme.   I'd like to know more about that, but we're only going to get there if either Vanguard's motion is denied or the IRS takes up its own case.   What I know based on these scant allegations aren't very convincing. You have a snitch/whistleblowing (depending on your perspective) lawyer that has sued his former employer/client after being fired. The New York Attorney General declined to take up its own case based on the evidence that he gave them. Under these general circumstances, he simply doesn't look credible at this point. But that could all change if, like I said, the court denies Vanguard's motion or the IRS decides to bring its own case. If that happens, it could get interesting.

financialindependence,3e2z63,pentium4borg,3,Tue Jul 21 16:09:13 2015 UTC,"It would be extremely unlikely for Vanguard to fail. Vanguard is just a holder of publicly traded assets. The underlying assets are what matter. So focus on diversifying assets (domestic vs. foreign, stocks vs. bonds, etc.) than diversifying companies.  It's different from putting your money in a bank, where the bank holds its own set of private and unique assets. In that scenario you can benefit from diversification. But if every company is holding the same basket of publicly traded stocks then their fates are all tied to the same underlying asset and so diversifying companies makes no sense."

financialindependence,3e2z63,-KhmerBear-,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"Again, it's not a big concern, but I think the idea that you can't mitigate the risk is incorrect.

I like paying down the mortgage too, so I usually put half in a taxable account, half on the mortgage. That way I feel like I'm getting the best of both."
financialindependence,3e27d3,spinzard,3,Tue Jul 21 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"yeah, honestly, we have less than $40k left on the mortgage and for the first time, i am seriously considering doing this. It's just so tempting to kill it now that we're this low so that we don't have the payment every month anymore and we can put even more toward taxable investments."
financialindependence,3e27d3,retro_paladin,4,Tue Jul 21 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"I would be tempted to kill that debt too. That's really close to paying it off.   On the flip side, if you only have $40k left, that probably means most of your payment at this point is principal. Paying off the $40k may not actually save you that much interest."
financialindependence,3e27d3,spinzard,3,Tue Jul 21 14:27:07 2015 UTC,"well the interest is the same, 2.875% regardless of the balance, but yeah, by now, most of my payment is principal. I'm just barely a little worried about putting so much money into taxable accounts once it's paid off. Maybe it would be safer to spread that out a bit? you know, put some in now, some in later so in case the market is particularly high once i pay it off, at least i put some in before. Although, i'm a believer that it's time in the market vs. timing ..."
financialindependence,3e27d3,synackrst,4,Tue Jul 21 14:58:51 2015 UTC,"I think you've misunderstood.  Yes, the interest rate doesn't change depending on how much you've paid down, but on a modern self-amortizing mortgage, the early payments are mostly interest while the later payments are mostly principal.  So your payment might be, say, a fixed $800 a month the whole time.  When you first get the mortgage, you're paying $700 a month in interest and $100 in principal.  When you've almost paid off the mortgage, however, it's the opposite.  Here's a mortgage calculator that shows the amortization schedule for a fictitious mortgage.  You can see how the amount of principal in each payment increases over time while interest decreases: http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=150000&years=30&terms=360&interestRate=4.50&loanStartDate=21+Jul+2015&show=true&showRt=false&monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&yearlyPaymentMonth=+Jul+&oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Aug+2015&ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn"
financialindependence,3e27d3,Vinnie5,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:53 2015 UTC,"Does this mean that extra principle payments made early in the mortgage ""return"" more than extra principle payments made later on?"
financialindependence,3e27d3,synackrst,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  Yes, applying $10K in extra principal during the first year of a 30 year fixed mortgage shortens your mortgage and reduces the total interest you pay more than applying $10K in extra principal during, say, year 20.    But consider two other things:   Presumably, $10K will be worth less 20 years out, due to inflation There's the opportunity cost of the other things you could do with that $10K over a 20 year period"
financialindependence,3e27d3,spinzard,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"no, not sure why you thought i misunderstood. I understand. The ratio of princpal to interest just changes because your balance gets smaller and therefore the 2.875% interest on your balance also gets smaller and takes up a smaller portion of your payment. So right now, only about $125 of my payment goes to interest."
financialindependence,3e27d3,synackrst,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, duh.  You very clearly did understand and it's obvious from the comment I was responding to.

financialindependence,3e27d3,txholdup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:51 2015 UTC,"First, congrats!    Sadly, though, you can't contribute to a Roth for your newborn.  Taxpayers are limited in their Roth contributions by how much they earned in income that year.  I'm willing to bet that your son isn't earning income just yet, so no Roth contributions for him.  A 529 is a great idea.  You don't have to buy your state's 529 plan.  The main advantage is that your state's plan may let you avoid some of your state's income taxes.  But you don't have income taxes, so bonus for you!  Personally, I use the Utah 529 as it has very low cost Vanguard funds in it, though I don't live in Utah.  I believe what you're most looking for, though, is a Uniform Gift to Minors or Uniform Transfer to Minors account.  This lets you hold the securities in your son's name, but under your control until he reaches the age of majority.  Note, though, that the money is his at that point.  If he wants to blow it all on something you don't approve of, that's on him.  Also, it can significantly decrease the financial aid that he receives when college comes around.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Gifts_to_Minors_Act  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utma.asp"

Chipmunks killed most of my corn, rain killed some more of my corn, it's rained probably 80% of days in the past month, the laft the beggining of the month leaving me with a donut for the 4th weekend because goodyear didn't stock the tire then getting hit with a bill on a tire that should have been replaced for free under warranty (you know, they gotta find 30$ worth of bs fees), then the tree coming down, went out to cut the back yard Sunday and found quite a few paper wasps taking up residence in the door frame to the garage, chipmunks are now randomly digging up around the base of my tomato plants, few bad (mostly psychotic) first dates recently, mom's rather rapid bone deterioration and now she needs a hip replacement ASAP (she's gone from fully functional and mobile to heavy dependence on a cane and considerable pain in 3-4 months time which means when I'm home she has a list of things for me to do and has to call me to whatever room she's in umpteen times a night for help), we had her parents set to move into a retirement community as my grandpa has alzheimers and is getting bad... we have all their stuff packed up and my mom takes my grandma over to sign the lease... signs the lease agreement and on the way back to her trailer starts screaming at my mom and hitting her saying you can't make her move so we had to get them out of that lease and unpack everything... all of this shit in the past 4-6 weeks which all started up immediately after taking a week off to unwind from work.  If I could just get 3-4 days without something I'd snap out of it and be fine. It'll happen sooner or later, hopefully sooner because right now I feel like one of those people on Undercover Boss that I used to think ""no one has that much going wrong at once they just want someone watching on the other end of the camera to cough up some money""."

I work for one of the major freight carriers and at our office there's only 100ish of us... 6 managers, 6 team leads and then everyone else. We have other OpCo's around the city but most of that stuff is manual-labor part time type stuff with again a relatively small number of team leads and managers. Hell in my OpCo it's me -> team lead -> manager -> his boss -> her boss -> Vice President -> President.   If you want to move up you have to move to 'Mecca' (Memphis). I have zero desire to move to another state nor can I (family obligations, disabled mother that had to retire early, maternal grandparents in their mid to late 80's not doing well etc). Even then you can't move up much without at a minimum a 4 year degree and all of my sernior level contacts down there say you really need a Masters at a minimum.   And while my job is boring, I like it. I come in and listen to podcasts and audible books at 2x all day. I have pretty much as much OT as I could want the vast majority of the year, I have 25 vacation days a year after 9 years of being here, I have a pension, I have 401k match (although not great), really I'm sorta half-retired already. I come in and do my thing and no one bothers me. I don't have to talk to customers, I'm not on my feet, I'm not doing back breaking work (I've thrown trucks in retail and dug graves/kept grounds for a living in my past). I just wish I could go back in time when dad died just before I turned 13 and slap the shit out of myslef and I'd have a Masters now and be doing similarly easy office work making considerably more money and likely would have had minimal (if any) student loans for the Bachelors.  But at 30, working full time, helping a disabled parent and grandparents while also being active in my Lodge and trying to date... I have zero desire to add full-time school and massive debt on my plate so that maybe by 40 I can get a beter paying job and have years of loan payments head of me just to retire at about the same time as I will now assuming I stay single... but if I can find a partner that makes 1.4x as much as me and we only save 30% of our gross we could retire in 20 years. Even if someone made the same as me we could comfortably get out in 20 years which if I met them today would put me out in my early 50's, although I'd probably still keep working I'd just go work for a lot less at a non-profit or something that interests me."

financialindependence,3e281v,maaku7,6,Tue Jul 21 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"This sounds absolutely typical for an ESPP, by the way.  The taxable thing means that you will pay income tax on the $0.1765 of matching funds per $1 that are put into this by the company when they discount their stock. That is to say, if you put $100 into this, you will get $117.65 worth of stock, and pay income tax on $17.65. When you sell the stock you would just pay regular capital gains.  If I had this plan I would put the full 15% into it, and once a quarter (could be once a month but that's too much work for me) fill out a partial account-transfer form to move the shares to a brokerage account with lower fees (Vanguard has $7 fees, or you can use Interactive Brokers if you really want to minimize fees).  The justification of the program is to give you employees ownership in the company, sure. But let's be honest, it's really just a way to jump through some hoops to get a 2.65% raise :)"
financialindependence,3e281v,chrishas35,5,Tue Jul 21 13:22:56 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting ESPP...instead of a discount on shares, as is typical in my experience, it's a match.  Wonder why that decision, oh well.  /u/mac-0 has you covered on the tax side of things.  Spot on there.   Furthermore, if I do take advantage of this, should I sell at the end of every month as soon as I get the stock or hold onto them to minimize trading fees?  I've talked to my HR and my peers about this and they see this as a way to gain ownership of the company rather than making money towards FI. So please enlighten me better.   So, this is going to depend upon your overall asset allocation, but it's generally advisable to be very cautious in overexposing yourself to a single stock, especially if that's the company you work for. If things go bad, you'll take a hit to cash flow AND savings. Can be a bad spot to be in, ask the folks at Enron.  Personally, I divest my ESPP shares as soon as I can (it takes a little while after quarter close for them to be available) because I already have enough of my financial life tied up in the company (matching 401k contributions, stock options & grants, and of course, salary)."
financialindependence,3e281v,EventualCyborg,4,Tue Jul 21 13:13:01 2015 UTC,"That I'll be taxed on the discounted difference AND the proceeds from selling at the difference?   You'll be taxed on the match at your marginal rate.  Once you pay that, the match is treated like any other income and will not be taxed as capital gains.  You'll only pay capital gains taxes on any appreciation in value from discounts at the time of purchase or price increases.   Furthermore, if I do take advantage of this, should I sell at the end of every month as soon as I get the stock or hold onto them to minimize trading fees?   From the sounds of it, it's an instant ~13% profit less the $0.05 per share/$14.99 minimum sale fee.  So you'll want to sell at least $150 in shares at a time or the trade fee will make it unprofitable.  You'll have to balance how much exposure you want to price fluctuations in the share price of your company.   I've talked to my HR and my peers about this and they see this as a way to gain ownership of the company rather than making money towards FI. So please enlighten me better.

You certainly shouldn't have all your investments in one company, especially the one you work for, but there is nothing wrong with investing some money into your employer if you believe it's a good investment.  Yes, the spirit of the ESPP match offer is that the company gives you a financial incentive to build up some ownership of the company over time. Otherwise why would they even involve ETrade when they could just pay you an extra 2.55% salary (15%*17%)? So by immediately selling you are basically gaming the system to get a slight increase in salary. I'm not saying that this is wrong, by the way - but if you do sell, you may want to not advertise that fact to HR and colleagues."

financialindependence,3e281v,iguessimherenow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"As for as the taxable income part: The taxable amount now becomes part of your basis in the stock. So no, you are not double taxed on that amount. Simple example, you contribute $1, your company gives 17.65 cents, you company stock is at $1.1765 (how convenient). So you buy a share. You are initial taxed on the 17.65 cents just like in other wage. You turn around next month and sell the stock for $2. Your taxable gain is 0.8235 (excluding commissions of course).   As far as strategy goes: I have a 6 month ESPP at my work and we buy every 6 months, 15% discount on lower of beg or end price during the period. The general advice is that a quick sale is the most appropriate way to go. You guarantee a 15% return (sometimes much higher) and reduce your exposure to the company you make a living with. Your scenario is a bit different. I would say because it is monthly and you have a $15 transaction fee it may not be best to sell every month. I guess it would depend on the effective commission price percentage. If you make $100k and put the max $1,250 a month in you would be selling $1,471 worth of stock, making the commission only 1.02%. Which isn't terrible. Another option if possible would be to transfer those shares to a lower cost broker. For instance Scottrade is only $7. But then of course you risk the stock price changing over the time it takes to do that administratively."

financialindependence,3e281v,falco_iii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"ESPP is good in general, and this seems like a good ESPP program (aside from eTrade fees).  I generally recommend people maximimze the match and sell the ESPP stock.  You already have your employment income attached to the company, associating your investment assets is putting too many eggs in one basket.    As for taxes and fees, if you contribute $1000 in a month, then the company will match to make your contribution to be $1176.50.  You will be taxed on $176.50 - same as income tax (probably a different payroll line item such as taxable-benefit).  Your company will likely withhold that tax and report the taxable benefit and taxes withheld on the appropriate tax form.  You may not always be able to sell right away - check if there are any lock-up times or blackout dates (usually around end of quarter). When you want to sell, you will have to pay short or long-term capital gains (more/less than a year) on any capital gains above the $1176.50 cost basis.  Plus, you will have to pay the trade fee.    Buy and hold - highest risk. Buy, hold 1 year and sell - high risk, lower tax implications. Buy and sell every 2 - 3 months.  High taxes, reduces fees, some risk. Buy and sell every month - lowest risk, highest fees, high taxes.    If I were you, if you contribute more than $1000/month, then I would sell every month.  The trade fee less than 1.5%, which any stock can go up or down in a day, let alone a month or year."
financialindependence,3e281v,maaku7,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"So that's a good thing. The fact it's considered taxable income is, uhh, weird and abnormal.   Uh, it's totally normal. If someone purposefully sells you something at 82.35% face value, you technically have to pay income tax on the 17.65%. If I pay you $82.35 for a $100 bill, I am required to pay income tax on the $17.65.  I down-voted you because it is really bad advice to leave what is effectively a 2.5% raise on the table. As someone else noted, selling once a month as soon as the shares credit would only be a 1% fee, even without minimizing fees by transferring to another brokerage."
financialindependence,3e3pco,dutch86,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"This is important and you're not way overthinking this.  I suspect there are lots of ways to approach this, but at the core I think that most of them come down to this:   pick a target for the value: say it's a $20k car, a $20k wedding, or a $20k kitchen renovation.  This gives the added bonus of setting a ceiling for your expenditure. estimate the number of months between now and the expenditure. divide the cost by the number of months set aside that much money every month so that when it's time for the purchase you already have the money set aside.   In a nutshell, that's it.  In practice there are a few nuances, ie. where do you store the set-aside money?  How do you track it?  I've personally handled this by having a dedicated savings account for each major purchase.  I move money every month to that account.  I don't get very much return on that money in the savings account, but it also protects that money in the event that the market tanks right before I need to write the check for the contractor doing the renovation."
financialindependence,3e3pco,thismock,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's very similar to how the ""YNAB"" software works. You pick the value you're estimating, it'll budget that much per month, and you just assume the money is ""spent"". Writing the check for $20k in a few years shouldn't shock you, because you were planning on that money being gone for awhile.  Another thing to consider is the consistency. I've found a decent percentage of my budget (year after year) is random expenses. Kitchen renovation this year, new camera & car next year, special flight to Europe the next year, etc. However, looking at a few years of expenses, you'll see they average out to a certain dollar value. I can just assume I'll always have these random things pop up. So instead of my planned $40k (where my money fits the usual expected planning buckets), I might say I tend to spend $50k per year, so I'd budget for that instead."
financialindependence,3e3pco,StrongishOpinion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"Your second paragraph is more the type of thing I'm after. Looking at my own spending for the past couple of years, it does seem to even out. So that might be the optimal approach."
financialindependence,3e3pco,thismock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, I follow a process incredibly similar to that. And like I said, that's easy to do when you are earning a steady income. Maybe I should have rephrased my question and asked ""How much extra money each month are you planning for post retirement?"" in order to save for things like that."
financialindependence,3e3pco,supercharged0708,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I think I understand now.  Like StrongishOpinion, I've looked back on my expenses and now have a great idea of how much each month I spend on food, entertainment, travel, etc.  I'm setting these as budget expectations for post-retirement life.  In addition to this, I'm now starting to go through that list to produce a more accurate picture of what those expenses might be like.  For example, my travel costs will probably go down as I will have the time to fly at relatively cheap times.. like mid-day on a Tuesday.  However, my trip frequency will probably go up.  Given my expected travel expenses, I'll plan on setting aside $X a month for the ""travel bucket.""  This is how I plan to handle expected expenses.  As for those expenses which will be 'unexpected', I've been thinking that this will be what my emergency fund is for.  I'm budgeting in retirement to keep setting aside the dollars each month to maintain a healthy emergency fund.  When I'm working, that emergency fund is supposed to allow a reasonable standard of living while looking for my next job.  In early retirement, I think that emergency fund can serve a similar purpose.. allow a reasonable standard of living while enduring the unexpected cost.  If I consider my emergency fund to be satisfactory at $30k, I'll still keep contributing that monthly replenishment amount.  If the fund hits something like $40k and I'm thinking about a big upcoming cost (renovate the bathroom, let's say) then I know I can comfortably pull $10k from that account without affecting any of my normal monthly budget.. and it still leaves me in a good position if an emergency comes up at the same time (example:  ""we started working on your new bathroom and realized you have black mold in your walls..."")  Hopefully this is more along the lines of the input that you're looking for."

It's not that much work.  I rarely get bad tenants.  It's consistent and dependable.  You buy a nice house in a nice area and you'll get good tenants.    When the S&P tanked in 08 by 37% my rental income stayed exactly the same while still making better than 6% pre-tax.  are there normal issues?  Yup.  First roof lasts about 18 years.  Lucky if you get 15 years out of the AC.  Every 5th year or so you need to paint and various other small things.  After 20 years you might need to consider doing some upgrades on things that make the property more appealing.  End of the day you can get a lot of that money spent back out if you sold the place.  Otherwise it's just protecting a money making asset.  YMMV"
financialindependence,3e0tcf,cod3r__,6,Tue Jul 21 11:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not sure what analysis any of the other posters have done.  Clearly it depends on the area but real estate is ""real"". Yes it can be a pain in the ass (especially starting out). But the risks can be (mostly) mitigated by having strict rental requirements. Might take longer to fill the unit but better than having it condemned because they were cooking meth.  I was debating on buying a house in SF in 2011. The rent control laws are why I decided against it (it was the only way to make owning reasonable IMO). My buddy bought his house for ~500k (owes 400k). Comparables in the area are going for 800-1.2m now (~3 years later). Looking back, I should have bought, I'm just more risk averse."

financialindependence,3e0tcf,cod3r__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on the market, I was a landlord and I'll never do it in a less-than-ideal market. Problem is, those ideal markets are expensive to own. To give you an idea of what happens in a less-than-ideal market, every renter had bad credit, and all but one were good renters. The rest all ended up not paying, one of those I had to evict, but not before he poured motor oil on the carpet, graffiti'd everything, sold meth, and had a child, didn't tell me about being pregnant btw when they were prospecting the place, child subsequently died in the house. Seasoned renters know they can end up living there for months and not paying. If you're in a good area, you won't have to deal with this sort of stuff, but other people know that, it's expensive and you'll have to wait many years of housing / rent appreciation to see a return. If you bought at the bottom in 2008/2009 then you're probably fine, but that was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Oh and it has been over ten years and the property I foreclosed/short sold still hasn't gone up to where I bought the property. I would have been better off investing that money in index funds, or somehow figuring out the ideal housing markets, moving there and investing in real estate... aka risky and more effort than putting money in index funds. I invest in index funds  and I get stable-ish returns for less risk / effort."
financialindependence,3e0tcf,frugaler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:20 2015 UTC,Hence my point that you've gota buy a decent house in a decent place.  My properties are 200+ miles from where I live.  I wouldn't buy a place in the city I'm in.  Rental rates are going for about $1.13/sq foot.  Works out to roughly 4 - 5% after tax income.  Get a place where you can charge 1500-1700/month rent or more and you'll weed out a lot of riff raft.    My management company also does credit checks.  This is important.
financialindependence,3e0tcf,cod3r__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:51 2015 UTC,What would you assume the price of a unit to be where you can charge $1500-1700. I am just trying to gauge if there is a magical place where rents are this high but you can buy for relatively cheap.
financialindependence,3e0tcf,juliusseizure,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"In Texas 180k - 225k just depending on how new the house is.

Houston has better deals you can get a lot more house for that money, but expect the same rental.  realtor.com is a good place to look at rental rates and housing rates.  Get an idea for what people are asking for both.  A real estate agent can easily run comps for you as well.

Buy a 170-200k house and rent it out for 1500-1800.  Do credit checks and screen your tenants.  Use management companies.

It doesn't make sense to do it with just a downpayment either as you suggested earlier.  You need to go at this with money and intention to pay off the house quickly.  Having a huge mortgage on a rental property is also destined for bad times.  Things do happen, but that's true for even the house you live in.  It's the same things.  Tenants are easy to screen though.  Credit checks alone typically tell the whole truth about a person.  Get rental history and job information and it's pretty easy to spot good vs bad."

I'd go into any place and get a new roof, new AC, new water heater right out of the gates if it's within the range of time that the things needed replacing.  Other than those things heed the inspection report.  If things are amiss, fix them right away or if it's bad enough walk.  You also don't have to buy in your area.

Owning real estate is really about using local knowledge to beat the market. It's really one place where anyone who pays attention can figure out pretty well which properties are likely to increase in value dramatically, and which are likely to be stagnant. Real estate is fairly illiquid so you can use this knowledge to buy undervalued properties as they become available, as many people do. A REIT, on the other hand, invests in the bad as well as the good.  That said, real estate is too much work for me.

He was constantly working on or paying others to work on property and usually grumbling about non-payment.  If the property value drops, which often happens in areas with rental housing, your investment loses value as well.  Even flipping houses seems like a better investment than long-term rental property and I'm not recommending that either.  Business property might be a better, but more expensive investment, but I'm not familiar enough to say. I do see a lot of empty retail/office space though."

financialindependence,3e0tcf,brooklyngeek,7,Tue Jul 21 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  I am basically FI and have been looking for a while (a year or two) at real-estate as I planned my exit from my day job.   I'm not averse to sweat equity, I have time and an inclination for that.  I consider that a kind of investment in myself.  HOWEVER I haven't found anything in my area that makes sense financially.   Interest rates have been low which has driven up purchase prices but not rent.   Rent vs. Buy is a bit upside-down where I live.  Buying outside my area would involve a manager that reduces the profit.  I would highly recommend Googling and downloading a couple of excel templates for calculating cash-flow and ROI for rental properties (and make sure it, or you, account for tax).   Go on some real-estate websites and punch the numbers into the spreadsheet, see if they make sense. Your area may be very different than mine.  Also, I would add that in his most recent article, MMM considers his decision to become a landlord to be a mistake.  In his particular case it was actually a fairly costly one when compared to completely passive investing."
financialindependence,3e0tcf,PretyFIforawhiteguy,3,Tue Jul 21 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"Tenant and legal risk cannot be overemphasized.  If you own shares in a REIT, you have someone to manage that sort of thing for you and you'll never even know you had a bad tenant.  If a major portion of your net worth is a rental home, then you can take a massive hit from one bad tenant.  What's more, once you're finally FI, do you really want to be stuck litigating landlord-tenant disputes?  And for what?  Average-ish returns?  REIT's all the way for me.  It's entirely possible I've had bad tenants, but I'll never know or have to worry about it."

As a cash investment, real estate is more risky than the market without phenomenal returns. But leveraged, real estate pulls ahead, as leveraged real estate is much MUCH safer than leveraged brokerage accounts.  Note I don't own rental property, nor do I really claim to know all that much about it. But this makes sense to me, please do correct me if I'm wrong."

The income is funding PITI, Property management fees, maintenance, vacancies.  It does get me a bit of a benefit on my taxes each year, even if it's cash flow neutral.

I wouldn't do any of the work myself, but it's amazing how much you can save if you want to.  I build homes with my father's business for about 10 years (did the labor jobs in college, holy hard work). We could get a house built for about 60% of retail if it was for our own use (about once every 4-5 years). Normal margin was 20-30%. Most builders in the area cleared about 10%. My father is so fucking anal retentive though, if there's a fucking 2x4 that wasn't picked up, he'd call and say pick this up or give me the fucking credit, I'm not paying for it.  One of my framers said there was another developer that actually had building down to the number of nails from AutoCad (Revit, whatever). So if they ran out of materials, he said I delivered enough. Lol, wtf. Way to get them to cut corners idiot!  I can't wait to build my next house. The only hard part is getting the damn floorplan under 4k sq ft. My goal is 2600 max. Hard to do that with all the rooms I want and a 1920s bungalow style 2 story.  Kudos on your success!"
financialindependence,3e0tcf,fu2mod,9,Tue Jul 21 14:04:13 2015 UTC,"I believe investment real estate can be a very beneficial part of ones retirement plan.  It seems the main complaints are that real estate is risky, doesn't have great returns, and is a lot of work. While it can be all of these things, it doesn't have to be.  Like any other form of investing, it pays to do your homework.  I personally own two rental houses and will slowly expand.  I view real estate as a way to diversify my retirement holding to reduce my risk.  I don't want to have all of my investments in real estate nor the stock market but a healthy mix.    As others have mentioned, real estate is one of the few investments where you can use leverage.  If I have $20K to invest I can put that in the stock market and get a 7% return ($1400 the first year).  If I use that same $20K as a down payment on a $100K rental house and that property appreciates at a very modest 2% (below the historical average of 3.5%) your first year appreciation would be $2000.  If you don't want to ""bet"" on appreciation then you can look at just the cash flow.  A very reasonable target to get is $100 cash flow per door (rent - mortage - taxes - insurance - repairs - vacancy = cash flow).  That $1200 in annual cash flow equates to a 6% return on your $20K investment.  That is also not including the amount that you are paying down your mortgage.  Then there are the tax advantages of owning investment real estate.  You get to write off a lot of your expenses as well as depreciating the property.  If you do it correctly (and legally) you can show very little profit on your taxes while you are showing a profit in your bank account.  You can also hold real estate in a IRA but that is another topic.  Where real estate becomes a lot of work is when landlords do not do the needed work upfront.  Find a quality property not just a cheap property.  Properly screen and select good tenants, not just the first to show up with a check.  If you do all of that owning rentals do not have to be a lot of work and can be very profitable.   If you are interested in learn more I would highly suggest going to BiggerPockets as it is the best place for free information about investing in real estate."

I see it as only part of my portfolio.  I hope to start investing in it while I max out my tax advantaged accounts and continue to work my job.  I do not plan on growing my RE portfolio to huge multi-million dollar condominiums, I just want a few properties to help supplement.  I have recently started becoming very active at BP and I am going to make the leap very soon.    I am glad to see a fellow FIer who does it.  Thanks"
financialindependence,3e0tcf,BrewsWithHoppiness,3,Tue Jul 21 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"Yes,  I view my rentals very much in the long term, just like a buy and hold index fund investor.

financialindependence,3e0tcf,Muffin_Cup,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"This is what I want to hear. I am young and interested, but hear people complaining about common slumlord practice and how landlording is not worth it. The most successful landlords in my area seem to select decent quality midsize homes (2-3 bedrooms) and carefully pick young professionals for their renters (people who are still in the renting market but can always afford their payments). To keep the good renters, the landlord has to be responsive and respectable rather than a slumlord. It goes both ways.   Thank you for your informed input."
financialindependence,3e0tcf,BrewsWithHoppiness,3,Tue Jul 21 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, my philosophy is to try to find a modest house in a good area.  I ask my self, if I knew someone who just got an entry level professional job, where would I suggest they live in my city.  I also try to treat my tenants great.  I go through a lot of effort to find a high quality tenant, so once I have them in place, I want them to stay as long as possible.  Also, since I have a full time job I am not in the fix and flip category.  I look for a house that has been maintained or already fixed up.  While I pay a little more upfront, I save in both time and repair costs down the line.  They also tend to attract a higher quality tenant."

financialindependence,3e0tcf,vhalros,6,Tue Jul 21 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"It is a possible path. The major disadvantages I see are: a single house is already considerable exposure to real-estate, its maintenance work which is annoying if you don't like it, and a pain-in the butt tenet can be a real pain in the butt, and the returns are not great. All of these vary somewhat with local conditions.  I think even MMM was just doing it because it was not a favorable market to sell."
financialindependence,3e0tcf,fu2mod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:11 2015 UTC,"Single house is very risky, 4 should be the minimum IMO (at 25% value per unit). However, you have to start somewhere!

financialindependence,3e0tcf,vhalros,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but then you have a whole bunch of money tied up in things who's value is highly correlated (real-estate in one market), and probably get worse returns than the stock market. It also depends a lot on local conditions; here even a 1 bedroom condo is going to cost 300k, so having a rental property means you are committing a lot of money to real estate."

financialindependence,3e0tcf,JacobAldridge,7,Tue Jul 21 05:12:09 2015 UTC,"Properties are a big part of our portfolio, but I have worked in and around the real estate industry for 15+ years (knowledge which reduces my risk). I'm in it for the leverage, a factor often overlooked when comparing Property v Stocks, and I buy to invest - in fact, we will probably find ourselves renting where we live in the near future, where a lot of people are pulled into emotional home purchases. Plus, fast forwarding a while, if I can end up being 40 years retired without monthly mortgage or rent payments that will make a huge difference to our COL.  Go Curry Cracker just published an excellent article on the costs of property ownership - how they made $102K and are poorer for it http://www.gocurrycracker.com/how-i-made-102k-in-real-estate/  So many additional items many gung-ho property investors overlook. Some even surprised me, due to differences in process and law between the USA and Australia (where my properties are - for instance, my purchase fees would have been twice as much, but selling it myself would have cost about 5% of what it cost to do it in Seattle).   The 'standard' path to FI is, as /u/allyallniggaisgay observes, lazy and risk averse - that's why it's so beautiful. My risk profile is much higher, so that may be part of why property interests me so much."
financialindependence,3e0tcf,ethidda,3,Tue Jul 21 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"I also live in Seattle, but I picked a house where mortgage was less than rent, at 3.5% down. It's since appreciated a lot. We like DIY projects. So yes, we've spent money on it, but it's just another hobby. And our house is pretty close to work (certainly closer than where I was renting).  I think homeownership is a lifestyle. If you don't like it, don't buy it."

I do recognize however the potential of leverage, tax advantages and control in investment properties and the potential for appreciation and sense of well-being in owning my primary residence.  Would you say that most of the pit-falls of investment properties are due to landlords not doing due diligence and/or emotional investment? My interest in them comes from a desire for higher returns and more control compared to the typical stock, bonds and REIT ETFs. My interest in (outright) owning my primary residence is avoiding running costs of renting (as government can tax my income but not my reduced expenses) and thus isolating myself from (that part of the) cost of living. My aversion in both cases comes from not wanting to be bothered by constant repairs and avoiding concentration of my wealth in a few assets."
financialindependence,3e0tcf,mattisonholdatwork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:56 2015 UTC,I think many downfalls of property investment are that people don't buy with cash. They take out second mortgages and get something without really searching and saving. Having cash means you are serious and you will often buy a lot smarter than if you took out a loan.

I'm very interested to see which of us gets to the finish line first.  Another interesting bit is that while each of us is convinced that our way is the ""right"" way, the numbers we've worked out independently as to what we need to hit FI going these different routes are remarkably similar."

We went on vacation for a month and got the emails about broken things. Then the first week we came back, there was another one. They aren't even big or expensive issues, but you have to keep an eye on it. And a property manager would not do as good a job as we would, or would hire it all out for a lot of money.  You are investing on a margin. That's what the mortgage is. So if it goes well, you can make a lot of money. If it doesn't, you're kind of screwed.  It takes research and work. You have to figure out where to find the loan. You have to comb the listings for properties. Then look for comparable. Run numbers to see if the property has good returns. Probably fix a few things when you get the property. Then you have to be there to show the property, etc.  I could hire a property manager, but then I'd be cash flow neutral, so we do the work ourselves.  On the plus side, owning property in Seattle is very advantageous right now. Our rental income pays for our housing, so we can save faster. The income is very advantageous tax wise. And we bought the houses to live in and then moved for other reasons, and simply got lucky with the market. But it's worked out very, very well for us.  I don't plan to buy another property, unless we have kids and need a bigger house."

I mean, this tells you nothing about REIT expenses compared to owning real estate directly.   REITs distribute a lot of their returns through dividends and these dividends are taxed as ordinary income instead of being taxed at qualified dividends rates.   The way that REITs do it is actually more efficient, but I think we just have different views of what it means to be tax efficient."
financialindependence,3e0tcf,pyroxyze,2,Tue Jul 21 05:58:30 2015 UTC,"Regarding 1st point, always good to do a comparison, but REITs, which are mostly commercial real estate, are very different in costs than residential real estate. There are some mortgage REITs, but they are still very different from buying a house and renting it out. Not sure how useful a comparison of costs would actually be.  Regarding 2nd point, I agree with you and I stated it above. People complain about tax inefficiency of REITs, but REITs really just pass on the tax costs to the investor instead of the company itself paying taxes."

financialindependence,3e0tcf,jeremiahs_bullfrog,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:28 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on doing this in the accrual phase since I think I can make >10% return if I can find a good deal on a rental following the 1% rule. I haven't calculated all of the costs involved, so I plan on watching our expenses for the next couple years in our own house to estimate what a rental might cost.  From my initial estimates, I can make quite a good return on investment (up to 20% first year, which reduces to 8.5% once I own the house). As long as I can keep it rented, it should cash flow pretty well and do at least as well as the market. The return should be mostly constant, which is really nice when the market takes a dip.  From my initial estimates, I'll make a greater return on my money as long as it's leveraged: the more equity I get, the lower my return. In the accrual phase, I plan on buying several houses on leverage and then decide whether to keep them once I'm FI. I might keep the best 2-3 once FI and put the rest of my capital in index funds (I don't think I want any more than 40% of my portfolio in real estate).  I think my main draw here is that I work a 9-5 office job and fixing up a rental occasionally is a nice break to that."

Out of all the problems we have to deal with on a monthly basis that involve residents, tenants account for the overwhelming majority of them, and represent the most ludicrous and stupid issues.  We had a guy try and replace a washer on a hot water tap.  Without turning off the water first.  Flooded a dozen units.  We had a woman drag a bag of greasy garbage from her suite on one side of the building, almost 300ft to the garbage room, leaving a trail directly to her door.  Oh.  And we'd just finished a half-million dollar renovation, and the carpets were brand new.  We had a woman DRILL THROUGH A WALL to install a $2.49 plastic doorbell into the hallway.  We don't allow doorbells in hallways.  Again, we'd just finished a half-million dollar hallway refresh.  The same woman was installing a doorbell because she INSTALLED A SECOND ""FRONT"" DOOR IN HER HALLWAY, so she could rent out one of the bedrooms.  Oh, and she never told the owner that she was conducting major renovations.  Guess who got the bill for removing that?  We just had a tenant get busted for dealing drugs out of the suite he was renting.  A lineup of cops came into our building at 5am on a Sunday morning, knocked on the guy's door, and carried out no less than 5 huge black garbage bags of 'evidence'.  There's a reason a lot of tenants are renting.  It's because they're fucking idiots who shouldn't be trusted with a butter knife."

Sure, if you have only 1-2 properties you might get lucky with great tenants who stay for 20 years, but you can't count on that when you buy. There are companies that manage properties for you, but they will always put their profit before yours. If you have enough properties you can hire salaried employees to manage and repair them, but otherwise you just have to put time and effort into it yourself.  Add dealing with real estate agents and tenants into the mix and it's just not worth it to me.  If you want exposure to real estate you can certainly get it without being a landlord."

If you are getting small returns like ~100 / month with a mortgage, don't bother. You need to go out and find good deals. Essentially if you are paying 'retail' for a house to rent, your returns are low its not worth while. you get good tenants. This one you have less control over. I have had to evict one tenant, the process took about 6 months and was done in the courts easily with a lawyer. Sheriff evicted them and I lost out on a few months rent (probably 4 months total). Overall it wasn't that bad. your idea of landlording is dividends from rent. No one can predict what the housing market will be down the time. Your focus should not be on the houses value after you buy it. You'll get rental income if the price of the house goes up or down. The value matters only when you are selling it."

I know plenty of people who think buying stocks is risky and complicated, likening it to a casino; meanwhile, to them, buying a place and renting it out is simple and foolproof. Plus, lots of ""friendly"" people (real-estate agents, mortgage brokers, etc.) are willing to help them. Don't forget the social aspects of owning property: you can show off a building you own but not a digital stock portfolio. Even the word landlord suggests social bias; are you a rentpeasant?

Everyone gets a fixed amount, which you can survive off of.  So that way people who don't save can still survive, but since you also get that money it doesn't feel that you're bailing out other people.  (It's also not the same because they would be paying higher taxes while working, thus effectively being forced to save)."

financialindependence,3dyfhm,william_13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:24 2015 UTC,"I think there's definitely some things that are easier and harder - I'm 22 which probably makes me one of the younger folks around here. My parents' first house when they were my age was only a few times my dad's yearly salary so a mortgage was manageable. A similar house now is roughly 13 times my salary and would be something like 75% of my take-home pay to mortgage. So in that sense, I have it much worse of than my parents' generation.   With that said, the fact is you can still survive and save for FI despite it. My rent (and all living utilities) right now is about 40% which is admittedly high but better than a lot of people in my area. I'm moving this fall for an additional decrease which'll give me another 10% or so to save. In real numbers, that's about $1k a month total saving ability. In really simplistic numbers, that's still FIRE in 18 years - age 40 - assuming I never get a raise from my first career job's salary.  So, I don't think we're in bad shape in the ""it's completely impossible"" sense, I just think you have to be smarter and play by different guiding rules than the older generations."
financialindependence,3dyfhm,Epledryyk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"You can definitely save for FI, imo the main problem with our generation is that it is much harder to own a home or even make a more long-term investment/commitment because the job market is very unstable. Very few employers are going to keep you in the long term, you have to be on the lookout for new and better opportunities, which usually involves relocating and taking risks that our parents (generally) did not had to take.   All this uncertainty actually makes people hang on to crappy underpaid jobs (like I did), because it's better to earn something than live of your parents... or just avoid taking long-term commitments - from getting a degree to owning a home and establishing a family.  I do agree that its not impossible, but our generation is postponing their adulthood far longer than our parents did, we are somewhat forced to live a life of frugality and it is fairly rare to see anyone under 30's planning to have kids, let alone do all the adult stuff that our parents did in their early to mid 20's... The rules definitely have changed."
financialindependence,3dyfhm,william_13,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:13:46 2015 UTC,You really consider yourself one of the ultra-rich who need to be taxed higher? You're delusional.
financialindependence,3dyfhm,Dontblameme1,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:08 2015 UTC,Capital gains/dividens should be taxed higher though. I don't care how much money I ever have; I will always think that. Edit: Unless of course the tax rate is raised to an appropriate level.   The cap for SS tax should be significantly raised or removed too.
financialindependence,3dyfhm,Dontblameme1,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think the cap on SS benefits should be raised along with the cap on the taxes, so that people paying the additional taxes are entitled to additional benefits (it could still be progressive as it is now)? Or are you suggesting the additional SS tax should simply be an additional tax with no additional benefits?  Regarding capital gains and dividend taxes, I can see good arguments for anything from taxing them just like ordinary income to not taxing them at all. To me, the most important thing is to set a philosophy for how they should be taxed and stick with it so people can plan effectively."
financialindependence,3dyfhm,iaddandsubtract,4,Tue Jul 21 12:51:32 2015 UTC,"All I know is the easiest way to make SS ""whole"" for the foreseeable future is to raise the cap. I think it should be raised but I honestly have not thought about the details much.   I think capital gains should be taxed lower to a point. Yes, there is risk involved in investing in the market so a lower tax rate should encourage joe-shmo to do so. However, if you're making millions from capital gains then that's basically your fucking ""job"" and it should be taxed like regular income at that point."
financialindependence,3dyfhm,Dontblameme1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:52 2015 UTC,"SS has always been billed as a ""pension"" type of thing. You get out in relation to what you pay in. There has always been a wealth redistribution aspect to it, but most people don't know that or don't think about it, they think it's a pension. If you tax the higher income people more but don't increase their benefits in exchange, you are going to start undermining support for the program I think because it will become apparent to people with higher incomes that it's not a pension, it's just another tax.  If you're going to just make it another tax, why focus on those people with earned income, you're going to be getting most of the money from a certain group of people that are NOT the rich, upper middle class to lower upper class maybe, but not rich. Why not just slap a 5% additional tax on capital gains over $100K and toss that into SS to bolster it? Or any of a number of other tax schemes?"
financialindependence,3dyfhm,iaddandsubtract,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm only 28, but I find it hard to believe SS is as much of a ""pension"" as you make it out to be and that people get out what they put in. Why are people my age pretty much screwed out of receiving SS if that's the case? Doesn't make any sense.   I am much more for drastically raising capital gains tax after a certain amount (maybe 100,000/yr). Of course it would go up gradually in brackets, but you know what I mean.  Or...maybe we should stop spending so much money on the military. But i'm going to stop there with my whacky ideas before I get a lynch mob."
financialindependence,3dyfhm,Dontblameme1,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:25 2015 UTC,"Why are people my age pretty much screwed out of receiving SS if that's the case?   You're not. There is a formula for the benefits you are entitled to depending on how many years you pay into the system and how much you pay in as well as the age you start receiving benefits. Those rules can change of course, but as of right now you are not being screwed.  Lower income people can expect a return of about 4-5% over their lifetime from SS. High income people can expect a return of about 2%. It's certainly not an awesome investment, but it is very much like a pension in the way it pays out in relation to what you put in.  At some point in the future, maybe 15-20 years down the road, SS will have exhausted its savings if nothing changes. At that point they expect SS will still have income equal to 75% of benefits, so it will still be able to pay 75% of the benefits you are owed even if no changes are made to stabilize the program.  Hopefully at some point before the fund burns through its savings, the government will raise revenue, cut benefits, or both to make the program sustainable farther into the future. The probability of you getting some benefit from SS is pretty high. It is an oversimplification to say you are ""screwed out of receiving SS"", and probably just plain wrong."

This is how the masses voted for the law ,and it became constitutionally legal. Although it was intended to punish the rich, in reality it wound up punishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class.

They choose to live luxuriously, live beyond their means, show off, and ""live well in their youth"" rather than have the willpower to prepare for their future. I do agree that it should be easier for them. They (and we) should be better paid for our time and receive more utility from the taxes we pay.

People fail to realize that wealth is more of a behavioral trait than anything, and I can bet than any truly wealthy person driving a Porsche with their big fancy TV either have it: because it costs so little in relation to their wealth, the cost equates to flicking pennies in the trash.... or they got it for free as a benefit of their wealth.... or they got it for free and are getting paid to use it in front of others as a form of advertising.  My father (who never made much money and is FI) got to know numerous CEO's and other very wealthy people during his career.

financialindependence,3dyfhm,threedancingmatthews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"To sign up for a reverse mortgage, you need a certain % of equity (<100%, but I don't remember exactly how much), and you need to be 62 or older.  The bank will offer you options (ie, $500/mo, $1000/mo, lump sum of $20,000).  If you want to sell your house (or, more likely, you die and your heirs inherit), you/the heirs owe whatever you were given (ie, 54 months X $1000, possibly with interest?).  If you were given more than the value of your house, the bank gets your house (only after you die) and the government writes the bank a check for the difference.  The ""catch"", I guess, is that your heirs do not inherit the property free and clear.  This happened to my uncle.  His mother had a reverse mortgage and he owed $50,000 to the bank when she died.  He paid the bank from the proceeds of the house sale."

Now, people are given more personal responsibility and someone somewhere forgot that giving personal responsibility to people means that some will do very well and some will fail spectacularly. We never should have given personal responsibility over retirement to people- it was just setting people up to fail.  This is not even mentioning the fact that despite people like us being able to save for early retirement, the middle class has been getting absolutely gutted since the 70s or so.

financialindependence,3dyfhm,johnfarrellfitness,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:30 2015 UTC,Not only that but if you are to buy a car based off earned income the money going towards that car has to go through income tax which is generally a high taxation rate.  If you instead put that money into stocks etc the money you make on capital gains is taxed at a far lower rate so in the long run you end up paying less of your money that you acquire to the government.

They arent for our entertainment or to fulfill us or be there to take care of us when we are old, etc. They are a responsibility.  And people dont have them responsibly. More often than not, parents dont have enough resources in both finance and time to allocate to them. They become neglected and fat from eating fast food (cant afford anything else).

It's going to be a real problem.  I am not just being paranoid, it's something I have researched in depth and a very real and substantiated problem.

As can being in a relationship with someone who doesn't share similar financial goals. When viewed purely from this financial perspective these can be absolutely horrible decisions. And financial distress can indeed cause problems in these very relationships.  But life is more than just finances and retirement. Having children isn't buying a car. It's not purely a financial endeavor. Finances should certainly be a consideration, but very well may not be the primary one for most people.  This isn't to say that people should not take financial concerns into account when making these decisions. But it's not so much 'you can/can't afford children' as it is figuring out your priorities. If you make $50,000 per year and you have 5 kids, you probably aren't going to have an early retirement in your future. And that's OK. If you want to retire early and have 0-1 children in order to make sure that can happen then that's OK too."

financialindependence,3dyfhm,corncrazy,0,Mon Jul 20 20:31:51 2015 UTC,Social security sounds great in practice but its all too corrupt and doesn't work when they take out more then they put in. I would rather see mandatory individual savings so no one can take my money. Then you only get what you earn. They could have something else to fund the disabled. I've seen to many people abusing the system. I think people who need help should get it. But people who are just looking for a free ride should just bug off.

Unsurprisingly, this does not lead to a low FI number.   Depends on how you look at it.

The income should be enough to be able to live in a medium to large city.

But the loan is not highly sophisticated or unique. It's a $175 million term loan and a $75 million revolving line of credit. They both have 5 year terms and the term loan amortizes at 5% a year. Your bank earns LIBOR+250 on the loan and you got 100bps upfront fee for being the lead arranger. You close and book the loan. Quarterly you update the deal site and publish the new financials and make sure the company hasn't breached any of the covenants.   Over and over again. No real innovation. No real differentiation. Does the company cash flow? Do you trust the leadership? Are there some good barriers to entry? Here have a pile of cash.

Not really, if you think that that employees should be able to hire and fire their employees as they see fit...    That said, at a high level sometimes there is a critical supplier that chooses to continue to supply because they are also holding out hope that their big customer will pull through.  Sometimes, their customer recovers, and sometimes their customer goes out of business and they don't get repaid, or get repaid pennies on the dollar during liquidation and litigation.

I don't have time to explain this giant misconception on reddit but simply but imagine a person has $100 and wants to start two startups. He'll organize them as llc's to set them up and limit liability (its in the name ffs). Investors and creditors allocate capital to the company with the understanding (and 100 contracts) indicating that they are each their own entity and demand a corresponding return for the risk. These funds/earnings don't commingle with each other or personal funds. This is finance 101 guys, I dont expect politics to get this but here we are better than that.  Mutual funds and hedge funds do the same thing. Imagine you gathered up $100 from friends and family to start 'Rowsforthebros Real Estate Fund A' with a contract that you would invest in commercial real estate and provide a return. If the investment failed, they cannot come after your other funds. Unless you take personal liability or put up collateral. Then you can get a lower borrowing rate, but also could lose the money.  I don't study law, but generally the only way the investors can 'pierce the veil' and go after personal funds is if the entrepeneur commits gross negligence or fraud.

financialindependence,3dyrgi,CJ-Johnson,5,Mon Jul 20 17:11:25 2015 UTC,75% in NYC? Very impressive! Do you live with a bunch of people?
financialindependence,3dyrgi,Internally_Combusted,9,Mon Jul 20 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"One roommate. I'm a web developer / independent consultant. I make money project by project, so income fluctuates quite a bit, but last year I earned about $140k. Right now (before taxes), I make about $14k per month due to various projects - and I'm living on about $3k of that. I pay taxes quarterly though, so I'm not including those costs."
financialindependence,3dyrgi,Internally_Combusted,4,Mon Jul 20 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"Have you set yourself up as a business and created a 401(k), Simple 401(k), or SEP IRA?  As an independent contractor you have the ability to contribute as both the employer and employee and shield up to $53k from taxes in a 401k. This would be so helpful since you have to pay the full 15% self employment tax already."
financialindependence,3dyrgi,Internally_Combusted,3,Mon Jul 20 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"I'm in the process of converting my old employer 401k into a SEP IRA. Honestly, my money is mainly in a brokerage account currently - which I know because of this subreddit is not the ideal place. I thought I was limited to my $5500 contributions annually for the IRA. Betterment just created a SEP IRA which is what I'm opening. My old employer sponsored 401k is transferring to it this week actually."
financialindependence,3dyrgi,benjamindoughboy,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"You would have a lower limit for an SEP IRA than a 401(k) but it should still be higher than the $5500 normal contribution limit for an IRA. You would contribute as the employer only. I have included the limits language below:  The contributions you make to each employee’s SEP-IRA each year cannot exceed the lesser of: 25% of compensation, or $52,000 (for 2014; $53,000 for 2015 and subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments for later years).  http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-SEPs-Contributions  If I were you at your income levels I would open a 401(k). You can shield a lot more of your income from taxes which is huge when you are in the 28% bracket. Almost all of the $53k you could put in there would instantly save you 28% in taxes before dropping you into the 25% bracket. Then you could still contribute $5.5k to a Roth as the 401(k) contributions would keep you under the limit."

I guess these questions are getting complicated - I should probably ask my accountant..."

I have been paying $1,300 to rent my funky home for awhile.  These days, this is cheap rent in my area.  I've run the numbers, buying just doesn't seem like a good prospect--not for me now.  Anytime anyone wants to run the numbers with me, usually they hate the math, but understand that the conclusion to continue renting is viable. You get a lot of housing flexibility. Plus, you don't have to maintain the house.  Also, I can rent a far nicer place than I can buy in this area, so there's also that.    After selling my father's home, who lived in a nice neighborhood with an overbearing HOA, I have vowed to never live in a HOA. Condos are off my list."

I don't think the person you replied to really needs to expand on that, it's pretty common sense around a sub fully of financially-literate people that renting is not wasting money necessarily, it's a case by case basis. In NYC, for example, the cost to own is probably more than the cost to rent + investing money that isn't going towards a down payment / mortgage / maintenance."

financialindependence,3dyrgi,abrandnewhope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"On one hand buying lets you build equity. You are spending tens of thousands of dollars a year on rent. But on the other hand it is a leveraged undiversified asset. I'm not a real estate expert but I assume property values match inflation. But a single property will fluctuate with trends in NYC, the specific neighborhood, and other factors.  The rule of thumb is if you plan on staying put for the long, long term it is a good idea to buy but if the flexibility is valuable to you then it is better to rent. But that is an oversimplification. Some money still goes ""down the drain"" when you buy: mortgage interest, closing costs & realtor fees, property tax, and repairs.  It's definitely a tough call."

My roommate and I are currently splitting $1800 a month for a 2 bedroom in this same neighborhood.  The numbers just aren't making sense to me though because even if I bought a 2 bedroom place for myself with the down payment, then all of these other costs pop up that you mentioned (plus ongoing maintenance fees)."
financialindependence,3dyrgi,JaharNarishma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:09 2015 UTC,based on the price of a condo and your rent of $900 a month - you are doing the right thing.  save your money and invest it. you are young and owning a home will also tie you down.
financialindependence,3dyrgi,schwanzenator,10,Mon Jul 20 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"Because   1) you are losing a ton of money in closing costs just to buy the home. Broker fee. Legal fee. Bank fee. Inspection fee.   2) owning a home ain't free. You have property taxes. You have insurance expenses. You have maintenance expenses.  3) mortgage style amortization is not straight line. Most of your mortgage payment goes to interest in the first few years, and you don't really pay down the principal (aka ""build equity"") until the later years.  4) property values don't necessarily keep up with the stock market. You're plunking a huge chunk of money into an asset that might not grow. Lots of people would say it's better off to keep your money diversified so you don't get caught if one investment doesn't do your way.  In conclusion, you dig a deep hole when you buy real estate that you will crawl out of very slowly, much more slowly than people realize. Considering the opportunity cost of having flexibility and your money in the stock market, it is easy to see why renting is better."
financialindependence,3dyrgi,ckr801,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"As to #3, the mortgage interest deduction is one factor I'm not seeing addressed here.

NYC, SFO, DC/NoVA, and a few other high COL areas with relatively stable employment don't dip that much in housing during recessions, and more than make up for it when the recession is gone. The cons/risks with this strategy as far as I can tell is that you have to put a large amount for the down payment, the housing investment itself is illiquid, and you have to be able to find good, reliable tenants and fix anything that may go wrong.   I think if your neighborhood or wherever you're looking to buy is in an extremely desirable place (or becoming one), then you shouldn't have problems finding reliable tenants. However, you will still have to find time to devote to this investment."

I'm also 28 in NYC (born and raised) with about $150k in assets, who's been thinking about buying for a while. I casually look around here and there, but to be honest, I think I'm still years away from actually buying.   First off, I'm not 100% positive that I'll be in NYC long term. I most probably will, but who knows?   Secondly, I'm like you-- I'd most likely spring for a place around the $250-350k price range, and that down payment's not going to be cheap. Not to mention the closing costs, attorney fees, inspection fees, etc. Just way too much to deal with right now.

Here's the thing - I can probably find a studio or 1 bedroom in that range, but if I'm going to buy, I should buy a 2 bedroom, right? I don't know the answer. My thinking is if it's long term it should be slightly bigger - which brings me into the $500k plus range.

With a stock you literally get dividends, and capital gains. With a house you can get capital gains too, but the major benefit is never having to pay rent again.  With that emotional barrier out of the way, there are some risks you should consider that are not part of the rent vs. buy calculator.  Owning a home hedges against the risk of rising rental rates.  Renting hedges against risk of property damage which can cause serious major cash outflows. Renting also hedges against risk of moving unexpectedly and having to pay realtor fees."
financialindependence,3dyrgi,supercharged0708,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:08 2015 UTC,"u/PirateDrunk and u/abrandnewhope - You're both me - I'm 28-ish in NYC with ~150k in assets and I go through the cycle of ""Should I buy? --> research and actual financial calculations --> ""Do not buy"" at least once a season.  I've never run these numbers for other cities, but it's a totally different ballgame here when maintenance rates on decent places in that price range are, on average, at least $600 /mo. but typically close to or even over $1k/mo.  But I would keep the following in mind:   At our down payment rates, it seems the majority of what we can afford are new, tax-deferred Condos.  Do not ever, ever, by one of these.  The construction quality at this rate of purchase is usually horrible, and many places leak, have broken heating, and a host of other new construction problems that will cause you perpetual mental and financial agony (I've seen new construction Condominium Boards assess owners $50k in one fiscal year to, say, replace windows).  Source - I work in new construction litigation. Once in a while, really beautiful, pre-war cooperative apartments with reasonable maintenance rates (sub $500) can be found.  You just need to search vigorously and often. OP - the main question for me, and probably for you, is at what point will you not be able to stand living with a roommate anymore.  I also have one, and get to save a ton of money by doing so.  If and when you come to the point that you need to live by yourself in order to have personal happiness, the calculation becomes different because renting by yourself in NYC is really expensive - and at that point, spending $2k/mo renting a studio vs. $2.5k/mo to buy becomes a more equal comparison.   End ramblings."
financialindependence,3dyrgi,Behindtheline,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:14 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar position as you. To make the numbers work, see what your net cost would be of buying vs renting. Take into account your tax deductions of a primary residence (mortgage interest, property taxes, HOA, home office, etc) and see if it's worth it. In your tax bracket, it could be significant. While you will be building equity + appreciation (inflation?), it could very well be better for you to continue renting in the short term. However, I personally believe that in a long term hold - buying is generally better. The property can always serve as a rental down the line."

As for the mortgage, without the balance remaining or the interest rate there's not much we can help you with.  3) Contribute to the retirement accounts available to you, all the way up to the max (work your way up if you have to)  4) Once you are maxing those, save any extra in taxable accounts or pay off your mortgage faster  In the meantime, read the FAQ and the wealth of information on the sidebar.

You are 42, which puts you at 23 years until a ""standard"" retirement age, yet you are starting from nearly $0. This already would be an aggressive push towards FIRE. But lucky for you, you have a great income in a low cost of living area. You can still do this.  The basic gist of it will be for you to invest between 50-65% of your income after taxes. Let's say with your wife's income, after paying taxes, your total income is $100k just for simplicity. If you can live off of $50k, you can reach FI in approximately 17 years (59). If you can live off $35k, you can cut that down to about 10 years (52). It comes down to how well you can follow a strict budget. Figure out where you can cut costs. Even cutting a little bit off everything makes a big difference once they all add up.  You will need to, at minimum, cut your cost of living to $60k (investing 40%) to approximately be FI at 65."

financialindependence,3dy6lr,newark02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:58 2015 UTC,Unless there is a big change in healthcare or cancer development they will probably always stay in high demand. Volatility and a companies ability to remain profitable is another question though.
financialindependence,3dy6lr,maaku7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"Part of the reasoning is what is what /u/newark02 said -- the demand for health care and biotech is largely recession-proof. You don't stop getting cancer because you can't afford it.  Part of it is a hedge for my own health care costs in the future -- in the situations where my own health care costs go up by more than I am budgeting for, it is also more likely than not that these companies will be generating more revenue than analysts today are expecting. Or to put it differently, my expectation of future health care costs (medical inflation) is based on the same numbers hedge funds are using to value these companies. So if health care costs go up more than is expected, then these companies should have more than expected revenue, which means they would be presently undervalued, which means I would see capital gains to offset my higher health care costs.  Finally, part of it is domain knowledge. I'm a software engineer by trade, but I have a strong interest in synthetic biology and the diybio hacker revolution that is currently undergoing. I think there could be a radical change in the near future in how biotech and pharma gets developed and distributed. Something as transformative as silicon valley was in the 80's and 90's.

As for ""what do you do when they eventually don't beat the market"", it is remarkable just how long people have predicted the demise of Warren Buffett and others, and how long they have continued to beat the market year after year. At some point has an empiricist you simply have to accept the fact that the efficient market hypothesis doesn't always hold true. Berkshire Hathaway has a solid track record of beating the market. Primecap Odyssey funds has a similar although less well-known record. Health and biotech have had down years, but these sectors have consistently done better than the market over large windows.  At what point is it insanity to keep predicting that these will fail and keep being proven wrong year after year?"
financialindependence,3dy6lr,EveningNewbs,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"How long have you been investing with this firm? I'm not trying to argue that it's impossible; I'm genuinely curious.

financialindependence,3dy6lr,maaku7,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"Well you can research the funds yourself. Here's the Vanguard fund which follows PRIMECAP, although it is currently closed to new investors:  http://www.morningstar.com/funds/XNAS/VPMCX/quote.html  It has done 2% better than the S&P 500 after fees over a 25 year period with a 0.45% expense ratio.  RenTek is another one that has consistently done WAY better than the market. They're an HFT fund that has been doing 30-60% per year. It's a bit younger though, also closed to new investors.  There's the classic of Berkshire Hathaway, which has been getting 20% annualized returns since the 1960's. It's not technically a fund, but basically it behaves quite similarly since it is just an umbrella company that owns shares of other companies.  Basically the conventional wisdom here that you can never beat the market, and that active funds are a money-losing proposition, is demonstrably false. in my own case I have a 50/50 split of active/passive."

This is the biggest problem I see:   currently closed to new investors  also closed to new investors   Once it's been determined whether a manager is any good or not, the pool's already closed. There is a reason Warren Buffet is famous: he can outperform the index year over year. The vast majority of managers are going to underperform the index sooner or later, and if you've bought into them at that point then it's too late. If they do turn out to be a special snowflake and get great returns forever, if you haven't bought into them at that point then it's often also too late."
financialindependence,3dy6lr,maaku7,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:32 2015 UTC,"No absolutely, I agree. Any fund that does well gets closed pretty quick -- a closed fund is easier for a manager to achieve consistent returns on. The reason Warren Buffett is famous is not just that he as picked winners for so long, but that he has been operating his fund as a publicly traded company. There's been dozens of people on Wall St with similarly stellar performances (e.g. Jeffrey Epstein), but you don't hear about them because their client lists are secret and invite-only.  PRIMECAP's most performant fund, POAGX, is closed, as is the Vanguard version. But they have two funds POSKY and POGRX which are still open and I hold. If POAGX opens up again (as it occasionally does), I'd buy it. BRK has always been historically undervalued.  There are some great fund managers out there, if you take the time to find them. And with sites like morningstar it's not that hard anymore.  What boggles my mind is how much denial there is that there can actually be a fund manager that consistently beats the market, even in the face of 25 years of solid returns. Sure, maybe there's a 50/50 chance of beating the index on a given year -- but that also means that beating it over 25 years is a 1 in 33 million chance. So if you see someone with that kind of winning stretch, maybe they're actually on to something?  I don't think people shouldn't hold index funds. I just think people should diversify. As I said, I'm 50/50 index vs. active."

financialindependence,3dy6lr,meowmeowmeowmeowmeoo,6,Mon Jul 20 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"I've been getting into my side hustles again (motivation to do so comes in waves). I did several ""mystery shops"" this weekend which netted me $22 in pay and a little over $100 in goods (I probably would have spent $40 on my version of those goods in that time, ie home meals instead of eating out), so about $60 worth of value plus some free nice upgrades such as super delicious pizza instead of a microwaved burrito at home. The time spend was not insignificant, but I don't mind it too much, and I took it out of my video game time so net win IMO.  I set myself a budget to buy supplies for my once-profitable Etsy business. Not having a budget made me gun shy to buy new products. Now we'll see if I make the time to use the supplies. The demand is there because my product is unique, but it's very time consuming.  I spun up my first monetized blog this weekend after two prior failed attempts. This time it's a content blog on something I know that seems slightly underserved given the audience. Unfortunately its peak relevance is almost past so I don't know if it will even get search ranked before it naturally hibernates until next year. Regardless, I'm very happy with how this one turned out. I think the big difference is that it's something I've already done a shit-ton of research on rather than something I needed to research fresh, so the content flowed naturally and I could work on it for hours without fatigue. Additionally, I was already familiar with Wordpress this time so configuring something that looked decent took minutes, not hours.  That's my report. Have you pursued any side hustles lately?"
financialindependence,3dy6lr,Blasphemouse,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't been involved in any side hustles recently, but I ought to. Awhile back, I played around with Mechanical Turk and had some success, but not nearly worth the time.  How do you get involved in mystery shopping?"

I really like doing it, but some of the assignments are a slog so you have to be careful not to book too many in a row especially if you aren't familiar with that job or company (some are WAY easier/more worthwhile than others). They are also not super forgiving if you cancel or reschedule all the time, so you should be careful about scheduling only when you're definitely available, especially at first.  You can find job listings here, but their UI sucks. Once you find a company that does shops in your area through this, you can typically keep going back to them directly. http://mspa.jobslinger.com/exec/sfs/jobboard  If you happen to be in Southern California, PM me and I can save you some time and recommend companies directly.  This weekend, me and my boyfriend went bowling (including beer & food), had pizza and got fancy cat food for our cats, all free with pay on top. My favorite shops are when I walk into a place, buy some booze, report whether or not I was carded and get the booze + some cash. My favorite part is that it's completely opt-in so I can do as much or as little as I feel like in a week. I think I would do this even after I was retired... let's me do things (like eat out) much more than I would feel comfortable doing normally!"

My company contributes 3% to our 401k regardless if we contribute or not. I am maxing my other accounts and now want to make sure I max my 401k.  There are 11 pay periods left. There will be $893.75 contributed by the company at the end of those pay periods. That means I can still contribute $17,106.25 for the year. So I would need to contribute $1,555.11 per pay period for the next 11 pay periods to hit that number. So solving for X...  X = percent to contribute  $2,708.33 * X = $1,555.11  X = $1,555.11 / $2,708.33  X = ~57%  correct?"

This is generally the case with most of the population, and is most likely the case in your situation.   However, there is a way to contribute MORE on your end over the $18k limit, if your employer's 401k program allows for after-tax contributions over the $18k limit. The qualities of these special 401k's are listed under ""Variance #1"" in the Mega Backdoor Roth IRA article. Pretty cool, eh?"

financialindependence,3dy6lr,BetterDeadThanRed,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"I was trying to paint as simple of a picture as I could while adequately addressing his situation. Some plans do allow for post-tax 401k contributions, but you'd be better off just putting that into a taxable non-retirement account anyway. Gains on post-tax 401k contributions are taxed at Income rates, whereas you could withdraw taxable-account money at capital gains rates with a long enough holding period.  Edit: I did forget about the ability to rollover that money into a Roth IRA upon separation. That's certainly an advantage to adding post-tax 401k contributions"
financialindependence,3dy6lr,FatAlbert,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"And some allow you to rollover even without separation, which seems crazy.   My company allows me to rollover my after-tax contributions into a Roth 401k without separation. I think this works so I can keep contributing up to the $53k max, but I'm still looking for a good source."

Speak to your payroll department first. They may even be able to make the 401k contribution effective on a specific paycheck to make the math and timing easier.  Hopefully it only takes them 1 pay period to adjust your 401k contributions, because $18,000 ÷ 10 pay periods makes for easy math."

You don't have to worry about company match so it's an easy situation.  And you said you're maxing other accounts already.  If that means IRA, I would definitely recommend front-loading your 401k first.  IRA contributions are allowed until April 15th of the next year, while 401k contributions are not.  The only risk with front-loading a 401k is that you'll change jobs before the end of the year and maybe the new job has a better 401k plan or they require you to contribute for the company contribution to take affect.

It's pretty accurate, and takes local, state, and federal taxes into account as well as any optional withholdings you may have.  http://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary/  For COL, I find looking at Craigslist rentals, Trulia, Zillow, and grocery ads to be most effective. You can always use those COL A vs B calculators, but those factor in so many things I don't give a shit about. 75% of my budget is rent and food, so if I can get an accurate estimate of those in 2 locales, I can figure out which is best for me/how much of each salary will be going to those needs."

I started with the 'average cost of living' or some metric like that for the 2 areas I was considering. Lets say A was $50k and B was $55k.   So I would need to make 110% of A's salary to make B ""financially equivalent"" (e.g. 110A = 100B).  Whatever website I found said it included things like taxes and insurance rates - so I just left it as 'everything was calculated using the same assumptions'.

What makes you think that you'll be any happier though? Beware the ""grass is greener on the other side"" mentality. There are crappy aspects to every job, so make sure you do a comprehensive analysis to ensure you're making a change for the proper reasons. Is there anything you can do to make your current situation more tolerable? I gave up a high paying consulting career to take a permanent local job, but that was because the constant traveling was taking a huge toll on my personal life and relationships, and that was not something that I could change about the old job. Even the best jobs can have periods of boredom, nasty office politics, crappy bosses/coworkers/clients, etc., so just think through this carefully before deciding to jump ship."

I assume you are in some sort of project management role now and are unhappy with the fact that you are no longer actually designing anything but managing others who do the actual work. You just get to handle the bureaucracy and politics.  You're still plenty young and have time to save for FI and RE if you so choose. If you would really enjoy the work and increase your overall satisfaction with life then I would just make the change. FI is all about having options to maximize happiness and if that work makes you happy then the increased years to FI shouldn't feel like a grind and you may decide you don't even want to retire once you are FI."

I'm not a manager, thank goodness, but at my company they don't really do design. The easiest way to explain it is that they don't have a design culture, so while technically design gets done it's not really what we went to school to do. There are companies out there that do our skill set for real, but like I said the pay is roughly half.   Thanks for the thoughtful comment I really appreciate it."
financialindependence,3dzs1c,joelkarl1,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel.  I'm also a designer working for a company that doesn't 'design' or do anything I was taught to do in school.  It's just a business.  And I make a great salary, have stability and room for financial growth.  But all I can do is think about burning it all and leaving because I don't feel 'inspired' and I feel like I'm wasting my 'career' and my life.  This is the classic financial conundrum for any designer: make money doing the technical, boring stable work, or sacrifice salary (and usually quality of life) and work double the hours doing 'inspired' and creative design work. Reading your same conundrum gives me an outsider's perspective and I think logically this comes down to two important questions:   Is the company you're at going to stall your career?  You shouldn't stay somewhere for too long if it will mess up your chances for growth and keeping you professionally marketable.  What if your current company dissolves and fizzle in 10 years?  Would you be screwed bc you only know how to do things the 'archaic' way?  If the answer here is 'yes', then you need to consider leaving - but it doesn't have to be immediate.  Pad your savings first and have some solid investments. Is your life your job?  Some people live for their jobs and for them, being stimulated and created at work is their happiness - so the salary cut is worth it.  Other people (like me) job for their life, so if that 200k a year buys you the things and experiences you want to be happy, then accept and relish in that satisfaction and don't get caught up in ""the grass is greener on the other side""."

If I had tried to take the road to a specialist career as a medical doctor, I'm pretty sure I would be in a mental institution now, or in a grave. So I'm glad I took a lower-stress role. But it cost me something, and that is time: it will take me more time to become FI. (On the other hand, being FI in a mental institution or while death... Not really much fun).   So I'm pretty sure most people would agree that there has to be some balance between job salary and quality of life. For example, if you keep increasing the suckiness of the job, I think most people will ultimately say ""no"" to it, no matter how much you will pay them to do it.   But the balance is different for every person. And I don't know you very well, so I don't know where it is for you. If you are currently on the brink of insanity, then please, switch jobs. If you're just a little restless, then I would try to hang in there, say for one more year to start with (giving you the opportunity to save another $80k or so before switching to a lower-paying job)."

He HAS to stay for 3 more years, so he can retire and we can keep our health benefits, which are much needed.  He'll also get a bigger pension.  He's in a Union.  He'd quit in a heartbeat if he could, but being there for close to 30 years, and quitting at the finish-line would be a bad move in his opinion.  BTW, he'll be 52 when he retires.

financialindependence,3dzs1c,lunapo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"Rather than taking the drastic route, I'd suggest looking around at other companies. I don't know how much you're ""assuming"" you can't find a comparable pay for a more interesting role, but it's certainly worth looking into.  I know at Amazon / Facebook / Google, they do hire interaction designers, and I'm reasonably sure they're paid in the 6 figures (I haven't actually had one report to me directly, so I can't guarantee). Things are never perfect, but certainly the big tech companies have some pretty interesting challenges to solve (I think) in regards to interactions.

financialindependence,3dyou0,Pzychotix,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Well, for the most part, it wouldn't hurt any of us at all. Remember, even if you're retiring early/within the next 3 years, it doesn't mean you're pulling out all your assets and selling everything. Even if you're doing a rebalance, you probably have plenty of other assets to rebalance with and you could just leave anything with STCG alone.  With that in mind, it's probably an overall good thing to us as it raises taxes in ways that doesn't cost us anything (slightly reducing the possibility that there will be a need to tax us)."

Invest your $100 in real assets like equities and part of the price appreciation of equities is solely due to inflation. Equities have always been a good inflation hedge, which is why balanced mutual funds typically don't add TIPS to the fixed income side until equities fall below a certain threshold, since both equities + TIPS hedge inflation.   $100 under your mattress stays $100   My example was implying $100 in the stock market   I think OP is trying to say the $100 gain is not really a $100 gain because some portion of that goes to bring the total purchasing power up to equal whatever purchasing power $100 had, and the rest is the gain.   yes exactly   However, I am not sure why we should expect capital gains tax to adjust gains for an inflation index   Because your real wealth didn't actually increase if all it did was keep pace with inflation. THe tax then becomes arbitrary. It also arbitrarily increases with the inflation rate. If the real yield is 2% you get a very different real tax rate whether inflation is 0% or 10%. In the 10% scenario, your effective capital gains is actually infinite as you might pay a 20% tax on that 12% total yield, reducing your nominal yield to say 9.6%, or a 0.4% real loss due to taxes. That's an infinite effective tax rate! Man would have sucked to be an invest in the 70s. That's why gold skyrocketed back then.   when even TIPS (whose purpose is to keep up with inflation) gains are subject to Federal capital gains taxes.   Just because the Federal government taxes something doesn't mean it makes sense, or is optimal. The government does many vastly stupid things.

The optimal bundle is the one the individual would choose if there were no taxes (and externalities--but we won't get into that today.) Actually let's get into externalities: since capital investment has a positive externality by growing the economy, we should actually introduce a negative capital gains tax. Actually there are a lot of models like the ""AK model"" in economic literature that say a capital gains subsidy would be optimal since capital investment has positive externalities through spillover benefits to other firms who can ""copy"" your capital, etc."

Insofar as she is successful in her other measures to micromanage exec pay and board behavior, it can only diminish the long-term profitability of businesses and hence lower equity returns. The market doesn't need to be micromanaged. If companies are being managed inefficiently, someone can buy them out and turn them around.  If she is serious about reforming the capital gains tax, she should either eliminate or at the very least set the long-term rate to 0.

It's good advice, in that it helps refocus the question. It's very easy to pay 0% tax - just make no money. The actual question most people are asking is ""How do I maximise the amount of money I can keep?"" but they can get misled into terrible investments if they focus too much on 'tax savings' instead.  So being exposed to that information helped me better understand my finances and filter my decisions."

You are like an athlete going a million miles a minute (I did a little time in Investment banking, not for me). And you will grind to a screeching halt in a few years. I am intrigued by what your plans could be.  Also, intrigued by how you saving all your money to be FI plays with all the work hard play hard culture on the street with your colleagues."
financialindependence,3dxr2a,juliusseizure,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and happy to hopefully give some answers.  The FI mantra is all about the choice to go a million miles a minute (I wish my body reflected that of an elite athletes) vs having to.  If in the future, once I achieve FI, I still crave the deal making rush then I stay in.  If not, then I give my ""fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you"", drop the mic, then bounce for greener pastures.  I think I've got a solid 5-10 years left in me for banking.  I'm the head of a product area right now with an inexperienced team supporting me, so my travel is insane (in the past month have been to Asia as well as two separate trips to south america).  To say the least, I'm grinding right now and sometimes wish for the days I had the simple life working as a waiter.  I'm pretty resilient, but something will give eventually.  As for next steps, I don't see myself going cold turkey.  I actually enjoy working as well as the social aspect that goes along with it.  I would like to maybe serve in local public office or work in a CFO capacity for start ups (where I can take equity as I don't need cash flow).  I've had my fair share of live hard/play hard nights.  However, they're not the norm for me (I hate going out on Friday nights) and not necessarily my preferred firformm of entertainment (home cooked pot luck game night preferred over going to abar/club).  However, wherever there is a blowout, it's typically on the firms dime (client entertaining)."

Elective deferrals do not include:   Salary reduction contributions made pursuant to a one-time irrevocable election that is made when an employee is initially eligible to participate in the salary reduction agreement (See Treas. Reg. 1.402(g)-1(c)(1)), or Pre-tax contributions made as a condition of employment (See Treas. Reg. 1.402(g)(3)-1).   ...  4.72.13.11.5  (11-12-2014)  Examination Steps for IRC 402(g)  10.

The operation of the plan and whether participants have revoked their elections.  B. Employment conditions and whether contributions are a condition of employment.  C. Plan documents, SPDs, funding vehicles and any memorandum or other communications to employees.  Note: Employer’s descriptive labels may be misleading; such as employer, employee, mandatory, one-time irrevocable or condition of employment.  11.

I have a similar setup, where I put in the full $18K voluntary contribution plus a matched percentage. The percentage goes into a non-voluntary account, which is why I can put in more than $18K total. Both accounts are pre-tax 403b's. I clarified all this with HR several years ago,and I've been on this plan ever since."
financialindependence,3dykxm,IndependentlyPoor,6,Tue Jul 21 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but 401Ks are by definition voluntary, I.e. they can't force you to contribute like they could with some pension plans. They can auto-enroll you, but you are free to opt out. If that is the case then ""mandatory"" contributions don't make a lot of sense, nor do their exclusion from the annual limit.  There are no rules, however, against the company simply funding that 5% without any contribution on your part which would exclude it from your limit.   Also, if it is not technically a 401K, then the rules are different, obviously."

financialindependence,3dykxm,nighserenity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"Do you have a way of checking your pay stubs (I'm assuming you have direct deposit)? Take a look on how that ""mandatory"" 5% is being calculated. The amount that is counting towards the 18k limit should be shown as a subtraction from your paycheck. Also that amount subtracted will show as not counted towards calculating the taxes taken out of your pay. Anything additional from your company to your 401k is just added in a separate line.  This would give you the IRS's perspective, the only one that counts!"
financialindependence,3dykxm,nomaddave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:46 2015 UTC,It is coming as a subtraction that is pre-tax. That's what makes me think it counts for the 18k limit. But the employer and Fidelity have both said they believe it doesn't. The reasoning sounds to me (with the reading I've done) like it's counted as a form of a defined benefit plan (maybe profit sharing) since it's in our contract as a condition of employment.
financialindependence,3dykxm,CJ-Johnson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:07 2015 UTC,"Is this an actual company or a state/federal institution? Reason I asked is because, as others have noted, 401k and 403b contributions must be combined to reach your maximum contribution. However, considering the sub we're on, if you're with state you probably also have an option for a tax-deferred 457 plan which has a completely separate max contribution limit.  I only ask because 403b's seem to only be offered within state/fed institutions from what I have seen and heard.  Edit: Also, I believe only state/fed can obligate you into participating in a 401k so far as I have seen."

Find out what you feel that work or chores is blocking you from doing, and that's what you feel most comfortable with.

financialindependence,3duc66,Captain_Stairs,13,Mon Jul 20 02:20:02 2015 UTC,"It's odd that people have such a negative view on gaming, but absolutely rave about meditating.   When you play games, especially complicated ones that require more than just quick response time, your brain is actually dealing with a lot and it does train you on many mental/social aspects: awareness of your surrounding, problem solving, team work, and so on. But people still view it as an activity fueled by laziness, and even gamers treat it as guilty pleasure.  With meditating, you literally do nothing. You're not supposed to engage in complicated brain tasks cause it's supposed to be resting time for your brain. But the buzz words you see are health, calming, tranquility, etc. I'm not saying that's worse, I just want to point out this contradiction on the perception of these two popular activities people do in their free time.   So you shouldn't feel bad about being unproductive at all. If you enjoy it, it is not time wasted. It's your life and as long as you're enjoying your activities, you are being productive, because you are producing happiness for yourself. This may sound a bit too hedonistic, but there are other things that bring fulfillment in lives besides pure entertainment too of course.  Someone always links Bertrand Russell's essay on idleness in regards of our modern day obsession with productivity. So here."
financialindependence,3duc66,PuffinTheMuffin,6,Mon Jul 20 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"I believe gaming unfairly gets a bad rap - we all spend time in our own ways, and it's certainly better and more mentally engaging than, say, watching TV. I don't judge anyone for doing it, and do it some myself.  But it's not like meditation in the slightest. Meditation clears your head so you can get more in touch with the language your soul is speaking. It makes you more empathetic and physically healthy. Countless times I've meditated on tricky problems and come away with real clarity. It makes you more focused, present, and engaged in life.  I don't think video games are bad for you - they may have some benefits - but certainly not those kinds of benefits. We live in a deeply distracted world where we lose touch with how we actually feel and think and meditation is one of the few ways to achieve spiritual clarity.   Gaming is fine, meditation is awesome and its benefits are medically recognized."

I come home from work/gym and sit down at the computer instead of watching a movie, not because there's a specific thing I want to work on, but because That's What I Do. Sort of like how some people on this subreddit will eschew all worldly diversions to make their numbers go up faster. Depriving yourself of sleep reduces your cognitive function and is surprisingly easy to build up. So the next day you feel shitty physically, and mad you didn't get work done. So you stay up and try to work more, but are inefficient because you feel shitty. Repeat until you've gone all week without really getting anything done and you're so sleep deprived that you're basically intoxicated. Alternatively, you could be more diligent about getting something done, and if you don't do it, step away and rest instead (sleep or just relaxation).

Also, wages would increase proportionally to capital, so that 60% reduction in capital income would be offset by a 60% increase in wages.

Lack of demand.  You need consumption in a capitalist economy.  Constantly expanding consumption.  Because with technology we always get more efficient at creating things.  Less and less workers are needed to make the same amount of things.  So if you have a large class of people that survives through wage based income, they need jobs to get by.  So to ensure they have jobs consumption has to increase.  Overall the system has to consume as much as before, plus additional for workers displaced by technological advancement.  Forever.  WWII saved the economy.  Build ships, blow them up, build tanks, blow them up.  That's great for a capitalist economy.  But after the war government planners recognized that stimulus was needed or we'd go right back into a Depression.  And so the Cold War began.  A massive government funded stimulus that led to things like computers, the internet, and other advancements.  It's a good thing to produce less if your economy is structured based on meeting people's needs, but capitalist economies are structured to maximize profit, not meet needs.  That's why we spend billions on cosmetic surgery but watch people starve or die of malaria when relatively small amounts of money could save them."

The economy works itself out without the need for government intervention. Capitalism is structured to meet needs -- if a firm isn't meeting needs it goes bankrupt."
financialindependence,3duc66,ckr801,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:38 2015 UTC,"History shows capitalist economies often need government intervention.  S Korea had massive government intervention in the economy, blocking imports, banning Koreans from investing in non-Korean companies.  Japan had massive state subsidy to various industries as well as protectionist policies.  And the US is another case.  WWII was essentially a command economy.  The post WWII economy was one dominated by government subsidized research as well as demand for products like armaments.  The capitalist economies that lack that kind of intervention include Haiti, all the African nations, the Philippines, many of the Latin American and South American countries, especially during the years when US backed dictatorships were being imposed.  Not sure why the name calling, but these are the historical facts."
financialindependence,3duc66,fifteencat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:04 2015 UTC,"Ha, Japan's economic interventions have crippled it, not helped it. Just look at the Japanese stock market the past 20-30 years. You can listen the EconTalk podcast between Russ Roberts and Mike Munger on this. The Japanese govt tried to crush Honda by subsidizing its competitors like Toyota, and now Honda is its best car company despite that disadvantage. Top-down planning only backfires. If a company is meant to survive in the free market, it will survive in the free market. Quod erat demonstrandum."

The closest thing to a free market economy (no such thing actually exists) is the countries I mentioned. Typically it's called the third world. Ha-Joon Chang's book ""Bad Samaritans"" covers this in detail if you are interested in facts. I'd prefer to live in Japan as opposed to Haiti. The idea that free markets produce prosperity, that's like a religious belief for which there is no evidence."
financialindependence,3duc66,fifteencat,0,Mon Jul 20 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"The idea that free markets produce prosperity, that's like a religious belief for which there is no evidence.   Ha, good one. Most economic growth since the industrial revolution was thanks to free markets. Heck, the reason the industrial revolution started in England and not say France or Germany was because of their relatively free markets. The reason the US grew to become a world power in the 19th and early 20th century was because of free markets. The reason China recently grew since the 90s is in part because of a decentralization of government and an increase in free markets.  Study some basic economics dude. Read Adam Smith, Henry Hazlitt, Friedrich Hayek, Frederic Bastiat, Milton Friedman. You have a lot to learn. And don't make ridiculous claims like calling free markets a ""religious belief"". Fear of free markets is more like a religious belief."
financialindependence,3duc66,ckr801,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"I have read economics, especially those of the right.  I used to agree with everything you've said.  But they don't make a strong case based on the actual historical record.  They explain how logically it would seem free markets would be best.  They talk about division of labor and pareto optimal.  What they don't do is look at the world and how it really functions.  So for instance they don't seem to notice that during the most rapid growth in the history of the US we were a command economy.  They don't notice that tariff rates were around 50% in the US during the 19th and early 20th centuries, or that England blocked superior textile products from places like the Netherlands in order to build their own industries, or that the Kings supported various industries, the industries that ultimately led their economic growth in subsequent years.  Sure, England did move to freer markets, but this was only after government intervention allowed them to build their industries up.  This is often called ""kicking away the ladder.""  Use the heavy hand of government to strengthen your economy, then demand that other countries not be afforded the same luxury because you don't want your products to be prevented from exploiting their markets.  So in the US we had the same infant industry protection, but after WWII there was a total about face.  We demanded other nations not allow government to get in the way.  Drop their tariff rates, reduce their government expenditures, remove their restrictions on our capital movement within their economies.  That way we can exploit their markets because now we were the richest, biggest, and strongest nation in the world.  We used government intervention to get there, but then demand that others not be permitted to do the same.  A religious belief is one that comes without evidence, doesn't actually look at the world but repeats mantras like ""Most economic growth since the industrial revolution was thanks to free markets.""  What is the real world evidence that supports that assertion?  Go to Haiti, where they have extremely low taxes, no limits on capital flows, property rights vigorously defended.  Compare with S Korea, which was similarly poor in the 60's.  Korea then used government intervention in industries, blocked foreign imports, regulated capital flows.  As China does today.  All things that radically violate the free market.  Conservatives need to look at the world rather than repeat mantras."

Although I don't believe that is a prerequisite for a successful business, save maybe direct competitors of that business as when a consumer is shopping for goods/services one company's product will win over another, but it is this that drives innovation, or should at least.   40hr work week is something that lets motivated and determined people get ahead, and allows others to stagnate.   You lost me here. While I feel what you are saying and appreciate a good work ethic, getting ahead would entail advancing over those who do not have a strong work ethic (at least in a workplace sense).   If we all work a set amount of hours, and the emphasis is on what you do during those hours, one could get ahead with a 30 hour work week, or assuming a highly motivated individual could maintain pace that person could get considerably far ahead with an 80 hour work week...and if she/he is lucky they can eventually be promoted to a salaried position with the promise of higher more stable pay and the freedom to work however many hours it takes for the same pay, in reality this can be good in some cases but in others, well, refer back to the ""sometimes its the expense of the employee"" point.   Now in fairness of practicality I acknowledge there must be limits to this, I certainly don't believe we all should be able to show up, work hard for an hour and call it a day, but I do believe we are human and being so busy making a living that you forget to make a life, is no way to live.  So why today with our technological advances (and highly outsourced manufacturing) is 40 the magic number of hours?

He has to find some sort of explanatory mechanism that connects the incentives of fast food / movie theatres / toys and games etc to his and other professional's 40 hour employment. Without this, his case falls apart.  He's also conveniently not counting the opportunity cost of his low-money activities. If he has an earning potential of, say, $40/hr after taxes (not outlandish for an engineer), spending a 5 weekday hours reading on the beach is costing him $200 whether he admits it or not.  If he'd rather have the day on the beach than the $200, that's fine. But if someone else would rather have the $200 than the day on the beach, that's fine too.

That's a problem. People need to be able to talk and engage in human conversation.   I am scared of this happening to me where I become obsessed with the idea of money as my only source of escape because I will have no other way to make myself happy. Currently, I have thought of a few solutions, I plan to go somewhere quiet every so often. Spread out my holidays, take weekend-long trips to quiet places not city for partying though that can be good on occasion as well. I plan on finding a quiet Buddhist monastery in my home country that I can go to every so often. Yea, it costs a lot of money and time, but there's a certain feeling of removal you get when you put yourself in places where you don't have access to the same level of comfort, money and accessibility.

financialindependence,3dxutr,Bankster88,14,Mon Jul 20 12:46:42 2015 UTC,"So, the 401(k) vs. pension is debate is totally orthogonal to the average return question. Pensions aren't magic, and cannot actually deliver better-than-market returns over the long term. When pension systems make commitments to high payouts, and then the market experiences a protracted slump, the pensions just default on their promises. A lot of politics goes into pretending this isn't true, but obviously it is - if pensions could produce better-than-market returns in the long term, all rich people would set up their own pensions instead of buying stocks.  Now on to the question of total contributions. The best thing employers can do to help their employees have a comfortable retirement is to make the 401(k) opt-out rather than opt-in. People who take an active role in managing their own finances will be no worse off, as they can simply choose to opt out if for some reason they prefer that. Meanwhile, the ~75% of the workforce who are utterly clueless and have never really looked at their finances will be protected from their own ignorance by a growing retirement account in a general target-date fund computed based on their current age and the SSI retirenent age."

Completely agree. A big chunk of the money my wife and I save is in the form of 401k contributions and discounted Employee Stock Purchases that come out of our checks, so we ""never had it"" to begin with. I can be a bit of an impulse buyer sometimes, and while we refuse to go into CC debt, I'm not sure we'd be able to be FI as early as we're planning if it meant taking money I have ""in my hands"" and investing it. Psychologically, for me at least, there's a difference between never getting my hands on it to begin with, and giving it up once I have it.  If people put 5%, 10%, etc., straight into 401k right when they start their first job out of school, and leave it like that, succumbing to lifestyle inflation and falling behind in retirement savings wouldn't be as big of a problem (that's assuming you stay out of debt)."

No the best thing employers can do is choose plans with low fees instead of the ubiquitous 2-3% E/R plans. Opting people in by default doesn't solve that problem.

And suppose that every year the losers were tossed out, and the game replayed with those who remained.

There is no working around it.  Also, not saving enough for retirement is a personal problem, not a collective problem so statements like ""we are going to be in trouble as a country"" are completely unfounded."
financialindependence,3dxutr,ckr801,8,Mon Jul 20 14:13:31 2015 UTC,While saving for retirement is a personal problem it also has large scale implications if millions of people cannot adequately support themselves in old age. We don't just let people die on the streets so it will end up on taxpayers to support these people. It is similar to when people don't have health insurance. They become a net drain on the system as it is currently setup which has consequences for everyone.
financialindependence,3dxutr,Internally_Combusted,4,Mon Jul 20 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"So the options are what?  Mandate defined benefit funds, creating a drag on corporate earnings, sending PE ratios even higher and likely dragging stock returns down in the process?  What about the self-employed?    Mandate a minimum 401k savings rate?  Sounds like privatized social security and we know how much of a boogeyman that is on the left side of the aisle.  The math isn't hard.  If you save ~10% of your income for your entire career, you have a very good chance of retiring after 45 years.  Yet so many people have accepted the common thought that they ""need"" 100% of their paycheck to live and can't scrape together saving 10% before taxes because they get accustomed to an artificially inflated lifestyle.  I say artificially inflated because the fact that they aren't saving means that it is not sustainable."
financialindependence,3dxutr,EventualCyborg,5,Mon Jul 20 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what the solution is exactly. I was just responding to this part of your response:  -Also, not saving enough for retirement is a personal problem, not a collective problem so statements like ""we are going to be in trouble as a country"" are completely unfounded.  We could certainly be in trouble as a country if we have millions of people who cannot adequately support themselves and it is now on the government to figure something out. Solutions to problems like this should be discussed far in advance so that we don't have to put a short term bandaid on it when it finally comes. I don't think defined benefit plans are the answer but the idea of having 401(k)'s as opt-out does not sounds like a terrible solution. You are not mandating anything and it is still privatized retirement. Its just a measure that sets the default at an acceptable level so that someone has to take some sort of action to fuck it up or make it better. Keep educating the public to try and create a social change over time but in the meantime we could try an easy button and hope people don't fuck it up."

I actually don't want people opting in by default because it gives more power to 401k managers who already have a monopoly and charging 2-3% off the top each year.  I also don't want people opting in because then they bid up asset prices which bids down my own investment returns. The generous equity premium depends upon the average investor being too ignorant to know to invest in equities. Like my own parents -- terrified of stocks, will never invest in them again since the dot-com bubble and crash. People like that, who keep all their money in CDs, are essentially subsidizing smart money like us. Our generous equity returns depend upon their ignorance."
financialindependence,3dxutr,ckr801,5,Mon Jul 20 18:30:32 2015 UTC,That is great for your personal views but that is not how the world actually works. Society at large will call for action from the government as they have always done. You can disagree with that option all you want but that doesn't mean it isn't going to happen anyway. Look at health insurance/costs for a great example. People went uninsured and when they needed care bad enough they went to the emergency room and then didn't pay their bill. This translates to higher rates for everyone else to cover these costs. It is a wealth transfer that was just taking place in the private sector. Then the problem got bad enough that people got upset about it and turned to who? The government and thus the ACA was born. I am pretty sure we are on our way to a single payer system in not too many more years since the ACA was a half cocked implementation that will likely cause more problems.

I am saying that there is an expenditure to provide some level of care. If they don't have the money for it than the government is flipping the bill. The living conditions are not the point of this conversation. The economic aspects of it are what I am discussing. Millions of people will not literally be sitting in the streets dying because they don't have money. They will be in some sort of shelter or elderly care facility. These facilities may be awful but they still cost money which is the point. I am just saying that there are large scale implications if millions of people do not have the ability to pay for their own care due to inadequate savings. There will be calls for reform to ensure the elderly are provided with some level of care if it gets really bad. This will have to be taxpayer funded. I am not claiming it should be handled in any specific way. I am just laying out the scenario that could arise.

If you can't figure this out on your own, I can't explain it to you. The simple logic is as demand for an asset increases, it bids up the price of that asset.

To your other point about expense ratios I would like to point out that as vanguard index funds get more popular the expense ratios go down as passive funds become cheaper to manage as a % of the portfolio with each additional investor.   Most employers do not use Vanguard. They use shitty funds like John Hancock that charge 2-3% per year in management fees. They actually rely on people passively opting into them without thinking twice. If people opted out of any fund with a high expense ratio they would all die. They prey on investor ignorance, and a law that shields them from competition: if you forego a 401k, you are crippling your ability to shelter investments from taxes. We don't need a bigger 401k market -- we need to eliminate the 401k's arbitrary monopoly on retirement savings and let people contribute the same amount to an IRA. For employer matches, let them contribute directly to your IRA, or let individuals rollover a 401k into an IRA at any time without having to leave their employer first (so arbitrary)  Seriously the entire strategy of getting people to put more money into 401ks is only going to compound the problem of high fees.

I recently calculated that I should have put the $170K I borrowed for my first home into Apple Shares. My net worth would be well over my FI target at this point. Either that 'fact' depresses you, or it makes you realise that any sort of life comparison is complete BS.  As a similarly-aged guy (I'm 33) I've had the ""it's too late"" conversation with a few friends over the past couple of years, though in regards to careers not FI. Here's my math:  Most people of our generation will work for basically 50 years (age 20 - 70. Pension age for us in Australia, where I live, is already 70 and between now and the 2050s I can only see that being pushed further back).  At 30, you have therefore only used 20% of your time. If someone were 20% of their way into a disgusting meal, you wouldn't tell them to finish it. If someone was 20% of their way into a degree, and hated it, you wouldn't tell them to keep going because they were so close to the end. So deciding at 30 that you want to change your career path - in your case, to a FI-focused path - makes perfect sense. It's definitely not ""too late"".  It sounds like you made some conscious decisions in your 20s to enjoy life and travel, which was absolutely the right thing to do. No point retiring at 38 and dropping dead the next day. No point comparing yourself to either the instantaneously wildly rich people or the folks in their 60s begging for food - neither comparison helps you.   Where else could I be saving? How I can speed up path to FI?   It sounds like you're doing really well, especially on the Savings front saving / investing something like 40% of your Gross. Your next option then would be around earning more, for example:   When was your last payrise? Was it sufficient? Could you change jobs? If you're happy, it's not worth it unless they pay a LOT more - and even then you run the risk of just doing it for the money. But if your job is unfulfilling, go find one that nurtures you spiritually and financially Side Hustle / Beer Money etc. Start a side business - the kind that might pull in an extra $100K+ per annum. Easier said than done, but I'm throwing out the options Buy a property. In the Bay Area then DEFINITELY easier said than done, but the right property purchased with an investor's eye would be an asset, an income source (renting out spare rooms), and possibly even lower your monthly rent spend.

I try not to play the comparison game (especially here in the Bay Area) and have actively worked at not doing that over the last few years. Just creeps up on me you know?  The combination of not having been in my current job for a year, fairly interesting work, and the company not doing amazing financially at this point makes me hesitant to ask for more. I could probably get an additional $20K somewhere else, but would not have the same kind of flexibility (working remotely, etc.). Reading your post made me realize again that I'm probably not doing a good job at investing the money I am saving.  I do in fact get most of my beer money from playing cards :-) and am considering weekend daytime bar backing to make some more cash.  Side business seems like a real possibility. I think I should look more into that.  I've look all over the Bay Area for property, but with so little money to put down even modest investments way out are out of reach. In many cases, moving away from the urban areas actually get even more expensive.  Again, I really appreciate the response and perspective!"

Now I'm dating a daughter of Mexican immigrants, and she really puts my privilege into perspective. To her, I was born a rich kid and had access to things she could never dream of. In retrospect, everything I ""accomplished"" looks petty in comparison to where I started - as opposed to her, who had to fight to get anywhere in life.   If you don't have to worry about how to feed yourself, you're tremendously lucky. If you have reliable transportation, you're tremendously lucky. If you can Reddit at a cushy, well paying job... welll, you get the idea.  I still maintain that most middle class people can pursue FI, but still it's important to realize how tremendously fortunate you are to be in the middle class in America."

Anyway, take a side gig if you're really that concerned.  But otherwise, just save, invest, repeat.  And stop comparing yourself to other people.  They're probably lying about their net worth anyway."
financialindependence,3dx2cx,Fry_Incognito,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:08 2015 UTC,I agree I need to stop comparing myself to others as difficult as that may be around here. The $300K figure comes from: (Gross Salary * 27) / 10
financialindependence,3dx2cx,shwarma_heaven,2,Tue Jul 21 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"OK, so this is a timetable you set for yourself.   I had a few of those.  I was gonna be done by 45, but I stopped at 49.  I  had a great time, but went back to work at 50 for a couple more years, and stopped for good at 52.    And when you're already FI, and still working, and still living cheap, you can bank a lot of cash in a very short while.  And it'll seem like you can never have enough cash to stop for good.  But in your fifties, some of your friends from high school will start dying - and it'll make you question how much time you have left.  You won't stick exactly to your timetable, your priorities will change. Just try to grow your net worth each year.  In my 30's I did some side gigs that boosted my income by 20% a year, and banked it all.  That helped a lot.  You've got the priorities right, and sometimes that's better than a plan."
financialindependence,3dx2cx,CalcBros,5,Tue Jul 21 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"You may not have a net worth of 300K but you're really not in a bad position at all. You seem to have no debt, a good salary and low expenses. You may have missed out on some opportunities (although really it sounds like you just took advantage of other opportunities, which have their own value) but you have also put yourself in a position to take advantage of opportunities to come and that's important.  What are you doing with your savings currently? I see that you're almost maxing out your 401K (which is good) but you don't mention an IRA. The first thing you probably want to do is establish one and contribute the max each year (currently $5500.) It sounds like contributing to this should be no problem if you're saving 2000 per month currently. While you're at it I would also recommend maxing out the 401K as well.  If you feel like you could be saving more, keep track of everything you're spending (maybe use something like YNAB? Or maybe hook up mint.com and use that for a few months?)  Right now your net worth is increasing by ~ 3500 per month which is pretty good. When I was 30 I had just been hired at a job paying approximately as much as you are making and had an even lower net worth after doing a PhD program and then taking a low paying job for a few years. I just turned 34 (got married in between which helps) and we're now close to 300K in net worth and will likely add ~ 100K to that per year for the next few years.   I think you've got yourself in a relatively good position. Now it's just about taking advantage of that and seeing the numbers pile up."

financialindependence,3dx2cx,ChronicElectronic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:06:27 2015 UTC,I have seriously considered a roommate. Unfortunately the rents have gone up so much since I moved into my 1 bedroom (rent controlled apt) that getting a two bedroom would result in me paying the same amount and having to deal with another person. The only way a roommate would work is if I go so far out that my commute would be 1 to 1.5 hours each way. Paying less anywhere near where I am would result in living in unsafe neighborhoods. Really.  No sense in saving for FI and ER if I don't survive that long to make it. The Bay Area is crazy when it comes to housing.
financialindependence,3dx2cx,ChronicElectronic,4,Tue Jul 21 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"Hello there. Apparently, you are me 5 years ago (in a lot of ways).  In case this is true, let me tell you how it worked out:    Retirement net worth:     Age 30: $66,300 Age 31: $78,844 Age 32: $81,500 Age 33: $102,800 Age 34: $139,200 Age 35: $203,200   Notice any big jumps?  Almost all of those increases were based on market changes.  From age 30 - 33, I didn't contribute much at all to retirement.  At age 34, I followed the instructions of this sub.  I maxed my 401k, Roth Ira, spousal IRA, and contributed to a brokerage, too.  I made more income at 34 years old than 35, but cut expenses to make it work.    Now, at the pace I'm going, I think it's likely that I'll retire at age 50.  Slow, by this subs standards, but like you...I live in an expensive area in SoCal.  I don't want to move (family, schools, lifestyle, etc.), so I'll  live with the few extra years of work.    You, on the other hand...are much farther along in the game.  You have a networth close to what mine was at the same age...yet, you're making sense of what you need to do 4 years earlier than I did."
financialindependence,3dx2cx,Voerendaalse,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for your post. Really encouraging to see that kind of growth. Although I am in the Bay Area now. I eventually plan to move somewhere significantly cheaper after achieving FI.

You are doing just fine. You got to travel while you were young - again, people would MURDER to get to do that. I honestly regret not doing more traveling when I was in my 20's. Instead, I worked my ass off and joined the rat race. If I could go back in time, I would definitely have taken more trips with my friends instead of slaving away in my office.   You are doing more than fine. BTW, you're young! 30 is my favorite age. Now that you know the path you want to be on, work towards it but don't get so stressed out that you don't enjoy the journey. I started on my FI path later (when I passed 30) and I'm trying to enjoy it all rather than have it drag me down and stress me out. And I make a lot less money than you do, OP.  Life is meant to be lived, don't forget that. Good luck."

I would say: stop comparing yourself to others and create a path in life that is satisfying to you. I would also say: try a cooking class. It could be a way to make friends, and it will certainly be a way to learn some more about cooking. You don't have to cook at home every day, but it can be a nice change, and it can be a very valuable skill (both before and after you reach FI status). And it's really not that hard."

financialindependence,3dx2cx,supercharged0708,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:48:26 2015 UTC,"Good, another colleague on the path!  Welcome!  Can you change the past?  (I can't either.)  Well, look forward, and find out whether you've got grounds for dismay.  If you can get a sense of what expenses might be after moving, just keep socking away the money now.  Rough target is 25x annual expenses somewhere else, plus house cost there if you want to buy a house.  That could be 25x25k+100k=725k$ to 25x33k+150k=975k$ (or less, or more) for an outright retirement somewhere else, depending on where and how it looks for you.  Putting your numbers together, and presuming you spend your unaccounted-for ~$3375/mo take-home, you're gaining ground at $40k yearly.   If you're really at $1525/mo expenses, you could be financially independent in four years, and at 725k$ by three years later.  Then make your move with the target amount in hand.  I suggest you start on clarity.  Read the FAQ here for paths;  track your expenses fully, keep working on reducing them, and invest the difference wisely;  decide what will fulfill you;  research where you might like to end up, and costs in those places, so you can set yourself a target to shoot for.  Tweaks like learning to cook can come once you decide what your target situation looks like.  It's far easier to say ""nope, I'm cooking instead of going out"" twice a week more often when that gets you another $120/mo closer to your target number AND lowers your target number by $36k (thus 5-6 months sooner!)."

In 1 year you'll hit 100k net worth and start to see dividends become more hefty, in 2 years you'll be breaking down the door of 150k.  Keep it in perspective.  I often get frustrated by seeing people in their mid-20s where I am in my early 30s, but you can't compare yourself to others.  Change what you can and don't worry about others.  I'm actually a bit jealous that you've traveled, I've done the opposite and worked through (albeit with poor financial practices) my 20s and plan to travel in a few years (after becoming semi-FI) so the grass can be greener.  Keep your head down and be grateful you figured this out now.

Since then I've changed my life significantly - went back to school and got an MBA, put more of a focus on my career, and had some really lucky breaks along the way. Now I'm 35 and have a net worth of about $200kish.   I still feel like I have a long way to go and it's easy to look back and say ""if only I'd focused on this earlier!"" But, that way lies madness.

financialindependence,3dw7yi,IAmDanimal,3,Mon Jul 20 04:16:34 2015 UTC,"I'm of the mindset that new cars are a complete and total waste of money, and I'm sure almost everyone here agrees. But I am glad there are plenty of people out there who so generously eat that 33-50% depreciation on a 2-3 year old car.   I disagree. A new car only depreciates on paper. Depreciation only occurs when you sell at a loss. If you buy a new car and hold it for 10-15 years, the average depreciation is quite low.  If you try to buy a used car you aren't going to get the depreciated price because you'll pay dealer mark-up. The more frequently you buy a used car, the more often you pay the dealer mark-up. Thus the best way to minimize dealer costs is to buy cars as infrequently as possible, i.e. by buying new and holding as long as possible. You can imagine the worst case scenario would be to buy a fully depreciated very old car, drive it for one year, then trade it in for a car 1 year newer -- you'll just get eaten alive by dealer costs on each trade.  Buying used cars is also higher risk as you don't know what the previous owner has done to it. I've had problems with used cars before.  It may depend a lot on the car though. Honda Fits seem pretty expensive new ($22k). There are far cheaper options out there (Ford Fiesta, Fiat 500) that are like $12-13k new so you could have gotten a new car for the same price as a used Honda."
financialindependence,3dw7yi,grundar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:32:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's do the math then. Say OP buys a new car for $22k, drives 15k miles/year, and keeps the car for 12 years (180k miles). That's $1833/year.  Or, OP buys the same car (but 2 model years older, otherwise the same features and whatnot) used, with 30k miles on it for $12k. OP drives it until 180k miles, which means OP has the car for 10 years. Cost per year? $1200.   Granted, maintenance might be a little more expensive because it might not have the same warranty as the new car, but a lot of certified pre-owned cars come with a warranty of some sort. Even if it's a car with no warranty at all, you're not spending $633/year more every year for 10 years (the difference in maintenance costs only applies during the new car's warranty period anyway).  On top of that, you have to look at the opportunity cost and insurance costs. Insurance is going to be more expensive for a newer car if you want to cover more than just liability. In terms of opportunity cost, if you invest the $10k you saved by buying used, at 7% annual return you're really saving yourself an additional $700/year by buying used. Over 10 years of ownership, that's $7,000, getting you half way to your next car."
financialindependence,3dw7yi,IAmDanimal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's do the math then.   FYI, you can use cost-to-own calculators to get a good estimate including maintenance.  The last time I did this comparison using edmunds.com's TCO calculator, the 5-year all-in expected cost was only 10% lower for the used car (2009 Civic vs. 2014 Civic).  Rerunning those calculators now gives a 20% difference, so 10-20% savings over 5 years is probably about what you can expect, at the cost of more risk of car trouble."
financialindependence,3dw7yi,theskorpian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"The risk of more car trouble is already included in the maintenance numbers, but if you take of your car you'll probably do better than those numbers anyway."

financialindependence,3dw7yi,IAmDanimal,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:09:38 2015 UTC,"Well I bought a new car for $12k so I've already broken your example. 2-year-old cars of the same model were actually more expensive on average somehow. This is mainly because (1) I wanted a car without frivolous options, which had to be custom ordered from the factory, and (2) I bought at the right time to get thousands in dealer rebates, which made it a no-brainer.  I also got 0% financing which is a free lunch. I now get to drag that payment out over 5 years while focusing on high interest debt and IRAs.  Obviously if you get a shitty deal on a new car or a great deal on a used car, used car wins. but if you can get a good deal on a new car and the used car market is poor in the model you want, and your credit is good enough to get advantageous financing, then new can be an easy win. it was for me."
financialindependence,3dw7yi,ckr801,3,Mon Jul 20 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"My example was to illustrate buying the same car used vs. new, not buying a $12k car vs.. I don't really know what your point was.  That same car you bought new for $12k ($1000/year if you keep it for 12 years)? You can probably buy a similar one (a couple model years older) with 30k miles for $8k, or $800/year.   Granted, the cheaper the car you you start with, the less you save by buying used, but you still end up saving money.  And yeah, if you can't find a good deal on a used version of what you want, then a new car is probably cheaper.. but if you're buying some obscure car that you can't find used, it's probably not the best choice of car anyway (with a few exceptions) ;)"

financialindependence,3dw7yi,Internally_Combusted,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:08 2015 UTC,"You bought different cars. A car that depreciates $2k/year for 12 years cost at least $24k, which is double what I would pay for a new car. You also got lucky buying a used car and not having any problems. Used cars always come with a risk of problems, plus it was used by someone else. It's like buying a used couch that some stranger has already farted on 1000 times. No thanks.  For the car I was shopping for, new cars were actually about the same price as used cars. A large part of it was because I wanted a stick shift and zero options, none of which were available on the used market. So I saved thousands off the MSRP alone by saying no to all the options and custom ordering one from the factory. I also got another $4k off the MSRP by buying at the right time and using dealer rebates. I also got 0% financing, which lets me drag out the payments over 5 years so I can max out my investment accounts and pay down higher interest debt. It was a win all around. Buying a used car would have cost the same or more, and been used."
financialindependence,3dw7yi,frugaler,0,Mon Jul 20 14:08:39 2015 UTC,If you are buying used you have to take your time and do your research. All of the cars I buy are already 10 years old and I never pay over $8k. I should be able to get another 10 years out of them easily with just regular maintenance. I narrow down my choice to a specific model and generation (year range) that has a history of reliability. Then I search daily for a few months looking for a gem that was single owner and has all of the maintenance records. The daily search takes me about 10 minutes at work when I need a mental break. If you buy from someone who has all of the maintenance records and a 10 year old car that still looks pretty new you know it has not been abused and if it is a reliable model it should hold its own. I am also pretty handy so little repairs are usually cheap because I just need to buy the parts.
financialindependence,3dw7yi,juliusseizure,2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"I recommend going back, hopefully he still thinks you're young and stupid. Settle on a price for the used car. Record the conversation assuming that's legal in your state. Now he thinks you're young and dumb, so he gave you a reduced price hoping you'll use his financing since you're young and must have bad credit. Except you either got a preapproved loan from a credit union with a tiny interest rate, or you have the cash. Either way, it's cash to him. He'll want to up the price, that's when you get up an walk away. He knows you have the cash and he has invested time in you. You now have a cheaper car. This worked for me."

financialindependence,3dw7yi,twelvis,2,Tue Jul 21 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"To the saleperson's credit, he's kind of right about Honda's and resale - particularly when it comes to buying from a dealership, the savings on used is typically somewhat low vs. new. The real savings come from private sales on used cars. I doubt the 12k civic you're comparing to the 22k civic are the same trim - in my experience (huge car nut), a 3 year old civic EX with lower-than-average miles would probably be priced around 16-17k at a dealership. Also, the 22k you're quoting is MSRP - no one pays that much. It's probably ~20.5-21 (I haven't looked into civics in a while).  To me, personally, a 3 year old used car isn't worth saving ~17% on a car. Then again, I don't think you ever come out ahead buying a  used car from a dealership unless you find a good deal, and those aren't really to be had on civics.  Just to see if what I'm saying is accurate, here's a little googling.  Local dealer:  http://www.tomkadlec.com/used-Rochester-2012-Honda-Civic+Sdn-EX-19XFB2F85CE064382  2012 EX @ 16.2k with 40k miles (30k miles would probably push it to around 17k)  Truecar says the new cost to buy that is, on average, 20.5k.  Basically, I think you've confused two cars for trim levels that aren't the same, or you found a spectacular deal on a used EX that you should jump on. Otherwise, buying used from a dealer really isn't anything exceptional in terms of finding a deal, unless ~17% savings (17k vs. 20.5k new) is worth 30k miles of who knows what. To me, I'd probably need ~35% in savings to justify that.  Good luck  Edit : not sure how I forgot this but the 2012 year was poorly received and earned an immediate refresh in 2013. So, buying used from a dealer saves you even less, 2012 is more of a unique situation."

People driving SUVs frequently don't see me when changing lanes or don't care. I've had several near-misses with idiots driving huge Suburbans running me off the road. It has a large surface area:weight ratio, so you definitely feel the wind while driving. In high winds (>30 mph) the car easily drifts 2-3 feet with a gust. The short wheelbase and sub-par suspension ensures you will notice every single bump in the road. If you don't do a lot of highway driving, it's a great little car though.

Fixed that for you.  [EDIT]  Considering that the historical return of the S&P 500 is 10% (7% after inflation), the Trinity study, and basically every FI calculator show that 4% will be sustainable I have a hard time understanding why maintaining a 4% withdraw rate requires ""appreciating significantly"".  I mean practically every single thing out there states that a 4% withdraw rate does not require anything other than ""normal"" returns as I stated."

If you are only drawing down significantly less than 4% per year, then the safer bet is to put it into a diversified basket of high-ROI investments (equities) because low drawdown rates protect you from volatility in the short term, and high growth rates protect you in the long term."

Yeah, at that level I could afford to lose ~75 percent of my net worth without too much sweat, but I think I'd just feel better knowing that it was a much less likely event with lower-yield investments.  Basically, I think I'd only be as aggressive as I'd need to be, not as aggressive as I could be."

The problem is you're emphasizing net worth instead of income. A 75% drop in the speculative value of equities would be accompanied with closer to a 25% drop in dividends. I think you could easily survive a temporary 25% drop in dividends, especially if they're already earning $100-200k in them. If anything you should welcome a drop in valuations because it means you can reinvest your dividends at bargain prices."

I want to die with more capital than I started this world with so I can pass something on to my children. If I act selfishly and irrationally cling to the capital I already have, I will have less of a legacy and an impact. I would actually lose more sleep holding bonds than stocks because of the opportunity cost of stock returns and knowing my wealth is gradually shrinking to inflation."
financialindependence,3duq8j,ckr801,2,Mon Jul 20 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"In some ways I get that.  But I have no children, and my chief concern is dying with a million more than when I became FI.  And that's the first time I ever heard capital preservation referred to as selfish and irrational.  I'll have to have a proper think on that.  But the reality is, I am living on a fraction of what the portfolio churns out in interest and dividends.  The fraction is so low that the annual impact of inflation to my income is measured in hundreds of dollars a year, and not thousands.  I put 2/3rds of my income from dividends and interest back in the market.  I'm gonna get some growth whether I like it or not."

financialindependence,3duq8j,soupcxan,-10,Sun Jul 19 18:26:45 2015 UTC,This is generic but doesn't really answer the question. Assume an average coefficient of relative risk aversion (i.e. 2)
financialindependence,3duq8j,ckr801,5,Sun Jul 19 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"I would keep a 1-year cash emergency fund. The rest in equities. I would only live off dividends. Dividends have never fallen more than 50% from any peak. Current dividend yield is 2%. At $5M that means I can ""guarantee"" an annual dividend of $50k. Any dividends in excess of my living expenses and topping off my cash reserves would be reinvested. I would also probably include some I-bonds in my emergency fund since they are a heavily subsidized fixed income instrument that keeps pace with inflation. I would also leverage the cash value of my whole life insurance policy which could cover 5-10 years of spending. If TIPS yields were ever favorable again, I would probably purchase some of those too -- but not at the current 1.12% yield."
financialindependence,3duq8j,ckr801,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:07 2015 UTC,"The 4% SWR applies to whatever nest egg you have. It can cause a $500k sum to fail just as it can cause a $5M sum to fail, except that the guy with a $5M nest egg can probably scale down his lifestyle more easily.  However, having $5M doesn't mean you have to put everything in one bucket of risk. If you can live off of the SWR on $4M, then you might put $1M in various high-risk investments that might take you into the $10M club if it works out. That would be a middle path between your all-bonds option and your SWR on the full sum option."
financialindependence,3duq8j,fabledlamb,2,Mon Jul 20 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"I doubt many on this board have a net worth of $5m+ (yet), so I figure that most responses are going to be theoretical.  My current plan is to aim for $3m and live off a 3% SWR.  When I hit 'the number' (cue angelic chorus) my plan is to shift to 50% equities and 50% bonds.  Because I will be holding all of my bonds in the TSP's G Fund, I run zero risk of loss of principal for my bonds, with guaranteed return of (hopefully) 2-3+%.  This leaves stocks as the only area where I can experience losses, which significantly reduces my overall risk.    Going 100% bonds is disadvantageous because a) I would like to have my investments continue to grow to plan for inheritances and unexpected expenses, b) inflation will require continued asset growth beyond that provided by bonds, and c) going all bonds, even all G Fund, is massive single-sector risk.    Those who go 100% stock for retirement either have balls of steel or a guaranteed income beyond that provided by their investments (Social Security, pension, rental property, business, etc)."

I'm about 75% equities, no bonds, but some fixed income-like things through work and 5% cash.  On the other hand, I can easily cut my $150K lifestyle in half. Well, it might take a couple of years to wind stuff down, but I can still be quite comfortable on $75K if I need to cut back.

The best way to preserve capital is to grow it. If you have a draw down rate of less than 4%, you rationally should be 90% or 100% equities: the base capital grows faster and builds up a buffer against economic catastrophe."
financialindependence,3duq8j,maaku7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:55 2015 UTC,you could be in low risk a rated 3.5% muni bonds and make almost 5% after the tax shield-- and do this reliably without volatility of equities. I don't think this analysis falling apart
financialindependence,3duq8j,setthetrap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"Until we get the next municipality crisis where whatever counties you are investing in default, and you take a haircut on the principle.  There are two things that help you to preserve capital: (1) putting it to work to generate the same income you are drawing down, and (2) growing it such that there is more of a buffer against volatility.  Sure you can invest in muni bonds with a return approximately equal to your drawdown rate. But that does leave you with unhedged catastrophic risks lingering about. Or you can invest in equities with higher (8-11%) returns and only draw down the same amount. You start with the same risk profile, but in the event of a catastrophic event not happening in year 1 or year 2 you build up further protections by growth, making it a strictly superior option.  The bond allocation traditional wisdom comes from a perspective where non-FI retirement is the norm. You've saved enough funds to last you 20 years, and putting them in safe bets like muni bonds are the best way to make sure you meet that 20-year target given that you are drawing down funds faster than they can grow.  But in the case of FI where your capital preservation timeline is infinity, the volatility concerns are less of a concern than the eventual, inevitable major catastrophe, the probability of which approaches 100% as you extend the time horizon. Protecting against that requires growth."

I spend approximately $500/mo on assuring that me or my family of 4 have access to cryonic preservation in the event of medical death or terminal illness.  It's a bit high, even by the industry standards. A young single healthy person can get equivalent coverage for about $75/mo. But that's the cost of starting late, being rated as slightly unhealthy, and being conservative about my level of coverage :\  I do think everyone should be signed up for cryonics. People might get sticker shock at how much I pay, but the benefit (not dying) is worth it. It's the ultimate hedge."

Describing the benefit as ""not dying"" seems a bit misleading to me. It's more like ""having a non-zero chance of being revived after you die at an unknown time in the future"", isn't it?"
financialindependence,3dvcha,binger5,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"Well you can never have 100% assurances. I could die in a plane crash or horrible fire tomorrow, or fall off a cliff while hiking and not have my body discovered for weeks. In either case my brain would be sufficiently damaged by trauma, fire, or decomposition that cryo-preservation is unlikely to accomplish anything.  You can have 0% assurance of survival though: that's what happens to all the people who don't arrange for cryonic services. If you die tomorrow and are buried or cremated, you are 100% dead. Worm food, pushing up daisies. No chance of revival. I'll take a non-zero chance of survival over that, thank you.  As to being misleading, I don't think it is. There's a couple of points on that.  First of all it's the same sense in which I can say ""Sky diving? Solo diving? No thanks, I prefer not dying!"" and then get hit by a bus crossing the street. Nothing is guaranteed on the survival side, so the best we can do is minimize probabilities of bad outcomes.  Second, the key thing to understand about cryo preservation is that you are not dead in the process. Medically dead, yes, but that's legal gymnastics. One of the first things they pump in your body when they start the cryo preservation is high levels of sedatives. Why? Because patients had a tendency to wake up in the process, which is unsettling for everyone involved, especially the patient. Cryo preservation is basically a very, very deep hibernation where they slow your biochemistry down to such a low rate that only a few relative seconds go by over the decades or centuries of preservation. Biologically speaking you're not any more dead than the drowning victim whose breathing and heart stopped momentarily until CPR was applied.  So yes, I think ""not dying"" is accurate and not at all misleading. And I genuinely prefer no one else to die either, so I urge everyone to sign up for cryonics."
financialindependence,3dvcha,alwaysdrawing,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"Assuming tech improves and medical practices allow those preserved to be brought back fully functional, why would the company do it? It's far more financially sound to take your money now, make the promise, and never deliver. Plus, if you're legally dead, your estate and everything will be gone if you were to return, so it would be a drain on whatever government is in power at the time. That power would likely discourage or ban bringing people back. Events, knowledge, and everything else has moved on from your existence, where's the draw in wanting to come back? (Honestly asking)"
financialindependence,3dvcha,moosemc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"Fair question.  So first of all, all of the cryonic suspension organizations are member-run non-profits with prominent community members on their boards. So the first and foremost answer is that the scenario doesn't make sense -- the suspension organization isn't turning a profit off you.  The more in-depth answer is that your suspension contract doesn't exist in a vacuum. There will be lots of other people being suspended and revived on a continuous basis. Indeed the expectation is that even once the technology exists to revive patients, there will still be some being put into suspension at the same time -- people dying of diseases that are just not fixable at the time. One should expect that the first people to be revived would be those most recently put into suspension, as they were suspended with the latest and greatest technology and most up-to-date knowledge. So to complete our scenario it will be the most recently suspended who are revived first, and they will presumably still have people they left behind advocating for them, and they will advocate for those they know who passed a little earlier, etc. etc. In short, it is a very unlikely scenario that there will be absolutely no one still alive who cares about anyone left in suspension, and each person revived increases the pool of people who care about those still left.  Finally on that question, although the current situation is such that you must be declared legally dead in order to be put in cryonic suspension, that is not the ideal situation and just about everyone in the cryonics space would like to see that changed. As cryonics becomes more mainstream, one can hope that (and there will be lobbying for) a law will be passed making cryonics a valid medical procedure for use as a last resort to stave off death, making new cryonic suspensions still-living medical patients, legally speaking, rather than vitrified corpses as they are now. That would introduce regulation to cryonics, and legal protections to cryonic patients.  Next point: many cryonics patients have trust funds setup payable to themselves in the future, either as part of their estate or funded through life insurance. I don't know the exact details of how these are setup, honestly, as it is still on my list of things to do. So the expected outcome, assuming no global catastrophe or Mad Max scenario, is not waking up to find youself on welfare, but rather reclaiming a portfolio of index funds that has been growing for 50+ years.  As to your last question, I don't give a flying fuck if the world has moved on, when the alternative is permanent oblivion. I'd rather live in that world than be dead."

financialindependence,3durug,moosemc,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you're most likely to fail because you either had bad market returns in early retirement or you spent too much in early retirement.  I know several 70+ year old couples who travel extensively. I might agree with you for over 80, since I don't run into many of them when I travel.  Personally, I prefer the more conservative way of planning to more or less keep withdrawals constant (after inflation) throughout retirement. You have to remember that you only get one shot at retirement. Averages are interesting, but you will only get one scenario. If it turns out to be a bad scenario, you will be very glad you were conservative when you were younger. If it's a good scenario, then hopefully you aren't too disappointed with your lifestyle in early retirement."

Dividends will grow with inflation and throttle you off when earnings are low telling you to be frugal when appropriate.

financialindependence,3durug,ckr801,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:37 2015 UTC,I'm aiming for the 4%/25 times income as a starting point. I do aim to adjust in the first few years if the market goes sharply down.  I don't want to do the dividend thing because then I would need a lot more and I want to play it safe but also FI early-ish.  I am currently already abut 25% into my house so no REIT for me to keep diversification; maybe when I eventually sell.  As for emergency fund I would be 10-15% into bonds/cash that I can sell anytime I need money. The aim would be to withdraw up to 4%/year but leaving myself the option to maybe get 3% one tear and 5% the next for a big trip/expense.  The one thing I am not sure about is how to distribute this. There is only one method on fireplace that looks like what I want but may not be exactly what I want.
financialindependence,3durug,ckr801,-7,Sun Jul 19 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with a rigid 4% drawdown rule is that you will have to dip into capital when dividends aren't enough. Also if the long-run return of the stock market shifts downward, 4% might go bankrupt while living off dividends guarantees some preservation of capital as the cut in dividends forces you to live more frugally in honest recognition of lower returns. Dividends don't lie. ""Capital gains are speculation; cash is king."" - John Bogle  You can actually get to 4% by using a combination of dividend and growth stock. PFF for instance yielded a steady 6% over the past decade, despite recessions, though with no growth. A combination of something like PFF with total market stock would give you a 4% drawdown but without running risk of liquidating capital at a loss because markets are down. You want to avoid routine sale of stock in retirement because now DCA is working against you. It's better to just buy high-yield assets and hold them forever while living off their dividends. This is the least risky. It's also the simplest in terms of cash flow management.  Your house isn't paying you cash dividends. It's just saving you from paying rent. It is simplest to just remove it from the equation altogether. There's nothing wrong with investing in REITs outside your house for additional cash flows. It can add some stability to your dividends which is what matter. The purpose of owning a house to live in and owning REITs for income are orthogonal.

Just because you don't have to work for money to survive, doesn't mean you can't.  My wife's very fiscally conservative.  Too very.  I must build up a dividend stream from bonds which meet her retirement income target before she will retire.  I'll be long retired by then, from also using stock gains and dividends, and a lower/saner income target.  I'm using 4% for both our planning numbers;  she'll be living off only dividends, I'll be living off mostly dividends with a little draw from capital if I can't flex enough."

I do not follow dividend mantra. I do not believe in only holding dividend stocks and reinvesting dividends as the primary source of growth.   I believe in holding the total stock market index, perhaps supplementing it with REITs or preferred dividend stocks if one needs higher yields (but knowing it may reduce growth), and then only living off the cash dividends. This way you never tap into capital. As warren buffet says, ""focus on what things earn, not what they're worth"" and ""only buy investments if you would happy if it was never quoted again"". In other words, don't rely on capital gains for income, since they are speculative and can vanish as soon as a bear market strikes."

Once you got to a certain typing speed you would be typing too fast that the computer was behind and would say you were making all kinds of errors. Those were the days.

financialindependence,3ds9qd,tuneorg,47,Sun Jul 19 19:28:03 2015 UTC,"Or we may reach a point of diminishing returns.  Technology seems to advance in spurts. Airplanes went through incredible advances between 1914 and 1940, but the 747 is more or less the same as it was in 1969 (other than much improved engines and electronics). Combustion engines similarly went through massive improvements in the first few decades of the 1900s, but today improvement is very slow, incremental and expensive. Electronics and software have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past few decades, but I think it's quite possible we will reach a sort of plateau at some point. It's not even that Moore's law will eventually end (although it will), it's that processing capacity and speed will at some point cease to be the limiting factor in how useful a computer is."
financialindependence,3ds9qd,Albertican,5,Sun Jul 19 02:44:04 2015 UTC,"Moore's law is not a law, it's an observation that has high correlation with reality for the last 40 years that is used as justification for chip R&D by Intel, IBM and ARM to their shareholders.  I would imagine that by 2025 we'll start to see quantum computing have a demonstrable effect on computing, at which point all bets are off on a ton of factors (including cryptography and e-commerce), but we will see an incredible change in how we perceive ""computing performance"", and it is going to be bizarre: we will not recognise the society of 2050 compared to today, and we can't anticipate how."

My Dell work laptop still takes like 2 minutes to boot up, which is about how long I recall my home PC booting up in 1995. The only difference is it doesn't crash nearly as often.  I also build enterprise software for a living, and we have screens that take 2, 3, sometimes 10 seconds to load. I try to improve performance where I can (as a developer) but there seem to be some limit to what I can do because the backend system takes forever to respond, so cutting my module down to 5 ms doesn't matter when the system I'm communicating with takes 5 seconds. This is worse than I remember in 1995.  So how come despite Moore's law, I have noticed virtually no improvement in performance?"

It's pretty to look at, contains dynamic context-sensitive interfaces, suggestions, and user help. It continuously monitors for all sorts of changes of state that were never important in 1995. It uses huge numbers of ongoing processor threads and memory to manage all this, hence the startup times.  Another issue is that, as processor capability has outstripped our processing needs, software developers have a) done less and less optimization of code, and b) used ever more abstracted languages to build applications. Both of these eat up performance gains. I mean, why optimize your code when every machine that will run it is at least 60x faster than needed to run optimized code?"

The problem is now we're at a state where some applications take up to 10 seconds to respond to a user's input. I develop software so I would know. The real problem is the competence of software developers has plummeted. The young kids coming in from college these days have no idea how to optimize or write efficient algorithms. For example, they will often write iterable functions that repeat the same complex operation each time, rather than performing it once and passing the result to each instance. The result it they write algorithms that take 10-1000x longer to execute than they need to. Then managers complain ""why is this so slow?"" and give it to me to fix it, since I am apparently the only one on a team of 12 people who know how to basic optimization."

The low hanging fruit has been picked, improvements now are difficult, slow and underwhelming.

Now think of all the things you have to do and time you need to waste to just board. The airplane as a mode of transportation has indeed became unnecessarily complicated and complaining about the lack of efficiency doesn't mean I don't appreciate the ability to be up in the air.

financialindependence,3ds9qd,PuffinTheMuffin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"Right I think the greater point is that we as consumers can easily imagine how much better things would be if the humans operating them weren't so incompetent. Air travel doesn't need to be as onerous as it is today but the people running the show make it miserable, sometimes on purpose so they can charge a premium for first-class tickets to avoid the pain. There's nothing more frustrating than knowing something should be easily possible but it's not because some idiot ruined it.  There's a difference between driving 45mph because your car physically cannot go faster and driving 45mph because the police will ticket you if you go faster. The latter is infinitely more annoying because it feels arbitrarily and artificial, self-imposed by humanity."
financialindependence,3ds9qd,ckr801,5,Sun Jul 19 03:53:21 2015 UTC,"I really disagree with that.  Airlines aren't making flights more uncomfortable because they are exploiting passengers.  It's because the only thing 99% of people care about is the cost of the ticket.  The food service and comfort has declined since the heyday of jetsetting, but there is daily direct service to almost anywhere in the world and it's significantly cheaper than it's ever been.  It's an incredibly competitive and difficult industry and does not tolerate incompetence."
financialindependence,3ds9qd,JohnHenryAaron,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"Then why does it take an hour to check in and go through security? It didn't use to until 9/11 and the government increased security regulation.   Why do they board planes front-to-back? Studies have shown that this is the most inefficient way to board a plane, dominated even by ""random boarding"", yet airlines do it to make people in later boarding groups wait longer so they suffer more. More on this later.  Why do they make the seats so small? A lot of people would pay 5%  more for their ticket for 5% more legroom. Instead you have to pay 1000% more for 20% more legroom. The reason they do this is basic price discrimination: they make economy experience so miserable that people with the ability to pay will pay first-class just to avoid the misery. There are reams and reams of research done on price discrimination, with airlines as one of the prime examples.  There's also very little competition in the airline industry due to barriers to entry and cartelization. This breeds incompetence. Couple that with regulation preventing innovation makes a miserable experience."
financialindependence,3ds9qd,ckr801,3,Sun Jul 19 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"Price discrimination doesn't imply the manipulation you claim.  Price discrimination existed 50 years ago, too, and the same trend of making seats smaller and packing more people in happens on budget airlines that do not offer first-class service.      All you have to do is look at the historic trends for airline prices.  Competition and deregulation has caused a steady decline in rates for decades.  It's a less pleasant experience than it used to be, for sure, but prices are also much cheaper."
financialindependence,3ds9qd,JohnHenryAaron,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming price discrimination didn't exist 50 years ago -- it has existed as long as capitalism has existed. But price discrimination is still responsible for a lot of the misery modern airline passengers go through, unnecessarily so because lack of competition tends to foster price discrimination. Price discrimination doesn't survive when a competing supplier can just undercut you and provide the goods."
financialindependence,3ds9qd,ckr801,5,Sun Jul 19 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"As advertised would be a plane departing at the time stated when you bought the ticket.

Now up to 25% of pre-tax as investments per year. I did all of my math in current-value-dollars (no inflation), assuming 7% RoR, and a 2% annual salary growth, with a 1% annual spending increase. My models show both 3% and 4% drawdowns at the end - the difference is only a year or so, really.   It still takes me 25 or so years to hit FIRE. I changed the math to assume 30% pre-tax as savings, living on only 70% - still roughly the same. It seems that unless something /fundamental/ changes, I'm working for about 23-25 years. Does this sound ""about right""? Are there any likely hiccoughs I'm missing?  Am I breaking any major FIRE rules in this model?  Is it appropriate to post all of this in more detail as a full thread?"
financialindependence,3dtp24,Tairc,7,Sun Jul 19 12:16:04 2015 UTC,What are you spending 75% of your income on?
financialindependence,3dtp24,CJ-Johnson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:19:42 2015 UTC,"Taxes, rent, in that order. Single filer.    Then, living not that badly at all. Still, going from 25% to 35% doesn't seem like it dramatically accelerates things, which I found surprising."
financialindependence,3dtp24,Tairc,2,Sun Jul 19 18:21:19 2015 UTC,It doesnt do much because it isnt  that big of a change. What's stopping you from saving 50%+
financialindependence,3dtp24,CJ-Johnson,3,Sun Jul 19 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"Specially as they cite taxes as the most expensive item, it might be easy to increase saving levels (as the tax burden lowers)"
financialindependence,3dtp24,--int,7,Sun Jul 19 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"That seems like a reasonable conclusion given your parameters.  Think of it this way: at a 25% (post tax) savings rate, you only save one year of expenses for every 3 working years.  At 50% you save one year for each working year.  At 75%, you save 3 years for each working year.  On average you'll need about 25-30 years of expenses for FI.  Investment returns help some, especially in a longer accumulation period, but most of it will need to be accumulated by working."
financialindependence,3dtp24,elindbe2,10,Sun Jul 19 12:50:20 2015 UTC,The main thing making that number so high is that you are spending 70% of 135k.
financialindependence,3dtp24,fyoumoney,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, take home is probably like $100k (give or take) and then OP is saving something like $30-35k, so living on about $5k-6k / month. Depending on location, home ownership, family status, lifestyle, etc, that's not insane.  I would focus on cutting that for sure, but there's a lot more upper room for income growth than there is room to cut expenses."

financialindependence,3dtp24,fyoumoney,3,Sun Jul 19 20:00:23 2015 UTC,"7% real return might be too high because stock valuations are higher than historical norms which means expected returns must be lower than historical norms barring some major structural change in earnings growth. The 7% real return comes from a PE of about 16. Our PE10 is 27 right now which means you can more realistically expect a 4% return, perhaps even less if PE falls at the endpoint. I like to be conservative in my models.  Also what is your goal in retirement? To preserve capital or spend it all until you die? If you have children and want to preserve capital you should aim for a 2% drawdown rate. My personal strategy is take whatever dividends the market gives me (2%), spend those, and never liquidate capital. This gives me a good balance of growth + spending."
financialindependence,3dtp24,ckr801,2,Sun Jul 19 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with the gist of your first paragraph, but just want to point out that you switched back and forth between the PE and PE10. That makes quite a difference when you have a period of depressed earnings during the PE10's lookback period."
financialindependence,3dtp24,schwanzenator,2,Sun Jul 19 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"What's your tax burden?  You're getting a lot of feedback to save more of your income but if your pretax is $135k then you are probably paying close to 30% in taxes (federal plus state, assuming you're in a state with income tax).  What do you think you'll need to have as a retirement income when you aren't working?  That's the other big knob to turn, get your ongoing expenses lower and your nest egg doesn't need to be as large."
financialindependence,3dtp24,Engineerchic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"You're correct - it's 25% to Vanguard, and another nearly 30% as a single male, leaving me sub 70K (ballpark here, nothing precise), plus another 1.4K per month on rent, and so on.

Half a packet (1k kcals) keeps me full from breakfast around 5am till I get home from work around 5pm which keeps me out of the vending machines at work or keeps me from ordering subway/jimmy johns deliver at 6-7$ each as well as well as keeps me from stopping at McDonalds on the way to work. Yeah it costs me more than I could cook for myself but it saves assloads of time which actually keeps me from ordering fast food options that cost way more.

financialindependence,3dtp24,ryanmercer,8,Mon Jul 20 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"I think so many people here are:  1) neglecting to account for inflation during the accumulation phase. If you want to retire on $1 million in 2035, that will get you $40k in 2035 dollars or about $21k in 2015 dollars. The 4% rule only accounts for post-withdrawal inflation.  2) severely underestimating healthcare costs in old age. Retiring on $10k/year, seriously? Sources abound here."
financialindependence,3dtp24,rowsforthebros,7,Sun Jul 19 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"We usually speak in real dollars on this subreddit. When someone says they want to retire on $1 million, they are saying they want to retire on $1 million in 2015 dollars. What that will be in nominal dollars in the future is hard to know exactly, and is not really an important part of the analysis."
financialindependence,3dtp24,schwanzenator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"In response to your first point: it's a fair assumption that your salary will rise quicker than inflation during your accumulation phase. Peak income generally occurs around middle age. I hope to retire at that point.   Also, many people here think in terms of real vs nominal value.  As for your second point I think it's fairly difficult to estimate how much healthcare will cost decades from now. However, personally I lean toward saving more to have a larger margin of error for expenses like this."
financialindependence,3dtp24,ChronicElectronic,2,Sun Jul 19 20:04:01 2015 UTC,"Salary definitely increases over time. It should be modeled seperately, along with expenses (and their growth) and asset growth (depending on returns) to ""snowball"" into a lump sum. I posted a spreadsheet here a few months ago.  https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/33388h/financial_independence_budget_savings_snowball/  I phrased my point the way I did for a reason. If you are thinking in terms of a lump sum -> 4% withdrawal, be sure to remember that you need to remember to include inflation when determining your lump sum/withdrawal needed. Aka if you want to retire on $40k 2015 dollars then you need $1m 2015 dollars or $2m 2035 dollars if you are retiring then. Yes, your salary will increase, but you need to hit that higher number.  I agree with you that healthcare expenses will continue to rise. But they are also already insane."
financialindependence,3dtp24,rowsforthebros,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:21:57 2015 UTC,I guess I just haven't seen too many people neglect to consider inflation of expenses. Personally I'm not currently worrying about forecasting and modeling for now. I'm just focusing on getting my savings rate higher.

However I started a new gig a couple months ago, and haven't really been a fan -- not really feeling the company culture.  Although, to put things in perspective, I know a decent number of people don't even have a concept of ""company culture,"" so it's a pretty awesome/privileged position to be in to ""not be feeling the company culture.""  My only complaint about being an SWE in general is how damn mentally draining it can be most days. As someone who aspires to be a writer one day, it sucks to come home most days with no mental energy left over to read/write.  East coast is cool. I've lived here my whole life and have never been to the west coast, so I don't really have a comparison.

A nice 1bdrm in NJ is going to run you 1 - 1.2k, whereas in NYC (Brooklyn) it's going to be 1.8k - 2k.  So yeah, housing is twice as much, but so is the salary.

But it still takes 20 mins to bike, plus another 7 once I arrive to clean myself up (I'm very thorough), plus another 3 beforehand to pack clothes and mentally prepare myself (since I really don't like bike commuting), so I find I have to get up at the same time anyways.

financialindependence,3dtp24,hutacars,3,Sun Jul 19 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"How do I eliminate my desire to spend money on clothes, eating out, and traveling for vacation? I'm struggling myself with these things, but my wife is 10x worse. She says she doesn't want to deprive herself during her 20s just to become wealthy faster, since at our current pace we are already set to be FIRE by 50 which is ""good enough"" for her but I want to be FI by 40-45 so if we RE at 50 we will have a higher quality of life. She says living while young is more important because we'll be ""too old to enjoy life or travel as much"" which I disagree with -- I think life can be appreciated just as much whether old or young, and that money is the major limiting factor so I would rather be rich while old by being slightly frugal while young than to just live ""ok"" while young and old."
financialindependence,3dtp24,ckr801,5,Sun Jul 19 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"I think the main idea to stress is that you're not ""depriving"" yourself. You're not slowing down your spending in order to live like a hermit and do nothing, you're working towards a life in which spending money is not the only source of enjoyment or happiness. You don't have to save 85% of your money and live on rice and beans, but the opposite is also not ideal. If your wife thinks that buying a bunch of clothes and eating out should be daily occurrences, then that might be something to talk about.    However, I must side with her on the travel aspect of things; that is one area that I would not put off, and I do think that doing it while you're young is different than when you are old. I wouldn't drop 15k on a week long trip to France, but I also wouldn't pass up a few weeks in Thailand in order to reach RE a few months earlier! I think travel provides some very important life lessons, and is a valuable education I would like to get while I'm still young.    A final point, and potential argument you might make: You said you guys are in your 20's, and your wife wants to live while she's 'young.' I think it's kind of funny that she regards 40 years old as too old to live well and have adventures. If the two of you retire ten years earlier than 50, that leaves you with some of the best years of your life to travel, do awesome things, and also not have to worry about taking time from your job or away from your lives.    You'll probably have to find a middle ground, but I think if you sit down with your wife and reframe RE as something other than the classic idea of retirement, you might have some success. Good luck!"

financialindependence,3dtp24,l_2_the_n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:35:45 2015 UTC,I got a masters in CS from the same school I got my BS. It took me one year because my school had a BS/MS program. I work at a Big Four software engineering company now and it gave me a small increase in signing bonus and an even smaller increase in salary.   My main motivation for doing it was that I didn't feel fully ready yet to start working full time at 21 and also it allowed me to save up more internship money which I then was able to use to take 6 weeks to travel in the summer after the MS before starting work. I'm sure the extra classes helped me a bit at skill level but nothing crazy. It was probably more beneficial to have the extra time of growing up and gaining experiences like travel. It's pretty hard to take a decent length trip once you pull the trigger on working full time.   This might not be too helpful but if I were you I would focus less on the numbers and more on what you want to do. Salaries in CS are crazy high right now and you have a lot of years ahead of you making that high income. It's probably a drop in the bucket financially whichever option you choose.

But if you have any ambition beyond that, the MS might help. Grad degrees help you get to management positions and specialist jobs.  And really, FI isn't a race like some people make it out to be. Sure, you can brag on this subreddit (if it still exists) if you retire slightly earlier than the rest of us, but that's a silly reason to make major life decisions. 10-20 years is a long-assed time and you should spend it focused on your career, instead of coasting until some FI date.

financialindependence,3dut6p,Logic_now,4,Sun Jul 19 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"There are several ways to access the money before 59.5.  Roth conversion ladders and equal substantial withdraws.

Even if you have to withdraw early and pay the 10% penalty, you will be paying a lower total tax unless you start exceeding 37K/yr (where the 15% tax bracket ends).  With progressive taxes the penalty + lower tax brackets don't end up with the same total tax cost.    Finally, if you are realistic, some money saved will be after tax and your lifestyle won't put you in the higher tax brackets.  Also, 401K's are protected from many lawsuits, bankruptcy, etc."

Per the mentioned chart (available through the FAQ here), that takes a 45% savings rate to ""charge up the battery"".  You look to be a little bit under that.  If you divert a large chunk of it into a house and its extra expenses instead, well, you're not going to hit that target.  ""Realistic"" doesn't apply here so much as ""realizable"".  $2600/mo with all expenses including a house can be done, while continuing to invest at that $2300/month level.  It's just not usually done conventionally.  Find ways to increase your income while raising your savings rate.  One buddy found and fixed up a cheap fixer-upper;  another found four in sequence, lived in the most recent one, and rented the fixed ones out.  Another built and sold two small businesses;  yet another built his own home around construction demolition finds and supplier discounted materials;  yet a fifth works remotely from his RV;  yet a sixth changed careers and doubled his income while keeping expenses unchanged (raised savings rate to ~70%).

financialindependence,3dum6o,TheReverendBill,17,Sun Jul 19 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"I tend not to plan on the United States of America collapsing into an anarchic post apocalyptic wasteland within my lifetime.  I pretty much plan on the U.S. continuing to be a relatively prosperous nation in a world with a lot of other prosperous nations.  At some point, Social Security will change, since it's not quite sustainable over the long run in its current form.  I don't claim to know exactly how it might change, since there are a lot of policy options on the table depending on the politicians in charge when such changes are made.  The FICA tax could go up, the wage cap could be raised, the minimum retirement age could be raised a couple years, benefits could be trimmed or made slightly more progressive, etc.  But I think it's a fairly safe assumption that most people can count on at least ~75% of current benefits, since that's what's going to happen around 2030 if there are no absolutely no changes and we just let the Social Security Trust Fund go bankrupt - at that point, SS will only be able to pay out what it takes in each year.  Presumably, any intentional changes to the system will be made to lessen that hit by raising taxes in some way to cover the shortfall, not make the problem worse.  To be fair, there's also a possibility that people with large incomes in retirement might face a bigger hit from policy changes, if there's a decision made to make benefits more progressive (by, say, subjecting more of SS benefits to income taxes and then raising income taxes, or some other clever way of ""means testing"" benefits).  But I don't think it's realistic to expect politicians to go full hog and turn SS into a welfare program that only benefits seniors in abject poverty, because then it would lose popularity among the middle class.  So maybe, absolute worst case, if you're very young now and plan on drawing a significant taxable income in retirement, plan on receiving ~60% of currently projected benefits.  But I think there's a damn good chance benefits will be better than that."

If anything, most of the pain would be delayed as far as possible down to generations not yet born.    It's not like this is unprecedented.  That's exactly what happened the last time Social Security went bankrupt, back in 1983 - the SS tax was raised, the retirement age was gradually raised, and a lot of workers who were previously exempt from SS were forced into the program (and to therefore pay FICA taxes).  All of those reforms hit future generations much more than anyone within a few years of retirement.  I get conservative projections, and I feel like I gave both a conservative projection (~75%) and a worst case projection (~60%).  At a certain point it stops being prudent planning and turns into a paranoid delusion about the country collapsing and, ""the govt is out to git me."""
financialindependence,3dum6o,MrWookieMustache,2,Mon Jul 20 11:05:41 2015 UTC,"No im not predicting anything like that. Im just saying once it actually goes bankrupt is when they will make a change and who knows what that will be.  They might allocate it based on assets like other things, which would kill FIers chances of receiving. Once they would be forced to cut benefits they may easily say anyone over 500k net worth gets nothing or a diminishing amount based on assets. We just dont know.   Im not saying anyone is out to get anyone. But there is one thing they are out to get and thats votes. And if they can keep benefits for 90% of voters while cutting it for some higher net worth individuals then I have no doubt that they would."
financialindependence,3dum6o,ScriptPro,3,Mon Jul 20 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"Annual means-testing based on wealth would be needlessly complex with a lot of book-keeping and unprecedented; after all, the only federal wealth tax right now is the estate tax, which only happens once in a person's lifetime and requires a lot documentation and court actions to sort out.    We already have a form of means-testing in place by applying income tax to Social Security benefits if you earn too much - it would be much simpler, and more politically feasible, to expand that form of means testing based on taxing year-to-year income rather than set up anything based on wealth.  In the end, I think completely discounting something like Social Security is a pretty extremist position that would require many years of work that just aren't necessary.  Think of it this way:  If you're a high earner, let's say current projections say you'll receive benefits of about $25,000/year.  To be super, super conservative, let's say benefits are cut in some way around 2030 to 60%, so instead you only receive $15,000/year.  That's the equivalent of $375,000, using the 4% rule, but since we're already being super conservative, let's use the 3% rule - so $500,000.  That's $500k EXTRA that you would have to save on top of what you were already planning in order to be FI if you think SS gets cut entirely, instead of (only) being cut down to 60%.  I don't know about you, but to me, saving an extra $500k would mean working for several extra years.  Considering the extremely small chance of Social Security benefits being cut that far, I just don't think it's worth trading that much of my life for such a small risk."
financialindependence,3dum6o,MrWookieMustache,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I think you're right about it being slim of being cut to zero but I still want to plan on being able to survive just fine without it.

The only time you would need the extra 500k is if your plan is only livable with social security and you couldn't meet expenses without it

I still wouldn't count on no changes for those in their 40s and 50s.    If nothing else, I'm expecting even current and near retirees to be impacted by a reduced cost of living adjustment (COLA).  It won't seem like much the first few years, but after a couple of decades, even a 0.5% reduction in COLA results in 10% lower payments.    The system has a 25% shortfall to make up, and it won't all be met with higher taxes and reduced earnings for the young.  It's prudent to plan for lower lifetime earnings than the Social Security estimator currently projects for you."

You can buy your own health insurance, the premiums will just be higher to reflect the fact that you are a higher risk. Making the government pay your premiums just passes the cost on to taxpayers -- it doesn't actually make it less expensive -- it actually makes it more expensive because of tax inefficiencies. You can also opt-out of the insurance racket altogether and self-insure with wealth.  Nearly every government program has a negative rate of return. Almost everyone would be better off not having the program, and just saving and investing the difference in taxes. These programs actually just function as subtle redistribution programs, to expropriate capital from the rich to give to the poor."

Medicare is way more efficient than private health care plans.   For example, Medicare overhead is 1-2% while for private plans are typically 20%.    And in other countries the efficiencies of government plans are even higher.   Americans pay twice as much per capita as other industrialized countries do for health care even though we have slightly worse health statistics."

Don't trust accounting figures you read. A lot of people with an axe to grind will say whatever they can to make government programs look better than they really are.  Also the overhead of private plans is distorted thanks to your friend the government. In a competitive free market for health care it is unlikely profit margins of 20% could be sustained in competitive equilibrium. The reason margins are that high is because of regulation preventing true competition.

In fact it would be people here, more than any other segment of Americans, who would get screwed the most.  Most people don't have $500k to spend on a hospital bill, and so would get to ignore it.

financialindependence,3dum6o,oscarboom,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there is a lack of competition in providing health care which is why bills are marked up 10x what they should be in a competitive free market. So looking at prices of the status quo, where no competition exists, is misleading.  If there was a free market bills would be 10x lower and then people would just need to own catastrophic insurance that caps annual out-of-pocket expenses to the person's deductible. That is the true purpose of insurance. The idea of insurance paying for every little expense is not how insurance is supposed to work. That's why your auto insurance only covers your car if it gets totaled or damaged exceeding $x -- it doesn't cover routine oil changes and maintenance.  I know it is difficult to imagine how a free market in health care would operate since we've never had one, but it helps to look at other insurance industries work and to have a solid understanding of economics and markets."

And my kids will also get an instant 15.3% on any of their earnings.  Probably not a bad deal for our family personally since we won't really need SS.    That said, I usually model SS at age 67 under the current rules.  They could shift the full retirement age to 68 or 70 and fix a lot of the currently forecasted SS shortfalls.    If the ACA went the way of the dodo, we would have to scrutinize our current early retirement a lot closer.

I'd be able to survive without it, though without it and without SS would be a big lifestyle hit.

You're under the limit for roth IRA contributions.  What /u/FreyasSpirit is talking about is if you're over the limit for roth IRA. If you need tax sheltered accounts then, you do a backdoor roth IRA. That is where you contribute to a traditional IRA, but do not take the tax deduction. Then, roll it over to roth IRA. There are limitations, but if you do it right, you don't have to pay any additional tax, and it's the same effect (roughly) as a roth IRA.  Personally, I did the backdoor roth IRA. It makes your taxes complicated, and I do not think it is worth it. The plus side: Your growth can be withdrawn tax free after you are 65 (or maybe 59?). But you cannot withdraw the principal until after 5 tax years.  With a taxable account, it's not difficult for tax filing. I can withdraw any amount I want, whenever. I do have to pay capital gains taxes on it, but that's 0% if I stay within the 15% marginal tax limit. Obviously, that last one can change, but for now, the flexibility is worth it to me."

The only wrinkle I see comes from here:  http://www.fairmark.com/college/saving/coverdell/estate.htm    Yet a change in beneficiary to someone in a generation below the generation of the current beneficiary is treated as a gift by the current beneficiary...When a contribution to a Coverdell account exceeds the annual exclusion amount, the donor can elect to spread the gift tax treatment over five years. This rule has no significance for regular contributions to Coverdell accounts because the $2,000 maximum is smaller than the annual gift tax exclusion. It's possible this rule will apply when a change in beneficiary results in a gift of a Coverdell account that has grown to a value greater than the annual exclusion amount, but we'll need further guidance from the IRS before we're certain the rule applies in this situation.   TL;DR If you roll the money down a generation you have to do it $14,000 at a time or be comfortable with that language about ""spread(ing) the gift tax treatment over five years"""

Another minor issue might be ""Only one rollover per Coverdell ESA is allowed during the 12-month period ending on the date of the payment or distribution."" IRS.    So I think that might mean only one incoming rollover (to your child) per year.  Although that could also mean one per source ESA, in which case you could rollover all five in one year because you're only rolling over each of the five once."

I don't see any limitation on how many times the beneficiary can be changed per year, but it is treated as a gift from the old beneficiary to the new, so you'd have to be careful when passing it down a generation."

You say ""school isn't me"", but all you've experienced is high school. American high schools appear to be a cross between prisons and a particularly existentialist type of Hell. You may find that you enjoy college a lot more. Don't make fixed plans before you've tried it.   1a. College contains a lot more hot, single females than any tech company in the world.    Employers do care about degrees, but experience does tend to outweigh that. I would expect, and my advice is of course worth its weight in gold, that a year or two of working at a big tech company will be equivalent to a degree in terms of getting future jobs. You haven't passed that phone screen yet, much less the onsite. It is possible that you're in for a shock.

He thought about it a bunch, then decided to go back to school. He was an intern again the following summer, but by that time his boss had changed, and he really didn't like the new boss. He decided not to take the job with that boss, and instead interviewed with a new team. He didn't get the job after that interview.  Meanwhile, back at school, he and the department had a falling out. In his words, there were rules that you had to finish your degree in so many semester or credits would start needing to be redone. The combination of his internships (which counted as semesters to the school) and his deployments (which a few counted as still in school), he was out of semesters.   He never did get his degree. To add one more wrinkle, he broke his hand in that final year, and had quite a bit of medical bills. He emailed all his recruiter contacts sayiong ""I need to start working Monday. Who wants me?""

There has always been an underlying ""We do not need to rely on the big government!"" in this country.  In addition, many people have decided that it is impossible for the government to do anything correctly, therefore SS will fail.  Then, there are people who think the government is evil and by trusting that SS will be there to help they would be admitting that the government can be useful to them and this is clearly unacceptable for these people.  There are also things such as the debt ceiling bullshit which keeps popping up, so many bad things said about veteran care, and just general incompetence with money when it comes to the U.S. government.  I really think that last one, which I have split off into a different paragraph for emphasis, is the largest reason that people in this sub do not include SS.  People in this sub are all about not a balanced budget, but a surplus!  These people see how they can cut costs, increase income, and just in general are able to continually do well.  These people also see others, such as family, go into debt potentially bankruptcy.  Therefore these people have a mindset of ""Well, I can trust myself that I can pay for my own things.  The government on the other hand is just like my uncle who died penniless because he always spent more than he made and he could not even provide for his children.  If the government cannot even provide for it's own budget it is silly to expect it to be able to pay for me as well."""

More realistically, Congress previously revoked Social Security for any alien who was deported for being a member of the Communist Party, which the Supreme Court held as constitutional. ... so if you're counting on Social Security but then Congress decides to means-test benefits or you happen to be a politically unpopular minority, you could be in a lot of trouble.   Given the relatively low sums it pays out and the risks involved, I think it's quite appropriate to consider the expected value of Social Security to be $0 and just be pleasantly surprised if it turns out you get anything.  It's an interesting question whether it's easier to become FI in the US or other countries-- the 'free' healthcare comes at the cost of higher taxes, which makes saving easier in the US.

I am hesitant about any political prognostications, because for anything that can reasonably be called 'early retirement', these issues are decades out, and there's fundamentally no way to know how it's going to shake out.

Even though the belief is fundamentally an illusion, I am willing to hope that there would be considerable backlash on any legislation that tries to eliminate benefits entirely or even add means testing. But I could certainly see steps being taken to push full retirement age out more, offer lower benefits, and maybe have a certain element of means testing, but one that doesn't zero out someone's benefit.   It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the upcoming decades, esp. as a big population lump of boomers ages into Soc Sec eligibility.  I'm counting on Soc Security. My planned expenses would be 2/3 covered by it. If it's gone by the time I'm eligible, it's definitely going to mean a change of plans."

financialindependence,3dq5dx,ckr801,3,Sun Jul 19 01:03:58 2015 UTC,There are many ways.   Remove the upper income limit for which people pay into social security.   Transfer money from the general fund into SS (instead of the other way around).   If it came down to it we would see big cuts in military spending long before social security.   If there are actual benefit cuts it would likely be no more than 5% or so simply because so many people depend on it.   Maybe they could get away with a little more than that thru a slow process of letting benefits get eroded by inflation.
financialindependence,3dq5dx,oscarboom,-5,Sun Jul 19 23:52:29 2015 UTC,Remove the upper income limit for which people pay into social security   This is lowering the return for those people since their benefits have already hit a ceiling and isn't the way the original program was designed. It's also unpopular.   Transfer money from the general fund into SS (instead of the other way around).   If it came down to it we would see big cuts in military spending long before social security.    This is just propping the program up with subsidies it's not really balancing its budget.   Maybe they could get away with a little more than that thru a slow process of letting benefits get eroded by inflation.   This is a good one... manipulate the CPI to increase revenue and decrease outlays. Some economists think the government is already understating CPI to the tune of 1-2% a year precisely to achieve this goal.  It's still kind of a cheap trick though it's not really solving the root problem.

SS is a ponzi scheme that depends upon a certain demographic distribution caused for example by very high birth rates and yield the labor force necessary to support all the retirees. as soon as the distribution shifts the entire program falls down like a house of cards.

I have no issue streaming netflix to my projector so for all intents and purposes there is not really any difference in what we are getting for speeds.  Also, for Cox I already own a modem/router I can use from when I had previously used Time Warner.  Because that cost was not associated with the following it will be ignored.  $1,750 (yr 1); $2,110 (yr 2); $2,470 (yr 3); $2,830 (yr 4); $3,190(yr 5)  $200 (modem/router) + $35 * 12 = $620 (yr 1) $620 + $420 = $1,040 (yr 2); $1,460 (yr 3); $1,880 (yr4); $2,300 (yr5)  At some point eventually you will have it cheaper, but I think by that time we both would have switched over to something else such as fiber anyway.

financialindependence,3dskb8,xbt_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:07 2015 UTC,It sounds like you initial investment was what 200-300k? That's still pretty great for a 25 year old so id say if you managed to save that in the few working years you belong here.   As others have said just ride it out before you spend anything.  Pretend all is the same until at least the dividend comes in. Plenty of people with millions on paper do not manage to cash in on it through forces outside of their control and end up with considerably less. I'm sure it will all work out but the FI move is to be very conservative with your estimate of paper-only earnings until you can realize them.

As you can see by the formula, low incomes get 90% return.  So ironically, for a high earner, more zero's can actually increase the rate of return (say you own a business and are trying to decide how much salary to take versus dividend profit).  Yes, the payment will decrease, but I really wish I could chose not to only get 15% return on every dollar contributed.  I'm at 23 years of contributing (although 8 are really low wages from high school/college), but the zeros are now starting to have minimal effect on the payout.  In the 15% return level, $1,000/mo lower average only equals $150.  It is that first $1,000/mo average that is important as that yields $900/mo.  It really is a very heavy social program that takes from the wealthy and gives to the poor."
financialindependence,3dp7pk,Packerfan80,3,Sat Jul 18 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"More zeros might increase ""rate of return"" but I think OP's question about maximizing is probably ""How do I get the biggest monthly payment from Social Security if I will not have 35 years of earnings in my record?""  The answer has already been given:    Work more years so you have fewer zeros, to increase your PIA.  Self employment income in your time of ""semi""-retirement certainly counts toward SSA records, if you are doing Schedule SE and paying SE tax. Then also, delay the start of taking Soc Sec if you think you will live beyond the break even point compared to taking it earlier.   Edit: I forgot this strategy:   Marry someone with an awesome SSA earnings record, and get spousal benefits after age 62."

Social security is rather insecure for young people these days, due to the high costs. As someone retiring early, you'll be entitled to less social security in the first place. Then, it is likely that the benefits will be less by the time that we're old (benefits will probably not increase with inflation). And finally, it is also likely that they will also increase the age at which you can receive (full) benefits."

When you fill out a W-4 you state how many exemptions you are taking (one for your self, possible one for spouse or kids etc). Deductions come in all shapes and sizes but the most common one is the standard deduction worth around $6k for single and $12k for married.  You need to cover the first five years so you invest in the stock market in a regular taxable account and then start selling it off during that five year period. Since your taxable income is $0 you are in the 10% tax bracket and would owe $0 of capital gains on the stocks you sell (there is a limit to this though I think around $72k per year)."

financialindependence,3dmmhz,smurphy1,7,Fri Jul 17 15:56:12 2015 UTC,In a taxable account you have to pay taxes on any dividends you earn and and capital gains you earn if you sell something. In an IRA (Roth or otherwise) you don't taxes while the money is in the IRA. So if you sell some stock and make a $100 profit you would not owe taxes if it was in an IRA while you would owe taxes if it was in a taxable account.

So if you got paid $1,000, then taxes leaves you with $600, investing your $600 in your Betterment account (which is what I do) will be your taxable account. It's taxed before you put the money in, it's taxed while it grows (if the fund managers sell/buy stocks/funds) and it's taxed again when you withdraw money from your investment account (in order to withdraw money from there the brokerage must sell some investments, thus incurring a taxable event - the government gets a piece of whatever stocks became more valuable than when you bought them)."

I would advise reading through most/all of the topics there. Once you get to know the jargon, then it would make more sense to dive into more technical articles (like madfientist).  A couple examples from the faq:   basic financial advice taxes faq investing faq"
financialindependence,3dmmhz,ButterGolem,6,Fri Jul 17 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"A good amount of the technical portion of FI you read on the web is all about finding the most efficient route through the US tax code.  Because if you work the system as the rules allow, you can really reduce your tax burden.  That being said, if you have trouble reading the IRS site about capital gains without falling asleep, perhaps an example would server better.  Download the tax forms and fill them out with some made up example numbers to try out the different scenarios to help understand how different amounts of income affect tax rates.  I used to hate doing my taxes with a passion. But now that I pretty much understand them, it's almost enjoyable once I understood the fairly complex system we have to navigate.    For example you get a personal exemption, deduction of home mortgage interest, etc. Add all those up and you can convert that amount from tIRA to rIRA tax free.   Investing, can also be complicated and confusing at first.  Check out ""the Bogleheads guide to investing"" to get a quick start into the process.  To address one of your points of confusion, slightly simplified but if you are in the 15% tax bracket or lower and  you sell stocks you've owned longer than a year the profits aren't taxed at all.  You pay income tax on converting tIRA to rIRA so you do it in small enough amounts to still stay in the 15% tax bracket and in 5 years once that amount is ""seasoned"" so to speak, you can withdraw it tax-free.  This 5 year rolling period is referred to as a conversion ladder because each year you're loading money into the pipeline to be accessed 5 years down the road.  So for the first 5 years, before your initial conversion has ""seasoned"" and can be withdrawn from the rIRA you need some kind of income to survive on.  So during that time you could draw from your taxable investment account(no age restrictions or anything like IRA's have) until you can access that rIRA principal you converted 5 years prior. Hope that helps."
financialindependence,3dmmhz,fyoumoney,4,Fri Jul 17 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know what deductions and exemptions are. So I google the terms and I always end up at a very long and extremely complicated dictionary page. So complicated that I can't relate it back to the original article. This seems to be the case for any financial term I google.   Honestly, I don't mean to sound harsh, but it looks like you need to get a little better at googling. I just googled ""tax deduction vs tax exemption,"" and the first result explains the difference very simply in the first few paragraphs: http://www.obliviousinvestor.com/the-difference-between-exemptions-deductions-and-credits/  Nonetheless,   A tax exemption is saying ""X amount of my income is not subject to taxes."" This is known ahead of time, for things like being a Head of Household, having a dependent, etc.  A tax deduction is saying ""I am deducting X amount from my income because it was used for xyz"". This is known at the end of the year when filing taxes, for example, student loan interest payments.  So say I made $100k last year. Only something like $85k is going to be subjected to taxes because of my exemptions and deductions.  The actual difference between the two doesn't really matter for the point madfientest is trying to make. What he is saying there is that, in order to not pay any taxes when you're converting your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, since the conversions counts as ordinary income, if your exemptions are $10k and you estimate your deductions to be another $10k, only transfer $20k a year so that you can avoid paying taxes entirely.  20k (Income) - 20k (exemptions&deductions) = 0 taxable income.  The other sentence, I'll admit, is rather unclear. I'm guessing(?) he is assuming that you have a standard brokerage account with some investments in it, and that if you keep your IRA conversion (ordinary income) within the 15% tax bracket, then you can sell some securities or withdraw dividends from your brokerage account in order to pay the bills, and not have to pay long-term capital gains tax."

financialindependence,3dmmhz,NadirPointing,2,Fri Jul 17 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but someone is more likely to correct me here. IRA conversions are taxed as income so all the tax deductions you normally have like standard deduction, or itemized deductions(medical, mortgage, educational etc) that you have will count against that conversion at tax time. The goal is to make your income fit just barely inside that 0% tax bracket. On your 1040 tax form these lines are labeled deductions and exemptions.   Capital gains does come from selling investments(stocks, bonds, real estate, etc) generally, exactly as you suspected. This is from your ""taxable"" or ""brokerage"" account and is the sale price - the buy price. Dividends pay out without a sale and get taxed similarly. If you have stuff in 401Ks, IRAs, or any tax advantaged account this doesn't count, those have their own rules. And you are right you can only withdraw roth IRA contributions early without penalty. But conversions(mentioned earlier) don't have a penalty(within the rules).  Definitions for the newbie: Capital gains: When you make money selling investments outside of special accounts. (just the profits) Dividends: When an owned stock pays you money for owning it (regardless of if its reinvested). Exemptions: Things that cause money to be tax exempt like the dependent exemption(you have a kid) Deductions: Ways of reducing the amount of taxable income you claim like mortgage interest, business expenses, tuition.   http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/"
financialindependence,3dmmhz,molluskunk,2,Fri Jul 17 15:46:07 2015 UTC,"As /u/smurphy1 mentioned, deductions and exemptions are the things that lower your taxable income.    2015 Standard Deductions (income that is not taxed)    Filing Status Standard Deduction    Single $6,300   Married Filing Jointly $12,600   Married FIling Separately $6,300   Head of Household $9,250   Surviving Spouse $12,600    If you can itemize a larger deduction, you'll save even more.  This typically only applies to homeowners paying an amount of mortgage interest higher than their standard deduction.  If you don't have a mortgage, you probably won't itemize.  Exemptions are straighforward - for 2015 you get $4,000 for every person on your tax return.  This means that for 2015 a single filer will have $10,300 of income that is not taxed from your standard deduction and personal exemption.    After this first $10,300 your income starts being taxed at the marginal tax rates - 10% up to $9,225, 15% from $9,225 to $37,450, 25% from $37,450 to $90,750 and on up.     During this time, you can live off of your long-term capital gains and dividends, which will be taxed at 0% if you are in the 10% or 15% tax bracket.   This is talking about how longterm capital gains tax rates are less than ordinary income tax rates.  This means that for 2015, after your $10,300 of free tax from your standard deduction and exemption, you can withdraw another $37,450 (the 10%+15% tax brackets) from long term capital gains and still be taxed at 0%."

Another way is if that stock is giving you a dividend (again, held stock for more than a year) then the dividend is considered a long term capital gain.    How are long term capital gains taxed?  If you're single, you can make $36,900 in LTCG (too long to type that out!) and not pay a cent in federal income taxes.  Married, $73,800.  IRA Conversions?  They count as ordinary income!  The standard deduction for 2015 Single or married filing separately: $6,300. Married filing jointly: $12,600. So if you're converting less than that, you'll pay no taxes again.  Make sense?"
financialindependence,3dmmhz,schwanzenator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"To get back to the article that you drew quotations from, both of the passages you quoted apply to a very special situation. Someone who:   has stopped working for income, but at an age too early to draw money from retirement accounts without penalty has low income or no income has traditional IRA balance wants to convert some of trad IRA balance to Roth, yet not pay much in taxes had sufficient taxable account investments that some can be sold if needed for spending takes advantage of having not much income to convert some amount of trad IRA to Roth but pay 0% taxes on it by arranging total amount converted plus other income for the year to remain under $6300 deduction and $4000 personal exemption, i.e. under $10300, an amount that is not taxed (these numbers apply to a single filer with no dependents) now has put money from trad to Roth without ever paying taxes on it -- an early retirement feat, and the money will never be taxed thereafter manages to live by spending available savings (untaxed) or by selling appreciated investments, but only as much as needed, and trying to remain in 10% or 15% bracket so that none of those capital gains are taxed   This person is taking advantage of two separate aspects of tax law:   A certain amount of ordinary income you earn (in this case, money from converting trad to Roth IRA) is taxed at 0%. It's not a huge amount, but you can transfer that much from trad to IRA and never have it taxed if you do it in small chunks like that each year, but this relies on the person not having much other taxable income. Capital gains realized in a year you are in 15% tax bracket or lower are taxed at 0%. So this is another way of realizing income advantageously. Rather than paying taxes on capital gains of 15% or more, which you'd have to do if you had a larger income, you don't pay those taxes. Again, this relies on the person being in a low income year.   The first of the two strategies is done in early retirement to beef up the Roth IRA (which won't be taxed), not to actually spend from the Roth. The other is done simply to cash out a gain without paying taxes on it, and might be done solely to generate money to live off, or might be done just to ""reset"" cost basis so future cap gains will be less.  Ideally, this is describing a period of time before this person turns 59.5, i.e. before using trad IRA or 401k for spending uses. However, the conversions from trad to Roth could also be setting up for spending out of the Roth in a penalty free way earlier than usual, also known as Roth pipeline.  As you can see, a number of things need to be in place for this to work. For most people, a conversion of trad IRA chunk to Roth IRA status would involve paying taxes, and you have to judge ""is paying the taxes at my current marginal rate the right thing to do now?"" This is a special instance where Roth conversions are highly profitable. Also, being able to cash in an investment and not pay cap gains is unusual: you can't do that if you're working and earning such that you are in the 25% bracket or higher."

Lots of people here feel that MMM is a bit extreme, but MMM also backs up his points with real research.  You might find that toys increase your happiness, but it's only temporary and your brain becomes addicted to that boost, giving you a sort of withdrawal unhappiness later.  The net result is that buying the toy did not help your happiness over the longer term.  Like everything in life, most people here go for somewhere in between.  Personally I like my toys and won't give that up.  But then again, an addict would say that :)"
financialindependence,3dkrgi,caedin8,31,Fri Jul 17 12:35:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for painting both sides correctly.
financialindependence,3dkrgi,stealstea,15,Fri Jul 17 14:38:49 2015 UTC,The MMM way - you should be frugal everywhere.   That isn't the MMM message.  He talks a lot about luxuries that he buys.   Be frugal everywhere is perhaps the ERE message.  MMM does push hard on changing your mindset to really examine whether the luxuries you think matter to you really do and if they are providing long term happiness.
financialindependence,3dkrgi,trobertson79,5,Fri Jul 17 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"I believe people are conflating frugal and cheap.  MMM doesn't encouarge you to not buy things that make you happy.  He encourages you to be frugal which can also mean ""making the most of a thing"" (money for instance).  He's against autopilot thinking in the box spending routines.  Over on the MMM forums some guy gave this long spiel that I won't get into but in the end all of us in the forum where encouarging him to ""spend $100/mo for his gym membership rather than teaching a class for the gym that costs him sleep""."

And many, many more that definitely did nothing to increase my happiness or improve my life in any way but I ""had to have"" them at the time.  Definitely giving every expense actual thought ""do I really need this"" is a better plan than just buying what you want because it's cheap or whatever."

financialindependence,3dkrgi,Smartare,18,Fri Jul 17 15:27:41 2015 UTC,"You'll notice that basically almost all the high earners on this sub are software people. It's the fastest way for most people to reach FI considering the high salaries but low requirements for education costs and certifications compared to say, doctors, lawyers, etc."
financialindependence,3dkrgi,supershinythings,34,Fri Jul 17 07:43:48 2015 UTC,Software engineers tend to migrate towards reddit as a whole.  So take that with a grain of salt.
financialindependence,3dkrgi,Smartare,10,Fri Jul 17 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"Yup -- my fear is that people see software as some sort of magic career. Truth is, many people make 100k in office jobs.   Software is NOT for everyone, I see a lot of people who no talent for software every day ending up in junior roles. I am sure they won't make it. Also I think everyone has forgotten that the tech industry has crashed before, and it could happen again. So please stop crowding into this job market because there are plenty of other areas."
financialindependence,3dkrgi,Twerkulez,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"Truth is, many people make 100k in office jobs.    Are you saying that like that's a bad thing? That's four times the median US individual income. One of my friends is already halfway to FI after making 90k per year at his software job he got out of uni.  When you compare a ""bad office job with 100k"" to the normal American jobs of working in a restaurant, or working in some carpet factory making only 25-30k a year, software is heaven. I have a friend who graduated with a MA and worked in a restaurant for 4 years because he couldn't find anything with his degree. So he learned to program and now works at Amazon, 100k plus benefits on entry.  100k a year is a magic career for most people. Most people will never see that kind of salary."
financialindependence,3dkrgi,airstreamturkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:09:55 2015 UTC,"Can I get your opinion, then?  I graduate in December with a Math BS and a few business strategy internships. Lots of people tell me I should go into software since I'll have the right logic skills to do so. Of course, regardless of which career path I enter, I will need to proactively put in a lot of work to learn the ropes and gain competencies. So I'm prepared for that.   The thing is I'm not super into programming. I have some very minor experience with Java, Sage (an open-source math programming language based in python), and SQL. But my heart isn't into it right now. And I haven't learned enough programming to say whether it's for me.  I'm also worried that people are pushing towards software just because it's fashionable at the moment.  What do you think? Should I look more seriously into software, or would you discourage me from doing it since it's not my passion? What other areas were you thinking of as alternatives?"
financialindependence,3dkrgi,puppibreath,2,Sun Jul 19 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"I have some very minor experience with Java, Sage (an open-source math programming language based in python), and SQL   Well, thats sound like you do know what you are doing -- that stuff is a bit more than intro level. I suppose you could program more to see if you truly like or don't like it. The only people who are good programmers are the ones who actually enjoy it, so its good to save yourself the pain of making a career switch, and just figure that out first. You could do a personal software project and see how you like it. It doesn't have to make money -- but it would help you figure out how much you like it.   There are also DevOps, database admins, who do less programming but are really tech savvy and know their way around an operating system.  I am sure there are lots of other math/logic based careers but I am not the best person to ask ... probably insurance stuff (actuarial), data analytics, technical BA's ... tons of options I am sure."
financialindependence,3dkrgi,airstreamturkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds like this semester it would be smart to work on a self-directed programming project and see how it goes.

financialindependence,3dkrgi,little_banjo,17,Mon Jul 20 02:50:48 2015 UTC,I think it's also that software engineers probably hang out at reddit more than lawyers and doctors. + That software engineers seems more likely to feel they don't need to keep up with the Jones compared to doctors and lawyers
financialindependence,3dkrgi,joeflux,2,Fri Jul 17 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised.  Reddit has /r/law, /r/lawyers (private), /r/medicine where plenty of other folks hang out."

financialindependence,3dkrgi,dillpiccolol,9,Fri Jul 17 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly the FI movement is very very strongly tied to SWE's for this exact reason. Many lawyers/bankers in my circle think the same way I (we) do, but the costs to enter the profession are so high that everything is delayed.  I also think that SWE's age out of the profession, while lawyers/bankers/doctors age in. I know for lawyers there is sort of golden handcuffs in a way. You toil for 10 years making around six figures before making partner. Once (if ever) partner, you are now making 2-5 times more than you've ever made for essentially the same amount of work. Difficult to walk away from that."
financialindependence,3dkrgi,joeflux,5,Fri Jul 17 14:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to reassure others here that you don't have to be a software engineer...really. I was a nurse, my husband is a graphic designer who made less than I did as a nurse. I left nursing last year at 53. I could have done it sooner probably, but I didn't wake up to the idea of FIRE until pretty late in the game and I had three children - one in college and two in high school (teens are NOT cheap, my friends). I was working per diem part time most of my career too, so there's that.  I am dabbling in real estate at the moment since we own rentals and my husband is still working part time (he's younger than I). The only reason we are doing this is because we'd like to stay in our big fat house and remodel it. The plan is to make a suite on one end to do Airbnb. If we don't like that, we can always sell the place. It's a mile from a major university, so we should do well on it.  There are a lot of routes to FI, so don't think you have to rush into software engineering. Sure, it pays a lot, but it seems a lot of those careers are in expensive places like the Bay area, Seattle, Denver, NYC, etc. You have to balance your goals to get the right mix. I wanted kids, I doubt I'd enjoy software engineering, and I'm from the South so I have inexpensive choices in living arrangements that are close to family."

While I work on them I develop other niche expertise that may become a new 'superpower'.    'Superpowers' are what get me hired, in the door, with a decent package.  Doing good work keeps me employed.  I have a good work ethic, I get things done, I solve problems before folks know they're problems, and in general try to keep things running smooth around me so no drama develops.

Since I don't have a whirlwind of activity around me, running around making a big production of how 'hard' I have to work, pretending that I've been assigned to save the universe, when raise time comes around I pretty much get the shit.  On the plus side, I HATE drama, so I sleep OK at night, don't worry about things, and foresee danger to head it off usually MONTHS in advance.  So I guess my job IS easy, as long as I take that stitch in time to handle small things while they're small instead of watching them balloon into mega-shit just because it wasn't exactly in my wheelhouse at the time."

financialindependence,3dowim,dillonph,18,Sat Jul 18 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but that's a pretty odd/random/meaningless metric (net worth increase as a % of income). Assuming majority of you're net worth is in securities/RE, you're increase (or decrease) in net worth over a year isn't necessarily determined by your income/savings rate."

financialindependence,3dowim,fyoumoney,2,Sat Jul 18 01:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, we talk about 401k contributions in relation to income because the contributions come solely from our income. But growth in our net worth (as long as we're not 100% cash) does not solely come from our income."

financialindependence,3dowim,WestTexasRedneck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:00 2015 UTC,It would be better to do net worth increase as a percentage of your annual spending. Divide 25 by that number and get your time to FI.

No drastic lifestyle change, investment returns have been pretty good but nothing special.    If I count the gift as income (add it to the denominator), I'm at 65% for this year so far.  If I pretend I never received it (subtract it from the numerator) I'm at 52%."

financialindependence,3dowim,Voerendaalse,2,Sat Jul 18 06:16:22 2015 UTC,"It is an odd way of measuring it. In the years to come, you will for example have $200k in investments that will, say, give you $20k of growth for that year. Then, you will also add $40k more from your $100k income. Now, if you calculate that your way, you have made an increase of ($20k+$40k)/$100k is 60%, while a third of that is due to the fact that you had saved up $200k previously.   Even better, imagine that you've got $500k saved up, the markets do really well and give a 15% return, or $75k, and you save $50k of your $100k salary ... Now your net worth has increased by 125% of your salary!  At the moment I am tracking two things: one is my net worth, and its growth is influenced both by my new contributions and by the growth of the assets that I already have. And two is my savings rate, the amount of money I manage to not spend from my income. I want the second to be as big as possible. And I know that the savings rate influences my net worth, but I realize that the stock market will have more and more influence on my net worth."
financialindependence,3dowim,iaddandsubtract,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:59:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's an interesting dynamic actually. I plan to RE in about 1 year. This year I expect my NW to increase by roughly 200% of my gross wages. I save roughly 30% of gross wages, so the other 170% is coming from investment gains (hopefully).  This creates an interesting dynamic in my mind. I could basically just quit saving and that would only require me to work another 3 months or so (assuming consistent, stable growth in investment income which isn't a very good assumption, but work with me here). Or, I could lose my job entirely, and just cut my expenses to the bone for a couple of years and still attain my desired FI amount.  This thought process makes me realize how unimportant my job really is once I get close to FI. I'm actually probably already FI because I could make some lifestyle modifications and still accumulate net worth, but I choose to work until I achieve my goal number because I have a desired lifestyle to finance."
financialindependence,3dowim,Voerendaalse,2,Sat Jul 18 09:24:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, I've wondered about this. I'm nowhere near ""there"", but I imagine that if you only need say 2% more to reach your number, then you're so close that you're ""safe"". If you're fired at that point in time, you'll just have to find a way to cut 2% of your expenses. If you're really sick of it and quit, ditto. It must be a weird situation to be in?

financialindependence,3dowim,FatAlbert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:03:12 2015 UTC,"We all talk about savings rates, etc, but how much does your net worth increase every year as a percentage of your income   How is that any different than savings rate?"
financialindependence,3dowim,stealstea,10,Sat Jul 18 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"It's totally different from your savings rate. If the market goes up 20% in the year, so does your net worth, and you don't have to save a dime.  Or if the market tanks, and your savings rate is 50%, your net worth may be breakeven."
financialindependence,3dowim,walloon5,2,Sat Jul 18 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"It would include things like home equity, checking accounts (I.e, accounts not designated for saving, but may see growth anyways due to frugality), and other investments that wouldn't really be considered ""normal"" savings for this sub (401k and IRAs).   More of an ""overall financial picture"". Maybe you're still illiquid though like 50 cent!"
financialindependence,3dowim,btax80,2,Sat Jul 18 01:34:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I definitely count more than my 401k/IRA. I have more in taxable accounts than I do in those tax-advantaged accounts. And I include my checking accounts when I consider savings for FI. I even count my house, but that's because I'm going to be selling it.  To answer your question, I have no idea, but I'm sure it varies largely each year based on market performance."

My primary one is a website.  I've completely automated the content, monetization, and social media.  I went about three years without touching it, save for a few marketing efforts, and the money has kept coming in every month.  It's not a full-time living, but the ratio of dollars to time invested is pretty enormous.  I've taken the last month or two and lazily rewritten the whole site in my spare time (and a little bit on the clock, heh) to change the business model up a bit.  It's still going to be almost entirely automated, but hopefully much more scalable and profitable.  Ideally I'll be able to grow it into a full-time income.  Of course, then I could quit my job... But I don't think I would.  I think I'll just sock away most or all of the money and build myself a future.  I wanna take that retirement age and keep yanking it closer."

Being a developer was an enormous leg up, as I didn't have to pay anybody, explain ideas to anyone, compromise, or use cookie cutter systems.  That being said, you can accomplish this sort of thing without those skills.  You just need an idea, content that you can push traffic to and monetize.  If you can find a way to automate it, then even better!"
financialindependence,3dnnq6,johnsmithindustries,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who is not a developer, I guess I'd be interested in resources to begin the process of learning it. I understand that I can pay my way through much of the process but I'm the type of person who would find it more fun to learn a skill along the way as more of a hobby than a business.  Some more questions...  Idea/Content:  Did you use any tools or resources to determine what content you went with? Was it just a ""good idea"" you had? If it was a good idea, did you vet it somehow before committing to the site?  Is your content fixed (i.e. did you fill a niche that doesn't require frequent changes), or is it updated frequently by a process you have automated?  Monetization: Are you comfortable sharing what services you used to monetize the site? I'm familiar with how money is made on the internet so don't feel the need to explain in too much detail.  Thanks for entertaining my questions!"

I started in iOS and haven't bothered with Android since there's always been more money on iOS.  There's tons of places to learn mobile app development nowadays.

financialindependence,3dnnq6,michaelpatzer,2,Sat Jul 18 02:10:29 2015 UTC,How many years would you say it took from not knowing programming to earning a passive income?
financialindependence,3dnnq6,TaylorSeriesExpansio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:10:42 2015 UTC,"From not knowing programming (September/October 2010), we (my friend and I) published our first 2 apps in 3 months (December 2010). Basically all of the downloads were from family and friends for those apps. We spent the next 2 months building an app that got repeatedly rejected by Apple (discouraging). Then we made a free version of our sound-boarding app and got our first real passive income (somewhere around $0.50-$1.00/day). We were able to use some of the code from our rejected app to build 2 Hawaiian-themed apps called Hawaiian Words and Hawaiian Names in March/April 2011. Combined, those 2 apps started getting around 200 downloads/day by summer 2011 and we thought we were doing really well (a couple of dollars a day). By late 2011, I remember lying on the floor of my parents house very upset. By then my friend and I had parted ways, and I was making $10/day. I had spent over a year of my life pouring my heart, soul, mind, and effort into something that I wanted to make into a career. Everything was perfect except the money. I loved the freedom, the creativity, the challenge, but it wasn't enough to live off of. I had published a few more small apps by this point, but nothing had taken off. I ended up taking a full-time job in January 2012 at a mobile advertising company (where I still work). I felt strange getting this job, I didn't feel qualified at all, but I studied by butt off before and after the interviews, and during the first few months of work. Shortly after taking the job (still working on my apps, but on the side now), things started to do well. I don't remember the numbers exactly, but I think in 2012 I earned about $20K from my apps (roughly $50/day). In 2013, I got super focused and set goals. Published and tweaked my apps, got a couple featured after good marketing campaigns, and was up to $200/day by May 2013 (my goal had been that number by July). I sold my most successful app in early 2014 for about 1.5X it's annual revenue, which was quite a windfall for me. I was afraid there was no place to go but down, since it was the highest ranked app in its category. 1.5 years later and its still ranked #1 and probably pulling in even more revenue than when I owned it. I probably sold too early and too low, but hard to regret a nice big profit. Having had about 25 other apps at the time, I decided to sell them too because I was tired of the maintenance (OS updates, device updates, and I'm kind of OCD, so there were always things I wanted to improve for every app, my to-do lists were a huge mental burden). I stopped all the side projects and just had fun. For the first time ever, I would leave my day job and go ride my bike, see friends, etc. It was glorious. After about 3 months, a graphic designer from the UK found me and wanted to start doing projects together. I got sucked back in due to the allure of passive income (which, after reading this you should realize is not really passive at all, unless you just stop and let it ride). So now I'm doing a bunch of new apps with the aim of rebuilding my passive income stream again. The apps look much better since I'm working with a pro designer, but I'm splitting the profits now too. We're a about $25/day (if we stopped working, this would probably ride for another year, then slowly decline). I still earn some passive revenue from the old apps I built and sold a couple of years ago. Somehow there are still users on older versions that occasionally click on ads. With the number of apps I've built, that's still bringing in about $10/day. With the amount of time I spent building my passive income stream, I probably could have earned a lot more money doing contract programming (though there's something nice about watching money trickle in when you sleep).  TL;DR: It took about 3 years to get to a point where I could have quit my job and lived off the income."

Historically real estate has been really good in terms of passive income, and with more americans opting to rent, demand is rising. A lot of times being a landlord can also shield you from the ups and downs of the stock market, as rent doesn't go down even if we are in a bear market."
financialindependence,3dnnq6,rachetheavenger,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"Real-estate is very dependent on the local market unlike the stock market. So one needs to figure out how their local market operates.  If one lives in a nice part of a large city where people move to all the time, one can be in a situation where there are never any vacancies, rather one gets to choose from multiple applicants who gets to rent (like rent only to STEM graduates) and take a months rent in advance as a deposit.   This does mean that the rent to value ratio is comparatively lower than other areas (due to value being driven pretty high), however it makes the rental income pretty stable, and reduces the risks (vacancy, reduced exposure to recession, maintenance costs)."

financialindependence,3dnnq6,fyoumoney,4,Fri Jul 17 21:52:24 2015 UTC,That's not passive unless made a bot or something that plays for you. Passive means basically no time input. Back when I was playing a lot of online poker I could make about $20 an hour but it definitely was not passive.
financialindependence,3dlt9w,super_goatman,25,Fri Jul 17 08:47:04 2015 UTC,"For the first time yesterday, thinking about how much money I've saved up already was giving me a positive feeling. Like, shit-eating grin kind of feeling.  I discovered Fi/RE earlier this year. I've always been pretty frugal about my normal expenses (rent, car, etc.). But as I climbed the ladder and moved to the city (Boston), my income doubled, and tripled, and yet my overall savings stayed about the same (~$300/mo). What happened was all the extra money I made, I just spent on going out to eat more and buying useless stuff (big screen TV). I spent ~$2500/mo (for myself) last year going out.  I was living it up. Yet most of the time I was depressed and I didn't know why. I saw a few therapists and talked to close friends about my depression, and they didn't understand either. Apparently I make too much money to be unhappy.  Since discovering FI/RE now I'm cooking all my own food and saving ridiculous amounts of money. It's like a found a cheat code for life. At the same time I eliminated alcohol (never enjoyed it much anyway), TV and (most) video games too, and I have so much free time exercise, read, cook, try new hobbies and activities, see friends/family, etc..  Weirdly, when I try to tell people how amazing life is with no T.V. and cooking all your own food, etc. they say things like ""Are you a monk or something?"" (Seriously, I've gotten that exact response from more than a handful of people, including from two girls on a first date. Is not watching T.V. that crazy?).  I've also tried to hint about my FI/RE plans, but people always laugh it off. I've even tried to be pretty open with co-workers who I know have the same means as me. ""What have you been up to lately?"" ""Oh you know, planning my retirement, hopefully within 5 years or so"" ""Haha, so where should we go out to eat for lunch?"" (And that's usually when I say ""I brought a lunch"" and they are shocked and horrified).  While I'd love to be able to talk more openly about it, knowing that my life sounds so crazy is actually re-assuring. I've totally found this great short-cut in life and I'm lucky that it works well for my personality.  tl;dr: Since discovering FI/RE, life is changing from ""meh"" to ""awesome"". Feels good!"

A lot of his stuff is directly applicable to FI. For example, it was in The Black Swan that I first heard the term ""f you money,"" and a lot of concepts laid out in Antifragile about optionality are extremely related to FI.  He never really talks directly about achieving FI, but some things leak through. He reached FI in pretty much a single day (the 1987 crash), and when he talks about investing strategies, he's a big proponent of keeping a lot of money in cash. As for actually investing, his is a strategy of exposing yourself to situations with high upside and low downside, and doing this enough times such that one event occurs which makes you rich.  This is quite different than the main approach here: work hard and buy as much VTSAX as you can. I wonder what Taleb would say about our strategy here."

My guess from reading his work is that our strategy here is quite fragile and vulnerable to black swans.  A lot of gold in there. People on this sub do not like to engage in market timing. He proposes we keep cash or numeraire repository of value and make convex bets with high upside, limited downside.

I have just come to accept no strategy is 100%. Sure, maybe something horrible happens and destroys your whole portfolio post-FIRE. It's a risk I'm willing to take.  That said, there is something to be said for investing something in businesses directly.

You can imagine the two of them across the table from each other, Niederhoffer explaining that his bet was an acceptable risk, that the odds of the market going down so heavily that he would be wiped out were minuscule, and Taleb listening and shaking his head, and thinking about black swans. “I was depressed when I left him,” Taleb said. “Here is a guy who goes out and hits a thousand backhands. He plays chess like his life depends on it. Here is a guy who, whatever he wants to do when he wakes up in the morning, he ends up better than anyone else. Whatever he wakes up in the morning and decides to do, he did better than anyone else. I was talking to my hero . . .” This was the reason Taleb didn’t want to be Niederhoffer when Niederhoffer was at his height — the reason he didn’t want the silver and the house and the tennis matches with George Soros.""  http://gladwell.com/blowing-up/"

He's great at marketing himself, but I've never found his ideas to be as great as people say they are.  He expounds a lot of truisms (like exposing yourself to upside and limit your downside) and the limitations of mathematical models he constantly rags on are, well, nothing new.  (E.g. stuff like the recent financial crisis was a X-standard deviation event, even though look at how many crises have happened!  Obviously those mathematicians are retarded!  When in reality everyone knows the limitation of using a normal distribution and if you look at market prices and implied volatilities of things like options there's a premium for extreme downside protection.)  On the other hand, he's never shown his returns, which is very suspicious.  Yes, he might make a killing during crashes, but what about during the regular times?  A simple monthly frequency put option strategy on the S&P 500 might have amazing returns over '08 but over the long run it actually loses money.  A lot of people in the money management industry can be great marketers but sport shitty returns."
financialindependence,3dlt9w,fyoumoney,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, it sounds like you haven't really read his books, especially Antifragile. His high-level concept of antifragility is pretty much 100% original. No one in print has ever explicitly formulated the concept of antifragility before. And while the ideas underlying The Black Swan may not be anything new, his synthesis of them was basically one of a kind when it came out.  All of this is in addition to his technical mathematical papers, the content of which is found in no statistical/probability textbook anywhere.  I'd strongly disagree that ""everyone knows the limitation of using a normal distribution."" Again, examples of people either not knowing, or choosing to ignore said limitations are littered throughout his texts. It's not nearly as simple as ""obviously those mathematicians are retarded."" First off, hindsight is 20/20 and it's easy for you to say that after the fact, whereas Taleb had The Black Swan written and published before the 2008 crash. Also, despite all that, the entire economic and financial systems are built upon this ""retardation,"" and little to nothing has changed since the unearthing of these flaws.  But, all of that aside, my favorite thing about Taleb is his relentless and fearless ability to call anyone and everyone out on their bullshit, as well as his endorsement and promotion of erudition & autodidacticsm."

I've only read Black Swan and didn't find it interesting, and almost everyone I've asked who are self-proclaimed Taleb fans seem to hold very strong opinions without having studied much of the things he criticizes, hence my characterization.  E.g. I have friends who work at banks building models with these extra precautions built in, but especially after the Crisis it seems to have gone two steps back, where their superior might be some hot-headed jock who read Black Swan over the weekend and decides that all the improved volatility measures are mathematical bullshit and regresses back to a super simple, trailing X-day measure.        I still have my suspicions that he's more marketer than investor, but that's a point of contention that will continue exist until he actually reveals his returns.  Will look into Antifragility now that you've mentioned it."
financialindependence,3dlt9w,Asparachucks,2,Fri Jul 17 20:41:13 2015 UTC,There are ways of using leverage to tailor your risk profile. I've been thinking lately about the cost of insuring my net worth with long-term put options.
financialindependence,3dlt9w,fyoumoney,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:22 2015 UTC,Would you mind going into a bit more detail?
financialindependence,3dlt9w,Asparachucks,3,Fri Jul 17 21:15:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, I mean there's infinitely many ways of reducing your downside risk. You could purchase long-term put options on VTI at say 75% of current price. Then depending on your preference, either treat that insurance as a direct expense, or pay for it out of interest income by taking out a margin loan, or pay for it out of upside potential by selling long-term call options.  To increase upside potential is a little trickier. You can look into LEAPS, or just take Taleb's advice and hold enough cash to buy the extreme downturn. I'm not sure I'd want to do any of this, though, because these approaches necessarily mean sacrificing average annual return for a long shot at huge returns. I don't want to maybe get rich; I want to definitely get reasonably semi-rich."
financialindependence,3dlt9w,soupcxan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:00:34 2015 UTC,What would the annual cost be as a % of portfolio value to continually roll over out of the money VTI puts? Doesn't it become pretty expensive insurance over the long run?
financialindependence,3dlt9w,Asparachucks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"That depends on how far out of the money you are willing to go. In principle, the EMH says leveraging such as this only reduces your expected return by the transaction costs, not the options costs. Of course, your faith in the EMH may vary. So far the only thing stopping me from pursuing this course of action is the bid-ask spread. I'm not sure how to structure my orders to get filled in a reasonable amount of time."

financialindependence,3dlt9w,fist2,6,Fri Jul 17 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"401k contributions reduce your MAGI, so unless you have other income you should be able to get below the $61k.

financialindependence,3dlt9w,arborite,3,Fri Jul 17 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"The argument for Roth is that tax rates could become higher by the time that you withdraw. For example, if you are in the 15% tax bracket and putting money into a traditional IRA, if we were to move to a 20% flat tax, you'd be increasing your taxes on that money by 5%.  I generally disagree with this speculation, though, as I find it hard to imagine a situation where 30-40k gets taxed at above a 15% effective rate. It would take a huge increase to rates and a decrease to the standard deduction to make that happen.  The other thing is that, if you are single, you're in the 25% tax bracket. I would so it is exceedingly unrealistic to expect taxes to jump that high. Some people still suggest Roth IRAs in that situation, which, unless you really don't have a deductible IRA available to you, I think is completely illogical."

You will take a hit as the current bonds you hold lose value with rising interest rates, but in the end your new bond holdings will have much better returns, and normally you're in bonds for the long haul."
financialindependence,3dneku,TheAlexWhite,10,Fri Jul 17 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is possible. Of course.   Let's see, some resources:   Econowiser, especially the older posts for me, the newer ones are more about her family life.   Nomorewaffles. Belgian guy, and a bit too much into dividend investing for my taste, but he is really making it happen, savings-wise, and at an early age, too.   Rube on a forum, he is in his thirties and really on his way to early retirement.   There's also Henk  who is also Dutch and in his forties and almost retiring; he worked as an expat for most of his life.   Finally: me. I'm also trying to get there. But I don't think I'm as good an example just yet, I'm like only 25% to 33% of the way there and I also won't get there until I'm in my forties.   In short, YES, definitely possible. Spend less, save more, use tax-friendly options if possible (not as much as in the US), on the other hand: enjoy the fact that health care is much cheaper and health care costs are way more predictable than in the US."

financialindependence,3dneku,Smartare,2,Sat Jul 18 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. In the Netherlands we're taxed on how much you earn. 36% on the first 20k, 42% on the money between 20k and 58k and 52% above 58k a year. When you retire, at 67, you probably have less income and therefore pay less taxes.  A social system like the one we have makes healthcare easy and improves the quality of life for all citizens. but it also means that living a life of luxury or FI/RE is either not attainable or takes some serious planning. Normal employment certainly isn't going to get me there, given salaries are too low.. Reading on this sub has made that clear to me."

financialindependence,3dneku,newredditcauseangela,2,Sat Jul 18 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the Ductchs are socialist since socialism refers to the state owning the means of production and well that is not really the case there (not more than in the US at least).   The taxes are higher but the cost of living can be lower (less cost for healthcare, etc). You can't make a general statement that it is always ""much harder"" because it depends on the individual circumstances. For example where I live its possible to pay much lower taxes than someone in the US normally pays and healthcare, schooling, university, etc are free.   Therefore for some people they might end up with a higher savings rate than they would in the US. It depends on the individual situation.   Is the welfare and redistribution policies bad for the whole economy? Yes. But that doesn't mean that it will always be ""much harder"" to achieve FI in Europe."

Paying something because you feel that doing otherwise is unethical will not change anything."
financialindependence,3dmkd0,newredditcauseangela,13,Sat Jul 18 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"If you feel it is unethical because other people are too poor to afford healthcare, why don't you take the subsidies and volunteer to provide some of that healthcare yourself? Many hospitals / hospices / home care organizations (e.g., ""Meals on Wheels"") take, or even depend, on volunteers. In this way you could give back to directly help those people while also following the laws just the way you are meant to.  If your issue is poor people without proper healthcare, then address that issue personally and directly. If you leave ""more money in the healthcare subsidy pot"" in my opinion that small amount of extra money each year will not be used anywhere near as efficiently or be able to make anywhere near the relative impact to address your issue of poor people without proper healthcare than you personally doing things to address it."
financialindependence,3dmkd0,rokuk,15,Fri Jul 17 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, the subsidies are not meant for the poor.  Look at the income caps, they go well into middle class territory, and if you make too little you don't qualify for subsidies.  If you're in the group legally defined as poor (below poverty line) you get no subsidies, you get Medicaid.  Obamacare was meant as a handout to the middle and working classes.  Second, while you are employed, you pay taxes to fund government.  And by saving for retirement, you reduce the amount of resources you take from society.  So, while you're working, you have the double whammy of producing a lot for society and taking little from society.  The reason you are willing to do that is because later you will be able to take more and produce less.  Third, the ACA was touted by its proponents, including Obama, as helping to foster financial independence.  They put it in slightly different words (encouraging entrepreneurship, reducing employment lock-in, patronizing the arts, helping older folks retire), but the ideas are the same.  So, it's my contention that the ACA was designed to help you and that it's quite alright to use a government program for the uses it was designed and that you paid into.  Now, you can certainly argue that the ACA is a bad design, but that's different from saying that you aren't using it in the way it was intended.  Lastly, you're making the assumption that you will produce nothing in retirement.  Maybe that's the case.  Maybe you just want to sit on the beach for 50 years.  But, personally, I think most of us will find different ways of contributing after FIRE, whether through entrepreneurship, creative endeavors, or charitable works."
financialindependence,3dmkd0,elindbe2,6,Fri Jul 17 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"I would really like to be able to use the subsidies, but I won't if I don't think it's the right thing to do. Has anybody else struggled with this?   Just realize, like many subsidies, there will be strong political pressure to reduce the COLA below inflation to slowly reduce how much that threshold is in real dollars.  I wouldn't rely on it as part of my retirement planning unless it was Medicare which has a massive, broad political support for 50+ years.   That said, I'd take the subsidy but I suspect you may be mistaken in your ability to qualify for it.  http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=&zip=&income-type=dollars&income=30000&employer-coverage=0&people=1&alternate-plan-family=individual&adult-count=1&adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=30&adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&child-count=0&child-tobacco=0  On a gross of $30,000 a year [which I'm assuming is the goal] you'd get $37/month in subsidy. To qualify for a 100% subsidy, legally, that puts you on Medicaid [not the Health Exchange] and you get no subsidy. Just fyi."
financialindependence,3dmkd0,AlexanderNigma,2,Fri Jul 17 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"I saw a post that said to maximize your subsidy your income should be 138% of the poverty level, which is about $16,200. At that income the subsidy would cover my premiums, and as long as I stay healthy that'd be the bulk of my healthcare costs for most of my retirement. If the COLA adjustment goes down, I can adjust my income accordingly. I can make my income pretty much whatever I want unless the market has an unbelievable year, in which case I wouldn't complain about losing some subsidies."
financialindependence,3dmkd0,AlexanderNigma,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"Use the calculator, it isn't $0.  At $16,200 using the US Average...   If I control my income to maximize the healthcare subsidies, that number goes to $0 pretty much forever (it's pointless to calculate too far into the future, since the law will likely change in the coming decades).   Estimated financial help: $200 per month ($2,397 per year) as a premium tax credit. This covers 81% of the monthly costs.  Your cost for a silver plan: $45 per month ($545 per year) in premiums (which equals 3.36% of your household income)."

You are just responding to the incentives they have put in place.  And part of the reason for those incentives is to get younger people (who might not get insurance at all) to get insurance.  That being said, I wouldn't want to depend on those incentives.

financialindependence,3dmkd0,vhalros,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:10 2015 UTC,"Subsidies aren't meant for the poor at all.  You qualify up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level.  In other words, you can be 4x richer than the federally determined level that constitutes poor.  In our case, we could earn over $100,000 and still receive massive subsidies.  Hard to call that ""poor"", even in a county where the median household income is almost $70,000.   And technically it's a tax credit.  Do you refuse to accept tax credits for the Earned Income Credit? Child Tax Credit?  Retirement Savers Contribution Credit?  Mortgage interest deduction?     If you qualify, take it.  I also don't see a problem with crafting your income stream to maximize your subsidies."

The laws may change. People may need to get net worth tested to receive subsidies. Countless changes to the laws could happen or Obamacare could even get repealed entirely.

If you're somewhere with a million+ people basic goods like that are not going to differ substantially. There are probably more shops in NYC, but there's also more people and more traffic, resulting in similar access and demand. If access wasn't similar, someone else would open a shop and jump on that opportunity. Capitalism and all that.   If the coasts of CA have free beaches but Kansas has none and you have to drive 1000 miles to get to the nearest beach, is Kansas really cheaper than CA?   Yes, Kansas is really cheaper than CA. All of these examples are just saying ""Hey, but there are things here that aren't there!"" Sure - but the opposite holds true too. There's plenty you can't do in NYC that you can do in KC. Maybe your values mean that you prefer NYC. Nothing wrong with that, but it costs more. It absolutely costs more. If I move to NYC I don't ""gain"" the monetary difference in other non-monetary ways or my values would dictate moving. I would get paid more though - as an adjustment for the fact that each dollar doesn't go as far (the point of the graph).   If you have no good universities and have to pay out-of-state tuition to send your kids to a good school, is your ""low COL"" home state really cheaper?   Plenty of fantastic schools are in low COL areas. Missouri - your example - has Washington University. And all states with ivy league schools have low COL areas you can commute from.  Seems like you are trying to turn the fact that COL differences exist into a ""My state is better than your state"" argument. So far your examples are failing - but even in general I don't see the point of trying to put one set of preferences above another.

You can make that up in happiness if you enjoy NYC or certain goods are exceptions to the norm, but on an average basis the point is the same.  If your values still make you want to live in NYC, go for it. I'm saying one state is not outright better than the other. But on average, one is cheaper.

At our favorite sushi place in our small town, we can feed 4 people for the same cost as our favorite sushi place in the Chicago suburbs, which cost about half of what it cost in the other cities all at the same quality.   ""buying a home in a neighborhood with crime rating of X and school rating Y and clean air rating Z and ethnic makeup W""   Haha.

I value economic access to single family homes, having a large enough yard to garden, landscape, and have outbuildings for a shop or garden shed, being able to see stars at night, and a quiet, safe place to raise my family.

Customers aren't going to care if their widget is made in SF or middle of nowhere.  Jobs that are local services would be more likely to pay more or less depending on location.
financialindependence,3djlqw,redberyl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"The key word is cost of living. Rent, utilities, groceries, gas, insurance, childcare (i.e all the necessities) will be far more expensive in high COL areas like California. The fact that you can buy a phone on Amazon for the same price anywhere in the country is largely irrelevant from a budgeting perspective."
financialindependence,3djlqw,pyrrhotechnologies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"disagree on groceries and insurance (I pay $32/month for geico and $720/year for hazard insurance on my $400k house), but agree on the others.  Utility rates are much higher but since the environment is so temperate, they still end up being a pretty small portion of your budget.  Gas is a bit more, but most people take public transit instead which isn't cheap either, but probably cheaper than driving.    The two that actually make a real difference are taxes and housing.  But there are still ways to hack the housing cost, so taxes are the real problem and they are unavoidably outrageous in CA.  Even still, I believe the higher incomes easily make up for it except for in a few places such as Seattle."

financialindependence,3diu4q,vhalros,8,Thu Jul 16 16:59:30 2015 UTC,Most of those accounts don't avoid taxes they defer them. Tax-advantaged is more correct.
financialindependence,3diu4q,unusedusername3,6,Thu Jul 16 17:19:59 2015 UTC,Right that's exactly how I feel. Avoiding something kind of sounds like you're dodging it when in reality there are no taxes to dodge in the first place as these accounts are tax advantaged.

People need to get an accountant to help them or otherwise do their own due diligence to avoid paying taxes that they don't have to pay.  What you redefined it to mean is something entirely different.  It's possible to avoid taxes with a lot of things like home offices, depreciation of assets, etc.. The FAQ used certain savings accounts as examples, but that is not the end all and be all of tax avoidance.  Edit Definition:  Tax avoidance is the legal usage of the tax regime to one's own advantage to reduce the amount of tax that is payable by means that are within the law."
financialindependence,3diu4q,GasStationSushi,4,Thu Jul 16 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that this is not only fine, it's the clearest way to phrase it because it uses the technical term to mean exactly what it's referring to. However, given that it is in a FAQ and many people may not be familiar with the phrase already, I can at least see a potential reason to change to something a bit more generic. Maybe ""minimize"" instead of avoid?"

financialindependence,3diu4q,october17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Avoiding taxes just sounds so wrong.       Arranging your affairs in order to legally avoid taxes is definitely not wrong. Illegal tax evasion is wrong. This is the same as arranging your affairs in order to consume less is not wrong, even if it hurts a particular industry. If congress or a state legislature wants to change the rules, they certainly can do so. Then we will follow the new rules.           Use tax-advantaged accounts whenever possible.        Legal tax avoidance encompasses far more than tax-advantaged accounts. Living in a state with low/no state income tax, timing realization of capital gains, allowing capital gains to pile up and never realizing them, 1031 exchanges, etc., are all forms of legal tax avoidance. Even the very concept espoused on this sub is a form of legal tax avoidance because once a person has enough money, if he chooses leisure over more work, the government cannot tax that leisure even though he may feel that his life is improved more by the leisure than by additional income."
financialindependence,3diu4q,redrecon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"Tax avoidance really is the correct term.  This subreddit didn't make it up.  However, if its not just the words you don't like, but the concept, i have an example for you.  When i go to the store and get $18.15 worth of groceries, $18.15 is only the minimum amount they will accept.  Since the government isn't nice enough to send us an itemized bill, we have to determine the minimum tax bill.  Both the store and the government would have no problem if we payed $21.75 for the same thing."
financialindependence,3diu4q,cmunerd,0,Thu Jul 16 20:08:39 2015 UTC,"I believe your rewording makes the statement much more narrow than it should/could be. Tax advantaged accounts are the most common techniques to reduce taxes, but it's really only the tip of the iceberg.  The next level is to look at more advanced tax planning such as: tax loss harvesting, tax gain harvesting, optimizing deductions, characterizations as business expenses, timing of transactions, estate planning, etc."

financialindependence,3dist8,nerdwad,6,Thu Jul 16 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  I'm in my early 30's & have only just barely woken up to the fact that I'm going to need to retire someday, and then started thinking that I could do it earlier with a plan & then discovered this sub-reddit.  I don't know anyone IRL who has done this & have no role models; it just never occurred to me to do anything other than my 401k for the future, as silly as that sounds in hindsight.  So I never had anyone telling me to do this, and nothing ever tripped in my head to spur me into action until now.  I do know many people who make $100k+ a year and are living paycheck to paycheck, so I definitely have a lot more anti-hero examples than examples of what should be done.  Most 'retired' people I know still work some kind of job.  People generally don't even entertain FIRE as a possibility, and you can't take Step 2 if you don't take Step 1, which is deciding you want it & accepting that it's doable.  I'm still very much a newb regarding financial education, but having an open mind does help a lot.  I've managed to convince my wife to get onboard the program as well, which is huge for me because her family background has terrible financial self-talk, i.e. ""we can't afford that"" instead of ""how can we work & plan to afford that?""  Realizing you don't have to follow the same path as everyone else is huge.  If you are willing to work for your dreams & make a plan based proven systems, then FIRE is entirely doable: make a plan, then discipline yourself & work to make it happen.  I would have gone on autopilot for the rest of my life if I hadn't gotten interested in the idea, and I think that's what happens to most people - time marches on, but since they never make a really good, solid plan, they get stuck in a numbers crunch at retirement age.  I certainly don't want that to happen to me.  As far as inspirations, I think it's more about the small tidbits I pick up here & there.  There was a thread over on the ER forum about a guy who sold his second car post-FIRE.  But then someone else posted about how he has like five cars & other toys:  http://www.early-retirement.org/forums/f28/sold-the-second-car-this-evening-77873.html#post1610660  So that made me realize that being frugal doesn't have to be included in your plan if that's not a lifestyle you desire - you can figure out out what you want, make a plan to achieve it, and get to work.  Being thrifty is fine if that's part of your plan, but regarding cars, there's no way I could live on just one because my schedule is entirely different from my wife's schedule, so that post reply helped me make a distinction between penny-pinching as a choice & selected goal rather than a ""this is how it is on FIRE"" type of thing.  Obviously budgeting is relevant to all aspects of early retirement, but you can set pre-selected amounts for your budget & then work to fill the quota required for what you want, rather than being forced to go on the more extreme side of saving money if you don't want to (i.e. recycling, DIY projects, gardening, couponing, etc., which are all fine if that's what you WANT to do in your retirement years).  My hat is definitely off to all of the people who have taken the time to write blogs, create forums, and post & refine tools like the FI/RE FAQ - those people show that it's not only possible in theory, but also in practice because they are living examples of it working IRL."

Also, my mom (in spite of her good financial instincts) has been with this deadbeat guy for over 20 years, and he's always broke.  If they ever broke up, my mom feels good about the fact that she could get him set up somewhere the same way I did for my ex-girlfriend.

He came back after 3 , and at the age of 29 was worth three quarters of a million dollars and was only working because he wanted to get enough to buy his retirement home.  He was killed by a drunk driver and it's part of the reason I push myself to go full FIRE because he never had the chance to live out his dream."

He financed a $6 million movie on his own and no one is really sure where he got the money.  From reading Greg Sestero's book, though, it sounds like he grew up poor in eastern Europe, eventually moved to San Francisco, and worked his way up from a street performer/vendor to the owner of a bunch of discount retail stores.  I just think it's a baller move to spend your fortune making a movie that you wrote, directed and starred in (even if it did turn out terrible).  And it's clearly something he was passionate about."

He'd had a bad 1st tour in the military, and decided to focus his remaining 15 years on Financial Independence, because he never wanted to work again.  This guy and his beautiful Spanish wife lived on less than half his wages for 15 years, and when he retired from the military, at around 40 years old, he moved back to Spain where her family lived.  He was the first person to tell me I needed to know my number. ""How much do you need to live, to retire?""  He said his number was $500,000. When he retired in 2004 or 2005, he had his $500,000, which combined with his military retired pay, gave him around $3500-4000 per month, after taxes, to live on.  Sadly, I never heard from him again. It was sad that he inspired me so much, and I'll never be able to tell him. He never responded to the yahoo email address I used when we worked together, and I've forgotten the name of the small Spanish town where he retired.  He told me there was only one bar in the town, and that's where he'd be. ""Just ask 'Donde vive el americano?'"". I wish I could remember the town, I only know it started with an ""A""."

My pay is very likely more than the value I'm creating for the university--my research won't produce any patents and I don't really bring in much external grant funding. They could replace me with an adjunct who teaches my classes at $5,000 a pop and would probably keep students just as satisfied.

Our family is pretty open about money, but my grandpa is from the time when bonds gave a good return.   My other question is if the reason for the low return is because they are primarily in bonds does it make since to try to move them more towards index funds or should they stay in bonds because of they're age even though it's EXTREMELY likely they never spend the money?

financialindependence,3dho4q,walloon5,33,Fri Jul 17 08:05:37 2015 UTC,"There is a large cohort here that is driving towards a fixed budget of ~$30-40k or less annually. Naturally, their focus is primarily on reducing expenses. It's the classic MMM mentality that reducing expenses is more powerful than increasing earnings, because your requirements go down and your savings rate goes up.  For those of us on the coasts, these absolute $ figures tend to be less relevant. Some of us even focus more on earning power than expense reduction. (Gasp!)  I am very aware that there are different pathways to FI, I just wish people were more accommodating of diversity. Lately there seems to be a backlash against anyone on the coasts (or high earners generally) as being frivolous spenders or shameless consumerists. Perhaps some are, but I don't think it's helpful or productive to pass judgment in this way.    When linking me to the new /r/leanfire subreddit, someone characterized it as focusing on ""more appropriate lifestyles"" for someone who retires early (vs what that user perceives as inappropriate lifestyles proliferating in the main FI sub).   I am glad there is a place for those focused only on expense reduction to congregate. I am also grateful for this sub, because financial independence is not inherently about total rejection of consumerism, expense reduction at any cost, or a single ""right"" way of structuring one's lifestyle."
financialindependence,3dho4q,bonefish,16,Fri Jul 17 22:20:37 2015 UTC,Planning to retire in a High CoL area gives you great flexibility as well. You have more options if you decide to move during retirement. If I can afford to retire here in the Bay Area I can probably retire anywhere in the US.
financialindependence,3dho4q,ChronicElectronic,8,Thu Jul 16 11:25:34 2015 UTC,"This is a good point that often gets missed.  Often (not usually in the finance subs where people are knowledgeable) I read things like ""Oh I make 1.5-2x than you do but I live in a high COL area so it evens out"".  While that is true to some extent, especially in the immediate present when it comes to purchasing power, money is still absolute.  500k saved up is still 500k and you have more options."
financialindependence,3dho4q,StrahansToothGap,6,Thu Jul 16 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"I always thought this same thing. As someone who works in NYC and makes about double what I would somewhere else -- yes, housing and food/drinks are much more expensive in NYC, but still, it's probably just around double...So if my salary is double, my rent is double, and my grocery bill is double, I'm still spending the same amount of my paycheck on these expenses. Yet, if I'm SAVING 20% of my paycheck, this is twice as much as it would be living & working somewhere else.  The ideal situation IMO (and what I may or may not end up doing) is while you're young to work in a high CoL but also high paying area (NYC), saving aggressively, allowing yourself to save an insane amount of money in absolute terms, then when it's time to start a family or retire or whatever floats your boat, move to a lower cost of living area with all of that money in the bank."
financialindependence,3dho4q,fyoumoney,3,Thu Jul 16 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"While I agree in general, I think taxes play a huge role here. In high CoL areas, you spend more percentage on taxes as you would in other areas, which is why it is hard to calculate the time to retire in a low cost area."

financialindependence,3dho4q,--int,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:17:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like 401k will help a lot with that since it cuts from your marginal tax rate if you are considering federal taxes.  If it is a significant portion of your savings, it probably helps out a lot, but if it is a small portion or you can't make use of all of it, it doesn't help out that much.

financialindependence,3dho4q,the-axis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"That's a great point, higher tax rates definitely do play a role, but do you think it's really a ""huge"" role?  Quick Example: As a software engineer in NYC, I'm making 100k. Let's say I get 70k for something similar in IN. In NY I'll be paying $5.6k in state income tax, and in IN I'll be paying $2.3k.  So that's a difference of $3.3k in taxes.  If we are on the road to FIRE, let's say our savings rate is somewhere in the ballpark of 40%.  That's $40k on the NYC salary, and $28k on the IN salary. Which is a difference of $12k. Subtract the $3.3k extra in taxes and we're saving $8.7k more in NYC than in IN.  EDIT: Hey /u/--int, I actually realized a flaw in the way I calculated the state income tax in that other post, which threw off the analysis entirely, so I deleted it.  EDIT 2: Ah, see that you were thinking federal. Sorry, I just immediately thought state because we're talking about CoL/location. Too late & tired to rethink everything considering federal.

I can now save a good amount while maintaining a spending level that works very well for us that would be considered wasteful by others. This type of thinking is less popular on this sub because increasing income can be realized to different extents by different individuals.

This continues for some time until the idea is so popular and so well-proven that the newest joiners are really not inquisitive at all, but are people looking for well-defined answers to a particular problem.    They believe they’ve found it in this idea, so they invest emotionally in the idea.  This, to them, entails defending the idea.  This is fine, except that this latter group don’t really understand the idea (or even want to), how it came about, its objectives, limitations, and permutations.  They see the interpretation they chose to fit their situation, and nothing more.    This latter group are also the most vociferous – the most confident that their view, and only their view, is correct.    Thus, the interpretation of the loudest and most confident group becomes the interpretation heard by anyone who hasn’t yet subscribed to the view.  Thus these potential newcomers (who are even less adventurous than even the previous group) tend to be overexposed to this single permutation of the idea.  After a while, this interpretation becomes ‘the definition’ of the idea, and an orthodoxy is born and defended in a noisy, combative, aggressive way and all the subtlety and in-depth understanding of the original idea and its early proponents is lost to most followers or would-be followers of what is by now basically a faith."

However, to me, I can't imagine spending more than 40k/year in retirement. My plan is to have the mortgage and all other debt paid off, so once you remove those from our budget, my wife and I spend less than 30k/year. Throw in some for taxes, insurance, and general savings for big events and you're at 40k/year. The thing is that I can't imagine wanting to spend more than that. It's not that I am so much criticizing you for doing so, I just can't wrap my head around it without buying things just to say that I have them.  I don't know if that was what happened in that specific case, but it seems reasonable to me that a lot of the people that present this point of view are of the same mindset as me."

financialindependence,3dho4q,twfu,3,Thu Jul 16 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"I pay for travel mostly with points and the little bit that I pay for out of pocket is included in that 30k.  As for hobbies, again, I can't really think of any that would require a significant increase in yearly expenses. That doesn't mean that they aren't valid. I suppose it could have some form of collectible aspect to it, but that would fall under the ""buying things just to say that I have them"" aspect in my mind."
financialindependence,3dho4q,arborite,5,Thu Jul 16 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"Any hobby that requires something with a motor is generally expensive. Boating, dirtbiking, cars, motorcycles, etc. There are also hobbies like golfing which require memberships. You can do many of the hobbies on the ""cheap"" without buying all new equipment and spending money wisely but they are just not cheap when compared to something like biking or hiking.  International or extensive travel is also generally relatively expensive. Again you can do it for relatively cheap but if you are gone for long periods of time it is still going to add up."
financialindependence,3dho4q,Internally_Combusted,2,Thu Jul 16 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that it can be cheaper, or at least cheaper by the day, if you travel for longer periods of time."
financialindependence,3dho4q,twfu,3,Thu Jul 16 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"To a point.    If travel to and from your destination is expensive, but lodging and food while there are cheap (example: Thailand), a longer stay reduces your per-day costs.  If travel is cheap, but lodging and food are expensive (example: road trip to Colorado during ski peak season), a longer stay doesn't really reduce your per-day cost.  If travel is expensive, and lodging and food are expensive (example: Bora Bora), all we know is that you're spending the bucks.  Basically, staying longer amortizes your to/from travel costs over more days.  That may or may not matter much, depending."
financialindependence,3dho4q,synackrst,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"See, I don't know how much those cost. It seems to me that they'd be  largely a one-time cost in buying the vehicle with relatively low recurring costs. Then, you either keep it forever or sell. I suppose if your hobby is to restore cars, your initial cost would be more spread out, but you'd be selling at the end unless you are also collecting. Again, I'm just shooting in the dark at those, though.  Golfing is one that I could see costing a decent amount if you went every day, but is there a way to buy a yearly membership or something like that? I haven't golfed in quite some time, so I don't really know the prices.  As for travel, I think it's likely how you plan on doing it. If you're going to continue paying rent while you're gone as well as pay for rent abroad and then eat out every day, yea that will add up. What I've seen a lot of people do is sell their house/cancel their lease and then ""move"" to those other countries for a few weeks or months at a time before moving on. It ends up being cheaper than staying at home."
financialindependence,3dho4q,arborite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"For golfing I can't really provide any clarity because I just don't golf. I have just heard from those that do that it can be expensive. I am sure there are ways to do it cheaper.   I think you are right on with traveling. It can definitely be done on the cheap but many people just don't want to be away from home that long. I also like to do things when I travel that may cost a little bit of money. I went canyoning in Italy and rock climbing in Alaska for instance. These activities require a guide and rented safety equipment. I mean could I bring my own equipment and go unguided? I am sure I could but I am not an avid rock climber or canyoneer so I don't think the investment would have been worth it and guides tend to make the experience much more enjoyable and safer since they know the area. I like jumping off cliffs, climbing things, and any number of other things that get my adrenaline going. These things almost always cost money which add more to the travel budget.  I am a motorsports guy so I can chime in on those. Boating is just plain expensive which is why I do not own one. The water is harsh and they generally need a lot of maintenance. If you can't store the boat on your own property then the costs really go up. I am a big car guy and I like to bring my car to the track. You can buy a fully prepped track rat car like a spec miata for about $7k. Once you make it to instructor you can get free or substantially cheaper track time. You can camp at many tracks so you don't need a hotel room and you could potentially cook your own food onsite with a little grill or something as well. I have also been able to snag free tires from racers who don't use them all the way because they lose grip and would not be competitive (this is a huge cost reduction). However, even with all of these measures to cut costs it is still not a cheap hobby. Things break and I have to replace them. I also need a second vehicle (truck) and a trailer to tow the car to the track. The truck and the trailer have to be registered and the truck has to be insured. Gas for both the track car and the tow vehicle is also not cheap since neither vehicle is particularly fuel efficient. If you track motorcycles you will have many of the same costs.  Restoring cars or fixing them up can be hit or miss depending on how good you are at calling the market price and how cheaply you can get parts. Tools for these things are also not cheap. While they are generally a one time purchase there are always new tools you end up needing.  The point of all this is really just that it is very easy for many people to spend more money in such a way that maximizes their happiness and provides them with everlasting memories without them acquiring stuff just to own it."

I had a huge project at work the last 6 months, so I couldn't take much time off, but my wife and I are going to the Dominican in August, my dad and I are going to Utah in September, my wife and I are going to Hawaii in January, and I imagine that we'll probably take a trip to see some friends in the last quarter of the year.

financialindependence,3dho4q,arborite,7,Thu Jul 16 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I live in a high COL area currently, so I can't get my costs down without drastic and negative consequences. However, in my case, since I'm single, I'll try to keep my income in the 15% federal tax bracket when I retire (to get 0% taxation on capital gains). To achieve that, I'm looking at around 45-50K (max), which is admittedly low for a high COL area. So, I'm thinking that since I also want to travel at least 6 months out of the year after retirement, I should probably move to a lower COL area after retiring to be able to live within that low of a range and still be eligible for 0% cg taxes."

In ""investing"" if you recommend buying an actual stock you are labeled as reckless for not worshipping at the Vanguard altar.  In frugal they actually have discussions about making your own soap.  How much does soap cost, $29.99?  Trying to enforce your style, your method on others never works.  And if you are heading to the same goal does it matter that you showed up on a skateboard and I showed up on a bike?  We are all different and what works for you may not work for me.  I totally understand your reference to the coast.  I live in Texas (don't pity me) and my 4 bedroom, 2 story duplex might fetch $270-290 this Spring if I decide to sell it.  The same space a similar neighborhood in DC would cost me at least $3/4M.  We have no income tax, that is a significant consideration when I think about relocating.    My best friend lives in MD outside of DC.  Her maybe 1000 sq. ft. house is assessed at $489k.  In Silver Spring the cost of food is also high, I've stayed there for a month.  There is no competition and prices are high.  As much as I would like to move close to my friend, I can't afford to live there.  In my current situation $35k is more than enough to not only live well but travel as much as I want.  Remember my $35k is not the same as your $35k.  I'm not paying taxes.  They don't take 1/3 of my check each month, I get it all.    I believe in living beneath your means but l also believe that life is about experiences not financial goals.

That said, I'm talking about grocery prices here. It's about $4 for a 4-oz back of basil (two meals' worth of pesto, not counting pine nuts and olive oil or pasta or garlic). $6-$8/pound of heirloom tomatoes (not organic), which we use for salads, veggie burgers, pasta caprese, etc. $1.2-$4/pound of apple, depending on where you go, obviously we try to get the cheaper kind. $1-$2/pound of orange. Avocados and lemons aren't cheap either. $.75/lemon. Costco has a 5-pack of avocado we get every time we go. We are trying to grow our own herbs and tomatoes this year, because the price is so expensive. But multiply it out to all the fresh produce we eat. We juice for breakfast and cook dinner, with leftovers for lunch.  We eat salads, so that means extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Or blue cheese (really, Gorgonzola) to make the blue cheese dressing. There's cheddar with the enchiladas. Parmesan for the pasta and pizza (yes, home made). The cheap brand at Costco just got discontinued, so now we have to buy genuine Parmesan. Mozarella for caprese, about $4/meal's worth. Goat cheese for the chard and goat cheese. Sometimes, you just want a small $7 wheel of Brie, to bake and eat with your fresh sourdough bread. Green olive oil when you want the fresh taste, and fermented olive oil when you don't. Rice bran oil for cooking with high heat. Safflower oil for baking cakes, $7 or $8 for a little bottle that lasts about 4 or 5 cakes. Balsamic vinegar for most foods, but you want nice balsamic vinegar if you're not cooking it (no, we don't go for the $40 bottles). Chinese vinegar to eat with dumplings. Japanese rice vinegar for eating Japanese food. Apple cider vinegar for milder tastes. White vinegar for faking buttermilk and other applications, and for cleaning. And usually we have a drinking vinegar. Last bottle was Thai basil. Currently we have a blackberry vinegar. These cost about $20/bottle and can last a few months if I'm not too gluttonous.  We already make our own kefir (we do buy organic milk, which is about $6/gallon here, but even non organic is about $4/gallon). Kefir grain is free, obviously.  Flour is cheap, so we try to make our own bread. But if we forget, then we get the fresh bread from the grocery store, which is about $6-$8/loaf. Or if we want burger buns, it's about $6 for a pack of 4 (I think). But even for flour, only white flour is cheap (which we buy in 50 pound bags). Then we have to keep whole wheat flour and corn flour for other baking projects.  About the only thing that's cheap in the US is meat, but we're vegetarian at home. (Husband is vegetarian, I'm not.) We drink occasionally, and buy a case of apple cider every other month or so. We go costco shopping and use up all the oranges, garlic, carrots, and onions we buy, before they go bad. But then you're committed to eating bulk, which is not always practical for produce. We also try to buy things only when they're in season, but you still have to eat something when it's winter.  Also, I like baking, and butter is expensive. Costco only sells salted butter, and they don't work for most of the recipes I do. Or if it's a sponge cake and not a butter cake, then it calls for anywhere form 6-10 eggs. A dozen eggs costs about $5 here. So you figure a cake costs probably about $3-$10 in ingredients, and I bake one or two a week. (Yes, I like my sweets.)  Then there's chocolate. Chocolate chips for cakes and cookies. Eating chocolate for a snack with bread. Bittersweet and semisweet chocolate for making chocolate cakes, chocolate truffles, and drinking chocolates. I buy them bulk when I can, but they are still $6-12/pound or something like that.  This is before you get into all the spices. You can't do real cooking/baking unless you have an assortment of spices and sauces.  And we're only talking about feeding two people."

That aside, I'm not complaining. I'm pointing out a fact. I'm still going to be FI by 31, so I don't think I'm doing badly.  But yes, I suspect in a lower cost of living area, especially if we can grow more of the cash crops (tomatoes, herbs, spinach, etc), we would be able to save $4000/year on food. If we were in the EU (no import tax on oil, vinegar, and cheese, and cheaper produce), we'd probably save $6000/year on food. These are not negligible numbers."

For example, a 2012 Congressional Budget Office study found that the effective marginal rate for a single parent with one child can be as high as 95%.   Note that that was with the temporary 2% cut in social security taxes still in place, so the number now is more like 97%.  Once you factor in state programs, the number can go over 100%.  Married couples with kids in certain income bands had similar rates.   The childless, whether single or married, have a less pronounced effect.  If you feel like reading dense, wonkish discussion of these sorts of things, here's the CBO's study: https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43722-Supplemental_Material-MarginalTaxRates.pdf  Or, just start looking at the graphs on page 13 and beyond."

financialindependence,3dho4q,nonskanse,3,Thu Jul 16 16:53:06 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if the wise FI minds might think I'm making a mistake.  My husband and I have good incomes, but we are not currently maxing our 401ks (never have) because we dump a lot of money into real estate.  We have three houses- two we rent, one we live in.  This has worked out well for us because our neighborhood has greatly increased in value, and I think it will continue a bit more (gentrification).  However, it also scares me because our diversification is pretty out of whack (probably around 70% in RE equity, 23% retirement accounts, 5% cash, 2% car equity).  So, a year ago, instead of putting new tenants into one of the properties, we decided to move there, remodel it for two years, and then sell it.  We took out a line of credit because we didn't think we'd be able to cash flow the whole thing, but it's actually been kind of slow going and we haven't had to dip into it yet.    Our incomes have grown a lot lately and now we're in a place where we're definitely going to be paying some taxes in the 25% bracket.  I think this means we could be making a mistake by not switching to maxing our 401ks (currently just enough to get the match + fully funding Roth IRAs). But, the idea of relying more on a variable rate HELOC is scary to me, even though we're maintaining a reasonable efund as well.  Other options would be delaying the remodeling or not doing it at all.  Delaying would make me crazy because 10+ years of tenants living in a victorian house does not result in a nice place to live.  We're doing some of the work ourselves and I think we should get a good ROI on the money we spend, which is something I'm very careful about.  Our neighborhood is getting fancy and a house on our block just sold for 200k more than we bought this one for, and I estimate it's worth 100k less than that without further repairs.  Thoughts?"
financialindependence,3dho4q,puddingfox,4,Thu Jul 16 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"You mention both that you're uncomfortable being so invested in RE and in not having cash flow. If the return on your marginal dollars that would be taxed at 25% is better with the remodel, go with that. If it's better with the 401k, you're going to need to evaluate comfort vs returns. Risk tolerance is very personal."

There's a duplex for sale in our town currently for sale for $150k. They come up very rarely in our city--I've been watching sporadically for awhile. It's been on the market for almost 30 days. I'm hoping that when it hits the 30 day mark they'll lower the price. I do think it's a bit overpriced for the market, in terms of what other houses are going for. But in terms of what they get for rent (1% rule would be $1500/mo in rent = $150k house) I bet they're pretty close. We bought a duplex nearly two years ago for $100k. Similar condition and size.

Once you have maxed out all the tax advantaged accounts and still have extra money to put away, it goes in the brokerage account. Just toss it in there. When you are older, you will not need to withdraw as much money out of your accounts because of the RMD's.  Also why not put your money fully in tIRA and 401k? How much do you think you might live on later in life (in today's dollars)? The way I see it, if you put money in roth accounts now, you may not get the ""advantage"" as much later because you already have larger RMD's from the inherited account. If you use traditional now, you instantly get to defer those taxes."

Could you elaborate further on what you mean by this: ""The way I see it, if you put money in roth accounts now, you may not get the ""advantage"" as much later because you already have larger RMD's from the inherited account"".     Also, I know a lot of reason people choose tIRA or t401k is because they can do a roth conversion ladder once they ER and with a standard deduction, they can basiclly convert a large amount tax free.  With the RMD's, I lose that ability since the taxable income there will take up most of my deduction.  Correct?  The tax part is my hangup that I am having trouble understanding.  All the examples I find of using Roth Conversions ladders or SEPP's never have to factor in taxable income."

Some things to consider:   You said the RMDs in your 60s will be in the $20k -$30k range. Is that in present value? Or are in real value 40 years from now. You should assume tax brackets will change so if you are talking about real value, that may still be comfortably in the lowest bracket. And your laddering option would still be possible. Under current rules, these distributions will count as income if you're ever trying to get financial aid for college tuition (presumably for your kids). You're doing a great job maxing all of your tax-advantaged accounts, and everything else is on the right path.

financialindependence,3djpl8,enkrypt0r,5,Thu Jul 16 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"Some bad info in this thread. I actually DO this, with Vanguard, and have for years.  You can contribute the same amount to your solo 401k as an employee as you would be able to as an employee of any other company. So $18k for 2015. And these contributions can be Roth if your 401k provides that option (Vanguard does). You must have at least this much income (can't make $10k and contribute $18k).  THEN you can make contributions as an employer of 20-25% of your ""profits"", and how much exactly depends on what type of business you have. If just sole proprietor, it's 20% and complicated as to how you get that number :)  The total of the two cannot exceed $53k in 2015. But because of the employer side being only 20-25% of your profit, you can't contribute the max unless you have like $150-200k in profit.  As for deadlines, yes, you can absolutely do what you're suggesting. Contributions can be made up to the filing deadline. And it's actually the filing deadline, with extensions. So I extend my return every year, giving me until Oct 15 to contribute to retirement (and reduce my taxable income) for the previous year.  However, you must have opened the plan by Dec 31.  More here: http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/One-Participant-401(k)-Plans And here: https://investor.vanguard.com/what-we-offer/small-business/individual-401k  Other plans like SIMPLE and SEP might be a better fit.

financialindependence,3djpl8,DocNightOwl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:38:23 2015 UTC,"Your comment here is spot on.  However, just to clarify -- OP needs to consider what amount of contribution he or she made to 401k in regular job. That reduces the amount of employee contributions able to be made in the solo 401k.  If OP has no regular job, then it is as you do: you can make employee and employer contributions in the Solo 401k according to the limits you described.  The Vanguard calculator OP is using suggests $4646 can be contributed. This would not be an employer contribution (it's too much) but could be done as employee contribution. But only if OP had not made more than $13354 in 401k contributions at regular 401k. (Or $4646 could be contributed, by characterizing $929 as employer contribution and rest as employee contribution.)  My conclusion is that the Vanguard calculator is presuming the person with Solo 401k has no other job with a 401k. Just something to watch out for.  I really recommend OP use Pub 560 Chapter 5 worksheet to verify the amount they put on their 1040 line 28. It's far safer to do that than rely on Vanguard's rough calculator, which doesn't have an input for how much was contributed by taxpayer to other 401ks."

So, you can contribute in one go, instead of in regular increments, but the last day to contribute is December 31.  As for how much you can contribute, in 2015, you can put in 25% of your profits, up to 53K. This means, usually, at the minimum, you need to subtract employer/employment taxes, any operating expenses, employee portion of 401K (18K max in 2015), etc., and then contribute 25% of that to your solo 401K as your employer portion.

financialindependence,3djpl8,cragtar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"https://personal.vanguard.com/us/SbsCalculatorController  It sounds like his business income is low, so up until like $10,000 a SIMPLE allows him to contribute the most. Individual 401k is more after that. SEP IRAs aren't that hot until you're pretty far into the 6 figure area or you have employees."
financialindependence,3djpl8,cragtar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:02:59 2015 UTC,Does a SIMPLE IRA count against your IRA contribution limit?

Or perhaps he just needs more encouragement from those who are already FI. I just discovered the podcasts a couple weeks ago and like listening to them on my commute to work (my bike commute to work is roughly one segment in length).
financialindependence,3dh852,jeremiahs_bullfrog,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:09 2015 UTC,I listened to that one recently - it's a good perspective from someone that didn't earn much but still saved a ton. Plus there's discussion of 72(t) distributions.   And I'd speculate that the lack of episodes has something to do with his recent move to Scotland. I think he mentioned that.
financialindependence,3dh852,MyEgoSays,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:10:03 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I still wish there were more FI podcasts though. I have 4+ hours for podcasts a week on my bike and I'm having to settle a little. I listen to mostly tech & finance podcasts, but most of the finance podcasts are from a traditional retirement perspective.  In any case, I'm grateful for what exists. I know most FI people don't care to spend their time doing podcasts and blogs. Maybe I'll have to step up and contribute some."

financialindependence,3dh852,SteveRD1,5,Thu Jul 16 13:07:11 2015 UTC,"I like his full disclosure. He's really raking in the online income now, but he doesn't pretend otherwise like some other finance bloggers - he shows his numbers each month.  At the same time his ego hasn't swollen, his posts are still pretty modest.  I don't think his online success is changing his approach to FI, it's just allowing him to speed up the process with having more to invest."
financialindependence,3dh852,nckmiz,2,Thu Jul 16 14:23:43 2015 UTC,Yup. I really like his blog. He talks about how much he spends and makes and invests (and in what) month in and month out. Very detailed. He gives you a good idea regarding how much MMM probably makes monthly from his website. If a guy like DM can make 3-5k/month MMM is probably bringing in at least double that.

That inevitably leads to someone complaining about high taxes or someone with a more libertarian lean suggesting that other people don't deserve their money (not that it's really their money in the first place, it's our money, that's why we take it). Meanwhile, more liberal FIers support taxation and think we have a personal obligation to help the society that made us acquire money in the first place. You get the idea."

I can see how it would be seen as slacking, entitled, lazy, or an excuse to treat you unfairly etc. (regardless of actual performance)  With my family, I don't shy away from making certain styles of comments which implies I plan on being FIRE relatively young. The style of comment can be interpreted by whoever hears it to fit their own idea(l) (e.g. one person is into investing so thinks about getting rich via investing, one person hates her job so thinks about the idea of quitting the job and not being in a tight spot, one person has a lot of hobbies and thinks about how great it would be to focus on those....). No need to be explicit with details unless prodded.  With friends, again tailor any conversation to the individual. I'm usually not shy about being truthful or blunt with friends or acquaintances. They all know I count myself among the /r/vandwellers and conversations tend to be pulled into the realm of (financial) ERE concepts. One friend is a bit more mainstream with his approach to FI but we are very open with financial details (investing, raises, bonuses, costs) and that's fun to talk about. Another friend was just like OP's yet we talk about it occasionally and I think he's come around to see my (FIRE) perspective and how I am going about making it a reality.

Unfortunately it's a bit difficult for me as I don't have much of a financial or math background at the present time, and it's easy to get stomped on here when you're a complete newb with no one else to bounce ideas off.  I think it pretty much boils down to reading as much as you can to get the answers you're looking for, making a plan for how you want to setup your lifestyle, and then getting to work on executing that plan until you achieve it.  Managing discipline is definitely a big aspect of it, but I think even moreso is getting really specific about what you want to achieve numbers-wise so that you have something concrete you can plan on & work towards."
financialindependence,3df1q6,nerdwad,2,Fri Jul 17 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"For sure. To build on that point, one good thing about the concept of FI as a whole is that the idea is heavily reliant on math.

Many years ago, I had a friend who was not satisfied with mainstream life.  He also wasn't overly concerned with money, although he did want to have a home & a family.  He took an alternative route & is now a world-famous photographer, gets to travel all the time, has sponsors that pay for everything, and basically does whatever he wants all day (which is shooting photos).  He doesn't practice FIRE, but he's pretty much achieved the lifestyle in terms of freedom & flexibility in his routine.  That was awhile ago & he now mainly teaches (on travel photo safaris, mainly), so he still has an income coming in, but it's pretty low-key in terms of actual work because he just has fun all the time.  Awesome example to me & has motivated me to figure out what I want to do.  Anyway, yeah - the math is pretty clear-cut, so it's not like it's a vague, impossible project to take on."

If it seems silly to you, you should try to try to see it though their perspective a little more.  Being surprised by reality is no credit to your mental models.  The company has to invest in training people for the long term health of the company.  You cutting the maximum amount of time you might stay at the company by 70% will of course impact their calculus of the worth of molding your career.   It's also odd to me the amount of taboo and stigma there is surrounding money in general   The taboo around money isn't for you, at least not yet.  The taboo is perpetuated by people whose wealth makes the people around them resent them for it and ask for handouts.  As you grow wealthier, keep talking about it, see what happens, and you'll probably decide like millions of other wealthy people to play your cards a little closer to the vest."

Actually I want to go back to academia/research without living like a broke college student/employee. That's what I tell people, without going in to details about FI. I don't prop my feet up in the office and say loudly ""yep, only 10 more years in this dump you suckers."" I do have some tact ha.

Like unilaterally every single person in real life reacts badly to that information. Yeah I might eventually do research I guess but honestly being FI would be f-ing amazing because I could just do whatever I want for however long I want.
financialindependence,3df1q6,nopurposeflour,3,Wed Jul 15 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"TBH it's not worth talking about outside of FIRE-friendly (friendly FIRE? lol) places like /r/financialindependence or ER-type forums.  It's tempting to discuss IRL because you're excited about it & want to share your findings & goals, but people are funny about money & since you're doing something that is outside of the mainstream, people get offended by that.  I think that's why there are so many ""millionaires next door"" type of people, because they wise up to the fact that sharing that information is not a smart thing to do.  I think there's also the connotation that you have to be rich to retire early, which isn't necessarily the case depending on your goals.  The best definition I've heard of what being wealthy means is 'how many days into the future you can survive without a job'.  So if you're 60, have a family history of dying at 75, have monthly expenses of $3k, and have ~$550k in the bank/stocks/whatever, then you're technically rich.  So it really all depends on what kind of life you want to live, and advertising the fact that you're either rich or retired (or both) is never a good thing to do to people you can't confide in.  Even family, outside of your SO.  Just go & read some horror stories about what happens when people win the lottery...jealously, entitlement, the works.  It can really mess up your family & relationships with your friends.  I have some friends who are rich (or are the sons of rich guys) and they, more often than not, struggle with finding real friends, especially girlfriends because they never really know if they're liked for them or for their money.   I have a trust fund buddy & he wised up in his twenties - quit showing off the money, bought a nice Honda Accord, a regular house, and eventually ended up marrying a great girl & having a family and a fairly normal life.  He could go buy a mansion if he wanted to & a supercar, but he just keeps it low-key & has avoided a lot of the problems that typically go along with flaunting your wealth.  If showing off is your thing, more power to you, but if you'd like to be fairly anonymous wherever you go & have relationships based on personality rather than money, it's a pretty smart move.  Food for thought."
financialindependence,3df1q6,5np,6,Thu Jul 16 06:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah... bringing that up as a career goal sounds like a terrible idea, you basically told them your career goal is to not have a career."

I never have met a naysayer - well, actually I only have once, when my mom casually mentioned my FI plans to my uncle, and his response was to chuckle at me to my face and say ""He thinks his expenses will remain the same, ha!"" while not bothing to ask about any of the assumptions or plans or any of the thought I've put into it. Thanks Mom and Dad! I only brought it up to them because they're frugal and semi-hippie themselves.

FI and anything money related will be far off the radar with them.  It just seems like work colleagues would be perfect to talk to about this. I mean our relationship is literally working together to make money. I really just didn't expect this reaction from the person I was talking to. He is a really smart, good guy who seems the type to understand and practice these concepts. Seems like even mentioning it as passively as I did was too forward.

I'd love to help out my family & shower them with financial gifts, but you also have to let people carve out their own path & not cripple them in life by trying to be nice.  In some situations it's great, like if your mom needs to be in a nursing home, and in some situations it's bad because you can create dependents - you become their welfare system.  Best advice is exactly what you said - keep it under the radar.  Don't leave financial statements lying around, don't discuss money, just keep it personal - that information is family business, not their business."

If its FI related, it is usually met with a chuckle and an ""OKAY SUURREE"" type of response. That's fine by me. I just chuckle with them and say we'll see. Some of these people are 55-70 years old and will likely never retire. I don't want to convert them or try to tell them that their way of life is wrong/bad/horrible. Its not that black and white. Its easy to get caught up in a lifestyle and condemn others or look down upon others for doing things differently. I never want that to happen to me.   Not everyone is a doubtful naysayer. Others appreciate my input, but I only offer it if solicited. A bunch of my coworkers had been working there for years, but never knew about or understood the ESPP our employer offers.

I told a good friend early on because I thought it could help him but he was weirdly angry about it. People get emotional when you talk about money.   It's honestly pretty tough not to be able to tell friends, and even if/when I do, they can't relate to it. Often my friends are supported by their parents, and will continue to be for a long time probably.

They are shilling the RAFT retirement program.  One of my co-workers who is on his way to FIRE like I am called them up, asking what RAFT would do for him.  He is in his 20s and doing pretty well, good amount saved up in his 401(k) and Roth IRA, puts a good bit into his taxable account.  Anyway, they told him it wasn't possible to retire in your 30s or 40s and live a good life, wished him luck and hung up on him.  They did this on live, on-air.  It was pretty funny because they stopped taking calls on-air after that, least as far as we could tell.  I'm not going to lie when I say he was half serious and half trolling, but still pretty funny.  We'll listen to them for about 15 to 20 minutes every now and then at night while at work, just for the laugh.  Now, that being said, most people that I have mentioned my desire to retire early to have said ""Wish I could do that."" and say they'd never be able to, probably not being able to retire at all.  And, honestly, it's on them to make their choices."

At some point, nursery/school age, the expectation will be for her to pick up her 50% again (something we both agree with). Struggling to articulate here, but the steps could go like this:   Both working to pay 50/50. I work for 100% while she looks after child. I'd have enough to early retire if it was only 50%, but can't afford 100%. She starts work again, whelp I can retire then!

If that's the case, you may not just be able to move people in legally - you do not have an unlimited right to ""roommates"" (there are exceptions for family members and partners). Further, if you sign the lease together with several people, you become co-tenants, and your legal relationship to the property changes (notably, you're not subletting; they have equal standing).  You should read up here: http://www.hrcsf.org/subletting_basic.html"

financialindependence,3dgx6f,nerdwad,3,Thu Jul 16 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't arrange it as a sublease if you expect to stay roughly the same amount of time as they will. Besides the fact that they might expect you to let them crash for free because they ""are poor college students and you can clearly afford to rent a house,"" there's the problem of people leaving at different times, and as the only person on your lease, you'll have to deal with all that. There's also the fact that many rental companies won't let you see the lease until it's time to sign it (because they don't want you to have time to have someone help you review it) so you won't have much time to figure out if you can even sublet.  Try to find others who are in your same boat to room with.  If the school doesn't officially help organize this, there's often a student organization that picks up that slack (that the receptionist may not know about because it's not thur job)"
financialindependence,3dgx6f,-t0m-,3,Thu Jul 16 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who did this.  Notes:   Are you comfortable being assertive?  You will essentially be their landlord; what happens when they don't/can't pay? Do you have the financials to handle months when people are unable or unwilling to pay? If someone bails on the lease agreement, can you get by without having someone paying for that room?   Basically, if you are a pushover & do not have enough of a safety net, you can get screwed really easily.  However, my friend did this for years successfully & lived in a nice big house throughout school and it was awesome.  He wasn't a jerk but he did put his foot down when needed, and wasn't so financially desperate to not be able to handle most or all of the rent as needed when room tenants weren't available.  If you are going to be sharing things (common areas like the kitchen), clearly define rules of use.  How food is handled, how cleaning is handle, and so on.  The most successful setup I ever saw was with another group of students who each took one assigned role.  One cooked, one cleaned, one did laundry & maintenance, and they all chipped in a set amount for rent, food, and supplies.  There was no haggling on price because it was fixed & no haggling on responsibilities because if you were the cook, you cooked.  They had the most successful roommate relationship I've ever seen."

You take out a loan to buy extra stock, and you're terrified that the stock will crash, but if it doesn't, you make some extra cash.  With subletting housing, you're in the same boat: you're overextending your rent budget to rent out a whole house and you're terrified of being tenant-less, but if you have good tenants you make some extra cash.  The #1 plan is to do neither of these things.  The #2 plan is to buy stocks on margin, because that way you don't have to actually do any bullshit landlord work."

financialindependence,3dgx6f,dutchaneseskilz,6,Thu Jul 16 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"Well, then let me list why this is retarded (at least to me... I'm no lawyer or landlord, but I do actually live in San Francisco). Here goes...   You would be in breach of your master lease agreement, unless you got permission for EVERY subtenant to live there. That means every new arrival needs to be cleared, including any background checks or $30 filing fees. Hope you like going to the post office to get those certified mail stubs filled in. You would be the landlord (effectively) to multiple subtenants. That means shaking them for rent money when they are late and being the middle man for any disputes with deposits. You would be the middle man for all repairs, as it's my understanding that the master tenant would have to initiate these conversations with the landlord. Can't reiterate this enough - anybody skips town or has to leave early for some reason or other, you're on the hook for their rent. Landlord doesn't care if your friend sublessee has to go to semester abroad 2 weeks early... you're the one who pays. You now own a business. San Francisco rents aren't cheap, and all of a sudden your bank account is showing multiple $1000 deposits every month. You going to declare all of this, or set yourself up as some non-profit? Good luck explaining this one to your CPA. Again, you now run a business. You're the one putting those Craigslist ads out there for ""room for rent"" and having Saturday showings for that 4th bedroom. Gotta love having no social life, because you'll be spending all of your time coordinating with your roommate who is leaving for semester abroad in 2 weeks, because you need to show the room this Saturday and you're wondering ""if they will be out of the house from 9-11am and 2-4pm, and to have the room relatively clean"". Sounds like fun, right?   What a nightmare. Basically it all comes down to risk versus potential reward. Unless OP has some sweet deal for a multiple bedroom home that is rent controlled (so no Presidio) and is not in the projects (so no Bayview, Western Addition, Tendernob, etc), I don't think this scheme will work."

But if you start thinking about retirement in your mid-50s, you aren't ""taking the slow road"" -- you're probably wanting to retire pretty quickly after that.   If those who want to retire by conventional means were allowed to post willy-nilly in here, then it would basically turn into /r/personalfinance or /r/investing. I think the core gist of what we do here isn't necessarily about ""early retirement"" per se, but rather, as it hints on the sidebar ""to achieve FI...as fast as possible"".

Now that I discovered other people are being weirdos too (by spending far less than income) it was really cool. I could never relate to the type of people in /r/personalfinance as well because to me they're like the mainstream people who drive new cars and are all giddy about TV shows. To unnecessarily continue this long rant further, I'll add that I always kind of felt this way about not being connected with the mainstream way of thinking about consumption, TV, pop culture etc. Finding the bloggers and FI/RE community has been a revelation. Seeing that it's doable is one of the biggest benefits. Being able to talk freely about this topic when it's basically taboo in real life is the other big benefit."

This sub focuses more on how allocate your savings to shield taxes, get the greatest return, and how to calculate your own retirement needs from your expenses. Using a % of income is more valuable for advice that is widely applicable because not everyone lives in the same areas or lead the same lifestyle.  I see no problem with someone who makes a lot spending more nominally while still saving a large percentage of their income. It is a balancing act and everyone is different. It still fits the spirit of the sub."

A lot in this sub spend that much for their entire budget.  People harp on me for that, but you have to figure that it's fair that someone that lives in a place like SoCal within 20 minutes of the beach can still follow principles that will let them cut the time to retirement by 30 - 40%, which would be retirement at, or before, your 50's. People here are expecting that people adhering to FIRE principles can retire on well under $1M in assets...as low as $600k.  It just can't be done for someone like me when they want to live near family, stake you house in a place that doesn't require AC (great weather!), and also wants to have a big family (4 kids!).

financialindependence,3der4h,Smartare,3,Wed Jul 15 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"I think something that makes this sub a little different from others is that at the end of the day the emphasis is on the fastest / healthiest route to financial independence.  Given this, a person may choose to live in a high COL area with high expenses in exchange for being able to stash more money and shorten that time to independence.  By comparison, an /r/frugal person might dismiss the exorbitant cost of living in NYC / SFO / London even if long-run it's the best financial move.  Some of the ""ridiculously expensive lifestyles"" may be from people living in high COL areas because that's the best route to FI for them."

Perhaps that person has all of their family there etc. We all have different priorities: some likes to spend money on travel, some on a hobby, some on healthy food and some might want to live in a COL for one reason or another.   FI is not about everyone should live exactly like MMM but rather about cutting back on those things you don't value in order to save until you become FI and can spend money on what you really value."

financialindependence,3der4h,bonefish,-2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:59 2015 UTC,My living cost are 9 000 usd per year. Everything above that is in my eyes excess. So if you spend more than 9 000 usd per year you are living in excess according to me and your priorities are messed up. (I assume you spend more than 9000 per year but don't consider yourself as living in excess. It's because you have probably different priorities than me. You want more things than I want and that is ok. Just as there is someone who wants something that cost slightly more than your living costs)

I live in one of the ""most expensive cities"" on Earth too, according  to what people say. Ends up those people are just consumerist whores.  Rather than base my ideas of ""excessive"" on something arbitrary like what I spend, I use something more objective- the median individual income for whatever country you're residing in. In the US, that's 25k per year. Here in Korea, that's 22k per year.   You want more things than I want and that is ok.   I don't want more things than you, but since I'm under 22k per year for my country of residence, yes, it is ok. For others who want to spend 6 times the median individual income for their country every year without working- no, that's not ok. That's consumerist, environmentally damaging, and luxurious."

financialindependence,3der4h,twfu,0,Wed Jul 15 22:13:44 2015 UTC,But Financial Independence is independent of ER. I'm sure there are many people who are FI but still work.
financialindependence,3der4h,EricCSU,2,Wed Jul 15 23:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think that one of the issues is most people would interpret ""as fast as possible"" to really mean ""as fast as sanely possible,"" but different people will interpret what minimum is necessary for sanity differently.  One person might be able to eat beans and rice 7 nights in a row, while that same thing might drive someone else into clinical depression.  Part of it too is prioritization.  While some things are not strictly per se needs, they are desires which are strong enough people are willing to sacrifice for them.  It's pretty clear that not having kids will provide you a much quicker path to FI, but some people feel that having kids is important enough they want to do it anyway.  Where exactly someone should draw the line between such a desire and something more frivolous is sometimes a hard decision to make.  I think one of the biggest strengths of this sub is to help people hash through what is really necessary and what isn't.  Having someone say ""I don't own a TV so I have no cable bill"" can help someone new reconsider their position on entertainment expenses.  But if someone says, ""I've done the calculations, I've looked into going cable-free, and I feel that cable is a worthwhile expense,"" I think people should respect that even if they disagree as long as the calculation checks out (ie it's not someone making 12k a year with no assets who wants to be FI in 7 years).  Even in that case though, I think it's a good discussion for someone to point out, ""I like these N shows.  Even though I don't have cable I can watch them [this way]. Are you sure you really need cable?""  Maybe that person didn't realize there are alternatives and didn't include that in their calculations.  Cable is pretty straightforward, but there are a bunch of other topics and areas where there is more nuance and it's useful to have a conversation."
financialindependence,3der4h,CamelCavalry,-5,Wed Jul 15 22:57:52 2015 UTC,What if I want to save maximally and spend close to maximally?

financialindependence,3der4h,CamelCavalry,2,Thu Jul 16 06:11:53 2015 UTC,"Your question doesn't really make sense because those goals so directly conflict with each other. To save maximally requires spending minimally, more or less. There are many ways to increase savings, including but not limited to saving more and earning more, but saving as much as possible requires allocating as little money as possible in all other areas.  Saving maximally and, say, travelling maximally, are difficult but not completely contradictory goals. I also think this sub is open to reasonable deviations from saving maximally, like if you wanted to save as much as possibe except that you know you want to budget a certain amount to a hobby that's important to you, because finanical independence and and early retirement are ultimately about maximally enjoying your life and getting your priorities in line to accomplish that."

It's a depreciating asset and expensive. Biking is better for your health, public transit is better for the environment. The cons go on and on.  /r/personalfinance is not frugal at all. /r/frugal is just a lot of people saving a few dollars here and there- they are not saving 70-80% of their income like they should be to have a FIRE lifestyle.   I follow this approach with furniture, clothes, kitchen equipment, cars, pretty much anything I buy.   Maybe you should not buy furniture, new clothes every year, unnecessary kitchen stuff, or cars. That would drastically increase your savings percentage.  It's not that those subs are too frugal- it's that you have no idea what frugal really means. What is your saving percentage?"

If you're unfamiliar with the jeonse system, I suggest you check it out. It's pretty interesting.  I have a table my desktop monitor sits on, and a chair I brought in off the street. I own no other furniture. My bed is a mattress on the floor, which honestly I thought was a huge expense. Many Koreans do fine with the mats they sleep on- I maybe should have gotten one of those instead, but my sex life would likely be pretty awful and that is a psychological cost I'm not willing to take on.   like plates, knives, etc.   I own no knives, forks, or plates. I own two cups, two bowls, two spoons, two sets of chopsticks.   Do you just eat at restaurants?   No. I prepare food in either my pot or my wok. Rice is prepared in the rice cooker, which was a gift from an elderly Korean woman. Before receiving the rice cooker I made rice in my pot.

I have friends who chose to live in high COL cities in the US. SF bay area, Seattle, etc, but they specifically got low cost one bedroom apartments (about $800 per month rent) close to their work so they can walk/bike to work everyday. It can be done. For you, you could just move here to Korea if it means your savings percentage could be higher. Moving here is not hard.   Also I cannot live in tiny spaces like that.   Sounds like a personal problem.   I doubt you could find that much square footage for that price in Seoul.   Why would anyone want it? It's wasteful.

I know it's semantics, but you're really missing out if you don't understand the difference - literally none of the things you mentioned in either of your posts is required.  Frugality is about being efficient. Saving money on the things you don't value so you can spend money on the things that you do.   e.g. I don't have a TV or cable, I don't buy new cars and gadgets all the time and I don't have debt. I  DO love good beer, food, and hanging out with friends so I do those things instead of waste money on crap I don't care about.

If I'm really making so much money that I can spend it however I like and I still somehow wind up with enough saved to retire early, I don't need a lot of help making that happen. That's also a very small demographic.  FIRE is presented here as an achievable goal for a broad range of incomes, not just the very high earners. It's also important not to let your expenditures grow with your income so that they keep you from retiring early, and so most of the tenants of FIRE still apply at very high incomes. The important thing is that it is a goal that has to be planned for."

financialindependence,3de3f8,hadtoupvotethat,10,Wed Jul 15 15:34:44 2015 UTC,I think the point of using real returns is more for objectivity than ease of use. You don't want to mistakenly look at your nominal returns and assume that your purchasing power has increased by the same percent. In practice though it really doesn't matter. Do whatever works for you.
financialindependence,3de3f8,Kupotea,3,Wed Jul 15 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"I won't claim that this method is easier, but I spent some time to estimate what my expenses would look like in retirement.  It considers:     That expenses will drop as kids (I have 4) move out of the house.  Food expense will go down 60% over the 6 years that kids move out. That tax brackets will increase over time (Total stab, it is possible the structure completely changes. Obviously, my mortgage will go away at some point. Some line items have more specific inflation rates...like property tax at 2% max. I'm conservative in my estimates for things like salary increases (2%). I include one-time purchases of things like cars and weddings for my kids.  Not decided if that's the route I'm going, or not.   Overall, I feel like I have a pulse on what I'll be spending in future decades.  It gives me incentive to avoid some levels of lifestyle creep, because I can input the effect on the overall picture.  Since i have my thumb on the pulse of future spend...then it wouldn't make sense for me to account for inflation in my returns.  It's already factored in detail to my current expense plan.    I now have about 4 years of solid history to see where creep occurs, so I can stop it, or account for it.  Kid activities is hard to estimate, for now.  I don't know if my kid's activities will be inexpensive (boy scouts) or pricey (ice hockey).  I'll probably give them freedom to choose things they want, but I'll be able to see how it changes my overall picture, too, so it's not a blind acceptance."
financialindependence,3de3f8,CalcBros,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"Since i have my thumb on the pulse of future spend...then it wouldn't make sense for me to account for inflation in my returns. It's already factored in detail to my current expense plan.    But the only thing on that list which doesn't increase with inflation is your mortgage payment (until you finish paying it off).  Everything else, from food to tax brackets to cars, will go up with inflation.  I think your method might work if you have a specific date set for retirement.  But the nice thing about using real returns is that you don't need to have a date set.  You can assume tax brackets, food costs, etc. are all ""constant"" expenses, as well as a ""constant"" salary, although all those items increase with inflation.  Then you can re-use your estimates regardless of retirement year, so if you were planning on retiring in 2025 but want to see what it would look like to retire in 2022, you don't need to recalculate all your expenses."
financialindependence,3de3f8,im-a-koala,0,Thu Jul 16 11:35:07 2015 UTC,"Inflation is such a small part of it because I have four kids.  Running inflation on my current spends would be ridiculous because 6 mouths to feed with normal inflation will have me spending close to $30k at one point.  Later, my spend will be under $12k per year (in about 2 decades).    I have weddings, college tuitions, kid activities, group vacations...a lot of factors that are going to result in peak spending in the next two decades, and all that spend is going to plummet.  If I retire early, I'll need to be able to float those additional costs, but cuts will be harsh and deep soon after.  Those are the things I need to account for.    There are plenty of things I can't account for, though: how much will my robot cost? How much will self driving cars reduce insurance? Transportation costs?  Will the US have universal healthcare in 20 years?  Instead, will it cost triple what it does today?  The more you figure out, the more you realize you don't know.  But in any case, I think I have a better grasp than most and I have a spreadsheet that allows me to quickly add in additional costs over time to see how my retirement outlook is affected."
financialindependence,3de3f8,CalcBros,3,Thu Jul 16 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"My spreadsheet incorporates inflation into almost every calculation. If I want to use real returns, I just set my inflation assumption to 0%. Most of the time I like to look at nominal results though because some expenses don't grow with inflation and some grow faster than inflation (at least in my calculations).  Since I model both income and expenses, it just makes sense to do it in nominal dollars."
financialindependence,3de3f8,iaddandsubtract,3,Wed Jul 15 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"I track nominal, and then calculate how many times my projected annual spending I have in assets. Once I reach 25x, I'll be good.  But when I talk about future spending/earning, I'm talking about real numbers.  I've only been at it for 5 or so years, and inflation hasn't really affected me that much in these years. I'll probably start to feel the pinch eventually, but so far, real vs nominal hasn't made a real difference."

Also, I can easily watch for strange transactions, so there's some security value to it.  On the other hand, checking it like this can lead to relational stress from time to time.  If I see a transaction I don't recognize (and whose vendor is unknown to me), I ask my wife about it.  She joking says I'm her ""mintstalker.""  Thankfully, we're on the same page financially, so it's not a big deal for us.  But for others it could be.

financialindependence,3dd3wj,newark02,5,Thu Jul 16 09:37:20 2015 UTC,"I'm finding it nearly impossible to game my living and transportation situation more than it is gamed currently. I had an IFTTT recipe set up to send me Craigslist ads every time it fit within certain parameters, for a couple months. Eventually it just reaffirmed that I have a good deal (well, according to the market it's good).   I live about 11 miles from my office in a decently nice and walkable, if slightly low-class/ghetto neighborhood. We have ex-felons and crackheads, but also a very nice neighborhood park. So while not a safe place (I've had someone threaten to shoot me before) it's also very walkable compared to places in this general area. However given traffic and the distance to work, I don't think it's safe or practical to ride my bicycle all the way to work.  I've been trying to get a cheaper place closer to work, but they basically don't exist. It's frustrating because everyone assumes you can get a $300 room a stone's throw from your office, but I don't know what time period or planet they're referring to where this can happen. I watched Craigslist for months waiting for a cheaper, closer place that isn't a sexual proposition or something equally terrible.   So I bought a used car a month or so ago, and I'm not sure if I'm headed in the right direction. I don't want to be a suburban car-driving person. But I admit having a car is pretty convenient for certain things. I don't know what my question is I guess I'm just venting since I'm finding it very hard to optimize my FI seeking lifestyle further. Yeah I pay $950/month for rent, and it's hard for me to deal with that high number mentally even though it's just 12% or so of my post-tax income. I just want to optimize more.   Also driving to work is more stressful than the bike plus train ride I used to do before I bought a car, thinking saving time would be worth it. But I wonder, saving time for what? I don't have anything to do once I get home. I might just go back to doing the train + bike commute, even though it takes more clock time, and I have to wake up at a reasonable time again, because I feel somehow lazy and more sedentary by driving every day.   This morning I looked at my bike while tying my shoes and getting ready to drive to work. At that moment I realized that part of the reason why I miss my old commute of bike + train, which seems difficult on paper, is because I felt more in tune with my values. Riding my bike I felt more minimalist, like an embodiment of my philosophy that I don't need nice things like cars to be happy. Now that I sit in my car for both ends of my commute, I can't help but feel like I'm being folded into the status quo of car-driving, ecosystem-destroying, consumerist society. I know that I'm not, that it was a calculated move to save time. And even if I go back, I'll still keep my car. I just feel as though some actions have drifted me away from my values. So perhaps I'll ride my bike and the train tomorrow."

We get fresh veggies from the garden during the summer and all of the neighborhood kids love to pick them and eat them right off the plant - really can't complain about kids eating their vegetables.  And it beautifies our yard, adding sentimental and real value to our home.  My other love is turning wrenches.  Doesn't matter what it is, I love to tinker.  My big money pit that I love dearly is my Jeep, but I'll happily fix my kids' toys (saves money because it's not broken until I can't fix it) or do maintenance on our vehicles or even our neighbors' when they need a hand and a toolbox full of tools.

For people with sufficient buffers and big positive cashflows, Betterment's SmartSave feature sounds great.  I hope more companies copy it (at lower cost, of course)."
financialindependence,3ddp14,MrWookieMustache,2,Wed Jul 15 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"Just curious why you think betterment costs too much.  Doesn't it start at like 0.35% and go down from there, or am I missing something?  Of course you can still go cheaper with Vanguard admiral funds but betterment seems pretty cheap."
financialindependence,3ddp14,CalPolyJohn,6,Wed Jul 15 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"Since the fee is calculated on your total assets, it works the same way compound interest does, and captures more of your total returns over time.    This calculator illustrates the effect pretty nicely on a $10,000 investment.  Say you put $10,000 into a Betterment account when you're 25 with a 0.35% ER and earned on average a 7% return before fees - by the time you're 75, Betterment will have taken $47,215, or 16.6% of your total returns over that time period.  Reduce the expense ratio to 0.11%, and the total fees after 50 years drop to $15,755, or 5.5% of your total return.  That's a savings of $30,000 - and remember, we're only talking about a $10,000 investment here!  It really illustrates why Betterment's marketing is heavily targeting young professionals - they want to develop an early relationship with them and charge slightly elevated fees than necessary, and let compound interest do the rest.  Betterment's not as bad as the places that charge an ER of 1% or more, of course, but I'd still rather not pay them that kind of money for services I can easily do myself.  I understand that Betterment, Wealthfront, etc, need money to offer their services, but I'd much prefer if they switched over to a flat annual fee-based structure (with maybe different tiers for increased services), instead of taking a cut of my total portfolio.  It's not like the software they wrote is really working harder over time.  https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost"
financialindependence,3ddp14,MrWookieMustache,3,Wed Jul 15 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation.  I think I understand what you're saying but I'm still not convinced betterment is expensive.  When you say ""the fee is calculated on total assets"" doesn't that apply to anywhere you keep your investments?  For example, if your IRA was all in Vanguard's ""target retirement 2055"" fund, wouldn't the 0.18% fee be calculated on your total assets?  If you have over $100,000 in betterment, their fee is lowered to 0.15% which is lower than almost anything except for individual vanguard index funds.  I guess my view is - betterment is cheap and user friendly.  It's not quite as cheap as Vanguard if you are hand picking funds, but it's right on pace with Vanguard's target date funds which is pretty good. And it's probably better for new investors who don't know what they are doing and don't even understand the expense ratio thing yet."
financialindependence,3ddp14,CalPolyJohn,7,Wed Jul 15 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's worse than I thought.  Betterment buries this in their fine print:  http://support.betterment.com/customer/portal/topics/424113-fees  ""Your money is invested in a fully diversified index-fund portfolio made up of 12 exchange traded funds or ETFs. Each of these ETFs has an expense ratio (they range from .09%-.17% depending on your allocation - this is about 15 cents for every $100 you invest), which you would pay no matter where you purchased these funds. The cost charged by the funds is a little harder to see because the fund companies get their money by slightly reducing the dividends they pay out. Rest assured that Betterment works hard to offer funds with some of the lowest fees. ""  In other words, you have to add Betterment's fee to the underlying index fund fee.  At best, Betterment will always cost 0.15% more than directly investing in the underlying ETFs.  At worst, it will cost 0.35% more.  That means that, going back to my examples in the previous post, we're talking about paying Betterment $50,000 over 50 years - I don't know about you, but to me, 50 grand isn't a small price to pay for any product, much less something as simple as the convenience features Betterment is offering.  People on this sub often talk about doing frugal things like biking to work, cooking your own food, buying a smaller residence, etc - but I find it crazy how they scoff at $50,000 in extra investment fees as being ""worth the convenience"" of not having to click a couple buttons to rebalance in Vanguard twice a year."
financialindependence,3ddp14,MrWookieMustache,3,Wed Jul 15 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"not having to click a couple buttons to rebalance in Vanguard twice a year   I think it takes quite a bit more time and effort than that to replicate what robo-advisors do, especially for taxable accounts. We're talking about 15bps, it doesn't take a whole lot between tax loss harvesting, efficient lot selling, and better rebalancing (investing new cashflows and dividend payments to rebalance, instead of requiring asset sales to fund rebalance) to more than cover that fee."
financialindependence,3ddp14,manu08,4,Thu Jul 16 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"Clearly this is the wrong sub for me to be sticking up for a higher fee investment platform.  No doubt you are right and that over time the fees will add up significantly higher in betterment.  Actually the reason I originally asked was because my girlfriend (who is new to investing) just set up an IRA and I told her vanguard and betterment were 2 solid options.  Everything I have read suggests this. Heck even Mr Money Mustache recommends betterment.  I use Vanguard myself.  A couple things I'm still thinking about - it's not clear to me from their fine print that you have to pay anything on top of the 0.35% (or less) fee.  It talks about ETF expense ratios, but doesn't specifically say those AREN'T included in the original fee.  Also, betterment would probably claim that tax loss harvesting makes up the very small difference in fees.  I don't know enough about TLH to say anything there."
financialindependence,3ddp14,CalPolyJohn,7,Wed Jul 15 20:41:16 2015 UTC,Heck even Mr Money Mustache recommends betterment.   He does get paid whenever someone opens a Betterment account through his link.
financialindependence,3ddp14,kyleko,3,Wed Jul 15 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Betterment wouldn't mention the ETF fees unless they're passing them through - they even state that they're ""harder to see"" because they're included in the stock price fluctuations (which is true and how Vanguard and all other index funds work).  I don't know how they could possibly not charge the ETF expense ratios, honestly.  MMM also earned money for that post from Betterment by joining their affiliate program, which he eventually added a disclaimer for on the blog post after receiving a ton of criticism.  It's right there at the bottom - he can claim it's not a conflict of interest...but it kinda is.  And even if he didn't write it for the kick-back, that doesn't mean MMM understands the math.  Once you do the math, you realize how anti-mustachian his post is, and how much more suspicious that particular article really is in light of the affiliate relationship:  http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/11/04/why-i-put-my-last-100000-into-betterment/  As far as TLH, it might help in theory in taxable investment accounts, but it would also be a more clear benefit with big investment amounts...and unfortunately the IRS caps the deduction for TLH at $3,000/year, which is worth ~$750 annually if you're in the 25% tax bracket, and that's only if you itemize, which means that it's ultimately not nearly as big a benefit as Betterment makes it out to be in theory."
financialindependence,3ddp14,MrWookieMustache,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry -- I see the logic behind your assertions individually, but they make little sense to me when you put them together. (And I believe some of your assumptions are incorrect.)  First, I'd like to note that a $750 check from Uncle Sam (which assumes 25% federal/0% state *cue laugh from someone in CA*) covers Betterment's fee for managing $500,000 for a year.   Also, I'd like to see why you believe that capital losses only save you money if you itemize. AFAICT, Form 1040 line 13 has a field specifically for cap gains/losses, and Schedule D tells you to put losses directly in that field. Itemized/standard deduction isn't even on the same page, so I'm failing to see how you came to that conclusion.  Next, let's assume you have an account with $75K that harvested $2,550 in losses[1]. In the 25% tax bracket with 0 state taxes, that's ~$637 back in your pocket. Assuming you sat at $99,999 in your Betterment account all year (0.25% fee; 0.15% kicks in at $100,000), you would be charged ~$250 for this benefit (along with all of the other services Betterment offers). That's a gain of $387 after Betterment's fees.   tl;dr: if the assumptions in [1] are correct, the service pays for itself + the fees of the funds that back the ETFs, and puts extra cash in your pocket. Not to mention that you can use TLH losses to counter capital gains (more tax breaks yay), and roll ""unused"" losses over to next year's taxes.     [1] - Two months after TLH launched (mid-2014), it averaged $425 in harvesting for accounts between $50k and $100k. This scaled roughly linearly with account value up to $500K+. Expanding this to a year (because that's the best datapoint I have to work with), that's $2,550/yr of harvested losses for accounts between $50k-$100k."

That's a gain of $387 after Betterment's fees.   You only get this gain during the first year. Thereafter, your basis is lower and you're less likely to realize another capital loss. Essentially, the capital losses give you back your marginal tax rate, times the most that any given invested dollar falls from its original point. Since the stock market tends to go up, this amount is typically nil.  Even of you realized a much more significant capital loss, over decades of investing, you'd pay far more in fees."

It's generally assumed that any changes will only affect workers who are in their mid 50's or younger at the time of the institution of said changes, in order to give workers time to prepare and adjust their plans.  As far as taking SS early in order to invest your benefits in index funds...it's not recommended.  Remember, stock indices are highly volatile, and generally shouldn't be trusted for people with shorter investing timelines.  It would be safer to just delay SS and lock in higher benefits, since that's a guaranteed ~8% increase for every year you delay up till age 70.  The good reasons to take SS early are because you need the cashflow or believe you will have a shorter than average life expectancy, not to reinvest your benefits."

I collected unemployment and then extended unemployment and when that ran out I applied for SS.    I considered waiting another year and living off of investments but in doing the math my portfolio was growing faster than the SS would grow by waiting."
financialindependence,3ddot1,ScriptPro,10,Wed Jul 15 14:51:48 2015 UTC,"Im going to go against the consensus and say take it early.  For a few reasons. First is that these years are very vulnerable health wise because from 62 to 65 you dont have medicare. The extra money could at the very worst, take the sting out of healthcare costs until youre 65.  Secondly because the older I get, the less money I will need. I won't be taking crazy vacations and or high cost hobbies.  Over 65 I would just have a simple life.  Third because if I planned correctly earlier in life with my investments, I wont be needing a higher SS payment but taking it early gives me 3 years of fun money or health care money or home improvement money, you get the idea.  Fourth is that I really dont plan on having a job at this point. If you do, I would wait.  if not then taking it early Gives you more income. It would be insanely stupid to be just scraping by frugally for several years just so you can collect more SS to ""live it up"" in your 70s.   So in summary. If you dont need it, take it early and enjoy it. If you do need it, then get a part time job and wait it out because you probably screwed up planning earlier in life or had a major set back. Thats just my opinion though."

You can't get anywhere close to the same guaranteed return on money from your investments that you can from deferring SS from 66 to 70."
financialindependence,3ddot1,ScriptPro,2,Wed Jul 15 19:12:33 2015 UTC,Except that investment gains now are better than higher payments later IMO. To each his own. If you want to wait then wait but maybe you should look up a break even date before blindly calling it terrible advice.
financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:24 2015 UTC,When you are in retirement you only care about the income stream you can derive from your investments.  Waiting to file for social security gives you a higher income stream.

So until then, taking it early is mathematically superior.  My opinion is that after im 80 years old the extra $500 per month wont matter very much to me, but having money before then will"
financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,0,Wed Jul 15 23:38:14 2015 UTC,"The argument is, that by deferring your social security you get a better return than you can on any investment.  So if you have investments, you're better off spending them first and taking social security at 70.  If you want the extra $500 a month when you're 62, just take more out of your investments (which will cause you to have less investment income later), don't start taking social security early.  You can either ""invest"" by not taking social security early or ""invest"" by not taking as much out of your investments.  The return on not taking your social security has a better return.  If you have no investments, then you have no choice but to take social security early."
financialindependence,3ddot1,ScriptPro,4,Thu Jul 16 00:55:07 2015 UTC,"Or you could do both if you have enough in investments.  The break even for taking it early is around 80 years old. No one knows how their health will be after 80, even if your family is known to live to 90. Thats 17 healthier, younger years of having more money or 10  extremely edlerly years of having more.   I am SO surprised that people in this sub are promoting taking SS later. This sub is about being independent financially and a lot of us want to retire by age 40 or even younger. Yet you are saying you want to hold out on SS so you can have a small amount more after you are 80 years old?  I wish you good luck with that and hope you live a long life, but I'll take my money sooner every time."
financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:15:14 2015 UTC,"We are promoting taking SS later because it makes more financial sense.  Would you take SS early if you only got $1000 a year at 62 and $100,000 and 70?  You could have 8 healthier, younger years of having more money.  But you probably wouldn't do that.  It would be far better to spend down your other investments and wait for the big payoff at 70, right?  And the reason you'd spend down your other investments is that you can't get a return on them like you would by suspending your social security.  What I'm saying is that using your investment money from 62-70 is smarter than getting social security earlier because you get a better return by waiting for social security.  I'm not saying you don't spend any money from 62-70, but by deferring your social security and taking out of your investments you'll have more income than if you save your investments and take out social security early."
financialindependence,3ddot1,iaddandsubtract,4,Thu Jul 16 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"It isnt 1,000 vs 100,000. And the breakeven point again is 80+ years old. Most of the people promoting taking SS later probably wont make it to that point and its misleading to tell people to wait when their family life expectancy is 75. I think youre getting tunnel vision here and not looking at the bigger picture. Its not just about who will have more money at age 90, but who will reach age 90 and what will they be able to do on the way there."
financialindependence,3ddot1,ScriptPro,3,Thu Jul 16 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"This isn't about deferring your retirement or living on less.  This is simply about making a better investment.  Here's another example.  66 year old, $1,000,000 investment account, wants to spend $50k/year, SS benefit at 66 is $10,000, Using the 4% safe withdrawal rate, and 0% inflation (to simplify things).  Option A: Take SS early at 66   At end of year 1: $1,000,000 investment account, spent $50k ($40k from investments, $10k from SS). At end of year 2: $1,000,000 investment account, spent $50k ($40k from investments, $10k from SS). Note the total income they can take every year is $50k without spending down principal.   Option B: Wait until 67   At end of year 1: $990,000 investment account, spent $50k ($50k from investments $0k from SS). At end of year 2: $990,000 investment account, can spend $50.4k ($39.6k from investments $10,800 from SS) They can now spend $50.4k per year every year after though they spent the same $50k the first year just as Option A   Option C: Wait until 70   At end of year 1 (66): $990,000 investment, spent $50k At end of year 2 (67): $979,600 investment, spent $50k At end of year 3 (68): $968,784 investment, spent $50k At end of year 4 (69): $957,535 investment, spent $50k Beginning year 5 (70), $957,535 investment generates $38,301 plus SS income of $13,200 for a total of $51,501   So, by deferring your social security, you don't have to spend less money, you can spend more money and you have a larger safe stream of income.  Also another thing to note is that most people nearing retirement will make it to 80+ years old.  When you're 60 your life expectancy is 81.34 for males and 84.34 for females.  And it's even higher for rich people (ie. people who can afford to wait to take their social security)."
financialindependence,3ddot1,nopurposeflour,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"I like to think there is a decent chance that someone will discover some way of significantly increasing my lifespan at some point. If I wait to take SS, I may get that 24% higher payout until I'm 200 or whatever. Since I don't ""need"" the SS money for a normal retirement using a 4% withdrawal rate on my portfolio, it's more important for me to mitigate the risk that I live a very long time.  Living longer than 40 years after retirement is the greatest danger to the success of the 4% withdrawal rule. Locking in a big SS payment could help out with that tremendously."

financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,11,Wed Jul 15 23:39:01 2015 UTC,Generally the best option is to wait to take your social security until 70 if you have other investments (or a job) to cover you between 66 and 70.  This is because if you delay getting your benefits they increase by 8% (plus inflation) for every year you delay until 70.  You can't get a guaranteed 8% plus inflation return anywhere.  If you die when you're 69 and never collected SS it doesn't really matter because you're dead.  But if you live to 100 you'll be glad that you waited to get the extra 32%/year of SS.
financialindependence,3ddot1,MrWookieMustache,13,Wed Jul 15 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"While the 8% increase per year is significant, it's not as good as an 8% investment return because it is also paired with elimination of one total year of benefits.  I still agree that deferring looks good; I plan to delay benefits when I get there."
financialindependence,3ddot1,jirachiex,6,Wed Jul 15 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely true when factoring what you'll leave after you die.  However, just in terms of your retirement an 8% return on an investment would just get you 8% more a month based on a fixed withdrawal  percentage (whether you live 1 or 100 years)."
financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,16,Wed Jul 15 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"No, it's still not the same as a compounded investment return.  Here's an illustration:  Social Security: Option 1 - You retire at 62 and get $15,000 in benefits.  This is also what you get every year after that (with the only difference being an inflation adjustment each year, which we can ignore for this calculation).  So at age 63, you've received cumulative benefits of $30k, at age 64 you've received $45k, etc.  Option 2 - You retire at 63 and get ~8% increase, or $16,200 in benefits, and the same for each year after that.  So at age 62, you've received $0, 63 you've received $16,200, 64 you've received $32,400.  In order to calculate your investment return, you compare the cumulative total benefits for Option 1 to Option 2 in each year.  Age 62:  $0/$15k = 0 = 100% loss.  Age 63:  $16.2k/$30k = 0.54 = 46% loss.  Age 64:  $32.4/$45k = 0.72 = 28% loss.  And so on.  Eventually, if you live long enough there's a break-even point and it becomes a gain - but it never reaches an 8% gain, because there's always that one year when you didn't get anything (and more years than that if you delayed longer).  For example, if you live to be 163 years old (congrats if you pull that off!), then the return becomes:  Age 163:  $1620k/$1515k = 1.0693 = 6.93% gain."
financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,11,Wed Jul 15 17:18:30 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering, the break-even point in the above example is age 75. Using real numbers, the break-even point of taking SS at 63 vs 62 is 76, and the break-even point of taking SS at 70 vs 62 is age 80.4."
financialindependence,3ddot1,MrWookieMustache,4,Wed Jul 15 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"If you're age 62 today, your average life expectancy is 82 if you're male or 85 if you're female.  If you only go by the break-even point (which is a mistake) it's still an obvious choice to wait until 70."
financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,2,Thu Jul 16 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"For your retirement it's effectively an 8% gain because your retirement income is 8% greater.  If your investments were all of a sudden 8% larger, you could safely take out 8% more per year.  By deferring your SS for a year you will also increase your income by 8% per year (guaranteed!).  Now you can argue that if you don't live long enough then you would have less money in the end, but that only matters for your heirs, not for you.  What matters for you is the income stream you can generate from your investments and you can't beat the 8% + inflation that SS gives you from 66-70."
financialindependence,3ddot1,MrWookieMustache,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"No, it matters for you too.  If you defer Social Security, then you forever lose those years when you weren't collecting, which decreases your current income in those years.  You'd have to take a big withdrawal from your investment accounts to replace the income you're not getting from Social Security.  Remember, I'm assuming you're long retired many years before Social Security eligibility.  I think you're considering a scenario where you just ""keep working"" prior to getting Social Security to replace that income, which isn't the type of planning most people on this sub are doing.  Even people who aren't aiming for early retirement don't always find it easy to keep working or find jobs in their 60's, which means any decision to defer Social Security also means having to draw down their investments to cover the gap until they start drawing SS.  It's not as simple as saying they're getting an, ""8% return."""
financialindependence,3ddot1,fist2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:51 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're already retired, say you have $1 million, with a 4% withdrawl, so $40k/year and you only spend $40k/year.  For simplicity 0% inflation, $10k/year initial SS benefit.  Option 1: Take early SS 66: $1,000,000 - $40k investment income - $10k SS income ($50k total income, $40k used, $10k reinvested) 67: $1,010,000 - $40,400 investment income - $10k SS income ($50,400 total income)  Option 2: Defer taking SS 66: $1,000,000 - $40k investment income - No SS income ($40k total income, $40k used) 67: $1,000,000 - $40k investment income - $10,800 SS income ($50,800 total income)  Option 2 results in more retirement income than Option 1.  It is better for your yearly income stream to draw down your other investments first deferring taking social security as long as you can."
financialindependence,3ddot1,MrWookieMustache,2,Wed Jul 15 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"Your calculations are mixing up a bunch of different factors and has a ton of assumptions to unpack.  By using different investment portfolio sizes, spending values, Social Security incomes, and investment returns (and volatility will totally screw with things here), you can get far different values.  The example I used a couple posts back is only concerned with comparing the total cumulative income received from Social Security by collecting immediately vs. deferring, which is much more straightforward and gives the correct rate of return based on how long you live.  The fact is that if you defer, you're reducing your available income in the years you're not collecting, so your return from that decision will always be less than 8%, no matter how long you live.  That has nothing to do with your heirs - it's how much money you've actually received from Social Security."
financialindependence,3ddot1,freddo411,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you on that point.  What I'm saying is it doesn't make sense from an income standpoint to take SS before 70 if you have investments that can provide you the missing income.  The guaranteed 8% increase in income from social security each year is a better ""return"" than not liquidating the equivalent portion of your investment account.  What I'm saying is that in virtually no cases does it make sense to take social security before 70 if you have investments or other income that can fill the gaps from 62-70."
financialindependence,3ddot1,chadlawton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:56:39 2015 UTC,And that's all true; I agree that it does make sense for most people to defer unless they have cashflow problems (didn't save enough) and/or expect to die earlier than average due to poor health.  I just wanted to show that the 8% increase in benefits per year you gain by deferring isn't the same as an 8% investment return.

financialindependence,3ddot1,HiramAbiff,3,Thu Jul 16 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"Really its all a gambling game. The two factors are how much you will get paid each month (which can increase if you take a later withdrawal) and how many more years you may end up living. You could wait until the last year to take Social security to get a full benefit (which is around 67 or something, I could be wrong) but if you die at age 68, you hardly make a thing.   The numbers are just based on average life spans. So you have X number of years you live multiplied by the X amount of money you get paid each month. The gambling variable is the amount of years that you may live."
financialindependence,3ddot1,Wingineer,2,Wed Jul 15 14:01:12 2015 UTC,This is true. Not sure when you have to make the decision to take SS at what age but I would think there would be some chart that say if you are 64 and expect to live less than X take SS early. If you(and your doctor) are betting on you living until 90+ then you should take SS as late as possible.   I could be wrong about this but it seems like it would be an easy line in the sand depending on you life expectancy assessment.
financialindependence,3ddot1,tu_che_le_vanita,3,Wed Jul 15 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"Why yes, there is ""some chart"" about this. See this article for an example.  http://perspective.schwab.com/mobile/article/6753/When-Should-You-Take-Social-Security  You could create one for yourself using your own specifics. The upshot is, ""How long are you gonna live, punk?"" If you live past one of the breakeven points shown, you benefit by delaying. This presumes your metric is ""getting the most dollars out of Social Security.""  I saw data once that suggested that when people start Soc Security is very bimodal -- there are a lot of people who start it as soon as possible, and there are a lot of people who delay taking it for as long as possible, to rack up the extra 24% in benefits."

financialindependence,3dhl89,ReincarnationHappens,10,Thu Jul 16 09:43:44 2015 UTC,"I could be mistaken, but the general philosophy of /r/personalfinance and many others is to:  Pay minimums on debts until your emergency fund is filled to 3-6 months of covering expenses.   Then heavily paying down any debt with interest 4%+ while paying minimums on the rest.   Then from there it's largely up to how risk averse you are if you start investing for retirement with the extra money or pay down your other debts faster.   If your paying into 3 buckets now policy works for you, great; I just know people who would feel uneasy not having 3-6 months of living expenses available for emergencies."

At worst, if an emergency arises, you put that cost right back on the card, but you save ~20% interest on whatever you've paid down in the meantime.  I'm not sure what kind of effective APR overdrafts have, but I'd imagine it'd be close to or worse than credit cards."

The thing is, people in the FI community sometimes do and advise things that are a bit counterintuitive and could cause real harm to personal finance novices.    We pay for everything on credit cards...because we never pay any interest on them.  We sometimes don't hold emergency funds...because we have relatively large net worths and save 70%+ of our (usually larger than average) incomes, giving us cash flows greater than most peoples' emergency funds.  We don't work for money in our prime earning years or take advantage of ""catch-up"" retirement contribution rules...because we don't need to by that point.  We sometimes advise people to take on debt and pay interest...if the interest rate on the debt is extremely low compared to what you could otherwise earn on investments.

My link goes to that sub, but it is actually a link to direct and clear answer to his question.  The emergency fund is a topic which I have had quite a few debates over...  A friend of mine resides in /personalfinance and he and I have had multiple conversations where I strongly disagreed with him.  I think part of the issue is that the debate over an emergency fund is too vaguely defined the same way that investments are often too broadly defined as being ""Well use your age, subtract that from 100 and put that much into stocks the rest into bonds!""  There are so many details which really should be thought about and discussed outside of that simplified answer.  I think that the emergency fund discussion has not yet reached the point where people are willing to accept an answer other than ""3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account"" which does have merit and does have a lot of backing for why that can be a useful amount.  Other differences such as using a credit card to pay for almost everything you can, not worrying so much about our peak earning years, and potentially taking a loan and paying it off slowly are all things which I think both subs should agree on yet do not.  I might guess part of the difference is that this sub tries to focus on more of a financially savvy audience whereas /personalfinance tries to focus on helping the lowest common denominator which is someone who will spend everything on a credit card without being able to pay for it and will take out high interest loans and forget to pay them on time."

That might include REITs if you want to slice and dice, or you might just be happy with the REITs automatically baked into the Total Market Index fund or whatever you go with.    I chose the slice and dice approach and have 11% allocated to REITs.  Plus I own my own home (another 10% of my net worth), so I'm well exposed to real estate."

Since 20% of your portfolio is in cash (savings account), that would translate to 0-8% of your overall portfolio.  By the way: You may not want to count the entire value of your house in your net worth anyway. See this article ""Should You Include Your Home In Your Net Worth?""

But the part where he talks about taking recurring expenses into account... that doesn't have anything to do with calculating your assets or net worth.  I disagree with him about that.

financialindependence,3db51g,thbt101,4,Wed Jul 15 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"The author is not in the wrong.  It's just that he's not good at explaining the nuances - so I'll take a stab.  From a very crude accounting standpoint, the author would be wrong.  The author writes:   Many people simply assume could sell that home and have $200,000 in the bank – a liquid, spendable asset. That is true. However, on the other side of the balance sheet, they’d now have an incurred liability: housing expenses. With no house to live in, since it was sold, the person would have to find housing, either by renting or by buying a new home.   Housing expenses, by definition, are expenses and not liabilities (in the accounting sense).  In the regular accounting sense it can be thought of as the cost of doing business.  In this context I think of it as living expense in regards to owning a home.  So, for the house, this would include interest expense (if not mortgage-free), depreciation (not too much), property taxes, etc.  For renting it's just that - pure rent.  These would be income statement items.    In terms of balance sheet, which details one's assets vs liabilities and the remaining portion, equity, the house would be the asset on one side with the remaining mortgage loan as liability and paid principal as equity.    So, when a person decides to convert his fixed asset (mortgage-free house) to liquid asset (cash), it merely changes one side of the balance sheet.  His other side is pure equity, since the mortgage liability in this example is non-existent.  Yes, it would change the nature of the expenses, but that wouldn't factor into the calculation of equity, per se.  However, this is where the nuance comes in.  The author doesn't do a very good job explaining his reasoning here, but this phenomenon within the finance world is commonly known as off-balance sheet financing.  Notice how in this example expenses could dramatically change when one goes from owning a home (fixed asset) to renting (liquid asset).  What the author is arguing is that since housing is a mandatory consumption item, it should be treated as the same kind of obligation as if one were paying interest on debt.  One can't not consume housing just as how one can't default on one's loan without dire consequences.  Hence, under this view - which I'll add is entirely economically legitimate (look up capital leases vs operating leases) - one should back out the equivalent loan amount in this arrangement and assign it as a liability to offset assets.  Then, with the remaining equity portion one would have a more realistic view of net worth.  Edit: Note that many businesses engage in this type of accounting to make themselves look asset-light, i.e. to conjure the illusion of efficient business operations."
financialindependence,3db51g,plucesiar,2,Wed Jul 15 06:12:38 2015 UTC,"I see how that works from an accounting standpoint but in the personal finance world, nobody counts future assets or liabilities as part of their present net worth.  I don't count the value of my future labor as part of my present assets, and I don't count the meals I'm going to eat next month as part of my present liabilities.

Valuing an asset has nothing to do with cash flow or related earnings/expenses.  It's simply the current value of things that you own at any given moment, and it's useful for calculating your current net worth.  And net worth has nothing to do with your future earnings/expenses/etc.  He's right that you should think about things like expenses related to your house, what else you could do with the money if you lived in a smaller house, etc.  But none of that changes how you calculate your assets and your net worth."

Not having a house is like having negative assets. My reasoning is that since owning a house covers a need that you have, it is an asset.   Basically, we're just setting the 0 point at different places. But I think considering housing as an asset makes sense because there are plenty of other needs that human beings have that aren't naturally covered.

It would be silly to call it an investment, and it wouldn't be an investment for tax purposes, and also presumably not when you're tracking your personal spending budget.  But on the original topic of assets, you could call it an asset if it's something someone else might reasonably give you money for, at least it is until it melts or otherwise becomes worthless.  If you really want to count it, your shirt, your pen, etc. are all your assets too.  Most people just don't bother adding up the value of all their small items when computing their net worth or assets, but you certainly could.

Could you be considered FI if you do not intend to sell them? No. because all that money is tied up in consumption. Could you call them an asset and calculate them in your excel document? Sure, but it wouldn't be meaningful since you can't get any return on it or use it for other stuff  If you own a 3 000 000 usd house and you intend to never downsize. Is it really meaningful to count it as an asset? Probably not since all that money is tied up in the house and you will never be able to spend or invest it.   If you own a 3 000 000 USD house but you plan on selling it and getting a 100 000 usd house it would be meaningful to count it.   Basically, you are free to call anything an asset. You can call your spouse an asset. It just wouldn't be meaningful for the concept of FI. So when others here are saying a house isn't an asset and investment it's because it's not a meaningful asset when it comes to FI if you intend to keep the house (its consumption).

It wouldnt make sense for you to calculate it when figuring out how much money you have for FI purposes because you cannot use its worth to invest and make money.(Although it is nice to have a paid off house to help lower expenses!)"

No.   By definition, those things are still your ""assets"" and they count towards your ""net worth"".    If you're wanting to calculate a subset of your assets that are useful to you for the specific purpose of FI, or you just want to know which assets you could sell right now, that's fine.  But in that case you're calculating something different than just finding your net worth."
financialindependence,3db51g,thbt101,4,Wed Jul 15 18:09:27 2015 UTC,"The actual composition of real estate in the US economy is more like 10-15% so a 10% allocation to REITs is perfectly fine.   I understand some people will criticize this for saying ""mom & pop laundromats aren't represented in the stock market either, why don't we get exposure to them,"" the fact that is that REITs are a reliable, cheap proxy for real estate whereas we don't have one for family businesses and small non-public businesses."

BUT, if you are playing that game, I don't know why you would think REIT returns are low.  The capital return on them is usually less than (for example) the S&P 500, but the returns are usually not correllated, so in a down year for the S&P, REITS might do well.  PLUS Reits pay a lot of dividends and when you include that income their past performance is pretty good.  After you include the income returns, my REIT index hasn't had a negative year since 2008 ....  its done very well. I don't take that to mean it will perform well in the future but this seemed to be your question.   I own some, not because I think it is the absolute single best option for a high return out there, but because its returns don't seem so tied to the overall markets, and therefore it provides a pretty substantial reduction in volatility in my portfolio for a very meager reduction in overall return potential."

The big deal was rebalancing so that you were buying low and selling high.  All of that works, but it works a lot better when bonds are yielding something decent.  When bond yields are as shitty as they are right now, its easy to make a case for a 100% stock allocation instead."

However, I allocate 10% of my total portfolio to REIT's for diversification purposes and I do consider it as part of my net worth for FI since it is a liquid investment.

Some people hold 5 to 10 percent of REITs out of their total portfolio. I think it really depends how each investor identifies REITs: Either a means of diversification or alternative investment.

From a time input and expected returns standpoint, REITs are way more similar to investing in stocks than they are to real estate investing.   You can achieve great wealth in real estate on an impressive timeframe, but only with significant risk and time/planning input. REITs take the risk and effort mostly out of the equation, and of course, so goes the potential for outsize returns."
financialindependence,3db51g,Smartare,3,Thu Jul 16 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it mentioned yet so I'd like to add.. REIT funds are generally quite tax inefficient because much of their growth is in the form of dividends which are taxed at a relatively high rate.  Given this I think many investors choose to keep REITs in tax-deferred accounts.. The downside of this is that it seems few 401k plans offer low fee REIT index fund options.  Keeping them in an IRA is certainly a possibility.  Edit for reference link:  http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement#Tax_efficiency_of_stocks   REITs, although they trade as stocks, are required to distribute almost all their income, and the income is taxable at the non-qualified dividend rate except for a small portion (historically about 15%) which is non-taxable because it compensates for depreciation of the property. (For details on the tax consequences of this return of capital distribution, refer to Vanguard REIT Index tax distributions)."

Personally I think 20% of my investments in just one sector like real estate is a bit overexposed.

Those are dividends that will appear in your account. You can configure your account to just receive them as cash or automatically reinvest them.  Dividend ETFs tend to be plagued by high fees. HDV for example has a fee of 0.40%. If you really want dividend stocks, you are better off buying individual companies directly at lower cost, perhaps constructing your own Gordon model to evaluate good buys.  Note that by focusing exclusively on dividends you will be missing out a lot of other good stocks and you may get less total return, which means that your stream of dividends will not grow as much over the course of the future. For this reason, the common investment advice is to just hold the total stock market index, and accept the package of dividends and growth it provides."

If you instead invest a total market index fund, you will get a balance of dividends and growth, i.e. your dividends will grow faster than if you focus on dividends alone.  To put it in simple mathematical terms, you might be investing in a company whose dividend payout is something like $5, $5, $5, $5, $5... but miss out on the company whose payout is $2, $5, $7, $10, $10, ... (per $100 of shares). The first company has a higher payout today but the second company has a higher long run payout. If you are still in the dividend-reinvestment stage, you are better off seeking companies that aim to grow their dividends than companies with presently high dividends. Then, as you develop a need for income, you can trade out growth for dividends.  My personal goal is to just hold the total stock market index, and live off the 2% dividend yield."

financialindependence,3dd4dl,byu402,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"I think investing in individual dividend stocks is superior to investing in a dividend ETF for the following reasons:   Better Yield - Vanguard has a couple of dividend ETFs available: Dividend Appreciation (VIG) & High Yield (VYM). The listed yield for both these funds are 2.19% (VIG) and 3.26% (VYM). According to Dave Fish's Dividend Champions list, there are 218 companies with a dividend yield greater than 3.26% with a dividend increase streak of at least 5 years. If you limit that to just the Champions (25+ years of dividend increases) there are 32 such companies. Including prominent blue-chippers KO (3.36%), XOM (3.51%), and PG (3.39%). Consistent Income - Purchasing individual stocks result in a more consistent (and consistently rising) income stream. The companies mentioned pay the same dividend each quarter (and raise them each year). The distributions from VIG and VYM fluctuate from quarter to quarter. VIG ""cut"" their distributions in 2009 & 2013. VYM ""cut"" their distributions in 2009. Low Degree of Difficulty - Indexing technically wins here because it is very much a ""set it and forget it"" style. However finding companies that have grown their dividends for an extended period of time is not difficult at all. Dave Fish's Dividend Champions list is an invaluable resource for searching such stocks.   I think the better starting yield, subsequent growth, and consistency of payments outweigh the requirement of doing slightly more research."

Suppose we are both going to retire in 20 years. I follow total return and you follow total dividend. In 20 years my portfolio, through capital gains, will be worth more. I can then sell my portfolio and buy your portfolio, only more of it. We now have the same portfolio in retirement, but mine is larger and yielding more dividends."
financialindependence,3dd4dl,byu402,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:36:27 2015 UTC,There are pros and cons to anything. And just because someone is in their late 20s doesn't mean they won't be retiring at 30-35 etc. A dividend heavy portfolio will better ride out the recessions because you have more cash coming in and will have to sell less shares. Sure the dividend portfolio may lose out in total return in the long run but that's just one part of the picture . For instance it only costs a flat commission to buy an individual stock but with an index you're paying .10-.25%+ in fees on your total balance. Also aren't qualified dividends the same tax rate at LT cap gains?
financialindependence,3dd4dl,fotoman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points, friend. However I don't think ""losing out in total return in the long run"" can be neglected so easily. You want a combination of dividends AND growth for the long run. Otherwise after sufficient time, the growth portfolio will pass the dividend portfolio in total dividend yield, because its lower dividend yield will be multiplied by a much larger portfolio.  For example, you might have a portfolio paying a dividend yield of 4% and growing 5% a year (TR=9%) while I might have a portfolio paying a dividend yield of 2% and growing 10% a year (TR=12%). My dividend will double every 7 years while yours only doubles every 14. My portfolio will double every ~6 years while yours only doubles every ~8. After 24 years, my portfolio will be worth 2x yours and our dividends will be the same (4% = 2 x 2%). After 48 years, my portfolio will be worth 4x yours and my dividends will be 2x yours.  If you are solely concerned with current income and not what your investment income will be decades from now, then I agree a dividend-focused approach can be a good idea so that you can get cash without selling. I agree on never selling -- selling is bad.  However even if you're retired at 30, unless you plan on dying anytime soon, you are going to care what your income will be when you're 50, 60, 70, etc. To get there, you want growth.  Maybe when you have <10 years left to live, your portfolio becomes optimal."

Total return is capital gains + dividends but even though you can access capital gains and there are still some capital gains in a dividend strategy, go back to my simple mathematical example: but focusing on dividends, you forego higher capital gains. Those capital gains today eventually translate into greater dividends tomorrow.  If you're focused on growing dividends, that is almost synonymous with capital gains, dividends grow from retained earnings that get reinvested into the business and materialize as capital gains. The other component of capital gains is the speculative component, which you and I are both ignoring."

Those capital gains today eventually translate into greater dividends tomorrow.   Not necessarily. If a company could go from trading at 20x earnings to 40x earnings, there would be massive capital gains. But that company probably shouldn't double their dividend payments because their stock is trading twice as high.  On the flip side, if that company then starts trading at 20x earnings again, those capital gains are gone simply because the market dictated it. But those dividends would still be coming in steady despite those capital losses.  To me, dividends are the best reason to own a company. I get a share of the profits.

Its dividend stream, per $100 of initial investment, might look like: $5, 5, 5, 5, 5, ... Company B has a 5% earnings yield and distributes a 2% dividend while retaining 3% to reinvest back into the business. Its dividend stream, per $100 of initial investment, might look like: $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 10...   So even ignoring the capital gain component, B's longrun dividend stream is superior to A's because it used retained earnings to grow faster.  So we are both in agreement that dividends are ultimate what matter, and speculative capital gains don't, but you are missing non-speculative capital gains induced by retained earnings that go into growing the business and hence future dividends. You have to look at both present and future dividends, and the relative of importance each depends upon when you need to tap this income."

financialindependence,3dd4dl,stealstea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"i think you will realize this place is rabid in their indexing approach. they will think you have no idea on how stocks work, that you need to focus on total return which means capital gains and dividends.  i think dividend investing can be fundamentally sound. they are business that can consistently pay out cash flow, which means they have a business that is sound.  we just want you to do the right thing. the value investors tend to be cash flow investors buying at a price below its intrinsic value so its like dividend investing.  VIG is an ETF that did not payout all of its dividends as well and focusing on growth.  i personally think dividend stocks alleviate sequence of risk since during a bear you still have much of your units/shares for them to bounce back, versus index investing, where you are selling down your units.  you can always fall back to index investing if it doesnt work out. do it for a while to see how it goes. just because the text book says so doesnt mean u should let it limit you.  a lot of the crux is to keep cost extremely low, and you may be able to do that as an individual investor"

Price only matters when you're buying or selling.   a lot of the crux is to keep cost extremely low, and you may be able to do that as an individual investor   It's easy to do that as an individual investor. By investing in large enough blocks (say $1,000), I can keep my transaction costs down. And because I'm not looking to sell (i.e. my holding period is forever), I my ""expense ratio"" continues to fall because the fee is just a one time thing. Once my portfolio is ""complete"" I never have to pay another dime in transaction fees. With index funds, you're paying some percentage of assets continually.  When I started investing, I was an indexer and bought a couple of Vanguard Index Funds. It's a fantastic strategy. But after reading a bunch of FI blogs, I discovered dividend investing and it appealed to me more as a philosophy. (Letting companies pay me to own them? Yes please!)  Investing is not all about the math. There's a psychological component to it as well."
financialindependence,3dd4dl,btax80,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:36:34 2015 UTC,"i think it is a viable strategy, but also note that your dividend yield will grow, but also that they would fall off. by relying on the yield as your withdrawal rate is ok, but your expense cannot be on par as your withdrawal rate.  if it is any dropoff during a bear will hit your spending power.  as what i told all dvidiend investor, there is no growth investor, dividend investor. everyone is looking for value, that is buying an asset below the intrinsic value.  if you buy dividend stocks tat are overvalued or fairly valued, likely you are in for some hurt."
financialindependence,3dd4dl,btax80,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:16:17 2015 UTC,"Not to downplay those points, and consistent dividends might be more important when retired, but if you're still in the accumulation stage the only thing that matters is the total return.

financialindependence,3dd4dl,fotoman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:57:05 2015 UTC,"but if you're still in the accumulation stage the only thing that matters is the total return.   Dividends provide an outsized portion of total return. Over the last 80 years, dividends are responsible for 44% of the S&P 500's total return.    how has the total return from your portfolio compared to the indices?   According to Vanguard my personal rate of return is 11.4% since October 2011. How that compares to an index like the S&P 500 I don't know. And honestly, I'm not that concerned about outperforming some index. If my portfolio is achieving my goals, why would I care if Warren Buffet is generating twice my returns?  In my opinion, thinking about your investing endgame is much more important than trying to keep up with some arbitrary benchmark. What I like about dividend investing is that I can generate income without having to sell the underlying assets. This allows me to be less concerned with how the market gremlins are valuing my investments. If I relied on selling some portion of my portfolio then I'm subject to selling low if there's a market crash when I need income. Besides, more cash flow is always good.  This isn't to say that index investing and the 4% rule isn't a good strategy. It is. It's simply not the strategy for me."

You shouldn't care about warren buffet (who probably made 30% by the way) but you should probably care a bit about the market as a whole, because it is so easy and cheap to match the market.   In my opinion, thinking about your investing endgame is much more important than trying to keep up with some arbitrary benchmark.   Maybe...  A huge part of getting to the endgame is your return on the way there.. Why not maximize it?

I'd rather work directly toward my end goal than buying an index fund then selling it to purchase my dividend portfolio upon retirement.  I've only been investing since 2011, and this has been quite the bull market. But it (likely) won't be a bull market forever. When it ends, perhaps my portfolio will generate better returns the the market as a whole. Of course, that's not guaranteed, but you never know.  My end game is based solely on dividends, not portfolio value. If my portfolio generates enough income to cover my expenses, then I don't care if it's valued at $1,000 or $1,000,000."

You would never get to FIRE that way anyway. Its just a nice way for moderate-high earners to avoid some taxes, and a convenient way for non-savvy folks to sock away some cash IMHO.  FIRE is easiest achieved by keeping your costs low, and saving as much as possible, first in an emergency fund (3-6mo of expenses) and then in a simple 3-4 ETF fund portfolio. You can play a riskier game by purchasing stocks. You can play a slower game by purchasing bonds. You can diversify by investing in small businesses, startups (risky), real estate and similar non-ETF assets, but the real pattern to success is still keeping your overall expenses low and savings high.  401k is just one element to that."

I would not choose to work at a 401k-less company unless there were other benefits that offset:  higher salary, better equity (either number or quality), more freedom, better quality of life, shorter commute, etc.  If I found a company that was fantastic in many ways but didn't have a 401k..

Equity is a funny thing; I find it impossible to put a realistic dollar value on private-company equity because the range of possibilities is so large and too many variables are unknown and/or out of my control.  I've learned to treat it like a bonus, really nice lotto ticket.  There's probably a 1-5% chance that equity will turn into something meaningful.. which is pretty good in the grand scheme of lotto-like things, but nothing that I would ever want to bank on.  If it becomes worth something, great.  If it fizzles out and is worth nothing, hey I wasn't planning on it being worth anything anyway.  There's another nice rule that comes from this which is.. I will never, ever take on additional expense for this lotto ticket.  There are folks who exercise their options early to try to take advantage of long term capital gains, sometimes having to pay taxes on the phantom gains.. this is so risky.  Also, equity is much more complicated than it may seem on the surface.  I'm far from an expert in this field but I'm aware that there are nuances with regard to different classes of stock, whose shares are purchased in a company buyout, whether options fully vest on buyout, under what circumstances companies can cancel options, and so on."

Employees are usually granted about a year's salary worth of shares that vest over a 4 year period so that can also give you a sense for their value...but take all of this with a grain of salt as the company can do as it pleases."

financialindependence,3d9sj0,maaku7,2,Wed Jul 15 05:45:44 2015 UTC,"That math is wrong. Matches typically match to the percentage of your paycheck that you contribute. If I contribute 3% of my paycheck and I earn $100,000, my match would be $3,000. Matching isn't typically a percentage of the max that you can contribute pre-tax. So depending on how much I earn and how much my company matches, you can actually get quite a bit."

In other words, does your public tech company have 401(k), but doesn't provide a match?  To me, not having a 401(k) plan would be a big disadvantage.  I can see a start-up with <100 employees not having one, but you are giving up substantial value if you are near or over the IRA income limit and don't have access to a 401(k), with or without match.  Match is nice, but in the end it can be made up with a X% pay increase.  X would have to be much larger to make up for the 401(k) itself."

Only one had healthcare, but neither had any 401k or any modicum of honesty/transparency whatsoever.   My favorite is when they tell you that you'll get X# of shares. When my 22 year old self asked how much those shares were valued at and how many shares are available, I was told ""that's a very smart question to ask."" Never heard more about it.   I've learned my lesson. Unless you're a founder, investor or early employee at the next Google/FB, you're quite simply not getting rich. Make sure you really believe in the product and company because if you don't (I didn't), and think you're still going to make a lot of money somehow, you're in for a rude awakening."

financialindependence,3d9sj0,experts_never_lie,3,Wed Jul 15 00:13:28 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter when you join.  What matters is how many shares you get and how well the company is doing and if they will continue to do that well the next few years.  We have people at my company who joined 3 years before I did and got the same amount of shares as I did (15k).  Only difference is there strike price is $0.16 and mine is $0.88.  VCs paid around $7 at our last round and we hope to go public at $15 in the next 24 months.  People think oh I joined too late or that the earlier employees must have some massive advantage on me for taking such a riskier early position with the company.  They don't.  Actually I not only took much less risk, but by joining when the company was already very well funded, I got a market rate salary and the company has still been slow to really bump up the under-market early employees as they feel they don't need to kiss their asses and can get away with small raises.  Either way at $7 or even $15, 15,000 shares isn't a lot of money to be compensated over 4 years.  Risk-free, market rate salary is by far the most important thing."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,greenlamp90,2,Tue Jul 14 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. Give me the salary. I'm really not trying to sound overly confident, but I'm far better at allocating capital than the managers/executives of any of the startups I worked for were.

financialindependence,3d9sj0,hadtoupvotethat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:58:03 2015 UTC,"this is true, but it's actually somewhat standardized across series C+ VC funded startups.  The vast majority of companies IPO in the 12-40 price per share range, so even without knowing shares outstanding if you are joining a company that is already successful and close to IPO, you know a ballpark figure for what they are worth"
financialindependence,3d9sj0,maaku7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"That totally doesn't work, because one of the preparatory steps for that IPO (if it happens) is forward or reverse splits to get the price per share into the acceptable zone.  If you want to go public but a plausible valuation is $1, you will have a 10-15x reverse split, which turns every 10-15 old shares into a new share and brings the new share value into the acceptable range for the IPO.  I've seen 8:1 ratios in the number of shares issued if I compare two successful companies I've been with.  You don't want to misestimate your equity by that much.  Also, if you're joining a successful company that's close to IPO then in my opinion you missed your chance; the number of shares will probably be paltry compared to the people who built the company.  I prefer to start much earlier."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,maaku7,2,Wed Jul 15 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree about ""missing your chance"".  In fact, employees of Google which went public more than a decade ago still get more equity compensation than salary.  I joined a year ago when VCs were paying $5 a share and my strike is $0.88 and received 15,000 shares.  The company had $91M shares outstanding at that time.  Since then, we've done 1 more 10% dilution round but this time VCs paid around $7.  It's completely realistic that we could double in valuation by IPO time in 2 years.  In fact, the public is willing to pay more than VCs as seen by many other IPOs in the same industry, so I'd say we could go public today at $15 a share, and $30 a share is not even that optimistic.  Still, it's not a ton of money since it's over 4 years, but it's definitely not ""missing the boat"".  I believe joining within 1-2 years of IPO, or after IPO is the only good risk/reward time to join a company.  I'd never join a company with less than 150 people.  Way too much risk and the potential reward doesn't even come close to justifying it.  Especially since those small companies usually overwork you and underpay you in current compensation."

I've always been in the first 10, always right after the business plan is solid, seed funding is place, and they need someone to actually build the damn thing.  But I've also seen 10-30x reductions in the equity available to employees as one goes from those founding times to the later times you're talking about, and with comparable salary paths, so I do prefer the early strategy.  It's worked out quite well (2 big successes, out of 4 — far better than VC odds!), yes, with most compensation being from ISOs, but I recognize that this is has been a quite unusual outcome."

Month 4 I asked again for the status of equity and at the very least healthcare since I was no longer on my parent's plan, but still a lot of talk about ""delays with processing, blah blah blah.""   Additionally, still had no product and I was supposed to be selling it to customers despite being 12 months away from shipping 20% of what was promised.

The company doesn't share details such current valuation and total shares issued/outstanding. I've asked many times, but the company policy is to not disclose those numbers. It makes it difficult for me to value my shares.   It's worth close enough to zero as to be meaningless.  If you are not being compensated enough with your salary, you should move. Even if the unlikely happens and you get an exit, you're talking about getting a few tens of thousands at best unless you were a founder or employee number 1-5.  And it's very typical not to get a match - almost no startup matches because they would have to be profitable to be able to properly take advantage of the tax savings."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,Lenify,2,Tue Jul 14 20:40:31 2015 UTC,"exactly. I also learned through experience this very lesson. Take the startup experience for the fun and experience it was, OP, but you should really depend on your salary as the realization of your work, not vague amounts in equity that may or may not ever pay off. Many companies don't even survive long enough to realize the 4 year vesting that most companies require, let alone not also laying off most of the company in that amount of time. It's like taking a long term investment in a highly volatile asset that you continually work for. Salary on the other hand, is always 100% realized every month, unlike equity. I wouldn't take equity unless I was already FI and was looking to do it for fun and not expecting the company to actually pay out."

You'd have to ask someone familiar with Delaware law whether it ""works"" legally, but I would guess that this kind of stunt will not endear you to your bosses either way!  I was also once in a position where I got some options without any idea what % ownership they represent, but this was in a jurisdiction where the number of shares outstanding is a matter of public record - which made it a bit silly of them to not tell me. So I paid a small fee and found out that my options are worth very little.  Now I would just assume the options are worth 0 unless I have data to indicate otherwise. So if the options are basically a ""gift"" then sure, I'll take them - thanks!

financialindependence,3d9sj0,cwenger,6,Tue Jul 14 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"Every company I have worked at except the current one I'm at has had a 401k plan. At the company I'm at now it's because we just got started (I'm a co-founder) and haven't set it up yet. I'm in the process of fixing that.  Not having a plan at all is uncommon. Not having a match is fairly common. I think only one startup I've had an offer at had a match.  As someone who is in the process of getting a 401k setup for his own startup, I can say that it is something every company should have. The cost can be on the order of around a hundred dollars per year per employee which is frankly lost in the noise. That said, such a cheap setup would involve 0.3 - 0.5% added expense ratios (on top of the fund ratio) to the fiduciary company which manages the 401k, and without a match there is no safe harbor protections so it is possible that some contributions will be retroactively taxed. So it's not ideal. But paying 0.5% expense ratios for your vanguard funds and being (maybe) limited to $10k pre-tax contributions instead of $18k is still better than nothing.  I would see if you can convince the company to start a cheap 401k plan using a company like BenefitsGuard, and then maybe consider covering more of the expenses after the next investment round. Baby steps."

Anyway I wanted to get in on the fun, but a few months in I realized that this wasn't sustainable financially. Working for a big company, and a big salary with benefits, isn't as cool, and you will be around people who are probably even less in tune with your values as someone seeking FI and possibly ER. I mean there's a lot of hyper consumerism (fancy new cars, clothes, etc.) in a big company, because the people attracted to these jobs with the big paycheck typically translate that money into material possessions and status symbols. So in a way going from a cool, underpaying startup to a big boring company will feel like you're going from the frying pan into the fire. But you will also make way more money than you're making now, and if your goal is FIRE than I can't recommend it enough. Having been a part of the startup scene, I really feel it is overrated unless you're doing your own startup by yourself or with some friends.

financialindependence,3d9sj0,johnlocke95,3,Tue Jul 14 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"I think that not telling you the % is atypical. How would you determine your risk vs reward from working there?  I also work at a start up. I know my # total of share and current valuation of the company. I use this number to determine how much raises I should ask every 6 months.  Do you guys ever have a company-wide townhall or retrospective meetings? At our company, we used to complain about transparency too. Now things got better, we get to find out about every contracts that are going through the pipeline and how much revenue it would generate etc.  I'd suggest that you find other co-workers who are as passionate about 401k as yourself and then collectively complain. At my small company (10 people), we spent the past few months complaining about not having commuter benefits. We just got that last month. Now my co-workers and I will start complaining about lack of 401k at our next retro meeting."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,randomechoes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"No townhall meetings or retrospectives. The sales team shares new clients within the team, but not with the broader company.   A handful of us have been complaining about lack of 401k for the past year. I haven't seen any progress."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,johnlocke95,2,Tue Jul 14 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"Its atypical, but not as atypical as it should be.  Without knowing the number of shares (always mention fully dilluted, ie with everything accounted for), you basically have no idea what your equity is worth. Its a VERY suspect situation, and you should just assume the equity is worth 0 until you get more information. The problem is now you are a bit in a hole - you need to be firm about asking these questions before you sign the offer. I would never accept an offer from a company that didn't tell me the total # of shares outstanding - its necessary information to be able to correctly evaluate the value of the option grant. 10k shares out of a 1m pool (1%) and 10k shares out of a 10m pool (0.1%) are hugely different things."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,maaku7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:44:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I was naive when I joined the company a year ago. I didn't know that I should ask these questions. The reason I'm asking on Reddit now is because I'm thinking about whether I should stay with this company. I tried asking these questions after I joined as I learned more about how equity works. I didn't get much information."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,maaku7,3,Tue Jul 14 18:53:42 2015 UTC,"Tech accountant here. Quick answer regarding stock is unless you have preferred shares (unlikely as a standard employee), you're probably getting $0 when the company is acquired. Going public is different, but only slightly."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,synackrst,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:59:32 2015 UTC,How is going public different?
financialindependence,3d9sj0,CaribbeanDreams,2,Tue Jul 14 23:06:42 2015 UTC,"Mainly because you can't simply ""go public"". It's an intensive process which takes years of planning and preparation. Private companies are easier to dilute common shares as you can simply issue more and more.   That's about as ELI5 as I can do here really."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,uber_neutrino,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:15:09 2015 UTC,Thanks! Just wanted to hear your thoughts on how going public affects employee shares.
financialindependence,3d9sj0,CaribbeanDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"If you can, make friends with someone in Finance. They'll know whether or not there's any chance you'll be looking to go public in the near future."
financialindependence,3d9sj0,neur0,3,Wed Jul 15 15:38:30 2015 UTC,"I have equity in the company, but I'm not sure what it's worth. The company doesn't share details such current valuation and total shares issued/outstanding. I've asked many times, but the company policy is to not disclose those numbers. It makes it difficult for me to value my shares.   that equity is almost certainly worth nothing."
financialindependence,3dc6cp,cashoutdbplan,5,Wed Jul 15 03:11:35 2015 UTC,"So if you take option C, you've got $680k to work with right now, $1 million locked up in real estate, $710k locked up in retirement accounts and another $3k/month income starting 7 years from now.   If I were you, I would just cut the lifestyle down a bit more and live on $5k/month (which is roughly 4% of 1.68 million). Perhaps I would supplement that with odd jobs, perhaps you or your wife knows a job that pays like $1k or $2k per month, or a consulting gig where you're working for a few months but then earn enough to cover some extra expenses throughout the year. Then, a few years from now, that could be upped to $8k/month as your wife's pension plan start paying out.   This would be me. I'd value my freedom more than the difference between $5k and $6k per month of expenses. I would also want to be pretty safe, hence the 4% of $1.68 million rule, which would leave all pension money intact and free to grow until official retirement age."
financialindependence,3dc6cp,Voerendaalse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:02:58 2015 UTC,This is where I have been leaning - thank you for your thoughtful reply.
financialindependence,3dc6cp,Voerendaalse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. One more thing: can you calculate how profitable the rentals are for you? If they are not bringing in enough money, perhaps it would be better to sell them and invest the money elsewhere? I'm not familiar with being a landlord, but if it's a lot of hassle and you're not sure whether it's profitable, maybe selling is the better option."
financialindependence,3dc6cp,cptnrandy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:41:45 2015 UTC,Here's the way an economist would look at the risk: what if you live to 100? The defined benefit would be powerful. I'd say leave it and collect starting at 65.
