Admittedly our cost on this is going to be a little higher than sources you can find on eBay or Amazon. That being said we offer something these suppliers can't: genuine OEM quality parts that come with a Lifetime warranty. We believe we have the best the market has to offer on parts and tools. Everyone makes this claim but we back it up with a warranty that covers the part to be free from defect for life.  That's even better than the limited one year warranty the manufacturer provides! Learn more about our quality by going to http://ifixit.com/quality. Email me or respond here if you have any questions/concerns: mattz@ifixit.com"

Nexus7,3dkxvb,DaRealGuster,2,Fri Jul 17 02:45:19 2015 UTC,Why don't you just organize it yourself by creating a sensical directory structure using a file manager such as ES File Explorer?
Nexus7,3dkxvb,smoresrock,2,Fri Jul 17 05:07:22 2015 UTC,Because I had never heard of ES file manager up until this point. Thanks though.
Nexus7,3dkxvb,darthjoey91,3,Fri Jul 17 12:16:00 2015 UTC,Try Solid Explorer instead. Es File Explorer uses Baidu.

Nexus7,3diask,LH99,4,Thu Jul 16 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't tamper with it, upgrading should be fine. If you're really paranoid about it, you can just unlock the bootloader and manually flash the 5.1.1 rom (and since you seem to know your way around jailbreaking, it shouldn't be that hard for you to figure out  There's plenty of tutorials online that could help you do this. Just be careful. If you need me to point you in the right direction,  I'll be happy to do so"
Nexus7,3diask,SDCored,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:40:00 2015 UTC,unlocking the bootloader seems easy enough. I'll look into it a bit more. Seems like it'd be a smart idea before she starts using it. Thanks for offering to help.
Nexus7,3diask,TheStinkySkunk,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"Unlocking the bootloader is one of the easiest things ever. Just look up Wugfresh. It's a simple process that provides fast and easy results. Word to the wise, if you install a new version of Android via Wugfresh or CM's installer it will cut your total memory in half. So instead of having 32Gb Android will say you only have 16Gb. The fix for this easy. Just factory reset the tablet. It took me forever to figure that out.   If you have any questions, feel free to Pm. I'm not saying that I'm a huge Android guru, but I've been using it since it's early days. And if I don't know the answer, my roommate is amazing with Android.  Also great buy! I love my 2013 Nexus 7. Seriously one of the best pieces of technology I've purchased."
Nexus7,3diask,SDCored,2,Thu Jul 16 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"So after installing a ROM, do a factory reset?  Thanks!"
Nexus7,3diask,SDCored,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, did a bit of looking. Sounds like I'll want to unlock and root for sure before doing anything, but what would be the benefit of manually flashing the 5.1.1 rom? I see that these are custom roms created for various reasons. Are some of these more reliable?   On apple devices if you jailbreak and then upgrade to a new OS version, you lose your jailbreak. Is this the same for Android? As in: if I unlock, root, and then upgrade to 5.1.1 via normal upgrade methods, will I have to unlock and root again?"
Nexus7,3diask,SDCored,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"I'll answer these in reverse order for convenience.  You don't lose your root/unlocked bootloader if you flash a new rom/OS. It's possible to unroot/lock your bootloader again, but normally OS's don't do that themselves.  As for the OS itself, it really depends. The benefit to flashing instead of waiting for an Over The Air (OTA) update is   You get it quicker It's less damaging to the flash memory (which is used when upgrading OS's), since recently there's been quite a few (but not a lot) of instances where 2013 Nexus 7's are bricked cause the flash memory is corrupt.   You could go with stock Lollipop 5.1.1, but there's also other OS's that might run well. A huge one nowadays is Cyanogen Mod. It's stock Android with a lot of improvements and customisations. You can customize the theme of the phone (navigation buttons, status bar, notification drawer, text, icons, etc.) And it comes with enhanced security features and the like. There's also SlimKat, which runs on 4.4.4 KitKat instead of Lollipop, and is said to be a lot more stable and faster (but that's your choice.)  Ultimately, it's up to what you and her would want in an OS. I personally suggest either stock 5.1.1 or Cyanogen Mod, but that's just me"
Nexus7,3diask,SDCored,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"Well, if this were my machine, I'd probably be a lot more willing to play around and customize it. Being that it's going to be my girlfriend's, I'd probably go with the stock 5.1.1. So you'd advise manually flashing it in order to avoid using the flash memory?  I found a really good link for restoring a soft-bricked machine, as well as tuts on how to unlock, root, and backup using titanium backup. I think I'll go through all of that just to have a safety net in the future for her should something happen.  Thanks again for all the info. It's much appreciated."
Nexus7,3diask,Bogdacutu,2,Thu Jul 16 16:31:51 2015 UTC,"You still use flash memory, but it's not as damaging as you don't have to do every update from 4.3 and up.  I'm glad to help you out, dude, I hope she enjoys the present"
Nexus7,3diask,SDCored,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"alright, so everything with the nexus 7 is going fine. in the middle of downloading and flashing a stock android rom, but the latest one I could get was 5.1 (LMY470). The machine came with LRX22G.  I thought there was a 5.1.1 for the 2013 nexus 7 model that fixed some bugs? Thoughts?"
Nexus7,3diask,int0x191f2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:54 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, yes, there are 2 releases of 5.1.1 for the 2013 N7 (both are bug fixes and stuff). It's safe to assume that those are OTA updates specific to the device and they just aren't big enough to be flashed (since they're bug fixes and not the OS itself).  The OTA is no more than 50MB total so you should have no problem installing them."
Nexus7,3diask,Ejnar10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"ok, so I'll do the OTA update after the flash is finished.  Having trouble rooting. I chose the option 2 to root and install some custom software. The machine then started up into teamwin. the SDK software was saying that recovery was not detected, hit enter to try again, a to abort, or h for help. I know I went back and downloaded the correct drivers. Got stuck, so re-flashing. Not sure what to do after that in order to root.  Do I need to root at this point? I thought I had to in order to make a full backup."
Nexus7,3diask,doggexbay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"If you have TWRP, you should just be able to make a full backup from there, though I'm not sure because I've not had that much experience with it.

Nexus7,3diask,midvale_school,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"You don't lose your root/unlocked bootloader if you flash a new rom/OS. It's possible to unroot/lock your bootloader again, but normally OS's don't do that themselves.   flashing factory images from Google (or any ROM that doesn't have superuser built-in) will unroot the device (but the bootloader will remain unlocked, so rerooting is very simple)"

Nexus7,3diask,ithilkir,2,Fri Jul 17 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"The Nexus 7 2013 is one of my all time favorite tablets because of bang-for-your-buck ratio.  The rule I follow when updating any piece of software:  Are the features included in the update worth the risk?   Depending on what the tablet will be used for should really help you to decide if the upgrade is worth it. For example: if the tablet will be only used for Netflix, light web browsing, or YouTube, then an older version of Android is fine. If you have done research and found features you think would be useful, then upgrade at the cost of a potential speed loss.  When I had a Nexus 7 I did notice a performance drop when updating to Lollipop, but nothing that made the tablet completely unusable.   Luckily, Nexus devices can be upgraded and downgraded whenever you want. Worst case is you don't want lollipop, so you downgrade."

The system image doesn't fall apart since it rarely changes. Set the data to f2fs. That should be all you need.  Just in case, make sure you're using a kernel that supports f2fs. I have CM 12.1 running on my N7s with f2fs.  Just checked your ROM link. It says it supports f2fs and explicitly says not to change system but only data and cache.  Do that.  Good luck!"
