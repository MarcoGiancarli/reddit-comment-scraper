Trove,3e2sgf,RoboHS,99,Tue Jul 21 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is a well thought out post that deserves a response.  I think you definitely hit a few areas where we're currently 'light' and are planning future updates to address.  Specifically, our next update: The Shadow Tower is focused on that mid-to-end game play. We'll be adding tougher challenges, more power-based unlocked rewards, and we hope some friendly competition. On top of that we're working on a pvp mode and in a future update we'll be adding club functionality that encourages team play.  When it comes to the cash shop I do think ours is pretty fair and on-par with other games. You can earn a lot of Cubits pretty quickly to unlock additional classes and we're going to continue adding badges that will expand on this. None of it is essential, and most people will be able to earn what they want over time if they're intending to play for free."
Trove,3e2sgf,AvaremTheDev,18,Tue Jul 21 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"Hey Avarem, thanks for the reply.  After playing for a while, I also feel that the cash shop is pretty fair. My only gripe with it is the patron bonus that grants 2 additional flask uses. I feel that this can be a pretty big ""power buy"" especially when you use a flask such as the bandolier to get the most out of emblem uses.  Perhaps that bonus could be replaced with something else that's still quite useful but not as involved (and I would argue, a necessity) for combat? Thanks!"
Trove,3e2sgf,KroSSH,6,Tue Jul 21 20:02:23 2015 UTC,"Everything of usefulness can be attained through playing the game. The game is F2P, this is how they make money. You pay for convenience of getting it today rather than in a week or two (since we can get about 4500 cubits a week).  One thing I never understood is in a coop game where you work together and there aren't raids with gear scores, why would it matter if someone else has something you don't have a little earlier than you? This seems to be a complaint in almost every MMO."

Trove,3e2sgf,guy121,3,Tue Jul 21 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"Correction: ""My only gripe with it is the patron bonus that grants 2 additional flask uses"". He's saying patron is a ""power buy"" because it gives extra flasks which can be great. But in fairness I very rarely feel the need to refill my flasks, and since you get quite a few from mastery level you still have enough.  I've seen people complain about patron quite a bit, and I can see where they are coming from since it's a P2P thing that gives gameplay benefits, but for the most part it's not big enough for it to give a massive edge, especially not since PvP isn't added yet. If you were to give +2 flasks in PvP I would start getting worried"
Trove,3e2sgf,Corpeater,2,Tue Jul 21 21:52:37 2015 UTC,Patron will be tradeable in the future for in game currency AFAIK

Trove,3e2sgf,mipbar,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I see the flask thing as a more convenience based thing; less trips back to your corner stone. I still have the start flasks that you start with, and I have no had much issue of running out, and two additional is a very small number, especially so if you run the bandolier."
Trove,3e2sgf,Lunaria-Stalis,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Well base is 40% Bandolier is more flask uses to trigger emblems, but at a heal rate of 20% so the percent of heal is actually around the same."
Trove,3e2sgf,LUCKERD0G,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but for example, two extra 20% healing healing is not that great. But two extra 40% is way more useful. So point being: If you use the bandolier, then you get less out of those two extra flask than someone who uses the other types, since it does not scale. :P"
Trove,3e2sgf,Lunaria-Stalis,6,Tue Jul 21 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"Please don't lightly add ""friendly competition""  The reason I love Trove is its absence of competitiveness.  I have to fight and challenge people in the rat-race of everyday life and I don't want to have to do that in a game, much less a fun and relaxing title like Trove.    I liked Rift at launch, but what quickly turned me away from the game were the contribution rewards that the game had when it released.  I play PvE because I truly like to cooperate with fellow gamers, not challenge them.  These systems change the attitudes that players use when they see each other and alter the entire social atmosphere of the game.  Please don't replace Trove's laidback and whimsical feeling by encourage in-fighting and elitism.  Not everyone shares the same viewpoints, just take that into consideration.  I fear changes like this will drive some from the game."
Trove,3e2sgf,ThorneZero,3,Wed Jul 22 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  It seemed to me the goal and explicit design of the game was to encourage cooperation,  foster positive social interaction,  and allow you to loot items that might also be purchased in the shop.    I wonder if anyone feels the patron fee is a tad to high to incite much long term interest?   14 bucks for one month with the current level cap, queues,  and lag?  That's asking a lot at this stage of development."
Trove,3e2sgf,Relax_Panda,2,Wed Jul 22 03:51:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, its a fun co-op game, there is no need to add PVP.  Plus do you realize how much will change when you have to start balancing the classes for PVP vs PVE? Its going to be a mess.   Leave it as a pure PVE game."
Trove,3e2sgf,SystemAbend,2,Wed Jul 22 06:44:41 2015 UTC,Yeah cubit are easy to earn but you have constantly removed items that could be purchased with cubit and converted them to cash only
Trove,3e2sgf,Prodigal_Ink,2,Wed Jul 22 12:21:31 2015 UTC,"Down vote away because that's what I expect for an opinion that's probably not popular...  That isn't really what Trove was for me so I can't say I'd keep playing with a focus on ""friendly competition.""  What I liked about Trove was that it wasn't like a traditional MMO where you had to team up just to get content finished.  And if you did team up it was in a really loose, no pressure way.  One of the worst things about RIFT was their contribution system that was scrapped after its release.  If you're adding DPS meters or boards for PvE like that, I don't see myself playing anymore.  I know some people like that, but I think it will be detrimental to an already increasingly toxic community.    For the most part, people are nice on Trove.  Since its hard launch, though, it's getting bad.  I just keep chat turned off because I don't want to see the arguing, name-calling, and, holy crap, e-peening.  Adding a system for people to peacock with will just exacerbate this situation.  The introduction of PvP doesn't really bother me; however, I know the classes will take a hit based on PvP feedback.  That sucks.  I can't comment on the addition of Shadow Tower content because I don't know how bad it will be.  I don't expect much, though.  I expect raid-like content that ruins the overall PvE experience by creating content with forced grouping in order to ""earn"" the best gear.  What would be great is if both these features were truly optional and had no mastery tied to them, but I'm afraid that's not going to be the case.  EDIT:  I really don't have a problem with the cash shop.  The dragon cashes are a little too pricey, in my opinion.  They should have been comparable to the chaos chests, but I think most things are fairly priced."

Trove,3e2sgf,guy121,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"As well thought out as this post may be, it makes a huge assumption in that the combat rpg element of the game is the sole focus when it clearly isn't. Of course in a dedicated action RPG the lack of a meaningful end game would be problematic, but Trove is also about community, creation, freedom, empowerment. It's nearly entirely driven by goals the player makes for themselves. If that goal is only to get the best gear and progress RPG-wise then this of course wouldn't be the game for you. As it is I think Trove has a great core from which to build."

Mostly i still stick around because of the building aspect of the game, community and merchanting which i find a lot of fun. Hopefully in the future they make the game a lil more complex to satisfy more people"
Trove,3e2sgf,Kalegris,12,Tue Jul 21 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"this game is meant for casual players sadly   I agree with this. I had to rewire my brain when I started playing this game. When I first started playing I tried to play the game like any other MMO (WoW is a good example). In truth though this game is an MMO Collectathon game disguised as an RPG. The goal of the game is to get all the collectables for the sake of getting all the collectable. The stats dont matter.   For example right now in my Corner stone has a room that Im currently filling up the walls with head statues. I have another room dedicated to collecting all the plushies. Another room just for collecting paintings. Etc etc. The game is an MMO version of adventure platformer's like Spyro, Rayman, or Banjo.   Thats how I view the game at least, and I definitely understand how that may not appeal to a ton of people."

Trove,3e2sgf,Daiwon,4,Tue Jul 21 16:15:48 2015 UTC,As someone who doesnt have time and the stamina to play such a game all day it's pretty well balanced. Also I don't want to level one hour between every dungeon or getting stuck in one because it's to hard to do it alone.
Trove,3e2sgf,Benjirich,7,Tue Jul 21 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"The gameplay loop is basic and it's meant to keep you playing for as long as possible. The longer you play, the more money you potentially spend. This has always been a key point for MMOs, considering most of them used to work off subscription plans. The more you played, the more money you paid into a subscription.  That being said, this is a free to play game. So they're squeezing money out of you with quality of life enhancements. For example, you're going to fill up your personal chest after awhile. If you play this game a lot, that's probably going to lead to you buying a chest upgrade. They just want to keep you long enough to see some of that money thrown their way.  However, and here's the counter argument, that's really easy to avoid. You can get another two chest tabs by creating a club and using the community and officer chests. As long as you don't invite anyone to your club, they're completely free for you to use by yourself.  Really, I don't see a problem with their implementation of the cash shop. Trion has always taken a ""pay for convenience"" approach. Either you can play and spend time for what you want or you can spend money. Everything that effects gameplay can be bought through simply playing the game, even though it might take awhile. Then again, the game is meant to be played over a long span of time. That's why you only get 500 cubits a day. After awhile, that's going to add up.  So the point I'm trying to make here is that the game is meant to keep you playing, it's designed that way. It's either that or your one of those people that has tons of money to drop on the game, a ""whale"". It's either time or money, so you've got to decide which you would rather pay Trion with.   Overall, I still think it's a great game. It follows the loop of a lot of great games that I like; Borderlands, Terraria, and Diablo to name a few. It's loot, kill, upgrade, and repeat. That's all it is and it's not for everyone. Some people will find it repetitive and extremely boring, it even gets that way for me eventually. Though I hope Trove will release new and interesting content that will sate my interests.  Anyways, great write-up! You brought forth some valid points that I know some people are feeling. I hope what I've written here can give you a view from the other side of the table. Though, as always, have fun! You can add me in-game if you want, I plan to go do some SAs this evening; if you'd like to join."
Trove,3e2sgf,Firebomb_Souls,5,Tue Jul 21 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I do wholesomely agree that this game is geared towards casual players, but it is as hardcore as you want to make it. Depending on your definition of hardcore.  I think you had the best write-up here, honestly. I agree mostly with what you said. The game isn't for everybody, I used to be a super hardcore gamer, any freetime was spent gaming. I decided I didn't want to do that anymore, but I didn't want to stop playing games, but it was hard to find a non-competitive game that grabbed my attention, until Trove.  Like you said the game is meant to be played for a long time. The key is not to devote all your time to one thing, you end up feeling burnt out. I focus on building up my club, then I decide I want to Fish, then I go and do shadow arenas, or maybe I'll try my luck with the market. Sometimes I'll do gardening. I think people put too much focus on the combat side of things when there is a lot of other things to do in the game.   I think joining or creating a club is a key aspect also. Part of the game is also the community. I started a club about 5 days ago, I spent the first 3-4 creating 5 zones and a hub. Then I spent 1 day recruiting. I already have 30+ great members who are always spending time talking and chilling. I honestly spend time just fishing in my club and talking."
Trove,3e2sgf,RagingBearFish,15,Tue Jul 21 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"That's not a problem with Trove, it's your problem with mmorpgs. You described every single mmorpg ever made.  You don't have to collect or purchase anything in the shop and you can trade for any of it fairly cheaply.   Trove at its core is about building, being creative and showing your house/club world off. The combat side is just to delay the recipe collection."
Trove,3e2sgf,Troviana,8,Tue Jul 21 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If I want a heavily competitive game I play LOL. If I want a WOW progression, I play WoW or Rift or EQ.  If I want open world mmo then I play gw2. If i want a more traditional mmo game with action combat then I play TERA.   Trove is for Minecraft fans. Explore for a bit, then build stuff. Craft stuff, then play with your appearance. Fly around the world, build defensive forts, create bomb craters...the game is what you make of it."
Trove,3e2sgf,Bears_Rock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:46 2015 UTC,Heavily competitive game and LOL do not belong in the same sentence.

Trove,3e2sgf,AhYehAhYeh,4,Wed Jul 22 11:23:28 2015 UTC,"yess, you understand it. people expect trove to be a solid mmorpg and its.. not, it never tried to be, and i love it for that."
Trove,3e2sgf,objectual,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:12 2015 UTC,"Just started playing 2 days ago. I haven't really played the game as I'm being tortured waiting for the queue. I can't really give any other opinions about the things you talked about as I'm just at the start of the game and missions. I love the building mode as it brings some creativity and a minecraft-like (I said like. I used to play Minecraft but now I hate it) experience from crafting and mining. Anyways, I believe shop prices are insanely high for a game like this..."
Trove,3e2sgf,TheMexicanRobot01,9,Tue Jul 21 21:27:06 2015 UTC,I agree but that's the same as Diablo and it is pretty successful. But I understand you and agree. Even though I'm enjoying it i feel it lacks something
Trove,3e2sgf,br0wski,17,Tue Jul 21 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it is similar to diablo with gear progression, diablo offers a highly competitive game where as Trove does not provide ANY competition, no pvp and no ladder rankings nothing for a player to ""peacock"" which is what most people aim for in games, to be the best and have something to show for it."
Trove,3e2sgf,Stawmy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:43 2015 UTC,Now you said it all. I was waiting for the PVP card. That's what I think this game needs. I'm a solo player and I play for the PVP basically and I was kinda sad when I realized that there are no pvp areas/ arenas on Trove :\ Maybe one day.
Trove,3e2sgf,br0wski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:18 2015 UTC,The game NEEDS to add PVP for the competitive people.
Trove,3e2sgf,WilldCard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:24 2015 UTC,Indeed. I NEED IT IN MY VEINS. On a serious note: I really think that it is a must have. Nowadays everybody is extremely competitive and it would make the game much more interesting.
Trove,3e2sgf,br0wski,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say everybody. I know a lot of people who only play PvE games and to me it feels that's the audience Trove is trying to capture. Sure they could add pvp, it couldn't hurt, but if they do, it would likely only be after they have safely secured their intended fan base."
Trove,3e2sgf,zylofan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:36 2015 UTC,hm I guess you're right... I wasn't seeing this from that perspective. I'm always looking for the PVP ahah!
Trove,3e2sgf,br0wski,4,Tue Jul 21 19:51:27 2015 UTC,Its funny you say that because I have often compared Trove to a blend of Diablo and MineCraft. Its not dark and demonic at all but the underlying concept is the same - gear up to tackle the same dungeons/monsters with more hit points and dps.
Trove,3e2sgf,terrordrone_nl,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"What does that have to do with Minecraft? I'm just wondering why people keep comparing Trove to Minecraft, like Minecraft is the only game to ever have squares for terrain."
Trove,3e2sgf,Kuro_yami,8,Tue Jul 21 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"Its like minecraft with cubeworlds style. Minecraft is just the most popular game of its type, so that's what people compare it too. If it didn't have the building system like it does then it would just be an mmo version of cubeworld."
Trove,3e2sgf,SirDaemos,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:22 2015 UTC,Trove is similar to minecraft in the crafting and building aspects of the game. You mine blocks and gather resources to craft decorative blocks and items. You have a cornerstone which is basically a mobile house which you can build from the ground up. Then there are club worlds where you can build entire cities or whatever else strikes your fancy.
Trove,3e2sgf,jollyfreek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"The only difference is that Diablo has a leaderboard, which gives people incentive to continue pushing higher. Trove does not, and the end-game will be abysmal until it figures out an endgame system that provides competitiveness and replayability."
Trove,3e2sgf,BuiltonSin,5,Tue Jul 21 18:31:24 2015 UTC,"I agree that the adventure mode is lacking. The game is far from perfect, I could list numerous problems and bugs. How I feel and think about the game, it is how Minecraft should have been. Admitedly Minecraft is more perfected and rounded, but it's adventure mode has nothing on Trove.  I spent a long time in Minecraft creating things that no-body would ever see and adventure mode just involves killing singular enemies. Trove fixes both of these problems for me.  Yes, all the classes are basic, there requires almost no skill, getting your items to an ever increasing level, etc. It's fun, and it is getting massively popular. In a few months of playing the game has dramatically changed, and will continue to change.  It might not be for everyone but I love it. The only times I have hated it is using Terraforming, ruined 3 club worlds, numerous crafted buildings that took weeks, lots of sets of portals, dragon crucible etc. Just to be told ""Terraforming works as intended"" (Clearly BS) and therefore I lost those things. Must have spent well over 10k infinium and 100k flux trying to constantly replace these things to glitches (I have learnt to wait for the fireworks, but with so many glitches I thought no fireworks was another glitch, until I turned around). Then a day later they say they are backing up club worlds from previous. Why didn't they say they could do that for my club world and admit when they messed up. Sorry for the rant, bad experience with Trove support."
Trove,3e2sgf,DC_Groova,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"I know the game is new (to steam anyways) But i am curious of what their expansion plans are, or at least what their goal is for ""end game"" content if there is one. Have they stated anywhere if they want to go the raid route and be like any other mmo? If so they certainly need some kind of aggro table or taunting mechanism and possibly a healing class.   -OR-  Will they just continue to add to the U1-6 tiers with gear and sprinkle in things like sky world.      I do understand they were surprised at the level of interest steam gave them  but I would assume they expected interest for their game to peak with the added eyeballs steam gives developers. Hopefully they will give us insight on their future goals...ideas....plans now that they know people are very interested in the future of trove."
Trove,3e2sgf,MrFluffyWaffles,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're still not at the ""full game release"" even though it's out on Steam.  We don't have THAT many different things to do, THAT many skills, or THAT many boss fights.    Personally I'm waiting on PVP and more end-game content to see if they can give a long-term goal to the veteran players like myself.  As an ex-Runescape player, I can get into a good grind or a good mini-game that takes more than a one-week grind to complete.  I want to see Trove implement more difficult, lasting content.  Grinding classes to 20 doesn't take long.  Leveling skills to 250 doesn't take long.  Collecting the new collectable update things never takes very long.    I feel like badge expansion was a step in the right direction though - truly difficult grinding tasks for those that could handle it with beautiful rewards.    Now I'd love to see something that took a lot of skill.  PVP might open that door, but we'll have to wait and see how it is implemented."
Trove,3e2sgf,Xatencio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:56:49 2015 UTC,"You make some fair enough points, but I'm 100% certain that Trion isn't going to wrap development up and stop adding stuff.  If Trove generates a nice, solid niche following like their other popular game, Rift, we're in for some exciting things in the next few years."
Trove,3e2sgf,JinxOnDrugs,2,Wed Jul 22 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"Inevitably you will spend hundreds of hours collecting and upgrading your gear,   Took me 150 hours to get all radiant, smh"
Trove,3e2sgf,SirVerex,3,Wed Jul 22 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with your statement, although 'pvp biomes' are debatable. The game and even the devs mentioned pvp was never suitable at the current combat mechanics. They've mentioned it now, but previously said Trove was ""Never"" going to focus on PvP in the past. Great post tho! We all understand that feeling."
Trove,3e2sgf,ferchomax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:15 2015 UTC,They said that they'll be doing pvp tho
Trove,3e2sgf,SirVerex,3,Tue Jul 21 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"I've just mentioned that as well if ya read, I'm just saying they mentioned in the past they would never involve PvP. Its just high demand from new players that they're thinking about it."
Trove,3e2sgf,ferchomax,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:11:30 2015 UTC,Yea sorry read too fast
Trove,3e2sgf,Nissalee,3,Tue Jul 21 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember what Trove is. It's a voxel MMORPG that doesn't delve deep into anything, but covers just about everything. We have tons of collections, dress-up, housing, leveling, different classes,professions,  mounts, and pets. However, Trove does not do any of these on a deep scale, except collecting and housing. Everything else is easy to get into and work with for long periods if you do not overdo it.  I think too many people are coming from Theme Park MMO's, like WoW, where they expect things to go in some specific order. We quest, level, do dungeons, then raid. Trove does do things like that. It's a sandbox that allows you to do whatever you want, whenever you want. The only ""order"" is gearing to get into harder versions of the adventure worlds. The game is casual, and perfectly so. If a player goes out and pushes to max Mastery by collecting everything and leveling everything, that's end-game. They soak up all the content quickly, leaving the weekly/monthly patches to seem less important because of their size.  This is my sometimes game. I play this when I don't have a lot of time. I hop on and do some challenges and collect what I can. I've been doing pretty well with this, and still have stuff to do even at Mastery 145. For those who want something more, maybe you need to go back to your favorite MMO or look into some that have just gone F2P. This game won't ever be in that same category."
Trove,3e2sgf,Halyon,3,Tue Jul 21 19:46:43 2015 UTC,I feel we're overlooking the 30min+ fucking queue times..

And to be honest, there aren't many games you will ""play forever"" without getting bored of it after a while (except Hearthstone :3 )"
Trove,3e2sgf,MissSarah90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"I've played since Closed Beta, so I've stuck around a while and I have never spent money in the shop because of the prices they are asking for. You made a very good point about that plus the converter is a brilliant idea! They are always looking for new ways to use up glim seeing as it's so accessible.  The PvP side of things, I've been saying to many people that they need this! It should be optional for players (I'm not too bothered about actually playing PvP), but biomes that players can go to queue for such a thing is an excellent idea.  I do consider myself a casual gamer but also hardcore, I can get lost in this game for hours! No reason at all! And I often get left with the feeling of not actually achieving anything, the only real thing I feel I've managed to do in that time is build something new in my Club.   I like the idea of leveling gear and the fact that it'll take a long time to do all the challenge/SA farming needed to gain shadow gear to level up separately to then decon for your own gear leveling. However I think you're suggestion of making it more personalized would improve this section hugely!  I can see why there is no real end game bosses, otherwise they will have to actually make expansions like other MMO's. However they constantly add new things to the game, constantly add better game fixes and such. This makes it a little more worthwhile to continue playing.   My real issue is, they've limited the building side of things. At least  in a game like Minecraft you can make half blocks and there's a science behind the electrics using powder and laying it in the right way. Here, Trove missed a trick. I know this game isn't Minecraft and has it's own ID but if you're going to make a game that will always be compared to Minecraft, at least make it everything Minecraft is and MORE!!"
Trove,3e2sgf,Nolph97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"This game still has a lot to come hopefully. I haven't spent any money on it yet, but a lot of my time. I have 109 Hours in less than a week and i'm starting to slow down a bit."
Trove,3e2sgf,AkaviriDragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"When people get to my club, at that point, they're pretty much bored of the game. When I show them they can play football, the game is fun again. They want to find more fun things. Minigames are a blast. They also want to show everyone what cool items or mounts or allies they have after seeing the ones we have. And of course they start building and increasing their professions and have fun that way too. For me, mercantilism (buying, selling and negotiating prices) is also a difficult but rewarding experience, feeling like a skill of its own and allowing me to meet new people (altough i've heard people say they're rather have the process automated with convenience of an auction house).  The ""Get Loot To Get Loot"" system is only a means of progression, not a terrible one, but one I dislike in all games, just as I do with levels. They're an artificial waste of time. A means to give an illusion of progress. Its fine to have some, but then the developers start adding more and it gets so convoluted, stale, boring, its just a grind to see who can put more time into a grinding, ugh. And as soon as an expansion comes it, its obsolete. They forget the main focus: the gameplay. I prefer gameplay, always. Games like devil may cry 3 have a system of progress to aid you as you play...should you not be a good enough player to beat the boss that must grind.. that'll help, but the focus is still the gameplay. Same with games like stepmania. In these games, YOU become better, your reflexes and playstyle dictate whether you win or lose, rather than an artificial bar becoming bigger, and that's what I enjoy about them. I get better, not the little bar on the bottom of the screen.  I feel this game took inspiration from guild wars 2 in some aspects. I'd love to see the giant boss battles from there aswell. (altough i'd question whether they have the hardware for it right now)."

I look at trove as about 55 - 65% content complete, and over the next few months more of the game will come.     RNG could use some work, the one huge plus is it's a fairly positive and friendly community, with multiple chat channels, and easy way to block people.   It's fun casual game, and there's is enough content to play for free with out spending money.

I mean what do you do after you've done all the objectives?  Sure you could go ahead and collect the items you don't have. But the whole difficulty in dungeons are gone, there needs to be something that forces the player to take the dungeons step-by-step. Instead of just rushing it through with a quick mount or a 28 jump to the top level. That and perhaps something a little different than just open world mass dungeon spawns, perhaps one that is purely just one massive randomised dungeon, or heck, a lore based world that can give randomised quests to travel across the land to gain specific loot.  All it takes is a little thought and this game could be a great MMO, as it stands it's fun to play but repetitive after Uber 1."

This is a game I have started and stopped a lot since its early access launch, but I agree with what you said and its what has kept me from ever diving too deep into it.

Trove,3e2sgf,AKABoondock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"I started the game two days ago. Queue times are brutal and I feel like it takes forever to unlock classes. Granted a lot of the classes feel the same (Ive created a few accounts) but Im a bit peeved I can't play the class I want to play the most unless I spend money right away. I want to love this game and I'm enjoying it so far.   Maybe classes need a few more skills and more difficult content to compensate? Hard to say considering I'm fairly new. But if there were more skills, classes might feel more unique. Or some sort of customization options."

Trove,3e2sgf,NovaStoneReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:15:25 2015 UTC,"I think you might be missing part of the point of the game.  Yes, the combat is fairly shallow, we are sitting at release of a game that is intended to be expanded upon. They have already announced that their next plan is to start implementing more complex boss creatures, so to me it seems like the combat aspect will work itself out to be deeper, given enough time. Whether or not that amount of time is reasonable or not, we'll have to see.  But Trove does try to be more than just a dungeon grinding combat focused MMO. Creating club worlds and expanding them with neat structures is supposed to be one of selling points of the title. And if you disregarding it completely then I feel you might have misunderstood the advertisement of the title. Indeed, we have professions and dungeon loot centred around unlocking more types of structures and building blocks.  I agree that Trove isn't an amazing game, and I do agree with the statement that it has potential, but isn't quite there yet. But then, point me at any MMO that was amazing at launch?"
Trove,3e2sgf,zozo5002,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"completely agree, the game is way too two dimensional... i just got to the shadow items and i find out that this is it, the shadow items are the last items... it would be really cool if there were unique items or something or more qualities of items, and there needs to be something that you are progressing to, although that is probably a lot less easy to fix...  the combat while feeling kind of fun with the effects and stuff is way too shallow... it's a bit like minecraft combat, a little deeper than that but pretty close... you just click over and over again and occasionally press another button or two... it would be cool if there were elemental weapons and monsters or hidden stats ect ect ect  i also wish leveling was a tiny bit faster... i can only get up one or maybe two levels a day unless i just grind and grind for the sake of just leveling up..."
Trove,3e2sgf,NovaStoneReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:03 2015 UTC,Um there is something after shadow items its called radiant gear....
Trove,3e2sgf,ClaudeKenni,0,Wed Jul 22 02:54:19 2015 UTC,Radiant is BEFORE shadow items... I know because two of my shadow 8tems were upgraded from radiant...
Trove,3e2sgf,literalcream,0,Wed Jul 22 13:41:29 2015 UTC,"I agree on the second point. The monetization levels are a little too high on the cosmetic stuff... I bought the starter pack after playing for a few hours, but am not sure if I will be buying anything else. However, all the important content is accessible without having to pay a penny (as you can earn cubits at a decent rate to pick up the classes), and I've seen far worse in plenty of MMOs... so I may do, more to support the devs than to actually get the stuff (who so far seem to be the best I've come across at dealing with their community).  And I think that point, more than any, makes me feel that a lot of the potential in the game will be realized. There is a lot which is missing in the game for now as far as content goes, but the core gameplay is enjoyable. Whether I feel the same way in a few weeks time remains to be seen."
Trove,3e2sgf,IAlsoShotTheDeputy,0,Tue Jul 21 16:55:00 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. Even as an mid-level Uber player, I feel that the next patch needs to be one for dungeons. The class ability system is a bit flawed too, but it would take a major overhaul for them to fix it. I would love to see 2 more active abilities added (ones that you have to activate) for each class. I wouldn't mind grinding at all if the dungeons or combat was more interesting. (On another note, this game seems to make mining way more fun than Minecraft did.) This game does a lot of things right, like focusing resource gathering on combat, but for people going into the highest levels of play, they need to add more depth to said combat."
Trove,3e2sgf,Beanzii,0,Tue Jul 21 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of missed potential for grouping. The game already has 1 dungeon type that takes 3 people. You gather 3 people for it to open.. and just get a chest. This place should instead be reworked to be an extremely difficult dungeon, meant to be impossible for a single person of the appropriate level of gear.  Also the game does have a very grind for the sake of grinding aspect to it. This too is a rather big problem since there's a roof that's not too difficult to reach. The game is already fairly algorithmic, and it could be reworked to keep scaling for a long time to come, since the game is already just redoing content at higher numbers. I say make it genuinely infinite, and make uber floors and the gear they drop scale.  To keep gear from completely overpowering lower ubers could make uber7 and higher drop a new kind of stat on gear. Growing stats, which are based on the floor your on and it's own multiplier. So a u10 item would be not let you 1 shot bosses in floor 1, but it would let you stand your ground in u10 and u11.  Or maybe this is a terrible idea, I dunno, I'm basically rambling at this point, but I'll take any chance I can to say down with level caps in any game!.."

Trove,3e3jbl,5N0ZZ83RR135,5,Tue Jul 21 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to chime in here with my thoughts on this topic. I'm on the fence about auction houses. If they implement one in game they need to increase the amount of items in game. With the current number of items in game it would be far too easy for rich trovians to control the market. Additionally, the prices on items will decrease as people realize just how much competition exists when a unified trade system is introduced. I actually think it is better we don't have one after all. I find it easy to sell and trade as is. Like flux is easy to come by if you play the economic side of this game. It may take up most of your time in game but would be far more profitable than if an AH were introduced."
Trove,3e3jbl,xkillo32,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:43 2015 UTC,but i dont wanna spend a bunch of time trying to sell items when i can just be getting more items
Trove,3e3jbl,Ukani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah in a game where the main goal seems to be collecting all the trophies and shit I feel like an auction house may ruin that. If they ever do have an auction house I think they need to restrict a lot of items. I dont think you should be able to sell things like the trophy heads or a large portion of the plushies in the game. Things like weapons, blocks, and basic furniture like benched, windows, etc would be fine though.  It would just kind of suck if people could just buy their way through the game."
Trove,3e3jbl,Kenakaii,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:35:55 2015 UTC,Then maybe you could be able to use the AH when you were a certain mastery level.
Trove,3e3jbl,Elitee3540,5,Wed Jul 22 01:46:48 2015 UTC,What about if we could stand in a location and open a shop. I remember some games that used to do this but maybe if we have a location we can stand and people can open an interface with items we are selling that way its a bit of both worlds
Trove,3e3jbl,KDBA,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I suggested that, it would work great too."
Trove,3e3jbl,Elitee3540,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah man I thought about this too and wanted to suggest it, I don't know if anyone has played Flyff here but the trading system in that game was EPIC, you just had to go to a 'trade' world and you could open up your own shop with your own name and own prices at your will without any taxes.   I believe this would/will cut 60-80% of the traders spamming in chat."
Trove,3e3jbl,hellschatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:17 2015 UTC,I stopped playing Flyff when they reworked the skill system and made it shit.
Trove,3e3jbl,BronzeGamer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing it too because of that, I sincerely meant the old trading system which was in a apart world (we could call it trading hub in Trove) and it was only on a grass field so no biggy.  IMO this would be a really cool solution to implement and avoid further trading issues."
Trove,3e3jbl,HaikaDRaigne,4,Wed Jul 22 08:36:00 2015 UTC,I just hope the AH doesn't use glim or flux as a currency but instead you can for example trade 10 robotic salvage for 10 wild cupcakes.
Trove,3e3jbl,Zatutic,8,Tue Jul 21 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"TBH i feel like Auction houses ruin the interaction that takes place while trading and haggling dissapears as a whole. I mean sure it makes it easy to get stuff. But it doesnt give you the accomplished feeling you get after haggling a price down so its more profitable for you.   Experienced it before. Remember old runescape before the G.E.? It allowed for much more interaction and maybe even making friends.  With trove already having a low amount of player interaction [feels to me like that] adding an AH will lower it even more.  Also like this, items are susceptible to trade clubs their influence, fluctuating the prices to gain profits. Instead of an open market where this would be way harder to do, infact almost impossible since there are a lot of different trade chats.  I am opposed to an AH because.. It makes trading feel less accomplishing and less fun. Adding to that, is the way prices can be influenced heavily."
Trove,3e3jbl,HaikaDRaigne,11,Tue Jul 21 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Too be honest, haggling/trading/etc is a hassle I hate being forced to do it in a spammy tradechannel where messages fly out of screen every 1 second.  AH is good for people who like to trade at their leasure even if it means spending more coin"
Trove,3e3jbl,spar13,3,Tue Jul 21 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"the real issue here is the chat functionality in general is kinda bad and basic.  we need tabs,   we need ways to change the size of chat box and font size (play trove at 4k res and you will know what i mean)  I like the interaction of trades vs the auction house that said. if they do implement an AH as it appears they will. they better damn well not make a craftible item to access it. leave it in the hub worlds.  every game that has an ah that lets players put it in some space they own nearly instantly feels empty."
Trove,3e3jbl,lilmissclicks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:41 2015 UTC,"true, an auctionhouse needs to be in a big place only in games, to give players reason to visit it. in mmorpg's it's usually capital cities/hub worlds. otherwise the game would feel desolate.  TBH, the entire hubworld could use a rework, to make it appear as a buzzling city, the architect in me is screaming for it."
Trove,3e3jbl,OmegaGenesis,2,Wed Jul 22 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with you on the aspect that the AH ruins the interaction between players and haggling. I offer you this thought though which you've touched on by saying there are different trade chats. Currently, the chat system only supports up to 50 people per chat instance excluding clubs and world chat.  When you get into Global, Trade, or any other chat channel, you're only speaking with up to 50 people maximum per channel. Buying/Selling right now consist of you spamming 49 other people with an attempt to obtain something. We've been averaging 40k people over the last two weeks and being limited to 49 others is very depressing to consider as I've had trouble with selling things recently when I'm offering to sell for less than everyone else in my chat.  Worlds are only instances and cap out very quickly. You can't have more than 50~ people in a world right now(clubs can hold more). So trying to do a stall system wouldn't work as people wouldn't be able to get in. You also don't want afk people staying in game as we already have a queue going right now. You wouldn't want to make it worse by encouraging people to go AFK.  With how the current system works, we can't support anything besides an AH. I would love to see it be literally only an Auction House and don't offer a buy now option but that isn't ideal as people hate bidding on stuff and not being able to have the enjoyment of having it now as soon as they buy it.  The hardest part of an auction house is the fact that we don't have a standard currency. Flux is considered the main currency by most people as it's used most often and abundant enough to not be too rare. Assuming we have an auction house, is there going to be a tax? How are you to tax me if I'm wanting to trade a mount 1:1 for another mount?  Finally, we've had a few 'Auction House' sites pop up in the past but they failed because not enough attention was brought to them. I personally thing Dungeon Defenders 1 did a great job at fixing this same issue as they allowed you to sync your account with a community run website that would only show items you had on you. This once again removes the human interaction but removes the strain that might be brought on the servers."

Trove,3e3jbl,HerrSchnee,2,Tue Jul 21 22:11:50 2015 UTC,Completely agree with everything you said. Started playing Runescape again not to long ago after many years and quit shortly after when I realized there was now the GE for trading. Buying and selling is no fun if you have an automated system doing all the leg work for you.

Trove,3e3jbl,BronzeGamer,3,Tue Jul 21 19:14:52 2015 UTC,I love the idea of being able to create your own trade station or something along those lines.

In the end it comes down to if you like the playstyle or not. Next time you have your eyes on a class try describing to someone what kind of class you are looking for and they could give you a good pointer.  Good luck in the future~"

You don't really need a clan to do anything all you need is the knowledge of how to join chats(I recommend ""/join sa"" once you get to the point of shadow arenas).   The game is certainly friendly to children, but in fairness quite a few adults seem like children on the internet. If you look around and hang in some chats and worlds I'm sure you will find plenty of people to play with, children and adult alike :)  Hope you enjoy the game!  Quick Edit: Also beware of the eternal queue and that there will be some lag. The servers are getting heavy load with all the new players."

Trove is generally a casual, laid-back, collect-them-all sort of game - you don't have to dedicate a lot of time or research a lot in order to be good at it (seriously, some classes just need to spam there skills and everything dies)  The community itself, contains a mix between all age groups - clearly this is a problem when the game contains a global chat (where everyone can see what you type) - I would suggest finding a club (the word for guild in this game) that has more mature members if you don't want to deal with children or raging teenagers who wish you to get cancer."

Trove,3e6xdi,Iron_Fury,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"Game is, Join> enjoy your 16x16 block base> learn how to dungeon crawl>level up and each few levels go to Hub and to the next portal, then make your own (beginner up to Uber-3)>You are leveling up at a good rate and get to Max character level 20, now you work on gear and mastery via crafting/looting-collecting>  This last stage is the longest/end-game.   You join clubs, gain access to sky portals (in clubs), join Shadow arenas, grind your shadow gear up via the crafting system, enjoy that base you started on, and at mastery 30 you can do challenges as well (speed-dungeon crawling) for additional rewards to start unlocking a 'dragon-flying' mount.

However, worlds that are harder like Uber 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 also exist, but you have to craft them. And same goes for sky dimension portal.  If you find them hard to craft, you can always go to the 'leaderboards' (heart-shaped portals) and join their world, in which they usually have all the portals that exist in this game :)"

You will have to pay a bit more than you would if you would just increase your stars though.  Starting from shadow level 2, you increase your shadow level (after obtaining max stars) with shadow souls. These are obtained by salvaging a shadow item with the level 2, 3, 4 or 5. For example: salvage a shadow level 2 item, gain: 1 twice forged shadow soul. You will need 2 of those to upgrade your shadow 2 item to 3. Same goes for shadow 3 > 4. Hope this helps :)"

He is like the Fae trickster except he doesn't need as much energy regen, so you want magic power, attack speed, and health (since you will be a complete sitting target in the air to ranged enemies). Not sure what emblems are best bu I love the one that gives you invulnerability for a short time and the increased HP regen for a short time, its nice survivability for glass cannons. From what I can see, Gunslinger is just OK in endgame. They are very fun but they get overshadowed by other classes late game, but if this class is the most fun to you then you should just go for it. An alternative class would be the boomeranger if you want to melt mobs late game at the cost of being squishier than a candy barbarian."

Trove,3e3j56,jeradj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, knight currently probably sucks even more than the ninja.  The ult should last longer, and the stun should last longer too.  If the stun was 2 seconds longer, it would be really legitimate. 1 second longer and it might become playable.  As it sits, it's pretty much just a sort of shitty crowd dps mechanism that requires you to get energy regen on knight.  The knight's dash is also pretty much a useless shitty skill as well."

Trove,3e3j56,MiigPT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:05 2015 UTC,"Every single classes has to build HP/HP regen anyway, so you don't really get tankier relatively to the other classes.  I think Neon Ninja is in a good spot right now ; it's most definitely not OP not is it very strong, but it's OK. In soloy play you can dish out a lot of damages by making good use of you passive and your clone, and in SA your root is extremely valuable.  His set kinda feels kinda weird cause you can't use all of it in every situation, and by that I mean you very rarely use your ulti when farming dungeons (you'll mainly pop it if you're in danger) and in SA the root is so important you should keep as much energy as possible to be able to chain them, therefore you're not AAing a lot nor are you going stealth on packs. About the ulti, I kind of agree : I really like the idea but it doesn't see much play, basically you root the boss, pop your ulti and just aim at the boss with your left click on. If I had to suggest something to replace it, here off the top of my head, I'd say that a boost to physical damage as well as energy regen (and maybe health but it would probably make it too strong) would be a good idea.  But it's unlikely the developers decide to entirely rework a skill, therefore I must say I'd likefor  the ultimate to pierce through enemies, so that you can root multiple enemies and lock them all into place (cause right now the adds summoned by a dungeon boss block the way and really fucks up your root/ult combo) ; I think it would be a very good buff to the ultimate !  All in all I think the Neon Ninja is a pretty good class, as its skill set allows him to be good at farming dungeons, without being the best (it DOES take some/a lot of practice though, you clearly have to think about what you're doing and plan ahead otherwise you're going to empty that flask very quickly), AND valuable in a SA group. IMO this class is pretty consistent and offers an interesting gameplay, though it could use a buff to its ultimate."
Trove,3e3j56,Elektrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"As a Neon Ninja, should you aim to get HP and HP regen on all your gear or replace some of these with Attack Speed and Energy Regen?"

Trove,3e3j56,CptFlacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"You can check guides on the Internet, the setup that seems the most efficient is to have health and health regen to up your survivability, but only to an extent in order for you to get attack speed and energy regen, as you're not a tank but a damade dealer/crow controller.  you can check this spreadsheet and more generally guides on this forum post for more info and sources."
Trove,3e3j56,Teyazak,0,Tue Jul 21 19:52:24 2015 UTC,You said his Ult should give him extra damage/ energy regen but why not just build that from the start? From my experience with this class (which is not much!) the neon ninja needs nothing but Damage/ atk speed/ energy regen. The point is to kill enemies before they even see you coming... be a ninja.
Trove,3e3j56,JimmyMcGiggity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"You're pretty limited in your options to boost your damages, and health/health regen takes a lot of room in your stats.

Trove,3e3j56,HaikaDRaigne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"I actually think Neon Ninja is at a pretty good spot. I'm stuck on EU server rather than NA despite trying to connect to the damn NA server so 150+ ping on such a skill based class is kinda brutal, but I can still solo up to u5 on my lvl 32 ninja. And with no extra health. I've only built HP regen, stacking dmg/AS/ER. Sure you can't take a hit, but you shouldn't be getting hit. Approaching in stealth, stasis blade and stealth back out, reverse flips to get behind targets and redirect their attacks.   One of my favorite/easiest combos is to approach in stealth, stasis through the enemy then flip back through him for three hits/shuriken while their back is turned. You can keep combo going even with higher dps by constantly backflipping through enemies. The holo clone will take aggro and you get three more hits then reverse backflip into another shuriken then rinse/repeat. High atk speed/energy regen is essential for this. At minimum you need to be able to stay in stealth indefinitely to let energy/health regen go to work.  In SA your job is to lock groups of enemies/bosses so that your ranged classes can do dmg easily. Any auto/shuriken dmg you do here is skill dependent but at the very least you can just stasis through, dodge away, then stasis back. Again, high ER is essential.  Also watch out when you jump. Jumping stops energy regen so I do it as little as possible. Spikes won't kill you with high enough ER, though flames are annoying."

If you were to hit a passive test dummy, sure, the Ninja would probably do much more DPS than CB or Boomeranger. But in reality? Neon Ninja can't survive long enough to be able to do that constant DPS. Neon Ninja isn't able to the damage it needs to do to set it apart from the other classes."

I did some math with 1k damage, ult, raptor, emblem, full charged ult   1k X 800% ult = 8k x2 damage from the emblem =16k x 20% = 19,200 damage.   I believe my last calculation came out higher so I may have missed a multiplier or a number or something not sure. If you miss the ult though it takes so long to kill anything  Also you can get enough damage to do the 19k with calculations from ONLY a ring, actually more but im just using s3"

Trove,3e40e0,Elektrus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:17:13 2015 UTC,"Lol well my shit was all wrong my numbers are from the wiki maybe they have been updated/changed since I last saw.   Also there's still some constant dps you are not account over 10 seconds for the shadow hunter. So the one hit does almost what the full 10 seconds duration does.   The candy barb I wish was better gives me more reason to change ha, but you just have to have tank stats or you're in trouble. The NN is definitely close, but after the ult I mean he is still melee I am just saying for a range class mostly. I suck at math so I am not sure how atk speed scales in this game or how it would factor in over 10 seconds with the SH but you have to count that aswell since technically you could ult as SH before fight even starts, or worst case scenario like 2 seconds after."

It's his 1 ability. Have you played a Tomb Raiser?"
Trove,3e5pxv,cellfoneguy,2,Wed Jul 22 07:18:42 2015 UTC,Which characters have AOE?  I was certain Dracolyte would and instead he's perpetually aimed at the ground.  TR's primary attack is a little OP but the range is super short. Not a fan of either.
Trove,3e5pxv,Relax_Panda,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:25:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly the TR's primary isn't the main source of damage, the minions are. It really only shines if you have ghost active and multiple (4+) enemies surrounding you.  As for other classes, Ice Sage has decent AOE with ice crash, Ninja has alright skills for it. Pirate Cap's basic attack and ult both have decent aoe, and boomeranger bomb has good aoe as well. Dunno about other classes."
Trove,3e5pxv,cellfoneguy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:33:17 2015 UTC,"The Candy Barbarian is considered one of the best classes because it's ultimate can heal others (and yourself without using a flask!!) and he has a ability that is PURE AoE (Vanilla windswhirl) and meanwhile it drops u candy that makes u faster.

Trove,3e2zh3,Mattxy8,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"It's actually not as complicated as you may expect.  Use a voxel editor for the design and save it as a .qb You can then go to your Trove directory and into the ""Live"" folder, now drag your .qb onto the devtool_convert_to_blueprint bat file  Now once you're in game, if you made a weapon for example, you can use /weaponpreview <file name> to see your creation in game.  The file name does not include the .blueprint at the end"
Trove,3e2zh3,Sheepski,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for the information!  Are you able to use the items you've created, as skins at least, or mods?"

Trove,3e2zh3,Dingus_Milo,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"If your items get accepted, you get some amount of in game currency and your name is put on the item tooltip in game. Other than that, it's just for fun!  For me, maybe an hour or two to completely finish an item. I did 3 items during the stream over 4 hours, and I feel fairly good about all 3 of them. I'll probably keep tweaking them, especially once I can get back in game to try them out before I call them finished."

Trove,3e264a,Daiwon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:42 2015 UTC,+1 It's a great idea and easy to implement. The cornerstone should be able to deconstruct after holding E for a while near a sign.

Trove,3e264a,Mattxy8,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:15 2015 UTC,Terraformers do need a re-working but what's important right now is being able to actually use land and resources in clubs effectively and bring the trove community around to appreciating and being more involved with clubs.
Trove,3e264a,HUDuser,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"As a club leader with zero building talent and 200 members I have to agree with basically everything.   I really want people to be able to come and build for the club, but I have to be selective because our Sky Realm and U5/U6 portals are really expensive and I can't just give the perms out to everyone.   Even the simplest change like lower ranked players cannot alter something a higher ranked player built or changed would be a welcome addition."
Trove,3e264a,Elektrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"I like zones to be honest, we just need more club ranks and privileges.  There isn't an easy way to protect just some region of a zone unless you want to deal with cuboids like in WorldGuard Minecraft where you select a region based on X and Z coordinates and then set privileges for the area but I personally hated that solution.  The game would need to know if we did create any custom ranks because /club promote command requires us to specify one.  They could just get rid of the command and make some kind of ""New Rank"" interface where we would be able to name them and choose all sorts of privileges like building/destroying/using bombs/harvesting/placing water and lava.  Hell, maybe everyone could even have their own biome."
Trove,3e264a,frog450,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"Well I personally very much enjoy the cuboid based region protection solution. Mostly because it isn't restrictive in terms of vertical regions or sizes. It's not that hard to implement either (compared to other possible solutions, even if it's crude text commands) and allows LOTS of control."

Trove,3e582n,XAMpew,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:09 2015 UTC,If you're having that high ping it's probably a routing issue between you and the server. You should do a trace route on 208.94.26.5 (North America) to see where your latency spikes.

Currently I just change the priority of my clubs so I can keep the green (C1) text, so I can see it.  I avoid using an active club in the C2 slot due to the color issue.  ~Agreed, please Trove, make the colors custom or atleast restrict clubs from auto-ing to the global and world colors!, maybe break out tabs for each chat-room?  Maybe flash or change header color for chat-tabs with content updates?"

Trove,3e4ynb,nuggnugg,2,Wed Jul 22 00:37:43 2015 UTC,Because most companies that host multiple F2P games share a paid currency across all games? It doesn't make sense to punish paying customers because they decide to play another game.   I see no reason for them not to share the paid currency.
Trove,3e4ynb,nuggnugg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:32:13 2015 UTC,I have never heard of games sharing paid currency like that. I see no reason for them to do it in this game though. They are two different games and they are in no way related other than that they are published by Trion.
Trove,3e4ynb,nuggnugg,2,Wed Jul 22 01:54:36 2015 UTC,"Nexon, for example hosts tons of F2P games (Maplestory, Vindictus, Dirty Bomb, Dragon Nest, Combat Arms). They use a paid currency (NX) across all games published by them. It seems the most logical and rewarding for both parties to be able to use the balance across all games.

Trove,3e419b,DixonButtz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:48 2015 UTC,HP is good for Icesage too. The higher health you have the harder it is for an enemy to do 10% of your health and break your ice shield. I found a helm with a huge +Health +Health% boost and it made playing much easier. You no longer have to worry about reapplying the shield and can focus on kiting.

You could even add some more skills in addition to cooking (I know they already have gardening, ringcrafting, and runecrafting), to give the player some extra things to do.   Also, if the devs didnt like the idea of class trees they could at least add some specific abilities for different weapons, like one gun for the gunslinger could ricochet bullets, while the next has the ability to stun enemies, so that you could make your class customization really specific without changing the system in place. This way you could even incorporate healing abilities without creating a whole class centered around it (even though I would rather them just add a healer class, because healing items could be really OP).

Although you may not have the health/damage to go toe-to-toe with the strong monsters, keeping them rooted with 1 + Ult, makes it much easier for your team to take out monsters that might otherwise chase them down and kill them."
Trove,3e2h6q,Samsterz,3,Tue Jul 21 13:37:28 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly fun, though. Neon ninja seems like a class that avoids and dodges damage, yet he can't really while doing damage.  A suggestion would be to have his Shift and his M2 ability to reduce damage taken by a % during animation or something else that allows him to be more active. It's not exactly fun to get in, lose 90% of your hp, disengage and be useless.   Just because the root is a niche the neon ninja has, doesn't mean that something shouldn't be changed. Right now my lvl 15 Candy Barbarian can tank and do more damage than my lvl 20 Neon Ninja can..."
Trove,3e2h6q,MozzyZ,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:18 2015 UTC,Honestly there have been so many suggestion on how to adjust him and balance him dating back from months ago. Chances are they aren't going to change the Neon Ninja any time soon or without a much larger group of people saying something about it.
Trove,3e2h6q,ShadowSociety55,2,Wed Jul 22 13:09:30 2015 UTC,"That's kinda annoying. NN is by far my favorite class in terms of mechanics but what's ruining the fun for me is how he feels so squishy and extremely unforgiving compared to other classes and more importantly, it feels like he does less damage as well. I'd be OK if the NN actually did noticeably higher damage as compensation to that you have to dodge damage.   It's a shame. I guess I'll have to just play Candy Barbarian or Dracolyte and have it extremely easy :P"

The main content of the game is dungeons and lairs. Inside them, you defeat bosses or waves of enemies, and in return get loot from chests. You have your own private area called ""plot"" that you can summon on certain areas on the map. There you can heal up, trash items in return for valuable resources. The tutorial explains quite a bit. There are 2 primary resources you use for paying: Glim and Flux. You get glim by walking over grass and plants, and you earn flux by trashing items in the loot collector. Glim is mainly used to pay for pets (called allies ingame), and mounts. Flux is the main currency for trading and is used for upgrading your gear"

Trove,3e392k,MozzyZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"Gear lvl goes up to 10, after which the quality of the item is more important (shadow radiant being highest) - try to avoid upgrading lvl 8 gear and try to store as much lvl 10 gear as you can in case you want to try other classes. This could save you lots of time. Sometimes the gear you looted will have a blue-ish ball next to certain stats. Which means that certain stat has been boosted by a Pearl of Wisdom. Basically, don't de-construct (put items in your Loot Collector) lvl 10 gear that has such upgraded stats since boosting stats with Pearl of Wisdom manually costs a lot of Flux. Make your own Club - At some point the tracker in the top right corner will tell you to join a Club or create one yourself. Having one of your own is highly recommended due to storage space. At the start you'll have a standard chest which doesn't hold too many items, unless you want to pay real money. Having a club of your own allows you to create Club Chest and a Club Officer Chest which will, as long as you don't invite other players to your Club, act as more storage space.    Afaik you can be part of 5 Clubs in total, including your own. So you don't miss out on much by having your own Club World.  Not much of this will make sense just yet, but knowing these things early on will help prevent confusion :)"

If you are just meeting the needs to not die, then you will probly actually have a bit more strict roles.  A lot of Ice sages will switch out their emblems based on if their group needs a support or not.

I would assume biomes would affect the weapons more than Uber, so I would suggest Fae or Highlands for the Lumin Lotus Staff, because lotus plants and faes.

Trove,3e3wmd,Molster_Diablofans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"There's this one link that you should check out that gives insight to weapon stats and what not.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Trove/comments/247ko1/aviexs_chaos_forging_guide/  ^ that might look like sausage, but to explain, for staves, the first line of stats will always be magic damage. The second line will be one of 3 or four things (like attack speed, jump, health regen, etc.) The third will be health or somethin, and the fourth (which you add on with pearls), will be one of the stats from the 2nd line category, but it won't clone the same state. So say you get a staff. It gives 100 Magic attack, 5 Jump, and 500 Health, if you add a pearl, then you can get 100 Magic attack, 5 Jump, 500 Health, and 7 Attack speed.  EDIT: And you can use something called a Chaos Forge which will change the 3rd and the 4th line of stats to one the things they can actually be. So you can change the 100 Magic Attack, 5 Jump, and 500 Health, to 100 Magic Attack, 5 Jump, and 135 Stability."

Trove,3e3o9n,Hanbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:06 2015 UTC,stability: less knockback when hitted by enemies.  lasermancy: you destroy blocks faster  magic damage: classes that use gun and staff scale with magic damage.  magic find: higher chance of getting rare items inside loots.

Trove,3e3mj5,gosubryan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:17 2015 UTC,I have 35lvl with these classes and imo barb has very low damage.  Ninja is very useful because of root and the damage is good too but Boomeranger has even better damage and he's safer to play cause ranged. Rooted monsters will still hit you and Ninja is just to shquishy for shadow arenas even with prowling shadow and berserker flask.
Trove,3e3mj5,Elektrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"If you stand at an exact distance with the NN after you've snared the enemies with your 1, you can smack them without them being able to smack you. Also, when you have your 2 activated. It makes your attacks ranged. I have mostly health on my NN and I do an immense amount of damage. NN has to be one of the hardest classes to play, but the most rewarding. NN for life!"
Trove,3e3mj5,WilldCard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"I started out with NN, unlocked Boomeranger as my first class and Candy Barbarian as second. I'm not sure how stuff is going to be late game since I only recently got my NN to lvl 20 and my Candy Barbarian is only lvl 15, but even at those levels my Candy Barbarian has a ton more survivability and does more damage in comparison to my NN. Candy Barbarian however is quite boring and not exactly rewarding in terms of gameplay. In that aspect the NN excels. Even though I have to put more effort into killings mobs as a NN, it does feel more rewarding and the combat is more engaging.  As for Boomeranger. I lvled it up to lvl 10 and didn't bother afterwards. I heard he's decently strong, but in terms of gameplay it feels really boring. The bomb is lackluster, the ultimate is fun when it procs chickens but besides that is too RNG for my tastes and the boomerang mechanic is meh.   NN: more engaging combat, really squishy however as you can't face tank anything once you leave U1, at least not in comparison to Candy Barbarian. Excels at locking down enemies, but can't do much besides that. Candy Barbarian: Survivable, does decently high damage but lacks depth to gameplay. Excels at doing damage while healing himself. Boomeranger: Can't comment too much on it, but didn't like it personally due to weird mechanics and slow combat."
Trove,3e3mj5,MozzyZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:23 2015 UTC,I love my neon ninja but he is simply impossible to play solo anywhere over Uber 2 and that's not fun whatsoever. So I made a Pirate captain and I am loving it so much. I hope they fix the NN cause he is my favorite but he's just too weak and dies in 1 hit to anything.
Trove,3e3mj5,Allan828100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"Candy barb just owns late game, cause the non-stop healing.  Im loving the Neon Ninja, cause the burst damage, and its fun to play too, it makes you stay on edge. Boomeranger? I didnt found a good bow for it, so i went 100% melee. I dont like the random ultimate skill about him, i keep wishing for the chicks to spawn in middle of a bossfight, and then you get a health bomb.  I didnt tried the Candy barb tough, cant speak about that. But i keep reading on the reddit, and the forums, that the candy barb is a monster class for later Uber levels... The other classes are much more gear dependent."
Trove,3e3mj5,Princze,0,Tue Jul 21 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"im a lvl12 NeonN and its hella fun to play with, but you can't solo, you need to play w some other people, because NN is more of a support, you can freeze enemy movement for a couple of seconds, which lets your friends get some good damage on them"

My main strategy with Pirate Captain is laying your parrot and possibly your cannon, then throw a decoy on top of them to distract the enemy. Then start shooting and placing more decoys in the same spot while walking around and behind the enemy so you don't get hit.  Your parrot and cannon will most likely be doing far more damage than you will, so it's a very different fighting style than the super fast Neon Ninja."

Trove,3e3hpp,PixelRogues,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"Throw your parrot down (right mouse button) in a spot that won't be blocked by the environment (it will eventually shoot through blocks, but you might as well be proactive) Throw down your manowar (2) (only if necessary, typically for bosses or huge packs of mobs) Throw down a/a few decoys (1) as your energy allows (they will die quickly, but allow you to keep some distance between you and the mobs) Hold your basic attack (left mouse button) and collect doubloons to upgrade your parrot and deal more damage.   Overall it's a very rewarding playstyle from what I've experienced. A lot of the playstyle revolves around proper placement of decoys and your parrot to deal optimal damage, while kiting if need be."
Trove,3e3hpp,RagingBearFish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:59 2015 UTC,Yeah occasionally you can throw your decoy on a ledge and the mobs will sit at the bottom standing still unable to attack it. Only works sometimes though.

That being said: Part of me thinks that the shield-arm wouldn't have enough space in my colossus design, the swords thickness could be reduced and moved, but the design would be off-center then.   Tip: the way I designed this colossus was by placing squares of blocks and chiselling them away till it felt natural.

Either way, if you're referring to playing as the character you use when online, that would be an instant no, considering it would make it significantly easier to cheat which is a massive no in games like these. If you're referring to a seperate save file in a local version of the game, not only would it be more intensive since YOU would be the one generating everything, which wouldn't cater to certain audiences, meaning it wouldn't be beneficial for about 20% of the community.

Trove,3e369l,m2pt5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"There are two types of music blocks; instrument blocks (which has a picture of a mob on it) and note blocks (which have letters on it).  You use the instrument blocks to change the instrument of any note block it is on top of, up until a new instrument block is placed below those note blocks (then the new instrument block changes the instrument of any note block below it; so on and so forth)  You can change the octave of your note by repeatedly pressing the number it's on in your inventory. You can tell what octave a note block is in by looking at the light blue bar that runs horizontally in the letter. If the bar is at the bottom, it is at its' lowest octave. In the middle, it is in the middle octave, and in the top, at its' highest octave. Most note blocks have 3 octaves. doing this also raises the note in steps; every press of the button its on turns the note into the flat version of that note, then it goes up an octave and repeats.  If you have a mag rail running on top of your stack of notes, you can use a speed changer to set the tempo for your song. I would suggest looking at someone's music track to find out what I mean by all this; Trovian Maestros club world has some great examples (in the northeastern island region).  That being said, I suggest building a line really high up, and do your track from the top down."
Trove,3e369l,CandyFTW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about how the instrument block worked with the note blocks, but I assumed the individual note blocks worked in a similar way (that is, changing each time you select them on your hotbar) because I have been around Trovian Maestros' club world and noticed some that had lowercase letters, and I understand how the mag rail part works.  What I was asking is if there's an easy way to render a MIDI file into something that would be relatively easy to replicate in-game."

Also his basic atacks hit in a wide cone that hits multiple targets.  Focus on getting atk speed on him so u can have ur decoys up permanently and deal massive aoe dmg.
Trove,3e1ziv,Yenko_L,3,Tue Jul 21 11:03:47 2015 UTC,I recently made the swap from candy barb to pirate captain and I couldn't agree more.

Trove,3e1ziv,fiyawerx,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"With the 2.2% heal pet, 20% flask, vampiric and double damage emblem is more than enough, since you basically have insane health regen anyway and your attack hits ALL mobs around you. While it is true that I can also survive anything on the other classes, boomer is the one I do most damage with. his damage is INSANE with a melee weapon and correct stats.   But just like with any other class you need to start investing and upgrading your shadow gear starting at around U3. Thats where I had my transition from piss easy, to hard as shit. Then I upgraded and pearled everything to shadow level 2 and was able to cruise control through U4 and U5."

The difference between a shadow-3 single pearl item and a three double-pearled radiant item is like... insane. Even one of the ""best"" classes for solo play - the candy barbarian - is squishy as fuck with shadow items compared to radiant items. It's the difference between 8-10k hp and 50k+.  I think some classes (like neon ninja) are just going to be shitty before radiant gear is more available."

Trove,3e1ziv,GrDenny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:00 2015 UTC,"I would vote Pirate Captain for pure sustainability. If you manage to get into a groove with your Decoys, you can have multiple out indefinitely, making it impossible to get hit except by Poisonous Mushrooms or other AoE damage mobs. This playstyle really only requires maxing out Magic Damage and possibly Health just in case you can't keep decoys up, making it cheap. Your turrets deal most of the damage, but your AA's short range forces you to stay close to the action, which is a bit detrimental. All in all, you should be able to easily solo Shadow Arenas, and most Dungeons for that matter, and be able to keep aggro off of your squishier teammates in group fights."

Trove,3e0zvn,illbebaack,3,Tue Jul 21 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"yes, but the problem is if you dont have good gear like yours the dps is extremely low"
Trove,3e0zvn,killstoper,3,Tue Jul 21 13:58:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm all shadow level 3 and am running double magic, and i'm sure your damage must be damn high, but for the majority of the game it certainly feels much, much lower than all the other classes (cept maybe neon ninja). Like if you go into a u4 with appropriate gear and level as gunslinger it takes AGGGESSSS to solo even small lairs. Perhaps damage picks up a lot with the berserk emblem and chromomancer + shadow 4, but I doubt it'll pick up much. A few simple changes could really make the difference and make gunslinger really viable for majority of the game: In cease base attack speed, lower cooldown (45-30 seconds) on the Run N Gun, increase base damage a bit (as it stands just needs a tiny bit), make the speed boost on run n gun 100%-115% instead of 75 and make it so you can SEE THROUGH YOUR CHARACTER or go first person. Seriously, most of the damage goes away for gunslinger simply because most SA's are a hot mess and it's difficult to see through your character most of the time since you're floating up in the sky.   Of course, we can only get HARD numbers and a proper assessment of it all and when (it certainly does) and where gunslinger is UP, once we have ways to track damage outgoing and incoming and meters and whatnot."
Trove,3e0zvn,Razorasadsid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:54 2015 UTC,"i would say the chronomancer helps tremendously. 20% more damage just right there.  Having the right stats on items helps as well.

Trove,3dzdxk,Nobody1441,2,Mon Jul 20 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"Hey here we go again with another one of these posts. I'm just gonna quote my other comment from another one of these ""price guide"" posts.   This is a good idea, but I don't think you should waste your time on this as there's currently not a designated economy in Trove. They're talking about developing a trade system, like a market, when you can sell items for how much you want, and people can buy them, like an Auction House!  But as of now, there's nothing in place to regulate the economy. When the Auction House is released, almost every Rare item is going to have to have it's drop rate changed so that they aren't too cheap, or too expensive. And as of now, you were to carry this out, who's to say you wouldn't create a monopoly and hold everyone's Hearts of Darkness for ransom?   So honestly, I don't think you should continue this, and I don't think anyone should join Trade chat, it's a waste of time and it's poisonous. Wait until the Auction system is released, then there'll be a way to regulate prices, which is through supply and demand, not just some player who decides to put together a chart of prices that he has seen in-game.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be rude or anything, I appreciate the time and effort you put into this, and I appreciate your contributions to this community, but this is just my two cents."

Trove,3dzdxk,BronzeGamer,4,Tue Jul 21 00:54:25 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah there is.. it's someone's choice on what they want to pay for an item or value it at.. price guides are useful for educating people so they do not undervalue themselves.

Trove,3dyai6,Zantatoes,4,Mon Jul 20 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"There is just one size. You make the things he has by using recipes to make pre-determined shapes, there isn't any custom voxel building, you're not missing out THAT much. xD You have to collect the recipes that fit the theme you're looking for as well. On a semi-related note, if you decide to start building and want something crafted you don't have, you can add me in game (IGN same as reddit name) and I will craft it for you if you have the mats (I have every non-holiday/season specific recipe, and a handful of even those) Happy Troving!"

He shines with Elysian Bandolier and Zealous Emblem - this allows him to keep Banshee's Boon(1) as long as he wants, which makes the RTS aspect of managing his skellies a lot easier.  The thing about him is that the expectation was that he'd be a damage-dealing mage, similar to Fae. And he does deal damage. Kind of. But he's more of a semi-light tank. Similar to Dracolyte, you run Prowling Shadow on him and you never die.

If it were sold as a game instead of F2P with an item shop, there is nothing in it that wouldn't work perfectly fine as a game similar to Minecraft and Terraria with self-hosted servers for you and your friends to play on."
Trove,3e4hj2,welwheel,5,Tue Jul 21 22:19:52 2015 UTC,"Well if you want hackers in your game, server side prevents hacking, or making it extremely hard"
Trove,3e4hj2,k1n3t1ca,-4,Tue Jul 21 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"I would be playing with friends, so that really wouldn't be an issue for me. But I suppose it would for people who play on public servers, for whatever reason."
Trove,3e4hj2,CallumKen,3,Tue Jul 21 22:42:08 2015 UTC,Go play Cube World. Problem solved.
Trove,3e4hj2,CallumKen,5,Wed Jul 22 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"Do you even know what MMO stands for? I'll tell you, it stands for massively multiplayer online (gaming). Now then, what game exactly qualifies to be an MMO? One that is online, multiplayer and is not only massive in the multiplayer aspect, but also on it's own. Trove meets all of these."
Trove,3e4hj2,CallumKen,-5,Tue Jul 21 23:40:24 2015 UTC,"Sir, step off your high horse for a moment and realize that is all irrelevant. It's an MMO simply because that is the route they chose to go with. And that would be all well and good, if it actually functioned properly. But it doesn't. So, again, nothing in which you stated would stop it from functioning perfectly well as a standalone game with self-hosting for you and your friends."
Trove,3e4hj2,BillCosbyHitler,2,Tue Jul 21 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'm on equal ground, you're just thinking I'm on my high horse because you're digging yourself into a pit.  If it actually functioned properly? Okay, you go and create an MMO like this, put it on Steam and be flooded with players. I wanna see how fucking well you handle it.  A self hosting game would be stupid. That would kill the free2play aspect of it which they have been building up, how would you obtain premium items? How would you pay for the game? How many people would pay for the game instead of fully going F2P and not spending a penny? 80% of people wouldn't play the local version, it's literally you on your high horse expecting the devs to cater to your every demand because you can't be patient for one day. Do you seriously have such a shitty life that you can't stop playing one game for six hours? A local version isn't worth the developers time, seeing as how they can make this into a fine MMO once all the bugs are gone.  Edit: Do you want to know why Minecraft and Terraria can work as a self-hosted game? Because, their worlds are limited, they don't focus on the multiplayer aspect and they're not free to play. Minecraft and Terraria can easily be played solo, what about Trove? Trove with 3-5 players, sounds good, except the fact that if you want to run a server, you'd have to keep hub world loaded, generate new worlds and have, what, 12 worlds running at a time with active dungeons running? That server hosting side only caters to a tiny audience, considering it would take some power to do all that and play the game. Not only that, but they would have to re-write things or even change certain things to make it work. They would have to remove the free to play aspect completely and somehow incorporate those free to play aspects into a paid game or something similar, can you see a way to do this without dedicating the dev team to the local version instead of the team working on the actual Trove game that 80% of people will play instead? Not worth the time, at all."
Trove,3e4hj2,Hipnipper,-2,Wed Jul 22 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"No, I'm thinking you're on your high horse because you've done nothing but talk down to me for merely imagining a game that actually worked. I didn't even suggest that they make it self-hosted, I was simply saying I now have a greater appreciation for self-hosting games. Obviously this game isn't going to be self-hosted. People would hack the client and they would never make a penny from the item shop. Never gonna happen, I'm not stupid lol.  I've made no demands, actually. But you're right, how dare I expect a game to actually let me log in to play it. And you keep jumping to conclusions, assuming things I've never said. I never mentioned anything at all about when their servers are down, so I don't even know why you are trying to insult me over that lol. When they are UP, no one should be in a queue just to log in. Ever. You guys keep saying ""This is an MMO! This is an MMO!"" What other MMOs put you in a half-hour long queue just to log in? None that I've played have had any sort of queue at all, aside from matchmaking PVP in Guild Wars 2.  I can't be patient one day? Hasn't the game been on Steam for like two weeks now? Within 2 days they should have at least realized they needed way more servers and started adding to their current setup ASAP. Trion has done numerous MMOs, right? They should have a far better handle on this than as if this was their first try.  As I said, I'm not asking the game to be self-hosted. But, hypothetically speaking, if it were self hosted you probably wouldn't need to have nearly as many worlds running as you suggested. With fewer players, it would probably put them all in the same map, then maybe a hub when someone needs to leave their friends to grab something, but I don't see why it couldn't then be unloaded when they returned. But yes, it would take significant efforts to convert it if they were to go that route.  I'd prefer they just added more servers."
Trove,3e4hj2,welwheel,2,Wed Jul 22 01:41:27 2015 UTC,"They've been adding servers for a while now. You're ignorant to the fact they've been trying. They don't make money when the servers are down, meaning they have to keep them up.   What exactly in the game requires it to be an MMO, besides the item shop? If it were sold as a game instead of F2P with an item shop, there is nothing in it that wouldn't work perfectly fine as a game similar to Minecraft and Terraria with self-hosted servers for you and your friends to play on.  there is nothing in it that wouldn't work perfectly fine   Please, if you're going to reply to my response, at least be aware of what you typed. You're saying it would all perfectly fine, yeah? Because that's what I'm getting from it."

Trove,3e203n,Bluestream_2,5,Tue Jul 21 10:02:14 2015 UTC,"Candy Barb is fairly good and you can play Boomeranger as Melee / Ranged which is also strong too, Knight is okay too really most Melee classes are pretty decent if you know how to play em, Imo Neon Ninja isn't that great though"
Trove,3e203n,GlobalNerd,3,Tue Jul 21 10:17:07 2015 UTC,"Candy Barb is the easiest out of the melee follow by perhaps the knight. Candy Barb is like a paladin that heals and does aoe damage while Knight is like a warrior with charge. Both just close their eyes and run into a mob holding their left-mouse button.  Boomeranger is sort of like a tinkering class where you spam your right-mouse-button boomerang to get your Spell2 off cooldown as often as possible and hoping it spawns chickens for you. The AOE from his sword is cool but I don't see the appeal...rather have a candy barb imo.  Neon Ninja is like the utility rogue of this game but the only utility they have is a permanent cc...which is super useful in SA where you're getting knocked back and the collosus is jumping around. They hit hard and really fast which is why they sometimes pick up the monster's aggro and get one or two shotted.   IMO Neon Ninja is the most fun even though soloing with it in high uber is hard. In groups, the ninja makes it super easy by locking the mobs down into a single group and lets your friend's just faceroll the mobs."

Seriously, while I'm waiting, seeing ""server is down"" ""hey can anyone else connect"" ""Recent leaked footage of trove servers"" ""new server problems"" ""problems with server"" is just getting annoying.

Trove,3e4a5k,CallumKen,2,Tue Jul 21 21:15:58 2015 UTC,You have to remember a lot of the people who play this game are a younger age group. They may not have the mental capacity or thought process that you have. There's no need to get frustrated or annoyed about it.

Trove,3e3c2l,_Q3D,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:17:03 2015 UTC,"Because from an economic point this makes no sense. They make money when people are playing and the players count is at it's peak. So it's a minimal cost to set updates and maintance of the servers at night depending on what region. It propably costs more in man hours, hosting company engineers but the profits will outweigh the costs...."
Trove,3e3c2l,_Q3D,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"It's unlawful to force your staff to install 60lb servers 2am - 6am.  Profits do not outweigh the cost of losing staff, or having a lawsuit on your hands."

Trove,3dzgtu,adaenis,4,Mon Jul 20 20:00:42 2015 UTC,I just had #4 happen to me. I usually relog when in game to get in new trade chat. This time I relog and got thrown back in queue instead of instantly in game. I have to say it is quite infuriating. Really do they just expect us to stay in one chat channel to try and sell what we have? If they are nt going to do an auction house there needs to be more multiple trade channels like in PoE that you can join and leave.

Trove,3e16xt,AvengeTC,2,Tue Jul 21 04:10:09 2015 UTC,Candy Barb is arguably the best solo class with self healing everywhere. Neon Ninja can be very challenging towards the later levels so if you want difficulty hes the way to go.

Trove,3e16xt,Patriotdash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:29 2015 UTC,"Ice Sage seems like the way to go for me.  Neon Ninja seems really fun, but since I'm still new, I'll go with a simpler class."

Trove,3e11k5,jjtt311,2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:13 2015 UTC,"I have a suggestion based on an old minecraft game mode on Shotbow network. I don't like how the devs are doing hunger games.  Essentially, 2-4 teams. Each team is a colour, and each team begins in a part of the map. Everyone starts with their equipment but not any building materials. The teams are required to mine for resources in order to upgrade their base, however the mines are in the middle of the map. You can go and attack the enemies base at any time, however it would require either a large force, or a lot of sneakiness. There's a block in the core of the opponents base which, when broken, removes that team from the game.  Strategical gameplay that keeps the main theme of the game, building and MMO pvp. I really dislike the thought of having just another hunger games game mode, especially on Trove. Trove has a lot of potential and let's be honest, hunger games is boring, just run around until you're the last one left."

My nn is lvl 13 (15 from shadow gear) and can clear a u1 dungeon in about 20secs. I need a better wep before I move to u2  For me jump seems to be a wasted stat which could be replaced with others ( my opinion)  I have health regen + max health and +health% which allows you to tank a little more. Also get some energy regen so you can keep using the stealth flip to shoot the shining stars.  when timed right you should never have 3 rings on because you're using them so fast  Apart from that I would say get some attack speed.   I'm still new to the game so I hope it helped a tiny tiny bit

I don't want to put in the time to build another house, along with coming up with another design, having to re craft stuff, especially when I can just use the club worlds to build BIGGER and BETTER things then you can build with the cornerstone which you have limited space with. It's like in minecraft, whats the point in having two houses? There is none, most people build their 1 house and then move on to something else. All it requires is more resources more stuff to craft and in the end, I can build structures 10X as big in the club worlds then I can with my cornerstone. Do you just want to have multiple houses so you can show off your designs to people in the world so you dont have to take them to the club?

Trove,3dxr9y,KDBA,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:52 2015 UTC,"We did a small calculation on how long it would take one to get this.  First of all, it would cost you 150,000 glim, at least to do this. Then we said it takes about 15-20 seconds (At least) for the lure to start bobbing in the water. And I'm not entirely sure on that part, since I haven't taken the time on it myself.  If we say 20 seconds for each, thats 20*15000, which is 300,000 seconds, or 5000 minutes. 5000 minutes is about 83 hours (83.33333.....), which is three days and nine hours.  So you've spent 150.000 glim and 83 hours with the lure in water. Since this is only calculated on the (said, not proven) amount of time it takes to fish if the fish takes 20 seconds to pull the lure and you don't get any boots."

Trove,3e0mj7,CrimsonDragon10,3,Tue Jul 21 01:16:08 2015 UTC,"Well, that depends on how much $20 is worth to you, and if you're already rank 30 Mastery yet.  The power pack basically rewards you as if you've reached Mastery 30 (quite a feat for some players) and at least a month of collecting cubits. You get a mount, wings, and boat, all of which are great for beginners.  You get two Class Tokens, so you could buy the super expensive Tomb Raider and Boomeranger early on... Or you could buy cheaper classes if you wanted to, in case something stuck out to you and you want it now.  You get two Flask Tokens, so you can buy the expensive Flasks right away. This will make exploration way easier for the duration of your game.  The three Pearls of Wisdom means you could get a bonus stat on three items, giving you a great boost. You'll want to find the appropriate shadow gear to use them on first, however.  If you enjoy building things, the 2k of each Primal block will be a tremendous help. However, most blocks will be common by the time you've played for a couple months.  Please note that the cosmetic items you get are unique items. I don't know if they can be obtained in any way except by buying the Pack. I may be wrong, though...  However, if you're already rank 30, many of these are less appealing. You already have transportation and blocks and a way to get pearls of wisdom. If you already have all the classes and flasks, the Tokens will just sit in your chest until a specific update. The main thing you'd want is the special items, but you'd have to be quite the crazed collector to spend $20 just on that."

Trove,3dzarf,Xiomaro,0,Tue Jul 21 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"The aiming is a little difficult, both for basic attack and glitter bomb.  You must lead your targets with basic sometimes, and at a certain angle. Just keto practicing if that's a problem.   Glitter bomb you must arc a little higher than the target zone, unless your in the air looking straight down. Again, practice of this is a problem.   Now if your talking about actually hitting the target but he takes no damage, that's server lag. I experience this somewhat frequently (1 in 100 shots maybe?), and the only recourse is to adapt to it, be prepared for it any time. Get good at 180 clone drops. There's been many times I could have died trying to take out the boss with one last shot before he kills me, in those times pure reaction time saved me.   If there's something else your having trouble with, I can offer some other tips if you'd like. Good luck and just keep practicing!"

Trove,3e0btm,FrostSabre,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"Its been quite a while since I did the mushroom growing thing, but I think it had to be a certain depth underground.  Are the others continuing to grow for certain?  It could be that the ones that are wilting are just doing so more quickly than the rest.  I think I went like 10 voxels below ground.    How far from a light source are you and how are you ensuring that light isn't getting to them because I seemed to have issues with light creeping around corners so I actually made several Z shapes with long hallways to stop that.  Its also possible that you have a light above ground there and its affecting them if you are close to the ground, so perhaps try going deeper or removing the lightsource above there."
Trove,3e0btm,cretoriani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:52 2015 UTC,It does appear to be deeper. its around 6 voxels underground. ill just have to readjust it to be deeper at a later date because replanting all of this will take too long. but it does look really random with no reason whatsoever.  (there isn't any light)  Thanks though.  (Another pic showing how random it looks: http://puu.sh/j6GYG/14b3549668.jpg )

I literally sat in queue for 14+ hours some days. And they didn't have a way to re-place you in the queue if your connection to the server dropped or the game crashed. You could be in queue for 12+ hours, be within an hour of getting in and if your net dropped out for a moment or the game crashed you were screwed. It was like that for a couple weeks, the first week they were afraid of adding new servers cause they didn't want empty servers if people disliked the game and had no server transfer feature."

The good thing is, Trion is doing a pretty good job cleaning up the queues, and is continuing to improve their servers day by day. Honestly, this should be expected, since Trove's gotten quite popular thanks to its Steam release. But still, it's not something you should be experiencing.

On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most people trying to play, launch week(s) are a 10 and after they drop off it goes down to a 5. They plan capacity for the 5 down the line, so as to not overextended their budget and still be able to turn a profit. This is especially true for a free game."

Trove,3dveb5,KappaccinoNation,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"Just got mine. Installed the game, did the tutorial and right when I killed a spider I got a chest that had that inside .^"

Trove,3dveb5,ignaeon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:27:06 2015 UTC,for how much?
Trove,3dveb5,ultimohexer123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"I got him out of my first chest, I don't think it's that rare"
Trove,3dveb5,lololopov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:52 2015 UTC,It is rare. It's just you had good RNG luck for your first box. I've gotten 3 personally but haven't seen it's brother. I also didn't get any for the last 3 box types before this one.
Trove,3dveb5,kiokurashi,2,Sun Jul 19 22:55:39 2015 UTC,I opened probably 50+ without getting anything. Then one time I had two in my inventory and got the two of them.
Trove,3dveb5,Cranzia,2,Sun Jul 19 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't know the feeling, because I've never gotten anything."

But the big player spike that came from Trove's Steam release is over, so there won't be many new players entering the market. I could be wrong, but I'd sell the mount now."

Trove,3dy299,Beanerrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:45 2015 UTC,if you imediately restart trove when stuff like that happens u will be reconecting in no time and will spawn in the arena aswell. I don´t know why but whenever im stuck at 0% or my game crashes i just do a quick restart and ill get in with no queue. Just a smill tip from my side
Trove,3dy299,Yenko_L,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that. But adding a /reconnect command is a lot easier. Also saves the time you take to restart the whole game. I have it on an SSD and my computer is rather fast, but those with a slower computing power will definitely take a lot longer."
Trove,3dyvnf,Killingtime360,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:48 2015 UTC,"Energy regeneration is another top one, but after that it's personal preference. Personally, I like adding some health regeneration and putting jump on one item."
Trove,3dyvnf,Carrotloid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about shadow hunters, but maybe this chart of possible stat combinations can help you a little bit."
Trove,3dyvnf,WSBoonami,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"Energy regen on any equipment is priority so that you can keep on putting down the traps. Then you can focus on health, % health, health regen and/or jump. Jump is kind of optional but it is nice to have. Attack speed is ok but not really necessary. Other than that, other stats are kinda useless for shadow hunters.   I've been hearing people say to avoid knock back because it makes it very hard for other melee characters to fight with you in a group. So avoid knockback especially when you fight in a group.  Hope this helps. :)"
Trove,3dyvnf,OnlyOneHero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"Im a new shadow hunter aswel, level 17, I like having enery regen on my SH because it lets me survive dungeons very easily and I have excellent kite capability.. I would like to have attack speed aswell since the SH attacks very slow imo, unless you get shadow marks all the damage and then you dont have to base on normal attacks and you just spam Radiant Arrow."
Trove,3dyvnf,Roneni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:14 2015 UTC,I play my Shadow Hunter different than most of these people. My best stat is Physical followed by Health then HP Regen then %HP. I don't have any energy regen and do fine in U3. It is pretty much up to your style if you feel like you need the energy though. Shadow hunter is my best class at level 25 and I really like it.

Trove,3dv9fc,Le_Jacob,2,Mon Jul 20 09:36:13 2015 UTC,"It's because you can travel on each axis at max speed, at the same time. Which means you can actually travel the square root of (max speed times two). Which is more than max speed. :)"

Especially when you want to be able to render the better more 3D kind of objects from a decent distance and you run into the candy biome.. drops my framerate by a solid 90%. Hope you get your main PC fixed.  By the way, if you haven't, go into advanced settings under the video option and turn off super sampling.

Generally I'll use 100 or so bombs to get the materials necessary to make 200, it snowballs pretty quickly if you farm caverns in dragonfire peaks."
Trove,3dyn49,PixelRogues,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"Kinda makes me worried that they'll nerf Bomb-mining, since there's no reason to use the laser except for precision block removal. I hope they don't though, I love blowing shit up!"
Trove,3dyn49,RagingBearFish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:03 2015 UTC,I would imagine they would keep it the way it is and allow the laser to be primarily for cornerstones/club world's as far as constructing things goes.

Trove,3dyflh,SwissAssassin,5,Mon Jul 20 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"From the Wiki:   In the beginning, the world was ruled by Elysians, and Trovians lived in peace and harmony. But jealousies arise, even between gods.  Shining radiantly in her kingdom in the sky, the Sun Goddess led the Elysians and Trovians with wisdom and compassion. Over time, the Moon Goddess grew jealous of this harmony and schemed to steal their devotion for herself. Working in the dark, she forged a secret pact with the shadowy Q’bthulhu allowing the forces of evil to enter the Inner Realms.  Evil rarely holds to its bargains, and Q’bthulhu and his minions were no exception. Battle was waged from dawn until dusk, and as the sun set on the day of the invasion, the Sun Goddess knew the realms would not last the night.  Left with a single choice, the Sun Goddess sacrificed herself in a radiant explosion that shattered her domain and repulsed the forces of shadow. With her last breath, she imbued the Trovians with her power, appointing them protectors of the realms to continue the fight.  A collection of majestic sky islands are all that remain of the sundered realm of the Sun Goddess. Each is covered with ancient, trap-filled ruins suspended over the crashing seas below. And each holds important treasure: runic knowledge of the Elysians filled with immense and mysterious power.  Bold adventurers can reach the islands of the Radiant Ruins through a special new portal and take to the air to explore the hidden secrets of their once-hallowed halls!

Trove,3dyfk1,sieunhanhoi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:33 2015 UTC,/r/TroveMarketplace exists for this purpose in case you haven't heard of it yet. Also since an auction house is in the works all of those off game methods will likely see a decline.
Trove,3dyfk1,kiokurashi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have an auction house in Trove. The problem I can think of is that there is no official currency system besides Cubits and Credits ysed in the store, one think I can see them doing is turning glim into the official currency and making recipes that previously required the crafting material ""Glim"" it would still cost glim, but as a currency."
Trove,3dyfk1,Shadowcataxa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:06 2015 UTC,"Well so far I don't think they have said much on it, but I think they'll let us keep choosing what we want to trade for. Simply have a little post and search function. Possibly allow partial orders so that way you don't need to supply 10k shapestone all at once if you don't want to. Probably would require the items to be deposited upon creation of the order. I just hope they don't require a usage fee like most auction houses in games(or life). It's just a child sink that isn't really beneficial to anyone. The trading itself is a good sink at the moment so it should take care of itself. Would be interesting if they did have the fee, but it would full up a piñata and once the piñata was big enough it would burst showering everyone with little amounts of flux and glim. Or have it spawn after a certain goal was reached and then you have to go and destroy it before it disappears."
Trove,3dyfk1,kiokurashi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I also think it creates diversity though. Some people value glim over flux, some people value flux over glim. Others may see resources such as shards, primordial flame and infinium as more important than that the former. If they could cater the auction house to that in some way, I think it would be nice. If not, I agree, glim should be the standard."

Trove,3dycie,Xeteth,3,Mon Jul 20 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"I find the DPS is lacking unless you really work for it. Just plugging away takes forever, but if I can use the Lucky Shot procs effectively my damage is actually decent. I wish the proc was easier to see...  If I can start by fully charging the Buster shot, I can usually get a proc before the mob swarm reaches me, so they eat 2 buster shots and then the rocket jump as I go airborne, then cleaning up with basic attacks. Works quite well, bosses are another story though...  Gunslinger Passive is super fun and essential for kiting. As long as it's not a low ceiling room, mobs can't reach me and I can make sure I stay airborne by hitting them and getting Buster procs and Rocket jumps.   I say stick with it, try to get as many procs as you can and dodge, dodge dodge :)  See You, Space Cowboy"
Trove,3dycie,Super_Pan,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"gunslinger really lacks in DPS unless you have like all top shadow items, while the candy barb has high damage all the way through the game."
Trove,3dycie,LymeMN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"Using your jump shot is vital if you want to obliterate the enemy imo. In the same method I use ice sage, getting up and getting the enemies to pool in the center while you charge a buster shot is my most common method. Usually I get a passive proc right after the buster shot so like Super_Pan said, they'll eat two shots before they touch you. It is still true that gunslinger is lacking in dps but it is still perfectly capable of soloing u5 sa in 8 mins so there has to be something there."
Trove,3dycie,kiokurashi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think Gunslinger is the only class with a percentage based attack speed buff (on his ult), which means you need really high tier equipment to get decent DPS. Combine good equipment with arcane and berserker emblems and you can dish out more damage than pretty much any class. Before that, he is kinda weak, yeah."

Uncommon chocolate fishes can provide you with mushroom chunks(x3), wild cupcakes(x3) and enchanted wood(x3).  Please note that the rarer a fish is the better the 'reward'. There are common and uncommon fishes too (the ones you'll encounter most of the time, that is). Common fishes yield from 3 to 80 glims (3/5/10/20/40/60/80 Glims), uncommon fishes yield 50 Glim + a ressource or 100 Glim.  In each category there are 7 commons (one for each potential reward) and a varying number of uncommons. Lava has the most uncommon fishes (7) while water has 6 (but 8 rare ones) and chocolate only 5.  Also it's important to note that enchanted fishes are only fish-able in water, and with a special fishing rod. Each of them yields 1k Glim as well as an enchanted scale, which you can use to craft the Enchanted Jellyfish mount.  I don't know the market prices for these ressources, but I'd say the bottles, the blank scrolls or the faerie dusts are the most valuable items you can get from salvaging the fishes. On the other hand, there are more chances that you get nice ressources from chocolate fishes than bottles from a lava fish or scrolls/dusts from a water fish (respectively 3 out of 18, 1 out of 20 and 2 out of 21), even though it probably costs less, if you have more you might sell them for more. This is all pure speculation though.  Side note : is fish-able even a word ? Idk man english is hard. Also if anyone has any formatting tips go ahead and message me, wish I knew how to space out those paragraphs a bit."

It could feel like you're getting better loot because if you open 20 chests quickly, you won't pay attention to the common loot, but if you suddenly drop a mount, not only will you notice it straight away, but the chest opening will also pause (game mechanism, the ""Open"" button remains grey for like 2 seconds).  A drop% boost when opening multiple chests is something that has probably never been seen in any game, and with reasons, as it would handicap the newer player that have no idea about it, and also dramatically boost the prices of chests in bulk, while decreasing the price of the rarer drops from those chests. They don't want to impact rarity too much I think, so it's very unlikely for this mechanism to exist !"

The item rarity increase both means Shadow Level and actual rarity. I don't know if Magic Find increases the interval it triggers on, or if it increases the rarity of dropped items when triggered.   I don't know about the flasks though but I imagine you can still trigger them manually."

A Resplendent item that was triggered by magic find would become a Shadow level 1. A Shadow level 1 item that was triggered by magic find would become a  Shadow level 2.  It should be noted that it is possible for magic find to trigger on the same item multiple times. It should also be noted that the chances of magic find  triggers has diminishing increments at higher levels of magic find.

Trove,3dxtht,jjtt311,2,Mon Jul 20 12:33:02 2015 UTC,"Hold on, hold on. I think this isn't a very well thought out idea. Sure, on low level areas you can skip past a lot of enemies and things but on Uber 5 or 6, I say best of luck to you.  Enemies start to hit like angry gods and each blow is like hurling semi trucks at you.  For the most part, traps are simply fluff. They're there as an added issue to the dungeon. If the dungeon is designed poorly the traps will be skipped, ignored and obviously useless.  I don't want to go to a dungeon, be limited in jumps, be mountless and not only am I getting slammed by enemies but traps as well. That sort of thing results in even more dungeons being skipped. It simply, isn't ""fun"". It's annoying and bothersome.  When you're trying to do a challenge because you've reached Mastery Rank 30 and unlocked them, you need to do multiple dungeons quickly in order to beat the timer. Having a dungeon take forever means it gets avoided and skipped in the future.  Often traps bug out and will constantly attack an already dead player. Fire traps are only interesting when placed correctly. Most of the time they're too far away or have loads of space around them, making it easy to walk around or jump over.  Another issue with this is having dungeons be harder because of Traps and lack of mounts mean a few things.  1) That fancy new mount you unlocked or bought is now useless for inside dungeons and only serves to help reach them.  2) Dungeons don't reward you with better loot based on how difficult the dungeon was for you. It's based on Magic Find and area Difficulty.  3) Dungeons are now focused on traps instead of being unique areas to explore and defeat bosses in.  4) Players will still always be able to build around/over traps and can often break blocks to avoid them.  I say, if they want to make dungeons interesting then design them around mounts. Design them to in fact BE interesting.  There aren't enough different types of traps to actually make a player feel as if they're being challenged. More often than not it's place spikes everywhere on the floor, add lava or those flame jets. Maybe if you're lucky they have multiple floors of jump blocks, push blocks and disappearing blocks."

Trove,3dvtlf,TheNinjaScout,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:37:56 2015 UTC,"Neon ninja is kind of weird but really strong for shadow arenas. Early on he has low health and as a melee can be blown up very fast. You need to learn how to use his stealth to avoid damage. In shadow arena he is very strong since he can keep a large group of enemies rooted for upwards of 7-9 Seconds. Generally what you want to do well using him is root them get three hits stealth and dodge damage then shoot shuriken and root again. For building him you want to focus on physical damage, energy regen and health. He prefers open areas so he can safely dash."
Trove,3dvtlf,Jobo100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:10:54 2015 UTC,"^ This.  As a Neon Ninja, the root I bring is super useful to my teammates. When playing in group I think the #1 utility for a Neon Ninja is the root. When farming dungeons, your group is usually too fast for you to be able to get 3 hits, stealth, and then hit your shurikens (you'll get this combo on bosses if you're here early on but that's it).  Solo playing the Ninja Neon can be tricky, it took me quite some time to figure out how to play him, and it probably didn't help that it was my first character. But afterward it's pretty funny and you dish out a lot of damage, you just have to be careful and you can go a long way. It's not easy though (I still have difficulties dodging AoE attacks and not getting into traps all the time) !  Also I picked it first because my friend said he was playing a Pirate, so I told him that if there were a Ninja class I would pick it. Fucking A to be able to do that IMO !"

The sustain isn't quite as high as a candy barb, but I've found it extremely easy to not get hit by utilizing my decoys and kiting.

If you played it you know how bad it's launch was and how they were really against adding new servers (which even then didn't help much until a month+ after the hype had died down and less people played). I mention that cause you'd think Trion would have learned how to launch a game and be ready for the huge influx of players. Instead they hedge their bets and very slowly open up more space.

Trove,3dubsm,gendelbendel,3,Mon Jul 20 03:26:17 2015 UTC,"For cubits, I strongly recommend buying classes before buying flasks or (especially) emblems.  I recommend unlocking as many classes as you can first and making it a priority to get each one to level 10. Easy mastery experience. You'll also train yourself to play the game faster by getting used to the game on a difficulty where you probably aren't going to be spending much time dying and get used to what some of the bosses do.   It also really helps later on when you get geared enough to do challenges, because challenges have a class bonus where you can get the rewards significantly faster by being on it. When you do challenges not on a bonus class, it's much slower. Unlocking and leveling the classes earlier prepares you more for later.  Lastly, you may discover a class that you enjoy playing more than the one you chose. For me, my starter class was Gunslinger, and I found it incredibly boring and slow, personally. Then I discovered the Pirate Captain and the Candy Barb and enjoy them much more and play on them mostly, aside from challenges that ask for a different class.  Another tip, unrelated to previous points and won't kick in until a bit later, is to max your hat first. The reason for that is hats rather versatile with their stats, which means that you can pretty much max one hat and use it on every class.  One last tip is to pay close attention to every piece of shadow gear you find. If you, for example, find a shadow level 1 hat with 4-5 stars already on it, upgrade it enough to get it to level 2, then salvage it, to get a twice forged soul, where you almost double your investment."
Trove,3dubsm,Teyazak,2,Sun Jul 19 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"The tip about the 4-5 stars shadow gear seems really good, never thought about it.  I agree with you on the class leveling stuff, too !"
Trove,3dubsm,HYPEStyleZ,3,Mon Jul 20 07:54:35 2015 UTC,"my biggest tip would be to find a good/funded Club early so you never have to worry about making uber teleports or any of that stuff.  To check your mastery XP press C > Trophy > look at the bar  No other players want sub-shadow gear in exchange for their $  If you build Bombs and use them to get through walls/floors in dungeons, you can speed your dungeons up about 300% faster  i dont recommend spending any cubits/flux/$ on weapons/gear unless you need it to physically go on or for crafting/mastery XP, you'll end up getting S3 gear from u6, anything beyond that you will have to craft/forge/buy."

Also I don't feel like I need the flasks and emblem. Maybe in uber5+, but I think it's far better to up other classes and gain mastery rank rather than push for the latest of the late game with one character, seeing as how mastery ranks matter far more important than anything else in the game (it's THE ultimate goal of the game with gearing up IMO)."

Trove,3dubsm,Cranzia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:24:00 2015 UTC,"For leveling I mostly recipe hunt. I'm in a recipe hunting club. The leveling just kind of comes with it. But yeah you have to be efficient. Going straight for the boss and ignoring the small monsters is pretty key. Knowing where the boss is on most dungeons will help a ton.   Also bombs. Use bombs. Bombs cost 10 shapestone 1 and flame thingy to make 4 bombs. That means you really only need to get 2.5 shapestone each bomb to be breaking even. While you run around, throw bombs at the patches of shapestone and ores when you see them. Get 20+ shapestone from one bomb easily. I never really purposely mine, sometimes I get carried away and go into a cave, but that only takes like 5 minutes to clear out with bombs. I got like 15k shapestone, 5k formicite, and like 1.5k infinium. Bombs just speed up everything so much. Whether it's breaking into a dungeon boss room or mining. They are great and a must have.  I have like 5 SL2 rings from ringcrafting. I probably made around 50-75 of the top tier ring boxes they weren't too terrible to get. Other shadow items are just kind of luck. Once I was around like 26 in xp and gear I started getting extra shadow gear. I put it in my club chest and use it for my next class. My 3 classes I use have pretty much full shadow gear."

Getting to lv. 20 isn't a big deal, neither is lvling your professions, so beside that it's gearing up your character, leveling up other classes, and perhaps getting mounts/recipes.   Gearing up your character doesn't give you any mastery points, but leveling your characters and learning mounts both do.   Just to come back to the profession thing : it can be quite time and ressources-consuming (leveling tomes for instance), but even then, its main purposes are getting mastery points, gearing up (ringcrafting) and crafting mounts (steed feed from guardening).  I don't think one could consider pixel art to be late game material.. Even though it can require recipes and plants you get from farming/leveling."

Working together as a group helps.  /SA is for Shadow Arenas. People will often leech but you sometimes get lucky.  Chat Channels only hold 50 people.

Trove,3dw388,coreys1127,2,Mon Jul 20 00:41:51 2015 UTC,"I rubber-band all the time, usually when jumping frequently. Sometimes when using Wings to travel.    It's like the server just goes ""haha nope"" and slams me in to the ground, causing fall damage, and sometimes shenanigans from enemies on the ground.    It gets pretty annoying. But I believe it's an issue with the Trove servers, and not something on your end. A part of it is the lag compensation part of their net code, but I may be wrong and it could just be the servers hiccuping a bit."

Occasionally I'll be firing and my shots ""although visibly still firing and whatnot"" will just stop ""hitting"" things (they start going through them or something). I sat in an SA for a while just wondering why it was taking so long to trigger LS but then I realized that I guess the game wasn't actually firing, so I had to waste energy with the charged shot manually and then continue firing.   Gunslinger is one of the classes (perhaps the only one atm) that needs a SERIOUS lookover (especially considering how cool of a class it is and what a shame it is that it's not very viable) along with maybe knight who could use  a damage based heal system to keep up and be able to tank/contribute late game SA'.s  Seriously, Gunslinger damage (even 2x boosted in SA with proper/better gear than everyone else) is worse than every other class ATM."

Trove,3dvuuu,ItsShinyLoL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"Funny Story, I was watching the connection speeds when logging into trove and it seems like the server doesn't keep a strong connection with you during loading (or at least to affect you that badly, I'm talking minimalistic data transfer). It puts your request into queue then sends your client queue updates, as in your queue position and estimates the time of your login, so it doesn't affect your download speed that much, so watching the LCS in twitch is uninterrupted and smooth :P"

Trove,3dvt8x,PrimoRaizel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hear that really awesome geared classes can handle U4 at most. A tank like Knight or Candy Barb may handle U5. But for the most part, those ubers aren't really soloable in an efficient manner.  Do you like the second-from-top stat of all your shadow items? If so, add a pearl to them. If not, find a new shadow item with a second stat you like, as you can't randomize that stat.  If I'm level 20, I just farm U3 solo or go into U5 arenas, if people are willing to carry me. With the new zone level restriction it's far more inconvenient to do that, so I mainly solo to get my base gear. Someone else who is more experienced could give better advice than this...  Uber 3 is of a reasonable difficulty for class levels of 18-20, and really feels like it has a good chance of giving shadow gear (though rarely upgraded). You'll want to farm with one class till you get a good weapon, then farm as the other to get your other weapon.  Oh, and I recommend doing shadow arenas as soon as you can until you get a heart of darkness, then decide whether you want an eye tome (useful for upgrading past Shadow Level 1 gear) or a tentacle tome (for randomizing your last two of four stats on gear)."
Trove,3dvt8x,Carrotloid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:25:10 2015 UTC,"I see, thats very helpful but, can i only get one tome? Both of them seem pretty mandatory. Cant i use one for when i want to farm eyes and then the other when i want to farm tentacles?"
Trove,3dvt8x,Carrotloid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"You can get both, but heart of darkness's can be pretty hard to obtain. So, decide which you would want to get first. You can also switch between them at any time- I believe the tome's ""progress"" will be saved even if you switch tomes.  If you are planning on only having a couple classes, the eye tome sounds better. If you have a lot of classes, you'll want tentacles."
Trove,3dvpo3,Meesh_7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:28 2015 UTC,For every class the emblem that doubles damage is always a good choice. Next I would suggest instant energy fill our the increased energy Regen. Which ever you think would suit your style better.

The downtime before this one was to implement some fixes because people were losing progress on their club worlds when they ported in and out. Database issues- major problem. This one is unplanned due to the auth server crashing, so I imagine once that is resolved, considering they already did patches once today, we will be good for quite some time. It seems like there is typically one major downtime for upgrades on any given day, which is why I make that assumption.  And hey, at least they're fixing it!

Trove,3dv884,kalczeron,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:34:07 2015 UTC,so what class is best for lategame content?
Trove,3dv884,kalczeron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:05:27 2015 UTC,I've been playing a lot of Shadow Hunter and Ice Sage. Crowd control is invaluable in U5 and U6.
Trove,3dv884,BossL1K3,2,Mon Jul 20 04:33:14 2015 UTC,"As always it depends on your build. E.G. a Candy Barb that builds on hp and ener regen wont need double ener regen or 100% fill energy. But a barb that has 0 Ener Regen will most likely opt that way to get the 100% fill and get the 18 flasks + additional flasks. But Double Damage is always good and the rest is preference. For Barb i would recommend the invurnebilty or reset cooldown for the ultimate to not let your friends die. I didnt play the rest that much, maybe for the Raiser its good to have the AoE Heal on the flask for his big friend. Boomer can go either Bow or Sword, for Sword the Vampiric is quite nice, the Bow Ranger could go for some healing and the Knight is afaik a tank so lifesteal, invurnebilty and AoE heal would be nice."

Trove,3dv7zr,qaden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:07 2015 UTC,I am thinking of doing the costume chest and the chaos chests. Are emblems useful for the point of spending 750 credits on them?
Trove,3dv7zr,Izwin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:49 2015 UTC,I think you should wait till you get more credits from the mastery and buy an extra chesttab for your personal chest. flasks and emblems are quite easy obtainable through cubits and the chaos chests are pretty random...i opened like 50 and everything good i got was a mystery costume box. in my opinion the extra space is well worth it
Trove,3dv7zr,BossL1K3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:16 2015 UTC,Save them you get some with mastery and maybe you buy more. But if you wanna use them buy costume or class or emblem. Its up to you.

I don't know how it is in lower tiers but the person may have been under geared, causing their minions to die extremely fast or they just didn't know how to make the giant one. The giant that you summon when sacrificing 6 minions can just sit there while the enemies all swarm around him so that they are easy to aoe down. It is extremely tanky.

Trove,3dtx9q,mechadude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:04 2015 UTC,The strength of the boomeranger is in its explosives. The boomerang exists to lower your cooldowns and throw more explosives.  The explosives let you mine super easily and skip entire dungeons straight to the boss by blowing a hole in the wall.
Trove,3dtx9q,Arsonide,2,Sun Jul 19 13:33:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it isn't strong, I'm saying that it looked like he was holding two boomerangs but he's holding the one boomerang and the practice bow in reality. And going out of your way to get primordial flames and shapestone allows you to do that anyway with a faster fuse bomb.   It was pretty dissapointing when I looked into what the boomeranger actually was. It's fun but it's just a bunch of legend of zelda and nintendo tropes and not the boomerang guy I was wanting."

Not sure exactly how to word it. It checks to see if you've done anything at all, not if you are doing something. This means macros and auto clickers would work since they aren't a command that just holds mouse click for you, but does individual clicks, therefore it believes you are performing actions yourself, and not just staying in the same state for a long period of time.

Not to mention, it kinds of makes the game look a little noobish if they aren't.

This passive will be useless early levels since everything dies so quickly and you won't be able to get your stacks up. Reaper's Touch, same as above, will be quite useless early game since you wont be able to get your stacks up since they die rather quick. Impending Doom and Reaper's Touch would probably only be usefull in U5 and U6. Beyond the Grave, there should be a limit on how many enemies can get rooted by this since otherwise you could just use Beyond the Grave then dash through everything using Reaper's Touch which would (probably) deal a quite high amout of damage with such a combo. Witching Hour should also increase the amout of damage done by Reaper's Touch since it increases the damage done by Impending Doom. I also think they should get a special weapon (Death Scythe) if they actually get added to the game.  Just some thoughts i had about this, it's a good class idea but changes should be added if it ever gets added. :P"
Trove,3du7tz,Sognux,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"That is true, but you blow through those early levels within an hour or two anyway. Also maybe Beyond the Grave could be a small AOE zone, to limit the amount of rooted enemies and reward good timing. Yea I was thinking the the double boost to the amplified damage should also apply to Reaper's Touch so it gains the additional 20% damage amp on the consumption of marks.

Trove,3dsbey,OriginalPocketWeed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:01:26 2015 UTC,The game was released a week ago and had a massive influx.
Trove,3dsbey,DrOcktopus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"It was released on steam a week ago, it's been playabe for a whole lot longer. They didnt project their traffic accordingly when getting released on something that has millions of players they are getting advertised to (i saw it on the front page banners 3 times in the past week)."

Trove,3du5ri,Worrun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:32:08 2015 UTC,U6 can drop up to Shadow 3 but onward from there you have to forge your gear for it to be better. Silly thing is you can't get to U6 without already having Shadow 4 gear.
Trove,3du5ri,CruentusVI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"It's not very silly, it just makes it easier to upgrade your gear.  I don't think they intended for you to use the level 3 gear that drops but instead of thrice forged or upgrade it to level 4 to get quad forged for much cheaper."
Trove,3du5ri,RohaktheHawk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:45:36 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're talking about.  Everything pre-Uber gives a rapid sense of upgrades and excitement. Gear wasn't too important because in a level or two you'll get to the next zone and replace all of it. Once you hit Uber 1, shadow items drop with semi-rarity so that they are still good upgrades but don't feel obnoxiously rare.  Then you have four Shadow 1 items and are faced with ""now what?""...  First 10 or so levels of the game are incredibly deceptive on how the last 10 levels will play out.  You're not missing anything. The natural progression of items starts off ""dropping like candy"" and goes to ""gotta grind real hard"".    There are three main stages of gear: Everything before Uber (Relic and below), Shadow, Radiant.   To get more and better Shadow gear, you can either keep killing stuff and doing Shadow Arenas to hope you get better drops or by using the Forge to improve your current gear.  This means it is entirely possible to get better gear without fighting; you can use trading as a means to obtain upgrade materials."
Trove,3du5ri,GambitsEnd,-2,Sun Jul 19 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely spot on, not only are you exactly on point but you have opened my eyes to some other things! Thanks a bunch, I'd guild you if I didn't hate Elen Pao (i know she's gone)"
Trove,3dr9cr,Spikezila,2,Sat Jul 18 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"Why don't you do the Radiant Shards quest already, and what are thosse quests ?"
Trove,3dr9cr,xClaush,3,Sat Jul 18 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not high enough lvl to do it. they are called Challenges, and they give 2 azurian dragon chests. I get like 1 every 2 hours or so."
Trove,3dr9cr,Userlicious,2,Sat Jul 18 18:18:42 2015 UTC,What level do you need for those shards? I own over 100 and thought the quest was bugged.
Trove,3dr9cr,Userlicious,3,Sat Jul 18 18:25:03 2015 UTC,no. you actually need to go to sky realm and obtain them from dungeons. as opposed to Fishing/chest/caches
Trove,3dr9cr,quickiler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"Weird, I did earn em at a sky realm. :/"
Trove,3dr9cr,Smoka-Cola,2,Sat Jul 18 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"did you just fight the knight guys around in sky realm, or actually the dungeons?, if the answer is dungeons, then I have no idea..."
Trove,3dr9cr,SomeMoleGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:06 2015 UTC,Shard quest can be completed by gathering them in dungeon at sky realm only. Challenge are first 20 min of every hours.
Trove,3dr9cr,BigBuddie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"You don't fight anything in the sky realm dungeons. There are the roaming knights, but they're not in dungeons.  The dungeons have the cursed skull activator, but it just spawns a ton of boxes. As long as you have wings and a sky portal, you can do that quest at any level."
Trove,3dr9cr,BigBuddie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:35:21 2015 UTC,"Just fly around and look for those big things where the quest says ""Dark heart"" or something. Some pots will appear, just smash them for shards."
Trove,3dr9cr,BigBuddie,2,Sat Jul 18 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"These challenges only occur in Uber4 and higher or so, right? I'm an even higher level than you and I never got any of those challenges.."
Trove,3dr9cr,xClaush,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"I get them anywhere and i go to lvl 6-7 area to 1 shot bosses to quickly get the cache. ive been in since alpha but only really played since steam, and my friend hasnt got these challenges either..."
Trove,3dr9cr,myriadofelephants,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:57 2015 UTC,I think I found the problem on the wiki.. Are you mastery level 30 already? Because thats the level you have to be according to the wiki to get these challenges :P
Trove,3dr9cr,KDBA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"yup, i'm like 32"
Trove,3dr9cr,myriadofelephants,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"Aha, that explains it :) Thanks!"
Trove,3dr9cr,KDBA,0,Sat Jul 18 18:46:39 2015 UTC,But.. i finished the Radiant Shards quest when i was mastery lvl 15  and you are mastery 30 already just get some guy with a skyrealm portal and do it its easy ._.
Trove,3dr9cr,myriadofelephants,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:16:51 2015 UTC,you can't go in to a sky realm portal without being gear/xp level 26 now so it's harder to do
Trove,3dr9cr,KDBA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:21:28 2015 UTC,I did it earlier today at level 18 or so.
Trove,3dr9cr,xClaush,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:43:57 2015 UTC,xp level 18 =/= level 18
Trove,3dr9cr,XpHog,0,Sun Jul 19 01:06:52 2015 UTC,xp level 14 + 4 gear level = 18. All of those number are lower than 26.
Trove,3dr9cr,ancientfartsandwich,0,Sun Jul 19 01:28:21 2015 UTC,well you're pretty obviously bullshitting then
Trove,3dr9cr,ancientfartsandwich,0,Sun Jul 19 01:41:39 2015 UTC,I'm really not.
Trove,3dr9cr,quickiler,0,Sun Jul 19 06:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yes you can some guy i know was in the sky realm, and he just send me a /joinme invite and we mined 100 shards .. ezpz"
Trove,3dr9cr,Zahlfire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:12:09 2015 UTC,"The quests are called challenges or conquests. You unlock them when you reach mastery level 30. You get one every hour on the hour, and have twenty minutes to complete it."
Trove,3dr9cr,JohnzBallad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:50:41 2015 UTC,This is nothing.  Wait till you have no more dungeons to do and you're 96/100 on the third part of this challenge.  It's happened to me twice this week.  It's really cool doing this on uber 5 with 20+ other people all flying in unison.  A really cool sight.
Trove,3dr9cr,cardiganz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"whoa, didn't know you could get THAT high. I've beaten the 40/40 one but nothing higher."
Trove,3dr9cr,wolfbasher9000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:24 2015 UTC,Yeah luckily I found a club that's always doing them.  I can port to them and do it pretty quick.  There are huge groups doing them in u5 generally.  Sometimes 100 is impossible unless you have the bonus class though.
Trove,3dr9cr,TheBlindMonkz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend you to try to get into U5 for challenges, there are always group of people doing the same thus having a raid of 20+ people to bang bosses, been able to complete 40/40 without bonus. However take note that only 8 peoples get loots so dont freak out like i did :p"
Trove,3du3n5,BlackLumious,2,Sun Jul 19 14:08:06 2015 UTC,Send an email to support@trovegame.com :)
Trove,3du3n5,CandyFTW,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"Why does it matter if you used someone elses referral code? Even if you dont get anything from it, whats the problem of someone else getting some loot?"
Trove,3du3n5,Stephenmc100,5,Sun Jul 19 14:10:54 2015 UTC,A scam is a scam...
Trove,3du3n5,7Bomber7,2,Sun Jul 19 14:17:59 2015 UTC,"Because it's not fair. It's a serious issue. When the guy/girl gets caught tricking people he will get perma banned. So, the guy/girl who tricked OP will probably be banned since he'll most likely send a support ticket to the devs, and they can look it up."
Trove,3du3n5,BigBuddie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:20:09 2015 UTC,fair enough
Trove,3du19h,Psytorxxx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:39:52 2015 UTC,Thought that class tokens themselves could only be bought (aside from free ones given out recently).   You can obviously just unlock classes by buying them with in game currency (cubits) rather than spending real money.
Trove,3du19h,Sheepski,0,Sun Jul 19 14:08:21 2015 UTC,ah i thinked that we could farm them :'(
Trove,3du19h,Sheepski,2,Sun Jul 19 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"nah sorry. You can earn cubits in game to buy them with though, don't have to spend real money."
Trove,3du05c,Captainfuckwaffles,3,Sun Jul 19 13:26:52 2015 UTC,"Its ok, they will later on take the servers down for 9 hours to fix this issue!"
Trove,3du05c,DuGringo,3,Sun Jul 19 13:53:43 2015 UTC,I'd be laughing my ass off for this .. if it wasnt true :/
Trove,3du05c,Taargkrizzt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:19:20 2015 UTC,I found the only way to work for me was to buy the DLC directly off the steam store page rather than their website or the ingame shop.
