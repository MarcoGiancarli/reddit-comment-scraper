I think what the woman is doing is admirable because a majority of the time, the condom probably does fit a guy, but it doesn't take into account the minority of men who condoms really don't fit well/at all for. The overall message is about protection and not having an excuse to not use protection. That aside, it can be fairly dangerous to say hey all condoms fit because I can fit it on my arm, mainly because if the condom doesn't fit right, it is going to tear! She should do another post of her vigorously rubbing her arm to see how much it takes to make it break and if she can feel anything.  There are also a few comments that say just buy magnums. But then I have to explain that magnums are bigger on the head, but at the base they are virtually the same size as regular condoms and for some men, that is where the issue lies. I researched all sorts of condoms and different sex issues in regards to condoms available for about 20ish hours. Yay being a graduate student in human development and family studies! I can use any of the information from this research in the class human sexuality. Mostly researched condoms when I wanted to get off birth control for a while and needed to find my husband something that worked.

Yeah it sucks to have your experiences discounted but the reactions just seem a bit over the top to me. There are larger sizes available and honestly most people aren't going to be in that niche area where even the largest commercial sizes don't fit period.  The reason that those posts exist is because a lot of guys without actual big dicks try to cheese out of using a condom with that excuse and attempt to guilt girls into unprotected sex.

With the prior unsuccessful attempts (and in looking at your history, if reading correctly, your relationship was long distance at one point), it would be hard not to let it go to the fore and psych yourself out. If toys scare you, how can a penis not?   What you need to do, outside of the obvious of making sure you are super excited and properly wet down there (either naturally or with some help from lube) is to relax. If you are overthinking and worrying too much, you will never relax.   The good news is that it sounds like you both geniunely care about each other and you have no other major issues, so if that is the case, you should be able to overcome this at some point.

It is one way that porn uses to give the illusion of big dicks.  The tiny girl plays with it and the guys keep their hands off of it as much as possible.  When the men do grab it they can usually overlap their thumb and fingers.

Hope this isn't the case - UTIs suck and they take some work to prevent, but they are often caused by sex (they used to be called honeymoon cystitis if my old-as-dust Catholic doctor is to be believed).  If the pain is just from your dick/friction/sex itself (also possible) then you guys might need more lube, and she might have to speak up during sex to slow things down when it gets uncomfortable - there's no way it's painless if it hurts that much afterwards.

Because the sample is so large maybe you'll find that girl, or you'll find another who's much more petite and prefers the 5 inches.  It's luck of the draw and why sexuality is much more complex than data from (limited) studies.   I would say that could be why ""size doesn't matter"" holds some merit.

Don't worry about the BD, if she likes it you'll know when you have your way with her.  If she doesn't, you can always find more girls who do like it.  Without knowing more about you, her, and your situation, I can't suggest a way you could get yourself invited over to her place, but if she's into you even the dumbest excuse will work, such as ""Wanna listen to this cool music I just found?""  Story time.  I had a cute young neighbor girl always taking her dogs for a walk when I was working in my yard or driveway (working on my truck or motorcycle etc). She often wore a little skirt and these knee-high high heeled boots which I thought was unusual for walking dogs.  She was doing that exactly to see if she could get my attention (she confessed later).  Of course it worked!  I always said hi and talked to her, the usual chit chat, then walked with her and the dogs once, and after that she started coming over.  She kind of had to sneak out if she came over at night.  We never got caught because she never told her parents, and we actually had a plausible legit reason for hanging out whenever they knew she was coming over.  I'm glad I didn't get shot for banging my neighbor's daughter.  Her dad was an ex con and I was kind of scared of him, but he liked me because I gave him a big bottle of Crown Royal for his birthday and sometimes I hung out playing cards with them and their friends etc."

Still, every girl is different, and making broad generalizations about east Asian women isn't very useful.  The girl I am remembering had never done anything sexual when I met her.  Even if there were a half billion women who would have a rough time with you, the specific girl you met may have a grand cavern just waiting for somebody to fill her up.

It's MEN that like to see women taking huge dicks, not women. The most popular pornstars according to women are almost always of average size.   James Deen was named Male Performer of the Year. He has over 2000 pornos under his belt. And he's about 6 inches [7 tops], with an average girth. Ryan Driller, similarly, is an immensely popular pornstar. And again, he is about 6 inches.

bigdickproblems,3dho6c,Sirefly,16,Fri Jul 17 10:33:26 2015 UTC,"Part of it might be social, the ""gossip factor"". Women are socially conditioned to believe a BD is what they are supposed to want.  Unfortunately many women who actually experience BD's find out that's not the case.  But if BD's are rare, and the average woman doesn't have very many partners, then the average woman never gets to experience one, so they never find out whether they really prefer one or not. They just think they would because that's what they've been led to believe.  Also, the problem might not be with the ideal size, per se, but with the reporting of what size is ideal.  Women are very bad at estimating sizes, especially after the fact.  In one study, women were given a 3d model of a penis and told to examine it for 30 seconds. They were then asked to pick that same model from a bin of 33 models, either immediately or after completing a 10-minute survey (to allow time to pass).  After completing the 10-minute survey, women tended to overestimate the size of the penis they had previously examined.  So women who are asked to choose their ideal penis size, even from a group of physical models,  are probably choosing one that is too big."

bigdickproblems,3dho6c,Anthropodick,12,Thu Jul 16 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"Who wants average though? 5'9"" is the average height, but the ideal height for many women is taller. 100 IQ may be correlated with having average intelligence, but many women want guys who are more intelligent that the average.  Let's ask - why is our penis size 5.5"" when much bigger gorillas have penises which are only 1.25"" big? As humans, we have evolved this way because our ancestral females have preferred larger penis over smaller ones: ""Larger human penis suggests that hominids needed to keep females with choice sexually satisfied. Ancestral females would have experienced a sexual freedom denied in Western cultures today and it has been suggested that our ancestors went through a period of matriarchy and enhanced female choice""  I have read studies which predict average human penis size would continue to get much bigger, which can only be facilitated by the fact that females are re-asserting their freedom and preferences. In the recent past, there would be no premarital sex, and the female would be stuck with her first sexual partner - good or bad. Now, she can exercise immense freedom in choosing the right male partner.  As others have said, the ideal-sized penis really isn't that much bigger than average though. A penis 6.5""-7"" long would be long enough to bottom out/give deep orgasms with most girls. Meanwhile, with girth 5-5.5"" is thrown around as the ideal girth, but there is much more variation. Some girls are quite loose, and might desire 6""+. Others are tighter and 5"" could be ideal for them."
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,bdp_stats,6,Thu Jul 16 12:23:53 2015 UTC,"The comparison with IQ is very apt: 68% of people are between 85 and 115, but that level of intelligence is not help us as an ideal in our culture. But there are other traits where the majority defines what is desirable, e.g. most people are heterosexual and, at least until recently, that is what was defined as ""normal"", desirable sexuality. So why do we hold up extremes as the ideal in some cases but not in others?  Also, who are you quoting just out of interest?  And others have pointed out that bigger penises actually afford less pleasure to women than average ones, so I'm curious as to why women would be driven to desire large ones over average ones.  Not sure if penises will get bigger, since in our society who you have sex with isn't the same as who you reproduce with. A girl may sleep around with hung men while on birth control, but she'll want to settle down and have babies with an average guy with a job, house and car."

Scientific American, March 1995, 82-88.  It really comes down to a matter of compatibility. Women range a lot in vaginal size as well. Vaginal length seems to be around 4-6"" (longer with more arousal), but there's a huge variance in vaginal ""girth"". And many women do prefer girth over length. If a penis is not thick enough, it would be loose inside the vagina, and very little of the vagina will be stimulated. Once it is thick enough, however, all of the penis comes in contact with the vagina, and the lady parts will be rubbed the right way."

Newer way of thinking this through  should be with the lense of epigenetics and environment micro-adaptations and stuff like that.  Also IQ is not a valid measure of anything other than the ability to do an IQ test, so it means nothing at all in terms of  making comparison in a evolutionary context."

If not clearly stated it somewhat implies that modification in the size of the brain, result in the need for larger female genitalia for accommodating bigger size of offspring's heads, eventually also favoring the reproduction of bigger penis size, which become more fit for successful penetration. Sort of more of a mutual interaction than a classic linear one.  While this paper do not convey absolute truths, it's a bit less dated and more in line with the kind of stuff that could explain some of it nowadays.   Also expression of a  so-called ''dick size'' gene would be limited by environmental factor such as nutrition. So it's not only genetic."

But I do agree that it's a little odd to take bonobos as clear windows into the human past; they are another parallel branch of the tree, not an earlier version of our own branch. Also as I understand it, in view of the very small population of bonobos against common chimpanzees (who have much more violent sexual ethics), one could argue that free love is not a recipe for Darwinian success."
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,espresso_titian,-3,Fri Jul 17 00:49:04 2015 UTC,I speculate the average penis size will get smaller as men continue to evolve more feminine
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,caseyjones44,4,Fri Jul 17 00:41:04 2015 UTC,"maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I mean average anything when it comes to people isn't really ideal. Average looks, intelligence, strength, how funny they are, sex skills, height, tits, physical fitness, etc. Rarely is average ideal ever. Average is definitely acceptable but not ideal.  When it comes to penis size, that might be the same thing. I know if you go too far from average in either direction you will run into problems. As far as penis size is concerned I assume it is because the body is not equipped to handle those extremes.  A little below or above the vagina can, because of its nature. Stretchy.  As for why the right side. The larger ones stretch and hit more surface area at a time than the smaller ones. So I think that is why.  Maybe I'm 500% wrong but to me this seems very logical. What is the ideal size? Idk, I could hope it's my exact size."

bigdickproblems,3dho6c,caseyjones44,5,Thu Jul 16 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"The average really doesn't have much meaning though. Let's say 25% of girls prefer 4"", 25% prefer 5"", 25% prefer 7"", and 25% prefer 8"". Then on average, girls will prefer a 6"" penis, but the 6"" guy won't be the top choice for any girl.  Not to mention - how is anyone going to do a proper study on the matter? Anecdotal evidence - along with pseudo-scientific studies/surveys - might be the best we can do in the foreseeable future.  And take it as you will, but anecdotal evidence seems to be strongly in favor of dicks that are at least a bit above average. As /u/Redbullcannon states, it's not unusual for big guys to have a near-perfect batting average when it comes to giving girls an orgasm - even when the body count is well into the double digits. And many times, they are the first ones to be able to give their girls an orgasm. But for smaller guys, it seems rare for them to even give a single girl an orgasm."

Are there any good studies of what women (or men for that matter) feel to be the ideal size?

At the heart of the matter is the fact that the human vagina size varies quite a bit as well, and what is ""ideal"" would be different for every woman. Instead of it being a ""bigger is better"", or ""one size is best for all"", it is rather a matter of compatibility. Wide/deep vaginas are best suited for large penises, and narrow/shallow vaginas would be best suited for small penises.  For example, there are many reports of guys around 7""x5"" moving to Asian countries, and having immense problems having intercourse with girls there.  What does seem to be clear is that women do have a size preference. For example, in the following study: ""Stulhofer A. How (un)important is penis size for women with heterosexual experience? Arch Sex Behav 2006;35:5–6."", only 24% of women said penis length was unimportant, and 25% said girth was unimportant. And women's size preferences develop as a result of having more sexual partners. The corresponding percentage saying length/girth was unimportant was 31/31% for women with 1-2 sexual partners, and only 15/17% for women with more than 5 sexual partners."

For example, let's suppose there are three girls and three dick sizes (small: ""4x4"", avg: ""5.5x4.5"", and big: ""7x5"").  And let's suppose the girls give the following scores for dick of each size:   Girl 1: (Small - 10, Medium - 9,  Big  -  1) Girl 2: ( Big   - 10, Medium - 9, Small - 6) Girl 3: ( Big   - 10, Medium - 9, Small - 6)   The big dick is preferred by 2/3 of girls, so you might think it's the best. However, using a different scoring scheme, you see that it has the least aggregate sum (1+10+10 = 21). Meanwhile, the avg-sized dick isn't preferred by any of the girls, but it has the most aggregate sum (9+9+9=27).  So it really is one of those cases where you can't get a clear answer, because there really isn't a single clear answer to the question."
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,bdp_stats,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"Well if the subjects are asked to score from 1 to 10, I would have thought the researcher would be after the aggregate sum for each penis type. And I'm not as pessimistic as you about finding results this way. For instance, I would be very surprised if penises that are significantly below average have similar or higher aggregate scores as average-sized penises."
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,bigdickaltaccount,5,Thu Jul 16 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. No doubt such a study could be done, but it would be an enormous undertaking just to produce results with any validity. You likely would need to control for age/# of children/sexual experience/race/fitness level, among other things. Not to mention that obtaining a random sample would be near impossible.  And really, I think personal experience is the only way to find out if you are sexually compatible. Sure, one could look at a petite Asian girl, and think there's no way. Or look at a tall blonde chick and think that she would be a great fit. But you won't know for sure until you try."

I can buy that, if you poll lots of women on their ideal size (assuming they know the actual measurements), it would come out as above the current average, but not by a lot.  Also, what is uncontroversial is that penis size is relatively unimportant to most women, at least when set against all the other factors that go into making a partner attractive. There just isn't a lot of selection pressure pushing for bigger dicks."
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,gregu8211,3,Fri Jul 17 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily though. For example, look at today's society. Arguably, the intelligent people among us are having fewer children on average than those who are less intelligent - but intelligence is undeniably a desirable trait.  And some would argue that penis size has been increasing substantially due to sexual selection that favors bigger penises. For example, why do we have have penises that are quadruple the size of a gorilla's?  Finally, research does suggest that bigger dicks are more successful in causing orgasms.  This all said, I can see how from the perspective of a 10.75""x6.75"" person, the cons of a bd can outweigh the benefits :)"
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,goodkid93,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:14:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe intelligence isn't a desired trait. It got us this far, but it might not get us farther. That said, I personally believe in the tool-holders theory of evolution; when a society becomes advanced enough to shape tools to modify its environment, natural selection mostly stops, save for cosmetic changes.  Maybe it has, it would be interesting to find out, but it seems like all penis research is just shitty. Which sucks  Haha, that is true. Sure there's a matter of how you use it and all, but having more size = more surface area = more contact = more stimulation.  It has its ups and downs, and when its up sometimes I wish it was down"
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,goodkid93,3,Fri Jul 17 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"Judging from your comment history and some of the comments in this thread.. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say this is an insecurity-fueled thread veiled as constructive discussion.  I mean, it seems like when you came to your conclusion your tone changed. Since you're 7 x 5 I think you believe that your size is the end all be all to what the general preference is.  Forgive me for cross-analyzing your post instead of paying more attention to the subject at hand, but I just don't see the point behind this thread really.  Anyways, to answer the thread in the shortest way possible asking why average isn't the ideal has the same answer as ""why isn't big the ideal"". Well, basically because preference varies too much it's hard if not impossible to answer without it being a more subjective than objective view.  I'm sure there's pretty petite women out there who would prefer a 6"" or even a 5.5"" if it had decent girth, as that seems to be a good size for a focus on g-spot stimulation.  Then there's maybe girls who would like deeper, so 6.5-7 range would be more ""ideal"" for that. And then there's the girls who like really deep penetration/cervix stimulation, which is anywhere 7"" and above.   There just isn't a definitive answer to what is the ""ideal"" because say for instance flavor of ice cream. I'm sure the answers to that would vary greatly.  Maybe on some days a girl would prefer 7, maybe there's another chick more built for an 8"". Then there's the fabled size queen who would probably prefer a 9"" (which is ""rarer"" I guess).  What I find anyways is that girth is probably fairly more significant. 5.5-6"" girth is the larger territory and would be ""ideal"" for girls who like being stretched out.  TL;DR: There is no ideal. Some argue bigger is better, some argue closer to average is better. Some argue just above average is better. It's a mixed bag that probably can't be answered without a really detailed and extensive study."
bigdickproblems,3dho6c,RoninUnderground,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that I really should have split this into two separate threads. One would discuss whether there is an ideal penis size or range of penis sizes, and the other would try to answer why this ideal doesn't match the reality of the average penis, if in fact it does differ. I began the thread with the assumption that we already know what the ideal is and that it is bigger than the average, but this may not even be true.  Also, to answer your point about women varying in their ideal, that is absolutely true, but it is not incompatible with the idea that your average woman is more likely to prefer a penis within a certain range than outside that range. In terms of life advice, the best is just to be honest and straightforward about your preferences. The science on that is pretty clear that penis size is not important for most women."

It is the same across other cultures. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, it is the female primate seeking out ideal choices between rival mates. Even primates had orgasms, so they sought out males who could provide that, or so they thought, by size. This could be partly why women at least fantasize about big penises. Women have evolved from the primate (thankfully) to judge a man by more than just his penis, but are (still) sexually imaginative when it come to big cocks."

Some girls are... let's say, ""a little bit fucked up"". I find it very easy to find girls, and I am still exited about sex and get hard most of the time, but sometimes I dread sex and dont wanna have it (mental block). While I get great feedback from women ""you're the best lover"" shit like that, I feel sexually extremely insecure. External validation helps very little with dick problems. Additionally, not getting it up a few times, makes me afraid it might happen again - rational explanations like that I was sick that time and it's normal that sex wasnt my bodies first priority when sick, dont matter to my insecurities."
bigdickproblems,3dg0do,schengen1,3,Fri Jul 17 22:04:13 2015 UTC,"Woah dude. Actually, my experiences have been somewhat similar:  My first gf - she loved having sex and the big dick. I was in love with her, but she got weird and distant - and sometimes physically violent - towards the end of our 3 year relationship. She dumped me and it messed me up for a while. Getting therapy/medication helped - but only to an extent. Then the cycle repeated itself with my second gf, who too dumped me after 3 years.  In the interim, I had shorter relationships. The trouble is, I wasn't really into these girls as I was with my ex-gfs. With some girls, I liked them at first, but later discovered something that turned me off. What's really messed up is that my non-caring attitude towards them made them even more attracted to me. Some girls kept harassing me even after I dumped them - giving me booty calls/wanting to remain fwbs. And some girls were genuinely cuckoo. I had performance issues with some girls - arising partly from the fact that I wasn't really that attracted to them - but this didn't stop them from thinking that I was a sex God.  I'm happy to report though that I'm with my third serious gf and things are great again. I'm insanely in love with her. Also, she says I'm the first to give her multiple orgasms, and our sexual chemistry is great.  So hopefully for you, it's just a matter of needing to find the right girl. If getting girls is very easy, perhaps you need to raise your standards? For me, that was probably one of the  culprits - I lowered standards out of desperation/loneliness, and ended up with girls that I didn't want."

The metric should be length+girth as in this calculator (http://bl.ocks.org/abovethemean/raw/9395398/).

It wasn't till about the beginning of this year that we saw tears in her vagina and I said she needs to go to a new doctor and as soon as he saw it thats what he told us. so we are waiting for her to heal then we will be trying again on saturday with lots of lube and shit and see if it makes a difference.
bigdickproblems,3dc93v,DeathMcGrips,5,Wed Jul 15 03:35:04 2015 UTC,Doctor visit would probably be the most helpful.  Could bring it up the next time you have a physical or checkup.    Could it be a mental thing?  When you are engaging in sexual activity are you focused on trying to orgasm and after a while wondering why it won't happen/getting frustrated that it isn't happening?

As a person who respects authenticity, since I was a lot younger I always would measure Master Frodo with a lightly place ruler sitting to the side of him and avoid any ""cheating"". At just under 8"" with the NBP I had always used, now I feel more confident in telling people who ask that its the official BD status of 8 inches. Also in regards to the OP's question, im pretty sure guys over 7 would still be using bone pressed measurements since the difference between 7.5 and 8 inches can be pretty significant when your dealing with size queens."

If you veer off to the side at all, you can usually get an extra half to a full inch even if you don't bone-press.   Also, I would argue marginal utility above 7.5"" is pretty low, as 7.5"" can safely give the deepest cul-de-sac orgasms for a vast majority of girls.

bigdickproblems,3dacj5,hungrockhunk,23,Tue Jul 14 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"I think being a show-er tends to mean that your dick is always getting more blood flow than it would otherwise be getting. And since having that blood flow down there means it's somewhat engorged, that means it's more likely to feel pressure--like from your pants, for example. And, as we men all know, pressure against the peen is pleasurable thing.   So, in conclusion, yes: being a show-er means you're going to be inherently more aware of your dong at all times because you feel it more.  Speaking for myself, also a show-er, when I'm in public I have to keep from unconsciously reaching down and just giving it a little rub or a push from time to time. I'm seriously not even aware I'm doing it, but that doesn't make it less creepy or weird for anyone else watching."

I think it's mostly a consequence of feeling that sex is so far away for me.  I was sexual with a girl for the first time a year and a half ago and made out with a girl a year ago and around that time I was horny as fuuuuck. Because sex was at the horizon.   But now it's been so long and I get no attention from girls and I rarely ever meet new ones so my sex drive is just.... On standby.  Honestly it doesn't feel good and it worries me.   It's like when you eat you know. When you regularly eat you get hungry more often. And you want to remove the feeling of hunger.

bigdickproblems,3dcmv2,piratesarrrawesome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:01:35 2015 UTC,my wife is tight at the opening and tents on the inside except when shes cumming then the whole length of her vag squeezes. if the tenting creates no sensation for you try to adjust your angle so that it rubs her top or bottom wall with the bottom of your dick's head.  i do this by simply scootching up toward her head after mounting. in doggy or spoons it rubs her g area. in missionary it goes under her cervix. you can also stretch the end (beyond cervix to deep spot). wifey loves that.

A shower: A penis that looks impressive while flaccid. 4.5"" could suffice (being more than an inch above average), and 5"" would probably be safe.  A grower: A penis that is not a shower when flaccid, but which grows to an impressive size when erect. 6.5"" erect could suffice (being about an inch above average), and 7"" erect would probably be safe."

That category is the normal/average penis. It has a flaccid length that is in the average range.   I consider a grower to be a penis that is smaller than average in flaccid size, yet grows to an average or above average erect size.   Think of it like a 'sleeper' car, with the faded paint and stock look, but a 700hp engine under the hood. It will surprise you.  If your car looks fast and it is fast, there is no shock value to it. If it looks like you drug it out of the junkyard, but it turns in 12 second quarter mile times, you will be shocked. That's the best analogy I can give."

bigdickproblems,3d7qx2,redbirdrising,3,Wed Jul 15 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"I know where you're coming from on this. I'm ethnically/genetically white, but in any case I thought I had a small dick till just a few years ago. I had serious hangups, too, and didn't turn in my V-card until I was about 24.    Relaxation is the best response to this kind of stress.  Like /u/Rekusasu says, just act confident as hell. Fake it till you make it.  Quick ramble on jerking and porn: I've noticed that I have trouble staying hard while masturbating because the act of jerking off really bores me. That's half the reason I watch porn. The other half is that well-made porn is fun and exciting - sometimes I do watch it just for fun and not to get off. I mean, the human body is so beautiful and amazing to watch in motion! But I'm trying to get away from porn again just because I know it's designed to be as addictive as possible, and it can cut into the sex life if the habit is not managed properly. Just like drinking or weed or whatever. I don't see it as a bad or good thing, just something to be conscientious about. On that note, watching porn is like watching the best highlights of the most amazing sports ever played, when what you really want to do is go out and play those sports yourself. It's great fun, you might learn some new things, but what you really want is to play. Honestly, whatever heritage you have, be proud of that. Whatever body you have, give it the best you can and be happy with what you can do with it.  Fuck the haters. Last but most important in my book, you will not get / stay hard if you're not enjoying yourself enough. Which means you are absolutely right that you need to pay more attention to what's going on in the sack, what your partner is doing and enjoying, than what your dick looks like. The sexual style I've developed for this is twofold:     I like being 80% in charge, but  I realize this puts a lot of responsibility on me to make it pleasurable for both of us. So I'm also very, very attentive to the girl's responses, her body language, etc. Sometimes this means I have to take a breather (or she does). No problem - that happens - sex is often a physically demanding activity.    Conclusion: The more your head is wrapped around ""This experience is beautiful, what can I do to make it more beautiful?"" the less you will worry about your dick."

This could offend her even if you can't trust her to be discreet!  (2) If sex went badly from her standpoint, you're going to be seen as defensive and whiny, begging her to cover up your failure.  (3) If sex went well, telling her not to talk about it sounds like a humblebrag invitation to spread the word.  (4) If you're breaking up with her, telling her not to talk is not likely to be well received, like tying a gag over her mouth while throwing her out the door.  (5) If she's breaking up with you, you have no bargaining power to insist that she not talk.  She'll laugh in your face if you do.  Even if she promises not to talk, confiding in her closest friend is not thought of as gossiping.  But the friend she tells is under no obligation to keep details about YOU confidential.  Also: news travels fast.  Bottom line: if your penis is significantly above or below average, her entire social network is going to know."

Found out later she had been 'reporting back' to a friend after every attempt we had at having sex, telling her how it went and asking for advice on how to deal with it. After we broke up, aforementioned friend contacted me and we ended up hooking up. I didn't really mind about it because it wasn't malicious gossip, they were close friends and she just wanted somebody she could talk to about it.  2) Back at school, I was an early developer. Guys in the locker room gossiping (before I knew I was larger than average), ended up spreading it around school, made a lot of jokes behind my back and gave me a nickname I hated, that some friends still call me. Most people have no idea of the origin of the nickname but it's stuck either way. Hated that shit and still do.  3) Girl I'd been dating for about 3 months dumped me (for non-dick related reasons, we just weren't very compatible in the end) and then I found out that apparently she'd been telling her friends I was hung the whole time we'd been together, and even showed them a photo she'd taken of me while we were together (that she'd promised she'd keep to herself). Even went as far as her MOTHER finding out somehow. That was horrible, basically ended up extricating myself from that entire circle.  So yeah, I think it's a matter of respect. I'm comfortable with my body but that doesn't mean I want everybody knowing what I'm packing. When it's just banded around as casual gossip for people to laugh at, it's pretty horrible and I don't get why people do it."

Just like any exercise machine, if you misuse it, it could hurt you, but it's not a given.  There's a redditor who showed his before-and-after pics/videos who apparently had been using a dick pump for a couple of years. His dick is thick as fuck now, pretty much as thick as the tube, and is uniformly thick all along his length. We had a bit of a conversation and he said that his EQ is at an all-time high, and his sex partners love it.  I'll try and dig into the archives and see if I can find out his reddit username."

I liked the feeling.  It was kind of like stretching a muscle in a way, although it's obviously not the same.  The thing is though, these pumps have holes for the air to be sucked out of at the top.  They probably never expected a dick to be able to reach that far.  Mine, however, did and blocked the airflow.  I tried to release the pressure but got no where.  I spent 10 seconds panicking before realizing my dick was plugging it.  As it turns out, most pumps are 7.5"" tall (and advertise themselves as 8.5"") and I'm 8"".

bigdickproblems,3d4xnw,jalabi99,2,Mon Jul 13 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"Pumping is a lot like jelqing in that it should require at least a couple days of research before consideration. If you're interested in pumping, forget about $10 pumps. If the condom discussion on this board has taught anything, it's that nothing penis related is ""one size fits all"". You'll need a 10"" or 11"" cylinder depending if that's your BPL or NPBL and a diameter to allow your 5.5 girth to expand. It's not just a small man's game, several large guys in porn(ie Shane Diesel) are known to commonly pump before scenes. Pumping doesn't just inflate with blood, it's mostly lymphatic fluid; and the more you condition your penis to pumping, the longer the pumped up penis will last. People talking about temporary deformities like the area of tissue beneath the glans remaining puffed up are referring to what happens when you pump with too much pressure. It's called a donut in the pumping community and your goal when pumping is to avoid that. That's why most importantly,  you'll need a pump with a gauge to measure hg(pressure).  Pumping for longer with lower pressure is the only safe way to pump. Between 3-4 hg for no more than 15 minutes at a time. You'll find talks of some doing higher, but they'll have spent years pumping and conditioning their penis. The quickest way to injury is by pumping too hard too early. I personally do 3 rounds of 12 minutes at just over 4hg with a little bit of jelqing in between to get blood and lymph fluid moving around. Pumping gives me a temporary 1/2 inch in length and 1/3 inch in girth. I'm 7.7 BP and 5.6 in girth regularly and the pump lasts for about 12 hours for me, so it's a fun thing to do if you have privacy because it literally takes 4-5 minutes of my time if I'm multitasking. My suggestion is to look into penile exercise message boards(PEGym, Thundersplace, Matterofsize) and read up if you're interested and wouldn't mind dropping at least $70. If you were only interested as a lark, you're better off spending that ten dollars anywhere else because it either won't fit or you'll hurt yourself."

The sensation was pleasurable and it made my dick look rad while inside the pump, but as soon as you remove the pump it's back to a pretty normal erection. I also found that after about three days of once-per-day use, the scar tissue from my circumcision would remain puffed-up long after my erection stopped. This, along with a couple other undesirable (and worrying) aftereffects convinced me not to use it anymore.  In short: it's not going to do anything special to your dick and it might fuck you up. A cockring gives you basically the same effect without the same risks."

bigdickproblems,3d03ug,DBP_21,9,Mon Jul 13 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"In the 90's,  I met Buck Adams while playing Mortal Kombat II at a corner store. Found out he was having a new place built in the hills, so in the mean time, he was living in the same apartment complex I was in Northridge.  Got to know him a bit. He sent me to a ""modeling agency"" in the Woodland Hills / Sherman Oaks area. They took some pics, clothed and unclothed, and a couple closeups where I sat in a binder with a LOT of other guys.  Nothing ever came of that.  But, Buck's place was done, and with a new studio. He also had the idea of getting into the shooting some amateur stuff that was becoming popular at the time, and asked if I wanted to.  So...  I did a couple hours doing a masturbation shoot with a girl, and half a day doing a sex scene with another.  I also got to sit in on a quite few being shot (with other studios too).  The biggest issue was guys blowing their load too early. (Amateurs) The camera crew had to recognize when it was going to happen, and get in close to catch it, and then hope the guy could get hard again soon so they can shoot more.  Experienced girls with new guys was also rough. The guy would be working up a boner, and the girl would say something like ""omg, come on already, I want to go"" , and the guy would instantly go soft."

The big dick is a great qualifier, but stamina is great as well. I actually have trouble cumming, so shoot duration isn't a problem.  You have to learn a lot of crazy, useless positions. Cameras don't capture anything pretty during vanilla sex. You have to make the angles and shots available by doing some pretty stupid maneuvering.  On a side note, working in the adult industry (at least with the folks I've worked with) has made my sex life so much better. That sounds cliche, but you have to have a ton of communication. When you have that kind of communication in the bedroom, it works wonders."

bigdickproblems,3d03ug,almostfamousomg,2,Tue Jul 14 14:02:39 2015 UTC,Dated a couple girls in school who went on to work for some semi-pro sites.

bigdickproblems,3d03ug,almostfamousomg,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"If you film/edit/produce yourself, you can be in the industry if you choose to be.   As far as working for Vivid Entertainment, that takes a lot of time and marketing. I know a couple girls who have worked with them and they always said that they were contacted by the company first.  It isn't really my dream to be that big. I like the privacy that comes with not being known. I did a post a while back on an askreddit thread on how to DIY a porn.  I'll condense it below:  Cameras - 4 or 5 GoPros and tripods. You can have a videographer or two, but keep in mind those are checks that need to be cut.  Props/costume - Is everyone starting naked? Is there a theme to this porn? (pizza delivery, plumber, etc) Is there going to be any toys or restraints? (Dildos, Hitachi vibe, cuffs, etc) These all cost something and can add up. Personally, I'll trash a toy after a shoot. It isn't something I feel comfortable reusing under pretty much any circumstances. As the producer, the performers health is paramount.  Speaking of health.. STI testing is a must if you want to be legitimate in what you're doing. Make sure you have proof that everyone involved it healthy. Also get some proof of age and record that for all performers and all shoots. Keep those records forever.  Food - Have food available. Pizza, a sub platter, something. A 30 min movie takes a while to film. Hint: A lot longer than 30 min. Lunch breaks are a good thing.   Duration - You'll do a lot of editing. Not all moments look good. Not all moments are serious. Be prepared to be boning for a while. Breaking everything up and taking a quick breather every once in a while helps. Just kind of repeat the same action (doggy, bj, 69, anal, etc) for 10-20 min and it'll give more than enough footage to cut it down to a 30 min film.   The fun - There's occasionally bloopers. There's times where you just strike up a casual conversation while going at it. It's easy to get bored and just fuck around and be stupid for a minute.  Obviously this is a very small operation and is just skimming the details. You still need to find women, read up on how 1099 contracting works, local regulations and laws, etc.  A good start to just play around and get used to being on camera is to post some pics over on /r/massivecock or /r/penis. I believe /r/ladybonersgw is another but I'm on mobile atm so don't quote me on that.  Either way, best of luck."

They have to get it up and off on cue essentially and all the while in between maintain [it] for two to three hours. This must be done under the most difficult of circumstances, including not being attracted to their female co-star, having sex in the most uncomfortable settings, i.e. on hard surfaces, cold/hot weather, etc., and/or having to stop frequently for direction or shot setups. They have to be in great shape in order to perform. It all adds up to being the most difficult job in porn, in my opinion."

It's hard to decouple the excitement of sex from the excitement of seeing a big dick. Most of the size-related comments are indirect like ""I can usually deep throat but I can only get this much into my mouth"", which is sad more than anything. Or ""OW OW OW"" if I haven't done my foreplay due diligence.  All the other comments I've heard are after the fact. Some girl yelled out ""STANDARD__DEVIANT I HEARD YOU GOT A BIG DICK"" at a party once. Can't say that helped to get me laid but it was embarrassing. I also get a fair amount of soreness complaints and the occasional ""my vagina was not a gaping hole before I met you.""  Can't say that having a large penis is God's greatest gift.

Are girls surprised by the size, and do you usually go for the non-Asian girls?  While the 3.7"" size frequently mentioned for Koreans having the smallest penis was measuring stretched length, another study measuring erect lengths has the Korean average as 11.88cm = ~ 4.7 in. which is around an inch smaller than the U.S. average. The standard deviation of ~0.5 in is also much lower.  A 7"" dick is more than 4 standard deviations above the mean of 4.7 in, which assuming a normal distribution (yeah I know it doesn't really follow the normal curve) would put a 7"" Korean penis at above 99.99th percentile."

bigdickproblems,3cviyy,fryestone,3,Sat Jul 11 10:23:23 2015 UTC,What is it with American ESL teachers and always going to South Korea?. I get the impression its mostly not really qualified weeaboos who want to be paid an absurd amount in an Asian country and use their Western heritage to get laid(case in point some of the replies in this thread) all whilst 90% of them also go about getting fucking wasted every night till 2am and then go teaching at 8am.   Yes it's a generalisation and not always the case but there's an element of truth to it.
bigdickproblems,3cviyy,drgmi,3,Sun Jul 12 05:10:24 2015 UTC,"What's going on is just a result of economics and racism from both sides. White people are in hot demand in China/Korea. Having Caucasian features deem you instantly beautiful, and many Chinese/Korean girls who have the wherewithal get plastic surgery to look more white.   Heck, Chinese companies pay hundreds of dollars just to ""rent"" white people, and for the ""privilege"" to be seen with them. Korean companies like Samsung exclusively hire foreigners for some positions, and pay a huge premium to the white employees.  And not to mention the dick size! Being 6.5"" might be just above average in the states, but it could make you a highly desirable sex object among the Asian girls who are not only curious about white guys, but those who have been craving a big penis - considering most Asian guys are 4""-5.5"" big and about 4""-4.5"" in girth."

This gives me an opportunity to live a comfortable life style while also being able to travel, it also builds up my resume since I want to become a child psychologist.   Many people I know came here because they were drowning in student loans and needed to pay it off so they came here.   But I do agree, there is a lot of English teachers here that are just here to get laid and party. Which I don't think there's anything wrong with that, most of us are in our 20s."

Also, a quick commentary on penis size: Korea's really good for guys who are slightly above average (i.e. 6-6.5"") in the U.S. - these sizes would be a huge deal to the Korean girls, and would be equivalent to the American goldilocks size of around 7-7.5"".

The stopping of the masturbation is really only because since I have her around it just doesn't interest me. I kinda have a thought that it might be the condoms (magnum) but I've never really had an issue in the past using them. She constantly blows my mind with the qualities about me that she finds incredibly sexy (her words not mine) and she is always really into it and will go on and on about what physical qualities I have drive her nuts. I know she wants me and is super attracted to me so I have no idea why this is being such an issue.. I honestly do know it's in my head but knowing that makes it strange that I can't shake it.

My girth was an issue but the bigger issue was a lack of materials. We were only able to mold about 4.5"" of my dick. :(  The resulting product looked just like my dick (albeit the foreskin didn't move) however due to air bubbles and imperfections in the mold, it is a lot rougher. Also the short length didn't help with our intended activity.  We did but another kit but haven't used it yet.

You can do this with a short length of PVC pipe and a cap for one end. This allows you to get a pipe that is close to your guy's size without being too small. I would recommend that you get one that is about 1"" wider than the width of his dick. That way you have 1/2"" on either side to prevent his dick from hitting the side and making a flat spot.   Then you can buy all the materials from Smooth-on, which is company that makes professional lifecasting materials. Here is a good tutorial about casting a silicone replica of an arm (which is about the same size as some of the guys dicks here lol [I actually think they know people clone their dicks so this is the best they could do without being x-rated]) http://www.smooth-on.com/gallery.php?galleryid=273  You want to buy some body-safe alginate (silica free) like this one http://amzn.com/B007PULSRM You use that to make the mold and then you want to use a platinum cure silicone to make the dildo. I recommend smooth-sil 940 as it is food-safe so it should be safe for penetration: http://amzn.com/B00EOA25X2   You can also find those materials at an art store like Utrecht or Pearl or Dick Blick, if you have one local to you."

Just before going to bed I realised that it was the US contingent who were pissed at me, and I figured putting my measurements down in mm was possibly going to draw more ire.  Oddly enough, I've always used over-the-counter rubber, but never what I consider to be ""specialty"" rubber - even though it's readily available. It's possible that I've been doing it wrong all my life. I never figured that I was slightly above average until my mid 20's when someone made a point of hammering home the information - lasses always say ""it's huge"" as a standard compliment right?

bigdickproblems,3cktp1,Chuff_Nugget,3,Thu Jul 9 06:27:02 2015 UTC,"Hi! I was actually the one who told you about the whole US thing. To be honest, I can get larger sized condoms here where I live, but it's still not just ""nip into a sex-shop and pick up whatever I need"". There are basically two brands who sell actually large condoms (mysize and theyfit) and they're really hard to find here. I have found a supplier by now and know the place where I can buy it in bulk for the cheapest, but still, you know, these condoms cost a lot more than regular ones.  All in all I personally understand that you did not mean no harm, and there is a ton of misinformation about condom sizes, and being a person who needs special sizes, I had to experience it and it's a really tough experience.  Think about it: most people who find out that they need bigger condoms usually do when they are first starting to have sex. They are already stressed out about that, now they have to realize that the whole ""one-size-fits-all"" condom bullshit is wrong. Then the XXL condoms are wrong as well (literally there are like 2-3mms difference in girth in most popular brands' XXL versions).   So there is this tough experience figuring out for the first time how difficult condom sizing is and finding a right size for yourself. It's not easy if you don't fit in the normal, and also it's much more expensive. (they cost around three times as much you'd pay for a brand name condom) So yeah, most people are angry at everyone who spreads these misinformations because they experienced it first hand that it sucks and everyone treats it like they are the douches who just try to show off. (even though your original comment did not imply that, but it was easy to misunderstand it that way)  I hate that this subreddit still brigades sometimes, and when I read your comment I specifically did not want to post about it here, but I just knew someone would do it."

That's all about packaging - uniform shaped fruit/veg can be packed better, and it really reduces spoilage/bruising while effectively increasing transport efficiency.  When it comes to condom sizing... I suspect the FDA's laziness might have a lot to do with it, and BIG rubber is hard to find in some places because there's a limited amount of potential customers, and they have expiry dates - its a financial loss waiting to happen for retailers.

It may be difficult, but there condoms for any size dongle. I beg for a reason, relating to size, not to wear a condom that fits.  But we also have people who think that because a condom can stretch over their leg, there is no excuse not to wear a condom. The people can be generally classified as bloody fucking ignorant. Some people reply to these statements with claims about comfort, which is a valid reason. If you're not comfortable, you can't get off. But the real reason is fit.  If a condom is too big for the wang: the condom can leak, tear, or slip off.  If a cock is too be for the condom: the condom can leak, break, slip off, tear, damage the penis, or dry out (which has other complications).

bigdickproblems,3ck5ba,JohnSherlockHolmes,5,Wed Jul 8 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"The most common position for full penetration with my wife and I is modified missionary with her legs up and around my rump. I put both hands down her back and grab her butt. I put my weight on my shoulders, on either side of her shoulders and lift her butt up with my hands. This let's me spread her butt cheeks so my balls slap her asshole. It's like a really big bear hug where I'm grabbing her ass and lying on top of her.  All in all its very similar to legs up missionary with a pillow under her hips but my hands serve as the pillow. This is one of the few positions where I can go balls deep easily. Her knees up rotates her hips and my hands holding her ass off the bed lifts her hips. Makes getting into the anterior fornex really easy.  The best position for lazy sex is spooning. Only I move further back so we are closer to doggy style but lying on our sides. I move my hips up onto her ass cheeks so my dick is pointing downward slightly and so her butt cheeks take up more space between us. I then also grab my balls and pull them back between my thighs. This pulls my dick down and away. All in all this let's me slam as hard I want with out using most of my dick. I still get that hip slapping feeling and the head of my dick is moving from rubbing her entrance to g spot. Its a good way to have sex with only about 4 -5 inches of my dick."

Depends on your setup. Cowgirl can work if you're super careful, but takes a lot of prep and the girl has to have strong leg muscles (squats rather than sitting). Side-fucking, cuddle-fucking, spoon-fucking, whatever you wanna call it are typically a pretty good position, since neither party is disadvantaged by gravity.

From there you get all the benefits and fun from doggy style, but he can't QUITE reach all the way in to hurt you, and it's easier for you to squeeze and tighten your vagina with keigels or whatever while fucking because you're not worried about holding yourself up with your hands or knees."

bigdickproblems,3clehy,LipsNailsSex,4,Thu Jul 9 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"The cervix is not the end of the vagina. There are special positions you can use and you can bottom out. It needs time and provides an amazing combination of pleasure and pain for both.   Anal is... An interesting experience. It needs lots of training, time and patience to get a big dick all inside, and some  alcohol always helps. After a certain length it kinda bottoms in (for us is a bit over his half length), and you have to use slow and deep thrusts in order to go deeper, slow is the key here along with lots of lube. I personally enjoy the getting slowly out and then slowly back in while I push against him and he against me. Once you pass this part and you're completely relaxed and hot you can start going wild slowly slowly again. The feeling is... Bloody amazing. There are not enough words in the world to describe it. It's hot, it's sexy, it's amazing and it makes me orgasm like crazy, lots of pillows have been bitten and lots of sheets have been destroyed. We can usually do it in two positions that allow it, both of which give me limited mobility due to the body crashing orgasms, especially when coupled with me fisting myself, the whole feeling of being full and feeling his cock all deep inside, it's mind-blowing. So. What it happens, when it happens, it's crazy orgasms for me and an equal crazy orgasm for him.   Aftercare is another discussion :p"

Our favourite is me being sideways, legs at 90 degrees, one straight down, one spread and straight (if you don't keep it straight or put it sideways/up to your boobs it doesn't allow deep penetration) while he's kneeling and going wild. After a bit I usually end up all twisted with my ass sideways, against the bedboard while he's leaning on my free leg/grabbing the headboard pumping away. Something like butterfly/scissor combination. Another good one is my ass up, legs spread as much like a frog I suppose, waist and face down, lots of pillows around, and once he bottoms in, he slowly closes my legs without getting out and I'm with my legs close, almost flat except of my ass that I stick up/arch. Again against the headboard. In these two positions he can get balls deep inside, and with every single move I feel mind-blowing pain and pleasure and cum like there's no tomorrow. Some times it's so pleasurable and painful I'm one step before fainting. Every body is different so these two might not work for you, I'm also not the best describer. 😂"

I think /r/tall did a survey on it and the result was that they were around 0.25-0.75"" longer than average IIRC. Keep in mind that might be because it was self reported, and people like to be a little generous with themselves, even if it's online and anonymous.

For context, the average person on /r/tall claims to be 6'4.  The average height in the studies the best research on penis size was done in was around... 5'7-5'8?  Those studies found a correlation between height and penis size of about 1mm on penis size per 1 inch in height, which is not quite perportional, and I can't remember if it was statistically significant.  What that means is you need a foot in height for even half an inch in extra penis size.    Now getting back to my point, /r/tall said their median penis size was 7.1"", and the mean was higher, which is an exaggeration of at least 1-1/2 inches.  For reference, the mean size HERE is 7.5"" according to flairs, and we specifically attract larger then average people.

Still looking for one who can properly 'accommodate' me, so to speak.  Back at university I got with this black girl who had only been with black guys before me. She obviously wasn't expecting much from me, because she freaked the fuck out the first time she whipped off my pants (she actually ran out of the room and I had to go get her). It wasn't just difficult in terms of actually fitting, but because she just wasn't really into bigger guys it was harder for her to get 'in the mood', she was just continually nervous about taking me. Tried a few times, never really worked, the whole thing ended pretty much before it started because she just wanted an average meatstick.  The most success we ever had was a few times with me lying on my back with my dick lying flat against my stomach, and her sitting on me rubbing up and down the underside of my shaft. It felt great, we both came, but in the end we basically couldn't do penetrative sex.  It's also a really horrible feeling when you're having sex with a girl and you can tell it's hurting her, but she's trooping on because she doesn't want to disappoint. I feel terrible that I'm hurting somebody when what I'm doing is supposed to be having the complete opposite effect, she feels terrible because she feels like she's letting me down."

If you have a mild headache, drink half a cup of water, if you're thirsty drink a cup of water. It's probably better to eat some vegetables, or a bit of fruit, but water isn't a bad idea either.

When your kidneys are unable to excrete the excess water, the electrolyte (mineral) content of the blood is diluted, resulting in low sodium levels in the blood, a condition called hyponatremia. Endurance athletes, such as marathon runners who drink large amounts of water, are at higher risk of hyponatremia.

This is because the curve makes it kind of spring-loaded whenever you try to straighten it. So when it's inside a vagina, it wants to curve, but can't. So the bottom tip and top base apply alot of force outwards trying to curve. This makes a curved penis feel much thicker than a straight one.   The only downside is that it looks smaller than it is. But that makes it better when women are surprised by how big it feels inside them.   Sorry if this comment is too much, but I don't think most people realize this about curved dicks."

bigdickproblems,3cd1mj,BadnewzSHO,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:27:10 2015 UTC,"It tilts UP about 30 degrees with SLIGHT twist up and to the left, JUST the tiniest bit.   I always wished it pointed straight out, and honestly, I think I lessened the curve a bit by intentionally pushing it downward instead of upward down my boxers when I went to bed. It looks a bit longer but I don't recommend doing this really, I just had been pressing against my tunica for a long time and flexing my kegels before I knew what they were.  The negatives are: It can hurt particularly when the boner first comes on and hasn't accepted it's proud stature being pushed downward and isn't always the most flexible. And good god is it hard to hide even the slightest boner/chub when its pointing down my pant leg, all the blood goes to my head and my head pops up first with the curve like HELLO, did you notice how long I am? Also, the curve makes the actual length not seem as immediately impressive as if it was truly straight as an arrow.  Pros: It looks cool. 2nd, It's one of those features that a girl has audibly exclaimed, YES! when I told her about, to the point that it surprised me as she already knew about my size, so I really didn't expect that to really be a big deal.   Finally, the upward curve puts extra pressure right on her clit."

bigdickproblems,3cbdts,RaineBearNW,5,Tue Jul 7 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"There is a little bit of misinformation here, the number of veins doesn't directly correlate with size and the need for blood flow. The veins don't bring blood in, they let the blood back out. So the need for more veins would be due to the amount of blood that gets trapped in the chambers of the penis, not how much blood it needs. I wouldn't be surprised if there was no correlation between size and how veiny it is, but there could be. The more blood that goes in means there is more blood that needs to drain back out. But based on how the penis and erections work, more veins isn't really necessary for proper function unless the penis is really big, it would just take longer for all the blood to drain after an erection."

I've being practicing martial arts for a while now and I guess I might know some things..  The more big is the penis.. the more resources it consumes to function.. for example.. if you have 10""+ such as in your case but let say a weak CARDIO system .. then you'll ended up with a weak and a never ROCK HARD erection..  Therefore your body develop more wide and strong veins to feed that body part via blood pumping and other things.. for example in my case I've 5"".5x5"" I have just one visible vein on the top.. but I think the more girth the more veins and your body can develop veins as needed.  Hope this helps  UPDATE: As far as I know (Cause I'm heavily invested into the Cardio thing I have black belt 3rd degree in Taekwondo and I need a lot of cardio to manage).. if you get a healthy and powerful horse like cardio.. then your body will create less veins around your gentle and will simply pumps them wider when needed.. but if your cardio system is weak and not capable enough to feed that body part because it's excessively demanding (bc of its size) then it will simply create more veins for more simultaneous delivery via normal pumping power.. you guessed it.. if your heart is very powerful at pumping the blood then it won't need too many veins to feed your big gentle.. in the other hand it creates more veins to replace the lack of strong pumping.  If you want less veins get a powerful cardio system."
bigdickproblems,3cbdts,cb666,3,Mon Jul 6 16:31:23 2015 UTC,"As you perform more exercise in general there will be an increase in the number of blood vessels you have along with their size. This is why you find body builders or weight lifters with more prominent veins along their bodies. This happens because the oxygen supply needs to be more efficient due to the new muscles or the anticipated larger use of those muscles.   I'm not entirely sure on what you mentioned in your update but most of what you said previous to that is right, the reason I'm not sure about what you said about cardio reducing the amount of veins is that any exercise should affect your cardiovascular system. Doing cardio specifically shouldn't make you have less veins at all.  The more regular exercise you perform the more effect you will see on your veins (larger and more). If you stop then the body will begin downsizing or shutting down the excess capillaries it created and your veins will get smaller since they don't need to handle all the oxygen carrying or the lactic acid/carbon dioxide removal it would be doing during all the exercise.   EDIT: Oh and I happen to have 4 large visible veins in my dick, two split off into smaller ones. I've noticed they are a bit more prominent since I began doing my bodyweight workout 3 times of the week."

(It was also the first time I ever attempted a blowjob.) I fucked up by being so nervous and shy and he never asked me for it again. But I never stopped thinking about it. He has the most beautiful dick I've ever seen. It's long and so thick and it just looks perfect. Handsome guy, handsome dick. I have dreams of sucking him constantly and today I finally took the plunge and it felt like my heart was gonna bust out of my chest. I got clammy and nervous but I got over myself and I did it. I guess I was worried that because I sucked the first time he wasn't going to want me to do it again. I had read this post and was really inspired and motivated. God. It was so hot I got to kiss him and lick him and taste him and really enjoyed it but I'm a little frustrated because I could only get about 1/3 of him in my mouth. I tried to make up for it by kissing and licking from top to bottom but I want to do more for him. It's so hot to hear him moan and to feel him move in trying to get more. I loved it so hard. I know he liked it because he looked at me just so and then kissed the fuck out of me. I know I sound stupid but I didn't know if he would kiss me after or if it's gross or not supposed to after you blow someone. Also my mouth waters when I think about his dick every single time but there didn't seem to be enough saliva in my mouth to go around. How do I make more? Any tips or tricks?"

I am a natural with blow jobs though, first time I did it he was done in under 10 mins and sweared on his life that it was the best blowjob he ever got. Kept asking me if I had done it before, he of course could have just been making me feel better about but it did seem genuine. Every guy since then has agreed with him though.  Some extra tips I have to make the experience more delightful, if you realise you can't deepthroat him fully then try to make up with your tongue. Especially around the head, and try to make eye contact while sucking him. Looks great to them while you have a mouth full of cock. A little moaning like Ottersuit said is great. Also try to suck on one of his balls, it feels pretty great.  Edit: Like RampageRhino56 said it's a good idea to ask if they like their balls being played with or sucked like I said before you do it, haven't found a guy that hasn't liked it yet though."

I know a lot of guys who've I've heard from their girlfriends (I'm that guy who makes boyfriends uncomfortable because is really close friends with girls because they remind him of the bond he has with his sisters) had small penises and they loved the shit outta these guys and came back many a time just to sleep with them when they did break up. Therefore, clearly penis size is not all that.   Finally, I grew more when I was about 19, and I grew a little bit more once between 23 and 24 (my current age) If every woman only dated guys with above average dicks, there would be more single women than there already are. Personally, I made a girl cum just by making out with her, don't focus too much on the mathematics of sex, making her feel amazing by being passionate as fuck and showing her how much you love her body, caressing the shit outta her and making her feel overwhelmed with your presence does more than your dick.  And don't worry, even us big guys worry and know on some level there has to be another guy bigger than us somewhere and may have hit it first, har har. It's one of those things you gotta push outta your mind and forget about kind of like the fact that you'll die one day. So no point living worrying about always being second best. Girls date guys that are better looking than you and uglier than you, taller than you and likely shorter than you, guys that make more money and guys that make less. Nothing is so specific and if the woman you meet IS that specific, she very likely has a mental issue that would prevent a good relationship anyway, just as any guy who refused to date a girl with less than double d's would be seen as retarded, so to are the girls who try to quantify people. The only broad i've met like that is 35 years old and still single."

The current generation probably feels more open and comfortable texting and sexting about such things but it was different for me growing up.  When I was younger, I didn't know I was that big. Especially because I'm a grower.  When I was with girls, some would say I was big, but I thought they were just being nice.  During sex some girls couldn't take it all, but I thought they were the problem, not me. Some could take it all unless I really slammed them hard against the floor or something that didn't have any 'give'.  I found out later, much later (like 10 year class reunion later), that I had a reputation in H.S. for having a BD. Girls broke up with me because the sex hurt. (Of course all I knew how to do back then was to jam it in as far as I could and jackhammer away because that's what I thought girls liked.)   Girls would get with me at parties, make out with me, get me hard, pull out my dick,  and then not do anything with it just because they wanted to see it.  All this came as kind of a shock to me, but also kind of made sense when I thought about it.  I've had some ""wow!""s, some ""You've got a nice/big dick""s but most haven't said all that much to me.

I'm six inches, but after a week I was able to get my head in my mouth. It's definitely a unique feeling, but it wasn't worth it so I haven't tried it since. A side note: after this, my mom asked something along the lines of, ""Hey are you getting taller still?"" which leads me to believe the preparations I did had an effect on my stature. That question helped me decide to stop doing it."

I can get the head in my mouth without preparation, but I've learned that if I take a hot shower and stretch my back beforehand, I can take about half of it in my mouth without discomfort.  My experience with it is a little different than most, it seems. Knowing that it has a reputation for being illicit actually makes it exciting to me. It turns me on to know that I can do this, and I've grown to really enjoy the way it feels in my mouth. I'll also admit that I like the taste of my precum; and in the heat of the moment it's even a little thrilling to know that I taste as good as I do.  Cumming inside my mouth is a double edged sword and I only do it sometimes. On the one hand, it's a convenient way to clean up a mess. On the other hand, it requires committing fully to swallowing what's in my mouth even after the orgasm is over"

You wouldn’t buy a dog that bites you all the time. And you wouldn’t be friends with someone who regularly ditches you. You wouldn’t work a job that doesn’t pay you. Then why the hell are you trying to make a girlfriend out of a woman who doesn’t want to date you? Where’s your self-respect?  The entrepreneur Derek Sivers once wrote a blog post where he said, “If I’m not saying ‘Hell Yeah!’ to something, then I say no.” It served him well in the business world and now I’d like to apply it to the dating world. And because I’m more of a vulgar asshole than Derek is, I’ll christen mine The Law of 'Fuck Yes or No.'  The Law of “Fuck Yes or No” states that when you want to get involved with someone new, in whatever capacity, they must inspire you to say “Fuck Yes” in order for you to proceed with them.  The Law of “Fuck Yes or No” also states that when you want to get involved with someone new, in whatever capacity, THEY must respond with a “Fuck Yes” in order for you to proceed with them.  ...The Law of “Fuck Yes or No” is applicable to dating, sex, relationships, even friendships. You may have absolutely nothing in common with that bartender. But they’re hot and are interested in getting down. Is it a “Fuck Yes!” for sex? It is? Then game on.  Wrapped up in that sweet guy who treats you so well, except goes weeks without calling you and suddenly disappears after a couple drinks and a round of the horizontal polka? Been wondering if he really likes you? Do his excuses of being so busy all the time seem legit? It doesn’t sound like the answer is a “Fuck yes.” Then it’s time to move on.  Making out with a girl at your house and every time you go to take her shirt off she swats your hands away? That is not a “Fuck Yes,” my friend, therefore, it’s a no and you shouldn’t pressure her. The best sex is “Fuck Yes” sex — i.e., both people are shouting “Fuck Yes” as they hop between the sheets together. If she’s not hopping, then there’s no fucking...""  -- from ""Fuck Yes or No"" by Mark Manson"

bigdickproblems,3bzd3i,Fatgreyclouds,7,Fri Jul 3 11:54:15 2015 UTC,"It sounds like she's a squirter. Though I really hate that term.   It's exactly how I felt before I met my husband. I never let myself come with guys before him. It's a trust issue. Plus the whole thinking you're going to actually pee thing. It's a pretty freaky feeling until you're used to it.  You can't force it. She has to get comfortable enough with you and that means working on the relationship, even if you stay FWB."

bigdickproblems,3bzd3i,TheMarxistMarksman,4,Sat Jul 4 22:54:43 2015 UTC,"I know how she feels. The thing is, female ejaculate collects in the bladder, so it makes you really feel like you need to pee. Add to that someone with a huge dick poking you right in the bladder, and it's a bit uncomfortable.   What I do is a two part system:  a) she shouldn't drink water before sex (it increases the volume of ejaculate)   b) just have her get up in the middle of sex, go pee, THEN COME BACK TO THE SEX. Problem solved.   It's a bit annoying having to stop, but it's worth it to be able to get off without feeling like you have to pee. She probably can orgasm without ejaculating, but she needs to empty her bladder first.   Since she lives at home, I'd suggest you guys fucking while she's dressed and wearing a skirt, that way she can get up and go to the bathroom without having to stop and get dressed. You could make it a kink thing, if that's more palatable. ""Get up, go to the bathroom, then bring your sexy ass straight back here""."

bigdickproblems,3bzd3i,Fumetsu-Ai,3,Sat Jul 4 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"I've been with quite a few girls that could do it. Most of them, I was the first guy that made them do it. I love it when a girl squirts, so I have gotten pretty good at it.  The trick is that women have to be really relaxed and comfortable, though that's true for any orgasm. But it matters more so with squirting I believe. Cause it is embarrassing, and far different than a typical orgasm, and most girls haven't done it yet so they don't know what's happening.  If you are doing it right, they feel a build up of pressure in their bladder. The G-spot makes the bladder fill up with liquid, not urine, but some liquid. So girls will feel like they need to urinate, it's the exact same sensation in the brain. Inexperienced girls won't know this, they will probably freak out and try to go to the bathroom cause it is distracting. It's really hard to relax and stay comfortable with the nagging full bladder sensation. Most inexperienced women will try as hard as they can to stop you before they orgasm. The last thing they want is to pee on you, that's embarrassing and disgusting.  All you can do is comfort them and try to relax them. Tell them it's ok and that she's about to orgasm (try not to mention squirt, most women are freaked out by that word). She'll say she feels like she has to pee, tell her to just relax and let it happen. Release the pressure. Let it happen. Just like with a typical orgasm, let it build up and release. It takes alot of trust in her part, she will be greatly rewarded, but she doesn't know that.   If she does it, do not freak out. Tell her how hot it was or how much you liked it or how much you want to do again. Nothing negative. The more you do it, the better she'll get at recognizing it and controlling it, you will too of course.   Here is a great video to help you. Though I don't use oil or go as rough. I find more success just milking the female prostate than just finger blasting it, which can be painful for most girls.   Edit: if you aren't fingering her but doing it through penetration, apply pressure to her pelvis. That's the other side of the G-spot. That'll help alot"

bigdickproblems,3bzd3i,BadinBoarder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"Well OK. When it comes to male cum, for instance, most people really overestimate how much there is: your average is two teaspoons, which sounds like nothing, but it looks a lot more when it's spraying everywhere. So I'm sure your girl squirted a lot of liquid, but I'll reserve the right to a little skepticism. ;)"

Although I'm pretty sure a couple times it was pee.   Anyway after that I was with a girl who wasn't very experienced. For like the first ten times we had sex she would always say that it felt like she had to pee and would make us stop. Eventually she came to realize that she was about to orgasm, not pee. Now she has many orgasms and all is well.   My advice is to get your girl to go pee before you have sex. And explain to her that if she just emptied her bladder then it's really not likely that she's gonna be able to pee during sex. Try and get her to relax and not ""hold it in""."

After reading all the comments and your replies, it looks like you're missing an obvious point: you need to start by giving her an orgasm without having sex.  That means you do not  put your penis inside her. Don't put anything inside her. Maybe your fingers, just a little. Try getting her off via pure clit stimulation, and see where that gets you.  The reason she feels the need to pee is because there's fluid building up behind her g-spot (which is the fluid she'll ejaculate when she squirts). You can help reduce that pressure simply by not stimulating her g-spot, which means no penetration. Just use your tongue.  As a squirter myself, she may still feel the urge to pee, but it wont be nearly as bad if you don't penetrate her. Just try oral."

Yes you fill us up more, but I know for me clit stimulation is how I cum so I also use a toy and he loves holding me and watching me cum that way.  I used to feel like your partner and actually think I stopped my first PIV orgasm because I felt like I was going to pee myself. I learnt via toys and masturbation to work through the feeling that I was going to pee myself, to just relax and ride the wave and boy was it worth it.

I think she's just really afraid about it being pee, we've talked about it amd ive told her that she should relax and just 'ride the wave' but every time it seems she'll get to the brink of cumming and then she'll just jump off and run for the toilet."

If it happens with clit orgasms as well then its probably just an overcoming the first time sort of thing. If only internal, she may be a squirter. If you know how to make a girl squirt with your hands then its probably best to start there. Its harder and often takes longer to make a girl squirt with your dick meaning there is more time for her to start worrying. Talk about it, and not just in the middle of sex, let her know that you want her to do it cos it will feel so amazing for her. Communication is so important whatever circumstance."

As for the communication: we're FWB now but shes also my ex and we have a long history together, we communicate with each well... mainly I think shes jist afraid because she thinks it actually is pee, which is what she thinks it is."

Get her to orgasm once that way and other ways may be me simpler.  If she's self conscious about coming, that alone can be enough to prevent orgasm.  If she's still afraid of peeing herself, do it in the tub or over the toilet, hell get her a toy and have her do it herself.  No woman should live without orgasming for so long"
bigdickproblems,3bzd3i,Agamemnon323,3,Fri Jul 3 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"Teasing is just a word and so we all have a different image in our head as to what is actually going on; what I  meant when i said teasing: usually we srart off kissing normally and the  it gets more passionate and she'll either get on top or closer to me, the  while I'm kissing her I'll lightly run my hands around her body (usually the back or sides of legs) then I'll kiss all the way from her cheek to her neck and stay there for a while (still with the hands) then I'll start to kiss from her neck all the way down to her bellybutton  (not tits yet, so kiss between them on the way down) and while down there can either stay kissing arohnd the bellybutton or sometimes even go abit lower (just above the pants at most) and then run my hands up her body to her tits and play with them a little, then start kissing all the way up to one of her boobs and kiss it while still playing with it then I start to suck it ajd at this point my hands are used to rub her legs and the  transition to the inside of her thigh and keep doing that each time getting closer and closer to her pussy (but never too close) and then at one point I actually do and on my way down her inner-thigh I extend the stroke and just ru  my fingers through her pants just lightly rubbing over her pussy and then back up the thigh and repeating that for a little while untill eventually I just stop at her pussy (meanwhile this whole time still playing with her boobs) and start to rub the outside for a little while without going in, then after a while I work a finger in and the  another and I rub the inside in various ways at random, while doing that I'll start kissing her for a little while  (lips) and then get her to take her underwear off while we're kissing. Then I'll start kissing down her body to her pussy and when I'm there (still fingering) I'll lick her clit amd then just in general play with her pussy... eventually she tells me to stop and to put my dick in and the sex starts. but the basic thing about teasing is jist being plauful and mess around. Mix it up and play around and have FUN then FUCK, that was just an explanation but any of those thing can be done however you want.  Tl;dr - Holy shit that wall of text is so big donald trump wants to put it around mexico. But basically to explain I had to go into detail.

I know big dicked friends who are extremely loyal, and small dicked friends who cheat at every opportunity. But in general, I wouldn't be surprised if the temptation is higher for the big dicked guy.  After a while, the novelty factor of a big dick might wear off, and the big dicked guy might want the thrill and exhilaration of a new girl experiencing a big dick for the first time. Meanwhile, for a small dicked guy, he might have to face tough rejections in the bedroom due to his size before he finds the right girl. So a small dicked guy would be less likely to want to venture out and cheat - even fearful in some cases to do so."
bigdickproblems,3c3nuf,biggestdp,9,Sat Jul 4 18:36:54 2015 UTC,I agree   The novelty wears off when your gal stops commenting and taking the rarity of your gift for granted.  Leads to greater temptation for those of us who get off on that first impression.

But what she was really pointing out was my *confidence and security with my body, because honestly, with most mens Ill fitting clothes, very constricting underwear, and compression gear, you'd barely be able to tell if someone was packing. So I think most women have more of a focused eye on how you carry yourself as opposed to how well endowed you are.

I wonder if there is a second-order effect, where the girlfriend of the BD guy either tires of the BD and reserves her affection and commitment, or subconsciously gives off signals that she wouldn't be surprised if he cheated setting up the conditions for a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And statistically, the more temptation, the more cheating.  If that's true (and maybe it is), then tall guys are more likely to cheat than short guys.  Fit guys are more likely to cheat than obese guys.  And so on.  Not because tall, fit, handsome, well-hung guys have any special character flaw, but because they need more self-discipline to remain faithful in a monogamous relationship.  Or from the other side, relatively unattractive and unconfident guys are more likely to stay faithful, not because they are better people, but because they don't have to deal with much temptation."

bigdickproblems,3bvbua,biggestdp,3,Thu Jul 2 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. There's a big reason why so many girls ""in the know"" prefer girth over length. Short and thick can get the job done for most girls. Girth is correlated with length, so people conflate them when saying that size matters. It would be more accurate to say that girth matters.   7.5x4.5 might be visually huge and impressive, but it is no surprise that he has trouble making girls cum. IMO, the magic girth number seems to be around 5.25"". Also, in terms of penile volume, 6.5x5.5 is 20% bigger than 7.5x4.5."

True friendship"
bigdickproblems,3bvbua,DuncanMonroe,2,Sat Jul 4 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I should post here or make its own thread but after a long stint of unemployment in a new city, my only friends here having moved back home, I was quite lacking in confidence and my social skills were more than a little rusty. The last time I was in bed with a girl was sadly months before I got the job, and it just ended in sexual frustration when her friend was not willing to participate in a three way due to having a crush on me and jealousy, etc.   Long story short, the girls at my new retail job began light flirting immediately after I started, being three cougars and one around my age who was very much a sex kitten always being a pretend innocent cocktease (and the only cougar that didn't openly flirt and acted kind of stand-offish, well, i'll get back to her), I guess just because they thought I was cute, however I was too rusty to really take it anywhere and too broke to offer to do anything. My job requires that I wear slacks and khakis, and i'm a skinny dude and about average height and my dick is a shower hanging around 5"" flaccid and oddly thick, so naturally my dick isn't all that hidden even though I do my best. I had up to this point thought most women could not identify a penis from a pant wrinkle (and I guess most of them really can't) so I felt pretty hidden. I'm relatively shy, and not much of a flirt past being able to smile with my eyes, make dumb jokes, and seem mysterious (aka a brooding nerd with oddly intense eyes).  Anyway, one day while setting down some boxes with said sex kitten co-worker, we got the shift to work alone together but were too occupied with our job to really do anything besides let her cock tease me. I got the tiniiiiiest bit of a chubby if that, and when I walked out with her to set down some boxes for a customer... the sheer impact of me taking a knee caused my dong to jostle loose from its position and bounce down my pant leg very obviously. All I saw was her eyes widen and her mouth agape as a coy smile worked over her face in an instant and she immediatley covered her mouth to keep from giggling and walked off to get on her phone and I knew it was all over, every girl in our department was going to get a text about this. The next month that followed involved the most blatant flirtation, overt sexual teasing (think that girl with the amazing ass at work twerking for you just to see you get a chubby and then some), girls asking me for numbers, grabbing my arm, just all over me, most amazingly, the tough ass, hot ass Latina milf (she's like 29 or 30, not really a full blown cougar) who normally would sometimes just not even say hi or ignore me, when bumping into me each day would greet me by giving me the fuck me eyes, glancing down from my eyes to my bulge and back while licking her lips.   Not only was my confidence restored, I was drowning in attention. It was more than a little overwhelming for an anxious nerd who had barely got out of the house in months.   So, as much as I am against bragging. I also think it's really bad for us to be so fucking negative, there's so much hate for guys with big dicks on the internet and often times in real life. It's like a different form of white guilt. Other people feel good about being tall, buff, rich, smart, whatever, I think we're allowed to feel good about our dicks, eh?"

I assume the pushing you mean is pushing your dick down or pushing the measuring tape into the bone on the side which are both incorrect. if you penis hangs down you need to measure it holding it up. angling your dong down adds to the measurement wrongly. sorry if you lost some length you thought you had but lying to yourself isn't better.
bigdickproblems,3butz9,throw5545,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:03:52 2015 UTC,"Both your penis and the ruler should be parallel to the floor when standing and the ruler should be laying directly on top of your penis, not to the side of it or anything. Like this: http://www.penissizes.org/sites/default/files/penissize/measuring-penis-size.gif  You should push the ruler in till it hits your pubic bone, because that is the standard for total length (bone pressed). Just having your ruler hit skin is your non-bone pressed length or your visible length. Depending on your weight, you might have more or less fat in front of your pubic bone that does compress some during sex, which is why you should take both measurements.   If you have a pretty severe curve to your penis, you can use a cloth measuring tape to get an accurate length measurement. Just make sure you press the end in tight at the base of your cock and pull the measuring tape taut so you again get a accurate length."

It found:  -- Average flaccid penis length was 3.6 inches, or 9.16 centimeters. Standard deviation was 0.62 inches or 1.57 centimeters.  -- Average length of a stretched flaccid penis was 5.21 inches, or 13.24 centimeters. SD was 0.74 inches or 1.89 centimeters.  -- Average erect penis length was 5.17 inches, or 13.12 centimeters. SD was 0.65 inches or 1.66 centimeters.  As for diameter, the average flaccid circumference was 3.67 inches or 9.31 centimeters. SD was 0.35 inches or 0.9 centimeters.  Average erect circumference was 4.59 inches or 11.66 centimeters.

bigdickproblems,3bswyc,Readtoo,9,Wed Jul 1 22:13:27 2015 UTC,"There is, however, a very high correlation between stretched flaccid and erect lengths.  Whether it is stretched from the outside (stretched flaccid) or by blood pressure from the inside (erect), the penis will end up at almost exactly the same length.  Stretched flaccid is used as a testing method because it eliminates the variables of a natural erecting and the risks of a chemically induced erection.  The worldwide average length when naturally erect may be off slightly from the stretched flaccid length in the metastudy, but with their sample size it will be within a few percentage points."

If the standard deviation is 2 inch, that means that most men who are not average (either above or below) are probably 3 inches or 7 inches in length. Either way, there is a 2 inch difference with regards to the mean. When you say one standard deviation from the mean, that means there is a 2 inch difference from the mean and the specific cock you are measuring.

Like, I know a penis stretching the vagina is a myth and some say the perceived 'looseness' is because you are more relaxed around your regular partner, but I dunno.   Then again I also didn't see him for like two weeks and it was pretty difficult getting him in, but once he was in it was like I hadn't been gone at all."

Definitely, I usually feel like someone punched me in the stomach/belly, and like I'm all wide open, while I'm tight as before. It feels a bit like after a pap test, although more comfortable. Especially if we haven't had sex for a while. The longest we've gone was two weeks, and it took me 3 full days to not feel sore/uncomfortable after that crazy weekend."

And my god she was not kidding. Took all of it. No problem. Still made her gag once though. its the little things  My longest term ex girlfriend had ZERO gag reflex, but her pallet was just too narrow. It was like hitting the cervix, but in her mouth. She could never go deeper and more often than not that's just the case.  Point is, it's highly unrealistic to expect anyone to deep throat you let alone give you a decent blowjob.

If you're thicker than her throat, you're still screwed. The thickest I've had barely fit - he completely cut off my air way. I could take it all in, but I can only hold my breath for so long. I had to learn to take quick breaths when I could. Something you could try (if you haven't already) is to have your girl keep her hand against her mouth while giving head, so you get like a mouth/hand job combo. Probably not the same sensation but at least more of your shaft would be getting attention. The guy I mentioned above seemed to enjoy that, at least."

She went from getting like 2"", to around 6.5"" now.  I wouldn't doubt if she could get the whole thing pretty soon.  She's a real trooper.  Honestly, moreso than deepthroating, the hottest part of a BJ is when the girl is happy to do it and takes pride in it.  She takes a lot of pride in her ""work"" and it really makes what she does so much hotter.  Enthusiasm and eye contact.  Just don't stare him down, break eye contact now and again."

Any other tricks? My gag reflex is too good to the point I sometimes gag myself when I'm brushing my teeth. :[   happy to do it and takes pride in it   Oh believe me, it is absolutely one of my favorite things to do to my guy, which is why I get worried that my head game is lacking when I focus on deepthroating or when he's too big."

Bring the camera so it's just close enough to your dick that the whole thing is in the screen. Taking a picture from below your junk pointing up will always make it look huge even if it's average. Bonus points for this angle if you angle your wang towards the camera and make it fill the screen entirely.  The angle you take photos at is key.

bigdickproblems,3bh3ca,BDPaltacct,3,Tue Jun 30 00:41:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on the woman, her level of arousal, and how deep something has been during that sex session.   Different women have different ""maximum depths"", in my experience, ranging from about 6-8.5 inches. Nothing will ever go deeper because no matter how aroused she is, she can't get deeper.  The more aroused a woman is, the more she will be willing to take. If she starts, unaroused, about 4 inches deep, then arousing her and putting 5 inches in will move the relevant spot to about 5 inches deep. Putting 6 inches in will move it to about 6 inches in, and so on, until you reach the maximum she can do.  This is why I reassure guys on here that if I can give a girl that deep, cul de sac orgasm using only a little more than half of my penis, then penis length doesn't matter much for the cul de sac once you reach about 5 or 5.5"" in length.

Ive read many posts by women who confirm that squirting is rarely associated with orgasm.  This leads me to the second question since you have experience with squirting orgasms: i sport a long skinny peen (6.5"" x 4.8"") and have had an experience with a partner who used to get really wet and squirt A LOT, HOWEVER, i rarely felt she had actually orgasms (i.e. strong quivering, screaming and the like). Do you think the excessive amount of wetness and subsequent squirting is a sign of orgasm?"
bigdickproblems,3bkvme,bigdickaltaccount,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:55:54 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that all ""squirting"" amounts to is a strong musculature contraction that also contacts the bladder, resulting in urine being expelled. When a woman gets very excited, the vagina begins to produce a fluid that can be anything from thin and clear, to thick and white, depending on the woman.   Sometimes there is a lot of it, and it can be expelled from the vagina by fingers,a cock, or just gravity. It does not come out of the urethral opening, but the vaginal canal. Most of the squirting you see in porn is just woman peeing.  Orgasm can absolutely coincide with copious amounts of girl cum being produced.  The incident that I referenced earlier, the girl had a super strong orgasm and her whole body seemed to seize and convulse, resulting in a squirt of fluid that I can only assume was urine, hitting the floor and wall. She had no idea what had happened, and neither did I. It was hot though."

bigdickproblems,3bkvme,bigdickaltaccount,5,Tue Jun 30 03:02:27 2015 UTC,"I cannot relate to having a thin penis but I can relate to having a lot of sex with a lot of different women. If I haven't learned anything else from all of that experience, I have learned this; no two women are the same. Some may not be satisfied, so what? You are talking about casual sex, so move on to the next one. With each experience you will become a more skilled lover. Become a sex machine and no woman is going to complain about the hot sex that you gave them.  Sex is no different than any other manual task, in that the more you do it, the better you get at it. If you suck at fixing cars, it is not because your wrenches are from Sears, it's because you don't know how to use them properly yet.  Same thing with sex and your dick. I have always said that there is only one way to learn how to fight, and that is to fight. Sex is no different. Get in there and do it. Don't worry about your size, worry about your performance.  A few girls have lamented to me about the size of past lovers, but only if they were also lacking in other ways, such as being a selfish lover who was only concerned with getting themselves off. Hell, one girl complained about a prior partner with a 8"" cock who never lasted more than a minute.   The short answer is that you are not doomed, your future reputation as a terrible, or as a fantastic lover is entirely in your own hands.  I can also tell you this, one girl that I knew told my girlfriend that the best lover she ever had was a guy that couldn't get an erection at all. She had never even seen him hard, yet he was her best.  You can make this about your skinny girth if you want, but that is not going to do you any favors. Learn to fuck a girls brains out with the cock you have. Master it like any other skill and no woman is ever going to be disappointed in your sex.  It's all on you brother."

Doesn't make sense if what you look at what the girls are writing but yeah I'll believe you, I have to..  I'll start having sex now. If it turns out I'm too skinny and get rejected too often or make the girls disappointed idk what I will do, bad shit might happen..  Hope your advice isn't just some bullshit feelgood advice and reality is different. But you wouldn't write stuff just to make people feel good if it's not the truth right? I'll start having casual sex now, I'll come with an update! Thanks man!"
bigdickproblems,3bkvme,bigdickaltaccount,2,Tue Jun 30 10:08:38 2015 UTC,"How the fuck would you know if it's a problem or not since you have never used it? You have created a problem for yourself were none exists. You asked for advice and have gotten it, what you do with the information is up to you. It sounds like you want rejection to become a self fulfilling prophecy, but it doesn't have to be that way.   First off, you are wanting to have lots of casual sex with lots of different girls. Fine, but know that girls who want that kind of sex expect you to be able to perform in bed, and if you can't because you lack experience, you will not be getting referrals to other girls for more casual sex. Get a girlfriend or two first. Learn your craft, then go show the ladies what you can do. You are trying to run before you can even walk.  It's not feel good, bullshit advice. It's common sense. I never said that mastering a craft is easy, I said that you can accomplish it. You must have gotten good at doing something in your life. Just apply the same determination that you used to get good at whatever it is you are good at to fucking, and you will get good at sex as well.  I've said it before, but it bears repeating. Your future reputation as an excellent lover, or as a terrible lover is entirely in your own hands.  The guy with a reputation as a skilled lover will get lots of referral sex, the guy known as being shitty in the sack will have to work doubly hard to get sex."

The likelihood is what you're interested in. A random sampling of four men having 7 or more inches in length would be four separate 1 in 10 odds(7 inches being a 90th percentile) and 1 in 10,000 in total. What is far more likely is them lying. 7 inches is the sweet spot for bluffing about dick size. It's enough to be better than most but not enough to draw interest/ suspicion/incredulousness. It puts guys that are actually seven in a predicament because if you say you're seven, everyone will subtract 2 inches but if you play the game and say 9 inches, people will want to see it.  But this isn't like the SATs where socially it doesn't matter what anyone gets because everyone is going to lie anyway. If they are sexual rivals, the truth will eventually come out about people's size. If you they're not sexual rivals, you shouldn't be concerned with their dicks."
bigdickproblems,3bjz42,QuickDrawTimMcgraw,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 7"" seems to be the go-to size for guys when asked the question, and the size inflation is quite rampant - especially among young adults.  That said, OP asked regarding the probability of there being 4 out of 90 kids that have 7+ inchers. It's actually quite likely that there are at least 4 kids among a group of 90 that have 7""+ dicks.  Let's also change the assumption that 7"" is 90th percentile. Using rigorous studies that actually measure penises instead of relying on self-reports puts it at around 95th percentile.  Now, the probability that there are at least 4 kids among 90 that have 7""+ dicks is equal to:  = 1 - (probability that there are at most 3 kids among 90 that have 7""+ dicks)   = 1 - (probability of being no kid with 7""+) - (probability of being 1 kid with 7""+) - (probability of being 2 kids with 7""+) - (probability of being 3 kids with 7""+)  = 1 - (90 choose 0) * .9590 - (90 choose 1) * .9589 * .05 - (90 choose 2) * .9588 * .052 - (90 choose 3) * .9587 * .053  Type the above in Google, and you get: ~66% as the probability that there will be at least 4 kids among 90 with dicks that big."

One of my teammates got himself into trouble by bragging he had a 10 incher. We all knew it was just talk, but it stuck around as a joke for a while. Anyway, the point is, at your age it's probably just talk. People tend to lie more often when they feel inferior, so hey, there's that to think about too. And if they are lucky enough to have 7"" dicks, well then good for them. It doesn't change anything for you, does it? 7x5 is a statistic a heckuva lot of guys would want, and very few women would not want.

The primary issue that I do have is with people posting fake stories and troll posts.   Some posts are so incredible that I have a strong suspicion that some users are just living out a fantasy through them. More specifically, as /u/colucci pointed out in a separate thread, I do believe there are a small number of guys here that are into humiliation fetish - who post stories of monster dicks driving women wild just to get off. Also, I have noticed that the proportion of these “fantastic” posts seem to have increased now that it’s the summer and kids have more free time.  In a sense, I see this subreddit starting to cater more towards fantasy/make-believe elements than serving as a forum for real and legitimate stories and problems involving big dicks.   That said, I do agree with the concern that having “validated” members will make the atmosphere more unhealthy - so I definitely do understand the desire to maintain the status quo."

I'm well aware the posts on this site will change when school gets out for summer, and while post removals/bans have gone up under my watch, probably the #1 complaint I'm getting is not removing/banning the posts of summer users.  #2 is of course removing/banning posts too much.  Modding here is way differant then on 4chan though.  4chan has IP bans which makes bans more effective in general, whereas on bigdickproblems all you need to do is make a throwaway, so trying to moderate behavior is more important then trying to ban users.  This is why I almost always give removal reasons for my posts and the moderators here tend not to use a lot of bans.  The only effective form of ban we have are shadowbans which tends to be too drastic.  I'm trying to tweak the rules/automoderator/whatever to be more strict though."

bigdickproblems,3bdwag,drallcom3,9,Sun Jun 28 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'd discourage asking for proof/providing proof in general.  A: It generally results in situations where some users have ""proof"" and some don't.  This can cause people to say ""Oh yeah, if you're X size, where's your proof, I have proof"" and pressure people into the swapping of dick pics.  The fact that virtually nobody on this board is verified is intentional, it makes it so nobody is under pressure to ""verify"".  B: We have a HUGE amount of under 19 users here.  Dick pic verification excludes such users, results in such users getting sent dick pics, and such users ASKING for dick pics.  C: It doesn't matter at the end of the day who has the biggest or smallest dick here, but oh boy does the subject ever lead to drama."

OP: Picture in PM -OR- Sorry bud, not interested in posting pictures -OR- Here's a reference diagram constructed in MSPaint  There's nothing inherently wrong with that.

First of all, its a sub reddit for people with large schlongs, you wont be impressing anyone. Second of all, its the internet, nobody really cares, so why even bother?

Once I dated a guy who wanted to wait for sex, and meanwhile he would tease me about how good it'll be, how he'll wreck me with his dick etc etc, needless to say his dick was the same size as my pinky.

Yeah, I understand the bragging or claiming you have a big dick around your friends, but when it's with the person you're about to have sex, I believe it's unethical.

Not that I wouldn't like to have sex with them or that they're bad or anything, but because I have a hard time getting aroused by them. We might had an amazing time, but when the pants go off and I see a below average for me dick, then I dry up. No amount of foreplay or pretend would make me horny again, this had led to a couple awkward situations before. Average dicks dry me up as well, but not so much as to be unbearable/not possible, just not really enjoyable. An above average tho? I'll be all komanechi on it!

bigdickproblems,3bbfbl,poidog44,8,Sat Jun 27 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"All vaginas are different, and when you get aroused they expand in order to accommodate the penis maybe that's what you mean with bigger. And it's basically a muscle, so unless we talk about a vagina that is wrecked from back to back childbirth, I doubt it will naturally be stretched out. I have a typical vagina, but when I'm aroused I can easily take my guy's whole penis that's a monster (~15cm flaccid). Try to stick your dick in an non aroused vagina, I doubt it'll be so big that you'll get in. Actually, don't do this unless the woman has explicitly tell you that she enjoys this kind of play (it's really dangerous and can lead to awful vaginal tears and a scratched penis)."

Bone pressed, and non-bone pressed.  Both ways involve having the ruler at the top-center of the penis.  BP tells you the actual medical length, and NBP tells you the visible amount.  This also measures how much fat is around it.  The fat can compress, allowing you to use more than the visible amount during sex.  This means losing weight can make it look bigger, because the actual size is the bone pressed measurement.  For that reason, I see value in knowing both measurements."

In hindsight, I think I'd probably not have done it if I'd realized how dangerous it was, and I thank my stars nothing's happened cause of it.  More often, it just rubs me the wrong way when someone says 'Oh that counts, uve had sex' or 'oh that counts a girl has seen it', and 'oh that counts its rape'. Let me decide if its rape (I dont often see it that way from a personal standpoint, and only acknowledge it in a technical sense), and as for the other two...I honestly can't put words to why it rubs me the wrong way when people try to tell/imply that sort of stuff to me....but it just does."

So you need to be attractive to the girls (i.e. able to get them to bed) in the first place.  If you saw the Australia study, girls cared about size, but it mattered far more in guys who were tall/attractive. For short/unattractive guys, it didn't matter whether the guy was hung like a horse or a mouse - the girls just didn't find them attractive.  I'd just be happy in the fact that there would be more ""repeat business"" with girls. With small guys, this seems to happen much less often."

I can't imagine in 20 years of talking dicks I've only encountered shallow, size-queens, but who knows?  Stranger things have happened.  I will say this though, everyone has things that make them less appealing to the other sex.  I don't wear make up ever, I shave my pussy like once every two weeks (maybe) and I lose my temper more than I should.  So, you have a skinny dick, learn to eat pussy really well, be super sweet or super smart or whatever else makes you great.

Yeah you hurt my feelings and I'm gonna hurt yours (maybe) - I checked your post history and you really don't seem like the brightest person and rather weird and redneckish and not really the girl most guys would like to fuck, and I guess your friends are like that as well.. not saying all size queens are stupid and or anything like that, but I can kinda see why you write the stuff you do and have the preference and friends you have.. it's hard to explain, you're just that certain kind of girl, no loss for anyone lol.. wish you the best too!"

bigdickproblems,3baq2o,_niggle_,12,Tue Jun 30 04:00:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, you seem curious enough and willing to hear us out so I'll try and summarize why people don't appreciate your rhetoric.  To begin with, your claim in the original post takes a lump sum of approximately half the population and makes a sweeping overgeneralization which applies bar-none to every single one of them.  By saying ""girls"" in the most general sense, you do yourself a disservice - certainly not EVERY woman in the world is a size queen and it wouldn't be fair or logical of any of us to claim to understand what even a tenth of the gender wants. Human beings are complex beings, and reducing them down to a black and white ""they ALL want big dicks"" dehumanizes the rich and diverse population.  For comparison, a stranger who happens to be a woman says to you, ""AH, a man. That means you enjoy chopping down birch trees, fixing cars, and drinking whiskey on the rocks. You also are a compulsive liar, last five minutes in bed, and are an unrepentant racist."" All of these comparisons have been made and levied at Men as a whole, and I'm certain you can see where this broad over generalization fails to account for all men.   Now, while this hypothetical stranger lady could be misinformed, it's important to note that you telling her ""hey, I must be the exception because I'm not any of those things; not ALL men are like that"" isn't likely to change her mind. People who make these sweeping statements might look at you as an exception to the rule, but otherwise continue spouting this nonsense to the rest of the world.  This is important because at FIRST, you might laugh this off as some crazy bitch - but now imagine that half of the women you meet have this opinion. You're going to grow tired of correcting them, and begin to wonder what the fuck is going on here. Even worse, YOU might begin to associate ""all women"" with overgeneralizing pieces of shit. What do THEY know about you?  I'd fathom that the majority of users here at BDP appreciate a little bit of penis envy and bragging, but draw the line at being just a piece of meat. It's demeaning, dehumanizing, and rather than feeling sexy or enabling makes you question your worth. ""Do people like me JUST for my body? Am I even intelligent, or worth being with? I'm just a one night stand for these people.""  I won't pretend to speak for ALL women here, because then I'd be guilty of the same thing I see you doing in this post - however, from anecdotal and personal experience of talking to women (again, personal =/= truth, but it might HINT at it), they ABHORE being objectified and generalized as a single group.  Saying ""big dicks,"" and then changing it to ""above average"" doesn't really change that you're still applying a single catch-all truism to 3.5 billion people and implying that it is the norm, without any peer-reviewed evidence. Even with surveys, you will suffer from test-taking biases where only the most engaged people will give you responses and skew data.  It's in poor taste both statistically and morally to view ""women"" as an aggregate who have binary preferences and all should be considered secret size queens.  For a parallel, consider if somebody here had posted ""all women want my dick, they just don't know it yet."" This rationale has led to several real world allegations of rape, where a man who truly, truly believed he was justified in this stance forced women into compromising situations. In these men's minds, there was nothing wrong with rape because it wasn't rape if they secretly wanted it. Even when they gave a clear ""no.""  Rape is a lofty escalation compared to your claim, so no, I'm not saying what you've written is so bad - only that the underlying vehicle of prejudice which can lead to rape is borne from this same sort of ""other-ing"" wherein an entire group of people is reduced down to some fictitious common denominator.  ""All women"" is a phrase to be avoided, as is ""all men,"" ""all black people,"" etc.  Your original post, as I have read it, was SUPPOSED to be aimed at finding a way to appeal just to the types of women who were interested in knowing your size. Maybe that's what you wanted, but instead it applied to all women, which would be ridiculous even if we consider a fraction of these women to be lesbians, queer, or simply not attracted to men. It just falls apart."

They're not always true but I guess if you emphasized them it may attract a certain type? A lot of it is stereotypes that you have to be born with like being black, tall, having big feet and hands, etc. If I can speak from experience though since I meet most stereotypes it's really not on most girls immediate minds I find. Physical attraction, mental attraction, personality and trust in a normal sober setting is usually more of a factor to a hook up or date a female.  After that dick size is possibly a plus like big breast or ass on a female. Even then I'm seriously over generalizing. Age, maturity, culture and myriad of other things could be at play. Your best bet, and this is horrible advice if you want a serious relationship, is to find the most promiscuous female in a group and have sex or anything that involves her witnessing your penis. At that point rumors would get out and the ones who are interested would be a little more than obvious. It's not a guarantee though and some girls would be scared off too. You'd also need to be sure the sex is 10/10. It's also possible you may not be that big compared to the past guys they may have been with. Basically work on yourself and your game. Even the sexiest girls get called out for being whack in bed or starfish if they don't have anything going for them. Society allows them to still be put on a pedestal but that doesn't make them less shallow. Make money, work out, eat healthy and socialize. Relying on a bigger dick than the next or last guy is just going to turn you into one."

Go a few days without and it tightens back up.  One of my friends who is an OBGYN said its probably because it builds up the musculature down there. When she got her IUD, her doctor noticed that it was pretty well ""toned"", so that might have something to do with it.  Through edging when I was younger, I've managed to gain some control over when I finish. So we can really fuck as long as we feel like, which is pretty nice.

And it's not that I am long enough just to touch/brush it as I go, so it's a definite issue.  Back to topic: Some where more into it than others. One Ex (dude) went crazy for me bottoming out and ""hurting"" him, but I wasn't sexually mature at the time and quite uncomfortable with it. A recent experience was rather the opposite, had to be a bit more controlled and focused - which was fun in its own right.  And the same can be said for chicks. If they're into it, not a problem - but if they're not...  Although, getting a partner worked up for the sake of rough(er) sex is something that definitely happens with me."

That being said, you can't actually ""run out"" of semen. We've done ourselves a disservice by imagining the testicles as sacks or fuel tanks when really they are a complex series of organs and tubes. You are CONSTANTLY producing sperm, to the point where an all day orgy wouldn't deprive you.  What you MIGHT be noticing is a lack of volume or thickiness which seems to translate to ""less cum."" The majority of fluid you see is merely seminal fluid, which is produced by Cowper's gland and basically keeps your semen alive (as being exposed to air instantly destroys sperm).  If you're overworking it, then you are giving it less time to create excess fluid. Hypothetically if you wanted it to look like you had ""more cum,"" you'd want a diet or medication which targeted the Cowper's gland and stimulated it to produce more seminal fluid. Increasing your actual sperm count is more difficult, and wouldn't contribute to volume so much as viscosity or thickness.  Besides, what I imagine you're really suffering from has nothing to do with the fluids that come out so much as a general exhaustion of the sensitive skin on your penis itself. Sex is a lot of exercise, and the penis isn't really much more than a spongy tissue that inflates with blood. You keep using it often, and it won't have time to cool down."

There is such a thing as going 'too deep' so really if anything see this as an awesome opportunity to talk to her about what feels good and what is hurting her and it's an opportunity to try a fuck ton of different positions and see what makes your shit go off together. I've found that when I have a monster erection that I have to be careful doing doggy as you can just go way too deep too hard and that can genuinely hurt her. My advice would be to chat to her and say look I'm worried that my dick is hurting you so I think it would be frigging awesome if we could try a load of different positions and see what we like then download like a karma sutra app or some shit and just make like a sexy game out of it. But keep it lighthearted I mean it's sex dude it's supposed to be fun. But yeah the more you both have sex the more she will accommodate your girth and what not and the like ghost dick feels will be less and less apparent. And that thing about her only getting off with dick inside I've found that actually in truth it's more about dat combo, when your just doing foreplay or finger her and what not yeah you might be playing with her clit and you might be fingering her at the same time but literally nothing will make her explode like a Tesco value cola that's been left on the back seat of my car for 4 years than a combination of balls deep and also playing with her clit at the same time.

Better yet, you can get some tailor's tape and take your measurement.   What I'm curious about is if I'm too small sized for my age cause at school we would talk about it (no homo) and people would say their 8-10 inches   lol... Most if not all of them are almost certainly lying.  There are a few things you need to know.   It is more than big enough. Above average already, and it will likely continue to grow. Plenty of adult men are between 3 and 5 inches and they can still use it fine. Penis size really doesn't matter as much as most men, especially young men, seem to think it does. In fact, it's more of a competitive scene for males than a real issue for women. In several years' time, when you're ready to start having sex, you need to be aware that you will probably have to go out of your way to find appropriately-sized condoms, assuming your girth is also above average. If your condom breaks because it's too tight, all the benefits of using it are gone. What kind of health issues are you concerned about?"

Everytime I score one, it seems he's far more excited to have caught a big dick to play with than I am to have picked up a cute Asian...  That said, Asians are not necessarly smaller, but having a small dick is certainly not a problem for having great sex, to the point that I frankly can't understand size queens. Every single asian I had sex with was a far better performer. Oh, and the asian bottom stereotype is absolutely false; with asians, I have fucked about 10% of the time, and have been fucked 60% of the time. And every single blowjob rewarded me with quite a mouthful of jizz, far more than I ever been able to bring up (but to be fair, I jerk-off 2-3 times per day, so YMMV).  For several years, I had a filipino lover who has a quite interesting dick: about an inch soft, but increasing to a very wholesome six incher when hard (and super hard, too). It's just a pity he is cut, for I just love running my tongue inside the foreskin...  However, it doesn't mean that size scares me; the very best dicks to suck are Black dicks. They are big, yes, but they are soft (unlike Asian dicks), so they fill up the mouth nicely AND softly for a very comfortable fit."

Also, I don't mean talking (ie. complain) about the lack of sex, I mean going to her with: ""What can I do to make this better?"" ""What do you need?""

We have sex less and less frequently.  To be fair, most married couple taper off, and we have other reasons that hurt our sex life.  Who knows how big a part, if any, size mismatch plays,  I've actually been able to fit four fingers in, so her vagina is actually pretty big.

Basically you need to keep in mind that you are going to have to be the consumate lover. Before you get it in go down on her, rub her gspot, get a couple fingers in her.   Once she is nice and wet and relaxed there are never any problems. If you are going to do anal use a but plug on her or like 10mins in advance of your dick to stretch her out a bit.

You don't want to mess it up by doing it on your own. If it's curved up, I think it looks more aesthetically pleasing than straight. I'm biased as mine does that, and I've only gotten complements on the looks (like ""OMG you have the perfect dick you'll hit my spot just right""). From behind, it does cause issues with the curve. I hear curved down is the opposite issue. Not sure about the opinions of others about it, but I think it looks fine just different. Straight it the utility dick and works for pretty much every position, or so I've been told."

I would sleep in my underwear with a 12 o'clock tuck just so that when I would get erections my penis would be naturally in a straightened position, helping to reduce the angle (despite poking above the waistband obviously). I still do come to think of it. The curve seems to have diminished over the years (but sadly when I'm flat on my back my penis falls on my stomach. It doesn't hold up. Oh well).  I consulted a urologist who said it could be corrected. He asked for erect dick pics from the side to get an idea. He also said it would never get straight, it would be ""bumpy."" I noped the hell out.  With my first steady girlfriend I discovered some positions worked really well and had an explosive effect, namely doggy style and reverse cowgirl (she actually found it too intense).

I think the whole purpose of no fap is to allow guys to get some sense of control in their life and as a result become more confident.   I was considerably hornier which is to be expected, especially since I have a high sex drive to begin with.   Any increase in testosterone is reported to be temporary in that there is a huge spike at about one week that eventually subsides fairly quickly.   Masturbation releases dopamine and so does watching porn, so the theory is your brain becomes complacent with this form of dopamine because it's easy access and so you don't feel the urge to pursue women.   In general, not a method to boost testosterone but a method to promote self control and produce confidence."

That's a physical effect, probably related to testosterone.  Mentally, realizing how the brain works, both in terms of chemicals released and pathway reenforcement, can reveal significant effects to masturbation, even so far as addiction. Learning what these effects are, one can decide for self whether they are a personal priority. Some decide it is not worth fapping, and that's OK.

Did you, for example, eat different, abstain from alcohol and do more physical activity? Could you name some of the ""other markers"" that changed during the time you did not masturbate?  Is the reason for not fapping an inrease in perceived masculinity? Do you believe that it's better for women to not masturbate as well? why? why not?

bigdickproblems,3av6mp,esoteric_enigma,26,Tue Jun 23 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it's more pleasant. I've used numerous different regular sex lubes. The water based ones would dry up and become sticky. The oil based ones wouldn't dry up ever, which would leave the girl's nether region all oily which made them feel gross after sex and would make them want to hop in the shower immediately after. This meant we couldn't have sex before going anywhere or doing anything because they'd need time to shower off the oil. They'd turn me down because they didn't feel like dealing with the clean-up.   The coconut oil was perfect. It doesn't dry up and become sticky like the water based. It also doesn't stick around like the oil-based. It does it's job and then it is absorbed by the vagina and skin afterwards, leaving them soft. It also smells pleasant and coconuty. It's also cost effective. I bought a jar of pure organic coconut oil from Trader Joe's that has lasted me 2 years and it's only half gone now, keeping in mind that I also use it for cooking and moisturizing my skin sometimes too. Lube for sex cost me more and lasted a far shorter time."

bigdickproblems,3av6mp,passivelyaggressiver,2,Tue Jun 23 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not /u/bossbozo, but there are many arguments for adopting, and equally as many against having children.  The strongest arguments, IMHO, are that overpopulation is the main cause for the bulk of continual climate change, so everyone should adopt if they can.  In addition, by adopting you essentially guarantee that you are perfectly ready to have children before you actually get one, unlike natural inception.  Adoption agencies make sure to screen prospective parents for stability and dedication, so being accepted is a good sign you're ready for kids."

If the western world would leave Africa alone and let them live their lives as they always did in the past, they would be back down to 2-3 kids per woman and that would be manageable.   Why should I not have kids with my own blood and adopt somebody elses kids because africans are breeding like crazy in Africa? That point makes no sense at all. I don't want to raise other peoples kids, I want to have my own kids. With my blood, my dna, my genes, my own damn kids. If you worry about overpopulation, then go volunteer in Africa to deal with them having too many children and don't go on an internet crusade against a normal scandinavian guy that wants to get married and have kids with his own wife one day."

In for a penny, in for a pound.  You need to pick up a book (and read it too!) before you start popping out babies. Or maybe start off simple with Wikipedia and a book on etiquette.  I didn't even mention Africa because it's not the only overpopulated continent by far.  Secondly, I don't understand your aversion to adopting a child instead of making one.  There's more than enough to go around, and strangely enough, the only thing that's different about an adopted child is that they don't inherit your genetic disorders, and instead inherit someone else's.  You're the exact kind of person that needs to wait and learn some morals before raising little monsters of your own."

That is why I brought up Africa.   I have distinct genetics, distinct dna that can only be passed on by me and not by anyone else.

With girls I might hint at it in conversation or chats if I feel like it but I've rarely ever told a girl I had a big cock. It just seems douchy or braggy. And I doubt anything will come from it. I'm not successful with girls at all and telling someone I am big won't help. Eventually getting laid and being really good at foreplay, fucking well, and communicating probably will help much more. I suspect that only a girl bragging about me could possibly increase my chance of getting laid thanks to my endowment.   Actually this last weekend I was at a good party where 2 people apparently according to them were more well endowed than me (judging by what they said) and the conversation about big dicks arose(heh) and I pretty much just sat there and listened to the conversation about it and I watched how the (prude) girls reacted and what questions they asked and I watched as the guys whined about how ""everyone else always bring up my dick"" LOL. The only thing that made one of them slightly believable was mentioning the tp roll test.   The statistical chance that 2 out of like 10 guys at the party were bigger than me is very slim.

bigdickproblems,3as3yk,reciphered,2,Tue Jun 23 01:46:16 2015 UTC,I was puzzled by the difference in sizing too. TheyFit recommends a 60mm condom for me and while those were pretty good I still felt they were a bit tight and they got uncomfortable after about 7 minutes.   So I tried MySize 69 and I haven't looked back. Easily the best condoms I've ever used. According to the charts I get a 9% stretch from them. I guess I just prefer my condoms a little loose.   @OP looking at your flair the MySize 69 will fit you pretty well.
bigdickproblems,3as3yk,Polderpaal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:23:49 2015 UTC,We're a similar size. That's great to hear. I will give them a go. You never feel as though they might slip off? Is it snug?

They actually stay on better than the 60mm I've tried. Not really sure why that is, but the MySize just clings to my dick in a way I wasn't used to. Even to the thinner part towards the tip.   Besides, when you're thichest at the base the comdom should have plenty to hold on to."
bigdickproblems,3as3yk,Seaohtoo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:24:05 2015 UTC,"A 69mm condom would have about 1% stretch on a 14cm penis (6.9cm * 2 = 13.8cm), and that defies what I know about proper condom fitment.  Afaik, condoms feel and work best when they stretch between 10% and 20%."
bigdickproblems,3as3yk,cloudsofstrife,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:43:39 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying. The MySize  Condoms don't make any sense. Are they not made of Latex? Does anyone know, has anyone tried them?"
bigdickproblems,3as3yk,cloudsofstrife,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"If you look at the notes in the sizing chart it says ""Calculated with 20%-25% stretch in mind.""  The formula used appears to be nominal width x 2 x 20 or 25 % stretch to get min and max circumference.  I'm not sure what formula MySize uses. The ""Chart by hungfun"" in the sidebar was a helpful link for me.  The first chart shows % stretch required for different nominal widths based on your girth.  The ability to tailor your selection to be on the tighter or looser side but still within a zone that fit was very helpful.  Unfortunately I'm only aware of condoms that are flared from larger at the tip and smaller at the base and not vice versa.  Hope this helps."
bigdickproblems,3as3yk,iAmHidingHere,2,Tue Jun 23 04:47:05 2015 UTC,It's a nifty chart and by the looks of it the MySize 69s barely fall into the loose fit category at 14-15cm. I've tried NaturaLambs which are 68 cm and those felt too loose so I suppose I will stay away from MySize and wait for TheyFits to arrive in America this year. We miss you Joe.
bigdickproblems,3as3yk,iAmHidingHere,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:11:00 2015 UTC,"The NaturaLambs would have less stretch than latex so if those feel loose then i'd choose a lower nominal width than 69mm in latex.  Have you tried the Durex XXL? That seems to likely be the best option you can readily get in America.  Otherwise Lifestyles SKYN Large may work.  The polyisoprine seemed to have more stretch versus latex in my experience.  Not sure if those would be long enough for you though at 7.5"" (190mm)"

Most people however will never see that much cash in person at one time in their life.  Secondly, there's purely a curiosity factor. To actually see what a real 10+ inch cock really looks like. Since again, most people are highly unlikely to ever see one. I think there's a sense of disappointment in someone talking openly about it, but unwilling to anonymously photos of it.

You have this fucked up perspective about the size until you compare it to some other physical object that you already view as large or thick. It really opens your eyes to what other people see.  I wish I had realized this earlier cause it's a good reference when people ask how big you are. I usually compare it to a paper towel tube and say its a bit thicker, but I think a maglite is good because people view those as large, so comparing it to it just makes you seem larger, lol."

bigdickproblems,3alpbf,mywildpitch,18,Sun Jun 21 13:13:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it is welcome, but I can give a female perspective.   As you know, sex for us is a very mental, almost spiritual act. Everything during the act adds to the build. At least for me. The way I'm touched by his firm hands, the way he kisses my neck, his scruffy beard against my body...But one thing can completely drop the mood. It's so hard to stay focused when he's jabbing his finger into me when i'm not ready. Or when getting eaten out and he just keeps jabbing around down there...sometimes its easy to say, ""no, stop that."" others its really hard because I'm trying to focus on the feeling. Sometimes I have to tell him, just take me. Because what he is doing during foreplay is not working for me.   Imagine it like this. You're wife is looking sexy as ever, has a new sexy lingerie on and walks up to you and straddles you on the couch and whispers into your ear, ""I want you to fuck my brains out."" You're turned on, almost instantly. Now imagine that when you enter her she is too dry. For you its not pleasurable. The friction kind of hurts when you thrust. She is enjoying herself like never before. You continue because you like seeing her like this, but after a few minutes it starts to hurt. It is no longer fun, and even watching her as lost its appeal.   Now imagine this you're entire sexual life. Imagine this as all you're sexual experiences. Now think about this and the fact that you can't enjoy sex without being in the mood, your mind has to be in the right place. How can you get to this place if it's only ever going to hurt?   Her thoughts on sex are, in my eyes, completely rational. It hurts and is not fun anymore. She has never had sex where it was fun, felt great and was the best experience in her life. HOWEVER, to wait 10 years and have 2 children is a little long to bring up the issue. I'm sorry she couldn't get over the fact that it might hurt you to bring it up sooner. If you're not already, i suggest going to a sex therapist. (in addition to any other counselor you may be seeing :|) She shouldn't have waited, but if you're committed to fixing your marriage ALL areas need to be addressed. The way she feels about sex (religion wise) is a little too much. You are married, have kids and are the only partners you both have ever had. That is the ideal situation of a religious sex partner. But, for her to be taught that she can't enjoy it because she is brought up Christian is ridiculous. Her thinking needs to be that she CAN enjoy it because she is with her husband, and in a marriage in the eyes of God.   Anyway, I'm sorry you're going through this. And sorry for the wall of text..fuck, guys, if this is not appropriate here please let me know and i'll delete it..anyway, OP, Happy Fathers Day, and good luck on your marriage."
bigdickproblems,3alpbf,downsouthgirl22,8,Sun Jun 21 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to second this as another female perspective. My BD husband was also my first partner and I had problems for a while where I would dread sex because it would hurt and I would dread giving him a bj because it would be a long uncomfortable experience for me. What helped me get over it was to take PIV sex off the table for a while. We connected in other ways- we did lots of making out, reciprocated oral, fingers, toys, etc. And as selfish as this is going to sound, having the entire experience focused on my pleasure, with no obligation to have PIV sex, made it so I could just relax and enjoy myself. It sounds like your wife needs to be reminded/shown that sex can be pleasurable and fun for her and isn't just something she ""needs"" to do to be a good wife. Hope this helps, and good luck OP."

bigdickproblems,3alpbf,lavenderleopard,5,Mon Jun 22 01:31:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your perspective.  This was seriously a big help.    This is slightly related to something you brought up--I've Googled it before, but perhaps because we're kind of in a small town/rural area, there aren't really a lot of ""sex therapist"" results close to us.  Do you have experience in finding one?  And if so, how did you go about it?  If not, it's fine...just brought it up because you mentioned it."
bigdickproblems,3alpbf,RapingTheWilling,9,Sun Jun 21 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"Has she had any other sexual partners? I get pain every time with my SO because of his BD but I've had pain with average guys and smaller ones. I get the feeling she believes sex should be all pleasure and no pain/discomfort at all. Unless she sleeps with someone a lot under the average she's gonna have some discomfort at some point. Even if it's just chafing, the wrong angle, not warmed up enough or going at it too hard and getting a cervix bashing. And with the severely under average, the likelihood of pleasure will decrease. It's really completely normal to have some twinges of pain here and there during sex with ANYONE. As long as they're aware and want to alleviate that and she is receiving pleasure as well. Maybe see if she'll open up to some gfs of hers. She'll soon find out she's not alone and that it's completely normal."
bigdickproblems,3alpbf,RapingTheWilling,5,Sun Jun 21 14:03:37 2015 UTC,"I'm out with the family for father's day now, so I'll reply more later via edit. Just wanted to acknowledge you, thank you for your thoughts, and say that she has had had no other partners before me or since. Virgins at marriage, both of us. I'll reiterate--her attitude toward sex was seriously warped.  I should've put that in the post.  EDIT: Okay.  Thanks again for your perspective.  As I said, she's had no other sexual partners.  I guess what I'm seeking is perspective on the idea that sex is ""always"" an uncomfortable experience.  Without that experience myself (or her), and without talking to many/any of our friends about it because of...well, a number of reasons (I have a few close confidants, but she doesn't really have an outlet where she's talked about this kind of stuff before), I'm kind of forced to Google stuff.  And I alternatingly read ""It's normal for it to hurt, especially in situations where the man has a big penis"" and ""If she's warmed up/aroused appropriately, it doesn't hurt and feels great because the vagina is designed to stretch"" etc. etc. etc.  I think encouraging her to open up a little more might help her gain that same perspective--that's a good idea.  Thanks again!"
bigdickproblems,3alpbf,BreakTheLoop,5,Sun Jun 21 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you something I've learned. I'm a christian, although an admittedly shitty one. You can totally disregard my post if you're not/weren't ever christian.  If I had saved sex until marriage, I don't think I'd be in a happy relationship either. My girlfriend and I do it regularly. If religion was the reason you held out, I commend you for having dedication and commitment to something you believe in. But the reason I believe it isn't wise is that sex is too important of an interaction in healthy relationships.   I've had people in /r/sex tell me (before I was banned) that sex means nothing when its good and plentiful, but it means everything in a relationship when there is a sexual problem in it. Religiously, when you marry, you vow to commit the rest of your life to the person without any idea or sample of one of the most important facets of happy marriage. The second part of the religious issue is that you don't know whether that person will be sexually open, willing to tell you what they like, and willing to make compromises in the bedroom. There is no situation that both parties feel more vulnerable, and therefore more capable of building trust upon than sex.  Do you think she has always felt this way, since the first couple times you had sex? My girl did at first, and it took almost a year of trying before we could both enjoy it. I think past doctrine (the stuff my parents learned) makes it very difficult for a sexual christian relationship to exist, because sex is so taboo and no one can tell you what to expect or how to work out problems with sex.  All I can offer is my condolence, and hindsight. My girlfriend understands that it won't always be 10/10, and many times, it will be 2/10. If your wife cannot be convinced to communicate with you and work with you, I can't say that the blame lies on anyone but her.  Final note: If you all have had regular sex for a long time, is it possible that she's suffering from a tear/tears that haven't had time to properly heal before being reinsured the next time? If they're getting reopened every time, I can see why it hurts every time. My girl is tiny and only reports pain after her period, which I sort of attribute to damage done by a tampon and not me."
bigdickproblems,3alpbf,throwerforporn,3,Sun Jun 21 19:33:22 2015 UTC,"If I had saved sex until marriage, I don't think I'd be in a happy relationship either.   This, really.  I've even told her as much, and in hindsight, I've told her that I really wish we had had intercourse prior to getting married.  That said, we had fooled around a little (""third base,"" if you will) but I think a lot of our sexual discrepancies would have been solved or at least been closer to being solved than they are right now.   Do you think she has always felt this way, since the first couple times you had sex?    That's difficult to say, since she has been such a poor communicator regarding sexual issues.  However, I will say that while she's mentioned my size being an issue in the past, she has also told me that she's ""satisfied"" with our sex life, and there have been a handful of times where, instead of me initiating sex, she has approached me already in a very aroused state.  I raised that point last night--asking if even during those times if the pain was a problem for her, and she said that it was.  Again, a communication issue that needs to get worked out.   My girlfriend understands that it won't always be 10/10, and many times, it will be 2/10.    I guess that's why I'm posting here--to try and gain some views on how people deal with the times where it's not 10/10, as you say.  Trying to ascertain how have other couples tackled the physical aspect of this issue on a long-term basis, if you will.   Final note: If you all have had regular sex for a long time, is it possible that she's suffering from a tear/tears that haven't had time to properly heal before being reinsured the next time?    Personally, I would think that this isn't a large part of the issue, simply given that we don't have sex that frequently.  I've told her in the past that frequency isn't everything--really, while I could have it very frequently, I understand that her sex drive is different and I have no issue with that.  But like I said--most of our marriage, it's been 2-3 times a month.  So while I'm not saying that it's impossible that there are no issues like this one, I am saying that I don't think it's likely.

bigdickproblems,3alpbf,Doctor_Loggins,3,Sun Jun 21 22:17:51 2015 UTC,"Firstly, thanks for the reply.   I just find it incredibly sad and messed up that it took 10 years of marriage and 2 kids for you two to be in a position where she admits having sex hurts her every time.    To be honest, I agree and I think this is the largest issue that we have.  And it relates to this, as well:   I'm not sure your dick size is a major point in your separation. Communication and what you each and both consider healthy sex probably is.   I realize looking back that the headline I chose kind of insinuates that we're breaking up because of my dick size.  Bad choice of words on my part; our issues are multi-faceted and slightly diverse, and I didn't mean to lead on that she and I were ready to throw our marriage away basically because I have a big dick.  It kinda took me off guard when she said it last night; like what I said in the post, it had been something she had mentioned in the past, but last night was the first time she had communicated to me that it was a steady, ever-present problem.  That is more of a communication thing than anything else--maybe this is in the wrong sub?  I posted it here because I knew a lot of people here might be able to relate to the same problem and offer some different perspectives.  Being that we are both kind of inexperienced sexually, I thought it would help.  I should note that when she told me to ""go ahead and finish,"" she had already had an orgasm through manual stimulation.  Afterward, she told me that whenever we start to have sex, she's not thinking about it and would like to have more sex.  Meaning, she doesn't necessarily want the ""show"" to end so abruptly.  However, after that, she said that usually when I insert my penis that it's usually such a pain that she essentially ""gives up"" and just tells me to finish to get it over with.    In short, I agree that communication is our biggest issue.  I guess I'm just seeking perspective on this aspect of it, really.  Seeking reassurance.  The more I've thought about this (and I've communicated this to her), I think that while we can meet a middle ground on this specific issue, I think it's a slightly big deal if we're unable to have the kind of sex that we both find satisfying for now and in the future.    Anyway, thanks again for your answer."

Having something that needs talking about and someone who does not want to talk makes it very difficult to resolve. Sex therapist maybe? As far as the actual bdp goes more frequent sex would probably help the pain problem. However that does not seem to be an option. How does she feel about toys? If it something she is okay with them try getting a toy about your size and warm her up with it and maybe even make her cum before piv.

The dicksize thing should be used more like a gimmick sorta thing. Its nice and all but its ur heart and evotion to please her that will trully get her to go nuts for both in the relationship and in bed.  If u trully like her, don't even mention ur cock.

One night I was tripping and drunk as well, and we all skinny dipped. And he saw my dick. That's how he had the reference.    Be nice and start asking her to go out to movies or lunch and things like that.    We do go out to shows and public events. I asked her about dating (in a roundabout way), and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship. Which she really isn't at this time, that's a long story why though. I posted that on a throwaway.  So I don't want to take her to any movies or 1 on 1 things as of yet.   Anyway. I'm just trying to think that this could make it work out for a hookup scenario, and the hookup scenario could lead to a relationship. Many people do get in relationships after a hookup, and she is the hookup kinda girl."

It usually only serves to make an already attractive guy more attractive.   That said... Given that your big dick is now public knowledge, it does open an avenue for more risque conversations:  For example, you could say/text:   ""I guess you now know my big secret? Hope it won't make things... awkward between us ;)""   or more explicitly end with:    ""Hope you don't have anything against big dicks ;)""   Sure, she will need a degree of interest in you already to respond positively.

Just read her reactions, and escalate accordingly (light touching always helps).  e.g. one best-case scenario:   you: ""So, I guess you know about my secret now, huh?"" her: ""How do you mean?"" you: ""That creep [MALE FRIEND's NAME] telling everyone about my dick size!"" her: ""Oh - haha. Yeah, that was so awkward!"" you: ""So I want to ask, since lots of guys seem to care. Does size really matter?"" her: ""No! It's what you do with it that counts!"" you: ""Yeah?

I've heard of guys getting with chicks because of rumors around here.   If you leave it too late, you will be friend zoned.   I did leave it too late, but I feel like I can make my way out.

But I've heard of people becoming FWB with people, but not dating. And that'd be cool too, I guess. I'd rather have a relationship, but I just feel like, as a man, I'm degrading myself by hanging out with a chick a lot and not having sex. I do like her friendship, I just feel like she and our friends might think I'm a loser because I can't get laid. I'm not saying she owes me that or anything, because I do enjoy her friendship and would be fine without the sex part. I just feel it would do good on my self esteem if I could.   So I just need to somehow figure out if she finds me attractive/fuckable. But due to lack of experience, I have no idea how to do this because it is late into the friendship.

A girl showed interest in me (she knew about my size too, ha), but I was too chicken to ask her out. So she started going after other guys - but we still hung out and became really good friends. She had an amazing, wild personality, and I developed very strong feelings for her. I never did anything though, because: 1. I was a wuss; 2. She was in and out of dating other guys; 3. I didn't want to risk an amazing friendship.   Time flew, and eventually I had to move far away after graduation. She told me right before I left that she loved me. Even though I now have had a lot more experience, what she said still haunts me to this day. A part of me will probably always love her.  As Keats would say - heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter. Something that you didn't have will always be painted under an idealistic brush, and actual experiences will pale in comparison.   IMHO, it's much better to take the shot - even if you miss."

My friend hasn't really dated anyone while we were together. Just hookups and flings. I did ask her about dating, but she said she wasn't ready for a relationship. I never tried anything sexual, but I'm sure that connection is there.   There's been times when we've been drinking and we give each other really long hugs.   I remember when we first met, she randomly gave me the biggest hug. And before I left she said that she loves me. It was an instant connection."
bigdickproblems,3ao2bp,bdp_stats,2,Wed Jun 24 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"The long hugs, the seeming attraction, and explicit declarations of love - that’s eerily similar!  With my girl, I made a resolve long ago to make a move at my next opportunity, but unfortunately, she is in a long-term relationship and we have been either bicontinental or bicoastal since the goodbye.  We didn’t date, but went through a lot together - road trips, concerts, getting pets together, hospitalization, deaths, etc. She was always giving me compliments/emotional support, and was just amazing in so many ways (being way more social and intelligent than I am). She was the type of girl that I could imagine getting old with, and I have never fallen harder for any girl.   Which makes me feel bad for girls I have been with since. I waited for a stronger attraction to develop with them, but they were always under her shadow, and it never got to the “gaga” level. Many relationships since were mostly sexual with not much emotional/deep connection.  So I guess I’m pretty biased in what I’m saying. In my case, a flat rejection might have been better than this lingering attraction that I have for my ""dream"" girl. But, I definitely get what you’re saying - you don’t want to risk your friendship. So definitely do approach with caution.   Anyways, best of luck again! It almost feels like a vicarious experience!

bigdickproblems,3ao2bp,bdp_stats,2,Wed Jun 24 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"We've been through a lot together too! We've been on a few roadtrips, go to a lot of concerts together, I provided her some emotional support with her recent jail release, etc. She also confided in me about her past substance addiction.   Our whole relationship has been hot and cold, though. Mainly on her end, but somewhat on my end too because I've had to move out of state for a brief period of time. It's either we are close as fuck, or we're not as close. And it seems like every time we DO get separated, when we get back together we are super close for a little bit. But the excitement wares off after we hang out a few times.   I can't get her off my mind though. It's tough. I feel like we're meant to be. However, every time I leave her after dropping her off at home or me leaving a concert or party, I always yern for the next moment to see her. And I'm always worried about the idea of the possibility of never seeing her again or not being able to take her out to concerts anymore. I want our friendship/relationship to either grow or just say best friends. And I'm worried that trying something sexual might weird her out and cause her to distance herself.   Also, one time I did text her saying ""I'm I the type of guy you could ever see dating?"" And she said she isn't looking to date anyone because she needs to focus on herself right now. Which she does since she has a lot of stuff going on in her life.   BTW: With your girl, did you guys ever do anything sexual at all? Did you guys ever make out? For me, no. But had really long drunken hugs. And one time when she was drunk she initiated the hug, and said she loved me. Second time I did, told her I loved her, and she excitingly said that she loved me too.   But yeah. She is way more socially intelligent than me too. I could see us together forever too, and helping each other out. Like everything that I lack, she has, and everything she lacks I have. So it would be a really awesome relationship if it worked out."

bigdickproblems,3alazx,sg_acct,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, I don't think there is one ""correct"" way to measure a penis. Even medical studies are divided on whether to measure bone-pressed or not.  That said, I do think most measurements are done with a straight-edge ruler - from the pubic bone from the top (not from the side). This undoubtably will sell the curved guys very short.   I'm very curious about your curve though! I know some girls really like a big dick, and some girls really like a curve. Perhaps having both doubles the pleasure? Have you had good luck with most of the girls?"
bigdickproblems,3alazx,sg_acct,2,Sun Jun 21 13:47:03 2015 UTC,"First, thank you for answering.  I think BP is more valid because I used to weigh 50 pounds more and well my dick seems bigger now. I know for a fact that BP is still the same while NBP changed. So I have no doubt about that. Thing that bothers and confuses me is erect lenght. Because using a ruler sets me back and as an engineer I cannot accept that kind of measuring. Think about a bridge, arched. Would you say lenght is the distance shore to shore or perhaps lenght of the road, wich is obviously bigger value.  Now top and side, usually it is more acceptable from top. And that seems fine. So I'm in the 8 inch range.  Flaccid streched BP measured from top seems most valid.l, even tho I would say it is a bit shorter then erect, but really close.  About curved and big - yeah, girls as you may know enjoy feeling streched, filled etc. But curve is even more fun because you can reach and poke all new kinds of spots and places. That is if you use it wisely. I had only positive comments, although honestly straight one looks more impressive, curved one is more fun as I've been told many times. It gets job done really quick, I mean girls told me that it feels ""new and exciting and more pleasing"" then a straight one does.   BJs are even more difficult and girls usually need more time to get it right, but that is the way life works, you get some and lose some."
bigdickproblems,3alazx,BrookBones,2,Sun Jun 21 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"I guess it would depend on what the measure is being used for?  For example, none-bone pressed pertains more to ""visual"" length, and  bone-pressed pertains more to the ""usable"" length.  Meanwhile, if you want to know how you stack up against other guys in the studies, the ""shore to shore"" length would be more valid, because that's how most other guys were measured.  But then again, if you are curious about the effect that your size would have on a girl, then the entire length, along with your curvature, will all come into play.  And kudos to your success with girls! I definitely agree on girls feeling ""new and exciting"". For me, some girls haven't had a big dick before, and just the novelty factor alone seems to have a big effect. And to imagine - the novelty factor will be doubled with a curve! I'm quite envious of all the spots that you can hit with the curve!"

One thing that can help her jaw is to have her lie down 90 degrees to your body with her head completely resting on your belly. This allows her whole head and neck to relax.

I was quite rattled because his dick was not small and it was quite the character; prominent curve, multicolored and a mushroom head.  I heard myself speaking incoherently because part of me was wanting to tell him what he was doing and to turn around, but the other part was amazed/shocked.  It bothered me so badly that the next day I told him what happened.  He profusely apologized and I assured him it/I was okay ... I even went as far to tell him that it was actually impressive.  Every since that moment he has opened up tremendously about his very personal life and his penis... It actually has a story.   I said all that to say this, I think to some degree quite a few guys are curious about other guys dicks' or even wonder what other guys  opinions are about their third member.

bigdickproblems,3aacsd,CMDrunk,3,Thu Jun 18 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"The easiest and most convenient way is with a sheet of ruled paper.  Cut a strip about an inch wide perpendicular to the lines on the paper.  Wrap it around your penis, and rip or cut off excess paper.    Use the strip as a measuring tape.  Wrap it around and mark or simply take note of the point at which it starts to overlap.  Measure that length on a ruler.  This is better than string because string can stretch and the thickness of the string may affect measurements."

Challenging 1. would be challenging the very core of statistics itself - if you are to admit that the study was performed correctly.

Spermicide is certainly an option, but there's the problem of it not protecting against STDs. Less important in a relationship, but definitely important prior to that! Plus, how successful it is depends on if it's used correctly or not, and it's expensive, at least where I've found it. Is it multiple use or one use? I'm honestly not too sure how that works.  Honestly the biggest difficulty is explaining the condom issue (which most people don't understand). So I'd have to cross that bridge before spermicide became a possibility.

This is widely supported on this subreddit. A size that is pretty big that gets most/all the perks of being big with less(er) cons associated with that bigness.  It's bigger by a good margin but its  not a drastic difference.  It should also be a given that bigger means bigger with in reason. :| if that is lost on you...

I doubt you are but maybe you could be referring to the ejaculate part of the post. This is only something I can go by what I've seen in all the pro/amateur videos I have seen. You can't tell who has that huge load. If a huge rod was an indication of a huge load, believe me, I would of noticed this years ago when I was into girls getting plastered.

It's really important to make sure that you're not urinating before sex, that the area is cleaned, and that she's taking care of cleaning up afterwards.   I highly doubt you were the cause of a UTI. Some kids used to get them in high school just from heavy periods. Your size has little is anything to do with it- it's more hygiene related."

A full bladder can lead to a host of other complications, including an inability to orgasm. As long as she cleans her vulva before sex with a little bit of warm water, as you should anyways, I don't see why peeing before sex is an issue."

Nearly every girl that has seen it has complimented the size. The exception might be the last girl that saw it. She didn't said anything but when we were getting to know each other she, without knowing my size, told me her best sexual experience. I then asked what size was the guy and she showed me in a ruler. I started laughing and she asked: ""Why are you laughing? It's big!"". Well, I laughed because she pointed exactly 7'', my size. So from here I can deduce that she thinks I'm big even though she didn't have the ""Wow"" reaction that other girls had.  About enthusiasm, well, I'm not that experienced but once I was with a girl that was a little bit affraid and worried about taking me. She said I was too big. A reverse enthusiasm. With a twist.

bigdickproblems,3a40hm,SMELLS_LIKE_FARTS,2,Fri Jun 19 01:21:40 2015 UTC,"No problem, happy to share.   It varies but the majority have been afterward, likely because most of my first times with a new girl are late at night, in the dark, slightly drunk. Once they see it in the light of day I get a lot of ""so thats why I'm so sore this morning"" and other comments to that effect. Every girl says something after climax but the shivery muscle spasms say more than words and I take a lot of pleasure in being able to give that to them. Nothing more satisfying to me than screwing a girl so thoroughly that she loses all motor control.  Personally I think I get a lot of comments because I don't talk a lot and most people tend to assume I am conservative in all aspects of my life. When they find out I am packing heat and am an animal in the sack they are quick to comment on it. Never judge a book by its cover I suppose :)"
bigdickproblems,3a40hm,SMELLS_LIKE_FARTS,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! Having girls orgasm in such a way must be a thrill!  Just curious - how often do girls climax during intercourse? Would you attribute it more to your size, or to your skill?"
bigdickproblems,3a40hm,bigdickaltaccount,3,Sun Jun 21 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"While size helps as well as knowing what to do I find the biggest factor is duration. I don't really keep track of hard figures as it were but whenever I last past a certain point , say 15-20 minutes there's a pretty good chance she'll climax, but that doesn't factor in foreplay (which I am a huge fan of) and generally building arousal which is important in its own right. I definitely don't bring my A game every time, but when the conditions are right it's just a matter of time."
bigdickproblems,3a40hm,bigdickaltaccount,3,Sun Jun 21 05:27:25 2015 UTC,"Wow dude! I have heard most guys last less than 4 minutes (Kinsey puts it at 2?!), but that most girls want it to be much longer.  Whenever I hear about girls being unable to orgasm, I wonder whether they just haven't met someone with size/skill/stamina yet. Given that most girls only have around 4-8 partners in their lifetime, they won't likely encounter someone with even a 6""+ penis with skill and stamina!   For the girls that you bring to orgasm for the first time - it must be exhilarating for them to discover that they can orgasm after all! Did the girls look at you in a different way afterwards? Did one night stands want to sleep with you again? Please forgive my curiosity, but I find this very fascinating!"
bigdickproblems,3a40hm,dfj2xxx,2,Mon Jun 22 02:08:02 2015 UTC,"haha well it definitely takes practice, patience, and concentration. A lot of it comes down to pacing, slowing down when the stimulation gets to be too much (a good time to switch positions), and generally knowing how to reduce your arousal level. After a certain threshold it becomes pretty easy to control, allowing me to go for as long as I want within reason. That said when I sleep with a girl for the first time I try to focus on foreplay and make sex itself relatively quick. Odds are she is going to be feeling some discomfort and that will negate a lot of arousal making going for climax through penetration a fool's errand. After a few sessions when she is more used to my size I will try to get her there and if I don't succeed I adjust my technique and try again the next time. While I truly enjoy being able to make a girl orgasm I must admit it is also selfishly motivated as I tend to have a far more intense orgasm myself, so its a win-win for sure.  I feel like those times are somewhat accurate if you just go to town in my case at least but I feel that's how a lot of guys go about it. Some simple techniques would go a long way for a lot of people, but I guess I can't complain that most guys haven't caught on given the comparison.  As far as girls looking at me differently, like I alluded to earlier most people would not expect a guy like me to have sex like I do. Sure I am fairly good looking, in shape, etc. etc, but I have social anxiety and am reserved in a lot of ways so it throws most girls for a loop when I take charge and do my thing in the bedroom. The funniest thing for me is going to a party where I can tell she told all her friends about it... girls who never showed interest are all of a sudden looking at you much differently and I find it pretty entertaining.   I haven't ever slept with any girl just once so I guess I've never had a one night stand, though I never intended on following up on a few. I tend to see each girl for a few months at least in just a kind of continuous stream of girlfriends. Some of my worst relationships have spawned from sleeping with a girl the first night I met her, but hey the sex was great so I can't complain too much.   Dont worry about asking questions. When I was younger and had a lot of questions there wasn't really a good place to discuss anything, especially as specific as this sub is, so if I can share my knowledge and experience to help someone out or even just satisfy curiosity I am more than happy to do so."
bigdickproblems,3a40hm,hungindian_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! You sound like a consummate professional, and seem to have the girl’s orgasms down to a formula!  Why I think most guys suck at sex - is that they refuse to learn. Most guys I know would consider it embarrassing to ask for help/advice on sex matters! In school (at least in the U.S.), they are only taught about abstinence and sexually transmitted diseases… And of course, size can’t be taught!  My final (I hope!) question - for the girls, it must be near impossible finding someone who measures up! Are you in touch with any exes, and how are they holding up?"
bigdickproblems,3a40hm,Misinformed_ideas,2,Tue Jun 23 01:56:59 2015 UTC,"Haha, well I tend to attack most issues systematically and sex was no different for me. I figured orgasms were the goal of sex if you weren't trying to have kids, so i set about finding a way to get there somewhat consistently :P  I think you are right in a lot of ways about stubbornness and embarrassment.  I would much prefer to live in a culture where it wasn't a faux pa to openly discuss stuff like this. I grew up in the bible belt so I was lucky to get any info about sex, much less how to become better at it. It made the learning process slow and clumsy but fortunately quality information has become more widely available so maybe we will start to see a shift in attitudes going forward.  I am generally the one to initiate break ups so I tend to not stay in touch with my exes as they either want to get back together or kill me, both things I'd like to avoid. Those who I do keep in touch with were friends before we dated so it is more comfortable to be around each other. We generally don't talk about our partners in much detail so I don't really know if they measure up so to speak, but they all seem like really nice guys who have a lot going for them. Otherwise most seem to be doing fine judging from facebook, a few have gotten married in the last few years, some had kids, no lives completely destroyed on account of me afaik."

This is what I meant about it being a potentially pricey experience to find the right fit. I recommend you go to Freshpair's website, as people post reviews of their products. That might help you find a pair with the small waist you need but the big pouch you need. Edit: Reread your post and it sounds like you got two different sizes.

Studies say that penis size is related to how selective a girl is, and the testicle size related to how promiscuous she is.  Chimps have the biggest testicles, because their females tend to be very promiscuous, and shooting a bigger load is your best bet to pass on your genes. Meanwhile, the larger human penis suggests that hominids needed to keep females with choice sexually satisfied. ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/may/06/women-penis-size )  So our huge penis (4x the size of a gorilla's) may be due in part to girls selecting to mate with guys with big dicks who could better satisfy them."

Large penises have always been coveted by the opposite sex because, as OP said, it is a biological symbol of fertility. Take a look here at the Greek god of fertility, Priapus, usually depicted with a large penis.   You can find mentions of large penises in other ancient texts, even the Old Testament:    There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses [Ezekiel 23:20]   So, no, porn did not give us this idea."

Epigenetic factors like environmental toxins, climate, stress, and even your mother's diet before you were CONCEIVED can all affect how your penis turns out by influencing your growth and development.

I have both the TLC-X and the DTR, which I swap between for different things. The overall community for restorers is very small, and I'm not particularly worried. I'd rather have a semblance of prepuce than gratuitous length.  Since I've started restoring, I find that condoms are much easier to wear, and I understand why most of the world doesn't mind wearing them, though they still are a slight hiccough when wanting to get freaky - especially with slick hands and wrappers.

TLC-X   Easily used as a tugger Originally meant as a bidirectional unit, but definitely serves as a tugger better ~90.00 USD Exceptional Customer Service Easily Used Website Tends to slip a lot when first starting out Will trip metal detectors Overall smaller than the DTR Tricky to get on with minimal shaft skin Custom made Attachment loop in mixed porosity Silicone is somewhat tenuous    DTR   Definitely meant as a bidirectional unit Ugly-ass website, but the best progress proof pictures you will ever see. Ever. ~90.00 USD when purchased without additional support stuff (Air adapters, tape, extra rubberbands, etc.) Exceptional Customer Service Less effective as a tugger, but easier to adapt for gravity tugging Will not trip metal detectors Tends to grip a lot tighter, which is good for newer people, but the lack of blood flow will somewhat hinder progress after six months, where you'll probably plateau if you don't change how you use the device Larger than the TLC-X, but is generally not visible through clothing. (Except with tight jeans) Very easy to attach Can opt for a different pusher plates (great for bigger guys) Solid hard nylon Easier to clean   If you are starting out, I would recommend using the canister method, until you can roll shaft skin over the length of the inner cone/dome. You can see it here, but you can easily DIY this unit. From there, you can really use either the DTR or the TLC-X.  I feel that if I started over again, I'd probably lean more to the DTR, simply because it's so much easier to get attached, especially with the conformed pusher plate. That aside, they are extremely similar products in the grand scheme of things, and both are great groups that I wouldn't mind working with again."

For most guys, the only bottleneck to having more sex is girls rejecting them based on (looks/intelligence/personality/money etc.), and not their hangup on penis size.   And from what I have observed: girls try pretty hard to hold on to guys that can give them sexual satisfaction, while they are quick to part ways with guys that can not. Not saying penis size is be-all end-all, but it does matter, and a poorly endowed guy might sleep with many more partners until he finds the right match.     But just to entertain your theory, let's say that 8""+ guys (those in the top 1%) are 3 times more likely to have sex than all the other guys (so now they make up top 3% of penis sizes that a girl encounters).

First of all, there's the obvious bias where, if a researcher says they're doing a study on dick size, guys who are really insecure about their size are less likely to volunteer.  However, if the data is self-reported through a survey or questionnaire, guys are more likely to exaggerate, round up, or do things like measuring with the ruler pressed into the pubic bone to make their number come out bigger.  But if the study is done in a lab where the researchers are doing the measurements themselves (which would be VERY difficult to get approved by a review board and to get participants for), the guys are more likely to have difficulty getting a full erection or maintaining it long enough to get all of the measurements they might be taking.  My guess is that the ""just over 5 inches"" statistic that most people are familiar with got it's popularity based on it being done more ""scientifically."" Now while it's hard to say whether the volunteer bias towards larger dicks balances out with the smaller bias from not being able to get fully erect in an uncomfortable environment, I'm willing to believe that the average is closer 5.5""-6"", making 7"" not that unusual at all.  TLDR; the ""5 inch average"" statistic may have a lot of bias behind it in both directions, so it's hard to say how reliable that might actually be, so use caution when basing any assumptions off of it."

We had a recent post here about guys being insecure about their dick size because they were secretly competing against their friends or other men. When with women they were satisfied with their own penis and body.   Being taller makes you look more powerful and strong, more charismatic. Manlier. People are more likely to talk to you and look up to you, not only literally but also figuratively. Physically you have more potential for strength if you are taller. I can't think of any sport except maybe gymnastics where it's not better being taller. It adds a lot to your overall attraction if you are a tall man. And it's instantly recognisable. It's one of the first things you see and judge when you look at a person.   Our dicks are hidden like 98% of our lives. And even though we sometimes bulge or whatever it's not exactly like cleavage. Just look at how many here that wants to hide their bulges. It's seen as something indecent. And we can't just run around bragging about our endowment unless we want to look like idiots. At best we can use subtle hints and jokes but in most cases they just get turned around at us in the shape of small dick jokes."

At that point, a bigger penis would be cherry on top, and height would have more consequences such as the ones you mentioned.  But between a small penis and beings short? It's hard to say. 5 percentile in height puts you at around 5'5"" - 5'6"", while 5 percentile in penis size would put you at around 4""-4.25"". Would you honestly say that having a 4"" penis would not have an impact on your quality of life?   Years ago, when the sexual environment was more conservative, maybe a 4"" penis wouldn't have been that terrible. But girls nowadays seem very size-oriented. Many girls openly admit that they prefer a big penis, while other girls dump their partners over it. One girl from the RedHotPot TV interview admitted that she never had to dump a guy for a small penis, because she would never even get into a relationship with a small-penised guy.  It is a terrible feeling to have that you might not be able to satisfy a girl. When the penis slips out, or when the girl can't feel it - let alone give her a mind-blowing orgasm."
bigdickproblems,39t3zr,want_a_bdp,2,Sun Jun 14 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"I really can't relate so it's hard to say. 4 inches is a full inch smaller than my soft size. I don't know what it is like having an average or small penis. But having a big one has not brought me anything positive really. I'm just not insecure about it I guess. I worry about lot more about looks, having too little muscles and muscle definition, not being charming enough, social enough. All the little things that make women interested in interacting with you. If I can't get laid then my dick is just my secret that I can't share. What do you think I'd choose right now between wanking alone with two hands or being with a girl for the night if I could only get to eat her pussy? I'd rather eat the pussy right now.   Yes, I understand that a big dick is pretty much only a positive thing in most cases today. And having a smaller than average might be crushing to th self esteem. But a big dick is not be all end all to sexual satisfaction and happiness. And about that women talking about small dicks like that. Do see it as a loss for you. See it as a loss for her. How many awesome men she misses out because of this requirement of hers.   I think every man's first instinct to the question ""Would you rather be 5 inches taller or have a 2 inch bigger dick"" is to choose the dick size. But I think the advantage of height outweighs the dick size. ""I want a tall handsome man""."
bigdickproblems,39t3zr,AlexanderGson,2,Sun Jun 14 23:25:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree on how it's a loss for girls when they rule guys out based on shallow criteria: e.g. ""big dick"" and ""tall/handsome"". But consider this: a girl could physically get more pleasure from a big dick. Meanwhile, why does she need someone who is 6' tall?  I think for guys and girls alike, the appreciation for a big penis develops through experience. A girl may not appreciate a big penis until 1. she meets someone with a big dick who knows how to use it (and isn't painful), and 2. she has sex with someone smaller (for comparison). I found that the more sexual experience a girl has, the bigger her preference for a big dick.  It's similar for guys as well. My best friend is 5'6"", and he used to have low confidence approaching women - many would reject him based on his height alone. Now that he's had more experience (he's in his late 20s), he realized what he can do with his dick (supposedly around 6-7"") and the skills that he developed in bed. Rejections don't phase him, and he hits on even the hottest girls. Moreover, it seems he has to beat girls off with a stick once he sleeps with them. Right now, he has a gorgeous gf who raves he was the first one to give her a multi-orgasm.   Equipment-wise, 7-8"" is a Porsche-equivalent, and coupled with other elements (e.g. social skills/charm/confidence etc.), could make sex exhilarating for girls. Meanwhile, a Ford Pinto (3-4"") would be a letdown for most girls when they see it, and only be able to go so far with them."

It might make the women more willing to extend the relation because of ""dat dik"" but I doubt it happen that often. It doesn't help you get girls. Some few might get laid by reputation but that's a big(heh) might.   If I was short with a small dick and could choose either to become tall or grow a big dick I think I would choose height because it would result in a better quality of life. Easier to fit in. Not just with women. I'd be insecure about my dick a so many other probably yeah.   Maybe you would do the opposite and that's fine.

bigdickproblems,39t3zr,StickofPurity,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:03:58 2015 UTC,The thing about penis size is that the fact that it's hidden makes it harder to deal with.  Short guys have to deal with being short all the time.  Everyone immediately knows that they're short.  But this actually lets them develop a thicker skin in some cases... they become desensitized to it.  It's different for small penis guys since a guy is lucky to screw 5 chicks in a year.  Maybe the best strategy for small dick guys would be to sleep with a bunch of different prostitutes until they got used to the fact that some women are going to be hard on them and learn to pay attention to the ones that enjoy it.

I used to think that it was a good thing that my penis was hidden from the public, but now I'm not so sure. Now I wonder if it might be better just to tell girls about my size beforehand, so that they don't get disappointed and I don't waste my time.   My friend is in the short / big penis camp. He used to be anxious about approaching girls in the past. Now, he has no qualms hitting on even the hottest girl. And with good reason - girls go crazy for him after he sleeps with them, and rave about his size/abilities in bed.  When we were younger (we are childhood friends), he used to be envious of my height. Now, he probably feels sorry for me when I tell him about my girl problems. How the tables have turned."

It's often hard to find clothes that fit properly. You're limited in what you can drive because you just don't fit in some vehicles, and there are others you can fit in, but not comfortably. You have to watch your head a lot. Sometimes you don't fit in bathroom stalls. You're more prone to health problems, especially musculoskeletal ones, as well as cancer.

I'm a touch taller than Hondahater but I feel the same as him - we're at the bottom end of Proper Tall.  At our height we can still (mostly) fit into clothes, beds, cars, seats, tables etc from normal stores if we do a bit of shopping around. Anyone taller has to go to specialty stores or get things custom made. The car I drive is especially roomy so I'm quite comfortable in it, but I physically can drive my wife's little daihatsu without devastating problems. An inch taller and it would be almost impossible.  (Which goes on to a fairly under reported tall problem. In tight spaces like car seats, on long journeys, people normally fidget around - they sit up, sit to the side, sit back, sit to the side again, sit forward, sit back. It prevents getting sore. Tall people often just have the one position they can select, hopefully it's one that can be maintained because it's the position you're stuck with.)  There are benefits like increased alcohol tolerance because there's just more places to put the grog, but on the flip side it takes more food to get through the day - when I'm being ""good"" I aim to stay under 2200 calories/day which is actually still quite a lot of food to acquire each day. You'd rather feed me for a day than a week is what I'm saying.  There's a lot of cool stuff about being tall, but it does have its own proper negative aspects.

I'm not mad.  But seriously on the question - there's a near constant implication that being taller is always better. Well. Being taller almost always sucks more than it helps.  People say ""you can reach more things"". No, I can reach LESS things. I haven't washed a dish or turned on a tap or cut food on a kitchen bench without stooping painfully since I was fourteen. I bang my knees on tables, I have legitimate airline legroom issues (my theory is that it's only fairly-tall people who bitch about legroom because it's the only time off their life it's ever really an issue, whereas actually-tall people never sit somewhere that they don't have some kind of legroom complication). Every chair I sit in is designed to support the spine of someone with a torso six inches shorter than mine. Every group conversation happens a foot below me. Every bed is designed for midgets. Every safety rail banister is below my hip height (meaning that my center of gravity would tumble right over it whereas everyone else would have to jump to fall over).   I'm not even that tall . I'd call myself at the bottom end of properly tall (6'6""). The people I know taller than myself I genuinely feel sorry for.  Having a big dick is a big problem in one small part of your life. Being tall is a little problem in almost every aspect of your life - you don't actually do that much top-shelf reaching in day to day life, which is about the only thing it's useful for.  I would much rather be average height with a statistically corresponding big dick than above average height with a correspondingly small dick."

At the top of the AFBF website they only have three links, those being Home, FAQs and Condoms, click on the Condoms link, and surprise it only mentions TheyFit. In short it is very probable that AFBF is run by the same people who run TheyFit this is so to get around the size limit set by the FDA. Also note that shipping using AFBF towards the US/Canada, cost about same price as shipping to the rest of Europe. Given all that, I wouldn't believe that using AFBF poses no more risks than direct shipping would, I mean it might be even possible that when you give theyfit a forwarding address, they might just ship directly.

AFBF, in my mind, is a classic example of a shell corperation which is being used in this case to protect theyfit condoms from legal consequences of smuggling condoms illegally into countries they're not legally permitted for sale.   Basically theyfit condoms would love to sell their condoms worldwide, but they know pissing off the FDA by smugging condoms into the US without approval is a bad idea and can sink the whole company.  So someone at theyfit has a friend or family member make this company called a few bucks forward.  So all this friend/family member does is buy a domain name, a server, and some postal boxes.  Then theyfit ships their condoms to these postal boxes.  Then, legally, it's AFBF that made the product available in the US at their customers request, and not theyfit condoms, making it harder for the FDA to do anything.

That chart was based on ~900 self reported sizes on the internet. Anything self reported is automatic garbage.  Plenty of studies have shown either no correlation with height, or only a very minimal correlation.  As for your actual question:   Are people more likely to think of you as huge if you have a big dick but are shorter height wise, rather than a tall guy with a big dick just seeming proportional?   Why do you think porn actors are so short? Mandingo is like 5'6""-5'7"" if I'm not mistaken. It's to make it all look bigger.  So yes, a big dick on a small frame is going to appear bigger than on a large frame.

I worry about if the girl I'm with likes my size, feels satisfied with it, has good orgasms with me, likes to fuck with me and is not wishing to go and try other guys to find a bigger one. If all these check then it's a relief and I really don't care about other sizes. That's what makes me feel like a man.

However, I am very glad to be here and here is why:  I was married for years to a hating, cheating, lying (etc., this isn't about her, for once) individual who always put me down, about everything. At first, I was very attentive to her needs in the sack but as time went on, her true personality came out, attraction on both sides was lost. She never really thought I had a BD; in fact would say the opposite, to the point of getting personal and hurting feelings, as well as ridiculing certain sides of my sexuality. Not good.   Now, I am divorced and have a new GF, who I have known for years and is very sexual as am I, who says I am huge. At first, I had to be very careful to not hurt her while having sex (quite the opposite of my previous relationship), and my new partner wanted to measure my member (MMM, maybe?). If she is measuring correctly, which it looked like she was, I am 9"" long and some change and 5"" or 6"" around (I would have to ask her if I am right about the girth measurement). This subreddit leads me to believe that I am rather on the large side? I don't have a ""big head"" if I do; have had a rather generous number of sexual partners (both attractive and some as ugly as homemade fuck), some of which said I was ""biiig"" as well as some who didn't say anything positive or negative about my size at all. My new GF has been with me throughout the process of getting sober, and witnessed how beneficial that process is to getting a boner.   Anyways, any feedback is appreciated.

bigdickproblems,39n1jp,GadflyIII,3,Sat Jun 13 08:57:20 2015 UTC,Lube and alot of foreplay are good to start with..   It comes down to the positions really.. You could try to ride him and only take in as much as you can. You could grab his dick at the base with one hand if you're in missionary position.. You just need to think out of the box with these things.   Girth is more difficult to deal with though. You can always try to use toys to stretch you out during foreplay. He can spread out his fingers inside of you and try to stretch you out a bit more than usual. I don't think there are many more ways to deal with girth. You just need to get a bit more stretched out.

bigdickproblems,39n1jp,TheOldTitLicker,2,Sat Jun 13 20:34:42 2015 UTC,"Downward curve helps. There are two spots to look up:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_fornix_erogenous_zone  And the posterior fornix.   Posterior fornix is what you want if you're wanting to be able to bottom out.  Doggy style is the common position for this. She can lean over more to change your angle of attack in her vagina so instead of you going directly into cervix, you're going under it.  Spooning position should also work, but dat ass should give you some cushion so you can't bottom out as easily.  Your results will vary, but trying to hit certain spots means you will have to learn her vagina and what it handles.  Note that some girls get nauseous from that spot being stimulated.  Reality is that there isn't much else you can do. If you can't find a position to help you miss the cervix, you're going to have to exert self control and not bottom out.  Tldr: look up posterior fornix in this subreddit. Also google about a spot, and p spot."

Before I learned about my need of a different than standard condom size, I had a quite long time of difficulty maintaining an erection while initiating and having vaginal intercourse and the best solution was just laughing/shrugging it of together and trying again and/or something else.

Him putting pressure on you to perform is probably making your issues worse.  You on the other hand are really going the extra mile.  If you want tips on your end   more then 10 minutes of foreplay.  I know you're already using it, but keep using lube. Pre-foreplay, try doing something romantic like a dinner before the event, or whatever you like. Get into a completely relaxed environment where orgasm for the guy/girl isn't the goal free of stress.  Get all the things you need to do done, clean your room, pay your bills, get rid of all of lifes worries first.  This is where your boyfriend is really dropping the ball, by setting a sort of deadline, it makes you more anxious and more likely to rush things, which makes sex harder. Use positions where you can put your thighs in the way to control the depth of penetration, and woman on top positions where you control speed.  Or at least get the guy to follow the womans directions for speed/depth. ""Practice"" at home.  The vagina tends to adapt to whatever is put inside of it regularly.  One of the treatments for vaginismus (you don't have this) is using vaginal dialators of increasing size over time.   There is the possibility that yes, the parts may really just not fit, and you guys might not be sexually compatable.  But your boyfriend isn't even giving your relationship a fair shot, and honestly seems to be actively making things worse by putting you under pressure."

You're rolling the dice going in unprotected.  I'd only commit to unprotected intercourse if I've been in a relationship for many months (and that's still not great advice).  I'll also second the comments about this guy being a jerk.  You mentioned athlete and being endowed.  He knows he can get whatever he wants- he's a jock and has a huge dong.  I'd be noping my way out of there.  Second the comments, too, about him being so selfish (going back to the stage you set).  We don't have a lot of info to work with, but this guy sounds like he knows what he's doing and is using you.  I'd be advising someone in your position to find someone who maybe is willing to work a little harder for it instead of demanding you mold to him.  Relationships (and sex) contain compromises and are between two people.  Look for someone who will treat you as a friend and equal; not just a fuck hole.  I'm married and I don't always have an orgasm when the wife and I are intimate.  There are times when I get BJs and there is no reciprocation (time/situation/etc.) from my part- so I don't mind if we're doing our thing, she climaxes, and just wants to cuddle/sleep.  I can always go finish myself off if it's really that bad- but honestly I'm more about making her happy than focusing on my dick and orgasm alone."

Sometimes people can be awesome for each other mentally/emotionally and just not be a good physical fit.   Usually it is differences in sexual appetite/kinks, but physical size can matter too.  I've had to end relationships because we couldn't have enjoyable sex.   I was too big and she was a small person and it sucks feeling like you're hurting the person you're having sex with (unless you're a sadist in which case I guess it is awesome?).    We had to break up because we just weren't sexually compatible.  Had the same thing with another woman I dated years later that was the exact opposite.   She'd had a couple kids and despite my size, I felt like I was fucking air.    Just wasn't satisfying and there wasn't anything that was going to fix that (short of surgery on her end).  Sexual satisfaction matters, to everyone (men and women) and is key for long-term relationship success.   So if it doesn't fit, you're better moving on EARLIER than LATER.

At the very least though, if you two just do not work size-wise and were friends first, I would think he'd be willing to go back to being friends.  I have a number of friends I wouldn't mind a chance with (as I am sure most/all guys do), and if things didn't fit with time, I'd still be cool with going back to what we had before (since sex was now off the table)."

Continuing this trend he'll expect you to cater to him all the time, whether you like it or not; personally I think a relationship shouldn't be one-sided and both parties should want to be in it.  Just because you have a big dick doesn't mean you have to act like one."

bigdickproblems,39f89p,Brightt,6,Thu Jun 11 16:25:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering. Was just wondering what role your big dick had in her being a FWB - whether it was more direct (e.g. she really likes big dicks) or more indirect (just part of what made the sex good).
bigdickproblems,39f89p,tommen_the_great,3,Thu Jun 11 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"It played no role at all. The reason we started sleeping is, like I said, complicated, but I guess I'll try to give a TL;DR of it.  We went to high school together, as did her boyfriend and my ex (who was my girlfriend at the time). She was very good friends with my ex, and her boyfriend is one of my best friends. Both our couples had been together for around 5 years, when both my ex and her boyfriend left the country for studies. Both me and my ex and she and her bf had decided that we would open up our relationships while the other one was abroad.  So, me and her were living literally less than 5m apart, both lonely because our other half was halfway around the world, and both horny as hell. She came over to sleep next to me once, because she was kinda lonely. Nothing happened that night, but the second night she came over we had sex.  My ex is a very jealous person, but eventually, she made her peace with me sleeping with her friend. My friend said it was uneasy at first, but he'd rather it was a friend he knows and trusts than some random douchebag (though she did sleep with a couple of random douchebags), and we're all still friends.  It eventually ended because the girl constantly felt guilty for sleeping with me. Both because she felt like she was betraying her friend (though my ex had stated she was fine with it), and because I think she was starting to like sex with me a bit too much, which made her feel guilty towards her boyfriend.  She never confirmed that last bit, but there are several reasons why I think it's the case. She's a high libido, while her bf is a low libido. I was high libido too. I have quite a bit of stamina, while I know for a fact that she complained quite a bit to my ex about her bf not lasting very long. She also didn't like foreplay when we first started, or so she said. But from several things she said, I figured out she didn't like it because her boyfriend was bad at it. I ended up telling her all the things I do, and how I do it, so she could communicate them with her bf better. But, she started liking foreplay quite a bit before it ended.  I wanna add to that though that I don't think size had much, or anything, to do with her liking sex with me so much.  I don't blame her though, it must have felt terrible. The only thing that pissed me off is how, after we stopped sleeping together, she continuously came over to my room to complain about her lousy one night stands (which I usually was able to hear quite clearly), and say how sex with me was way better."

I just hope she was able to communicate the things she likes with him better, so he can up his game. He doesn't have to know those tips came from me, she slept with a bunch of guys when he was away.  In hindsight, it was kind of a fucked up situation. We were sleeping together, and he came over for the holidays. We literally had had sex less than 24 hours before he came home. Then, the next day, he came over to a party with her and a bunch of our mutual friends (not many of my friends know, even to this day), and my best friend knew. At one point, we were sitting, smoking a joint, and she was sitting in between me and her bf.

It is hard to separate one from the other, and you can’t have one without the other in some instances.  For instance:   Hiding your big dick in public may be a legitimate problem. But what about something like: “a girl saw my dick by accident - now keeps teasing me about it.”  Stretching - again a problem. However, what if you add more detail like: “girl I hooked up with blaming me because she now has trouble with small guys- says she won’t have sex with me again.” Having trouble finding condoms - a real problem. Now adding more detail, e.g. “In China, having trouble finding condoms” may be a humble brag, but may also be adding legitimate information. Girls only using you as a sex toy may be a legitimate problem (for some guys). But would adding: “gf really liked sex. Now demands sex non-stop” be not okay? Meanwhile: Touching toilet water - perhaps a legitimate problem. I actually thought that these were a joke.   Having a big dick is a mixed blessing.

A guy with a small dick who has mad skills is still going to outperform a guy with a big dick who has no idea what he's doing.  The thing is, when skill is equal, I doubt many girls will choose the smaller guy over the bigger guy. Though this entirely depends on how big we're talking. There will still be girls that will choose the smaller guy, because some girls prefer smaller, but they're a minority.  The bottom line is that most girls don't care all that much when it comes down to it, as long as you're in the range of normal and you know what you're doing. Sure, some might care, but they are usually very superficial types that I wouldn't want to come near anyway.  People always tell the smaller guys to 'get good at oral' or something, which I get is kind of insulting, but for me personally, foreplay is very much part of my game. I fucking love foreplay. Watching the other person squirming around with joy, be it from oral or finger play. Making them cum before you even started the actual sex.

It's not just that people are being overly positive about their BDs, it's just that pretty much everything that is making it to the top recently are positive stories about very sexually charged experiences. You just aren't hearing from guys who are better at Magic the Gathering then dating and just can't get any luck with girls, or even more modest brags like someone talking about how sex with his wife was really working out now, or actual bigdickproblems.  I'm hoping the problem is going to resolve itself to a degree before we step in and take moderator action. People are discussing the issue in meta threads, if people just decide to start downvoting these unrealistic stories and upvoted more actual bigdickproblems, that would fix the problem and in a much more sustainable and drama free way then the endless removal of posts by mods/dodging of rules by humblebraggers.  It's always better to try and fix a problem through upvotes/downvotes/community participation then to hide them with removals, especially noting there is a silent majority that seems to LIKE the humblebrag posts, considering they keep getting upvoted to the moon."

In your fabricated story: ""My Big Dick Problem"", the guy couldn't even have sex due to incompatibility. Bragging aside, how is that not a problem? Even in instances where the sex is terrible, guys can at least claim ""doesn't matter, had sex"". This guy can't even do that.   I actually think the bragging does enrich the story in some cases. In your case, it antagonized the story teller, so that what happened to him in the end - while sucky for the guy - seemed like a justified resolution."

And when all of society tells you, your identity as a male is inherently tied to this..and sometimes the shame it can bring upon yourself, the pressure it can bring into the sack, the blows to your self esteem making you skiddish and unconfident (thus even less manly).. all that weight can hurt your performance to boot. So now you're underperforming in 2 places.   This is ultimately a different problem you're dealing with here. It wouldn't disappear the moment you have a big dick/you're tall/whatever.  You'd think the anxiety ends at that point, right? Surely guys with big dicks shouldn't feel inferior and inadequate? Nope. The same thing happens that tends to people who get cosmetic surgery, unless they have some serious defect. You find something else to worry about.  You can look at Ted Kaczynski. Highly intelligent, highly attractive when young. That should be a recipe for success in theory. In practice however, he was insanely insecure and it ruined his entire life. He was too insecure to talk to girls. He pretty much based his entire self-worth on some woman from his youth who told him he's quite attractive after he asked her. He tried to get a sex change because he couldn't bear living as a man. Eventually he felt so angry at society that he started sending bombs to people.  Hence why I try to stay out of literal circlejerks like this, because it's not productive. If I spend my entire life trying to base my self-worth on what went right at birth, I end up not accomplishing anything else in life, which is sadly the way things seem to be heading. Which is the other message in this cartoon. All these guys accomplished something in life. The guy with the big dick simply sits in his mom's basement reading /r/bigdickproblems.   Last thing i will say - is i've befriended enough women to know how girls talk about finding out some guy has a big dick, versus how they talk (even when they're sympathetic) to finding out their man has a ""micro-penis"".   Yeah, about that. You're feeding your own unhealthy mentality, by seeking out people who will tell you what you already believe. You go out and find the type of women who are into big dicks, then you see that all women like big dicks and you feel like shit. I go out and find spoiled japs, then I find that they don't want me because I'm not rich, then I conclude that all girls are into rich guys.   Believe it or not, there are even mixed race people out there who become part of the far right, just so they can sit around and listen to angry white males who never accomplished anything in life proclaim that Northern Europeans are superior humans, because it validates their own feelings of inferiority.

Condoms are measure by what is known as the nominal width (in mm), this is the width of the condom's opening when laid flat, ie the half the circumference.   This sizing is required by regulations in europe to be written on the box (and since brands cross sell in other nations, they just write it on all boxes).

To be fair, if you have self control, it might not be a problem for the woman, but it might still be a problem for the man.  Not being able to go all the way in, thus not touching pelvises is a real turn off for me. Though I've only had that problem on a regular basis with my ex. Some girls have been cervix punched by me, but that's usually when I'm really trying to get as deep as possible.  Also, the concept is not really based on women's ability to guess sizes. It's more based on discussions from members in regards to running into trouble. The idea is that members that are between 6.5"" and 7.5"" still run into cervix trouble every so often, but it's usually girl-dependent. While guys that are topping the 8"" range can expect to have that kind of problem quite often.  Same goes with girth. Guys in the 5-6"" range still can experience girth issues, like toothy blowjobs and condom trouble, but most of those issues are usually manageable. While guys that are in the 6""+ range usually run into trouble a lot more often.  That's where the idea came from, basically.

To be fair, from my sexual experience, that's highly dependent on the girl you're sleeping with.  I've had girls who can't come, no matter how much effort I put in. They'll plateau just before orgasm, and just stay there.  I've had girls who'll come the entire goddamn time. Which is charming in a way, but gets annoying very fast. Especially when you've been going for so long she actually goes numb and tells you to stop.  I've also had girls who can come, but not always, etc.  I've always been told I'm good at what I do, but if there's anything that I've learned, it's that orgasm or lack thereof is not the only testament of your skill.

In my experience, it's as deep as it needs to be, within an upper limit that is different for every girl and independent of body size otherwise. So, if I use 5 inches, I hit the end at 5 inches. If I use6, I hit the end at 6. If I use 8, I hit the end at 8, and so on. But some girls in some positions never get deeper than 6, 7, or 8 inches.   Tl;dr: As with all else, it depends."

If the study also focused on 1000 from the US, then it doesn't matter how big each country is...each is 50% of the study.

If you really can't then then run the ruler along the top of your dick until you hit the base. Depending on your BF add anywhere from 1/8th to 1/4 of an inch to adjust for the fat-pad. You can narrow that down a bit by measuring the depth of your stomach fat pad by pressing the ruler in when you're soft and taking a relative reading of how far the ruler goes in.   If you legitimately can't pull your dick down due to an erection you should really get on stretching those ligaments or you're going to have a hell of a time with sex down the road.

bigdickproblems,391f2f,SPAZZEH,27,Wed Jun 10 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"Hey bud,  Thanks for making this post. I'm gonna talk for a little bit.  This is what it looks like when we fail. I'm sorry to lose you dude. That's on me.   I actually just spent a little writing something on this so I'm gonna borrow some of that.  Basically, this shit is hard. This isn't me asking you to have pity for the mods because that isn't really on you. As a user, you really shouldn't have to give a shit about mods having a hard time handling things. With that in mind, I want to give some background. One of the biggest things we struggle with on the day to day is trying to find a good balance between content the sub wants to see vs. content that's bringing it down. There have been lots of good examples of this -- the memes, the jelqing conversations, the size queens, the humble brags, the rogers of the world. Shit's not easy.   There are a couple of philosophies we've been trying to hold to as far as the sub goes. For one thing I'm not gonna just remove posts because I think they're bad. I don't have the time, energy, or dictatorial spirit to do that. I mean when it comes to the actual structure of the subreddit's rules and policies I guess I am something resembling a despot but for the most part I let people run free. The only time I actually feeling like getting off my padded chair and doing something is when that thing is affecting the overall health of the subreddit--and I think this is a genuinely good thing. For the most part y'all are a collection of pretty calm folks and can self-manage. When shit happens, we come up and deal with it.  So here's the shitty bit: What do you do when your subreddit wants something that may be bad for it? At the end of the day no matter what choice we make we're shafting some part of our membership. Here's something that might even be harder: How do you define a boundary where its clear what's allowed and what's not allowed when you've got the subtle and not so subtle complexities of the english fucking language to deal with. Whatever rule gets made is gonna have some people trying to dodge it with clever wording. The less clear the rules, the more people will argue when moderators take action and aint nobody got time for that.  So as a sub we've got a couple of options. The simplest way of handling it is to basically give mods full discretionary powers over what's allowed and what's not. I mean honestly we have that already but as part of our scout's code we don't use those powers. People don't tend to like subreddits where that happens (see /r/leagueoflegends). As far as I'm concerned I'm a pretty chill motherfucker and I'm not gonna use my powers for evil but hey, who knows what'll happen with my eventual successor. I don't want to see some game of thrones shit if/when I finally leave.   The other option which is what we're sort of dealing with now is to let stuff happen until it becomes a big enough issue to get involved in and then handle it. Obviously this isn't perfect but I'd say it's worked relatively well so far. But that's just like, my opinion, man. There are nearly 30 thousand of you folks and most of you probably have something resembling an opinion. Send us suggestions on modmail or some shit. Reply to this comment. Start up other posts like this. This is your soapbox. Clearly OP's expressed their opinion. If you're okay with us shoving the dial a little bit more on the risque side of moderation heavy handedness say so and we'll go ahead and loosen our trigger fingers a little bit.   Here's what I see likely happening.  We'll hunker down and start removing more of the shitposts. We'll have a definition of shitpost that doesn't match with some peeps and we'll then adjust our definition of shitpost. It'll be a little messy and we'll basically make it up as we go along but we'll probably be okay. As part of the process this means we'll be tightening up the rules to try to get at what it is about these shitposts that makes them particularly smelly.   It's not great, but it's what I've got so far for writing at nearly 1 A.M. How's that sound?  Gate."
bigdickproblems,391f2f,DBP_21,10,Tue Jun 9 04:41:07 2015 UTC,"I'll note here that I ALREADY WAS hunkering down and removing the ""my coworkers can see my bulge"" posts.  I removed one of post  less then two weeks ago, got told ""the mods are insane.""and got five downvotes. It's nice to have positive feedback like this because I'm the most prudish mod and it's nice to see removals of those sorts of posts are still appreciated.  This is actually the first bit of positive feedback I've gotten in awhile after a wall of negative feedback for removing some of the posts you described. I am definitely the most prudish mod and have been responsible for a lot of the removals of bulge pics on this subreddit.    I should note the moderation is loose for a very good reason as well.  And that's simply that the moderators don't have the power to remove enough posts to ensure every post is high quality.  Trying to stop people from posting their bulges, dicks, and bragging is an endless battle.  The fact people can skirt the rules by say, changing a big dick brag into a big dick problem is pretty much intended by the moderators, our hope isn't to stop people from bragging, it's to make the person who wants to brag think about making their post in a more palatable way.  For example, when we remove a ""My coworkers can see my bulge"" thread, we don't tell the person to leave the subreddit and never come back, we just ask them to submit the same thread without a picture.  This not only helps avoid threads like these, but it helps the OP himself because when OP does post a bulge picture, the thread derails into people bitching about the bulge picture or talking about how big OPs bulge is.  Ultimately, we feel the only viable long term solution for getting rid of braggarts and such is community downvoting.  We can't do much more other then giving people a kick in the right direction.  We really don't believe in removing posts like ""peeing with a boner"" regardless of the mods opinion of them.  I think that's too heavy handed and IMO would be an abused power.  I've honestly been enforcing the rules pretty tightly recently anyways.  Probably the only posts recently I've been letting slide recently is posts like ""has a girl ever told you you're the best she's ever had"" type threads because I got the impression the community wanted them and NOBODY reported any of them.  If I see a bunch of reports for them maybe this will change though.    I'd definitely say the biggest change in the subreddit hasn't been a gradual decline, it's literally been summer vacation.  We're seeing WAY more traffic now.  It's worse in some ways but I think you might be overestimating the decline of the subreddit, for months on end you would come to the sub and the only new post would be ""What size condoms do I need?"".  Now that it's more active there is more original content and more shitposting.  Also, for all you guys are saying about how more posts have to be removed, you guys aren't reporting very much.  The report queue is empty right now.  I'm not sure how I can enforce the rules that much tighter then I am right now without rule changes though.  It's not really fair for me to remove a post technically allowed by the rules."
bigdickproblems,391f2f,SidewaysGate,5,Tue Jun 9 15:17:27 2015 UTC,"Good to see your thoughts on this.  Some thoughts I had while I was away:   One of the biggest things we struggle with on the day to day is trying to find a good balance between content the sub wants to see vs. content that's bringing it down. There have been lots of good examples of this -- the memes, the jelqing conversations, the size queens, the humble brags, the rogers of the world.    I'd never encourage just outright removing posts that you consider 'bad', but I do enjoy the image macros to a certain extent and the other wacky threads that we've seen.  My biggest issues with this sub are the humble-brag posts or the posts that are just the dumbest questions that border on shit-posts. Also those pictures of people in jeans showing their package or those obnoxious 'last night' text screencaps. To deal with these doesn't seem terribly hard if we implement a definition of shitpost, as you suggest.   If you're okay with us shoving the dial a little bit more on the risque side of moderation heavy handedness say so and we'll go ahead and loosen our trigger fingers a little bit.   I didn't intend to suggest you guys get heavy-handed. I figured more involvement in a different way would contribute to the health of this community.  This sub is bound to get a lot of the same questions over time as it grows, but a few other subs I like have a simple approach to that: specific days during the week with a stickied thread that is dedicated to user questions that might even be answered in the side-bar. It keeps the general number of question posts down and is easy to find later if you wanted to refer to it for some reason; it wouldn't be titled ""me irl"" etc. /r/guns has ""Moronic Monday""; /r/watches has a daily ""what's on your wrist"" thread to discourage lower-quality submissions cluttering the front page.

Trying to solve that issue through bans and post removals doesn't work.  The issue with the days of the week threads idea is that the type of poster most likely to post a bulge/dick pic/shitpost is the least likely to wait for a weekly thread.  Also to an extent I -have- been encouraging general threads, I've been much more keen to remove a thread that's bragging about a single story then one that actually asks the community to go and submit their own content.  Look at some of the lines of the threads that have flown past the radar this week -   ""Have you made a good girl go bad?""  ""How many of your friends know about your big secret?""  ""Girl that I had sex with in college, told me that she still masturbates to our old sex, any one have similar experiences? ""  (not in title) ""Has your girlfriends (or their friends) been competitive about whose partner has the bigger penis?""  (not in title) ""Have you had instances where a girl whom you really like (and is your girlfriend) was seemingly together with you only for the sex?""  Just FYI, not a single person reported any of these threads.    It's not that these were the only humblebrag threads that were submitted, it's that these are some of the only ones I didn't remove.  My thinking is that I'm never going to be able to completely stop people from humblebragging, so I should at least encourage threads that keep it in one place."

Also from personal experience BD guys can often be/come across as very emotionally stunted(having a small one can do this too, but it manifet itself differently), like they never really grew out of having the mind of a teenager/fratboy. Quite Peter Pan like & thick as shit. Its like they've invested so much stock in thier big cock, are so self-obsessed with it, are inthralled by it & full of themselves they forgot to grow mentally, forgot or never really realized there's more to life and there's more that decides the measure of a man(no pun) than simply his cock size.  I think what this sub shows is just how much of an oxymoron the so called ""problems"" part of BDP actually is. It also shows how having a big cock can breed some seriously self-absorbed, arrogant highly egotistical narcissists. Though having said all that it was inevitable that a sub centered around big dicks would turn, decsend into what it has eventually :/. Your spot on with your analysis i'll say. I agree with you too."
bigdickproblems,391f2f,Very_Sharpe,-1,Mon Jun 8 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"Like they've invested so much stock, put so much (misplaced) pride & have so much of thier cultral ideas masculinity & superiority tied up in thier big cock that they can't separate thier being from it.   Haha, this has nothing to do with cock-size. this kind of ""Hey everyone, this sub sucks. it's not like it used to be. I'm moving on, bye...."" and the people chiming in defending it happens all over reddit. it happens on every web forum, facebook group, etc.  you can see it in all the default subs, and you can see it in a lot of the bigger non-default subs."

I can definitely see your point about some people who ask stupid questions or fake braggy posts but that right there is the internet. And to be honest, I hear a lot of noise about ""stop bragging"" by people who have a flair written up on their name and are posting on a sub that pretty much states, 'oh I have so many problems because of my huge schlong'. If not this then this sub would simply be a list of 10+ posts that people could just read to find what they need and no new posts would exist.   And besides, all else said and done, it's just a fucking internet forum, I don't understand how people actually care enough to get hurt, offended etc. Can anyone say that there are websites that have 100% content that they like, with zero chaff?

bigdickproblems,391f2f,TheEnlightenedDick,3,Tue Jun 9 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"They started it as a joke, but celebrated that people were able to have serious discussion.   /u/sidewaysgate has always supported this community in operating with minimal influence by mods anyways, so what they think isn't really that relevant."
bigdickproblems,391f2f,mydadmightbegay,3,Tue Jun 9 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"My inquiring lies moreso in the idea that this sub was originally meant for discussion.

bigdickproblems,391f2f,The-Commandant,2,Tue Jun 9 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"Again, the mods have divorced their original vision of the sub from what it should be.

Well we also had serious discussions in mind, but we mostly just wanted to make dick jokes. A year later and well... we've done things, Gentlemen. Good things, I think. There are actually people here, a collection of people which form (dare I say it) a community.""  -/u/SidewayGate (founder)   How the mods intended it is not relevant. You can't dispute that it's not intended for serious discussion when the vast majority of people have upvoted this post.  Hell, I didn't even know people felt this way. Based on the popular posts recently, it seemed everyone was in favor of the image/meme posts (which many people supported banning years ago).

bigdickproblems,391f2f,TheEnlightenedDick,20,Mon Jun 8 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"Moreover, there's no clear line that separates what is a big dick problem, and what is not.  There's seldom a humble-brag post that is all about bragging. Most of the time, it chronicles some troubles encountered along the way as well.  Same with what you would consider to be a bona fide bdp. ""Condoms don't fit me very well"" may be a legitimate problem (even according to op), but others may view it as bragging. In fact, I have heard many times: ""if a guy says to you that a condom is too small, he is bragging because a condom can accommodate penis of all sizes"".  It all goes to the crux of the matter, which is that a big dick is a mixed blessing that entails intertwined stories of failures and triumphs.  PS: That said, some of the posts I have seen have been truly asinine. But I think you get those at every sub, no?"
bigdickproblems,391f2f,CreamyCoffee,6,Mon Jun 8 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"""Condoms don't fit me very well"" may be a legitimate problem (even according to op),   I've experienced this issue myself, so I know it's a legitimate BDP, and you are right, I was alluding to it in my OP.

I'm subscribed to a lot of ""dumb"" subreddits, but even the over-the-top ones don't get me saying ""Oh, come on!"" at nearly half the posts I see. This sub is particularly bad in that regard"
bigdickproblems,391f2f,TheEnlightenedDick,5,Mon Jun 8 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"True. But I think it's hard to be as stringent with the posts here.  In a way, having a big dick problem intrinsically is a farce. One might ask, how is ANY problem legitimate when many guys would rather stay with the big dick and the said problem, rather than have an average penis.  So I think the very nature of the problem itself tends to invite the loons who take it over the top. That - combined with clueless kids who are obsessed with sex."

bigdickproblems,391f2f,CreamyCoffee,6,Tue Jun 9 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, is that there are not too many big dick problems, condoms being the most important one, considering self safety and accidental pregnancy prevention, hurtful sex is another problem, and big bulges is more of a social/self assurance problem. All others such as touching toilet bowls are more of a humorus aspect, except ofcourse some weird exceptions. Now I thing a teenager or young adult might be having some difficulty with condoms or having sex first few times, where are they gonna refer to? right here duh!!! and you might think one can simply search for an answer or read a whole chart of sizing or something like that, problem is one can get confused and overwhelmed with information, so better still then a search is a direct question covering exactly what needs to be known, if you please and if in the mood, all you have to do is provide with a suitable answer.

I do occasionally hurt my GF, but as long as I'm careful it's all good.  I wouldn't want to be any bigger, seems like a lot more problems come with that."

Even though there are people bigger than us, it's so rare that most of our partners will never see one, so, still impressive to them. Also most people in this sub with over 8"" are lying.  I'd say it's nice to have a BD without BDP but my girth is very problematic condom-wise."

bigdickproblems,3943kw,unthused,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say, in terms of relationships and generally enjoyable complication-free sex, you're probably around the ideal size. Still above average, but without most of the more disruptive issues from the far end of the scale.   You may not have size queens chasing you or get superficial compliments about going into porn, but as far as your partner's comfort, are probably better off."

The base is 4.9"" at best(though that's the minimum, it only gets bigger from there). I'd like it if when I'm not rock hard like when I'm about to cum, if I was a full 7"" rather than 6.8"". Sometimes I'm just not as hard as possible."

I was more surprised still when they thought it was TOO big.  What I am beginning to realize is that 7"" already is pretty big. Being at 7.5"" already puts you in the 99th percentile - at least according to two of the three studies referenced by hungfun's chart.   So yeah, I am really happy with my size, and wouldn't want to be any bigger."

First , out of curiosity, how big is ur husband exactly, cuz here u mentioned hes 5 inches and in your original post u claimed he was 6. And how big was your biggest lover.  As for your dilemma, you should feel bad. ur not an awweful person. Just because you like a bigger dick doesn't make you bad. Now, cheating on ur husband if you wo are back in a relationship is wrong. You could go ahead and keep on cheating for years on end and stay in the relationship like u mentioned, but you risk being shamed and if your one of those people that has a conscience and feels bad afterwards cuz u cheated and feel dirty, then I would recommend you have a serious talk with ur husband. Tell him what you want. You love to make love to him but you also like casual sex with other men with bigger cocks. That way you come out on top and don't have to cheat. If he cant get used to the idea, then its time to move on. Remember, most people who cheat are eventually caught, so what do you think would be worse, him catching one day and ending the relationship in horrible terms, or ending it cuz u two wanted different things and end it in better terms?   Talk to the man, and tell him about what you want :) Feel more than encourage to reply and ask me as many questions about this. :) ohh and remember to answer my question :)"

They say 25 is when it's all over but they can't be certain that your done growing. So your puberty could end at 21, and still grow, like myself.  It is rare to grow after 21, but it's just a matter of whether or not your growth plates have closed. If they haven't your bones will continue to grow. You can if you really wanted have an operation where the break your legs, separate the bones, put a few screws in and let your bones heal. When they are finished healing you will be taller - however it's an incredibly painful procedure."

What you're really doing is trying to hit a reset button back to the early days of the sub.   There are only a couple of outcomes. One, where that sub goes nowhere and just divides the membership or Two where that sub becomes successful and then eventually just runs into the same issues we've run into here. The people on voat.co aren't going to be inherently different human beings than the folks on reddit. After a certain point of growth the size of a community forces many pieces of that community to lose a common sense of identity/purpose. We can't exactly institute size limits and I don't think we'd want to but the difficulties involved in maintaining a common community philosophy despite your older members dying out / leaving / going inactive are going to be challenging no matter what you do."

I am a busy person, so I don't exactly get action 24 x 7.  I'm lucky I had a good gene pool. I had nothing to do really with what I got downstairs. It's not like I'm 12 x 8 or something massive. 6.5 x 6 is certainly above average length, and definitely above average girth - far from a monster. According to the women I've been with, it's definitely large, but none ran screaming from it. I don't need any special kind of foreplay, and vaginal sex is generally fine. Only tried anal once, and for good reason.   TL;DR It's not about your cock. Think with the right head and it should work out.  EDIT: By looking at your other posts, I see you're young.

bigdickproblems,38zjht,ThkTool,19,Mon Jun 8 04:24:34 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend told me that it was never about the size back when we started dating. After a few months at onr of her friend's party they were talking about one of the other girl's ex boyfriend, saying that he wasn't even that big etc. And how one of the girls would not end up a really toxic relationship because that guy had a big penis.   Now that kind of bothered me not because of the conversation but because my girlfriend was taking part in all of this when she told before me not to worry because size wasn't important. I did not mention anything because the conversation wasn't worth it.  A few months after we were at my place playing some katamari, and she started talking about that other friend that would stay with that mean guy, she told me that he cheated on her friend, that some friends saw him talking shit about the girl, and that he said some really hurtful thing to the girl. My obvios answer was... so did she dumped the guy? She did not. And then my gf told me how she forgave the guy to improve the relationship and whatnot, turns out it was the fourth time that that happened to her friend with that guy. So I told her... well maybe she should seriously think to leave the guy if it's been like that for so long... she interrupted me and told me, but every centimeter counts. Wtf girl, you told me one thing and now turns out you really think another.  So I got mad, and asked so how big do you think I am? Enough? Or maybe a couple of cms short? She went all serious and started saying that with me it doesn't matter, and did not answer any of my questions and got mad because I was over reacting. My confidence went down.  I started thinking that maybe my girl was talking on my back in the same way they were talking about the other guys, I realized she never made any positive remarks on my body and I started feeling worse. After this I was afraid of even bringing up the subject. And compulsively measured my dick every dat for like a month or so. Not smart.  After almost a year of being together that was the end of that. But all this made me unconfortable, so I brought it up again and asked the same questions. So we had a huge fight, but all ended up in she at least accepting her attitude, it was really frustrating hearing her deny everything. Afterwards she told me that she had not talked about me with her friends, but now it hard to believe, it's hard to believe people that changes opinion.  So after we measured my dick, and she was surprised, her ex told her that he was 20cm and was smaller than me(18cm), her other ex that he was 15cm and was way smaller.  Girls can't measure for shit, and other girls won't even make positive comments about guys, it became hard to trust what she said for a while. We worked out all of this, but still I remember that literally al this dick measuring contest is bullshit.  Good thing katamari told me to grow big balls to confront difficult circumstances."
bigdickproblems,38zjht,nd235,8,Mon Jun 8 06:15:05 2015 UTC,"Well 18cm is 7 inches so your all good in the size department. She is most likely lying about talking to her friends about her sex life because it is a huge topic of conversation among women. And if she isn't talking about your penis size with her friends it is because she wants to keep it a secret, girls have been known to break friendships over good looking/well hung men. I mean your gf's friend seems pretty head over heels just because of a BD, your gf is probably afraid that her friend will make a move on you. It does seem strange she wouldn't complement your body while talking about others though."

This isn't an ""issue"" of sexism or anything, I don't mean to sound like I'm accusing you of something like that. There's no ""ism"" here, just some really dumb sounding ""facts.""

I know a lot of girls that would not do anything like that and a lot of guys that wouldn't do the male equivalent but seeing OP's girlfriend taking place in the conversation that her friends all seemed into would make me worried about even if it's not her thing her being peer pressured into the situation.

I looked on hungfun's chart to see what percentile your dick size would be, only to find out that the chart topped out at 8.5 inches. You're off the charts big by a good margin!  Most of the penis size brags that I have heard have been clustered around 7-8 inches (with an occasional 9). Of course, these are claimed sizes, so who knows how big they are in reality.  When girls hear that someone is 10 inches, they probably realize that it could be a legitimately ginormous penis, and not a 6-incher that someone is measuring from the asshole to say that they are 8."

I also forgot to mention that mysize do not offer different lenghts, so you will be best off with theyfit, it will give you less left over material at the base of your penis, meaning that the ""rubber ring"" at the bottom will be more elastic and will be less likely to kill your erections, size O31 which is the shortest lenght (6.3inch) at the largest girth should suit you well, else N31 is the next lenght (7.1inch) would suit you well for the same girth."

bigdickproblems,390yd3,bdsg_,8,Mon Jun 8 13:21:49 2015 UTC,"Orgasming during intercourse for women is more about her than it is about you -- does she know her body well enough to feel what she likes and what she doesn't? is she secure in her body image? is she comfortable around you? etc. And just from my convos with girl-friends, on average that doesn't happen until a girl is in her mid-20's....which I think has a lot to do with why women get more into sex around this time of their lives. Now there are definitely exceptions, some will never be able to have orgasm during sex, some were able to early, it all depends on the girl.   As to whether its rare, I'd say 2/3 can reach orgasm during intercourse, but half of those need clit stimulation at the same time to get the job done.   And in terms of what you can do to maximize the chances of orgasm, I do think having a BD helps, but also lots of foreplay prior to sex and clitoral stimulation during sex.  All that said, the thing I don't get is that even the women that can't orgasm during sex can still really LOVE sex. The girl with the biggest sex appetite I was ever with, only once had an orgasm during sex, and she would still want sex 4-5 times per day."

bigdickproblems,390yd3,forlumbus,5,Mon Jun 8 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell and from everything I've read or heard from women, female orgasms (and, imo, the strongest male orgasms) are a moment of psychological ""letting go"" and totally abandoning yourself to whatever intense physical sensations and emotions are completely overcoming you. So to be able to do that, you need to feel safe and secure -- for some women they feel safe and secure enough by themselves, other women need to feel like their partner is strong enough (not just physically) to be the person to whom they can abandon themselves.  Some women can only do that when they feel like you're completely in control and you've got her and she can just roll around and scream, some women can only do that when they aren't self-conscious (""I can only have an orgasm when I'm having a one night stand because I know nothing matters""), etc etc.  tl;dr I think it's like 80% mental."
bigdickproblems,390yd3,oldseraph,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, all of this. Entirely accurate, and all I can add is this: To answer OP's question, my ""luck"" has been to make about 2/3 (of 50ish ladies) cum from PIV, and most of the ones who did were really difficult to get there. It's like a puzzle, finding exactly the right mood, right moment, right rhythym, and right size for each girl, and no matter how hard I try sometimes she just isn't mentally into it enough. Of the 2/3 who came from PIV, about 1/3 could cum easily, often, and repeatedly, and a few would show really obvious physical signs like squirting or convulsing inside so much that my dick would be squeezed and released harder than her fist could do. This may ne just a coincidence, but I think every single one who came easily was also more into my size than most girls are. Always made me wonder if there was a connection (which, I assume, there is: it makes sense that a girl who likes a large penis feels that way because she can cum from them)."

bigdickproblems,390yd3,caseyjones44,7,Tue Jun 9 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"It's pretty normal for me, but only when I had a partner with a BD. Also important is the tempo (steady and not jackhammering), and the guy's circumference. Long and thin doesn't do it.    I've also read something about the distance between clitoris and vagina being involved, as another commenter mentioned. But there's more to the clitoris than just the visible part - there's an entire internal structure. That must also play a part."
bigdickproblems,390yd3,beard_petter,3,Mon Jun 8 14:13:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I forgot to mention that. Makes sense to me that if the external clitoris is closer then the internal structure likely will be too, so you're stimulating it that way as well. It's thought the g-spot isn't really a structure of it's own, just a point where the clitoris is particularly close to the vaginal wall."
bigdickproblems,390yd3,bdpthrowaway3,3,Mon Jun 8 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"Whenever I have sex, I try to ensure that she finishes before or at the time I finish. Most of the time I'll be able to get her to finish a few times. But occasionally she can't even get close by the time I'm ready to go, and so I try to hold off for a bit, but to no avail.  There's a lot going on chemically, so as long as your partner is satisfied, I wouldn't worry about it too much. I mean, its a good goal to reach for, but don't beat yourself up if you miss it  Like all things with sex, keep good communication, attempt to satisfy both parties needs, and you'll be good"
bigdickproblems,390yd3,bigdickaltaccount,2,Mon Jun 8 16:20:03 2015 UTC,"Personally all have (or at least claim to, and have given me no reason to doubt them), but there's too much going on to pin it down to something as simple as penetration, and my experience is too limited to say every woman I fuck definitely will. Could just be lucky so far.  Did read something recently that stated a correlation between orgasm from penetration and the distance between vagina and clitoris (shorter being better). If that's all there is to it then the maxim of bigger being better kind of makes sense, as a fully stretched vagina is only going to shorten that distance further, making clitoral stimulation easier.  Ultimately I think orgasm is more a brain thing than a physical thing, there's too many reasons why someone will or won't get there for it to be simply a code that can be cracked."

Basically jumped right into sex, no foreplay, even kept going after cumming... she was enjoying but it wasn't an orgasm.

bigdickproblems,38zqml,cloudsofstrife,2,Mon Jun 8 05:13:10 2015 UTC,I haven't seen any study on width.  I think the difficulty lies in the measurement methodology on determining the width measurement of a cylinder type shape.  A girth measurement is fairly easy to make and standardize while a standardized methodology for width seems extremely difficult.

bigdickproblems,38w69l,iAmHidingHere,34,Sun Jun 7 09:51:56 2015 UTC,"I think you probably shouldn't speak about your penis' size before she has seen it.  A) because girls are notoriously bad at judging size from numbers (why so many girls think 10 inch dicks are the best, when they've probably never had more than a 7"").  B) It never helps you with anything. what would she do with the information? If she tells you 'my pussy is 6"" deep', you're not gonna be like ""yeah imma fuck her so hard"" either. I think it has helped me maybe once to humblebrag about my size, but that time she was already very interested so it wouldn't have mattered.  Also, you should really try to meet girls in real life. Chatting is easy and safe, but rarely pays off. Try inviting her out for some pair activity, like tennis or mini golf or something!"
bigdickproblems,38w69l,Primital,7,Sun Jun 7 10:41:09 2015 UTC,"I know, I really regret it now, but I'm trying to make the best of the situation.  I've tried meeting girls in real life, but I freeze up whenever I'm around girls I like. I'm also not that much into looks, so it takes a lot of talking to figure out which girls I actually like, and socialising isn't one of my stronger skills, though I'm working on it."
bigdickproblems,38w69l,Primital,5,Sun Jun 7 10:59:23 2015 UTC,"In that case you should really ask someone out.   When I started dating I didn't know what to do, but I learned from my failures :)  Body language and intimacy are way more important than words are when it comes to attraction, so you can't really get someone unless you meet with them. And it's better to meet them early than late!"
bigdickproblems,38w69l,chairitable,2,Sun Jun 7 11:07:29 2015 UTC,"The few dates I've been on have always been pretty awkward, since we just end up sitting in silence. That's why I'm trying online dating, so I can get to know them a bit before. I've also considered speed dating. I've been blind to body language most of my life, I've recently studied up on it, and I'm sort of able to see it when I observe other people, but I have a hard time applying it to my own interactions."
bigdickproblems,38w69l,Primital,6,Sun Jun 7 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"Just on the subject to of your conversations dying down... Do you have any interests or hobbies you could develop? Personally I had a really hard time dating when all I did was reddit (or digg, at the time) and sometimes play D&D with the same group of friends.   Developing interests and skills into a variety of things make you more interesting and make it easier for you to talk not only about your interests, but to broach people about their own interests. People love hearing stories then telling their own. What's more, you might find someone interesting who's doing the same stuff you're doing, and common ground is fundamental to a successful relationship imo   You do have to be genuine about your interests, though, and not approach them as a means to attract others. Work on developing yourself before thinking about cultivating something with another.   As far as penis size goes, I agree with the other person who responded here. I've been with guys who aren't particularly large (your size, even smaller) and had a great time because I found them attractive and interesting, and they still had a penis so who cares? And if this person is no longer interested in you because of this, well, that happens. You can't be angry at someone else for not being interested, and you can't be angry at yourself for things that are out of your control (like physical characteristics or actions you've taken in the past). Focus instead on what you can control."
bigdickproblems,38w69l,bastige66,4,Sun Jun 7 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"We have some hobbies in common, and I've been quite honest with her about my hobbies and the likes.  Also, my size is not 4 inches, she's just assuming it is, since I wouldn't answer any more questions about my size, and I guess most guys above four inches would in this case have answered. I'm just wondering that if I indeed had a 4 inch penis and that was reason enough for her not to date me, if it's even worth it for me to try to keep on dating her.   At any rate, it seems like the reason for her silence was different, so I'm once again over thinking stuff."
bigdickproblems,38w69l,BadnewzSHO,2,Sun Jun 7 14:45:24 2015 UTC,"An easy solution is to do social activities!  Like I said in my first post, mini golf is excellent. Other things that can be good are hiking (maybe not a first date thing because of the amount of time required), dance classes, pool or bowling.  I don't know how old you are but a common thing would be to transition to a bar, grab a few drinks and get to know each other better.  Activities with the most contact possible is the best, as physical contact builds rapport (how comfortable/relaxed you feel in each others' presence).  First date I would probably go to a bowling alley with a bar. It allows you to think about what you want to talk about or how to reply when one of you is throwing.  I go bowling quite often with my girlfriend because it's such a perfect social setting for dates!"
bigdickproblems,38w69l,BadnewzSHO,2,Sun Jun 7 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"Dating where I live is a bit different from most of the western world I believe. I don't even think we have mini golf here, at least I've never seen it, and I've never heard of anyone going bowling on a date.  The most common dates are bar dates, dinner dates, short meet-ups and cinema dates, at least as far as I know.  But then again, my experience with dating is very limited. I'd imagine we'd go  for a walk or maybe a drink or two."
bigdickproblems,38w69l,BadinBoarder,2,Sun Jun 7 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"I recommend coffee dates as a first. You can bail if it's not a good fit (no pun intended), and if it IS a good fit, you can follow through with the suggestion of dinner. I also recommend getting to know the female in question before sexing it up, but I am a greedy pig and have never managed to do that, unless it was an established friend who offered benefits (which technically overrides the spontaneity factor). Also, for the development of your self-esteem and confidence, I recommend the book, ""Psychocybernetics"" by Maxwell Maltz, MD. It has worked for many, including myself."

That's like her telling you she doesn't like blowjobs. Sure, it's not all that matters, but it really helps make it better.   Why are you telling her you have a small dick? You were ""testing"" her? Is this a reality tv show? Dont test ppl, treat them like a human. She was probably excited to meet you and now she's less enthusiastic. Whenever a girl asks how big it is, say what it is. You have nothing to hide. Throw a few jokes in there to show you're comfortable.  You need to somehow wrinkle a joke about your small penis into conversation. Say some like ""my allegedly 4in dick"". Or you can somehow bring up the subject again and ask her what was the biggest dick she's been with. Then say ""well women are really bad at guessing sizes, I knew this girl that was so bad at guessing she actually thought I had a 4in penis. Haha"". Hell, you don't even have to bring up the penis subject, just ask her to guess the size of anything at all, then tell her women are bad at guessing. This will hopefully tell her you were joking about being small.  And for the love of god, meet this girl in person already, before you shoot yourself in the foot again"
bigdickproblems,38w69l,bdpthrowaway3,3,Sun Jun 7 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't telling her I have a small penis, she assumed it, and the only way for me to tell her otherwise, is to tell her that I have a large one, which I would rather she found out eventually. I never intended to convince her that I have a small penis, it sort of just happened and I couldn't think of a way to clear it out.  When we, hopefully, end up meeting, I'll certainly try and see what her perception of 4 inches is.  I'm still working on meeting her, she has some health troubles, nothing too serious, but enough that she's feeling uncomfortable and understandingly doesn't want to meet me when she's in this state."

bigdickproblems,38w69l,bdpthrowaway3,3,Sun Jun 7 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think you are probably taking it too seriously. Maybe she meant nothing by it. So try to forget it and continue the relationship as usual. It sounds like you were getting along well, to have something completely banal as this affect your relationship seems uncalled for.  So, forget about it, see how it goes. Maybe when she sees it she'll be pleasantly surprised. But yes, not a good decision to take on the conversation and then leave it hanging. Personally, I would never take up such a conversation.   To answer your second question, I have had a couple hook-ups where they sought me out based on gossip/hearsay about my penis size. None of them wanted a relationship, just casual sex, so it was no big deal. But if someone were to want a relationship purely because of my penis size, that probably wouldn't end well. So, I suppose that's true."

Or that you have phobias that keep you from doing normal everyday things?  Those are burdens she would have to assume if she got involved with you.  Meanwhile, what she likes about you has come to her only through text.  Your flesh-and-blood, smiling-and-breathing presence would powerfully counteract the negative information, but she doesn't have that.  Moreover, if she asked about your penis size, she probably has Standards.  That is not a bad thing about her, rather, it could mean she has a very good understanding of her body and her sexual response.  TL/DR: If a woman who has never met you gets the impression that you have a four-inch penis, that factoid will diminish you in a way that wouldn't happen in person."

But it makes me sad to know that some of them have boyfriends now, and those guys might not know (or worse, they might know)."

Seeing a girl's reaction to my size is an ego boost and it feels good to be so in-demand, but I don't want to hear those things from a girl who's taken.

Although there's also sort of a third emotion - I feel like those guys are probably not trying hard enough to please their girl, so it may or may not be a little bit their fault.

If the young lady learns you, your body, what you like during sex, watches you masturbate to see how you touch yourself..etc.  This is only half of the solution, however.  You have to WANT to cum in her mouth.  You might have to go a day or so without touching yourself, without cumming, to prime the pump, so to say..

I seriously doubt that those people had anything but genuine intentions.   Also, I dislike how dismissive they seem to be towards smaller men. Like, tell them how to deal with their problems instead of telling them how others have problems. It's so fucking stupid."

Like, tell them how to deal with their problems instead of telling them how others have problems. It's so fucking stupid.   Yeah, awhile back I tried to ask /r/sex if anyone else had a skinny dick, and what they do to make penetration more pleasurable.  The answers were like ""just be confident"", ""oral"", ""your dick's perfect for anal"", and ""some women have small vaginas"".  Okay, all of those are valid, but I don't see how that answers my question at all. Then someone accused me of having a sph fetish because I was ""average"", a mod told me to ""read the FAQ"" (which doesn't address girth issues at all), and then they deleted the thread lol."

When they read this sub they know what to expect in the real world, and then can make an informed decision about whether or not its worth the risk of dating while being small.   Personally, I'm very fortunate to have an average sized dick and a stable girlfriend who I've learned to satisfy (and thankfully is pretty easy to satisfy, we have good chemistry and I listen to her) but if I had a small dick I would rather read this sub and then decide to be abstinent for the rest of my life then be humiliated by women multiple times before deciding to give up on sex."

Instead of thinking that size doesn't matter and believe that I am heading into a level playing field - and subsequently being slaughtered - it might be good to moderate my expectations a bit, and to know what the reality of the situation is.

Sexual incompatibility comes when a girl understands that she has a vagina suited for bigger sizes (as opposoded to vaginismus or other forms of small vaginas), thus prefers them and understands that she may require it for a healthy sex life but depending on how much they love their partner may oversee this due to other great characteristics that overshadow a dick."

You kind of hit on a soft spot here, because the two things that always come up in a general thread about dick sizes is that ""large men hurt too much to be enjoyable"" and ""large men are selfish in bed"" float to the top, and we can't defend ourselves without getting accused of just bragging about our big dicks and getting downvoted. Since we CAN defend ourselves here, a lot of people are taking the chance to.  If you just avoided words like ""selfish"" and talked about mens flaws in bed more as mistakes then personality flaws, I think your post would be more popular.  Like ""this guy was so selfish in bed he didn't even do foreplay"" could just be ""It really makes things better in bed if guys do foreplay"" etc. etc.  The way you have the post phrased now will inevitably derail into an argument about if large men are actually lazy, rather then a thread that just talks about how larger men can do better in bed because of the unnessecary negativity.  We discuss sex advice, and the negatives and positives people do in bed.  We discuss how to be better at sex all the time, sometimes getting advice from guys, sometimes from girls.

The advantages are you have more in contact with the vagina walls, so you can stimulate more.

I'm pretty sure that being a selfish lover is unrelated to dick size and that if we took the set of all men over 7"", all men under 7"" and selfish lovers, that selfish lovers would overlap with both sets, and probably to an equal degree.

A selfish lover with a small dick or a selfish lover with a big dick is still a letdown because of their selfishness, not because of their dick size.

It can only angle so far the other direction, rubbing the back of your wall, but, after a certain point, there is no more angle, and the rest of it bends, and has nothing to do with bottoming out.

Get on his stomach and back into his dick. Make sure that your weight isn't going down into his dick, but rather is on his stomach, but not too much, because then he'll be unable to breathe. Attempt to support yourself with your legs as much as possible.  If that doesn't work, he could sometimes sit on the edge of a bed or chair or couch and have him mount you that way. You can use the chair for support and not have to lean on him too much.  Cowgirl can work with a big dick, and it can be a lot of fun, but you have to be careful about how you do it.  One thing that helps us out is that I've got a pretty decent up-curve, so it works out. To some guys who have a down-curve or whatever, you might want to try reverse cowgirl.

You just seem like a black guy that wants to be able to say that he has a ""bbc"" when he doesn't and is looking to have it justified online by strangers.    And yeah, the ""bbc"" stereotype is bullshit. Be happy with what you have, m8."
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,FruitTosser,16,Fri Jun 5 14:18:50 2015 UTC,Do you consider yourself a size queen?
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,JMarkson03,13,Fri Jun 5 16:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yes I do, now. But not before I met my current SO. But I had several above average partners when I started out, so I got a skewed idea of ""average"", and later on, I hooked up with a friend a few time who was probably 8.5""+ and it was not great. So I had a kind of narrow view of things over the course of a dozen partners.   Now, I definitely get turned on by thinking about how big he is, looking at /r/massivecock, and other related activities, in a way I just don't with lesser sizes."
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,abbasfarnas,9,Fri Jun 5 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"Why was it that you didn't have this fascination with big dicks back when you were with previous partners who were big? Especially the 8.5 guy, that's huge. Is it because your current SO was better in bed in certain ways? Do you have an idea how big your current SO is?"
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,forlumbus,9,Fri Jun 5 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe she likes him more, so the assumed physical physical positives seem more attractive."
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,bigdickaltaccount,5,Fri Jun 5 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"I think what I was trying to say is I didn't know how big was big, so while I liked several of the cocks I'd seen and had, I didn't know liking those particular dicks qualified me as a size queen.   The 8.5+ friend, well, he had only one speed and it was mildly uncomfortable. So from that I made the un-scientific assumption that BIG dicks were not for me.  I learned a lot about the power of girth and solid communication from my current (and forever) SO."
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,PoutineMadness,2,Fri Jun 5 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"Hrm, sounds like more your current partner just opened your eyes to some of the new feelings a bd presents, while the previous guy wasn't all that great at sex and as such, you weren't interested  As for the second part, I'll defer to my wife. She has expressed similar sentiments. Before we dated, she never really expressed interest in size. When she first saw it, she was cautious. We managed to have some fun, but it took her a while to get used to it. Since then she said her taste has changed and if she looks at porn, she has to seek out bigger guys, and most guys in porn still leave her a little disappointed."

bigdickproblems,38o7ec,RapingTheWilling,10,Fri Jun 5 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a dude, I think size queen is kinda derogatory. Liking that full feeling doesn't make you some special anomaly, you just like to get the whole experience.  What if you liked to give girls head, and people referred to you as a ""clit prince?"" I just don't think it needs a name. Pardon my rant, I'm not directing it at you, just that the phrase kinda irks me."
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,forlumbus,7,Fri Jun 5 17:05:13 2015 UTC,"It's not just the liking full feeling women who are size queens.

I have one friend that I share this info with and I get so excited when I can tell her new stuff or show pictures. It usually starts a half hour conversation on big cocks. :D Almost like bragging rights.
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,bigdickaltaccount,4,Fri Jun 5 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, yay! Nice to meet you. I'll try not to let my excitement make me start typing with a Valley Girl accent.   How did you originally start talking with your friend? Do you remember if you brought it up or her?"

bigdickproblems,38o7ec,bigdickaltaccount,8,Sat Jun 6 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"My wife used to actually show her ""friends"" pictures of my penis. By no means I am huge, but I am very thick. I got a lot of bad attention from her friends, being married and them coming on to me is a nononononoono.  She no longer talks about it, except she said she showed a co worker of hers a pics face palm now I dont want to meet her ever again.  My wife actually used to hate my penis. Heavily religious, no sex before marriage, I am her first partner, blah blah. Now she is in love. I finally got her in the right mindset where she can relax and it takes a considerable less time to start intercourse now! Like everyone says on here Oral,oral, oral, lube, and keep pumping the head and feel her vagina give way and let you in.  One night I forgot to wash, my friend was having a hang out at his place and everyone was drinking. We were in a circle sitting in chairs and I was slouched back in the chair. I was sexting my wife and I got a chubby... unfortunately I was wearing my last pair of jeans...they were REALLY tight..EVERYONE noticed. My friends and their Gfs/wives. Jokes were thrown around for a while and my drunk friend, he tends to not be himself when drunk, shoved a beer bottle down his pants and said he was me. Anyway after 5 minutes of busting my balls they apologized and moved on, but I destroys those jeans and I make sure I buy very lose ones now lol."
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,forlumbus,7,Sat Jun 6 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"Personally I find it all kind of embarrassing so I don't say a thing, and I did my best to not show anything in school. There's never really a reason to mention it. My girlfriends have all been very enthusiastic though, including my current one, but she seems to keep it pretty quiet too, or at least she doesn't tell me about her sex-gossip chats...  I appreciate the admiration of course and that's fun, but I just don't want to get all up in people's faces (ha ha) about it. I know what it's like to be super anxious about the size of your penis (I am trying to finally accept that ok, I guess it is bigger than most) and I don't want to put that on any dude directly or indirectly."

I definitely think that contributes to my hesitation in broaching the subject--not wanting to make anyone feel insecure about their situation. But I'm coming from a place of curiosity and enthusiasm rather than a desire to gloat, so I would hope that would come across. I wish it was as easy to say ""Want to compare notes on cocks?"" the way I can say ""Hey have you played The Witcher 3 yet is it good or is it great?"""

Unfortunately for a lot of things like this we just have to resort to internet friends. I dunno. It's kind of sad, isn't it? Our society is repressed publicly but free online."
bigdickproblems,38o7ec,RWDMARS,2,Fri Jun 5 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"I don't ever just say ""Hi, I'm bigdickaltaccount, and I have a huge penis"", but if someone else broaches the subject I'll mention it. If they can't handle talking about size with someone bigger than them, then they shouldn't bring it up. Same thing with salary. If you can't handle someone making more than you are making, don't talk about it!  But most of the time it doesn't cause problems. Usually people are just curious. Ask lots of questions. Girls questions are typically more sexual in nature (""could it fit in my mouth"" ""how do you have sex with that"" and ""does it hurt"") while guys are more practical (""how do you get condoms"", ""what underwear do you wear"", and ""how'd you get so big"")"

bigdickproblems,38o7ec,bigdickaltaccount,5,Fri Jun 5 19:10:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think that there's as much of a taboo about it. Yeah you might feel uncomfortable about it, when you talk about it in real life, but I think thats more the social expectations you have, both for others and yourself.  Most of my friends know I'm big. Only a few know how big. Yeah, I've had some negative reactions, but I'm no longer friends with those people. If they can't handle knowing I have something different than they do, then they're pretty insecure and, were it not penis size, it would be something else, like a car, a salary, or where I live.  Most of the reactions I get are positive, sometimes too positive. One dude asked me to take his wife and give her a night she'll never forget. Most of the time its like ""holy shit dude thats awesome"" and maybe a few questions, usually things like ""does it cause problems"" (occasionally) and ""how did you get so big!"" (idk, it just happened).  And girls seem pretty interested too. Many of my female coworkers show me a bit too much attention, and a lot ask a wide variety of questions, like ""could i deep throat it"" (no) ""would i bleed"" (maybe). They know I'm married, and have met my wife, which probably doesn't help because she is kind of a tease. When she's with her friends, she'll talk about it, about feeling it up deep inside her, about being truly full.  Most of the time, its just curiosity. People haven't interacted with big dicks all that much, and so when someone is actually open about it they get all their questions in.  But you have to be careful of how you bring it up. If you just say ""i have a big dick"" people either think you're humblebragging, or lying. You have to approach it with some tact. I've learned that there's really no softening of the blow, so I just come out and say it if someone's interested, and if that bothers them, well, they shouldn't have asked or pressed"

My girlfriend has been bragging to all of her friends (even her Mother!) about the size of my dick, she has even showed her best friend some photos of it.. Although I've not met them yet, I'm sure the topic is going to come up when I go down in a few weeks and meet them.   Saying that, I used to be shy about it when the girls in school noticed my bulge and just wanted to talk about it, ""how big is it?"" ""would it fit in my mouth?"", ""it would probably split me in two"". I just blushed and brushed it off. So there are definitely some people gagging to talk about it, you just need to figure out who they are and that's the hard part (no pun intended)."

What. Wow! I just couldn't conceive of wanting to share that kind of thing with my mom, much less how I would bring it up. But, I know some women are much more gal pals with their moms than I am. I'd be interested to hear the follow-up on how it goes meeting everyone. But you sound fairly unflappable about it at this point.   I wish I could just bring it up like that, I am fascinated by how cocks (and balls, for that matter) work. I always forget that the other person could be anything other than incensed/put off by it. Know that you were shy but able to just kind of shrug it off and survive somehow makes it easier for me to think about bringing it up more when I want to."

Tommy had a total nub and we kinda teased him gently and he laughed along not saying a word. Fast forward a bit and Tommy and a girl are getting frisky in the spa. Look over and the head of his dick is coming out of the water. He stands up and has probably 10"" of cock there. We were gobsmacked. He just laughed.

To summarize her comments, ""Ok, I mean that's not what I want but I understand. But hey if you'd like to continue hooking up on the regular just text me and I'll come over."" Abit of an ego boost!  She told me a few months down the road...When she started dating the next guy (who was a real scum bag), he had been complaining to her that she wasn't having sex with him. She said she didn't have any condoms that would fit him that night. He commented ""yea whatever likely excuse"".

bigdickproblems,38p7y7,bigdickaltaccount,4,Fri Jun 5 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"Standards might be the wrong word. If I were to hazard a guess, I'd say she's just discovering what she likes. I mean, you can guess, but you won't know what you actually like until you try it.  So, maybe you converted her into a size queen, it can happen, or maybe she just had a better relationship with you"
bigdickproblems,38p7y7,bigdickaltaccount,3,Fri Jun 5 19:12:08 2015 UTC,"It started out as a one night stand, but I suppose we could’ve had good sexual chemistry? There was a good amount of eye contact, and I think we were both very into each other. As for the sex, when she discovered that she could take it all (to her amazement), she went pretty wild on it and had an instantaneous orgasm.   If it is true that I converted her into a size queen, I guess I feel proud but also somewhat guilty? Have you had to deal with a similar realization in the past?"
bigdickproblems,38p7y7,bigdickaltaccount,2,Fri Jun 5 19:46:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds like she kind of always wanted a big one, but doubted her ability. So I'd say probably the part that drove it the most was the confidence boost you gave her. Taking all of a big dick is pretty impressive, and makes girls feel good, both physically and mentally.  Given the response she gave you, its hard to tell. Hooking up with an old relationship can't always work out. Sometimes people will start to remember why they broke up in the first place. Sometimes its because of sexual issues. He might think sex is just ""put it in her, thrust a few times, and cum"" which probably wouldn't satisfy her all that much, given how she ""went pretty wild on it and had an instantaneous orgasm.""  I wouldn't feel too guilty. You didn't steal her away from any man, she was yours at the time.  Cock size does play an important role in sex, but not in the way most people think. But in your case, it sounds like its one of the things she liked.  I don't really have any exact 1:1 experiences to give you, but I have a somewhat similar one. When my wife and I started dating years ago, she was a little worried that I'd stretch her way out and she'd never be able to enjoy sex with another dude again. She didn't really have to worry about that, but a few months ago she tried out one of her old toys and had to throw it out, because it didn't do anything for her. So I guess I converted her to a size queen, lol"

So I know this feeling.  After that I had a big dick hookup; some chick found out i was packing and wanted to try it, no relationship, just sex. It was a lot of fun but not that healthy.  Then I met the girl who would become my wife, haha.   She was the first one who was scared at first, but decided to give it a try. I guess I lucked out in that it turned out that she really liked size - in fact, she handled it better than the other women!   Thats how she [my wife] was at first.

But since it seems likely that we are going to get together again, perhaps it won’t be an issue.   Eh, don't. You're you, she's not you. A guy who'se good in the sack can make a girl crazy, regardless of penis size.

bigdickproblems,38p7y7,Cheerychime,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:38:07 2015 UTC,"This isn't always true. Some women are just not designed to orgasm vaginally. The nerves aren't necessarily positioned correctly regardless of the guy. And other times it takes work. Most women (I believe about 75% could be wrong but it's a high number :/) have never had an orgasm from just penetration. In the vagina itself, the nerve endings are sparse(not talking about the way the clitoris is set up here, strictly inside the vagina and the walls) except for a concentration of nerves at the end where the cervix is. It generally hurts when hit, and the gspot doesn't always make women cum instantaneously, In fact, because it's so close to the bladder, it can make them have to pee more often then not. Though stimulating the clitoris while hitting the gspot can bring on intense orgasms for some, it might be a weaker orgasm for others. Regardless, a partner stimulated orgasm is almost always more intense ( I can say from experience) than masturbation and usually more satisfying as well. It's when the partners can communicate effectively and if anatomy and mentality is just right enough,  is when this will happen."
bigdickproblems,38p7y7,JohnAMcdonald,0,Mon Jun 8 04:49:23 2015 UTC,"The nerve endings are there, you just need a cock that can fill the vagina and the right stroke so that you hit the clit. Every girl I've ever had was able to cum from my fucking them alone."

I have no problem reaching orgasm from oral, digital or masturbation with a vibrator, but I can't with just vaginal penetration alone. Its not possible for me. It isn't possible for a lot of women.

bigdickproblems,38jn45,Rigald,0,Thu Jun 4 23:30:05 2015 UTC,"It's funny to me too and I wouldn't rape someone.  However it's one thing to find something funny, and another to post it online in the first place or reinforce someone that it's ""right"" by being funny.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture  Whilst I agree they have a point, I can't bring myself to correct people or change my mind about whether it's funny or not.  But to see them so heavily downvoted for trying to having a differing opinion annoys me. It's just the fact they are trying to force it upon others by just flat out saying ""it's not funny"" without explaining the rest."
bigdickproblems,38jn45,Atylonisus,3,Thu Jun 4 23:36:24 2015 UTC,"Being funny does not reinforce anything.  It's because it's so universally unacceptable that it can be a joke in the first place.  And don't even get me started on ""rape culture.""  Lastly, while the downvotes on Looga's first comment may not be deserved, he/she is now accusing someone of being a rapist which sure as fuck deserves downvotes."
bigdickproblems,38jn45,Rigald,-1,Fri Jun 5 10:07:07 2015 UTC,"Disagree on the first point. Humor absolutely normalizes behaviors.  Say you have a group of six men. One of them is a misogynist,  but it isn't clear immediately because the rest of the group is comfortable making rape jokes. Five of the men rationalize that it isn't ACTUALLY funny; they'd never hurt anybody on purpose after all - they just think that its possible to have humor derived from being edgy while respecting limits in real life.   The sixth man doesn't consider himself a bad person either, but that's because his whole life he's only ever known that women are emotional beings and that he gets broken up with a lot. Wait... What?   His experiences can't be ignored - it DID happen to him and all he knows is that girls appear to act a certain way. He internalizes his anecdotes as hard fact because personal experiences are the most salient. To him, this rape joke is funny because it taps at something fundamental to his understanding of women: that they are mean, and don't want to be with him.   Most of the users here won't be women haters. They understand the difference. But among us there lurks others, and hearing casual radios jokes reinforces and normalizes their unrealistic Beliefs. ""Hey, these guys get it too!""  How could a joke be harmful? Its just based on truth somewhere, right? Hear something enough, it may just occur to you that it's okay to say those things... for entirely the wrong reason."
bigdickproblems,38jn45,LoogaBeluga,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:20:02 2015 UTC,"This isn't a case of disagreement.  A claim was made and I dismissed it because no evidence was presented and it isn't obviously true.  Similarly, hypothetical anecdotes aren't something I find convincing but your mileage may vary.   Hear something enough, it may just occur to you that it's okay to say those things   To say those things?  Maybe, depends on the context.  To do them is something else entirely.  Here's my problem with this: I have only ever seen one example of a person hearing a joke and concluding it was an indication of what's acceptable or unacceptable.  He was a mentally challenged boy that heard jokes about killing and stabbed me.  Even this boy realized his mistake as soon as he did.  I have not seen nor heard of a single other example and for that reason I will remain unconvinced.  Meanwhile, I could list off other joke subjects (holocaust, AIDS, murder, etc.) all day that everyone agrees are horrible and have not been ""normalized.""  Hopefully you can see why this seems absurd to me.  Plus, your example is of someone who believes X and continues to believe X, but how did he come to believe X in the first place?  I certainly don't think it had anything to do with jokes.  It would only be normalization, by its definition, if he didn't believe it beforehand.  If nothing else, as things are now, rape is taken so seriously that accusations are taken as factual without evidence.  The UVA thing and Emma Sulkowicz come to mind.  That's the opposite of what you'd expect if jokes could ""normalize"" an idea.  Lastly, and this may come off as insulting, but if you hear something (especially something as insincere as a joke) and then believe it, the problem is your lack of skepticism, not everyone else's taste in humor."

The idea that a girl would cheat on a guy JUST because of dick size is just a porn fantasy.  If women were cheating with larger men only because they wanted a large penis, they could just buy a big dildo from the sex shop and it would be a lot less drama.  When asked anonymously, 85% of women say they're satified with their partners penis size.  Dating site Victoria Milan which caters to cheating asked it's users their reason for cheating, and ""He's not good in bed"" made up 14% of responses.  We've had men be cheated on them BECAUSE of their penis size.  There have been girls that have broken up with guys around here because they don't like large penises.  There was even that one guy who had his ""girlfriend"" start a new relationship, and not break up with him because she was a size queen and wanted sex, which emotionally devastated the guy who thought he was in a real relationship and not in a fuck buddy arrangement.  There are girls that were perfectly satisifed with our penis sizes, but cheated on people here for not being rich enough, tall enough, handsome enough, strong enough, getting distant, whatever.  I might be overreacting here a bit, but I hate the porno idea that big dicks are a tool for homewrecking.  If anything, having a big dick shouldn't make you want to cheat with other peoples girlfriends, it should make you want to get into a long term relationship where a girl can slowly get used to your body and appreciate it more then any other girl out there."

Apparently she ruptured her Vagina with an extremely large dildo, and said my dick would hurt her way too much.

We didn't last much longer after that, not entirely because of my size, but it was a contributing factor to the relationship going sour.  I had one sloppy college hookup with a size queen who was full of big dick lust. It was a lot of fun, and gossip quickly spread. I got a lot of attention from girls through school, although I didn't really have that many sexual encounters because…  I started dating a girl in college who is now my wife. When she first saw it, she had a mixture of awe and apprehension. Like, she wanted to try it, but she knew it would hurt. Since then I've managed to stretch her out and make her mine, and she loves it. Sometimes I'll wake up in bed and her hand will be down there, while she's asleep, and she'll have a big smile on her face.

bigdickproblems,38ilef,rumour_monger,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"A girlfriend in the past explained how the rumors spread in her social circle (so the following may not hold in general):  There are cases when the girl volunteers the information to her friends (as with your girl #2). More often however, when a girl in the circle starts dating someone new, her friends would ask her about the new guy’s performance in bed. This has higher odds of happening if the guy deemed to be attractive by the social circle (in terms of looks and other qualities), as this tends to arouse their curiosity more.  Sometimes, they may explicitly ask about size, especially if the guy is very attractive. Having a lead-up also may trigger them to ask (e.g. “He is (tall/has big feet/black/Asian). Is it true what they say?”) A non-response to the question is understood as the guy being average or small, so the girl may feel the need to defend the guy’s penis at this point.  It seems your level of attractiveness feeds to the rich getting richer/poor getting poorer phenomenon. Attractive guys with big dicks will rise in desirability through gossip, while attractive guys with small penises will fall. If you are not attractive, your desirability probably won’t change much either way.  Which reminds me, a similar phenomenon was demonstrated in an Australian study by Michael Jennions at ANU where they examined women’s preferences. In this study, a woman's desire for a big penis was greatly amplified when the guy being shown was taller in height."

I doubt they're more likely to break then your other options.  Magnum XLs are 54mm at the base where they need to be wide, and 65mm at the head when it doesn't matter.  This only doesn't happen of a minority of men who are baseball bat shaped like the condoms are.  You would strongly benefit from 64mm condoms, although these still may be slightly loose around the head.  Since they have to stretch less to fit, they sit on your penis under less stress, with a thicker latex wall, they're covered in more lube, and are generally more comfortable.  This study, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9702591 suggests that larger men break standard size condoms more frequently, THREE TIMES the average for 6"" girth men if you do the math, so anything that might reduce the chance of this like larger condoms is a big selling point to me.  Condoms above a 57mm nominal width are not approved for sale (yet?) in ths US/CA so they're an expensive pain in the ass to buy though if you're based there."

bigdickproblems,38l5jb,KelMage,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:15:15 2015 UTC,These seem kind of expensive. How well do they breathe in your opinion? I'd hate to spend that much money and be disappointed.

I suggest looking for sales, Andrew Christian's are often marked down up to 40% off on their website if you look at the clearance rack. Don't buy fake shit though... I tried and it's just not the same (mope...)."
bigdickproblems,38l5jb,bigdickaltaccount,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:22:37 2015 UTC,I find them ok under jeans. They certainly look bulgey in those pics but they kind of just let you hang exactly as you would if commando.
bigdickproblems,38l5jb,dtoedt,2,Fri Jun 5 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"Get briefs that wick the sweat away from your boys but still keep them separate from your legs. Good brand include Jack Adams, Obviously and N2N."
bigdickproblems,38l5jb,dtoedt,2,Thu Jun 4 23:48:42 2015 UTC,"Best investment ever was several sets of Under Armour Original Boxerjocks. They are like compression shorts with a mesh pouch in the front too keep your boys cool and in place.     If you dont like the compression shorts spandax feel, they also make a pair that is made completely of the mesh like material. They are very cool and comfy.  But they seem to sag in the inner thigh area easily"

Don't coat it like christmas snow, just a little bit sprinkled in the clothes. Also prevents stench"
