I've seen so many semi HQ gifs (and now this way better than any screener or TS or anything gif), and nothing on the usual and popular sites in the way of released media or anything. I can find a DVDRip on the usenet, but the HD versions are only on private sites for some reason.  And we're completely ignoring the fact that the BluRay is actually out, too, and nothing is to be found about it ..."
AubreyPlaza,3b48o3,withmorten,9,Fri Jun 26 00:35:00 2015 UTC,I think it was just because it's a small film-festival type movie. It's not on the radar of the people who put up torrents.
AubreyPlaza,3b48o3,CrypticCraig,2,Fri Jun 26 01:06:32 2015 UTC,"Seems weird though, because almost anything and everything gets released publicly one way or another ...

AubreyPlaza,2nzvns,atticus138,2,Tue Dec 2 00:49:05 2014 UTC,i watched that movie only cause she was in it and it wasnt that bad
AubreyPlaza,2nzvns,ILIKEPIE4715,2,Wed Dec 3 04:33:50 2014 UTC,"The movie is basically geared towards two demographics: 1) Parents who want a fairly light-hearted Christmas movie to watch with their children, and 2) People who want to see April Ludgate as a cat.   It wasn't Citizen Kane by any stretch of the imagination, but it's hilarious if you're into awkward, self-deprecating, self-referential humor -- basically, April Ludgate."

AubreyPlaza,2nwd6w,dontcallmerobert,0,Mon Dec 1 03:59:15 2014 UTC,I really want to like this movie because of both of them being in it.
AubreyPlaza,2nsr7t,kenbrellfan,39,Sat Nov 29 23:39:38 2014 UTC,From the interviews/podcasts where she's actually opened up it seems like she is nervous in real life.  That could explain the extremely dry humor.
AubreyPlaza,2nsr7t,respro,28,Sun Nov 30 00:47:17 2014 UTC,Here's one of the few interviews where she gives sincere answers and smiles a lot. Not sure why it doesn't have more views - seems like most people watch her for her quirkiness. I like her quirkiness too but seeing her act normal reaffirms my love for her.
AubreyPlaza,2nsr7t,phoshizzle21,3,Sun Nov 30 07:08:14 2014 UTC,Man she said she would marry Chris Bosch. She is supposed to marry me!
AubreyPlaza,2nsr7t,Bigsam411,16,Sat Dec 6 16:00:39 2014 UTC,"I remember I read an interview with her after Safety Not Guaranteed came out, where she said she knew she had been typecast as a cynical, sarcastic jerk. She was glad to be able to play a more openly sweet and kind-hearted person in that movie because she felt that was more what she was like in real life."
AubreyPlaza,2nsr7t,Tenauri,10,Sun Nov 30 01:21:06 2014 UTC,I'm trying to remember the one where she really opened up.  Was it with Maron?

AubreyPlaza,2nsr7t,tgiff,3,Sun Nov 30 03:36:58 2014 UTC,yeah that one is good
AubreyPlaza,2nsr7t,offermansmustache,5,Sun Nov 30 02:16:24 2014 UTC,"She is serious, she just feels awkward in most interviews. Probably because they are not real conversations. Talk shows do pre-interviews so that they can insure that they have some funny stuff to talk about. Therefore the talk show host is trying to organically direct the conversation to certain topics. This is weird because it almost turns it into an improv, where you are playing yourself as a character.   So many people hate her because of this, but really what they hate is that they feel awkward watching it. And because people are jerks who blame others before themselves, they assume she's doing it on purpose. Personally I love watching her interviews, I feel like she is responding more how a normal person would respond to having a fake conversation with an audience watching you."

I get the impression that existence is kind of a big silly joke to them, And I fell that way too, being serious is over rated. They understand that acting in screen is not much different than IRL."

AubreyPlaza,2nt68k,Gladness2Sadness,6,Sun Nov 30 02:37:24 2014 UTC,"I like Aubrey Plaza and Bill Murray. I kinda want to keep it that way, so I don't watch their cat voice movies.  Instead, I just watched Life After Beth, it was good. Aubrey was good. The lead was too serious, everyone else in the cast had a fun, let's improv vibe to their performances, except the lead, who seemed to play it too straight, like he was in a different movie from everyone else."
AubreyPlaza,2nt68k,Michael_Bloomberg_,6,Mon Dec 1 00:24:38 2014 UTC,Didn't realize I was watching the movie til 30 min in. I thought it was a special about the movie. Not good but I was entertained.

Think it's the first and thus far only time Aubrey Plaza's ever had a character to portray. She pulled it off well. Started with her sarcastic demeanor and then stripped that away a little to reveal something underneath.   When the time traveler says ""Your mother's death isn't your fault."" and she replies, in a pathetic version of her snarky, monotone, sarcasm ""That's what they tell me."" Gold. Pure gold. Suddenly, the monotone, snarky sarcasm is there for a reason! It works so well.   Definitely worth watching multiple times."

AubreyPlaza,2gx0wh,atticus138,1 point,Sat Sep 20 02:03:34 2014 UTC,October 1st? I saw this last month!
AubreyPlaza,2gx0wh,petegex,1 point,Sat Sep 20 14:53:00 2014 UTC,Meh... I was not impressed.  It had parts...  and Potential... But it felt like they missed out on what could have been a lot of humor.  Poorly executed film.

AubreyPlaza,2gx0wh,Im_A_Racehorse,-3,Sat Sep 20 05:18:43 2014 UTC,Wish Dane Dehann wasn't in this. He was horrible in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.
AubreyPlaza,2gx0wh,CatTurdCollector,3,Sat Sep 20 06:50:44 2014 UTC,What wasn't horrible in that movie.

AubreyPlaza,2gx0wh,CatTurdCollector,1 point,Sat Sep 20 18:04:37 2014 UTC,Nothing about it was horrible at all imo
