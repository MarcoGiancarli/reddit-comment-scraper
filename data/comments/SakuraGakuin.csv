OD is a great song but if I am watching this video for the first time and was a new BM fan, I would be sort of freaked out reading the lyrics considering their ages.  The flip side of the coin is that after watching these girls go through Sakura Gakuin, this song has nothing to do with their personalities. Is it metal? HELL YES!  Is it the girls? NO!"
SakuraGakuin,3dzgkb,14fore,3,Tue Jul 21 03:35:55 2015 UTC,"Du-metal added a long piece to his Onedari translation page more than a year later, in English and also, unusually, in Japanese, which you might find interesting.     If you have no bad impression of Japanese girls, you need not read this long note. However, since I feel something strange about the lyrics, I have to write a bit for Japanese girls' honor."
SakuraGakuin,3dzgkb,jabberwokk,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"That is a must read for new BM fans. The bride part threw me for a loop but after raising a daughter I can assure you begging Dad for money and presents must have been her top hobbies.   It sometimes worked (ok, most of the time).

SakuraGakuin,3dzgkb,14fore,6,Tue Jul 21 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"""I wanna marry Daddy!"" isn't that strange, it's just little-girl logic and pretty cute. In this case intentionally cute to butter up Dad, burikko-style, but it wasn't until Freud came along that anyone would have given such a childish notion a second thought.      If there's another layer to the song, I think it's satire of the idol industry*.  But if that is there, it would be coming from the lyricists, obviously, and possibly Koba, not the performers.         * In the kamishibai preceding the very first performance of Onedari, Y&M were tricked by the Power Idols into adopting an anti-metal attitude and transforming into the devilish, materialistic Black Babymetal to sing it."

Here's a girl who's already in the company, loves the group, probably knew a good bit of the song and dance just from doing it at home and obviously wants to join; we need a 12th now that Mariri's leaving, so why not her?"
SakuraGakuin,3dxnz3,TheBestMetal,4,Mon Jul 20 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"I assume an ""audition"" for Sakura Gakuin is...  ●AMUSE KIDS girl of an age for Sakura Gakuin is asked if she has a will to join Sakura Gakuin.  ●If she is willing to join, she take a few interviews, lessons of dancing and singing.  ●If she succeed the 'audition', she will be asked to join. She will find herself failed the audition by not being asked to join.  This is only an assumption but I think it reasonable. So, yes it's possible when Aiko met Mariri, C-chan was not still decided to join Sakura Gakuin. But we can't see exactly when Mariri decided to leave Sakura Gakuin, when C-chan was determined as a new transfer-in."

And if it is true that she only got in because Mariri decided to graduate early, i mean that's pretty dramatic wwww"

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for fukeis to see these girls all together and speaking following their respective graduations."

SakuraGakuin,3dwp8s,42Metal,2,Mon Jul 20 09:48:08 2015 UTC,You'll have to be more specific than that. What species of corvus? It's a big family. Or are you talking about ravens?
SakuraGakuin,3dwp8s,rpsgc,4,Mon Jul 20 10:35:53 2015 UTC,You wish! ;)  EDIT: I'll be happy to stand corrected.
SakuraGakuin,3dwp8s,EraYaN,2,Mon Jul 20 09:39:26 2015 UTC,"It seems you didn't properly account Pluto in your calculations, because an appearence of Moa without Yui is simply impossible."

In the photos I actually had to look twice sometimes to see who is who.    It's so funny how kabe-don is famous among idols, but this is the first time it looked hilarious instead of ""serious"" lol"
SakuraGakuin,3dtybw,Elizabethge,2,Sun Jul 19 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I was surprised to see them doing the kabe-don pose, I usually see it in manga and I melt, so it was really funny, specially when Kano is the guy!"

SakuraGakuin,3dtn53,iwabo-fukei,2,Sun Jul 19 10:10:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sure she knows, Raura is on it after all. But I think the way they decide guests is whether or not the guest has something to promote like a show or an album. So I guess there is a possibility of her getting on NoS."
SakuraGakuin,3dtn53,iwabo-fukei,3,Sun Jul 19 10:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yes that's what I meant. Of course she knows about Night of Spica but to make that connection ""I could promote it there"" maybe a fan needs to give her that push if she didn't think of it herself."

SakuraGakuin,3dtn53,missingreel,6,Sun Jul 19 17:31:11 2015 UTC,Torahime-Ichiza is an absolutely fantastic troupe! Hana will have a great time with them - for sure.  I had the pleasure of being able to see them perform when I went to Japan and I wrote some impressions if anyone would like to read them.    My Impressions of Torahime-Ichiza
SakuraGakuin,3dtn53,missingreel,4,Sun Jul 19 14:12:04 2015 UTC,"Dude, I just finished reading that, and let me say, your writing is really good. The way you described them made me interested. I'm very intrigued by the group. Sounds like something I'm going to check out if ever I go to Japan in the future.   Also awesome that you met /u/2zko in Japan. Did you happen to see Hana there in the cafe?"
SakuraGakuin,3dtn53,missingreel,2,Sun Jul 19 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"No she was not there, unfortunately, but that was okay - the entire staff was charming-as-hell and a treat to talk to."
SakuraGakuin,3dtn53,slimymetal,2,Sun Jul 19 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"I guess she wouldn't be, since she's still a trainee. Maybe they're still making her stick with just promotion. That would be pretty cool, if a few months from now she'll be part of the actual performance as well as being in the staff."
SakuraGakuin,3dtn53,DrKeithsune,2,Sun Jul 19 14:41:15 2015 UTC,Hana was still in school when I went as well. I think her upcoming appearances with Torahime will be during her summer break.

SakuraGakuin,3dtghq,iwabo-fukei,2,Sun Jul 19 07:59:10 2015 UTC,Could just be a different group who wanted that name and stylised it like that so they could use the name. Though I don't think Japan does that kind of thing as much as the West does.
SakuraGakuin,3dtghq,SirAwesomecake,2,Sun Jul 19 08:23:48 2015 UTC,"No way it is them. Why would they even perform as one subunit, that barely made an appearance last year? No picture attached here http://idolkoushien.com/category/profile/"
SakuraGakuin,3dtghq,Dwarfda,2,Sun Jul 19 11:19:55 2015 UTC,No way it is them.   You're right. I think I found the Twinkle☆Stars that is referred to in that list.
SakuraGakuin,3dtghq,ForAnAngel,2,Sun Jul 19 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing that up then.    On a side note, just because something wasn't active the prior year doesn't mean they can't be active this year. This event is after TIF, and since sub units will get announced there it's perfectly possible for them to get revived. As far as I remember Twinklestars was the only club to sell CDs next to BABYMETAL. So them making a solo appearence wouldn't be that unrealistic either. But it was clarified now that it's just a unit with a similar name so I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens at TIF."
SakuraGakuin,3dtghq,jabberwokk,3,Mon Jul 20 10:30:19 2015 UTC,"As far as I remember Twinklestars was the only club to sell CDs next to BABYMETAL.   Also Logica. But yes, I wouldn't be surprised in the least if Twinklestars returns, it works for a large group and they even have a new uniform design."

SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,TheThrawn,3,Sat Jul 18 23:42:41 2015 UTC,Added to Translated songs spreadsheet  Softsubs  Font totally swiped from /u/Shadeslayr.  Every song on 2012 Nendo ~My Generation~ has now been subbed.
SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,ShadeSlayr,2,Sat Jul 18 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"Haha, how did you find the font?"
SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,ShadeSlayr,2,Sun Jul 19 10:38:28 2015 UTC,"You provide soft subs, I opened the subs to have a look at which font you used, and also to see how you format your subs.  I do that for all subs I get (just out of curiosity), then I archive them for the spreadsheet.  Then I googled the font name."
SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,ShadeSlayr,2,Sun Jul 19 10:43:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's what I figured. Actually I have a question regarding  how you sub. You alternate your English and Romaji lines, right? And you said you just pressed enter twice to apply timing for both lines. I tried that, but what happens is that when I press enter, the timing window shifts by about 2 seconds, so when I press enter the second time, the 2 seconds gets applied to the second line. I can't seem to make it work like you do."
SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,asakurakun,2,Sun Jul 19 10:58:16 2015 UTC,"I just have the Romaji line selected, and then when I finish setting the start end times I click inside the text box and check the text for errors, and then just hit enter twice really fast.  I never really thought about how odd my method is, until I realised no one else does it that way. :/"
SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,14fore,2,Sun Jul 19 11:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have it that way, but it doesn't duplicate the timing for two lines. Anyway, it works for you, so it shouldn't be a problem :)"

SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,14fore,4,Sun Jul 19 02:44:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe this should be called ""Grandma's Knitting Tips"" or something like that on You Tube so it doesn't attract the attention of Amuse-san. Then again, there will be a lot of nice old ladies going ""WTF is this?"" when they click on it."
SakuraGakuin,3dsa8n,asakurakun,4,Sun Jul 19 06:33:35 2015 UTC,It'll be a good head exercise for grandma's...
