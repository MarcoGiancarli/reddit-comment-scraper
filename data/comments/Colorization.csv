Colorization,3e3ygv,ColinFiat,3,Tue Jul 21 23:22:56 2015 UTC,There's a different type of shadowing between the two; not sure how Marina achieved the effect. The apparent altered light source makes him look 'kinder' in the colored version.
Colorization,3e3ygv,ColinFiat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:46:24 2015 UTC,It looks bad?
Colorization,3e3ygv,eyferrari,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:15:10 2015 UTC,Not bad at all. The apparent change in light from shadow effects and shading makes him look like a nice person. The entire image is good. You made an improvement to the image by simply adjusting shadow.

Colorization,3e1bdh,mristre,5,Tue Jul 21 04:53:07 2015 UTC,Very nice - especially the background as it's hard to show detailed color as a blur. Pity there's no hint of reflection in the ashtray or some highlights on the cups/glasses. But that's a small part of the image where the matchbox and flame make up for it.  Great result.

Colorization,3e5gjl,hankrhoads,2,Wed Jul 22 02:38:34 2015 UTC,"You need to add some reds to the face and hands.  Faces aren't one color.  What you can do is use a photo of a girls face, then take skin tones from that to help you get the right colors.  Do the same to the brick building, the grass.  Right now the image is lacking in dark tones.  Make the teeth whiter, there some buttons that were missed, change up the coloring of the contrasting pipes and molding around the building.  Use other colors on what ever you can.  Make the fur a bit darker, with the top of the hat lighter, use more contrast on the jacket to his undercoat."
Colorization,3e5gjl,zynthesis1981,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:50:54 2015 UTC,"You've got the right idea and the application is perfect. Next up is to choose a better image.   Improvement: you've already colored individual items such as jacket, shirt, belt, strap and buttons a different color. Perfect. But all the bricks are one color whereas there are hundreds of bricks. Same for the ground which will have very subtle color changes. And, if his jacket was a little dirty, you'd need to color the dirt.  His face is all one color whereas faces are lots of colors. This image does not have the resolution to easily allow realist skin tone to be applied with accuracy - I'd have to guess a lot.  Try a photo from any of these resources: http://redd.it/3ay2xo  You've made a good start - keep going."

Colorization,3dzfoo,ColinFiat,0,Mon Jul 20 22:12:30 2015 UTC,"My left eye agrees but not my right; sometimes belt, sometimes skin. In this large image tends to show me a tight belt with a crooked buckle. But tilt my head, move back a little and I think the back of the belt looks like very fair untanned skin based on the little bit of skin from side boob and hip.   Really hard to tell but I'd have done a belt."
Colorization,3dxm2a,Zahulie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:11:30 2015 UTC,"Great image, thanks for the video. Two questions - the blur or smudge you did on the hands and face, what is the name of the effect you used? You may have seen me use a Gaussian Blur on out of focus background plants in my Lucy Liu video but that one lends itself to fading away.  Secondly, why did you start from the foremost objects and work your way back? Did you need to be extra careful not to cover parts of his leg when doing the chair? Or are you able to mask that out automatically?   For me, I block color the entire background and then continue forward without care until the front most objects are done. There's usually no need to be every careful of going over a previous color.  It's a nice effect on the floor but a few more minutes treating each cobble stone as a unique object rather than dividing the floor into three sections would have made the image stand out. I am trying to see the soldier without noticing a flat lifeless floor.  It's a great image regardless of my comment."
Colorization,3dxm2a,ColinFiat,5,Mon Jul 20 12:19:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment and questions Colin.  Answer to your questions - 1) No Smudge or blur was used just a simple trick of layer opacity and blending mode in this case I used Soft Light at a 20% Opacity 2) I always colour the main object first for no real reason other then a habit I formed from many years of drawing.   I have to disagree with you about the floor I feel it is complete but I still appreciate the advice you gave. Thanks again for the questions Colin

Colorization,3du6ui,not_impossibru,4,Mon Jul 20 00:18:05 2015 UTC,Why do the Maori Girls have Blonde hair and white skin??
Colorization,3du6ui,ButYi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"Fair enough question because I was asking myself the same thing and double checking my settings. Using other skin and hair samples resulted in the same tones as my calculated hue and saturation levels. Different samples were used from Pantone 62-4 C but the same result was produced.  Either the photo is misrepresenting the tone of their hair and skin or they had light skin and fair hair. I do not ever force a color onto an image and even if I did, I do not change the luminance (light/bright) value.  edit: additional - read my tutorial and watch the video to see why I believe the hair and skin in my colorization are very close to correct."
Colorization,3du6ui,ValarMorghulisBitch,3,Mon Jul 20 03:35:50 2015 UTC,I dunno man. I'm from NZ - pretty much most of Maori have dark brown or black hair - especially in 1910. its really rare to have that textured hair blonde or fair.  is it likely that the original you have was altered?
Colorization,3du6ui,ValarMorghulisBitch,0,Mon Jul 20 05:38:28 2015 UTC,"Faded perhaps? The original source is not mine, it's linked to in a different comment, and it looks like they have non-black hair and half-cast aboriginal skin tone. I'm gonna check with some others who specialize in WW1 photos as ask them to guestimate the colors."
Colorization,3du6ui,kardossandor,2,Mon Jul 20 06:08:57 2015 UTC,"I think I may have read/heard something about their photos sometimes being altered in the very early colonisation (so much earlier)  so they didn't look like totally unrelatable people to people thinking of coming over - but I have no idea about the accuracy of that.   I'd be really really surprised If their hair was that light, with that skin tone. Skin lightens before hair I think for Maori I think with mixed genes. Usually you are much fairer skin if you have hair that colour - and even them the reddish/copper shades of hair are super unusual for rare lighter hair for Maori."
Colorization,3dunwi,komstock,2,Sun Jul 19 17:24:40 2015 UTC,Fantastic! Really like the colors you picked.  Do not like the violence!
Colorization,3dunwi,AllThingsBad,3,Sun Jul 19 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, little violence occurred during the uprising of 1968. That said, the people of the current Czech Republic and Slovakia still resisted the invading Soviet Union in many ways and at one point even literally routed a Soviet invasion force out of the country by rearranging road signs. It's a pretty feel good story, except that the commies took over again and people were executed for expressing their desire to be free. Either way, the Czechs and Slovaks got what they wanted 21 years later, so I guess it could have been much, much worse."

More impressive is that I can't tell if you did it intentionally with 2 days planning or accidentally chose everything at random.   If it were not for the single pixel width errors on and around where green sharpy transitions to a different color I'd think this may have been a color photo. The rock between hip and hand on the towel has a brown halo and the triangular piece of cloth nearby has bled onto the pebbles.

Colorization,3d204n,ColinFiat,2,Mon Jul 13 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"A good effort but it falls short. There are so many objects in this image I hesitate to count them and yet only the main feature bricks have any attempt at randomness.   Every brick should be colored individually, similarly for the stairs, the different sections of paving, the various different damaged areas of concrete pillars and even each loose stone and blob of rubbish on the ground.   Come on BC, I can see your skill is improving but your effort is dwindling. That horse and tree image could have been fantastic but it lacked in large areas which were not the tree or the horse. The PlayBoy Pop Stand was simple and quite plain but very good because you took time with the smallest details.  Some of my images look good but little skill was put into them, only time. The reason they are passable or even 'good' is because of all the smallest objects being colored individually. I've experimented with random colors on cluttered images and it look like a unicorn vomited on it but it still looked good because of the detail. The ballerina photo is a good example - I went nuts on the brick color but it looks good because each brick was done individually.   If you can find a super quality version of this image and spend a week coloring each object with a minimum 3 colors then you'd instantly be the best colorist here. (That is only if you can pick close to the right three colors ;-)"

Czeslawa was a Polish Catholic girl, from Wolka Zlojecka, Poland, who was sent to Auschwitz with her mother in December of 1942. Within three months, both were dead. Photographer (and fellow prisoner) Brasse recalled photographing Czeslawa in a 2005 documentary: ""She was so young and so terrified. The girl didn't understand why she was there and she couldn't understand what was being said to her. So this woman Kapo (a prisoner overseer) took a stick and beat her about the face. This German woman was just taking out her anger on the girl. Such a beautiful young girl, so innocent. She cried but she could do nothing.

However, be careful with red 'blushing' around the eyes; on the lower lids, it tends to make people look tired or sickly. Keep it confined to the upper inner eye sockets and around the tear ducts or places where the blood vessels are closer to the skin. The  end of the nose is a good highlight point too, but be very careful as too much can look like he has a cold.  Other than that, great work. :)"

You could do this in a variety of ways, but what I would do is: Make the suspenders blue (like jeans) OR make the building in the background a color more towards blue, and make the shirt more white.

Here's a screen shot (my apologies for grabbing your image real quick, but I figured this would be quickest) I create the mask, then used gradient map (layer set to color ).  You can edit the gradient by clicking right into it. It literally maps the dark to light with the colors you've chosen. The ones I chose are still too brown, but you should play around with it. I co-opted Photoshops ""metallic"" gradient style of light dark light dark in the higher end to achieve a shine.

As far as constructive criticism goes:  Saturate your colors! I can't stress that enough, and when I first started it was a big hurdle for me, too, but just saturate the hell out of it. http://imgur.com/vjwlG3Y It still needs some polishing afterwards, but it's a step in the right direction. For being new to colorization, this is about the quality that I'd expect (which is a good thing). Your next steps should be looking at the skin and hair. Look up Zuzahin's tutorial for an in depth tutorial, or on the sidebar for something quicker (I recommend Zuzahin's though).  The grass is fine, but I recommend coloring the dead grass amidst all the green grass.  Oh, and one last thing: Set your layer modes to 'color' rather than soft light. If you use soft light and set a color value that's very bright or dark, it messes with the luminosity of the photo. If your more comfortable working with soft light, the copy the original B&W layer to the top of the image and set its layermode to 'luminosity'."

It has a retro/melancolic looks to it as if it was scanned from an old magazine.  In my (subjective) opinion, this is one of the best works I’ve seen here lately, showing concern for achieving balance while respecting the original b&w instead of just using one-minute techniques that leave pieces of random color and grey all over the place or people looking like painted clowns.

However, then I would have used the fact that the skin has different brightnesses in all places and would have used this to bulk-change the hue and saturation of the color that's plastered all over this. There are Photoshop tricks to work with the HSB or LSB channels. Then I would have worked from there.  Many simpler colorizations here have the same hue over selected areas, so while the brightness changes there the hue doesn't, and it's an obvious sign for (cheap) colorization."

Brush in with a reduced opacity brush for the skin first to get it down to his chin. You have to imagine where it is. Add skin in between the hairs. Then, on the beard/hairs layer, with a 1-2 px brush, stroke each the individual hairs. I know it’s crazy. One more thing..someone corrected me too.. his eyes were blue!

Colorization,3bkytz,TerrainTerrainPullUp,2,Tue Jun 30 01:55:37 2015 UTC,"I think most of the coloring is good. But I think the albedos on their faces is most likely grime and dirt and soot, not flushedness, so it would make sense for them to be grayer.   Also the primary coloring of the airplane dorsal livery seems unlikely, I'd want to compare with color pictures of RFC aircraft. I wouldn't be surprised frankly if they were just plain steel gray/silver colored.  You might also be dealing with ""false black"" from certain reds under certain B&W films, in which case you're going to need to probably adjust the saturation on those parts to get it ""right"".  Edit: Looking at an original version of this pic, I'm even more in doubt of the red. I don't think the change in darkness mid-way through the fuselage is an indication of paint, just of perhaps different metal.  Note the text by the rear seat: ""DO NOT FLY WITH... IN THE GUNNERS ... TRIM FOR CLIMBING."" If the plane is as dark red as you made it, it'd be extremely difficult to read that black text.  And also, oh wow... I didn't noticed it in the smaller version, but in the large version, you can see that the wheels of the airplane are BICYCLE SPOKED. Wow."
Colorization,3bkytz,romulusnr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:10:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thorough reply!  The colour scheme I was using was this one, which shows a fairly distinct brown drab. Regardless, though, it seems that a lighter green/brown/grey was more common, so I think I'm going to change it to that instead. That would make more sense to the image as well: my colours are clearly too dark!   Good catch on the dirt on the faces - I thought they seemed a little flushed.  My thought on the lighter area just aft the metal cowling was that it's the same hue as the rear fuselage. There's some pretty strong straight-on lighting that's reflecting off the cowling and fabric. Semi-gloss lacquer was still the norm for fabric aircraft.  ...and yeah, spoked wheels - It was the lightest and simplest way to do it, I guess!"

May I make one criticism - and this seems to be true for all posts on this sub - but the blue eyes seem too bright blue in tone. Lee's eyes are OK but they guy behind him has particularly bright eyes. Everything else is always spot on. On the sidebar you can see it in the example photo - it seems blue eyes in particular somehow end up looking like White Walkers from Game of Thrones.

I suggest you to search by reference photos and try to work with color variations. The hair is not so yellow - it has several layers and several different colors. The ambient light also have a huge influence on it.   Edited: Her foot and the car's interior are gray. You should never leave a completely gray area: paint with a light blue, light green, whatever, but never let it completely gray. This will ruin your work. The car's interior could be better worked."
Colorization,3bfy3e,marinamaral,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:11:03 2015 UTC,"The image looks like an illustration rather than a colorization. Color has been painted over the image rather than coloringizing the image - tinting it.  Most of the image has not been colored - it is grey.  Every color has been forced onto the image. Under the car there is grass, dirt and sticks - these need to be colored as just that. Nothing needs to be decided, these objects need to be the color they were when the photo was taken."

Colorization,3bby9j,ColinFiat,5,Sat Jun 27 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome image - I actually needed to study it in order to suggest improvements.  Not sure why you thought it a risky attempt - I'd say it was a competent result.  Everything I am about to note should be prefixed with, ""If I had done this..."" because it is fine as is.  The rubbish and rocks and sticks seem placed onto a carefully dirty ground. It is all too uniform, like the set from a western movie. One again you have been too precise.  Father's clothing holes should be showing skin? Would he have had Long Johns?  As already noted - the window. The left porch pole is reflected as too is the boy's head? And maybe some hills in the distance which leaves sky for the top half. But that does not explain those two dark stripes. They must be inside the door - part of the frame holding the glass in place. So many subtle colors missing.  Many nails have rusted and would have stained the wood a reddish color - to the left of father's head.  What impressed me was the choice of dirt on clothes and faces. Clean mother with a hint of dignity in lipstick, and filthy kids. Shoes that died two seasons ago and every mother's worst nightmare - unidentifiable white dirt on elder brother's knees.   Correct me if I'm wrong, are you still treating the wall as one complete object rather than a dozen individual planks of wood?  If you have a gallery somewhere this should be one of the candidates for the cover photo. (I've already looked for somewhere in the profile to link to a gallery or some method of using a signature but there seems to be none.)"

Notes: Preparation involved doubling the image size, converting to grey scale and back to full color, flood fill colorizing the entire image with color for mortar. Save a lot of time.  Start from the back and work forward making sure to color hidden objects over the tutu and hair.   The only use of layers involved painting the entire tutu then changing its opacity until the lacy parts appear semi-transparent. More solid tutu coloring was done after the layer flattened to the background.  Stray hair was colored at full opacity then the background washed over it very opaquely until each strand looked right.  The face was not given the usual detail and attention due to image quality and this being a video demo.  Total time taken was 2 hours."

Next I chose a darker brown and colored all the slightly darker ground sections and finally a third time with darker brown on the darkest ground. All with an opacity of 33%.  As with leaves, every dark spot in the sky being one leaf, every white spot on the ground is a rock.   I used a mid brown to paint the whitest areas of the jeans at 33% opacity. Then I did it again but included slightly darker areas too. And again over the same parts but including slightly darker areas. When I'd finished his knees were 100% brown and the entire blue area had been colored. Then I applied your original jean color all over repeatedly until I ended up with this result.

I've always enjoyed Laurel and Hardy and this photo made them look like two favorite uncles to me. I always spend quite a bit of time trying to get the skin tone correct which is awkward considering that it changes depending on the angle of the screen. I guess it's the same conundrum as when touching up a regular photo and a little bit more saturation always seems to 'lift' it a bit until suddenly you've gone too far!

Colorization,3aquli,ColinFiat,7,Mon Jun 22 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"Just some quick observations.  The front of the bus has red and green coloring in two places when there are many more items/objects. Building in the background reflects many uncolored objects. Top windows tinted green but should be reflecting sky. Red is too strong - over saturated and catches my eye all the time.   With so many parts a flat grey or dark red/brown, the image looks unfinished."
Colorization,3aquli,ColinFiat,2,Tue Jun 23 03:16:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comments! I'm not quite sure what you're talking about with the front of the bus? What do you mean?  I saw the building in the background as having those objects inside the warehouse as opposed to being reflections.  Top window tinted green as if you notice they hung cloth over the insides of the window and decided it was the same green material as on the bus front and side.  My feeling is that the old buses were very red, and being in a relatively dully coloured building yard it probrably would catch your attention more than other things.  I actually coloured literally everything and if it's grey or dark red its because I thought it was that. I did try and add rusty colours to parts of the chains etc to mix it up a bit but there's only so much you can do with metal equipment."
Colorization,3aquli,Boardwalk22,2,Tue Jun 23 08:46:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, inside or outside - some old photo's are hard to analyze sometimes. Looking at the image again, at the floor line of the room, it seems more like the horizon line, and the 'equipment' is actually a dirty great ship on water behind the building. I think the building may be almost empty and possibly without walls or completely glassed. Need to find out where the image was taken and check a map.  Umm, yes I can see green cloth hung inside the top windows and I can also see inside windows and outside reflections - hard to say, my mind flicks from one to the other.   A dirty mechanical environment is pretty boring I will agree. With an image like this I would either attempt everything bright and colorful with some level of inventiveness or do it all true to life dim, dark and flat but boost the saturation/vibrancy as a last image adjustment.   I had thought you'd not colored somethings such as the tires as they look flag when compared to objects around it. If I cannot see a change after coloring something then I do it again with slightly more blue; especially when in the distance. A natural object, bricks and people for example, that are grey looking even after coloring get a little bit of read. Likewise with nature and green.  A list ditched effort to give something color is to invent a very thin shell halo around it; basically coloring what is around or behind it with a hint of color. (If none of these work I may dump the image and move on...)  Off to work (night shift) but I may have a test color of this image and see what happens. (If it's good I'll show you, but if bad I'll hide it in shame and pretend I had no time :-)"
Colorization,3aquli,Boardwalk22,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:01:45 2015 UTC,"I could not find a more clear or larger image which is a shame. Immediately when coloring myself I could see why the red appears so bright in your image - it is highly saturated in the original. After throwing down random colors on various engine parts and the tires I switched to your image to some inspiration and suddenly I could see all your engine parts.   Hmm, some parts of the image need an increase in saturation/vibrancy and others need a mild softening. Definitely a difficult image to work on.

Colorization,3atfo4,ColinFiat,2,Tue Jun 23 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"Ummm. An HSL base 255 of 22|80|128 is #A88158  http://www.workwithcolor.com/hsl-color-picker-01.htm?cp=A88158  But each RGB value will change depending on how bright the pixels are - the luminance. Also, using a saturation of 80/255 (31%) is for a general image; some are more pale and others are darker/stronger. And changing the saturation will also change each of the RGB values.  Hue is another name for color: red, orange, yellow, green, aqua, blue, purple, pink. Saturation is how strong or intense the color is. eg: lips can be soft pink, low saturation or lipstick coated pink and very strong, high saturation. Luminance is brightness: almost white down to almost black. A very bright red can be light, medium brightness or very dark but it is still a strong or high saturation red.  Once you become accustomed to thinking in HSL, you need only worry about the Hue or color of an object, it is easy to test and find a base setting for saturation from how strong the colors are according to the quality of the entire image. The luminance is already in the image as shades of grey for each pixel. This means you need only worry about one value, not three."

Colorization,3amv2c,DangerDegan,6,Sun Jun 21 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"Original and side by side comparison.  One of the most opulent and rarest cars ever created, The Bugatti Royale (also known as the Bugatti Type 41) was a luxury car crafted and designed by Ettore Bugatti in 1927. The Bugatti Royale is an enormous vehicle weighing up to 4 tons and one of the longest automobiles ever produced. When compared to newer vehicles, the Bugatti is about 10% longer than a Ford Super Duty F-450 truck and weighs about the same.  Ettore had plans to build only 25 of the Bugatti Royale and sell them to royals, but even the wealthy were not into paying $30,000 for a automobile during the Depression. Out of the 6 Ettore actually made, Bugatti ended up only selling 3.  The Bugatti Royale in this particular photo was designed and styled by Jean Bugatti, son of Ettore Bugatti.  The car was especially designed for Dr.Armand Esders, a clothing manufacturer, who ordered a car without any headlights as this would impair the beautiful design. He had, as he said, no plans to drive after sunset anyhow. After a few years of ownership, Dr. Armand Esders sold the Roadster to a french politician who had the cars body restyled to look more like the Coupe De Ville model.  A reproduction of the original Bugatti Royale ‘Esders’ Roadster is currently on display at the Musee National de l’Automobile in Mulhouse, France."

You did a fantastic job on the window reflections, by the way.  I think the original photo had some image quality issues, noticeable around the lower right section of the door on the vehicle, kind of looks like a smiley face.

Colorization,3aqvj6,XxMONKABONKAxX,3,Mon Jun 22 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to find enough material and time to create a tutorial on the math/science or facts about photo's, color and colorization in general. One item will be, ""What color is human skin?""  The answer is : orange.  I created this image a few minutes ago which shows a square of skin from each shoulder, then a grey scale square and finally a colorized grey scale square using Hue:18/255 Saturation:129/255 and Luminance from image itself for every square.  Normally for old photo's I'd use a hue of 22 and vary the saturation until it looks good.  Melanin is primarily responsible for skin color. Darker skin has more. But the fact is that the general hue of melanin on the colorwheel I use is about 20 / 255 or 7.5% of the color range (28 degs on a color wheel with red at zero. )"
Colorization,3aqvj6,ColinFiat,2,Tue Jun 23 02:46:17 2015 UTC,"Human skin color:       Human skin color ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white hues. Human skin pigmentation is the result of natural selection. Skin pigmentation in human beings evolved primarily to regulate the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.   The actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances, although the single most important substance is the pigment melanin. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skinned humans. The skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible, especially in the face, when, as consequence of physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system (anger, fear), arterioles dilate.   There is a direct correlation between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that receive higher amounts of UVR, generally located closer to the equator, tend to have darker-skinned populations. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower intensity of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations.  Researchers suggest that human populations over the past 50,000 years have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned and vice versa as they migrated to different UV zones,  and that such major changes in pigmentation may have happened in as little as 100 generations (~2,500 years) through selective sweeps.    Natural skin color can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells.  In addition, it has been observed that adult human females on average are significantly lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight, which helps it absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.

Colorization,3amu2s,BigNuggie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:38:23 2015 UTC,"The German 'guard' is wearing a Heer M41 tunic with M36 bottle green collar, not SS. He also lacks any SS unit or rank ensignia. Doesn't mean he wasn't a guard but it raises a lot of questions.  'Official' captions from 'reliable' sources should always be taken with a grain of salt: many are imcomplete or simply wrong."
Colorization,3amu2s,Rumrmc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:53:06 2015 UTC,"I always have a big trouble to find reliable sources with real military uniforms photos to use as reference for the colors I need. I see a lot of different colors in the same uniform when I search for it on google images and it blows my mind. There is any good website where I can access photos of military uniforms, especially from WW1, WW2 and from the Civil War? And there is also some subreddit where I can send a photo and ask people to help me to identify the uniform?"

Colorization,3amr23,Tobi-As,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:20:20 2015 UTC,What do you think about my attemp? I found it really hard because the source is so dark and has a lot of noise.  Also what colors would you have used? This picture was taken 50 years ago. I thought everything would be more or less gray. But that colorange is totally boring.
