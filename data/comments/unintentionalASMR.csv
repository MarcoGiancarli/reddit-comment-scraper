unintentionalASMR,3e4bo7,Baba_Smith,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:38 2015 UTC,I've watched so many of this guy's videos. Thanks for the share!
unintentionalASMR,3e0npx,were_only_human,6,Tue Jul 21 01:26:05 2015 UTC,I started watching for the ASMR a while ago but now it is just one of my favorite YouTube channels in general. Tim is such a passionate dude about Toys/knick knacks and it is really cool to see him gain popularity with his channel.
unintentionalASMR,3e0npx,nova2wl,6,Tue Jul 21 15:55:50 2015 UTC,That whole channel is great.
unintentionalASMR,3e0npx,fromkentucky,7,Tue Jul 21 12:16:43 2015 UTC,The fact that it's clearly just an old guy whose loves toys for fucking decades is great. He bought this in 1979! I bet in 1979 when his hobby was already well established he didn't think in a few decades time he would be talking about toys in videos watched by people all over the globe.  I suspect he imagined even less that one dark dingy corner of the Internet would sit there and listen to him to fall asleep.
unintentionalASMR,3e153c,graf2,3,Tue Jul 21 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why this video was so much easier to keep on than other videos about math, and then I realized it was because the pronunciation was so clear and the speaking tone so positive. I've gotten in the habit of just keeping them on even if my attention drifts elsewhere, so I figure it'd be a good fit here.  It reminds me of those smithsonian videos they'd show in classrooms as a kid. High production value, upbeat yet patient vibe."
unintentionalASMR,3e153c,Sleepy_proxy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:03 2015 UTC,She's so easy to listen to... I wish I could have replaced my linear algebra professor with her and any future professors too.

Though the intentional artists who get a bit too close, the proximity with 3D binaural, of some of the whisperers out there just seem a little OTT, I've noticed the tone of the close proximity videos going to an almost ""soft porn"" style now, anyone can whisper, anyone can talk gentle, anyone with a nice body can be attractive.... But... not everyone is a true ASMR artist in my personal opinion, for the majority of those that are, have absolutely no idea they are. Most of the big name are very relaxing, and almost trigger me, I've been comatose a few times, but they are nothing like what I get from the unintentional ones."

I miss the innocent times when every kind of video was well received there, and ASMRtists were just one more way to enjoy the sensation. It didn't matter whether the poster was male or female, binaural audio was just a niche and stuff was simples. Nowadays the circlejerk around specific posters is waaay too overboard, especially those who resort to... physical attributes. Seriously, come on, I KNOW who 90% of these people are, I can just go to their cahnnel, no need to repost their videos daily. And just like you said, anyone can speak softly or move their hands in a gentle way, but producing quality content is something else altogether.

We will just send AI and human embryos, when the AI gets there it can colonise the planet and build another ship.   I find the traditional movie method of sending people in a sleep state in a ship on auto pilot far easier to believe would be possible at some point it would take much less technology to set a ship on auto pilot with people in hibernation.   But shrug , ill just get back to my asmr pleasures"

The premise not only revolves around a very mature form of AI but also the sort of robotics that could raise children , make a planet habitable and mine/gather resources for these needs.

unintentionalASMR,352j2x,I2ichmond,9,Thu May 7 05:40:55 2015 UTC,This was posted in /r/videos today and they're ripping this lady apart and calling her a psycho. I thought her hand movements were very relaxing.
unintentionalASMR,352j2x,ballpoint_peen,4,Wed May 6 15:49:15 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I read the comments and was surprised. No doubt she's weird but I don't think the video deserved all that. Especially for being as relaxing as it was.
unintentionalASMR,352j2x,Ya_Dingus,3,Thu May 7 02:56:17 2015 UTC,She's definitely taking the hand protection to the extreme. I'd be a bit weird(er) too if I couldn't use my hands for anything.

unintentionalASMR,352j2x,roofuskit,11,Thu May 7 03:07:47 2015 UTC,Arrogant and I'd say eccentric. But she is getting interviewed because she's a hand model. I don't think they wanted her to sit there with her hands folded on her lap. Of course she's going to do hand modelly things.

unintentionalASMR,31k7xy,ThemDangVidyaGames,12,Mon Apr 6 09:40:00 2015 UTC,"Hey there new redditor, it looks like your new to reddit and don't realize there's two types of posts. There's regular posts, which is a link only; and self-posts, which is text only. It seems you have tried to do both (which you can't), and accidentally made a self-post, which cancels out any links you may have put into the hyperlink field.   Unfortunately, you can't put both a link and a body of text in one post, though there are workarounds. You can either put the link in with the rest of the text of a self post, or post a regular link and make a reply in the comments section with the additional info you wanted to provide. A bit weird and unintuitive, but that's the way posting on reddit has been for awhile now. It's a bit confusing, but hopefully I've been clear enough to help."

unintentionalASMR,30df9t,DishoveledPanda,3,Fri Mar 27 00:57:41 2015 UTC,interesting find! I'm curious to know how he gets the folded $100 on the top to stick so well. Also how is all his money in $100 bills? people buy drugs in all denominations  edit: looks like he staples them together
unintentionalASMR,30df9t,FLOCKA,5,Thu Mar 26 23:57:37 2015 UTC,Since all the bills are crisp and creaseless i think he went to the bank and got all new ones? Isn't that a thing you can do?   So trade all your lousy 10's and 20's for brand new 100's
unintentionalASMR,30df9t,DrDrips,2,Fri Mar 27 00:20:28 2015 UTC,He is probably just higher up and sells to smaller dealers. So he sells $500 at a time and nobody does 20's when you're buying $500 worth. It's just something that's looked down upon. Like when you go to the grocery nobody wants to pay in all ones.   If he went to the bank to get all hundreds then he isn't a very smart dealer as that is pretty sketchy thing to do. Also that leaves a trail that the police can and will follow if you come under their radar.
unintentionalASMR,30df9t,alexx138,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:53:30 2015 UTC,I've always wondered how dealers convert their cash in to large bills.

But I'm curious, what sorts of things triggered you when you where young? There are some moments that you just remember. ..  (1) Once in computer class in elementary school I was pressing the number keys on the far right of the board in order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, etc.). This girl sitting next to me took over my keyboard and did the same thing. I watched 'cause dude thats my keyboard bitch... that made my head feel heavy. Or I was nauseated. Im not sure. I was drowsy  (2) Audiologist/hearingaid appointments. Dude, they touch your ears. And they also do this thing where they fill your ears to make earmolds... ohh. man. its usually like a cold thing and then they also press it in... make sure nothing is alround your eyars SIGHHHSSS  (3) I also like the way some professors write numbers on the blackboard. I will sit there for an hour and not understand a single but still be sort of in a trance or something cause of the writing, and the page flipping, and all the ... tinkering."

Like this ridiculous video about a ufo or angels or something.  A few others that do it for me but I'm not sure why:  Dude showing you how to look at the sketchy permissions that apps have  Girl shows off her squishy toys  German kid tries to explain how to make trading cards in paint  Maybe we have some more triggers in common? I dunno"

Anyway, this particular part of the show always gets me for some reason, and since we may have common triggers, i thought you would enjoy it as well. There are a total of 8 parts of the show uploaded atm. Don't bother with the rest of the show unless you're curious of course ;)"
unintentionalASMR,2x6rym,Wedhro,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"Since science doesn't even recognize ASMR as a thing, I don't think is possible to say what can be a trigger and what not. Not only it's personal but IME it changes from time to time, for example there are days nothing triggers me and others I can almost be put to sleep by someone talking.  I guess all we can do is experiment, and stop bothering when it doesn't work because IMO stress is not good for ASMR."
