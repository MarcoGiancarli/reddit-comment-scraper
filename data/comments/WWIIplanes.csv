WWIIplanes,3e1x1t,filipv,6,Tue Jul 21 09:20:24 2015 UTC,"While it looks that way, it's actually a line drawing for the Messerschmitt Me 209 V6, one of the prototypes for the Me 209 fighter. That aircraft was proposed to replace the ageing Bf 109 design and developed to address certain issues with that aircraft.   One of the noteworthy details of the Me 209 is the wide-tracked landing gear. The V5-version was powered by the Junkers Jumo 213 V-12, in a similar configuration as the engine that powered the FW 190D, so with an annular radiator, giving it the appearance of a radial.   Test flights revealed the Me 209 V5 was some 50km/h slower than the FW 190D and further work on the aircraft was halted.  This Me 209 shouldn't be confused with the earlier Me 209 racing aircraft of 1938."

Come in high at an oblique angle, turn toward the target and dive below the most numerous guns, building speed and then zoom climb up to attack the belly and wings of the enemy bomber.  Once the attack is over, break turn away at an oblique to their tail to gain separation distance as fast as possible.  They basically were doing a boom and zoom we had to relearn during Vietnam."

The only Thunderbolt with the F-suffix was the XP-47F, which was used for a P-47B fitted with a laminar flow wing. It was an experimental version to see whether that type of wing would improve performance over the standard P-47 models in service at the time."

WWIIplanes,3dz3n4,Dressedw1ngs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"FYI, I didn't downvote you. Your comment isn't off-topic or something ;-)  However, there was no P-47F production model, only the XP-47F experimental aircraft with the laminar flow wing.  The aircraft on the Luftwaffe Resource Center page you linked to is P-47D-5-RA ""Beetle"" (s/n 42-22490) YF*U, which was flown by Lt. Roach of the 355th Fighter Group. ""Agnes"" was the name of Lt. Roach's wife or girlfriend and her name was painted on the side of the cockpit. ""Beetle"" mistakenly landed at the Luftwaffe airfield at Caen, France and was the first intact P-47 captured by the Germans. It was later provided with the Stammkennzeichen T9+FK.  The Luftwaffe also captured a P-47D-16-RE (s/n 42-75971), which crash-landed in German territory (on a German-held airfield near Rome, Italy according to this page) but was repaired. It carried the Stammkennzeichen T9+LK. That P-47D is the aircraft that's pictured on OP's photo.  edit: Formatting, and proof I didn't downvote!  edit 2: Source for the information. Both P-47s are listed near the bottom, although s/n 42-75971 is mistakenly mentioned as a P-47D-11-RE and not a D-16-RE. Some sources claim it's a D-15-RA as well, but the serial number list on this page refutes that: s/n 42-75865 - 76118 : Republic P-47D-16-RE Thunderbolt.   edit 3: Part one, part two and part three of an article on ""Beetle"" are worth a read as well."
WWIIplanes,3dz3n4,Elbie79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"You are right, I was going off an old book that lists the P-47F as the captured plane, and also says the P-47F was an improved P-47D razorback."
WWIIplanes,3dz3n4,Dressedw1ngs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, but that doesn't matter. It makes searching for the right information all the more fun :-P  That the XP-47F was an ""improved razorback"" is kind of correct, of course, because the P-47B on which it was based was a razorback model as well. The bubble top was introduced in the P-47D-25 block and retained in subsequent models."

Pretty sure that is how 50s car shows and hot rods got started.  Notice they are all shined up and nicely marked.  Service aircraft usually looked ridden hard and put away wet.

My father told me when I was young and spending all my time making my black Mach 1 Mustang faster, shiner and driving it more aggressive and daring than the other guys my age with their camaros and challengers, ""You aren't impressing the girls, more like you are comparing manhood with the other guys.""

They flew the Northrop T-38B Talon.  We always monitored the simulators when the students or instructors flew them. They would come into the simulator bay, and sign in on a Form 781 to record their time. One day, a new pilot came in and signed in on my simulator. I don't recall his first name, but his last name was Gabreski. I kind of jokingly asked him if he knew Frank Gabreski. He said, ""Yeah. He's my father."" I was blown away!

WWIIplanes,3di30s,Elbie79,5,Thu Jul 16 20:32:36 2015 UTC,"P-39s were not popular with US Pilots, and while they were pressed to service early on they were quickly replaced.   Soviets loved them though, so there's that.   ""It soon became the joke in the Pacific Theater that a P-400 was a P-40 with a Zero on its tail."""
WWIIplanes,3di30s,Dressedw1ngs,2,Thu Jul 16 20:36:43 2015 UTC,"They were still used though, but judging by the downvotes their role in U.S. service is even less appreciated by ""the community"" than those of the P-38 and the P-40 8-)"
WWIIplanes,3di30s,Elbie79,3,Thu Jul 16 21:46:41 2015 UTC,I didn't downvote you.  And the difference between the P39 and the P40/P38 is that it was not successful at its job.
WWIIplanes,3di30s,Dressedw1ngs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:48:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't say you did :-P  But anyway, the P-39 was used in the Pacific by the USAAF and thus played its small, but important part in the battle against the Japanese. That it was less than ideally suited for its intended role as a fighter is a fact, but doesn't really matter."
WWIIplanes,3dig1m,elite172,8,Thu Jul 16 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"Photo shows a b-24 shortly after its crash.  The white object was Sgt Guillot's parachute, which he was planning to use to burn the plane.  That scheme was abandoned when a quick head count showed three men were missing, presumably still in the wreckage.  (Photo from Enrico Schwartz)  THE KAMENITSA CREW, 576th Squadron Plane #42-100371, Doodle Bug  The Kamenitsa crew in early April 1944.   Back row (l-r): 2Lt John Faas (KIA 7-7-44), 2Lt John Caulfield, 2Lt Gene Miller, S/Sgt Edwin Heater, Sgt Jack Krejci.  Front row (l-r): Sgt Oliver Guillot, 2Lt William Kamenitsa, Sgt ArchieYoung, Sgt Lark Morgan, S/Sgt Joseph Trivison. (Photo from Oliver ""Bud"" Guillot)  The crew had gone through training with the Rogers crew and the twenty men were close friends.  The Kamenitsa crew took off at 0732.  Around 1100 while north of Hannover, fighters attacked Ofenstein's plane, which was flying just to the left and slightly behind Kamenitsa.  They apparently scored some direct hits to the front part of the plane as Ofenstein's plane first tilted, with the right wing just above Kamenitsa's left wing, and then abruptly dropped, breaking off about ten feet of Kamenitsa's left wing and the entire left aileron.  Graham immediately salvoed the bombs from the pilot's pedestal while Kamenitsa fought to keep the plane under control.  Because of the missing wing section, the left side of the plane was getting very little lift, causing the left wing to drop and making the plane circle to the left.  To compensate, Kamenitsa put full power to the left engines and reduced power on the right engines.  The correction did not allow them to fly ""straight"" but it did keep them from going into a full spin and certain death for most of the crew.  He told the crew he thought he could get them back to England, if he could just get into some cloud cover.     From the back, Sgt Morgan reported that his guns had jammed.  At the waist, Sgt Krejci was so intent on firing at the Me-109s that he wasn't aware Kamenitsa had lowered his wheels as a sign of surrender.  When he heard Kamenitsa telling the gunners over the interphone to ""cease fire"" he didn't understand why.  It wasn't until Sgt Guillot pointed to their left wing that he realized they were in trouble.  The fighters finally stopped shooting at the crippled B-24 but they continued to circle the plane all the way down.    Engineer Heater stood between the pilots' seats and used his fingernails to scrape ice from the windshield so Kamenitsa could see.  He headed for a large field, with the B-24's undercarriage brushing the trees at its edge.  They touched down at about 150 mph and all went smoothly at first.  Then the nose wheel hit a ditch or road and collapsed, burying the nose in the ground where it plowed a furrow for a few hundred yards. The top turret caved in, cutting Heater's legs and pushing the armor plating behind the pilots forward, ramming them against their steering columns.  When the plane finally stopped moving, the nose section was buried under the cockpit and there was nothing in front of the pilots but dirt.  In the back, the two waist gunners had been holding tightly to their guns.  When the nose hit and the plane abruptly stopped, they were hurled toward the front of the plane over Sgt Young's head, finally colliding with a forward bulkhead.  Survivors agreed it was miracle that the plane never caught fire.     The German fighters kept close watch on the downed crew from the air until civilians took them prisoner.  They were eventually taken to an air raid shelter in Hanover where someone commented that the Rogers crew was probably already back in England drinking beers in their honor.  Then the door opened and the surviving members of the Rogers crew walked in.   source: http://www.b24.net/stories/annette.htm"

The plan called for B-17 aircraft which had been taken out of operational service – various nicknames existed such as ""robot"", ""baby"", ""drone"" or ""weary Willy""  – to be loaded to capacity with explosives, and flown by radio control into bomb-resistant fortifications such as German U-boat pens and V-weapon sites. It was hoped that this would match the British success with Tallboy and Grand Slam ground penetration bombs but the project was dangerous, expensive and unsuccessful.

WWIIplanes,3cv2gb,michaelconfoy,4,Sat Jul 11 00:38:15 2015 UTC,What did the poor Finns ever do to deserve one of those clunkers?
WWIIplanes,3cv2gb,rocketman0739,8,Sat Jul 11 06:16:32 2015 UTC,The adjective in your question before Finns I believe is the answer.
WWIIplanes,3cv2gb,Anzelmk,7,Sat Jul 11 06:25:16 2015 UTC,"Finns actually really liked B-239. Their top ace  Ilmari Juutilainen, scored 34 of his 94½ kills in B-239. One of the B-239 (number BW-364) was used to score 42½ air kills.  Abysmal service record in pacific was mostly due to fact that brewster was used by inexperienced pilots trying to get into a turning fight with japanese fighters.  On top of their inexperience allied intelliegence completely failed to inform pilots about performances of japanese planes and pilots. Everyone underestimated japanese, expecting poorly trained pilots flying outdated aircrafts. Plus there was a healthy dose of racism involved. It was a common belief that asians are short sighted, and can't sustain high g-loads.  When you combine all of that you get a recipe for a massacre that happend over Singapore."

WWIIplanes,3cv2gb,LeRoienJaune,3,Sat Jul 11 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"The Buffalos, due to their lack of demand, were the best plane available for delivery on short notice. During the Winter War, Finland needed planes ASAP. Better planes were going to fill prior orders made by the USAF, the RAF, and the French air force.  Also, the poor reputation of the Buffalo derives from three things (1) Inexperienced pilots (2) Poor numbers (3) untested designs. Most of the Pacific theatre pilots in 1941 were the second rate, less experienced sorts- the good units were all in the European theatre. In most instances where the Buffalo operated in the Pacific, it was severely outnumbered by elite Japanese squadrons.   The Finns, by removing the naval equipment, adding superchargers, and armor inserts, were able to make the F2A into an adequate fighter, comparable to an early Hurricane. Lastly, the chief problem of the F2A was the radiator. In the arctic conditions of the Winter War, the F2A did not experience over-heating problems."

Years later, other crews reported seeing him flying through the formation still sitting on the TG's bicycle seat and holding the handles to his twin .50's. According to Urich himself, just before the blast he bent over to talk on his radio. This was the exact time that the blast hit the plane. He was knocked unconscious and fell from the plane.

A contemporary of the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane, it was the Royal Air Force's first single-seat, twin-engined, cannon-armed fighter.  When it first flew in 1938, the Whirlwind was one of the fastest and most heavily-armed combat aircraft in the world. Protracted development problems with its Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines delayed the project and only a relatively small number of Whirlwinds were built. During the Second World War, only three RAF squadrons were equipped with the Whirlwind, and despite its successful use as a fighter and ground attack aircraft it was withdrawn from service in 1943.

Fun fact 2: the J-21R had the ability to carry a gun pod with 8 x 13.2mm machine guns under the belly. Those could be fired together with the main armament in the nose (4 x 13.2mm MG's + 1 x 20mm cannon), apparently being a ""sensation"" for the pilot :-P"

WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,notbob1959,18,Fri Jul 3 14:01:27 2015 UTC,What I find impressive is the P-38s ability to keep up with the bombers on a single engine.
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,filipv,8,Fri Jul 3 17:03:50 2015 UTC,"I've heard about the P-38's flight characteristics on one engine but I can't remember if it was ""really good"" or ""really bad."" I'd imagine it was pretty poor. In any case, the pilot workload must be atrocious."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,dziban303,5,Fri Jul 3 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"B-17 max speed: ~287 mph  cruising:~250 mph P-38 max speed: ~443 mph And realize that drag has a quadratic relationship with speed.  For example, you can't double the power and go twice as fast. To go twice as fast, with everything else being the same, you need ~4x the power. 4 times faster, and you need ~16x the power! 8 times faster, and you need ~64x the power! 16 times faster, and you need ~256x the power!"
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,savannah_dude,3,Sat Jul 4 01:59:52 2015 UTC,"IIRC it's the relationship between drag force and velocity that's quadratic. The relationship between velocity and power is actually cubic (!!!) so for twice the speed, you'd need eight times the power."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Mayonnaise1995,2,Sat Jul 4 03:16:34 2015 UTC,Really?  Where is the rest of the energy going?  For example at 4x faster: You say that it takes ~64x the power?   Why? I say that it takes ~16x more power.     Where's all that extra resistance?
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,savannah_dude,2,Sat Jul 4 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"Drag force is given by F = 1/2Aρc(v2), where ρ is fluid density, c is the object's coefficient of drag, A is it's cross-section area, and v is its velocity. Power is given by force times velocity, so substituting in we get P = 1/2Aρc(v2)*v, or just P = 1/2Aρc(v3)."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Mayonnaise1995,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"I vaguely remember P = F * V. Seems a bit weird though... Suppose that you have one of those compressed air cans . Let's just assume that it produces 1N of force when 'fired'.  If it's attached to Voyager 1 (travelling at about 13000 m/s), that little air can is producing 13,000 watts?  Seems odd to me."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,savannah_dude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:12:31 2015 UTC,Drag is nothing to worry about in space.
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Mayonnaise1995,9,Sun Jul 5 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"It's actually relatively easy for a p38, b17s were not fast heavy bombers even when they had dropped their loads. Their cruising speed in formation was less than 220 mph, and a p38 being a much lighter aircraft then a heavy bomber could easily keep up that cruising speed on one engine"
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,biggs2961,8,Fri Jul 3 17:59:35 2015 UTC,"Great shot showing all of the oil streaming down the engine.    Question:  If they were jumped by German fighters, would the P38 try to tuck into the formation or attempt to fight it out without straying too far from the formation?"
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,an_actual_lawyer,10,Fri Jul 3 16:24:19 2015 UTC,i would guess tuck under all those big angry .50 cal machineguns on the bombers.
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Gark32,3,Fri Jul 3 16:52:33 2015 UTC,Did those actually work effectively?  I always wondered.
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,uconnhusky,3,Sat Jul 4 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"They worked, but not really well enough.  There's a reason that they had a big push to extend the range of the P-38/47 and to make the P-51 available ASAP.  The bombers took some fearsome losses when they had spend significant time in enemy territory unescorted."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Merad,2,Sat Jul 4 13:29:32 2015 UTC,"well, it's a hell of a volume of fire and easier to bring to bear than a whole airplane. i'd wager they were as effective as any turret-based defenses could be."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Gark32,2,Sat Jul 4 01:21:21 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really answer my question, but thank you :)"
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,uconnhusky,7,Sat Jul 4 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"It didn't work, basically.  Bomber losses were atrocious until good fighter cover was developed.    The idea was that the huge swarm of bombers would all cover each other, since no fighter could escort the bombers deep into Germany and back.  With a modicum of tactics, the interceptors were not within range long enough to have the MG fire be effective"
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,SirNoName,2,Sat Jul 4 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"OK thank you for answering.  That is how I always thought it went down.  So the machine guns on the bombers were sort of a last ditch effort, scare tactic type thing?  Wouldn't be surprised if it made the pilots feel better though, knowing that they had something to shoot back with."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,uconnhusky,2,Sat Jul 4 10:42:36 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no.  Did the bombers have the ability to fight through a determined interceptor defense on their own without prohibitive loss? No.  Did the armor and defense firepower of the bombers force the enemy to use increasingly heavily armored and armed interceptors to combat them? Yes.  And the heavy enemy interceptors then became less able to defend themselves from escorting fighters."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,p47d35,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:39:10 2015 UTC,"I always thought a bullet would tear through a plane like paper, were they actually like, really armored?  With thick metal or whatever, I don't know anything about this stuff but its fascinating."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,uconnhusky,2,Sun Jul 5 01:51:33 2015 UTC,"Airplanes cannot be armored like tanks, but the can have armor plate or self-sealing fuel tanks or redundant systems to make them difficult to shoot down.  Most plate armor is restricted to things like the pilot's seat back."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,p47d35,7,Sun Jul 5 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"He would tuck in to the bombers. It was a regular thing for P-38's with an engine down. He could fly without that engine just fine, but couldn't hope to fight without it."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Knubinator,4,Fri Jul 3 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"Don't know if there was a protocol for such a thing, I suppose it would be up to the personality of the pilot."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Hermann_Von_Salza,5,Fri Jul 3 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"If the pilot had any semblance of sense, he'd tuck in for safety.  The P-38 is worthless in a fight with one engine out.  For instance, the pilots were taught not to roll or turn into the dead engine.  That, coupled with the power loss, and other factors, means it'd be pretty foolish to try and fight with one engine."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,eidetic,2,Fri Jul 3 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"Question: If they were jumped by German fighters, would the P38 try to tuck into the formation or attempt to fight it out without straying too far from the formation?

WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,FoodBeerBikesMusic,7,Fri Jul 3 21:27:40 2015 UTC,At least he still managed to feather that prop! Or he would have had to circle down to the ground.
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Rooivalk1,5,Fri Jul 3 22:15:05 2015 UTC,Could you explain this further? I assume it's something to do with the variable pitch of the prop?
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,squiffythewombat,4,Fri Jul 3 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"it's more to do with the big flat surfaces that a prop has. if it's feathered it's skinny end toward the wind, if it's not it's a big sail pulling the craft that direction."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Gark32,2,Sat Jul 4 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  You'd want to reduce drag on that dead prop.  Otherwise, you are going to incur a lot of extra drag attempting to keep the plane going straight.  Think of riding in a car while holding your hand out of the window... It's a lot easier when your palm is facing the ground."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,savannah_dude,3,Sat Jul 4 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"I know some of the crew members of the Pelican 16 Sahara crash and they told me that after two engine failures on the starboard side, the pitch control failed when the engines ceased. This put them into a circular flight path that could not be corrected unless power of the two remaining engines was reduced to very little, and this meant they were going to have to go down. Which they did. Not a single casualty. This crash was handled very professionally, and while the aircraft remains in the desert, the accident is still used as an example of how to do the right thing in such a situation."
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Rooivalk1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:57:08 2015 UTC,I'd be surprised if any 4 engine plane can stay airborne with 2 engines on 1 wing out.  That dead outboard especially would create a lot of torque that needs to be cancelled.
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,savannah_dude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:20:03 2015 UTC,Only with prop feathering and full rudder trim + probably full rudder to compensate.
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,Rooivalk1,2,Sat Jul 4 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"Oh I thought so, thanks for the great analogy though, makes sense. So in terms of feathering these while in flight, would that be a hydrualic system?"
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,squiffythewombat,3,Sat Jul 4 21:00:08 2015 UTC,I'm suprised that the pilot can independently control the pitch of each prop. Right?
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,plastiqmanb,7,Sat Jul 4 02:01:43 2015 UTC,"Nah that was and still is, a common capability"
WWIIplanes,3bzsdu,SirNoName,2,Sat Jul 4 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"Just like multi-engined aircraft have two throttles and two mixture control levers, prop pitch and feathering also must be independent for just such an emergency as this one."

WWIIplanes,3bsrfe,LtDan61350,2,Thu Jul 2 03:13:44 2015 UTC,"No, as LtDan mentioned, ETO recognition bands were introduced because during the initial missions by the Pioneer Mustang Group, it was discovered that the silhouettes of the Luftwaffe Messerschmitt BF-109's resembled closely those of the newly introduced P-51B's, and Allied (U.S. and RAF) fighter pilots not yet familiar with this new fighter type repeatedly attacked the P-51 formations."

There's one interesting example of B-25s in the Med who's officers thought they were safe on the ground and thus plain aluminum, but were attacked in force by the Germans after which a hasty coat of whatever green paint they could find was applied only to the top surfaces.  The incident was lampooned in the novel Catch-22."

It gave the Japanese important knowledge about the workings of high-performance in-line aircraft engines (the DB-601 inverted V-12, in this case), which they had little experience with. Most of their aircraft were powered by simpler radial engines, which were easier to use and maintain.  Eventually, the testing with the Bf 109s led to the design of the excellent Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien fighter for the IJAAS, which was powered by a licence-built DB-601, the Kawasaki Ha-40.   The Aichi company also built a DB-601 copy for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, the Atsuta, which was used in the Yokosuka D4Y Suisei dive bomber and the Aichi M6Y Seiran torpedo bomber.  edit: Terminology..."

WWIIplanes,3bfqpq,Elbie79,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:59:11 2015 UTC,"The Ki-61 did feature self-sealing fuel tanks and armour protection for the pilot and vital parts, though. Not all Japanese aircraft were built with an emphasis on manoeuvrability and range, like the A6M Zero was.   Additional protective measures depended on the intended role of the aircraft as well and the Ki-61 was meant as an interceptor, so the ability to fly very long distances was less important than with the A6M. Weight was therefore less of a concern, and armour and self-sealing tanks were deemed useful."

No experienced flying boat crew flying boat crew was hoping to take on fighters. The odds rarely favored the defensive armament of a bomber/patrol/recon plane over fighter aircraft. Zero pilots didn't fly around avoiding engagements thinking ""my fuel tanks don't self-seal"".  B-17s/B-24s were even more heavily armed and actually designed with being attacked in mind. Unlike the ' Cats'! they also flew in large formations for mutual defense. With all that, if they got caught without fighter escort they were slaughtered by enemy fighters. Now if you wanna stand in a big clear plexiglas bubble with a .50 going 100 knots and try and hit two or three A6M's with pilots that have cut their teeth on aerial gunnery and air combat maneuvering that are already shooting at you before they are in your .50's range, and have positioned themselves to minimum counter fire exposure, well you go man."

They look cool in their 'gumpy' way, no doubt.  There is a former WWII PBY base in Oregon. They had the non-amphibious version so they could carry more fuel for extended range. Their patrols lasted over 12 hours flying 80-90 knots looking for subs that were rarely, if ever seen off the Pacific NW coast line. I might prefer combat to that misery. I also seriously doubt many Japanese fighter pilots were surprised by the minimal defensive firepower of the Cat. Everything but transports were pretty much armed with at least one .50'."

WWIIplanes,39tnix,autowikibot,2,Sun Jun 14 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"Schräge Musik:       In World War II, Schräge Musik was the name the Germans gave to upward-firing autocannons that the Luftwaffe mounted in night fighter aircraft. A similar fitment was used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and known by a different, undocumented name in their twin-engined night fighters. The Luftwaffe and the IJN air arm had their first victories with fighter-mounted upward-firing autocannons in May 1943.  Schräge Musik derives from the contemporary German colloquialism for jazz music (the German word schräg literally means slanted or oblique)   Night fighters used this device to approach and attack Allied bombers from below, outside the bomber crew's usual field of view. Few bombers of that era (except for American heavy bombers with ventral (underside-mounted) ball turrets) carried defensive guns in the ventral position. The ventral turret on some early Avro Lancasters was sighted by periscope from within the fuselage, as with the first examples of the B-17E Flying Fortress's remotely operated Bendix-designed ventral turret (before the Sperry ball turret was adopted) and proved of little use. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped fighter was typically a surprise to the bomber crew, who only realized a fighter was close by when they came under fire. Particularly in the initial stage of operational use, until early 1944, Allied crews often attributed sudden fire from below to ground fire rather than a fighter.

WWIIplanes,39oqmi,FoodBeerBikesMusic,2,Sat Jun 13 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"Higher velocity air would mean you potentially could cram more air into the combustion chamber than if it were slower. However, it has nothing to do with heat. Cooler air is denser air and therefore has more oxygen which is what allows the fuel to combust. That's why all the rice boys brag about their ""cold air intake"". A gasoline engine has a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio of 14.7 which makes maximum power so more oxygen means more fuel can be mixed with it which increases the overall power of each combustion cycle. That's where turbos and super chargers come into play, cram more air into the chamber with each intake revolution of the crankshaft.   All that said, I'm sure the engineers considered all these trade offs and felt the increase in velocity outweighed that of the hotter air in their particular design."

WWIIplanes,39oqmi,onnoj817,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"All that ducting ended up working in its favor. As the P-51 took over escort duty, the P-47 was switched to ground attack where all that metal did a great job of protecting the pilot from ground fire."
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,Zebba_Odirnapal,6,Sat Jun 13 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"i feel like using intercooler piping as armor is a really bad idea though. a hole in one of those pipes would be a huge boost/vaccum leak and cause all sorts of issues with the performance on the engine.  but i guess in a ground attack role, they might not be facing as much firepower that can punch through."
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,Merad,6,Sat Jun 13 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"A 20mm hole in a duct that size will only leak so much air. At worst, you'll lose boost and end up with a naturally aspirated engine. Still good enough to limp home."
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,Zebba_Odirnapal,5,Sat Jun 13 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge the entire purpose of the turbos in these planes was to maintain intake manifold pressure at high altitudes.  So if you stayed below probably 10-15k feet, damage to the ducts wouldn't even affect your engine performance."
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,FusionCola,8,Sat Jun 13 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"These weren't turbo-normalized engines like today's GA planes. They made 30 pounds of boost on the deck and made monstrous power from it.  Still, an all-motor R-2800 is enough to get you home."
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,Zebba_Odirnapal,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:26:19 2015 UTC,You're correct.  This works exactly like an automotive turbo.  Here is a rear mounted turbo on a Firebird.
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,diesel_stinks_,7,Sat Jun 13 13:18:05 2015 UTC,"Some German V-12's also did a sort of trick like this by mounting their superchargers sideways behind the engine block. Instead of a shaft drive, they were hydraulically driven, allowing the blower to be rotated 90 degrees and tucked in behind the motor on the intake side.  The hydrostatic drive eliminated the need for a multi-speed gear driven power takeoff for the blower. It also freed up room for those famous motorkanone firing between the banks of the V-12 and out the propeller hub. Motor cannons weren't feasible on Rolls-Royce and Allison engines because their superchargers were smack dab in the middle behind the block."
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,Zebba_Odirnapal,3,Sat Jun 13 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"There were shafts and gears (bevel gears in this case) driving the supercharger, they just used what was basically a variable torque converter to vary the amount of power that was sent to the supercharger.  See here."
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,Xeonith,2,Sat Jun 13 23:52:26 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks!
WWIIplanes,39oqmi,JohnPombrio,5,Sun Jun 14 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yup! The reason is there isn't any room in the engine bay to put that massive turbo, so the rear-mount setup makes it possible, and also aids in cooling. The ducting isn't long enough to cause changes in manifold pressure, so boost is still constant. This remote-mount setup in also seen in some modified Chevy Corvettes for the same reasons."

WWIIplanes,39ldmw,forumwhore,3,Sat Jun 13 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"The XB-29 prototype and the YB-29 evaluation models had an olive drab paint scheme. The production models kept their bare metal finish.   That was due to developments in the different theatres of war: for example, the bombers of the Eight Air Force in Europe quit the use of camouflage paint around mid-1944, as it weighed the aircraft down and served no real purpose for high-altitude daylight bombers."

WWIIplanes,39ia7q,skipperbob,2,Thu Jun 11 22:18:51 2015 UTC,The D-Day markings were actually used prior to D-Day. I know the RAF Typhoons began using the stripes since they kept receiving friendly fire as they were frequently mistaken for FW-190s.
WWIIplanes,39ia7q,Aimnlo,3,Fri Jun 12 00:14:38 2015 UTC,No they were not. The markings on the Typhoon were used as you mentioned but if you look you will see they are different and only on the wing.

WWIIplanes,39gtgd,RyanSmith,10,Thu Jun 11 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"Story Time:  My Grandfather was a B-17 Bombardier. He was assigned to the 25th Bomb Group, which covered various kinds of reconnaissance missions. His squadron (the 652nd) did weather recon over the Atlantic - long flights from England down to the Azores and back that helped them predict weather conditions over the continent. Another squadron in the 25th BG (the 653rd) was equipped with Mosquitoes and did target recon over Germany.  My Grandfather always claimed the Mossies were the most beautiful airplanes in the sky.  They flew so high and fast that there was rarely any danger, even over occupied Europe. My Grandad would become quite animated and describe in great detail how a flight of 4 would come over the runway and one-by-one peel off in a graceful maneuver to line up for approach. He and a friend used to go out and watch the missions come in all the time. They were getting bored doing weather recon and had put in for a transfer to the mosquito squadron.  Well one-day they were awaiting the return of the Mosquitoes... which were uncharacteristically late. Eventually, one came streaking in - low and smoking. A few minutes later came another one, also damaged. It turns out they had encountered the Me 262 for the first time that day, which had no problem matching them for speed and altitude. My grandfather withdrew his transfer request that day.  He's been gone for 20 years now. He didn't talk that much about his wartime experience, but I'll never forget how his face lit up every time he saw a picture of a Mosquito. This reminds me of him. Thanks for posting it."

WWIIplanes,39f3tw,filipv,5,Thu Jun 11 08:22:39 2015 UTC,"I tend to side with OP here. If you zoom in on the aircraft in question you can clearly make out the left main gear stowed in its ""up"" position in the side of the engine cowl. You can also see the divide between dark and light blue paint. Here is an example of an F4F from a similar angle.  Edit: Here is a side by side comparison of both images"
WWIIplanes,39f3tw,jbob88,4,Thu Jun 11 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"It seems very much like an US aircraft than an Japanese instead. The wheel is the thing that gives it the most away but also look at the colors.  Lower part is lighter than the upper part, most F4F's were dark blue on top and white down below. So it seems very likely to be an F4F."
WWIIplanes,39f3tw,Ma3rabi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"It's a Japanese kamikaze aircraft, fairly famous photo at that.  Not sure the exact source at the moment, but I'm pretty sure its a D4Y ""Judy"".             But no, it is most definitely not an F4F.  Unless you think F4F's were used by the Americans in kamikaze attacks on Japanese naval assets... then sure, world's your oyster."

It's fame as a Kamikaze attack is only as accurate as that label. All the photo shows is a plane on fire, not its mission.   If US planes were operating in the same area then it is possible that it has been misidentified."
WWIIplanes,39f3tw,fishbedc,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"The only reason an F4F hypothesis could exist is the black circle under the wing looks like the wheel for the landing gear, but is most likely just the flames creating that visual image.        Now, if we were to assume this was a friendly-fire incident, that seems even more unlikely considering the different shape between Japanese and US aircraft, colour of applied camouflage and patterns, and the national markings.          This higher-res photo shows that there clearly are no wheels where an F4F's would be. http://www.navalhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Okinawa002.jpg"

It does look quite different from the low-wing N1K2-J. The N1K2-K on that picture is the two-seat trainer version, by the way.   Only four days after the Shiden‍ '​s first test flight, a complete redesign was begun, the N1K2-J. The new design addressed the N1K1-J's major defects, primarily the mid-mounted wing and long landing gear.   The wings were moved to a low position, which permitted the use of shorter, conventional undercarriage, the fuselage was lengthened, the tail redesigned, and the whole aircraft was made much simpler to produce (...)."

WWIIplanes,38gmjj,Zebba_Odirnapal,6,Thu Jun 4 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"Focke-Wulf test pilot Hans Sander said of the Fw 187 Falke,    [it] was the first prototype that I test flew after joining Focke-Wulf as a test pilot. It was really quite a fast airplane, faster than the Bf 110 and the Heinkel 112 with Jumo 210D's. On its first flight the Falke reached 525 km/h at low altitude--225 km/h faster than the current frontline fighters. It was even 35 km/h faster than the Bf 109 using the same engine and at the same altitude. Furthermore, it had a much longer range and higher useful load, meaning that I could have set a whole series of world records with the plane (something the higher-ups didn't want to see happen.)  With its armament of four MG17's and two MG/FF, that plane was the aircraft our Luftwaffe later lacked when the war broke out. For the pilots, it offered excellent all-round visibility on takeoff, landing and during flight. Thanks to a large window in the fuselage floor it even offered good downward visibility. The rudder forces were quite acceptable with adequate stability, even if the effectiveness was not up to the perfection achieved with the later Fw 190. The airplane could be flown on one engine virtually ""hands off."" There was no problem banking the plane over the running engine, and with care, the same could be done over the standing engine. A bit of cross-trimming lightened single-engine flight and countered the side slip and pull of the running engine.  The twin-engined, single seat Fw 187 with its long range and load capability was actually the prototype for our fighters of today. It's common that most current single seat jet fighters have two engines."
WWIIplanes,38gmjj,Sinandomeng,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:23:58 2015 UTC,So wonder why it didn't go into production? Or did it?
WWIIplanes,38gmjj,Kruse,3,Thu Jun 4 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"Politics, shortsightedness...from wiki: [T]he Reich Air Ministry (RLM) rejected the design on the grounds that the single-engine Bf 109 had comparable performance but would cost roughly half as much. The need for a long-range design was not considered serious, as at the time it was believed bomber escort was simply not needed."
WWIIplanes,38gmjj,Happycamper101,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"Although the Fw 187 showed good performance, the RLM refused it. Their reasoning was that it was almost twice as heavy as a Bf 109 and used twice as many engines. Plus (they reasoned) the wing loading was huger than the average pilot could handle.  Kurt Tank countered the refusal by demonstrating that only the cost of the engines would be greater. The other aircraft components cost the same as a Bf 109 to build and to maintain. He claimed that in an offensive war where fighers would have to range far from home, a larger plane with long range and heavy load carrying capabilities was preferable.  The Technisches Amt even flat-out refused to believe the Fw 187's performance specs. F-W chief test pilot arranged for ultra-precise pitot tubes and data logging equipment to be fitted to the Fw 187, then flew it before Richthofen and Udet of the Technisches Amt in a new series of carefully controlled tests. Udet then scoffed at the 187's stellar specs, claiming that maneuverability was more importan than speed for a fighter.  Focke Wulf fought for and won a small contract to produce three two-seater Fw 187 prototypes, but ultimately the RLM decided to go wth the Bf 110 for their heavy two-seat fighter.  Versus the Messeraschmitt Bf 110B, here are the Fw 187's specs:  Engines: 2x Jumo 210G, 2x700PS (same for both planes).  Empty weight: 3700kg FW, 4440kg Messershmitt.    Max. load: 1300kg FW, 1261kg Messerschmitt.    Wing loading: 164 kg/qm FW, 148 kg/qm Messerschmitt.    Climb rate: 14.5 m/s FW, 12.5 m/s Messershmitt.   Top speed @ 4000m: 500km/h FW, 455 km/h Messerschmitt.    Range: 900km FW, 635km Messerschmitt.  Takeoff run: 154m FW, 440m Messerschmitt."

After the RLM rejected the single seat version, Focke-Wulf made a couple two seater Fw 187's to compete more directly with the Bf 110. It saw a little combat in Norway early in the war with positive comments from the flight crews, but it never went into full production."

WWIIplanes,38eseq,Zebba_Odirnapal,6,Wed Jun 3 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"From Wolfgang Wagner's book ""The History of German Aviation, Kurt Tank: Focke-Wulf's Designer and Test Pilot"":   A line of Jabo-Rei increased range [Fw 190] fighter bombers, designated the G-series, were produced parallel to the F [ground attack] series. These long-range aircraft were an attempt to fulfill the wishes of the field units and reduce - at least on the return journey - the high dropoff in performance incurred by underwing and underfuselage fittings. The aircraft were fitted with drop tanks attached to streamlined braces which dropped away when the tanks were released.  The Fw 190G-3 long-range fighter-bomber, production of which began in late summer 1943, was a follow-on development of the Fw 190 A-5/U13. The airplane was fitted with two MG151's and a PKS11 autopilot. The wings were carried over from the Fw 190A-6.  The G-3 was equipped with racks for two 300-liter drop tanks and for ordnance ranging up to one 1000-kg bomb or two 250-kg bombs. With this load, the aircraft was capable of ranges of 1550 km and an endurance of up to three hours at maximum idle cruise setting. Undercarriage and tires were beefed up yet again. G-series planes occasionally carried bombs weighing up to 1800 kg (overload configuration) for strikes against bridges. This was probably the greatest bomb load ever lifted into the air by a single-engined aircraft during the war. These planes needed a takeoff run of 1200 meters or more in order to get airborne.   It is always difficult to include range data in tables, as in reality these fluctuate based on the military situation at the time. The RLM often computed ranges based on a brief period of high fuel consumption during takeoff and climb, with the remainder of the flight conducted at idle cruise. Compared with takeoff fuel consumption, cruise settings lowered fuel consumption by up to 50 percent. Bomber pilots were naturally keen to reach their target as quickly as possible and return home just as quickly, while ground attack planes attempted to fly as low as feasible. Such conditions left little time for flying at economical cruise settings. As a result, ranges calculated for idle cruise showing 1500+ km ranges or endurance times of four or five hours can be reduced by 50 percent across the the board in practice."

In other words, he got shot at for a living, in a very brutal theatre.

WWIIplanes,38dzjd,Fulcro,3,Thu Jun 4 02:05:41 2015 UTC,"Many years ago when I was a kid, my dad took me to some kind of military equipment show thingy.  Basically, it was just a bunch of random military equipment, from helmets and uniforms, rifles to cannons, jeeps to tanks, and everything in between spanning from WWI to the present day (I want to say maybe 1990 or 1991 in this case).    There was an indoor section that held mostly the smaller stuff, which included a little area for modelers to show their work.  The crown jewel of the model displays was without an astonishing scratch built, large scale Spitfire model.  I don't remember the exact scale, but if I had to guess I'd say somewhere around 1:16th scale.  This thing was gorgeous, and no amount of attention was spared to even the smallest components.  As a kid I loved building models, especially aircraft, and I've recently rekindled my interest in the hobby, and I still look back upon that model for inspiration.    Yet that didn't stop a pair of wannabe rivet counters from finding something to critique.  Now for those unfamiliar with the hobby, a rivet counters is someone obsessed with even the most minutest of details.  They'll call you out for only having 18,768 rivets,  because even every idiot knows that the B-24J Liberators made at the Willow Run plant between August 1943 and September 1943 had 18,769 rivets.  Now, I say wannabe rivet counters, because they weren't knowledgeable in the slightest in what they were talking about.  In this case, one actually said something to the effect of ""he spends all this time on it, and can't even paint a few straight black and white lines?""  Now, that might have made for a ""heh"" worthy joke, had it been said as a joke. Nope, he was serious. He even pondered whether or not something had gone wrong with the masking of the paint job.  The other offered that he's obviously got a great mechanical mind, but maybe painting wasn't his strongest suit (Nevermind the fact that everything else was also impeccably painted properly as well)."

While Martin did build Canberras, it was under licence. That particular jet bomber was designed by English Electric. The cigar fuselage, dihedral tail, etc does have a resemblance to Martin ships though.

WWIIplanes,3848hn,LackingTact19,5,Mon Jun 1 20:09:18 2015 UTC,I would also like to know this. Most later post war aircraft seemed to adopt 4 or even 5 blade props.   http://www.davidfillingham.com/Photos/AirShow/AirShowLargePics/Spitfire-5.jpg
WWIIplanes,3848hn,yelkcoh,19,Mon Jun 1 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"It depends.  First off, you haven't defined ""better.""  Many aircraft added propeller blades because later versions had more powerful engines. They could not increase propeller diameter because of clearance issues and propeller tip speed limits. So the alternative is to add more blades.  In general, more blades are less efficient. Supersonic blade tips are also inefficient.  Read this for more info: http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/propulsion/q0039.shtml"
WWIIplanes,3848hn,Zebba_Odirnapal,-7,Mon Jun 1 21:24:42 2015 UTC,More blades aren't less efficient. Why do you think the latest c-130's have 8-blade propellers?
WWIIplanes,3848hn,foshizzler,15,Tue Jun 2 00:27:11 2015 UTC,"They are less efficient. Every blade is going through the turbulent air of the blade before it, and getting less bite than it would in clean air. The ideal prop wold have a single blade with a counterbalance opposite. It was tried on some racing planes, but was just not enough advantage to overcome the simplicity of a 2 blade prop.   The reason they don't use 2 or 4 blades on the C-130 is because blades that could properly utilize the engine's horsepower would be too large for ground clearance."
WWIIplanes,3848hn,Gunslinger_Rex,3,Tue Jun 2 02:19:49 2015 UTC,"Every blade is going through the turbulent air of the blade before it, and getting less bite than it would in clean air.    I don't intend to contradict, just asking here: when the aircraft flies sufficiently fast, I thought that by the time the blade reaches the position that the precedent blade had, the aircraft already moved forward enough to reach ""clean"" air?

WWIIplanes,3848hn,another_user_name,3,Tue Jun 2 12:19:10 2015 UTC,"More blades are less efficient than increasing the propeller diameter. Long span, small chord airfoils (aka high aspect ratio) are more efficient than short, thick chord ones (for the same area). The longer the span, the less induced drag you produce for the same amount of lift (or thrust in the case of a prop).   And that's up to the point where you either run out of clearance or start to get significant wave drag because the tips of propellers are going transonic.  When you hit those points, you start to add more props."

WWIIplanes,3848hn,AmericanSince1639,5,Tue Jun 2 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"That depends on the Mark. Early Mk. Is used a two-bladed, fixed pitch propeller. Later Mk. Is introduced a three-bladed, variable pitch propeller. Different models, made by different manufacturers (of propellers) were used up until the Mk. V.   The Mk. VI introduced a four-bladed propeller, because it was used at high altitude and the thinner air required it, but it still used a RR Merlin with a single-stage supercharger.  Four-bladed propellers were also used in the later Merlin-powered variants, starting with the Mk. VII. Those aircraft were fitted with RR Merlins with two-stage, two-speed superchargers, which were far more powerful than the previous Merlin models.  The Griffon-powered Marks of the Spitfire used a five-bladed propeller in the production models. The prototype Spitfire Mk. IV, although powered by the Griffon, was fitted with a four-bladed propeller. One prototype Mk. XIV used the six-bladed contra-rotating propeller later used on the Seafire 46 and 47, for testing purposes."

WWIIplanes,3848hn,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"This is all true however aerodynamically that larger prop is going to be more efficient at higher RPMs and speeds simply because it's taking a bigger bite out of the air than a smaller one, or one with less blades. It's why most modern prop planes have five and six blades. The trade off between the additional drag and weight of the larger prop is easily offset by the additional thrust generated."
WWIIplanes,3848hn,billyjoedupree,3,Tue Jun 2 03:04:36 2015 UTC,"... however aerodynamically that larger prop is going to be more efficient at higher RPMs...   Unless the tips start going supersonic. That's one of the main reasons for adding blades, to keep tip speeds subsonic by adding blades instead of increasing the diameter of the prop. That doesn't mean that more blades are entirely better, just that they're more practical. There are always trade-offs in engineering."

Based on the P-51 Mustang, the F-82 was originally designed as a long-range escort fighter in World War II; however, the war ended well before the first production units were operational.  In the postwar era, Strategic Air Command used the planes as a long-range escort fighter. Radar-equipped F-82s were used extensively by the Air Defense Command as replacements for the Northrop P-61 Black Widow as all-weather day/night interceptors. During the Korean War, Japan-based F-82s were among the first USAF aircraft to operate over Korea. The first three North Korean aircraft destroyed by U.S. forces were shot down by F-82s, the first being a North-Korean Yak-11 downed over Gimpo Airfield by the USAF 68th Fighter Squadron.

The Spitfire Mk.IX used the same engine (Rolls-Royce Merlin 66) as the P-51D (Packard V-1650-7, a licence-built version), but the performance of the P-51D was better at almost all altitudes.  However, you should keep in mind that the Spitfire's original design dates from 1934, and the P-51 from 1940.

WWIIplanes,380y2x,Elbie79,2,Mon Jun 1 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"The aircraft was a Halifax B Mk.II of No. 6 Group, 405 Squadron (Royal Canadian Air Force). Its identification number was W7708, LQ-H, ""H for Harry"". The aircraft was shot down by a night fighter over the Netherlands on the 9th of June, 1942, during a ""1000 bomber"" raid on the Cologne-Essen-Krefeld area.   The crew survived and became POWs in Stalag Luft III, except for the pilot, Flight Lieutenant J.A. McLean, who evaded capture. He later wrote a book about his experiences: ""Making it Home"". P/O J. C. Wernham escaped Stalag Luft III in 1944, but was recaptured and later murdered by the Gestapo. He was buried in Posen (now Poznan, Poland). The remaining crew members were repatriated to Canada after the war.  Source 1: a Dutch website with OP's photo in colour and the squadron details of No. 6 Group in a list. Scroll down to just below half way. In 1945, 405 Sqn (RCAF) was based in Beaulieu near Southampton, but in 1942 it operated from RAF Pocklington, roughly located between Hull and York.

WWIIplanes,37v77r,autowikibot,2,Sat May 30 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"Hawker Typhoon:       The Hawker Typhoon (Tiffy in RAF slang), was a British single-seat fighter-bomber, produced by Hawker Aircraft. It was intended to be a medium–high altitude interceptor, as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement.   The Typhoon was designed to mount 12 machine guns and be powered by the latest 2000 hp engines. Its service introduction in mid-1941 was plagued with problems and for several months the aircraft faced a doubtful future.  When the Luftwaffe brought the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190 into service in 1941, the Typhoon was the only RAF fighter capable of catching it at low altitudes; as a result it secured a new role as a low-altitude interceptor.   Through the support of pilots such as Roland Beamont it became established in roles such as night-time intruder and long-range fighter.  From late 1942 the Typhoon was equipped with bombs and from late 1943 RP-3 ground attack rockets were added to its armoury. Using these two weapons, the Typhoon became one of the Second World War's most successful ground-attack aircraft.

It was the Royal Air Force's first single-seat, twin-engined, cannon-armed fighter, and a contemporary of the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane. It was one of the fastest aircraft in service when it flew in the late 1930s, and was much more heavily armed than any other. However, protracted development problems with its Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines delayed the entire project and only a relatively small number were ever built. During the Second World War only two RAF squadrons were equipped with the Whirlwind, and despite successful use as a fighter-bomber it was withdrawn from service in 1943.

WWIIplanes,37v7wt,TheGamesDoc,5,Sun May 31 06:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that could be anything. We need someone to drag all the parts out of the water, and play puzzle with it. That's just a pile of scrap, if it wasn't for the engine in the beginning, I wouldn't even know that that is supposed to be a plane.  We need the shape of the airframe, armament (if it has any), type of engine, etc.  Honestly, unless you find some plates in the wreckage I don't think anyone is going to be able to identify that plane. The plate at the beginning might be a good start, but I'd search for serial numbers or something like that on the engine."
WWIIplanes,37v7wt,Schweehog,8,Sat May 30 23:25:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless you find some plates in the wreckage I don't think anyone is going to be able to identify that plane.    It's a spitfire. See this image of a spitfire cockpit, and take a look at the landing gear lever. It's the same as the one in the video."
WWIIplanes,37v7wt,TheGamesDoc,2,Sat May 30 23:41:52 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, you're right.  Only problem is that there are so many versions of the Spitfire. Don't know how accurate the identification has to be."
WWIIplanes,37v7wt,Schweehog,6,Sat May 30 23:47:25 2015 UTC,Well this is a guess but the Greek squadron No 335 started operations over Albania and Yugoslavia in September of 1944 which matches the place where this one was found. This squadron operated Spitfire Mk Vb(s) and Mk Vc(s). Based on the fact that most spitfires in the Mediterranean were either Mk Vb/c(s) or Mk VIIIs it would be a good guess to say it is one of these types. I can guarantee it isn't a Mk I because those had a different type of landing gear selector pictured here.  Source on the Greek spitfire squadron.  Source on where Mk VIII(s) operated.
WWIIplanes,37v7wt,RiotBadger,1 point,Sun May 31 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"u/Schweehog is correct, this is most probably a spitfire looking at the u/c lever. Also it's a pretty early example going by the 10J/7 1A controller. I'd need more data to go on to give you a better idea of mk."
WWIIplanes,37v7wt,rtwpsom2,3,Sun May 31 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"It's most likely British, US manufacturers rarely used Type 1A style of rev control. And US aircraft would label the landing gear as such and not as a chassis."

First used in combat by the British in Europe, the Wildcat was the only effective fighter available to the United States Navy and Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater during the early part of World War II in 1941 and 1942; the disappointing Brewster Buffalo was withdrawn in favor of the Wildcat and replaced as units became available. With a top speed of 318 mph (512 km/h), the Wildcat was still outperformed by the faster 331 mph (533 km/h), more maneuverable, and longer ranged Mitsubishi A6M Zero. But the F4F's ruggedness, coupled with tactics such as the Thach Weave, resulted in an air combat kill-to-loss ratio of 5.9:1 in 1942 and 6.9:1 for the entire war.

VL Pyörremyrsky was like a Finnish Bf-109 of sorts. Mostly made from plywood (like a lot of Russian planes), using a German DB605 engine and armed with two Finnish machine guns and a cannon through the nacelle just like with 109.  Only one prototype made, which is now in a museum (where my picture is from also) as the war ended and it wasn't that much better from the 109s FAF operated...

WWIIplanes,37epkc,-CharlieFoxtrot-,1 point,Wed May 27 16:45:14 2015 UTC,They fought just as hard as every other pilot fighting in the war...they just fought for longer because they weren't rotated out of combat like other air forces did.
WWIIplanes,37epkc,Lord_Ciar,4,Wed May 27 10:15:00 2015 UTC,I know that's one of the reasons but the sheer number of kills on all these pilots is staggering. Just like the kills that Hand Ulrich Rudel had in his carreer or the tonnage of the U-boat commanders sank with limited rescources and men.  Besides the total number of aces in Germany is also higher then the total number of American Aces I believe. You could also claim that since everybody came to them it was easier but the attrition rate on pilots was atrocious.
WWIIplanes,37epkc,Dressedw1ngs,1 point,Wed May 27 11:08:01 2015 UTC,"Hartmann himself said he gained many kills from shooting down sturmoviks without rear gunners, and even when they had rear gunners they never had the aim to hit him.   He was shot down something like 14 times but that was only because he'd have to bail out after realizing a stray shot hit his engine or something equally important.   Germans had many more aces because they had been flying air combat missions since 1936 in the Spanish Civil War, many pilots never, and usually didn't want to get promoted out of flying combat.   So when an american did 30 combat missions and saw Germans say five times, a German ace would fly ten times the amount of missions and see enemies at ten times the rate.  (Not actual ratio, just comparing the relation. I'm sure there's a few ratios you can find online. Many times when Germans did face enemies they scored multiple kills because it was often large groups of bombers).   E: butthurt wehraboos down voting? I though this was ww2 planes not /r/wt"
WWIIplanes,37epkc,PenguinScotty,3,Wed May 27 12:04:46 2015 UTC,"Well, your post has a bit of a one sided feel to it, so i'm not surprised you got downvoted (not one of them, but i can see why they would).  You're taking one account from one theater of the war to start out with.  Another thing you neglected to mention was the state of the air force of the other countries at the early days in the war.  Inferior machinery as well as inferior training. There is also no mention of mid to late in the war, when the tides turned.    The statement about missions should also be looked at in multiple ways.  More missions means more opportunities to engage the enemy, but it also means more opportunity to get killed.    Also, multiple kills because bombers present an, apparently, easier target is not something i would agree with.  Especially later on with escorts.  If you'd like to get a bit more in-depth, i'd be happy to throw in some information cause i'm very interested in WW2 air combat.  Just responding in regards to why people downvoted you, though."
WWIIplanes,37epkc,Dressedw1ngs,1 point,Wed May 27 22:09:32 2015 UTC,"Even with escort German machines wreaked havoc on allied bombing formations.  When I was referring to bomber formations, I was actually referencing early British and Russian formations though.   More missions facing inferior Russian types does have a chance of being killed but you still have a high target zone that can put up little fight.   I think the highest scoring German was 150 kills without facing Russians, and the majority of his kills were P40s and Hurricanes in Africa, which I find more impressive than 200+ sturmoviks.   The skills of German pilots isn't really being questioned here, but the people who worship pilots like Hartman for shooting down 290 or so Russian aircraft annoy me.   Many factors contribute to German pilots high kill counts but it wasn't because they were super men.  Don't take me as someone who hates any side in History, I just get really frustrated with the worship of German Aviators with high kill counts.   E: I'm also very ill and make very little sense lol"
WWIIplanes,37epkc,PenguinScotty,2,Wed May 27 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what time in the war we're talking about in regards to bomber formations.    Early war was very different for germany, as said before, but things changed later on, ofcourse.  Inferior in the beginning, definitely, but they quickly pushed out some good planes and the sheer numbers can't be overlooked.   Marseille was above 150 when he was killed.  All of those were on the western front/africa. Bär had slightly above 120 in the west and 90 somethimg in the east, if i remember right and Galland had a wee bit more than 100 in the west.  There shouldn't be worship, but it still is no small feat. They definitely weren't supermen and yes, there are many factors involved, but the same holds true for allied pilots. Achieving what they did during their respective deployments is a different kind of challenge and feat.  I'm not saying you hate one side, was just pointing out what it 'sounded' like, if that makes sense.   Sorry about formatting and premature post, i hate typing on tablets..."
WWIIplanes,37epkc,-CharlieFoxtrot-,0,Thu May 28 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"Another reason was culture within the Luftwaffe. Often the younger pilots in a unit would defer to the senior pilot or commanding officer for the kill. There was a culture of almost hero worship where, often, units had a ""star"" that the other pilots would assist, instead of getting the kill themselves, even if they could have. That mentality, in general, was not the case amongst Allied pilots."

WWIIplanes,37e1de,McPhatiusJackson,2,Wed May 27 00:55:13 2015 UTC,"I came here to recommend this book. Very funny, but also very informative.  There are a lot of memoirs out there. There's one called Escape! by James Edwin Armstrong about his time as a B-17 pilot in the 8th Air Force and his escape from Nazi-occupied France after he was shot down north of Paris (the emphasis of the book is on his escape). Another memoir is An Ace of the Eighth: An American Fighter Pilot's Air War in Europe by Norman ""Bud"" Fortier. Fortier was credited with 5.83 kills and 5.5 aircraft destroyed on the ground flying the P-47 and P-51.   A really good non-memoir is Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot by Starr Smith about the famous actor's wartime service as a B-24 pilot and later a squadron and group commander. Also, there's Tail-End Charlies: The Last Battles of the Bomber War, 1944-45 by John Nichol and Tony Rennell, which is a broader history of the air war in those years but incorporates many individual stories of air crews. There are some individual stories in Donald L. Miller's Masters of the Air, but it's more of an overview of the European air war (and one of the best overall histories of the air war).   I might be able to find a few more, but those are the ones I can find on my bookshelves right now."

I'm in the car a lot, so I'm going to see if any of these are on Audible before heading to the book store.  There seems to be a lot of books that take place in the European theater, but what I'd really like is something that takes place in the Pacific theater.  I'm interested in what it must have been like to be stationed on some island in the middle of nowhere, having to dig out a landing strip, making repairs under less than ideal circumstances, etc.  I have a germ of an idea for a book I'd like to write, and though it would be in the realm of fantasy fiction, I would like some basis of reality in which to stake a few tent poles.

The US Navy had two ""freshwater aircraft carriers"" in Lake Michigan for advanced aircraft carrier training, the USS Wolverine and the USS Sable.

Though when it came to strategic bombers, the US was unmatched by war's end, the strumovik is probably the greatest CAS aircraft in history, considering it's overwhelming success and the irreplaceable role it played in breaking the wehrmacht's back. IMO, it's the greatest fighting aircraft ever built."
WWIIplanes,377lp9,Juviltoidfu,1 point,Mon May 25 17:44:25 2015 UTC,I've met British who would argue the bombers. They maintain that the Lancaster was WW2's best strategic bomber.

Having an armored bathtub around the engine and pilot, 8 50 cal machine guns, and able to carry half of the weight of bombs as a B-17, it was a fearsome  tactical close assault weapon as well as a superb fighter.

It was flown by the Luftwaffes special test unit Zirkus Rosarius - the T9 marking you can see on this aircraft is their Geschwader code. They tested British and American aircraft and tried to discover any strengths or vulnerabilities in their design or performance.   EDIT: I kept on digging and found some more very interesting info on this particular aircraft. This aircraft was nicknamed ""Ruthless Ruthie"", and operated in Lesina, Italy in 1943. HERE and HERE are pictures of the aircraft before it was captured. Interestingly, it was first serving with the 317th. Fighter Squadron, but when they upgraded to P-51 Mustangs ""Ruthless Ruthie"" was transferred to 301st. Fighter Sqadron, which was one of the four famous all black African-American squadrons. 29th of May 1944 Lloyd Hathcock became disoriented while on a mission and crash landed on an airport occupied by the Germans. They then took the P-47 for testing.  EDIT 2: HERE is Lloyd ""Scotty"" Hathcock. After he crash landed on the German airport, he was taken prisoner and spent the rest of the war in German prison camps. After the war he went back to the U.S and stayed in service, and helped desegregate the U.S. Air Force.

I remember a story, I believe it was from A Wing and a Prayer, where they had to land for maintenance on a training mission.  The crewman tasked with guarding the sight was being careless so the officers on the plane pranked him by sneaking in an hiding the sight, then asking him what had happened to it.

I just imagine being at 15,000ft over the middle of the pacific ocean on a beautiful warm day, and just for a split moment forgetting you are in a terrible war and just enjoying the flight.  Moreover it is a pilots airplane and kept many an airman alive while doling out serious damage to the Japanese fleet.

The SBD (""Scout Bomber Douglas"") was the U.S. Navy's main carrier-borne scout plane and dive bomber from mid-1940 through mid-1944. The SBD was also flown by the U.S. Marine Corps, both from land air bases and aircraft carriers. The SBD is best remembered as the bomber that delivered the fatal blows to the Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway in June 1942.[1]  During its combat service, the SBD was an excellent naval scout plane and dive bomber. It possessed long range, good handling characteristics, maneuverability, potent bomb load capacity, great diving characteristics, defensive armament and ruggedness. One land-based variant of the SBD — in omitting the arrestor hook — was purpose-built for the U.S. Army Air Forces, as the A-24 Banshee."

WWIIplanes,36ii92,RyanSmith,5,Tue May 19 17:14:36 2015 UTC,Interesting. You can see how the gun is mounted at an angle due to the thinner wing on the B/C models. Which made them more likely to jam than on the later models with the six .50s mounted normally.
WWIIplanes,36ii92,aquanaut,3,Tue May 19 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"The wings of the P-51B/C were similar to all other P-51 models in terms of thickness. It wasn't a problem to fit 20mm cannons or six .50cals in them.  The guns were mounted at an angle because that was the only way they could be installed on the same horizontal plane*, which was thought to have a positive effect on the concentration of fire on a target. That the jamming issue countered that effect didn't help much, though.  * The linked drawing shows the wings as being mounted horizontally, but of course they had a slight dihedral. The B/C model's guns would be on the same horizontal plane, contrary to what the picture shows."

Webster, MA  Harold J. Pierce BT * Oklahoma City, OK  Jack Brown, Jr. RW * Greer, SC  The original crew came together at Salt Lake City, UT, and shipped to Rapid City, SD, 29 November 1943. While at Rapid City, Lindholm and Hewitt joined the crew. The crew shipped to MacDill Field, Tampa, FL, 6 January 1944, and became part of the 483rd Bomb Group.  Orders of 9 March 1944 assigned B-17 42-38210 to the Preston crew. They flew to Italy by the southern route. Only H. C. Johnston, Lindholm and Cieslak of Prestonâ€™s regular crew flew with him. The other six men, Day, Rozycki, Pecotte, J. W. Johnston, Sacks and Mauldin, a charter member of the 18th Observation Squadron, were key ground personnel. B-17 42-38210 was assigned to the 99th Bomb Group as soon as they arrived in Italy. The plane was MIA 12 April 1944.  Gresham, Cooper, Cline, Brown, Toutant, and Pierce went overseas with the convoy. Fowler, Hewitt and Isaacs did not go overseas with the 483rd. Brown was originally part of the Phillips crew, and Toutant was a member of the Promberger crew at Rapid City. Records suggest Pierce joined the 483rd at MacDill. Those listed as KIA were all flying with Preston in B-17 42-5786 on a mission to Nis, Yugoslavia, 15 April 1944.  The plane received a direct flak hit, was engulfed in flames and the right wing came off. An alert 483rd photographer captured this moment, providing one of the most horrific photos of World War II.  B-17 42-5786 was a war-weary that had served with the 99th Bomb Group. This was the first crew and plane lost in combat by the 483rd. Documents confirming Toutantâ€™s death have yet to be located. No parachutes were observed, but only nine bodies were recovered from the plane. Members of the 840th Squadron who were  consulted indicated there were no survivors.  From Heroes of the 483rd (Grimm)  42-5786               Whizzer II 840th Bombardment Squadron Originally assigned to 99th Bombardment Group 5 May 43.  Lost due to fire 16 September 43.

This is a Ta 152 V7 (Ta 152 C-0/R11) werknummer 110007.  Civil registration CI+XM.  First flight 8 January 1945, pilot Märschel.  Power plant: Daimler Benz DB 603 serial number 0130 0147, originally used to power Ta 152 B1 V20.  Test goals: general function checks, hydraulic system tests, horizontal speed at combat and emergency power, climbing tests at combat power.  Remarks: wing area 19.5 m2. MW50 system installed. Integral engine cowling, heated cockpit canopy, wooden landing flaps, C tail with 500mm fuselage extension. Ballast 9.2kg. The V7 was ready to fly on 5 January 1945. Ferried from Adelheide to Langenhangen by pilot Märschel on 16 January. Hans Sander test flew the V7 at Langenhangen on 27 January, 3 February and 6 February. Conversion from DB 603 EC to DB 603 LA did not take place at Langenhangen until March 1945.  The planned Ta 152 B fighter-bomber, powered by a Jumo 213 E, did not come to fruition. Therefore an alternate version Ta 152 C was to be built with DB 603 L power, without an intercooler but with MW50 injection.   Compared to standard FW 190 A-8, the forward fuselage was lengthened 772mm and could fit MG 151 cannon in the upper cowling as well as an MK103 or MK108 motor-cannon. For simplicity, the forward fuselage extension simply bolted onto the existing A-model attachment points.  Electric landing gear and flaps were replaced with hydraulically powered units. Main gear wheels were enlarged to 740mm x 210mm to accommodate heavier weights.  Main gear were moved outboard by 250mm to provide propeller clearance for the larger wheels. This widening was done by adding a new center 0.5m spar section. The wing-fuselage joint area was redesigned slightly and used thicker wing skinning.  The rear fuselage was lengthened by 0.5m. The vertical fin was enlarged to 1.77 m2.   The forward fuel tank was identical to that of the Fw 190 A-8, but moved forward slightly to accommodate the modified wing. The rear fuel tank was enlarged to 362 liter capacity. C-0 had no internal wing fuel tanks, but had a single centerline wet hardpoint.   Instruments and avionics were largely taken from the Fw 190 A-8 series, except for the new hydraulic undercarriage and landing flaps, plus systems related to the DB 603 engine. Radios included FuG 16 ZY for voice, FuG 25a IFF set, FuG 125 radio guidance set, and an LGW K 23 automatic pilot. It was considered an all-weather fighter-bomber.  Armament was two MG 151 in the fuselage and a second pair of MG 151 in the wing roots. No motor cannon fitted due to prototype engine. Trial fitments were made on this aircraft in March 1945 for a torpedo on the centerline hardpoint.  General power plant info: Initial production Ta 152 C's were to be powered by the DB 603 E, however the DB 603 LA, which had a considerable better high-altitude performance, was planned for the Ta 152 C-1 and C-3. Methanol-water injection was used to deal with the increased temperature of the heated air produced by the supercharger. MW50 consumption was 90 liters per hour at climb and combat power, and 190 liters per hour at takeoff and emergency power. For thermal reasons, takeoff and emergency power could only be used for three periods of ten minutes each.  DB 603 E data at sea level... Start-und Notleistung: 1750PS @ 2700 U/min, 565 l/h. Steig-und Kampfleistung: 1580PS @ 2500 U/min, 480 l/h."

WWIIplanes,35n0g9,FiveDigits,3,Tue May 12 07:49:48 2015 UTC,"You could actually be right. The Hs 126 was a STOL-capable reconnaissance and observation aircraft. It has a distinct nose-high stance when it's on the ground, as can be seen in this picture and the aircraft on the photo looks quite similar.   Perhaps the crew landed on an abandoned Soviet airfield and took a series of photos to assess the damage of the Luftwaffe's air attacks."
WWIIplanes,35n0g9,Elbie79,2,Tue May 12 11:02:36 2015 UTC,yeah that seems like the most plausible scenario although I suppose it could have been captured by the Soviets and used to observe the Nazi front lines clandestinely.

Friendly fire ID is not unique to the D-day either.  German aircraft on the eastern front almost universally wore yellow flashes on their lower noses and wingtips. Some British night fighters had harlequin undersides, with one wing white and the other black. The idea for all was similar: so that friendlies wouldn't shoot 'em."

The names usually had some sort of American theme - Douglas Boston (A-20 Havoc), Douglas Dakota (C-47 Skytrain), Martin Maryland and Baltimore (neither saw US service). The B-17, however, kept its name as the Boeing Fortress Mk.1. ""Mustang"" was a British name originally, which was adopted by the USAAF because, let's face it, it sounds cool, and ""Dakota"" was also widely, though never officially, used for the C-47 and DC-3 in civilian life."

For example, the Me. 163 and the DH. 108 were very similar. The Me.262 was nicknamed ""Schwalbe"" meaning ""Swallow"" and this was another name for the DH. 108, too.  Also, things like birds and flying insects were obvious choices for aircraft; their role determined their layout, and both the role and layout of the aircraft were determining factors in the name. It isn't, therefore, too surprising that both sides had similar names inspired by nature."

WWIIplanes,34ook2,michaelconfoy,2,Sun May 3 03:03:08 2015 UTC,Great shot of an interesting and rare plane - shows how difficult conditions on the Eastern Front were for both sides too.  Often fires had to be lit under engines (aircraft and ground vehicles) to unfreeze the lubricants.  It must have been brutal for mechanics who couldn't wear gloves to tinker with small parts.
WWIIplanes,34ook2,StabbiRabbi,1 point,Sun May 3 04:12:20 2015 UTC,The Soviets used lubricants that froze at a much lower temperature than the Germans and rarely had that problem.
WWIIplanes,34ook2,StabbiRabbi,3,Sun May 3 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"I believe their metallurgy was different too, which also helped them in sub-zero conditions. They certainly didn't have as many problems as the Germans, but they did still have issues I believe.  The glove problem obviously applied to both sides for example!"
WWIIplanes,34ook2,Dressedw1ngs,2,Sun May 3 04:23:42 2015 UTC,Russians also heated their oil over a fire before putting it in their planes. Russians are just a whole lot better at dealing with the cold.
