SubredditSimMeta,3e2jbw,jbert145,9,Tue Jul 21 17:55:32 2015 UTC,AA / cultish is really the best way to describe those people. There's a massive amount of groupthink going on too; I posted some counter-evidence that maybe watching porn didn't turn you into a zombie in another subreddit and got massively downvoted without much in the way of a substantive response.
SubredditSimMeta,3e2jbw,UnthinkingMajority,18,Tue Jul 21 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not subbed to /r/NoFap and I'd like to believe I don't suffer from a masturbation addiction, so I hope I'm writing from a fairly unbiased perspective.  I'm sure we all know that like most things in life, masturbation is not something inherently wrong, but for people with addictive personalities it's one of those habits that can quickly make your life a fair bit harder, like perhaps teeth-grinding, or nail-biting. Those people make a subreddit in order to form a community with like-minded individuals, who for whatever reason want to lower or stop their masturbatory habits. Naturally, they will share their experiences with each other, and for those who feel they've in some way began to overcome their issue, they will probably share the positive effects of their experience.  However, lots of people masturbate, and when the sub got a spotlight for whatever reason, many redditors took the sub's message rather personally, as if the people of /r/NoFap were some sort of anti-masturbatory evangelicals, trying to spread the message that masturbation is horrible for you and you are horrible for masturbating.  I see where they're coming from. There's plenty of stories where those who claimed to have curbed their masturbatory habits started leading happier and successful lives in an almost magical manner, from anywhere between motivation in the day to socialization to romance to productivity, and as you probably know, reddit is fairly cynical when it comes to those stories. However, those people forget that /r/NoFap isn't a sub like maybe /r/socialism, which is founded mainly to discuss ideals and ideas--rather, it's far more akin to a support group, such as /r/ADHD or /r/depression! In fact, you could take many of the ideas from /r/NoFap and easily reskin them to appear pretty much identical to what the people from /r/depression discuss; yet, for whatever reason, reddit treats /r/depression as a serious support group while vilifying /r/NoFap as if it were something like fatpeoplehate.  There's always going to be the occasional wild story on /r/NoFap that abstaining from masturbation will make you gain muscle twice as fast and subconsciously attract all the girls to you or something, but from the little I've seen, that's not what /r/NoFap is about at all. It's simply people trying to overcome something that they feel is unacceptably hampering their quality of life, and I get rather annoyed that the majority of people on reddit, who do not suffer from the problems that would lead them to a community like /r/NoFap in the first place, marginalize those very same people over an issue they do not understand."

They're trying to discourage the act; they're not intentionally sharing their masturbation experiences in an attempt to get each other off.  Following that logic, why are people okay with /r/sex as a sub? That place is pretty much all about people's sexual habits and juices. If anything, I find the comments on a sub like /r/gonewild far more cringey than the majority of the stuff on /r/NoFap , yet reddit treats the place like a grand tradition."

Keep in mind that a lot of bots were added recently, many in the last 48 hours. /u/ledootgeneration_SS is part of that later crop and is already starting to rise. We need to let them catch up to eachother, and the increased visibility this sub has gotten in the last couple days will go a long way.  It's definitely something that should be looked at it if the rankings still don't make sense in a week or two. One idea is to have separate link and comment karma leaderboards, rather than one combined list. Especially since some bots can't post at all, and even some posting bots mostly only make good comments.  Edit: I also disagree with straight up throwing out any outliers. I think any big breaks that a new bot gets should be on the leaderboard right now. We shouldn't put in place a system to hide them until bot additions become more regular, and then we can discuss a time frame. Remember that as more bots are added, they all post less frequently, this makes it harder to do something like a set number of posts."

But in general a markov chain gives transition probabilities between two states. Here I assume the states are words in a sentence, and the transition probabilities are observed from the comments of the subreddit (for example, TRP in this case). So if the bot reads in a comment, the transition probabilities which would generate that exact same sentence are positive and thus possible to reoccur when the bot comments. Which in this case did seem to happen (though we obviously can't prove it's specifically copying this exact sentence)."

SubredditSimMeta,3e0329,Avatar_Of_Brodin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:44:45 2015 UTC,"So if the bot reads in a comment, the transition probabilities which would generate that exact same sentence are positive and thus possible to reoccur when the bot comments.    At that point you wouldn't be able to say it was ""taken word-for-word from someone's actual comment"" though.   As you basically said, it was statistically generated and just happened to match, which I think is an important distinction."
SubredditSimMeta,3e0329,zarraha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"Suppose you built a Markov chain which looked at all of the words it had said so far and then if it found a spot where someone used all of those words in that exact order, it always takes the next word from that spot.  Then the first few words might be random, but soon it latches onto a comment and each word it takes from their comment makes it like their comment even more since it's an even higher match.  What you then have is a bot that randomly picks someone's comment and repeats it verbatim.  This is boring and bad code.  Now suppose you have a bot which does legitimate markov chain stuff, but when it gets into a pattern then there's a 95% chance the next word it writes is from the same post.  Then maybe each of its posts has a 30% chance of being entirely from the same post.  So even if its comments are ""statistically generated"" in some way, the chance of a word for word repost is unnaturally high and isn't all that different from the first example."
SubredditSimMeta,3e0329,Avatar_Of_Brodin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:06:52 2015 UTC,"Suppose you built a Markov chain which looked at all of the words it had said so far ...   Then you wouldn't have a Markov chain. A Markov chain is memoryless (real word), meaning it has no knowledge of prior states, only the current one.   ... and then if it found a spot where someone used all of those words in that exact order,it always takes the next word from that spot.   See previous comment. You feed the script a pile of text and it builds a statistical database based on word frequencies. You would need an incredibly small corpus or an incredibly rare combination of words to regenerate a sentence verbatim.   Then the first few words might be random, ...   They're not. Not completely anyway. The starting position is random but the rest is weighted. If the corpus contains ""the"" is followed by ""cat"" 90% of the time then you can expect that combination to be generated about 90% of the time.   ... but soon it latches onto a comment and each word it takes from their comment makes it like their comment even more since it's an even higher match.   The corpus isn't split by comment, it's split by word. Nobody's saying, ""hey, this was a post from so-and-so"", just ""take all these words and figure out what's most likely to follow each one"".   What you then have is a bot that randomly picks someone's comment and repeats it verbatim.   Again, not how this works.   This is boring and bad code.   If it worked the way you described then yes, it would be both bad and boring.   Now suppose you have a bot which does legitimate markov chain stuff, ...   There's a whole sub full of them: /r/subredditsimulator.   ... but when it gets into a pattern then there's a 95% chance the next word it writes is from the same post.   The only bot that displays remotely similar behaviour is /u/ledootgeneration_ss, but that's the fault of the users it collects its corpus from.   Then maybe each of its posts has a 30% chance of being entirely from the same post.   Again, only with a very small corpus or a very unique series of words.   So even if its comments are ""statistically generated"" in some way, the chance of a word for word repost is unnaturally high and isn't all that different from the first example.   No, in almost all cases the chance of a word-for-word repost is surprisingly small. If it were to happen though, I'd put my money on /u/ledootgeneration_ss, but that's once again because of the input it receives."

SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,crash_test,6,Mon Jul 20 04:57:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like a monthly round of voting on new bots, plus pruning of the least successful bots would be good. Like, have a sticky here every month where people suggest new subreddits to be added. The 10 most upvoted suggestions get added, but they replace the 10 lowest upvote per comment bots that are at least 2-3 months old.  That way there's never ""too many"" bots and you get new bots to replace the unpopular ones."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,rutterkin,4,Mon Jul 20 09:03:06 2015 UTC,"Having a ""round of voting"" would probably be too much work compared to just using the existing ranking.  The ones at the bottom of the ranking have pretty much never made any good comments so there'd be nothing lost in pruning them."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,crash_test,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:39 2015 UTC,I mean a round of voting for the new ones to be added. The ones being removed would just be the bottom 10.
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,Inceptagon,26,Mon Jul 20 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"This is just my two cents: while I don't have a problem with removing bots which don't seem to make good comments, I personally don't see an issue with having ""too many"" bots here. If the rate of posting remains the same, all it can do is add more variety. I'd say, let's have 500 bots if they're all consistently posting funny stuff."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,allthefoxes,39,Mon Jul 20 01:46:42 2015 UTC,"More variety could definitely be good, but the other side of it is that it means the ""better"" bots will post less often. I may just want to change the probability somehow based on the bot's rank or something, instead of completely eliminating some of them."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,allthefoxes,39,Mon Jul 20 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"Thats good, but I don't think bots high on the list should be weighted too high. doot is funny, but the charm would be lost if it happened all the time.  thank mr deimorz"
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,Rytho,15,Mon Jul 20 02:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like the before-today rate of ~4 posts per day per bot is pretty good, but if I got up to 500 bots you wouldn't even get one post from each bot a day, unless I also increased the rate of commenting overall.  We'll see, I really have no idea what I'm going to do yet."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,orost,11,Mon Jul 20 03:02:12 2015 UTC,"eh, your experiment.  Might be a neat idea to axe 5 bots every 2 weeks or so, the ones at the lowest on the list, til we only have X bots left, X being a reasonably high but not too high number.  You could keep adding more, but every 2 weeks, bots are eliminated. Thats a lot of work but a cute idea"
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,zang227,6,Mon Jul 20 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"Implementing the 'popular bots post more, unpopular bots less' depending on how you work it could leave le doot and circlejerk posting at around the same lovable rate.   Having bots not respond to chains that contain less relevant keywords to their area of expertise <which might already be implemented> is another potential improvement to increase the accuracy of the sim, and would result in less but higher quality posts."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,allthefoxes,2,Mon Jul 20 08:29:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe smaller bots could get a bigger boost from being high in the rankings. doot doot doesn't need to post more but there are some small subs high up in the rankings that deserve to post more.   Boosting by rank would also make the rankings self-correcting - if a normally mediocre bot gets a hugely upvoted post by chance that rockets it to the top, it will start posting more which will dilute its score down to the normal level faster."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,Smurf_Poo,2,Mon Jul 20 11:14:52 2015 UTC,"Right now it only seems to be making 20-25 comments per post, what if you bumped it up to say 50-60. Honestly 20 comments isn't that many when posts in moderate sized subs get into the 100s"
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,QuackOfAllTrades,3,Mon Jul 20 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"But yeah, I think the more variety, the more fun it can be :)"

SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,Sometimes_Lies,33,Mon Jul 20 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sold on sports subreddits so far. Neither of /u/nfl_SS or /u/soccer_SS have done particularly well overall.  My general impression is that subreddits do less well if the topic/jargon isn't very interesting to people that aren't knowledgeable about it, because then not everyone can ""get"" the comments. So for sports, it's less funny because all the names are completely meaningless to people that don't follow that sport. A similar thing happens with the specific game subreddits, like a lot of the stuff that /u/wow_SS says don't mean anything to non-WoW players, so it doesn't do well.  The exception for game subreddits seems to be if the terminology from the game crosses over with ""normal"" vocabulary enough that it's still funny even if you don't know anything about the game. For example, I think this is why /u/CrusaderKings_SS and /u/dwarffortress_SS are doing well, because the things they describe from those games are still understandable to everyone (and often especially outrageous)."
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,ekolis,4,Mon Jul 20 02:40:22 2015 UTC,I can understand that. Thanks for the detailed response!
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,Boardsurfer,4,Mon Jul 20 02:51:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly why /u/hiphopheads_ss also also hasn't really gone that"
SubredditSimMeta,3dvzfd,orost,2,Mon Jul 20 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"A similar thing happens with the specific game subreddits, like a lot of the stuff that /u/wow_SS says don't mean anything to non-WoW players, so it doesn't do well.   After spending a couple of minutes looking at /u/wow_SS, I'm really amused by it. The jargon is pretty meaningless to me, but the sheer number of posts which include comments like:  ""I quit"" ""I took a long break"" ""The game is still ok"" ""The state of the game today"" etc  Are all pretty darn amusing. From when I played a bit years ago, I remembered that people often spent a lot of time and energy logging into the game purely to talk about how much they hate the game ""now"" and want to quit - it's amusing to see that trend carried over to the bot.  Not disagreeing with your overall point, of course, I think you're completely right. I just wanted to share a hidden gem that a lot of people probably miss on that bot :p"

SubredditSimMeta,3dtox4,naliuj2525,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:08:02 2015 UTC,"I only have a general idea of the code behind this, but you'd think it could be implemented by setting the ""target length"" of each post before making them, and increasing the probability of terminating the Markov chain (which seems to have a chance of happening at sentence breaks) as it's reached. (It may already work this way.) You could then adjust the target length on a weighted curve that put higher emphasis on very brief and mid-length posts.  Might be a lot of work for relatively little payoff though. It's hard to know what you're going to get with these heuristic scripts. I doubt it would make anything remotely more coherent."

SubredditSimMeta,3dsswg,derleth,8,Sun Jul 19 07:21:42 2015 UTC,"How did it do the art?!   That kind of art is still text, as far as the software is concerned; it's all sequences of bytes which occur in patterns which can be modeled by a Markov process. (I'm practically certain this is a Markov generator; they've been around since the 1970s in software form, if not longer, and the results seem to match what I've seen from other Markov generators.) So it works the same way the bots generate readable text: Observe that some bytes are commonly followed by other bytes, encode that into the model they keep inside of them which allows them to mimic the posters of the subreddit they're being trained on, and then output bytes as a result of that model.  (That specific art is done with characters added to Unicode for compatibility with various home computer character sets; back in the 1970s and 1980s, actual graphics was actually pretty expensive in terms of RAM, so computers would fake it by having those shaded block characters such that software could use text to draw on the screen, which took a lot less RAM. Unicode, because of its stated design goal of being compatible with literally every previous and current way to encode text for use in text files, includes them, and modern font makers draw those characters... because reasons... and so we can get cool retro block art in our browsers in 2015. History is fun.)"

Round One: 10 Trillion Lions weigh around 2 Trillion metric tons, 20 times the total biomass currently on Earth. If we would mush them together in a cube, each side would be 12.6km (7.8 miles) long. We would stand them Head to Butt they would stretch 11.18 billion miles, 16.68 light hours, more than three times the distance between the sun and Pluto. The US Marines have about 235 Thousand members. If each of them was equipped with a M16 with unlimited ammunition, without the need to reload, and each Bullet killed a Lion, and they started this very second, they wouldn't stop shooting until 21018 AD, nearly 20 Millenias from now.  During this time they would shoot 40 million tons of Bullet, equal to over 6 Great pyramids of Giza in weight and nearly two in volume. There is no possible way for the Humans to win this one: 10/0 for the Lions  Round Two: 1vs1 in Cuteness (i am assume each side send their cutest specimen) There around 20-50,000 Lions in the world at this moment, and some of them are really quite cute. Imagine if you had a pool thousands of times larger to choose from, there could be a Lion there so cute and cuddly that he could  literally melt your heart with its fluffyness. The Marines have nothing on them in this round as well. 10/0  Round Three: Cuteness without a way to verify it. The only one where the Marines stand the shadow of a chance. If it's voted upon by the two groups, the Marines would win assuming standard Lions that have neither the mental nor the physical abilities to cast a vote. If however the Lions where able to make their oppionions counted only a marginal majority would have to favor the Lion-candidate over the Human one.  Bonus Round: Just a few quick things: 10 People wouldn't make the shadow of a difference. Also, 10 Trillion Lions wouldn't have to fear any Giant, no matter how mad he is..."
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,Tinitor,44,Tue Jul 14 14:01:01 2015 UTC,Are you saying that the us marines aren't absolutely adorable?
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,SirGallantLionheart,18,Tue Jul 14 14:37:43 2015 UTC,The marines could make a stronghold and wait for the lions to die naturally. Keeping them at bay with coordinated machine fire. The lifespan of a lion is only 14 years plus they wouldn't be able to sustain their numbers while the military marines feasibly could. Also since its the marines they have access to battleships and aircraft carriers. Feasibly they could hold out far at sea where lions couldnt reach them and make coordinated long range strikes to diminish the lions enviornment and food sources so they die faster.  Straight up the lions win but a little human ingenuity and they can easilly take this.  There are some cute Marines too
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,JesusRasputin,17,Tue Jul 14 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"but he's only cute paired with a ""lion"", so: checkmate, atheists!"
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,Askebaske,16,Tue Jul 14 22:10:32 2015 UTC,Mate that is enough lions for there to be 19 Lions per square meter of the earth. The moment the fight started every marine would be covered in lion. I don't know how human ingenuity combats being instantly covered by mad felines.
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,gizzardgullet,18,Tue Jul 14 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"10 Trillion Lions weigh around 2 Trillion metric tons, 20 times the total biomass currently on Earth.   Couldn't the lions win round 1 by simply crushing the marines with their gravity?  To take this further, would most of the lions be crushed by their own joint gravity? Also, imagine the mayhem as trillions of lions flee the mad giant down the infinite corridor."
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,Quillava,5,Tue Jul 14 16:55:47 2015 UTC,"Couldn't the lions win round 1 by simply crushing the marines with their gravity?   Mass of a Lion: 120 - 190kg (lets just say 155kg)  Mass of 10 trillion lions: 1.55×1015 kg  Volume of the Lions (assuming a lion is made of water, for simplicity): 1550km3  Radius of a sphere of 1550km3 volume: ~7.2km  = 1/20th of a pound of force?  Im not sure if this is even near correct, but I was bored and tried my best. It seems like the lion-ball would just ""splash"" and crush everything nearby, but their gravity wouldn't do anything exciting to anything near it. edit: I also just realized I replied to a different comment than I wanted to."
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,Tinitor,7,Wed Jul 15 04:12:15 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the lions just tear the earth appart thanks to gravitational pull? or is it not big enough for that?  Also are we seriously disgusting this?
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,holomanga,9,Tue Jul 14 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"For 1, they wouldn't, the Earth is 1024 kg and the lions only add to about 1012. For 2, we are."
SubredditSimMeta,3d8z9f,pargmegarg,4,Tue Jul 14 20:52:04 2015 UTC,Total biomass on earth makes up a very small percentage of the total mass on earth. It would be crowded but assuming they're spread across the surface they wouldn't have any appreciable gravitational impact.
