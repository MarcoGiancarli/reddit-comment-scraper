SouthJersey,3e68d3,inajeep,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:37:44 2015 UTC,"The value was under $200, so even if they had managed to steal it, ""theft"" in a legal sense has to be above that value. Theft of value under $200 is a disorderly persons offense. (NJSA 2C:20-2b(3))  Seems like a waste of resources to pursue this further being that the store suffered no actual loss."
SouthJersey,3e68d3,surfnsound,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:05:13 2015 UTC,Would that be in addition or in place of shoplifting?  I also don't see much in terms of resources trying to use the media to ID these miscreants.  But this is most likely Target trying to show that the take all theft seriously.
SouthJersey,3e68d3,inajeep,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:09:15 2015 UTC,"That is in place of. ""Shoplifting"" falls under the label of ""theft"" in NJ, the highest degree of which is 2nd degree felony ($75,000+ value, or various other scenarios such as theft of prescritpion narcotics). In this case, it is the lowest degree, which is just considered a disorderly persons offense, which is a misdemeanor."

But seeing how long it takes to do that way vs. finding an excavation person to come in for the wall of the pool due to all the rebar there will be. I think renting a jackhammer is something that could help me get a lot of the work done before I get heavy machinery in there. I'd get a labor guy to help me out and decrease my time sunk into it, but I'd like to avoid a construction zone in my backyard for anything more than 2 weeks and that's what it would minimum take seeing as I've got a full time job to get to during the week. Plus, a professional excavation company knows the importance of compacting the fill properly to avoid a wavy lawn, water draining right onto my foundation, and the grade that the lawn should have when it's all said and done. I know all that info now, but I may as well have machinery do it since it will already be there that day."

Though it is in North Jersey- if you ever go up that way at any point, there is a place called Corrado's and they get grapes from differing countries (i.e. Italy, Chile, etc.) and you can crush em there as well.

SouthJersey,3drilq,Qel_Hoth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:59:20 2015 UTC,Thanks It seems like a nice area. I didn't feel unsafe when I was there looking at places. in fact one of the places was one Hunter ave. turned out the apartments across the street from the house we were looking at were section 8 housing. I could not tell and the people seemed friendly.
SouthJersey,3drilq,surfnsound,3,Sat Jul 18 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"It is a nice area, but there really are two sides of town. If you check the school district on greatschools.org, you will get an idea of which areas of town are better than others. That being said, crime, while a problem, isn't terrible, but about what you would expect in any of the Southern County seats, really. Mount Holly, Mays Landing and Bridgeton are all the same way. The bigger factor, for me, would be which school your children or potential school would go to."
SouthJersey,3drilq,ItsGotToMakeSense,3,Sat Jul 18 21:56:13 2015 UTC,Woodbury is kind of a shithole but it's close to a lot of nicer areas. Check out your potential home at night (for crime and creepers) and also after the rain (for flooding caused by the clay soil). Don't expect property taxes to be very low.

SouthJersey,3drilq,DZMZR2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"Woodbury is ok depending on the area of town. Whenever I have to go there I instantly think of traffic congestion and how much time it takes to get around. I think with the exception of Broad street the entire town has a speed limit of 25mph. Unreasonably low for many areas and the police like to write tickets. Many people, including myself, have even been ticketed for jay-walking and it isn't because there are no more serious crimes going on to deal with because the town has its share of that. The courthouse is so packed every sessíon that not only is the courtroom space completely full the hallway is also with people even lined up outside on the sidewalk. A couple of suggestions by others in this thread about looking at Woodbury Heights and Deptford are solid. I'd throw Westville in there also. Good lūck."

Especially when the Philadelphia zoo isn't even on the list and I feel that zoo is far superior.  I'm guessing that the reviews are skewed in Cape mays favor since it is pay what you can.

SouthJersey,3d5wki,surfnsound,14,Mon Jul 13 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"I've worked EMS in and around Camden for a while now.  There's nothing even close to ""gentrification"" currently taking place. The hipsters live in Philly, the drug dealers live in Camden. Unless you stick around the Rutger's campus, it's worse than you think. The people there have no desire to be cured by your white guilt. You may literally die.  Not to mention, Camden is a very low income area because it needs to be. If it became ""gentrified"" the poor people living there would simply have to move somewhere else."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,Tgaboss,9,Tue Jul 14 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"That's how gentrification works, explorers move in, survive the first wave, more move in, attract some businesses, which attracts more explorers, which attracts more businesses, repeat until it's a hip place to be. The locals get pushed out, unless they own their place (which very little do); they just move to the outskirts or to somewhere else. Gentrification is great for people who can afford it, bad for the locals who can't.   Edit: I talk too much."

Unless you stick around the Rutger's campus, it's worse than you think. The people there have no desire to be cured by your white guilt. You may literally die.   I'd tend to believe you on that one.  However, it's a chicken and egg scenario. People move in to gentrify an area, crime goes down, and more people move in...however, do people have to move in first, to help the crime drop, or do people wait for the crime to drop (if it ever does) before moving in?"

SouthJersey,3d5wki,sochac,9,Tue Jul 14 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give you some serious answers:  Camden will not see large scale gentrification anytime soon, at least for a generation. The problems are the same as in any city, but to a greater degree in Camden. Education, jobs, and crime. Some of the charter schools do seem to be having an impact in the city, and that is probably the first step in turning it around. Also, as much as some people hated the idea, replacing the city's police force with a county force seems to be having some effect.  A few years ago, Cooper hospital bought up the houses surrounding the immediate area of the hopsital, and fixed up the streets and sold them only to hospital employees or immediate relatives. The hope was to install into the neighborhood the type of people they wanted living there. I haven't been to those exact blocks in awhile, but I would like to think this had some effect, though I do know they had trouble selling them for awhile.  Buying a land grab around the waterfront area may pay off as an investment in the medium term, but other than that I wouldn't put too much stock in Camden."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,surfnsound,2,Mon Jul 13 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Subaru is relocating their headquarters from Rt 70 to Camden, The 76ers are relocating their training facility and headquarters from Philly as well.  Doesn't necessarily bring tons of new jobs to Camden, but hopefully it continues to help clean up the Camden image that might entice other companies to follow along."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,sochac,2,Tue Jul 14 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately it does little for anything but the image. I know the 76ers got massive tax incentives to move the training facility there, even though almost all the jobs are simply moving from the old facility. I think they said it nets less than 20 new jobs. I don't know the details of the Subaru deal, but I'm sure they got tax breaks as well for little to no job gains."

SouthJersey,3d5wki,OriginUnknown,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, however its still a field with a lot of workers who can use that pay (gives them a set income versus say being laid off), so yes temporary, but it still helps quite a few individuals in the scheme of things.   Indirectly, if you start to see some ""larger companies"" like that move to an area, others may follow down the line. Have to start somewhere- and its not going to be a quick process."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,kigert,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:48:39 2015 UTC,"The problem is everyone wants the same tax deals the first guy got. Camden isn't going to have a Renaissance anytime soon without improving its education, which it can't do without tax rateables."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,kigert,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yes they get tax deals, but at the same time, the city is still gaining (its not like the first guy is getting everything for free), and its still a step up from say there not even being a first guy and hence no extra income for the city.  Education gets a bit tricky- and in many ways that whole system is flawed (ive seen/heard from people who have worked in other districts) and how in some cases, students just get passed to reach certain percentages to keep their funding. I don't think there is a clear-cut solution on education- personally I feel it needs to start more on community improvement b/c just by having better schools does not mean better kids/student, but it starts with having better neighborhoods/communities and making their daily lives better as kids growing up."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,inventsituations,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:19:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with your last point. I have been saying for awhile that the Abbot districts prove that simply giving more money to the school system doesn't show adequate return on investment, and that the huge sums we send to these districts would be better spent on other programs that would enhance a students ability to learn and retain knowledge. Too much is lost the second they step off school grounds."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,surfnsound,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:39:10 2015 UTC,"Similar issues are with other districts and the school results are no better. Areas such as Gloucester City is a big example. I have family why teach in their elemenatary system and as an AVID school, they basically have school-based daycare for kids as young as 3 and even give supplies such as diapers and whatnot. It doesn't make anything better giving hand-outs. Its more of a cop-out to the actual problems taking place but it seems like those issues no one wants to address."

Do you want to raise a family there? No. But an opportunist could do well buying and holding. The state commits a lot of resources into turning Camden around. Law enforcement is improving. There are many reasons to be optimistic about the future of the city. Obviously it takes time for the murder capital of the US to transform into a desirable living location. By the time comments on Camden become neutral or positive, it will be far too late to make an investment."

SouthJersey,3d5wki,NE_Rebel,3,Mon Jul 13 23:49:40 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I live in the area around Rutgers Camden and its not too bad. However, given the lack of restaurants open past work hours, a general feeling of safety, and a lack of grocery stores I would be wary to recommend moving here. A bright spot is that the area is close to mass transit via bus, riverline light rail to Trenton, and Patco into Philly. If you did, the area north of the Ben Franklin is now targeted for development by Rutgers and other groups. It's currently one of the worst neighborhoods in Camden but in the near future it could become livable. At the moment though, its subject to weekly shootings and Rutgers Students who make the mistake of living on the north side of the bridge have often been robbed or had their homes invaded at gunpoint.   I don't know much about Detroit but it seems much less dense than Camden. Meaning you might be one of a handful of people on any given block. While Camden is nearly as run down its still rather populated. You also get alot of roaming drug users who turn even the nice neighborhoods into more dangerous places. Given the reputation of Camden heroin they come from miles around and end up in Camden without fixed addresses just mulling around and harassing people.  I also don't see Camden being gentrified anytime soon. If you wanted to get in on a gentrification opportunity in the area I would suggest Philadelphia. Until Philadelphia runs out of dirt cheap housing close to the Center City there is no pressure for young professionals to move to Camden. Conditions aren't ripe for a situation like NYC where young professionals left Manhattan to go into Brooklyn, Hoboken, and now Jersey City."

SouthJersey,3d5wki,funny-irish-guy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:23:43 2015 UTC,"No problem, if you have any questions feel free to pm me later. Philadelphia is a great move. Its really become a one of the showcases for gentrification with the success of Fishtown, Northern Liberties, and huge parts of south Philadelphia. It also has a great culture and nightlife with pop-up beer gardens in up and coming neighborhoods, bars and restaurants etc. While redditors in /r/philadelphia  might know more specifically what areas are about to take off I wouldn't discourage anyone from considering buying cheap property in Philly in the right neighborhoods. Plus the city is really affordable compared to NYC and DC."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,funny-irish-guy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:28:07 2015 UTC,"The urban area I'm familiar with is Portland, to give you an idea."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,funny-irish-guy,3,Tue Jul 14 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"If you're from Portland and fancy yourself a ""bohemian"" you want to move to Philadelphia, not Camden.   If you're an investor I'd say yeah buy up some of those lots, theres an outside chance they'll be worth more in 30 or 40 years than they are now. But it seems like you're asking if there will be cool coffee shops and mustache waxariams in Camden in the near future and the answer to that is absolutely not.  I'm also a little concerned by the implication that you think gentrification is cool, you might want to post in /r/philadelphia and see how one might be received with that stance, it's not a universally popular one."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,MoonlightRider,2,Tue Jul 14 12:36:51 2015 UTC,"As a /r/philadelphia frequenter, I would say there are more pro-gentrification people than anti-. Many people realize gentrification is the only real, sustainable way to fix Philadelphia schools. Plus, a lot of the young, urban professionals who frequent the sub are part of the gentrification wave, would be hypocritical to be against it."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,NE_Rebel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:43:37 2015 UTC,"Except they are pretty hypocritical about it. I frequent /r/Philadelphia too, and while they are generally positive about transplants, there's always the few posts that reach the front page where it's just a big circlejerk about how great Philly is and how it doesn't need any more people. That being said, I realize most of them are transplants, and as a recent transplant myself (to a block on the edge of a relatively recent gentrification bubble) I don't take anything personally."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,surfnsound,5,Thu Jul 16 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"Short answer, you'd be very ahead of the gentrification wave. I would personally love to see it happen though. It's a perfect location, and there are already stirrings of it happening. They opened a small independent rum distillery in the city and they do a third Thursday art crawl that ends at the distillery I believe, and the city/state is making a huge push to bring in businesses by offering tax breaks. One place I used to work at moved there. The crime and drug use and poverty is very very real, so I'd recommended living somewhere around the university or hospital. My mom lives in Camden and I hate going there, but if you avoid the bad parts (there are many) and keep your eyes open you should be ok. They have a big community garden organization that they're trying to expand.   Edit: If you're looking for investment opportunities, I'm sure there are plenty of vacant lots, but the Victor Lofts is something to check out too. I've walked pass the place plenty of times but I just looked them up online and they look amazing based on their website. If the place ever does turn around those apartments will be worth a fortune. Don't be fooled by the few shots they have of the outside of the building in their gallery though, those three pictures are some quality photog work, it doesn't look that pretty. But if the inside pictures are to be believed, God damn."

SouthJersey,3d5wki,sandhol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:08:55 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue with the ""transformation"" of Camden, is that they are really only sticking with one distinct area near the university leading down to the waterfront.  The distillery is nice (was at it when it first opened up) and its 2 blocks from the campus down 4th street. As much as the local media has all this stuff about building up Camden, and yes they are taking strides, but its only that set sector it seems (in turn will become its own separate entity from the rest of Camden which is quite a different environment)."
SouthJersey,3d5wki,Brodi81,4,Fri Jul 17 11:57:39 2015 UTC,"You'll find similar problems in Camden as any other city your probably looking into. I do not live there but I used to live near it for a short time and my brother lives in a city the borders it.   You can look up the numbers on crime and they will all be understatements. Man big time drug dealers call Camden home, and deal drugs both in Camden and the surrounding areas. The new Metro PD has been doing a lot to curb the crime but its only slightly better than before. There are also outside agencies that are providing assistance as well. There are also shootings, burglaries, and robberies that have become commonplace that people don't even bat an eye anymore. News rarely even reports on the crime anymore.  You brought up pollution and that is also a huge problem as well. When entering Camden your immediately hit with what smells like popcorn and sweaty feet mixed together. You then notice most of the storm drains are full of trash and the empty lots are piled high with trash. You won't see much metal laying around though because people will pick up the aluminum cans and such as soon as they hit the ground to sell for money.   Many of the houses are abandoned and boarded up. Not just because no one wants to live there but many are condemned and unlivable. This may not be a terrible thing if a developer with money were to buy up the properties, demo the houses and rebuild from the ground up, but right now no one will move in unless it is section 8 or low income housing.  Along with dilapidated houses the roads are a complete mess. The dirt roads in my area are in better shape than many of the roads in the city.   After the businesses left (in the 70's and 80's I believe?) nothing new replaced them and there are very few job opportunities in the city itself.   Tips? Don't drive a low ride height vehicle around or you will scrape your undercarriage. Like any city take precautions at night. The area around the hospital isn't as bad as others and I would look for property around there. Good luck but as other users have said you may be quite a few years ahead of the cities time to turn it around."

Some people called the article poverty porn but the facts are pretty accurate.  • There are an estimated 175 open-air drug markets in Camden, a city of less than 9 square miles. With a meager population of 77,000 people, that's one open-air drug market per 440 people, children included.  • Municipal tax revenue in Camden was a paltry $25 million in 2011, which didn't even pay for the $65 million police force.  • Police Chief J. Scott Thomson said that Camden was ""somewhere between Honduras and Somalia"" in terms of its crime.  • In 2012, Camden's per-capita murder rate was ten times that of New York's, making it officially the most dangerous place in the United States. ""The carnage left Camden's crime rate on par with places like Haiti after its 2010 earthquake,"" writes Taibbi.  • In 2011 and 2012, there were times when fewer than 20 police officers were patrolling the streets of Camden. (The new county metro PD has improved this.)  • Approximately 1 in 3 shootings in Camden goes unreported.  • A few years ago, police had to serve warrants at one particularly dangerous housing-project tower called Northgate 1 (apparently part of the complex is known as Little Iraq), and ""they were so concerned with ground-level resistance that they invaded from the sky, like soldiers in Afghanistan, rappelling onto the roof by helicopter,"" writes Taibbi.  • Camden's last supermarket closed in September, rendering the city a ""food desert,"" according to the USDA.  • The city lost a third of its population since the 1950s, and approximately one-third of what's left is under the age of 18.  • More than 4 out of 5 of the people buying heroin in Camden are ""young, white and from the suburbs."""

SouthJersey,3ce4u7,Captain_gouda,5,Tue Jul 7 05:10:01 2015 UTC,Ridiculous.  This man wasn't hurting anyone.  The law needs to be changed.
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,TonyDiGerolamo,5,Tue Jul 7 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"This article is clearly skewed and not giving all the information.  A responsible gun owner looks up the law before transporting a firearm.  Google NJ Firearm laws, first page after Wikipedia.  It is LEGAL to transport firearms into the state of New Jersey.  The most likely scenario here is the firearm was loaded and not secured.  When the article is talking about reciprocity laws, they are talking about Concealed Permit Reciprocity Laws, not safe legal transportation of a firearm."
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,SNJ1010101,7,Tue Jul 7 13:04:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But, the governor did pardon the woman in PA who was just as ignorant to our laws as he was. We either need to start sticking with the law no exceptions or recognize that there is a problem with the law when it starts making criminals out of citizens and change it."
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,31stan,2,Tue Jul 7 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"tell me right now that if you lived in another state, you'd check the laws in the state you were visiting?  especially, if you lived in a state that had proper firearm rights (like, anywhere but NJ, NY, MD and CA)  you wouldn't.. you'd just do what you do everyday.  good and nice guys don't expect to get clobbered by the police when they aren't the bad guys."
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,ramblemn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:43:51 2015 UTC,It is legal to transport an unloaded and secured firearm between locations where it is legal to possess it. Where in NJ is this non-resident legally allowed to possess a firearm? At a shooting range?
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,toddrob,5,Sat Jul 11 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"If you legally buy marijuana in Colorado and take it to a state that has not legalized it...   you'll get arrested.  We in NJ greatly appreciate this man coming up to assist our residents, but isn't this common sense?"
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,jerseykeys,6,Tue Jul 7 10:40:24 2015 UTC,"The difference here is that it is generally well known that marijuana is only legal in a few key states. But with respect to gun ownership, transport and carrying NJ is one of the extreme outliers. A reasonable person wouldn't expect to be able to take weed across state lines. A better comparison would be to imagine if marijuana were legal everywhere and had been for hundreds of years and almost everywhere is it wasn't a big deal. Then you're shocked to find you are suddenly a felon facing jail time because you got pulled over with a joint in your pocket while traveling through NJ.    But still; he should have known. At this point everyone should be aware of how bad NJ is for legal gun owners."
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,Slug_DC,0,Tue Jul 7 11:51:04 2015 UTC,I think the marijuana argument holds up. As you say any reasonable person understands that state laws are different regarding marijuana. Well any reasonable gun owner should know the same when it comes to firearms. This is especially true in areas in the Northeast (like New Jersey and New York) which are notorious for being strict. As mentioned by others here it would only take seconds to google the gun laws of New Jersey.

SouthJersey,3ce4u7,Slug_DC,-2,Tue Jul 7 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"What difference does it make what he was here to do or what his profession is? He broke NJ law. That's like saying, ""well some guy murdered three people but because he is a doctor and he donates to charity, it's ok and we should let it slide."""
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,hellofellowhuman,10,Tue Jul 7 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"Yes because a lawful citizen who accidentally runs afoul of New Jersey's draconian gun laws is comparable to a multiple homicide. Come on, now.  His profession matters in this case because of the way he was called to come to our state. It wasn't like he was planning a vacation here. He and his team were specialists called for an emergency. According to the article he had only around an hour to get his gear together and get on the road so he can help us. That hour isn't being spent in a law library researching NJ code!  At this point every gun owner /should/ know about NJ's terrible gun restrictions. But we still shouldn't make a felon out of a lawful citizen (in addition to possible jail time; killing their right to vote, risking their job, having a record, and all the other hardships that come with a felony conviction) because he didn't know or didn't consider it when rushing here in an emergency basis."
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,31stan,-1,Tue Jul 7 11:40:19 2015 UTC,He broke the law.  You can't be law-abiding and law-breaking at the same time.  Your first sentence indicates the limits of your argument's logic.  If you want to say that the law is silly?  Fine.  But you can't have it both ways.
SouthJersey,3ce4u7,hellofellowhuman,8,Tue Jul 7 12:52:37 2015 UTC,When the law starts making criminals out of citizens there is a problem with the law not the people.

Seems home girl is addicted to heroin.   *** 4 GCPO fugitive arrests ***  Defendants who failed to appear in Superior Court on charges of robbery, receiving stolen property, aggravated assault and narcotics possession were arrested in the past week by the Fugitive Investigations Unit of the Gloucester County Prosecutor’s Office.  Janae A. Heffernan (DOB 1/24/84), of National Park, was taken into custody 7/6/15 after she was observed riding in a passenger seat of a truck on Ogden Rd., Mantua Township. The truck stopped at an Ashton Court address in Mantua, and she was arrested there. A warrant was issued for Heffernan after she did not appear for a 7/6/15 Superior Court status conference on a charge of receiving stolen property in West Deptford. The property had been stolen in an 8/3/14 burglary. When arrested, Heffernan was in possession of three bags of suspected heroin, two hypodermic needles and one tab of suboxone. She was turned over to the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department and was held without bail.  Julian S. Scarpaci (DOB 5/25/96), of Paulsboro, was taken into custody 7/7/15 at his West Washington St. residence. A warrant was issued for Scarpaci after he failed to appear for a 7/1/15 Superior Court pre-arraignment interview on a first-degree robbery charge. He is accused of robbing a Paulsboro Rite-Aid pharmacy at gunpoint on 1/18/15. Scarpaci was turned over to the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department and is being held without bail. Assisting in the arrest was the Paulsboro Police Department.  Melissa A. Donahue (DOB 11/13/83), of Woodbury, was arrested 7/8/15 at a Days Inn motel in Runnemede NJ. Donahue was wanted for failing to appear for a Superior Court pre-arraignment interview on a charge of possession of suspected heroin, methamphetamine, Lorazepam and cyclobenzaprine on 1/22/15 in Woodbury.

She was turned over to the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department and is being held without bail. Assisting in the arrest was the Runnemede Police Department.  Tiniqua L. Witcher (DOB 3/18/93), of Paulsboro, was taken into custody 7/10/15 at a Nelson Ave. address in Woodbury.

It agrees with what wikipedia says pretty well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey  I am in favor of 5 regions, actually: North, Northwest, Central, Shore, and South.  And to answer your question, it's in the south/central contested zone. I'd call it central because I'm from nearby."

I said south but I have no clue really. The real point here is that multiple residents (young 20s) were unsure themselves
SouthJersey,3bnvtd,spiteful_life,0,Tue Jun 30 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"I've always considered it central(it's in the middle of the state).  For me,  South was always like Forked river,  or Manahawkin on down.   I don't know why,  its irrational,  but it annoys me to be called south Jersey.    There's at least 82 miles of jersey south,  and around 90 north."

Please do yourself a favor and look up what a state of emergency is because right here you sound like a 12 year old YouTube commentator.   Secondly, we DID need a SOE deceleration. Doing that would have allowed State funding to be injected into the relief efforts which would have had power restored MUCH quicker. And the roads would have been cleared by now, I still have to tack on 30min's to my commute in the morning because various roads still have downed trees/power lines.   When Sandy hit Christie couldn't jump fast enough. Even going by your backwards knowledge of what defines a SOE, Sandy didn't affect the whole state. If you cant read between the lines I don't know what else to say, Christie is the governor of North Jersey and that's a fact."

While I am no fan of Christie, there really isn't a need to declare a state of emergency for every damn storm that blows through. I've had much worse weather in Houston where they didn't have a state of emergency.  Christie himself said, ""Right now what's happening is FEMA is on the ground with the Office of Emergency Management of the State Police and they are assessing the damage level. You don't need a state of emergency declaration in order to get federal funds if you need a certain threshold and if there's anything that a state of emergency declaration would do to enhance our ability to get more help more quickly, I'd be happy to do that.""  Ya'll are over reacting."
SouthJersey,3b9i64,meeper88,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"Where I live there wasn't a need for a state of emergency (can't speak for other areas).  What I would have appreciated was any sort of sign that Christie was even aware that a storm had taken out a bunch of the southern third of the state, some sort of acknowledgement that folks might be having trouble.  Maybe something like ""We know the storm hit a wide area and we're monitoring the situation"" or ""Road and power crews are doing everything they can to restore service to those who've lost it"".  I wasn't looking for hand-holding, I was looking for any awareness that Christie even knew that some folks might be having difficulty.  Instead there was absolute silence on the subject for three days, then he slipped a casual dismissal of the situation into a late-Friday statement where it was going to be pretty much completely ignored in the rush of news that day.  You wanna lead, Christie?  Get out in front and be fucking visible.  Don't fucking hide in a corner and hope no-one notices you.  Fucking asshole."

At a hearing, J.H. said the bayonet was his and that he had left it in the car’s trunk after attending a trade show. The ruling indicated J.H.’s wife, while driving under the influence, had taken the bayonet from the trunk and placed it in the vehicle’s passenger compartment.   this proves she cannot be trusted to stay away from firearms, even when driving while drunk."

Third variables: population density, government, private interests, military training, law enforcement authority, corruption, exploitative elements of culture.  And then there's just the simple, brutal question of whether ""less people dying"" makes society as a whole ""better"". By what measure? There would be more of us. A lot more. And we have yet to learn how to stop making babies.  So let's stop with the high horse rationalization, shall we? What you're proposing is morally relativistic, not objectively better.

It makes it virtually impossible to continue, because even if I had read the required reading (which I have), I would have to write a novel to respond to each point. And if I choose to only response to most of the points, the arguer still has the option of going ""but you didn't respond to point #17!"" and maintain the upper hand.  I'm honestly not sure what the ideal response is, beyond saying simply that I am aware of the concepts you have outlined and they do not change my point of view, which I will restate by 180-ing your wall of information tactic with a ELI5 tactic:   Take the guns. We don't need them. They are bad. Guns are bad. Guns make it too easy to kill people, either purposefully or accidentally. Take them away from everyone.

Way of life. Sucks but it's true.  When there are too many animals - especially predators - in an area, competition becomes more difficult. How to manage this competition? How to thin the herd? Well, there's scarcity - they all starve for awhile until the weak ones all die. There's direct competition - they start fighting and the weak ones all die. There's indirect competition - the weak ones kill themselves.  In your cute little fantasy world where we have no guns, this axiom doesn't go away - this is why I'm trying to explain to you that what you're proposing is morally relativistic, not objectively better. Because if you take away guns, we still have shit poverty in high population density areas, and population will control itself by one of those means.  So yes, you necessarily have to talk about all of those things before you start snorting and pawing the ground like a fucking tough guy strong-arming your way into disarmament. YES, you have to fucking argue it. It has taken people's entire careers to address this issue, and you think you know exactly what to do in the space of one edgy comment on Reddit. So get off your high horse. You're not right. You're just voicing an opinion."
SouthJersey,3am17h,domdest,2,Mon Jun 22 14:46:50 2015 UTC,"if guns are the problem, then why are suicide rates the same regardless of firearm availability?  if guns are the problem, then why does texas CHL tracking, show that gun carrying people aren't causing the crimes?  Gun control advocates constantly compare US and UK homicide rates as evidence of gun control working, yet the UK and US suicide rate is practically identical.  Socioeconomically speaking, the US is far worse than the UK. The US has far more poverty, a higher wealth inequality rate, higher unemployment rate among other things.  But if more guns = more suicides, why is it that a gun saturated nation like Switzerland has a suicide rate of 11.1? Which is far lower than many gun restrictive countries. Half of Swiss households own any sort of gun.  Canada and Australia. These countries implemented restrictive gun control, gun suicides went down, but methods such as hanging rose.

SouthJersey,3a92ky,legwrapsandtattoes,2,Thu Jun 18 04:56:59 2015 UTC,"I live in Pennsville, i would highly recommend not living in Salem. I'd look into places in Pennsville, Deepwater, Carneys Point, Quinton, or Woodstown. Those are all the surrounding towns right here and they're all pretty decent, Pennsville has high taxes and idk why that is, they don't fix shit lol but it is a rather nice place to raise a family."
SouthJersey,3a92ky,Thatguypinky,2,Thu Jun 18 13:35:46 2015 UTC,Hillcrest Apartments would be a good place to start looking.  Woodstown is a decent place and about 15 minutes from Salem.
SouthJersey,3a92ky,Brodi81,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:20:04 2015 UTC,"Was going to mention this. I used to live in these apartments and they're not too bad. Woodstown is a nice town though, I still live here and it's very quiet. I see ""for rent"" signs on a lot of the 1st floor shops on both Main St. and East Ave. advertising 2nd floor apartments.  There's also Laura Glen (I think that's the name) apartments on 49 in Pennsville, which is just outside Salem and in a decidedly nicer area. There's another apartment complex on 45 in Mullica Hill just north of Woodstown that I was looking into, looked clean and was cheaper than Hillcrest at the time (2013).  I work at the nuclear plant and I can get there in half an hour from Woodstown. From the Route 40/45 intersection to the 45/49 intersection in Salem takes probably twenty minutes, less in good traffic."
SouthJersey,3a92ky,DamienCIsDead,2,Thu Jun 18 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"Salem is kind of a shit hole. You should avoid it. I was born and raised in Salem County, and Salem (and Penns Grove) should be avoided if possible. You're better off moving to Pennsville or Deepwater, which are next to the bridge to Delaware. Or, just move to Delaware, which is all-around cheaper than living in NJ."

SouthJersey,3a92ky,Gankstar,6,Thu Jun 18 05:14:26 2015 UTC,"hmm, hard to give you real advice without being politically incorrect.  Are you single?  male? Female? Black? white? Have kids?  What are you used to? Poverty level?  Lower mid?  Middle?  Upper Middle?  Is your job IN salem or are you a nuclear island import for an outage or something?   Salem has a lot of bad elements in it.  Lots of drugs and thugs.  Crack heads and pill poppers. If you are ok with a harsher environment such as this it might work for you. Salem is 60% black 35% white.    If not you might want to look for a place on the outskirts of town out of walking distance.  LAC (lower allow ways creek) is mostly country and close to the island.  Id imagine if you are going for an outage lots of rentals will be taken up by other temp workers.   Pennsville is an OK town. Thats where lots of outagers go.  Still some drugs but a lot less violent crimes.  White 94% 3% black 1% asian.  In all honesty salem county is a pretty dead county.  Not much going on there except the island and a couple remaining production facilities.  Lots of decent places over the bridge in DE but if you are commuting to Salem or the island every day that will be a bit of a drive + bridge tolls."
SouthJersey,3a92ky,ryosen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:28:21 2015 UTC,Yea I don't want to live in Salem proper. I was told I should find a surrounding neighborhoods at least 40 mins away. Just wanted to get know which are close or if I should look in Delaware instead

SouthJersey,3a92ky,Gankstar,2,Thu Jun 18 18:41:11 2015 UTC,FYI if you get a NJ EZPass you can get the commuter discount for the Delaware memorial bridge. That way you could live in Delaware (trolley square is where a lot of young people live) and only pay $1 each day to get to work.

SouthJersey,3a2t94,TonyDiGerolamo,5,Tue Jun 16 19:59:39 2015 UTC,"Dunno why this got downvoted. The place is a shithole. My mother was a schizophrenic, but perfectly harmless. She had a minor episode on a bus, thinking that the bus driver was my dead brother. She recovered very quickly, but everyone on the bus was freaked out, and the ambulance driver who responded didn't believe her when she said she was fine now.  She ends up for a stay in Ancora after a short stay at the local hospital, because the doctors didn't believe her when she said she was fine. She stepped outside the hospital to walk around on the grass and get some fresh air, and they thought she was ""escaping"". So she gets labelled as disorderly and combative with the doctors. Off she goes to Ancora.  While at Ancora, she was beat up by other patients there, and the orderlies just stood by and watched.  I had no idea any of this had happened, because I was out of touch with her for a few months. I go to visit her, and she had bruises all over her arms. A 60yr old woman getting the shit kicked out of her, and no one steps in to help.   So yeah, fuck that place."
SouthJersey,3a2t94,El_Dubious_Mung,5,Tue Jun 16 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"I work with an organization that helps the disabled. (Both physical and mental.)  The stories coming out of Ancora are depressing and I'm always saddened when I have to pull security footage related to a psychiatric episode because I always assumed they ended up in Ancora.  It's truly a shit hole. The primary issue I've heard is that they don't separate the violent from the rest of the population.   The worst part is you have a lot of institutions shutting down across the state due to lack of funding so these people are getting let loose into the general population to live in a group home and get even worse psychiatric care when they can't even get help where they originally were.  So they are just going to end up in Ancora and the people who can truly be rehabilitated with a little bit of counseling and medicine are just going to be held back by the type of situation your mother was in.  We were such a great state when I originally started working with this certain nonprofit and every year it's just another fight on both the federal and state level to keep things floating enough to even make an impact. I expect it all to crumble in the next 6 years, unfortunately."
SouthJersey,3a2t94,keepinithamsta,3,Tue Jun 16 23:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole mental health field is pretty much under siege. I had a counselor who advised the state of Pennsylvania on children's mental health. He would tell me horror stories like the state would only allow the kids to get one 30 minute visit every month. If the kid's in a crisis situation, you might as well not even see him/her. Like pissing in the wind.   I'm on disability for mental health issues, and I pay out of pocket to see my psychiatrist. It's just not worth it to get in the system."
SouthJersey,3a2t94,El_Dubious_Mung,3,Tue Jun 16 23:45:07 2015 UTC,"What hurts me the most is our primary function and income is through job placement programs.  I know when our organization is forced to fold that I'm going to be able to find another job relatively easily.  Without job counseling, the thousand or so we employ are just going to fall through the cracks.  It's going to be a massive step backward especially for the rights of the severely developmentally disabled since they can't consistently do work without someone helping them.  So the individuals who aren't living with family are just going to be confined to a group home or institution for 365 days a year.  That's not a way to live.  All the while the politicians that are stripping help away from the disabled fly under the radar because they are attempting to balance a skyrocketing deficit by cutting pennies that help a relatively small population.  It's always the ones that refuse to visit our buildings to see what is actually going on."

SouthJersey,39xsdw,magicfatkid,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"I used to do that kinda work, but I don't have my tools anymore, so I can't really help you there.  However, anyone who can do this work will charge you the same price, whether it's in a shop or not. The skills and work cost what they cost, regardless of where the work happens. Buying the paint yourself will knock the price down, but the solvents, mixing cups, sandpaper, bondo, etc...that's still gonna be factored into the price.   You're better off going to a shop. There are guys that have mobile setups, but they mainly work at dealerships. At a shop, the compressors all have moisture filters and heatlamps to cure the paint and everything. You can't just haul that stuff around easily. The mobile guys mainly do spot work (little knicks in your bumper and shit). They won't do a full hood and bumper, because that requires a clean paint booth.   With paintjobs, you get what you pay for. I highly recommend you go to a shop.   THAT BEING SAID  I don't have his number anymore, but if you go to the Mercedes Benz dealership on Rt. 70, across from Wegmans, there's a guy there named Harry (the wheel repair guy). Ask one of the lot boys there, not the guys in suits. Don't pull into the garage area there. Just park off to the side.   I used to work for Harry some years back, and he's a good guy. I don't know if he's still there. He runs a business called East Coast Wheels. They do wheel repair for these high end cars, but they have the equipment necessary to do a hood. It would be on the downlow, because dealerships don't like people cutting into eachother's business. It's not shady, just dealership drama shit.    They're still gonna want to make some money, but they'll cut you a deal. If that doesn't work out, just go to an autobody place. No-one is really gonna do side-work, because they'll get just as much money in the shop. This is why I recommend Harry, because you'd be bringing him side-business, so he'd give you a good price, and he still has all the gear necessary for the job."

SouthJersey,39rxn7,BlackwoodBear79,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"the other one i know of is Jessops Taven.  Although located in New Castle,de.  its really close to SNJ; 10 min ride over the Del Mem Br. They are a old school tavern with wait staff in character.  Big portions for pub prices.  good selection of beer too     http://www.jessops-tavern.com/about.html  one other honorable mention would be medieval times.  dinner / theatre show.  www.medievaltimes.com/lyndhurst.aspx"
SouthJersey,39rxn7,erikx213,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:45:26 2015 UTC,"If you like Fondue (cooking meats and vegetables in a pot at your table with a hot liquid such as beer or oil) the Melting Pot is always a good option.  Expect to spend 2-3 hours though, and it'll be around 120 for a couple.  Locations in Philly and AC.  If you don't mind loud crowds and ""shows during dinner"", there's always Medieval Times, so I agree with the other poster who mentioned it.  Speaking of ""shows during dinner"" Maggiano's in Cherry Hill runs Murder Mystery dinners a couple times a year.  Also someone in this subreddit indicated that their theatrical group is investigating the possibility of running one.  If you go to a decent sushi place and order ""omakase"" (chef's selection; literally ""I leave it to you"") there's typically great interaction with the chef.  However keep in mind you'll likely end up with a variety of things that you've never tried before.  I've never had the cajones to order this way (but my fiancee promises we'll do it ""eventually"") but I understand it can be a little pricy.  A quick search shows some restaurants in Philly start at 33/person.  Brazilian churrascaria like Rodizio Grill (Voorhees at the ""Town Center""/Echelon Mall) or Fogo de Chao (Philly) are also quite unique as they bring large skewers of different types of meats around to you.  Also around 120/couple."

I'm south jersey also, but about 50 minutes south from you and theres a couple facebook groups you should add. Flow jam new jersey, south jersey flow, jersey fire spinning, new jersey hoopers, south jersey drum circles, and try this local festival's group called sector 7 at camp jam in the pines. Those are the new jersey/south jersey flow groups. All your answers will be found there and there's no need to pay when there are plenty of people that get together often weekly close to your area.  ispintoys on facebook has a somewhat weekly flow meetup called mars.  As far as local festival's, beardfest is this weekend and it's super cheap. You could go for one day if you wanted and meet up with a bunch of these local people from these groups. Farmfest is coming up too and is cheap/local. Mid September is going to have camp jam in the pines which is an awesome local festival but you said you are leaving in Sept."

The line-up is amazing and it's at a water park. Theres also Catskill Chill, Mountain Jam(just ended), All Good, Camp Bisco(this is where the crazy's are at), and join Jambase on facebook. They report on a lot of festivals. Also check your state for local festivals. I just found two under 100$ festivals that were very local to me and I didn't know they existed and I went to the first one Camp Jam In The Pines and it was amazing, plus it's twice a year, and I found out they are having Farm Fest in the same place too. Deleware Valley Bluegrass festival. Wing Gap. Grey Fox. Delfest(just ended but my favorite festival). Gathering of the Vibes. My mind has now went blank. edit: A good way to find festivals around you is join in some facebook groups for flow or poi or hooping and those people talk about local festivals all the time. Come over to /r/Poi[1] and learn how to make some sock poi while you are at it."""

SouthJersey,397qf6,FBtheRez,8,Tue Jun 9 21:26:47 2015 UTC,In Millville there is a secondhand book shop called Bogart's. They give store credit for paperbacks so you can buy more books. I believe the credit covers 70-75% of the cost of preowned books. I've been going there for over 20 years and love them. No hardbacks or romance novels though. They've got way too many.
SouthJersey,397qf6,Cthulhu_Slumbers,2,Tue Jun 9 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"About six or seven years ago, right before I last moved, I used a website that bought about half my books. They give you a media-mail label, you just have to box them and drop them at a post office. I got a decent amount for them, did not feel ripped off at all. Alas, i forget the name of the website..but google revealed to me that there are a few similar services out there. So that's an option."

Otherwise, you're looking at nothing in GlouCo (there was a place in Mullica Hill, but it closed at least five years ago)—there's Book Trader in Collingswood, but that's just going to net you store credit."
SouthJersey,397qf6,linniex,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:06:39 2015 UTC,"The issue i found with reselling my books on Amazon was the shipping cost - if you have a heavy book, Amazon still only gives you a shipping 'allowance' of $3.99.  I sold a text book for $10 that cost me $20 to send. On the flip side, i had an old library book we bought at a library sale, it had some pictures in it from a hot rod guy, book sold for $100.  Couldnt belive it."

Picasso is like 25-30 and you can bring your own case of paint. Not sure what the pricing or the turnout is for the airsoft. Sorry I can't help you much. You might also check out OXCC in Maryland. It sounds far, but it really isn't. It's in Chesapeake City, MD. I've seen them run airsoft games there too. You can find these fields on FB and ask them or call and ask about price and game days.

Competitive pricing with anyone out there, a huge amount of space nobody else offers, different playing environments from speedball to dense woods with castles, buildings, and other wooden obstacles to get tactical with your game. They're the best place in the country, just ask the guys who do the big reenactment events each year there...there are hundreds of thousands who have done those."

SouthJersey,385m1s,AndIPullOutMyNine,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:43:09 2015 UTC,"This is probably your best advice.  If you search ""direct care workers"" you'll find a lot of jobs that only require a drivers license and a high school degree.  These jobs won't give you a livable wage but they will give you valuable experience working with special needs kids.  The teaching profession doesn't have the best job outlook seeing how classrooms are getting bigger and more computer driven than teacher driven.  Special Ed will be one of the teaching jobs that can sustain the technological unemployment soon to come.  Also it's great to work within this population to see if teaching is for you.  Today teaching is 95% classroom management.  If you can't control your classroom it doesn't matter what school you have a degree from so that behavior health experience will go a long way when applying for your first teaching gig."

SouthJersey,385m1s,herbalaffair,2,Wed Jun 3 03:13:34 2015 UTC,I think the state law requires 60 college credits to be a sub (which is about 2 years). You have to be fingerprinted (around $75) and pay for a license (around $120). Any school district office will have the paperwork and can help with the process.

Dogs spend all day playing (with a webcam feed my wife would watch most the day at work) and sleep in separated ""cabins"" at night. They would let both dogs stay in the same cabin though since they were part of the same household. Overall it was a real good place for us even if it's a bit pricey. Dogs always came home exhausted from all the play time which was a bonus."

Our 2nd monthly meetup is tonight at the Mays Landing Library around 7 actually. Last one was a great turnout and there were plenty of games to choose from.  I prefer the off season as its much more quiet and I can find parking on my street. Lol  Pleasantville is cheap and you get what you pay for.

Then just keep the $500 in the bank and when you get back pay off the loan and get your car back. The interest on a $500 loan shouldn't add up to much even if you are gone for a couple of months.

SouthJersey,36ihuj,sochac,3,Wed May 20 02:04:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see the positives in changing the law over. On one side there has been wordage such as ""economic efficiency"" since you don't really need to pay people to pump gas when the consumer can do it themselves; on the other side, changing over does not seem to have a positive impact on the economy- oil/gas companies will just have more money, jobs lost, and no redistribution of said funds in a positive light, i.e. by getting rid of attendants and not paying said employees it has no impact on our states taxes, finances, etc.   Might as well leave it as/is, its nice when its cold outside or raining, and at worst I've had is a 2 or 3 minute wait...i'll survive."
SouthJersey,36ihuj,socks_optional,1 point,Tue May 19 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Oil/Gas Companies don't operate the stations, they make their money refining and distributing. From the article:  ""Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline, Convenience Store, Automotive Association, said that 30 years ago, big oil companies owned and operated many retail stations and had a financial advantage over smaller operators, making it easier for them to transition to self-service and resulting in the group's opposition.  That's changed now, Risalvato added. Gas station operators said self-service would allow them to stay open overnight and could result in fewer closed pumps due to lack of manpower.""  More information here:  http://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas-overview/consumer-information/service-station-faqs.aspx  ""Do the major oil companies own all the service stations in this country?- No. According to the latest information, the major integrated oil companies own about 2% of the 152,995 retail stations and operate about a third of the retail stations that they do own. When a station bears a particular API member’s brand, it does not mean that the API member owns or operates the station. The vast majority of branded stations are owned and operated by independent retailers licensed to represent that brand. According to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), 58% of the retail stations in the US are owned by an individual or family that owns a single store. Through various branding agreements, approximately 36% of the retail stations in the US sell fuel under API members’ brands. See U.S. Service Station Outlets Summary."""

SouthJersey,36ihuj,thegr8rambino13,1 point,Thu May 21 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"Because self-serve is an insurance risk. Whenever you get gas, ask yourself this... Do I know where the E-stop button is? The fire extinguisher? The spill cleanup kit? Do I know how to use them if the need were to arise? If you answered no to any of these, you're part of the risk, and gas stations that allow self-serve have to pay much higher insurance premiums because of it. Not just that, they have to pay for automatic fire suppression and spill containment equipment. None of this applies when only full-serve is allowed. If a gas station has both, they need to pay for all that and the labor for full-serve, which means charging more for it.  Really, it's the same reason you're not allowed to prepare your own food at any food service establishment."

When outlets started, they were actual factory outlets, places for samples, rejects and overstock to be sent. But that's not sustainable on the scale Premium and Tangier operate at.  Now most of what you see in outlets is products specifically made for the outlets, using lower quality materials and sometimes not even being done by the designer it claims to be. Calvin Klein or Coach contracts out to some cheap overseas company and agrees to put their logo on it."

They new outlets sit directly on Rt 42 which gets close to 100,000 cars driving by every day.  Its a direct route from Philly, and the closest outlet mall to Center City.  From Deptford Mall south there really is no shopping destination other than the Deptford Mall (which is why the mall has been so successful for 40 years).  People in the wealthier towns of Washington Twp and Mullica Hill will flock to the higher end outlet shops.  As a Deptford resident, I have some concern on the Deptford shopping area... but Deptford is booming right now also."

Try turning it off and unplugging it for about 15 minutes.  If you're using a wired connection between your device and the router, you can try switching it to a different outlet on the back of the router as well.  My final attempt would be to hold down the reset button for ... err, I think it's supposed to be like 45 seconds, but I usually hold it for just over a minute.  Other than that, I usually turn it over to my roommate (they're home during the day).  Roomie has to spend a couple hours with them on the phone, then Verizon ends up remotely logging into the PC to do some shit (roomie never bothers to follow along so we can do it ourselves, despite repeated asking on my part), then it returns to normal.

Im not a fan of the food.  Beer Menus: Irish Mile is updated once a week or so.   Keg & kitchen, smaller taplist, but decent. Decent can & bottle list too. The food is ok.  They just opened a small beer garden outside, i haven't tried it out yet.  Their beer menus page is updated once a month or less, its not useful."

I've never rode any of the bus services (Megabus, Bolt Bus, etc) but I'm sure if you book far enough in advance you can probably get there pretty cheap.  The 30th street station is another option, but I can't imagine Amtrak is cheaper than NJ transit."

SouthJersey,357tnf,vermiciousemily,1 point,Thu May 7 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"Bolt Bus or Megabus are the best options. If you buy your ticket in advance you can get it for as little as $7.

SouthJersey,3520d4,op00to,5,Wed May 6 13:40:41 2015 UTC,They do this shit all the time but wasn't on the south jersey subreddit before.  They file the 3 lanes down to one in an area where you get stuck.  They check for pretty much any violation and some randoms then make you pull off into a parking lot where they can really screw you.  I live 1 min off 130 where they do this and they do it often.
SouthJersey,3520d4,op00to,0,Wed May 6 14:57:03 2015 UTC,"If it's an honest violation (expired license, reg, insurance, warrant), I can't get too upset. Driving is a privilege, not a right. Plenty of people drive without insurance, and when they hit you, you're the one that gets screwed. Considering we got rid of the safety inspection in NJ, I'm hoping the police do some cursory check. It's frustrating and inconvenient, but I would hope the police would wave traffic through when it starts to back up."
SouthJersey,3520d4,Bisconauts,6,Wed May 6 18:27:35 2015 UTC,No violation for me at all.  It was random clearly.  That or I got pulled for being white on a Wednesday.  Looked at my crap and let me go.  I was 15 mins late to a customer.  That's bullshit no matter how you view it.

SouthJersey,3520d4,ramblemn,1 point,Thu May 7 04:02:21 2015 UTC,They never do it on the southbound side.  They like to do it right there on the northbound side.  Sometimes they do High street (the road that runs between 295 and 130.  They also like to do it on Salem Road.  But mostly it's 130.

Based on the rules of that subreddit it's to belittle those that feel their rights get trampled on yadda yadda so they make a cops job more difficult.  So if that's the case, shill, I never said I felt my rights were being trampled on nor was I being a pain to the cops the time they did pull me in.  I simply advise others so they can prepare or avoid the nonsense.  You may enjoy getting pulled into a checkpoint for nonsense and waste time out of your day, but some of us have jobs and customers to get to who are a little less understanding of why you are late.

You're more likely to be screwed by them deciding to do work to it but that's mostly at night.  The river line on the other hand.

In addition, it's a dry town with a big heroin problem. There are it's plus sides, it's close to philly and Glassboro, so getting out and finding something to do is easy enough. That being said it's not a very stimulating place.

The planning/zoning boards have some say in approving the use, but if it conforms to the permitted uses (and Bancroft isn't that different, at least on paper, so there's likely precedent), it's going to have to take a court fight.   Haddonfield itself probably wouldn't want to take up that cause; it's stupidly expensive, for starters. If residents can float the cash - and we're talking tens of thousands, go check out what Cherry Hill folks are spending to fight the apartments at the old lumberyard - then they can tie it up, at least for a while.

SouthJersey,31jjwq,NippleMilk97,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"Not a criminal justice expert, but I think the main point is intimidation. Also, you can have them chase after someone on foot without putting a cop's life in jeopardy. And the drug/bomb sniffing stuff. But it's such a throwaway thing in court, I'd imagine "" no, your honor, WE didn't kill the guy, the DOG did!' kinda thing. Idk. It's all out of hand if you as me"
SouthJersey,31jjwq,vey323,3,Mon Apr 6 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"Intimidation is a legitimate justification? That sucks for us. Also, use as a scapegoat isn't legitimate either.  On the other two counts, use to chase a subject and drug/bomb sniffing - On the first, any time it is used to subdue a perp while leashed would then be considered unjust. On the second, a german shepherd is not needed to drug/bomb sniff. They aren't even the best at it. There are many other breeds that wouldn't be as violent that could be used to drug sniff.  I suppose only a combination could be justified, as a dual-use. Why keep one dog for subduing a fleeing perp and one for drug sniffing when they can have one do both. This still doesn't justify the use of a dog in this case, but I can see the argument for the use of police dogs overall now.  Thanks for the input! Cheers!"

My understanding is his death is likely drug related, but I'll wait for the autopsy results - which everyone should be doing. The use of force here is not excessive.   Couldn't get this video to play right, but watched another channel 10 video on YouTube (seems to be the same one) that showed an interview with someone saying he was a "" caring person"". Another interview had someone say he was a ""good dude"". Here's copy-pasta from another submission:   In June, White was charged with shoplifting, obstruction and resisting arrest for allegedly taking more than $370 worth of baby formula from the Wal-Mart on West Landis Avenue. White fled the scene, and police chased him down. Authorities said a police officer was injured in the ensuing scuffle.  Superior Court records show White has a criminal history dating to at least 2001. White has pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes, including burglary, robbery and drug offenses.  White was charged with weapon and drug offenses during Operation Blood Lines, which resulted in 17 arrests in Cumberland County in April 2008. One of those arrested was a man who authorities called a kingpin in the “Sex Money Murda” branch of the national Bloods gang   People need to stop with this bullshit. He was most certainly NOT a ""good dude"". I am in no way saying he deserved to die. But folks need to stop trying to paint habitual offenders as innocents."

SouthJersey,300wbh,sdm1031,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:47:26 2015 UTC,I tried this whole ordeal a few years ago and with a few suppliers.  In both cases it was not worth the switch.  Be careful it's not one of the places that start with a lower rate and then after a few months you notice they charge more than PSE&G.  Short of that it's all seamless.  You get the same PSEG bill and the supplier charges are just incorporated into the bill.
SouthJersey,300wbh,sdm1031,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sadly only with PSEG for one of my services. I have to price out all 3. I do see 6 month contracts with companies. If the switch is easy, why not switch every contract period"

SouthJersey,2zxdse,chucksturgis,3,Sun Mar 22 20:37:18 2015 UTC,Try the Flyers Skate Zone in Vorhees. There is a league that plays Sunday nights and is open to any age.

SouthJersey,2zt84s,CAMEL_DICK,3,Sat Mar 21 15:23:24 2015 UTC,This flyer gives me absolutely no indication of what the event is
SouthJersey,2zt84s,squidsquad,-2,Sat Mar 21 17:57:36 2015 UTC,Have you never been to a rock show?
SouthJersey,2zt84s,thelostdolphin,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:47:35 2015 UTC,I've been to plenty but I admit I haven't ever heard of We Speak in Sounds. When I saw Grace Church my first inclination was that it was some religious event.  The bottom of the flyer made it clear it was a show since I didn't think a church would charge a cover.
SouthJersey,2zt84s,minze,-1,Sat Mar 21 23:06:53 2015 UTC,I guess I've gone to and played enough shows at weird venues like this or the  Unitarian church in the city that I didn't think twice what the poster was for.
SouthJersey,2zt84s,thelostdolphin,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although a poster for a church that says ""We speak in Sounds"" would be just as telling  :)"

SouthJersey,2zp5ub,klonk,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"You and me both, bottles are an expensive gamble when trying something new. Total Wine does have a good selection, it just sucks buying a bottle and saying ""its not bad but I don't know if I like it enough to buy a bottle"". I'll definitely update if I find anything."
SouthJersey,2zp5ub,klonk,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:09:50 2015 UTC,I've been trying to get friends to all buy into a bottle together... But it usually takes me 3 glasses before I can determine if a bottle is good or not.

It's a speakeasy in Atlantic City Bottling Company http://acbottlecompany.com/food/. They have a fantastic curated selection of whiskies, wine, microbrews. The food is amazing and it has a constantly changing menu that keeps me coming back for more. I don't know if they still do it, but they had half priced whisky on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Edit: how could I forget about the cheese! Glorious cheese!"

SouthJersey,2ze1kl,El_Cano,4,Tue Mar 17 20:22:27 2015 UTC,I hope you are not suggesting teachers should be forced to work for free even more than they already do.  It blew my mind how much teachers do outside of their contracted hours.  I wish they got paid a but more to compensate all the unpaid work they do.
SouthJersey,2ze1kl,willia99,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that teachers should be paid more, after all they help shape the minds of every family most precious resource.  What concerns me is that while they are stopping unpaid work, I get the sense that parent are not aware this is happening and therefore the impact of that action is diminished, as parent will not apply pressure for the teacher contract to settle.  Hence my question to see if any other Cherry Hill parents are experiencing the impact of the teachers actions."
SouthJersey,2ze1kl,SlamDunx,3,Wed Mar 18 23:31:17 2015 UTC,"Settling the contract isn't just on the teachers.  There are two sides negotiating and if the teachers are going to get screwed by settling, then they should hold out."
SouthJersey,2ze1kl,SlamDunx,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:17:31 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I think the negotiations would go quicker and in the teachers's benefit if there was an effective campaign.

SouthJersey,2ze1kl,SlamDunx,3,Sat Mar 21 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a teacher, I just want to encourage people to remember/realize that, generally, teachers don't want to do these kind of actions.  Since public workers can't strike, working to contract regulations only is one of the few ways that teachers can actually try to capture the attention of the general public about the contract situation.  (Obviously no one in this thread is bashing teachers for the action, but inevitably with actions like this you get ""Oh my god they're so selfish/greedy"" responses about teachers.  We seem to be the only industry/profession who gets referred to as that when we look for better contracts)."
SouthJersey,2z8pbl,TonyDiGerolamo,3,Mon Mar 16 15:42:33 2015 UTC,Sounds good.  I hope they expand to my area soon.
