RURISQUAD,2vbtvm,philsworth,6,Mon Feb 9 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"Ore no kouhai ga konna ni kawaii wake ga nai  I assume this is the one you are looking for. It starts from light novel volume 5 (equivalent of anime season1 last episode ~ season 1 OVAs) story from Kuroneko's PoV. It does describe Kuroneko's emotions and thoughts much more than the original storyline, so if you love Kuroneko then you should absolutely get it.  The manga is still ongoing (not even halfway to the ending tho), but if you are looking for English translations, you are in bad luck because all English translation teams have stopped translating after volume 11. Manga may either go all the way to light novel volume 12 (equivalent of anime season 2 OVAs), whilst highlighting Kuroneko's side of emotions even more than what was described in the original story (heartripper alert), or it may just not go that far, since the original Oreimo received horrific feedback after its ending."
RURISQUAD,2vbtvm,DJLTheFirst,5,Mon Feb 9 22:31:09 2015 UTC,Thank you for the insight! I kind of hope the manga doesn't go all the way to end haha. It'd be nice to just see Ruri happy if it's all about her. It was painful enough when it want from her perspective.

Usually make a garage kit first and then a completed figure afterwords if the garage kit is popular.  Their quality is a bit hit and miss though.  I don't have any of their garage kits, but I have some older Lucky Star figures from them that are great.  I have 2 newer Ruri figs from them, one is good, and one is meh.    Their figures are mostly good though and usually get an 8-9 overall rating on MFC.  My meh Ruri figure up there has a 5.5 rating, which I guess I can't really disagree with other than I feel really bad saying any figure of Ruri is meh :(  I'd like to think that they haven't started cutting corners due to the Yen being so low, but maybe that's what's going on.    Anyway, if you wait you can probably get a PVC version of this figure at some point.  It could be a great figure, but I would wait for some good release pictures and reviews before getting a Clayz figure at this point :/"

RURISQUAD,2kiczz,Lazuli_Blue,1 point,Tue Oct 28 11:23:45 2014 UTC,"As far as Ruri, I just wanted her to beat Kirino - if she goes farther than that, it's just icing on the cake. Onodera a a good one to win, but I fear most people voting don't care about moe (Awwnime's point of existence) and vote purely on a popularity standpoint. In that respect Ryuko and Nonon stand to do very well.  Edit: Onodera is up against a fire sister, we'll see how it goes."
RURISQUAD,2kiczz,fernando_69,3,Tue Oct 28 11:31:44 2014 UTC,"The only reason why some characters win matches is because of their popularity... Like, why did Sora and Okabe even win a single match? Why are they even in the contest? And then there's characters like Senjougahara that are only cute for 5 minutes in their entire show and get so many votes they could almost win the contest... I don't get these people. Ryuuko is kinda cute so I wouldn't really mind if Ruri lost to her (though she's far from my type)."

I skipped the previous 'introduce yourself' because I didn't think it would be necessary. :P  I play League of Legends, DragonNest, sometimes osu and a huge fan of Pokemon. For League I play in the SEA SG/MY server so if anyone want a game, hit me up!   I picked up anime this year during June, when I was bored as I just reached the Platinum tier in League. So I decided to check out AOT (as everyone and their mother was talking about it). Next I checked out Oreimo and it is the anime brought me to the romcom and slice of life genre and kept me there.  I used to lurk in this subreddit for a while but I've been commenting a bit nowadays. Here's my MAL. Yeah don't mind the stuff that I'm not supposed to watch at my age. I would love it if someone recommend me an anime of MAL! :D And yeah I loved Oreimo but I didn't complain about the S2 ending (I WAS REALLY FUCKING SAD THOUGH) as, come on, the name of the title already tell us the ending. Unfortunately, I'm still a student and I'm piss poor so I can't really buy any Oreimo products (or any anime products) without feeling bad about myself. I'm saving money right now to buy Spice and Wolf life novels. :P   Well I don't know what else to say, so uh, RURI BEST WAIFU!
