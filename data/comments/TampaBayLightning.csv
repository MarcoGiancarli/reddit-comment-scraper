TampaBayLightning,3e0tz5,MoreWeight,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:59 2015 UTC,The history of The Lightning please :p
TampaBayLightning,3e0tz5,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:17 2015 UTC,wikipedia actually gives a nice breakdown of the history. It would be a good intro
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,Mustache-of-Destiny,28,Mon Jul 20 03:17:06 2015 UTC,Chris Dingman??
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,Bolt1023,10,Mon Jul 20 03:23:29 2015 UTC,"I may be in the minority but I'm not in love with Dingman's broadcasting.  I don't hate it and he certainly has the love for the game and the Lightning, but he just bores me to tears.  He is so monotone and it just seems like he is always on quaaludes.  It's like Eeyore calling a game."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,WorkIsBoring,5,Mon Jul 20 13:24:44 2015 UTC,"Dingman replacing Chief would be a goddamn shame. I like Dinger, but we need someone with some passion to replace our beloved homer."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,angelsil,4,Mon Jul 20 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  Not bad, just very ""meh"".  I guess maybe next to Mich that would be a good thing?  But yeah Dingman segments always leave me a little bored."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,Dan78757,3,Mon Jul 20 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this, too."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,TallyTime,4,Mon Jul 20 15:23:21 2015 UTC,"That'd be great. Seeing Dave Andreychuk on camera, he seemed a bit tense and off; and it appeared it was either Andy or Dinger who would be getting the color analyst position. Dingman has some radio broadcast experience and brings a passion that Chief had when calling out bad officiating and bad playing. I think he'd be a great addition on a permanent basis if The Chief does indeed leave for good. I also heard that he'd (Chief) do the home games this season, as the travel is what is wearing him out."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,Harryboltsfan,15,Mon Jul 20 03:54:52 2015 UTC,brings a passion that Chief had when calling out bad officiating and bad playing   no one can rival Chief on this
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,evnted,2,Mon Jul 20 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I think Dinger would get there eventually. Kinda like how the radio broadcaster who would scream, ""YESSIR!!!"" after every lightning goal seemed irreplaceable until Dave Mishkin came on the scene. I don't think they were the same people; this was in the very early days."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,Harryboltsfan,3,Mon Jul 20 05:08:19 2015 UTC,"I spoke with Dinger about it. He honestly had no idea. He didn't even seem to know if he was in the running for it.   That was during the ECF, though, so I'm sure things have progressed."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:43:55 2015 UTC,Does he even want the position? He has two young kids who live in town and I can't imagine he'd want to spend half the winter on the road and potentially miss all the father duties.
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,millionaremattdavis,13,Mon Jul 20 23:44:27 2015 UTC,Charles Barkley.
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,DVDAallday,6,Mon Jul 20 13:19:10 2015 UTC,Don't even put this idea into my head. I can't get over how amazing that would actually be in practice.
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:21 2015 UTC,I'd love for it to be Mish since they use his calls on TV recaps of goals and stuff anyway.
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,Smalz22,8,Mon Jul 20 13:55:40 2015 UTC,Mishkin is perfect for radio. Got the perfect voice and levels of excitability. Hideous as sin to boot. That's basically a radio requirement.
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,SNl9ER,6,Mon Jul 20 14:25:42 2015 UTC,What a beaut
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,2ndprize,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he might be a good fit if he takes a few benzos before each game haha. This guy loses his mind every goal."
TampaBayLightning,3dwkfw,ShmoMoney,5,Mon Jul 20 14:01:05 2015 UTC,Exactly why I love him. Feels like you're watching a game with a guy who's as big or bigger of a fan than you. Me being the type of guy who loves screaming at my TV when my team is playing Mish is just great.

TampaBayLightning,3duwux,mollarirulz,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:59 2015 UTC,Dude on left is Rene Rivera.  They are in the Rays locker room.  Stamko has been in the sun for 3 hours watching baseball. The main message from the story is that Stammer is enjoying the off season and is committed to Tampa Bay.

TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,eroved,17,Sat Jul 18 14:57:38 2015 UTC,Garrison is up there.
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,TampaCub,6,Sat Jul 18 15:05:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. He's definitely one of our key defensemen along with Heddy and Strallsy.
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,2ndprize,3,Sat Jul 18 15:10:36 2015 UTC,That's the best answer in my opinion. He is one of those guys on D who doesn't blow you away with any one thing (other than maybe that big shot) but quietly does good work every night.
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,MrUs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"I would say every aspect of our Defense, aside from Hedman is underrated."
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,16,Sat Jul 18 22:05:53 2015 UTC,Boyle. The man's been plugged in almost every situation imaginable. I'm sure they keep spare goalie gear around for him just in case it comes to that.
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,formerlyme0341,3,Sat Jul 18 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"Aside from the giant clusterfuck leading up to the situation, I always wish for a game where Boyle plays every position"
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:17 2015 UTC,I am genuinely curious as to who the best goaltender on the roster is who isn't naturally trained in the position. I'd be willing to put money on Hedman.
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,3,Sat Jul 18 20:58:29 2015 UTC,I'd say Strallsy. Remember when he saved a puck at the start of the season that went behind Bishop. He saved it with his foot and got it out of the crease.   This one
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,formerlyme0341,2,Sat Jul 18 21:04:26 2015 UTC,Not going to lie. That play still makes me pitch a tent.
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,PaisleyFox,9,Sat Jul 18 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"Brown.  Kid works his ass off, plays great defense and offense,  aaaaand is cursed by the post."
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,PaisleyFox,7,Sat Jul 18 19:59:29 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm a big fan of Hot Paquette, but I think our team has a whole bunch of unsung heroes. It probably comes from having a star player on your roster, but I think most fans of this team who watch a decent amount of games the output the season can see how important guys like Paquette, Brown, Boyle, and the rest can be during the course of a game."
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,TBLightningPlayoff,8,Sat Jul 18 15:09:35 2015 UTC,"Brown used to get a lot of shit from this fanbase for his stone hands but as the season progressed, I think he got better and better and earned more respect. Fucker can wheel too and can throw his body around for how small he is."
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,Squorn,3,Sat Jul 18 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"It's true. When the playoffs started I was kinda like ""JT Brown, really?"" but he really showed why Coop wanted him in the games he got put in. When the rest of the team was dragging during a few choice games, he still had hustle."
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,PSU_Arcite,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:20 2015 UTC,Relentless effort! It's amazing how contagious relentless effort can be in team sports.
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,PSU_Arcite,7,Mon Jul 20 23:12:26 2015 UTC,"As far as someone who has a level of talent and contribution most different from the way he's regarded, I have to go with Matt Carle."
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,PSU_Arcite,6,Sat Jul 18 18:32:35 2015 UTC,upvote for having the balls to support Carle ;) if he got paid less I'd agree with you
TampaBayLightning,3dqo9r,tcigzies,4,Sat Jul 18 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"Dumptruck had a great series against the Hawks, if he continues this uptrend he won't be underrated for long"
TampaBayLightning,3dqhlr,Fleeegz,13,Sat Jul 18 13:43:28 2015 UTC,Stamkos is already under contract for this coming season. His contact is counting toward the cap numbers you're seeing. A new deal he signs would not start counting against the cap until the following season.
TampaBayLightning,3dqhlr,TampaCub,11,Sat Jul 18 13:48:36 2015 UTC,"Be careful when looking at cap sites like that. For example, they all include Ohlund and his hit (because he counts until he's put back on LTIR). Also, those cap projections appear to include more than a typical 23 man roster.  Also, Stamkos' cap hit for the upcoming season is only 7.5. Coburn will be gone after this season and Carle will be traded too (imo). That's almost an extra 10 mil in cap space and RFAs like Koekkoek and DeAngelo will fill the holes.  I suspect Flip goes next followed by Bishop as our young players come off ELCs and those on bridge contracts (TJ, Palat) get big paydays. Most likely we move one of our young guys in a few years. Vasy takes over as our #1 at this point."
TampaBayLightning,3dqhlr,csampson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:28 2015 UTC,No way Flip goes. Too savy and a big catalyst.
TampaBayLightning,3dqhlr,TBLightningPlayoff,2,Mon Jul 20 23:13:59 2015 UTC,In two season he will need to be moved if we're gonna keep our core together. I'd rather he leave as opposed to one of the Triplets.
TampaBayLightning,3dqhlr,csampson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:02 2015 UTC,"Do you know his contract situation?  Edit: looked it up just now. 5 year 25 mil signed in 2013. Don't know specifics but maybe it was a front loaded deal. He will be 34 in 2018, so maybe we can keep him if we are doing well."
TampaBayLightning,3dqhlr,TBLightningPlayoff,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:45 2015 UTC,Sites that have us showing an overage right now have Witko and Namestnikov on our roster. Witko is going back to crunch and who knows about Vladdy but those sites arent considering where people will fall next season.  We're fine right now.
TampaBayLightning,3dqhlr,DanceWithPandas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:35:32 2015 UTC,Moving Carle saves the team 5.5 million. That is in Tampa's best interests. Then they can bring up Koek or Deangelo who will be playing on ELC deals to save money.

TampaBayLightning,3dmtqt,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Sat Jul 18 11:18:22 2015 UTC,"Just a quick question, as a brief Google search only turned up an article from 2014 - have there been any talks about the team converting to the MLS? Do you think the market is large enough? I would love to support a Tampa Bay team if they came to Vancouver to play the Whitecaps!"
TampaBayLightning,3dmtqt,andrewthemexican,2,Sat Jul 18 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"We have new ownership as of last year and as of last month, he's stated that he's happy with the NASL business model, but wants the Rowdies to be able to compete on the field with any MLS team (in events like the US Open Cup).  BUT things are changing so fast in MLS and the NASL, you never know..."
TampaBayLightning,3dmmgt,fromagi,6,Fri Jul 17 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"Every game of Lightning hockey I watch, I thank Vinik for everything that he has done to put a winning team both on and off the ice. I hope I have the pleasure of meeting him someday. Thanks, Jeff."
TampaBayLightning,3dmmgt,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,6,Fri Jul 17 19:10:47 2015 UTC,"I had the pleasure of being one of the Social Media Captains for a game this past season. Afterward, I sent a letter to Mr. Vinik expressing my gratitude. I got a letter back from him, hand-signed on how appreciative he is for the community and the fans.  Seeing him in the Detroit series sitting up in the cheap seats also confirmed that he is a fan of the game, as well as an AMAZING owner. Can't give enough credit to him."
TampaBayLightning,3dmmgt,BoldLookOfColer,4,Fri Jul 17 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"It might have taken me longer than it should, but that's the moment I was sold on the guy.  This coming from a born-and-raised Michigander who misses having my two teams in separate conferences... sort of, hah. Glad to see them play more as a Tampa resident; sad to see one eliminate the other when a cup is on the line."
TampaBayLightning,3dmmgt,The_estimator_is_in,3,Sat Jul 18 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"One game, I happened to be sitting in the row that was directly in front of his box. As I walked back to my seat, he was walking down to his and I found myself looking up about 5 feet to him.   Not realizing that it was his box, I managed to ask ""Vinik?"" at him in, what, in hindsight, was a stupefied tone. He fairly politely said ""yes"" (I probably sounded vaugely confrontational). I was able to croak out a ""Thank you"" in what I'm sure was the least articulate conversation of my life.   So there."

TampaBayLightning,3dn3id,XANAXandDABZ,3,Fri Jul 17 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Last season it was incredibly easy to sell tickets when certain teams came to town, especially lower bowl. I know some people were make over a 150% flip on ticket prices selling Blackhawks/Red Wings tickets for at least 200 a piece. You can easily make a profit and at the very least pay for your season tickets for the current year.   Disclaimer: I do not condone doing this as I think our fans should be in the building every night, but they have stated they are a Sabres fan already."
TampaBayLightning,3dn3id,JeanLouWheezy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:49 2015 UTC,I agree completely if it were up to me every arena would be filled with the local teams fans. Nothing bothered me more than when I was in buffalo and more Toronto fans came to our home games vs them than our own. When I went to game one here in Tampa for the cup I was sad about how many Blackhawks jerseys there were. Luckily the rest of my family has switched to being lightning fans so it'd only be a few of the games where the lowly Sabres fan would occupy the arena haha
TampaBayLightning,3dn3id,armidilo01,2,Fri Jul 17 22:44:50 2015 UTC,"We have more Toronto fans show up for our games too, but our team colors are virtually the same so you have to pay close attention to really tell."

TampaBayLightning,3dn3id,Alycion,2,Sat Jul 18 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"I've been discussing splitting them with my parents for an upcoming season. Even though we enjoy going together, this would be the easiest way to make it work. This season we are just saving to hop around and see where we would want the tickets as well as doing at least one game with club seating for my birthday. It will be a late birthday present but who cares. Most people I know with season tickets either sell off half to recoup the costs or split them with someone."
TampaBayLightning,3diiud,2ndprize,9,Thu Jul 16 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"He also had a cool move in warmups- he would wait until the other team left the ice and shoot the puck end to end into the opposing net. This created a standoff in the '96 playoffs where a philly player refused to leave the ice. Eventually he did, Selivanov put the puck in the net and the crowd exploded."

TampaBayLightning,3d9z0h,Zurmakin,7,Tue Jul 14 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"Some of my favourite moments of Lightning broadcasts are when Dinger calls out Chief on his shit. Rick's reaction is priceless every time.. ""I don't know how to feel!""."

TampaBayLightning,3d9ykt,DustyBazongas,6,Tue Jul 14 17:28:46 2015 UTC,Didn't even know he was injured too. I'm so curious how long the injury list was for the Lightning.
TampaBayLightning,3d9ykt,TIFUByJoiningReddit,3,Wed Jul 15 14:51:41 2015 UTC,Boiler was one of our true unsung heroes this year. The guy was used everywhere and laid it out on the ice every night. Thank Zeus we have him for a few more years to solidify what is very good center depth.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,tcat84,14,Tue Jul 14 03:56:51 2015 UTC,Stamkos is arguably the second best center behind Crosby. He's worth any kind of money. He'll get slightly less money than Kane and Toews due to the lower taxes here in Florida.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,xemnyx,15,Tue Jul 14 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"This is probably a bit of hyperbole and not entirely accurate. I don't think Stamkos's value is found in him being a good center. He's definitely top 10, maybe top 5. Stamkos's value proposition is that he is a scoring threat. Which means he draws top defensemen and draws top defensemen minutes. He's also a perennial 40+ goal scorer and last time I checked, there aren't many of these guys right now. Stamkos is a pure sniper. His two way play is developing, but let's call a spade a spade here people expect to see one time clap bombs from the dot when he's around. What you don't expect is Datsyuk dangles, Crosby foresight/play setup, Toews's quarterbacking abilities, etc. You expect: Big. Nasty. One time. Slapshots.   So to answer OP's question. Is he potentially worth a big contract? Tampa took a big chance on Vinny and got burned pretty good. Vinny's injury played a big role in that and I think there is something to be said about his conditioning and mental fortitude, but our expectation was that we would have a 40 goal scorer for the remainder of the contract given. Stamkos has proven himself to be a very different person from Vinny. While many of us consider Vinny ""The Captain"" Stamkos is wearing that hat better and better as he continues to play. One of the most exciting things about Steve is watching his play style constantly evolve. 3 years ago did anyone think he would take down Marchand or throw massive hits? Furthermore, Yzerman has architected something pretty fantastic around Stamkos. Adding Palat, Johnson, and Kucherov as staple players makes our offensive depth pretty insane. Remember that bit about having to D up on Stamkos because he is a threat? Well now you have your D1 and D2 (or D3/D4) working overtime trying to cover 2 lines of wtf scoring.   The team was built to win championships and the base of that construction is Stamkos. Would you be as successful without him? Probably not. Would another team be more successful with him? Most likely. Is Stamkos worth big time money? Absolutely.   Edit: Clarification: I think you can be a top 5 center in the league without being a top 5 scorer. I believe the two traits aren't necessarily related.   Edit2: Data to back my premise: Stamkos isn't a number 1 or 2 center in the NHL, maybe a top 5, easily in the top 10."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Khue,7,Tue Jul 14 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"our expectation was that we would have a 40 goal scorer for the remainder of the contract given   Vinny was signed until the heat death of the universe, so I don't necessarily think it was expected he'd contribute on ice at that level for the entirety of his contract. His contract reflected his role off the ice as much as on it.  I don't see Yzerman caving to ridiculous demands. If Stamkos wants 12 x 8, I think we let him walk. However, I think the chances of him asking for that are pretty slim. If he does test free agency, I'd be somewhat surprised to see him sign in a media clusterfuck up North. At times he seems a bit overwhelmed by the community outreach side of being the face of the franchise*. That would only get worse playing for the Leafs or Habs, etc.  * I noticed they've been having TyJo and Bishop do more of the public speaking/fan events. Makes sense since both of them seem to be more naturally outgoing and appear to like mingling with the fans. Stammer always seems a bit uncomfortable, in a shy kind of way, when doing events."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,angelsil,2,Tue Jul 14 13:07:51 2015 UTC,"As crazy as it sounds now, giving him 12 x 8 would be okay in the long term assuming the cap keeps going up (duh). Our Canadian dollar is shit right now and our economy is just at a borderline recession thanks to the price of oil dropping. But as is the cyclical nature of the economy, we'll bounce back and once the dollar starts to rise again, the cap will rise.   Look at what is happening in the NBA with players opting out of contracts to re-sign given the cap expectations the next few years. Hockey is getting more popular and the business of the NHL is growing - it isn't unreasonable to expect the cap to follow suit.   I agree though, I don't think he'd ask for 12 x 8...I think 10 x 8 is a great deal myself.   I'm assuming you meant this, but worst case, we trade him next season at the deadline - no way he walks away for nothing. As sacrilegious as some users may take that, this is a business and the Tampa Bay Lightning's success is the priority. Honestly, I think with our depth, we'd be fine even if the world ended and he was traded. That's why I don't really care about speculating that. Again though, he's most likely gonna re-sign this summer.  We better win the cup next season while he has a 7.5 cap hit :).  EDIT: As /u/Khue mentions, expansion is a big deal and that would have a positive impact on the cap. Worst case, when we hit our next lockout, we dump the next bad contract too :P."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,csampson,3,Tue Jul 14 16:34:14 2015 UTC,Cap gets a healthy boost as well if Las Vegas and Quebec happen.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Khue,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Good point, didn't even touch on expansion. That is a huge deal."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,csampson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"Vegas, yes, and Seattle probably, but the canadian dollar isn't helping anything cap-wise."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:57 2015 UTC,Doesn't have anything to do with what teams get expanded where. Additional teams means cap comes up as there's more aggregate revenue. I believe cap goes up 2.1 million for each expansion team.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Khue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the reason the nhlpa elected to use its 5% increase of the cap for this coming season was the fact that it was going to stay basically flat, which most people involved were saying was due to the Canadian dollar doing so poorly against usd,right? So it stands to reason that more usd incoming would be more likely to raise the cap than would more Canadian dollars, no? Even if there is a greater total revenue, the larger it is, the more the cap stands to gain."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,fuckyouabunch,2,Tue Jul 14 21:48:44 2015 UTC,"The salary cap you are talking about is a calculated value used to compensate for economic disparities and is meant to level the playing field across the league. 5% bump was used, as you indicated, hold everything ""flat."" This isn't a one time only thing though, this is done year after year. If you look at the NHL salary cap history, it's steadily been increasing to offset inflation and to take into account economic growth and stability of the league (insert footnote for 11-12 season, which I believe is due to relocation of the Thrashers to Winnipeg).   This brings me to my point... if 2 more teams expand into the league the likely outcome will be an increase of salary cap to around the 80 million ball park. My original statement was meant to kind of play off the fact that if the Lightning did wait to renew Stamkos, they may try to push it closer to the time when expanding the salary cap would seem imminent due to the growth of the league, thereby giving them the ability to hold the current roster, sacrifice big contracts that are shitty (see expansion player protection; lookin' at that Carle contract) , and still pay the players that need to be paid.  Expanding the salary cap by 6-10 million around the league wouldn't be a fiscal calculation to balance player salaries, it would be a requirement by the laws of the league. This is a mutually exclusive requirement, not an economic correction stimulus."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Khue,3,Tue Jul 14 22:28:55 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. No way do we let him walk. If he hasn't signed by early 2016, I expect a trade in the works."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,angelsil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:08 2015 UTC,Vinny Lecavalier's contract was so long that I will be teaching my child to drive when we stop paying on his buyout.  Considering my child is barely potty trained that is pretty crazy.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he isn't great, but do you really think a guy who was not a point a game during the season and 5th on his team in playoff goals and tied for 3rd in playoff points should get money head and shoulders above the rest of the team? He seemed like he was having issues making plays in the finals especially, when you need your best players to shine."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,xemnyx,9,Tue Jul 14 04:16:11 2015 UTC,"Stamkos is a sniper. He needs a dedicated playmaker by his side. He didn't really have that last season. And yet, he posted 2nd in goal scoring. Stamkos isn't a player that makes plays. He's on the receiving end."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,sleepdepriveddev,2,Tue Jul 14 05:32:46 2015 UTC,Surprised he was never converted to wing. A true #1 center should be an equal threat or lean a little more towards playmaking. He just seems a little one sided to be making 9.5+ mil a year. Most players making 8+ are multi-dimentional players who if they lack in one area make up for in another.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,2,Tue Jul 14 11:50:25 2015 UTC,He did play wing during the playoffs for what it's worth
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Knox-Overstreet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:37:01 2015 UTC,He can make plays.  Just look at what he did for Callahan's numbers.  He doesn't seem like much of a playmaker because his linemates are either grinder style forwards or Filps who never saw a shot he wouldn't rather pass on.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Knox-Overstreet,2,Wed Jul 15 01:25:43 2015 UTC,"Of the top 10 scorers in the league, only 3 had more than 82 points, Seguin had 77 points in 71 games, you're putting too much stock in to points."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Knox-Overstreet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:31:17 2015 UTC,I think his playoff performance this past year was the biggest issue.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Knox-Overstreet,4,Tue Jul 14 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"Playoff performance or playoff production? I have absolutely zero problem with Stamkos, his play, or the effort put forth through the playoffs. He showed up every game, he led by example, and he put the top D pair of every team we played to the test. I'm having a lunch beer, so I'm on mobile, but someone in thread said part of his super power is he draws the top D pair so the triplets have an easier time. I love Killer and Cally and actually everyone else on the team, but since the traitor jumped ship we haven't supplied the primer goal scoring center in the world with a playmaker. He played the entire season with two grinders, cut my captain some slack, homes."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,0,Tue Jul 14 21:12:59 2015 UTC,In the finals I watched him try to enter the zone and lose it a handful of times.   I'm not saying he isn't a great player. Just not the kind of player that you hang your team on. I'd say any more than 8.5 AAV and he's overpaid. But  he will get more and we all know it
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,ClintEastwood41,2,Tue Jul 14 21:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm unclear, are you saying that towes is worth $10.5m and Stamkos is worth $8.5m?"
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,xemnyx,0,Tue Jul 14 22:16:34 2015 UTC,I dont think Toews is worth 10.5 but I do think he is worth more than Stamkos. I think Stamkos is more of a 7 mil kinda player. Toews is a complete player and proven he knows what it takes to win. Stamkos is a goal scorer primarily and hasn't rounded out his game yet.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,ClintEastwood41,5,Wed Jul 15 00:10:16 2015 UTC,I dont think Toews is worth 10.5 but I do think he is worth more than Stamkos     Conversation over. In no world is toews even on the same plane as Stamkos. You need to stick to the canucks sub dude.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,xemnyx,0,Wed Jul 15 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"I was just kinda curious in what Lightning fans thought of him. I thought he was better than he was, but after watching this year's playoffs I realized he isn't that top 5 player that he is perceived to be. If you think Stamkos is a better overall player than Toews than you need to get your head out of the clouds (pun intended)"

TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Knox-Overstreet,0,Fri Jul 17 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"That's solely based on team performance. We're talking about individual performance. Just because someone has more cups than another player, does it mean they're the better player? What about Carcillo?"
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,BurnerenruB,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:16:47 2015 UTC,Still think Toews is a better leader than Crosby

TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:35:26 2015 UTC,You have yet to give a reason for Crosby?  Why does a stupid mustache and getting injured every year make him the # 1 guy?
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,SNl9ER,3,Fri Jul 17 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"I would love to re-sign Stammer, but I would love to re-sign Hedman, Kucherov, Killorn, Palat, and Johnson in the coming years more. We don't NEED to be the highest scoring team in the league.   We also have so much talent to come up through the ranks that if a different team wanted to give Stamkos a shload of cash, I wouldn't have a huge problem with it. It beats signing him for too long at too high of a price and then getting cap raped."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Knox-Overstreet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:20:08 2015 UTC,I was thinking what if they offered him for McDavid at the draft or go get Mackinnon plus something else.  They could get a premium player and I doubt those teams would say no.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,angelsil,2,Tue Jul 14 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"For Mackinnon? Stamkos? I wouldn't trade Johnson straight up for Mackinnon, Sakic needs to sweeten the pot."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,3,Wed Jul 15 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"Hes worth whatever he asks. We have a young team that has had what...three captains in seasons? We don't need to make it 4. I'm not saying hand him a blank check, but pay the man he is worth it."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,SNl9ER,3,Tue Jul 14 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"This year I think there were two major factors into why he didn't have the same goal numbers we saw from him in years past.  Number one is ""the traitor"" or ""the hobbit"" no longer giving stammer sick feeds for easy goals which I would say he would have gotten an easy 5-10 more goals just because the guy was on the team. Hate him or love him number 26 put the puck where it was needed to let guys score and him and stammer had great chemistry on pp and pk.  Number 2 that fucking number 2 line was crushing it. He had 2nd most goals in the league even with a 2nd line that was at a lot of points during the year arguably the best line on the team. Teams were still focusing number 1 defense against him with that line producing all of the time. I think next year that will actually help Stamkos the most because teams will focus more on those guys and he'll have weaker defenseman on him allowing for more goal opportunities.  And the last thing isn't a reason he struggled but more a point about where Stammer is at right now. This was his first official full season as a captain for the team. He got 2nd in goals, lead the team to the finals, and did a lot of great things on and off the ice. Sure he didn't produce as well as we would have hoped in the playoffs but i'll give it to him as an off playoff year. The fact is he isn't really that old and he's handling a lot of responsibility as his age and I think he is doing it very well. He is also the face of the organization to a lot of markets so he is definitely worth it to keep him around just for that aspect. Is he worth some ridiculous number? no but he is worth a solid 9.5-11 million. Also if we don't sign him by end of the summer I highly doubt he makes it to free agency with this team. He'll be traded for anything and everything we can get for him rather than just letting him walk."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,6,Wed Jul 15 05:50:45 2015 UTC,He is worth a ton of money.  He is worth more than the Toews Kane Contract if he wants to push it.  Say he wants 11 AAV.  Would we let him go over 500k? No.  Stamkos is the face of this franchise.  The ownership has dumped a fortune into promoting the team with his face. He is worth a ton on the ice and about as much off of it.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,SNl9ER,0,Tue Jul 14 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"I love stammer but what makes you so certain he's worth more than them? Is it his 4 times captaining Stanley cup championships? Is it because he comes up huge when the pressure is on? Like the first 8 games or last 8 games of the playoffs? Is it because he's won Selkes or Conn Smythes? Maybe because he's an elite playmaker? Because I don't recall any of that being true. He's a top 2 goal scorer in the world, yes, but as of now that's all he is. If that's worth more than everything I listed then fuck me, give the man the max contract."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,5,Tue Jul 14 13:08:30 2015 UTC,"All of your logic based on who won Cups and trophies is a bit of fallacy. Kris Draper won 4 Cups and a Selke, but I'm sure no one will show up to defend him if I say toews is a better player than Draper."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,angelsil,2,Tue Jul 14 17:58:15 2015 UTC,"I love stammer but what makes you so certain he's worth more than them?   I think the issue here is more that both Kane and Toews took less than market value rather than Stamkos not being worth more than them.    He's a top 2 goal scorer in the world, yes, but as of now that's all he is.   That's why he'll get a crazy contract. No, he doesn't have 3 rings like Kane or Toews but it's also not like he was surrounded with a contending team for most of his time in Tampa. If he doesn't sign with us, there will be a line of teams next Summer ready to roll up a Brink's truck full of money for him."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,2ndprize,3,Tue Jul 14 16:16:07 2015 UTC,"I don't want to pay Stamkos so much we cant keep our other players, but the reality is that he is one of the truly elite players in this league.  As such he can get paid more than almost anyone in the league.  He might get paid 12 million on the open market.  It is just the nature of the business.  I hope he takes less than 10.5 but both he and the Lightning know he doesn't have to.  That is all there is to it."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Aethir300,-3,Tue Jul 14 14:27:04 2015 UTC,Solid argument. You addressed nothing I mentioned. No shit people get paid whatever they want in free agency. Look at Matt Carle. Just because you can get something doesn't mean you deserve it.
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,SNl9ER,3,Tue Jul 14 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"I wasn't having an argument with you buckaroo. I am just saying he is getting paid because the market dictates he is getting paid. Same with Carle, but hopefully with way better results."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,Aethir300,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"I asked why were certain he's worth more than Toews and Kane. You've proven you have no ground to stand on. I was hoping for a debate. Argument was poor phrasing. This isn't free agency. Until it is, it is irrelevant."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,csampson,5,Tue Jul 14 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"Kane makes a fairly favorable comparable for Stamkos.  Kane plays a less valuable position on the ice, and is a year older.  He is smaller, and has had an off ice criminal episode as well as repeated incidents of publicly appearing intoxicated.  He has 70 less goals in 80 more games played (he does have more points).  Stamkos is the Captain of the team, whereas Kane has no letter or known leadership responsibilities. He does have a Conn Smythe and two Cups at the time he was given the contract.  Though he also has had a much better team for the majority of his career. Stamkos has out scored Kane in all but two seasons, their rookie year and last season while he was hurt (stamkos did only finish 4 goals behind Kane in over 30 less games.  Stamkos is a better offensive player than Kane and handles significantly more defensive responsibility.    Toews makes for a bad comparison because they are very different players.  Stamkos is better offensively,  Toews is better Defensively.  Toews is known for his leadership, and Stamkos has been Captain for less than 100 games.  Their appeals are a bit different as Stamkos is a sniper and Toews is a two way guy.    But to your point about free agency, it is always relevant. Pretending it isn't is just silly."

TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,DustyBazongas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure why the downvotes, because you are definitely right. Luckily he isn't a UFA so we don't need to worry as much about the market influences. It comes down to the subjective concept of value as a player in the NHL. It's a deadly game for Yzerman to sit down and list off all the reasons (like the ones you mentioned) as to why Stamkos shouldn't make as much as player X.   Luckily, Stamkos has time and really isn't even in his prime yet. TB has supplied him with the team and talent required to win it all. But the ball is just as much in his court to justify why he should be paid more than JT/PK when comparing pedigrees (should Stammer ask for that much)."
TampaBayLightning,3d7og6,MrUs,2,Tue Jul 14 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"Wasn't he injured partly during the first few series of the playoffs? Also, as captain I'm sure scoring isn't his only responsibility."

TampaBayLightning,3cv7i2,PSU_Arcite,11,Sat Jul 11 01:23:14 2015 UTC,I'm definitely happy about it but the big difference between us and other teams is that we're not having to deal with the cap issue at the moment. Next year or next couple years things might be different. But for now I'm definitely glad that we can keep all the players that got us to the SCF and I'm sure they'll do it again.
TampaBayLightning,3cv7i2,TheJDK,6,Sat Jul 11 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"We only got better. Every player got playoffs experience, Drouin should be a lot better next season, and Condra > Morrow. Teams like Boston and Toronto got even worse, the only way Montreal will be just as good is if Price has another record breaking season, which probably wont happen. Buffalo still sucks, Ottawa made no real moves in the offseason. The only teams that really improved themselves in our division is us and Florida, I feel pretty confident in getting a cup or at least a presidents trophy."

Correct me if I have the size wrong, been a while). In Canada last year, they have barely had anyone show up for early games.

TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,Knightro2011,7,Thu Jul 9 11:40:35 2015 UTC,"The not a distraction part is comforting.  After all the shit I read about him for that thing yesterday I feel like Stamkos has one main concern in life and it is hockey.  It would be wrong to say he doesn't care about money, but I think he is aware of the type of money he is going to easily get so he isn't worried about it."
TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,2ndprize,4,Thu Jul 9 13:10:07 2015 UTC,I also heard him say on the video of him at the rays practice that he's up in Toronto at home for like 6 weeks after the season ended. They'll probably start when he comes back down.
TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,Aethir300,4,Thu Jul 9 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"Nah. He's gonna stay up there and it'll probably get done then.  The season like just ended. He needs some time to meet with his agent(s) and figure out what they want to do, relax, get healed. No reason to rush into contract negotiations yet, his head is still probably not quite where he knows it needs to be for something this monumental. Definitely don't want to start negotiating big-ass new contracts while the sting of losing the cup is anywhere near as fresh as it has to be right now.  edit: I commented without reading the article and I realize now that I basically regurgitated the whole thing at you. Whoops!"
TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,ClassicMach,3,Thu Jul 9 15:53:39 2015 UTC,All good man. But that's basically what I was saying too. He's at home and it won't get started until he gets back was my point
TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,Aethir300,3,Thu Jul 9 16:08:00 2015 UTC,His agent was on the radio this morning and said they would be meeting with Stammer to talk contract parameters in a bit and then the agency would get together with Yzerman. Yzerman is just waiting on that part.
TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,2ndprize,3,Thu Jul 9 16:31:58 2015 UTC,I'm going to be terrified until his pen hits the paper.
TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,riotide,2,Thu Jul 9 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"This is my perspective on it. I honestly don't see why Stamkos would take a severe paycut and be placed on a shitty team and abandon everything he has worked towards just to 'play at home'. I live near Toronto, if you think the abuse Kessel got was bad, imagine Stamkos. This past season for him in Toronto would be atrocious, the status quo for him would be 60+ goal seasons EVERY season, the media would absolutely beat him up. That's just my opinion though."
TampaBayLightning,3cnzqr,TampaFresh,3,Thu Jul 9 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"If Stamkos cares about the Lightning and the city of Tampa, he will re-sign here. Yzerman will find the money to do it, no matter the cost. If he decides to go somewhere else, it would be a purely personal decision on his part and we will have to live with that as a fan base. Thankfully, we have a ridiculous amount of depth on our roster and though the loss would be monumental, it would be manageable. Either way, I believe a contract is signed before the end of August."

TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,thatline,6,Wed Jul 8 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time figuring out how we are going to manage to keep the triplets and Hedman if we pay Stamkos what he is worth.  Vasi and Drouin come up too. Most of them are RFAs, but how can it work?"
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,2ndprize,13,Wed Jul 8 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"Short answer: it can't (see Chicago's 2010 team). You can try to keep the core assets and make your prospects develop around them, and then trade the prospects once theyre developed for nice returns (undeveloped prospects, cheap, effective depth).     The triplets realize what they're worth, for sure, but also will be smart enough to recognize what they're worth as a unit. They'll understand that in order to maximize their effectiveness, they'll have to stay together; this means that they'd be open to a pay cut, I think.    As for Drouin, unless he completely steps up his game, I can see him getting a bridge deal for relatively cheap. This will likely make things easier until Matt Carle and even Filppula's contracts are up. I could see Garrison or Coburn leaving as well to make room for DeAngelo and Koekkoek.    I think we should be ok for a while as long as Stevie Y works his magic. To be completely honest, I think our biggest detractor is Callahan's contract. Sure he's a good ""intangibles"" player, but isn't really worth his ~6m contract, IMO.    Edit: added Filppula to a contract that may come off the books."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,TIFUByJoiningReddit,3,Wed Jul 8 14:19:57 2015 UTC,"I did some rough math in a previous post and it kind of worked out for next season:   Trade Carle (with some retained salary).  Trade Filppula (shouldn't have to retain salary he's performed up to his salary)   ~$11M in cap space from those two players + $3.5M cap space we have + $1.6M freed from Gagner's final buyout season = $16.1M (plus cap increases).  Stamkos for $11M ($3.5M increase), Killorn for $4.5M ($2M increase), Kucherov for $6M ($5M increase), Brown for $1.25M ($0.30M increase), Pacquette for $1.5M ($0.5M increase), Coburn for $4.5M ($0.5M increase) = $13.75M  Coburn is an optional re-sign; if we do keep him that leaves $2.35M in cap space next season but realistically we'll probably lose him after next season which would free up ~$4M in cap space giving us $14.35M to sign Johnson, Palat, and Drouin.  TL;DR - It's a tricky situation but not impossible."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,7,Wed Jul 8 14:50:25 2015 UTC,You forgot that we can drop Bish and Cally to clear up massive cap space.   Plus Hedman will command a large chunk of change which you left off.
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,ninjafaces,2,Wed Jul 8 14:58:58 2015 UTC,But then NBC would have less to talk about if we drop bish.

TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,2ndprize,3,Wed Jul 8 19:46:14 2015 UTC,I see no reason to resign Coburn. One of the kids will be ready for that spot. But moving those other 2 will be difficult especially filps with his no movement clause.
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,TIFUByJoiningReddit,4,Wed Jul 8 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"Filps seems like the kind of guy who would waive his clause to go to a good team, especially if he gets stuck on the third line this entire season."

TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:55 2015 UTC,Coburn is on the last year of his deal. So he isn't causing us any cap trouble.  I would be shocked if we keep him though.  I want that 5.5 mil from Carle off the books.  Getting rid of Carle basically guarantees we get told hold onto one more of the Stamkos Hedman triplets group. Getting rid of Cally of Filps buys another.
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, didn't mean to imply that I wanted to keep Carle. Just that I wanted Coburn gone, too."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,2ndprize,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"You probably dont. Carle, Flip, and Cally would have to be shown the door. I have purposed that keeping stamkos may not be the best thing for the team long term. Palat, Johnson, and Kuch were all better players this year (Hedman too), and paying your 5th best play 11 million doesnt make a ton of sense. I normally get shit on for it, but it is a very real problem."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,5,Wed Jul 8 14:57:23 2015 UTC,I don't know that I consider him 5th on that group but it is a conundrum. He is only a year older than everyone you listed except Kuch. I prefer the filps cally Carle removal but that's 2 no movements and one no trade.
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,2ndprize,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:05:31 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be a dick, but this year, where would you rank him? The three forwards I listed played an excellent two way game all year. Stamkos was routinely cold for 10 games at a time this year and had more games than not that he was invisible. Yeah, I know he scored 43, but he alway was like plus 1 one the year (some people dont like this stat, for this case, I think it is very appropriate).   And, then you have Hedman, who may become the best player on this team (also had a wonderful year).  In my mind, all four of these guys were more important/better this year."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,5,Wed Jul 8 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"It is an odd thing, because the triplets are really amazing as a group.  I don't know where they would be apart.  I know Palat really thrives with Johnson, and was having a rough go on line 1.  Kuch I actually wouldn't mind seeing spend some time with Stamkos because I think his talent is better than he gets credit for.  Stamkos ended up with so many linemates, but it was pretty rare he got to skate with another play maker.  I like how Cally and Killer play the game, but they paired two of the worst passers on the team with a guy who trives on quick shots off the onetimer.  They really need Drouin to step up so there is another puck carrier on the team.  I counted a number of times this season that other teams just keyed on him and harrassed him till he coughed up the puck becasue the other two couldnt get open.  I agree that Hedman is probably the most essential piece of personnel on the team.    Stamkos will get the money though because he has so much value to the franchise.  They have invested so much in marketing him, and with good reason.  He is the most valuable asset here, and not all of it is from how he plays."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,ClassicMach,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your last bit about stamkos. You have a nice, well spoken, squeaky clean canadian kid who you have invested 5 years in marketing. He is your guy from a public standpoint. If there wouldnt be a huge public shitstorm from him leaving, I would not be surprised if Stevie did it.   You also mentioned stamkos needing a playmaker. This is another issue of mine. Not necessarily with Stamkos himself, but with fans. Yes, he is a great goalscorer, but he is nowhere near the level of the top guys in this league. He does NOT drive play. His stick handling and passing are awful. He needs to be the guy with the puck on his stick for 1/10th a second at a time. That is when he is the best. He and marty were so great because marty would get him the puck. This year, Stamkos was trying to make his own space, which he doesnt do well. He has to have a playmaker on his line.  I think Coopers system isnt the best for him either. He used to score on the rush and then standing 2 feet in front of the net (seriously, go watch his 60 goal season highlight, half are from within 5 feet). He isnt getting as many chances on the rush because the aforementioned lack of playmaker, but also because we are a cycle heavy team. Stamkos does NOT cycle well. Its like because he could score at will growing up, he never had to learn the cycle. He looks lost when we are set up for cycling.  He played with Cally and Killer a lot this year, which, had stamkos been able to cycle, would have turned out better."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,3,Thu Jul 9 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"Palat, Johnson, and Kuch were all better players this year (Hedman too), and paying your 5th best play 11 million doesnt make a ton of sense.   blinks  blinks again  Umm."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,ClassicMach,2,Wed Jul 8 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you were watching this year. Stamkos was invisible for large stretches of time all year. Literally had games where he would coast for 20 minutes. Anyone who watched knows he had a bad year. And yes, before someone yells ""But but 43 goals!!!"" Yes, I know. The guy scores with his eyes closed. But, on the highest scoring team in the league he was a plus 1 (I think). Sometime plus/minus is a bad stat, not in this case.   Johnson, Kuch, Palat, Hedman, and Stralman were all more important to this team this year. Anyone who didnt have their Stamkos blinders on can see that."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"No I mean I agree he had a pretty tough season. Lots of things just pointed to this being his worst season since he was a rookie. Hot shot youngsters chewing up some ice time, he never really got over that broken leg last season, trying to find someone to replace one of the best setup men in the league over the past few years. It was tough. He didn't do that well.  But he still got 43 goals. Is this a new Steven Stamkos forever, or was this an outlying year because he got just about everything you could imagine piled on him in one go? I'm tempted to believe the latter, because we have heaps more evidence that he's a shoo-in 50 goal scorer than a putzy 40 something guy.  And plus/minus is always stupid. It never has any value whatsoever."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,ClassicMach,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:01:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, we dont have a ton of evidence either way. We know he has done it in the past, but he is past the peak age for prime goal scorers. They naturally slow down after 24.   And plus minus is always stupid? Fucking lol. Come on man."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:20:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm... literally the best goal scorer in his age bracket literally his entire life, or a fairly pedestrian 43 goals in 2015. You're right man. This is some kind of stumper.  And yes. +/- is always dumb. You can't just decide to like it when it fits the narrative you're trying to push."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,ClassicMach,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:28:19 2015 UTC,"Thats my point! The guys scores goals, but does nothing else well. Doesnt win faceoffs, doesnt pass, doesnt play defense. Guys who score goals are wonderful, I LOVE guys who score goals. What I do not love, is paying them like they are the best player in the world. His one trick is great, I admit that, but it doesnt deserve that kind of money. Great goal scorers should be complimentary players, not your backbone. Look at teams who play a one trick pony that kind of money (Tor-Kessel, Wash- Ovechkin), they dont win championships. We have already had one albatross contract in Vinny, I dont want to do it again. Anything 9 or under I am probably fine with. Anything above is too much.   And, yes you can pick and choose with plus minus. If you are on the worst team in the league, its not going to be a good show of a specific players defensive ability. Makes plenty of sense, right? However, for players on average and above teams, its a fine stat. Especially for the highest scoring team in the league, its a fine stat. Look at Stamkos' +2 and JT Brown's -2. Does that mean Stamkos is better defensively than JT Brown? Absolutely not. Stamkos was on the ice for a ton of goals for us this year, but it just so happens that it only totaled two more than our opponent scored. On the other hand, JT Brown was out there for a total of 8 lightning goals for, so a negative 2 against tough starts isnt too bad. Leaves some scoring to be desired, but not too bad for playing a shutdown role.  (Brown wasnt actually out there for 8 lightning goals, I just made up a number).  With any critical thinking skills whatsoever, it is a good stats. You literally have to have the bare minimal ability to analyze."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,MoreWeight,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"its a bad stat.  and everything else in hockey is about scoring goals so if he can just cut right to the chase i dont see the problem.   he's a positive possession guy who scores 43 and makes everyone go ""meh"" about it.  and it is always bad. always always always. we have much more nuanced and refined stats that measure what +/- was supposed to symbolize with a hell of a lot more precision. it might sometimes be ""accurate"" but it is a dumb stat and you can't just decide ""its good this time.""  and i might just be a big fat dummy but im pretty sure ovechkin and kessel are not and have never been the problem on their teams. but thats just one mans take."
TampaBayLightning,3cjuvv,ImtheStaggers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:56:39 2015 UTC,"Ovechkin has certainly been a problem in the past, but thats another topic. Their contracts are the problem. As I said, goal scorers are great! Paying them like they are the backbone of your team is not, not sure how many ways I can say it. I would love to keep stamkos, but it has to come at the right cost. He is not worth 12 million, like some people seem to think. I think there are at least two people more important to this teams success (Hedman/Johnson), and I dont want to pay my third most imprtant guy 10 million.  We will disagree on plus/minus. I will continue to insist that anyone with a brain should be able to see it for its worth and you will continue to insist it is crap.   And for the record, I can cherry pick advanced stats that show stamkos is a one trick pony."
TampaBayLightning,3ck7j3,KING522,11,Wed Jul 8 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"This is such a what if game though. The Lightning management in 2009 was bizarre. They might have flipped all those guys for not being NHL ready. They might have destroyed Price. They probably draft Duchene instead of Hedman because of that.  It could have worked out, but it also might not have. Even assuming they did work out we wouldn't have the cap space for it now. Plus I would have cried like a little girl. No one needs to see that."
TampaBayLightning,3ck7j3,2ndprize,7,Wed Jul 8 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. Those OK guys were too unpredictable, Price would be selling used cars in Latvia by now if they had got their hands on him."
TampaBayLightning,3ck7j3,Knox-Overstreet,7,Wed Jul 8 16:47:54 2015 UTC,"I imagine they would have been eager to show that the deal wasn't bad, and they would have forced all three of them into the lineup.  Also that would have left Stamkos as the top center and the next best center on the team would have been...... wait for it.......... Jeff........ fucking......Halpern.  When your four starting centers are Stamkos, Halpern, Thompson, and Konopka you arent winning many games"
TampaBayLightning,3ck7j3,2ndprize,2,Wed Jul 8 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"They weren't winning many games at that point anyway. Worst case, they would have had  better draft pick to get an improvement over Brett Connolly. Or worst case, they actually do well and we never hire Steve Yzerman."
TampaBayLightning,3ck7j3,OblongIgloo,2,Wed Jul 8 20:55:37 2015 UTC,That was the same year that Sather claims he had a done deal with Len Barrie to trade for Stamkos before the other owner shoot it down.

TampaBayLightning,3chd7m,Knox-Overstreet,2,Wed Jul 8 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"As an avid NHL gamer, I know someone over in the EA NHL subreddit found out a bunch of the team from the series was pulled over to the FIFA series late to make sure it launched, as it's a bigger money maker. It's also insane how it felt like none of the devs watched Tampa at all this season. We played in the Times Forum all year and even in online versus and OTP (on nex gen) had Ohlund starting at LD over Sustr (Sustr was higher rated too).  I love FIFA as well and because NHL was such a piss off this season, I've been playing, and really enjoying, Pro Clubs on FIFA.   Hopefully, EASHL is the exact same as Pro Clubs. They can copy all the player building, leveling up, everything. FIFA gets it right. Sure there are some really annoying game play mechanics I deal with as a center back; not locking onto headers, losing possession at 6-foot-2 to a 5-foot-8 striker, losing headers to shorter players that lead to goals, having atrocious passing stats.   But it feels good to play and it's butter smooth 95-percent of the time. The entire EA way is really frustrating. They focus so much around Ultimate Team, on every game, that it's killing the other modes. There hasn't been a great GM mode feature released in what feels like years. Shit, it feels like the offline modes have gotten worse since the Ultimate Team style of gameplay even came out. I understand it's a money maker for them and of course, as a business, they're going to focus on that. But of all the sports games available, and I own almost all of them, the only one who gets it all right seems to be NBA 2K.   Sure, they have an Ultimate Team feature, but it's not really the focal point of the game. They give away special players on twitter a lot and that's something EA hasn't done at all IIRC. GM mode is great in 2K and the MyPlayer is insanely fun. Even MLB: The Show gets most of this right, sure they didn't really add a lot this season other than Ultimate Team but the other game modes are always just amazing, but really need some innovation -- especially Road To The Show."

As a result, CBS, NBCm and ABC all wee there talking about the first woman goaltender ever to play in an NHL game......  Terry Crisp hated that Manon was on the team. So did my brother Tony, which may have been the only time they agreed on anything. Even Wayne Cashman hated it.  Cash would give me the evil eye. I'd say to him. ""we're doing it. That's it.""......  I wanted to playe her becasue there was nothing to lose and everything to gain... Was it innovative? Some people thought so.   Others thought it was crazy. I knew we weren't going to win so my idea was to promote the team in any way I could to put people in the seats.....  ""Terry, you are going to play her, I said. ""and were going to publicize it.""  also of note is the coach for the Blues told his team to shoot 5-hole on Rheume during the game."

The score was apparently 2-2 when she left the game. Some sources say she made 5 saves some say 7 some say 9 (another one said 5 goals on 20 shots which is certainly wrong).  I think the official story is 2 goals on 7 shots.

TampaBayLightning,3cdu87,Clone95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:03:10 2015 UTC,I don't know. I know the coaching staff didn't want to play her at all so maybe playing her for a period was a compromise. I know Espo brought in a ton of minor players and college guys and league cast offs desperately trying to find players so maybe they need to look at some others.

At the time it felt like the Lightning were finally starting to head the right way. I think many of us were so desperate for some big-name talent that we were willing to overlook just about anything to get it. To an expansion team, the draft just doesn't seem like it will ever yield effective players. Trades seem like the only way anything happens, and as we've all seen before, that often means not-so-great trades. But Dino was good for us while he was here. He helped build hockey's popularity here by simply being entertaining. I think it was you I was talking with recently about how much Dino hated Patrick Roy. He'd butt-end him any time the play moved back up-ice. I never found out the reason for that, and these days I wouldn't enjoy it, but as a pretty new fan, Dino was pure excitement.  Thanks for another good one. And as a very minor criticism, you should just commit to your ice pun and not explain it. You made it, own it. ;)"

TampaBayLightning,3cejye,OlympicHockey,9,Tue Jul 7 08:14:48 2015 UTC,"I don't feel much concern yet. I think I would have some by opening night but not much till January.   I speculate that it isn't finished because of a lack of concern. As in most of the details are done and it's just a matter of getting together.   I heard the other day that Stamkos basically showed up at Gary Roberts door the day he left Tampa and he is so hell bent on getting in better shape that Roberts had to tell him to calm down and relax.   I can see this going on until camp when he would say something like ""oh yeah it's no big deal I just have been too busy to get around to it"".

He may choose to Lebron it up and go win cups elsewhere.   Additionally, I am very sure he is aware of the situation that happened when St. Louis left. If Stamkos left to Toronto, I would imagine it would besmirch his name here just like Marty did. I don't think Stamkos is of the same character as Marty... at least I want to believe that he's different."
TampaBayLightning,3cejye,coop72,0,Tue Jul 7 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"They would be different situations. Stamkos would be leaving as a UFA as is his right instead of St.Louis forcing his way out mid contract. Also, the adulation from up North would drown out any silly hate directed his way.  All that said, that's not what I'm interested in. It would be silly for you guys to be concerned now I'm just wondering at what point would you begin to become concerned?"
TampaBayLightning,3cejye,ClintEastwood41,4,Tue Jul 7 14:22:48 2015 UTC,The day Stammer signs with Toronto is the day I go crawling back to my ex. If you were unfortunate enough to know her you'd know I'm not even remotely nor will I be.

I don't necessarily disagree - you guys definitely have the most potential of anyone right now to be the next Blackhawks but it's really, really, really hard to do what they've done.  It's not about if he's leaving though. I'd rather avoid going down that path. I'm just curious if there's a time when you'd become concerned. It sounds like you won't be concerned even if he waits until the end of the 2015-2016 season to sign an extension."

TampaBayLightning,3cejye,angelsil,-1,Tue Jul 7 14:31:40 2015 UTC,Definitely makes sense. You guys are in the absolute best position one could be in roster wise.
TampaBayLightning,3cejye,Squeaky_Is_Evil,3,Tue Jul 7 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"Not for a long time. Stamkos signing for five years was a message to Steve saying, ""show me"". Yzerman's done just that by building a winning team that came two wins away from a cup. It's going to get done."
TampaBayLightning,3cejye,Squeaky_Is_Evil,3,Tue Jul 7 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"As a Leafs fan, do you really think Stammer is going to sign in Toronto? He wants to win now, and he's on the best team to do that. One he is the captain of and drafted by. Plus we can pay him. Considering money is not an issue, I do not see any advantages in Toronto's favor. Logically, he will stay in Tampa.  To answer your question, never. Worse case he somehow pulls a 180 and demands to be moved at the deadline...we're still an elite team + the haul he would bring in."
TampaBayLightning,3cejye,2ndprize,-10,Tue Jul 7 13:07:25 2015 UTC,I think it all depends on what's important to Stammer. If he wants to compete for a cup the most amount of years possible on a good young team he will stay with TB. If he wants to shoot for the stars and be a Leaf then the draw of trying to bring a cup in Toronto can be extremely powerful. To a lot of people/players winning 1 cup in Toronto and Montreal > winning 2/3 cups in markets like TB.  I don't know what he wants and history tells me that a lot of players would rather stay than come home. It takes a certain kind of person to forgo what Stamkos would have to and to a lesser extent what Babcock did in exchange for chasing legendary status. I simply don't know if Stamkos is that kind of guy.   Essentially it all boils down to risk vs reward in terms of legacy.    Be a great player on a very good team that competes consistently in a good market. vs Be a great player for a franchise that's struggled and potentially become a God/Legend by getting in on the ground floor of an attempt to win a cup in hockey's mecca.  It's a personality thing. I don't his personality that well. He could follow the trend (since at least Gretzky) and not come or he could be the exception.
TampaBayLightning,3cejye,Squeaky_Is_Evil,8,Tue Jul 7 13:30:40 2015 UTC,To a lot of people/players winning 1 cup in Toronto and Montreal winning 2/3 cups in markets like TB.   People? Maybe... but are you seriously going to tell me more players rather have 1 Cup in a more popular market than 2 or 3 in a smaller market? That's just fucking stupid.

IF Vinny wins his cup in MTL/TOR his legacy is different than what it is now. He chose what he chose and was a good player for 8-10 years and won a cup.

The Knicks winning 1 would be more important to a New York superstar than winning 2/3 in Toronto. It's not out of place, it's a reality that you don't like hearing but a reality nonetheless.   All players want to play for there team. It's why Lebron went back to Cleveland. It's why 'Melo went to NY. It's why Suter, Parise and Vanek went to Minnesota. You just had experience with St.Louis forcing himself to NY because that's where he calls home now. Toronto calls to its own in the same way, however, due to the obvious pressures and past failings it will take a special kinda person to be the first to make the leap even in the modern era.

They way they talk about your players is shameful and embarrassing, I expect better from a city that calls itself the ""hockey mecca.""  Another big factor is the on ice product. I'll try to be nice about it, but the only thing you have that's worth talking about is Babcock. You tried to tank for the draft lottery and you can't even do that right, picked 4th. Speaking of picking 4th, you traded one of the best goal scoring wingers in the world, you will be significantly worse next season, you should be out of the basement for at least 3 seasons and that's only if no one fucks it up. Does that sound like a place a player entering the prime of his career wants to be? You talk about how winning 1 up there is worth 3 down here, slow down buddy, you still need to make the playoffs someday. You've made the playoffs once in the last 9 years, and the one time you went it went so horrifically bad that it was worse than the 8 years you missed it entirely. This is who no one outside Toronto takes Leafs fans seriously, have something to brag about before you start running your trap.    Also, Vanek is a bad example. He's Austrian, and your claim of him ""going home"" to Minnesota illustrates that home isn't necessarily where you were born."

It takes a certain kind of person to forgo what Stamkos would have to and to a lesser extent what Babcock did in exchange for chasing legendary status. I simply don't know if Stamkos is that kind of guy.   He isn't. Stamkos is very shy and likes his anonymity. Here he can walk his dogs at the park and go out for dinner with very little hassle. Sure, he might get the random fan asking for a photo, but it's nothing like he experiences when he's home for the Summer in Toronto. Not to mention he's lived here since he was barely 18 and it is home now.  He's got a good balance in Tampa on a very successful team with the freedom to live his personal life in peace.

If fans want to post insightful comments about St. Louis then I'm all about that, but if fans just want to complain or support him without substance then you're right, they shouldn't post.   I'm not sure if everything that could be said about St. Louis has been said, he was with our organization for a long time. Regardless of how fans feel I feel like this has been a safe place to voice their concerns or frustrations even if I don't agree with them.

TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Squeaky_Is_Evil,8,Thu Jul 2 18:27:03 2015 UTC,I have stated this before on Twitter and no one believed me. And to be honest it's slightly hear say. But here it goes....Marty is basically owned by his wife. His wife demanded they moved to New York that year instead of playing it out in Tampa and waiting for his contract to end (in which his deal with wife was to retire and move up north at that point). Granted the Olympic tiff with yzerman definitely set things off with Marty to make him actually  demand the trade.   I'm sure Marty could get decent money to play somewhere. But I'm also certain Marty was given strict orders by mrs that it needed to be in a very right geographical area.   Source: my wife works with someone who was good friends with Marty's wife (their kids went to the same school and hung out together).

But he also has done a lot for the team as a whole during his time with us. It's sad he's basically being pushed out. I got over the bitterness pretty quick, myself.

It was my neck on the line, but I didn't have the freedom to run things the way I wanted. When I told my boss, ""they accepted my resignation"" then sued me for $1/4 million for breech of contract (I was under contract for 2 years. I had worked for the same company for 7 years not under contract already.)  The project folded about 4 months after ""advisor"" was put in charge and I had to declare bankruptcy.

But even before the force out, I was looking outside of the market for a new gig.   Some people can leave. Some people can't and have experiences like you. But when you are in the public eye, it becomes much more difficult.   I was pretty bitter at first, I'll admit. I even understand why so much bitterness still exists.

More guys are doing it now, but it is still a pretty big accomplishment. Here are the right wings in the hall of fame. Look at their stats and then compare their statistics to Marty's. His production is right in there with theirs. Not to mention he was an elite level player for over a decade, despite spending the prime of his career on shitty teams.   Story also counts when getting into the hall of fame. He is the oldest guy to lead the league in scoring, the greatest undrafted player of all time and he was the biggest player in building Tampa into a hockey city. He was the underdog who made it.

The list of winners contains quite a few guys who are in, sure, but none are questionable if you remove their Byng wins. Frankly that trophy would mean more if it had some quantifiable measure. ""Player adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability"" doesn't mean a whole lot. Some people have talked about it being a measure for clean hitting, in terms of nominees who get looked at for having a high number of hits with very few penalties, which makes a bit more sense. But other trophies carry much greater weight because they are either quantifiable (Art Ross), or meaningful (Hart)."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,fuckyouabunch,3,Thu Jul 2 19:45:21 2015 UTC,I think so. He was a fantastic player right up until the end when his age started to catch up to him. Why don't you think he will?

For asking a question and engaging in conversation?"
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,stamkos4life,2,Fri Jul 3 05:04:51 2015 UTC,"That's a difficult thing to measure. He's certainly up there. If we look at it purely from a statistical standpoint I think it's hard to argue that he could very well be the best player to have been a part of this team, at this time. If we look at their contribution to the team and the numbers, he would be in company along with Vinny. Stamkos will most likely surpass a great many of Marty's records and TyJo has done so in the playoffs already. Hedman should be considered in the future too, as he could easily become one of the best defensive forces to ever wear a Bolts sweater. Marty was great, but with the way this organization is being structured it's not too unreasonable to say that we are going to see a lot of extremely high caliber players come through here in the near future."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,OGHamToast,4,Fri Jul 3 06:42:14 2015 UTC,A pillar that wanted out. A pillar that had no respect for what a city that loved him. A pillar that still trashes the city.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,jakemark13,18,Fri Jul 3 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Jeez, more negativity in here than I thought there'd be.  I really hope we see #26 hoisted into the rafters in a few years. He deserves it."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,TheMMApodcast,6,Thu Jul 2 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some of our base needs to get over it. Yeah, he didn't exactly leave in a way that was awesome....but are we forgetting his time here? Even Cleveland fans are over how Lebron left for Miami."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,TheCenterOfEnnui,8,Thu Jul 2 21:12:18 2015 UTC,Lebron also left in the off season as a free agent. St. Louis pouted in the middle of a season of something that had nothing to do with the team itself.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,scisorkick,0,Thu Jul 2 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"He didn't really pout even when speculation of him leaving started going around, he played his best hockey such as the four goal game against San Jose.  Imo Stamkos should of never been on the Olympic roster because of the predicted time of healing was longer than the time until the Olympics."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Brittle_Bones_Bishop,2,Fri Jul 3 05:23:38 2015 UTC,Lebron didn't know better at the time. He was 25 and had idiots around him telling him to announce his choice on ESPN.   St. Louis was a grown ass man.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending how he left, but I'm not gonna throw out years of great memories over one thing, at least not in the long term."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Thu Jul 2 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"Nor should you, but I don't think Lebron is a fair comparaison."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,millionaremattdavis,-1,Thu Jul 2 21:53:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. When it comes down to it he gave the franchise so much and is one of if not the best player in the franchise's history. I wish people would get over it, especially when it comes down to it, I think it's safe to say we got the better end of the deal."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,TB_Dark,-10,Fri Jul 3 01:59:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, really ungrateful fans here that are letting a minor dispute tarnish a HoF career. Sad."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,stamkos4life,9,Thu Jul 2 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"Minor dispute? He pretty much said ""fuck y'all, I can't stand Yzerman anymore so peace"" in the middle of the playoff push. On top of all that, he demanded to be traded to 1 team. That took away any leverage Yzerman had to benefit the team.     He could have played his heart out one last time for the guys on the team, for the fans. But nah. He couldn't stand the GM - a guy he doesn't even see daily if he wanted to avoid him.  So please, tell me why Bolts fans should still be singing his praises like before.  I'm not saying MSL is a terrible person, but to say that Bolts fans are being salty over nothing is a stretch."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,6,Thu Jul 2 20:12:23 2015 UTC,Invading Rangers fan here. The leverage being taken away didn't seem to impact the price you guys got out of us. Two firsts and an impactful player? Not to mention I'm sure Callahan had a bit to do with you guys landing Stralman and Boyle.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Jk186861,9,Thu Jul 2 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"In hindsight, the trade worked out great for us. But that day really hurt me when he left. He was a fan favorite, and just gave us a big middle finger. I still kind of wish he would have stayed and retired a bolt. We probably would have kept paying him till he couldn't play anymore, and his retirement would have been a much bigger deal (I assume).   But I'm glad I can finally enjoy watching Hank play again. I really like the Rangers, really respectable players. But I couldn't bring myself to root for MSL or any team he was on."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,RabbitFeet25,2,Thu Jul 2 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"Well he's only human. Can you honesty look at your job and say you'd want to be there 10+ years? Yeah, it didn't end in the best of terms but I think the TB org also seemed interested in moving forward without him.   I really hope that, one day, TB fans and Marty can bury the hatchet. Watch him score in the OT of game 6 against Calgary and tell me you don't feel some nostalgia there. I'm not even a TB fan and I remember, even being young, still enjoying that series"
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Jk186861,3,Thu Jul 2 22:25:14 2015 UTC,That's more Sather's poor decision versus Yzerman forcing his hand.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,3,Thu Jul 2 21:23:50 2015 UTC,Eh I don't think it was the worst decision ever. He was critical in our run to the finals and we were 1 game away from going back. Doesn't always work out but we gave up a guy we couldn't sign anyway and two picks that we had to figure would be 28th at best for a guy who could have a big impact. Didn't work out but oh well   I think both sides got fair value and it was the right move for both teams.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Jk186861,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"If Sather/Gorton had negotiated correctly, that deal would've been extremely lopsided. Poor job done by them. (I say Gorton because I believe he's been major part of decision making for at least a few years now)  Like the other person who replied, btw, I'm looking forward to being able to like the Rangers again. I like pretty much everyone on the team."

Which is okay, I'm very happy with our fanbase (especially recently)."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,FapperzDelight,3,Fri Jul 3 02:57:51 2015 UTC,"Flames fan here. I can totally understand your bitterness and anger to MSL but do you all generally at least hope relationships will be mended in the future? After all, he was instrumental in landing y'all your first cup(Against us of all teams, still hurts, but still one of the greatest series I've ever seen) and is probably the most accomplished player within your franchise history, to the point where it will still take even Stamkos a while to achieve the same resume. I honestly believe he's already looking back and realizing that he left the team in a very shitty way and has regrets about how he handled it."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,feeltheillinoiseboys,2,Thu Jul 2 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"There's just not a way for the relationship to ever be totally mended. Look at this thread. It's a microcosm. You have people who fucking hate him now, people who still love him, others who don't hate him but don't want anything to do with him anymore and so on. What could possibly soothe all those people? There isn't even a consensus on what the problem with him is for those who have one."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"I'm also a Packers fan so this feels really familiar right now.  I expect the healing will happen and down the line things will be better, but for now I'm still pissed/excited. Just how it is now.  Talk to me in 2018 and I'm sure I'll have a totally different perspective, but for now, I don't feel bad still being upset."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,ClassicMach,4,Fri Jul 3 02:00:37 2015 UTC,Ok bye
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,millionaremattdavis,5,Thu Jul 2 21:23:20 2015 UTC,"The fact he's releasing this news through NYR PR and retiring in a NYR jersey is a pretty big ""FU"" to the Bolts organization (and fans in a way).   edit: seems like Bolts released the same statement and I just didn't see it earlier. Retiring as a NYR point still valid point."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,2,Thu Jul 2 17:42:58 2015 UTC,Bye Felicia
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Prince_Pyro,3,Fri Jul 3 01:16:11 2015 UTC,What an embarassing end to an otherwise strong career. I guess the gold metal isn't a bad consolation prize. That said he may as well have been the 3rd goalie in that tournament. Almost no ice time. Whatever. I hope someone wears 26 next year just to rub some salt in the wound.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,biclighterburns,2,Thu Jul 2 18:49:22 2015 UTC,Wouldn't even sign a 1-day contract with Bolts to retire with the team he won his only cup with and played most of his career with.  Asshole.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Knightro2011,26,Thu Jul 2 17:40:18 2015 UTC,Why do you think he even had that opportunity? I seriously doubt he did.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,fuckyouabunch,13,Thu Jul 2 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"If he hadn't been a complete douchenozzle, maybe. Bridges weren't just burned, they were nuked from orbit."

TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Knox-Overstreet,2,Thu Jul 2 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"Seeing the Bolts PR released the same statement as NYR did, he clearly could have signed a 1 day contract if he wanted to."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,5,Thu Jul 2 17:52:25 2015 UTC,PR is not management. It doesn't mean that was an option.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"Letting a player retire in a jersey is ALL PR. It's not like he even has to skate with the team one last time for that.    You seriously think that management would say no if he asked? Hell management would probably view it as a ""win"" on their part seeing MSL was coming back to ask them for the favour."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,9,Thu Jul 2 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying the guy running twitter has no input on it whatsoever. I dunno if management would have considered it. He was pretty insulting to management and the team after he left. I can't imagine they would really want to, but maybe they would consider. I think it's better that they didn't, though. He is literally the only divisive player in our history. Every time his name comes up people who are all on the same side, the Lightning's side, all fight with each other. To me, that's why he's unforgivable. He divided the fans. I don't hate him, I don't boo him, but I don't think he'll ever belong here again, in any capacity."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,fuckyouabunch,11,Thu Jul 2 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"You get it. Completely. Every time I see the Marty defenders come around I think to myself that they're missing the point. Forgiven or not, loved or hated, this guy has single-handedly divided the fan base and forever tarnished his legacy with this team in doing so. Never again will Martin St. Louis be able to be mentioned without people remembering what he did, whether they remember by saying they forgive, saying they hate him, or arguing with one of the two sides."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,OGHamToast,5,Thu Jul 2 18:59:45 2015 UTC,"It's every thread, and every conversation. FFS, I just had a plumber at my house when the news came in, and he started to go off on the guy before reining himself in. i'm a stranger, and a customer (not that I was about to complain or anything), but his reaction was visceral. That's what it's like when you've been betrayed. Some people move on, some people hate forever. But no one comes out the other side unscathed. For all his accomplishments, the biggest scar left on the fans of this organization wasn't left by the Saw guys, it was left by marty."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,fuckyouabunch,0,Thu Jul 2 19:08:01 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree with this more.    You can't say ""never again will Marty be mentioned without people remembering what he did"".  When I hear his name, I think about two moments.    1) Game 6.  Any Bolt fan knows what I'm talking about.  2) When he got cut on his face and walked around with stitches holding his face together.  Sure, the ending sucked.  I think you could easily blame Steve Y as much as Marty.  That's my opinion, but let's not pretend Marty didn't have a legit reason to be a little hurt.  Any Canadian player would be hurt to be left out of their last chance to win a gold medal.  Hell, winning a gold medal means more to these guys than winning the Cup.  It's why the NHL steps aside to let them play for their country.  All during the playoffs people kept talking about what classy fans we were on reddit.  Well that's great that we were so nice to the Det fans and Chi fans, but let's keep it going by keeping it positive for the greatest player to ever lace up skates for the Tampa Bay Lightning.  We absolutely would never have won the Cup without him.  I for one look forward to the day we retire his number.  No other player deserves it more."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Dan78757,3,Thu Jul 2 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"whether they remember by saying they forgive, saying they hate him, or arguing with one of the two sides.   How is what you commented not doing exactly this?"
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,OGHamToast,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:43:16 2015 UTC,In what universe is Yzerman in any way to blame?  Having a reason to be hurt is one thing.  Demanding a trade to one team only in the middle of a playoff push is quite another.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Tampabear,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"Without re hashing the entire thing you do remember who left St Louis off Team Canada, right?  I won't argue weather he was right or wrong, I'm just saying I can understand why MSL26 was angry."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Dan78757,2,Sat Jul 4 13:46:31 2015 UTC,"The guy running twitter gets his orders from the PR bosses. PR bosses wouldn't ok this statement unless Vinnick & Co ok it.    I get what you're saying about not wanting him to retire in a Bolts jersey but for a lot of fans, he was the face of the Bolts for the last decade or so. For him to nuke bridges like he did and then decide to call it a day in another jersey sucks for those fans."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,4,Thu Jul 2 18:10:13 2015 UTC,It shouldn't come as a surprise though.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Hey_Wayne,3,Thu Jul 2 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I thought he'd retire a Bolt after 1 or 2 more seasons playingwith other (non NYR) teams. The wound wouldn't be so fresh by then. I didn't expect him to hang it up this quickly."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,3,Thu Jul 2 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"You're right, that would've been view as more acceptable.  Personally, I have no interest in anything around the Lightning honoring him.  He doesn't like us and he doesn't like our fans."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Hey_Wayne,2,Thu Jul 2 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'd be offered the chance to sign a 1 day contract and retire, no. It's too fresh and people are still too torn. We just played him in the ECF a few weeks back.   I do believe they'll eventually honor him with a number retirement/statue, but it will be years down the road and only if he publicly makes a peace offering. He's kinda been a dick to current managment."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,angelsil,7,Thu Jul 2 18:10:45 2015 UTC,I'd be really upset if they put a statue of him anywhere near downtown Tampa.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Hey_Wayne,4,Thu Jul 2 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"I'll be upset, too. I think it's likely at some point down the road, though. Really depends on if they honor Vinny first. Which they should."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,angelsil,3,Thu Jul 2 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will do anything honoring St. Louis unless it involved honoring another player, such as Vinny, along with him.  Don't forget they highlight real they showed for St. Louis after his first game against us.  It included nothing but great plays between him and other players, nothing by himself.  I have a hunch the TBL management isn't so much of a fan of the guy."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Hey_Wayne,2,Thu Jul 2 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'd be offered but I think if he asked, the team would do it."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,-5,Thu Jul 2 18:21:23 2015 UTC,I'd have given up my season tix and watched from home from then on if that happened.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,SNl9ER,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:49:17 2015 UTC,Why do you guys not like MSL? Seems like he had a huge history with Tampa and I'm not really sure what happened in the falling out with you guys.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,ermahgerd_bewbz,11,Thu Jul 2 19:08:30 2015 UTC,Hall of Fame player Hall of Shame captain.  He quit on the team because he was upset about not making the Olympics.  Then he took a bunch of jabs at us after he left.  It wasn't pretty.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,2ndprize,6,Thu Jul 2 19:18:23 2015 UTC,"This. I don't care if the Olympic snub was the straw that broke the camel's back. He quit on a team that looked at him as their leader in the middle of their first playoff push in a while. It's not like the GM is  somebody the players interact with daily either. He couldn't continue sucking it up and leave during the summer? On top of all this, the Olympic spot being the straw is a clear ego problem. Great ""leadership"""
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,BetterCallStral,3,Thu Jul 2 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, figured it was something along those lines. Just seems uncharacteristic of him but then again he only played for us for such a short period of time."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,ermahgerd_bewbz,8,Thu Jul 2 19:23:42 2015 UTC,it seemed uncharacteristic as fuck to us.  That's why it hit everyone so hard.  He was this super well respected athlete and then this rumor comes out that he demanded a trade.  None of us believe it but then when he gets interviewed he gives some obtuse answer about how he has discussed his future with Yzerman.  It was especially crazy because the team was playing so well when this happened.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,2ndprize,7,Thu Jul 2 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"Because he continues to throw shade at our city and fanbase, even after he got exactly what he wanted."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,angelsil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:25:19 2015 UTC,Its fitting that the team who gave him an NHL career and a Stanley cup was the last team he played professional hockey against.
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,Brittle_Bones_Bishop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:12:06 2015 UTC,"This was my post on facebook last night regarding this.  At the end of a great career, MSL is retiring. He was a power house who had a bad falling out with Tampa. I respect him as a player and a person, because in my few times meeting him he was a humble and awesome guy to talk to. I hope one day his number can be retired in Tampa, because he deserves the hell out of it. If it weren't for him, Vinny, and a couple others, we never would have been able to build the Stanley Cup winning team that we had in 2004. Some of my greatest memories at games come from watching Marty.  Congrats on a great career Marty!"
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,sarnald,0,Fri Jul 3 10:52:25 2015 UTC,"It was either play for a north east team close to his family or retire. Not surprised at all. Hope us Tampa fans can start really forgiving him now and see his number retired soon. He does deserve it, but only if he embraces the community again in some way IMO."
TampaBayLightning,3bw7ou,emotoaster,3,Thu Jul 2 19:00:05 2015 UTC,He would need to extend an olive branch.  Even then I don't care if it happens.
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,Fleeegz,9,Thu Jul 2 21:05:13 2015 UTC,Don't know but it's good to see ppl remembering and honoring MSL26 for the years and years of good times as opposed to some fans who would burn him at the stake.
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,Dan78757,8,Thu Jul 2 22:22:27 2015 UTC,"So the thing that always gets me about this, about everything with Marty is summed up well in your comment. Nothing else has ever turned lightning fans against each other. If you had stopped at  ""good times,"" it would have said everything about how you feel about Marty, right?   And that's fine. That's good. There is nothing wrong with feeling that way about it. I admire it.   But after that, it's other fans burning him at the stake. You're not wrong. I'm not in either camp, frankly. But it pisses me off how he split us all up. Before Marty demanded a trade, we all had the Lightning. We still do, but now there's a black mark on it, and it sets some of us apart from others.   I'll always love the good Marty did when he was here. And it certainly doesn't taint our Cup to me. But over and over and over again, it comes down to the fact that one side of the fan base split from the other, and it's all about Marty. I don't think he's evil, or manipulative, or that he planned it this way, but that's what's happened. It's like a bad breakup, and no one's sure whose friends are whose now. I think we'll all remember the good times, some of the time. But past that, there's no one mind on it."
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,fuckyouabunch,6,Fri Jul 3 01:55:59 2015 UTC,I'm squarely in the pro-Marty camp. I feel like anyone against him wasn't watching game 6 of the '04 cup final when he scored the biggest goal in franchise history or has a bad memory and is being completely unreasonable.   But I think this proves your point.  Its a pretty meta criticism to call out the rift itself instead of Marty directly.
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,fuckyouabunch,2,Fri Jul 3 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"I do have a bad memory, I am pretty unreasonable, I don't hate Marty, and you're a good sport, and a good fan.  I think the only times I've cheered louder than at that goal were fedotenko's two in game 7, and possibly TYJO's 1.1 second goal, although some of that one was me being smug to a few shitty Habs fans sitting near me at the game. But that goal was truly something else. I don't have bad memories of Marty. It's more like my best friend is breaking up with my relative, and everybody has to sort out whose side their on, or how to navigate both."
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,fuckyouabunch,3,Fri Jul 3 03:19:45 2015 UTC,Best friend breaking up with a relative is a good analogy. Hopefully over time he can repair the rift and get the bronze statute he deserves next to Espo and Anderchuck (and Vinny and Richie).
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,TSTMWKU,2,Fri Jul 3 03:51:25 2015 UTC,I just hope we can all get through thanksgiving without killing each other ;)
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,angelsil,2,Fri Jul 3 03:55:33 2015 UTC,"I remember the entire cup run very well. Including game 6. And your comment seems very similar to the ""you disagree so you're not a real fan"" posts we saw a few times recently.   2004 was an awesome year. The only time in my life where a favorite professional sports team won the big trophy. I loved St Louis.   But regardless of Game 6 and all he did, he left the team when the team needed him, handcuffed our GM to only trade with the Rangers, and made snide remarks about the city and fans after he left. Regardless of 2004, i can't forgive him for the way he treated his loyal fans of 14 years when he left."
TampaBayLightning,3bwzog,sarnald,2,Fri Jul 3 12:42:04 2015 UTC,"You are a great fan, and obviously anyone can disagree with Marty's actions and still be a great fan. My post was merely meant to express my own opinion and my agreement with u/fuckyouabunch 's commentary on the whole situation. I don't think it's bad to disagree. It happens and its o.k. Just because the thread is divided into two camps doesn't mean we can't all support and love this current team, and respect every person here because everyone here is clearly a passionate fan.   Sports are a distraction from day to day life and there are a million ways to experience them. Sometimes on a slow offseason day when nothing else is happening, I don't mind revisiting how everyone feels about the Marty situation. There's nothing wrong with that and clearly other people on the thread are interested in doing that as well. I fail to understand what the need is for censoring the Marty debate."

I was a fan before Marty. I am a fan after Marty. I am a Lightning fan first and foremost, but he was my favorite player for a decade. However, the manner in which he left was unprofessional and his comments since leaving have made it clear the love and respect he was shown by this city and his fans was not reciprocated.   You don't get to insult the fanbase and the city and stay a hero. That's not how it works. If disliking him for his poor behavior makes me unreasonable, so be it."

Like here, barely 6 months ago.   ""Yeah, this is definitely the place I want to play,"" St. Louis said. ""There's no doubt.""   or here, 3 months ago   “There’s no doubt that I want to play next year. Period. And for sure, yes, I want to play here. I want to finish my career as a Ranger. There’s no doubt about that either.”   MSL wanted to retire a Ranger. He got his wish. Likely earlier than he wanted, but that's the risk he took leaving a team where he was the leader and team legend and going to a team where he was just another guy on the payroll.  Until he publicly states something otherwise, people need to wise the fuck up and realize he doesn't want to come back to Tampa. Not for a 1 day retirement contract. Not for a front office job. Not to play. I know this is painful to accept, but Marty just isn't that into us."

Yes, he was a huge part of this team for a very long time, but he also walked away from it (while holding its leadership position, no less).  In his own words, he wanted to ""retire as a Ranger"". I don't see why he would want to come back, nor why we should want him to."

TampaBayLightning,3c2ixd,rayogata,7,Sat Jul 4 05:00:19 2015 UTC,"Do you really not see the difference? Roy acted like a child, but he felt like the coach was purposely trying to embarrass him by leaving him in net to get shelled by the Red Wings.    Player selection for team canada wasn't a one man job, they left it up to a committee including Yzerman and Babcock. The speculation is that Babcock is the one who wanted to leave MSL off the team. The Olympics are cool and fun and all that, but it's just a tournament. It's absurd for a grown man to let some personal problem effect his job. Especially when he loves to think of himself as some sort of a leader.    Roy got purposely hung out to dry, MSL didn't get his way in regards to a matter not related to the NHL or his team. He cries his way in to a trade, makes some bullshit statement about how no one is more loyal to Tampa Bay than he is, then he goes to NY and talks about how it's nice to play in front of real fans.     Nope, fuck him right in the ear."

TampaBayLightning,3bvcfv,jpfdeuce,6,Thu Jul 2 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"This makes me feel a lot better. During our playoff run, we would have long stretches where we would allow the opposing team to constantly pound our net, whether it was on the PP or not. I think this guy is capable of at least partially remedying this, and I am happy to call him a Bolt for the next three years. Plus, coming out of FA and Ottawa apparently refusing the same deal he offered them, I can see him playing harder than he would for the Sens because he is now playing on a team built to win a fucking Cup. Can't wait to see him play on the ice.   EDIT: Fuck, I just thought of this; what if he is on the same line as Drouin? If this guy is able to push the puck into the offensive zone and create opportunities against defensemen, and clean up mistakes in the defensive zone, he should be able to maximize Drouin's strengths. The article said he makes everyone else play better, but I think this is where he could be the most effective."

I feel like a Condra-Paq-Drouin line would be very dangerous. Then with maybe the Triplets staying together, then a line with maybe Killorn-Stammer-??? would be amazing, then hopefully Brown's time in the playoffs gave him tons of confidence and he makes our 4th line also unstoppable.   Fuck, I don't know why this Condra guy just made everything better."
TampaBayLightning,3bvcfv,GeneralChaz9,3,Thu Jul 2 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"It's things like a player's ability to improve the play of his teammates, or at least to increase the amount of time that they possess the puck, that really stick out about some guys. The comparison to the Stralman pickup is apt: these are guys who make others around them better. I'm really looking forward to seeing this come together here on the ice. And even though our PK was effective, I think Condra might be able to help us reduce the SOG during the PK, and that might result in a few more SHG. Hopefully, anyway.  I like the pickup. I love the deal."

I'm not saying Condra is going to be as good as Stralsy, but this was one of the best if not the best acquisition of the day. That's an incredibly low cost for a sneaky-good player.  I love being a fan of this team, because most of the deals we do are sneaky savvy like this. It's how the Lightning got to where we are now out of the depths of OK Hockey, and it's why a guy like Stammer will re-sign with us rather than walk."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,chimichanga9,7,Wed Jul 1 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"This is a change that could give Condra a lot of juice, too. Getting signed by a serious contender gets a player's work ethic up a lot of the time, and while I don't see him as a 20 goal scorer he could really pop a spark into our bottom 6."

I like it a lot.   Edit: So it turns out he is a winger, and a not a D man. I'm going to leave this here because I thought I was so fucking smart and it's pretty hilarious. Still a good signing."

TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,fuckyouabunch,2,Wed Jul 1 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of an engineered use of the sal cap.

TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,Robert_The_Tire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:12:53 2015 UTC,The young guys that are ready don't fit into the 4th line role. Drouin spent most of his season down there and it didn't seem to help him very much.
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,fuckyouabunch,8,Sat Jul 4 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"I don't get this. ""Deserve"" doesn't enter into it. You earn a roster spot. Cooper knows this guy and knows how he plays. What guy in our system that plays like him (two-way, excellent defense, reliably high possession numbers) could step in and immediately be productive in this type of role?   The draft showed us that Yzerman (at least) believes we need more grit (toughness, ""jam,"" ""truculence,"" ""arriving in an ill manner""), since basically everyone we drafted but the goalie is known for it. If that's lacking, Morrow is gone, this guy has it and is cheap, then who deserves to fill the role more than  him?"
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,Robert_The_Tire,-4,Wed Jul 1 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"We already have Brown, Paquette and Boyle who play bottom 6 two way productive game and callahan, Stamkos and occasionally Filpula can all play two way games. Cooper obviously likes this guy more than a player, if he really was an usher at his weeding, and got him such as a personal more than a hockey thing. No sense bringing him in just to have an extra guy watching from the team Booth every night."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,MoreWeight,4,Wed Jul 1 20:35:55 2015 UTC,Go read what yzerman says about him. It's not a personal thing. And none of those guys is someone who's being held out of a roster spot for this move. Still not sure what you're getting at.  EDIT: Here
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,showers_with_grandpa,-2,Wed Jul 1 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"It was a personal hing for Cooper. He is friends with Cooper. Of course Yzerman isn't going to come out and say ""he's friends with Cooper so we signed him."", but that's what happened. Yzerman is going to say good things about the guy he just signed he would be a dumbass if he didn't. Go watch what Ottawa's gm said about the signing. He straight up says that thenrelationship with ""Tampas coach"" was huge. Cooper said get him and Yzerman got him."

And if you're right about the relationship with Coop, so what? Why would it be a bad thing? They loved the guy in Ottawa, and around the league seemingly everyone is looking at this as a savvy move by Tampa to gain a good player for a good price. I don't get what your beef is. You said it was taking a spot from someone who deserves it, and then named a bunch of guys who have roster spots (btw, no one thinks of Stamkos as a 2way player, not when he can't PK, and especially since no one wants their star sniper to be playing D)."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,fuckyouabunch,5,Wed Jul 1 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"""Stamkos and occasionally Filpula can play two way games.""  In what world is stamkos better on D than Filpula?"
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,MoreWeight,-1,Thu Jul 2 00:22:05 2015 UTC,"And if ""deserve"" doesn't fit than kids who have more than proven themselves elite AHL scorers and played well in their short NHL stints have earned the right to more ice time at this level.

TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,fuckyouabunch,5,Wed Jul 1 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"Well, he's a step up over Brown in terms of scoring. Not a big step, mind you. Maybe a shuffle.  But another big problem in the playoffs was the PK, remember? And that's his specialty."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,Robert_The_Tire,5,Wed Jul 1 21:03:26 2015 UTC,"The guy you are responding to has no clue about Condra. Dude will be perfect for our 4th line. Great possession numbers, elite pk, and a puck hound. Great signing."

TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,Robert_The_Tire,2,Thu Jul 2 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"Our pk was 9th in the regular season (83%) and 8th of 16 (82.4%) in the playoffs. If you remove the teams that didn't make it through the first round and therefor have an incredibly small sample size that inflates their pk numbers, Tampa was 3rd out of 8. The PK wasn't an issue.   edit: Also, Condra averaged 4 more minutes a game then Brown. In fact his average time on ice per game is only 30 seconds shy of Kucherov's average."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,showers_with_grandpa,0,Wed Jul 1 21:21:01 2015 UTC,"The pk was absolutely an issue. Against Chicago. Any way you slice it, he's an upgrade on the pk. And still you haven't said a player we have who can step up into this same role. There's literally no one not on the roster already who should be killing penalties, right?   I get that you don't like the deal, and I'm sorry people have downvoted you for it, because it's good discussion. But pretty much everyone in hockey likes this deal but you. And your problem seems to be that you think guys won't get playing time because of it. But young guys move up and down all the time. They're going to play. Maybe not here all the time, but some. And either way, I genuinely believe that the coaching staff and management of an nhl team (any besides maybe Boston) knows more about this than you or me."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,Cats_and_hedgehogs,2,Wed Jul 1 21:51:35 2015 UTC,It's not a bad deal. 3 years for a solid penalty killer grinder who isn't completely snake bitten it the offensive zone is a VERY good deal. My original comment was all about trying to get someone else in the lineup. I get it we are replacing Morrow with an upgraded/younger guy. Win-win. But everyone on here was bitching about Drouin not getting enough playing time and Names needs to be up next year too. This is just another spot on our already cramped forward roster. I can imagine he will do some healthy scratching this year.   Edit: Chicago scored two power play goals all series. It was not an issue.
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,showers_with_grandpa,3,Wed Jul 1 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"I think the more important issue there is not wanting to cripple our AHL team, which is exactly what stealing kids like Names and Drouin and Erne away from them will do. I honestly don't believe Names or Drouin are ready for 83 games in the NHL, and that one more year or so of keeping these kids itching for a roster spot does a couple very nice things for our salary cap and player retention over the next 5-6 years. Kuch will want money, Johnson will want more, and Palat will be hungry for pay also, we are going have to let some of these guys go because it is just not possible while holding onto a player like Stamkos, who's contract is going to make all our brains explode.  If these kids come up now and perform up to their contract, or outperform it, they are gonna want money sooner than later also. The Yzerplan is about creating a perennial contender, and not just a flash in the pan for a few years. Hockey players should try and get the highest contract available, and if we give these kids a taste for what they could have, who's to say they don't tell the Lightning to fuck off and leave us with our dicks in our hand on the outside looking in.     Just my 2 cents, for the record I love Paquette and Brown and thought their lack of ice time in the Final was a big reason for our lack of offense."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,MoreWeight,2,Thu Jul 2 03:46:12 2015 UTC,"Also Drouin is a player that shines when he can be the star on the ice. Unfortunately, he is not quite at that level to be that against nhl players, but in the ahl I think he'll do wonders next year."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,fitzgerald1337,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:40:37 2015 UTC,"Drouin's play will never translate to the show, he isn't fast enough or tricky enough with his moves. Just like Brian Campbell's little spin around move he use to do, people figured that shit out and started leveling him. If Drouin wants to play like he does in the NHL he is either going to have to get a LOT better, or a lot more invisible. I don't see either happening."
TampaBayLightning,3bs45a,doctorlust,2,Thu Jul 2 12:45:14 2015 UTC,"Elite defense from a forward, great pk, great possession numbers, amazing stamina...you know pretty much those things every contender wants in a 4th liner."
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,angelsil,18,Wed Jul 1 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"I thank him for what he's done for us. His experience undoubtedly helped to calm the younger players down during the playoffs. But with that said, he just wasn't nearly as effective as the rest of that fourth line, and took a lot of PIM. Bring on Condra!"
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,Praise_the_Tsun,8,Wed Jul 1 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"Seems like a great guy, but I think we upgraded. If he still wants to play I hope he gets a chance."
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,2ndprize,6,Wed Jul 1 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"This is such a relief to me. By the end of the year and the playoffs all I could think was that we had other guys (Drouin, Namesnikov, and now even Condra) that could come in and be more productive or at the very least continue to develop. I didn't think we were going to bring him back but I was still concerned, and I'm glad to hear that matter is now put to rest."
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,TheJDK,4,Wed Jul 1 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I liked Morrow, I just kinda wished that he could have gotten at least one point through 22 games in the playoffs. Condra is a huge upgrade though"
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,TampaFresh,2,Wed Jul 1 23:17:45 2015 UTC,A lot of goals went in on Morrow penalties. Bye.
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,MrUs,9,Wed Jul 1 21:07:40 2015 UTC,Getting the penalty is the issue.
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,MrUs,7,Wed Jul 1 21:39:01 2015 UTC,A lot of them.
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,MrUs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:00:57 2015 UTC,Morrow had a habit of getting penalties at just the wrong times to swing momentum in our opponents' favor. I will not miss him.
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,TSTMWKU,2,Wed Jul 1 22:08:36 2015 UTC,"Nobody is kicking him; it's the truth. A different level of awareness is expected of a 36 year-old hired for his veteran skills than from guys playing their first full season in the NHL. It seemed to me that Morrow was very frustrated by his inability to keep up (and contribute) during  the season and it led to him making some bad decisions. That continued, and even got worse, during the playoffs.  Super nice guy and I'm sure his locker room presence was helpful last season, but at the end of the day we need someone who can produce on the ice. He may find a role with a team that isn't built as much for speed."
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,TSTMWKU,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:20:59 2015 UTC,"If you look at all the penalties Morrow has taken during the playoffs, you would see most of them were miscalls.   I wouldn't go as far as most of his penalties being miscalls. He led the team in PIM for the regular season and was 3rd in the playoffs, despite playing a limited role. Everyone gets weak calls, but he got called a lot.   It's quite ignorant to say   Just because someone disagrees with your assessment of Morrow's performance doesn't make them ignorant. You act like people here are calling him a horrible person or a shitty player. Nobody is doing that. The general consensus is that he wasn't very useful to our team on the ice last season and the stats reflect that. Best of luck to him in a different system."
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,BetterCallStral,0,Thu Jul 2 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"Because they contributed. And they're very young. They're not ""veterans"" like Morrow."
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,mishey22,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:56:38 2015 UTC,Thank god. No offense to the guy but he isn't the hockey player he used to be.
TampaBayLightning,3bsgpx,GeneralChaz9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:28:47 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Morrow was a nice guy, but he didn't contribute on the scoresheet (and I know he wasn't meant to kick in a lot, but he barely kicked in anything) and he too way too many penalties for someone that should know better. Of course, a lot of his penalties were due to him being not as fast as the players that he was up against and so he was taking ""the game has passed me by"" penalties. He doesn't fit into the system the Bolts play because of that, and that's probably a bummer for some, but facts are facts."

TampaBayLightning,3bsrjv,OGHamToast,3,Wed Jul 1 23:35:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry until it's been over 2 weeks of negotiations. He's a stud and these type of contracts take a while to hash out.

It will take a couple weeks for him to sign, everyone will panic, and in the end Stammer will say that they had the contract worked out weeks ago and he was just waiting to come back from vacation to sign it. No worries!"

TampaBayLightning,3bry6l,jeritron,5,Wed Jul 1 17:52:15 2015 UTC,Really going to miss the Anacondra. Terrific bottom-six forward and amazing on the penalty kill.  A huge upgrade from Morrow and a steal of a contract.
TampaBayLightning,3bry6l,TampaFresh,6,Wed Jul 1 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"You know what I like the most about Condra? That he is not Morrow. Joking aside, he seems to be a decent defensive forward to play on the fourth line, I believe in the Yzerplan"
TampaBayLightning,3bry6l,jamishthegreat,6,Wed Jul 1 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Condra is one of the best depth players in the league, his corsi and possession stats are absolutely insane. Just don't expect his to score goals."
TampaBayLightning,3bry6l,csampson,4,Wed Jul 1 18:22:20 2015 UTC,Not bad. I live in Ottawa and watch them a lot. Condra is a serviceable PK'er with a bit more offense than JT Brown. Has speed too. Should fit in well on our bottom line.
TampaBayLightning,3bry6l,mandm4s,5,Wed Jul 1 17:56:01 2015 UTC,Sens fan seem to really hate losing him.
TampaBayLightning,3bry6l,OGHamToast,8,Wed Jul 1 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love Condra. He is fantastic defensively, and his tendency to miss wide open nets provides comedic relief. Take care of him."
TampaBayLightning,3bry6l,andrewthemexican,5,Wed Jul 1 18:01:41 2015 UTC,Him and Brown should get along nicely then.

TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,andrewthemexican,9,Wed Jul 1 13:53:32 2015 UTC,I still think he was trolling the fuck out of Toronto by liking that tweet.

TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,2ndprize,11,Wed Jul 1 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"Shades of ""Vinny trade to Montreal all but certain"", said ""credible"" sources every year. It's nothing more than Canadian media trying to invent a story"
TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,blueeyephoto,3,Wed Jul 1 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that trade was shook on at one point.  Subban, Price, Pacioretty, and a 1st for Vinny. Just Vinny.  It was literally all but certain- just shot down by Oren Koules, imposing a veto over Lawton.  I do not miss that ownership at all."
TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,whatacharacter,6,Thu Jul 2 00:12:11 2015 UTC,"It's just the whole ""coming home"" gimmick, most of my family are Leafs fans and they kind of just assume he will come to Toronto because home, and the media goes nuts over it. Living up here near Toronto is just awful because a lot of fans just feel like Stamkos is a sure thing, and they don't even realize that Stammer wouldn't even make more in Toronto because of taxes."
TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,TampaFresh,7,Wed Jul 1 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"Taxes and the ludicrous cost of living. His waterfront townhouse that cost $750,000 here would cost several million up there and not be nearly as fun for many months :-P  Source: Lived on the water in Port Credit. Was miserable from Nov - April"
TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,angelsil,4,Wed Jul 1 16:39:21 2015 UTC,"Leaf fan here, I come in peace. I'd love to have Stammer, but for your sakes and Stammer's, I pray he re-ups with you and you win your cups. But if he doesn't sign the instant 12pm ET today hits, the rumours will pile on hour by hour until he makes a choice. That said, a lot of people seem baffled that he even has a decision to make. I understand why a lot of people are critical of going into what can be such a negative environment - the highs in Toronto are amazing, but the lows make you weep for 48 years. But don't act surprised by the good ol' Canadian boy wanting to play in a traditional market like Toronto, which just so happens to be his hometown.   Good luck Bolts."
TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,frostynips,12,Wed Jul 1 14:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'll honestly be extremely surprised if he signs in Toronto. Stamkos is a shy dude and he really likes the privacy and anonymity afforded by living in Tampa. Not to mention the lifestyle of being able to golf, fish, etc. throughout the year and the low cost of living and taxes. He's been living in Tampa since he was barely 18, so for his adult life it has been home and he seems pretty happy with the balance of personal freedom and career success. There are also strong rumors that his girlfriend doesn't want to live in the Toronto madhouse and I don't blame her."
TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,angelsil,8,Wed Jul 1 14:51:08 2015 UTC,"The lows are so low that TML is one of the top 5 teams players don't want to play for. And there are rarely any highs this past decade.  It's a hard sell when Toronto keeps taking shortcuts. You guys said a proper rebuild, then hire a win-now coach who has never been on a rebuilding team. Hope you guys can finally get out of your rut.   But yeah, Stamkos is in the prime of his career and wants to win now, and that won't happen in Toronto for quite awhile."
TampaBayLightning,3br2ki,csampson,4,Wed Jul 1 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your luck, but you can keep your praying. The media are hyping it, but the bottom line is he has to leave a team on the top to get less money from a team on the bottom. No one in Tampa is even nervous about it. I wouldn't consider another team to even be in the running, so good ""luck"" to you, my friend."

Sustr is an extremely promising young player, and we shouldn't be so dismissive about him. Defensemen always come into their own a little later than forwards, and Sustr has been getting better every game."
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,njchava,6,Tue Jun 30 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"He got some absolute priceless development in the playoffs as well. Watch him in that first series against Detroit versus the Final against Chicago, he is a completely different player. His decisions with the puck when under pressure have gotten smarter, he is starting to use his body more than his stick finally. I think after this offseason he will be a 2nd line D-man comfortably, but I am no expert."
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,showers_with_grandpa,2,Tue Jun 30 22:59:46 2015 UTC,"""Sustr has been getting better every game."" While I agree with you on much of your other points, thats just not the case. He peaked mid way through the year and then started to look like awful sustr again. Although he did have a few good games early on in the playoffs, he faded hard. He struggled when they took him away from Garrison."
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,MoreWeight,4,Wed Jul 1 03:06:29 2015 UTC,Problem is that we can't sit here and wait when we don't know how many more great years we truly have to get to another Cup. I know our window is just opening but you never know what is gonna happen in the Salary Cap Era. I'm not a coach but feel with Carle as our #5 we need to give him someone else he plays better with at #6. That 3rd pairing got exploited all playoffs long and Carle seems like he doesn't have any confidence out there. I'm thinking it's because he is constantly worring about Sustr. If he doesn't make a lot of progress this year he needs to be benched and one of the Crunch players need to take his spot.   Sustr has the build to be a top 2 defensman but he plays timid out there both when checking and when he has the puck. He needs to play with more confidence and be stronger and I don't think he's gonna get there till 28-30...
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,emotoaster,9,Tue Jun 30 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"Well, every team needs a scapegoat to get mad at post-game."

TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,angelsil,3,Tue Jun 30 16:37:07 2015 UTC,that's like .53 Matt Carles.......   Edit different sources are confusing me. Some say 2.9 total and some say 2.9 per.   ok 2.9 total is awesome.  2.9 per would be a travesty.
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,2ndprize,2,Tue Jun 30 14:24:14 2015 UTC,This hurts my head.
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,kiruarracca,2,Tue Jun 30 15:14:32 2015 UTC,Still young and large d men take longer to develop. Great signing.
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,Graemelee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:28:17 2015 UTC,I am excited to see what the kid does in two years. I would like to launch the Andrej Sustr fan club starting now

TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,Lucas12,3,Tue Jun 30 15:32:58 2015 UTC,What difference does it make?
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,ClassicMach,-1,Tue Jun 30 15:38:45 2015 UTC,I want him put in the AHL.
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,Lucas12,5,Tue Jun 30 16:16:22 2015 UTC,He would still have to cross waivers on a two way and he won't clear waivers.
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,warrior4321,2,Tue Jun 30 16:26:50 2015 UTC,Oh. I thought two way meant they didn't have to go through waivers.   What's the difference between one way and two way then?
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,Lucas12,3,Tue Jun 30 18:49:30 2015 UTC,Two-way contracts have different pay for when you are playing in the NHL and the AHL.
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,etoh69,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:15:13 2015 UTC,About 800k a year.
TampaBayLightning,3bmsed,MoreWeight,3,Wed Jul 1 03:08:18 2015 UTC,no way he clears waivers
TampaBayLightning,3bmiaz,fuckyouabunch,3,Tue Jun 30 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"This is a good recap of the draft, our selections and our direction. But it's entirely worth it just for this:   Speaking of fear, Bokondji Imama (180) is 6’1” and already a solid 214 pounds. He fits the power forward description, but he’s not a scoring line player. Like Joseph and DiGiacinto, his role will be to make the Crunch or Lightning a harder team to play against. Jay Feaster used to refer to players like Stephens, Tammela, Joseph, and Imama as providing sandpaper, while John Tortorella called it jam and Steve Ludzik ""arriving in an ill manner."" Whatever you call it, Yzerman certainly has added to that component with these selections.   I can't wait to start arriving in an ill manner at my weekly managers' meeting."

TampaBayLightning,3bmu19,GeneralChaz9,7,Tue Jun 30 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"Let's hope that they can repeat that success.  The ""triplets"" will not be a surprise to anyone in the league anymore after making the finals."
TampaBayLightning,3bmu19,stamkos4life,2,Tue Jun 30 19:13:33 2015 UTC,"True, but the triplets are damn good players. It'd be best if they are used sporadically to throw teams off from now on, or try to mix around the lineup to figure out who else has extremely solid chemistry."
TampaBayLightning,3bmu19,GeneralChaz9,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:36:30 2015 UTC,"I like Bishop as much as the next guy but he isn't the best goalie in the league, he is a good goalie not the best goalie"

TampaBayLightning,3bmu19,GeneralChaz9,2,Tue Jun 30 23:37:25 2015 UTC,I think that's a fair assesment
TampaBayLightning,3bmu19,sleepdepriveddev,4,Wed Jul 1 00:33:50 2015 UTC,Let's just win in regulation a lot. Or draw penalties. I don't love the sound of tons of breakaways and no chance to handle the puck.

Since scoring every game got exhausting, I tried updating every two games and pretty much I decided to score every series. The points should be tallied up all the way until the end of the ECF (I think, can't check atm), leaving just the SCF left to score."
TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,warrior4321,14,Mon Jun 29 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"Have some faith that Sustr will develop, people. He has plenty of untapped potential and all this time in the big league is the best way to bring it out."
TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,TampaCub,2,Mon Jun 29 19:26:04 2015 UTC,With some muscle he could become the next Zdeno Chara!
TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,Always_Sunnyvale,6,Tue Jun 30 00:28:03 2015 UTC,Nope. Chara is a man beast and Sustr is afraid of pillow fights. I would love to put him on some testosterone and bump up his aggression (the complete lack of aggression will keep him from ever being Chara).
TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,MoreWeight,3,Tue Jun 30 01:11:56 2015 UTC,He'd have to stop being scared of laying people out.

TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,Aethir300,2,Mon Jun 29 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"""Solid"" at least implies that he doesn't fuck up a lot. He does."
TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,Lauxman,2,Tue Jun 30 02:42:16 2015 UTC,A 3rd pair dman will fuck up. That's why they play only 10 minutes a game.

TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,doctorlust,15,Mon Jun 29 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"Tall defenseman with good reach who's barely played 120 games (this season was his first full season). He needs more time to develop. Look at Hedman's development curve, he was considered a bust in his first few seasons, now he is an elite defenseman. Defencemen have a learning curve and we have to be patient if we want to develop them."

TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,2ndprize,11,Mon Jun 29 17:23:09 2015 UTC,we traded a bag of pucks for him late last season when Syracuse needed skaters.
TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,Clemburger,2,Mon Jun 29 17:34:44 2015 UTC,Wtf happened to him. He was a 1st round pick that was looking like he had tons of upside in Norfolk
TampaBayLightning,3bim1z,Cats_and_hedgehogs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"Remember, with regards to sustr, he's not amazing but with a qualifying offer if another team wants to sign him we get compensation. Without doing that another team could sign him and we'd get nothing. He's worth at least hanging onto for that."
TampaBayLightning,3bj3ao,fuckyouabunch,5,Mon Jun 29 17:16:48 2015 UTC,"He won the Calder in his first full season, putting up 48 points, wiith my Tampa Bay squad in ECHM. Here's to hoping he becomes the great defensemen we all know he has the tools to be."

TampaBayLightning,3bfrkz,csampson,8,Sun Jun 28 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"I think this kid is talented enough to play at the NHL level. I could see him as an awesome third liner with two of Killer/Cally/dump truck. Kid is a puck hound, surprisingly physical for his size (a bit like Palat), and can score. Even swapping this kid for Morrow would be a big upgrade."
TampaBayLightning,3bfrkz,MoreWeight,2,Mon Jun 29 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely think he has what it takes to play. It's just about finding a place for him. Losing Morrow would ideally let us get Drouin more ice time. I see Marchy as the rotating piece who can play on any line and bring some skill, speed and tenacity. Give a guy like Erne a good season in the AHL. Fills out our roster nicely at a great price and only a one year deal."
TampaBayLightning,3bfrkz,csampson,5,Mon Jun 29 04:22:58 2015 UTC,"Thats good. He will probably get a few games in as a injury replacement, I really hope he does well"
TampaBayLightning,3bfrkz,TampaFresh,2,Sun Jun 28 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"He is waiver eligible, he will be up the entire season or will have to pass through waivers (he probably won't make it through)."

TampaBayLightning,3bg64c,angelsil,16,Mon Jun 29 02:13:11 2015 UTC,He's still worth keeping for depth. Won't cost a lot. Plus he can still develop. D typically take 300 games to develop. Sustr hasn't even played half that. It would be terrible asset management to just let him go.  With that said this kid needs a dirty bulk. Like eat a big Mac every day kind of bulk.
TampaBayLightning,3bg64c,csampson,9,Mon Jun 29 01:11:00 2015 UTC,"While I hate the idea of keeping him, I think you are 100 percent correct. 6-8 dmen dont come around often, so you nurture them as best you can.  I have been saying for a while we need to get this kid on steroids. Would get him to fill out and might actually help him win a battle in the corner."

If you go to Ticketmaster or the ticket office to purchase tickets you pay the face value plus tax and fees.

TampaBayLightning,3bgqfk,dealinz,16,Mon Jun 29 02:04:24 2015 UTC,"These rules and the ones I am about to discuss are set by CBA or collective bargaining agreement which is agreed upon by the NHL and NHLPA. ELCs are a way of making a player ""pay his dues"" before cashing in, but in a reality they are a way for current or veteran players to hog cap space for themselves and for nhl owners to skimp talented rookies from what they deserve (compared to other players). It also prevents guys like Mcdavid from demanding 10 million when they haven't played one game.    Entry level contracts can range anywhere from $525,000 - $925,000 (2013 number, likely has gone up but I can't find a better source) in the NHL or $35,000-$70,000 in the AHL. This is a two-way contract, which is when a player makes a different salary in the NHL and the AHL. All ELCs are two-ways. So those guys in the AHL aren't making more than Paquette and Kucherov, but those guys in the AHL have higher base salaries because they were drafted in higher rounds and were subsequently paid more because their expected production was much higher than that of late round guys like Kucherov and Paquette.  That's pretty much your answer. To go deeper Kucherov and Paquette are also making more money because they earn bonuses.  These bonuses are in ELCs to make sure new players some receive some compensation for contributing like our youngins do. Bonuses fall into two categories ""A"" and B"". Category ""A"" bonuses are given out for accomplishing goals that are pre-set into a players contract, like scoring 20 goals, averaging 15 minutes in ice time or most commonly for the amount of games played. Games come in 5, 10 and 10+ increments. Most ELC will have some of these, but they are rarely ever disclosed to the public (at least that I am aware of). The max a player on an ELC can earn from type ""A"" bonuses is $850,000. It is likely Paquette and Kucherov are making near the $850,000 limit.  The next type of bonuses, type ""B"", are paid for by the league and are given out based on nominations for awards (Hart, Calder, Vezina etc.) and for finishing in the top ten for statistical individual categories (Points, Goals, +/- GAA, Save percentage etc). So Kucherov is getting a type ""B"" bonus for leading the league in +/-. Players on ELCs can earn up to 2 million dollars from type ""B"" bonuses. All said, a player on a ELC can make a maximum just shy of 4 million dollars. Ekblad is expected to earn this after winning the Calder. In the end, Kuch and Paquette are making more than those AHL peasants and are making more than their salaries say."
TampaBayLightning,3bgqfk,Robert_The_Tire,8,Mon Jun 29 03:08:23 2015 UTC,TIL  And people say Tampa fans don't know the sport.

TampaBayLightning,3bgqfk,Ask_Me_If_Im_Stamkos,4,Tue Jun 30 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"They aren't. Those are salaries if they are playing in the NHL, which they aren't."
TampaBayLightning,3bgqfk,MacerV,3,Mon Jun 29 02:10:44 2015 UTC,Ahh I see now. So when they're not on the active roster for the Bolts they're with the affiliate teams making ~$70k right?
TampaBayLightning,3bgqfk,MacerV,5,Mon Jun 29 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"They make whatever their contract states they make. For some its like ~70k, for others its 200k+. Some contracts aren't two way, they are one way, and they make their NHL salary regardless."
TampaBayLightning,3bgqfk,rayogata,2,Mon Jun 29 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"Marchy's been around longer than you think, just not with our team, so his is understandable. As for the other guys, I may be totally off base so forgive me but Kuch and Paquette may have signed their ELCs longer enough ago that those rates at the time were commensurate to the $925k now. Also, what /u/MacerV said."
TampaBayLightning,3bgqfk,eroved,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:17:04 2015 UTC,"Kuch and Paquette are still on their rookie contracts, believe it or not so theyre making less. Both are in for a pay increase"
TampaBayLightning,3bf02c,fuckyouabunch,7,Sun Jun 28 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Well, on the bright side it will give someone a chance to step into that roll and develop themselves and others."
TampaBayLightning,3bf02c,MrUs,8,Sun Jun 28 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"Sad to see him go. Veteran pro leadership as a mentor for the young players has been key for the overall success of the Lightning organization. His play on the ice can be replaced, but the character and leadership won't be easily replaced. Kind of quality pro all teams need in their organization."
TampaBayLightning,3bf02c,ZeykShade,3,Sun Jun 28 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Loved him when he played with us. A smarter Radko Gudas. Good luck to him.

TampaBayLightning,3bbjwl,SinisterTitan,3,Sat Jun 27 17:41:21 2015 UTC,He's a pure sniper but his defensive game is weak. He's a more shoot first Jonathan Drouin so he'll have to improve his defensive game if he wants to play for Cooper.
TampaBayLightning,3bbjwl,warrior4321,2,Sat Jun 27 19:57:19 2015 UTC,Does anybody know more about his back story? I heard he moved from Russia to sarnia alone at 14.  Did he have a host family ?

TampaBayLightning,3bb2il,thatline,6,Sat Jun 27 14:44:24 2015 UTC,"This is a great pick at this point and it seems like the Yzerplan is working perfectly. Mitchell Stephens (33rd) was a good pick as Bolt's first one, since of course at that point of the draft you want to focus on skill rather than need. Matthew Spencer actually manages to fill both areas: skill and need. I strongly believe he was the most skilled player available at this point and also it's never bad for lightning to have even more talented D-men in the organization, even though last years draft was strong on D-men. To me it seems like if everything goes well during his early career, he is expected to have a lot of ice-time, and be the guy who you can trust at any point. A little bit of a mixture of Coburn and Hedman."
TampaBayLightning,3bb2il,heppiss,3,Sat Jun 27 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"I like this pick.  We have a good, strong pool of D prospects now.  Gonna be exciting watching these guys work their way up over the next few years."
TampaBayLightning,3bb2il,Squorn,2,Sat Jun 27 15:53:14 2015 UTC,"I like this pick, though I do wish we had selected Andersson or Kylington. The Flames are beginning to scare me."

TampaBayLightning,3bazkv,bensly,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"Seems like a Nate Thompson type of player.  Maybe a little bit of a reach at 33, but definitely a good guy to have it seems."

TampaBayLightning,3bazkv,Robert_The_Tire,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:24:47 2015 UTC,Yup. I don't get it. Granted I've never seen him play but he looks like we could get him in the third round.
TampaBayLightning,3bazkv,FartmanBreaux,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:29:56 2015 UTC,Noob here. Don't we need defensmen?
TampaBayLightning,3bazkv,Robert_The_Tire,8,Sat Jun 27 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"Drafting for position in a draft this deep is kind of a weird decision; typically you want to draft the best overall player available. Also the first three picks of last year's draft were D-men (DeAngelo, Masin, MacLeod), and they project to be pretty solid."
TampaBayLightning,3bazkv,csampson,2,Sat Jun 27 14:29:35 2015 UTC,We drafted one first round last year. Anthony Deangelo.
TampaBayLightning,3bbnb4,kylieigh,6,Sat Jun 27 17:55:14 2015 UTC,Management said that they are interested in signing some undrafted players for development camp so it's not like they have completely passed on a player just because they didn't draft them today.
TampaBayLightning,3bbnb4,warrior4321,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Well, one of the players that Tampa drafted this season, Yzerman had been watching for two seasons and invited to camp last season. But you have to realize that players who are invited to these camps are long shots. We got Johnson through this method but we also had Gauthier, Milan, Sergeev, Korobov through this same method and all of those players from the latter section busted."
TampaBayLightning,3bbnb4,warrior4321,3,Sat Jun 27 19:57:30 2015 UTC,Seems like he can quarterback the powerplay pretty well. I think his height has a lot to do with it seeing as he's only 5'10. He also only weighs 174 pounds which could be a problem.   This guy isn't to be confused with the Canes selection of the Sebastian Aho from Finland. Maybe he just wasn't on the scouting report Yzerman had with him.
TampaBayLightning,3bbnb4,eroved,2,Sat Jun 27 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"I'm upset we didn't draft Sebastian Aho, the canes pick. I thought he was far and away the best player still on the board."
TampaBayLightning,3bbnb4,Robert_The_Tire,2,Sat Jun 27 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Same.. I thought for sure TBL woulda grabbed up Oliver Kylington. He was my pic, and he went to Calgary. Now- that being said i completely respect Yzerman's plan. I know he knows what's best for the camp and the team and therefore the fans."
TampaBayLightning,3bcjhd,MrUs,3,Sat Jun 27 22:45:16 2015 UTC,"The title should be Gagner's contact, not Pronger's."

TampaBayLightning,3bcjhd,kylieigh,2,Sat Jun 27 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"Can somebody help me understand how buying out a player works?   Like, how is this going to hurt Tampa Bay's salary cap?"
TampaBayLightning,3bcjhd,2ndprize,3,Sun Jun 28 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"A regular buyout varies by age. Under 26 and you can pay 1/3 of the contract. Over 26 it is 2/3. To demonstrate I will use Matt Carle.   Carle is over 26 and owed 16.5 mil over the next 3 years.  We take 2/3 of his contract and divide it by double the time left.  So 11 million devided over 6 years. Which is like 1.83 mil or so. That number goes on the cap for the double term amount. So we would have a 1.8 mil cap hit to buy out Carle. This would save us about 3.6 mil off the cap for 3 years but cost us 1.83 for the 3 after that.    Thus buyout decisions become very complicated as they deal with remaining salary not cap hits some contracts are more buyout friendly than others (obviously all under age 26 ones are much more friendly).   Gagner when we had him, would have been like 900k for 4 years to buyout. So we gave him to Arizona with 1.6 retained for 2. Now if he gets bought out we will have paid 1.6 for a year and will be on the hook for some confusing amount for 2 more.   I can't seem to find a source on what we will actually owe."
TampaBayLightning,3bcjhd,kylieigh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:01:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I still don't truly understand it all, but I'm know a lot more then I did a few seconds ago. Thanks again"
TampaBayLightning,3bcjhd,csampson,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"Basically, lets hope they don't buy him out so he's off our books next season!"
TampaBayLightning,3bcjhd,2ndprize,3,Sun Jun 28 21:27:28 2015 UTC,We retained salary on Gagner when we had him for 20 minutes. So we are part of the equation
TampaBayLightning,3bcjhd,2ndprize,4,Sat Jun 27 23:12:19 2015 UTC,That one is all Yzerman. He needed to dump Purcell's 4 mil cap hit. He found a trade for an under 26 he could buy out for 1/3 (so like a 3 mil savings). It just happened that Arizona was willing to give us a 6th if we retained the buyout amount and they took on Crombeen's 1.5 mil or so with it so now we have an extra 4.5 mil or so in cap space.  That money became Garrison or Stralman (I don't recall which). It wasn't a bad move but this shit today was unforeseen.

TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,BoltMatt24,18,Fri Jun 26 21:00:00 2015 UTC,I love Vinny. I dont know that I want him back.
TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,2ndprize,12,Fri Jun 26 21:03:59 2015 UTC,Oh I agree. I'm hoping that when he retires he comes back to Tampa to work in the front office or something.

TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,angelsil,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:39:05 2015 UTC,Philly is not moving him with retaining significant salary. Unless some cap floor team is really desperate.
TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,OGHamToast,4,Sat Jun 27 11:25:23 2015 UTC,"Is that a real question? Of course I do. He's probably the biggest candidate to be retired in Tampa right now and I think he might actually like that. Though things happen different than we expect from time to time, I think he'll be retiring in the next couple seasons and we may see a familiar face roaming the Tampa streets once more!"
TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,sarnald,8,Sat Jun 27 07:17:34 2015 UTC,He is another player that deserves to be retired here.
TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,rhudgins32,3,Sat Jun 27 02:52:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sick of seeing you downvoted. Regardless of what people think about Marty (who I saw you defending in another thread) he deserves it just like Vinny. Not only that, but once time passes I expect to see a statue much like the Red Sox Teammates with Vinny/Marty/Richy/Boyle. People forgive and forget. Even Ted Williams was once at odds with Boston fans and media."
TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,sarnald,3,Sat Jun 27 14:01:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. I have been on the willing end of downvote because I respect and support Marty Brad danny and Vinny regardless of team (except Washington and boston)
TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,showers_with_grandpa,2,Sat Jun 27 14:38:20 2015 UTC,I am sure he was offered that before we bought out his contract for tens of millions of dollars. Dude just isn't a player anymore since the shoulder gave out. Let him retire the guy who fleeced another team for a few more million.

TampaBayLightning,3b8jyo,bl80,2,Sat Jun 27 14:56:41 2015 UTC,This.  Same can ABSOLUTELY be said about Brad Richards.  I have sat in the Richards suite when he was with Tampa. All seats given every game to charities - the ones I attended were all full of kids that loved the experience. Both are very grateful people that earned their salaries that unfortunately meant they would end up being business decisions for the teams they played for.

TampaBayLightning,3b7gsb,csampson,4,Fri Jun 26 16:58:10 2015 UTC,Impossible to re-sign him until July 1st.
TampaBayLightning,3b7pwu,andrewthemexican,6,Fri Jun 26 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"I remember last off-season. He said he wasn't doing much. I spent the night of June 30th on my balcony with cigar and beer away from my phone. Woke up to find half the team traded (OK, not really, but he was very busy).  I don't trust Yzerman when he says he's not doing anything. I also can't stay up until 2am to confirm."

TampaBayLightning,3b7pwu,TampaFresh,2,Fri Jun 26 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say much things happen. Maybe a few lower tier players traded for later picks or vice versa. Offseason wise, maybe a decent 4th line signing, or Yzerman trusts in a rookie coming up. Honestly, it looks boring for us, but if thats the price to pay to win a cup, i'm perfectly fine."

TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,eyesoftheworld4,31,Sat Jun 27 02:50:51 2015 UTC,We will give you Carle in a palat jersey. How does that sound?
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,Royalflood,23,Sat Jun 27 04:22:11 2015 UTC,whatever a metric fuckton goes for nowadays
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,2ndprize,2,Sat Jun 27 02:55:11 2015 UTC,"I believe that's 7.2 first round picks, as of Friday's close of market."
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,Fleeegz,17,Sat Jun 27 12:31:41 2015 UTC,"Palat will not be moved. I know this is hypothetical, but my answer stands."
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,MoreWeight,5,Sat Jun 27 03:17:48 2015 UTC,Between the two I'd lean to keeping Kuch. I don't have any logical reason for it though.
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,etoh69,11,Sat Jun 27 03:48:32 2015 UTC,"At least a first round pick, a prospect or two and a second or two."
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,Robert_The_Tire,6,Sat Jun 27 03:17:05 2015 UTC,It would probably have to be a 1st rounder and a proven prospect and/or 2nd or 3rd line player that could step in right away. The thing is all of the triplets are gonna get better and better ceiling is practically unlimited for those guys.   In my eyes the following players are not being traded for anything.  Stammer  Hedman  All of the Triplets  Vasilevskiy
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,emotoaster,2,Sat Jun 27 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt either of these players move this season. Next season is slightly more probable, but considering who we have signed through next season (and the following one as well) I doubt many players get moved during the off season this year. Look for mostly the same Lightning lineup to glide onto the ice come opening night."
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,OGHamToast,2,Sat Jun 27 07:16:14 2015 UTC,Palat and Kuch will be around as long as their line produces because that line is not all TyJo and believe me they have the chemistry to be a force for a while. That said if we were to trade them i doubt it would be a single player deal they play good together because they've been playing together since before being NHL players so i thing it would be a package for a first rounder and two resaonably decent players.
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,Brittle_Bones_Bishop,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:24:21 2015 UTC,Come back and ask about Kuch next year. Neither is being moved now. And Palat has better defense and is the ultimate set up guy. He feeds TyJo and kuch like no other.
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,Aethir300,0,Sun Jun 28 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"I think there's be a better chance of Palat being moved as Kuch and Johnson seem to be able to find each other without looking, but still at least a first round pick and a couple prospects"
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,akairoketto,7,Sat Jun 27 06:32:17 2015 UTC,"But Palat is bigger, a better passer, smarter and better at defense."
TampaBayLightning,3b9mnc,Robert_The_Tire,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"True, Palat can for pretty much anywhere and produce, no doubt about that. But as a combo, I think it would be more beneficial to keep Kuch and Johnny together, especially after how they played this past season."
TampaBayLightning,3b4u1k,2015RaysTime,15,Thu Jun 25 23:52:46 2015 UTC,At least this one looks legit. That other one is a piece of shit.
TampaBayLightning,3b4u1k,Khue,5,Fri Jun 26 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"As nice as that is, of it was going to be any Lightning player, it would be Johnson. He produced more points in the playoffs than Stammer and Stammer was also on the 2012 cover"

TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,kylieigh,5,Thu Jun 25 23:09:01 2015 UTC,Well. We've done pretty well with Swedish defensemen so far.
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,Robert_The_Tire,7,Fri Jun 26 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"As for who we draft, I am hoping that Steve makes the decision to draft at the forward position this year. We have recently drafted quite a few defensemen in the first two rounds (Koekkoek, DeAngelo, McLeod, Masin, Hedman) in the past several years and have been fairly sparse in our forward drafting, minus Drouin and Namestnikov. With the 2017 offseason apocalypse on the horizon, it is important we pick up a center or winger who would be able to provide lateral scoring while also possessing a solid two-way game.   As for trades, I wouldn't mind seeing Tampa at least shop Carle to see if we would have any takers, as much as I think that it's a pipe dream someone will take him. I would also like to see Kessel be moved to a team where he won't be lambasted by the media after every game. As much as I would hate having to see him play us so often, it would make me very happy for our Floribro's if Kessel landed in Sunrise."
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:27:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's impossible to move Carle. There are a few teams like Dallas and Colorado that are actively searching for a top 4 D-man. Carle would certainly be that on those teams, the real question is what we would get back from those places."
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,jnkiejim,5,Fri Jun 26 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at a lot of mock drafts, and one of them had us picking up Alex Dergachev from Russia. Bob Mckenzie has him going at about 55, so if we could get him in the second round (we pick at 44 or so) I would be thrilled. Honestly, I trust the Yzerplan and I know who ever he picks will turn out to be great"
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,TampaFresh,2,Fri Jun 26 02:40:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a good Defenseman. We could always use more of those.
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,ElMorono,2,Fri Jun 26 00:44:04 2015 UTC,We need a center but I trust the Yzerplan.
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,emotoaster,0,Fri Jun 26 02:33:59 2015 UTC,Can only assume sarcasm
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,OGHamToast,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:11:18 2015 UTC,Actually we do if you look at our depth on the Crunch. Struggled with scoring. When drafting got to take into consideration that most picks take years to develop. Can never have enough scores and two way players and we spent a lot of picks last year on defense. I figure Yzerman is gonna draft BPA this year.
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,emotoaster,2,Fri Jun 26 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"Carlo, if he drops that far."
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,csampson,-16,Fri Jun 26 17:20:14 2015 UTC,I think we could probably get a big return for Palat right now.  Maybe trade up with Carolina.

You say an absurd thing, and then wonder why you get downvoted. You're making it sound like we are picking on you for something. I read what you wrote. You're entitled to your opinion, but obviously a few of us don't agree with it and are vocal about it.  Why would we trade an established, young, and explosive two-way forward who makes up 1/3 of arguably the best scoring line in the NHL? I understand the importance of speculation, but holy shit"
TampaBayLightning,3b4fbp,JeanLouWheezy,0,Sat Jun 27 00:08:28 2015 UTC,If your last paragraph just now was your original response to my post that would have prompted 2-way discussion and conversation ( I.e.

Palat could have scored us the additional pieces we need to make this a 15 year powerhouse instead of maybe a 6 year window.

TampaBayLightning,3b2wee,MeowmixMEOW,5,Thu Jun 25 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"You're talking about the Chase Club. I got to go there for our OT win over NY in the ECF. It's a really great experience. Your ticket includes free food and drinks. The food is legitimately good. Not good ""for an arena,"" actually good. Drink are free, but not top shelf. I think I was drinking Yuengling, and my buddy Had Jack and Cokes. The single barrel Jack is top shelf, but regular Jack was free, if that gives you an idea.  The seats are all on the end where the Lightning attack in the second period. They're second level. There are literally no bad seats in our arena, anyway, but I enjoy these, outside of wanting to be on the other end to see the Lightning attack twice.  Here's the page about it."
TampaBayLightning,3b2wee,fuckyouabunch,3,Thu Jun 25 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"One thing that should be mentioned with regards to the Chase Club.  The 4th floor Chase Club (Club 1 through 8) is NOT the same as the 5th floor Chase Club (Club 9 through 18).  Both of them are free food and booze, but the 5th floor is a much more stripped down menu (basic tailgate stuff like hot dogs and chicken fingers), whereas the 4th floor menu includes things like beef brisket, oysters in the half shell, pulled pork, BBQ chicken, etc..etc... 4th floor tickets have access to the 5th floor but not vice versa.   The 4th floor is where you want to be, however, those are harder to come by because they only sell 4th floor tickets as full season tickets.  That's not to say that you can find them in the secondary market during the season but you won't be able to buy a single game ticket directly from the Lightning."
TampaBayLightning,3b2wee,WorkIsBoring,2,Thu Jun 25 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely go the Chase Club route, prime rib and makers mark while watching the bolts dominate is about as good as it gets."
TampaBayLightning,3b2wee,Elroy10,2,Fri Jun 26 04:46:47 2015 UTC,"I happened to get impromptu tickets to our home game this past season against the Canucks, which also happened to be on a Tuesday (except in January). Tickets were wicked cheap, and iirc the team was running last minute ticket specials through ticketmaster.   Granted, who knows how it'll shake out this year. But less popular team with this crowd + Tuesday game usually equals fairly cheap tickets."

TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,2ndprize,5,Wed Jun 24 23:07:33 2015 UTC,It's just weird to me that we are keeping York. He would be the third goaltender and I don't think he wants to spend a full year in the ECHL.
TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,2ndprize,2,Thu Jun 25 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that you don't want an ECHL goalie who wants to be in the ECHL.  If Gudlevskis or Wilcox had played well last year I would think this was trade insurance, but I am more guessing they told him he would get to compete for a slot in Cuse."
TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,angelsil,2,Thu Jun 25 00:13:03 2015 UTC,We need a goalie in the ECHL and this contract allows him to go between the Blades and Crunch as needed.
TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:07:12 2015 UTC,"Which he'll have to do occasionally, as it sounds like we're going to have Vasi go down to play some back to backs occasionally, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Gudlevskis play a couple down here."
TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,angelsil,3,Thu Jun 25 13:33:09 2015 UTC,"I think the plan was for Kristers to get a game or two last season, but his performance in the AHL did him no favors and the 'Nabokov experiment' set things a bit askew."

But I don't hear too much about Kristers being bad, so much as I hear that we had taken everyone they had in front of him down here already.

TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,angelsil,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"I watched about half the Crunch games last season (fuck you AHL Live and your ridiculous pricing). He's very, very inconsistent. I say this as the self-appointed president of the Gudlevskis fan club. The roster turnover didn't help matters, but he really has some work to do on positioning and rebound control. If he can get that sorted, there is no question in my mind that he could be a NHL starter somewhere. He's incredibly agile and quick, possibly even more so than Vasy."
TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:44:45 2015 UTC,"Did he play much in Europe? That could explain positioning issues. Also, isn't the Syracuse ice sheet too short? That would make guys seem like they were wearing jet packs to a European goalie."
TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,angelsil,2,Thu Jun 25 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"He played for the Riga KHL farm team (HK Riga) before coming over to  North America. Really hadn't played a ton before being drafted, as he converted to ice hockey (from floor) at 16, IIRC. Never had a proper coach until he came over, either.  Syracuse is upgrading to a standard rink this off-season. That should help."
TampaBayLightning,3b08q0,warrior4321,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:56:29 2015 UTC,"It's an AHL contract, he knows he's competing for that AHL job but he's probably ready to play in the ECHL if he's needed there."

TampaBayLightning,3azbav,2ndprize,6,Wed Jun 24 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"I wrote an article that defends the Matt Carle contract.  I couldn't believe it either, but read it before you call me an idiot."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,MoreWeight,2,Wed Jun 24 18:32:04 2015 UTC,"I think there is a flaw in the thought process of ""look what defensemen A, B, and C got. They have comparable numbers, so the deal isnt that bad."" Yeah, they are getting comparable deals, but they are getting potential albatross contracts as well. For example, that Petry deal will have Montreal fans bitching in 2 years. Just because all middle of the road dmen are being overpaid does not mean they should be.  That being said, good on you for taking this one on. You make good points. While, I dont agree, I really enjoy the debates."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,MoreWeight,2,Wed Jun 24 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think those are good contracts.  I was just making the point that Carle was paid market value.  I think Dmen are sort of a bubble right now, like the housing market was.  We are going to see a bunch of teams regretting the shit out of paying 5-6 million for slightly better production than they could have gotten for 2.  I sincerely hope the Habs fans are crying to high heaven about Petry in a few seasons.  I was pretty shocked doing the numbers on him.  Meanwhile they are having a circle jerk in Montreal about how smart their GM was for cutting that deal."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,OGHamToast,2,Wed Jun 24 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"Could not agree more. Mediocre dmen are being paid ridiculous amounts of money. I am curious to see what top level teams do. If they have to pay to keep pace, or if the good teams are stocking depth from their own drafting. Probably a combo of both, but will be interesting to watch.   Also, it will be interesting to see if this prompts teams to start handing out much longer deals to young dmen. Look at the Leddy deal for the islanders. They gave him seven years! Sounds crazy, but it may look pretty damn smart in a few years (could always crash and burn though)."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,fuckyouabunch,2,Wed Jun 24 23:09:49 2015 UTC,I actually had the same thought about the Leddy contract.
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,7,Wed Jun 24 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"The context for the time makes perfect sense, but the context surrounding his contract now makes me pull my hair out, especially considering who the top 4 players are."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"Right, exactly he was a big, necessary step up, but even at the time we all knew he was getting overpaid. But that's just how it is with defensemen."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,5,Thu Jun 25 13:34:17 2015 UTC,"I think everyone understands the situation from which the Carle contract was born. He was slightly better then average, but it was the term and the no trade clause that has made me hate it since day one.   Good analysis.   Side note: fired up NHL 13 the other day for the first time in a while to play with some friends. Our defense was a monstrosity. Without our very powerful offense, I think we finish in the top 3 for the draft."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,4,Wed Jun 24 19:56:29 2015 UTC,I didn't recall just how bad the defense really was back then.  I remember getting Brewer and thinking Ohlund might come back one day. But really shit was bleak.    The contract Vancouver gave Garrison was absurd.  He had played in 190 games with 59 total points when they payed him all that money.
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,Robert_The_Tire,3,Wed Jun 24 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the Garrison contract. Again, the kicker for a lot of people here was the NTC and the term. I don't have a huge problem overpaying in the short term - one to two years - but contracts truly become an issue when they turn into anchors that prevent your team from any sort of long term mobility."
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,Steam_Gifter,4,Wed Jun 24 20:05:39 2015 UTC,They were both 27 at the time.  I don't think 6 years is crazy at that age (better than 6 years at 29 for Callahan).  I look at that Suter contract for 13 years and I think the Wild ownership figured there would be a salary rollback during the lockout just tike the one in 2004.  I have to wonder what Carle would get on the open market right now.  I have to guess with the lack of options out there he gets at least something between 3 years and 10 to 12 million.  Which is crazy.
TampaBayLightning,3azbav,Steam_Gifter,3,Wed Jun 24 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is, is that he actually had a solid résumé before heading to Tampa. He was putting up a ton of points as a top four pairing and was Philly's best puck mover (besides maybe Timonen). It is another reason why I understand the decision Stevie made at the time to sign him.   He hasn't been particularly hot for us the past two years, but he has been serviceable. You made an interesting comparison to Petry in your article. With top 4 defensemen demand on the market being the highest it has been in years, I think Carle fetches 4.5/5 AAV on another club. Whether or not it is a shorter term would depend on a team's prospect system."
TampaBayLightning,3b086x,Robert_The_Tire,4,Wed Jun 24 22:39:42 2015 UTC,"I remember watching the draft and seeing the Panthers take Barkov.  ""Oh my God we are really going to get Seth Jones.""  That's what I said. Followed by my wife asking me who Jonathan Drouin was.....   Thus far the Lightning have picked 3rd in the draft 3 times.  I really hope the third crack at this is a charm because Gratton over Kariya and Svitov over Koivu haven't worked out so well."
TampaBayLightning,3b086x,2ndprize,2,Wed Jun 24 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"I think this draft will turn out well long term. In a perfect world, Dru will become an excellent playmaker, Erne will be a third liner, Gudlevskis could be a backup to Vasy. Not bad i'd say"

TampaBayLightning,3aulvd,TIFUByJoiningReddit,10,Tue Jun 23 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"What this means for us:   We have $6.39 in cap space and 19 players under contract.  We need to sign 2 forwards and 1 defenseman at the NHL level. Namestnikov, Morrow, Marchessault, Barberio, and Sustr are free agents.   It shouldn't be difficult at all to resign Marchessault, Namestnikov and Sustr with how much money we have.   I included Marrchessault because I think he makes the opening roster to replace Morrow, however with $2.3 million extra in cap space next season we could sign a bottom six forward with more experience (like Morrow but not Morrow)."
TampaBayLightning,3aulvd,2ndprize,8,Tue Jun 23 17:16:40 2015 UTC,I think they should keep the cap space for a potential late season pick up after signing the RFA's.  I wouldn't be too certain the cap will go up again next year and I really want to see Kucherov and hedman get extended.
TampaBayLightning,3aulvd,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Tue Jun 23 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. We save the cap in the event that we need to pick something up later on. If we don't, we have a little extra wiggle room as the asteroid that is the Stamkos contract comes barreling towards our cap space."

TampaBayLightning,3aulvd,csampson,5,Tue Jun 23 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"I see Carle being moved next summer. Flip the summer after. And then Bishop. That's about 5-6 million off the books every season for the next 3. Boyle's contract is up in 2 seasons as well.   IMO we cannot waste valuable space in the bottom 6. That means we need to fill those roles with successful drafting. Luckily, that shouldn't be too much of an issue for this organization."

Missing Lightning hockey dearly, and every time I walk by a TV screen and see a picture or video of the Hawks celebrating their cup I physically wince. The pain is still there, and it will take a lot of time to heal - what I can say is that it will leave a long lasting scar. Our boys played their hearts out for us, and I'm looking forward to October.  As for now.. this draft is arguably the most important year for the Canucks in the past fifteen seasons, so I have been spending a lot of time reading scouting reports and some of the commotion coming out from Vancouver media. It's an interesting dichotomy; the Lightning don't have much to address, but the draft is how Yzerman has built this squad. The Canucks, on the other hand, are in a state where if they don't draft well, they are completely fucked. Going to be a lot of ups and downs on Friday.   Also been following football off-season, and being cautiously optimistic about the Bucs' chances next year. And don't even get me started on the Bears."

TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,fuckyouabunch,6,Mon Jun 22 14:51:59 2015 UTC,"I felt like Stamkos was adjusting to his role against Detroit and his drought there was due to legitimately sub-par play. And by sub-par I mean sub-superstar. After that he seemed to fall into his role and came out swinging against Montreal and continued on swinging until we lost in game 6 against Chicago. The only problem was that he couldn't convert against Chicago. The dude played stellar hockey and is deserving of that ""C"" on his chest. I just hope his desire to win outweighs his desire for a big payday and we manage to sign him for something a bit more reasonable than what most folks expect. My wish is 5 years at 8.5 mil."
TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,OGHamToast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:14:30 2015 UTC,"8.5 AAV would be fantastic, a coup. That's only 1M more than it is now. It seems like most people think it'll be a similar deal to the Kane/Toews deals, though."
TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,TIFUByJoiningReddit,2,Mon Jun 22 16:23:18 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I think that's what happens even if he's not in it for  the money. It's a long term deal and he's in the prime of his career. It's pretty much his agent names the price and the team doesn't have any bargaining room. Maybe we get lucky and he takes around $9.5 - 10M because he cares about the cap and building a winning team but it's not too likely.
TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,OGHamToast,2,Mon Jun 22 16:42:36 2015 UTC,"That's what people are saying. That's what I expect, that or more. I hope he wants to win and recognizes how his contract could hinder the team."

TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,OGHamToast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:10:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like a cap hit of 8.5 mil would be amazing.

TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,Lauxman,2,Wed Jun 24 00:40:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think his performance in the Final would have been perceived differently if not for the first round. He only had two assists against Detroit, despite having a CF% of 56.2 and a PDO of 105.2. But because he didn't have any goals, the narrative throughout the playoffs was that he doesn't show up in the payoffs. It's absurd. Stamkos was a force out there, but there are always going to be people who only look at the box score."
TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,Lauxman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"When you're getting held to, what was it, 2 goals in 3 games, you probably should have a look at the box score."
TampaBayLightning,3apsgp,MrSantaClause,3,Mon Jun 22 15:31:21 2015 UTC,"The article exists to refute that argument.   Shooting percentage and save percentage, two largely variable statistics, can completely change the optics of a small sample.  That’s what we saw with Stamkos in the Stanley Cup Final.  He ran into a hot goalie, and wasn’t very lucky.   Box score just doesn't show what happened. Stamkos had some high quality chances while playing against the best defense that the best team in the league had to offer. He's quantifiably been one of the best shooters in the league for years. If he's getting good chances and they're not going in, it's not due to incompetence, lack of talent, or lack of desire."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,eroved,7,Mon Jun 22 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"Gudlevskis stays down.    Ikonen spends most of the year down in Syracuse with a few games in Tampa.  Adam Erne spend the full year in Syracuse.  De Angelo stays in major juniors Syracuse full time he is eligible /u/ClassicMach   Koekkoek, I don't know about. He hasn't played as consistent as need be in Tampa and right now we have six possibly seven nhl defensemen.  Johnathan Marchessault full year in Tampa. His role really depends on what Yzerman decides to do. We have too many centers. Stamkos, Filpula, Johnson, Paquette, Boyle, Marchessault, Namestnikov and Killorn (yeah he's a natural centerman bet you didn't know that). Some one Has to go."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,Robert_The_Tire,3,Mon Jun 22 02:01:06 2015 UTC,"Agree with Guds and Ikonen.  Generally agree re: Erne, but I think he's got a non-zero chance to make the club, but will probably get a callup or two.  DeAngelo broke major jr last season. I think he goes to Syracuse. He's done all the developing he can with kids."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,ClassicMach,2,Mon Jun 22 04:43:34 2015 UTC,DeAngelo has an October birthday. I think he has to be 20 by September 15th to be eligible for the AHL.  Which sucks because he should be moving up.   edit:  oops I mixed up cutoff days looks like he will be eligible
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,2ndprize,2,Mon Jun 22 13:13:49 2015 UTC,Yup cut off is December 31st. He's good.

TampaBayLightning,3antz7,Robert_The_Tire,2,Tue Jun 23 01:16:51 2015 UTC,"Well yeah. Put another way, I ain't looking for bigger returns if it means trading away the better players."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,ClassicMach,4,Tue Jun 23 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"I think Barberio, Witkowski, and Morrow will be gone. Koekkoek gets a call up and we sign another defenseman on the cheap.  Drouin is going to have a huge year next year I think. We'll probably sign a cheap winger too unless Yzergod thinks Erne is ready.   I don't really see us making any big moves, but personally I think that's a good thing."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,coachhawley,4,Mon Jun 22 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"I'm positive Morrow will be gone, I hope Sustr will be too but it's not likely, and if any current centermen get traded it'll most likely be Filppula. I'm guessing SFY adds a second/third pair defenseman for cheap of he can find one. Gudlevskis might play a game in Buffalo, but other than that no call-up aside from possible injury replacement. Marchessault re-signed and a few games in Tampa here and there. I think Koekkoek will have a couple short term call-ups."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,akairoketto,3,Mon Jun 22 05:17:12 2015 UTC,I honestly think you could see Flipper move. He's skilled enough to entice offers and just can't take either center spot on the top two lines now..
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,Aethir300,3,Mon Jun 22 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree. 51 showed how valuable he is in the playoffs. Numbers have dipped in the regular season due to line match ups and assignments. Plus he is only player who has won a Stanley Cup. He's important for zone entries on the PP, faceoffs and his defensive play. I doubt he will be moved this year. However I do think he will be moved before his contract expires."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,snoggingmongrel,2,Mon Jun 22 20:18:42 2015 UTC,He'll probably go when it's time to give Hedman more money
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,kylieigh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:01:51 2015 UTC,I think it happens this off season for stammers increase.
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,Aethir300,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:02:44 2015 UTC,Which won't take affect until after next season. He still has a year.
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,Robert_The_Tire,0,Mon Jun 22 17:22:57 2015 UTC,But he can get more in return now with a full year on his contract.
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,Robert_The_Tire,3,Mon Jun 22 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"Morrow gone via FA.  Don't sign anyone. Let Barbs go. Erne MAYBE makes the team given his playstyle, but with Nammy and Drouin needing time to develop, it's probably better to put him in the AHL to start. Bring up Koekkoek f/t. We need to start developing our internal D at a higher level. I'd be wary to bring up DeAngelo so fast (believe he is AHL eligible, so he'll do well there). Koekkoek has played in the AHL and did well. I thought he played alright in his call up. Time to give him more time.  Ideally, we move Carle this summer. But I don't see this happening until next summer. The year after Flip will need to go and Coburn is a UFA (probably not resigned). Hedman, Stralman and Garrison + DeAngelo, Koekkoek, Nesterov and a 7th D would be the ""future"" of our blueline IMO.  Long term, Carle and Flip are gone...Bishop probably next. This frees up cash for us to re-sign all our guys and Vasy takes over the reigns (mostly out of necessity cap-wise)."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,csampson,3,Mon Jun 22 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"That 2017 offseason, though.   Seeing Carle traded would make me very happy, but it is unlikely unless we take a shit contract going the other way. He cannot lead a defensive pairing and must be replaced by a younger player with more upside. Koekkoek looks like he is going to eventually be a much better Matt Carle; I think this is the year where we should be bringing him in on a more regular basis, and filling the role Barbs had before (7th d-man fighting for playing time while practicing with the team).   DeAngelo still has a lot to learn about the defensive side of the pro game. I would like to see him play with Syracuse, as he has nothing left to prove in the minors. In the event there are catastrophic injuries to our defence (completely not out of the question given that one point in time where four of our six regulars were out), he could log some minutes with the big club.  I'd like to see Erne fill the role which Morrow had on the team. He is young, fast and strong enough to be played on the fourth line and hopefully provide some form of lateral scoring. I'd also appreciate it if he didn't take stupid penalties like Morrow did, and completely nullify any sort of offence.  Namestnikov is an interesting case, as I feel like he deserves to be in on a scoring line with the proper wingers. Unfortunately, it would take an immense performance from anyone to crack our top 6 (though I would be curious to see Drouin replace Kucherov on the triplet line and move Kuch up to the first with Stamkos and Killorn).   I am keeping my expectations tame, but I think Drouin is going to have a standout year next year. After a full season in the NHL, a long and grueling playoff run where he fought hard to get into the lineup, and a summer to rest and continue to develop his body, Dru will be a much better player this year then he was last. That's not taking anything away from Dru this year - it's just that he will be more acclimated to the life of an NHL player."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Mon Jun 22 22:20:17 2015 UTC,I think they should trade Bishop. I would love to him on the team but after next year he is going to probably want a pay raise and the Lightning have Vasilevskiy. I don't want to rush Vasy but if we don't trade Bishop now the Lightning might not get anything in return for him.
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,etoh69,10,Mon Jun 22 05:22:44 2015 UTC,"i think parting with bishop is inevitable, but he's still got two seasons left on his contract. i don't think they trade him this year, unless they get something big in return. i feel like he has to stay at least one more year while we wait and see how vasy develops."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,InFlamesWeTrust,2,Mon Jun 22 09:31:52 2015 UTC,Oh he does. I was thinking next year was his last contract year. That is good news because I think Vasy can do with another year to mature without the pressure.
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,etoh69,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:29:06 2015 UTC,"I think Bishop's job is to start until Vasy is ready, if not he's going to be our unprotected goalie in the expansion draft. Expansion life is difficult if you want to protect two goalies."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,Knox-Overstreet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:55:10 2015 UTC,Every time i look at our defensemen contracts i yell out WTF! seeing Carle's pay in comparison with rest of them. Also NTC will be a bitch to work with

TampaBayLightning,3antz7,ClassicMach,3,Mon Jun 22 23:48:02 2015 UTC,Chicago was running circles around him in last few games. Every time him and Sustr were on the ice my heart rate increased and i was getting nervous for a goal possibility ...
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,tewas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure why I wrote ""very good,"" definitely meant ""pretty good.""  The problem is he and Sustr are a bad match. There are defensemen who can carry Sustr and make a decent pair, just like there are defensemen who can carry Carle and make a decent pair, and the stats bare this out.  But those two canNOT be put together."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,ClassicMach,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'm all with you on this one. However if we split Garrison/Coburn, we're left with 1 very good D pairing (hedman/stralman) and two OK pairs, instead 1 very good, 1 good and one below awerage. Also Susrt is learning so i'm not sure where he will end us on d-men spectrum.   If Carle would be 24 y/o with 1.2M/year or something to that tune, i'd have 0 issues. But fucking 5.5M and 30 y/o ..."

Honestly, i'd trade Namestnikov to a western team on the same basis of Connoly's deal, just get a couple seconds for him. I feel like Vlad has a lot of potential, but honestly he would never play top 6."
TampaBayLightning,3antz7,TampaFresh,0,Mon Jun 22 15:00:28 2015 UTC,"Carle out via trade/buyout. Morrow out. Barberio out. We have a lot of depth at forward (players trying to make roster especially) so if we were to trade in the draft/offseason I would expect a piece of the deal to be a forward. They could also manage to deal away one of their goalies in Wilcox or Gudlevskis if the value is there. In the draft we're probably looking for a big aggressive forward (much like Adam Erne) or a puck moving defenseman in the draft. However as Yzerman says he does, they could just pick the best player available with the 28th overall pick and not address immediate needs.  Overall, should be a pretty boring off season.  But hey this is a good thing."
TampaBayLightning,3alpna,2ndprize,4,Sun Jun 21 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"We got the best defenseman in the draft, and after that really nothing else."
TampaBayLightning,3alpna,TampaFresh,2,Sun Jun 21 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"As I like to think of it, they didn't fuck up the one unfuckupable thing in the draft and then fucked up the rest."
TampaBayLightning,3alpna,MacerV,3,Sun Jun 21 16:38:24 2015 UTC,Honestly us Leafs got a steal with Richard Panik. Guy did well this season with limited ice time creating some nice secondary scoring. He should be a shoe-in for 3rd line (possibly 2nd line if trades/injuries happen) minutes under Babcock. The lightning depth at forward is scary.
TampaBayLightning,3alpna,OGHamToast,3,Sun Jun 21 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah in retrospect they should have kept him and sent down Namestnikov who was waiver eligible.  Namestnikov just had a monster camp and preseason.  He is an RFA now, and I think Yzerman would have moved him at the deadline like he did fellow RFAs Connolly and Gudas.  He was clearly looking at the Stamkos extension when he moved all those guys."

That can so easily fuck up a player's development. It makes me wonder though, could he have been better if he wasn't rushed? Crazy thought.  My flair speaks for me pretty well here, though.

He scored the first goal of the tournament in 2010 but hurt his shoulder in the game.  The Wild were discussing a contract with him then but figured they would just let the kid go back to juniors and sign him later if they wanted to.  Except Johnson scored like 115 points that year with Spokane, and everyone came sniffing after him then.   Everyone passed on the kid in the draft, but Minnesota really fucked that up."

TampaBayLightning,3aknu9,MrUs,3,Sun Jun 21 05:45:31 2015 UTC,I'm not feeling haunted at all. Two years ago I was at a pool at disney while my buddy was at a training camp practice. He laid out the potential starting lines and we both lamented that after line 1 we were fucked. Half the conversation was about the next draft and trading for Ryan Miller. We agreed that we liked Palat and that Johnson might have some Brian Rolston potential. We had no clue this was a playoff roster.   This team is ahead of schedule and making the finals was a huge addition to the tool box. This roster knows everything it needs to do now. Losing sucked like a freshman breakup but I won't be lamenting this for years.
TampaBayLightning,3aknu9,2ndprize,2,Mon Jun 22 00:16:00 2015 UTC,"That pretty much sums it up. I told my 7 yo son to remember this moment (when Bish gave up a de facto empty netter in the 1st period) - it was the exact point when we lost it.

And, seriously, touching the Wales has a 0% chance of winning the SC, it was a joke.    Good fucking grief.

TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,Ian_is_funny,14,Fri Jun 19 19:43:29 2015 UTC,I want Vinny back as much (if not more) than the next guy but right now isn't the time to make it happen/ We have 7 centers on our roster right now and most of them are forced to play the wing because we don't have enough spots. Add in Vinny's cap hit and even if Philly keeps some salary we still don't have the room.  I think what we need to do is be patient and in 2-3 years when we sort out our cap issues (and Vinny's current contract expires) than we sign him for his final 1-2 years to be our 3C or 4C and hopefully give him one last playoff run (he always was a beast in the playoffs).  He'll wear a Lightning uniform again before he hangs up his skates.
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,TIFUByJoiningReddit,0,Fri Jun 19 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"Even though it's impossible, it's more so sending a message to Vinny and maybe Vinik/Yzerman too."
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,2ndprize,4,Fri Jun 19 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"I love Vinny a ton.  I am down with a lightning fans sending love for him over twitter thing sure.  as a practical matter of considering it for the team,the very first thing to consider in any talk about this is Stamkos.  Stamkos would need to be 100% on board before anyone considered bringing back an old captain.  If he didn't want that voice in his locker room then it is a non-starter.  2. The Flyers gave him an idiotic contract, and Vinik isn't going to pay him a bazillion dollars to play here (even though he currently pays him half a bazillion not to).   I would love to see Vinny in the Morrow slot though.  I think he and Boyle would be productive since Boyle's physical play would draw some of the injury risk off Vinny.  He can take late game faceoffs and could contribute a bit on the power play.  But not for 4.5 million.   however a straight up carle for vinny trade takes a million off our cap hit :)"
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,2ndprize,2,Fri Jun 19 20:00:36 2015 UTC,That's a vivid picture you paint.
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,GeneralChaz9,3,Fri Jun 19 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"Although this would be so fucking cool, the torch has been passed to Stamkos, and our roster is pretty fucking solid(despite some defensemen issues). Bringing Vinny back would be a dream, but he'd most likely get stuck as a wing/non-captain/non-center."
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,MoreWeight,6,Fri Jun 19 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"Way to slow for this roster. He would have to play a fourth line role, and I was hoping we wouldnt have anyone on that line with cement boots again next year (looking at you Morrow)"
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,confusedgeezer,2,Sat Jun 20 04:13:00 2015 UTC,Might cost to much and might be better off bringing up younger talent and invest in that idea because I was reading he has a 5.5 mail cap hit?correct me if I am wrong

TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,TampaFresh,2,Fri Jun 19 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"Very improbable and would probably never happen, but I would love him back. Obviously on a contract of something like 2yrs/2mil.

TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,tcigzies,2,Fri Jun 19 20:00:46 2015 UTC,"no hes older now, not worth the money, doesnt produce, injury prone. but for like 1.5 a year id love to see vinny finish out his days as a boy in blue again."
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,InFlamesWeTrust,2,Fri Jun 19 20:27:15 2015 UTC,"i would love to see vinny back in blue, but philadelphia would have to retain a pretty significant portion of his salary for it to be worth even considering. we also have a logjam of centers, and a lot of them are already playing wing. the only way i see it happening this year is if he decides to hang up the skates and sign a one day contract so he can retire a bolt."
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,LeanMrfuzzles,2,Sat Jun 20 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"If he didn't have such a shitty contract maybe. I know if he's traded Philly will likely eat a lot of it. I'm not sure how he'd fit in today though, as he'd probably end up on the fourth line and likely be sort of like what morrow was for us. Not a key piece of the offense but provided a good amount of veteran experience and leadership. Obviously looking at my flair most would be able to tell I love Vinny, he's still my favorite player, but I think the next time we see him with the Lightning will be when he's retiring on a one day contract."
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,LunaticNik,2,Sat Jun 20 03:49:13 2015 UTC,Hopefully he comes back like Nabby went back to the Sharks.
TampaBayLightning,3afkrv,Tampabear,2,Sat Jun 20 22:15:41 2015 UTC,It is time to win.  Not the time for sentiment.  There is no place on the roster for him and even at a discount there isn't enough cap space.  We need a good 2nd or 3rd pair defenseman.

TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,rayogata,10,Sat Jun 20 01:25:56 2015 UTC,We need to move Carle. Will it happen? Questionable at best.   Sustr? I'd like to see him walk off into the sunset holding hands with Carle. But I don't think he's going anywhere.   Morrow. I give it a 96% we let him walk in FA.
TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,SNl9ER,2,Fri Jun 19 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yzerman said he might give Morrow another year, but if he doesn't I'm pretty certain Morrow's going to retire with Dallas then."
TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,kylieigh,7,Fri Jun 19 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"I really could see it. I said 96% he walks simply because we reeeeeeaaally need the roster space for up and comers. I also don't think we need his experience at this point as badly and I do also believe if everyone pitches in we wouldn't miss his rough and tumble style of play. I have nothing but respect for the guy and I don't think he did a bad job like a lot of people were whining about but I think he walks. Most likely as you said, back to Dallas."
TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,SNl9ER,3,Fri Jun 19 21:40:44 2015 UTC,Morrow would need to sign at a value that allows him to miss 50% of the games. He may have great value but most of it isn't on the ice.
TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,2ndprize,3,Fri Jun 19 23:12:44 2015 UTC,My guess is Barberio and Morrow are gone. Carle should go but he falls into an awful category. Little trade value but worth more on the ice than a double time standard buyout.
TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,2ndprize,2,Fri Jun 19 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are saying Sustr but I don't agree. He's minimal cap hit right now and I'd be willing to give him the benefit of another year of development. I am not sold on him being as awful as everyone says. I think he has higher potential then Carle right now. Another year picking up stuff from Stralman, Garrison, and Hedman will serve him well and then re-evaluate next season. At the trade deadline if he looks like dead weight consider moving him. 6'8"" will have trade value then."
TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,Khue,3,Sun Jun 21 13:03:42 2015 UTC,I assume sustr can be signed at close to his current salary. In that case I can imagine few improvements at that cost until one of the better prospects comes up. If however they give sustr like 2 million per I will not be pleased.
TampaBayLightning,3ag2ky,2ndprize,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"Sustr, Barberio and Witoski are all restricted free agents. We have Koekkoek in the minors and nesterov. Both need more NHL time. I don't know if Koekoek is ready for the NHL quite yet, but he could be. That's a talk with the AHL coaching staff. DeAngelo is still at least one more year out. I think Yzerman looks to trade Carle if he can find good value. If Carle gets traded Sustr stays and Barberio goes. If Carle stays, I think both of them get traded or don't get resigned. I think Witowski gets an AHL contract regardless of what happens with Carle. Marrow coming back is half up to him and half up to the team."

TampaBayLightning,3aekpg,fuckyouabunch,2,Fri Jun 19 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of good analysis here. the whole thing is worthy of a read and consideration, but a few interesting bits here:  On Names, Morrow, Marchessault:   Taking the Game 6 SCF lineup, Morrow drops out, but the Lightning have both Namestnikov and Marchessault ready to step in. Marchessault would have to pass through waivers to go back to Syracuse and Vladdy has nothing left to prove in the AHL and needs NHL time to mature. This leaves little room for AHL-eligible Erne or an outside-the-org addition.   On everyone's favorite:   The best thing to do is to buy out Matt Carle or trade him (if he agrees) to a team with plenty of cap room and needing a veteran 2-way presence. The Lightning may have to package a prospect or pick of value with him to gain what’s desired by moving him – space on the roster and in the financial books."

TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,InternationalCow,6,Fri Jun 19 00:39:57 2015 UTC,He played way more minutes than 114 with Sustr. This stat has to be from data when Hedman was hurt. Carle often played with stralsy and Garrison/Sustr was a pairing. And coburn is absent. Not a good look at the entire season.  edit: I stand corrected. Apparently I have a short memory and Carle/Sustr wasnt much of a thing until the playoffs.
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,MoreWeight,3,Fri Jun 19 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"These are even strength minutes from 2014-2015  http://www.puckalytics.com/superwowy.html  If you expand to 2013-2015, Carle has a 47.1%GF with Sustr and 57.1% without. 50.1% CF with vs 49.6% CF without"
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,MoreWeight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:49:23 2015 UTC,"I am having a hard time believing he only played 114 minutes with sustr during the regular season. I know he was hurt at the end, but that still seems low."
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,MoreWeight,0,Fri Jun 19 13:58:23 2015 UTC,Numbers don't lie man
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,MoreWeight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:30:53 2015 UTC,"I am suggesting that the numbers are not a complete representation of the season. He played 1209 minutes this regular season and this tweet accounts for 718 minutes. So yes, the numbers are correct, but they only account for 60 percent of his minutes played this year."
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,MoreWeight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"He played 974 at even strength. You're thinking of his all situations minutes. The even strength missing minutes are with Radko Gudas. 4 goals for 5 goals against, 52.2% CF"
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,andrewthemexican,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:23:36 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, you are correct! Very good call. Interesting numbers. I guess he was mostly paired with Sustr during the postseason and I just have a short memory."
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,TIFUByJoiningReddit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think Carle is pretty underrated. If the lightning want to trade him for cap relief, they could likely do so without retaining salary if they pair him with a decent partner next season. Recency bias makes him look especially bad as Sustr-Carle got ripped apart in the playoffs. I'd even consider taking Carle over Coburn as I don't think Coburn is that good at controlled exits. Carle has a much better first pass imo."
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,andrewthemexican,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:30:08 2015 UTC,I wouldnt mind retaining Carle if not for that cap hit. My issue is his partner. Carle isnt a guy who can carry a pairing. Thus the problem when paired with Sustr. He gets a lot of flak for not being able to carry a pairing with a borderline NHLer.
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,TIFUByJoiningReddit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:52:10 2015 UTC,I'd like to see him play with Barbeiro for a full season. He could also play with Garrison if the Bolts traded Coburn.
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,2ndprize,4,Fri Jun 19 23:08:38 2015 UTC,Him and Sustr were noticeably bad together in the playoffs. They just couldn't gel at all. But each with them with someone else and both were carried to look better.
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,2ndprize,3,Fri Jun 19 12:03:49 2015 UTC,Carle plays well with just about  anyone else but Sustr. Sustr drags everyone down with him.
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:07:02 2015 UTC,The problem was that when you split up Stralman-Hedman it really limits how effective Hedman could be offensively. As a pairing Hedman joined a lot more rushes and created a ton of offensive but when he's paired with Sustr he has to play so conservatively that he's not nearly as effective.  I think we should have played Hedman/Stralman like Keith/Seabrook were played and have them log 27-30 minutes per game with Carle/Sustr playing less than 10 minutes.
TampaBayLightning,3aclvp,TIFUByJoiningReddit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"Carle can play 20+ minutes just fine, just has to be with Garrison or Coburn who played his personal best with IMO.   Sustr has one more year before I write him off. Many tend to say taller defensemen like Hedman/Sustr take almost 200-300 games to hit their stride."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,SoonerinTampa,7,Thu Jun 18 13:36:26 2015 UTC,Any guess on numbers? I'm hoping for 8 years between 80-90 million.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,csampson,6,Thu Jun 18 15:36:47 2015 UTC,Between 7-9Million AAV will make me happy. Yzerman can pull it off.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,coolman1581,10,Thu Jun 18 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"if it is between 7-9 million AAV, we should throw Yzerman a fucking parade."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,6,Thu Jun 18 16:08:59 2015 UTC,Sometimes players take a pay cut to play for an elite team.  See: Miami Heat
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,coolman1581,2,Thu Jun 18 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, the Brad Richards deal in Chicago is a good example, but Stamkos can't give a huge hometown discount or the NHLPA will lose their shit. If he signs for less than 10 per that will be a big discount.  My guess is that the Kane/Toews contracts are the baseline."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,2,Thu Jun 18 18:36:00 2015 UTC,He stated a year ago that he envisioned something like that. 10.5 I dont like. 9 I would be comfortable with.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MoreWeight,2,Thu Jun 18 20:12:14 2015 UTC,If be pretty happy with that which is basically the PK Subban deal. The thing with Stamkos is that he could probably become the highest paid guy in hockey. And by signing here he is probably giving up some ungodly sum of money he could get in endorsements in Toronto.   This is going to be the contract that sets up his family for a long long time.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,3,Thu Jun 18 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"Giving up endorsement money, sure, but also paying a LOT less in income taxes."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,fuckyouabunch,4,Thu Jun 18 22:21:16 2015 UTC,"I recall that someone attempted to show the tax benefits of Florida vs New York on the callahan contract. The tax benefits certainly aren't insignificant but they aren't as much as people would expect because athlete get taxed by each state they play in. I think for callahan it was about 500k or so at the most in savings. So we are probably talking about less than a million for Stamkos. Like I said not insignificant, but I bet you can get more shilling for Tim Hortons or Loblaws or TD Bank."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,2,Thu Jun 18 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"500k is pretty big when a third to a half of their total contract is being lost in taxes, union dues, agent fees, etc. I think Cally for example would pocket about 3 million on his current deal if it was in NY, but it's now 3.5m down in FL.  At least I feel like that's what I read in regards to that same situation you're referencing."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,andrewthemexican,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:05:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt he's paying that much in taxes next year.  http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/05/19/Supreme-Court-rules-Marylands-double-taxation-unconstitutional/1731432034496/   WASHINGTON, May 19 (UPI) -- The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Maryland's income tax law, allowing the state to double-tax residents who pay income tax in a different state where they work, is unconstitutional."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,ninjafaces,2,Sat Jun 20 01:34:13 2015 UTC,"I would be very happy with the PK contract.   You are right about the toronto comment. But, after watching the way players are hounded by NY fans in OUR arena, I cant imagine playing in a big market on a bad team."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MoreWeight,3,Thu Jun 18 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"I think he'll get 10. I personally don't know if I'd give him Toews/Kane money off the bat (I mean, those guys have won 3 cups). But close to it. 10 million/yr would be a good middle ground IMO.   This is assuming he won't take any ""hometown discount"" which we shouldn't assume anyways."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,csampson,2,Thu Jun 18 15:46:43 2015 UTC,"As others have said I'm going with $10 MM AAV as well. I'm pretty locked on that number, anything more and I'll be angry and anything less I will be pleased."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,SirThomas813,3,Thu Jun 18 20:23:11 2015 UTC,"I REALLY hope he resigns! If he does, I will celebrate by finally getting myself a Stamkos jersey."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,Talking_Monkey93,3,Thu Jun 18 18:28:52 2015 UTC,I don't think I could watch Stamkos play in another jersey.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MrUs,2,Thu Jun 18 20:28:31 2015 UTC,Does he sign?
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MrUs,18,Thu Jun 18 14:57:49 2015 UTC,"It would be dumb not to. If he wants a stanley cup, he is in the right place."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,coolman1581,14,Thu Jun 18 15:06:55 2015 UTC,Everything I have read and heard...Stammer loves this team. He loves the area...so I don't see any reason to believe he won't be a Bolt for a long time.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,CLXIX,6,Thu Jun 18 15:20:04 2015 UTC,"Thats good to know. We love him too. Like really love him  Like , REALLY REALLY love him.  I wish I was as badass as the stammer hammer."

TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MoreWeight,2,Thu Jun 18 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"I dont think its about will Stamkos sign. Its, will he sign for a reasonable cost? Huge contracts handcuff teams (see Pittsburg) and an 11 million dollar deal for Stamkos would do the same. For me its, will Stamkos accept a deal that Stevie Y is comfortable giving to him? Stevie is a bright guy and I dont think he will handcuff this team knowing what he has coming up in contracts in the next 3 years."

TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,csampson,3,Thu Jun 18 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"Nope, but depending who you ask, it's apparently easy to get rid of Kessel and Phaneuf and their giant contracts."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,3,Thu Jun 18 15:33:54 2015 UTC,"I love the Toronto fan guide to evaluating their own talent.  ""I hate this guy and his contract, someone should give me two 1sts and a top 6 forward for him."" They love the idea of trading Kadri for a superstar too."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,csampson,3,Thu Jun 18 16:07:08 2015 UTC,They're trying to save Babcock's life...  ...for the right price.

TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,3,Thu Jun 18 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sounds nice, but between the taxes and the extra year we can give him it is probably a pay cut you can measure in double digit millions."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,princelabia,2,Thu Jun 18 16:08:04 2015 UTC,Toronto media is ripping apart American Phil Kessel.....imagine the shit they would give Ontario boy
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,TampaFresh,2,Thu Jun 18 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"If he is signed to something like 8-9 million, thats a major success. Honestly, he deserves about 10 million but i'm sure the Yzerplan will come through"
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MoreWeight,2,Thu Jun 18 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"I am not sure he deserves 10. Yes, he is a wonderful player, but I am not convinced anyone is worth 10 million with the current cap. Kane and Towes will make 10.5 this upcoming season, and I suspect we will see the quality of their supporting cast quickly drop off (see Pittsburgh over the past 5 years. No depth). Will Stamkos get something like 10? Probably, give or take a million. But, I am not sure these huge contracts pay off. If the cap doesnt grow, it becomes very tough to sign some of Palat, Johnson, Killorn, Hedman, Kuch, or Drouin in the next few seasons."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,ClassicMach,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:19:23 2015 UTC,(see Pittsburgh over the past 5 years. No depth)   I think this has less to do with a salary crunch and more to do with management that's willing to trade Simon Despres for fucking Ben Lovejoy.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MoreWeight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"I was referring to their forward depth. Yes, that was bad, but they have had their depth devastated by cap crunch."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,ClassicMach,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:52:58 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that was meant to be one example of evidence that my personal opinion is that they could have done fine under the cap crunch, but they just made really poor decisions with what they had, rather than the cap being the problem itself. But that's just one man's taek."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,MoreWeight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"Well yes, that is a good example of them being poorly run. Their depth is attrocious due to poor management and cap issues related to star player contracts. Its a realy problem for good teams. Watch the Hawks over the next few years. Yeah, they have dropped star players after every cup and retooled well, but these new Kane/Toews contracts will take their cap problems to a new level."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,djlenin89,-1,Sat Jun 20 01:59:45 2015 UTC,"This worries me...I'm pretty sure that there is another priority.  We should be more worried about our return to the cup next year. Let us see one more playoff series, before we lock him into some kind of monstrous deal.   We saw what happened with Vinny. Stamkos lack of production in the post season may be a fluke. But wouldn't you like to be sure, before you go and give a guy the deal of a century? I would, especially for the steep price tag of 70-80 million.  I would rather us trade him sooner for future talent, rather than later buying out his contract. I know it's not a popular opinion, but it is something to think about in the coming months"
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,4,Thu Jun 18 21:00:32 2015 UTC,Vinny and Stamkos aren't really comparable. Stamkos is a 25 year old fitness fanatic who will be 33-34 when his next contract ends. Vinny was bought out because his idiotic OK hockey contract had us paying him till he was 40. With his injuries and the terrifying possibility of being hit with a team crippling recapture penalties they had no choice but to buy him out.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,ClassicMach,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:45:33 2015 UTC,Let us see one more playoff series   With actual free agency just on the horizon? No thank you.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,2,Fri Jun 19 16:34:57 2015 UTC,I think this reply was one off in the thread.  But I 100% agree with the sentiment.  Honestly if it came down to the trade deadline next season without him signed you would have to make a very difficult decision about what to do with him.
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,ClassicMach,2,Fri Jun 19 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"It was. But also Vinny got ruined when Matt Cooke almost killed him so, can't really put that on him.   But to ""wait for more playoffs"" is preposterous. There is no substance to this ""disappearance"" garbage people are talking. Stamkos hit about 10 posts in the final. Rotten luck for a great player. I have NO concerns about his abilities in the playoffs."
TampaBayLightning,3aa8d3,2ndprize,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Of our problems in the finals, his play wasn't one of them. He got the looks and made the moves. They didn't go in. Fucking hockey is hard."
TampaBayLightning,3aa4i0,SoonerinTampa,4,Thu Jun 18 13:00:12 2015 UTC,"I just hope they don't pay him too much, where they cannot afford to keep other key players on our team. I do hope he stays for a while, he's a monster."

That one doesn't have a ton of competition for being our best one ever.   Kuch is already our best 2nd round pick ever as well.   I think your assessment of Kuch is spot on but maybe a bit too wordy. Looking forward to the follow ups.

TampaBayLightning,3a8fve,andrewthemexican,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:57:50 2015 UTC,I've had my eye on Peca since I saw him I think at our 2013 prospect camp. Him and Drouin were on another level above everyone skillwise (with Drouin that extra above Peca).
TampaBayLightning,3a935g,tcigzies,4,Thu Jun 18 05:03:11 2015 UTC,Sooo...what did Cherry say about Stamkos?
TampaBayLightning,3a935g,armidilo01,3,Thu Jun 18 06:08:39 2015 UTC,Basically that Cooper disrespected Stamkos by playing other guys more than him and he didn't treat him like the superstar he is and that because of this Stammer was very unlikely to sign any extension with the Lightning. It was pretty much the exact opposite of what Stamkos said in this article.
TampaBayLightning,3a935g,mitchyd17,6,Thu Jun 18 11:14:45 2015 UTC,Basically Cherry is willing to make a mountain out of any molehill he can find if he can make a case for Stamkos to Toronto.
TampaBayLightning,3a935g,Squorn,3,Thu Jun 18 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"The article didn't even capture the best part.  In the interview he was asked about what Cherry said ""since they are friends"" and Stamkos was responded with something about meeting him a few guys and liking him but not being sure they were friends.   They asked Cooper about it too. Coop didn't seem to know about it but said he hope it wasn't too bad since he is a big fan of Cherry."
TampaBayLightning,3a935g,2ndprize,2,Thu Jun 18 12:14:40 2015 UTC,"he says here right after that, that theyre not ""friends"" and people can form their own opinions but nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors and theres nothing like that happening..."

TampaBayLightning,3a935g,trolololyork,2,Thu Jun 18 14:00:01 2015 UTC,No way. He is worth kane/toews money. 9.5 would be the lowest we keep him to help sign keep the young ones in a couple years.

TampaBayLightning,3a935g,confusedgeezer,2,Thu Jun 18 15:17:25 2015 UTC,The thing is Kane and toes got that money because they brought chi town some hardware . Don't get me wrong I love the guy and feel he is worth it but I think 9.5 is were it may end up
TampaBayLightning,3a935g,trolololyork,0,Thu Jun 18 16:05:31 2015 UTC,I agree with 9.5. I don't agree with the hopes for 8.5 in the original comet I replied to.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,KING522,15,Wed Jun 17 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"I think you mean Matt Fucking Carle. He's got a few defenders around here, but generally most people would trade him for a bag of pucks."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,angelsil,10,Wed Jun 17 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Robert Carle.  I have at times defended the Carle.  But there is no defending him left.  On ice performance aside, he needs to be moved becuase he makes too much money for his role in the lineup and we have too many up and coming prospects.  I mean what is the potential drop off of replacing him with Nesterov?"
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,7,Wed Jun 17 17:21:14 2015 UTC,I mean what is the potential drop off of replacing him with Nesterov?   Only an improvement in my liver function is seen.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,angelsil,2,Wed Jun 17 17:24:22 2015 UTC,I defend the guy and think he's better than his rep is...  ...and I still hope we trade him. We need to ditch that contract and get a guy like Koekkoek up here to develop. We have enough veteran leadership on D without him.   At least Sam Gagner is off the books now!
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,csampson,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"Ahhh man,  he's why I started liking Tampa Bay.  I never really watched hockey,  but I bought NHL 15 on PS4 when it was released since there was no other game.  Carle was the cheapest good defender I could get and he played better than all my other defenders.  And to think,  I consider The Bruins before I joined the jockey sub and bought Carle's card on NHL."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,WilliamTheGnome,11,Thu Jun 18 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"Carle and his contract have definitely worn out their welcome, but I think a large part of Carle's poor play has to do with his partner - Sustr was a trainwreck every damn time the puck was within a stone's throw."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,jamesEkrueger,5,Wed Jun 17 18:34:50 2015 UTC,I used to say we just need to find the right partner for Matt Carle.  At this point I think the right partner is going to be a guy in a coyotes or edmonton jersey.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,5,Wed Jun 17 19:39:22 2015 UTC,"Hey easy there. As a Yotes fan, we don't want him either."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,LoneWolfComando,2,Wed Jun 17 21:52:01 2015 UTC,The guy actually has played well with a strong d partner. You guys need to replace some bodies there. We can take that Hanzal guy off your hands for him.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,2,Wed Jun 17 22:02:30 2015 UTC,Hahaha just our first line center? Sure thing!
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,LoneWolfComando,2,Wed Jun 17 22:09:06 2015 UTC,Oh damn I didn't realize he was your 1C. I'm generally not that delusional I'm just fantasizing about getting a faceoff guy.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,4,Wed Jun 17 22:28:20 2015 UTC,Yeah he's more like a 2C but we have no center depth. And you can have Vitale!  He murders in the dot.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,LoneWolfComando,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:33:04 2015 UTC,"Carle for Ekman-Larsson would be an interesting trade, although the Bolts would have to sweeten the deal a bit to get him."

TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,FireballCaptor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"when coburn has been healthy, he and carle have actually looked like a pretty decent pairing for the few shifts i've seen them play together."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,InFlamesWeTrust,4,Thu Jun 18 02:10:48 2015 UTC,Drop him and his 5.5 mil / year and make room in the cap for a better defense man.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,n_noto,2,Wed Jun 17 18:50:39 2015 UTC,yes but how do we accomplish that?
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,3,Wed Jun 17 19:45:52 2015 UTC,He has to go.  It is pure economics at this point.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,2,Wed Jun 17 17:21:52 2015 UTC,Doesn't he have some sort of modified no trade clause? What's that like and how easy to get around it?
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,jnkiejim,7,Wed Jun 17 18:40:06 2015 UTC,Yup. Going to be challenging to get him gone. I see something going down like we did with Brewer. Just start pressboxing him until he agrees to a trade. The difference is I think Brewer actually had more drive than Carle. Carle's level of effort frequently suggests it's just a paycheck for him.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,angelsil,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:52:24 2015 UTC,Is it a full no trade clause though? Or does he just get to veto a list of teams?
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,jnkiejim,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"I believe it is a full NTC, but I can't swear that."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,angelsil,3,Wed Jun 17 19:24:25 2015 UTC,Capgeek had it as a modified.  No one knows what the modifier is.  Yzerman seems to be able to work around them thus far though.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,2,Wed Jun 17 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried about his -10. The problem with Carle, besides his cap hit and NTC, is that he makes people worse when he's out there.   I've tried picking through stats to defend him, because if you look at his individual numbers, they aren't terrible. Actually, they're pretty decent, probably worthy of a maybe second, definitely third pair defenseman.  But he's being paid like a top pair defenseman, and that's it. He's eating up cap space and he's not making others around him better.  A lot are actually worse when he's there. It's not as bad as Coburn's effect on those around him, but you'd like to see that players got better, not worse, when one of your most expensive players is on the ice."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,fuckyouabunch,2,Wed Jun 17 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"I was more upset with his deployment than how he played. I think Carle-Sustr should have been playing like Timonen and Culminski, like 8 minutes a night. Like others have said, Carle needs to be traded because we can't be paying 5.5 million for a fifth defensemen. I think it's going to be hard to trade him though. No one is going to want an old defensemen with one year left on his contract that isn't worth his salt anymore."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,Robert_The_Tire,2,Wed Jun 17 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, if only he only had one year left. Motherfucker is signed through2017-18 season witha modified no-trade:  http://www.generalfanager.com/players/1781"
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,fuckyouabunch,3,Wed Jun 17 21:16:44 2015 UTC,Oh shit. I thought he was gone after next year. He could actually help teams that are trying to make the cap floor.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,Robert_The_Tire,2,Wed Jun 17 22:22:42 2015 UTC,He has a no-trade clause and we're stuck with him until 2018.  He did had a couple games in the post season where he had a decent game.  He is one of the few people I scream at when he screws up though.  edit: I scanned through and didn't see it until after my post.  Sorry for the double info.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,Mauldrich,2,Wed Jun 17 22:25:08 2015 UTC,I would love to see him dealt and slater koekkoek brought up!!
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,--Sharpe--,2,Thu Jun 18 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"You must be new around here...  I kid, but seriously, most of us are pretty vocal about how we feel about Carle. The majority of us are not a big fan of the guy and find that he is simply not worth his price, especially with him not being able to hold a consistent top 4 spot."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,OGHamToast,2,Thu Jun 18 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"out with carle. he cause way more bad situations than he solved in the regular season, and didnt contribute in the post season. he cant help us move forward next year and we could use some extra cap space."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,tcigzies,2,Thu Jun 18 03:57:42 2015 UTC,"You should shit in one hand and receive trade offers for Carle in the other and see which fills up first. It is impossible to trade him. He has a PNTC and a hefty price tag.   Also, I don't know if you remember when he was injured, but those were bad times. We survived, sure, but when he came back we definitely played better. Imo he passed the eye test. We have defensive prospects on the way (a lot of them). Deangelo, Koekkoek, Masin, McLeod, Witkowski, Nesterov ate the cream of the crop, but none of them will surpass Carle on the depth charts before his contract is up.  Carle is here to stay and that's just how the cookie crumbles."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,armidilo01,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:04:21 2015 UTC,"I'd trade him in a heartbeat, but his contract says otherwise. No GM will want him, unless they have a lot of money for a guy who can play 5/6 D."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,TampaFresh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:42:46 2015 UTC,Not everyone is as deep as we are. I'm sure there's a couple teams out there he could play on a second pair.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,SNl9ER,-4,Wed Jun 17 23:30:27 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who's tired of hearing about Carle, and him not being worth the money?"
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,kylieigh,9,Wed Jun 17 17:59:26 2015 UTC,If he was a really good defenseman we wouldn't be complaining... He can move the puck and does some decent things but he makes terrible decisions ALL the time and is a turnover machine. He can be a middle pair defenseman but he is barley playing well on the bottom pairing on our squad. That is laughable for 5.5 million a year.  Do we buy him out? Probably not. Can we trade him? Will be tough. Could see Yzerman trading picks and Carle to a weak defensive team as a salary dump or have to package another player like Bish or Flip which I would not like. Here's hoping he drinks some of that Swedish Koolade and gets a shit ton better this offseason.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,emotoaster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:12:47 2015 UTC,"He can move the puck and does some decent things but he makes terrible decisions ALL the time and is a turnover machine.

TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,kylieigh,5,Wed Jun 17 18:20:53 2015 UTC,I want both gone. Lol   Also Sustr looks like he can barley skate sometimes.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,emotoaster,3,Wed Jun 17 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Sustr is cheap and still relatively young for a defenseman. While I don't think he's going to get much better, it's easier to make a case for keeping him around."
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,angelsil,6,Wed Jun 17 19:25:47 2015 UTC,That and the fact that the team seems to have some sort of fascination with him.
TampaBayLightning,3a6m2r,2ndprize,9,Wed Jun 17 19:40:43 2015 UTC,Who isn't amazed by a skating giraffe?

I was looking forward to that game since the day we were eliminated and apparently the whole team was too.

I'd recently picked the Lightning to do well, but they looked flat and nearly dead. When Johnson turned that game around, I thought to myself, ""Man if they go the distance, that right there is the turning point."" It turned another disappointing exit into an amazing run. I'm so glad that I chose to watch them."

With the exception of Carle, our unneeded players will be gone very soon, who will probably be replaced with some of our top prospects you saw fill in the blanks during the season. That means cheaper contracts. Cheaper contracts allow more money to use on our bigger talent who have earned their place. 2017 will be a little hard given all the contracts that expire, but we aren't going to lose EVERYONE, so we'll pick and choose accordingly when the time  comes.   Basically, we are fine. Don't worry."

TampaBayLightning,3acenc,2ndprize,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:31:02 2015 UTC,"It irks me because anyone who has been following this team for any amount of time would realize that they're on the upswing. It comes across as though you are either trolling, or that you don't know about this team and are making assumptions based on losing in the SCF.   Another thing about your post is that you identify as a Stamkos fan and not a Lightning fan. That's all well and good, but you've got to understand that the vast majority of us are Lightning fans first and foremost. Sure, we like Stammer and don't want him to go, but if he does I don't think many of us will jump ship and get on board with where he ends up."

TampaBayLightning,3acenc,kylieigh,5,Fri Jun 19 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"Are you serious? If you're actually a fan of the team and know anything about them, then you would know that we probably have the widest window in the NHL currently. We are an incredibly young team with very little playoff experience prior to the past few months and we made it to game 6 of the SCF against arguably the best team in the world right now and a modern dynasty.   And how can you say that because we couldn't win in the final round that you don't think they can make it happen. Only one team can win each year but that doesn't mean that no other team can win in the following years. We're only getting better and with our young talent still under contract and now with more playoff experience we will be an incredible force to be reckoned with for a good number of years.   And finally, how can you say that you would stop supporting a team just because 1 player leaves. It sounds like you're a stamkos fan, not a Lightning fan, but more than anything a fare weather fan. If that's the case then stay out of this sub."

TampaBayLightning,3acenc,Claustrophobopolis,5,Fri Jun 19 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"You'll not be missed.   I get having a favorite player, but if your team allegiance changes that easily, you don't sound like much of a fan. Everyone wants to win, sure, but seemingly everyone else here has a different standard for loyalty. The decade-plus you've been watching the Bolts doesn't seem to have meant much if you're ready to pull up stakes if Stammer plays elsewhere.  And the fact that you don't understand the hate flowing your way is a bit astounding. You've gone well beyond lost faith into apathy, a rat deserting a ship that is nowhere near sinking.  Best of luck with whichever fanbase you end up with next."
TampaBayLightning,3acenc,millionaremattdavis,8,Fri Jun 19 15:37:32 2015 UTC,Fuck off dude. No one important on the team is leaving. Which means an even greater chance at making the playoffs and SCF next year.

Since I started cheering for them in 2006 I've seen more rough seasons than good ones and never once have I considered switching teams. If you only care about cheering for a winning team than join the Blackhawks bandwagon but that's not how it works.   If you're a Lightning fan, you're a Lightning fan through thick and thin. This was the second best season to be a Lightning fan in the history of the team and it was amazing seeing what they did this year.   From what you're saying it doesn't sound like you've been a team for very long because this is the most competitive the team has been in the last 10 years."

TampaBayLightning,3a3ejb,Squeaky_Is_Evil,11,Wed Jun 17 00:18:46 2015 UTC,Me too man. The article posted earlier today that recounted the player's reactions to hearing the celebrations while they were in the locker room actually had me tearing up a bit. The one that really got to me was Drouin sobbing into a towel.  God dammit I'm depressed again. I hope seeing all of their fans lifted their spirits.
TampaBayLightning,3a3ejb,Squeaky_Is_Evil,8,Wed Jun 17 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yea I wish I hadn't read that article. I was doing ok until I did. Drouin and Stamkos hurt the most. I think next season will be our year. They want it more than ever now, and won't let this chance get past them again."

TampaBayLightning,3a3ejb,LogicBelongsToThem,6,Wed Jun 17 03:11:48 2015 UTC,"Everything about it just makes me sad. Drouin sobbing, Bishop holding his head in his hands, Paquette slamming his helmet into the ground, Stralman in shock, Stamkos on the verge of tears, Hedman walking around hugging everyone he can.  It all just makes me so sad for them. We wanted the cup and we're bummed out, but this is so much worse for them. They're emotionally devastated.   I just want to give them all hugs. :("
TampaBayLightning,3a3ejb,LogicBelongsToThem,2,Wed Jun 17 03:34:30 2015 UTC,"The fact that they all care so much, and even Drouin who hardly played was crying... They're going to be hungry next year. It hurts for us now, but I'm hoping it will turn into hurt for the rest of the league next year."

TampaBayLightning,3a1wy1,RedSnapperVeryTasty,37,Tue Jun 16 16:18:04 2015 UTC,What makes me feel better is knowing that Stamkos is only 25 and Hedman is only 24.
TampaBayLightning,3a1wy1,noobiepoobie,2,Tue Jun 16 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"I know I am going to get downvoted to hell, but Toews and Kane are 27 and 26.  Unlike what happened with Philly and Boston, you guys CLEARLY are at the start of your championship window.  Resign Stamkos and continue to develop players.  Identify the core and continue to use your minor league system to replace talent.  Bishop is a warrior with how he played this off season, but you clearly have a special goal waiting for his shot too.  I would not be shocked if the Hawks and the Bolts met again in the finals within a few years (maybe even next year)."

Rangers and Detroit are definitely tough to deal with, but I'm just thankful as fuck we didn't have to deal with Pittsburgh. Worst fans in the league by far."

I went on their sub earlier just out of curiosity, and its just a cesspool of hate on how Tyjo is a bitch, how shitty of a coach Cooper is. I just kinda feel bad because after what, half a month and they are still in an angry circlejerk mode. Obviously some of them don't participate, but like if you look at MTL's sub they just kinda talk about draft picks and contracts, nothing like NYR."
TampaBayLightning,3a3sgp,TampaFresh,3,Wed Jun 17 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"NYR>DET>CHI>MTL for me. I actually had to moderate more Chicago fans than any team, but it was balanced by a much larger number of rational fans. New York didn't have very many of those."
TampaBayLightning,3a3sgp,angelsil,4,Wed Jun 17 03:40:36 2015 UTC,I think the big difference is that Habs fans actually know stuff about hockey. Rangers fans seem to thing putting a Rangers jersey on makes that player better than everyone else.

Literally, we won the ECF and those blowhards spent the first 15 minutes dissecting how horrible it was that the Rangers lost and what they should have done better so that NBC wouldn't be forced to cover a final with Tampa playing. It was very frustrating to watch as a fan.  Don't get me started on Pierre. I guess we just don't have anyone he wants to blow."

Might never get another shot. Boyle/Stralman with back to back SCF appearances and nothing to show. Stamkos, oh man."
TampaBayLightning,3a1pf2,ItIsNotAdamCopeland,5,Tue Jun 16 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"This hasn't hurt me as much as I thought it would, and I think it's for a couple different reasons (random order - no relevance to the ranking)  1 - I thought the Lightning were better than any team in the East. They justified that. I would take their roster over almost anyone in the West, too. The one team I wouldn't? Chicago. So the Lightning lost to the one team I felt was better than them. I would've been pissed if Anaheim had beaten Tampa Bay, because I don't think Anaheim was the better team at all. Despite that, I still wanted Chicago in the SCF, because I did feel the matchup would be better on the eyes, and for the sport. I think that was justified.  2 - 354:50 out of 360:00 minutes were played inside a -1 to +1 goal margin. The Lightning took that one superior team and played them to some extremely tight margins. A bounce here or there could've made a total difference. When the margins are that tight, variance takes over. Variance favored the 'Hawks. And so it goes. Trust me - we weren't kvetching about variance (whether we realized it or not) when the Habs kept hitting iron in the 2nd round. It helped us then. It hurt us now. Oh well.  3 - Corey Crawford stopped 82 out of 84 shots in the final three games, and even his high danger S% was stellar, too, so it wasn't just weak shot after weak shot he was stopping. While I do think Chicago did a good job of limiting the Lightning to some one-and-dones in the O-zone, there was still a breakaway that Crawford denied on Stamkos, a stellar save on the late PP, a few chances late in Game 5 with TB on the run, and think of the two goals he did give up, one-timers set up off ridiculous feeds to low areas, and...just give him his due credit. Vasi and Bishop played very well in the final three games of this series. Crawford just played better. Crawford probably had the best 180 minutes of his career, all things considered. Goalies enter zones sometimes. Getting the Craw from the first round would've been nicer. Oh well.  4 - Did the Lightning, to borrow a terrible cliché, ""leave it all on the ice"" last night? If the answer to that question is yes, then there's nothing to have any regrets about. The Lightning played their hearts out. Sometimes that's not enough. As long as they can say they did everything they could, then there's nothing to lament.   5 - The Blackhawks are a modern day dynasty. There is absolutely no shame in losing to that team. You hope Seabrook put it best last night, when he said that the Lightning are primed to accomplish what the 'Hawks have in the past six seasons. With the East as open as it is, and the Atlantic especially, there's no reason to think the Lightning can't get back to this round in future seasons. Trust the Lightning's roster. Objectively, you'll like it more than almost any other roster you find in the NHL, and surely in the East.  It sucks, but if they had to lose to anyone, I'm glad it was the 'Hawks. I admire the hell out of that team and organization. I couldn't grow to hate them at all in this series. The Lightning have their blueprint for success. I would love to see the Lightning face the 'Hawks in the Stanley Cup Final again in 2015-'16. No reason it can't happen."
TampaBayLightning,3a1pf2,LogicBelongsToThem,3,Wed Jun 17 01:11:16 2015 UTC,"I dont know man, it was a lot of mistakes made from tampa both yesterday and Saturday. Goalies colliding with team in places they should not be in the first place, passes to the other team, etc.   I could not have done better, but tampa did play much better than this earlier in the season. Dont know what the fuck happened."
TampaBayLightning,3a1pf2,Clemburger,2,Tue Jun 16 21:10:59 2015 UTC,For some reason I wasn't as upset as I was in after game 7 scf against boston in 2010. I guess because of the experience factor.

By the end of the previous three series I fucking hated the teams we were playing - they had some shitty players, made some dirty plays, etc. I was rooting for you through the first three series and I was really glad we were paired against you. They were clean, skilled, and evenly matched games. There was not one moment in this series where I was comfortable - seriously, not until the horn sounded in game 6 did I count you out. Hell of a series."

Most of us woke up this morning hoping it was all a dream and now our days I'm sure have just felt melancholy (at least mine has) you guys are a good team. I'm just glad we were able to shut down kane and toews. I wish you guys the best of luck next year as I see the front office probably not being able to keep the team totally intact. I'm sure if things pan out for you guys you'll see us again. I feel like the lightning (if we can stay healthy deep in a playoff run) will be the next dynasty.

At the end of the day, just getting far into the playoffs isn't much to brag about. In the NHL, you either win the cup or you don't. Learning to win is hard and takes a lot of time. This is just another step in building this franchise into a perennial contender. A painful one given how close we got.  With that said though, congrats on your team winning and enjoy the festivities. I'd love to give Toews a high five but all that hardware on his hand might weigh him down.   I'm about ready to enjoy my summer with no anxiety and stress so hey, go me, woo."
TampaBayLightning,3a1mt9,Vulcan2422,4,Tue Jun 16 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"they just seem empty vessels to remind the other team who won.   well, that's not the intent here.  I've suffered through so many dark years with this Blackhawks team that I can empathize. I just thought that especially based on what I saw in /r/hockey and how I'd compare various teams fanbases and their behaviors, some stick taps were well deserved over here.  That, and I thought it might be nice to be reminded during a rough day that you guys have a lot to look forward to in the next few years.   At the end of the day, just getting far into the playoffs isn't much to brag about. In the NHL, you either win the cup or you don't.   I don't agree with this at all. This ""second place is the first loser"" attitude brought to society by ""No Fear"" t-shirts, etc, is something I can't get behind at all.  With that attitude, every student except the valedictorian is a useless piece of shit. Every CEO of a company that makes less than any other company is ineffective and not worthy of any praise. Every construction worker who hammers one less nail than his coworker meant nothing to the construction of that building.  That attitude is corrosive and just wrong, in my opinion.  The Tampa Bay Lightning have a lot to be proud of, and I hope that most of their fans understand that."
TampaBayLightning,3a1mt9,TSTMWKU,0,Tue Jun 16 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"You make quite a leap of logic from:   In the NHL, you either win the cup or you don't.   to:   With that attitude, every student except the valedictorian is a useless piece of shit. Every CEO of a company that makes less than any other company is ineffective and not worthy of any praise. Every construction worker who hammers one less nail than his coworker meant nothing to the construction of that building.   I didn't say any of that nor implied as much. Chicago wouldn't be considered a dynasty if they were runner ups for 3 of those 6 years.  I don't need a fanbase of another team to tell me to be proud. I've been behind the Bolts since day ONE. I know our boys battled hard and they gave us Bolts fans really good hockey (you talk about dark days as if we didn't have our own). Of course we are all proud of them. We don't need Blackhawks fans telling us the same.  But if anyone is content with losing in the SC finals, then we've already failed. See the 09 Penguins. This TB team is gearing up to win a Stanley Cup. Not be content with past laurels.  Also, not sure if this is an age thing, but   his ""second place is the first loser"" attitude brought to society by ""No Fear"" t-shirts, etc, is something I can't get behind at all.   ?"

Knocking out the Rangers was my healing factor for the St. Louis trade and hearING they might not keep him is even better. We have an amazing team and you can only go so far with injured players and it shows. It's always a what if this, what of that.

If we had won last night, we would have set the record for most number of playoff games played. That takes a toll on you as a team. Playoff hockey is brutal. Next year's focus should be on trying to close out series before they get to game 6 and 7 to try an keep guys healthy longer.   I don't feel bad at all for the guys. Fuck, we got a new banner!"

TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,SoonerinTampa,4,Tue Jun 16 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"I think he'll get some time in Tampa, but I imagine he'll spend most of the season in Syracuse barring a major injury or him overachieving. His shoulder surgeries have him at least a season behind in development and he could use some more time in the AHL. Especially if we can actually hold together a team up there."
TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,angelsil,3,Tue Jun 16 14:37:36 2015 UTC,Thanks...I assume DeAnglo (sp?) will be on the roster next yr? Maybe a year away still?
TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,Lambss,5,Tue Jun 16 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think DeAngelo is ready for the NHL yet. The organization has shown repeatedly they want guys to mature in the minors and AHL.

What he needs to do is tether himself to someone like Stamkos for the entire summer and work on rounding out his game.

TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,fuckyouabunch,5,Tue Jun 16 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"I say let him go.  Nesterov can fill that role with better offense and in my opinion is a more physical Dman.  I hate seeing all 6'8"" of Sustr skate around and poke check everyone to death.  Take the damn body man.   I also would be ok with Carle being traded.  Barberio performed pretty well this year during his time up with the club, and with Koekkoek and DeAngelo developing in Syracuse I think we're in good shape.  I could even see trading Carle and Coburn honestly, but I'd keep one just for depth. I'd like to see this for pairings:  Hedman - Stralman Garrison - Coburn Barberio - Nesterov Koekkoek"
TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,Mauldrich,5,Tue Jun 16 14:52:42 2015 UTC,"How are you supposed to take the body if you're 6'8"" and 125 pounds?  I think Calre is unmoveable before the trade deadline, at best. $5.5M/yr is fucking brutal for him."
TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,showers_with_grandpa,3,Tue Jun 16 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but he needs 30 lbs and then needs to get more physical.    Not sure who Carle swindled into that deal, but kudos to him agent for that move.  Damn that's brutal..."

TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,Always_Sunnyvale,2,Tue Jun 16 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Barberio. It's a shame, he seemed to have so much potential, but every time he turned around he got burned."
TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,4,Tue Jun 16 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"I imagine he will get a shot somewhere else, but Nesterov has clearly passed him on the depth chart and Koekkoek has way more potential."
TampaBayLightning,3a15oh,showers_with_grandpa,4,Tue Jun 16 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"Here's a look at our cap situation. ""Cap Payroll"" just sounds like the amount of the payroll that counts against the cap. Some things don't count or count completely, like players on Long Term Injured Reserve. That gets very tricky to understand. But for us the only person affected is Mattias Ohlund.  The cap is expected to be about $71M next season, but there's a possibility that the players' union might push it up by $5M more with a one time special-use clause in the CBA. If they do that, almost no one is in serious cap space trouble immediately. It's once offer sheets start flying around that the cap space problems will start back up.  It's also expected that we will re-sign Stamkos this offseason, and likely with a huge contract that will piss off /u/angelsil to no end. At the same time, though, we'll be looking to unload a few other contracts. The nicest thing about our situation is that we have no UFAs (that get regular time with the Lightning, anyway) besides Morrow and not too many RFAs. We might be able to make a few moves to make a little more space to play with, as well.   Braydon Coburn is currently at $4.5M against the cap, with a year left on his contract. That's decent trade bait for a team looking for a defenseman. Matt Carle is more problematic, with his $5.5M/year hit for the next three years.  And now I've answered way more than you wanted to know, because clearly I'm not ready to stop talking about hockey."

TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,ThatDamnWalrus,8,Fri Jun 19 07:43:30 2015 UTC,People need to fucking drop it honestly. We played against the best hockey team in the world and made it to six games.  Everyone is emotional and needs to look back and be happy for what we accomplished. Cooper did well leading our team to this point. Mistakes were made and has now turned into an experience.
TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,coolman1581,4,Fri Jun 19 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"It's been on my mind too. Cooper said he never expected to be the coach that lost the cup. I think that might show you what mind set he was in. He seemed careless. Which is a word I would hate to use on Cooper, but it fits. I hated how he used Johnson too. He has a lot of trust in Johnson, so I kind of get it, but he should of used Stamkos' shot more. It took him until Game 6 for him to start using Stamkos' shot. I think it's because Cooper doesn't want Stamkos to be a one trip pony, but I don't know...  And if you'll looking for something else to (maybe) get mad at, there's the 2 dinners, and baseball games he went to before each game in Chicago. I know you're allowed to have fun in the SCF, and not just be all business, but what's wrong with being all business? It seemed to work with Detroit when Yzerman was captain. Hell, Hedman barely showed any emotions just a game plan, and looked how he played. From what I've heard it's a lot more fun winning the cup. You didn't hear it from me though."
TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,kylieigh,7,Wed Jun 17 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say he did well (3rd year coach loses to the best team in the last decade in the SCF). The best thing to take away from this experience, is the experience. If we stay healthy and keep this team, Coopers gonna hang banners in Amalie."
TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,MrUs,4,Tue Jun 16 23:01:32 2015 UTC,More banners. We have already earned one.
TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,scp333,5,Wed Jun 17 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to get mad about the dinners and stuff.  It sounds like Cooper has a pretty regular routine as far as how he spends the off time.  I have no doubt he puts so many hours into his job that it would make me feel like a lazy bitch.  I know that I have to step away from my work from time to time in order to be effective.  Maybe he needs the same.  He lost in the Final, but he has an impressive resume as far as coaching goes."
TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,kylieigh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:11:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like with what the players have to go threw, if they did this they would get it from the media. While Cooper didn't. You want that solidarity from your coach. If that makes any sense.   I'm with you though. I'm not going to get mad at him for being him. Just putting the argument out there"
TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,angelsil,2,Wed Jun 17 00:04:48 2015 UTC,"Cooper said he never expected to be the coach that lost the cup.    That bothered me as well. It was like he expected to win. A certain level of confidence is well and good, but at some point it becomes hubris."

TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,djlenin89,2,Wed Jun 17 01:29:35 2015 UTC,"This is true, especially when you beat the Red Wings, Habs, and then the Rangers in MSG on Game 7. We literally did the impossible. Plus with his success in the lower leagues, it's hard not to be that confidant.  This is a lesson Coop will never forget about the pro level. Never take anything for granted! Even if you make the Finals, you throw everything else out the window. Simply because, everything else doesn't matter! You can never underestimate your opponent in the Finals. This end result, is the proof in the pudding."

TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,TIFUByJoiningReddit,2,Wed Jun 17 12:19:18 2015 UTC,"For me it's difficult to say anything bad about Cooper. Like the rest of the team he's learning and he made a lot of brilliant moves that went unnoticed. He exited his comfort zone to save the season after game 5 in the Detroit series. Throughout the Habs and Rangers series he played around with 11 forwards so that other teams couldn't line match against our best guys. In the finals he had Pacquette on Toews since game 1, a decision that didn't seem to make much sense but the second the puck dropped it worked like a charm.   I'm not saying he didn't make mistakes, because he did, but we have to accept the good with the bad. He's learned from this entire experience as much or more than anyone else on the team and will use what he's learned going into next season."
TampaBayLightning,3a3cto,TIFUByJoiningReddit,4,Wed Jun 17 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"Im still very pro cooper.  That one there was just tumbling around in my brain for hours.  You have a guy learning to take faceoffs in the finals against a good faceoff team to keep a broken line together.    The Paquette thing is interesting, I think Ceddy played hard but by game 6 Toews had him figured out.  The kid went like 0-13 in the faceoff circle that night.    I posted this and everyone is taking it as anti-cooper (i could have done a better job on the headline.  But no one has really commented on the decision.  I can see it being a tactical one before Chicago had noticed the injury but that was all pretty clear by game 3."
TampaBayLightning,3a2omi,fuckyouabunch,9,Tue Jun 16 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"Luckily I work right by the jet way so I skipped out of work to go see if I could get some autographs.  The boys were awesome and were signing everything.  The only signatures I didn't get were TJ, Bishop, Brown, Drouin, and Coop but I was farther down the line.  It was really hot so a few of the guys in full three piece suits peeled off after a few.  Stammer, Hedman, and Boyle were out there the entire time signing everything and taking pictures though.  Overall everyone was awesome and super friendly.  I felt bad for Morrow, it looked like someone kicked his puppy but he was signing everything.  Kristers Gudlevskis was out there as well signing stuff so I tried to put in a good word for /u/angelsil."
TampaBayLightning,3a2omi,statix138,6,Tue Jun 16 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"I felt bad for Morrow. It looked like someone kicked his puppy, but he was signing everything.   I'm a Texan, so if I see Morrow retire without a cup I'm going to cry. The picture of him holding up the cup in my head isn't enough. I know y'all aren't a fan of him, but I don't care. Morrow during his run in Dallas played very similar to how Callahan plays now. I think that says it all."
TampaBayLightning,3a2omi,kylieigh,6,Tue Jun 16 20:43:22 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say all of us aren't a fan of his.  I really like Morrow and respect the hell out of him and his career.  He was the guy who paid his dues and I really wanted to see hold up the cup.  While I doubt we will see him with the Bolts next season I hope he ends up somewhere and has another deep run.
TampaBayLightning,3a2omi,statix138,2,Tue Jun 16 20:54:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think anybody dislikes Morrow himself, it's just that he didn't have anything left in the tank this season. Nothing but respect for the guy and his character, but we probably could have used someone else in his place on the actual ice."
TampaBayLightning,3a2omi,angelsil,5,Wed Jun 17 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"Appreciated! I saw some photos of him and had instant regret for not ditching my horrible workday and going down there. Then again, I don't want to be a stalker ;-)"

You could tell they were ready to go home, but so willing to spend time with the fans. We have a real world class team to cheer for.

Red wings, Blackhawks, etc.   We need to figure out what makes that happen over this off season if we want to really make our case for the cup."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,SinisterTitan,7,Tue Jun 16 05:25:15 2015 UTC,Pick up Vermette in the off season. That guy was a faceoff magician for a lot of the playoffs.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,titsforhits,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:00:01 2015 UTC,Totally agree
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,chihawks,2,Tue Jun 16 17:51:49 2015 UTC,It didn't help that Johnson was injured.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,jhnybgood47,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"This right here. Lots of factors but that was hands down the biggest imo. Palat, a man who hasn't taken more than maybe 2-3 faceoffs a game all year has to take all of them for a line."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Cats_and_hedgehogs,63,Wed Jun 17 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"Two combined goals over a critical three game stretch of the series cost the Bolts the Cup.  You can talk all you want about Chicago's defense, but the Bolts had plenty of great scoring chances over the past three games (and especially tonight), but simply could not convert any of them.  One goal efforts when you have a chance to take a 3-1 or 3-2 series lead simply isn't going to get it done."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Geddyn,45,Tue Jun 16 02:57:19 2015 UTC,Crawford had some amazing saves.  You can't beat a brick wall.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,chris84bond,17,Tue Jun 16 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"It was like watching a great soccer goalie. He only got called on for about 3 great saves per game because of ace defense in front of him, but he made every single one."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,ClassicMach,11,Tue Jun 16 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"Crawford did make some great saves, but it's also undeniable that the Bolts simply could not capitalize on what should have been freebies.  In tonight's game, for example, Stralman completely missed the puck on a slapshot when the net was wide open. And, if Stamkos was his usual (non-playoff) self, he would have easily converted that breakaway chance."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Geddyn,6,Tue Jun 16 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"While this is true, you have to also remember the Hawks had a lot of excellent scoring opportunities during the last three games as well that they missed.   I feel like Tampa had more, but the Hawks were not without their missed opportunities as well. Either way, like you said, 2 goals in 3 games is unacceptable. But hey, there's always next season, the future looks good"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Devils_-_Advocate,7,Tue Jun 16 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, Chicago played okay. But the Bolts fell flat on their faces. I saw a team I didn't recognize.  I guess, in the end, they just got tired."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,lazybrouf,47,Tue Jun 16 03:02:11 2015 UTC,Don't say that. Your team played some damn good hockey. Be proud.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,pinrow,13,Tue Jun 16 03:19:30 2015 UTC,Have you watching the whole season? I'm proud of their season. I'm proud of this series. I'm not proud of their performance in this series.  I want to stress that I'm proud of this team. But this series was not even close to the hockey we've seen all season.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,lazybrouf,15,Tue Jun 16 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with you, I think it has to be taken into consideration that the Eastern Conference is not nearly as top heavy as the West."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,BearSausage,5,Tue Jun 16 03:44:39 2015 UTC,"They were just beat the fuck up and out of gas, it sucks that they went out like that but I legitimately think that's the biggest reason we lost this series."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,HollowImage,4,Tue Jun 16 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"exhaustion man. you guys played so many more games on the way, that even with us playing 4.5 defensemen, the fatigue and injuries caught up.  _/  well see you next year."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Mc3lnosher,2,Tue Jun 16 07:39:12 2015 UTC,We should have put away Detroit well before 7 and Montreal shouldn't have made it to 6. The team could use a little more killer instinct and a little less backs-against-the-wall showmanship.  Would have lead to fresher legs and less injuries.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Squorn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:36:56 2015 UTC,We can be very disappointed and very proud at the same time.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,MrSantaClause,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"You probably haven't watched them all season/playoffs leading up to this series.  They always bury their easy chances...the past 3 games they should have had 3-4 goals in each game easy and just couldn't figure out a way to put the puck in the net.  They played great hockey all season, along with this series.  Not finishing their easy chances is not characteristic of them though."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,ScaresCrows,3,Tue Jun 16 04:48:36 2015 UTC,Everyone does this though. If we didn't miss our easy goals the Hawks would have won games that we lost against you and vice versa. That's hockey.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,imonlyaman,4,Tue Jun 16 13:54:38 2015 UTC,"As a Leafs fan I was rooting so hard for you guys. You had a couple broken players but still took it to 6 games against the Hawks. It was a fun ride watching you guys from the beginning and you've got nothing to hang your heads about. The Rangers series was my favourtie out of all of them. Thanks for the good times, Go Bolts!"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Khue,19,Tue Jun 16 05:16:46 2015 UTC,"Plenty of opportunities. Terrible capitalization. Stralman had one, Stamkos had 2, Kucherov had 2... Very aggravating to watch, but fuck it was a good series and overall a good year. Can't be disappointed."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,BrazilianRider,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"I mean... I'm still disappointed.   Also, maybe me being sour grapes, but how'd we only get one PP?"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Mc3lnosher,2,Tue Jun 16 03:12:23 2015 UTC,"I wont argue the two boneheaded undisciplined penalties we took, those were completely justified.  But after calling the trip after the faceoff on paquette, I really felt like there were plenty of times they could have called a similar penalty on Chicago before it was 2-0 with 3 mins left."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Squeaky_Is_Evil,35,Tue Jun 16 13:44:36 2015 UTC,"Considering what happened last season, this is a hell of an improvement. Great season Bolts, see you in a stronger season in a few months."

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,chos3n94,36,Tue Jun 16 02:58:28 2015 UTC,What a frustrating loss. Chicago stonewalled the crap out of us and they definitely earned the cup. GG Hawks.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,emotoaster,15,Tue Jun 16 02:59:51 2015 UTC,GG everyone. So proud of this team and the good news is that the team should get better and better next year. STANLEY WILL GET A TAN AND STAMMER WILL LIFT THAT CUP UP EVENTUALLY! I BELIEVE!
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,TheCenterOfEnnui,16,Tue Jun 16 02:58:04 2015 UTC,Congrats to Chicago on the Cup. A more physical team....hopefully we'll learn from this and come back. The future's bright...no reason to be down except for tonight.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Zephyrkills,30,Tue Jun 16 03:01:58 2015 UTC,That was sad. Can't really say much else.  Massive failures from needed players all evening. Puck seemed to go everywhere but in.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Aceoangels,7,Tue Jun 16 02:57:30 2015 UTC,Probably more shots wide than on net. It was pretty sad
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,retro_falcon,4,Tue Jun 16 03:42:26 2015 UTC,Like the last 2 games. We had plenty of opportunities we just couldn't convert. That stamkos breakaway about sums up the whole series.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Broductivity,14,Tue Jun 16 03:47:22 2015 UTC,This wasn't meant to be our year. Another year of development for us though. Hopefully watching this loss will motivate them to come back even better next year
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,jdubs222,14,Tue Jun 16 02:56:11 2015 UTC,"The boys just looked dead at the end of games 5 and 6. Slow skating, really poor puck handling, desperate passing and shooting. Also you have to be able to bury opportunities at the beginning of the game. Sometimes it's just bad luck, but sometimes you just have to get the puck over Corey Crawford's pad. Man, I need a drink."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Veranique,12,Tue Jun 16 03:04:44 2015 UTC,I just wanted to come here and say what an amazing team you guys have here. I cant wait to play you guys next year.  I'm seriously sorry about the loss. Solidarity.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,heppiss,10,Tue Jun 16 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"You duckbros are good people. It was amazing seeing us three, the ones who play hokey just how it's supposed to be played modern day. (By us three meaning you, us, and the amazing Blackhawks who definitely earned every piece of the Stanley Cup) I'm very much looking forward to oncoming 2-4 years. I hope to see Ducks, Hawks, and Bolts all fighting for the cup next year as well! Of course it sucks to lose a final which could have turned either way, but I'm feeling so happy, that even losing with The Lightning can feel so proud and actually not too bad. Hawks earned the cup as much as Bolts would have, if the series had turned other way. Congratulations to Blackhawks for the Cup! Thank you Ducks for sucking Chicago's tank nearly as empty as Rangers sucked ours, and a proud shout for every Lightning player and all Boltsbros across the world: GO BOLTS!"

Your guys team is fucking great, and will be an East Beast for years.  Now, can I say, Hedman is an absolute monster. Absolute stud, he's now one of my favorite players in the league. I have never been so impressed by such a young guy, jesus christ he completely changes your team."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Cats_and_hedgehogs,5,Tue Jun 16 03:06:25 2015 UTC,I love the combo of Hedman and stralhman on the ice together. With Stralhman always calm and Hedman's just massive size and physical play they combine for a dominant force.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,slothtastic24,9,Tue Jun 16 03:15:55 2015 UTC,"He threaded that freakin cross ice rope to Callahan in game 3, and my goddamn jaw dropped. He is unreal. That was basically a Love to Lebron outlet"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Cats_and_hedgehogs,2,Tue Jun 16 03:17:27 2015 UTC,He got the game winner in game 1 in overtime of the season on a pass from Bishop. It was glorious. If he hadn't been injured with a broken hand for months who knows what he could have done this year haha.

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,nameless22,9,Tue Jun 16 03:02:22 2015 UTC,"(Chicagoan, I come in peace). If it means anything, Anaheim lost in Game 7 at home three years in a row, each in a subsequent round. At this rate, next year your team is gonna beat them in the Ponda in 7. In seriousness though, Seabs said it best, you guys will be contenders for the next 6 years. You all just need a bit more depth on the bottom lines. That was the difference between last and this year for us. Your core is fine, and you'll get the cup soon."

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,TampaFresh,23,Tue Jun 16 03:01:31 2015 UTC,"Besides not wanting to off myself, there is a lot of optimism out of this. Positives: -At least half of our roster was injured. Making it this far was impressive enough -14 more wins than last year. -Morrow won't be back -Triplets and Dru's future is promising -Team will be the same for next season -Maybe Stamkos will learn how to playoffs next year? -Next year we won't be as inexperienced Idk, i'm way more sad than salty. Partially because this Hawks team was the godsquad and they are losing most players next year"

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Always_Sunnyvale,8,Tue Jun 16 03:01:24 2015 UTC,"Great season! This is a young and inexperienced team that out scored the entire NHL and made it 6 games into the Stanley Cup Final. There will be many more good seasons to come and the future is nothing but bright. They have the talent to make it to the SCF and now they can say they have the experience to bring home the trophy, next time. I really enjoyed watching this team all season with you guys in /r/TampaBayLightning and r/hockey...I cant wait for next season!  GO BOLTS!"

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Harryboltsfan,7,Tue Jun 16 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"All cons aside, I'm so fucking proud to be a Lightning fan. They gave me hope and a purpose throughout a bad divorce and falling in love again, just to be left heartbroken. I've been there for bag days, and for a Cup win. I've seen this team grow and become a champion of their conference, and they'll be rivals for the Cup for a while. Congratulations to Chicago for a wonderful series, and here's to a speedy recovery to all involved for a great 2015-16 season. Thank you, Mr. Vinik for a team to believe in, and to the players and everyone involved to bring entertainment and happiness to myself and many others in far worse circumstances to forget our worries. Enjoy the offseason, and Go Bolts! Now I have a date with a razor..."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,aco620,7,Tue Jun 16 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"Well on the plus side, Tampa making it so far this year gave me someone to root for and a more vested interest in the playoffs than usual.  And I do like the Hawks, it's just that they just won the cup 2 years ago so I'm kind of meh on watching them do it again so soon, although I guess it's nice that they won it at home and there's talk of a dynasty going around at the moment.  But on the negative side above anything else...now there's no more hockey...this is the saddest time of the year for me :(  See you all next season Floridabros."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,BetterCallStral,9,Tue Jun 16 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"Am waiting on injury report before I make up my mind about what went wrong. No, it's not an ""excuse"". It's a fucking reason for the drop off in play between last series and this series. If guys are injured, the longer/more games they play - their performance is likely going to go in a downward trend.   Bishop, Johnson, Callahan (dude had fucking surgery less than a month ago), and even Boyle are likely all dinged up to various extents. Johnson being the main clog to the triplets line -and leading scorer for the Bolts - obviously a major issue, but losing your sturdy depth players like  Callahan and Boyle hurts too. The SCF is a 4 line game, and having no depth kills you when only 2 of your lines are running and getting scoring chances. I know they say ""everyone's hurting"" in the playoffs - but it becomes a war of attrition situation where not only the number of players hurt but also WHO is hurt plays a large role. It appears Bolts lost more key players, off the top of my head...and that could be the big factor in the drop off for the last few games."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,lacrorear,14,Tue Jun 16 03:09:35 2015 UTC,"I don't care what anyone else says, I'm so proud of this team. They weren't supposed to beat Price, they were supposed to get killed against the Rangers, they couldn't beat Lundqvist in game 7 in New York, but they did. Yea, they fell short, but I have never been prouder of a team in my life before. Here's to next season and the years ahead"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Lauxman,19,Tue Jun 16 03:00:50 2015 UTC,The last few games have just been pathetic on offense. I don't think we will make it to the Cup again next year without big changes outside of the Triplets.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,iowastatefan,10,Tue Jun 16 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly think a lot of that was injury related. After TyJo scored like his ass was on fire in the first three series, he scored once this series. Couldn't take faceoffs, causing a massive possession differential. It really neutered that line.   Without having to worry about that line as much, they could focus on Stammer and Killorn. We obviously need more production out of them, but it seemed to have a cascade effect.   I mean, we had the best offense in the league, and played like it up until the Finals. Just because we had one bad series doesn't mean we should overhaul everything.   We do need a good faceoff man though. Losing the faceoff battle by double digits every game is unacceptable, injuries or not."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Lauxman,5,Tue Jun 16 03:44:59 2015 UTC,"We did not play like it vs. Detroit. Without miracle play from Tyler Johnson we would've been out in the first round. The Stamkos line needs to be changed up, badly, so it can't be shut down so easily."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,iowastatefan,2,Tue Jun 16 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"Eh. Theoretically, if Drouin can improve his defensive skills and earn some ice time, he changes the complexion of that second line with Killorn and Stamkos.   Offense was not our problem this year. Our 3rd defensive pairing needs help. We need help with faceoffs. We need a little more depth.   With a couple lucky bounces, a bit more health, we score a whole lot more than we did in the last few games. Playoff hockey isn't about winning games 6-4, as we saw most of last series and this one. It's about scoring just enough, and playing good enough defense to win a tight one. That's what Chicago did, and that's how the playoffs typically work. Not saying we should ditch offense at all, but help on defense and faceoffs will do a lot more than adding another offensive player."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,frockinbrock,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:01:01 2015 UTC,Wasn't Boyle incredible against Montreal on faceoffs? I think he was injured. He's normally awesome in faceoffs.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,ClassicMach,6,Tue Jun 16 05:51:28 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna disagree with you there. I don't think ""big changes"" need to be made necessarily. Drouin's gonna slot to the top 6, and either Killorn or Filppula goes down to help Brown and Callahan create offense. Then Erne comes in to be a 4th line threat with Boyle and whoeverthefuckjustnotMorrow. Carle slides out, Nesterov in.  Enough offense there for me.   And I hate to hear about injuries in the playoffs as excuses for not winning, but I think when we hear what's up with everyone, we'll get a better grasp on what has gone sideways the past few games. I think big changes would be a mistake, but the prospects graduating to come in full time will do wonders without fucking around with money."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Lauxman,5,Tue Jun 16 03:49:27 2015 UTC,Drouin is key. He and Stamkos need to mesh well. But playing Stamkos with grinders clearly isn't the answer.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,ClassicMach,3,Tue Jun 16 03:50:33 2015 UTC,Got the memo way too late that a guy like Filppula is better than two blunt objects ramming guys into oblivion. (Even though that still helped Stamkos get 43 fucking goals jesus he's ridiculous.)  But Drouin showed a lot during his like fucking 7 shifts the past 2 games. He's gonna get Stamkos back to 50 if he plays with him next year write it on my fucking tombstone.

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,titsforhits,9,Tue Jun 16 03:01:56 2015 UTC,"Same man, same. We had our chances and Crawford stonewalled us. It just wasn't meant to be. Enjoy your win and may the lightning kick the crap out of your team next season in repayment :p"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,dioxy186,6,Tue Jun 16 03:12:36 2015 UTC,"It feels a little bit like when the Hawks lost to Detroit in the WCF in 2009. It was a bummer to see them lose after a run like that, but you could see what was to come from the experience the team gained during that post season. I'm pretty excited to see what the Lightning can do next year."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,titsforhits,3,Tue Jun 16 14:57:35 2015 UTC,Detroit fan here. That series and the 2013 series between us is by far the most impressive hockey I've gotten to witness. My dream is a wings vs. Hawks finals.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,nedoma56,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think like 3 out of the 5 games in 2009 went to OT. That game 7 in 2013 was insanity, I remember listening to the radio feed on my phone because I was at some event and my head was going to explode."

I may be more rational in a few days, but we fucking shot ourselves in our foot repeatedly this series. Chicago is a damn good team, but we are better than we showed. I expect the whole team to be enroute to the emergency room right now. That's the only explanation.  Also, FUCK BETTMAN."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,TheCenterOfEnnui,6,Tue Jun 16 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"This team has sent me on a roller coaster of emotions this season, good and bad. I'm so sad that it ended this way but I am hopeful that they will learn from this experience. I am so proud that the Lightning were able to get to the finals when every series people were calling them the underdogs and said they wouldn't advance.   ""They won't beat the Red Wings, they're down 3-2!""  ""They won't beat Price!""  ""They won't beat Lundqvist!""  Well fuck you, they did. I am so fucking proud of our boys. Rest easy in the off season, ya'll earned it."

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,KING522,5,Tue Jun 16 03:34:46 2015 UTC,This was the real victory to me.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Clone95,9,Tue Jun 16 03:07:07 2015 UTC,"Looking through your subreddit it reminds me of the 09 blackhawks. We lost in the conference finals, and it hurt, but holy shit things were looking good for our future. This is where you guys are. Bolts 2016? 2017? We'll see you there."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,jpotts1,3,Tue Jun 16 07:16:34 2015 UTC,i needed that right now. I just downed a whole bottle of captain and the fact that you reminded me of where you were in 09 and going forward 7 years with 3 cups gives me hope (similar teams). Good series. Enjoy it. But that cap space this summer....
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,chris84bond,5,Tue Jun 16 09:17:40 2015 UTC,"You know it's bad when Drouin, Stammer, and Bishop are the only ones I really felt on the ice tonight. Fuck it all."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Squorn,5,Tue Jun 16 02:59:02 2015 UTC,I'll still wear my bishop shirt proudly in stl the rest of the summer.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,tampaheat,6,Tue Jun 16 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"It was a long haul for the game.  They played well, even if the follow through on shots could have been a bit better, but as someone who was sitting on the couch and not out there busting my butt, I can't be in a position to complain.  Looking forward to next season and seeing what they can manage.  Great job team!  Anyone who says otherwise can go suck a pickle, unless it's someone like Gretzky...he gets a pass to say that."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,JeanLouWheezy,5,Tue Jun 16 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"I am pissed off as hell right now, and it will likely take me several days to calm down, let alone begin to get past this.  All the same, even through that, I am proud as hell of our team.  This isn't last year where we looked like we didn't belong in the playoffs.  We were a few bounces away from winning this series.  Even more than that, we're going to bring almost everyone back next year, better and more experienced.  Morrow is our only ufa, and that's fine by me.  We will be only one year older, faster, smarter, more talented and with a little luck, healthier.  This team is going places ladies and gentlemen, and I am very pleased to be along for the ride with all of you.  Good night, good season.  I'll see you all a little later."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,holyshithockey,4,Tue Jun 16 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. The hard truth was that we got worse as the series went on, whether it was fatigue, injury, or the Hawks just figuring us out. But it was depressing to see our high flying offense reduced to a shell of its former self by the end. Hopefully they take a long look at the film to see how many missed opportunities there was this series: guys not rebounding in front of the net, normally fast guys getting outskated, wimpy dump off passes to the boards that basically killed any offensive play we had and just put us back on defense. You can say it's luck, and I agree that we definitely did not get some breaks on the offensive side, but we did defensively and with bishop being a beast, we stayed in longer than we probably could. As a fan, watching at Amalie, you gotta appreciate what we've done this season, but can't help but feel remorse for the team that never really played 100% its potential in the finals. One things for sure, the run has made us a hockey town again, and that's so good for the city as a whole. We need the Lightning to keep going, they're reviving the entire downtown area."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,Cats_and_hedgehogs,5,Tue Jun 16 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, we are Eastern Conference Champs, and thats way more than anyone thought we would do this year. I'm so proud of this team and this season.  The watch party at Amalie was a ton of fun, thanks to everyone involved that got that together. Back to Orlando tomorrow morning and time to get through the off season without crying too much."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,watchout4mikem,6,Tue Jun 16 03:20:34 2015 UTC,"Fantastic series Tampa. Thanks for some amazing hockey. You guys are scary, can't wait for next season."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,skelder93,14,Tue Jun 16 06:28:08 2015 UTC,"Going into the series it was all about how Chicago had real offense and Tampa was going to be creamed because they hadn't played a team with real offense all post season. Well we kept their team to the least goals of the teams we played against and all the games were decided by 1 (other than the last one). It was a tight series and we're talking a lot of 2nd year players going up against guys who have been there before. I know it'll be a hard battle to get back to this point but I definitely know we'll be in the playoffs a majority of the next several years with the talent we have. These guys wanted it Chicago just had that little bit extra to put them over the top. Whether you want to call it drive, skill, luck w/e they had it and we didn't and therefore they were the better team at the end of the day. I'm proud of these boys and glad to be a part of this organization. There are so many good guys to root for. The only thing that disappoints me is that JT Brown never got a goal no matter how many tries or chances he had. When we find out how many of the guys had injuries we will know for sure how bad these guys really wanted it and what they played through to be there. I love this team, I love this community, I love all the alcohol I consumed this playoffs and I fully look forward to watching the Lightning fight their asses off for this next year. We have something to prove that we aren't one hit wonders baby. Let's take that fucking cup next year boys. This wasn't our year but our domination time is only beginning. GO BOLTS!"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,watchout4mikem,3,Tue Jun 16 03:04:02 2015 UTC,Hate the ending but one hell of a season. Can't take seasons like this for granted. To think we were down one and 2 minutes from elimination against the Habs in Game 6. Was a wild ride and look forward to the bright future of this team!

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,PaisleyFox,5,Tue Jun 16 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"My facebook is being shat on for saying they didn't show up tonight. I'll never understand why our major three fanbases can never sack up and call a spade a spade. Just because you criticize a team's performance doesn't make you fair-weather or a ""hater""  Christ.   I'm very happy with this year's performance, but excuse me if I'm not sitting here with delusions about tonight's performance."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,fuckyouabunch,7,Tue Jun 16 03:09:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure it's a matter of not showing up, but rather just not having enough left in the tank. The Lightning tied the NHL all-time for most playoff games in a single post-season. That's both impressive and devastating to the team."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,PaisleyFox,3,Tue Jun 16 03:09:58 2015 UTC,yea perhaps that's true. Will be interesting to see the injury report.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,repoman,5,Tue Jun 16 03:11:36 2015 UTC,"I have a lot to say about this team and my experience with it this year, but I'll probably save the whole story for later. I'm sure some of you know that I was a brand new fan this year. I kind of randomly decided to follow a sport due to a personal struggle, and kind of randomly decided on hockey. The Bolts were the first team I got to see, being in their television market, and so I saw my first game on November 6th (home against Calgary). I haven't missed watching a single game since. This team is top notch. Even when they're not playing their best, this team still has talent and speed and class. But one of the best things about this team aside from the team itself is its fans. You guys were absolutely wonderful and welcoming of me as a new fan this season, and I thank you all for that! 💙⚡️"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,repoman,3,Tue Jun 16 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"Holy shit this is your first hockey year? I'm blown away. I figured you were around for a while. We'll, I've seen you around a lot, and I hope you will be. Off season is brutal, but short. See you again soon"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,fezbeast,4,Tue Jun 16 03:22:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I take that as a compliment for sure! I got very passionate about hockey very quickly, and I didn't broadcast being a new fan too much in GDTs and things because sometimes people can misunderstand what kind of a fan you are if you haven't been one for years and years. But I never got that on this sub at all!  I'll be around during the offseason and next season for sure. Y'all are an excellent bunch. Plus my best friend and I are gonna be making a half season ticket's worth (or so, work permitting) of road trips from Orlando. We can't wait."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,uguysareassholes,5,Tue Jun 16 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"IDC what Rangers fans say - you Tampa bros are a buncha beauties.  Great series, incredible defense by a team I thought was all offense, and huge nuts on Bishop to hang in there and keep every game competitive to the final horn!    Hope we meet again next June!"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,fezbeast,2,Tue Jun 16 03:44:58 2015 UTC,"I think most of us thought the team was all offense. They really shored the blue line up this post-season run, hoping it carries over into the regular season and our offense can rid themselves of being snake-bitten"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,GeneralChaz9,2,Tue Jun 16 03:47:26 2015 UTC,"No doubt Hedman was the finals MVP for shutting down the Hawks' top line.  I think the only reason the Hawks pulled it out was their 4th line was better, but if it were just the top 2-3 lines it may have gone the other way.    Snagging Vermette when Kane went down was a huge pickup for the Hawks, but next year they're going to have a lot of holes to fill while Tampa will just be that much better with all the experience your guys gained."

Starting the 3rd period, they exploded, but with 15 minutes to go, they were so dead any chance they had was uncoordinated and not timed well. I applaud the players, and definitely Coop and the coaching staff for doing a fucking great job out on the ice all season.   Also want to send out apologies out to Carle, Sustr, Drouin, and any other player that was bashed for being ""mediocre."" They proved that they wanted to win so bad, and they came out tonight using all their effort. Drouin's speed was unbelievable compared to anyone else on the ice, and you could tell Coop may have wanted it this way. Sustr became very fucking valuable this series, and was crucial in stopping any chances he saw the Hawks or anyone else have. Carle played good enough to not allow dumb mistakes he used to make earlier in the playoffs. He fixed himself, and became a pretty decent defenseman from what I saw. I applaud all of you.   The potential is too damn high for next season, and I hope we do not lose many players, or gain anyone that will fuck with the existing chemistry.   Now let's go golfing, guys!"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,n_noto,6,Tue Jun 16 03:10:44 2015 UTC,Sustr and carle were a joke this game.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,lazybrouf,6,Tue Jun 16 03:15:14 2015 UTC,Sustr was bad.  He was just sitting there taking photos when they got their first goal.  Why he starts over Nesterov is beyond me
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,SinisterTitan,3,Tue Jun 16 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"Uh. No. Sustr was a dumpster fire most of the season and all but the first round of the playoffs. Watch the replay of Chicago's first goal. See Sustr? Yeah, that's largely on him.  I haven't seen anyone dogging Drouin. He was awesome tonight and it's on Coop that he didn't get more minutes.  Matt Fucking Carle is never going to be very good. We're paying $5.5 million for a defenseman who is lazy as shit."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,impaktt,5,Tue Jun 16 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"Just have to say, even though Chicago took the Cup, it wasn't because they walked all over Tampa Bay.

Not sure if you guys had the stomach to watch the ceremony, but during and interview Kane pretty much singled out Hedman as the hardest defenseman to play against in the league.

I'm glad that the lighting had me shaking with anxiety throughout the whole series.  I predicted hawks over lightning with 20 total goals in my bracket.  I guess I can settle for 21. Thank you for a great series, I have no doubts that you guys will be back near the top again next season."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,lil_bibliophile,7,Tue Jun 16 03:30:12 2015 UTC,"All I can say for you guys is: Bishop is one hell of a goalie. Like fucking seriously.   You guys played great, see ya in the regular season."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,atikatothesea,5,Tue Jun 16 05:10:50 2015 UTC,"Great series, Tampa. You put up a hell of a fight not only against us, but the entire season as well. This wasn't an easy win at all and I thoroughly enjoyed watching our two teams play. You guys are going to be dangerous next season, no question. I'm also glad Bishop recovered and was in tonight's game. I wanted him to be at his best just as much as you guys.   Again, great game and series!"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,BearFan34,4,Tue Jun 16 03:26:11 2015 UTC,That final was better than the last two for Chicago and I have already told another fan of Tampa Bay friend that I can't wait to see you again next year.  You guys can absolutely dominate the eastern conference with no problem.

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,bluesbolts,2,Tue Jun 16 03:34:28 2015 UTC,Best 2 teams in the NHL. Best series final I've seen. I'm sure it don't help but for puck luck could have went either way. Bolts will be back.

Tonight was a kick in the dick, but we took a perennial contender to 6 games in the cup final - not just that, but this was one of the most entertaining series I can remember in the SCF. Every series in the playoffs was memorable, and I think things are only going to be more entertaining next year with MTL, and NY out for blood.  Take aways: * Bish needs to be chained to the net. Too many close calls throughout the post season and it finally caught up with him.  * Cally is the living embodiment of willpower. * This team is young and only going to get better. If the Yzerplan sticks, things are going to be scary in a few years.  Love this team, love this city, love you guys.  I'll be over in /r/tampabayrays for the next six months."

TampaBayLightning,39zso4,iamsodaft,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:14:05 2015 UTC,"These past three games were so strange. Tyler Johnson disappeared, Stamkos looked snakebitten, everyone was fanning on shots. If any one of those went in this would be a totally different series. They didn't though so that is the end of it. I agree that the team looked injured and far more fatigued. There's more I could critique but I don't really feel like it is necessary.  As for this season: We were chosen by many as favorites in the east, and we delivered. Even with that status however, there was much doubt. We answered a few questions too: 1) Last year was not a fluke--We broke out last season and stunned a lot of people. Some thought that part of our success was due to surprise performances by rookies and young guys. This year everyone knew how good our team was and wouldn't get surprised. Tampa still won a franchise high number of games.   2) The play of Ryan Callahan--When we got him I heard a lot of Rangers fans commenting on how great a player he is and how hard-working he can be. The problem is that this style of play often got him hurt leading to him sitting out for long periods of time. We did not see that at all from him this year. I feel like he played his heart out and was almost always present. I mean he had surgery and was back two games later!  3) ""Regular season results don't matter...""--Heard this one a lot. I think we showed that it can be a good indicator.  4) ""Price and Lundqvist can rise their game and become unstoppable""--Again, we saw the outcomes of these series.  5) The Bounceback--It says a lot that this is the first time in I don't remember how long that we lost 3 games in a row. The question with young teams is how they react to getting blown out. This team had their fair share, but always came back with a strong effort the next game.  6) We have defense--Our regular season was built on offense, but our post-season heavily relied on strong defense. Hedman was absolutely amazing along with Stralman, Garrison and even Carle at times. Sustr was alright and Nesterov is really coming into his own.  7) Last one: We don't know any better?--I think it was Coop that made this comment after getting asked about overcoming some ridiculous odds based on a random stat not in Tampa's favor. I honestly don't think that was the case. They went into Montreal and laid 6 goals on Price, they went into MSG and shut out the President's Trophy winners and beat Lundqvist twice in a game 7 situation that had Rangers seemingly written all over it, they got over the hump of the battle tested Red Wings. I don't think they did these uncharacteristic things because we didn't know any better, but because they didn't care. They only cared about winning. That is what a team needs to win.  It didn't end the way I had hoped, but truth be told I think they played the Blackhawks to death and they hadn't quite experienced a team like the Lightning before. Hopefully, a rematch next year? Good season, and thanks to the moderators and everyone who made this subreddit so fun!"
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,tothefuture15,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:16:28 2015 UTC,Hawks fan here.  Just want to say your team was tough as hell and I won't be surprised to see your team hoist the cup in the very near future.  The Lightning play the game right.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,akairoketto,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:13:35 2015 UTC,Anyone see Drouin out there?! He was playing great. They should have played him earlier in the series.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,northernpace,2,Tue Jun 16 03:29:21 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling he's going to be a difference-maker next season, though I'm still concerned about where he'll slot in."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,n_noto,0,Tue Jun 16 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"Don't worry guys, you guys will be back and roaring next year. In a few years, people will start calling your team Blackhawks East."
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,LunaticNik,7,Tue Jun 16 22:47:32 2015 UTC,And the Bolts should thank the Caps for their chance at the cup when Zucc got a concussion... It doesn't work like that at all. Injuries are apart of the game so don't use them as an excuse.
TampaBayLightning,39zso4,leeber27,2,Wed Jun 17 00:18:34 2015 UTC,Chicago should thank Hayes for their Cup   Don't.  Don't do that.

It's a shitty loss, but an amazing journey getting this far and there will be more to come now. We know it"
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,Devils_-_Advocate,11,Tue Jun 16 03:43:41 2015 UTC,Exactly. There's no need to be salty or anything. All we have to do now is wait and ignore the trolls/bandwagons.
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,Cholula74,7,Tue Jun 16 03:16:32 2015 UTC,Agree.
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,BentRods,3,Tue Jun 16 03:49:01 2015 UTC,A friend of mine pointed it out this way... Our window is just opening as opposed to the Blackhawks who's age/cap window is about to slam shut. It's a good feeling knowing we have a core group of young guys with deep postseason experience. This team is in a position to truly become a dynasty a la the Blackhawks over the past 6 seasons!
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,Bar_Deezy_Snizzz,18,Tue Jun 16 16:59:42 2015 UTC,Couldn't be more proud of how this team played. Our future is bright beyond belief. This has been by far the most fun season I've ever had watching hockey. Without a doubt so glad to share it with everyone and Bolts nation.
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,Mental-hygiene,18,Tue Jun 16 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"Love our boys, but the last three games were some very disappointing play. Eastern Conference Champions is something to be proud of, however, and we can build off of this next season. Go Bolts!"
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,Devils_-_Advocate,20,Tue Jun 16 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"Sending Marty packing was, for me, the best part of the entire run."

The last three games were a disappointment, it wasn't the same team I had been watching during the playoff run. We now know why. I start this day ever more positive knowing that the future is indeed bright for our Bolts!"
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,KennySlimes,11,Tue Jun 16 07:28:03 2015 UTC,This team proved to me that the core is tough as nails... This is just the beginning for this unit I couldnt be more excited
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,bleizar,10,Tue Jun 16 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"This team absolutely shattered the expectations I (and I believe most of us) had back in October.  We went toe-to-toe with the best team in the league - a modern-day dynasty - and took them through six close games.  We're a young team, and our inexperience combined with some crazy untimely injuries ended up tipping the scales out of our favor.  Still, the future is bright, and I look forward to seeing our young core come into their own.  'Til next season.  Go Bolts!"
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,banghcm,9,Tue Jun 16 03:16:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you're tired of hearing it but.... your future is bright, your team is young, and your fans have passion.  You'll hoist the cup soon."
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,banghcm,5,Tue Jun 16 04:44:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely not tired of hearing it! If anything, I'm glad to hear something nice coming from a Blackhawks fan on this sub today."
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,SinisterTitan,4,Tue Jun 16 04:48:02 2015 UTC,Your fans are loud and don't let anyone tell you otherwise plus you've got a young bright coach.  How about we do this again next year?
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,banghcm,3,Tue Jun 16 04:50:52 2015 UTC,Same time and place? Maybe we'll have Crow figured out by then.....
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,BrazilianRider,4,Tue Jun 16 05:08:11 2015 UTC,During the regular season I hate Crow but when it matters he has this next gear he finds.  If I was the GM I would have traded him like every year during the regular season.  There is a reason I'm not the GM... a long list on reasons. Really long list...
TampaBayLightning,39zsrf,banghcm,5,Tue Jun 16 05:43:11 2015 UTC,And please... No injuries.

For various reasons, it felt like we were playing with house money. I thought this team would contend next season, and a second round appearance would be a success. Then from the Tyler Johnson going ham to keep us in the Detroit series to two game 7 wins, it just felt like we had nothing to lose.   What a special season, I have never been this proud to be a bolts fan. This is a special team, and they gave us a special season. I am of course looking forward to the future, but for now, I am enjoying just how wonderful this season has been. Thank you"

I pretty much knew the Red Wings would lose to you guys.  And as for the Habs? Well I figured you were going to look for revenge.. and you got it... perhaps a new rivalry? Who knows but that would be awesome to see because you need more than the Panthers (Because they are no where in your league)  But when you took out the Rangers... I was in disbelief... and while the Rangers did play like a bunch of lost little puppies out there.. your team just went out there and played your game.  Glad hockey is thriving for your city man. I honestly never thought it was going to work since it was a sunbelt team. (Same with Dallas, all 3 California teams) and one of your former minor rivals in the Hurricanes  And the fact your team (and the Panthers) have to travel so much for your games and still did that? Man I don't know what to say.  Good job, now please don't beat yourself up, the Hawks are a freaking beast who's learned what it takes to win, I honestly believe your time is coming too.  But you may have to do it again vs the Hawks.  Peace  PS The fact that only 1 of your players is a Unrestricted Free Agent will help a lot too for your team, you honestly do not need to change shit."

What sparked that is because I watched Alex Killorn in college and I talked to him once or twice. He's a really great guy and I think he has amazing potential.  Watching him grow in the NHL and earn his spot has really been amazing and I don't think he could be with a better group of players! I hope he and the Lightning earn a cup and the Lightning continue to succeed!

TampaBayLightning,39zvxi,OGHamToast,2,Tue Jun 16 03:42:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with that. I also think it's a matter of who's injured versus just looking it in terms of bodies down. Johnson , the Bolt's leading scorer, being pretty much rendered useless on the ice compared to them totally losing, say, Rosival shows how apple and oranges it can be.   edit: yes I know Rosi is a dman, I'm just using it as an illustration of losing your top line guy vs a guy who's further down the depth chart in his position"
TampaBayLightning,39zvxi,BetterCallStral,7,Tue Jun 16 03:49:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Let's say we lose Morrow or Brown instead of Tyjo. They lose Teows or Kane or Hjarlmarson (fuck it I don't care) instead of Rosival. What then?  EDIT: Speaking of Morrow, I suddenly feel really sad for him"

TampaBayLightning,39zvxi,Cyclops7747,8,Tue Jun 16 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"I admire Bishop for how he played the last few games of the playoffs. Here's a guy who's been criticized for being consistent the entire season and in his most difficult time he brings out his biggest performances. When he was injured most of us thought that he'd be a liability on the team and let in some soft goals; he didn't. He made a judgement error in game 5 but he more than made up for his mistake through the game. He did everything that he should have done and put up the best numbers we've had from a goalie in a while. He might not be our goaltender 3-5 years down the road but I'm damn happy to have a guy like him right now.  Rest up Ben, you deserve it."

TampaBayLightning,3a1h47,TIFUByJoiningReddit,6,Tue Jun 16 14:17:30 2015 UTC,"Is there any correlation between him playing heavy minutes, and those being in games where the Lightning are behind.  Like in the old EA Sports games where your team has a ""hero line"" that gets extensive play at the end of the game?"
TampaBayLightning,3a1h47,2ndprize,3,Tue Jun 16 14:55:13 2015 UTC,That's the biggest reason I can think of. In games where he played less than 17 minutes it's normally because they have the lead and scored earlier in the game. In games where he played 19+ minutes they were behind and trying to come back late in a game where it's a lot harder to score.  Still the drop off in production seems very significant. I might compare his drop off in PPG to other star players in the league to see if there's any significant differences in their production when playing big minutes.

TampaBayLightning,3a1h47,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you definitely will. Check out the wiki on /r/hockey. There's some good resources for learning about them there. But just really quickly, this basically shows that Stamkos is actually a more dangerous player (during these playoffs) when we're trailing. That's an assumption based on the fact that his Corsi For percentage (all of the shots taken by the team, including blocked shots and misses, while he's on the ice) is significantly above the 50% you would expect of someone who was a statistically average player on his team. The PDO number is crazy high in all situations. I'll let Wikipedia explain it. And the ZSO%Rel compares offensive zone starts to defensive (meaning, percentage of the time that you have faceoffs in your offensive zone). Any positive number is a good indication that your team is controlling play while you're on the ice. As opposed to say, Coburn, who was like -14."
TampaBayLightning,3a1h47,ClassicMach,2,Tue Jun 16 15:47:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation! I'm really into stats like this but I haven't taken the time to learn everything. I'm sure once I get going it's going to take over my life.

TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,Always_Sunnyvale,11,Tue Jun 16 03:14:42 2015 UTC,As much as we've said about Morrow through the season I will not deny his determination to the team. He never gave anything less than 100% and even though he's lost a step at this point in his career he gave it all and I wish we won him a cup. Best of luck Morrow.
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,TIFUByJoiningReddit,6,Tue Jun 16 04:16:34 2015 UTC,Just imagine if Tampa spent that extra few dollars on Jagr instead of Morrow. Christ
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,TampaFresh,3,Tue Jun 16 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"i still dont think thats a good move. Finding a 4th liner is hard. Jags got out of NJ because he was doing that exact thing and went to florida and played top 6 and was good. He wouldnt fit in tampas system. Honestly they need a guy that wont mess up but also wont mind playing 8-10 minutes a game. And for this reason i believe you get kadri. Although he was on the leafs and has a attitude issue i feel like the guys in tampa would sit him down and say they are on a mission (see bad boys 30 for 30) and tell him his role is crucial. When boyler gets him the puck he needs to put it in the back of the net. I think dru gets on the first or 3rd line if none of the triplets leave. If dru gets traded they get a good player for them that can give them depth at either the d spot or 4 line winger. Regarding d either sustr or carle has to go. I know we have had hot carle for 2 stints now and thats all it should be. He makes a lot of turnovers and should not be out there in crucial situations. i think you go for a solid d man that is proven not to mess up (i.e. played for one team and played big minutes (oduya,green,franson)) i feel for morrow but in honesty he just doesnt fit into coops fast paced run and gun system"

TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,etoh69,3,Tue Jun 16 03:52:11 2015 UTC,The hype train is headed straight for September!
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,SinisterTitan,10,Tue Jun 16 05:10:53 2015 UTC,Buy out Sustr.
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,Justin620,7,Tue Jun 16 03:05:58 2015 UTC,"Sustr is an RFA, he doesn't even have a contract. That being said, he will almost definitely be re-signed."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,ClassicMach,7,Tue Jun 16 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"I'd rather dump Carle's 5.5(?) million and keep Sustr with Garrison while Coburn backs up Nesterov. DeAngelo and Koekkoek are probably not quite ready, so Coburn's extra year is going to help ease Koekkoek in to take Sustr's spot, just imo."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,MoreWeight,7,Tue Jun 16 04:11:17 2015 UTC,"They will bring in another Dman. Our D is good, but just outside of elite with that bottom pairing. Yzerman isnt going to just sit around and be content with a weak bottom pair. He will move Carle and upgrade."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,ClassicMach,2,Tue Jun 16 05:42:12 2015 UTC,Yeah... Nesterov is the upgrade.
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,MoreWeight,2,Tue Jun 16 11:10:29 2015 UTC,"No he isnt. Carle gets shit on, but Nesterov is not on his level defensively. Sustr-Nesterov bottom pairing would make us wish we had Carle back. Zero chance that  (sustr nesterov) is our bottom pairing heading into the season"
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,ClassicMach,2,Tue Jun 16 15:29:28 2015 UTC,"Even thought that's what I posted down below, I think it's more likely that Coburn/Garrison get split and work with the kids. I think that puts them in good spot defensively."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,MoreWeight,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"I could see it happening for sure, but I dont love the idea. I loved having a great second pairing during the playoffs. Having Garrison babysit Sustr doesnt make me thrilled."

TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,tewas,2,Tue Jun 16 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"I think the only way to move Carle would be as a package deal. And as much it pains me to say, it may be Bishop/Carle package for a draft picks/young D prospect."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,Clone95,3,Tue Jun 16 11:13:33 2015 UTC,"Why's a Bishop/Carle package painful?  Vasy is a great goaltender, and Kristers could be a solid backup when we need him to be. If he improves, trade bait, if not - we keep him 'till there's another great goaltender down in Syracuse."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,tewas,3,Tue Jun 16 13:24:44 2015 UTC,because i really like Bishop. He was playing like a champ on one leg. But i just don't see how you can sell Carle with his 5 mil cap hit to anyone that wasn't asleep for the past two years. Maybe we can dress him in #91 and sell to Leafs. They may not notice the difference :)
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,emotoaster,2,Tue Jun 16 14:17:58 2015 UTC,Worth a shot...
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,mitchyd17,3,Wed Jun 17 02:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yes please! He's a liability. I saw drop Sustr and move Nesterov into his spot. If Carle stays, he stays. I think he played well when he came back from his injury. I don't particularly care what else happens to the D as long as it means little or no Sustr."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,doctorlust,2,Tue Jun 16 05:50:32 2015 UTC,Agreed so very hard
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,Lauxman,2,Tue Jun 16 03:07:52 2015 UTC,Seriously. We can do better.
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,5,Tue Jun 16 03:25:46 2015 UTC,And I'm pretty sure Yzerman will look into upgrading Morrow for a strong veteran presence who can score
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,TIFUByJoiningReddit,7,Tue Jun 16 03:03:52 2015 UTC,"There are much better and younger options then Morrow. After this cup run, a ""veteran presence"" can be pretty much found in every corner of the locker room."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,SinisterTitan,5,Tue Jun 16 03:35:48 2015 UTC,Fair point but I still feel that he will be upgraded for a player similar to Brian Boyle
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,angelsil,2,Tue Jun 16 04:24:25 2015 UTC,Filppula will be traded for prospects/picks and a veteran player in the latter half of their career.
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,TIFUByJoiningReddit,4,Tue Jun 16 04:15:20 2015 UTC,"I think the second Yzerman and Coop are confident in Drouin, Filp gets moved to fill whatever void the team has at that time. That may come this off season, it may come at the deadline, or next year even. Who knows when, but I think Drouin has the potential to play Filp's role longer and better than he does, and it would be great to get some good value for him while he's still a strong player."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,fuckyouabunch,2,Tue Jun 16 05:14:07 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt we get rid of Spatula yet. He's still very useful and was one of the few forwards who made any kind of difference in the SCF. (He, Paquette and Killorn were basically getting it done)"
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,ClassicMach,3,Tue Jun 16 11:27:43 2015 UTC,I agree that he was one of the useful guys but I think his value is at an all time high. Going into next season in wouldn't be surprised if Copper puts Callahan back on the first line with Stamkos making Filppula the odd man out from day one. This means he'll play the entire season on the the third like where his productivity will likely take a huge hit. He had a solid showing in the playoffs and was showcased well and I bet teams are interested. It's better to move him now because it will free up the space for the future and it's not a cap dump because we'd get a decent return.
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,ClassicMach,2,Tue Jun 16 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"Probably not right away. We have so much talent we haven't been able to give any time to, we'll probably see some guys get short stints as tryouts."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,Tenziru,2,Tue Jun 16 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"Nah. Morrow out, Drouin in.  Nothing else changes on the forward lineup.  Maybe Paquette sits and watches while Erne plays a few times, but that's about it."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,akairoketto,6,Tue Jun 16 04:13:19 2015 UTC,"Morrow plays on the 4th line, Drouin deserves to play in the top 6  or at least the top 9. It doesn't make much sense to put Drouin in the 4th line anyway, he's better suited for offense than defense. If we can replace Morrow with a player similar to Brian Boyle, it will be a good upgrade."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,akairoketto,2,Tue Jun 16 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"Nah nah, Drouin moves up to top line, Filppula or Killorn moves down.  Then they could go 11-7 with Nesterov and Koekkoek in, Carle out, or Erne comes in and KK gets another development year. So it looks like this  17-91-27  18-9-86  23-51-24  13-11-73  77-6  5-55  62-89  30  88  I know some of the sides on the back end are wrong, but the general idea is there."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,MoreWeight,4,Tue Jun 16 04:33:04 2015 UTC,Yzerman is continuing to look for defence so I don't expect are defence to look the same hope it gets and up grade.
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,TweetPoster,5,Tue Jun 16 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"If that means no, or at least significantly less, Sustr then I'm all for it."
TampaBayLightning,39ztwo,emotoaster,2,Tue Jun 16 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"It's more likely Carle getting swapped for picks, but that means a Nesterov-Sustr third pairing which doesn't really help us get better but it will help us cap space wise."

TampaBayLightning,3a0099,jhnybgood47,2,Tue Jun 16 20:27:03 2015 UTC,Why would he continue to play like that? He's risking damaging himself further.
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,Alycion,7,Tue Jun 16 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"But apparently coming out with the injury answers that have been being asked all series is tainting the win for the Hawks. I don't see how. It's not like the injury report wasn't expected, in fact, it was promised. They aren't making a big deal or using it as an excuse.  I fell in love with the Hawks before I moved here. I quickly fell in love with this great team. For the past series, I forgot about how many years I was a loyal Hawks fan. But, even if I didn't, as a fan, I don't see how this would be tainting things."
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,Alycion,9,Tue Jun 16 04:12:19 2015 UTC,"Eh, if anyone is saying that, it's just a lousy attitude to have either way. They can all frigg right off. Avoiding injuries is part of winning the cup. It's part luck, part getting guys without injury concerns. Always has been, always will be. Tampa motored through some series that had some key injuries on the other side, Zuccarello comes to mind.  Anyway, I just wanted to aggregate it here because I'm always curious whenever any series ends what was going on."
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,i4_D_4_Mi,4,Tue Jun 16 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"NBC, who else? They didn't have to cover the injury report. They chose to. Then bitched about it. I was sitting here going now I know why I left news."
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,BrazilianRider,7,Tue Jun 16 04:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I rolled my eyes when NBC started saying that. I'm saying this as a Hawks fan. Injury reports come out after series end, it's not a big deal. To say it's ""tainting"" the win is idiotic. If anything it shows just how tough Bish and TyJo are, huge respect for them."
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,BetterCallStral,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:15:58 2015 UTC,Expect Kuch to be injured as well... They're warriors but the Hawks had the experience and skill to shut them down when needed.
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,thedaj,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:27:58 2015 UTC,I bet NBC didn't say that about the rags releasing the news that their top 3 dmen had various lower body injuries after game 7.
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,Alycion,3,Fri Jun 19 13:55:23 2015 UTC,What the fuck were they supposed to do?  Hide the injuries?  What a joke of an organization they are!  Fuck NBC.
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,reptilians13,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:31:45 2015 UTC,"News, even sporting news, is all about ratings. Drama brings in higher ratings. We get pissed, we watch more to scream at them. Main reason I left the industry. I have friends all across the board from local to national. It's the same shit no matter where you go."
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,Alycion,2,Thu Jun 18 02:51:07 2015 UTC,"Either way In hockey shit happens like that, it can't be an excuse, it just sucks when it happens."
TampaBayLightning,3a0099,TSTMWKU,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:22:59 2015 UTC,Exactly. Nobody used it as an excuse. You don't get that far into the season without some injuries and without a few not being able to play 100%. The fact that people were acting like they were using it as an excuse was kind of disgusting. I've never seen a team do that. They are no different.

TampaBayLightning,3a00q9,thatline,5,Tue Jun 16 04:17:02 2015 UTC,Cooper made some poor decisions this playoff run. I hope he learns from his mistakes
TampaBayLightning,3a00q9,kylieigh,7,Tue Jun 16 04:18:45 2015 UTC,"Like the rest of the team it was a learning experience. He went against a bunch of coaches who had a ton more playoff experience than him. Going into game 6 against Detroit most of us were calling for his head (rightfully so) and he made some bold choices that got us past the Wings, and the Habs, and the Rangers. Do I think he's the best coach in the league right now, no. But do I think he's a winning coach that's going to learn from his experience and become better, definitely."
TampaBayLightning,3a00q9,TIFUByJoiningReddit,3,Tue Jun 16 04:22:15 2015 UTC,"When you play against coaches like Babcock, JQ and AV, you learn a thing or two. If there is anyone who will be able to say they successfully took something out of these playoffs, it will be Coop."
TampaBayLightning,3a00q9,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Tue Jun 16 06:08:50 2015 UTC,"If there's anything Cooper had proved it's that he learns from his failures, and does so scary fast.    I have no doubt he'll be hitting the tapes tomorrow and come out swinging in the fall with a very tight and experienced core that's hungry for a cup from day 1."

TampaBayLightning,39z25h,BetterCallStral,11,Tue Jun 16 01:21:30 2015 UTC,Bolts have been giving the Hawks way too easy of a passage through the nuetral zone.

TampaBayLightning,39z25h,Tenziru,8,Tue Jun 16 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"It has been a great run this year. As much as it will sting to lose to this team, our team is young and will be back in the near future."

TampaBayLightning,39z25h,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,9,Tue Jun 16 02:56:51 2015 UTC,2 goals in 8 periods. Best offense in the league is somewhere in Wimauma.

TampaBayLightning,39z25h,Lansdallius,7,Tue Jun 16 02:54:28 2015 UTC,Blackhawks: 32-0-0 this season when leading after 2 periods. Only perfect team in NHL and we haven't lost three straight all season. Everything still possible. We've got too much attaking talent to be shutout.

TampaBayLightning,3a11sw,theycallmeO,8,Tue Jun 16 11:54:36 2015 UTC,"So who wants to send mass emails to nbc to get this fuck out of there? He knows every team in the nhl claims injuries and uses them as excuses. And every uear he accepts them. He is the worst ""analyst"" ever. And so One Sided its not even funny. It is absolutly pathetic that he even mentions this. Im not saying that injuries was our issue, but I think they played a huge role in our drop in play."

TampaBayLightning,3a11sw,kev0h,7,Tue Jun 16 22:34:32 2015 UTC,Milbury is never going to see the Lightning without bias against. It's just the way it is.
TampaBayLightning,3a11sw,MacerV,7,Tue Jun 16 12:09:00 2015 UTC,"Oh I would have actually stabbed him through the television when he said that last night.  It isn't like the team ran to publish an injury list.  It just happened to be the first question they were asked, and the first time they were allowed to be honest about it."
TampaBayLightning,3a11sw,angelsil,7,Tue Jun 16 12:09:11 2015 UTC,Hawks fan checking in. Mike Milbury is the worst.
TampaBayLightning,3a11sw,MacerV,5,Tue Jun 16 13:44:22 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between excuses and reasons. Injuries most definetly had their effect, but as he said you can't use it as an excuse."
TampaBayLightning,3a11sw,PeteSamp27,9,Tue Jun 16 12:10:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone disagrees with that, but the players were asked about the injuries because the media (and fans) want to know. Were they just supposed to not answer? OF COURSE you're going to hear about injuries when a team is eliminated. Doesn't mean they're using them as an excuse and I didn't hear a single Lightning player try to spin it that way."
TampaBayLightning,3a11sw,MoreWeight,3,Tue Jun 16 12:17:23 2015 UTC,"Injuries most definetly had their effect, but as he said you can't use it as an excuse.   I said that im my first comment one this post."

TampaBayLightning,39xriw,TIFUByJoiningReddit,0,Mon Jun 15 17:50:15 2015 UTC,Mixed feelings here as well. I'm never happy to see anyone hurt. I'm happy it increases our chance at winning. But I'm not happy that with the injuries we might beat you at what is not your best.

TampaBayLightning,3a02un,The_estimator_is_in,0,Tue Jun 16 05:14:46 2015 UTC,Luck is such a huge factor. So many things have to break your way to win a Cup. I expect today that we will find out there were quite a few other guys who were hurt too.

TampaBayLightning,39zt14,atax,-5,Tue Jun 16 02:56:28 2015 UTC,What a let down.
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,Lambss,6,Tue Jun 16 02:56:45 2015 UTC,Compare it to the previous season and compare that season to the previous one. This team is improving year to year. Excited for the future.   Believe in the Yzerplan.
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,warrior4321,-5,Tue Jun 16 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"Whats the plan? Acquire all this talent that is known for goal scoring, but find ways to do the opposite when it matters most? Comes down to the individual wanting it at some point. Where was the captain when we needed him most, or anyone else to score goals for that matter?   People like to shit on a player like Drouin for not being a 2 way player, but to me, he's no worse than stammer. All they had to do was put up and we'd shut up, instead they did nothing.  Hard to be optimistic when   1. You are a Tampa fan.  2. It's insanely hard to get back to the cup every year.  Glass is half empty for me, they blew it though."
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,Lambss,4,Tue Jun 16 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"Get the fuck outta here with that shit.  You've got every right to be negative, but c'mon. Do you honestly think that this was a one-time thing? You think the team will just be a huge let-down next season? Maybe no SCF, sure, but fuck if we don't make it to the playoffs again.  You seem to have a solid grasp of how difficult it is to make it to the SCF and how hard the cup is to actually win, yet you don't seem to relate that to why the top players wouldn't score. It's the fucking playoffs, guys like Stamkos get shut down. Look at Chicago, they got the bulk of their scoring from their bottom lines."
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,OGHamToast,0,Tue Jun 16 04:13:07 2015 UTC,"I've lived 28 years of my life in Florida, I've never seen a professional sports team of ours with any promise do anything back to back years. That includes the rays, the bucs, and also the lightning.  Here's another thing, while I do understand how hard it is for people to score in the playoffs, top guys still find ways to contribute. What did stamkos really contribute? I can say he had shots on goals, he didnt have a ton of assists, he didnt win a ton of faceoffs, he didnt play masterful defense. Now look at Chicago. You had assists and plays from kane, constant faceoff wins from toews. They brought something else to the table when they were not scoring.  Yeah the team is young, yeah based on what I saw we should be going back to the playoffs for many years in a row, and maybe losing like that in the finals is what it takes to get these players to understand what it really takes. I thought the Captain at least would step up in some way, I feel let down by him and I don't care what anyone says."
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,Lambss,2,Tue Jun 16 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"Without Stamkos we likely lose either the Montreal or New York series. Saying he did nothing is a little ridiculous. He may not have contributed as much as we like, I'll even agree that he should have done more against Chicago, but I think your criticism is too harsh.  And success takes some time and more than one shot. The cup team had to make a few runs before they finally got it. Might see that again. I just don't understand the pessimism about a team that's so promising. Blind optimism is no better, but from a realistic standpoint there's a lot to be excited about."
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,OGHamToast,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"At least I know all this missed shots he had in the series will haunt him for the rest of his life, or until he wins the cup. He can use that for motivation. I agree with you that he was useful in the other series, my complaints are only with this Chicago series.  I don't think my criticism is too harsh, if any small change would have happened, if one goal was scored on his many chances, we may not be singing the blues right now. I think I'm allowed to be upset, maybe not as pessimistic as I am, but at least unhappy with the outcome resulting from his lack of scoring or assisting."
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,Lambss,2,Tue Jun 16 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree. I just don't think Stamkos deserves so much of the blame. There's a ton of factors that play into any cup run and he is part of it, but far from the main reason we didn't get to hoist the cup on Wednesday."
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,OGHamToast,2,Tue Jun 16 16:19:46 2015 UTC,"Well Johnson, Kucherov, and Bishop were injured. Wouldn't be surprised if some other players were playing with injuries. Not an excuse but something to keep in mind, especially Johnson as he was a big part of getting past Detroit.   You can't seriously tell me you aren't excited about this team's future. Look at the age of: Killorn, Stamkos, Johnson, Kucherov, Palat, Drouin, Hedman, Paquette. Then look at players who will be banging on the glass to get into the lineup like Erne, Koekoek, Marchessault. How can you not be excited about this team's future.   We went from not making the playoffs, to getting swept in the first round, to making it to the cup finals. Be proud."
TampaBayLightning,39zt14,warrior4321,2,Tue Jun 16 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"Dude, sit back for a few days. Think about the records the team has achieved this season, beating the Bruins, Detroit, Montreal and the Rangers, becoming ECF champions and getting to the the SCF in 6 games. All of this ahead of schedule.  After those few days of reflection then tell me they did nothing, and I will laugh in your face. They didn't blow it by any stretch of the imagination."

I don't think they want to go home now, either. Let's hope they prove that point emphatically tonight."

I BELIEVE...GO BOLTS! ⚡⚡  [Edit for additional pep-talkiness as I continue to psych myself up: it's no accident that we're playing Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals. It's not some fluke that we've come this far. At times - most times, it seems like - the odds were stacked heavily against us. We'd find ourselves down a series; we'd have our star player offensively shut down for what felt like a month; we'd have to face the best goalie and then the next best goalie; all of these reasons why we ""couldn't"" move to the next round.  And yet here we are in the Finals. We haven't exactly bumbled our way this far. We've gotten vicious when we've needed to, we've figured out how to play solid shut-down D when we've needed to, we've found ways to put the biscuit in the basket time and time again. Our backs may be against the wall tonight, but we're not facing anything we haven't defeated before.  Get out on the ice and remind Chicago that we belong in the Finals. We've fucking earned it. And we're this close to earning the Cup. LET'S GO BOLTS!]"

TampaBayLightning,39wntp,lil_bibliophile,14,Mon Jun 15 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"This is what Ive predicted since Game 3. The Hawks would win 2 games and have the series 3-2 going into Chicago and the Lighting would win bringing home momentum and wining Game 7 in OT. I wouldn't be surprised to see a shutout, like in NYC in Games 5 and 7. The pressure is more on Chicago, not to choke and blow the first chance since 1938 to win a cup at home than on Tampa Bay. The Bolts still havent lost 3 consecutive games this season/post season and seem to thrive in elimination games. This is going to be an exciting game.  GO BOLTS!"

TampaBayLightning,39wntp,redman66,3,Mon Jun 15 20:27:14 2015 UTC,"Caps fan here.   I want to see some real shit Tampa. I need me some of that TyJo magic. I need me some of that Palat power. I need me some of that Stamkos shark-bait-who-ha-ha. Look for real, beat these fuckers.  SOUTHEAST WILL RISE AGAIN"
TampaBayLightning,39wntp,mtvgeneration,2,Mon Jun 15 20:56:05 2015 UTC,I laughed out loud harder than I should have
TampaBayLightning,39wntp,TIFUByJoiningReddit,4,Mon Jun 15 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"Obviously losing Kucherov is a huge loss for this team but I want to look at the positives. The triplets line has been struggling the the injury to Johnson which can mostly be attributed to their lack of puck possession (resulting from their lack of FW wins).   With an injury to Kucherov Johnson can play on the right wing and not have to take faceoffs. At the same time, Stamkos get's shifted to the center position again and will hopefully get sparked as he has some chemistry with Johnson. Callahan, Filppula, Killorn can man the second line since Filps and Cally have both been playing solid these playoffs and looked good playing together last night.  Despite losing one of our best top 6 guys and messing with the triplets chemistry I still think we have an amazing top two lines and playing a full game with these new lines might prove to be effective.  Alternatively we could go with Killorn, Stamkos, Johnson on the first line as they both have chemistry with Stamkos and they have a solid mix of speed, playmaking, and goalscoring ability. The second line would be Palat, Filppula, and Callahan which is a line we saw a lot last season and all three of them worked very well with each other. I think I might prefer these lines as Palat has no chemistry with Stamkos.  LET'S SEE THIS GO TO 7!"
TampaBayLightning,39wntp,akairoketto,3,Mon Jun 15 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"I would rather see Palat, Stamkos, and Johnson together again. While having Killer with Stammer and TyJo would provide a lot of shots, having Palat there provides someone who almost always thinks pass first. Both choices will provide something for Chicago to worry about though.  Go Bolts!"

TampaBayLightning,39wntp,mtvgeneration,4,Mon Jun 15 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"Flyers fan just stopping by. I really needed to get this off of my chest, so I decided it would be best to say it here. As a Flyers fan, you know we love/hate the Hawks, emphasis on the love only because our former player Kimmo got traded there. We obviously hate the Hawks due to 2010, a SCF loss that occurred thanks to OT and Kane on OUR home ice. Everyone over at r/flyers are cheering for the Hawks (or should I say ""Kimmohawks"") and I can't do it. I can't. I'd rather drink battery acid than watch the Hawks lay their crummy fingers on the Cup for the 3rd time in 5 years. I physically can't allow myself to root for the Hawks. I can't. So I understand 100% how you guys feel right now. Hopefully, karma will come through and allow you guys to be able to beat the Hawks on their home ice tonight, and win the cup in your city. So good luck, and here's to the best."

TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,2ndprize,3,Sun Jun 14 20:21:51 2015 UTC,"I actually dont think his trade value is great right now.  Unless we are assuming he wont pan out, this is probably as low as his value will go."
TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,chimichanga9,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:11:23 2015 UTC,Trade for what?
TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,tcigzies,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"probably a strong 3rd liner, depth on d. depending on who might be leaving after this season"
TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,chimichanga9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:16:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're being effected by the ""Hype"" syndrome. Drouin is not going to be the next generation talent that everyone hyped him to be. He will be very good given his time frame for development."
TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,brainystark,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"His puck handling and passing is absurd. We would have said the same thing about Kucherov last year, and now we are sucking his Russian D. Drouin hasn't even had his time to shine."
TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,geekedoutcoolness,2,Mon Jun 15 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"I was actually just commenting on this to someone. I am not a big fan of Drouin at all, but last night he did exactly what we needed him to do. I actually thought he did quite well defensively, for once. He still needs to develop a bit, but last night he was solid."
TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,TIFUByJoiningReddit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"He did better defensively then he has done in the past. He's always good offensively. As pointed out he even had some good defensive plays, but his defensive awareness / judgements are still suspect at times. But like I said. The good thing is he has already improved a lot since early in the playoffs."
TampaBayLightning,39u0yb,Blake1288,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:06:39 2015 UTC,I don't fault him at all for the second goal at all. Healey was tearing him apart saying he overcommitted on the backcheck but in all honesty it didn't look like Garrison was going to stop him and Drouin was putting himself in the right position to slash the puck away.   Drouin hustled 100% on the backcheck and it was near the end of his shift. You saw at the beginning of the rush that Morrow was say ahead of him but Drouin turned on the jets and that's the effort that will get him more ice time.  There was also another play where Drouin got caught as the defender in a 1-on-1 situation and actually did a great job chipping the puck away and into the corner. I think the play might have even been against Toews which makes it all the more impressive.  I think that was the best game I've seen him play this season.
TampaBayLightning,39tzuy,kiruarracca,4,Sun Jun 14 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"I mean...it's got to be a good sign he traveled with the team right? If something was broken, would he be traveling?"
TampaBayLightning,39tzuy,2ndprize,5,Sun Jun 14 19:30:23 2015 UTC,"All bets are off at this point, but I'm going to take it as a positive.  Kuch is tough kid but I am worried that was his collarbone."
TampaBayLightning,39tzuy,OGHamToast,3,Sun Jun 14 19:33:42 2015 UTC,Collarbones don't take much to break either. Could be he's traveling with the team to keep Chicago on their toes about who they'll actually be playing.
TampaBayLightning,39tzuy,TIFUByJoiningReddit,2,Mon Jun 15 04:06:45 2015 UTC,I would assume this is the most likely scenario. Cooper has been playing mind games all series off the ice. It looked like Kuch either broke the collarbone or separated his shoulder; both would keep him out of the game.
TampaBayLightning,39tzuy,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"I separated my shoulder a few years ago playing rugby. Let me tell you, I have seen a few injuries over the course of my life but I have never been as scared a) during b) after suffering that injury. Losing total control of your shoulder and feeling it come out of it's socket is the scariest feeling in the world. It's very traumatic after as you are never truly sure if or when it will happen again, especially when you play contact sports. Plus, there is a huge risk that it does not completely dislocate, creating scar tissue that can be easily broken through at a later date. I hope Kuch is okay. I wish no one would have to go through that."
TampaBayLightning,39tzuy,n_noto,3,Mon Jun 15 21:56:37 2015 UTC,I just assume every injury is undisclosed at this point...

TampaBayLightning,39tj97,2ndprize,8,Sun Jun 14 17:09:16 2015 UTC,I have seen Bishop roam about the defensive zone like a lost Corgi before   So true. We need to get him a leash.

TampaBayLightning,39tvop,DanceWithPandas,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:49:03 2015 UTC,Are you familiar with the prospects in the draft this year? What is your feeling on patio brunches?
TampaBayLightning,39tvop,DanceWithPandas,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:38:30 2015 UTC,Love brunches.  I have a mock up list of the 15-30 top picks. And who isn't familiar with the top 6 at this point :D
TampaBayLightning,39tvop,DanceWithPandas,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:26:48 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'll PM you when we get closer to the weekend and we can set something up.
TampaBayLightning,39tvop,SinisterTitan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:28:56 2015 UTC,Also I'm thinking D considering us most likely moving some crunch around on the off season but what do you think we're looking for? Open to possibilities?
TampaBayLightning,39tvop,SinisterTitan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:32:42 2015 UTC,I would think RHD and power forwards would be high on our list.

TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,RedSnapperVeryTasty,63,Sun Jun 14 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Playing shit hockey all throughout the first and third periods was the difference.  There's absolutely zero excuse for the #1 offense in hockey only managing to post a single goal in back-to-back games in the Stanley Cup Finals. Somebody needs to light a fire under their asses, because the Blackhawks are going to take the series on Monday if they continue with this zero urgency, sloppy play."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Geddyn,15,Sun Jun 14 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"Good to see I'm not the only one viewing it this way. Bishop shouldn't have touched that puck, yeah, but he's by no means the only man to be blamed in this lost."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,BetterCallStral,2,Sun Jun 14 03:15:21 2015 UTC,I think most of us who know hockey can see the problem is more than one thing. But Kucherov being a possible scratch for us does not bode well for our scoring.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,showers_with_grandpa,6,Sun Jun 14 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  It was pretty disappointing to watch the sheer amount of dump and chase plays combined with no look passes followed by scrambling to defend.  We're better than this, and if we can play better than this- we can win."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Heingar,8,Sun Jun 14 04:14:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our offense has been bad. But with Johnson apparently hobbled, and no Kucherov this game, not surprised that our offense is struggling."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,iowastatefan,18,Sun Jun 14 03:04:08 2015 UTC,So where the fuck is Stamkos? This is the same BS we saw against Detroit. The million dollar man has been utterly shut down.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Lauxman,8,Sun Jun 14 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate to bandwagon here, but Stamkos is the #2 or 3 guy in the NHL. This is why I worry that this isn't 2004 again - it's the year we look back on as ""the example"""
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,The_estimator_is_in,2,Sun Jun 14 03:18:44 2015 UTC,(At goal scoring). Stammer is a great player but he definitely isn't the second or third best player in the league   Edit: doesn't he also usually play center but has been seeing some use as wing?
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,sleepdepriveddev,8,Sun Jun 14 17:29:14 2015 UTC,"We were not connecting on passes, and had no one there for rebounds. Crawford was letting them out but we had no one there to put them home."

TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,iowastatefan,13,Sun Jun 14 03:01:46 2015 UTC,Hawks lost by one when Hossa missed that wide open net in game 3. That's how it goes.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,frustrated_lawyer,7,Sun Jun 14 03:50:57 2015 UTC,Bishop usually lets in an easy one which ends up being the difference maker
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,retro_falcon,5,Sun Jun 14 03:15:21 2015 UTC,I literally went and made dinner when that happened. I didn't even cheer when we tied the game. Just continued to eat my delicious pork chop and garlic green beans.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,likemyhashtag,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it has been the bottom line production making a difference."

TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,InFlamesWeTrust,27,Sun Jun 14 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"Probably an unpopular opinion, but this loss was not on Bishop at all. Tampa needs the offence ( STAMKOS PLS )to show up"
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,TampaFresh,10,Sun Jun 14 03:05:54 2015 UTC,That's what makes it so frustrating.  Other that one play dude was solid.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,o0DrWurm0o,4,Sun Jun 14 03:15:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's just something you have to live with when you've got an active puck playing goalie. It's a high risk, high reward situation; every now and then, an ugly play is gonna happen."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,BetterCallStral,2,Sun Jun 14 14:35:09 2015 UTC,Bishop plays the puck a lot. Did he read the play wrong and should have stayed in his net? Yes. But if he and Hedman communicated better (like they usually do) - and one called off the other- the puck is played into the corner or something. I think the fact they collided was the bigger point of damage than Bishop leaving the net to begin with.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,angelsil,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"According to Bishop, it was too loud last night to communicate."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,BetterCallStral,0,Sun Jun 14 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that. And then the Chicago paper spinning it was ""Bishop blames fans for being too loud"". My point was more that the fuck up originated from Bishop, but the lack of communication was the nail in the coffin for that play."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,BetterCallStral,4,Sun Jun 14 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, especially seeing how fucking injured the dude is. It's rather amazing how quickly people forget that. Same with people shitting on Callahan. He had surgery less than a month ago and was on the ice  a few days after playing balls-to-wall."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,tacos_pizza_beer,9,Sun Jun 14 03:17:07 2015 UTC,Stamkos has been absent most of the playoffs yet Tampa refuses to see it. He's just not a playoff player it seems.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,redux12,2,Sun Jun 14 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"That's what happens this deep in the playoffs.  Top lines draw the toughest defensive match-ups and it's up to the second and third lines to do the scoring.  Chicago has the stronger secondary scoring, and it's why they're up at this point."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,BetterCallStral,0,Sun Jun 14 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"Bolts had scoring depth until Johnson got injured. Not because it was all on him, but him being a step slow impacts his whole line - the one that's been scoring the most and drawing opponent's best dmen. Stamkos getting the tougher assignments makes his weak post season  game, even weaker. Manwhile guys like Filps seems to show up once every 4-5 games, and Callahan is/was still feeling the impact of injury. JT Brown being unable to pot one sucks too since he's been playing well."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,showers_with_grandpa,2,Sun Jun 14 18:44:32 2015 UTC,This is the right opinion though.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,likemyhashtag,14,Sun Jun 14 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the game plan of dumping it, fighting for it along the boards and then shooting from the blue line EVERY FUCKING TIME has a lot to do with it. New game plan Coop."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Thunderstruck79,5,Sun Jun 14 03:28:27 2015 UTC,And it's never going to work when Chicago clogs up the shooting lanes and Crawford doesn't even have to make a save.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,BetterCallStral,2,Sun Jun 14 12:11:42 2015 UTC,"Dump and Chase is a perfectly good game plan if you go chase the damn puck, and get it back frequently on the forecheck. Problem is, last night they looked like they couldn't beat an AHL team for half the game."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Talmire-109,8,Sun Jun 14 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"I just want to know what he was thinking. He had to have had some kind of plan, I'm just not sure what it was."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Justin620,5,Sun Jun 14 03:01:39 2015 UTC,"it was bullshit, and made worse when he got into another sticky situation later on.   He's an extremely skilled dunce."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,hesayswhat,11,Sun Jun 14 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"Please.   For the love of all Bolts fans everywhere, STOP DUMPING THE FUCKING PUCK AND JUST MAKE A PLAY! What's the worst that happens? Crow blocks it? Seriously, this has been going on all playoffs, and it's time we made a NEW game plan before we kiss this season goodbye!   What the actual fuck.  Where is Johnson? He has been absolutely useless these SCF. Can't shoot, can't connect a pass, turnovers - holy fucksticks.  Where is Stamkos? Absent since Playoffs started, with the exception of Montreal - but even still, #2/#3 in the NHL, and he's been a GHOST.   Oh, and Kucherov is most likely toast.   So Bolts, with as much adoration as I can muster together:  STEP IT THE FUCK UP."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,backstop13,2,Sun Jun 14 07:59:46 2015 UTC,"I think Johnson and Stamkos are hurt.  At this point in the season, who isn't, but it's obviously effecting their game.  Johnson doesn't take faceoffs anymore, and Stamkos isn't shooting."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,angelsil,6,Sun Jun 14 10:37:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think Stamkos is seriously injured. He disappeared like this during the regular season, too."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,backstop13,2,Sun Jun 14 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"could be, but could be a wrist injury or something too"
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Always_Sunnyvale,16,Sun Jun 14 14:34:43 2015 UTC,That was the worst turnover or play by goalie Ive ever seen.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Heatinmyharbl,3,Sun Jun 14 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"That was Flyers-Bryzgalov levels of bad, yeah..."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,sarnald,3,Sun Jun 14 03:50:22 2015 UTC,"I get that bishop messed up a little here, but why is everyone not realizing that Hedman poked the puck past bishop? Hedman should've played the man and let bishop clear the puck."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,ghedricks33,2,Sun Jun 14 13:41:19 2015 UTC,If you watch it closely neither of them touched the puck.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,sarnald,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:23:55 2015 UTC,Maybe it was Hedman hitting bishops stick or something
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Broductivity,19,Sun Jun 14 17:26:31 2015 UTC,Not being able to score is a bigger problem. Pretty pathetic offensive effort. Didnt help that Kucherov was out for pretty much the entire game
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,iowastatefan,13,Sun Jun 14 02:59:10 2015 UTC,"So, question--not being a homer here. Shouldn't that have been a penalty on Crawford on that? He took Kucherov out by the legs going for that save. Which, I know he's the goaltender, but since he wasn't in the crease I figured it could have been a penalty. It wasn't called, so it doesn't matter, but it seemed iffy to me at least.  Edit: cool, downvotes for asking a legitimate question about situations that a goalie can take a penalty. All I saw was Crawford misplay a puck, dive to try and save it, and Kucherov go flying into the post."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,aaronm7191,36,Sun Jun 14 03:03:05 2015 UTC,You can't call a penalty on a goaltender making a play on the puck that is flying at the net. Crow was diving back into the crease as he came flying in. It's on the skater to avoid the goalie not the other way around.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,iowastatefan,11,Sun Jun 14 03:12:46 2015 UTC,"Rodger. I didn't know since he was out of the crease diving back in, if it changed the situation at all."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,BetterCallStral,8,Sun Jun 14 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"don't know why you're being downvoted, seemed like an honest question without malice"
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,aaronm7191,3,Sun Jun 14 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know why he was either, it is a fair question."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,ClassicMach,0,Sun Jun 14 04:47:56 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. That would have been tripping on Crawford in December imo. He shot his leg out at Kucherov's path outside the crease. I mean there was no malice, the injury was entirely freakish, and that's exactly what Crawford should have done, I just think that was a trip."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,aaronm7191,3,Sun Jun 14 05:51:27 2015 UTC,"I get your point. It just seems like that is a hard penalty to call... if he is diving back into the crease and there is no shot coming, or he falls and does that but the fact that he was actively going for a save is what changes it. I just don't know I would like to hear the exact rules and different perspectives on it. I could see it going either way really though I guess."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,ClassicMach,5,Sun Jun 14 05:57:09 2015 UTC,"Well, the best way to make my point would be to say if a defenseman came sliding across and took out Kucherov's legs, he'd get tagged for a trip no doubt."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,aaronm7191,5,Sun Jun 14 06:01:08 2015 UTC,"I agree but the Goalie isn't a defenseman. I mean just because a Goalie comes out of the crease to make a play on the puck, does not mean you can body check him. Different rules apply to Goalies."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,ClassicMach,4,Sun Jun 14 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"Well obviously a goalie isn't a defenseman, but if the goalie makes a dumb as shit play behind the net, I don't really think he should be working under a separate set of rules if he comes back to the front of the net and takes out an attacker's legs. If he were in a butterfly position and Kucherov just skated into him it would be different, but Crawford got into Kucherov's ice."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,aaronm7191,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:09:17 2015 UTC,"I get that point, I think the refs look at it as the crease belongs to the goalie even if the goalie is not in the crease and the goalie making a play at that point of the ice, even coming from outside of it, is fair game. The likely truth is, something like that is probably not mentioned in the rules so is a very gray area. Like you said in December that is probably called, however since there is likely nothing addressing that in the rules the refs let it be since it's the scf. If I had access to more then my phone right now I would do some research regarding the tripping rule and how if in any way goaltender play is mentioned."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,ClassicMach,-1,Sun Jun 14 06:25:54 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJTf-yI437M  Well if you skip up to 50 seconds in this video, you'll see my source of frustration lol."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,chocolate_chip_kelly,2,Sun Jun 14 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"Well Hedman did that to steeg and that was a penalty on steeger,  so.."
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Pavel_Datsyuks_Cat,3,Sun Jun 14 13:52:08 2015 UTC,Well on the bright side Tampa will have every motivation in the world to play balls to the wall on Monday seeing as a potential championship is on the line.
TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,likemyhashtag,16,Sun Jun 14 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"It's the SCF, they should play like that every game."

TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,IamHobs,4,Sun Jun 14 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"He's Drouin's turnovers without any speed and skill. It blows my mind that his ""veteran presence"" gets him a roster spot over Drouin, Namestnikov, and Nesterov. Yet I don't see any comments about him."

TampaBayLightning,39rr3o,Durbanpoisonyo,5,Sun Jun 14 03:37:00 2015 UTC,I would assume broke collarbone or seperated shoulder. Probably done until next season.

Alright Canadiens you had you fun getting two wins now you must find peace and tranquility on the golf course. New york.... we won't talk about this one. This team is down to a single option on how to play this game, each player has to put everything on the line to win or die trying. They need to go out there  and throw hits with the intent to injure and make Crawford go into submission from the amount of shots put on him."
TampaBayLightning,39rzao,trolololyork,3,Sun Jun 14 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"C'mon, no need for the ""hits with intent to injure"". Your team has shown that it's more than capable of winning a game without resorting to the cheap physical play of, say, Corey Perry and the Ducks."

I've seen it all season. But want to know what happened when they won game 3? They had 46 fucking hits.  Edit: we done lost game 4"

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,pl__s_bl_d_n__b_l_t_,13,Sun Jun 14 03:26:05 2015 UTC,"Tyler Johnson has disappeared and so has Stamkos. As awful as Bishop was on those two plays, you cannot win games only scoring one goal."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,GeneralChaz9,9,Sun Jun 14 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"Stamkos is being keyed on hard, Johnson is clearly hurt.  That's pretty much the 1-2 punch.  I don't fault them so much as the shit around them."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,tinybubbles1234,4,Sun Jun 14 03:29:57 2015 UTC,"Even with Johnson hurt and Stamkos covered to hell, we have players that will take initiative.   Sadly, I was unable to watch the game tonight due to grad parties, but I do know players like Palat and Killorn can make plays. Were the triplets on the same line? I think we should move them around. The chemistry of the three is already bad with Johnson not up to par. Plus, fuck, what do we have to lose now? We have to try anything and, unfortunately gamble a bit."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,DaPhoenix93,4,Sun Jun 14 04:19:12 2015 UTC,As two of the three are injured not a lot of choices coach has. Johnson is playing with an injury ( sems pretty clear something is not right) and kucharov had a grand total of one min nineteen seconds of ice time before he left injured today.  A lot of them are injured in some way shape or form.   Drouin got 10 min of ice time tonight and was on the PP.  He was mixed in on different lines so it is pretty clear to me coach is trying to change things up and get a spark going with what he has.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,BRod_Angel,14,Sun Jun 14 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"I said it in our GDT and I'll say it again; I am so tired of playing catch up. This has pretty much been every single game in this series, we're down a goal and just scrambling to tie it up and take it to overtime. Of course we were able to get up in two and three, but the past few games have pretty much been mirror images of each other to me.  I just don't find games fun to watch when we're down a goal for almost the whole game and it's just so damn aggravating. I'm still hopeful and rooting for the boys but goddamn it they need to get their shit together.  Fuck."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,InFlamesWeTrust,10,Sun Jun 14 03:08:04 2015 UTC,"So many chances, and cant capitalize off of one.  The past 2 games have almost mirrored each other sans Bishop fuck up.

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,TSTMWKU,-4,Sun Jun 14 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"I hope this isnt some Chicago fan bragging about a team who has been so historically inept that the only other team that can compete on that front is the Rangers.  One of those cups is considered the worst team in hockey history to have won one. And the team that once lost, what is it, 16 consecutive playoff games?  For 90 percent of Blackhawks history the main story line has been how much they suck.   They have a very good team now, but not a lot of fans with any perspective."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,unexplainedrage,3,Sun Jun 14 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"but not a lot of fans with any perspective.   How did you draw that conclusion? From a few tacky Reddit users? I have loved the Hawks since I was a child and in my personal experience with fellow Hawk fans (which I assume is much, much more vast than yours), is that they have plenty of perspective. Tens of thousands of people in Chicago very VIVIDLY remember all the years the Hawks sucked and respect their current success all the more for it. Be careful with generalizations you make based upon what you see in Reddit land."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,unexplainedrage,0,Sun Jun 14 16:52:35 2015 UTC,Basically I am judging the fan base solely on the representative group that has come to this sub looking to be unpleasant.  I will return to rational thought on Thursday.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,TampaFresh,3,Sun Jun 14 16:59:45 2015 UTC,This coming from an expansion team founded in 1992. Do you remember how badly you sucked posting the most 50+ loses. talk about inept?
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,BetterCallStral,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:00:42 2015 UTC,"I remember it well.  I watched most of it.  They lost those games before they ever hit the ice.  The team's original ownership wasn't interested in hockey, just the method of transferring funds to American banks."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,armidilo01,-3,Sun Jun 14 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"Let's see. Let's compare brand new team in a ""non-hockey"" market to an original 6 team that couldn't pay people to go to their arena years ago."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,angelsil,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"Oh please. I was at so many of those games ""years ago,"" and there were absolutely loyal hockey fans that still showed up. I won't sit here and take you through the entire history, though it's clear you could use it, but certainly when Dollar Bill had his way with the organization it was pretty damn tough for much of the city not to lose interest. With Bill raising ticket prices to some of the highest in the league, and refusing to televise our home games...he did a damn good job of strangling the fan base. When Rocky took over it breathed life into our franchise, and contrary to what people such as yourself like to believe, there were a hell of a lot of hockey fans that had been forced into dormancy that could now get behind the team again. To act like Chicago never gave a shit about hockey before 2010 is just plain and simple ignorance."

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,iowastatefan,3,Sun Jun 14 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"So you know each and every fan of the Chicago Blackhawks? Like personally? And enough so that you could actually know that? I see.   When it comes right down to it, Chicago is and will always be a bigger, better, loyal fan base. I said BASE. I'm not saying every single fan but overall? Florida in general has shitty fans and definitely far more bandwagon fans (Uh do I really need to mention LeBron?) I mean, just look at the Florida Marlins. One year, World Series champions. Next? Their ball park was empty.   Again, that's not to say all fans are bad there. I appreciate those that are die hard fans and for them and them alone, I'm 100% fine with my Blackhawks losing the next two games. Because the Lightning are awesome. But, seriously? Don't try and talk about the Chicago fans when Florida's sport logo should be a fucking wagon. And yes, go on, say that the Blackhawks fan base started in 2010. Right. there's a nice chunk of young fans, especially in college... So do the math. When the Blackhawks games weren't even being aired on television, they were children.  Also, bandwagon? Means you'll hop to the next winning team and last I checked, I don't see anyone doing that.   Again, to actual Lightning fans and others from Florida, I really mean no disrespect to you but I feel you deserve a lot better, especially since your team(s) deserve better as well."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,n_noto,2,Sun Jun 14 16:28:25 2015 UTC,Comparing Miami and Tampa is an apples and oranges thing.  The Black Hawks have good fans.  The Black hawks have absolute dog shit fans too.  Both sides do.  I have already opined on the fact that I don't believe there is any such thing as a band wagon fan.  There are different levels of involvement but fans are fans.  However some douchevacuum coming to our sub to mock our Cup win is someone looking to be a dickface.  So I guess he falls into that second fan category I mentioned.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,PaisleyFox,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I know the Blackhawks have some real shit fans. Embarrassing, really. I hope you don't think I'm mocking anything though - again as much as I want the win tomorrow, realistically Tampa can win the next two. That's how good they are and there's no shame in losing to them because both sides have played fun games regardless of sloppiness."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,OGHamToast,6,Sun Jun 14 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"Looks like next game we will have 1/3 triplets playing at full strength. Assuming Kuch doesn't play next game, who plays on the right? Dru or Brown? Maybe even Stammer and have a Killer/Flip/Cally line"
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,PaisleyFox,6,Sun Jun 14 03:22:29 2015 UTC,the problem is that Stamkos and Palat have terrible chemistry and that's the healthy triplet.  I have opined in the past that maybe Kuch would be the wing Stamkos needs but he has to play to even test the theory.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,OGHamToast,7,Sun Jun 14 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"Watch the tape once, burn the tape, then come out and play the best 2 games for the next 120+ minutes.

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,dragonsky,6,Sun Jun 14 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating because some of the time, we can hold in the puck and create great chances (see 2nd period), but just no luck getting it by Crawford.  My guess is Kucherov broke a collarbone or separated his shoulder, or else he would have come back in. Doubt he is back for Monday. With him out, Johnson crippled, we absolutely need Stamkos to put one or two in the net in Chicago, or we will be shut out (or score one) and lose in a defensive battle--just like the last two games."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,retro_falcon,3,Sun Jun 14 03:06:36 2015 UTC,We certainly managed to do it to detroit.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Lauxman,9,Sun Jun 14 03:08:51 2015 UTC,I have no intention of having our first 3 in a row lost coming in the Stanley Cup!

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,jerry200890,3,Sun Jun 14 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"I tweeted it after the game, and I'll say it now. Ice cream is for winners, and since I didn't lose that game, I still got to go to McDonalds on the way back to Orlando.  That said, I would like it if everyone gets ice cream next time.  I'd say it was a fun game to go to, and it was, but losing after a mess of a game on our part just... isn't entertaining. It was frustrating, and it carried through the crowd for sure. I hope Kuch is okay and I hope that this team plays like they have with their backs against the wall before."

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Always_Sunnyvale,3,Sun Jun 14 06:47:13 2015 UTC,"It helped, for sure. But then immediately afterwards I just felt guilty for eating a whole lot of ice cream and felt sad about Tampa's shitty game."

I believe...  In the words of Shia Lebeouf....WE CAN DO IT!
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,TampaFresh,3,Sun Jun 14 03:57:44 2015 UTC,"Same as last game. Can't connect on passes, no one there for rebounds, holding the puck to long and turning it over.   We come out the gate guns a blazing and play hard and fast. Then we let off the accelerator whether or not we score. We go through bursts of looking good mixed in with we don't know what we're doing. It looks like Chicago has adjusted their offense and defense to win while we try the same old same old. And that clearly hadn't worked."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Always_Sunnyvale,6,Sun Jun 14 06:10:22 2015 UTC,Stamkos needs to step the fuck up if he wants to get paid.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,angelsil,0,Sun Jun 14 03:49:31 2015 UTC,Dude's getting paid regardless. They can either choose to have him on their side or probably watch him score against them all season long playing for Toronto.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,JMC813,5,Sun Jun 14 10:14:17 2015 UTC,"Ive been telling all my friends and co-workers before Game 4, that the Hawks would win 2 games and go into Chicago 3-2 and lose then the Lightning would bring back momentum going into game 7 in Tampa and win it....in overtime!

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,NorthSideCrusader,3,Sun Jun 14 03:45:11 2015 UTC,I like this. I like it a lot.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Claustrophobopolis,3,Sun Jun 14 03:24:59 2015 UTC,"That's what my dad said, he is usually right when it comes to this stuff"
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,NorthSideCrusader,2,Sun Jun 14 03:28:21 2015 UTC,He and I should go to Vegas!
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Claustrophobopolis,2,Sun Jun 14 03:30:32 2015 UTC,Whelp. I'm drinking in Ybor because I'm still annoyed.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Wood_Ape,2,Sun Jun 14 05:29:43 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand how a team so stellar playing at home in the reg season can be this terrible on their own ice for the playoffs! Yeah, it was 2-1, but even at a close score the Hawks completely outplayed them. I'm hopeful for a W Monday, but def worried for game 7 back home."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Imonanhnl1,2,Sun Jun 14 15:57:46 2015 UTC,Our offense has been non-existent the last two games. Both of them were 2-1. Bishop and vasy both played well for us and kept us in the game but the offense isn't doing their part.
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,jxnfpm,5,Sun Jun 14 16:16:02 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of reasons to be pessimistic after tonight.   Please remember 2004. We went down 3-2 before game 6.   This is a team that hasn't lost three in a row all year. Tonight was two.  If we lose Monday, so be it, but we are one win away from seeing the Stanley Cup in Amelie Arena."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,GeneralChaz9,2,Sun Jun 14 03:52:30 2015 UTC,So you meant optimistic then??  :)
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,NorthSideCrusader,3,Sun Jun 14 12:27:00 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely be back Monday, they've fought their way this far. Why not finish the job?  But I'm salty as fuck about tonight. We should have had a better game. Offense needs to step up. Bishop needs to not ever leave the goal at all ever for any reason ever.   We can't lose again. But it's gonna take everything to get it done, and they may not have enough. But I hope they do. We have to believe they do. God knows I don't want to hear ""HURR DURR BLACKHAWKS DYNASTY RABBLE RABBLE"" all summer, but more importantly, I want to see this team's work pay off. Play like you're capable of, Bolts. WE WANT THE CUP!"

TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,stamkos4life,2,Sun Jun 14 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"Fuckkkk. I'll leave it at that for tonight's game.   Chicago have done a great job at shutting out our key players, as we have done with theirs. We have quite a few players hiding injuries, the Blackhawks don't have any, and that is now making it easier for them to capitalise.  If Stamkos manages to somehow shake off his marker then he will score in the next game. It's a big ask, we're running with the reserve light on, but I still feel we can do it if Coop and Yzergod can outsmart the Chicago management..."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Petey_Peppers,15,Sun Jun 14 03:24:47 2015 UTC,"the Blackhawks don't have any   uh, what?"
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Petey_Peppers,-2,Sun Jun 14 04:56:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, you do have a couple granted, but we have more key players injured."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Petey_Peppers,3,Sun Jun 14 09:26:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, up until this game really only Bishop. Our defensive core is friggin ripped to shreds. Oduya is playing with one hand. Rosi is already out. TVR is probably still recovering from not playing due to injury. Kane came back weeks ahead of schedule on his injury and is definitely not 100% because of it.   Everyone is hurt. It's the SCF."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,Petey_Peppers,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:58:53 2015 UTC,Yes agreed. We are all fucked with injuries
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,jxnfpm,5,Sun Jun 14 18:29:44 2015 UTC,"Just fyi, the Hawks do have injuries. Johnny Oduya is definitely playing with a broken arm/hand. He's been playing with one hand at least the past two games. Rozsíval has a broken ankle and can't play. He's the reason the Hawks have been playing just about only 4 defensemen."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,SouthsideHyde,3,Sun Jun 14 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"We have quite a few players hiding injuries, the Blackhawks don't have any,   What are you talking about? Odouya one of four defensemen the hawks can count on is playing with one hand."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,3,Sun Jun 14 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"Hawks had a quicker path to the WCF, and that's why I believe we have more players fighting injuries than they do."
TampaBayLightning,39rrbz,YoungMapleLeaf,2,Sun Jun 14 03:46:44 2015 UTC,"Amen. With two series to Game 7, and one to Game 6, we have been playing desperate all playoffs. This is not an unfamiliar spot by any means."

I'm going to go with us hoisting the cup tonight. Chicago thrives on game 6's and just have been getting better each game.  Honestly I don't think Bishop can come back from the major fuck up from last game. I think it's hilarious he blamed that goal on the Tampa fans being too loud.

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BusShelter16,3,Sun Jun 14 03:03:47 2015 UTC,It isn't luck that Bishop went so far out of the net.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Squorn,2,Sun Jun 14 03:00:03 2015 UTC,So what exactly did the hawks do to cause that goal?
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BusShelter16,4,Sun Jun 14 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"They capitalized on a mistake that a TB player made. Not every goal is a ""good play"" by the scoring team, sometimes it's just taking advantage of a ""bad play"" by the opposing team."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Mustached_Avenger,-1,Sun Jun 14 03:16:59 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call that goal anything other than Chicago getting lucky on a bad play by Bishop
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BusShelter16,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"It was fortunate for Chicago, not lucky. Luck is a goal going in off of a defencemen, or bouncing out of the pad into the net. A lucky goal is when neither Team A nor Team B made a bad play and the puck entering the net was an act of god.   This goal was Team B making a bad play and Team A taking the advantage. It was very fortunate for the Blackhawks, but there wasn't an ounce of luck involved."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Mustached_Avenger,0,Sun Jun 14 03:20:43 2015 UTC,Definition 2 or 3.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BusShelter16,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:22:46 2015 UTC,"There was no chance involved. There was Bishop being a dunce and running out of the net, colliding with a defencemen, and leaving it WIDE OPEN. That is a play by the goalie, one of the guys on the ice. And he fucked up.   When MTL played Ottawa, Subban skated way too far away from the play which led to a breakaway, where the Sens scored. Was that ""luck"" because Ottawa did nothing to get the breakaway? No, it was Subban's mistake. Just because Bishop is a goalie doesn't make it any different.  If the same play was Bishop in net but Hedman still somehow fell on his own and Sharp blew past him and scored, would it still be luck? No, it'd be an error by a Tampa Bay player that was taken advantage of.  EDIT: #3 says ""She's had nothing but bad luck all year."" Use it in this context. ""Bishop has had nothing but bad luck on that play"". There was no luck involved in his decision."

Very frustrating loss. I don't think this series is over though.

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,WadeLT3,7,Sun Jun 14 03:00:38 2015 UTC,Been the road warriors since the 1st round. No reason not to believe the job can't be done in Chicago.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,YouEnjoyMyself84,2,Sun Jun 14 02:55:03 2015 UTC,We've already taken one must-win game 6 in the Midwest.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BetterCallStral,3,Sun Jun 14 02:56:31 2015 UTC,This. We haven't lost it yet. Let's come out stronger in game 6!
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,WadeLT3,4,Sun Jun 14 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, CBC you suck them off real good... Fuck this shit.  Welp."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,kjbucs91,2,Sun Jun 14 02:54:56 2015 UTC,"All fucking night. ""BEN BISHOP SHOULDNT DO THAT HES AN IDIOT"" and also the fucking 'experience' circlejerk. Fucking frustrating"
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BetterCallStral,3,Sun Jun 14 02:57:53 2015 UTC,that will be one hard to swallow for a while if we lose the cup in Chicago...
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,screecher7,10,Sun Jun 14 02:54:44 2015 UTC,Outplayed and outcoached. Getting really sick of watching us blow games that we could've and should've won. This one is one Bish though. Better show up on Monday.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,4,Sun Jun 14 02:54:38 2015 UTC,Bishop played amazing other than one major mistake. Lack of offense and lackluster defense yet again. Shits over.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,fuckyouabunch,-2,Sun Jun 14 02:57:03 2015 UTC,I really don't understand how this 1 is on Bish when the played pretty damn well for a guy who's the most injured out of all the guys on the ice. Blame the guys in front of him for not playing sound team defense for half the game and the GWG goal.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,DaPhoenix93,2,Sun Jun 14 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"No one really played great, but Bishop cost us the game with that goal. We obviously had missed opportunities, but that's a routine play that went horribly. It was all on him and ended up being a game changer."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,TampaFresh,2,Sun Jun 14 03:00:26 2015 UTC,no fuck you this was completely on Bishop. This shit would be in over time right now if he didn't try to play a fucking puck that he could see his defenseman was going to play.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,blitzenkid,0,Sun Jun 14 03:00:00 2015 UTC,"You seem to only come out when the team loses, and are taking it pretty personally. I suggest you drink some fermented fluids and chill like the rest of us upset yet coping folks.   Bishop shouldn't have played that puck which ended up being the first goal, but the team was also pretty fucking shitty defensively for half the game and he made some big saves to keep them in it."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,blitzenkid,0,Sun Jun 14 03:02:36 2015 UTC,Way to play better and lose.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,DaPhoenix93,0,Sun Jun 14 02:54:24 2015 UTC,This team won a round?
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,fuckyouabunch,10,Sun Jun 14 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"I'm usually positive as hell , but that was shit fucking hockey. If you're there, boo."

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,screecher7,5,Sun Jun 14 02:53:26 2015 UTC,It's not a one-man team.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,TheCenterOfEnnui,7,Sun Jun 14 02:55:31 2015 UTC,Dude shut the fuck up about Kucherov. You've said this four fucking times already.

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,TheCenterOfEnnui,6,Sun Jun 14 02:53:18 2015 UTC,Shouldn't have lost. Absolutely stupid plays by us.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,DaPhoenix93,2,Sun Jun 14 02:53:17 2015 UTC,Ughhhhhh
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,screecher7,3,Sun Jun 14 02:53:08 2015 UTC,Gave it away.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,thedaj,2,Sun Jun 14 02:52:57 2015 UTC,Sheesh....still can't figure out the offense...better but far from what we're used to

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,thedubya22,8,Sun Jun 14 02:52:51 2015 UTC,So fucking frustrating. Terrible loss.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,3,Sun Jun 14 02:51:31 2015 UTC,So 2 in a row...
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,xzElmozx,2,Sun Jun 14 02:51:01 2015 UTC,Getting pretty close to time to pull Bishop
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,HamburgerDude,2,Sun Jun 14 02:50:45 2015 UTC,That crowd is so quiet I can hear the crickets outside of the arena.

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,6,Sun Jun 14 02:49:30 2015 UTC,Look at your flair. Maybe he'll finally find his way to a game.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,lil_bibliophile,3,Sun Jun 14 02:55:05 2015 UTC,At least I got p drunk I guess
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Tenziru,3,Sun Jun 14 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"Just nothing bouncing back to us. Nice to have shots, but it really helps of they get anywhere near one of our guys on the rebound"

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,YouEnjoyMyself84,10,Sun Jun 14 02:44:37 2015 UTC,We're playing like we have the lead and we're just trying to kill of the rest of the period. -__-

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BetterCallStral,5,Sun Jun 14 02:41:18 2015 UTC,I don't think they're going to beat Crawford five-hole tonight. Can they try to redirect it somewhere else? Stralman's pass was a beaut

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BetterCallStral,3,Sun Jun 14 02:43:49 2015 UTC,That hand on the puck to the front of the net

TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,2ndprize,5,Sun Jun 14 02:41:29 2015 UTC,HUGE save by Bish on Kane
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,DaPhoenix93,2,Sun Jun 14 02:33:35 2015 UTC,Fuck Desjardins!  A full 5 seconds after the play is whistled dead and he's jabbing at Bish
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Sun Jun 14 02:32:16 2015 UTC,10-2 in the third and down a goal. Bullshit!
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Claustrophobopolis,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:31:09 2015 UTC,"CBC is in love with Corey Crawford and in all honesty, he hasn't been that amazing. And I give credit when credit is due, like to Lundqvist and Price."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Xxenotron,11,Sun Jun 14 02:30:44 2015 UTC,They aren't playing. Crawford's making saves when he needs to. I wanna beat him but he deserves credit
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,weath1860,0,Sun Jun 14 02:35:39 2015 UTC,Just thinking that. If it wasn't for a few whiffs and mishandles we would have 4 goals.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Squorn,6,Sun Jun 14 02:35:03 2015 UTC,Yep well...
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BetterCallStral,4,Sun Jun 14 02:30:40 2015 UTC,We are not done yet.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Ryukian,7,Sun Jun 14 02:29:08 2015 UTC,"I am so tired of almost always playing catch up. I feel like that's mostly what this series has been, Tampa being behind a goal and struggling to tie it up."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:25:06 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. It seems like we're always the team under pressure in this series.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,BetterCallStral,5,Sun Jun 14 02:35:26 2015 UTC,Keep the pressure on boys!
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:19:17 2015 UTC,Defense please
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,4,Sun Jun 14 02:19:04 2015 UTC,plenty of time left. I feel another goal or two coming soon.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:18:28 2015 UTC,Sustr below the goal line as that break started.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,7,Sun Jun 14 02:18:14 2015 UTC,man how come the Bolts never gets bounces like that. I know they say you make your own luck but that rebound literally went right to Vermette while all the rebounds for the Bolts have been bouncing fuckers.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Tenziru,4,Sun Jun 14 02:17:49 2015 UTC,Shit luck.
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:18:48 2015 UTC,If it always happens it's the Bolts fault
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,2,Sun Jun 14 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"Well yes and no. Crawford's rebound control also plays a role. But even when he's served it up for the Bolts, the Bolts player seems to always have it in his skates or misses it or something."
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,PassItToSteven,2,Sun Jun 14 02:20:08 2015 UTC,Maybe if Stamkos finds a way to lift the puck or maybe bishop doesn't charge Hedman the series might be different
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Tenziru,-9,Sun Jun 14 02:22:34 2015 UTC,Cally isn't worth the money.. Not even close
TampaBayLightning,39r9o7,Tenziru,6,Sun Jun 14 02:17:19 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree.

TampaBayLightning,39p6ws,DustyBazongas,12,Sat Jun 13 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"TODAY IS THE DAY I GET TO GO SEE A SCF GAME!!! I'm so stoked.   Anyway. I miiiiight head out a little early since there's the construction and whatnot. I'm terrible at city traffic (though I think by this point I've been to downtown Tampa more than downtown Orlando). Since that might happen, does anybody have a Cuban sandwich recommendation within walking distance to Amalie? Preferably something I can grab and go eat... Somewhere. Outside if it's nice.   Still debating on if I want to bother taking my nice camera to take photos of the warmup."

I've never met a cockier fan base, most of them had said Tampa is lucky to have won the two games they did. Anyways, I've been getting a lot of good shit-talking practice this past week so when I go to the game tonight I'll be on point. Go bolts!"

Edited to add: I think OP is worried they won't all be open, which has been the case at many arena events. Only a minimal number of stands were open and World of Beer wasn't one of them :-/"
TampaBayLightning,39md6r,angelsil,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my concern. Short notice + free event = a little less money and time to schedule and pay those who work at the arena in normal game situations."

I have a Lightning flag covering my wall in my cube at work. I have a picture of me wearing my Vinny Jersey to school in my middle school year book. I have a piece of the 04 goal net. I have been forcing my friends to go to games for years and now they are all Bolts fans. We all play NHL on Xbox all the time together. I have a signed Mike Smith cup filled with all my stubs from the 08 season. I believe there's about 30+ ticket stubs there and we finished second to last that year. I worship my team and people come up to me asking about advice all the time about how the team is looking because they know I know everything going on with the team.   But I've never been to a playoff game. Tickets are too expensive for me, so I just gather with my friends for the games. I annoy my neighbors by opening the front door and blowing my Vuvuzalea to make sure my neighborhood knows we just scored. I have boxes of memorabilia, posters everywhere and even a lightning zombie garden gnome. Never considered a chance to go to a finals game in my life.   If this is a serious post and I'm fortunate to be considered, I can provide photographic evidence of just about everything mentioned above. I also still have the 6 part Khabibulin poster the St Pete times released in 04. Let me try to find a link to that since I posted it a few days ago. I'm willing to answer any questions/provide any proof you might need OP.  Thanks for posting this, amazing opportunity for a lucky fan!

TampaBayLightning,39mo0x,RabbitFeet25,3,Sat Jun 13 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"Some fans are going to be in for a treat!  I'm new to reddit and this subreddit.  I'll share my story (but will exempt myself from a ticket) anyways.  I started ""following"" the lightning their first season.  I was in middle school at the time.  My mother, a Detroit native, was thrilled when Tampa got a hockey team.  You would have thought time itself had just stood still.  I remember games being played and watching them on our 17"" tube TV.    I, however, was originally not as large of a fan as I am now.  We, like most families at the time, had one television.  I remember being very upset and pouting when I had to stop watching ""Swiss Family Robinson"" so we could watch hockey.  Ironically enough, this also spawned some of my best childhood memories.  I remember watching games.  I remember missing games that I sincerely looked forward to while I was in bed sick and throwing up, wishing it would at least wait until the game was over.  Somehow and someway I was hooked!  When the Lightning moved to the Ice Palace I was attending St Pete High School.  That was our first year with season tickets, granted they were half season tickets if memory serves.  I remember routinely going to games and watching the lightning get their ass kicked!  However, watching Dino Ciccereli (sp?), Darcy Tucker, Gratton, etc was always a blast!  I remember announcements that there were 3000 fans at the game.  I remember seeing all the empty seats and wondering why I was stuck in the corner of high 300s when everyone could clearly have sat in the 100s.    The Lighting and Roman Hamrlik (??) ran a youth contest once where if you promised to be tobacco free for a year they gave you an autographed puck!  It ended up being the hardest year of my life (close friend committed suicide) and had it not been for that promise I would have been another teenage who fell into bad habits.  The next year we got full season tickets.  I guess you could say that I got into a different habit. :p  03-04 was the season of dreams.  Attendance started horrible but as it became clear the lightning were contending attendance began to rise.  Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.  On the way to the game we picked up some Calgary fans hitchhiking to the game.  It's when I learned that opposing fans weren't the enemy after all!  Screaming, cheering, crying as the victory party unfolded as the final minute ticked off the clock.  It was so loud that you couldn't hear yourself scream!  Simply amazing and will never be forgotten!  Unfortunately, after that season I moved to California for the woman of my dreams.  We moved back to Florida (a few hours south of Tampa) a few years later and, unfortunately, haven't been to a game since despite following them online, Sport's center and on TV (not lucky enough to have Rick and the Chief down here).  I sincerely hope that OP is sincere.  I HOPE that whomever gets the ticket will be able to fully appreciate the wonder and awe of playoff hockey in Tampa!  Go Bolts!!  typed from my thumbs... Excuse the typos"
TampaBayLightning,39mo0x,PoopOnTheHallWalls,3,Fri Jun 12 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone! L.A. superfan here that got to go last year with this fine gentleman who is giving away the tickets. He is a man of his word and super easy to get along with.  You will not get axe murdered in the swamps. I promise. Please share this with all of the hockey fans that you know in the greater Tampa Bay area. Get the word out so that someone truly deserving and awesome gets the chance to experience the gift of the Stanley Cup that I was fortunate enough to enjoy. Good luck everyone and whoever wins... Take lots of pictures and video!  I do web development and video editing (http://www.mister-mitchell.com) and am putting together a website to help get the word out and share past experiences, as he has expressed an interest in continuing this as a yearly tradition.  P.S. Here's my writeup from last year describing my experience (sorry if it's too long):   I was able to witness the LA Kings hoist Lord Stanley's Cup due to the complete altruism and overreaching kindness of a total stranger. I am still in disbelief that what transpired actually happened. Let me explain. I wanted the Kings to win in 4. That way it would be in New York and I wouldn't feel like I ""missed"" it, being all the way across the country. There just isn't enough extra money right now to be able to get tickets. Well, as game 4 ended with a Kings loss and the Kings with a chance to win on home ice in Los Angeles, I began to browse the internet to gauge ticket prices and see if there was a snowball's chance in Hell that I could snag a seat. With prices between $600-$20,000, there was just no way I could make it happen, not with the unsteady work and bills already piling up. I tried craigslist to see if maybe I could find a face value deal or something of the like, and came across a posting simply titled ""The Gift of the Stanley Cup - Join me for Game 5"". Upon clicking, I read about a guy who had gotten the chance to take his brother ( a huge Chicago Blackhawks fan) to Boston to witness the Hawks hoist the Cup. He said that because of the joy he saw in his brother, he wanted to be able to share that feeling again with someone that would enjoy it just as much. A King's fan. So I opened my email and sent him a letter describing my love for all things hockey, and especially my love for the Kings. How I grew up watching them on fuzzy bunny ear tube televisions and how I used to tie pillows to my legs and wear a blue bandana so that I could pretend to be Kelly Hrudey. I hit send and went to bed. The next day I checked my inbox religiously, hoping that maybe it was legit and just maybe he would pick me. As the night before game 5 wound down, I fell asleep without a response, but when I awoke on game day, there was a message waiting for me. It said, ""Welcome to Game 5. Want to join me at Staples Center tonight?"" I was in shock. I still didn't think it was true. We exchanged a few texts and I agreed to meet him at the Luxe, where he was staying. I made the trek to downtown and texted him when I got to the lobby. Even to that point, I thought it could still possibly be a prank or scam or something. Instead, he shows up, proceeds to be a super normal, interesting guy, has 2 tickets 12 rows off the ice, refuses to let me buy a single thing, buys me beer the whole game, and buys me beer after the game to celebrate. I can't thank him enough for allowing me the opportunity to witness what I did. That had to have been the greatest game in King's history up to this date, and I got to see it in the flesh, all thanks to a complete stranger I met on the internet. Life is such an adventure sometimes. It never ceases to blow my mind. He doesn't have Facebook or Reddit, so I can't tag him in this, but I want as many people as possible to know about the epic kindness of this human being. It is truly a story that I will tell for ages and will definitely never forget. Thanks again kind stranger. P.S. I loaned him my Kopitar jersey so he would feel at home."

TampaBayLightning,39lexp,BrazilianRider,4,Fri Jun 12 16:25:12 2015 UTC,The Lightning can't play the way they played last game if Vasy ends up playing in net. I know they played a more defensive style to limit the chances against him but it's not going to work. Crawford has been pretty shaky this series and if the game turns into a shooting gallary I'm confident that we can score more goals regardless of who's in net.   Want to know why we always get a bunch of scoring chances against Chicago right after they score on us? It's because we abandon our defensive style for a few minutes and play a pure offensive game. Chicago has shown that they can't match us when we play this kind of game and I think a big reason for that is that they only have 4 defensemen. Keith plays big minutes but 30 minutes against a primarily defensive team isn't that big of a deal compared to 30 minutes of back and forth hockey. If we can tire out their top pair (even if we give up a couple goals in the process) we'll come out on top.
TampaBayLightning,39lexp,retro_falcon,2,Fri Jun 12 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"Oh god, this is so true.   This is how every period goes:  0:00 - 6:00: Lighting play fast and loose and have 4-5 shots on goal, with 1-2 Chicago shots. Hopefully we score, but normally we don't.   6:01 - 15:00: We take our foot off the gas and both teams get a good amoung of shots in.  15:01 - 20:00: Either us or the Blackhawks pick up our game and a barrage of shots fly in, similar to the beginning of the period. A goal is normally scored here.  EVERY FUCKING TIME."
TampaBayLightning,39lexp,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"^ Need to get out of the turtle shell and start hitting them in the teeth. We get these bursts of energy and we look like the highest scoring team in the league that we were. But we also get to defensive for long stretches and go 10 min without a shot on goal. No reason to not get 30+ shots a game on Crawford. Our offense goes way deeper than their defense. Keep the pressure up, grind out pucks and well wear them down. We stay with the finesse game when we should go into grind mode."

Been meaning to work on a larger mockup and start looking at uniform makers but been busy.  I also offered him one copy as a momento.   I'm somewhat delaying in hopes of having two stars on the crest.

TampaBayLightning,39fywv,Siggy778,25,Thu Jun 11 13:41:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. I predicted a Hawks/Bolts final in the beginning of the season and I'm glad to see it happen. Two fast, skilled teams who mostly play clean (no team is perfect) hockey. They're putting on a hell of a show for the fans."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,angelsil,15,Thu Jun 11 14:08:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously, 4 games decided by 1 goal each?  What else can you ask for?  Every time the Hawks take the lead I just wait for Tampa to come down and score.  They kick it into another gear when they give up a goal."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,MoreWeight,10,Thu Jun 11 14:41:36 2015 UTC,"I actually find the hawks to be one I the few teams I cant bring myself to dislike. Yeah, Shaw is a dick and some of the fans are obnoxious (we have ours too), but as far as the team on the ice, not much to dislike. Dirty plays are at a minimum (aside from the Keith punch, and for us the Kuch slew foot).   They very much remind me of us. They are not built to be goons. They have so much talent the just take it to you every play and then skate away when the whistle blows, only to come back with more intensity next time. Like when Saad has scored big fucking goals, I cant be mad. Dude is playing out of his mind and as a hockey fan I appreciate how good he is right now. I almost have a hard time even being mad when he puts you all ahead because he has so much heart right now. Obviously I want us to win, but I am appreciating great hockey while it lasts."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,MoreWeight,2,Thu Jun 11 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Well stated.  As a Hawks fan, it's frightening to see how this team will be changed over the off season because of the salary cap crunch.  Saad will get locked up by the Hawks, but with Kane and Toews getting much-deserved raises someone's going to get left out.  Most Hawks fans think Sharpie is gone for sure.  He makes a lot of money and his production has greatly fallen which is sad because he was there before Kane/Toews.  Vermette and Timmonen were both rentals, Oduya may be gone as well.  All Hawks fans would love to see Bickell get moved.  He has been awful this year and makes a ton of money.    Honestly, some Hawks fans, myself included, would like to see Crawford traded.  He's a Top 10 goalie, but is the 3rd highest paid in the league and is not a Top 5 goalie.  Goalies are becoming easier to come by and we have two behind Crawford that are both more than capable, especially when you have Keith, Seabrook and Hjaalmarson in front of you.  Tampa is stocked with young talent, but will run into the same crunches in the future.  It's inevitable, so enjoy it while you can."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,MoreWeight,2,Thu Jun 11 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"Following the hawks from a distance, you seem to be right about the need to move those players. However, I think there may be a problem unloading those deals. Bickell is 4m for a guy who is being benched. Crawford is 6m for another 4 or 5 years (cant remember). And Sharp is a 6m cap hit for 2 years. I mean, they are not exactly unmovable (all the players mentioned are potentially quite good), but thats a lot of money. It will take the right partner (ie: team who needs to get to the cap floor, or young team in need of long term goaltending solution in the case of crawford).   It will be super interesting to see how Bowman navigates it. He has his work cut out for him, certainly."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,reptilians13,0,Thu Jun 11 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"Yea Sharp still has some appeal, as does Crow, but Bickell does not."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,MoreWeight,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that Crawford does, but I am just so hesitant with goalies. For example, I am not happy about the contract we gave Bish. I think we have an all world prodigy on the bench and he will surpass him this year. And yet, we are on the hook for 2 years at 6 million. I think there are so many middle of the pack goalies available, I am just hesitant to pay them big money. And, even the good ones are hit and miss. Since you all won a cup with a rookie Niemi, I am sure you know what I am talking about.  Will he be that hard to move? probably not (provided they even decide to do so). I just have my own colored glasses about goalies on."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,Nivekrst,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:19:52 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm saying.  You can win with above-average goaltending.  Crawford actually takes more criticism than he deserves but he is not as good as the money he's making.
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,BigVegetables,-1,Thu Jun 11 19:23:16 2015 UTC,In our 5v3 power play in the 3rd game they were tripping is throughout the whole thing but not one penalty is called in my opinion when it comes down to it they don't call a lot on the Blackhawks because they are such an established team.
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Thu Jun 11 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"I dont agree with this at all. I think the series has been called evenly. I am not sure what you watched, but they were not tripping us on a 5 on 3, and IF they were, of course its not being called! Its already a 5 on 3! You would have to fucking murder someone with your skate to get another call when already on a 5 on 3."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,injun_head,3,Thu Jun 11 22:43:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was thinking the same thing about the Hawks. These are two classy teams in an epic battle as the Cup Finals should be. There ar eteams I will hate forever through their classless actions, (Looking at you Flyers and Kings), but I have yet to find a good reason to hate the Blackhawks."

TampaBayLightning,39fywv,chimichanga9,3,Fri Jun 12 03:11:38 2015 UTC,"It is really nice to see games being decided by hockey and not goonery.  Yeah there are hits, punches, ect.  But in this series they have been with in the game and not after the whistle BS.  TB has some serious talent and have been able to really disrupt the Hawks play.  It is pretty amazing to see two teams with such incredible offensive capabilities play a series that is going to be decided by who has the better defensive game and is able to shutdown the opposition.  BTW Kuchie Kuchie Kucherov if fricken awesome, he can come to the Hawks anytime."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,likemyhashtag,3,Fri Jun 12 14:23:24 2015 UTC,Likewise....   Hawks have that something special that you just can't hate.   Hel of a series for both teams giving it all they've got left every shift.

TampaBayLightning,39fywv,angelsil,2,Thu Jun 11 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks that seems super sincere. It seems kind of lazy if the Hawks win it. Crawford has come up big. Crawford and Bishop perform nearly identical to me. Something has to give for the Hawks, roster wise I suppose."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,rayogata,6,Fri Jun 12 20:40:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the compliment but can you tell Keith to stop sucker punching Callahan in the back of the head? That shit ain't cool man.
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,GeneralChaz9,6,Thu Jun 11 14:28:32 2015 UTC,I didn't see that.  I had to miss the first two periods due to life getting in the way.  Keith isn't a dirty player but defensemen usually find themselves in the thick of things.
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,rayogata,4,Thu Jun 11 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the potato quality. I thought Chicago was a decent team. Sure, both teams have gotten away with penalties but I'm seeing more and more dirty hits from the Blackhawks than I thought I would."
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,rmoviesok,10,Thu Jun 11 14:47:12 2015 UTC,Oh man that was garbage. I can't defend that play but Keith isn't considered a dirty player. I can't defend the Shaw bite either. Really stupid.

TampaBayLightning,39fywv,inbeforegif,2,Thu Jun 11 18:51:46 2015 UTC,Stressful?  The last 3 minutes of every game have been terrifying.  Last night was horrific and I honestly do not know how you guys didn't score.  I feel like you've had so many just-misses and the Hawks have been very fortunate.  That's why I see you guys winning the series.  You create so many legit chances.
TampaBayLightning,39fywv,TIFUByJoiningReddit,2,Thu Jun 11 14:48:13 2015 UTC,"I live in California now,  Tampa transplant. There was a hockey watch party at the clubhouse where i live for game 3. I skipped it.   Too stressed to be around people talking and eating. I watched on my balcony chain smoking and drinking. Almost went up in the third,  but then the Hawks scored and tied so screw that.   Phenomenal series from a guy who was at 3 of the 4 home Stanley games in 04."

TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,showers_with_grandpa,2,Thu Jun 11 16:02:55 2015 UTC,Is there another angle?  With Callahan's helmet hanging back like that a punch to the back of the head would have sent it flying forward.  Looks like Keith just gives him a shot between the shoulder blades.
TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,Mentalseppuku,12,Fri Jun 12 23:12:06 2015 UTC,"If refs called every jab to the head from every player, games would take 7 hours."
TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,danki5000,6,Thu Jun 11 19:40:27 2015 UTC,I think this crosses the line a little. Especially because it takes Callahan completely out of the play on the backcheck.
TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,TIFUByJoiningReddit,-7,Thu Jun 11 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does, but it happens ALL THE TIME. It is in no way something out of the ordinary for a professional hockey game. If you disagree, you just dont watch a whole lot of hockey."

TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,danki5000,5,Fri Jun 12 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"Dirty play by a usually clean player.  Keith isn't squeaky clean, but then again do you want your defensemen to be?"
TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,Siggy778,3,Fri Jun 12 00:44:56 2015 UTC,"On one hand I fucking love Duncan Keith for what he does for Canadian hockey, hes easily top 3 D in the league currently. On the other I want to curb stomp him for what he does occasionally in the NHL."
TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,endurance13,-3,Thu Jun 11 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, as a Hawks fan, he can do some cringey things that make you feel bad, but I think that's more common in the NHL than you think, especially from D-men.  When you're involved in as many plays and corner scrums as he is emotions are bound to get the best of you."
TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,Siggy778,-5,Thu Jun 11 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"Just curious what your top 3 D-men are.  Because Keith barely cracks my 5, and on some days he doesn't even do that."
TampaBayLightning,39gcj7,ClassicMach,3,Thu Jun 11 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"All around, Doughty, Keith, Giordano."

TampaBayLightning,39gc91,angelsil,8,Thu Jun 11 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"Jesus, I'm glad someone said this. This is exactly the sort of opportunity that Drouin needs in order to contribute to the success of his team. Putting him on a line with scoring forwards could help rejuvenate the line and allow Johnson to be a 12th forward who has sheltered ice time. It's so blatantly obvious that he is hurt and if we've ever needed offense in a series, it is this one.   Drouin's natural position is wing, but he is also an accomplished center men. Palat has been taking faceoffs for Johnson, so if that becomes an issue there is the back door. Either way, Coop needs to use all the tools at his disposal or we will lose a pivotal Game 5."
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Thu Jun 11 17:46:54 2015 UTC,Drouin for Johnson I can agree with. He doesn't make a good replacement for Morrow but an injured Johnson would work.
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,Cats_and_hedgehogs,13,Fri Jun 12 00:53:44 2015 UTC,He's injured. I think something happened in the NYR series and he aggravated it when he took a spill in the first game this series. I want him healthy but also to be playing so it's kind of a catch 22. I think someone needs to take his place on the PP. He can't hack it right now.
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,Bar_Deezy_Snizzz,6,Thu Jun 11 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"Last night was a shining example of the condition TJ is in. Look at the impact he had in the Wings and Habs series, whereas last night he was nowhere to be found and Palat was absolutely buzzing and dictating the chances for that line.   What's worse is they have him on that left faceoff dot during the PP?! Stammer is posted about 5 feet in front of Crawford looking for the dirty goals. I realize TJ isn't a big body presence in front of the net, but Stammer has an absolute cannon and we need to utilize that, especially at 1-for-11 against the Hawks' PK."
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,TheySayItsRize,2,Thu Jun 11 16:03:43 2015 UTC,I agree completely on we need to use Stamkos' shot more. Especially when the PP isn't working.
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,Blake1288,2,Thu Jun 11 16:40:06 2015 UTC,I still wish we used Cally or Boyle to snag those dirty goals. Hell even Palat or Morrow.
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,fuckyouabunch,7,Fri Jun 12 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"I just posted about our PP and went into detail about Johnson. He's hampered, and it's hurting us."
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,stamkos4life,3,Thu Jun 11 15:41:01 2015 UTC,I've heard he is injured and is trying to lead by being on the ice at all but honestly...might be time to shake up his ice time.
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,TIFUByJoiningReddit,2,Thu Jun 11 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"Obviously he's injured but this problem is a lot bigger than it seems. Typically when a player gets injured we see them playing more limited minutes or in less difficult situations (more offensive zone starts). Because the triplets are inseparable as a line we can't change how we play Johnson without affecting the entire line. To make matters worse, Johnson is the only guy on that line who can take faceoffs and as a result we have to put Kucherov/Palat in for faceoffs. Clearly both of these players cannot take faceoffs which means when we give them more offensive zone starts they normally lose the faceoff and then the puck exits the zone.   This puts the team in a very tricky position where they can't give the line as many defensive zone starts because of the injury and can't give them offensive zone starts (if we're losing) because they lose the puck off the draw and negate any opportunity we would have had.  As a result, Cooper has just continued to play them as normal because he doesn't really have much else of a choice. We're still seeing the line playing heavy minutes but the only time they're generating chances is when they forecheck and turn the puck over where Johnson can still be effective with his vision and passing abilities."
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,ClassicMach,2,Thu Jun 11 21:26:28 2015 UTC,"Kucherov is also playing a lot of the double shifts with 11 forwards since his game works with Killorn and Stamkos the best probably.  But I agree, I think it's time to go 12-6, bring Drouin in and, nobody wants to do this but; shake up all the lines and see if something works."
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,Daltonkb,2,Fri Jun 12 03:55:02 2015 UTC,hawks fan here. I come in peace. I have noticed this as well but cant seem to find any play where he appears to injure himself. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,Daltonkb,5,Thu Jun 11 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"Not certain, but the slash from Hayes has been questioned. After the slash he wasn't the same"
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,justifications,6,Thu Jun 11 19:12:54 2015 UTC,Looks like he may have hit his upper pelvis bone. That would hurt like hell trying to skate on. Imagine the pressure you put on it with each stride.
TampaBayLightning,39gc91,Ask_Me_If_Im_Stamkos,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I remember at some point seeing a quick highlight during this series (early on) where it looked like he jammed or broke a finger. I think this may also explain why he isn't in on the faceoff. Additionally, he went hard in to the boards skates/coccyx first and he hasn't really been the same since then."

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,OGHamToast,42,Thu Jun 11 02:56:05 2015 UTC,Guantanamo Bay should just convert all their convicts into Lightning and Blackhawk fans and force them to watch this series. It's torture for fans of either team.

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,newcirclejerkmod,18,Thu Jun 11 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"He's considered pretty much the top goalie prospect in the world. Tretiak himself talked about how much talent he saw. That said, he needs some more NHL playtime under his belt to really get his groove on."

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,jakemark13,2,Thu Jun 11 03:06:12 2015 UTC,Talented keeper. On the few outings I've seen him in he has show incredible athleticism. It's a completely different style of keeping from Bishop. I am really concerned with how he will be coached in the future with Franz Jean being in the mix there.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Khue,25,Thu Jun 11 12:33:22 2015 UTC,Cons: the fucking powerplay.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,thatline,14,Thu Jun 11 03:01:35 2015 UTC,"Much pass. Very much pass. Chicago is clogging the fuck out of the middle but it was like the Simpsons soccer joke: "" passes to, passes to, holds it..... Holds it....."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,8,Thu Jun 11 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even mind the passing if they MOVED around the ice, stationary power plays are the easiest thing to defend. Look how dangerous Chicago looks on their PP, just from moving around so much while they pass. And for God's sakes put Stamkos in his spot and take johnson off the PP if he's injured."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,thatline,2,Thu Jun 11 03:14:38 2015 UTC,Yeah Johnson has no business on the PP with that injury but hopefully he benefits from some rest.

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,retro_falcon,14,Thu Jun 11 11:53:58 2015 UTC,Heading back from the game. United center is an amazing venue. Blackhawks fans treated me pretty well. I don't know how we didn't score in the last 3 minutes but what an effort. We have home ice back as a positive.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Broductivity,14,Thu Jun 11 03:21:09 2015 UTC,neither team has control of this series AT ALL. every game could have gone either way and I wouldn't have been surprised. good fucking match-up and absolutely the best two teams in the NHL right now
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,killer_kitten,9,Thu Jun 11 03:56:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Here I was thinking ""God dammit, we could've swept the Hawks tonight if we had just played a bit better...""  Then I realized you could say the same thing about us."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,BrazilianRider,8,Thu Jun 11 07:48:45 2015 UTC,Fuck being this evenly matched!  TB and the Hawks should combine and form a superhuman hockey team to dominate the world.  No one would be able to stop us.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Joesredditaccount1,20,Thu Jun 11 11:57:46 2015 UTC,Fucking shit. I hate losing like that. How the fuck did we not score.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Squeaky_Is_Evil,14,Thu Jun 11 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"Intensity and effort wasn't there for most of the game. The passes were routinely placed where our guys normally would've had them, except the guys just weren't there (we seemed slow on our feet).  We were beat to every puck. We can't win a face off to save our souls, so Chicago can ice the puck with impunity.  There was never anyone in front of Crawford. We tried to be pretty in the game and in the powerplay. It didn't work. 4 power plays and almost no effective shots on net. Little passes to each other that inevitably lead to turnovers.   We had a stretch play work in the last game, and now we tried over and over again to get it to work.  Shout outs to Killorn, Pacquette, Hedman and Kucherov for being the only players with the balls to put in any effort."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,lazybrouf,7,Thu Jun 11 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said, minus the ""intensity and effort wasn't there for most of the game"" part. this team(specifically the defense) busted their ass all night to only allow 19 shots on our rookie goalie compared to 38 against bishop 2 nights ago."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,sidthekid9,2,Thu Jun 11 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not the Hawks were TRYING to not hit the net"

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,ClassicMach,30,Thu Jun 11 03:50:55 2015 UTC,"This is NOTHING like game 1. This is as good a loss as you can have. They won off of a goal that happened due to a funk bounce off a poke check by a rookie goaltender who shut down the tough shots. We played really well. We've got some problems, but we can just absolutely shut that team down for so long, you can't expect them to never get shots."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,fuckyouabunch,7,Thu Jun 11 03:00:48 2015 UTC,can't agree more. we won that game by the skin of our teeth
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,killer_kitten,8,Thu Jun 11 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"Here were mine.   PROS:   Vasy looked pretty good for going in without having a full game in months We played really, really well. Quick, minimal turnovers when compared to the past.  Was it just me or did Morrow have some pretty good moves?   CONS:   Some shots that they actually did take were from some really unlikely angles.  Well... We lost. Despite not playing poorly for the most part.  That power play.  Bishop is hurt, and that sucks No secondary scoring (but not for lack of trying) Killorn's mustache? My heart may have stopped in those last couple of minutes. That said, though, Vasy could have maybe come out earlier.    Wish they could've gone back to Tampa with that third win in their pocket. But oh well. There's still more hockey to be had."

Seabrook saves that game when Stamkos' wide open shot hit his stick and went wide."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,TIFUByJoiningReddit,4,Thu Jun 11 03:44:31 2015 UTC,I will copy what I put in the post game on r/hockey.   Wasn't a must win obviously. Got Bishop a rest. Still a close one with a backup goalie. I am happy.  I will add that Vasy played pretty damn well and I thought that we played a more defensive game than we really needed to . Let's go Bolts!

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,8,Thu Jun 11 03:14:08 2015 UTC,"What is going on with Johnson? He hasn't seemed like himself for the last couple of games, shots off, positioning off, stick handling is garbage. He's gotta have a hand/wrist injury.   And damn Stamkos just needs a goal at some point in this series, I feel like it would wake him up big time."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,CaptainExplorer,7,Thu Jun 11 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering why Stamkos isn't in Johnson's spot on the PP to rip one-timers. Johnson's been slow to shoot a few times now. Even if Stammer's hurt too, I've seen him shoot a few pucks, definitely better than Johnson."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,IamHobs,4,Thu Jun 11 03:32:12 2015 UTC,"They should allow Stamkos to play the same way Ovi does on his PP unit. Get a crowd in front of the net and let him rip some shots, Crawford isn't good at finding rebounds in front of the net."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,CaptainExplorer,2,Thu Jun 11 03:36:52 2015 UTC,"I was wondering that too. I mean, I guess TyJo isn't exactly the guy you want in front of the goalie due to his size and likely injury, but still, Stammer needs to hammer."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,o0DrWurm0o,2,Thu Jun 11 12:20:36 2015 UTC,I think Johnson is hurt. Chicago knows it too. They are keying hard on Stamkos he has a stick on his shadowing him in the zone. It helps that Filps never shoots so they only have to worry about 2/3rds of his line.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Johnson isn't taking faceoffs (he is the best we have) and seems very timid, the last couple of games. He has taken alot of hard hits in every series and is a smaller guy, he must be fighting off an injury and I hope the extra day off helps him return back to form."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Always_Sunnyvale,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"I think Johnson might have an arm injury. That's why he's been weaker on forecheck, bad on passing, doesn't take faceoffs. But that's all speculation from a random fan watching the game."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Cats_and_hedgehogs,6,Thu Jun 11 03:04:16 2015 UTC,Coop said Bish will for sure play again in the series. Thank god
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,TampaFresh,6,Thu Jun 11 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"Tyjo is seriously injured. He's a liability out there, especially on the PP. Vasy isn't ready. He wasn't the cause of the loss, but we played differently sheltering him and it showed. Stamkos is not being the leader on ice he needs to be. This is not new, it's been an issue all season.   Now I have serious concerns, because our home record in the playoffs is shite."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,angelsil,3,Thu Jun 11 03:02:57 2015 UTC,I'm glad you pointed out the TyJo thing. I had a thought on I think the second PP? that he seriously must be hurt because he could barely control the puck or shoot at all. He's been one of our biggest assets but the staff needs to see he can't do much at the moment in terms of play creation.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Bar_Deezy_Snizzz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"Stamkos is playing great, getting his shots, hustling his ass. Yeah, he hasn't scored, but he can't do it every game. I wouldn't question his leadership whatsoever. He's been essential in getting us here, just like the whole team has."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,csampson,2,Thu Jun 11 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"This one hurt. Tampa played a solid game, but on this stage one mistep can cost you everything. Not converting on four powerplays helped no one. Vasy played good, but those Bish will make the saves on the two goals they scored. Putting an injured Johnson on the PP? Really, Coop? If there was ever a time to put Drouin in as an offensive replacement, now is the time.   Either way, it's one less chance we have to put them away. It's a best of three now. Whoever plays the better game will win and Tampa needs to be prepared for that.   On another note, we had 81% possession with Hedman on the ice. He continued to be our best player on the ice."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Thu Jun 11 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"Vasy played alright but holy rebounds.  We can't be giving up second, third, and sometimes even forth chances like that."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,imabear3,2,Thu Jun 11 05:35:20 2015 UTC,"Great game until 10:00 in the 3rd. It's like we didn't know how to make a pass, or even a shot for that matter. I've never seen so many stupid turnovers.  Last 1:00 though, i downed 3 beers."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,hesayswhat,2,Thu Jun 11 06:46:16 2015 UTC,For being cold and not playing for over 2 months..... Vasy was a beast. Yeah one of the goals was soft but only letting 2 goals against the hawks? Pretty amazing.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,jhnybgood47,2,Thu Jun 11 13:50:47 2015 UTC,I honestly feel like each of these games is a toss-up. This might be one of this series where the better team doesn't win (whoever they are) because the difference between the two is so minute a few lucky bounces determine it.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,BrazilianRider,3,Thu Jun 11 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"We've been here all postseason, losing games we shouldn't have but we rebound. I'm not discouraged."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,mrTr0ut,4,Thu Jun 11 02:59:50 2015 UTC,No reason to not be optimistic after a game like that...we played pretty great for the most part and carried a lot of the momentum. I really like our chances if we can play like that every game.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,csampson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:00:32 2015 UTC,This is going to be a seven game series no matter what Tampa fans want. You don't just walk in and usurp the Hawks in 5 or 6. There's just too much talent on their team. They are acting like they've been there before because well... they have.   What I see from the Lightning is a team with some obstacles and they are showing that no matter what they are able to come up with solutions which is an extremely fortunate luxury the Bolts have.  I also feel like Quenneville is a great coach and this is turning into another coaching battle. Coop has had the deck stacked against him the whole playoff and I believe he is doing well.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Khue,2,Thu Jun 11 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"Good...the more hockey, the better :)."

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Prince_Pyro,2,Thu Jun 11 03:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'm confident in this team if they keep playing this way. But, in all honesty we will not win this series if Stamkos doesn't put a couple pucks in the net. Look at the Blackhawks, Kane and Toews are their ""superstars"" and have basically won them a couple series this year. Stammer, our ""superstar"" has been playing great and an amazing leader but he NEEDS to put the puck in if we win this series."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Bar_Deezy_Snizzz,4,Thu Jun 11 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"Vasilevskiy's rebound control is not so great and both the goals may have been avoided if the rebounds went elsewhere, but it is what it is. Also, you would think the highest scoring team in the league would be able to put a goal in out of those billion chances we had there at the end but Crawford was lights out on those.   All in all I hope Bishop gets better but if not I think this was good experience for Vasilevskiy as he did far better than I expected.   P.S. Our faceoffs are AWFUL! We need Johnson back in there, I can tell the difference. I think at one point in the 3rd we only won 2/15 faceoffs...no bueno.   Still 2 more games!!! LETS GO LIGHTNING!!!"
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,n_noto,2,Thu Jun 11 03:02:15 2015 UTC,That second goal wasn't really a rebound he made a stick check and the puck pinballed back like it was in an EAsports game. His worst rebounds actually didn't hurt us.   I think Johnson has a wrist or hand problem. He isn't taking faceoffs because of something physical. I think.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"It's right leg. On the second power play after he turned the puck over he tried to skate after it, but was only able to push off of his left foot three times in a row. I think they're freezing it before the game and at second intermission, but whatever it is, it's fucking him up really badly."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,fuckyouabunch,2,Thu Jun 11 03:14:19 2015 UTC,I will look for that on the replay. It wouldn't explain the faceoffs though. He might be a guy who skates to one side or another when not skating hard I do that all the time when just drifting toward a bench or something because it's a habit from my first days on skates.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:19:23 2015 UTC,"I actually think it does explain the faceoffs. If he's not winning cleanly, he turns over the puck and either kicks the puck back or just tries to hold position for someone to grab it, and he can't do that right now. He just has no strength in that leg, it seems. I'm really hoping the break helps."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,fuckyouabunch,2,Thu Jun 11 03:26:27 2015 UTC,Maybe that is it. I wonder when he got hurt. The last time I remember him doing something at full speed was setting up the Palat goal in game 7.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to dig it up at work tomorrow if I'm not busy, but I think it was game 5 or 6 against NY, when he got banged up right after a Faceoff, IIRC. My guess is ankle, based on that, and hes moving. If it was foot I think they light be able to just freeze it and tape the shit out of it. Maybe knee"

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Knightro2011,2,Thu Jun 11 11:53:13 2015 UTC,"Pros:  So. Much. * Quality chances on so many shifts. Every line had a bunch. We are fucking terrifying on offense. * really solid defense. There aren't a lot of legit complaints there. We're playing the best team the west has to offer. And we're shutting them down almost entirely. * Vasy. Alright, the second goal is his fault, but if you're gonna give one up, that's not a terrible one to take. Poke checks are usually good moves. The first happened on a breakdown at the point. * no too many. Men. No Morrow penalty. Good kills    The cons:   Johnson. Fuck, I really hope a few days off heals him up, cause he is absolutely killing us. He can't play d right now, he can't play pp, we're lucky he's as good as he is. The first goal is actually on him, bad d. Hopefully he heals,cause he can't skate right now, and that's half his game. nesterov. Off night. He's usually pretty solid. Giveaways are still a problem. Faceoff improved, but still aren't great."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,fuckyouabunch,5,Thu Jun 11 03:05:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that Johnson hasn't been playing well, but that first goal is on the shitty as attempted line change by the D2. I think it was Sustr, but I'm not certain. That gave them the odd man rush and started that defensive series."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Robert_The_Tire,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:12:56 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, but the puck was right in front of Johnson at the blue line and he wasn't able to get there. Usually an easy move for him, possibly a breakaway. It's not exactly his fault, as there were other problems,but the puck should have been out."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:15:42 2015 UTC,stralman and carle were the two on the ice when the scored. I believe stralman was the one who stayed out so hedman was the man leaving. So yeah sustr was supposed to be coming on the ice I would guess.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Cats_and_hedgehogs,3,Thu Jun 11 04:50:33 2015 UTC,Second fucking time we lost like that...
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Tenziru,2,Thu Jun 11 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"From my post game thread I deleted  Cons:  the face offs, you can't win a game if you can't win a damn face off  Stamkos had gone back to round one Stamkos. That missed wide open net at the end was inexcusable.  Passing was atrocious all night long  Offensive zone positioning was terrible.   Got forced outside by Chicago's defense all night long. This is more what Chicago did right and less what we did wrong but it has to be said.  Defense got caught pinching  and gave up a lot of odd man rushes  Faceoffs. Win a fucking face off.   Pros:  Played good defensively   Vasy looked good but not great  Found a way to get shots through  Edit: I forgot to say the power play looked like shit. We have scored 1 pp goal all series and it came when the triplets were on the bench. Just something to think about."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Robert_The_Tire,3,Thu Jun 11 03:03:15 2015 UTC,Pros: #1 Vasy was solid for a rookie goalie in the Stanley Cup FINAL in his rookie year!   Cons #1 is a toss up between the PP looking like shit and not winning a faceoff. I'd give it to the PP.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,scratchjack,4,Thu Jun 11 03:12:23 2015 UTC,"He really needs to bench the triplets power play line. It is shit and for the life of me I don't know why Hedman and Garrison don't play more on the pp. I like Stralman, but c'mon he doesn't have Garrison's shot and he doesn't have Hedman's passing ability and reach to hold the zone."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Robert_The_Tire,2,Thu Jun 11 03:15:39 2015 UTC,The power play problems are a fundamental issue with the design. The personnel could score. The pass to the left for a shot thing is the problem it's basically pass left to shoot or cycle. The guy on the right occasionally takes a bad angle into traffic shot but otherwise it cycles again. The worst part though Is the 22 second zone set ups when the other team clears. The team plays a full court press 5 on 5 but a half court offense on the PP. They really would be better off just scrapping the thing for their normal play.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,3,Thu Jun 11 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"Chicago is doing a really great job on the pk, but you do have a good point when I think about it. Chicago is putting on a clinic with the Czech Press, but the umbrella pp is supposed to be an effective counter to the Czech press. It clearly isn't and part of that is because Chicago is doing a good job of using the +1 and the top of their triangle to clog that middle lane and stop passes from going across the ice.   I'm really upset that Stamkos is playing the D2/F4 position because it keeps him tied up in the center where he can not use his good shot. Coop needs to get him out of there and force Chicago to respect the shot. That would open Chicago's triangle up some and make room for other shots to get through.   I hate the 22 seconds of zone time and then clears, but I think it shows the inexperience of the triplets. They either get anxious and try to force a bad pass or they take bad shot into traffic and off the hawks go. Where instead they need to pull it back and skate around and look for other angles to move through. I too think they would be better served playing their normal 5 v 5 offense, but think other pp personal should be given a chance. It's really insulting to the other players to not let them have a chance before you completely say fuck it."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Robert_The_Tire,2,Thu Jun 11 03:43:01 2015 UTC,that wide open net got deflected off by seabrook a bit
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,peejerweejer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:52:59 2015 UTC,That one stung a little but the Bolts are playing a team extremely deep on the roster and with playoff experience. It's to be expected that this series was going to be a slog. Gotta saddle back up and get ready for Game 5.

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,Pavel_Datsyuks_Cat,2,Thu Jun 11 13:32:30 2015 UTC,I thought they played pretty well overall. That game winner and why we lost were pretty similar: bounces. The puck coming back to Saad there was best described as fortunate for him. The bolts especially our top guys were flat out fighting the puck tonight. Also the refs were just overall bad not so much in bias but in the timeliness of their calls/non calls. Some of the calls in icing situations were down right atrocious.   I guess my main point is that Is the 4th game this series Tampa played well enough to win. In all the others there were some stinkers but all 4 here have been well played.
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,2ndprize,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"And as a whole, we've outplayed Chicago much of this series. Nothing to hang your head about. When the two best teams in the NHL go head to head, you're not gonna be winning in 4 or 5."

I just really hope the boys got all of the weird miss the net plays out of their system tonight because it was brutal. Play like that the rest of the way, they'll win 2 of 3. No doubt in my mind."

TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,tcigzies,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:35:06 2015 UTC,"Along with the powerplay, I think a big issue that game was Chicago owning them on face-offs. Also, and I'm seeing it brought up more, but TyJo just isn't producing like the first three series. Hopefully he can get it together.. We can't have him AND Stammer in slumps."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,JMC813,2,Thu Jun 11 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"I think Vasy played fine given the circumstances, but I honestly believe if Bish was in net we would have got that. Recently our team has been made of four players (Killorn/Hedman/Bishop/Paq). A huge difference is that TyJo is almost 100% injured. He has had opportunities to score but he missed a lot of shots that he would usually make. I'm not really worried for the next game, but the home woes need to stop now."
TampaBayLightning,39e0bg,TampaFresh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"but I honestly believe if Bish was in net we would have got that.    Eh, I dunno. Him being injured(?) and also not being decent at rebounds may have led to a similar result to what happened tonight."

Also, I don't really want to say Crawford came up huge at the end as much as he got good bounces. Stamkos off Seabrook's stick, the puck off Kuch's skate at the end, and the other chance that Stammer had was shot directly at Crawford.  Not exactly a highlight reel moment in my opinion.  Yes he played well but he got a lot of bounces at the end."

Those four players, with napkin math, will free up 19.5 million dollars to resign our core (not including the expiration of existing contracts such as Johnson/Palat, Hedman etc). We have the youth to fill in for when these guys are eventually on their way out - Koekkoek is going to hopefully end up like a superior version to Carle, and DeAngelo will hopefully be able to fill in for Coburn as a RH defensemen by that point.   This is why I was very uneasy with the Callahan resigning. His contract will be an anchor in a few years and there is a good chance it will cost us one of Drouin or the triplets, given I doubt there is absolutely no way SY will let Hedman walk. He will command the fattest salary of them all, especially after this post season.   I maintain that management absolutely needs to be prepared to keep the core of Stamkos, Drouin, the Triplets, Hedman and Vasya. They are the players that will lead us to long term success as a franchise."
TampaBayLightning,39g1ww,kiruarracca,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:00:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't rule out keeping Stralman long term. I think Hedman and Stralman will lead our top D-pair for a long time. They're the perfect combination for each other and he's allowed Hedman to elevate his game so much.

TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,ajs2294,6,Wed Jun 10 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"My take aways from tonight; we split the games so far and after game one I said I would be happy with that. Plus, we only lost by one away with a rookie in the net. Few days to rest up now and focus on fixing the little things. You already know Amalie is going to be bumping Saturday night, time to show up on home ice!"

TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,scratchjack,9,Thu Jun 11 02:57:34 2015 UTC,"We have got to get our offense together. Our D has been pretty damned solid this series, but we are turning it over way too much, our puck control is sloppy, and we're letting them live in our zone. With an uncertain Bishop, we gotta start creating opportunities and controlling the pace of the game and not letting them do it."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,angelsil,3,Thu Jun 11 02:53:44 2015 UTC,Looking at the stats I'd have to disagree. Offense has been pretty good as well. We lead in everything except for faceoffs.   Tonight I think the team was too concerned about Vasy in goal and were more in a defensive mode than we should have been. Vasy can hold his own most of the time. The wins he had in the regular season and in the AHL weren't flukes. He deserves this chance to play an entire game and the only missing piece was goals. Talk all you want about the Hawks kitting the post but they weren't hitting the post on purpose. The goal was covered and they had to sneak what goals they had in or have a really excellent shot that no one could have saved.
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,scratchjack,3,Thu Jun 11 03:06:58 2015 UTC,"Tonight I think the team was too concerned about Vasy in goal and were more in a defensive mode than we should have been   I'd agree there.   The wins he had in the regular season and in the AHL weren't flukes.   He...really didn't play that much. He was splitting time in the AHL with Kristers and then was pulled up to backup Bishop when the whole Nabakov experiment went South. Not his fault, but he didn't have NEARLY the amount of games needed this season to walk into a SCF game."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,angelsil,3,Thu Jun 11 03:10:55 2015 UTC,On your second point. Agreed! However considering his experience he better than or at least as well as anyone could expect for a SCF.
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:14:11 2015 UTC,"I think he'd like that second goal back, but really the whole team was playing differently in front of him without the lead we'd garnered in game 2. This loss rests 95% on the forwards. Excepting Killorn, Kucherov and Paquette they didn't get it done tonight."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,imperfectofcourse,6,Thu Jun 11 03:24:24 2015 UTC,My only complaint on offense is that kucherov needs more help. Too many times he's all alone on offense and no one is even in the shot. Johnson's injury has essentially negated him.
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,fuckyouabunch,2,Thu Jun 11 02:57:27 2015 UTC,Soooo many times I saw that happen. Either him or Hedman made a feed pass in front of the net and almost every time NO ONE was there to do anything with it. I figured something would give late in that game but Crawford and  Seabrook stopped that from happening.
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,imperfectofcourse,2,Thu Jun 11 03:01:13 2015 UTC,"Johnson can't keep up right now. Brown needs to get a shift or two with the triplets, maybe.   Edit: with kucherov and palat, hope that's obvious."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,fuckyouabunch,2,Thu Jun 11 03:06:50 2015 UTC,I agree. Something is clearly off with Johnson's game right now
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,Reanimated_Nerd,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:10:28 2015 UTC,"Right leg. Check it he can't even put much weight. On wide left turns, he's nearly falling, and he can't push off of it."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,tampaheat,5,Thu Jun 11 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, not to be argumentative... But the Bolts spent a ton of time in the Hawks zone. I think more so then the Hawks spent in the Bolts zone."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:55:10 2015 UTC,Time != Quality Scoring Chances  Our two biggest guys in these playoffs have become invisible. Johnson and Stamkos are doing nothing out there
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,TheEvilKingStan,2,Thu Jun 11 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"Johnson is definitely hurt, he doesn't seem nearly as explosive as he was earlier in the playoffs. And Stamkos just seems to be in his own head a lot...passing up chances, hesitating on shots, missing goals that he definitely has enough talent to make. I wonder if the pressure of the finals is sinking in."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,retro_falcon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:16:22 2015 UTC,Johnson is hurt. Stamkos had a bunch of great shots. And is living in the crease. Someone's got to be there
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,TheEvilKingStan,7,Thu Jun 11 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the Blackhawks enjoy this win because it's going to be really difficult to get another one from the Lightning. My only complaint in this game is that our PP has gone back to 0. This series feels a little bit like the Detroit series, but with more offense. Stamkos looks snakebitten and Johnson was noticeably off tonight. He had a hard time corralling pucks and made a few mental errors."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,retro_falcon,2,Thu Jun 11 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"Holding the puck to long, carrying it behind the net and turning it over, not connecting on our passes. Need to clean it up."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,TheEvilKingStan,3,Thu Jun 11 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the passes weren't very crisp tonight and I've noticed that sometimes Tampa has those games where they have issues making passes. Either way, would have turned the puck over. Zone entry and exit were issues tonight too. Point being, that game was very winnable, but Crawford made some good saves and we didn't bury our chances. Next game will be stronger I believe."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,Squorn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:20:22 2015 UTC,"We had good entry into their zone but wouldn't do anything with it. Lots of take it in skate behind their net, turn it over, repeat. Or dump it into the corner, lose the battle for the puck and turn it over. Had issues handling passes that either lead to turn overs or weak shots. We were a second to slow on a few of the passes too."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,Reanimated_Nerd,2,Thu Jun 11 04:01:49 2015 UTC,I think Bishop would have made a difference in this game.  I don't think that 2nd goal would have gone by Bish.
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,fuckyouabunch,0,Thu Jun 11 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. Vasy did well, but I think Bishop would have gotten that one. Do you think we'll see him again this series? I hope so"
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,retro_falcon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"Worst part about that second goal is that the poke check worked, the puck went back between Goalie-Puncher's skates, hit Stralman's skate, and bounced right back."

TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,BrazilianRider,2,Thu Jun 11 02:56:29 2015 UTC,"He doesn't poke check very often, so no, probably not. But they shot at his weakest spot, high glove from that side, a lot, and vasy shut it down. In fact, they had a lot of shots in weird spots that bish tends to have trouble with. Kid played great. He wants that one back, but I'm a fan of the poke check in general. You don't see it much anymore."
TampaBayLightning,39ctsx,GeneralChaz9,2,Thu Jun 11 02:56:26 2015 UTC,"Agree with this, Vasy played great last night and kept us in it. Bishop in his current state would have given up a that second goal as well if not more. No one got to Saad on that last goal he went from side to side without being touched, besides from Vasy. Bishop is having trouble going from right to left which is exactly what Saad did. Instead of Saad going 5 hole he would have had the whole net open. A 100% bishop on the other hand is a different story."

TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,mikewoodld,15,Thu Jun 11 00:02:01 2015 UTC,I'm less worried about Vasi's jitters and more worried about what is wrong with Bishop!
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,PoopOnTheHallWalls,9,Wed Jun 10 23:47:54 2015 UTC,I think everyone could tell he wasnt healthy the last night. I didnt expect him to keep playing with that discomfort we saw.
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,PoopOnTheHallWalls,4,Wed Jun 10 23:49:06 2015 UTC,Agreed (though I know some who REALLY think it's all an act).  I just want to know if it's serious or if they're just trying to give him a day or two to get healthy.
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,Alycion,2,Thu Jun 11 00:04:30 2015 UTC,good point
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,fuckyouabunch,11,Wed Jun 10 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"Speculation is that this move gets bish a shitload if rest before game 5.  Smart move, if so.   Vasy is very cool, looks loose in warmups right now. I'm psyched to see him play."
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,Cats_and_hedgehogs,5,Wed Jun 10 23:52:20 2015 UTC,He's looked good in all his relief appearances as well.
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,fuckyouabunch,3,Wed Jun 10 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"Well, when we played in front of him, anyway."
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,thetankster,9,Wed Jun 10 23:59:37 2015 UTC,"Listen, if the D was able to assist a hobbling bishop who was very slow to his feet even when the puck was in our zone then they got this.

TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,PSU_Arcite,3,Wed Jun 10 23:57:49 2015 UTC,the D allowed 18 shots or something like that in the first period of game 3... I hope Vassy doesn't have to deal with that
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,Claustrophobopolis,6,Thu Jun 11 00:11:00 2015 UTC,YES HE CAN!
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,Winston_the_dog,5,Thu Jun 11 00:04:00 2015 UTC,I've been following Vasy since before he was drafted. I was so amped Tampa took him when they did. I'm really excited for this start tonight. The kid loves high pressure games
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,Durbanpoisonyo,5,Thu Jun 11 00:14:25 2015 UTC,Next Carey Price imo. Non lightning fan here and I've been following him since the world juniors in 2010

TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,BodyLikeAMicrochip,3,Thu Jun 11 00:17:53 2015 UTC,any word on Bishop? I doubt it... just being hopeful.. we're 2 wins away
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,OGHamToast,2,Wed Jun 10 23:49:23 2015 UTC,I think Cooper said at some point that they were keeping quiet on everything Bishop related until everything is over. Smart move imo
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:08:14 2015 UTC,Not that ive heard they are still keeping it quiet.
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,Blake1288,3,Wed Jun 10 23:51:46 2015 UTC,Depends on the player who shows up. He's an inconsistent yet promising young goalie and our win will largely depend on if he is able to get into the zone or if he struggles. Puck tracking and rebound control worry me far more than his athleticism and positioning.
TampaBayLightning,39d6v1,Blake1288,3,Thu Jun 11 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"This will take a 100% team effort from the Lightning. I think AV can do it, but he's going to need a lot of help from our defense and our offense."

TampaBayLightning,39gxe5,jpmad,13,Thu Jun 11 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"It would probably take something you guys don't have or want to give up.  The story is he hurt his hand in training camp and missed it.  He has unreal talent but has struggled to fit into the defensive roles of Cooper's system.  He is being scratched now because he isn't really a grinder but that is the only spot where there is an opening If his defense was better he would be playing.  He really fell into a bad spot.  He is way too good now for the CHL, but he wasn't eligible to play in the AHL so he ended up in a bottom 6 role here which wasn't his strong suit. He still had some decent offensive production considering he played like 8 minutes a night."
TampaBayLightning,39gxe5,2ndprize,8,Thu Jun 11 17:31:55 2015 UTC,No. Because I hate Malkin. So no.

TampaBayLightning,39gxe5,2ndprize,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:53:08 2015 UTC,I distinctly remember this moment between Malkin and Lecavalier.   Never liked Malkin and even though the punch was a little extra it made me pretty happy.
TampaBayLightning,39gxe5,TIFUByJoiningReddit,7,Fri Jun 12 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"Like 2nd prize said, you don't have the pieces. All of those NHL players are your throwaways, none of them would make the Lightning roster out of a training camp. The rift between Drouin and the team is entirely created by the media. If someone wants him it's going to take an absurd offer.     You're not considering our needs in this. The only thing we are kind of lacking is a playmaking, left handed left winger to feed Stamkos. Trading Drouin is counterproductive to the team plan. And I think you're undervaluing him based on your list."

TampaBayLightning,39gxe5,chimichanga9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:32:43 2015 UTC,No way! PIT is super stacked defensively. So much so that it was announced yesterday that the Penguins would not re-sign Martin or Ehrhoff and will plan to buy-out/trade Scuderi to bring the average age of the defense down to 23.5!

TampaBayLightning,39db2b,Alycion,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:30:00 2015 UTC,Chicago already knows it's something on his left side
TampaBayLightning,39db2b,reptilians13,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:07:30 2015 UTC,"But knowing it's something and knowing exactly what it is is a huge difference. Guessing and trying to exploit is harder then knowing and exploiting. He's shown he can play with it, and it could be something a few days of rest heals up just enough to get him playing well enough to shut them down. They will try to guess and exploit. Any team would do that. But knowing what exactly is wrong gives away the seriousness of the issue and makes it a lot easier to take advantage of."
TampaBayLightning,39db2b,Alycion,7,Fri Jun 12 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"From the looks of things he's either got a groin pull, or a messed up ligament in his knee.  They let him play on it, so it can't be to bad.  Hard to say whether five days rehabbing out will be enough for him to come back.  I remain hopeful."
TampaBayLightning,39db2b,Squorn,2,Thu Jun 11 01:06:17 2015 UTC,Cortisone shot and he is in game 5. You could tell he got something in the third game after the second period

TampaBayLightning,39db2b,SouthsideHyde,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:57:46 2015 UTC,i'm hoping they just wanted to give him more days rest since we were up 2-1 and he was clearly hurting. i think he starts game 5.

TampaBayLightning,39cfjj,frockinbrock,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:45:45 2015 UTC,It probably takes a lot less resources to run it in the park than it would in the arena. Typically the rains stop by the time the games start anyway. It was the flooding that I think cancelled the party.

Continuing to drink coffee and answer e-mails so people think I'm working or something.  10:13AM First status meeting of the day complete. TIL people at work seem to talk about work and my boss is uninterested in Bishop's status and more concerned with me doing ""work"" and meeting ""timelines"". Note to self: CC the boss in some of these e-mails today. That should throw him off.  12:09PM I'd like to announce that we have finally made it to PM! We are now living in the afternoon of SCF game 4! Anyway, I had lunch in the break area and I was loudly proclaiming my love for Kucherov by shouting things like, ""I LOVE KUCH"" and ""KUCHIE RULES"" while watching highlight videos on my phone to get pumped up. I thought it would get people to come watch them with me but it more or less emptied the room. Figured people would know I was watching hockey videos by saying that. On another note, I keep getting calls from HR. Think I am just going to let those ring.  2:24PM My whiteboard has turned from meaningful engineering drawings to crude sketches of lightning bolts and Thunderbug. The storm is passing through Orlando now coming in from Tampa (thanks for sharing the Lightning with us O-Town folk; team and weather included) and every rumble of thunder makes me long for the work day to end so I can throw on my jersey and be the thunder. Time for another pot of coffee.  5:05PM My excitement level is getting too high and I am in need of hockey and booze soon. The only good part is that the non-hockey-watching-heathens are going home to their ""families"". Psshhtt. My family is waiting for me at the bar to scream and shout at a TV with thunderous ferocity.

TampaBayLightning,39a8qy,MoreWeight,15,Wed Jun 10 21:03:17 2015 UTC,I find it interesting how quickly Cooper adjusted going into Chicago. For the first two games he was line matching Pacquette against Toews which is something he almost never does. Obviously it was very effective so he tried to keep doing it in the UC but because Chicago gets last change he was never able to match the lines up properly. He realized this fairly quickly and stopped trying to line matched and just rolled the lines he wanted and it worked magically.   After getting outshot 19-7 in the first we started outshooting them 17-7 in the second and a huge part of that was because we were just letting our guys play rather than chasing their lines around.  Since we've made this adjustment we've seen a ton more production from our third line. Rather than playing a shutdown role we're seeing Callahan and Pacquette matched against Chicago's weakest defensive pair and they're really exploiting them.   Excited to see if we can continue to exploit this in game 4.
TampaBayLightning,39a8qy,sweaty_obesity,5,Wed Jun 10 12:26:24 2015 UTC,"After seemingly being frustrated by detroit, its amazing how he is handling the period to period adjustments.

TampaBayLightning,39a8qy,3ofClubs,7,Wed Jun 10 13:45:12 2015 UTC,What are the chances we could take 3-1 and get the cup brought into Amalie Friday at home? I can't wait to see those white gloved keepers of the most beautiful thing in the world
TampaBayLightning,39a8qy,MoreWeight,8,Wed Jun 10 12:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well the Hawks aren't about to let this series slip to 3-1 heading to Amalie. Just like Game 2 was a must win for us before we went to the UC, they're gonna come out guns blazing to make sure we don't head home with such an advantage. We've got to be flawless tonight. But we can do that."
TampaBayLightning,39a8qy,showers_with_grandpa,2,Wed Jun 10 12:48:17 2015 UTC,"I fully expect a monster effort from them tonight. We need a masterful game by Bish and the team defense. However, I am wondering if Oduya is still hurting, how much of an impact will that have? TVR and Cumiskey will have more ice time, which bodes very well for us."
TampaBayLightning,39a8qy,thedaj,2,Wed Jun 10 15:00:29 2015 UTC,That game is Saturday but yes this is my hope.

LETS GO BOLTS!!  Kind of on a side note, I love Jon Cooper and the fact that he has a history in the practice of law...always makes him quick-witted and well spoken in any situation he's put in, i.e. on the bench, during game 3, ""Well he's 6'7"", so of course it takes him a little longer to get up."""

Also the balls they had to say that we ""stole"" game 3 was  an absolute punch to the dick. Blew me away, still pissy about it honestly. When we come out on top, they'll know who we are then.

TampaBayLightning,3943w8,J0hnny2x4,9,Tue Jun 9 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair they know everything there is to know about hockey, seeing as how they've been fans since 2010."

TampaBayLightning,3943w8,Brittle_Bones_Bishop,9,Tue Jun 9 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"Been sick with what the doctors think is the plague... well not the plague mono(not confirmed yet) but it might as well be the plague though. I've been stabbed 10 times in 5 days with needles lookin like a druggie, been to the hospital twice doctors once, dropped 8 pounds since late Friday night, learned what mono is and why If I do have it, Dehydration sucks, nausea sucks, an enlarged spleen sucks, swollen limphnodes suck, fatigue sucks,  muscle aches suck. I'm 21 and I've been living on my parents bedroom floor for 6 days in that time I've finally graduated HS, had a graduation party plus two important hockey games to watch and have enjoyed none of them.  But then again were leading the series 2-1 and for the first time in a week I ate real solid food and didn't immediately chuck it into the toilet bowel so I'll take what I can get.  GO BOLTS FOR MY SPLEEN!!! GO"
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,2ndprize,4,Tue Jun 9 03:35:07 2015 UTC,That sucks dude
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,MoreWeight,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:39:07 2015 UTC,You have been suspected of mono for 5 days and no one knows yet? They have a rapid test for that (immediate results) and the lab test shouldnt take more than 48 hours for the confirmation of mono. Odd.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,Brittle_Bones_Bishop,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:11:32 2015 UTC,Neither hospital visit checked for it and I wasn't at me dr until yesterday afternoon and they took the blood then.

TampaBayLightning,3943w8,angelsil,6,Tue Jun 9 03:09:24 2015 UTC,You stayed home tonight why the hell aren't you on acid??? Oh wait.... beer. Carry on
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,ElMorono,4,Tue Jun 9 03:37:16 2015 UTC,12 hours from now I have to assess whether a house in Ybor is actually suitable for purchase. Acid might not be the drug of choice for that.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,angelsil,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:43:12 2015 UTC,Why Ybor? Is it a nicer/cheaper area?
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,MoreWeight,5,Tue Jun 9 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"It's walking distance to 90% of the pubs we frequent and we can take the trolley to games. I've been hanging out in Ybor for over 20 years, so I might as well be the first wave of urban pioneers in East Ybor. But, yeah, the house we're buying is under $150,000. So there's that."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,angelsil,2,Tue Jun 9 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"Cheaper?  Yes. Nicer? No. A very small amount of it is okay, but it is surrounded by ghetto on every side."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,MoreWeight,2,Tue Jun 9 04:08:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of the hubbub about Ybor is exaggerated, in my opinion. But then I lived in Seminole Heights back when people said the same thing there and now it's like a hipster commune."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,angelsil,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think it is dangerous. Its not dangerous, just has poor areas all over. I think the recession hurt Ybor. It would have seen a seminole heights like resurgence had the bubble not burst. And even still, some cool things are going on down there."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,JeanLouWheezy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There are areas of Tampa that I consider far more dangerous than Ybor, but I'm still not likely to leave my doors unlocked or anything. The recession hit Ybor so hard, because it was reliant on disposable income going to restaurants, bars and other entertainment.  Tons of investment going into Ybor right now, which is why we're looking at buying. Not just bars/clubs this time, but residential companies buying up older homes and restoring them for sale or rental. We're looking at a historically restored 90 year-old bungalow, for example. I think with the direction Channelside is heading, you'll see development move towards Ybor along the streetcar line. Or at least we hope!"
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,emotoaster,9,Tue Jun 9 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how we pulled that off, but we showed why we are here. We are a force to be reckoned with. Never count us out, even with a hurt goalie."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,Cats_and_hedgehogs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"You might survive to the eye of the storm, but don't forget there is always the back half! GO BOLTS GO! LIGHTNING STRIKES THRICE!"
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,n_noto,7,Tue Jun 9 07:08:51 2015 UTC,Pros  That 3rd line seemed to like the pairing Chicago put them against.  Bishop played pretty awesome for an injured goalie.  The number 2 line bringing it right back after giving up the lead.  We won in the UC and have home ice back.    Cons  Bishop isn't 100%.  Too many turnovers from weak plays.  JT Brown still hasn't been able to finish and score.    Just two more wins baby! Let's take the game Wednesday and get the cup on home turf!  GO BOLTS!
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,aaronweber29,14,Tue Jun 9 03:33:36 2015 UTC,2 more baby!!! Huge win!
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,Bad-Yeti,20,Tue Jun 9 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or is Paquette pretty lovable?  Go Tampa, slay the dragon and bring the cup back east!"
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,MoreWeight,8,Tue Jun 9 03:07:08 2015 UTC,"Not just you. It is easy to pick on him when not getting points, but the boy is a beast. Hot Paquettes!"
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,Bad-Yeti,3,Tue Jun 9 03:34:07 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is, when he isnt having great games, he is almost invisible. He wont be throwing huge hits, wont be making big plays, it is almost like he is hurt at times (very well could be, but I am referring to regular season too).  However, when he is on, he does almost everything right. Wins faceoffs, PKs, hits, scores. He is a force when he has a good game."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,MoreWeight,3,Tue Jun 9 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"100% agree. Almost the forgotten man. Chicago definitely forgot about him tonight and he made them pay. A lot of what he does goes unnoticed, but he is out there making plays, if not points. I love this team so much. Everyone has so much heart and are incredibly likeable. They need a cup."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,PaisleyFox,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:24:14 2015 UTC,They are so hungry. It is amazing. I have never seen a bolts team like this. They are so resilient.

TampaBayLightning,3943w8,fleetandpassive,7,Tue Jun 9 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"No matter what happens from here on out, we have proved we are a team and fanbase to be reckoned with."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,MeVicCar,8,Tue Jun 9 03:32:47 2015 UTC,I'm really looking forward to another Paquette post game interview.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,Reanimated_Nerd,6,Tue Jun 9 03:04:31 2015 UTC,"My favorite game so far. Had a gut feeling we were going to lose this one, with the way the second half of the first period went.  Chicago is so scary, but we're pulling games out from under them!"
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,sarnald,10,Tue Jun 9 03:19:17 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with you guys pulling wins outta your asses against the Hawks... They (Chicago) did it on several occasions against my Ducks.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,2ndprize,6,Tue Jun 9 03:20:51 2015 UTC,I got in my car yesterday morning and the radio was turned down. I thought to myself about it being odd because I always play music. Reach down turn it up aaand thunderstruck is playing. I knew then and there we would win last night. I had the feeling all day and it worked out! Go bolts!
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,resarfydo,12,Tue Jun 9 13:31:36 2015 UTC,So much stress. I think I might need something stronger than alcohol to finish the series.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,biclighterburns,6,Tue Jun 9 03:01:58 2015 UTC,"Fucking way to be Bishop, playing through what was obvious pain to keep us in it. What a trooper, can't say enough good things about him tonight"
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,Robert_The_Tire,6,Tue Jun 9 03:13:22 2015 UTC,Mishkin's call on the Palat goal was a thing of beauty. GO BOLTS!
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,blueandgoldjli,5,Tue Jun 9 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"Real gritty win for them to stick it out and come back swinging in the second period. They clearly were not the better team in the first and got way lucky, but the bottom 6 keeps playing great. Strangle hold them on Wednesday."
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,higgiefresh,6,Tue Jun 9 04:00:05 2015 UTC,Palat and Hedman have been amazing this series.

TampaBayLightning,3943w8,PaisleyFox,3,Tue Jun 9 03:49:59 2015 UTC,How was parking down there?
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,BeelzeBubba13,4,Tue Jun 9 12:39:05 2015 UTC,Not bad at all. We arrived at 6 though. We weren't familiar enough with downtown to try and find the free after whatever hour meters so we settled for a lot for $8.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,trolololyork,3,Tue Jun 9 13:44:51 2015 UTC,"I'm somewhat familiar with downtown, but I probably would have given up searching for free parking pretty quickly.  Thank you for the feedback.  :-) GO BOLTS!"

TampaBayLightning,3943w8,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Tue Jun 9 07:11:13 2015 UTC,I'm in favor of this song... Thunderstruck is played out plus this one is stranger which I find much more amusing.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,trolololyork,9,Tue Jun 9 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Two more wins. The hardest they have faced in their entire careers. The hype is real, but our boys must soldier on. Continue the fight."

TampaBayLightning,3943w8,f0gax,3,Tue Jun 9 03:35:14 2015 UTC,Just a FYi over at the Hawks subreddit they're freaking out. Which is crazy because I feel Hawks making scoring look so easy and natural as the bolts are fighting for every goal.  We just can't play soft d like we did in the first period power play (wtf was that) or lay off the gas like in game one (should be 3-0). There's no cruise control playing against the Hawks. We are our worst enemy.  Go Bolts!!!
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,princelabia,3,Tue Jun 9 06:22:53 2015 UTC,We just can't play soft d like we did in the first period power play (wtf was that) or lay off the gas like in game one (should be 3-0). There's no cruise control playing against the Hawks. We are our worst enemy.   Came here for this. When the Bolts have played their game with aggressiveness at both ends it's mostly turned out well. When they didn't it didn't. Hardly expert analysis on my part to be sure. But it's been true for the entire playoffs more or less.
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,fuckyouabunch,3,Tue Jun 9 09:31:24 2015 UTC,I thought we were going to be swept
TampaBayLightning,3943w8,fitzgerald1337,8,Tue Jun 9 03:09:21 2015 UTC,/s  You dropped that
TampaBayLightning,395wey,fuckyouabunch,4,Tue Jun 9 14:07:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think if the Panthers were started in an area like Jacksonville or Orlando they would be much better. Look at the culture down there, the demographic. You're asking a basketball, soccer town to like hockey. Even those teams when they are not winning suffer. I think there needs to be more done to integrate hockey down there."
TampaBayLightning,395wey,fueledbychar,4,Tue Jun 9 15:57:35 2015 UTC,I was on south beach this past weekend and caught the 3rd period of game 2 at a crowded bar. I was shocked at how crazy the bar got when we scored. I thought I was the only one there paying attention. I was high fiving strangers after we won. I even got asked if we won by a few people on the street when they saw my lightning shirt.
TampaBayLightning,395wey,flabeachbum,2,Wed Jun 10 00:59:35 2015 UTC,That's awesome to hear. Floribros!
TampaBayLightning,395wey,fueledbychar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:38:29 2015 UTC,That really shocks me to be honest. I was down there for a Lightning vs Panthers game and no one batted an eye. Will be at the draft though!
TampaBayLightning,395wey,fueledbychar,3,Wed Jun 10 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"The strangest thing about Miami sports to me is the Marlins. I get that they had a shitty owner, but I would think that town would be baseball crazy.  The Panthers also have a similar problem to the Rays: shitty location. From Miami it's like 30-40 minutes without traffic. And there's never been a time in the last 30 years where there was no traffic down there."
TampaBayLightning,395wey,fueledbychar,2,Tue Jun 9 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"That is another factor I didnt even think about. yes I hate going down there for that reason.   There are too many things that work against hockey being down there, at least here everything is close and a TON of up northerners are here to spread the love of hockey too."
TampaBayLightning,395wey,millionaremattdavis,2,Tue Jun 9 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"I think it'll happen there too. They've got a good young team that's going to be tough the next few years. I could see them starting to get into the playoffs as soon as next season, and that kind of success is good for the community to start gaining more interest. Go hockey!"

He fired their manager and replaced him with the teams GM who hadn't been in a dugout in like 30 years. Even if I were the biggest Marlin fan in the world, I wouldn't want to give that asshole my money."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,infinitecrest,18,Wed Jun 10 06:32:25 2015 UTC,Wait a second: the only time Richie has gotten booed is when Chicago is on the PP. And we always boo the puck carrier on the power play until they've entered the zone. That's it. We always do that. I know of no one who has any ill will to Richie.
TampaBayLightning,399mid,fuckyouabunch,8,Wed Jun 10 12:05:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I think he's mistaking it with the power play boos."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Hey_Wayne,4,Wed Jun 10 12:20:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely. We do very little booing otherwise. Marty, and that's about it. Occasionally for a  player after a hit we feel is dirty, but not often. One of the things I like about lightning fans is how much more we cheer than boo. I feel the opposite is true of some fan bases, and I think that would suck."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,fuckyouabunch,8,Wed Jun 10 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"We also boo Subban, but that's just NHL tradition."

TampaBayLightning,399mid,Mauldrich,2,Wed Jun 10 15:43:25 2015 UTC,Although not as much hate this year due to his charity stuff he's done.  My girlfriend used to hate Oven Chicken almost as bad as Subban.  Almost.
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Mauldrich,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:49:54 2015 UTC,Do you think we will continue to boo St. Louis after this year?  He did a ton for our team when he was here.  He definitely deserved EVERY OUNCE of hate he got from us this year.  I was there for every game against them including the playoffs and lead many boo's when that midget touched the puck. But I am curious what the majority of fans will do next year
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Hey_Wayne,4,Wed Jun 10 12:36:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say I won't continue to boo Marty next season, but a lot depends on what he does. Everytime I think I've stopped being angry at traitor hobbit, he opens his mouth and says something shitty about Tampa."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,angelsil,3,Wed Jun 10 14:14:55 2015 UTC,"I will stop booing him when he...   Retires Is not playing us that day Re-signs for us for a day just to retire his jersey Says a tearful sorry that he left us in the lurch just before Playoff season, and that he should have kept personal matters apart from the rest of the Lightning."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Claustrophobopolis,3,Wed Jun 10 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"But that Cally snipe, tho.   I think it was a good move for us, bad move for Marty. Hell, we can almost thank Cally for bringing Boyle and Anton with him. I was saddened to see him leave; however, I think we got the better end of the deal."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Blake1288,2,Wed Jun 10 16:01:58 2015 UTC,I really hope he doesn't re-sign with us for a day to retire.

TampaBayLightning,399mid,andrewthemexican,2,Wed Jun 10 14:04:05 2015 UTC,"Yea I ignored those people.  We celebrated his success for 10 years, little midget boy can take some hate for a while.  I think the ratio of those who no longer give a F*** will increase next year.    Go Bolts!"
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Hey_Wayne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"I have been in the dgaf camp for quite awhile. I didn't like the way it went down, but what are we supposed to do? Make him stay? Or have a player who doesn't want to be here? Fuck it, move on. We're better off without the contract he was on, I like Cally better, we got picks for it. Good trade."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,fuckyouabunch,2,Wed Jun 10 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely a great trade on our end, nothing worse than a locker room cancer.  Especially if that person is the Captain of the team."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Hey_Wayne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:45:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't mistaken anything:  I've been watching intently (because damnit, why couldn't Anaheim have won game 7 in the WCF so that I could actually cheer on our Bolts live) and Richards seems to get the same reaction as St Louis did in the ECF series."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Hey_Wayne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:27:07 2015 UTC,I'll take your word then honestly.
TampaBayLightning,399mid,justifications,3,Wed Jun 10 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Richards won Conn Smythe for Tampa back in the cup run year. He's hard to forget about and his contributions will probably never be forgotten about. The boos were there but muffled, before he scored, and after he scored it was a totally different situation, people boo him every time he touches the puck.  The Richards trade will always mark the start of a very dark time for Tampa. We were under a lot of misguided leadership, the stadium was declining, and in return for his trade we got some moderately promising returns that were very short lived. At the time, we were trying to resolve a goal-tending situation. We searched years for a starter before we ended up with Bishop... but I digress.  The bottom line is that he was signed in to a completely unrealistic contract back at the end of 2006. He was on the rumor mill all year long for trade bait, but he was loved by the fans for his contributions during 2004. His trade came at the bewitching final hours of the trade deadline to a lot of disbelief, and in spirit, I hope that when fans are boo'ing Brad Richards, they are actually boo'ing the decisions made by Oren Koule's hockey club.

It's not like I'm against booing the other team; it's that I felt it was disproportionate and involved one of Tampa's Greats.  Now, I can hear the boos in peace."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Tenziru,2,Wed Jun 10 17:56:43 2015 UTC,"Booing opposing team... why do people think its a specific person, brad isn't even on the lightning and hasnt been for a long time so why does that even matter..."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,chimichanga9,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:11:56 2015 UTC,"Because when you see the Lightning play the Blackhawks in Tampa they boo whenever Richards has the puck.  It's obvious, and I was wondering if there was another explanation for it."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Hey_Wayne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, well he did score so probably it"
TampaBayLightning,399mid,ChillyToTheBroMax,2,Wed Jun 10 07:29:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is taking the boos personally. What are they supposed to do, cheer? I think it is just the basic nature of the situation. Richards is a Blackhawk now."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Claustrophobopolis,2,Wed Jun 10 08:28:42 2015 UTC,"But they're mostly silent when any other Blackhawk has the puck.  That's what I was pointing out: the disparity in the boos.  I wouldn't ask for anyone to cheer him (ex-Lightning or not).  I was just wondering why him...considering he's one of our best players of all time.  I'd show him quiet respect, if anything."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Jwhidde4,4,Wed Jun 10 09:20:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest.  I've been at every game we've played the Blackhawks and didn't notice any booing for specific players.  In fact, the only booing I heard was when the Hawks were on the power play and they were entering their zone."
TampaBayLightning,399mid,Tenziru,0,Wed Jun 10 12:19:47 2015 UTC,I watch on tv and I definitely notice Brad get booed.
TampaBayLightning,399mid,biclighterburns,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:10:36 2015 UTC,"I think it happens with every ex-Lightning, especially during a Stanley Cup Playoffs or Finals when we don't need ex-players trying to knock us out of the tourney!   I like BR and appreciate everything he's done for the franchise but would probably boo him during the game if I was there, especially when he scores ffs! After the game I would buy him a beer though. Marty on the other hand...... :)"

What I saw the last few games is that the bolts are playing better hockey than the Hawks.   You guys should have 3-0. We're lucky that you guys made enough mistakes while we put pressure on in the last period of the first game.
TampaBayLightning,395yci,ScaresCrows,2,Tue Jun 9 18:19:03 2015 UTC,"Eh game 1 was a feeling out process where we learned we can't defend the lead. We keep offensive pressure, we keep your stars putting pucks on the rush. You guys scare me when you set up in the corners and keep it cycling. You guys are skating way too many pucks into the zone. I would like to see more blue line pressure and increase dump ins where our quick dmen can field them at the boards. We have some tweaking to do. The star drought on your team has me worried, afraid of a explosion and hoping we can keep our top d on your top guys. Q is playing lines to our match ups, which is very smart. Once you get the long change again at Amalie it will be easier for coop to get the good matchups"

I'll copy my pros and cons over  Pros  That 3rd line seemed to like the pairing Chicago put them against.  Bishop played pretty awesome for an injured goalie.  The number 2 line bringing it right back after giving up the lead.  We won in the UC and have home ice back.    Cons  Bishop isn't 100%.  Too many turnovers from weak plays.  JT Brown still hasn't been able to finish and score.    Just two more wins baby! Let's take the game Wednesday and get the cup on home turf! Also interesting tidbit the Lightning are still undefeated in playoff games that Brad Richards scores in. Haha  GO BOLTS!

I keep making the mistake of going to the Hawks subreddit to read their opinions on the games. Never contribute. Never vote.  But I see the same thing repeated over and over and over: ""We're better than Tampa"". How can you possibly say that? We're leading the series. And had Tampa not turtled in Game 1, who's to say we wouldn't be up 3-0 in the series?  I keep seeing ""Bishop isn't good"". He stopped 36 shots, pulled out the win, all while playing very obviously injured.  Shut the fuck up. I know that you're upset your ""veteran team"" is getting beat by a ""young, inexperienced, bad"" team, but give the fucking Lightning some credit.  Our team is solid. They KNOW they can win. Our fans are great. We have a lot of them and they are fucking passionate.  And most importantly, we own the Series Lead in the Stanley Cup Final."

TampaBayLightning,395whm,trolololyork,2,Tue Jun 9 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that too, but have no idea why."
TampaBayLightning,395whm,Blake1288,2,Tue Jun 9 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"They definitely said that, but I didn't hear any questions about it after the game from media. There's definitely no press allowed in the locker room during intermissions, either, so we may not know anything until the Final is over.  EDIT: Thinking about it more, now. Yzerman is super hands-off about coaching , personnel, etc. Maybe he was just there to find out what was up with Bish?"
TampaBayLightning,395whm,fuckyouabunch,2,Tue Jun 9 14:42:42 2015 UTC,In Yzer we trust. Sure hope to find out after the finals.
TampaBayLightning,394jq0,doctorlust,7,Tue Jun 9 05:19:44 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see Hedman getting some heat - most of the time the media (and even the public/fans) focuses on offensive players because, well, they make goals and such... which is awesome, but people tend to forget the playmakers and support players that make those players shine.   I may be slightly biased, both as a huge fan of defensemen AND Hedman <3 (wearing my Hedman jersey as I type this), but the Hedman-Stralman combo has been the backbone of this post-season. If anyone other than Johnson deserves to be looked at by the Conn Smythe guys, it's Hedman by far. I've been saying that since the first series. He's a fantastic skater for his size, plays a very physical and aggressive game, makes great plays, and his potential is massive if he keeps it up."
TampaBayLightning,394jq0,NuclearSky,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more, easily one of my favorite players to watch. He has so much god damn drive when he's out there, playing half the game at 110%. It's amazing to see how quick he is and control of the puck is just fun to watch. That slapshot pass was literally the sexiest thing I've ever seen."
TampaBayLightning,394jq0,NuclearSky,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:28:16 2015 UTC,Indeed. One day I hope to be half as good a defense(wo)man as he is. His puck control is impressive.
TampaBayLightning,394jq0,TheMMApodcast,3,Wed Jun 10 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"Chances are he doesn't get the Conn Smythe, even if the Bolts win. But I pointed that out to my buddy tonight watching the game, Hedman is probably our MVP."
TampaBayLightning,394jq0,SNl9ER,2,Tue Jun 9 06:47:03 2015 UTC,I'm thinkin Johnson is still in the running there. But hedman is on his tail.

Believe it or not, athletes love playing down here because the weather is great and plenty of investments in Florida. I had the same questioning mentality when I moved here and started playing mens league.  I thought I'd smoke everyone because of my New England root.  Then I realized all of us were from northern states and just got old or sick of the weather.  Lots of Hockey talent in Florida. But as far as Tampa being a bandwagon city....yeah, because nobody is actually from Tampa Bay.  It's just a nice metro area away from the rest of the country. But when the Stanley Cup is actually rolling through our city  you better believe we're bandwagon. Show some respect for Lord Stanley."

I'm not from America but always liked Florida and chose to follow Tampa Bay Lightning knowing nothing about any of the ice hockey teams(except the major ones) and I always wanted to visit Tampa. It actually surprised me when I found out soon enough that the lightning was actually a pretty decent team. I'm still surprised that they've made it this far in the play offs.

When they went to the Super Bowl in 05, I was called a bandwgoner. When they went to Super Bowls back to back these last two years, I was called a bandwagoner. Never mind the fact that I probably have thousands of dollars in Seahawks gear and rock my authentic Steve Largent jersey every Sunday during the regular season...But no matter how good or how bad they are, they are MY team.  Having lived in this wonderful city for the last 3 years and following the Lightning since living here, I've become a Lightning fan. The fans are amazing. I cheer just as hard for the Bolts as I do for the Seahawks and the Mariners. People are dumb and just want to try and bring you down when you're riding the championship high. Forget them! Just keep cheering hard for your team and if people want to ride the bandwagon, let 'em! If they choose not to come back next year, who cares? There will always be people who want to share that high with you and why should it matter? Personally, I'd welcome anyone along for the ride."

TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Claustrophobopolis,23,Tue Jun 9 04:02:31 2015 UTC,"Good game, Tampa Bay. Onto the next."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Claustrophobopolis,13,Tue Jun 9 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yeh, was a GG."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,mollarirulz,-1,Tue Jun 9 03:03:07 2015 UTC,For you.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Claustrophobopolis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:12:14 2015 UTC,We stole it. You guys should have scored at least a couple of times with easy chances.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,mollarirulz,2,Tue Jun 9 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"It is not that the Lightning are good.  It is the Blackhawks were bad.  Kane andTowes just skated like it was Sunday at the park.  SURELY, the Lightning had NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Claustrophobopolis,0,Tue Jun 9 08:03:47 2015 UTC,"The facts are that if you won't put it away... we will, because we are the best team in the NHL this season. Sometimes we play heart-stopping hockey (not the good kind!) but we're producing when it is needed. I believe!"
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Yourbasement,0,Tue Jun 9 08:34:53 2015 UTC,"I was being sarcastic.  U was spewing what a Hawk fan (or any of our previous opponents) woyld say.  In fact, when the other team looks bad, it is because we r making them look bad."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Claustrophobopolis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:53:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I got your sarcasm, just didn't see your flair."

TampaBayLightning,392l1u,weath1860,3,Tue Jun 9 02:48:49 2015 UTC,I'm just yeah.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,BetterCallStral,5,Tue Jun 9 02:49:40 2015 UTC,How is the fact that Filppula is an ex-Red Wing relevant to this series?
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,BraZZKnuckleZ,3,Tue Jun 9 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"They love to give everyone a descriptive title and just role with it. The ex red wing, the Harvard man, the super tall 6'7 Bishop."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,iowastatefan,2,Tue Jun 9 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"O6? Those are the only teams still, right?"
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Knightro2011,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:28 2015 UTC,NBC factoid
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,blitzenkid,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:23 2015 UTC,Reasons....  I really don't know
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,dank773,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:16 2015 UTC,3 years removed.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,blitzenkid,7,Tue Jun 9 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"""good good oh god no no oh thank god"" - me on that turnover against which ended up getting blocked."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,maika3,5,Tue Jun 9 02:46:54 2015 UTC,I had the worst feeling it was going in and was so happy it was blocked
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,blitzenkid,4,Tue Jun 9 02:50:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, is this Tampa Bay or Turnover Bay?"
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,Buddy813,4,Tue Jun 9 02:46:05 2015 UTC,Despite the turnovers the team is still in the game...
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,tampaheat,2,Tue Jun 9 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"I couldn't figure it out for the longest time, but now I realize that Coops has an uncanny resemblance to a young William Petersen."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,BetterCallStral,9,Tue Jun 9 02:45:15 2015 UTC,The Chicago bias is strong with nbc. I'm pretty sure the last replay/highlight that we got was when we tied it at two and there was only one replay of it.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,iowastatefan,2,Tue Jun 9 02:44:16 2015 UTC,Um... The race was tied.  That should be icing.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,angelsil,2,Tue Jun 9 02:43:49 2015 UTC,Isn't it that the defensive guy clearly has to win the battle for it to be called icing? I could be wrong. That's what I always thought it was.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,PSU_Arcite,2,Tue Jun 9 02:45:06 2015 UTC,No. The only way it is NOT icing is if the Offensive player clearly is beating the defensive player at the hash marks.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,scratchjack,3,Tue Jun 9 02:46:34 2015 UTC,Shaw beat him barely. That was actually a good call
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,ajs2294,-1,Tue Jun 9 02:44:39 2015 UTC,"Correct me if my gut doesn't seem quite right, but I get the feeling that this is going to a shootout or the last 30 seconds.  It makes putting Vasy in questionable, especially with the Hawks playing us on our side so much."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,0,Tue Jun 9 02:43:49 2015 UTC,Tampa fans folks
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,ajs2294,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"It's my first season. Started watching in February or March, when they were starting to really talk about them on the local news, which was what made me pay attention because it was something other than Spring Training or NASCAR in those months.  I've been corrected on my statement, and I understand the misconception. I know that my lack of knowledge is greater than I realize, but that's part of why I'm talking in here. If I'm wrong, somebody will correct me.  I must congratulate you; it took you 6 minutes to catch my comment, which was obviously ill-informed, and throw it in my face and everyone else's as a generalization. That has to be a record for one as slow as you. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day."
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,BetterCallStral,4,Tue Jun 9 03:17:00 2015 UTC,It certainly isn't right if you think there's going to be a shootout.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,4,Tue Jun 9 02:45:34 2015 UTC,No shootouts in the Playoffs.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,BetterCallStral,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:44:30 2015 UTC,I am definitely corrected then.
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Tue Jun 9 02:47:45 2015 UTC,How are we not scoring?!
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,iowastatefan,2,Tue Jun 9 02:43:40 2015 UTC,Stamkos take the shot!
TampaBayLightning,392l1u,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,3,Tue Jun 9 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the extra whack, Vermette."

TampaBayLightning,390rdn,Claustrophobopolis,12,Mon Jun 8 19:50:42 2015 UTC,Starting goaltender - me  That's why they've been quiet about it. They're embarrassed.
TampaBayLightning,390rdn,millionaremattdavis,12,Mon Jun 8 12:24:19 2015 UTC,"Things we can do to improve on our Game 2 performance:   Faceoffs: We should win some. We got dominated in game 2, 28-15. Spatula was 3-6, Boyle went 3-10, Stamkos and Paquette were the only bright spots at 3-2 and 5-5, respectively. We never found out why Palat took all but one of the triplet's faceoffs.  Breakouts: Doesn't it seem like all of our turnovers came on breakouts? They didn't, at least not quite, but I don't think I breathed until we were safely across the neutral zone all night. Too many stubbed passes. Giveaways: Say no more, do no more. The Hawks are way too dangerous to hand them the puck at the point, or anywhere, really.   It's going to be really interesting to see who's in the lineup tonight. The morning skate is optional, of course, so we're not likely to lean too much from it. But will Drouin play again?   Drouin had, IMO, his best game of the playoffs. It wasn't amazing, but he didn't kill us, either. After his most egregious turnover, he didn't play a lot more, but he showed momentary flashes of offensive zone danger. I honestly think he had a couple chances to the puck towards the net that he should have taken, but kid's got to learn somehow.   If Vasy is in, I think we'll see 11/7 with Nesterov back in the lineup. Frankly, the way Sustr looked in Game 2, I kind of lean towards that anyway.  No matter what Coop decides, I have faith in this team. i think Vasy can win games, and I think we can win on the road in anyone's building.  GO BOLTS!!!"
TampaBayLightning,390rdn,fuckyouabunch,9,Mon Jun 8 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"I think Drouin did one thing very important - his early, dangerous chances set a tone. He came out flying and it set a pace for the rest of the team."
TampaBayLightning,390rdn,fuckyouabunch,8,Mon Jun 8 13:13:18 2015 UTC,"True, but we did that in period 1 of game 1 without him."
TampaBayLightning,390rdn,sarnald,5,Mon Jun 8 13:17:28 2015 UTC,I liked his defensive play too. I know he didn't play mich but I saw him hustle back to the defensive zone when he needed to and get in someone's way. He is learning and he will be good. Just give him time.
TampaBayLightning,390rdn,fuckyouabunch,3,Mon Jun 8 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think that since Chicago can be so dangerous on plays that seem innocuous that Drouin's defense remains suspect, though. it's not that he's bad or incompetent, it's that they are very good. Remember, there was some weird stuff happening in Game 2 that we won't see tonight, most likely. Not just goaltender swaps, either. There were back to back icings that resulted in us having a line of two centers and three defensemen. We need guys who can make quick, safe decisions out there, and I think that comes with experience. Frankly, I think that's Sustr's glaring flaw, as well."

He's on wing because when it's him and Fillpula out there Fillpula is a better center, better on faceoffs etc. He still gets added to the Number 2 line when they make up the first power play unit.

TampaBayLightning,39280d,randude,6,Mon Jun 8 18:47:28 2015 UTC,It will be Bishop or Vasi.  They called up Gudlevski a while back(along with a good chunk of the Crunch) when Syracuse got eliminated but he hasn't been seen much.
TampaBayLightning,39280d,formerlyme0341,9,Mon Jun 8 18:54:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've seen him ;-)"

TampaBayLightning,39280d,angelsil,5,Mon Jun 8 20:14:11 2015 UTC,Gudlevski is practicing already as one of the black aces. Pretty much half the Crunch are designated as so.   EDIT: Changed the link since it appears the original was to a for profit site

TampaBayLightning,391qmw,rhudgins32,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:55:47 2015 UTC,I was just there last week (for game 7) but I was unable to watch. Hopefuly a sports bar will have at least one Tampa expat trying to watch.
TampaBayLightning,391kut,laxman345,2,Mon Jun 8 16:10:42 2015 UTC,There is also a watch party @ Channelside...it is just hosted by the Lightning.
TampaBayLightning,391kut,SoonerinTampa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:43:14 2015 UTC,Which one do you think would be the better one to go to?
TampaBayLightning,391kut,SoonerinTampa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"That is a great question...it depends on what you like. I think Channelside has more selection for food and beverages, they have some giveaways, and it will be more 'intimate'. Hixon will be more crowded and I'm not sure what they have to offer for food (food trucks, but which ones)...I think the beer will be whatever Pepin offers...and of course you get Thunderbug and the Lightning Girls. Hell, you might even get on t.v. if ya go to Hixon."
TampaBayLightning,391kut,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"Hell, you might even get on t.v. if ya go to Hixon.    Pretty much why I'm going.  I'll drink average beer in exchange for being shown on NBC."

TampaBayLightning,38ylw1,Devils_-_Advocate,3,Mon Jun 8 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"There's speculation (nothing more) about dehydration, which he's suffered from before."
TampaBayLightning,38ylw1,fuckyouabunch,3,Mon Jun 8 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"If it's dehydration then he was correct to leave, I used to get dehydrated playing and it would affect my vision( seeing flashy spots in my peripheral)."
TampaBayLightning,38ylw1,Rhettoric76,8,Mon Jun 8 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"For the love of all things holy, someone just tell us he is okay so I can stop having heart palpitations."

TampaBayLightning,38ylw1,Adelrio,2,Mon Jun 8 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'm liking the dehydration story cause that can be remedied quickly and BISH plays tonight. And then, we take a nice steamy shit on Chicago's front door and take tonight's game, which I think we'll do regardless!! GO BOLTS!!  As much as it pains me to think this, I have a question...even if it was a minor sprain or something like that, do you think BISH would do all he can to try to convince Coop that he can play thru it, it being the SCF and all?"
TampaBayLightning,390wr0,the_yopro,4,Mon Jun 8 13:06:49 2015 UTC,"The usual deal is $2 Bud Light drafts for watch parties. However, they're not advertising that in the promotions. The lack of info and my fear that ONLY Bud Light will be available (BLECH) are keeping me from attending tonight."
TampaBayLightning,390wr0,angelsil,2,Mon Jun 8 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"If they bring the same BL trucks as they do for other events, I'm assuming Pepin is in charge of the event. If that is the case I have seen them have Goose Island, Shock Top and other InBev products."
TampaBayLightning,390wr0,SoonerinTampa,2,Mon Jun 8 14:56:58 2015 UTC,Does the Cutis Hixon deal mean that there is no more watching from Channelside?
TampaBayLightning,390wr0,danyay,2,Mon Jun 8 14:20:36 2015 UTC,"Channelside is still having a watch party, just not ""official.""

Since that day, Ive talked to that girl only a handful of times, as well as only missing a handful of Lightning games. I found my real soulmate that day and her name was Bolt."
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,ThatLineOfTriplets,6,Sun Jun 7 16:35:50 2015 UTC,Love it.
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,jjbmgm,4,Sun Jun 7 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Bolt... Yeah I know her, she is on the road a lot isn't she? Must get lonely."
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,Knightro2011,3,Mon Jun 8 02:42:23 2015 UTC,Thought you would say Thunderbug
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,2ndprize,16,Mon Jun 8 02:35:07 2015 UTC,It's awesome isn't it. The first cup created an actual generation of fans and we are seeing the benefits. I remember going to Lightning games with announced crowds of 12-13 thousand when about half that were there. We used to buy ticket from scalpels after the puck drop like 2 for $20 and then just move down to better seats.  I remember wishing the team would just play well enough to contend for a playoff spot etc. it is amazing how far we have come.  Also this has to be the most likeable fucking team ever.
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,8,Sun Jun 7 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"So true. Its funny being a Western Canadian and being a diehard Bolts fan. So many people I know love the Bolts because of their style of hockey, and hate the Hawks. I get congratulation texts every night the Bolts win. I love our team and I'm proud as hell of them."
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,Cats_and_hedgehogs,12,Sun Jun 7 18:46:26 2015 UTC,That was Esposito that almost got ejected for the hat. The founder of the team XD
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,2ndprize,6,Sun Jun 7 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain if you are joking or not. if you are not, it was not Esposito.  If you are, then partial Woosh on my part."
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,Cats_and_hedgehogs,4,Sun Jun 7 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it was Espo that told the story. He forgot to tell the ushers about the 3 goal hat rule."
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,2ndprize,4,Sun Jun 7 19:43:01 2015 UTC,I dont think anyone could have predicted Kontos scoring 4 goals.

TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,n_noto,7,Sun Jun 7 22:10:30 2015 UTC,Was at the game last night. It was electric and the best game I have ever been to. It was a real treat to experience that and to see Johnson make Lightning history.
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,ElMorono,4,Sun Jun 7 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"Seriously. When I started getting into hockey, the first NHL playoffs I ever watched was the year the Lightning won the Cup. I was so enthralled by the Bolts, and decided right there that that was the team I'd root for. I live in Canucks land, so I'd constantly be met with comments like ""Why would you go for a hockey team in Florida?!"" And so on.  But I kept at it, and kept rooting for them. And now I'm noticing people are finally coming around. People now see as us as a legitimate team, and a worthy contender.  We've beat 3 of the Original 6, and, if we keep it up, we'll beat a 4th, and take home our second Stanley Cup. And I couldn't be more proud of these guys, and know I chose the right team.   GOOOO BOLTS!"
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,Banthrau,3,Sun Jun 7 23:15:13 2015 UTC,"Wow. A Bolts fan who isn't in or from Florida? That's pretty sweet. I never considered people like you exist, but there're probably at least 4 or 5 of you."
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,Claustrophobopolis,5,Mon Jun 8 14:44:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, there's quite a few of us BoltBros around the world. My first game watching the Bolts was in '93 at the Thunderdome against the LA Kings (+ The Great One) and I've followed them ever since. I live in Europe, and my brother, also a Bolts fan, lives in Australia. Neither one of us is from the USA but Tampa/St.Pete has been a special part of our lives. We also used to play hockey... :)"
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,ElMorono,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"I was just getting into hockey and hadn't chosen a team yet. I didn't want to choose the Nucks just cause they were the home team, so I watched the whole playoffs, looked at other teams, and made my decision. And never once wavered."
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,domby,3,Tue Jun 9 00:15:32 2015 UTC,I was there at channel side and people were going crazy
TampaBayLightning,38x3rc,eatshit_dieslow,2,Sun Jun 7 17:18:42 2015 UTC,I camped out for almost every home game during the 2004 campaign. I was there the night the Flames 'spirit' car was parked out front of the Forum and we flipped it.  I hate that I live so far away from Tampa.
TampaBayLightning,38xywt,Buddy813,13,Sun Jun 7 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"But, we are a small market team... This was supposed to be a ratings nightmare... NBCSN told me so..."
TampaBayLightning,38xywt,millionaremattdavis,10,Sun Jun 7 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"and a 15.1 in Tampa, which is contributing more to the national number than many expected.    Oh go fuck yourself."
TampaBayLightning,38xywt,thetankster,3,Mon Jun 8 03:06:44 2015 UTC,I think that's because this is the first stanley cup in a while that puts a veteran team up against a well talent heavy young team. The bolts are amazing to watch let alone against the hawks
TampaBayLightning,38xywt,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Sun Jun 7 23:03:12 2015 UTC,Ft Myers is apparently TB territory and not Miami...? I'll roll with that.
TampaBayLightning,38xywt,DaPhoenix93,3,Sun Jun 7 23:45:51 2015 UTC,Miami tends to root for the Panthers. We are definitely Lightning territory in Fort Myers though!

TampaBayLightning,38ylnr,2ndprize,3,Sun Jun 7 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"Lol yes, the author isn't seriously telling the Lightning to admit it. It's basically just throwing it out there that he might have had to poop"

TampaBayLightning,38zdsg,laxman345,9,Mon Jun 8 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"It was Nesterov we sat to make room for Drouin. Namestnikov has been a healthy scratch for a while, probably so Coop could go 11/7 and play Nesterov."

TampaBayLightning,38z91d,Tenziru,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:28:20 2015 UTC,"Practices at the arena are closed.  Bryan burns said they'll practice in Brandon soon so I'm on the look out.  They don't really get onto the ice until 1045-11am in my experience.   To predict: look for days the arena is booked, where they should be in town,  and it's not a game day of course.  Lately they've had optional skates so don't be sad you might see all our lovely rookies.  I prefer them. More fun to watch."

TampaBayLightning,38y17h,derpdiva,4,Tue Jun 9 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"check out www.bethethunder.com to see all the benefits and pricing.  If you're not already working with someone, let me know."
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,Tampabear,3,Mon Jun 8 13:43:14 2015 UTC,Good discount on beer.
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,Devils_-_Advocate,3,Sun Jun 7 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"What is the discount? Every time I go to a game and see the $11 price tag, I scoff"
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,SirThomas813,3,Sun Jun 7 21:45:06 2015 UTC,where do you get $11 beers? i buy them for $15.
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,millionaremattdavis,3,Mon Jun 8 01:12:48 2015 UTC,I think the WOB beers are $11 because they aren't as big as the traditional Bud drafts.   Oh what the fuck do I know? I never wait in that ungodly line.
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Mon Jun 8 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"Goddamn really? I think the beer carts they have set up throughout the venue are $11, for the tallboys. Honestly I haven't checked in a while, I can't stomach paying that much for booze.  Not even sure why it's so much, I assume to keep people from getting belligerently drunk. $6-7 per beer would do that though, goddamn"
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,angelsil,0,Mon Jun 8 02:50:24 2015 UTC,I think 25% off food and beverage. But I thought it was all included at club level?
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,angelsil,5,Sun Jun 7 22:20:26 2015 UTC,Blue line club is not free food and drink. Only Chase Club and Lexus Lounge (IIRC). Blue line is not a club in the traditional sense.
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,angelsil,3,Mon Jun 8 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"The discounts on food, beverage and merch are well worth it, plus the STM events are really nice. The organization does a lot for their ticket holders. Our current seats are near the blue line club. Unfortunately, that section of the lower bowl (ours included) has a TON of resellers and people who don't attend most of the games. Expect to see a lot of visiting fans and a high turnover of seat mates. We're planning on moving seats before next season to a more Lightning-oriented area."
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,SNl9ER,0,Sun Jun 7 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"Did your section happen to come with the VIP parking garage pass? Normally I park in a metered spot, but I'm not even sure where the garage is located. It might be a pain in the ass to leave after a game."
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,Ninjaboots,3,Sun Jun 7 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Nope. We only rarely drive, so it wasn't an issue for us."
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,angelsil,2,Mon Jun 8 00:10:05 2015 UTC,"I've been one for 6 years and it's worth it to me to have consistent seating, pricing, and discounts. I will say however, while Vinik is the greatest owner in sports, the quality of service mostly from my last 3 reps has went down hill exponentially over the years despite cost continuing to rise quite a bit percentage wise year over year."
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,whatacharacter,2,Mon Jun 8 01:17:23 2015 UTC,Mine rarely returns my calls. I am going to ask for a new rep soon. I called three times last week and left a message and still have not heard back.
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,greatbigtaco,2,Mon Jun 8 01:59:11 2015 UTC,I still haven't met my rep and have gone around him to other reps for the few issues I needed service on this season. Dude is horrible.
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,whatacharacter,2,Mon Jun 8 11:42:14 2015 UTC,"This is pretty accurate.  I've found that I get best results when I email my rep, but haven't had to deal with too many time-sensitive issues.  One other item to note is don't expect to be grandfathered into a price.  This was once a policy, but ended around the time Vinik took over the team.  Over the last few years, my ticket price went up by: 20%, 50%, 50% (again), and 15%.  Obviously, I keep renewing because I love the game, but the tickets cost triple what they used to.  I expect this will continue for some time since our seats are still relatively cheap compared to most teams'."
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,greatbigtaco,3,Mon Jun 8 02:33:30 2015 UTC,Did you have those $7.50 seats? I did. They're now $21. Still cheap by all means but that $7.50 seat was crazy. Gave mine up in '12 when I moved
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,SNl9ER,2,Mon Jun 8 10:46:19 2015 UTC,"$25ish for mine now- Lightning attack twice.  Still worth it, though."
TampaBayLightning,38y17h,Beezure,2,Mon Jun 8 22:36:31 2015 UTC,I gave mine up because I moved to Chicago. Cheapest seat here is about $70. Was lucky enough to score a game 3 ticket at face value for $285.
TampaBayLightning,38uwou,Always_Sunnyvale,13,Sun Jun 7 01:06:57 2015 UTC,I wonder what it's like to actually watch your record get broken. Richards and fedotenko held that record previously. Good for tyjo
TampaBayLightning,38uwou,fuckyouabunch,4,Sun Jun 7 03:09:17 2015 UTC,"God, this kid is so fun to watch this postseason.  Great quality clip, too."
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,thetankster,9,Sun Jun 7 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"Based on the press conference last night, cooper was happy with him"
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,lacrorear,8,Sun Jun 7 16:00:02 2015 UTC,He played pretty well he made his line look like an offensive threat.
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,2ndprize,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:07:38 2015 UTC,I honestly can only remember him being on the ice 3 times. One of which he nearly gave Chi a breakaway.
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,ninjafaces,2,Mon Jun 8 12:53:38 2015 UTC,he was very strong to start the game he was out with Boyle and Morrow and had them swarming on the net.
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,2ndprize,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:58:37 2015 UTC,Yeah but after nearly giving Chi a breakaway in the 1st I can only remember seeing him on the ice once in the 3rd.   Maybe I was to drunk by then
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,ninjafaces,2,Mon Jun 8 13:11:15 2015 UTC,I was drunk enough I missed the first Vasilevski sub. I watched the replay yesterday. coop definitely had a conversation with him on the bench after that.  The big problem is that he needs to score the kid is a high risk high reward proposition except he hasn't nailed the reward part lately.
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,2ndprize,6,Mon Jun 8 13:22:47 2015 UTC,"I thought we did some really good things. He had at least one turnover that I can remember, but He was getting chances and I think his freshness really showed. He was skating through their defense pretty well. I hope to see him more this series"
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,AbusFez,7,Sun Jun 7 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to whether Coop chooses to run 7 defensemen or 6. If he decides that we would be better off without the rotating D-man this series, then it wouldn't surprise me to see more Drouin.   Basically (in my mind) if we're putting out 12 forwards it comes down to Namestnikov or Drouin. Namestnikov was hot coming into the playoffs, which is why he was getting the starts over Drouin (I imagine). So far Namestnikov has been pretty unimpressive in the playoffs, no big mistakes, but nothing to show for his time on ice either. In the past we might also look at people like Brown or Morrow as players who might have been scratched, but they've both stepped it up in the playoffs and would be a mistake to take out of the series (even though Morrow gets a lot of hate in this forum). Drouin is probably a more risky choice than Namestnikov because Drou seems to be more turnover prone, but he also has better playmaking skills.   TL;DR:  Depends on if we're putting out 7 D-men or not."
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,nolecomm,2,Sun Jun 7 16:07:17 2015 UTC,"I do seem to remember a pretty bad Namestnikov turnover in the Rangers series, though I don't think they scored off of it."
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,Ask_Me_If_Im_Stamkos,5,Sun Jun 7 21:13:41 2015 UTC,"Hopefully that play yesterday where he almost costed the team a goal was a wakeup call. You can't just dangle like a mad man around Toews of all people. I hope he learned from his mistake, Coop sounded pretty pleased with his performance, so I think we will see him next game for sure at least."
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,TampaFresh,3,Sun Jun 7 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"As long as he stops show boating and sets up the plays that I would love to see more Drouin. Kid is a playmaker, and a great one at that."
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,sirusx69,2,Sun Jun 7 20:12:55 2015 UTC,Yea but he reminds me of a T.O character. He's great when his antics connect and a liability when they don't.
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,Edge2k13,2,Sun Jun 7 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"I think he'll start game 3. He played well, had a jump in his step, and only the 1 bad turnover. He's gonna be on a short leash, but I got the feeling watching him last night that if he puts one into the net he's going to become a beast in the series."
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,Stamkos91,2,Sun Jun 7 20:25:53 2015 UTC,"I liked the bit when he iced the puck in a fancy way.  Seriously though everything Cooper said about his one way play was evident last night. His heart is definitely there, he just needs time. I wouldn't be surprised if a member odd the coaching staff went over all his shifts last night.. We'll see him sparingly for the scf but the real work will be going in behind the scenes."
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,emotoaster,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"He had one really bad turnover when trying to hold the puck himself which is why, I think, Coop has been so hesitant on putting him out there. He is a better shooter/playmaker than probably everyone else on the bottom 6 but he also does dangerous things at our own end. I think because this entire series is do or die now and he is fresh as hell we will see him on the ice for the rest of the series.  Actually wouldn't  be surprised to see Coop mix him into the top 6 for match ups if we really need a goal. Was he on the PP at all yesterday?"
TampaBayLightning,38wxd2,Tampabear,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"I agree he played well except for that bad turnover.  I was surprised Cooper put him back on the ice after that.  I don't think he plays again, though.  I don't know why, just don't think so."
TampaBayLightning,38xp78,SeeLowGreen,15,Sun Jun 7 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"And where is he now in the system, he's played a few NHL games hasn't he?   He played one NHL game last season, against Columbus. We won. He came in relief of Lindback during 2 playoff games, but it was too late to save our hopes. He did well in his limited amount of NHL minutes.   But...  He really struggled in Syracuse this season. Everyone expected him to shine in the starting roll in the AHL and he definitely had games where he was phenomenal, but his consistency just isn't there yet. The whole Crunch team was a bit of a train wreck at the end of the season (due to so many call ups), so it's hard to know how much was him and how much was the defensive shambles in front of him. Next season will be telling. He'll need to show he's progressed in his consistency and execution if he wants to play in the NHL."
TampaBayLightning,38xp78,angelsil,13,Sun Jun 7 19:24:20 2015 UTC,This is the only answer that matters. She is the one true voice in all things Gudlevskis.
TampaBayLightning,38xp78,JeanLouWheezy,11,Sun Jun 7 19:45:00 2015 UTC,Everyone needs a hobby :-P
TampaBayLightning,38xp78,angelsil,8,Sun Jun 7 19:49:34 2015 UTC,if Bishop is out Gudlevskis will sit as back up next game. He spent the season in Syracuse and took on the roll of started there after Vasy was called up for good. He's been practicing with the rest of the black aces since Syracuse were bounced out of the playoffs.  edit: Gudlevskis was already Lightning property during the Olympics.
TampaBayLightning,38xp78,Knox-Overstreet,4,Sun Jun 7 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"Guds is with the team, he practices with the team and all that since Syracuse got eliminated."
TampaBayLightning,38xp78,Tenziru,2,Sun Jun 7 19:09:09 2015 UTC,"He still needs some time to get back into form. Has been so-so in the AHL but like others said part of that was the ECHL-level squad they were playing with how many we called-up.  But now he's training with Tampa since Crunch's elimination and if there's no Bishop he'll be backup to Vasy. Vasy was always the one expected to make it to the show and shine as a franchise goalie. Gudlevskis isn't expected to reach very high but with proper development and his flashes he has potential to be a solid backup behind Vasy.  BTW, we had already drafted and signed him before the Olympics."

TampaBayLightning,38v68r,Lauxman,2,Sun Jun 7 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"We are a young team. I think the pressure at home is high to succeed. While this helps more experienced players ""get in the zone"" I think it makes younger guys more prone to make mistakes. On the road, the pressure is lightened and they can just make the right play and do their job. We are a great team when we stick to our structure and we seem to be much more calm and relaxed at home. Im guessing if this core makes another run, we will be much better and chill at home."

Damn was that some tense listening!  Really upset about Bishop, but I'm holding onto hope that his leaving the game was a precautionary move, though it might not be considering players typically play through minor injuries in the playoffs. I am very happy that Vasy was able to finish the win and that we split 1-1 at home rather than heading to Chicago down by 2, that makes things a lot easier.  GO BOLTS!"

I figured a small injury as much since he was playing every game and playing well at that. I didn't watch a lot of the new york series after the habs got knocked out but he played quite well so I thought maybe his injury was getting better or going away slowly. This is pretty unfortunate but I guess you'll know on Monday if it's serious or not if they play him. Best of the luck boys."

Checki  3rd line put in a goal? Check  Drouin actually looked pretty solid tonight! Check Plus! I was concerned because imo the other games he played he looked a little lost on the ice, but tonight overall he was pretty solid. Only one real bad play to a turnover and they didn't score on it so it was alright.  and finally VASI GOT A FUCKING WIN!!!! Check!!  Only fucking thing missing was JT Brown being like 2 inches to the left on that deflection!!! GAWD DAMN IT BROWN! SCORE!  Awesome game though! Lots of Booze was enjoyed and not drank in shame! Keep this shit up and we have a real chance at this boys. Didn't slow up when we had a lead, played solid forecheck and backcheck all game, no shitty defense nonsense (other than penalty kill but thats ok)  Only negative for me was WTF sustr? Icing again and a delay of game? Get in the game man. Put fucking nesterov in over this clown. He keeps putting us in shitty positions. He had two icings last game which helped the Hawks have their comeback.   Anyway GO BOLTS! BOLTS IN 5, or 6 or 7! I DONT REALLY CARE JUST THAT WE WIN IT ALL!"

Like the Detroit series, the rest of these games will be determined by who can outcoach the other bench boss. If Coop knocked out Babs, Therrien and AV, I have faith he can rise to the challenge against Coach Q. This his team's moment, and he must rise to the occasion.   To anyone attending the game tonight, keep those who cant in your hearts when you're cheering our team on. I wanted to fly across the country to see our boys play for the cup if they made it to the finals, but too many obligations have gotten in the way to make it happen. I wish I could be there. Enjoy your time tonight, be safe and make some NOOOiiissee!!!  GO BOLTS!  Edit: I am getting downvoted in our own sub's pre-game thread. Pretty sad, Hawks fans."

TampaBayLightning,38txnw,wiseaus_stunt_double,15,Sat Jun 6 21:47:25 2015 UTC,"Two reasons:    Most people (mostly northerners) believe that as a southern team, much less a team in Tampa, FL, don't deserve a hockey team to begin with. The fact that we got as far as we did pisses them off, in itself.  Tyler Johnson and the rest of the triplets. Most fans and teams that have faced us so far are not happy that we have such ace-in-the-hole players. Players that we scooped up and got to keep as our stars. This goes in par with the whole ""we don't deserve a team"" thing, much less a high-scoring team."
TampaBayLightning,38txnw,NuclearSky,17,Sat Jun 6 21:30:51 2015 UTC,Arena rules that people/media cannot be bothered to read and parrot misinformation as fact.

TampaBayLightning,38txnw,millionaremattdavis,-17,Sat Jun 6 22:27:20 2015 UTC,"The rules are ridiculous, to be fair."
TampaBayLightning,38txnw,QuestFor4,9,Sat Jun 6 22:27:51 2015 UTC,Not really. Restricting 7% of the arena (that only 1%ers [if that terms your thing. Either way you know who I'm talking about] could afford.) and selling only to Florida is trying to help grow the fan base. The Lightning don't have to cater to crybaby Chicago fans because the likelihood of them becoming repeat customers wasn't great to begin with unless the Hawks come to town.
TampaBayLightning,38txnw,millionaremattdavis,-23,Sat Jun 6 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"Again, it's absurd and childish. Especially when you have Bolts fans calling security on Hawks fans for being Hawks fans. Grow up."
TampaBayLightning,38txnw,QuestFor4,7,Sat Jun 6 22:40:48 2015 UTC,Oh shut the fuck up already. We don't care.

TampaBayLightning,38q6lq,AbusFez,4,Fri Jun 5 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"I estimate that how game 2 goes, the series goes.   A loss might break us, but,  A win = a split series going into Chicago.

TampaBayLightning,38s4tb,dgsportsfanatic,2,Sat Jun 6 11:57:00 2015 UTC,"I think two things happen. The first Is that the team holds back some tickets, and the second is that some tickets get taken by people who put them in their cart but either don't end up paying or there is an issue with payment and it takes some time for those to get back on the market."
TampaBayLightning,38s4tb,2ndprize,2,Sat Jun 6 12:24:51 2015 UTC,"Also, people who exceed the ticket limit get their shit canceled.  Why a multibillion dollar company can't find a way to prevent the sales exceeding the ticket limit from going through on the front end is beyond me."
TampaBayLightning,38s4tb,the_dude_imbibes,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:46:14 2015 UTC,The home team will hold a certain amount of tickets for both teams. Once requests have been filled they'll release the remaining tickets online without alerting people. I was trying to figure out when they get released and apparently it's early morning on game day.
TampaBayLightning,38s4tb,greatbigtaco,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"Just checked again and there were 2 available in section 210. They are gone now, but if anyone is still looking for a ticket I would keep an eye on ticketmaster and you might get lucky."

TampaBayLightning,38owxi,jmerc83,3,Fri Jun 5 18:16:47 2015 UTC,Aren't the first two games usually broadcast on cable anyway? I remember back in 04 the first two games were on ESPN. (Granted ESPN is a tad more prestigious than nbcsn)
TampaBayLightning,38owxi,millionaremattdavis,2,Fri Jun 5 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, Game 1 and 2 were on NBC, 3 and 4 NBCSN, but 5-7 are scheduled for NBC too.  I guess they figure 3/4 will be the least watched of the series."
TampaBayLightning,38owxi,jmerc83,2,Fri Jun 5 19:44:26 2015 UTC,For ratings.  Those two games alone will have an appreciable effect on the network's annual average ratings. This increases the market value for all advertising time on the network because people are dumb.

They truly don't need him at 6 mil per and they have leadership coming from guys within the system growing into those roles not from hiring them out to guys like Iginla.
TampaBayLightning,38ojrn,Ian_is_funny,2,Fri Jun 5 15:43:16 2015 UTC,How did it work for game 1? I know it said No camping out was allowed and the Line started at 7am. Obviously the 100 instantly filled up and it was a mad dash. What time did you get there to start waiting? Once you got the wrist band how did it work? Some of my friends are going to try and get one for saturday's game and sell it to me since I cant be there in the morning. If they fill out the electronic form with my name would that work?
TampaBayLightning,38ojrn,Zeake,4,Fri Jun 5 17:06:38 2015 UTC,"I got there at about 3:30 am and chilled with a group of about 10 or so people. Security would not let us even get close to the arena at first, but eventually we had a line forming next to the parking garage. There was also a line forming across channelside drive. At 7am both lines mad a mad dash to the actual line up area, where it took about an hour and a half to get my wristband. Once I got the wristband I had to fill out a form and go to the box office, where you purchase the ticket. You don't acutally get the ticket until 7:30pm when you can pick it up from the box office though. Be warned, it was a tiring process, but hell, I saw a cup finals game."

TampaBayLightning,38ojrn,domby,2,Sat Jun 6 00:28:54 2015 UTC,Hellll no
TampaBayLightning,38ojrn,cgerdes,2,Fri Jun 5 19:44:53 2015 UTC,I was there too. It was the most ridiculous system. I got a text update saying you are allowed to form a line before 7 am but still no camping. I don't know how they plan to enforce the line before 7 am. Will probably end up the same thing as last time. Right at 7 people will run by you and you sprint to get as close to the table as possible.   Side note: PATRICK!!!!!
TampaBayLightning,38ojrn,emotoaster,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:31:04 2015 UTC,Was it really that crazy for game 1?
TampaBayLightning,38ojrn,BrazilianRider,3,Fri Jun 5 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"It was. The thing is, it could have all been avoided if they simply let people line up as they arrived, instead of having everyone wait outside the property and then unleash a mob of broke college students desperate for tickets. I got there before almost everyone, at 3:30am, and got the 92nd wristband."
TampaBayLightning,38ojrn,SNl9ER,2,Fri Jun 5 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on doing this with a friend for Game 5... care to share any tips?  I.e. where did you guys line up?

TampaBayLightning,38pe2e,fuckyouabunch,2,Fri Jun 5 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the fees are crazy. The deal with stubhub is the price you see is the price you pay. I've bought from vividseats, but it was years ago, and there were a ton of addon fees."
TampaBayLightning,38pe2e,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen a few tickets there where the price is what's listed, let's say 365.00 for example, and you click on it, and it shows that the ticket is 300, then a 65 dollar fee. Is this what you mean? Or are there extra fees on top of that?   I've also seen some tickets there where the ""fees"" are like 2.00. It's such a weird system.  Thanks for the reply! We watched tickets on there drop as low as 175.00 on Wednesday when the game started, so my SO and I were thinking about trying the same thing on Saturday."
TampaBayLightning,38pe2e,the_dude_imbibes,2,Fri Jun 5 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"I think the last time I used it was 2011, maybe, so whatever I knew is almost certainly different."
TampaBayLightning,38pe2e,derpdiva,2,Fri Jun 5 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, bought several times throughout the year. Service charge is hefty, that's why they're lower than StubHub. Stubhub shows you the out-the-door price, vivid hits you hard when you go to check out."
TampaBayLightning,38pe2e,n_noto,2,Sat Jun 6 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again... do what you want to avoid fees but we had 75 counterfit tickets from game 1.  every one of those tickets was bought through sites (mostly stub hub and craigslist) other than www.ticketsnow.com.  ticketsnow is the only NHL affiliated and trusted website to purchase tickets through.  Don't get me wrong, you can find legitimate tickets through other secondary market places, but with prices in the $500-700 range, why risk it?!"

My response was that I actually really like both teams. Which I do. I loved the Hawks since the early 90's and became a Lightning fan when I moved here. In fact, the very first weekend I was here, I had tickets and fell in love. Every year, I love them more. The guy said I was wearing the wrong colors and all I could say was Nope, got to have a favorite out of the two. This series is going to be amazing. I'm glad I got to be a part of it there, though I'll never hear the end of how much my husband spent lol. I thought the environment was amazing, even in the 3rd when they took a bit of a nosedive. But I was expecting a loss last night. They needed a game to get comfy. Once they are, look out."
TampaBayLightning,38leby,James_Gondola,3,Fri Jun 5 01:21:20 2015 UTC,"I saw a lot of sore losers and people wanting to pick fights and screaming matches with blackhawks fans after the game. Tons of shitty remarks from a lot of people, and not much of it in good spirits.  I'm a lightning fan and my girlfriend is a blackhawks fan and the comments from some of the lightning fans were insane. I mean being upset that people are cheering for their team scoring or winning is ridiculous, and getting in the face of a woman to intimidate her, other people trying to fight, a guy complaining about a woman in blackhawks garb being in his personal space when its a crowded arena in the most crowded section. I mean, we didn't get much hate or anything besides some shitty comments, but I Tampa was never supposed to be one of those places.

TampaBayLightning,38o9du,Edge2k13,14,Fri Jun 5 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"Toronto media doing their thing != a trade rumor?  I'm sick of this assumption that your draft status earns you a spot in the line up. The kid is a goddamn defensive liability. He has gotten better, but the NHL is NOT a development league. And we're playing for the biggest prize. Until a situation calls for a high risk/high reward (which is what Drouin is), we won't see him.   If we lose game 2? I think he slots in.  Should there be a rift, this would be a good time for the Captain to sit down with Drouin and preach patience. Drouin is not above the team. Christ, people forget Kuch was a scratch in the playoffs last year."
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,csampson,4,Fri Jun 5 15:41:40 2015 UTC,Hit the nail on the head. Totally agree.
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,2ndprize,9,Fri Jun 5 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"They asked Coop about Drouin yesterday.  His response didn't seem to indicate any rift.  He basically said Drouin has an amazing skill set but they dont have any space in the top 6 for him and he doesn't fit well in the bottom 5 they have been using because of their assignments.  He didn't rule out seeing the kid play, but it sounds like we would need to be short a triplet for it to happen.  I don't see them trading Drouin.  His entry level contract is just too good for the team to move him and his value is probably been artificially lowered by the playoffs."
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,kylieigh,3,Fri Jun 5 14:42:26 2015 UTC,Drouin actually works well with Boyle. There's room for Drouin on that team if Copper really wanted him on that team.
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,fuckyouabunch,4,Fri Jun 5 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"Sure, but not in the playoffs. The kid needs a year in the AHL, and since he can't have it, he's going to have to come along more slowly."
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,WhenRomansSpokeGreek,2,Fri Jun 5 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"I am worried that not inserting Drouin in will have a serious impact as we approach the middle of the series. Tampa's third and fourth lines have produced very little extra offense, whereas Chicago's has been good for 18 goals. Even putting him in for a game to see if he can spark some of our third line talent won't be a bad idea if we fall behind 2-0."

TampaBayLightning,38o9du,fuckyouabunch,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:12:35 2015 UTC,I'm not a Lightning fan but why is Morrow playing over him. Morrow is visibly a step behind and doesn't provide much. Chicago is a fast team. Chicago plays Teuvo Teräväinen instead of veterans like Versteeg and I think Vermette at one point.
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,formerlyme0341,6,Fri Jun 5 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"You can't compare the two. Morrow brings physicality and a big body that can screen goaltenders. And while he's a liability in terms of penalties, he's out there getting solid minutes in the offensive zone. His play has improved dramatically since getting scratched in the first round. Drouin can't bring any of that. He's got hands, but nothing else yet. He didn't look good at all in any of the games he played and he legitimately was a defensive liability.   The only player you could look at swapping is Namestnikov. He's been invisible, so it might not make a huge difference anyway. Although they had him swapping centering the triplets with Johnson in the practice this morning, so maybe Coop is trying to find a way to get some more offense going for them or for him."
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,tcigzies,4,Fri Jun 5 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"Two way play, experience, leadership.    Drouin is a bit of a liability defensively.  Deep in the playoffs, I agree with having the slower but experienced old timer on the ice over a speedy rookie apt to turn over the puck.  Drouin will be a beast in time."
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,Squorn,-3,Fri Jun 5 16:09:44 2015 UTC,called it.
TampaBayLightning,38o9du,Blake1288,0,Fri Jun 5 14:48:09 2015 UTC,"I really hope he gets his head straight this offseason and comes back a new player.  If he doesn't though, I think we need to move him early next season, while he still has value on the trade market."
TampaBayLightning,38luer,derpdiva,8,Fri Jun 5 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"2004 they lost game 1 to Calgary 1-4 and won game 2, 4-1.  This Hawks team is the best team that the Bolts have faced all season and playoffs though. Going back to Chicago down 0-2 will be exceedingly difficult to overcome. Hawks are damn near legendary imo."
TampaBayLightning,38luer,ZeykShade,-11,Fri Jun 5 08:36:06 2015 UTC,"best team that the Bolts have faced all season and playoffs   That's debatable.. I feel they are the softest team considering the road TB had to take to get to the finals. No doubt they're a great opponent, but the best?"
TampaBayLightning,38luer,JMC813,7,Fri Jun 5 11:03:30 2015 UTC,"Curious, why do you think we are the softest?"

I'd say we are probably both playing the toughest competition we've faced.  I'd give you guys the edge over Nashville and Minnesota, I'd say it's pretty close Tampa vs. Anaheim but winning game 7 on the road at MSG, I'd say I'd have to give you the edge over Anaheim."
TampaBayLightning,38luer,Chi_jL,-1,Fri Jun 5 18:11:07 2015 UTC,I answered.. Just because you don't agree doesn't make it talking out of my ass. Deal with it.
TampaBayLightning,38luer,JMC813,0,Fri Jun 5 22:36:25 2015 UTC,Completely out of your ass.
TampaBayLightning,38luer,MrSantaClause,0,Sun Jun 7 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"I feel Detroit and Montreal play a more physical game and were the only two teams where I felt the Bolts were really the underdog. They were both, in my OPINION, stronger overall teams than the Hawks. Just an opinion, put your pitchforks away. I think the matchup with the Hawks is fairly even, and we will probably not see many lopsided games like the rest of the playoffs had here and there, but I just don't think they are a tougher team then those two."
TampaBayLightning,38luer,JMC813,2,Fri Jun 5 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"So you're talking in terms of physicality and not how good of a team? By all means you are correct in that stand point, the Hawks play a speed game not a physical games."

This was nothing like being a Green Bay Fan at a Bucs game where you get jumped at the urinal.  They earned a night to celebrate but don't give them the fucking key to the city.  This chaps my ass more than the shitty ref calls last night."
TampaBayLightning,38ijl3,angelsil,7,Thu Jun 4 13:42:24 2015 UTC,"We had one obnoxious Hawks fan in our area. He was, like, 15 and kept standing up and shoving his Blackhawks hat in the faces of the Bolts fans sitting near him. Seriously ill-mannered entitled little shit and his parents just sat there and let him be a jerk. I guess they figured since they paid over $1,000 a seat, they could act however. His age was the only thing that kept people from retaliating and he knew it. I did get off a ""I guess since you can't get laid, this is how you have fun?"" at him.  Rest of the Hawks fans were nice folks. Just that one spoiled fugly brat."

TampaBayLightning,38ikwq,angelsil,6,Thu Jun 4 13:38:17 2015 UTC,Great job with this! This sub is great but it would be even better if we had more quality posts like this one.   Based off the charts there was a span of almost 10 minutes in the third period where Hedman and Stralman weren't on the ice. During that time Sustr and Carle took the majority of the ice time. I know there was an icing so we couldn't get guys off the ice but even after there was a line change we went from Carle/Sustr to Garrison/Coburn and then back to Carle/Sustr. What was happening during that ~10 minute time span?
TampaBayLightning,38ikwq,TIFUByJoiningReddit,2,Thu Jun 4 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, buddy, I really enjoy your posts too. In the end we're all here for the same reason, because we love our Bolts, so I think it's good that we have posts that appeal to those, like us, who geek out on this stuff, and also posts that a day one fan can enjoy. I love how inclusive our community is.   Sustr caused that icing, so they were stuck then for awhile, and then we were stuck in our zone for a long shift. Once we finally got the puck out we were only able to get a partial change due to not forechecking through the neutral zone. But it was better than another icing. We had to take our timeout due to the icing sustr caused."
TampaBayLightning,38ikwq,0xfefefefe,2,Thu Jun 4 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"This was actually a really, really cool post.  Do you mind explaining a bit of how you did it?  I'd love to start making quality posts like this, not just for the hawks, but for any game."

Ferg's Live is directly across from the arena, but kinda meh. Channelside has Hablo Taco, Hooters and Splitsville.   If you really want a selection of bars, head to Ybor City and take the trolley to/from the game. Alternately, it's about a $5 cab ride. Ybor is the entertainment district and has roughly a zillion bars and clubs that range from complete dives to bottle service to goth clubs. It's incredibly easy to bar hop in Ybor, not that I would know whistles innocently.   As someone else mentioned, SoHo can be bar hopped as well. It's a little more BRO than I like, but that's certainly an option if that's your thing. You'd definitely need to cab and it's around $15, I'd estimate."

Then in the 3rd they didnt even get a shot on goal for the first 13 minutes and started turning it over and not clearing the net resulting in goals scored against and then scrambled in the last minutes to try and win it. They cant sit on a 1 goal lead and go from trying to win to trying not to lose, that's not how champions win."

Hard to be mad at these guys for the effort they've put in this post season, but my God did they blow that game. How many times have we seen this happen (in the NHL in general)? You can't sit back, and get away from your game. I said this during the game, ""No way this game ends 1-0,"" and what do you know? They finally break in, it was bound to open. Not much really else to say other than there is no more room for error. Going back to Chicago 0-2 would just about end the series."

TampaBayLightning,38gy51,stamkos4life,4,Thu Jun 4 05:44:21 2015 UTC,Fuuuuck. The hawks girlfriend is going to be insufferable. I'll be surprised if we make it.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,qpcr,13,Thu Jun 4 06:03:26 2015 UTC,"What pissed me off most is that we played great the first 15 minutes or so. Aggressive, mean, fast... Then we tried to run out the clock the rest of the game.  If we can realize we won't win a game playing not to lose for 40 minutes, let alone a series, we still have a good chance. Otherwise, it may not be a pleasant series.  Also, why do we seem to play so much better on the road than at home?"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Lansdallius,8,Thu Jun 4 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"Well... the Gators won the Softball national championship, which is nice."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,lazybrouf,6,Thu Jun 4 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"The Red Wings AND Rangers took Game 1 against us. No reason to get ahead of ourselves. Game 2 is gonna be pretty crucial, but I like the Bolts on the road recently. I don't hate our chances going to Chicago with the series 1-1."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,TheMMApodcast,9,Thu Jun 4 08:11:52 2015 UTC,Fuck the last 45 minutes of that game. Shark-level choking.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,angelsil,9,Thu Jun 4 03:35:36 2015 UTC,Everyone's saying it so I'll say it too. I like Cooper. He's done a great job and he's developed tremendously throughout these playoffs and learned to make adjustments that completely change a game. With that being said Cooper made a big mistake tonight. If we had held on the extra 6 minutes and won 1-0 it would have been a different story but I don't think many of us had faith that we could hold off the best team in the west for nearly 40 minutes by playing solid defense.  We're not the New Jersey Devils from the early 2000's and we can't play their style of play for 20+ minutes per game. We're the highest scoring team in the league. We have the best top 6 in the league. We win our games with speed and a hard forecheck. We should not stray from what got us here.  Cooper's a great coach and I don't expect that to happen again.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,TIFUByJoiningReddit,4,Thu Jun 4 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"I think the presidential quote you're looking for is:  ""The best defense is a good offence"" - Yoda."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,The_estimator_is_in,4,Thu Jun 4 04:57:33 2015 UTC,"The best defense, a good offense is.   I say this as a Blackhawks fan. Let's go boys.. Being it on game 2!"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,HollowImage,3,Thu Jun 4 09:35:38 2015 UTC,The hawks pretty much stifled your top 6 though. Crawford picked up the slack where our defense couldn't. And I'd say tied for the best top 6. :)
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,chocolate_chip_kelly,-1,Thu Jun 4 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"We could say the same to you. Didn't see Kane or Toews all night. They shut down the Johnson line but Stamkos and Killorn had a ton of chances.  On a side note, you're coming into our sub and commenting a lot about how good the Hawks are after a 1 goal game 1. That's a quick way to get downvoted to hell."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,TIFUByJoiningReddit,6,Thu Jun 4 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"Both teams are good because it's the cup finals? I'm fully aware that the lightning are lightning charged.  I'm just saying that the best of 6 is debatable.    It's a defensive show down.  Both teams are expecting a lot of goals,  but the defenses are really overshadowed by how good the forwards have been playing. And I really don't care about downvotes,  I expect it being here.  But I wouldn't down vote a lightning fan coming into hawks for saying stuff in our sub."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,chocolate_chip_kelly,4,Thu Jun 4 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're the best teams in our respective conferences this year but I still think Chicago is the better team/best team in the NHL. You guys have more experience and have done this in the past. This is a huge learning year for us and you guys taught us a valuable lesson last night. Obviously, all great teams/dynasties start from scratch.  That ""2nd"" line for Chicago played great and overshadowed our ""2nd"" line, unfortunately. But I think the young guys on our team had some nerves about playing a juggernaut and we came out of this knowing that we can at least keep up...as long as we keep forechecking and playing offensively."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,csampson,2,Thu Jun 4 16:36:01 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this was the first win for us that didn't have a point from Toews or Kane. Great job by the Lightning to make them look absent.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,letsgetrockin741,7,Thu Jun 4 21:07:40 2015 UTC,Why do the Lightning tuck away their balls when they have a lead?
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,NosyargKcid,5,Thu Jun 4 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"It always mystifies me. Because after it happens, and after they lose doing it, they have the exact same postgame interviews where they acknowledge they played like poop and didn't have enough drive and actively lost the game for themselves by getting complacent."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,InFlamesWeTrust,6,Thu Jun 4 03:31:34 2015 UTC,you can't play prevent defense for a period and a half against the blackhawks with a one goal lead and expect to win. that was a frustrating game to watch.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,statix138,11,Thu Jun 4 04:25:05 2015 UTC,The Hawks only need 17 seconds to ruin your summer.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,JMC813,7,Thu Jun 4 14:05:05 2015 UTC,The players acknowledge they fucked up trying to play the trap for over twenty minutes and just coasted the last period so now they just need to learn from the mistake and move on.  I am not worried at all.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,PSU_Arcite,2,Thu Jun 4 12:56:37 2015 UTC,"It really shows how valuable championship experience is. The Bolts are young and very inexperienced to the seasoned vets on the Hawks.. They thought they had the game in the bag, meanwhile Chicago knew it wasn't over till that clock shows 0:00 in the 3rd. Now they know not to let up, regardless how in the bag they feel it is.. I'm with you tho, no worries yet. Disappointed, but I'm confident in the team to turn it around. GO BOLTS!"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Drewzi,7,Thu Jun 4 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"NBC does not respect the don't say ""shut out"" rule... they said it three times and then Chicago scored..."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Khue,3,Thu Jun 4 03:34:29 2015 UTC,Chicagoan here. I noticed that too. Every year I hope we get the local announcers for each arena and every year the taking NBC heads piss me off.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,brentsopel5,3,Thu Jun 4 20:48:32 2015 UTC,Underestimated the opponents. Plain and simple. Welcome to the SCF. Come stronger.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,fuckyouabunch,3,Thu Jun 4 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"That can't possibly be the case, can it? Misunderestimate the Blackhawks? That's on the coaches and leadership then.   The bolts need to keep with the speed if they want a chance in this series; the Hawks haven't faced a team nearly this fast in the playoffs. It was apparent they were caught off guard in the first in regards to this.  Sitting back and playing prevent for an extended amount of time was the difference; Hawks find a way. They are too experienced for that game plan to work."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,TIFUByJoiningReddit,5,Thu Jun 4 07:17:55 2015 UTC,"Moved this from another thread:   Look, we lost, and that sucks. But it's a fucking series. We keep going. We lost, but we list by one after playing like garbage for more than two thirds of the game. If we clean up another 20 minutes of play, we win hockey games.   They got off their game. Also, something is wrong with Johnson. He didn't look right most of the game even before the Seabrook hit.  We'll get better. And we'll score more. Look out for Stamkos and palat. And did anybody notice that outside of his tiny little mistake that cost us the game, jt brown is starting to get his hands? He had a good shot!   We're coming back, and we're gonna win this. That's Lightning hockey."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,fuckyouabunch,3,Thu Jun 4 03:32:51 2015 UTC,At first I thought that Seabrook collision was accidental but after watching the slo-mo replay you clearly saw Seabrook change his path and put the shoulder to Johnson's face. Not cool.  Obviously missed calls go both ways but that non-call high stick on Kucherov that led to a 4 on 2 the other way (and eventually Chicago's goal less than a minute later) was ridiculous. The ref was right in front of the play and the stick hit him hard enough to make him bleed out of his mouth and both of his nostrils. If that penalty is called we get a 4 minute powerplay with just under 7 minutes to go.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,thisguy130,4,Thu Jun 4 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"I re-watched it, and the Kucherov stick to the mouth was from follow through on a clearing attempt by Crawford. It was a correct no call. Unfortunate play"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,fuckyouabunch,3,Thu Jun 4 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this.  NBC never showed a replay, and it bothered me because Kucherov obviously took a serious impact to the face with no call, and I couldn't figure out why.  Honestly, I'm glad it was a reasonable no call, as it'd kill me to have that goal come right Kucherov gets injured with no call."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,n_noto,2,Thu Jun 4 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Gotta let the kucherov one go considering versteeg. But yeah, the Seabrook hit was dirty. Still, Johnson never seemed right. He was slow most of the night, lost pucks, didn't see them other times, missed passes, didn't receive well. He was just not at all himself. He looked good for about the first three shifts, maybe."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,PSU_Arcite,2,Thu Jun 4 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"PROS:  -Strong first period & second period  -Nifty goal by Killer and tons of chances by the team but just couldn't capitalize.   -We have lost 2/3 first games in these playoff's to the RW & Rangers, I have faith we can come back and take this!  CONS:  -Can't win playing on back for the entire 3rd period.  -I win @ turnovers / giveaways for our GWG I guess.  -I wish we could take our regular season home record and copy & paste to the playoffs because it was great. I guess we are better at home but that does not make any sense. Let's go LIGHTNING the cup is our, NOW GO OUT THERE AND TAKE IT!!!!   -Not really sure if those goals were Bishop's fault or not but he has to be clutch in those situations. The defense has to do better in keeping it out of the zone, we kept them on the boards for 3/4 of the game and look what happens when we let that shit up.   Need to score on prime scoring opportunities such as Callahan's breakaway. NEED TO SCORE IT IS THE SCF!   LET'S GO LIGHTNING!"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,TIFUByJoiningReddit,9,Thu Jun 4 03:37:14 2015 UTC,"Bishop was hawt tonight, you can't blame him for either of those goals"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,chocolate_chip_kelly,7,Thu Jun 4 03:40:22 2015 UTC,Definitely can't blame Bishop. First goal he was screened by two guys. Second goal was a turnover by Brown and then it deflected off Brown's stick and over the shoulder.  IMO this was one of Bishop's best games of the playoffs. We could have easily shut Chicago out if we continued to play our game. Bishop reminded me of Price this game; he never had to make a flashy save because he was always in the right position and never gave up a dangerous rebound.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,csampson,2,Thu Jun 4 04:04:44 2015 UTC,We could have easily shut out the Bolts too. Just saying.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,chocolate_chip_kelly,2,Thu Jun 4 15:15:29 2015 UTC,IMO Crawford played one of the best games I've seen from the guy. He answered at all our big chances and you can't fault him for Killer's goal.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,TIFUByJoiningReddit,2,Thu Jun 4 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"Crow is great. Might as well be trying to shoot pucks through a brick wall sometimes.  Nashville always has his number,  thank God for darling,  but crow has been unreal except for his off games."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,chocolate_chip_kelly,2,Thu Jun 4 17:19:39 2015 UTC,Not saying it isn't impossible but it's a lot more difficult to argue your point. Tampa was 6 minutes away from shutting out Chicago. After Tampa scored their first goal they played a very defensive game and didn't even send a forechecker past the blue line in the third period. If we were tied or behind in the game we would have played a more aggressive game which would have given us a better chance to score. Both goalies played well this game but after Crawford survived the first period he really didn't have to do anything in the second and third.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,ChillyToTheBroMax,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:33:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It was kind of confusing why Cooper let his team take the foot off the gas. Hawks were scrambling for anything in the first period, but the Bolts let them get comfortable and that's where shit starts to go wrong for the opposition.   I hope the games continue to be exciting. This has been one of the best SC playoffs I have watched.  PS If the hawks weren't in the finals I'd be cheering for the Bolts for sure."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Bar_Deezy_Snizzz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:05:56 2015 UTC,"What I DID like to see was Ben storming off before anyone else the second the clock ran out.  When Bish gets mad, bitches get shut out.  Also, Callahan.  Good GOD that man punished the Hawks."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,OGHamToast,2,Thu Jun 4 13:05:54 2015 UTC,"Turnovers are not what we need. Never take your foot off the gas against a team like this. Never go full Mike McCarthy. Hit him with your purse to clear out the front of the net next time, Filp. This should be a good series if Coop can wrangle in the sloppiness. We can still do this."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,retro_falcon,2,Thu Jun 4 03:42:07 2015 UTC,"I completely missed the game as I have family visiting, but I can say with 100% confidence that I was disappointed by this loss. Here's to hoping for a strong showing in game 2!"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,StonewallFantana,2,Thu Jun 4 03:55:43 2015 UTC,I thought we did a fairly good job of keeping the front of the net clear for most of the game. Just seems like the last 10 minutes we forgot to to do that and it cost us. Same thing that happened against the Rags. Win the front of the net and win the game. Need to make that happen in game 2.   I was only able to watch the 2nd and 3rd periods and I thought we looked like crap for both of them. It was all defense and no offense any attack we had was a one shot and done or turn it over passing. Didn't seem like we were able to solidly find the puck tonight and had a lot of passes bounce off the stick or just go out of range. When that's happening shoot the damn thing and don't worry about the extra pass.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,csampson,4,Thu Jun 4 04:03:13 2015 UTC,"Just FYI y'all absolutely murdered us the first half of the first period, and continued to outplay us the last 10 minutes of the first. If Tampa can figure out how to keep that play up... I just hope they don't"

It is upsetting though. Had to take a couple shots of tequila to make myself feel a lil better.  We'll get em on Saturday!  Go Bolts!"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Boltblue91,4,Thu Jun 4 03:33:50 2015 UTC,Let up. Exactly they let up that entire third period. Can't be too upset when they shut down Chicago and got great scoring chances on them. BUT YOU CANT SIT BACK WITH A WHOLE PERIOD. CHICAGO IS GOING TO SCORE.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,KennySlimes,3,Thu Jun 4 04:00:03 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you! You can't sit on a 1-0 lead. Definitely not against Chicago. That's just nuts.
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,IamHobs,2,Thu Jun 4 04:09:03 2015 UTC,Scoring 1 and holding on or dear life isn't going to cut it against this team... We have played very strong game 2s throughout the postseason and we NEED another won Saturday or else we are done
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,weath1860,2,Thu Jun 4 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"I thought the Lightning played quite well, even considering they didn't get much on Crawford in the third. They played pretty good defense until it got tied and they panicked. It was quite possible, maybe even likely, that they could have held on the last few minutes. That was a game they should have won but the Hawks stole it. I think that if the two teams play the same way the whole series, Tampa has this. But the Hawks could definitely play better too. This one will hurt."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,csampson,5,Thu Jun 4 03:38:09 2015 UTC,First game jitters is what i attribute the loss to. It has been 11 years since this team has been on this big of a stage. I feel a win coming saturday for the bolts. Go bolts!!
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Bad-Yeti,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:47:44 2015 UTC,Plus all of your young guys realizing that they're playing the juggernaut known as the Chicago Blackhawks on the biggest stage in hockey...I had low expectations for Game 1 (as I usually do) but we have shown to always bounce back and win our Game 2s.  GO BOLTS!

TampaBayLightning,38gy51,James_Johnson,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"We should not of focused on defense until maybe 5-10 minutes left in the 3rd, IF that was on purpose. No matter who you are, 20 minutes of defending one of the fastest teams in the league is not going to end well. They broke through due to a tired and weakened defense.   Saying that, I am confident that Cooper will keep the offensive pressure persistent in Game 2 through more of the game, giving the Bolts more balance. The Hawks are screwed if we can replicate our first couple periods throughout a whole game."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,lazybrouf,-9,Thu Jun 4 22:58:39 2015 UTC,It's exactly like all the commentators said.  Y'all's top six are beasts. Our top six our beasts. The difference will be made by the bottom six.

TampaBayLightning,38gy51,no_YOURE_sexy,3,Thu Jun 4 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"Tired in the first game of the STANLEY CUP FINALS, after 4 or 5 days off?!?   No. If you have been watching the playoffs, Coop has implemented the turtle style of play when there is a small lead, throughout the 3 previous series. Hell, I saw them go into it in the 2nd period during one game.   The fact is that we pretty much suck at doing it for any extended amount of time... 5 min to go, fine - go for it. But we are an offensive team, that is young and inexperienced. The guys are much better when they are attacking, pinching the D men up on the offensive plays, and having the forwards cover. Yes, this could lead to odd man rushes, but we play it nearly flawlessly.  Chicago plays the turtle D to a T. There were no panic in their passes or silly turnovers in their zone.   TLDR: They can't score on us if we have the puck in their zone. Keep the fucking pedal to the medal and leave the turtles at the fucking zoo."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Trump_,-34,Thu Jun 4 04:58:49 2015 UTC,"Bolt bros Fuckheads  I'm sorry for the result of the game. I don't think we deserved it. I'm so afraid of your team. We got worked in the first period. Dominated. I was watching the game with a few people who had never watched hockey before and I was embarrassed that this was their first time experiencing the blackhawks. We knew what we were doing, we were just waiting for our time to strike and you idiots fell for it  So good game guys. I hope the next few games open up a bit more. I want to see all the speed and explosiveness that we know our teams can dish. Just kidding fuck you I can't wait to just roll over the bolts without a problem  EDIT: Since I seem to have chapped a few hawks fans' assholes, I'll clarify that I'm not sorry that we won, I'm sorry your coach was a twit and turtled with a whole period left to play. I'm not sorry we won, I feel sorry for the fanbase that you handed us the win.  There we go all better now everyone's happy"

TampaBayLightning,38gy51,no_YOURE_sexy,13,Thu Jun 4 15:18:10 2015 UTC,"Jesus dude we won because they played prevent defense on a 1 goal lead for the entire third period. I know you're trying to be nice and sportsmanlike but bolts fans don't need your pity.   Frankly I hope we crush their dreams and win every game by blowout and complete the sweep in the UC. If the hawks weren't in the cup finals I would probably want the series to go to game 7 overtime. But I'm a hawks fan first, hockey fan second."
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,Topshot27,-13,Thu Jun 4 08:35:14 2015 UTC,"We also were only put in a position to come back and win because somehow Crawford made a shit ton of spectacular saves in the first and second to keep it from becoming a goddamn blowout. We were getting our asses kicked. We had 10 shots after 35 minutes of play. Typically you don't see people winning games in the SCF like that.  If they don't play prevent defense, we probably don't win that game. And they'll remember that and come out fucking flying next game.  Im proud of the hawks for sticking with it and winning. But I'm not giving them my pity. I'm giving them my honest and respectful analysis of the win from potentially another perspective than their own. And I'd want nothing more than a sweep while we kick their ass every game. But I'd be a biased and non-realistic hockey fan if I put all my money on that notion."

No. They're respectful, honest and compliment the other team when it's deserving.   Don't embarrass our fanbase by being a dick.   ""Blackhawk Nation"" has no use for me? Ok I'll brigade their game threads with taunting bullshit and smacktalk instead, being condescending and hateful the whole time. That's what being a blackhawks fan is all about right?"
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,no_YOURE_sexy,2,Thu Jun 4 09:47:19 2015 UTC,You don't go to another teams sub and apologize for the win. That's why we have no use for you. Never apologize for winning
TampaBayLightning,38gy51,ChiTown1970,-12,Thu Jun 4 11:18:44 2015 UTC,sigh read my edit in the original comment. I didn't mean to apologize for the win. I hope we sweep them in four games and don't care how we do it.

And you want to talk about the handshake after a series and sportsmanship? Ok...I guarantee you not one player on a winning team ever went thru the handshake line telling the other team ""sorry for the result. We didn't deserve it."" What you are doing is pandering for up votes and it's very transparent. Just stop it. These guys don't need your condascending posts after losing game one in the final few minutes."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,jakemark13,66,Wed Jun 3 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"Hi.  Sabres fan here.  I think the restriction of tickets is stupid and childish.    Now wait.  Consider where the Sabres (and I) are located:  one mile from Canada.  That means that every, and I mean EVERY, team, has a 5-10% presence when they play here.  It's a Stamkos fan, or a Patrick Roy fan, or whatever, but, believe me, it's here.  Now, on top of that, every time the Sabres play the Leaves or the Habs, it's about 50/50.  Every freaking time.  For the Sens, it's about 25%.  The western teams, a little less than that.  And your ticket office has the temerity to restrict tickets.  What a bunch of whiners.  Sorry, but, really, come on.  Whiners.  And STILL I'm rooting for your team."

TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,derpdiva,0,Fri Jun 5 01:53:19 2015 UTC,The seating restriction is literally for the club areas where people pay thousands for season tix to sit. 95% of our arena is still available for Hawks fans and nobody's going to restrict them.
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,Clone95,7,Thu Jun 4 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"That's the apparel restriction, which is equally stupid.  No one can buy tickets without a credit card associated with a Florida address.  That applies to the whole arena."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,The_Ineffable_One,0,Thu Jun 4 14:21:46 2015 UTC,You can buy them from the box office (assuming there were some).  The credit card restriction applies to the sales from the Lightning website which was sold out before they even went on sale to the public.  Plenty of people are buying from resellers with no problem.  Basically all it did was raise the price.
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,2ndprize,3,Thu Jun 4 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"Lol my bartender is a sabres fan. But I agree, one way or another being a hawks fan.   Bolts managers, grow up."

TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,The_Ineffable_One,2,Thu Jun 4 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"My bad, I must've misread. Point, albeit weaker, still stands since the secondary market is still viable. I don't see much wrong to allowing a degree of security to make sure that locals get a chance to a ticket.   Florida is one poor state and I see nothing wrong with giving them a chance against folks with enough disposable income to buy a round trip plane ticket (and lodging and transportation) on top of a Stanley Cup ticket. After all, it's not like they'll notice yet another expense for buying 'em somewhere else."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,YopparaiNeko,2,Thu Jun 4 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Don't shoot the messenger… I work for the team so I'm speaking officially (sorta).  Before we clinched the playoffs, our Season Ticket Members who sit in the Chase Club and the Lexus Lounge (rows A & B of the 100 level) came to us and asked if there was anything we could do about the presence of opposing team fans sitting in these club areas.  The fact is, when you are a member of a club, would't it make sense that you are also a FAN of the club you are supporting?  To me, that makes sense.  Essentially, if you're a season ticket member, in those club areas, you should be ""drinking the kool-aid"" of the Lightning.  We created the policy because we were asked to.  So yes, in a sense, our fans DID do this."

We put in a thing that gave our fans first shot at buying tickets. So? What's the issue with this? Shouldn't OUR fans get first shot?  We are limiting apparel in a miniscule section of OUR stadium at the request of OUR highest-paying supporters. What's the problem?  I am glad this makes the OTHER TEAM'S FANS upset. Why would we cater to them?"
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,Wood_Ape,-2,Wed Jun 3 22:56:24 2015 UTC,Remember when people weren't allowed into certain places because of their skin color? It's called discrimination. Do you really not see how outrageous it is to even THINK that such an idea should be allowed?
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,mikewoodld,9,Thu Jun 4 04:00:26 2015 UTC,I think comparing hockey jerseys to racial segregation is a little too extreme.
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,Wood_Ape,2,Thu Jun 4 05:02:59 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter; the structure of the logic is still the same.
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,OGHamToast,-9,Thu Jun 4 16:31:25 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but the point is that what the Lightning are doing is discrimination, plain and simple, and that's a pretty fucked up thing to do in this day and age no matter what the reasoning is. It's an archaic and disgusting way to treat others. Justifying it by saying ""only"" 7% of the facility falls under the rule still supports the idea of discrimination and a business in the United States should be beyond such archaic ideologies."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,angelsil,4,Thu Jun 4 05:31:50 2015 UTC,"You're making a comparison to racial discrimination. That is a civil rights issue and I agree completely that it's archaic and foolish, but you're wrong about discrimination being an archaic idea in general.  Discrimination in and of itself is not a bad thing and is only a way to separate groups. People associate the word with negative meaning because of the way it's used in the media, which creates a large bias against the term. For example, companies discriminate when they say a given position requires a college degree, or when they don't hire based on failed drug tests. Those are reasonable and accepted forms of discrimination, no? If you think about your daily life (and you're willing to be honest with yourself) I would wager that you discriminate daily. I know I do, like when I put an assembly crew together I discriminate against coworkers with poor skills or who work slowly.   In the use of discrimination in Tampa, we see a selection in favor of home fans to present a strong fan base to the media. It's designed to show that a small market team has the means to fill the stands with home fans. Although it is a debatable issue, there's nothing socially wrong with that and if you think there is then how about this: why don't you root for every team in the NHL equally and take no favoritism and be happy no matter who wins, quit discriminating."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,Wood_Ape,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"Don't go making sense, now."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,OGHamToast,-1,Thu Jun 4 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not forcing my fandom on anybody else. That's an absurd stance to take.  Discriminating people because they aren't wearing Tampa gear is shitty. The whole problem stems from the fact that Tampa fans aren't buying the tickets in the first place or place a higher value on selling those tickets to whoever on the secondary market. Either way, both of those things are bad for the Lightning. If getting to the Stanley Cup Finals isn't enough of a reason for locals to gobble up tickets, then it shows that there isn't a strong fan base. (Understand I'm not shitting on fans, but the market. There's a distinction between the two.) Do you really think that having to make up rules intended to keep fans of the other team out is going to portray the Lightning fan base as one that is strong? It does the exact opposite. It says ""They can't fill their own barn and have to work to keep the other team's fans out."" That's the exact opposite of showing a strong fan base."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,SNl9ER,0,Thu Jun 4 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"I think you missed my point entirely, especially since you seem to think I'm saying something about forcing your fandom on others? Not sure where that came from.   In any case, the decision to limit ticket sales in a select few areas doesn't seem to have had an impact on the organization or the market at all as we are still selling out the arena and enjoying one of the best attendance records in the league. As far as locals not buying tickets, do you realize just how many people live in Tampa who are from other places? Now do you also realize how quickly playoff tickets sell out? I mean, the tickets sold out in 2 minutes for the SCF, how are Tampa fans somehow expected to snatche those up before Hawks fans? I just don't see how you've come to the conclusion that because away gear is limited in certain areas that we have a weak fan base or flaky fans. In reality, the team is simply based in a region with a very transient population."

TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,TheCenterOfEnnui,-3,Thu Jun 4 06:29:58 2015 UTC,And it says something about the team. Is the front office so worried that the opposing teams fans will show up more than Tampa bay fans? Shows that the front office thinks it can't pack a stadium full of home fans without making it more difficult for other fans to get in.

TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,jxnfpm,2,Thu Jun 4 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"why are you concerning yourself with what they wear   The team cares because the owners of premium suites and glassfront seats asked them to put this policy in place. I guarantee this policy wouldn't be implemented otherwise. If your corporate sponsors and highest-paid ticketholders ask you to ensure they are sitting in a home-team area, you get it done. It's a business, after all, and you're catering to Lightning fans not Blackhawks, Rangers, Habs, or Red Wings fans.  Other teams have supporter areas and similar restrictions. This is not groundbreaking."
TampaBayLightning,38fhsq,BitterBosh,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:35:38 2015 UTC,"Once you acquire your own team you are free to implement rules as you see fit.  Lightning management aren't concerned with what people in Chicago think about their policies; the people they are concerned with are the ones who spends thousands upon thousands of dollars for season tickets.  As a season ticket holder I personally don't give a shit what other market fans think of the policy and I happy to see the ownership cater to the people who pay the bills.  Also, I would love to know how many people who are bitching about these rules were actually going to buy tickets to come down here and see the game, let alone spend the money to get Lexus or Chase club tickets."

I wouldn't be surprised if TBL made some line changes and came out with a more rounded play next game. Taking advantage of of bad passes and creating opportunities. If there is any team to make a great Cup it's definitely you guys. GG guys, looking forward to more heart stopping excellent play from both teams."

I think the hawks took control of the puck starting in the second, though our 4th line really wasn't producing, honestly a matchup against that line, or really a well split second could be a real threat against us. I'm a fan of good and stressful hockey and tonight, I got it in spades."
TampaBayLightning,38f25n,Quotered,2,Thu Jun 4 03:25:38 2015 UTC,No thinking Hawks fan would think that. So many teams come back from 3-1 or 3-0 down. It's never over until the horn sounds on win/loss #4.

TampaBayLightning,38f25n,Yeahdingus,4,Thu Jun 4 04:33:30 2015 UTC,And I'm sure those two goals we scored within two minutes in the third was also lackadaisically given to us by TB. So much for a defensive trap. No one gave away anything. Chicago played better and more consistent at the end of the stretch.

TampaBayLightning,38f25n,InFlamesWeTrust,4,Thu Jun 4 18:59:37 2015 UTC,It took a while (2 periods) but the hawks discovered the TB Lightnings critical weakness.  Put a big body in the crease. The Lightning has no one who can or is willing to push them out.  The Chief probably said this 100 times during the regular season.  Still true.
TampaBayLightning,38f25n,TheEvilKingStan,7,Thu Jun 4 03:06:51 2015 UTC,Chicago didn't discover anything except a Tampa team too scared to play aggressively and content to hand the game to them by parking the bus.
TampaBayLightning,38f25n,VirtuaSaturn,0,Thu Jun 4 03:08:44 2015 UTC,Uh ok bud. Hawks outplayed the bolts in every period but the first.

TampaBayLightning,38f25n,VirtuaSaturn,3,Thu Jun 4 03:01:32 2015 UTC,"Amazing 1st period, great 2nd...that 3rd was Isles in game 7-esque. Not sure what the message was to the team but they looked afraid to play any offense. Once again, Bishop lets in goals in the last 5 or so minutes. Had chances to put this game away but Crawford really shut the door after Killorn's goal. I really hope the Lightning come out and play a more offensive game Saturday.  Chicago is a team that always seems to find that extra gear. I think people have a hard time figuring out why they do it because it is different every time. Everyone has bought in there so there is always someone that steps up. Not saying that we don't have that, but we need to find that extra gear. JT Brown needs to score some motherfuckin goals is what I'm saying"
TampaBayLightning,38f25n,VirtuaSaturn,-10,Thu Jun 4 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"Well, win game 2 or it's pretty much over. I hope we beat Shitcago like 7-1 on Friday. Edit: OOPS. Saturday. I knew that."

TampaBayLightning,38gsj1,TSTMWKU,2,Thu Jun 4 02:57:40 2015 UTC,How do we know this is a coaching move and not players just letting off the gas?
TampaBayLightning,38gsj1,TSTMWKU,2,Thu Jun 4 03:03:46 2015 UTC,Because the entire team as a whole switched to a defensive mindset.  That's a coaching choice.
TampaBayLightning,38gsj1,TIFUByJoiningReddit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:04:51 2015 UTC,You could tell based off how little we were forechecking. Wouldn't go below the circles in the offensive zone. You could tell the triplets wanted to but stayed up near the blue line.

TampaBayLightning,38csjy,danki5000,17,Wed Jun 3 14:45:54 2015 UTC,"I don't give two shits either way. Jeff Vinik paid a lot of money for the Tampa Bay Lightning and if he says we have to rub our belly and pat our head at the same time to get into the game, so be it. This has been blown way out of proportion and some Hawks fans are trying to make themselves out to look like victims or something.   You are not a victim. You will have to pay the exorbitant prices on Stubhub just like a lot of other people going to the game. You can still wear your jerseys unless you are sitting in a specific 7% of the arena. Cry. Me. A. Fucking. River.   Edit: That being said, there is no reason to be salty to Hawks fans unless they are trying to start some shit. In which case your usher is your friend. No vigilante justice necessary."
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,alyalyatwork,5,Wed Jun 3 14:52:33 2015 UTC,"Well said. The whole thing is just stupid. We're talking what, 1200 seats, all of which are insanely expensive, and just about every single one is already spoken for by a TBL fan. This might affect like...10 people in reality. GMAFB. This is just morons trying to come up with reasons why TBL sucks, or whatever."
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,danki5000,3,Wed Jun 3 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't looking for a reason as to why Tampa sucks? Last time I checked the Bolts are in the Cup Final, so only the assuming type would say they suck? I thought Alyalyatwork had a very well articulated and intelligent post, and merely asked how they felt about the jersey policy. I understand it can be an exhausting storyline to talk about, but you dont have to call me a moron."
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,alyalyatwork,2,Wed Jun 3 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"Not you, anyone who complains about the policy. You weren't complaining....but anyone who bellyaches b/c ""their jersey is banned"" or whatever...moron."

TampaBayLightning,38csjy,alyalyatwork,-2,Wed Jun 3 19:52:45 2015 UTC,"Right on, I'm not complaining or trying to paint Hawks fans as victims. I was just asking how you felt, and clearly you are adamant that its the OTHER people who are wrong for even bringing it up. Obviously its not that big of a deal and yes it is blown a bit out of proportion, but to me it seems petty and a bit cowardly. Nashville has the same policy, and most of their fans who I've asked say its embarrassing. Thanks for answering my question! Good luck to your Bolts buddy!"
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,TSTMWKU,4,Wed Jun 3 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's dumb and arbitrary. But it's our arena, it's our rules. Build a bridge and get the hell back to United Center if you have that big of an issue with it.   Note: I mean ""you"" as in the people complaining, of course. And for the record I definitely didn't downvote you -- I just think Lightning fans are getting SO sick of Hawks fans (and away fans in general) playing the victim. We consistently deal with jackass visitors throughout the year, as well as totally nice and normal ones. It wears on you after a while, and to have the biggest issue around the Final be about who can buy tickets through Ticketmaster and who can wear what jersey where in the arena is SO FUCKING STUPID!   Glad I could help explain one fan's perspective. Go Bolts!!! :)"
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,danki5000,3,Wed Jun 3 15:45:13 2015 UTC,"I totally understand how it could get very old very fast, it really is a non-issue. Thanks for answering honestly :)   And for the record as well- Hawks fans have been adamantly telling our attractive female peers who will be attending in Tampa in those restricted sections to wear hawks undergarments... if you... catch my drift... ;) Good luck tho buddy, here's to a bad-ass Finals match-up and a great season/series to both squads! I'll be checkin in on this sub from time-to-time to try and keep the loudmouth  jackass Hawks fans in check."
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,danki5000,5,Wed Jun 3 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"If someone is dumb enough to flash their underwear they're dumb enough to spend the night in jail.   For the record, I'm a lady, and dated a Hawks fan for 2 years. I had a pair of those underwear once. From what I remember, the ones I had left nothing to the imagination. So... yeah. I wouldn't recommend it, Hawks ladies."
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,danki5000,2,Wed Jun 3 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"For the record... Wait that's too many records. Yes that would be quite dumb for someone to do that, and they would go to the drunktank deservedly.

TampaBayLightning,38csjy,Tenziru,2,Wed Jun 3 15:04:29 2015 UTC,Is it not all opposing team apparel cannot be worn in club level and first section seating?
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,millionaremattdavis,6,Wed Jun 3 15:22:30 2015 UTC,Club premium suites (not ALL club level) and first two rows on glass. The rest of the lower bowl and club area is fine. It works out to about 7% of the seats and the most expensive at that.
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,houseofbeards,6,Wed Jun 3 15:27:58 2015 UTC,Right on thanks for clearing that up. I thought it was whole first section before break in seating (like first 15 rows or something). Being informed is the first step to understanding :)
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,InFlamesWeTrust,5,Wed Jun 3 15:46:01 2015 UTC,No worries. I have season tickets on row 7 and I fully expect a sea of red in my area. Will pre-game with many beers to prepare.

TampaBayLightning,38csjy,Devils_-_Advocate,2,Wed Jun 3 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"I understand downvoting if they come in being an asshole, but just asking a question doesn't warrant it.  I think the whole circlejerk about the Lightning's stadium policies is ludicrous. Like you learned below, it's the sponsors of the club seat sections who requested to have the uniform policy done. I have no problem with it. The Lightning are also still a ""young"" team in an area that is filled with transplants. I don't mind helping to create a ""home-town feel"" here at all"

TampaBayLightning,38csjy,TIFUByJoiningReddit,8,Wed Jun 3 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"This should be a great series both teams are very similar. Bishop (.920) and Crawford (.919) have close save percentages and Stamkos, Kucherov and Johnson have 57 goals combined while Kane, Towes and Keith have 56 this postseason. The Blackhawks have more experience and that's already the theme of this series but the same was said about the Lightning the entire playoffs and here they are in the SCF. I like Cooper's take on the Bolts being too young and dumb to know any better when it comes to feeling pressure. They have won 2 Game 7's, have 3 shuouts and are still haven't lost 3 consecutive games since last season, not to mention are the highest scoring team in the league. The Lightning have just as good of a chance of winning this series as Chicago and we have home ice advantage (unfortunately that hasn't been much of an advantage). This team is young, talented, resilient and has risen to the occasion in the past and will again in the Stanley Cup Finals!  GO BOLTS!"

TampaBayLightning,38csjy,rijkard,5,Wed Jun 3 13:11:27 2015 UTC,My body is ready for tonight!!  LET'S GO BOLTS!!!! ZIPPITY ZAP!
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,rijkard,6,Wed Jun 3 12:29:19 2015 UTC,I don't think I'm fully appreciating how big this is yet. I'm so excited for tonight but every playoff game has made me so anxious I don't know if it's possible to get any more pumped for an SCF game.  This is going to be one hell of a series.
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,swingsetmafia,6,Wed Jun 3 13:00:54 2015 UTC,"It's funny: we haven't been here for so long, but all of a sudden it feels like yesterday. I dug this up the other day, and seeing Vinny that young is the only thing that made it feel like it's been a long time since we were here last.  Guess I should look in a mirror.  If you're bored today and want to waste a shitload of time getting to know more about how these teams play hockey, immerse yourself in this article. It's specific to special teams, but it's a really in-depth look at how both teams operate. The author is a Blackhawks fan, but there's very little bias there, and unless you're a player, I guarantee you'll learn something.  If you're going tonight, cheer extra loud for me, please.   GO BOLTS!!!"

TampaBayLightning,38csjy,coolman1581,5,Wed Jun 3 13:36:20 2015 UTC,So excited!!!! I have to work tonight because that's poop and stuff. But I'll probably do what I did for game 7 and listen to Mishkin for half the game until I can get to a TV. That only half felt like dying.   I'm just super excited. I don't know if it's sunk in fully to me that this beautiful team is here at the end and every time I think about it I get so pumped all over again!
TampaBayLightning,38csjy,Blake1288,4,Wed Jun 3 14:07:58 2015 UTC,This is awesome! So fucking pumped for this! Time to prove everyone wrong once again.

TampaBayLightning,38cpra,Blake1288,6,Wed Jun 3 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"100% agreed.  This team has already set NHL and Lightning records, and this year is an amazing success.  Win or lose, we have most of this team next year, and both the immediate future and next season look bright.  Who knows what'll happen in the next two weeks?  That said, let's cheer our asses off for our team and hope we can continue defying the naysayers!"
TampaBayLightning,38cpra,thisguy130,5,Wed Jun 3 14:57:13 2015 UTC,"No matter how things turn out, this has been an amazing ride, and I don't think it ends with this season. I don't know of many teams that are better poised to become yearly contenders than we are. We've got a young, absurdly talented group, a coach with a Midas touch, and a god-tier GM. There are other teams out there with promising futures, but none as complete as the Lightning."

TampaBayLightning,38enff,Mauldrich,3,Wed Jun 3 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"if no one does for game 1, I might for 2 (though I am on the wrong side). Definitely just want to watch it all and get pumped for game 1, though."

The 12-time world champion went to share some travel plans.""  Just no. Don't let this happen.  ""I guess there's only one thing to do Blackhawks fans. You better say your prayers and eat your vitamins so Hulkamania and the Lightning don't destroy your team.  Yeah, OK.""  Oh, shut the fuck up already."
TampaBayLightning,38em10,2ndprize,4,Wed Jun 3 18:30:01 2015 UTC,I give him credit. The man is the master of getting free shit.
TampaBayLightning,38em10,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:48:26 2015 UTC,Is that actually even true about being undefeated when Brooke sang the national anthem? Didn't she sing at basically every home game in 2004? They definitely didn't win every home game.
TampaBayLightning,38em10,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:14:50 2015 UTC,"Ehh, not sure. I wasn't able to go to any of the games and was a freshman in high school when it happened so I can't remember."

TampaBayLightning,38em10,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"All I remember was where I was when we won the cup. It was a graduation party at the Lakeland FOP building. I had spent all day at wrestling camp (lol) and just stood there with my grandfather all night watching the game. I think we were really the only people there interested or that celebrated after we won.   The memories of the rest of the series are a little fuzzy, but I remember game six and how it was constantly back-and-forth and that's all anyone was ever talking about."
TampaBayLightning,38em10,millionaremattdavis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:43:18 2015 UTC,Game 6 is fuzzy for me too except for St. Louis' game winning goal. I had the tv volume turned down and the radio playing on full blast. To this day it remains one of my favorite calls.
TampaBayLightning,38imhj,jchristo86,6,Thu Jun 4 13:42:21 2015 UTC,Glad he didn't get injured at least. That looked like it hurt like a mother fucker.
TampaBayLightning,38imhj,Squeaky_Is_Evil,6,Thu Jun 4 14:08:09 2015 UTC,He actually tried to avoid Bishop at least. Would have sucked if we lost Bish at this stage.
TampaBayLightning,38imhj,csampson,-5,Thu Jun 4 13:53:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And he got a penalty, which was nice. :)"
TampaBayLightning,38imhj,csampson,3,Thu Jun 4 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unwarranted I would say but the angle the ref had it looked worse than it was. Probably made up for some of those missed high sticking calls. Either way, we didn't do much with the PP and the 3rd just killed it for us."
TampaBayLightning,38imhj,sarnald,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, the angle the ref had didn't show the skates getting tangled up. Didn't matter though."
TampaBayLightning,38f0ls,ThatLineOfTriplets,3,Wed Jun 3 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's to try to break up the home ice advantage of having the last change. They are often out there for only seconds if they don't win the faceoff or gain offensive zone entry quickly, leading to what will hopefully be a favorable matchup for whatever line we put out next."
TampaBayLightning,38f0ls,fuckyouabunch,3,Wed Jun 3 20:02:51 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. Just get the other coach to throw out a line and then we can decide which line matches up best and get them on the ice.
TampaBayLightning,38f0ls,fuckyouabunch,3,Wed Jun 3 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think  it gives Coop and Bowness a look at who the other coach wants to have out there. A lot of times when we've done it quick whistles or loss of possession have blown the opportunity, but other times we've seen some really weird things, like someone changing off and Kucherov coming out with a couple of those guys."
TampaBayLightning,38g4yu,WaywardProphet,3,Thu Jun 4 00:07:48 2015 UTC,"Games 5 and 7 are both sold out already.    Edit: During the presale, only single seats were available."

I was working today and didn't have time.  I'm almost sure everyone who picked killorn switched after the goal (can't be sure), but you and I know the rules as we're neck and almost-neck in the home stretch and have frequently switched our guesses very near the end of the 1st.  FWIW, I realize the last sentence sounds accusitory, I tried to word it in a way that wasn't, but my liver doth protest too much."
TampaBayLightning,38du2k,The_estimator_is_in,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:49:01 2015 UTC,Doesn't sound accusatory at all I agree. I thought about switching mine but I figured it would be unfair. Tough loss last night though. We needed to play a full 60 minutes not 45

TampaBayLightning,38dde9,KING522,10,Wed Jun 3 14:13:53 2015 UTC,The best are the Facebook fans. Holy fucking poop.
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Squeaky_Is_Evil,11,Wed Jun 3 14:28:19 2015 UTC,NEVER read the Facebook comments. Ever.
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,angelsil,6,Wed Jun 3 14:29:31 2015 UTC,I don't even know why I get so angry at them either. Probably the ignorance is overbearing.
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Squeaky_Is_Evil,4,Wed Jun 3 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"this is exactly what im talking about. They literally are like ""tampa? aint that the city with the worst baseball and football teams? they have a hockey team? must have 0 fans"" im just like wow what logic"
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Squeaky_Is_Evil,5,Wed Jun 3 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"""Rangers should have been against us. They deserve it more and they're an Original 6."""
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Mauldrich,5,Wed Jun 3 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"The whole original 6 crap gets me more than anything.  So for 25 years, they had 6 teams that fought for 4 spots.  Whoopty-doo!  It means they had it easy for 25 years.  To me that makes that much less of an honor."
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Exique,2,Wed Jun 3 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"I love the whole ""MAAAA, BUUUT WHAT ABOUT THE RATINGS?"" mindset..."
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,angelsil,10,Wed Jun 3 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"As I said in the pre-game thread, this will be decided on the ice. Not on Reddit. Not on Twitter. Not on 'insert team blog here'. I very much like our chances on the ice."
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,2ndprize,18,Wed Jun 3 14:24:39 2015 UTC,I love this shit. Let everyone talk shit. This reminds me a lot of when the Gators played Ohio State for the National Championship. No one was giving them a chance at all.
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Blake1288,3,Wed Jun 3 14:17:43 2015 UTC,"It pisses me off but at the same time, going back to what Habs, Rangers and Wings fans had to say I can't help but smile."

TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Mauldrich,3,Wed Jun 3 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's great. We are always the underdogs due to uninformed masses.  We don't get NHL/NBC features about our program.  So when we have a good team, nobody has a clue.  Then we have to show them while they kick and scream.  I think it will take a few years in a row to let people know what we're about.  When I see comments that are way off mark, I can't help but just smile and nod."

TampaBayLightning,38dde9,thedaj,2,Wed Jun 3 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"For me, it was noticing that for a few days, none of my posts yielded any reaction.  No upvotes, no downvotes, no comments.  Thankfully, /u/TSTMWKU is kind of a bro, and had just recently posted about the overuse of the shadowban feature in some of the other subs"
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,titsforhits,2,Wed Jun 3 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"I've met and heard so many Blackhawks fans who are completely writing off the Lightning this week because they don't actually watch hockey and it's pretty infuriating. I consider myself a hockey fan first and a Blackhawks fan second, so I'm hoping the Lightning put up a strong showing and show all those smug assholes what's up."
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,angelsil,3,Wed Jun 3 17:59:42 2015 UTC,"It's a bit silly, to be honest. You don't get to the Final by being a shit team."

TampaBayLightning,38dde9,princelabia,3,Wed Jun 3 17:22:05 2015 UTC,I kinda want the Wings fans back...they were turds but at least they knew mostly what the fuck they were talking about  These Hawks fans are insufferable
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,Buddy813,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"""Fans"" aren't fans if they don't know what they are talking about. ""Fan"" is short for fanatic. I'm sure most of those people aren't really ""Fans""."
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,atikatothesea,2,Wed Jun 3 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"This...  Most of us know, Tampa didn't get to the finals by being weak or inferior. Chicago has a huge fanbase so we get to see a lot of idiots and Social media is where the hockey morons hang. I expect a hard fought series. I hope the hawks win of course and I have faith but only a fool predicts a one sided affair. We witnessed this from both sides in the WCF. Ridiculous, these are ALL outstanding athletes."
TampaBayLightning,38dde9,TampaFresh,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"It's honestly hilarious to read sometimes. I read something this guy said that was like ""Crawford deals with haters better than everyone else, if ppl keep hating him he will be better""."
TampaBayLightning,38f4mi,The_estimator_is_in,6,Wed Jun 3 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"It's what I said during Game 7 against NYR. Everyone expected Lundqvist to be their savior and win another elimination game at home. So I thought, they have everything to lose, while we have nothing to lose.  I feel like the same goes for this series. Everyone expects the Blackhawks to win. So give them nothing, but take from them everything."
TampaBayLightning,38f4mi,likemyhashtag,2,Wed Jun 3 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"General consensus seems to be that it will be a 6 or 7 game series of the two most well-matched teams most people can remember. Also, YOU NEVER, FUCKING EVER SAY THE S WORD. JESUS FUCK!"

TampaBayLightning,38cs0h,sarnald,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"All broadcast television is ""effectively"" 60 fps. 720p networks (ABC/FOX/etc) are broadcast natively in 60 fps, and 1080i networks (NBC/CBS/almost all others) are deinterlaced by your television/cable box/other device and the result is 60 frames per second."

TampaBayLightning,38h29b,The_estimator_is_in,4,Thu Jun 4 04:51:03 2015 UTC,Make up call. For the interference penalty that was bullshit.  Lightning should just suck it up and not give up goals that are easily preventable.
TampaBayLightning,38h29b,lazybrouf,5,Thu Jun 4 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"It's not a make up call.  When you're playing the puck if you're following through with your stick and it hits someone it's not a penalty.   60.1 High-sticking - A “high stick” is one which is carried above the height of the opponent’s shoulders. Players must be in control and responsible for their stick. However, a player is permitted accidental contact on an opponent if the act is committed as a normal windup or follow through of a shooting motion, or accidental contact on the opposing center who is bent over during the course of a face-off. A wild swing at a bouncing puck would not be considered a normal"
