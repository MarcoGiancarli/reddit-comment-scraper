hoggit,3e2c60,Devil-TR,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:47 2015 UTC,"Is there a way to move the default ""center"" viewpoint down? I'm using the workaround of looking up a bit then hitting TrackIR reset, but of course that means your deadzone is in the wrong place. Ideally I'd like the MFDs to be in view at center.  Also, in Campaign doing SEAD missions I fail all of them because I get near the target area and suddenly there's SAMs everywhere and I'm being launched at... except for by the target ones. So I kill however many I can that are nearby and RTB, and despite there being 4 (or whatever) less enemy SAMs in the TA I've failed because I didn't kill the 2 they asked for. Is there something I can do to have a better chance of finding those two rather than getting lit up by the 5+ around them?"
hoggit,3e2c60,filthyneckbeard,3,Tue Jul 21 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"The campaign is best played when you create your own missions.  When you just let HQ assign missions they set up some retarded ones sometimes like deep strikes with no escort so you either run out of missiles to defend yourself or get killed by either fighters or the countless other SAMs on your way to the target area.  It's really not as hard as you think and it makes you way more in tune with the plan when you do it yourself.  It also makes completing missions much more satisfying.  There are YouTube videos that show you how to frag a mission from start to finish(I believe I watched the one by Krause).  Decide you want to take out an air base that houses some MiGs?  Set up a strike package with some SEAD escort and maybe fighter escort as well, and then choose which element you want to pilot.  Seriously, it makes the game awesome on a whole new level."
hoggit,3e2c60,Sha-WING,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"This. A thousand times this. When you start a new campaign and you've selected your squadron (like the 120th FS for instance), go to Intel -> Squadron, and uncheck Set By HQ, then delete any fragged packages (do this under ATO from the main screen).  The AI will still run the war for other squadrons, but you're now in total control of your own squadron. So you can start prosecuting the war ""correctly"", aka sweep the enemy fighters out of the sky, do DEAD/SEAD with escorts, and then eventually start hitting bridges and HQ's with strikes as you bring down the enemy air defense net.  My only recommendation is to frag some BARCAP's around your base, so you don't have to scramble to intercept every attack yourself. Unless you want to scramble, which can be fun too."

hoggit,3dze3g,_hai,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"From my (very, very) limited experience, it's just the nature of the Su-27 to be very unstable if left untrimmed. The slightest change in throttle requires retrimming to maintain stable flight. That said, it doesn't surprise me that you had issues with control during landing, since you trimmed out during cruise, when your throttle and aircraft configuration were different."
hoggit,3dze3g,amargherio,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:20 2015 UTC,Its the nature of the beast. You have to constantly trim it (sort of like the P-51 as well [though to a lesser extent])

Also, trimming results in a visual movement of the stick for russian aircraft (at least, it does on the 25T) so you can usually eyeball proper trim for various stages of flight just by looking at the stick.  I assume that's what the white stripe is for on the 25T."

hoggit,3dze3g,Turkino,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:38 2015 UTC,"Pro tip: Alt+1 (turns auto pilot on), and it will trim the plane for you. Then hit alt+9 to disconnect auto pilot. Takes a few seconds, but it works most of the time. If you're climbing, make sure to apply a gentle touch of back pressure to keep it from inverting. Once it stabilizes, let go of the stick, and then you're good. Disconnect auto pilot and you have an auto trimmed Su-27."

hoggit,3dze3g,dokid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"The Su-27 needs almost constant trimming (at low speeds especially) but if I recall correctly you can get the autopilot (which has a huge number of features) to do much of the work for you.  Enable barometric altitude autopilot when you're at altitude (LAlt-4 default I think) and the plane will trim itself for the current throttle & altitude, then turn off autopilot. It's by no means perfect but it does help keep the flanker under control."

They are lengthy, can't be paused, frequently bug out when you screw up, and tend to flood you with a mix of useful/useless information which all adds up to an incredibly frustrating introduction.   Youtube guides tend to focus only on the essentials, once you understand those it becomes much easier to build your skills out."

Grab a profile for the x-52. I use the Iron profile. Pop open dcs and bind keys according to the profile layout images. Make any changes you think you might like. Fly!   There are other profiles, some of which are probably better or more up to date / realistic. Others will have to weigh in on that though as I haven't tried any others."

The ""kh"" transliteration of the Russian ""h"" sound (х in Cyrillic) is supposed to get across the idea that it's different from English ""h"".  This transliteration also attempts, usually unsuccessfully, to give the reader a little hint as to how to pronounce it correctly.  Basically, pronounce a ""k"" sound and freeze your mouth/tongue at the beginning of it.  Use that mouth/tongue position as a starting point for the Russian ""h"" sound.

That said I think the Mig-31 should be the DCS level 4th Gen fighter for the Soviets, there doesn't have to be a direct analogue to the F-18C.

hoggit,3duhoz,Teeter477,5,Sun Jul 19 17:50:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'll probably forget some things but here's what I remember:   The F-18's cockpit is almost completed. Some gauges were wrong/non-existant.  The F-15's flight model has been tested and praised by F-15 pilots who were ""ecstatic"" about it. Minor issues with yaw/roll at high AoA to be fixed. The ""flight model dynamics"" of the F-15 can carry over to the F-18, thus shortening development time.  Whether or not NTTR and DCS W2 will release at the same time is TBD. The next major update will be the alpha release of DCS W2.  The team has made great progress on the Spitfire, the model is now flyable in DCS W2. There were several screenshots of it during the Q&A, looked great. SLI and Crossfire performance will improve in DCS W2. The additional card willl supposedly double FPS.  Direct-to-Rift is working in DCS W2. At least 75 FPS for the DK2 and 90 FPS for the CV1 is recommended to minimize judder.  Clickable cockpits are not working that well in the Rift due to the way that the cursor is modeled. A ""laser pointer"" solution is being looked into."

At least with iron bombs there is quantifiable explosion radius where max damage occurs and falls off over a distance. For other weapons it might exist but the explosive power isn't substantial enough for it to be noticed."
hoggit,3duhoz,3sqn_Grimes,0,Mon Jul 20 06:56:57 2015 UTC,I think the lack of splash damage is most noticeable when shooting rockets at infantry or trucks. Targets that aren't directly hit aren't damaged.

Another benefit is that they allow for infinite scalability, because rather than blurring when enlarged, you just adjust everything equally and it's all re-rendered in perfect quality.  This drawing (MIG-21) was done 99% with a normal mouse. I used a cheap pressure sensitive graphics tablet (wacom) to draw the vapour trails and window highlights. You can do those with the mouse too but it was just a matter of convenience to use the tablet in order to get the slight taper quickly. Other drawings I've done, I wouldn't use the mouse at all. Here's a closeup of a section of a feather headpiece in one of my drawings:  http://i.imgur.com/RvpqM9f.png  Bonus moon kangaroo: http://i.imgur.com/6v0eirx.png  Those are both 100% tablet and pen. You can see you have a huge range of flexibility with vectors, from the clean mechanical lines of a plane to soft organic shapes like feathers. You can even kind of paint, though there are better programs for painting.  So what I'm saying I suppose, is that as far as I know there isn't really a name for the style, so much as the style comes from how the image is made. On a personal level I've never been one to fuss much with backgrounds for my doodles, so that lends some more cleanliness to the drawings.  I hope you give it a go yourself! It can be incredibly therapeutic and enjoyable, even if you suck. I sucked once. I still do but not as bad. You too can also suck not as bad, and maybe even be great! :D  Thanks for allowing me to ramble a bit. I don't often get to show people my drawings and talk about illustrator and stuff. I hope it's been helpful.  I will absolutely do an a-10c next! I'll be sure to stick it on hoggit :)  /r/AdobeIllustrator is a good sub to poke around on to see the work of people much better than myself and to ask questions."

Its just easier to work with for stuff like that.   Awesome wallpaper by the way, I look forward to seeing whatever you do in the future. :)"
hoggit,3ds9mn,stealthgunner385,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:46:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks a mill pal, appreciate it.  Oh man. Now I really want to draw some liveries for the a-10c. Could you point me in the direction of a tutorial for finding the files I'd need to modify and how to import them?"
hoggit,3ds9mn,LevelPulse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"You start with the texture template for a given aircraft. The A-10C has 12 files at 2048x2048 that define its texture. So its really a PITA to get things to lineup at times. The templates will have a number of layers on them that make up all parts of the texture from the actual paint scheme, to markings, and grunge layers to dirty it up. Its best to use photoshop or gimp to modify the templates. Although I do use Illustrator to draw stuff and then import that work into PS. The sim supports a number of file types, but dds is highly recommended so best to use a dds export plugin.   From there each aircraft livery is stored and defined in its own folder, for instance C:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World\Bazar\Liveries<ObjectName><LiveryName>. However some aircraft, like the F-86F, have a livery folder in their respective coremods folder for instance: Install\CoreMods\Aircraft\F-86\Liveries\f-86f sabre.   Within each folder is the ""description.lua"" file which defines the textures that are used for a given livery. This file is different for each aircraft. This post should help give you an idea on the formatting. You can also lookup other examples of the file for any of the liveries to get a better idea of how it works.   From there it is best to use the model viewer to preview your livery and progress since it loads WAY faster than the game. To use the model viewer you must make a batch file and place it in your root DCS install folder. The batch file must have the command     bin\ModelViewer.exe   Once you launch the model viewer you have to load the model, which is typically found in Eagle Dynamics\DCS World\Bazar\World\Shapes, but can also be found in a corresponding coremods folder, again like the F-86, DCS World\CoreMods\aircraft\F-86\Shapes. The model is in the .EDM and you will want to pick the version that is the largest file size, the smaller files are the lower LODs. Once open you can select the livery by selecting View>Dialogs>Show Livery Dialog. A window will pop up, select the object you are viewing in the left column and all valid liveries for it will populate the right column. Double click what you want to see and make note of what you have to change.   Unfortunately you have to close and reopen the model viewer for changes made to the files to be recognized. But again, its MUCH quicker than loading into the game."

I would absolutely LOVE to have the large pro, just for the closer to 1:1 movement ratio, but you get used to the odd ratios very quickly and after an hour or so initially it will feel natural.  Normally I'm one to aim for fancy kit when it comes to peripherals, but tablets are really the kind of thing where it's the user and not the hardware as long as the basic features are met like pressure touch.  If you're using illustrator I highly recommend downloading x-mouse and setting up a bind so you can pan with middle mouse, as for whatever insane reason illustrator doesn't natively support binding mouse buttons to the pan function which I find essential for work of any detail."

I could map toggle switches / button-up events just fine in DCS' config files (would be nice if it was possible in game of course).

hoggit,3dsse0,nd1312,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"The toggle switches only send a signal when turned on, there's nothing to tell it turn off unless you toggle the switch off and on again.  Everything in the A10 works properly because it was coded to use the TMWH natively, with most other aircraft this isn't the case, for example, map your radar in the F15 to one of the toggles, sure it will turn on when you flip it, but to turn it off you must flip the switch down and up again.  In FSX you have to option of performing an action when a switch is turned off. I hate FSX but that to me is a great feature we're missing."
hoggit,3dsse0,Deezle666,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:35 2015 UTC,"No, its very well possible to do that in dcs. You just have to edit the config files by hand, like I said. I've done it for almost all aircraft already. Without target. They don't use any magic for the a-10, just a preset config.  In fsx however I haven't found a way to do it natively. If you could give me a hint how to do it, that would be great."
hoggit,3dsse0,nd1312,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"I'm aware it's possible, hence my comment about the mod for the MiG 21, hand editing LUA files is not the same as just checking a box in the options menu.   When mapping buttons in FSX there should be a check box that says something like ""perform action when button is off"". Therefore, you would map landing gear up to button 1, then map landing gear down to button 1 as well, except check the box, and it should toggle the landing gear each time you move the switch.  I tried following a guide on how to add the switch functionality by editing the LUA files but it was old and no longer pertains to the current version of DCS."

All of the new joystick bindings I added are up near the top of the file and have some decorative # and = symbols surrounding the section. If you pick one of the new bindings and do a search for the ""up"" or ""down"" value and find the original binding you'll see how it works."
hoggit,3dsse0,sniporbob,2,Mon Jul 20 03:12:41 2015 UTC,"I use Target for BMS and other games that have issues with the switches. For DCS, where I can edit the game's control files so that the Warthog can be mapped directly, I do that instead. Changing to a different Target script seems to require restarting DCS (maybe that's just my PC?) and it gets annoying having to do that every time I want to fly something else in multiplayer. So far I've fixed the controls for the Mig-21 and (kind of) the UH-1H, and they're available to everyone for free in the TCMC mod pack."

hoggit,3dsse0,redterror,2,Mon Jul 20 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. I just recently became a Warthog owner, and I was surprised at how DCS and other flight sims don't pick up a signal from the throttle switches in their off or neutral positions, and how limiting that is in binding functions for any aircraft other than the A10C. You'll find yourself throwing a switch back and forth twice to toggle something on and off.  Some nice people in the Hoggit IRC channel helped me see the solution, and that is to use TARGET to force it to send a signal in those switch positions. The virtual device in a TARGET profile can have up to (I think) 32 DirectX buttons, plus a hat and axes. The first 28 virtual buttons you set to the actual button numbers, which you have to do one by one, unless I overlooked a shortcut, and it's tedious. You have enough virtual buttons left over for the neutral positions of the switches on the handles, but not enough for all of them. For the remaining switches on the base, I bound the neutral/off positions to keystrokes.  I'm traveling now, but I may be able to just post the file for this in a few days if there's interest."

hoggit,3dsse0,Incursus,2,Sun Jul 19 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"No, I don't use TARGET.  DCS and Elite mapping systems are capable enough for me.  In DCS I fly almost all the different aircraft and I set up all the controls myself.  I did use the MiG-21 mod to make the switches work better.  I don't understand why the stock product couldn't include suitable mappings given the popularity of the Warthog for DCS users.  Maybe the devs didn't have one to test with.  In any case, no big deal.  I generally try hard to avoid using software from hardware companies as much as possible, as such software tends to be poor quality and rage-inducing."
hoggit,3dsse0,ralgha,2,Sun Jul 19 05:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't really have a reason to use it besides the fact that DCS used to love forgetting my keys.   My F-15 profile has it set so that anywhere under MIL power the backlight is off, at mil it goes to the lowest brightness, and in AB it brightens fully. I also have my slider set so that it will zoom in when pushed forward until you recenter it, and zoom out the same way. It's much better than having zoom set to the slider axis because with the profile the slider is always centered unless you are currently changing your zoom. Other than small things like that, it isn't really worth it but I still use it none the less."
hoggit,3dsse0,Schweehog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"I use TARGET Scripting a lot.  For games like IL2 and E:D it really enhances the game.  I use it some in DCS, especially with the WWII planes.  I just map what I want to the DCS defaults for the plane I want.  Just have to remember to load the TARGET profile before you execute DCS.    I think it is really convenient once you understand it.  Keep in mind you are basically going to learn how to script to use it's most interesting features.  But once you 'get it' you can do cool stuff.    For example, you know how the Coolie HAT allows you to shift in A-10C with a long press right or left?  You can do that same thing with any button/HAT. You can macro any keys, etc. Also adjust curves and tweak a axis.   One more amazing thing is layers.  You can have a shift key that allows you to move between layers.  Making your DMS Hat for example have two totally different functions based on if another key (say your stick paddle) is pressed.    It can make your controls overly complex quickly because you can easily double or triple your buttons functions, you probably want to map out what you have binded or you will never remember. I know some folks don't like the complexity but I personally enjoy having a lot of options."

You do need a good visible light filter though, I used 2 or 3 unexposed film layers I think (or was it exposed?). I cracked it out now and the only advantage I see now is that I don't need to close the blinds in mid day and my visible light filter is only 1 exposed film.  Removing the IR filter has its own share of issues like losing the focus and you gotta fiddle around with the zoom or file a piece of cd case to replace get the focus back.

The C is on ED's roadmap (Wags quietly mentioned it in a video a couple of years ago) but is not yet in active development (to the best of my knowledge).  I imagine once they release the Hornet, dev time for a module like the F-15C would drop pretty significantly since they've already done the serious legwork in developing a high fidelity radar (and the 15C doesn't have AG or mapping modes to worry about, even better!) and the PFM is already done.  The Mudhen was claimed by 2 unproven 3rd Parties, and it's likely we'll never see a release from either.  I can't comment on Razbam, but I own Iris' F-15E in FSX and despite looking nice, the systems modeling and especially the flight modelling are jokes.  Wasn't expecting anything good from them in DCS."

The people who this sort of thing actually matters to are not people who constantly need to be entertained by mindless footage, like the average content you can find on YouTube. People who care about DCS want to hear what wags is saying, and want a well directed interview. Not a garbage interview led by a host who can't focus on one thing because he's worried about losing a few viewers."

hoggit,3du1ii,Ermahgerd_Mervererks,12,Sun Jul 19 23:02:26 2015 UTC,"what am i supposed to do not play the game that hes talking about   Actually, yes. When doing an interview, your duty is not first and foremost to maintain the action for the sake of viewer count and paycheck, but to do a good interview for the people who are interested in what the interviewee has to say.  Pay attention to him, not the game he's associated with. Prepare or find some footage ahead of time to roll in the background, or at least a rolling selection of relevant screenshots to the interview questions or topics likely to come up. I realize these require some effort and pre-production instead of ""watch my twitch while I play a game and ask some questions and don't really focus on either"", but that's precisely what separates a good interview from the responses you're receiving here.  It isn't my job to give you production advice on how to do a proper interview, but you've got the above and I assure you an hour with google will give you countless more suggestions on how to better structure the presentation in ways that won't result in a waste of time for the interviewee and the viewers.  Alternatively, perhaps next time Wags does an interview, we can hope he picks someone who better respects his and the audience's time rather than making sure he's got action and explosions for a twitch viewer count."
hoggit,3du1ii,dontcensormebro1234,9,Mon Jul 20 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"My suggestion for if there happens to be a next time is to just view an air or ground battle as it plays out. Requires much less concentration and can still be interesting to viewers, as long as the volume is low enough to hear people. All you'd have to do is switch views occasionally. People still see action and you have your brain leftover for an interview."

hoggit,3dogn6,Sha-WING,2,Sat Jul 18 00:58:05 2015 UTC,Back when the UK had proper carriers this happened to a newbie pilot on first tour in the med. He could not get it on the deck at all and to run for a land base.  Ended up being cycled out of the FAA. Guess all the training in the world can't prepare you for the real thing. I imagine with VTOL planes it is easier as you have to park up along side then slide in and land.
hoggit,3dogn6,NotHyplon,2,Sat Jul 18 12:51:23 2015 UTC,"Vertical landers have their fair share of issues.  When I landed aboard the USS Iwo Jima via an Osprey, we had to do a wave off because the back left landing gear missed the deck and the bird started to fall off once enough weight was put on the gear.  This was only a few weeks after completing dunk training and the images of flipped helos quickly sinking into the ocean were still very fresh on our minds.  We had our breathing tubes firmly grasped.  But the moment after we felt the plane lean, the pilot whiskied those throttles and we shot back into the air and went around for another try.  Granted, still easier to recover than a standard landing, but definitely still isn't easy."

hoggit,3dmt48,jkure2,8,Fri Jul 17 15:25:35 2015 UTC,"Is my fuel gauge calibrated for only the tank, or is it my total fuel?   Short answer: total fuel.  Long answer: The fuel gauge in the MiG-21bis doesn't measure the fuel level in any tanks at all. It's set manually by the ground crew to however much they think they put in the plane, and counts down based on how much flows into the engine. If you drop tanks while there's still fuel in them, your gauge might end up reading more fuel than you actually have on board. So you need to use the lights telling you when various tanks are empty as kind of a double-check on the fuel quantity indication."
hoggit,3dmt48,Snoring_Eagle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"Huh, I didn't know that bit of info. Interesting! The green lights for drop tanks seems useful. Thanks for the response!"
hoggit,3dmt48,sniporbob,3,Fri Jul 17 18:02:54 2015 UTC,"Not turning on the radar means the RWR doesn't go off in the enemy airplane. Someone else will have to chime in whether or not that is beneficial against the AI. Against human opponents, most people are in the state of mind where if it doesn't show up on the RWR, it doesn't exist.  A gun run is optional. If you need to conserve missiles to fight your way back to base, use the gun. Otherwise just use a missile since the 21 runs out of fuel so quickly.  The fuel gauge is calibrated to show total fuel. Once the needle gets to approximately ""3"" your drop tank is empty. There is also a green indicator light that illuminates when the drop tank is empty. It is the uppermost light on one of the groups to the right of the fuel gauge. You'll usually see it blink a little bit before it illuminates steady. To be fuel efficient you can fly around at about 87%. You can stay up for well over an hour at that throttle setting.  A question for someone else who may know: does the Russian AWACS give their BRA in km?"
hoggit,3dmt48,sniporbob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the tips! My understanding based on research is that the Russian awacs gives bra in metric units, while American does imperial.   One other question, when is it appropriate to use the afterburner? Is there some kind of rule of thumb?"
hoggit,3dmt48,Jigglyandfullofjuice,2,Fri Jul 17 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"What Gos said is about right. I'll add that the 21 has 2 different afterburners. There's a switch ahead of the throttle that will enable the secondary afterburner. It adds several thousand pounds more thrust but is even more inefficient. When you're in a turning fight or when you REALLY need to climb or get somewhere fast you can use it, otherwise stick to the normal afterburner. Whether or not you use the afterburner is really dependent on the mission. If you're supposed to go intercept something quickly and then RTB or if you're trying to save someone in multiplayer, use the burner. If there is no urgency or if you're supposed to loiter then try to avoid using it."
hoggit,3dmt48,gospadinperoda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:06:11 2015 UTC,I did see somethimg about an emergency burner. If my irl throtle slider is maxed does that activate? Or do I have to hit the button?
hoggit,3dmt48,bipcopter,3,Fri Jul 17 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"You have to toggle it on in order to use it, and even then it only lights below a certain altitude. If you look on the main warning panel (right vertical, arranged in 2 columns) there's a light for when it comes on."

hoggit,3dmt48,MustardCosaNostra,3,Fri Jul 17 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he was responding to the radar lock.  Guns vs. missiles really depends on the situation.  The worst thing would be to spend extra time getting in close for a gun shot only to get blown up by a second bandit who is rushing in to defend the first plane.  To manage fuel effectively, avoid afterburner and stay relatively high.  Turbine engines use less fuel at higher altitudes.  Save your AB for when you're in a high AoA maneuver and need to maintain airspeed to keep your energy up, or for when you just need to hold speed in level flight above 10,000m.  For an intercept mission, however, where you need to get your altitude ASAP, burner for climb out is fine.  Whether or not to drop your bag is a function of the mission profile.  Never dogfight with your drop tank attached if you can avoid it, but there's little reason to drop your tank if you're just intercepting a slow moving bomber or something.  All other things being equal, command would prefer you bring back your drop tank, but they'd even more prefer you bring back the plane.  As to fuel readout, I don't know the mig-21 so can't answer that question.  A-10C has different fuel gauge settings so you can separately show fuel states from each source separately."

hoggit,3dmt48,miaig,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"Already a lot of good info here, so  I'll just add some info on landing.  I've been flying the Mig21 for awhile now so I have done my far share of bad landings.  The best way I think landing this thing is when you are on final you are at half flaps, when the red ""marker"" goes off which makes a dinging sound and shows a button in the cockpit labeled you guessed it ""marker"", go to full landing flaps. At this point you should still be high enough to see the entire runway...much easier to come in a little hot and high then low and can't see shit and slam the plane causing damage.  I'm usually around 400kmh-350kmh depending on  how much weight is still on the aircraft. Weight can really change how much throttle I put down when landing so you really have to pay attention to that when you are landing with bombs or without.  As you descend and you are coming closer and closer to the runway flare the aircraft, turn airbrakes on, and very slowly begin to decrease throttle.  Once you have landed with all wheels down release drag shoot.    This all sounds pretty easy, its not.  It takes some practice, but believe me I haven't had any issues at all now landing this aircraft and its still a blast to land b/c its so tricky.   One last thing I forgot, as you descend the plane to the runway you can trim the plane to keep the nose more level, this helps with not having to make large adjustments on your joystick and you can be much more precise."
hoggit,3dmt48,MustardCosaNostra,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"I saw someone call it a controlled crash one day- I agree with that guy. You can really feel the ground effect as you start to get closer. It feels counter intuitive to come in so hot for landing.  I'll try this, thanks!   Off topic, have there been any recorded instances of failed landing  parachute deployments?"
hoggit,3dmt48,stealthgunner385,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:41 2015 UTC,"-How do I manage fuel, and how do droptanks work?   That question was mostly covered already explaining the gauges and the vertical light panel left of the fuel guage. This is most for a centerline drop tank. The switch to jettison the centerline tank is actually on the front of the joystick and you will have to bind something to it.  The wing tanks, should you use them, are indicated present and empty on the equipment panel in front of the joystick in the center. They are jettisoned with the switch covered by the yellow rocket-ship looking thing on the front dash panel.  In my experience landing with full tanks is very difficult, the thing falls like a rock. But we're talking about being mostly full with both centerline and wing tanks. Its very weighty when thats going on."

Looking back on it, I think the only reason we took on what we did is because we were too inexperienced to know better. Knowing what I do now, even given my experience on Falcon, the cost to develop such an engine would be substantial.

hoggit,3dj3ha,KillerInYourCloset,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:50:40 2015 UTC,It's not necessary to calculate collisions for every object all the time in order to make every object collidable.  The standard solution is to break the world up into a hierarchy of colliders so you only have to check collisions against a relative handful of colliders each tick.  This can be done very efficiently.  The challenge is in managing the complexity such an approach incurs on the system and workflow as a whole.  One seeks the best practical balance of efficiency and complexity.  This is the kind of thing that tends to get better when rewriting or massively upgrading an engine.

hoggit,3dj3ha,KillerInYourCloset,2,Thu Jul 16 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"He should have said it is already there. Well you can't cleanup wrecks, but you sure as hell can despawn units. That said there is a ton of room for new scripting functions.   Depends on how its written and what your goal is. Using just the lua export it is possible to take position data on a given mission and then generate a new mission based on that data. Afterall the .miz file is just a zip archive with text files embedded within. In terms of real time, yes you can call scripting engine functions from outside the sim using external software. Case in point is DCS Witchcraft, which kind of acts as a 3d editor allowing you to manipulate the mission in real time via external software and see the results in game.    And I don't think it would be cool (or legal) to have any of the F4 campaign in DCS. We need our own, built with DCS in mind."
hoggit,3dj3ha,3sqn_Grimes,0,Thu Jul 16 23:33:31 2015 UTC,"Ok then, that's good. As for the F4 campaign... why not? legality wouldn't be an issue, Falcon 4 is public domain. I agree it would be great to have a DCS dynamic campaign engine... but that's an INSANELY ambitious project. Falcon 4 was built around the engine- it tooks years to make that, and it's been built upon for 15 years after it was released. I would love to see someone port that engine to native code for DCS."
hoggit,3dj3ha,KillerInYourCloset,4,Thu Jul 16 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"Falcon 4 is super duper not public domain. Let's just be clear about that. All of the fan-made patches/addons/overhauls that we all love are, technically, very much not legal.  We get away with it because I don't think even God knows who owns the rights to it anymore, and in all probability whoever does actually own the rights may not even know it either. And even if they did, they regard it as such a poor prospect for any sort of monetary recovery that they just don't give a damn to enforce it.  But that is not even remotely the same as saying it is public domain. The history of the creaking ancient beast that underpins BMS is so convoluted it is almost hilariously headache-inducing to try to follow it all, but I encourage you to start digging. The last thing it is, is public domain."

hoggit,3dj3ha,Teeter477,3,Thu Jul 16 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"Another rift related question, when can we see proper clickable cockpit support inside the rift? As the simpler cockpits like p51, bf109, fw190, mig15, f86 upto the su25 can all be flown pretty well by mapping the hotas, but when it comes to more complicated planes like the a10c, which require the manipulation of the mfd buttons using the mouse, it's not possible to fly using the dk2. This also hinders radio comms, for example, mig15 cannot call for the apu startup on any mission that requires taking off from the run away. The escape menu is also unusable inside the rift. So let's say missions that require you to select a plane to fly inside the inflight menu are unusable.   I ask because for me, it's impossible to play dcs on a 2d monitor now that I'm hooked on to the dk2 experience. I think if the clickable mouse is supported inside the rift, then i can imagine it won't be too big of a leap to make the mouse pointer use the oculus touch controller to actually flip switches using ur real hands. Although, using a hotas while using oculus touch seems implausible at the moment. But one can dream."
hoggit,3dj3ha,-shalimar-,2,Thu Jul 16 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"Huh.  I was able to click on stuff in the cockpit when I tried DCS with the DK2.  I flew the A-10C and used the MFD buttons and everything else.  Sometimes the actual clicked position was a little off to the side of the cursor, but with some fiddling it was manageable.  Head position/orientation can make a difference there."

The only time I haven't been able to use the mouse in the cockpit is when I escape out of the splash screen rather than clicking 'fly'.  The problem is when you lean in, the mouse cursor separates into two the closer to the panel you get and the actual click area is an invisible point between the two.  You probably could use the radio, but it would be a bit like having myopia, you have to spend some time leaning in and staring at the dial intently."

""locking on"" just means picking a point on a tanker and drawing imaginary horizontal/vertical line somewhere related to your cockpit and just holding it there.  for example you could try and hold tanker engine turbines at the same point in space related to your HUD."

hoggit,3djz0t,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sun Jul 19 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely vital that you fly off the tanker, not the boom. The Boom Operator will fly the boom into your jet, not the other way around.   It's also important that you call ""Ready Pre Contact"" within 1nm. He'll reply ""Cleared Contact"" indicating you can push in. The boom will 'Spring to life' when you're roughly 100ft out. You'll see it rise sharply, indicating the AI Boomer has taken control of the boom. It's now up to you to stay in formation with the tanker and let the boomer do his job.   The hardest part about flying any formation is being pre-emptive with your inputs. Get the aircraft trimmed perfectly before you make contact. (Baring in mind that the nose will raise with more speed) If you jerk down from a climb, the chances are you'll end up too low. Slow and gentle inputs are key. Input curves will help significantly.

hoggit,3dia4b,vortexnl,5,Thu Jul 16 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"Well SAM sites in DCS tend to always engage you at their maximum effective range, so regardless of what you do in those situations, the missile is out of energy and can't hit you as long as you just move out of the way. Try scripting the SA-8 to engage you at 4 miles instead of 9, and you'll have a much more difficult time."
hoggit,3dia4b,Milyardo,2,Thu Jul 16 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"The SA-8 is also not all that dangerous to the F-15C. It can easily outmanuever and outrun the missile if you react to the launch soon enough. But as Milyardo said, it will be more of a threat if it fires well within its effective range.    If you really want to practice dodging SAMs in the F-15C, you are going to want to do it against some SA-11 or SA-10 sites. The later being much more difficult. Although, at max range, as long as you turn away and run fast you should be safe. Or you can practice getting the missile on your 3/9 line and diving down to make it lose track.    In my experience, countermeasures in the F-15C are not really necessary against SAMs unless you are danger close to them. It is more about knowing how to burn their energy or make them lose track of you. Fighting against aircraft and using countermeasures is another story though.    You will find flares to be very effective when flying something slow like the A-10C or Su-25T. MANPADS have very short range and if you are within range, the missile is likely going to hit if you don't chop the throttle, evade, and dispense flares."
hoggit,3dia4b,SirR0BN,2,Thu Jul 16 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"For the A-10C, note that if there's multiple manpads/strelas, be careful about trading too much energy for the lower signature, as it may doom you to their followup shots if you don't have enough energy to get out of their engagement envelope quickly.

The Russian AA-12 Adder for instance is incredibly unlikely to be fooled by chaff (as is the AIM-120 for that matter). In those cases your only defense is a kinetic defense. Bleeding the missile of energy and then causing it to loose track. Terrain masking is also very useful against these types of missiles if you're low enough to do so.

Best way I found to burn them out is to fly perpendicular to them just and get just close enough for them to fire. What I do is dive at a -60 degree angle and watch the missile. As soon as I see the smoke trail disappear I wait a second or two then full burner back up all the while keeping it on my 3/9 line. I find the altitude that works best is between 15k and 20k feet.  Of course that's only used for showboating or pretending to be a Wild Weasel. :D

hoggit,3dgznj,ajac09,2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:37 2015 UTC,Wow. So how do you target all those different points at the same time?
hoggit,3dgznj,RumBox,3,Thu Jul 16 13:06:57 2015 UTC,"Easiest way with LGB is by making markpoints, turning laser on, drop load with a preset spacing and just cycle through the markpoints. The Radar will target those and the tgp is slewed to the radar. They need to be quite far apart. Even easier is having JDAMS fly on those different markpoint, since you specify the target on release, not mid-flight. Will you join the event starting 24th? :)"
hoggit,3dgznj,MrMinimal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:33:15 2015 UTC,"Hoping to, but I'm unsure whether I'll have time, and I'd need to get my controls un-fucked beforehand in any case, which can be difficult in BMS."

hoggit,3dgznj,MrMinimal,3,Fri Jul 17 12:10:30 2015 UTC,"What /u/MrMinimal said is spot on, although I'm surprised to hear it works with LGBs (I used GBU-31 JDAMs in the video). In the video here are the steps I did:  Set your ripple quantity to the number of bombs you want to release in total in a single pass. Set your impact spacing to something high. 500 ft spacing is about the minimum you'd want, and a higher number gives you more time to change steerpoints. Line up in CCRP on the first steerpoints and release like normal, but start cycling through the steerpoints as each successive weapon leaves the aircraft. Whichever steerpoint is active when a bomb releases is the steerpoint it will head towards."
hoggit,3dgznj,RumBox,2,Thu Jul 16 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see - so you just make a buttload of steerpoints in the briefing and cycle them as you fly over? Clever!"
hoggit,3dgznj,RumBox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"Precisely! In the video I set up steerpoints 9 - 16 on targets requiring two bombs, and 17 - 24 on targets requiring (I thought) one bomb. I simply hit the next steerpoint button on my joystick after the necessary number of bombs dropped on the target."
hoggit,3dgznj,MrMinimal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:41:35 2015 UTC,"I gotta try that. Of course, you could also just level the place with a giant stick of Mk 82, but this is still cooler."
hoggit,3dgznj,dokid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:47:45 2015 UTC,LGB works as long as the spacing is high enough and the targets are close enough together for the bomb to correct. Thanks for the mention btw :)
hoggit,3dgznj,MrMinimal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:33:52 2015 UTC,Does this work in DCS too? I'm familiar with dropping JDAMS on multiple targets but I thought LGBs were not capable of that (I assumed that the lazer can only guide one bomb to one target)
hoggit,3dgznj,funkybside,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:07:34 2015 UTC,"Works in DCS as well, same idea applies, either every bomb gets a different lase code or the targets are close enough. You are guiding two bombs at one target, but switch to another one before the second bomb impacts."

While Flaming Cliffs lack clickable cockpits, do keep in mind that learning the systems of an aircraft is the easy part.  It's learning, how to engage, when to engage and what to do once you've engaged a target that's the hard part.  For doing ground attack, I'd consider the A-10C.  Now that said, if you want fully clickable cockpits and you're training specifically for the F/A-18C that's eventually going to show up in DCS, I'd consider picking up a copy of Falcon BMS.  It's DCS F-16 in all but name. In many regards it fills the same roles as the F-18C and you'll find a lot of the knowledge of electronics and such transfer over to the F-18C as well."

If your just looking to get familiar with jets in general, and you're not looking to make too huge a leap, the F-86 or MiG-15 are excellent intermediaries and a joy to fly.  If you're looking for experience in systems management (MFDs and subpages for daaaaaays) and moving copious amounts of mud, the A-10 or even Falcon BMS is definitely the way to go.  If you're looking for experience flying supersonic fighters and BVR, FC3 is a whole bunch of fun, but the depth of their systems modelling is sorely lacking.

The Korean jets are interesting transitional options, true, but they're really, really different from modern aircraft that they're probably not the best preparation for the Hornet. Get them, by all means, as they're both a ton of fun, but don't expect there to be a lot of carryover into the F-18.  The -21 is one of my very favorite modules, for sure, and it's getting closer (a little) to the capabilities of the Hornet, but the avionics and handling are both vastly different, so it, also, probably isn't going to be the best training.  Personally, I'd do one of two things - if you want to stay in DCS, get the F-15 to get used to actually flying modern fast jets, and get the A-10 to practice modern-ish U.S. switchology in a forgiving, largely worry-free airframe. Otherwise, Falcon BMS, with its full-detail F-16C, is probably the closest you can get right now to the Hornet in a combat sim.  Good luck!"
hoggit,3dbtk2,Lordbaldur,2,Wed Jul 15 13:13:49 2015 UTC,"F-86 is the easiest, natural transition.

hoggit,3d9ej7,dolmaface,4,Tue Jul 14 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"The main issue isn't the helmet (it's roughly the same size as the current JHMCS; from the front: HMDS - JHMCS; from the side: HMDS - JHMCS); the main issue is that the pilot's headrest is something like 50% wider than the headrest you'd find in an F-16; supposedly ergonomic / physiological studies found it to be superior, but it means the pilot has to literally press his helmet against the canopy to see further around it."
hoggit,3d9ej7,Dragon029,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"There was a report where the pilot said he had problems looking behind the aircraft, and that the helmet displayed errors sometimes during hard maneuvers. It was the F-35 vs F-16 maneuverability/dogfight test report."
hoggit,3d9ej7,sniporbob,2,Tue Jul 14 20:22:48 2015 UTC,"My post above mentions the specific reason for the helmet being less mobile, but as for the errors, they should be fixed with the Generation III helmet; specifically, the pilot in the report was receiving a boresight alignment issue, because he was essentially moving the helmet around on his head - the gen 3 helmet adds a small camera to the dashboard which cross-references with the helmet cam to automatically and continuously update boresight alignment."
hoggit,3d9ej7,Dragon029,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"I took a look at the picture you provided. That sure is a large headrest!  I briefly reread the report and just now realized the other errors I was remembering (""INS DEGDs, SFD ATTITUDEs, and HDG DISAGREEs"") are probably unrelated to to the HMDS.  Glad to hear they found a way to work around the helmet boresight issue!"
hoggit,3d9ej7,sniporbob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:35:07 2015 UTC,Presumably they use something like TrackIR for head tracking but I never seen any cameras in the cockpit. Any idea where they are?
hoggit,3d9ej7,aPAZ5Jnc,6,Tue Jul 14 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"The HMDS (and JHMCS on newer F/A-18s, F-15s, F-16s, etc) use magnetic field tracking - it gives you faster refresh rates than using cameras, but it (at least used to) have the negative of requiring a ~30 minute calibration process if the cockpit is modified (I don't know what the threshold is, but it wouldn't be super low, unless guys are doing the calibration before each time they fly with a GoPro in there, etc).  The Generation 3 version of the HMDS has a small camera on the cockpit dashboard, which they use to automatically and constantly update the boresight of the helmet (the cameras in the helmet mentioned in the video have their video feed cross-referenced with what the camera on the dashboard sees, and from that, they can prevent the 3D magnetic compass from drifting).  There are other helmet tracking systems that use cameras and markers on the helmet (similar to TrackIR), but they're somewhat new and could potentially have limitations caused by the bright external IR sources, etc."
hoggit,3d9ej7,Dragon029,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:06 2015 UTC,"Complete guess here, but they might be using gyros instead of point tracking. Like EDTracker. Since the helmet image is (should be) collimated at optical infinity, you wouldn't need any translational tracking because any necessary changes to the display would be so small that they're irrelevant. You'd only need to track rotation.  Edit: Dragon029 to the rescue."

I mean I get it, the Major is towing the line...but nothing he said there made me feel warm and fuzzy. It just reinforced in my mind that the F-35 is relying way too much on technology and not enough on lessons learned in air combat over the last 100 years. Maybe 90% of the time the F-35 will work as advertised, but what about the other 10%?"
hoggit,3d9ej7,Brainling,9,Tue Jul 14 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"The issue though is that you can extend this logic to any other piece of technology. Suppose that the HUD only works 90% of the time, but what about the other 10%? How about the EO system? On the A-10, you need it to target most Maverick shots and all types of bomb, but it's also fairly high tech.  I think that it's better to rely on the technology to the extent that the technology has demonstrated itself to be reliable. Systems like the HMD aren't going to be very easy to defeat through mechanisms that will leave much else on the aircraft functional, so the only real risk factors for a HMD failure are internal. Furthermore, it's fallacious to pull random percentages out of thin air - you can build very reliable pieces of technology (ex HUD etc). As such, it should be sufficient to see how well it's worked in testing, which, according to this article, seems to be pretty well."

In short; then you win the war with a ~10:1 kill/loss ratio.  Nobody expects the stealth and BVR combat to work 100% of the time; the primary goal is just to be the guy on top. Yes it'll suck when pilots get shot down, but that's the reality of war, and if you wanted something even greater, you just simply need to fork out for a fleet of Super Raptors or something else insanely expensive."

If you have someone behind you it's not a ""oh ok let's fight"". It's a situation where you must do everything you can to get out of there alive, shooting the other guy down is not the priority.

Dogfights only happen when both participants want to engage(for whatever reason).   United States Air Force studies in the wake of the Vietnam War (the most famous being the Red Baron study) indicated that 80 percent of the pilots killed never knew that they were a target until their killer opened fire. Hartmann[all-time kills leader with 352 in World War II] estimated that a similar percentage of his victims never knew he was there until he opened fire   http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles2005/2005630167.asp  Seriously, dogfights are a massive myth, that's not how most of Aerial combat has ever happened and that's how you died, even Aces knew this, you get tangled up in a 1v1 and you fall prey to someone else. Aces stayed high and surprise attacked opponents then got the fuck out of dodge, then repeated that tactic.   “In any practice engagement I have had in the last 20 years where I have turned with another aeroplane in a bigger picture environment – rather than the static one by ones, two by twos or four by fours – every time I have tried to do that I have ended up being shot by somebody else who actually is not in the fight. As soon as you enter a turning fight, your situational awareness actually shrinks down because the only thing you can be operating with is the aeroplane you are turning with. The person who has the advantage is the person who can stand off, watch the engagement and just pick you off at the time. So you got to be really careful about how you use those KPIs.” – Air Marshal Brown"

And of course, being a FBW aircraft means that if you lost (eg) an entire elevator the jet would just adjust how it uses the other control surfaces in order to provide control.

The fact that you are arguing some minor issue in the airframe design in the face of my greater argument is indicative of what led us to this particular boondoggle.  Really my opinions on the aircraft's capabilities are my own, and are worth, well whatever you think my opinions worth.

The $400,000 pricetag on these things primarily goes into tight tolerances, high-grade materials and redundant components, etc.   Either way, if the helmet breaks, they can still do everything from their cockpit display; for example, they can have a tactical map up, see what ID the computer, etc has marked the enemy with, then give voice commands (or if that doesn't work as well, use your HOTAS controls) to target that jet and launch an AMRAAM, etc.  The cockpit display is also redundant, with each half of it actually being a separate monitor powered by a separate computer.

hoggit,3d9ej7,TankerD18,4,Tue Jul 14 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"I know; I was just speaking rhetorically there, but the point is just simply that if the argument for simplicity is repeatedly made, you do eventually get back to the basis of aviation (eg; 'why not keep the HUD in case the helmet breaks?' -> 'why not use a projected gunsight in case the HUD computer breaks?' -> 'why not use an ironsight in case the glass breaks?').  Simplicity does definitely have it's uses in preventing information and task overload, etc, but in some cases it just decreases performance (eg; the HUD partly limiting the pilot's view or creating additional complexity if they try to have both the HUD and HMDS)."
hoggit,3d9ej7,Dragon029,2,Tue Jul 14 20:32:11 2015 UTC,"This is (usually) true but only when talking about comparable technologies. If I were given a choice between a jackhammer with 5 moving parts vs a jackhammer with 150 moving parts, I'd probably go with he simpler one since fewer things could break. However, if I were riding a hot air balloon and armed with a bow and arrow, I don't think I would want to enter into a dogfight against an F-22. That's a bit of an extreme example, but there is some validity to it.  I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with the idea of making the helmet the HUD. It's really not that different from a fixed HUD anyway. Normally for a fixed hud you have an image projector, some lenses to collimate the image, and a piece of coated glass designed to reflect the light coming from the projector towards the pilot. The F-35 helmet has the same system, it's just smaller and built into the helmet instead of the airplane. The only part that might be problematic is that the helmet has to display data in relation to where your head is turned. Other aircraft already have helmet mounted displays though, so there shouldn't be any major problems.  Of course, reading the pilot report, he said there were lots of software errors beig displayed during hard maneuvers. That's definitely a problem. The actual implementation undoubtedly needs work, and it's one of the reasons I'm not a fan of the F-35, but the idea behind it is a good one."

Display them on your screen. As youve seen, that just looks retarded and defeats the purpose of the app.  Install a driver for a virtual monitor. This is actually found on the incontrol website in the FAQS page. The driver basically tricks your computer into thinking there is a second monitor. You then move the mfcds and cdu outputs off your screen onto the fake monitor and voila. The link provided in the FAQ section walks you through the process, its pretty easy.

A similar scenario in DCS World 1 would typically bring my system to its knees the minute a plane started firing his guns, especially if all those planes were within visual range. To my surprise, I saw that the framerate was butter smooth. ""  This makes me so happy. I love flying the old WWII birds, but the P-51 guns bring my frames down for 60 to naff all some times.

hoggit,3d59rh,Chuck_Owl,3,Mon Jul 13 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"Brilliant article! Since you've seen it in action, how does the enlargement system work? Does it only kick in when the plane is a single pixel and replace it with a sprite? Or does it intervene earlier, kind of rolling in smoothly so you don't have an effect where a plane vanishes to a single pixel, then reappears a little farther away as a sprite?  It also looked like aircraft visibility was better all around, like everything was just sharper and in better focus. Is that what you experienced in-game?"
hoggit,3d59rh,Thuraash,3,Tue Jul 14 02:10:33 2015 UTC,"The transition seemed smoother to me than it was in DCS 1. And yes, my experience regarding aircraft visibility is pretty close to what you mentioned."

hoggit,3d59rh,Chuck_Owl,8,Tue Jul 14 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"A new “Enlarge” setting in the game Options allowed me to see enemy fighters with a clarity that simply blew me away. Not only could I spot planes easier at long ranges, but I could also clearly distinguish its silhouette without having to zoom or change my field of view.  Thankfully, Eagle Dynamics listened to the community’s feedback and after a couple of sessions, I found out that trying to spot a target in a Mustang with the improved DCS World 2 visibility is nothing short of a complete game-changer. I always had terrible vision, but even I could spot dots from almost twice as far away. At least that’s the impression I got. I didn’t even feel the need to use the zoom in/out button anymore: it’s just that good.   Literally the only thing I care about in DCS World 2.  I'm surprised to hear that he says he can see silhouettes further. Wags always describes the system as a dot system and very adamantly not scaling. You wouldn't see silhouettes with dots, which makes me wonder what else is going on. Maybe the dots are actually 2D silhouettes of the planes they represent."

hoggit,3d59rh,Why485,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:03 2015 UTC,I'm guessing this was a case of someone's brain seeing more than their eye was actually showing them.
hoggit,3d59rh,MrWoohoo,2,Mon Jul 13 19:01:30 2015 UTC,"Another possibility is that the lighting improvements make planes easier to see even without the visibility settings. In DCS right now, because the contrast is so low between planes and... everything really, they can blend into the background very easily."
hoggit,3d59rh,Why485,2,Mon Jul 13 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"That could be it too. More likely, in fact. In any case I'm crossing my fingers it's released soon."
hoggit,3d59rh,MrWoohoo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"You misunderstood the dot system.  When the enemy plane is a single pixel, a silhouette will replace that dot then grow or shrink depending on whether or not you get closer of farther."

That sense of immersion though - wow.  Of course not worth getting one now, what with the Vive in a couple of months and the commercial version in the first quarter of next year with the improved display.
