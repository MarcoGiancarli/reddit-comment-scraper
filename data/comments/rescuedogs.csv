My dog was male-skittish and that's what my fiancé did. Now they're best buds. This won't help with all females but it's a start. We usually give any guy friends who come to our house a treat to give her so she'll start to like them.  As for meeting the other dogs, have them meet somewhere new/not at the house. Our dog is great when meeting other dogs in neutral territory but terrible is if it's somewhere she thinks is hers. If it's neutral and she gets along well it should be relatively smooth. Then you can have them meet again at the house and it will likely go more smoothly."
rescuedogs,3e7iab,maribellee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"My best advice would be to get her into a regular routine soon and give her time to warm up to you. My dog is also very skittish of people and dogs, so I always warn people that she is shy so that they don't aggressively try to pet her; if she backs away, she's doesn't trust that person enough to let them pet her. And it may take longer than you think for her to fully adjust; my dog wouldn't play with her toys if I was in the room until I had her for over 4 months.  As far as introducing her to your other dogs, I would recommend you letting her check the place out before meeting the dogs if you can. Then let her greet the dogs individually so she doesn't feel overwhelmed."

rescuedogs,3e3fzw,MsInternet,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"Without knowing the specific organization, this can very a ton. The organization I'm part of is 100% volunteer. So it depends on each volunteer's work/life at the time. And how much research we do on you can be another variable (adoption black lists, vet confirmation, etc.)  Two weeks isn't unheard of in my organization, but again. It is different per rescue."
rescuedogs,3e3fzw,PolarBill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm fairly sure its completely volunteer, with only about 6 or 7 volunteers. I just worry because a couple people I know have had trouble rescuing a dog, because the rescue was very picky and didn't really give them a chance. I don't see any reason they would dislike anything about me, I'm a groomer who makes very decent money, there's another adult in the household, there is a big yard and a doggie door, plenty of toys, and I buy my current dog the best food you can buy, which I would do the same for the new dog. Do you think it would be annoying to email again, or should I leave them be and wait patiently? I'm a little worried they will forget about me."
rescuedogs,3e3fzw,PolarBill,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:27 2015 UTC,"Besides what /u/designgoddess already mentioned, if you do email them try and keep it ... umm ... not crazy. I've had people hounding every day for my specific foster as they went through the vetting process. Being excited about a dog is one thing, but being overly obsessive is a reason for me to think twice. That doesn't sound like your case here, but it is easy to miss-read an email and get the wrong emotions."

My business partner just adopted a dog from a breed specific rescue. It took them a couple of weeks to get back to him and another 2-3 weeks to approve him. If you haven't heard back in two weeks I'd send another email. You can also ask to be pre-approved. So, you have everything done before the next dog comes along. It should go faster that way. Good luck and thanks for adopting."

rescuedogs,3e3fzw,mm0k,2,Tue Jul 21 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"For the most part, rescues are much more through than shelters when it comes to matching dogs with new forever homes.  It is very important that the dog be a right fit for the new owner, the whole point is this dog is going in to a forever home, so it is very important to make sure each potential new owner is properly evaluated and properly matched. Along with home visits, this process takes a while depending on how many volunteers they have.  For me, it took 6 months from application to adoption. This is primarily because I needed a dog to fit my lifestyle.  She comes into the office with my every day and it would be a very poor fit if she was territorial or not comfortable around office hustle-bustle, new people or other dogs.  The rescue took this in to account and passed up several adoptable dogs because of this.    But it was the right way to do it.  My rescue is the perfect office mascot.  I am glad I waited or else I never would have found her."

rescuedogs,3dwuqs,Virgowitch,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:29 2015 UTC,"To me a growl isn't only a sign of agression, it's his way to tell you that he's not comfortable with the situation. If it's not pain, he might have had a traumatic experience that involved him being touched there. He might not have been socialized as a puppy now so touching those areas are stressful. Like some dogs are when their feet are touched.   Your vet should be able to recommend a good behaviorist who can help you properly desensitize him to being touched. I have a couple of found dogs who did not have a good start to life. I err on the side of caution and bring in the best when it comes to my special boys. Sometimes you don't second chance on fixing an issue, so do it right the first time.   edit:words"
rescuedogs,3dwuqs,designgoddess,2,Mon Jul 20 05:24:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with everything you said. I don't think he's aggressive, just unsocialized. He was terrified of being in a house, not house trained, didn't know how to take a treat from a hand, etc. Unfortunately, the only reputable, actually trained behaviorist around here moved away. I'm working on finding another one, but meanwhile, I don't want to just avoid upsetting him. He needs groomed, bathed, examined, etc. Well, bathing may be an issue. You've never seen a dog avoid something l like he avoids a hose. Strong son of a bitch. Good thing we're big dog people... Thank you so much for your insights. You think like I do."

rescuedogs,3bvtgh,OgityBogityBoo,3,Thu Jul 2 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"If you weren't already planning on waiting until you are settled in your new place before getting the dog, I'd suggest it.  That way if you are renting and the place has specifications (weight limit, pet deposit, etc.) you'll know that in advance.  The dog I adopted through my local humane society had been in a foster home for a while, and she has been the easiest dog to transition home.  A lot of that is her age and personality- we were specifically looking for a calm adult dog.  An advantage of getting a dog that has been fostered is they know a lot about the dog and the dog is used to living in a home.  The foster can be a great help those first few days if you have questions.  Whether you adopt from a rescue group, a kill shelter, or a no-kill shelter you are providing a home for one dog and opening a space for another.  I would suggest focusing on finding a dog that fits your lifestyle!"
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,WeavesByNightAndDay,2,Thu Jul 2 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"Adopting a dog is a really awesome choice. You save a dog, and usually the fee is low but the dog has shots and had been spayed/neutered. Puppies, if you go that route, come with vouchers to spay/neuter at some places here, or refunded fees. I think that no matter what kind of shelter you adopt from, that place gets more room. Some no-kill rescues adopt from kill shelters to give animals longer time to find homes.   When we adopted, we ended up getting a dog who had been fostered. It wasn't a plan we had, but it was really great because we found that they were able to answer a lot of questions we had about the dog and they generally seem to know a lot more about the dog's personality. Some dogs are a lot more scared/shy when in kennels and staff at the shelter should be able to tell you about the dog when he's out in play groups.  Our dog is a sweetheart. He is shy and especially shy of men but he's even warming up to my boyfriend, who is a tall guy with a deep voice. He was a stray pick up so we don't know much about his history. He was house trained and had few accidents - he learned to break out of his crate and pottied then, but aside from that he'll walk to us and then to the door to ask to go out. He had parasites but we got them cleared up at the vet. He didn't know how to play with dog toys, but it's been rewarding to teach him."
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,strozissocold,2,Thu Jul 2 17:11:35 2015 UTC,"Look in your area for rescue groups who are looking for foster homes. It gives you at least a bit of an idea about the dog and if they'd be a good match. Keep in mind it can take a dog a bit to settle in, but I highly recommend it. I fostered a little shih tzu who had separation anxiety, then a collie mix who I just finalized the adoption for. We couldn't pass her up after we discovered she was sweet, laid back, already had some obedience training, and was already potty-trained. It gives you the benefit of a ""test run"" and also gets the dog out of a shelter and into a home."
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,FallnOct,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:01:16 2015 UTC,"I've rescued (off of the street, actually rescuing), adopted, fostered, and gasp bought (one) dogs. I won't buy a dog again. It was expensive but he is a beautiful dog. Looks like I wanted but his personality can be a bit much at times. He's the last dog I think I'll ever buy. I got him from a reputable pet store, the owner had visited the breeder and also had a dog from them. For the record, I tried to adopt for about 7 months but we lived in an apartment so were turned down for a 15 lb dog by all the rescues that had what we were looking for.  Finding a rescue dog can be a tough job if you don't know what you are looking for. My adopted dog took two weeks to come up and sniff me. He still isn't normal and he's 2 years old. He's getting better with strangers but had a very rough puppyhood. The rescue wasn't forthcoming about how bad off they were. We love him and wouldn't trade him for the world but it's been a bumpy road. Adopting from a no-kill shelter gives that kill shelter a new spot for a dog, just as it does with a kill shelter. Most no-kill shelters pull from high-kill shelters.   How much disposable income do you have and how much time? A lot of times you can find purebred rescues. People are actually more likely to buy a purebred as a ""throwaway"" dog, then they go to shelters. What kind of place will you be living in? House, apartment, yard or no yard? That can determine if rescues will adopt to you but a lot of kill shelters are not as picky. All of the shelters in my area can do breed alerts from their website. You put in what breed you are looking for and they will email you when they get one in.   Feel free to ask me any questions you have."
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,BigCityDwight,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"Congrats!! I've been in the same boat. I moved out almost a year ago, away from my parents and pups and it's been tough! I would highly recommend adopting rather than buying a pup because you're saving the lives of 2 dogs (your own, and the dog who will be filling their spot!).  My boyfriend and I have been actively trying to adopt for a few months now, and I had my heart set on an australian cattle dog, since my family has adopted 2 in the past few years. They're incredibly loveable and intelligent dogs! We tried adopting through rescue sites online, but had no luck. We would frequent our local SPCA almost weekly it seemed until we stumbled upon this cutie!.  We had inquired about so many dogs from rescues both local and semi-local (they covered multiple states, and we were one of them). We always seemed to be not good enough for any of their dogs for really obscure reasons. My advice would be to frequent your local shelters (SPCA, city shelters, etc) and just interact with some of the dogs there! There's no doubt you'll fall in love with many of the dogs there! If you're looking for a specific breed, there may be a program at the shelter that will ""reserve"" a dog of that breed for you when it is taken in, before it goes up for public adoption. There's a fee involved of course (At least at our SPCA there was!), but some of it is applied to the adoption. We didn't go this route, and just would constantly visit their website and physical shelter.  Shelters are a lot less picky and stringent on adoption conditions than rescues are. Rescues do offer breed specialties, but we just had more luck with shelters in actually getting a dog! You fall in love over and over with dogs from the rescues just to be told last minute they adopted the dog to someone else! It was pretty heart-breaking!  Don't give up if you get rejected for a while. You will find your new fur-baby! Good luck!"
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,puppycat19,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:43:03 2015 UTC,"We found both our rescues from petfinder.com a great site that links all rescue organizations and you can select size, breed, age ( please consider an older dog), etc. This site is for Canada & the US. I like that with our rescues, first one was ten and lived another 3.5 years and our new guy who is 6 or 7 yrs have great temperaments. Be true to your lifestyle, we are not runners, big outdoors people so we got a French/English Bulldog mix and now have a small long haired Chihuahua & small dog mix ( rescue doesn't know his other half). Great for our condo and local easy walks 4* per day:) Good Luck!"
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,JunctionDweller,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:41:55 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm an adoptions counselor at an animal shelter. I think I can help here.   With regard to breed preferences: Know that, unless the person that brought the animal to us also brought its AKC papers, we can't make any kind of guarantee as to what breed the dog is. At my shelter, the only reason we even try to identify dog breeds is because the computer system we use requires a breed in order to store the animal's record. We make guesses based 100% on what the animal looks like, and some of the dogs I've seen come through, I wouldn't be surprised if someone threw a dart at a poster of dog breeds and picked whichever one they hit. The best way to go about adopting a dog from a shelter is to visit the shelter and talk to the people that work there. We spend all day, every day with these animals; it's our job to know them, so if you tell us a few things about your home, family, lifestyle and general daily routine, we can help you find a good match. It may take multiple visits, so come prepared to adopt but don't necessarily expect to leave with a dog on any given visit, if that makes sense.  Also, do your homework - everybody and their mom has a website nowadays, so check the shelter's website to find out what the fees are and what materials you'll need to bring with you in order to adopt. You might need some combination of valid government-issued ID (driver's license, CDL, state ID, passport, military ID are all generally acceptable), proof of address (especially as you're moving soon, since the address on your driver's license won't be your actual residence), references if necessary, a copy of your lease or HOA/COA agreement if applicable, and a leash and collar if the shelter requires you to provide your own. My shelter has an on-site pet shop with basics like that, but we do require adopters to either provide or purchase their own collars and leashes. You can also call the shelter and ask. Kill vs. no kill: I think the idea you have in your head of a ""kill shelter"" is misleading. Giving your money to a ""kill shelter"" doesn't encourage them to kill more animals - in fact, it does exactly the opposite. Kill shelters have to euthanize animals because their funding allows them to care for a given animal for X length of time. When time runs out, so does the money, and, well, you don't have to feed a dead dog. I can't speak for other places, but to give you an idea, it costs my shelter about $15-20 per day to care for an animal, including the cost of its daily food and water allotment, keeping the lights and A/C on in the kennels (all-indoor, I know some shelters have outdoor dog kennels), labor costs for time spent cleaning the kennels (about 4 hours/day) and walking the dogs (about 3 hours/day per dog), and any medication the animal might be on or medical attention it may require. If your jurisdiction requires pets to be sterilized, the shelter most likely has an in-house veterinarian that performs the spay and neuter surgeries; my shelter (not-for-profit) also performs surgeries for owned pets, and charges about $50 for a cat and about $200 for a dog depending on size, to give you an idea of the materials and labor costs there. At the end of the day, all the animals in the shelter need rescuing, but adopting a dog from a kill shelter is rescuing an animal far more in need than one from a no-kill shelter. Of course, many ""no kill"" shelters simply transfer out animals that they can no longer afford to care for - the euthanasia doesn't happen at their facility, therefore they can claim ""no kill"" status. My shelter doesn't call itself a ""no kill,"" as we do euthanize, but for quality of life (severe injury or illness that doesn't improve with treatment) or public safety (intractable offensive aggression that doesn't improve with training and socialization) reasons, not because an animal has been here X days or because we're out of kennel space or because it's a pit bull.    Sorry for the novel, but I hope something in here is helpful and feel free to ask any other questions you might have about rescuing :)"
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,tehzephyrsong,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"As someone has already stated, adopting from a ""kill-shelter"" doesn't support it continuing to be a kill shelter.  I volunteer at a kill shelter because that is where I feel the most needed.  We euthanize animals when we run out of space. So, If you adopt from a place like us, we don't euthanize as many Animals.  Animals at no-kill shelters are safer while kill-shelter dogs are always on death row."
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,dmbassett0221,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"We have just adopted a dog. Unlike you we weren't dog people so had no real idea about training etc. We got a more mature dog, 6 years old, and incredible patient. That is perfect for us. She was house trained, and so calm. No mad puppy stuff, ruining the furniture etc.  She had been in the shelter a long time as everyone wants a new lovely little puppy, but a mature sensible dog was perfect for us.  I didn't know anything about dogs 3 weeks ago, I still don't, but I do know I have seen her become more confident and happy.  It is clear in her body language and actions.  My son was walking the dog tonight on his own, some people passed him and commented on what a well behaved dog he was calmly walking alongside and not pulling away.  All totally due to the dog's personality and nothing to do with us.  So, get a dog with the personality you are looking for. Our's wont run and chase a ball, but she will walk nicely and behave."
rescuedogs,3bvtgh,M261JB,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:48:40 2015 UTC,"As someone who is part of a team that runs a dog rescue, I can say the advice to wait until you're settled in is very good advice.  When looking for a rescue dog (or any pet) a lot of people decide they have ""fallen in love"" with the animal purely based on looks.  Don't go by a picture and don't let yourself get so invested in a particular dog based on a picture or appearance.  Personality, temperament and fit into your lifestyle is what matters most.  Be honest with yourself and your schedule.  Puppies are cute but they are A LOT of work.  If you work outside the home, a young puppy that needs to go out every 2-3 hours to facilitate house training probably isn't for you. BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF and the rescue. If you want a ""puppy"" but you don't have time for a young one, get a puppy that's closer to adulthood (9 months +) or a young adult. http://tlcrescuepa.com/adopt/choosing-the-right-dog-for-your-family/  No-kill vs Kill shelters: dirty secret of ""no kill""  no kill means you euthanize < 15% of your intakes.  Some no kill shelters skew their stats by only including animals that they officially put ""on the floor"" to be adopted and not the ones who were sick or were being watched to determine if adoptable or not.  MORE IMPORTANTLY: ""kill"" shelters are always open access shelters that must take any stray, animal dumped, animal brought in by animal control.  ""no kill"" shelters turn animals away and/or have agreements with local open access ""kill"" shelter to take any animal they don't want and/or don't think they can adopt out.  Most kill shelters network like hell with rescues to get the adoptable animals into rescue if they cannot find an adopter.  Most reputable rescues pull adoptable animals from the euthanasia lists of kill shelters.  We've pulled quite a few off put to sleep lists that have been accepted into programs to be trained as service/therapy dogs (we work with some local orgs who assess & train the dogs and if one of our dogs is a good fit for one of their clients, we waive the adoption fee).  If possible, adopt locally.  If you live near NYC, don't adopt in Philly - there are loads of great dogs put down daily in manhattan shelters.  If you live in the south, know northern rescues generally pull from a mix of local shelters and southern ones because there are so very many great dogs in high kill southern shelters.  I'm mortified when we get an application for a coonhound from someone in a southern state; I don't know why people in New England (where there are few dogs in rescue/shelter) often bypass NY shelters and drive the extra distance to adopt from us (we do encourage them looking closer to home unless we have a dog of a breed that is uncommon in rescue).  We have also come across dogs posted on petfinder/adopt a pet, etc. that are posted as available via multiple different organizations in different states/cities.   Sometimes those dogs are listed at XYZ rescue in a local foster in a certain place as oart of XYZ rescue and sometimes there's a different rescue name.  That dog cannot be in multiple different cities & states at the same time or offered through multiple organizations at the same time.  Orgs that do this are finding ways to avoid following local regulations and my guess is these dogs are not traveling with appropriate vetting/health certificates. If you're dealing with a rescue instead of a shelter, check to see that the local rescue has public meet & greets where they bring some of their dogs and volunteers to meet the public.  Make sure you can go inside the building/house where they conduct any adoption appointments (if they only do the meeting outside in a driveway or they have a facility but don't let you in the building, that's a red flag).  Look to work with a rescue that has an application process and doesn't just approve you that day to take the dog home immediately - you don't want to make an impulse decision.  Sadly, not all people in rescue think about the animal or how good the match is as the top priority so run if: the rescue uses pressure tactics to get you to adopt, especially if it's to take a particular dog; if they ask for you to pay a fee to apply or to meet a dog; do not require you and your family (the people living with you and any resident dogs) to meet the dog you want to adopt prior to making the commitment to adopt. We schedule private appointments where our adopters and their families can meet & spend some time with the dog (or dogs they are considering) to see if the dog is a good fit for their family.  As part of our application process, we spend a good deal of time asking the applicant about their scheduled, their dog experience, what qualities they're looking for in a dog, etc. because we want to make sure it's a mutual match. Check out what kind of support they provide after the adoption is complete. If they say they have trainers/behaviorists to support you, ask them to provide info on the education and any certification their trainers have or are working on.  They should gladly provide that information. Don't always believe what you read on facebook as there are many groups making a lot of money by portraying themselves as heroes - some don't respond to or delete questions they don't want to address, some have groupies that have created a cult-like mindset to support that group.   If they say they are a charity/nonprofit - check out if they have a 501c3 and/or are registered as one in their state.  Some will say they incorporated as a not for profit but never followed up with any other filings and are functioning as a for profit  (mind you, that doesn't mean all nonprofits are above reproach).  You want to work with a group that you feel will support you and your new dog as you acclimate to each other - especially since this is the first dog you and your gf will have together and be fully responsible for.

rescuedogs,3btnpk,M261JB,4,Thu Jul 2 01:35:04 2015 UTC,One of our dogs is not big on food based reinforcement. We instead train mostly based on praise and positive physical contact (petting and snuggling).
rescuedogs,3btnpk,dzsquared,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:25:31 2015 UTC,"My mom had a dog like that - it was more the novelty it found interesting, so each treat had a limited effect.

A stuffie, hugs, verbal praise, getting to sniff the grass on a walk - if you find what your dog considers rewarding you can make it the reward for actions."

rescuedogs,3btnpk,MoHouse420,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:02 2015 UTC,"Dogs are notoriously driven by food or play.  Many rescues find that after living in a stable environment that they eat regularly and no longer have to struggle for food.  This can sometimes lead to lower food drive.  Many times I tell clients to try and work on other drive or desires they see in their dog to help with training. Rope toys are great for building toy drive.  Then the toy becomes the tool for training.  There is another point to bring out here that many times a rescue dog is no longer a puppy when adopted.  When I work with dogs, if it is under 2 years old the food drive is still pretty strong.  After about the 2 year mark dogs tend to not feel the food drive as much (as they are fully grown) and tend to turn towards toys for reward.    Please let me know if I can help by elaborating further on these points."

I believe she may have been abused by her previous owner because she flinches and can become quite anxious. I want her to find a forever home with a person/family who can fully provide for her emotionally.   She has all her shots and is chipped but needs to be spayed. She seems to work well with smaller dogs and typically works well with children and toddlers (I have not seen her do otherwise). She can not be with cats--a cat smacked her in the face once and she's been aggressive with them since. She's very affectionate and loving--one of her favorite things to do is huddle under the covers in the morning.   Property must be fenced and she requires outdoor play as she is a energetic breed. She thrives on being pet and pampered.  Interview is required. Please PM or comment if interested. Pick-up or drop-off could be arranged. We're located in Greensboro.

rescuedogs,3bgp7l,genghiskhannie,8,Mon Jun 29 01:53:33 2015 UTC,"I stopped reading after the first few lines because this is so poorly written and is, for lack of a better term, full of shit.  Couple quick things right off the bat: NKLA's adoption numbers have nothing to do with city shelter occupancy. It's not NKLA's fault that people are stupid and heartless and support puppy mills only to turn them over to shelters. They are doing really well in getting dogs out and into homes, and part of that process is selecting dogs that have high chances of being adopted from rescues. It's only logical.  Second, I urge people to actually visit NKLA's adoption center. I've been there multiple times, and you know what I see there the most? Pit bulls.   I don't know why the author has an issue with NKLA, but get this kind of shit out of here."
rescuedogs,3bgp7l,wilsun,6,Mon Jun 29 06:09:49 2015 UTC,"So many people in LA have a shitty attitude about NKLA because they have a bunch of rules that they have to abide by because they took over the Mission Hills shelter as their SoCal base.  No they can't pull from LA County, only city.  People think they only pull puppies, which isn't true.  Also, people are spreading (false) rumors that NKLA pulls puppies without the mothers, when in the instances they have done that they have gone back for the mother or it was already spoken for.    Another reason is because of the Pup My Ride program that takes dogs under 2 years old to the Humane Society in Oregon where they currently have something like a 98% adoption rate.  People assume they are shipping puppies to out of state rescues when in reality they are sending younger dogs to a shelter that doesn't have a lot of them and is extremely low kill in the first place.    People here have no problem bagging on NKLA when it doesn't help them personally.  The rescue community in LA can seriously suck sometimes."

I was there to adopt my dog. I live where there's unfortunately a pit bull ban. And you know what? It was DIFFICULT for me to find a dog that wasn't a pit bull (not that I have anything against them - I actually love them - it just wouldn't be right to adopt a dog at risk of being 'confiscated' by law enforcement - ugh, so sad!). It seems to be that Best Friends goes out of their way to grab pit bulls and dogs with behavioral issues from LA's city shelters."
rescuedogs,3bgp7l,kmanna,2,Mon Jul 6 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"As someone who volunteered at a shelter in LA this is just completely untrue. Yes there's still euthanasia, but it's slowly going down each year. And like someone else said, NKLA can't predict how many assholes are going to move or have a baby and dump their animal in the process.   But I can tell you every time NKLA got an animal adopted or had an adoption event it meant some of our kennels would be empty the next night and that is amazing."
rescuedogs,3bgp7l,theeburr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"This article points out all of the in-fighting, jealousy and distrust in the volunteer community. It is sad that people can't come together, recognize the insanely difficult challenges of overpopulation and work solely for the animals.   There are so many factors associated with reducing kill rates, including:   real education and cultural shifts in demographics that don't know about proper animal care massive free spay/neuter programs in communities where affordability is an issue a shift in volunteer mentality towards helping shelters rather than hating them for their policies, i.e. putting our differences aside for the animals recognizing that shelters operate off of municipal budgets and don't always have discretionary ability to change their mission overnight   I do agree with a few points of this article. The reality is we are all faced with a law of supply and demand, especially just too much supply due to lack of spay/neuter, community education and puppy mills. I also think we can't just ""adopt"" our way out.  Where I disagree with this article is that it's more attack on groups that do sincerely want to help. LA shelters need support, and people bashing each-other (NKLA people do this too) only hurts these animals that so need our help.   It's not about the people, people!"

If the latter, it's amazing they even took x-rays. Most reputable shelters have to let adopters know of any known, on-going medical issues, it's solely to keep people informed and make sure they aren't getting in over their heads. Some people think it's a tactic to scare people away from adopting, to kind of talk them out of it. But that isn't the case; they just want to make sure you can deal with the medical issues before adopting.  You should be prepared to pay the medical fees if something is wrong with that leg. I'm no vet, I didn't see the dog or x-rays, I can't tell you if I think it's something that may cost a lot or will go away. But you should always prepare for the worst. If you are worried about the potential vet bill, maybe you should look elsewhere. If you're simply worried about the dog's quality of life, well, it would be better to be crippled in a home than crippled in a shelter. But I believe that if the dog gets regular vet checks, and is brought to a vet whenever a medical issue appears, I doubt he'll have any terminal or chronic issue that couldn't be appropriately dealt with.  So basically, it depends on what you're really worried about. If you're worried about the vet bills, then don't bother. If you're more concerned about the dog's potential quality of life, I think you have nothing to worry about at that young age."
rescuedogs,3bcl8h,Mad_Marchie,3,Sun Jun 28 00:54:37 2015 UTC,"My GSD had a very bad limp around the same age as this pup. He would limp very bad some days, other days look fine. Vets were quick to assume it was hip dysplasia. It took an expert (after two different vet visits) to tell us it was growing pains. 2 years later he runs like a beast possessed without any issue. I know this may not be the case for this pup, but it always isn't the worst case scenario. If you love the pup, make him a part of your family and take the bad with the good. A good home is much better than any shelter. If you cannot afford the possible medical care later on if its something worse, a kickstarter campaign is always an option. My opinion, the heart wants what the heart wants. Give the pup a loving home and hope for the best"

rescuedogs,3bcl8h,designgoddess,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"I just recently adopted two dogs and visited several shelters. The vast majority all have scrapes, bumps, sores, etc. That's just reality. They can't afford lawsuits so they probably go overboard when it comes to disclosure. One of our dogs was covered in mystery sores. They healed up super fast once he was out of the shelter and able to relax.   Puppies are curious and active and he could have just had a minor injury, like kids get. Send the report to a vet if it makes you feel better, but I wouldn't be overly concerned.   My mom's 2 year old dog developed a bad limp (was only walking on three feet) over the weekend. Vet couldn't find a reason for the foot to be inflamed/infected but he's already back to normal today after a few days of antibiotics. It seemed way more serious the way he carried on but he's fine now. Best guess is that he punctured his foot on a stick but any wound already healed before vet could find it.   Anyways, yeah. Most shelter dogs have minor issues, often from the stress of living in the shelter. For all you know the puppy could have overextended jumping up on the kennel fence to greet people or something simple like that."

rescuedogs,3acu65,M261JB,7,Fri Jun 19 01:55:19 2015 UTC,"She has no interest in running for a ball.   Totally normal. My rescue had to be ""taught"" how to play with toys and fetch, etc..   When I take her for a walk, she walks at my pace. If I stop she stops, if I go, she goes, see does not ever pull on the leash.   Um, awesome! Reinforce that good behavior with lots of praise and treats!   She doesn't like any of the 3 types of treat that we have bought.   What kind of treats are they? Some dogs are really picky or just need to get comfortable before they feel safe enough to take treats from you. Try real human food. Little bits of plain boiled chicken are a good place to start. Other things to try sparingly - cheese, deli meat, carrots, sweet potato, scramble egg. If she still denies those things she probably just needs to settle and feel more comfortable with you.   The first thing we did was give her a bath and shampoo with a hose pipe. She didn't even move.   Probably scared and shut down. That's pretty normal for shelter dogs. My dogs was easy like this the first few weeks and now she fights when we try to bathe her. We take her to a groomer instead now and she's much better with them than us :)   I walked her around the garden. The crazy neighbor dogs were at the fence barking their heads off, she didn't even seem to notice them Totally ignored them.   Again, she might just be shut down from her time at the shelter and needs time to relax, get acclimated and then she will start to show some personality or even gain enough confidence to show interest. Or maybe she just doesn't care about to her dogs after all her time at the shelter.    We live in the Caribbean and the first night we had her sleep outside. The first time she tried to walk into the house we said, no no no no no. She stopped and hasn't tried to come in since even if the door is open. When I am inside and say come she looks and walks in.   Probably spooked her a bit and now shes too afraid to come in. Some dogs are really sensitive. I would just slowly, gently lure her in with lots of sweet talk and treats (once you find something she likes)   We put on towel on the floor. With no fuss she sat on it and slept this afternoon, and this evening is lying there, with no inclination to get off.   Okay, good! Definitely praise her for this and reinforce it so she starts to feel more confident about her place in your home. Slowly start to lure her to other places in your home or even put other towels down if it seems to make her feel safer. As she starts to warm up, you can start to remove the towels.   She is on tablets for heart worms as all the dogs they take in have this problem they say.   It's common for dogs to get heartworms at a shelter and it is often too costly for pounds to treat or prevent. If the dog has heartworms already, just be aware that it can be a long and costly road back to health for this dog that you will now be burdened with. Depending on how long she's had it for, it could be deathly serious. Does she pant or cough a lot, vomit? Fatigue could also be a symptom. Take her to the vet as soon as  you can.   How is a dog so placid ? I'm told that she was originally a family dog, but doesn't understood sit, and stay etc. Not yet.    It could be severe heartworms. It could be that she is just in shut down mode after pound life and needs to come out of her shell. It could just be her personality. It's hard to know. My money is on her being shutdown and just needing time to acclimate. If you are serious about keeping her, take her to an independent vet to rule out any medical issues. If you are feeling like you aren't a good match, you do have a trial period to fall back on."
rescuedogs,3acu65,hammy-hams,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"What an aw some answer, thank you.    Does she pant or cough a lot, vomit? Fatigue could also be a symptom. Take her to the vet as soon as you can.  Yes, she pants all the time that she is awake, and sleeps a lot and has no energy. The shelter said that this is due to the medication.  They have a report of when she had her tablets and when she is to have more and when we have to take her to the vet.  They were talking about this being a 6  month process..  We are giving her lots of praise for everything that she does well, they told us not to walk her for more than 15 minutes a day.  Some people who have dogs their house SMELLS of dogs, is that just because they don't bath them enough ?  What do you think of her 'home being the patio' more than inside.  The patio is party covered as it was a screened porch area, that we took the screen out of so it has a roof and a fan and the rest of the patio is a large screened area."
rescuedogs,3acu65,hammy-hams,3,Fri Jun 19 03:07:51 2015 UTC,"What kind of tablets are they?   The fact that she is always panting, has no energy and was recommended to walk no more than 15 minutes a day worries me. A 6 year old lab/husky type mix should be able to do much more than that. Is that all because of the medicine or because of the heartworms themselves? I just would want to know for sure that she was getting better on her current regimen and that heartworms was the real issue and not some other unidentified health problem.  My rescue had been to the vet via her foster owner but I still took her to my own vet before deciding to keep her because I really wanted to make sure that I understood any medical issues she may have had as well as kind of double checking that the rescue wasn't bullshitting me (not that I think rescue's are lying to people, you just never know what may be missed or glossed over and I feel like it's always a safe idea to get an independent vet opinion if you can).   Some people who have dogs their house SMELLS of dogs, is that just because they don't bath them enough ?   I thik it's a combination or factors - some dogs are just stinkier than toher dogs, some people aren't as clean as other people (I wash my dogs bed regularly, vacuum the carpets and clean her toys pretty regularly too and that helps keep smells down), and yeah, some people don't bathe their dogs enough. Honestly though, if your dog smells, you'll probably just become immune to it and not notice it over time.   What do you think of her 'home being the patio' more than inside. The patio is party covered as it was a screened porch area, that we took the screen out of so it has a roof and a fan and the rest of the patio is a large screened area.   It depends on how sunny and hot it gets out there. Some dogs really don't do well in the heat. I imagine a 6 year old lab/husky mix with health issues probably wouldn't do too great in warm temperatures. I don't know how it is where you live but where I live, it's considered unacceptable to keep dogs outside but if it's normal where you live and its safe, secure and a allows her shade and cool temps than it's probably fine. There are also things you can do to keep a dog cool like use a fan, as you mentioned, and keep cold water out there at all times and a cooling mat as well.  She sounds like a really sweet girl and if you can provide her adequate home and make sure she gets over her current heartworms problem, I'm sure she'll warm up to you over time."
rescuedogs,3acu65,wkukinslayer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:51:12 2015 UTC,"I suspect most of those symptoms are due to the heartworm treatment. I've seen dogs at the shelter I volunteer at go through the treatment and it really, really, REALLY wears them down. It's like the equivalent of chemo treatment for humans, really painful stuff.  Sounds like a very well behaved and super sweet new family member though!"
rescuedogs,3acu65,hammy-hams,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:43:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, good to know! That makes sense.   I am most definitely not a vet and have never had a dog with heartworms (although I am pretty familiar with the signs, prevention etc) so thank you for the insight! Are tablets a common treatment that works well? I thought injections were usually necessary? Or maybe it' s the pre-adult HW treatment phase."
rescuedogs,3acu65,wkukinslayer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's likely exactly that. If I had to guess, it's an ivermectin pre treatment to kill off any worms or larva that haven't made it to the heart before bringing out the big guns. I've heard from one of the vet techs that some of the preventative treatments can be used to combat adult heartworms if caught early (I'm no doctor though, just an occasional volunteer, so I can't speak to the validity), so maybe it's a lower cost treatment possibility.  You're right though, most often the injection method is used, and it's very very hard on the poor pup. :(  edit: The six month process could also just be another check up to make sure the dog doesn't have heartworms, as it can take around six months for them to mature, so basically if your dog has been off heartworm medicine for ~1-2 months, they should be tested and then again six months later to make sure they're clear. If THAT's what's going on, then OP should see their vet and have her looked at, because the lethargy is certainly abnormal.  OP, if the heartworm test was negative, probably a good plan to see a vet. Probably a good plan to see a vet regardless though. :)"

That means a lot of the time they'll have scarring and marks that make a dog that already has the ""dangerous breed"" stigma attached look that much scarier.

He did have the younger, more obnoxious dog crawl all over him and he literally just ignored the other dog. He liked everyone, tried to listen, and just wanted to go home with me.   When I walked into the room to adopt him a week after our first meeting, he ran to me and just melted into my lap (I sat down to meet him). It was love. Our first stop was to get him a bone, then we drove three hours home.   Just find the dog that will fit with you, your lifestyle, and recognize that every dog (just like every human) has a flaw. Be willing to work with them and love them through it. My dog is why I get up in the morning. He is my soul."
rescuedogs,39fr80,safescience,2,Thu Jun 11 22:19:42 2015 UTC,"there's no such thing as a ""rescue dog"" just simply a dog you got from a rescue or shelter. giving into the idea that a dog is a ""rescue dog"" tends too make people think their unstable or anxiety ridden. but thats not true at all. all dogs, like people, handle that environment and the freedom that comes from being adopted differently.  best advice is knowing the dogs personality before you decide too adopt it. making sure it fits in with your lifestyle and with your personality. the ""by 3's"" rule should be 3 days of adjusting too the new living environment, by week 3 they should have a grasp on your schedule and feel more comfortable in your home and around you. by 3 months they should be a regular dog (besides any special quirks that he already had) but there shouldn't be many surprises by 3 months in.  good luck!"
rescuedogs,39fr80,onestonedspoon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:44:17 2015 UTC,What does anyone who adopts a rescue dog absolutely need to know?  Is it house trained would be my question ?
rescuedogs,399bzy,Sparkles72,2,Wed Jun 10 04:47:28 2015 UTC,"People are big! Making yourselves smaller could help. Have your husband lay down on the ground on his back, and lay out his arms. You could put treats on him, too. Encourage your dog to come near your husband by sitting near him, amd giving your dog treats yourself first, and make sure both of you can talk gently to your pup.  Good luck, I hope other people can give you more advice!"
rescuedogs,399bzy,poopsdaydevice,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:39:23 2015 UTC,"I have even had my husband squat, walk sideways, no eye contact and that just made him bark louder.

rescuedogs,399bzy,telios87,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:58:34 2015 UTC,Give it time.  We rescued a 3 year old chi mix that was essentially feral.  He spent the first two days hiding under the dining table.  Putting on the leash took upwards of 30 minutes.  It took nearly a month before he warmed up enough to come and sit next to me.
rescuedogs,399bzy,3houndsmom,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:28:08 2015 UTC,thanks :) hoping this will happen for us too after three months with us
rescuedogs,399bzy,3houndsmom,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:55:53 2015 UTC,"Had this problem with one of my rescues.  Bonded with me, but not my aunt who lived with us.  Got a trainer in.  Essentially, my aunt had to be responsible for all of Sadie's needs when we were both there. food, out and treats.  But not just any old treat.  THE TREAT.   The one she enjoyed the most.  And I was NEVER to give it to her, just my aunt. Well,through trial and error, we discovered what Sadie loved most in this world was dairy.  But namely, vanilla ice cream.  My aunt had a bowl every evening and so did Sadie (like 3 tblsp.) within a month they were best buds.  And long story short, as my aunt became elderly and more demented and ill, Sadie became her constant companion, and guardian angel.  When I would put auntie to bed at night she would be agitated and feisty, but Sadie would hop on the bed and lay across her legs, unprompted, and auntie would settle down within minutes.  During the day, Sadie would be right at her side and would ""alert"" me if auntie was trying to get up. It was amazing to see....  Also agree with being on his level.  Barking  - ignore him.  Sometimes dogs accept negative attention just as well as positive.  ""catch him"" being quiet, and reward it - ""good quiet!"" with that special treat.   I hope some these ideas help, if I can be of anymore help - just ask. much luck!"
rescuedogs,399bzy,3houndsmom,2,Wed Jun 10 11:33:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your advice and for sharing your beautiful story. We will try the ""good quiet"" I hadn't  thought of that! If you think of anything else please share:)"
rescuedogs,399bzy,kellalillies,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:52:54 2015 UTC,"Okay - here you go, but it is a bit lengthy.  You should go away for a time (an hour or so) Just hubby and the newbie alone.  He should get a good book and sit on the floor to read it. Ignore the dog. Read his book.  But he should have ""the favorite snack"" in tiny small pieces with him. Without making eye contact, he can toss the dog a treat.  Far away from him. Across the room.  Then after a bit, another treat, a few inches closer to him.  Make sure the treat is ""high value"" to the dog. Now he can keep tossing treats closer and closer. All the time he should ignore the dog. Finally a treat can be placed very close, and maybe in his hand, or on his leg.  If he gets nervous go back to further away.  He should try this every evening until he catches on, ""Dad has good stuff - not a bad guy"".  With persistence, it does work.  As for potty training. Have you tried crate training? As he is a bit older - should be easy and quick.   As for leash - do you use a collar or harness? I have a friend whose dog hated ""getting ready"" for the walk. She wrestled a harness on him - just a soft cloth one and left it on.  This way, at walk time the leash went on ( the hook is usually on the back) and she had no more problems. He was not the least bit offended by wearing the harness 24/7.  Might be worth a try.   And my favorite secret from classes.  Have a dog that pulls on the walk?  Just stop. Stand still. Will take a second for doggie to realize he is not getting anywhere, but when they stop and look at you like ""Huh?"", resume walking.  Pulls again, just stop. My little guy did this for about a week and our walks were long without much distance, but finally the light bulb went on and he figured it out.  Also.  Every corner, whether there are cars coming or not, dogs must sit. This comes with a treat and a command.  I always used "" wait"" - and then give permission to ""go ahead"".   Hope some of these help. Also use the other guy to help train.  And remember first dog is ALWAYS first.  Establish the pecking order.  Little doggies tend to be unaware of their size and think they own the place and everyone in it! :-)   Hope some of these ideas help."
rescuedogs,397won,lizardmarsh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:08:25 2015 UTC,Have you contacted any rescues about him? I've been looking adopt an older shepherd or husky but I have busy week at work this week and can't see the dog until after 6 or 7pm until next saturday :(  I'll definitely visit that shelter next saturday though! How long do they keep animals there and do you know if they're open after 6pm?
rescuedogs,397won,ten0ritaiga,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"Rescues see networked alerts. Rescuers are often short of foster volunteers so that is frequently the reason that a pet is not swooped up by a rescue.  Anyone who would like to apply to foster a dog from Carson is encouraged to email the volunteers at CarsonFosters@gmail.com. This particular inmate is a lovey-dovey happy people-loving geriatric guy who would probably enjoy living at the home of people who are home a lot to monitor his health, dote on him, and fluff his pillows :-). He would not be a jogging partner and he would probably be hurt if not allowed to sleep in the main bedroom with his people. It is rather a dilemma to want a dog to participate in lively activities with their people, and be a hard-working person who may not have enough time to be with him/her. During those times if the dog is not getting enough exercise they may exhibit frustration by chewing things, howling, and so on. Such pets are returned to pounds where they are again in danger. There are six facilities in the Los Angeles County animal control system (and about that many in the City of Los Angeles system). At the moment there are 1730 animals impounded in the County system including dogs, cats, birds, livestock, and ""other."" The hours for the Carson facility in Gardena, California at 216 Victoria Street (310.523.9566) are: M-TH 12pm - 7pm, F-SU - 10am - 5pm The shelter does not keep pets long as it is high-intake and high-kill. It is an unpleasant place for a pet to be. You will see many sad, frustrated, lonely, adoptable inmates if you visit next Saturday. My hunch is A4838029 will not  still be there. Please consult the FAQ page at: http://animalcare.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/acc/faqs/"
rescuedogs,397won,ten0ritaiga,2,Wed Jun 10 15:45:07 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for this information! My house may not be a good fit for him since we're a pretty active household and go on hiking/backpacking/camping trips a lot but I'll help spread the word!
rescuedogs,397wfg,lizardmarsh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:06:29 2015 UTC,I updated his post: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LizMarshallBlogs/posts/4UNE1sb92Js
rescuedogs,399716,ten0ritaiga,2,Wed Jun 10 04:04:16 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly, it's a clause that they have for extreme cases. Possession is 9/10ths the law anyway and in order for a rescue to ""take the dog back"" they must take you to court over it and provide proof as to why you were an unfit adopter.   As far as people rehoming their dog to you, there are some people who would like to know how their former dog is doing. Usually, they're more than happy with just some photos and updates, but aside from that, I've never seen more wish for visits, just due to not wanting to bother the adoptive family.   I would be concerned if a family didn't want to visit their former dog or get updates. Not saying that you're a bad adopter, but I would want a family to be concerned due to how there are some bad people out there.  Anyway, I hope that explains some things to you!"
rescuedogs,399716,superbread,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:56:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Of course I would send pictures and videos. It's the ""visits"" part that makes me wary. I'm a private person and feel pretty ineasy giving out my home address and contact information to relative strangers. I mean it's hard enough for me to allow all these rescue volunteers into my home without even knowing them.  I've read about a few cases where the old owners got overbearing and would show up unannounced, as if they were still entitled to the dog. They even brought all their kids along to guilt-trip the new owners.  I'm not so worried about owner-operated adoptions. It's the legal clauses with rescues that I worry about. I can fend off one or two people by myself.... But a legal battle???   My wariness is about what rescues deem as ""abuse."" If the dog is happy, healthy, and gets a clean bill from the vet.... Yet they see a dog outside for a majority of the day, and some of them are up in arms and call it neglect. Some ppl called forbidding a dog from a bedroom neglect and cruel. I can deal with some of the crazy during the adoption process but not for years afterwards...."
rescuedogs,399716,superbread,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"It's always a concern, however, chances are few and far in between that it would happen where owners show up in that manner. If anything a bill of sale will protect you.   Always keep in mind that the rescue has the dog's best interest at heart. It is definitely for worst case possible (dog is chained outside for 8 hours a day - illegal in CA btw... Etc).   The likely hood of them taking your dog back is very slim to none. If there is a legal battle, again, the chances of them getting their dog back unless you are found guilty of not giving said dog adequate care... Are slim. There is a Judge Judy case where a foster kept the dog and the rescue wanted the dog back. Judge Judy ruled on the side of the foster.   Your concerns of course, are valid. However the chances of any of it happening are very slim. Clauses are there to protect the rescue and the dog.   You may be an awesome adopter, but out there... There can be some really terrible people. The rescues want to minimize that risk thus have those clauses to anticipate issues from those folks, not you.   Hope that helps a little bit.   Btw, I am not sure if you did or not, did you get a chance to contact Buddy's owner? :) I'm really sorry about not contacting you sooner!"

rescuedogs,399716,superbread,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"He is best after 6, I think a call is usually good. He's aloof and busy which is why Buddy needs rehoming :( it is sad and heartbreaking. He is really such a good dog, but requires more attention than his owner can give."

rescuedogs,399716,designgoddess,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"Oh! Also, I forgot to mention to you. Regardless of the dog you decide to go with, make sure you give yourself 2 weeks + with the dog in your home.   Usually after 2 wks-1 month, the dog will get comfortable and you will see his or her personality come out. In the first few weeks, the dog may either act out... Or be introverted."
rescuedogs,399716,seonadancing1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"Oh Yea I'm definitely prepared for a settling in period. It's the same with hamsters. :)  That's Actually why I wanted to work with a rescue in the first place with a foster-to-adopt model so that I can have a trial period to get to know the dog and see if we are a good match. I'll have to keep trying my luck I guess. If I do take a chance on a shelter dog, I would definitely spend the time to train it out of any bad behaviors."
rescuedogs,399716,Brains4Beauty,2,Thu Jun 11 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"A rescue I work with just invoked this clause for the first time in a very long time. The adopters didn't bother to train the dog and when it got to be to much they chained it in the back yard. One of their rules is that the dogs have to be inside dogs. I can't remember how they found out, but they went and got the dog. Rescues have a hard enough time finding homes for dogs, they're not looking to take them back. The clause is there just in case the dog is abused or neglected. It also gives adopters a safe place for the dogs if their lives go haywire and they have to give the dog up. You don't have to worry about turning the dog over to a kill shelter."

rescuedogs,393kk4,judyr908,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:30:47 2015 UTC,"Adoption fees are in part to prove that you have the financial resources to afford to provide a quality life for the dog. If you can't afford a $50-250 adoption fee, that's an indicator that you could not afford quality food, necessary veterinary care, parasite prevention, training, grooming, and supplies like a crate, bedding, toys, and so on.  If money is tight, have you considered fostering? You could foster for your local Humane Society or a rescue, and foster until you find a dog that fits well with you that you want to keep. You'd probably still have an adoption fee but it would allow you to ""test drive"" potential dogs. The organization would fund all veterinary needs and supplies until time of adoption. And meanwhile, you're providing a loving home for a dog in need until it can find a forever home. Also, while you may wish to have another dog, does your sick, senior dog need the stress of adding another dog to your home?"

She came to us with her sister Maggie from a high volume kill shelter down south. The two can and will be separated, though they would also love to find a home together.  Angie is a sweet, gentle soul. She is great with everyone and everything, including all cats, all dogs and all people. That being said, Angie is currently on the shyer side of life and would be happiest with humans, canines and kitties who let her warm up her own time. You are promised the reward of Angie's love and devotion if you do.  Angie likes belly rubs and laying on the feet of her humans. She has given herself a job and that job is to make sure her people's feet are always kept warm by the little furnace inside her heart. Angie is house trained and has nice indoor manners. She walks well on the leash and is quickly learning basic commands. Not that Angie is old, but whoever said you can't teach an old dog new tricks clearly never met our middle-aged Angie.  This sweet girl is headed north this weekend and so deserves a foster or forever to welcome her in to the second leg of her new life. She can go anywhere from Virginia to Maine for fostering and can be adopted anywhere from Tennessee to Maine and parts of Ohio and Indiana.  To foster or adopt Angie, email estelle@bigfluffydogs.com  Queenie: Hi everyone. Allow me to introduce myself. My friends call me Queenie.. and rightfully so, as I am the Queen of all that the light touches. I came from a really bad place where I wasn't treated like a Queen at all, but now that I am a Big Fluffy, I am back to my regal ways. All my servants tell me I have the best burning blue eyes ever. They add to my royal looks. My humans also tell me I am a lab mix, with maybe some Husky or border collie thrown in. They also tell me I am a hamster because I only weigh 35 lbs. I don't know what that means, all I know is that I am super sweet, regal and friendly. I love my human companions, and I get along fine with other dogs. My humans are going to cat test me, and I will report back once I have decided if I will let kitties in to my inner circle. I haven't met kids yet, but I bet older ones would be OK.  I would love to crash at your place this coming weekend, and I am adoptable from TN to CT.

Hamlet has mastered some of the finer skills in life. He enjoys the company of other dogs and has wonderful leash skills. Like many keeshonden, he loves his toys and will entertain you with his adorable antics. When we questioned him about cats, he had the following to say:  ""To chase or not to chase: that is the question. whether it is better to suffer the superior stares of a smug feline or to give temptation free reign and pursue them gleefully. Hmmmm! The insolence of a kitten may be too much for me but I beg you consider my finer attributes""   While Hamlet does not approve of kitties, he is a simply amazing boy who would love a person or family that he could bond with, plenty of attention and adoration. If you are interested in fostering or adding Hamlet to your family, please contact Desiree@bigfluffydogs.com or Lisa.S@bigfluffydogs.com. Hamlet can travel to VA, into New England and most states reasonably nearby.  Waylon is one of the 2 remaing border collies from the 17 that were pulled from a farmer who could not care for them.

Jameson is a delicious blended Irish whiskey, but it's also the name of this 14-month-old, 20-lb Pekingese pup. But this Jameson far surpasses the adult beverage when it comes to smoothness and taste. To put it bluntly, Jameson is fabulous, so fabulous that we have come to believe that he was a major Broadway star in his former life. He even has a hint of that don't-talk-to-me-I'm-famous nature, which is why he likes some dogs (they are worthy to be his friend) and others he will take a pass on . And he's SO refined that he doesn't care much for kids (under 10), either. What Jameson will love, however, is a comfy bed, some adult humans who can keep up with his reading list, and who just might put a musical on TV for him when they do have to leave him behind at home. He's outgoing and social, and fits in perfectly whether he's at a high-end restaurant, or just relaxing on the lawn and reading a newspaper on a Sunday morning. He is an active pup, however, who definitely wants to be out on the town meeting people and getting lots of attention. He will shine in his future Forever Home, and he will definitely help keep things interesting-and cute-wherever he lands. For more information, please contact jessica@bigfluffydogs.com. Jameson is accepting applications from TN to New England, at www.bigfluffydogs.com."

Maybe try to incorporate that near the end, when you say he's good with dogs. I work in animal rescue, and the three questions I get most often are:   Is s/he housebroken? Is s/he good with dogs and/or cats? Is s/he good with kids?   Mikey is also clearly not any kind of pedigreed dog, but if you can afford it, a Wisdom Panel or other doggy genetic test would be a good idea, too. They retail for about $70 on Amazon and have a ~4-6 week turnaround time. Adopters want to know what breed the dog is, not that it matters when you're talking about mutts, but they'll ask, and if he's got any restricted breeds in his mix, that might keep him from being able to live in certain places, and it's better to know before someone who isn't allowed to have him comes and meets and falls in love with him."

I know it's not what you want to hear, but there's something about the muzzle, face width and eye spacing that says pitbull or amstaff. It's hard to tell when they're young, though.  The only reason I say Toller is the intelligence, colouring and coat length (if mixed with shorthair). I feel like there's just too much white to be a lab mix, but I've seen stranger. That said, I don't know how popular Tollers are in Florida - they're a common mix on the West Coast, though. No idea about the east.  Do you know if the tail was docked or naturally occurring (or is it hidden somehow)? Could be some kind of aussie mix if it's a natural stub tail.  A boxer mix would usually have a more upturned nose, longer legs, deeper chest, or something, but I just don't see boxer here.  Do you have any other pictures? A standing and/or profile shot would help, too."

We named our pup Karlton and every single conversation with new people goes something like...:  Stranger: Aww your puppy is so cute (accusingly whispers) Is he part pit? Me: I'm not sure, it's possible. His names Karlton. Stranger: OMG Karlton is such a cute name, he's so handsome you're so lucky to have such a friendly boy...  As they say, it's all in the name.

You swab the dog's cheek and send it in, two to three weeks later you get results.  We are pondering that if we keep the dog we are fostering since all they can tell us is he is a ""terrier mix."""
rescuedogs,37vmxm,ShiftyEyesMcGee,1 point,Sun May 31 21:38:57 2015 UTC,"This test isn't very cheap, but I think it's worth the one time fee to settle your curiosity!  I had it done on my dog, I used Wisdom Panel. I knew she was some kind of pit, but doesn't look 100% purebred. The test shows you great grandparent lineage and works best if each member of the family has 3 or less breeds associated. Mine had one parent that was 100% AmStaff and the other parent was a mix of AmStaff, Briard, and a bunch of other things.  I didn't get a clear answer since one parent was so mixed, but it was still interesting to see the lineage!  OP, don't worry about other people too much. Focus on training and socializing your pup so she matures into a wonderful balanced dog and then your neighbors can eat it :) Most people that get all up in arms about pits can't even recognize them anyway. I've fostered many different breeds and have had my cranky neighbors CROSS the street when walking by my Australian kelpie because I was using a head collar and they thought she was an aggressive pit with a muzzle... silly."

Yeah, I can't really claim to be any kind of dog breed expert, I just saw some pics of boxer pups and her color scheme looked similar to a fawn with the white feet and nose.   The tail is not cropped, just has it tucked under in the pic. Her tail is white tipped, like her feet. The only other information the pound could give me is that she was transferred from an overpopulated shelter in Alabama. She's had her first vet visit, too, but the Doc was hesitant to say what she thought she was. Like you said, hard to tell when they're young and without a lot of background information, god only knows.  She seems very intelligent for sure and is picking up training fast. She has been with us about 10 days and is doing well with the potty training and walking on a leash. Still doesn't like the crate much, though.  Anyway, I uploaded some more pics I have taken the last couple days.  moar pics!"

rescuedogs,37t1uv,ABigHairyGuy,6,Sat May 30 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"A puppy needs to go out every couple of hours, it can hold its bladder about one hour per month old. Beyond that, leaving a puppy alone for that long keeps them from being socialized properly and will cause big issues later one.   There's no question you should get an adult dog, and I think you also still need a dog walker."
rescuedogs,37t1uv,apwoyomatek,3,Sat May 30 04:06:49 2015 UTC,"I concur, and those issues a lot of people worry about with pit bulls are often caused by not being properly socialized. It would be a hard kick in the ass to get a puppy trying to avoid problems, and then just creating them from a blank slate instead.  It's honestly really rare for a dog at a shelter to end up there from actually being abused; it's usually landlord issues and financial reasons. The dogs should have passed some sort of behavior assessment, but always ask employees and volunteers about the dog with kids and use some common sense. If the dog is very shy or fearful, it won't be a good fit. If the dog is very big/strong and jumpy, it probably wont be good for your younger kids."

rescuedogs,37t1uv,cashleyborin,4,Sun May 31 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'd second the recommendation to get the older dog rather than the pup because it sounds like you may not have the time to devote to a puppy. Plus with younger kids, an older rescue (which hopefully has been tested with children and other animals) would likely respond better to younger children who aren't always as gentle or patient as we'd hope :) Honestly if you do your research and go through a reputable rescue, they should have already been screened for any behavioral concerns from a poor upbringing. Plus they hopefully will come with some rudimentary training basics which will make life easier with a first dog.   As far as setting up the sunroom/backyard so he can come and go as he pleases, I'd probably not recommend that (especially at first). Think of it this way.. Would you want your children having free rein to come and go whenever they please with no supervision? Plus living in Florida, you're going to have to make sure they have easy access to water/shade because heat stroke and dehydration are a real concern. With an older dog, I don't see why 4 hours then a quick pee break/romp in the yard on lunch before another 5 hours alone would be an issue. Just really try to get enough exercise in before and after work so the dog doesn't get stir crazy or bored during time spent alone.   One last thing... Make sure you sit down with your kids and talk about the appropriate ways to interact with a dog. Even the most mild mannered dog could get fed up at being poked and prodded constantly and the last thing we'd want is any issues there.   Congratulations on your venture into dog ownership! It's a really rewarding experience :)  Also don't feel rushed into picking a dog just for the sake of getting one... Make sure the dog really fits you and your family. Given the amount of time it will spend alone, I'd recommend looking at ones with more laid back personalities. Also even if you have no other pets now, make sure you ask how it acts around other animals. :) You never know when you might want to add to the furry family.. Plus the dog will be around other animals when you take it from places!"
rescuedogs,37t1uv,SmoSays,2,Sat May 30 04:34:09 2015 UTC,Thank you.  That is great advice.  I agree that getting an older dog would be a better fit.  I live in Central NJ.  A Florida Room is an enclosed back room that is surround by screen windows and has a screen door that leads to the backyard.  I have it set-up now with a fan.  It gets real comfortable in their compared to outside.  It's a great way  to hang out in the summer and not get bit by flys.  Lol.
rescuedogs,37t3x9,Echoscurvydog,3,Sat May 30 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"I always like to take a new dog (I foster a lot) on a walk with my dog. One person per dog just in case, don't walk both yourself for intro walks. Walk around the block, if you have a big grassy/park area that's a perfect place to walk to and around as well. When you're feeding them or giving chews, better safe than sorry and always have one in a crate or behind a solid barrier. A kind of ""test"" for food/chew guarding I'll do is to put new dog in a crate with a chew, and have my cats/dogs walk by. Not pester, just a walk by to see if new dog stiffens, eats/chews more quickly, with head down looks up from tops of eyes, pulls lips forward, freezes, any warning signs like that. Always supervise, don't leave them home alone together, don't even shower or cook dinner or be on your computer with back turned at first. As they settle in and learn each other, and you learn the new dog, you can start to give more freedoms but don't give a chance for a fight and don't have any ""let's just see what they do"" times. Use leashes, crates, barriers. They can absolutely be loose together, and run around the yard together, but take it slow and work up to that. After a walk together, I crate my dog and I always have new dog on leash for a tour of the house and yard, then bring my dog outside, I'll follow the new dog around, allow interactions and such, when things are going well then I'll take leash off."
rescuedogs,37n5im,ten0ritaiga,2,Thu May 28 21:22:56 2015 UTC,It's a shame you haven't found a rescue to work with. They're usually good and making a good match. I'm initial instinct is that a Husky or Malamute is not a good fit for your situation. With no fenced yard you need a dog that doesn't need a ton of exercise.
rescuedogs,37n5im,designgoddess,2,Fri May 29 04:40:11 2015 UTC,"Oh I guess I wasn't clear in my post about the yard. I have a hard time figuring out what is considered a yard or patio since the real estate agents used the term interchangeably when we were looking at the place.  It's a fairly sized patio/yard with a wooden fence.. about 5-6ft sunken into the ground. The yard is big enough to host a bbq party of 5-8 people. I can fit my 10x10 ft canopy in there with a outdoor dining table for 8, along with a grill.  And as for exercise, we are a fairly active household. When I was dogsitting a GSD, I ran 1-2 miles with her every morning and evening and took her out on day hikes (about 3-5 miles) on the weekend."
rescuedogs,37n5im,designgoddess,1 point,Fri May 29 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"I say this because I used to live in a townhouse where a neighbor had a husky. She can not get the dog enough exercise. He needs a yard where he can run and get the zoomies out of his system. A perfect dog for daycare. She went and got him a pit bull sister to play with. If the whole neighborhood didn't step up to help her it would be a train wreck. A lot of rescues use an over abundance of caution in picking homes. Friends who had their last dog live to 17 couldn't find a rescue to work with them because of the fence deal. Great dog people who live on 10 acres, but they're not good enough. They finally found a group who would overlook their ""glaring"" faults. Keep trying."
rescuedogs,37n5im,designgoddess,1 point,Fri May 29 19:50:37 2015 UTC,Seriously! I'm starting to feel like nothing is good enough for these rescues unless the adopters are carbon copies of the rescuers. It really has been pushing me more and more towards getting a puppy through a breeder or doing a trial by fire with shelter dogs.   I just got off the phone with another rescue and the tone of the person's voice completely changed as soon as I said the dog wouldn't be allowed to sleep in our bedrooms...... Does every dog owner let their dogs sleep on the bed with them???
rescuedogs,37n5im,designgoddess,1 point,Sat May 30 01:33:41 2015 UTC,I do. I have three who cripple me every night. As long as the shelter dog is temperament tested you'll just need to get the dog vetted. Most rescues around here get most of their dogs from animal control. AC does the temperament test and basic vet care. The rescue does the rest. It's like cutting out the middle man if you know what you're doing.
rescuedogs,37n5im,lizardmarsh,1 point,Sat May 30 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about the temperament as far as sleeping on the bed goes. My rest is just important to me and it simply wouldn't be comfortable to fit me and my bf and a big dog on one bed. That and i have hamsters in my room already that are up at night and I can see them keeping the dog up... And if the dog has a high prey drive that'd be even worse! It's better to let the dog has its own place where it feels secure and sleep there. I know people love to be with their dogs all the time, but I feel like a little structure in the dogs' life isn't a bad thing. My bf's small dogs had their own beds and spaces in the house that was just their own and they were fine sleeping and hnaginf out there most of the time. By spaces I mean that it was their beds, bowls, and toys. No fencing or anything of course to bar them from the house. They were well-behaved and knew they weren't allowed in the bedrooms."

I have owned seven dogs in my lifetime.  I've had four ""purebreds"" and three rescues, all of which were what my dad calls ""Heinz 57"" dogs.  The purebred dogs were much more temperamental and difficult to deal with than any of my rescues.  The rescues seem to be much more adaptable dogs and much more go-with-the-flow.  And as a side note, my rescues also tend to have less health issues.    This seems to be her reasoning:  All dogs that attack are rescue dogs.  All rescue dogs are pit bulls.  So therefore all killer dogs are pit bulls.  But the problem is that none of those are true."

My local humane society doesn't have a physical building to house animals, it relies on fosters, but it owns a building that is rented to a vet.  As part of the deal they offer multiple low-cost shot clinics and low-cost spay and neuters throughout the year, first come first serve.  I've heard there is always a long line waiting.  They try to help people who have fallen on hard times keep their pets through the low-cost shots, pet food pantry, and they have profiles of pets on their website that need sponsors to help pay for spay/neuters or other surgeries.

Unfortunately for our area we are getting a lot of what I call ""McRescues"" that are pulling all the high pledged $$$ dogs from US shelters and then either rehoming them fresh off the truck or they are ending up in our shelters here as there is this misconception that dogs aren't killed here. Unfortunately a lot of our Canadian feral / homeless / needy dogs fall out of SPCA jurisdiction and are in vulnerable communities that need education and support. A lot of owners are adopting these half vetted not assessed dogs and then a handful of rescues and shelters are having to fix issues and are having to work on keeping the term ""rescue"" from becoming vulgar to the general population. It's becoming very trying to see adopters or fosters getting dogs that end up with huuuuge medical bills or transmittable diseases going into their homes. Same with behaviour issues.

It's a never ending chore to take dogs who have never lived indoors and teach them to be pets, but the alternative is worse."

They run a food bank, help with vet bills, training, will chip pets even if they didn't come from their rescue, and have helped families find pet friendly housing. They also help the county animal control try to find the families of dogs brought in. The idea being that keeping pets with their families when they hit hard times means fewer animals that need rescuing. They also run low cost spay/neuter events and work with trap and release feral cat programs. A few of months ago they took in almost 150 feral cats for a one day spay/neuter marathon. A huge amount of credit goes to the vets and staff who volunteer their time."

rescuedogs,36sgxf,phorkor,5,Fri May 22 05:45:15 2015 UTC,"Most rescue groups are very picky about who they adopt to because they want to adopt to the best possible person. It's nothing personal, they just get a high and mighty attitude and it's something that has driven me away from many rescues that I've volunteered with in the last 10 years. I understand that a rescuer has taken in a dog, possibly nursed it back to health, spent their own money on it and has also grown quite attached to the dog, but many of them have horrible attitudes and think that only people that work from home should be allowed to have a dog.   I had the same issue when I was looking for a dog. I found quite a few that I thought were perfect for me only to be turned away. One I even drove 2 hours for a meet and greet, filled out the paper work, they called my landlord, did an in home inspection, said everything looked good then 2 days later I was told the dog went to another family because I worked too much. Complete bullshit.   The way I saw it, they weren't the right dogs for me. Few months later, I was at my house and my landlord called. She told me she was dog sitting for her cousin and it was a pup they were trying to find a home for. I walked over, said hi, we talked for a few, told my landlord I was going to go grab a beer and I'd be right back. As I walked out the back door, the dog followed. I walked into my place, the dog followed. I went upstairs, he followed and then looked around my place. Came back into the living room and jumped on the couch and laid down. I kind of laughed, then told him to come on and we went back to my landlords house, I sat down, opened a beer and he laid down right on top of my feet. I've had him almost 3 years now and he is the PERFECT dog for me.   Just take your time and don't get impatient. Rescues are great, but there are a TON of dogs that die everyday at the local pound. Go pick out one of them, they need it much more than a dog that's guaranteed to not be killed."

rescuedogs,36sgxf,GHGDR,1 point,Thu May 21 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with city shelters is that they are sometimes in such a rush to make vacancies that I feel like they overlook a lot of things, like the dog's temperament, health issues, behavior issues. Overlooking these things and placing them with incompatible owners just leads to the dog winding up back in the shelter again :T I would hate to do that.  I've been trying my luck with rescues that are a little more detailed with their assessments, but I always seem to fail the ""how long would the dog be alone"" part of it. :("
rescuedogs,36sgxf,ShiftyEyesMcGee,2,Fri May 22 05:33:00 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally get it.   I got one my dogs from a city pound and it is a risk. Most  of the time those dogs have not even seen a vet, but my thought is ""these are the dogs that no one is looking after"".  There are ways you can mitigate that risk by doing your own temperament testing, feeling their hips/joints, etc.  At the end of the day it may not even matter! The dog I got from a private shelter is the one that was the biggest challenge. She was basically a wild dog that lives on the streets the first 5 months of her life (they divulged this later after I was asking about odd behaviors). She had demodectic mange, worms, and a was a little bit of a nightmare."

OP, I'm sorry you're having a hard time but please don't get discouraged!! There are plenty of rescues that are truly trying to help. What area are you from?

rescuedogs,36sgxf,WeavesByNightAndDay,2,Fri May 22 05:52:11 2015 UTC,Aw I'd love to! But I'm on the west coast unfortunately. Southern CA to be exact. I think I'll keep looking in my area. I feel like I just needed to vent and get some insight after seeing my 4th rejection this month. :(
rescuedogs,36sgxf,topsul,1 point,Fri May 22 05:43:47 2015 UTC,I don't blame you for needing to vent. It's a regular complaint we hear from prospective families.   Our application is definitely long (and at least one person has told us it was invasive to her) but we consider ourselves pretty liberal about who we place dogs with. In 5 years of running this rescue we have been very successful with very few returned dogs.  You'll see on our Facebook page that Yoda was just returned but that's because the lady he was living with required back surgery and doesn't have a fence. They were great companions for the year they were together and not having a fence is not a reason we would deny someone from adopting.   We truly hope you find the right rescue and right dog.
rescuedogs,36sgxf,poppyduke,4,Fri May 22 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"My SO were in the same boat. We always were able to fill out the ""Describe a typical day for your future dog"" type box where we could explain all those things you described like come home for lunch or doggy daycare. If the agencies you are applying to don't have a space like that on their application, could you perhaps supplement your application with an email or phone call where you can explain that up front?   Also, try rescues with fosters if you haven't yet. A lot of foster parents will take a lot more time to talk to potential adopters and the fosters really know the dogs better so can spot potential matches better than people that don't live with the dogs sometimes and will make exceptions if they feel the fit is right.   For example, my SO and I don't have a back yard which was a requirement for the dog we wanted but the foster saw we were young, active, had a lot of dog experience and lived in a super dog friendly place and decided we would be a better match for a difficult to handle, attention whore husky mix than the older couple with kids and another dog that did have a backyard.  Part of the problem with rescues and shelters is that they have already taken in dogs that were abandoned or surrendered because their original owners just went out and bought a puppy or adopted the first adorable dog they saw without having the time to devote to it and it became a hassle and the owners decided to just get rid of the dog. These agencies are trying to stop this cycle from continuing and sometimes are way too strict about it in my opinion. Plenty of people with full time jobs are great devoted dog owners.   It's a complicated issue and every place is slightly different plus each single place can have different standards one week to the next depending on the current amount of dogs/what kinds of dogs they have. I don't think it would hurt to re-apply too if you really feel like they overlooked something.  ETA: Also, sometimes it just takes a long time too. We looked for 6 months before finally adopting. A place we had applied to months before that we had never heard back from emailed me out of no where one day (after we got our dog) saying we were approved for to come see their dogs and that they thought they had a good dog for us in mind - it was a private rescue based on appt's only."
rescuedogs,36sgxf,superbread,2,Thu May 21 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"WOW! 6 months! I guess I'll have to try to be patient. I've seen so many of my friends adopt or bring home dogs so quickly I guess my perception was a little biased.  My BF was lucky in that his family actually just found the dogs he had growing up. One of them followed his mom home, and the other his mom found in an alleyway behind her work building. Lucky guy!  I do understand the rescues' pov too, but I feel like they don't take the time to talk to a lot of great potential owners and just gloss over applications all day. It's hard for both sides I guess. :T"
rescuedogs,36sgxf,spreadthemedicine,3,Fri May 22 05:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you are running into that.  Both rescue groups my older two dogs came from asked about work schedule but didn't have a problem with a 40 hour week.  My youngest dog came from the city pound and I don't think they even asked, it was more of a ""sign this form and pay the fee"".  There's a huge problem with overpopulation where I am though, I don't know if that is why.  If you get I lunch break I wonder if you put 8-11am, 12-5pm (or whenever it is) and if that would make a difference.  Even if you can't make it home at lunch maybe it would give you a foot in the door to mention doggie day care or a dog walker if needed."

Either that, or they just glossed over my application without really looking at it.  I have gone to another center that basically did what you city pound did. No specific questions, or foster-to-adopt, or trial period. I'm hesitant about that though because I'm a first-time owner and I want to make sure the dog's a good fit before I commit to a dog that might not be compatible with me. :\"

It's hard for me to find time to go to shelters to just ""browse"" b/c I work during their open hours on weekdays and on weekends, I'm outdoors hiking/backpacking/rock-climbing. So I've been looking online and if I see a dog I like based on the description of the listings, I've been sending in electronic applications or e-mailing.  Things are hunky dory during the process until they ask how many hours the dog would be alone. My BF and I both work full-time. He actually travels for work and is only home Friday-Sunday. So I tell them the dog would most likely be home alone 8-9 hours a day (I do mention I sometimes come home during lunch). Right after that, I usually get a ""Sorry, but this dog would not do well being alone for 8 hours a day""  Ugh. It makes me think that adoption agencies just want SAH parents, retired people, someone who works from home, or unemployed people to adopt.

Organizing by color seems like it could get a bit hectic.. Unless you have the same item in numerous colors? Then color AND size so you/customers can quickly see if you have a specific item in the correct size and color. If you're organizing an actual store floor, try to put cute/nice items at the entryway to lure customers in and keep the smaller/cheaper items at register to try and get that impulse purchase :) There's actually a lot of research into efficiently displaying inventory if you're ever bored!

The UK does have a stray problem of its own though it is hidden as there are many dog wardens that quickly pick up strays where they go to kennels. Lots get a rescue place but rescues rely on donations. There are thousands of dogs in the UK looking for their forever home. In the charity I volunteer for there are about 130-140 dogs looking for there home. The majority of these dogs have been taken from pounds where they would have been put down if they weren't taken. At least 20 of these dogs have been waiting more than a year. I'm not criticizing you for rescuing a dog from Cyprus as I'm sure they will be a loyal friend and you have saved a life. I just want more people in the UK to know that we do have a stray problem, even if dogs don't roam the street. If seems a little unnecessary to pay for flights when there are dogs waiting here. To me the only reasons to rescue a dog from abroad is if you have bonded with it (eg. Armed forces bringing dogs from Afghanistan) or you would like a specific breed that you can't rescue from this country."

Then call the rescues (especially any pit-specific rescue) and tell them you are willing to foster the dog until it's adopted if they'll pull it from the shelter. Let them know the dog is already vetted and transport arranged. You will almost always get satisfaction doing it this way. The rescues WANT to rescue the dogs. They just oftentimes don't have the space at their facility, dedicated foster homes, or funds to cover initial vetting. Good luck!"

I adopted a rescue in December.  He sat on Petfinder for four months while his brothers and sisters were gone within a week.  He was born with a deformed front leg - only one toe - the leg is much smaller than the other.  Had the little pup in this story not found a home, it's more than likely the breeder would have taken him to a shelter.  This is not to offend any breeders, and if I am wrong about my guess, I apologize.  Adopt 'imperfect' pets!  They are every bit as deserving of a loving home!"
rescuedogs,33umuq,rockthehearts,7,Sat Apr 25 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"The only thing that is worrisome here is the bile and diarrhea, she could have a food sensitivity and the food is making her feel sick or she might have a more serious problem. My guess though would be that it's just be from transitioning from the Alpo and will subside soon and also she could just be stressed from the move and adjustment to a new life! That might be contributing to her eating habits as well. But IANAV so please just call your vet about this if she continues to have diarrhea and vomit. She should be able to advise if it's something to be more worried about or if you can continue to try a couple things first before having to shell out the dough.  Something my vet asked us to try to ""test"" if our dog was getting sick or just being picky when she stopped eating her food was to make a plain scrambled egg. Dogs typically love eggs, I guess, so he said, if she happily eats all of that no problem, she's probably just being picky or doesn't like something about the food. If your dog can't eat eggs, you could also try rice and boiled chicken or turkey and see if she eats that.  If she checks out okay, and her diarrhea and vomiting subside over the next week, I would say her eating habits are totally normal!  Huskies are notoriously picky eaters and easily bored. When you say that she stops eating for a few days but then finally eats it all and then repeats the cycle, yeah, that's exactly what my husky mix does when she's just bored of eating the same thing everyday.    A husky can go days without food so one or even two days is definitely not going to kill her. Just make sure she's getting plenty of exercise and water and she will eat when she's hungry enough. My dog will not eat if she hasn't been exercised enough. Her favorite time to eat is after a good run and game of tug or ""kill the toy"" (When she tries to ""break it's neck"").  You could try different food but don't drive yourself crazy over it. My husky mix is on a crappy tasting Rx hypo allergenic diet that she simply hates but it is THE ONLY thing she is allowed to eat according to our vet so she doesn't get to get what she wants, even though she practically tries to starve herself in the hopes of getting to eat something better. Eventually, when she realizes that's all she's going to get, she happily eats it. She probably eats only 3/4 to 2 cups every day for a few days in a row, then goes nuts and eats like 4 cups in one sitting, then goes back to being super picky for a few days. It's not ideal but she's a healthy weight (maybe a little under but she's always been lean) and a very athletic, spry dog.  I would recommend against trying to ""spice"" up her foods with treats or broth as some people suggest with picky eaters. It will only make her think she can get you to give her better food by holding out and she will just keep upping the ante on it as soon as she gets bored of the new food again.  Some ways to make the food more enticing to her that I've tried and seems to work as long as I mix it up every few days:  Feeding all her food out of kongs and/or wobblers (my dog loves this one)  Mix the canned and dry food and freezing it in a Kong - for this one, I do sometimes stuff a soft treat in the tiny hole of the Kong to entice her into getting started since frozen foods don't smell that strong.  Mixing the canned and dry food in a blender with water to change up the consistency and momentarily ""trick"" her into thinking it's new - soak 2 cups kibble in boiling water to get it soft, let cool to room temp, put in blender with 1 can of food. Add water if needed. Should be thick but wet. You can freeze or refrigerate this for later too.   Play games with the food like hide it in boxes around the house and ask her to ""go find it!""."
rescuedogs,33umuq,hammy-hams,3,Sun Apr 26 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"Her diarrhea has subsided already thankfully, I think she threw up the bile due to not eating the previous day, or eating grass.  She is my first Husky, I never knew they were such drama queens! She'll sit on the couch and whine until I look at her, and start up again as I look away. Never know what she wants!   Thanks for all the advice though! :) I'll definitely have to try not to let it worry me too much. I'll watch her to make sure she's not acting sick or different for the next week just to be sure.  I've also tried so hard to get her some bones or toys, she just doesn't want to touch them. Only thing she likes is the ball she pulled out of the bin at a Pet Supplies store. I'll probably end up trying it out anyways, she might just change her mind again.  I'm glad I'm not the only one experiencing this, had me stressed out. Also I've noticed that she's kind of skittish, as if you might hit her when going to pet her. I'm hoping that means she's just getting used to it, and not that she was previously abused. If that is the case though, she's definitely going to need more time to get relaxed completely."

She's young and resilient and will be totally fine. She will also change a lot as you guys build your relationship so don't sweat every little issue or change in behavior. Huskies are a challenge in some areas but awesome and so rewarding.  My husky mix was also a rescue and came to us completely unaware of what toys even were. Some huskies just aren't too crazy about toys in general as well. They aren't really a ""fetch"" kind of dog. We had to train her how to play! It took a while but she does like to play with toys now.   There are some ways you can try, check out this link and see if that works over time. I also treated her every time she showed any interest in a toy, ball or bone and tried rubbing some smelly treats on them too to get her interested in sniffing and mouthing them.   This one sounds crazy but my SO said a trainer taught his parent this once with their dog and we tried it with our dog and it worked - you make rustling sounds like you are an animal in a bush while waving the toy in front of the dog and getting excited. Like a crinkly sound but with your mouth, repeat very rapidly, ""Shk, shk, shk. Crk, crk, crk"". I have no idea why that should work - I'm sure the dog knows you aren't a squirrel in a bush but it did work for his parents dog and it worked for us too, whatever that's worth!"

I'll probably take her to the pet store again and let her pick out her own toys and see if that goes anywhere. She's very playful too, so maybe the little trick will work on her. :)"
rescuedogs,33umuq,ohtheheavywater,4,Sun Apr 26 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting a rescue dog!  I have a former stray that I adopted from the shelter when he was about two, and he's fantastic.  When I got my dog, I went to a local vet that did free check-ups for recently adopted rescue dogs.  I think it was part meant as charity, to encourage people to adopt from the shelter instead of breeders, but mainly a tool to recruit new dog owners as patients.  You may be able to find a vet in your area that will do a free exam.  They'll probably still charge you for medication/tests, but you could at least get someone to take a look at the dog.  That would give you some peace of mind.  Some shelters will also let you come back in to see the shelter vet if your pet develops medical problems shortly after adoption.  You may want to call the shelter and see if their vet will take a look.  Those are some options if you decide that you want to go to a vet and you're low on funds.  I'm not an expert on whether to go to a vet, though, so I have no idea when that's needed.  That said, I know that my dog, Tiberius, does not eat when he's nervous.  And, because he's a rescue and he was really under socialized, he gets nervous a lot.  How is Ocea adjusting to living in a home?  Does she seem like she's settling in well in other ways?  Also, is she getting into anything that might upset her stomach (trash, chewing up your stuff, eating a lot of sweets)?"

I think she's adjusting great, from my view anyways. She loves stealing the bed or chair you want to sit on. :)  http://imgur.com/cdibGXn  She actually doesn't chew on anything, like almost at all. I was first giving her Greenies, but she seemed to eat them so fast I didn't want her to hurt herself, so I bought Blue Bones, which she ate a whole huge bag of, but now she won't eat them anymore. And any bone/hide/rib that I've bought her she's uninterested in. I'm surprised she doesn't touch the trash, my schnauzer would tear the trash apart and across the house!   Edit: I did forget to mention that sometimes she seems very skittish, as if whoever is trying to pet her much hurt her, it makes me sad. But I'm hoping its just a reflex, cause she absolutely hates her paws touched"

We make them sit for food and then they get 15 minutes to eat. I pull all the bowls with food after that. They get very limited treats with no schedule behind it. The snacks they do get are limited to cheese and freeze dried meats.  Just try to be patient with your pup, they are going through a lot of challenges."

That way if you get a dog that is a bad mix with your pet, you can just get more aggressive and find it a home.  Find the right dog who you love and is a good companion for your dog, then adopt it.  You then become what is called a failed foster, which is not a bad thing.   In the end you end to helping dogs in your search for another pet."

rescuedogs,33ux7t,WeavesByNightAndDay,3,Mon Apr 27 01:44:50 2015 UTC,"Getting our second dog was one of the best dog-related decisions we've ever made.  We went through the local humane society.  Our second dog had been in a foster home so we knew a good bit about her personality.  The other good thing was that if the dogs didn't get along in the first couple weeks the foster family would take her back.  My first dog has had some issues with space aggression and lack of socialization with other breeds, so I did have my concerns he wouldn't get along with her.  But transitioning her to our house was really easy, she's a very laid back dog.    She was 5-6 years old when we got her, which is older than a lot of people would like in a new dog, but I think was a big advantage.  She is really laid back and is just the easiest dog ever.    We have since added a third dog (which may qualify us as crazy-dog-people) that we picked out from the pound.  She's about two years old.  She was really scared at first and we had a lot of training to do with her, but having such a calm older dog around seemed to help her learn well.  They play together really well- running and chasing.  Please consider adding an older dog, so many of them get overlooked.  It might be nice to have a dog that is ""easy"" after doing so much training with the first, I know it was nice for me.  I'd recommend Patricia McConnell's booklet ""Feeling Outnumbered"" about multi-dog households, it was useful to me."
rescuedogs,33ux7t,giro_,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:56:43 2015 UTC,The advice I give to anybody looking to get a second dog is this: it's totally possible they won't get along. It took 1.5 years for my two to finally tolerate each other. They had to always be separated during that time: the younger one was in the crate. Now they can interact if supervised.
rescuedogs,33reiu,muisifer,3,Fri Apr 24 22:13:05 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss of your friend, but your pup will be in a good family. Try to keep in touch with them (if possible, to get pup updates) and at some point, when you're in a stable situation and can give a dog a forever home, you'll cross paths with your forever dog. I'm hoping for the best for both of yall."
rescuedogs,33reiu,atleast35,3,Sat Apr 25 01:02:10 2015 UTC,"I fully understand that there are situations where people have to surrender their dog; life can change a lot on the ~10 yrs that a dog lives, so it does happen.   When it does, every means necessary should be attempted before just dropping them off at the shelter i.e. friends of friends, family, rescue groups, I've even found homes for all my rescues through just going to dog parks, events, or even out to lunch with them in tow.   I just don't understand how you could have a 9month old dog that you already had to find a home for. The longest you had this dog was 7 months - that's just poor planning. Next time you get a dog, you need to seriously think about it long term and whether or not you are actually equipped to handle having a dog for the entirety of it's life."
rescuedogs,33reiu,thedogsdomain,5,Sat Apr 25 01:51:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the lesson, friend.   And in response, when I first adopted the dog, I was working from home 4 days a week. 3 months later, my department was cut and I lost my job. When I found a new job, after being unemployed for months, I no longer had the luxury of working from home. Long days meant that my dog was spending most of his time alone, in his crate so I decided that it was in everyone's best interest to find a new home for him.  But again, thanks for the lesson - surely things I had not previously thought of."
rescuedogs,33reiu,wickedwitch_,2,Sat Apr 25 02:01:32 2015 UTC,"I seriously hope that at the very least it was a no kill shelter. Otherwise, what the fuck."
rescuedogs,33reiu,thedogsdomain,6,Sat Apr 25 02:01:11 2015 UTC,"Sadly, many no-kill shelters only hold that title because they pass the unadoptable dogs on to organizations that do euthanize. Also, no kill shelters still do have rules that ""allow"" for euthanization, such as the dog displaying food aggression, and that is solely up to the interpretation and decision of the shelter."

Actually, when I had called for information a few weeks ago, the staff member I spoke to said it wasn't uncommon for animals to be there for upwards of 4 months and they even had a few who had been there 18 months and were still waiting for their perfect match. Definitely made me feel better knowing they weren't on a clock."

rescuedogs,33envk,TetrisArmada,2,Tue Apr 21 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"Check on petfinder.com, you can search for rescues near you. Please give him to a rescue, NOT a shelter. I'd suggest calling them, not emailing-- it's a lot harder to ignore an email than a person.  Also, that's not aggressive behavior, at all. It sounds like he needs to be with someone who can provide structure, exercise, and training. You didn't mention what kind of dog he is but it sounds like he's a herder and has a whole lot of energy. Crate training, exercise, structured walks, and mental stimulation will likely address all the issues you mentioned. Plus, he's a puppy. It's not weird for him to be energetic, nippy, or excitable. When you call the rescues, please don't describe him as aggressive, because that's absolutely not aggressive behavior."
rescuedogs,33envk,froyo4life,2,Mon Apr 27 18:04:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply :)  Ill need to get back onto the search process today, and I'm inclined to agree with you that he needs a much better structure in terms of his behaviors and expectations. I wasnt around long enough to try to give him more than the initial attempts to make him a better puppy, and it looks like my ex has given up trying.  He certainly deserves a better owner than either of us, that's for certain. Shelters, I'm really hoping, wont be an option since they'll just euthanize him for not getting taken home, and shelters also don't seem to care where the animals go, just that they're out of their facilities.  Ill give petfinders a try, thanks again, and ill be sure to keep in mind he just needs structure."

rescuedogs,32azx5,Iroshizuku,10,Sun Apr 12 04:50:12 2015 UTC,"As far as the grain free food, it is way more expensive but so much healthier. Most dog allergies come from the grains in food, so you should probably feed her something along those lines anyway.  For the rest of the issues, just because she had some litters of puppies and a big scar doesn't mean she wasn't loved before. Dogs end up in shelters for different reasons. Maybe her last owner always pet her right when they got home and allowed her to sleep in bed?  It is definitely harder to break and retrain a dog than to teach good habits in the first place. It sounds like you have a dog with a routine in mind.  If these things are a huge issue with you, stick to your guns (except maybe the food and water) and I'm sure your dog will eventually come around.  My dog has someone available to let him out all day at his leisure and he won't let anyone do it. He waits 12 hours everyday for me to get home from work. But, for the first 3 years of his life it was just the 2 of us. We lived in a smaller city where I was close enough to let him out in the morning, come home for lunch, and let him out again after work. To this day he sticks to that. He's just a creature of habit and very stubborn!   Good luck!   Edit: spelling"
rescuedogs,32azx5,acar87,2,Sun Apr 12 05:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I already bought the grain free food, but I just heard you're supposed to transition them. It's also a shame to waste an entire bag. But whatever, hah. I just thought it was insane that a dog would refuse to eat for that long.   You are right that she might not be as bad off as they shelter thought. They told me she was a stray and/or abused but clearly she has lived in a house before otherwise she wouldn't be housebroken, etc. I wonder if she ended up lost and nobody found her. I am not sure.   Do you think I should keep bringing her the water? That's really gross but it seems she only wants it on the couch. I don't want her to get dehydrated. She wouldn't even drink it when I brought it outside.  Very odd.  I also brought that up to the vet and he said again, dogs won't die of thirst, but who knows honestly.  Thanks for any thoughts."
rescuedogs,32azx5,acar87,3,Sun Apr 12 05:07:10 2015 UTC,You could try putting ice cubes in the water or freezing a treat in an ice cube and putting it in the water. That's what I had to do when I changed water bowls and my dog refused to drink out of it. It worked pretty well.  You could try giving her treats for laying on the floor/dog bed too. You can get small training treats at Petco or Petsmart. Anytime she does a desirable behavior give her one.  This could take weeks or even months for her to catch on (depending on how motivated she is by food) but it may be worth a try!
rescuedogs,32azx5,duchessofsephora,7,Sun Apr 12 14:27:53 2015 UTC,"I foster dogs and it's not uncommon that they don't want to eat for a few days after they are rescued. Also, most of them exhibit the same behavior with needing affection and wanting to be near people. Think about what she's been through. She was either a stray that was taken to a shelter lived there in a cold cell with loud barking all around her, or she was an owner surrender which is just as sad. I say spoil her, earn her trust, and give her faith in life again. A grain-free diet is great for her anyway so I think you should stick with it."
rescuedogs,32azx5,brillke,5,Sun Apr 12 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"I recently switched from Wellness Core Grain-Free to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Grain-Free dry dog food and my dogs absolutely love it and it's cheaper than most premium brands. This is the first dog food that my dogs wouldn't stop sniffing the bag when we brought it in. When we finally fed them some, they ate every bite with lots of enthusiasm. As an added bonus, Merrick dog food is made in the USA."
rescuedogs,32azx5,black_rose_,2,Sun Apr 12 08:09:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound like she's ""spoiled,"" it sounds like she has separation anxiety. It's the most common problem with pet dogs. Here is a guide that might help you.  When I fostered, foster dogs would often come into my house with major separation anxiety. Crying and whining when separated at bedtime was a common occurrence. You're lucky it's only 30  minutes. She will probably get over it after a while, especially if you keep being positive and try the things mentioned in the link.  Definitely avoid the harsh tones, and use positive reinforcement to train her. Like if she's grumbling about being ignored, keep ignoring her in a neutral way. When you notice she settles down and does her own thing, then you should go over and start petting and praising her. That way she learns that good things come from being independent. Rather than the reverse of bad things coming from human attention. Sounds like you're on the right track - adopting and training a dog how to be a good dog is always challenging."
rescuedogs,31tkxq,pleaseadoptmydog,25,Wed Apr 8 01:29:52 2015 UTC,"Please-- it truly seems that you love this dog. If that is true, do NOT take her to the shelter. Shelters usually mean the dog is going to be put down. If you've held out this long, you can keep her separated from your child until she has a safe home. Otherwise you rolling the dice with her life-- a life you promised to be responsible for when you got her.  A five year old dog is not going to be adopted in a shelter.

I've had all of my friends post on Facebook as well - but as it turns out it's hard finding a home for a dog that is aggressive towards children.  All the rescues won't take her because of 1)  She isn't a full breed ______ 2) They don't have any space (even after I offer to donate heavily) and 3) that whole she wants to kill children thing  Considering the dog has almost mauled my child twice - I think I'm setting an a-ok example of ""I valued your safety more than anything"".

She's a great dog, I love the hell out of her - but finding a home for a large animal that is aggressive to children is a hard fucking feat."

rescuedogs,31tkxq,mary-jane420,4,Wed Apr 8 02:26:32 2015 UTC,Please contact local rescues to see if they can take her in as a owner surrender. We are currently fostering a owner surrender and he already has apps for adopters.

rescuedogs,31tkxq,frackyou,3,Wed Apr 8 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the list.  I already called all these places, but the Humane Society seems like the best bet.  It's a no-kill shelter, which is where I've planned to take her all along.  I wanted to find a place that was ""better"" or find her a home direct, which is why I chose this sub."
rescuedogs,31tkxq,frackyou,12,Wed Apr 8 20:16:11 2015 UTC,What if you rehomed the child? Seems like the dog has been there longer.
rescuedogs,31tkxq,hotsauce540,8,Wed Apr 8 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but it's so wrong and so rude to try to make someone feel bad about re homing a pet. OP is being very responsible by recognizing that the current arrangement is not fair for those involved, and is taking the steps to make sure the dog still has a loving home where it can be happy.   And, it really doesn't matter how long the animal has been around. No animal will ever come before a child you've given birth to."
rescuedogs,31tkxq,phidel_kashflow,6,Wed Apr 8 05:33:38 2015 UTC,"I can't believe you have 9 down votes.  You're 100% right.  When we got Sadie (as a rescue) we had no idea she was aggressive to kids.  We also didn't expect to have a child.  I've always been a responsible dog owner, but more than that I need to be a responsible parent.  Having a 90 lb aggressive ANIMAL around my 30 lb child is a poor decision.  We've kept them separate for over a year - but I can see how miserable the dog is."
rescuedogs,31tkxq,brillke,7,Wed Apr 8 12:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yep.. This subreddit seems to have some mixed up priorities as someone telling you to re home your child has a bunch of up votes.   Either way,  I don't care about the down votes, I still stand by what I said."
rescuedogs,31tkxq,brillke,0,Wed Apr 8 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"As you should. People couldn't even offer a rebuttal to you. No rebuttal, no advice, no EMPATHY. Jokes win and this woman is where she was when she asked for some understanding and some help.  And as for people telling OP not to take it to a shelter - they are the same ones who would demand a shelter in other circumstances. They most likely DO NOT have children and are college kids/20somethings who got their rescues (AT SHELTERS) because ""Dude, free dog.""  Now they see what it takes to raise a dog and think they know better than others.   OP - don't even stress about it and don't even come back to this sub. You know what's best for your family.  FTR - some shitty snark was at top when I replied."
rescuedogs,31tkxq,nutsaq,4,Wed Apr 8 13:29:02 2015 UTC,"I am one of those people telling her not to take it to a shelter. I tell her this because there are many other options. I know this because I foster dogs and have found homes for over two-dozen dogs in 3 years. I'm not a 20 something with no responsibilities thank you very much.  The commenter who made the joke was doing just that-- making a joke. Let's be real here and not pretend we thought otherwise.  I think if she is capable of posting here, she can easily locate a rescue to take the dog. Hitting a few keys on the computer one night, giving up and then dumping the dog at the shelter the next morning isn't being a responsible dog owner. Period."
rescuedogs,31tkxq,nutsaq,2,Wed Apr 8 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"You said in a previous comment that ""I'll probably get a puppy in a few years and forget all about this dog"".  If people want to make generalizations about me, I suppose it's only natural that they make them about you.  I posted on Reddit because I'm willing to literally (and I mean this) transport this dog anywhere in the fucking country to find a good home.  I've ran out of options locally, so if you think I've just ""hit a few keys"" you can go fuck yourself.  It's been a nightmare trying to keep my dog and child separate for the last year, and I can tell how miserable it's making the dog.  So now is your chance to be that fucking hero that you claim to be.  Find me a good home, anywhere in the continental US - and I'll transport her there.  I'm not fucking kidding - because I do love the shit out of this dog."

I don't think she has an assessment or statement because the Dog hasn't seen a vet yet. This is just the average cost of this particular type of surgery."
rescuedogs,31mgiy,TheRoadHome,2,Tue Apr 7 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"While I really feel for her, if she can't afford the $1500 should she really be getting this dog?  I mean that's one surgery, anything happens down the line and she is going to be asking for more money.    I'm all for her getting this dog, but I am afraid if she can't afford it what will happen if something goes really bad?     Beyond that, she posts know information about the actual costs.  She says that's the cost, but if she posted vet estimates, the part of her lease that says she needs a big deposit, that would help her case."
rescuedogs,31mgiy,TheRoadHome,-1,Mon Apr 6 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"While I may agree with you, you offer no alternative. The reality of the situation is that if we do not help her then the dog dies. So what are you suggesting we do?"
rescuedogs,31mgiy,TheRoadHome,2,Mon Apr 6 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"I don't have an alternative.  I really, really hope hope it happens, but I fear for things like this.  If things end up going sideways for her and he needs another expensive surgery the dog ends up being put down or something."
rescuedogs,31mgiy,TheRoadHome,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"Then at least she can say she tried. Your concern is what I like to call ""LIFE"" -- 20,000 people (mostly children) die every day from starvation. I can't afford to take the physical or financial responsibility it takes to help, but I am willing to give a little to a good cause. If there are other out there like me then it's safe to say that as long as one person is willing to put in the time and effort then there will be others like myself willing to support them financially."
rescuedogs,31mgiy,TheRoadHome,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"If she wants to be taken seriously and raise the funds she is going to have to post some more information.  She needs vet estimates, adoption costs, and the deposit she needs.  Right now she wants to be taken at her word.  I have been in rescue long enough to see scans like this take people for hundreds of dollars.    Don't get all preachy at me about not caring.  I know if at least 3 on going investigations concerning adoption scams like this.  I made the mistake of falling for one of them a few years ago based on nothing but a sob story like this.     I've worked hard enough in my life to have enough resources to donate both my time and my money to help animals and I do so a lot.  However, if you ask for money, try harder than ""I need money for stuff."" People deserve to be shown what they are donating to.    I'd be more than willing to help get donations for her, if she actually provided proof.  I have rescue friends from all over the US and chances are a lot of them would be more than happy to help, provided she shows us where the money is going."

rescuedogs,2z8x2g,meghugs,8,Mon Mar 16 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"The word that makes everyone cringe. DRUGS.  I adopted a small Beagle Bassett mix. Had 2 other great dogs.  All got along great.  Except Jake came with severe separation anxiety.  Forget a crate, he not only tore it up, but self-injured by slamming himself against it.  Tried leaving him out with the other 2 - nah, just freaked out, tore everything up  - removed a wall to wall carpet from the floor at 20# in just 15 minutes. I went the Clomicalm route (prozac was not an option then).  Long story short - he's been with me 7 years, other 2 dogs have passed, and he is alone all day. NO ISSUES at all. Bothe the vet and trainer were in agreement that it was worth a try.  After 1 week, he could play with the others, be left on his own when I went out.  No damage at all.    Not everyone agrees with this solution, but it worked for him.  He is now on a minimal dose 2x a day and his life is good.  And the house is intact.  As for the pulling on the leash, put him in a harness.  Either the Gentle Walker, or a regular harness.  The Gentle walker will stop the pulling.  As for the leash, I put the loop around my wrist, and I knot the leash in 3 or 4 places.  So if I have to draw hime back, there's not slipping, I just grab a knot.   BTW, drugs do NOT make them sleepy after they titrate a therapeutic dose for them, but make them far more managible and trainable.  When you go out - fill a Kong with some peanut butter and freeze it.  Will keep him busy for some time. Other things I do - radio on before I leave, just everyday music/talk.  I also have a ""special treat"" just for when I go out.  Gets one when I go and gets another when I come home.  Also when you leave, have a saying - same one every day.  ""watch the house"" is usually what I say. Has no meaning for him, but the repetitiveness of it reassures him I will return.  Sorry for the wall of text here - hope it helps. And as for expense - if you go puppy prozac - it's about $3 a month. Good luck.... and be patient"
rescuedogs,2z8x2g,3houndsmom,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:58:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here. I know a lot of people (including myself) don't like the thought of life long behavioral modification through medication..... but when all else fails it is a good option. It reduces stress in the dog as well as with you and the rest of your house hold!  My only advise is to use medication as a last option when no other training techniques are working. The first thing I would try is to TIRE HIM THE HECK OUT before going in the crate. Literally leaving him with no energy. You can do this by running with him in the morning, teaching him to run alongside a bicycle or just playing a heck of a lot of intense fetch for 30 minutes. A 20 minute leisurely walk in the morning isn't enough to totally exhaust him.  Once he's tired, you're dealing with the chemical anxiety, rather than pure energy, so it's easier to deal with/see the extent of his problem. Try it out on a day you have totally free. Get him exhausted then put him to bed for an hour or two (if he's calm and quiet). If that works out, do it again later that day and leave him in the crate a little longer..... extend the amount of time he's crated until he can stay all day. If he still reacts in an anxious way, even after being absolutely exhausted, medication may be the only route for you, which is fine!  Good luck! Pm me if interested. Also, sorry for typos... on mobile."
rescuedogs,2z8x2g,ShiftyEyesMcGee,2,Mon Mar 16 22:38:34 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with tiring him out.  My guy, when he removed the carpeting and shredded it, had just been on a 30 minute - 3 mile ""hike"".  He was tired out, but when I took the next dog out (one was still home, so not really ""alone""), he freaked. I was so completely opposed to meds.  Took him to training class and he spent most of the time in ""time out"" - b/c he was a complete distraction to the class.  The trainer had spoken with the vet.  She encouraged me to try it.  So I did.  Literally the next week at the class, he was an angel.  Did everything, learned everything on the first try.  And honestly, out of ALL the dogs I've ever had, he is by far the smartest. He was more like a kid with ADD. Got the meds, new dog.  His dosage has been reduced significantly, and he is on a minimal dosage now. To this day, he practices all the things we learned in class.  He loves toys that make him think.  It was a sanity saver for both of us.  I never got mad at him, b/c he always looked like I was going to hurt him when he tore things up, but it became evident very quickly that it really was out of his control."

rescuedogs,2ykmiy,WOgles,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:09:56 2015 UTC,How can you not foster fail?
rescuedogs,2ykmiy,mrdat,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:57:29 2015 UTC,She's our 3rd foster puppy and I could have failed with any of them :).  For now I've got to keep fostering - I can save more puppies that way.  It isn't as hard to give them up when you know they're going to great homes.  I get photos and videos of my previous fosters loving life and that is so rewarding!
rescuedogs,2ykmiy,mrdat,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly our thought! The rescue group we work with gives us crap for not failing and I keep explaining, if we adopt, we're done fostering... they reconsider very quickly. :)   Yeah, I love having new doggies to take photos of. Our own dog gets tired having a camera in her face all the time."
rescuedogs,2ylir3,TooSleepyRN,3,Tue Mar 10 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"I rent and that was an issue. I told the rescue renting was short term, and it is. I talked about how I love to hike, enjoy long walks, and am looking for an activity buddy as well as a friend and how the pup would fit into that lifestyle. He totally did by the way! Renting doesn't impact my dogs quality of life at all as I am very active and he goes with me everywhere. He is rarely alone for more than 4-6 hours at a time. Just be honest, show them who responsible you are, and show you can provide a good, stable home. Maybe get a letter of recommendation from your landlord and friends or have your parents come with you to show that the dog will worst case scenario go with your folks come hard times (which happens).   If you are 21 and have some financial stability, you should be fine. The main concern where I am with undergrad aged adults is that there are a TON of undergrads that adopt a dog at the beginning of the year or with their first environment, realize how much of an investment it is or move, and give the animal back to the shelter. In May, our shelters are overrun and it is horrible and sad. Some of the private rescue organizations are snooty. I get why they do it, they want to ensure pets are going to a good home, but sometimes they take it a bit far and reject good pet owners because they don't fit their mold. MOST county shelters are less stringent."
rescuedogs,2ylir3,safescience,2,Sat Mar 14 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"You may be able to put in an application and ask them if age is negotiable, depending on how well you fit their profile for acceptable adopters.   But I think their reasoning behind this could be they are trying to weed out single ""kids"" or young adults who may not be so financially situated and stable, have to rent a place to live because they have recently moved out of the family house and may not totally be up to the real commitment to owning an animal and taking care of something else for the next  10-15 years (just met a 19 year old beagle today, so possibly even a 20 year commitment), and want a dog because puppies are cute. Like some kind of ""maturity marker"", 25 must be their magic number. They may also have this policy in place because they are looking for patient adopters who will be willing to put training into a puppy. Generally younger owners put in less training.    They are probably looking for adopters who are financially comfortable home owners or very experienced renters with a partner or family with extensive references on hand."

I just don't want to give up hope on Poppy and Bella.   This is the Facebook page which has more info on Poppy and Bella, along with the occasional update. So far, we have heard nothing in the two years that they have been missing. I was scammed by a few ""missing pet companies,"" and so far my best resources have been Lost Dogs of Texas and Craigslist. However, these are geographically limited.   If they are still alive, they could be anywhere. I still post to the San Marcos craigslist with these images, just in case they're still around. However, I know that chance is small that they're still around San Marcos. Please, please share. I just want them home."

rescuedogs,2y79nd,jeahs21,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"This is my pit mix zoey. I adopted her almost a year ago through craigslist. She is about 1.5 years old, spayed, and has all her shots. I am no longer able to afford my rent and have to move from an apartment to a room, so I am no longer able to provide a home for her. She's dog aggressive for sure, so she needs a home without any other animals. I'm not sure how she is with children. She also has a condition called megaesophagus. I've been trying to find a new home for her for a few months now without any luck. No-kill shelters who claim to be ""pit lovers"" constantly say they have no room for her because of the fact that she's dog-aggressive..which is like saying hey we love pits, but not their natural behavior.... It makes no sense. It's frustrating. She is a typical pitbull- loving, energetic, loyal to her human and so beautiful. This dog needs someone who is experienced with the breed. And much patience. Please help!"

rescuedogs,2x62ts,colleenckaiser,2,Thu Feb 26 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge about half of my fosters over the past 9 years have gotten new names from their new families.   Some people are excited to pick a new name, others seem to want to keep the old name because they 'don't want to confuse the dog'.  The dogs really don't care a bit and can learn a new name in no time, but I find it interesting how their adopting families approach the naming."
rescuedogs,2x62ts,FreeThinker76,2,Thu Feb 26 14:58:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I experience same thing. I always try to name them with names people would like to keep. Some fosters name their dogs ""noodle, mouse, lil'captain, etc.. Names that beg to be changed."

rescuedogs,2x4dlo,giro_,4,Wed Feb 25 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"I was bottle feeding them every 2-3 hours. It all depends on how much each of them ate during the feeding. That first picture she polished off half a bottle, so she was good for 6 or so hours."
rescuedogs,2x4dlo,MargaretCharles,5,Wed Feb 25 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"That must be so tiring! Our newly adopted dog had surprise puppies a few days after we adopted her. She had some health problems we had to get her on medicine for so we had to wean the puppies at about 3 or 4 weeks old. We soaked some puppy kibble in formula so that it was soft enough to eat, and eventually switched to soaking it in water after a couple more weeks. I just want to say, muffin tins are your friends! It works great to portion it all out while giving each puppy its own little bowl.   Good luck!"

rescuedogs,2wplx3,InsecureLemon,5,Sun Feb 22 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"You should set up a meet and greet with the dogs you are interested in and decided which one is the one you would like most and so on, then fill out the application for that one once you figure it out. Go in person and fill out an application to show your interest, the organization can also figure out easier if you and the pup are a good fit together."
rescuedogs,2wplx3,Busty_Beaver,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"Oopsies: many of my ""Favorited dogs"" aren't anywhere near the east coast. Internet searches, a love/hate relationship, </3  I'd love to do that-- I know it's the best way to meet the doggy and see its personality, but a lot of meet-and-greets for the dogs I am looking would be kinda-sorta.... Well, not impossible, but tiring, potentialy expensive, and.... Ugh. I thought about that, though. I live on the East Coast (MD), but did a rather large-radius search. (Maybe nation-wide. I forget) Going to a meet-and-greet for a dog somewhere in CA would be.... very inconvenient-- and rather expensive, if the trips to different states kept adding up.   If the trip/s were to pick up a dog that I already set my heart on, I'd gladly fly there and find some way back... (I'm guessing airlines won't agree on making hourly potty breaks, hahaha. Unless I like, dump the pad in the garbage in the bathroom....) Hm, well, that is a concern to deal with if and when it is reached.   I was hoping that, if the puppy my heart starts digitally clinging to my heart from across the county, I could make a rather interview-like call to the shelter/foster and demand a rundown the X's traits and what not. The other problem internet-search adoption is that I'm ""competing"" against other families/people. Although shelters don't do first-come, first-serve matching, they process the apps in order. I feel like, that if I wait to fill out an application one at a time, or even hop on a plane to meet the little thing, the dogs I like will have been snatched up. And, although this may not sound like one of the best reasons, I'd live to bring home the new ""family baby"" soon-ish."
rescuedogs,2wplx3,Busty_Beaver,1 point,Sun Feb 22 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"And here I was responding thinking it was through rescues in the area, apologies.   As for shelter applications I would do it in a mass application send out because I think a lot of them approve adopters on a stance of being able to support a dog and treating a dog properly rather than a match up with a certain dog. So being approved once you find a dog would put you ahead of the game."
rescuedogs,2wplx3,Busty_Beaver,1 point,Sun Feb 22 02:49:14 2015 UTC,"Also doing a search for rescues in Maryland brought up some results.   Rescues usually have higher adoption fees, but they go to help the other animals or to cover the partial costs that the animal incurred with them. But from the animals I have seen with the rescues in my area the dogs are more socialized, potty trained and leash trained. But you are looking for a puppy so those would be things you would be teaching it.   From what I know you would still have to go meet the animal before having shipped on an airline, I think that is required by law, but not totally sure. Unless you had some one who could transport it to you."
rescuedogs,2wplx3,Busty_Beaver,1 point,Sun Feb 22 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"It's okay! I didn't really make that clear.  Do you have any links to your search results? I'd love to see them. And fees are not a (terribly huge) concern, but I'd like to keep it below $500, especially if plane tickets are coming into play.  I decided a while ago that I would prefer a puppy, or at least fairly young dog. I'd love to adopt a senior some day, but for my first canine friend, (assuming that I'd like dogs enough to chose another companion eventually) I'd like to have the honor and emotional....ness of watching it grow beside me. And be the one guiding it!  In regards to transporting the dog---I'm not entirely sure how that process would best be carried out. I know some shelters will transport the dog for you to a local partner/branch in the area, but what if the transportation falls on me? I don't know too much about different airline's pet policies, but I looked briefly at Southwest's. The dog's carrier/crate would either have to be small enough to fit under the seat (which brings in the problem of potty breaks), or go in the luggage space.... And I don't really think the latter option is very, uh, ""nice"" way to travel? Especially for a young puppy. Is that space even heated?"
rescuedogs,2wplx3,Busty_Beaver,2,Sun Feb 22 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"Most shelters are not going to have the resources to help ship or transport an animal across the U.S, animals that they are able to do that with would probably be through volunteers who would be willing to drive a certain distance to hand off to another volunteer. Many shelters restrict adoptions to people only living in that particular state or they will even round down as small as to only people living in that county. Make sure to check for that before getting too attached online.   From what I understand (a coworker was recently looking to get a particular breed of cat that is not very common from a breeder as hers had recently passed and she was passionate for the breed.) you are required by law to see the animal before it goes on to the plane for shipping, I believe that this is so the person ""handing out"" the animal has seen an actual person through the process, but that may only be for breeders as that's who the situation involved.   Potty breaks on the plane are most likely not going to be a thing. An airline approved kennel with potty pads is probably as nice of an accommodation as you will come by. It would most likely be at least slightly scary/terrifying for an animal (regardless of age) to travel in a crate on an airline, but for some dogs traveling in a car can be just as scary.   Have you had any experience with dogs in the past? Or puppies? Puppies are destructive toddlers that can get into any trouble; destroying your favorite shoes, electronic devices, chewing every corner of that one particular blanket you've had for years.... You get the idea. They are definitely something that you need to be prepared for and have decided you could deal with your favorite (or any) possessions being chewed/peed/pooped on in the process of your puppy growing and you training it. Puppies are a lot of work, which can be very rewarding, but how much work you would realistically be willing to put into a dog is something very important to keep in mind.   Another thing to keep in mind is that the puppies you do see at rescues and shelters are going to be adopted fast, just explicitly because they are puppies. A good choice for a first time dog owner (or first time owning a dog by your self) is a dog between 6 months to 2 years old. This still gives you a lot of range, dogs that could already be socialized to a certain point, most likely than not they will be potty trained also (if with a rescue).    The Maryland Animal Sanctuary and Rescue, a 501 (c) (3), has dogs/puppies listed on their site.  http://www.masrescue.org/pets.html  They also have an outline of their adoption process.   There is also the Small Miracles Cat and Dog rescue listed in Maryland that has many animals of different age groups (mostly puppies it looks like though from what they have on Petfinder) available and is also listed as a 501 (c)(3) and also have a facility you are able to visit.  http://www.smallmiraclesrescue.org"

You've highlighted a few things that I didn't think were that important, and you've given me some things to re/consider. I will try to narrow my search to the tri-state area, and look more for shelters that may not be as capable of caring for the animal as an organized rescue may be.    I'm pretty sure I want a puppy, or at least a dog around 1yr, just because have this really weird desire to train and raise it myself. Though coming pre-potty trained would be a nice convenience! I'm just gonna have to put things up a little higher, I guess. Like my shoes. Oh, my precious shoes.   Again, thank you so much!

It might help her to have a basket muzzle on when alone so she won't chew off her bandages.    I'd definitely go for the amputation - my baby girl is a tripod and gets along just fine on three legs - as it sounds like that's what she's asking you to do for her."
rescuedogs,2w9qdc,beeasaurusrex,1 point,Wed Feb 18 06:36:26 2015 UTC,I saw some at petco when I was getting the ecollar and paused. I dont know much about muzzles and didnt know if it was safe to leave her in one while I was away at work..
rescuedogs,2w9qdc,phoenix523,1 point,Wed Feb 18 12:47:49 2015 UTC,"If shes crated and you have somebody check in on her with relative frequency, they are.  All a good muzzle will do is prevent her from getting anything into her mouth. Train up very slowly - get her used to it and to associate it with good things - and she shouldn't fight it.  The only real risk if it fits and fastens properly is having her rub her muzzle on it and lose some fur with skin irritation."
rescuedogs,2w9qdc,dogGirl666,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:33:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to do more research on this...it may be less stressful than the whole collar which she has trouble walking with. It just weirds her out and she won't go anywhere with it on. Thanks for the information!
rescuedogs,2w9qdc,dogGirl666,2,Thu Feb 19 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"If she's not a mouthy dog it probably will be less stressful, but keep her away from other dogs and 'big' environments (dog parks, busy sidewalks, etc) while she's wearing it until you know how she'll react.  Otherwise she can develop reactivity to feeling unable to defend herself.  :)    For a lot of dogs who chew impulsively (which is pretty common in fosters), taking away the physical ability to chew is what calms them down.  While an e-collar will make it difficult, or at least frustrating, it doesn't physically stop them from getting anything into their mouth...which obviously the muzzle will, so it's totally worth a shot.    I'd go with something like this.  Doesn't have to be the same brand, but you want something with a between-ears strap with a lot of flexibility so she can lay down, yawn, scratch itches (using the muzzle), and drink comfortably.  She could easily chew through one of the wire mesh or leather muzzles, let alone plastic, so you want something with heavy duty wire like the one in the link.  (You can find ones that are relatively enclosed, too, so she can't fit a foot in there through the bars.)    This is a really good force-free guide to muzzle training.  It'll take a couple weeks before you can/should crate her unsupervised with the muzzle on, but hey, no time like the present to start!    I'd talk to your vet and see about their recommendations, too.  Good luck!"

rescuedogs,2w1pus,audriquill,7,Mon Feb 16 05:13:13 2015 UTC,"Full Story: Last Saturday night I spotted an adorable Golden Retriever-looking puppy at the park. I tried for over an hour to get him to come to me, but even with food he would only come within ten feet. I saw him run out into the street and almost get hit several times, and I felt horrible when I had to leave him at the park that night. I went back Sunday morning and spent over four hours trying to coax him towards me, but he was only growing more and more wary of me the longer I spent trying. At this point I knew he was just way too scared to come to me on his own, and so I rented a humane trap to see if I couldn't catch him that way. When I went back to the park Monday afternoon to set the trap up, however, I saw that the little golden puppy was running around with an all-black terrier who unfortunately was just as wary of people as her friend. I set up the trap, and was hoping that I could somehow bait them one at a time and save them both. By some miracle, after the trap had only been set for about five minutes, both puppies entered it at the same time and were caught together! They were pretty scared at first, but have really come around and are snuggly, playful, happy dogs.   I took them to the vet but neither had a microchip. I put up some signs around my neighborhood and the park, but nobody has called and unfortunately I don't think that anybody is really looking. I have two dogs of my own and live in a very small (600 square foot) apartment, so I cannot keep them. I found an amazing Golden Retriever rescue to take the golden-looking puppy, but I'm still looking for placement for the black terrier, Holly. The vet said she is around 12-18 months old, and she really is just the sweetest dog. If there are any rescues in Texas that have room for her, please PM me! I am willing to transport and provide a donation towards her care!"

I'm 99% finished adopting a Pitbull/Boxer mix (brindle color!) She's 2 years old, fixed, and will be current on all her shots after I pay the adoption fee, but there is one huge fuck off issue: she's heartworm positive. The shelter representative told me that if I adopt, she'll be given the heartworm treatment at no cost to me, but I will need to pay for the follow up antibiotic drugs and heartworm medicine. I can't take her home until this Wednesday because the treatment is a two day affair.   Once I take her home she's mine, but I need to maintain a routine heartworm preventative regime. Now, my question is, even though she'll be treated, should I follow through with buying a dog with a fatal heart condition? Isn't this like buying a car that has a big sticker on it that says ""EXPLOSIONS POSITIVE,"" but the dealer says they'll totally get rid of those 'splosions as soon as I sign on the dotted line.

Even if you were to adopt a different dog, you would still need to pay for heartworm pills. And that's not a big expense, btw-- I get them from my vet for under $10 a month.  Also, my dog was heartworm positive when I adopted him and he's 100% fine now.

I also like to walk around in public with an ""adopt me"" bandana on our foster dogs, people always get interested and ask questions then know someone that is looking for a dog. These encounters don't always follow through but its worth a shot!  I used to work with a really great rescue in Maine, if you pm me I can get you their contact, I bet they'd cross post for you."
rescuedogs,2vwyl3,ShiftyEyesMcGee,2,Sat Feb 14 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I'll definitely try the adopt me bandana.   Originally we were led to believe that the dog was in a certain rescue, but then later we were told she was being fostered originally by a friend of the rescue and she was a courtesy post. It's very confusing, and at this point we don't actually know which rescue she belongs too. I don't think they'll take her back, and I would hate for something bad to happen to her in all this confusion. We have her original papers stating she was from the animal shelter but not much more than that.  I used to do a lot of cat rescue work, and I understand dogs are harder in a lot of aspects, but this whole thing strikes me as highly unprofessional. Yet I understand that many people who are involved in these organizations have their own jobs/lives to tend to as well. I'm trying not to get too frustrated here.    What I want more than anything is for her to find her own forever home. I really really want her to be happy, safe, and healthy. She's a great dog and after all that she's been through it's what she deserves."
rescuedogs,2vwyl3,ShiftyEyesMcGee,2,Sat Feb 14 23:54:56 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah, I totally understand. Rescues are hard when everyone has full time jobs, kids, their own pets, their own fosters etc.... In the end, running a rescue is basically running a business and not everyone is cut out for that! I've had similar frustrations while fostering before.  I would still try telling them that your animals are in an UN-SAFE situation and ask that they find a foster family willing to take her. Also, do ask other rescues to do a courtesy posting for you to reach as many people as possible.  Good luck :)"

rescuedogs,2vo7dv,lyyphe23,3,Thu Feb 12 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"I've been in rescue now for a few years and started a Doberman rescue in Georgia last year. So I'll share my advice with you.   First, check on what your state requires. For example, in GA the department of agriculture requires all rescues to have a shelter license (whether you are foster run or shelter run). This requires being registered as a business in the state (which will be required no matter where you are).   Second, get a solid board of directors with people you know you can trust and work with. My first years in rescue were with a woman who it turns out was stealing money from the rescue. When I found out, I resigned and the rescue ended up going under. You may think ""who would do such a thing"" and the answer is A LOT of people. Get references and check them. Make sure the people you work with are legit.   Get your 501(c)(3). There's no reason not to. It costs $400 and you CAN do it yourself. I did ours. It takes a long time, the form is daunting, but it's no big deal. And make sure when you incorporate that you include the required text for the 501(c)(3).  Send in your application BEFORE you begin regular operations. It will make the part about the finances MUCH easier.   Do not beg for money. If people see you begging they will assume you don't know how to properly run your finances. There is a time and place to beg. If you take in a dog that is serious and goes way beyond the normal cost, that's okay. But don't beg for spays and neuters and such.   Dreamhost has free hosting for 501(c)(3)'s. Don't pay for website hosting.   That's most of my advice. If I can think of other things I'll come back later. Good luck!"

I agree with everything, especially about finding a board that you trust and works well together. Don't try to do this on your own... I've volunteered for a rescue that was basically run by one woman. She was wonderful, but it's way too much work to do on your own, especially if you're fostering as well, and it put extra strain on me as a volunteer when I couldn't get a hold of her.  My add on advise is to get comfortable with social media if you aren't already. Having a facebook, twitter and tumbler feed for your rescue is very valuable! Encourage foster parents to update you with stories and pictures as much as they are able, and share those anecdotes about each dog. People can get very attached to a dog before they even meet them (which is good and bad!) by reading funny stories and seeing loads of cute pictures.  Good luck! I'd love to see an update when things get rolling!"

rescuedogs,2vo7dv,DeeDee304,1 point,Fri Feb 13 00:10:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, social media is key.  Facebook is switching over to a ""pay to play"" model now though, where unless you pay to boost posts, very few people are likely to see them.  We still use Facebook heavily, but Instagram is what we're moving to more now.  Another thing I forgot....insure your rescue.  God forbid someone takes in a foster dog that ends up biting them or destroying their house.  This will cover you against that and keep you form having to pay medical bills out of pocket.  It was tough for us to find insurance since they don't want to cover Doberman rescues because they are an ""aggressive breed"" (bullshit...) but you definitely want to have that.  Another thing...have an extensive application.  Nothing absolutely nuts, but ask important questions.  We use our applications as part of our adoption contract.  if it turns out they lied about something on the app, and we somehow didn't catch it with our vet reference or home visit and it come sup after, the contract is null and void and we take the dog back.  One last HUGE piece of advice I can give, and some people don't want to hear this...know when to say ""no"".  If you do not have room for a dog, or if you do not have funds for a dog, say no.  It's hard, but in order to keep a rescue from going under,r you have to be able to say no.  Sometimes there are cases where you have to take them in for one reason or another...something compels you...but let it be few and far between.  Be logical, be reasonable.  If you take in too many dogs and your rescue goes bankrupt than not only the dogs you have, but future dogs you could have saved will suffer.  Saying no to that one dog sucks...but it means you can save others down the line.  I have seen WAY too many rescues run themselves into the ground."

rescuedogs,2vfcwo,opalwednesday,3,Tue Feb 10 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"I had one of those.  Try this - take an older used sock - yep, just recently worn - and tie knots it in. Tube socks work best. Something sturdy.  Make sure he gets a good sniff of it. Toss it in the air, and run towards it. He may or may not follow. If not keep doing it.  Now, if he goes for it, you have to get all excited like it is the best thing. If he goes for it, make a fuss and go get it from him.  Don't be too aggressive about it, make sure he is not resource protective, or you may come back a few fingers short.   If he lets you, play tug of war with him.    Another thing is Kongs. The beehive shapes ones. Fill them with small training treats and roll it towards him. give him one treat so he knows what is in there. be persistent and scheduled with playtime, he will probably catch on.  There are some dogs who like squeaky toys, and they will try to disembowel them (rip them up) and those who do not like them.  I have one who does not like them.  He prefers ""intellectual"" toys, i.e. find the treat.  My guy is food motivated.  We have all kinds of puzzles now.  but he will engage in tug of war with old socks a few times a week.    How about tennis balls? If he doesn't know how to play, getting him to return it could cost you a treat until he catches on.   He's a handsome guy - good luck and have fun trying to find what makes him happy! Perhaps a walk through the toy aisle at PetSmart will help him find something that peaks his interest."

rescuedogs,2v188v,ja_14,3,Fri Feb 6 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"Have him crate the dog when not directly interacting with him. This is a gift to the dog, not a punishment -- it is giving the dog an inviolate place of his own, a safe haven. I have two rescues who had had been left outside for five years before I got them, and one of them immediately began chewing on every single thing. Living room set, electrical cords -- everything.   I knew who the original breeder was, explained the situation and asked her for advice.  She told me to put them down or, if I couldn't personally, drive them to her place and she'd shoot them for me. Why? ""Because those dogs will never take to being crated or living indoors. It's like punishment to them and they'll tear your whole place up and themselves as well.""  Instead, I bought two 80 inch crates via craigslist. Strong wire ones, so they could see out but not eat through. And I made up a song and sang it as I introduced them to the crates. The second night i sang it as I placed a treat inside and closed the door. The third night I simply sang the song, and that's all I've ever needed to do since that third night.   Every night, I sing their ""good night song"", and at the first word they come from wherever they are and each goes into her own crate and lies down -- by some dog thing they decided on their own, they are careful never to go into the other's crate.   At mealtimes (they're fed in their crates so as not to fight over food), or if they are too rambunctious, I say ""Go to your room"" and they run to the crate.   If they are already tired, they put themselves to bed, just walking in and lying down.  In the beginning, I couldn't put a bed or blankets or ANYTHING into the crates, as they would tear whatever I put in into pieces. After that first winter, I really wanted them to have some relief from their joints and bare crate floor, so I  bought baby and toddler comforters from the thrift store, figuring I could afford to keep spending a dollar or two per day at the thrift store if they'd eventually lie on them and wake with intact blankets.   First they resisted, pushing past me into the crates and not letting me lay the blankets down, then pushing the blankets aside and lying on the hard crate floor. Within a week, tho -- they stood outside the crates instead and looked at me til I laid the blankets down for them. They also stopped tearing up the toys I bought them.   Now, 2 years after I got them, I can trust them to be alone and uncrated for up to an hour if I'm elsewhere in the house. So much has changed from the day they set foot indoors for the first time in their lives and would cower if I so much as picked up a broom in another room, or tried to pet or stroke out tangles.   It is unimaginably obvious how calming it is to them to know there is a place that is their place -- the crate, and outside of it the warmth of our hearts and our home and the certainty that both are  theirs forever no matter how nuts they may make me as they (and I!) learn little steps in getting along with others.   It's a HUGE testament to your neighbor what he's done for this dog, a testament to how much he really does love him and want things to work out.   Ask him to try this. Tell him I know what he has gone through -- I, too, spend thousands of dollars on these dogs in the first year that I CERTAINLY never thought I'd gladly do when first i got them. $300 bucks per bottle for the one who was on the highest pain meds you could get due to being thrown a bag of dog food every two weeks for her first five years. Their own freezer, to house the raw food that allowed her to go off those pain meds and to lose 48 of the extra 50 pounds that she had because of those early years.  Tell him that it was singing, also, that got them to allow me to touch and groom and, eventually hug them. Bit by bit. The dog that was the skittish one -- the one who didn't want to be touched now, every morning WITHOUT EXCEPTION, stands by me for hugs and petting after I open the crate, while her sister runs to the door to be let out for morning voiding ... the sister who used to stand guard when anyone approached her skittish sibling.   It can get better for your neighbor. I really hope it does. But I'm around 99% positive that it wouldn't have come so far for me and my dogs if I hadn't given them those crates that allowed me to stay the boss of my furniture, and allowed them to feel they each had a safe den that they, themselves, could feel the boss of on their own."

He's constantly at the local Petco selling bags of treats (of which I always buy 3!) or holding an adoption event.

rescuedogs,2u8164,caseyoc,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:04:15 2015 UTC,it is thank god not a kill shelter.  I want to find him a home not just another shelter

rescuedogs,2u45vl,LokiLomax,3,Thu Jan 29 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"I've interacted with this dog personally and I can say with certainty that she's very well-behaved, but she's very shy and a little bit protective of herself. She's very smart and has adapted to the loss of her limb, and I hear she's very playful in her foster home.  Unfortunately going to adoption events every weekend has stressed her out majorly and it's breaking my heart seeing her squirreled away from the adoption area because the traffic is causing her to freak out and nobody seems to respect her space. If you go to the rescue's adoption event at Sierra Fish & Pet in Renton, you might have to ask for her specifically because of that. If she's not there I might be on the clock and you can come talk to me about her. (I don't work with the organization but I work for Sierra)  She absolutely can be worked with to be an outgoing, friendly dog. She has it in her. She's just stressed from being manhandled, coming from a country where she was abused, and being exposed to loud and rude people regularly. I wish I could adopt her myself but I can't afford her, nor am I certain my own rescue animals will be okay with bringing home another dog yet."

rescuedogs,2tz36f,motoinstorage,3,Wed Jan 28 16:16:27 2015 UTC,"I know the two rescues I foster for wont turn them in. It's out of fear that they will kill the dogs in the future rather than working with rescues to save ""unwanted stock.""  But there was the ""Magnolia Brittany"" group. Linked below that we helped take in. There was also a smaller group of Brittany pups from Nebraska in a similar situation where I fostered one. Poor dog tried to dig through flooring to escape me at first. The Minnesota based group Secondhand Hounds who I also foster for had a group of English Setters who were malnourished and been in crates but not fearful. I fostered two ten year olds from that group. But the last two examples were voluntary surrenders where no charges were pressed because of fear it would discourage surrender and encourage destroying the dogs. It has to be pretty bad before they will turn them in.   Here in Minnesota they just passed a breeder law, HR 34 I believe was the bill(maybe 84?? Search Minnesota breeder bill 2014), that puts pretty decent protection in place, if they can enforce it.   http://forum.americanbrittanyrescue.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9530  Sorry if there are any issues with grammar or links.

rescuedogs,2tz9vp,StephDefined,2,Wed Jan 28 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"A small companion mix would probably work well. Try and stay away from terriers and working breeds/mixes. Terriers are often barky, and working breeds need a lot of attention. Something like a Boston terrier or chihuahua might be a good fit. I'd also advise getting an older (3+ years) dog for the easiness factor."
rescuedogs,2tz9vp,giro_,2,Wed Jan 28 20:26:14 2015 UTC,I would say more of a Maltese or little poodle mix.  They were bred to sit there and look cute.   I have a soft spot for PomPoms.

He doesn't need intense exercise (although he does enjoy walks and tug-of-war), and he's affectionate and cuddly. He definitely is good for my mental health. Bonus: Many shelters are full of chihuahua mixes.  Many chis are fearful-aggressive, so you have to train them well and exercise caution around other dogs. But overall I think they are a good breed for someone who just needs a companion animal for emotional support."

rescuedogs,2tot0j,justme_3774,4,Mon Jan 26 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"It's so awesome that you got a new rescue! I'd love a pic =)  From what I understand, it's not uncommon for new dogs to have accidents when they first come home. Even if they're completely housetrained before, the new environment messes them up and it takes them a little while to get back in the swing of things. So I wouldn't be too upset about that. When we first adopted, we were recommended to use a crate until they got used to the house and could be trusted alone in the house.  Our pup also wouldn't play with us or her toys at all for like 2 months and we were kinda bummed out about it. But then one day she seemed to just figure out what playing is and now she loves playing! It might be similar for your new guy. What I thought was super interesting was how long it took for her true personality to come out! It really took those first few months for her to really blossom. I'm feeling so excited for your new addition! Thanks for sharing!"
rescuedogs,2tot0j,seonadancing1,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:49:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! That's real sweet. I can't wait for the crate part to be over, he is HATING it and has been barking for nearly 45 minutes and it's 4:45 here. Did you have that experience with your dog?"
rescuedogs,2tot0j,seonadancing1,1 point,Mon Jan 26 09:41:54 2015 UTC,Mine didn't do that (although I did have foster dogs who barked all morning in their crate) so Uufortunately I don't have any advice about that. I'm sure that some of the lovely people in this sub might have some ideas (and if they don't google might) =)
rescuedogs,2tot0j,justgoawayplease,5,Tue Jan 27 01:57:06 2015 UTC,"Your dog sounds exactly how my terrier acted on the first day. Indifferent to toys, friendly but skittish around loud things. Total blank slate, didn't know any commands. I didn't hear a sound from him until two days after i got him -- he saw a cat and emitted this shrill, loud, squeaky whine that sounded like an 18-wheeler braking. Wowee.  You can probably get him interested in toys by involving treats. Smear peanut butter on the inside of a bone, use one of those rubber KONG toys, etc. Don't worry if he doesn't pick up on playing right away, every dog has something they like.   Use treats to reinforce the housetraining too, give him a treat after he goes outdoors. If you have the schedule, take him out every 3 hours on the dot. I think mine realized it was okay to hold it because he began to anticipate a short walk soon.  Other than that, just pay as much attention to him as you can, walk him around the neighborhood and give him whatever time he needs to investigate things!"
rescuedogs,2tot0j,ioeasy,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"Great, we got him a bone just like that! I'll see if he's interested in a bit of peanut butter, who wouldn't be?   How can you encourage him to like...actually take a walk? I tried taking him for a little tiny walk in the beginning (trying to get that thing to pee, dammit) and he wanted to explore the same ~6 ft. Maybe he will be more interested later, maybe?"
rescuedogs,2tot0j,insertamusingmoniker,4,Mon Jan 26 09:39:47 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been involved in rescue for 7+ years, and has adopted out hundreds of dogs, I would say your experience is pretty typical (and perfectly normal).  You can expect your dog to have an upset tummy and maybe some diarrhea as he gets used to your new routine and a different kind of food.  Look at it from his perspective:  he came from a horrible place, he doesn't know who you are, where he is, what your routines are, what you expect from him, and what's going to happen to him next.  He doesn't know how to ask you to go out and maybe doesn't know that he can't poop or pee in your house (yet).  If he was from a puppy mill situation, he might not be house-trained at all.  This is all perfectly normal.  I don't want to sound harsh, but if he did his business in your house, it's as much your fault that you were not vigilant enough than it is his fault.  Like I mentioned, he doesn't know what he's supposed to do yet.  You must watch him continuously for the first few days.  He is never to be out of your sight.  Watch his behavior like a hawk.  Dogs will NEVER just outright pee on something or poop without doing a good deal of sniffing, pacing, or making a circle.  Sniffing a little bit the first time he's in your house is OK.  Otherwise, until he is housebroken, sniffing an object or the floor should be viewed as a major danger sign and possible precursor to doing something bad.  My #1 tip is make him drag his leash around the house.   Leave it attached to his collar.  This way if you see him start to look interested in doing something, you can clap your hands and make a disapproving sound and grab the leash and take him right outside immediately.  If you can't keep your eye directly on him, and especially if you can't be in the same room with him, he needs to be crated.  The first few days are crucial - if he goes in your house too many times uncorrected, his scent will be there and it will just get harder to housebreak him.  Whenever you take him out of the crate, clip the leash on and take him right outside (should also mention to not leave the leash on him when he's crated).  With respect to him being dirty, that's also normal.  I'm sure he was altered via some kind of low cost program by the shelter/rescue.  The vet's getting paid for his/her costs and is not making any money on the deal.  They're not going to spend the time to give a bath or trim, they just clean the immediate area and do the neuter and he's out the door.  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me or ask them here.  No question is too silly, it's better to ask especially during these first few days."
rescuedogs,2tot0j,ioeasy,2,Mon Jan 26 05:58:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is very helpful. After the pee incident he and I hung out outside for a bit kind of like you said, but we'll work on that harder. About an hour ago (the middle of the f'ing night, yes) he started whining so I took him out and he peed! So proud of him. And now he is going bananas again in his crate. How can we make his time in the crate easier? The alternations between whining and barking is almost comically loud. He must be miserable."
rescuedogs,2tot0j,caseyoc,2,Mon Jan 26 09:36:16 2015 UTC,"Make sure, especially in your first week or two, to give him a LOT of praise when he does his business outside.  You can even start to work a command into it.  We now use ""on the grass"" for our dog, and she'll walk over to the nearest patch of grass and pee, but that started out when she was being housetrained as ""Good girl pee on the grass and not inside again!  Good girl on the grass!"" (ad nauseum)  Regarding crating, do NOT give in when he barks/whines in the crate.  Make sure he has enough space in the crate to turn around and lay down, and that's about it-- if a crate's too big, it won't feel like a ""den"" to him.  If you have to, leave the room when he's barking.  Either scolding him or reassuring him will be giving him attention when he barks, which reinforces the behavior.  Eventually he'll settle into the routine, but don't be surprised if it takes a month or more to really get comfortable with it.  As for walks, I'd keep his walks local to your yard for the first week or two.  He's probably a bit overwhelmed by the new house, new environment, all the new smells.  He'll probably tell you when he's ready to explore farther."
rescuedogs,2tot0j,ShiftyEyesMcGee,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"It will get much much better.  It's amazing how much dogs are creatures of habit.  You don't think about what you are doing throughout the day, but they are watching you constantly, learning what your routine is, and adapting to it.  As he adapts to your rhythm, and gets on a feeding schedule, you shouldn't have any 3am requests to go outside unless he's not feeling well.  The advice below about not giving in to his whines and barks when he's crated is 100% accurate.  You can try putting some peanut butter in a kong and giving it to him when you crate him - that might keep him occupied for awhile."
rescuedogs,2tot0j,summerstorms17,1 point,Tue Jan 27 05:25:11 2015 UTC,"So are you mainly just crating him when he is alone in the house and/or overnight?    During the day and when you are around, leave the crate door open so he can come and go.  Consider not having any other dog beds or cozy spots in the area so that he finds the crate the most comfortable place to be.  Do you feed him inside his crate?  That's one popular way of making dogs feel at home inside them.  Good luck--you're doing a great thing.  Having patience will be your greatest asset, especially during these early days."
rescuedogs,2tot0j,Echoscurvydog,3,Tue Jan 27 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"You have some great advise so far!  The number one thing I wanted to tell you was how important it is to stay on a schedule! :) A strict schedule makes potty training soooo much easier. Feed him at the sane time every morning and then go outside immediately, stay outside until he goes to the bathroom. Then make regular potty trips as your schedule allows. I usually fall into: breakfast at 7:30, break at noon, break at 3 and dinner at 5:30, long walk, break again before bed. But do whatever works best for both of you!  As for the crate, if he's from a puppy mill it's likely he spent a lot of time locked in a crate"
rescuedogs,2tot0j,GeektasticCatLady,1 point,Mon Jan 26 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"You've gotten lots of great advice so far, so I just wanted to add that my rescues (older schnauzers, one stray, one from a similar illegal breeding facility) both took a week to start seeming like they were adjusting and relaxing, and in hind sight, about 3 months to completely come out of their shells and really come in to their own.  The best thing I did was take them to a training class as soon as I could, it really helped with the bonding process and help them understand my expectations of them.  Most of all, just give him lots of attention and love, he'll be just fine!"
rescuedogs,2toigl,TechnologyUnicorn,5,Mon Jan 26 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"Easy peasy! Use a wet/damp wash cloth to wipe him down. Avoid his surgery site, but otherwise have at it. You can even use a small amount of dog or baby shampoo just make sure you get most of it out (even if you don't it won't do any damage, it's got to be better than urine)!

rescuedogs,2tkyc6,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:21:26 2015 UTC,"Cherry eye:       Cherry eye is a disorder of the nictitating membrane (NM), also called the third eyelid, present in the eyes of dogs and cats.  Cherry eye is most often seen in young dogs under the age of two.  Common misnomers include adenitis, hyperplasia, adenoma of the gland of the third eyelid; however, cherry eye is not caused by hyperplasia, neoplasia, or primary inflammation.  In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production.  Normally, the gland can evert without detachment.  Cherry eye results from a defect in the retinaculum which is responsible for anchoring the gland to the periorbita. This defect causes the gland to prolapse and protrude from the eye as a red fleshy mass.  Problems arise as sensitive tissue dries out and is subjected to external trauma  Exposure of the tissue often results in secondary inflammation, swelling, or infection.  If left untreated, this condition can lead to Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and other complications.

rescuedogs,2temq0,Edemardil,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:39:27 2015 UTC,"Have you tried petfinder.com? A lot of individual rescue groups and shelters will post their dogs on there and you can specifiy the age, gender, preferred size or breed, etc. Depending on how common the breed is in your area you might not get any close by in your budget but if it's only like 30 minutes to an hour away I'd say driving or getting a ride from a friend is worth it.  EDIT: https://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/31350849/ I found a GSD puppy for $450, a little expensive, but one thing to keep in mind with organizations like this is that the adoption costs are high because their vet visits up to that point are covered already. Often when you find dogs at the shelter, they may or may not already have their vaccines, be neutered/spayed, etc.   It also appears that this organization has ""specials"" on fairly young dogs regularly, probably because fosters can't keep them anymore or the organization has held onto the animal for too long and they want to get them adopted out quickly. http://www.homesforhappydogs.org/Available-Dogs.html"

I've had foster dogs that just never are into toys... some love bones (well, obviously any dog loves a bone) or balls but still won't play with ""normal toys"" even after a lot of interaction. It can be frustrating as an owner when you can't really play with your dog.... sometimes those dogs are ones that excel at commands though, so you can work on teaching them a large variety of commands to entertain them and yourself!  With this one, she had never been in a home environment before so there were a lot of little hurdles before turning her onto toys. She wouldn't go on any type of flooring that wasn't carpet, didn't like stairs and was terrified of water. After a month or two when she became fully comfortable with all the other things, like having her very own dog bed!, she became ""herself"" and started playing with toys on her own."

rescuedogs,2rnxrc,beeasaurusrex,4,Wed Jan 7 23:15:27 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for a male puppy that won't get over 40 lbs and is great with kids. No purse dog, needs a bit of a protective bark.   Honestly, a pit mix might be perfect for you.  A lot of pit mixes don't get really big (I have a corgi/pit mix foster pup that probably won't ever get over 30 lbs) but it's hard to tell from photos.  They're really great dogs and as long as you do extensive trialing before adopting to make sure they don't have any underlying issues, are really pretty reliable.  They're fabulous family dogs.  Phoenix has a TON of breed-specific rescues.  What other properties are important to you?  What kind of drive are you looking for in your dog?  Do you have any other pets to consider?  The easiest way for you to determine where to look is going to be which breed you aim for.  For instance, if your kids are really young and easy to knock over, a herding breed probably won't be a great idea.    The rescue process is different with each organization, but I highly recommend breed rescues over shelters.  For one, the adoption fee goes 100% into the dogs with any reputable rescue.    The border collie rescue I foster for charges a flat rate of $300 which covers ALL vet care, heartworm preventative, flea and tick preventative, shots, microchip, and spay/neuter along with food for the dog in foster care even though they often rack up twice that in bills.  The money all goes into providing those services for more dogs once yours comes home.    Breed rescues usually are more flexible, too.  Most do a brief home visit where they bring the dog, check out your home to make sure you don't have spike traps coming out of your floor or anything ridiculous like that, and see how you interact with the dog (which gives kids, other pets, etc. a chance to make first impressions without the pressure of a decision already having been made).  After that you get to look over the contract, sign some papers, and take the dog on for a trial.  If the trial doesn't work out, the dog goes back to its foster home, no problem.  Most breed rescues will try to find other dogs in their foster program that may be a better fit for you (which is another benefit to breed rescues versus shelters; they know their dogs a LOT better than shelters do - having the dog in a home situation where observation is realistic and constant is a much more reliable form of summary than ""likes kids"" written on a kennel chart) if it doesn't work out with that particular dog.    The hardest thing with rescues that most people shy away from is being approved to adopt.  It's a bit of a catch 22, because unfortunately a lot of people who aren't suited to have an animal - either financially, or emotionally, or both - apply to rescues and then complain about not being allowed to adopt.  But any good, reputable rescue will WANT to work with you to place a dog with you.  :)    Hit me up if you have any questions about how rescues work, it's really pretty easy stuff but can seem very daunting if you aren't used to it."
rescuedogs,2rnxrc,beeasaurusrex,0,Wed Jan 7 23:54:12 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on pit bull mixes. But there is no way on earth I could convince my wife that any sort of pit bull would be ok. My kids are 6,11, and 13 so a heard dog wouldn't be a problem. I'm a huge fan of Australian Shepards they are gorgeous dogs. My wife likes golden retrievers but I'm not a fan of the hair. A dog no bigger than a retriever would be great. A masculine dog would be good too. My kids could care less they are just excited to get a dog. I guess the energy level of the dog should be moderate if that's a class. My kids are full of energy so they would definitely wear him out, but I also want a dog that will come cuddle with me after a long day at work. I want this to be a family dog,  but he is for me primarily.  Not to sound weird I get he will be a part of our family but I want to have the companionship with him as mine. And holy crap I guess I'm out of the loop, but 300 bux for a rescue? The last pup I had was a pure bred and I paid 350 for him. I was hoping to keep the fee around 100 or so.  Hopefully I'm not reaching too far."
rescuedogs,2rnxrc,beeasaurusrex,2,Thu Jan 8 01:53:03 2015 UTC,"My dog is a Australian Shepherd mix!  They're great dogs, but need a LOT of work - otherwise they can get 'herdy' with the kids and with a six year old in the house I'd probably want to avoid that and go with maybe a mini Aussie since they're generally descended from companion lines rather than working lines.    Rough coated Aussies are pretty comparable to goldens, to be honest.  I'd recommend that you look for smooth-coated border collies and lab mixes.  They're moderate-energy to high-energy dogs with a lot of social interaction and tend to bond very strongly.  They're also flexible dogs that are great as everyday companions (will come to work with you, lay at your feet, cuddle with you, etc).    I hate to say it but yeah, that's pretty out of the loop.  :P  Shelter dog adoption fees are cheap because they often have health problems, aren't spayed/neutered, have behavioral issues, or need special care outside of that (for instance a special diet, or careful nutrition due to malnutrition).    It definitely DOES look daunting, but let me break it down for ya.  $300 for all the stuff I listed is pretty cheap in comparison to adoption from a standard humane society type shelter.   $50 on an adoption fee through a shelter (which is pretty standard for a purebred or nice-looking young dog), $150 on spay/neuter (that's figuring VERY conservatively), $50 for microchipping, $80 clinic fee to have the dog checked out by a vet, $15 1-year rabies shot at a low-cost clinic (this is assuming the dog has already had bordatella (aka Kennel Cough), distemper, parvovirus, and canine hepatitis vaccinations...all of which cost significantly more than a 1-year rabies vaccination, and some of which are legally required alongside rabies in many states), $60 for flea and tick preventative, $30 for one dose of heartworm preventative, and maybe even a $30 fee for a heartworm treatment.  edit: Ooh, I forgot grooming and rehabilitation!  A lot of our rescues come in with horrible matting, skin issues, eye problems, and injuries which can cost hundreds to get resolved and make the dog presentable.  For instance, my baby had horrible dry skin and a ton of mats behind her ears when I got her - you'd never know it now, but it cost a pretty penny to get that fixed up with dietary supplements, careful grooming to get rid of the mats, treating her incisions from surgery (which was another $400 on top of everything else the rescue paid for...), and giving her painkillers in the meantime.  This is all before figuring in potential costs for x-rays, checking out scary lumps to see if they're malignant or benign, teeth problems (many rescues have horrible teeth and gum infections from poor diet and chew allowance), etc.  That $300 fee covers EVERYTHING while with a cheaper adoption fee you're paying at minimum $400 total for the most basic vet care at a very low-cost and possibly low-quality veterinary hospital.  And that's before you start buying extra stuff like food, collar, leash, harness, toys, chews, etc.    I know this is a bit of a text wall but it really is important to know what you're paying for when you look at adoption fees.  I'm not saying that all high adoption fees are valid - some rescues charge AKC breeder prices upwards of $500, which IMO is ridiculous - but $300 is pretty standard and definitely fair considering the amount of care that a good rescue gives their dogs."
rescuedogs,2rnxrc,AgentDL,1 point,Thu Jan 8 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"Understood.  That is a lot and thanks for breaking it down for me. I convinced my wife 200 would probably cover the adoption fee and maybe 50 or 60 bux for food, toys, etc on top. I'll have to make sure she's on board for the price but this has been 5 years waiting for me and she knows how much it means to me. It also will be great to have a companion while I'm healing from surgery for 8 weeks. She likes wrinkly dogs too btw."
rescuedogs,2rnxrc,beeasaurusrex,2,Thu Jan 8 02:25:52 2015 UTC,"That's definitely understandable.  It's worth it in the long run, as pricey as it is.  Dunno how you're planning that out monthly, but I'd say $300 for adoption fee plus $40 for a month's worth of high-quality puppy food is pretty standard.  If you wanna keep toys cheap, wait for a Petsmart 'buy two get one' sale (they have them on kongs a lot, I think there's one this week actually!) and stock up there on a few of those plus a couple of their super cheap tennis balls and plush toys.  Amazon is great for toy deals too and you can always make a wishlist and ask for dog supplies as birthday/Christmas gifts.  edit: as a projection, I spend approximately $30 a month on toys and treats for my foster puppy.  Once you have a bunch of those stocked up (I'd personally split the fee up over a few months; get your toys, bowls, leash, and collar first, then buy a month's worth of food, then a week or two later get the actual dog), go on Craigslist and make a listing once a week for local hunters asking them to sell you antlers from younger non-trophy bucks or antler sheds they pick up while hunting at $5 a spike.  Those last years and are fabulous for chewing, way better than any rawhide or bully stick type chew."

I've always had dogs and always worked full time, but I make sure that my dogs expend enough energy everyday. Walks and runs in the mornings keep them rested throughout the day. Training and play dates keep them mentally stimulated while giving them exercise. If none of that is an option for you, you may try an older dog or a breed that requires less exercise. Adopting a companion for them may also help."

And after work when friends were going out I couldn't because I had to go home for my dogs. They had just sat home all day, I couldn't leave them for even an extra hour without feeling guilty. It was home to walk/run them and just play/hang out with them.   It's definitely doable, but you'll be sacrificing a lot of your personal time. To me that was worth it."
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,uhhidontcare,7,Wed Jan 7 02:37:48 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about adopting an older, less needy dog? There are so many senior dogs in need of good homes who want nothing more that to curl up with you.  I personally don't think 7 hours alone isnt too much, if your dog doesn't mind. I'm not a fan of crating a dog, especially for that long. Some dogs do love their crated though, so o guess that depends on the individual dog as well.   Is a dog walker a cheaper option than day care?"
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,brillke,2,Wed Jan 7 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"A dog walker is around $30 an hour (bonded) or you can get someone off of Craig's list for cheaper but I'm a little uncomfortable with that. We are actually thinking we would prefer an older dog, at what age are they considered senior?"
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,headinthered,3,Wed Jan 7 01:13:00 2015 UTC,Senior dogs are typically around 7+ but really any dog over 5 is way less likely to be adopted due to age.  At 5+ you'll still get some good energy but quite a bit more relaxed dog
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,bigbadorange,1 point,Wed Jan 7 06:05:29 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say it depends on the individual rather than the breed. I walk  mostly staffies and could probably put them into the category of high energy and low energy even when they are under 5. My foster dog is five and high energy. I'd say age 7-10 when the energetic ones may become more lazy
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,beeasaurusrex,1 point,Sat Jan 17 14:04:06 2015 UTC,This depends on breed. Go with a lab or retriever mutt and senior age begins around 8-10.
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,justgoawayplease,4,Wed Jan 7 02:33:53 2015 UTC,"I have the same situation, didn't have much choice but to go into full-time work. Doggy gets a long walk before we leave each morning, and a long walk when we get home.  Rescues can have more problems with anxiety, so it would help if you had a few days off or a  long weekend to start out with, get him used to the house, practice leaving him inside for a few minutes at a time. You would still run into accidents, but in a less than ideal situation, you have to prepare for less than ideal consequences.  Edit: My point is, don't let this discourage you if you know you would give the dog a happier life than a shelter would."
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,bucketsgirl,3,Wed Jan 7 01:07:17 2015 UTC,"Dogs vary by breed and individual - some are fine all day alone, others get anxious and lonely. I would recommend an older dog, and go through a rescue (ideally, one that utilizes foster homes). They'll know which of their dogs are more independent and therefore would do well in a home where they will be alone for 7 hours.  Alternatively, you could choose to adopt a bonded pair! Then the dog would not have to be alone. And bonded pairs are usually harder for rescues to find homes for, so you'd be giving a very needy pair a much needed loving home."
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,sara-ndipity,2,Wed Jan 7 09:52:03 2015 UTC,"Like others have suggested, you may want to look into adopting an older, less-energetic dog, or a bonded pair. Shelters get to know the personalities of the dogs there, so you should be able to talk to the shelter workers/volunteers and they can lead you towards a dog who suits your lifestyle!   Honestly, I don't think 7 hours per day is that bad at all, so long as you pay attention to them during the time you actually are home. get them stimulating toys to play with when you're gone. If you can afford it, maybe look into hiring someone to take them out once a day (a lot of places will do this for like $10 a visit, which is better than $40) or you could even see if one of your neighbors would mind helping.   I wouldn't reccomend a super-active dog, or a young and needy one- and actually, you might want to avoid ""smart"" dog breeds as well. They tend to get bored and then destructive when left alone too long- no bueno if you intend to leave your dog during the work day. but is there a dog out there who fits your schedule and needs? Absolutely! And their life would absolutely be better with you than it would be in some overcrowded shelter.  Maybe you could talk to a local shelter about fostering a dog? That could help you get an idea for if you can handle it, without taking on a lifelong commitment yet. definitely worth looking into!  I had a lot of the same worries as you, actually. I work 8-hour shifts a week and then I was going to classes on the other days. I ended up taking the leap and adopted a senior dog (who would have been put to sleep otherwise), who's super lazy and independent. Turns out it's a match made in heaven, and me being away during the day is 100% fine. According to my family/boyfriend (who help out with potty breaks), he apparently just sleeps the entire time I'm gone lol. just make sure to give him extra love once I actually am home!  Good luck!!!"
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,arrsquared,2,Wed Jan 7 11:16:38 2015 UTC,"I had the same thoughts you did, but someone reminded me - the alternative is the dog remains in the shelter, is that really a better option than a loving home that cares for them? As long as you go for a lower energy dog and make sure you establish a clear routine with exercise before and after the long wait, 7 hours away shouldn't be too bad. As long as its not much more than that it is definitely not neglectful. If you have a very busy social life or travel a lot in addition, a dog might not be a good choice.  I have two smaller senior dogs, both of which were ""unadoptable"" puppymill rescues. The first one took quite awhile (over a year) and loads of work to get her socialized to people and other dogs, then she did start to get clearly lonely during the day when I would be gone for longer, so I got a 2nd to keep her company, and they do fantastic together.   That said if you think it is a significant worry, why not look into a cat or other indoor pet?"
rescuedogs,2rkpkf,WhyAmIDoingThis7,1 point,Wed Jan 7 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"That dog has some serious separation anxiety. Not all dogs are like that, and there are things that can be done to alleviate his anxiety.   I wouldn't advise getting a puppy because of how frequently they need to go out, but I don't see any problem getting an adult dog. When my husband and I both worked full time with a small lunch break, mine would go 8 hours without going out and did fine so long as we walked her and got her energy out as soon as we got home. I have an hour long lunch and go home and take them out on my lunch break now. Would that be an option for you? I wouldn't say it is necessary, but it's nice to go home on break and have a very happy dog to greet you. :)  If you get the destructive type, you can crate them while you are at work until they are properly trained. Otherwise, maybe get a pet bed with a bone (non-splintering kind!) to gnaw on and some intellectually stimulating toys to play with while you are gone."

Best decision we ever made.  Good luck!

We do have a dog door so she can roam outside/sit on the porch/cuddle on her dog bed or our bed, or after she has been bad or there is lots of stuff we put her kennel up to the dog door so she can come inside but not have free range.

Volunteering does 2 things: gives you experience with the animals and how the rescue operates and gives you an in with the people working at the rescue.    Now I don't know if you'd want to work in the shelter system, but it is very hard.  It takes a lot of fortitude to be able to deal with what they have to deal with on a day to day basis.  They have to deal with people giving up animals, dealing with some of the worst abuse cases you will ever see, and probably the worst thing, dealing with the euthanasia of the animals.  Personally, I don't know how they do it at all.  Whenever I go to a shelter to spring an animal I almost always start to tear up.    A big issue is where you are actually located.  Most small rescues can't afford to pay people to work with the rescue and rely on volunteers.  I can't count the number of rescues that I know that work on a shoestring budget.  Even some of the bigger rescues only have enough money to pay the people that actually run the rescue and that's usually only 2 or 3 people at the very top and usually isn't enough to live on.    If you have any questions feel free to give me a PM and if you are in Southern Utah or Southern California, I may be able to put a good word in for you."

I have a degree in photojournalism, and when I was laid off from a failing non-profit, I decided to start volunteering at my local shelter while I picked up the pieces. It was the single best decision I've ever made. One year later, I was managing the entire shelter.   My shelter is an open admission shelter in the south, and I agree it can be a heartbreaking field at times, but the moments of joy and success when an animal is saved are like nothing I've felt in any other job. If sheltering is what you're interested in - volunteer in every way you can, learn from the staff and their experiences, go to classes and conferences and prepare for it to consume a lot of your life! Good luck, I hope you find exactly what you're looking for."

Anyway, there are all types of animals who need foster for different reasons from behavioral to underage/neonate babies who need round the clock care. My last foster was a pitbull who ended up needing a leg amputation surgery. Some organizations are even approved to get you a better tax return (though that's not the idea behind it).

In defense of small home-run rescues.... They are usually totally INUNDATED with emails, calls etc and often have just one person working through them, or people that volunteer their time /work full time as well. I feel your frustration as a person that volunteers for a rescue organization, just know that often times, foster parents are left in the dark as much as you! This of course isn't always the case, but some groups just try to help too much and save ALL the dogs :) which leads to having zero time to organize properly.  Have you tried going to a local shelter or humane society instead of working with a rescue? 1-3 years old and 30-40 pounds describes at least half of the dogs at my humane society. There are usually (hopefully) less hoops to jump through with a shelter as well.  Good luck! I'd be happy to offer more specific advise as well"

I insisted on calling all the time until I had him in my house. It seemed like a long time to adopt a dog, but I feel like I couldn't rush into a lifelong commitment.

I spent so much time filling out applications (some 8+ pages) only to be rejected outright or have the rescue owner drop off the face of the planet after a few emails. And I was much less qualified than you...I rent an apartment....so your situation is particularly more unfortunate.   I'd personally suggest going to Animal Control. You may not be able to get a ton of info on dog's personalities while there but can get an idea of their size, breed, etc. That seems okay since you mentioned you were willing to do some training. I know that most AC's (at least in my area) have pretty high euthanasia rates so adopting from one could be a great thing.  If you're in Indiana or willing to travel here, I could suggest a rescue to look into as well."

We don't make a big deal when we leave or return, and make sure to do potty runs before and after we leave the house.  This has made it so that we can leave one dog at home and take the other out for vet, grooming, or whatever and have an intact couch when we get back, and that used to be the biggest trigger. There are also calming pheromones for dogs if that doesn't work.   Don't discount a rescue just because of the possibility of unwanted behavior, just have some ideas as to how to deal with it if it arises.

rescuedogs,2qosm0,justgoawayplease,1 point,Mon Dec 29 07:39:51 2014 UTC,"I learned the hard way by inadvertently creating said situations and then dealing with them lol. My first ""real adult"" pet was a 9 month old lab/Dane rescued from a neglect situation. He's now 9 and snoozing at my feet. He ate every pair of shoes that I owned and my new cellphone. The second dog we got was a 9 month old rott/chow/pitt/boxer from a hoarding situation. He's the one that ate the floor when I went grocery shopping one day (and a computer, Nintendo dsi, my husband's brand new Nike shoes, etc) He's now 6 and has taught me how to live with patience and pre-emptive dog proofing. Kong toys and squeaky ""babies"" are my lifeline :) We plan on getting additional rescues once these two have passed on, despite the potential destruction"

rescuedogs,2qbrxe,JollyGreenDragon,2,Thu Dec 25 00:58:46 2014 UTC,"Poor guy!  Thank you for finding him and taking him in.    Our second rescue was in similar condition - adopted him from the city pound but was clearly neglected in the past, neck was bigger than his waist, rough coat, etc.  What we found:  1) vet checkup - you already have this covered, awesome!  2) weight - while ours was 2, he had no muscle mass and we had  to supplement his food with puppy food for the first 3-4 months to keep up with his calorie needs. (Discuss with your vet during the check up)  3) Personality - if you keep him, be prepared for possible personality changes within the next few weeks. He may be in shut-down mode right now as he's overwhelmed - he may exhibit more personality as he relaxes around you.  If he starts acting out or behaving badly after a week or two, this is normal.  4) Training - positive reinforcement only, and structure structure structure! The best thing you can provide right now is a calm, safe and structured environment. You want the dog to know what each action is does will result in. We have to crate the dog? He gets peanut butter in his kong every single time. Kikopup has some great training videos on youtube if you need positive reinforcement ideas.  5) Skills - he may exhibit behaviour that would seem confusing from a well adjusted dog. Our rescue was 2 but not only wasn't house trained, he peed every 10-15 minutes. After a clean vet check for infection we realized he had never ever developed bladder control - he just went whenever he felt any urge. I'd never met a dog that wasn't very very young like that before! But consistent training and he's exactly on par for his age now. Be prepared for challenges you wouldn't expect. (Ours could pick up a 2x4 but not a dog bone - he couldn't figure out how to hold something he couldn't sink his teeth into. Kept picking them up by their edges and dropping them - had to end up training him on how to hold them... the first time he carried one up stairs on his own I almost cried. Unexpected challenges mean unexpected rewards too)  6) other dogs - he may not know how to dog, depending on his environment. If he's sociable (and once approved by your vet) having a stable and friendly dog spend time with him can do wonders. Our rescue copied every thing our lab did for the first few weeks, including lying down exactly like him, following him around, mimicking everything - and our lab helped teach him how to play. Not every dog will respond to others positively, but it can be a great aide.  Good luck!! They can be a huge challenge but are very rewarding too."

Definitely too suspicious to be considered a legitimate not for profit rescue.  If you really want to wait for a puppy, you could always submit an application at a legit rescue and tell them you're really interested in a puppy. They usually put you on a waiting list and contact you when they receive a litter.  You can always keep a daily eye on your local humane society as well, but in my experience puppies are usually snapped up within hours of being at a shelter (at least on my city)."

I got a puppy off of craigslist and had it less than 12 hours before I called the lady and gave it back.

Rescues are overwhelmed and bursting at the seams, typically. Let the rescue know how you can offer to partner with them. Can you foster the dog for a while? Can you vet the dog? Can you help pay for training for the dog? Would you be able to take the dog to adoption events? There are many ways you can help a rescue organization help you help this dog. It sounds like you have been angels to this dog but it can be a daunting task to do by yourself. You may be a lot more likely to find an organization that will be able to help you if they do not have to take on all of the issues with the dog themselves.

My neighbors have been pretty generous about the crying and barking because I've basically stopped going out at night without my dog. That's not really sustainable, and I worry that their patience will wear thin when the barking wakes them up at night! My apartment complex management is pretty clear that they're not into loud dogs, so I know if they told management, I'd be in some trouble. You've given me a great idea, though! I think I'll call around for daycare hours!"
rescuedogs,2p81a7,daenarys_t_1993,3,Sun Dec 14 16:14:25 2014 UTC,"I'm going through the same exact thing with my rescue dog. Was fine in a home with another dog, now he is by himself and has severe separation anxiety. Here are some things I tried (they didn't work for my dog, he has just started anxiety medicine but all dogs are different.)   Thunder shirt. Get the dog used to wearing it when you are calm and home. Put it on a couple hours before you leave. It might help.  Leave a TV on or radio when you leave. Sometimes noise will help.  Wear a shirt to bed one night and then leave it on the floor next to your dogs food or put it in their crate. Your smell could help.   Make sure to take your dog on long walks or play with them before you leave. They will be too tired to bark and just sleep while you're gone.   Start sit and stay training. Tell your dog to sit, then stay, then walk away slowly. Work this up until you can walk out of the room for a minute and they still stay. Reward them when they stay and do not follow you.   Hopefully one of these works for your dog. As I said mine has just started anxiety medication specifically for seperation  anxiety, after all of these other options failed. Good luck!"
rescuedogs,2p81a7,3houndsmom,1 point,Sun Dec 14 04:43:43 2014 UTC,"I agree with all of these.  I have a dog  - beagle basset mix - with separation anxiety.  I've utilized all of these tricks, but I too had to resort to putting him on meds.  I started early on when I got him, as my little 20# pup removed a  4 foot square of wall to wall carpet and shredded it.  It was sad - because he was so stressed.  It took him only 15 minutes to accomplish that.  You have to remember, a lot of times it really is out off his control.  It really is not necessarily a ""behavior"" problem.  I started out at the recommended dose for his size, and over the years have weaned him down to a very minimal dose.  He had a brother and sister, but they have now passed on and he is home alone all day.  He does very well, and is no longer destructive ( it actually stopped within 5 days of starting the meds).  The only thing I will say, is for him, the crate never was or is an option.  He would self injure. he has had full run of the house  after about 2 weeks.  I knew very little of his history, so I do not know what he had been through, except being thrown from a moving truck over a bridge.  Head injury? Maybe.  But with meds, I discovered what a smart, funny and delightful little creature he is.  He is lovable, and very trainable.  We work on learning new things all the time.  The meds DO NOT knock him out, or make him less active, but they take the edge of and he is no longer in panic mode.  From a cost perspective, Clomicalm is the drug of choice, but as the generic has just gone out of control - long story, but for me it went from $17 / month to well over $1000 - ( I do not spend that amount of money - went the Canadian pharmacy route) Puppy Prozac may be your best choice.  Will cost about $3-4 dollars /month. Meds are worth considering.  You need to remember - he does not choose to be this way, it is very stressful for him, as it is for you.  Much luck."

I know my adoption group will be able to find her a home where she won't be alone, and she's not so old yet that they'll have trouble finding somewhere for her.

Have you done the separation anxiety training starting with a few minutes at a time and building up the time?    This also works well.  First you start with giving her one thing or one treat that is of high value to her.  Make a simple statement - ""I'm going to work"" - no fuss - basically very matter of fact.  Leave.  Wait outside, like 5 minutes. Go back in.  If she cries in that time, say nothing  - try it again.  5 minutes.  If she is quiet  - go back in make a huge fuss - good girl, good quiet - give a treat (high value  - chicken, cheese).  Wait a bit try again.  Try 10 minutes.  If she whines / cries, no fuss, no treats and go back to 5 minutes.  In reality, you need to do this over a weekend, when you can commit to the time.   If you choose to go the med route, you need to get semi annual bloodwork - about $50. Waiting about a week to get it to kick in is when you can start this training.  It truly works.  Also - I am guessing the crate is new and scary to her.  If she is not destructive out of the crate, maybe you can confine her to one or 2 inside rooms with all the comforts of home....  Of course, if you believe she is unhappy, maybe re- homing is in order, but you may find she isn't unhappy just all anxious about her recent events and the fact she has been to a lot of places, learning a lot of new schedules / expectations.  As for the shower crying, just invite her in the bathroom.  There is something about bathrooms and closed doors, many dogs think you have a secret escape pod in there.  I used to shower with my guy in the room and the other 2 just outside in the hallway. Once you get a dog - you never get privacy again. I used to forget, shut the door, and all 3 just burst through the door...."

When I first adopted her, I took off a week to get her acclimated to my home and me and my schedule. The crate she has now is new to her, although after a month I assumed she would be comfortable, but she's been in crates her entire life. When I'm in my bedroom--where the crate is--she'll get in without any prompting and just snooze.  I can start letting her in the bathroom when I shower, though. Doesn't seem to be much of a sacrifice for me anyway lol, and I think she'll be happier for it.   edit--because of confusing grammatical errors"
rescuedogs,2p81a7,3houndsmom,1 point,Mon Dec 15 01:24:29 2014 UTC,"Sounds as if she is attached to you, and you are attached as well.  Another possibility is a dog walker once daily (usually about $15 each time) to come and take her a spin 'round the neighborhood midday.    That all said, because it sounds as if you are doing everything right, I'd give the medicine a try.  Might make a world of difference to both of you.  It may give her the nudge into being less anxious, and will give her the opportunity to realize you ARE coming back everytime you leave.  What breed of dog is she? Do you know her history?"
rescuedogs,2p81a7,headinthered,2,Mon Dec 15 10:45:07 2014 UTC,"My dog is on clomicalm, I got a months supply for 30 dollars at the vet. He just started two days ago, I haven't really noticed anything yet except he sleeps some more . My vet told me to wait about a week to see changes though."
rescuedogs,2p81a7,headinthered,1 point,Sun Dec 14 16:18:42 2014 UTC,"Give it some time.  If you don't notice significant change after 2 weeks, you may need to talk to the vet.  I would not worry about the sleepiness - it will diminish.  I actually had to increase the dose for a few weeks to get a level titrated, then was able to come back down to a reasonable dose, and have since come back down again.  Are you giving it to you pup once or twice a day?  Initially, I had to do 3x / day, and now am at twice daily - I actually split the dose. For example - if your pup was prescribed 20 mg a day, you may want to try 10 in the morning and 10 at dinner.  I find I give mine a bigger dose in am (as he is up all day)and lesser dose in pm.    At my vet, when I get the bottles of 30 - which last 15 days, they are $34 each.  Before going to the name brand, he took the clomipramine  - the generic.  There were 2 manufacturers.  One decided to discontinue production and the other company saw fit to absolutely gouge those (humans and animals) who were on it.  Disgusting.  By going thru Canadian pharmacies, I can get it - name brand - Anafranil - also manufactured by Novartis (makers of Clomicalm) - a 90 day supply for about $80.  Seriously contemplating weaning him off and trying Prozac at $3 for a month's supply.    Hang in there - it does work....."

Most vets, at this point would elect not to treat the hearworms as the treatment is harsh, stressful and potentially lethal itself. The supposition is that the dog will die of other causes before the heartworms kill him so you don't risk the treatment.  Old dogs, large dogs and black dogs are the first to be euthanized; nevermind sick too.  The bastards that enjoyed this dog's early years owe him better."

rescuedogs,2o1w0r,thrwodog,8,Tue Dec 2 15:35:19 2014 UTC,"A lot of people will probably advise you to ""give it time"".  I'm going to say the opposite and urge you to return the dog to the adoption group.  If her presence is already irritating you, imagine how things will be when something comes up and your dog has to take priority (a trip you can't take, a romantic interest whose house you can't stay at overnight, etc.).  It just sounds like you want to live an independent life without attachments at the moment.  There's nothing wrong with that.   I do rescue and have three rescue dogs of my own.  It's a lot of work and yes, there are certain things I cannot do because of them.  However, it was something for which I was prepared and I don't resent any of the sacrifices I've had to make.    It's easy to love dogs and grow attached.  They're cute and give love and affection.  If you feel you can't reciprocate that love/care, it's better that you come to terms with it now."
rescuedogs,2o1w0r,KatFiveE,2,Tue Dec 2 18:02:04 2014 UTC,"Totally agree - I was 40 yo before I decided I was ready to commit to a pup.  They are like having children.  Everything I choose to do revolves around the dog.  I do not resent him, nor do I see it as a burden.  But 15 years ago - it would have been the opposite.  OP needs to make sure she is not confusing her guilt for affection.  There are plenty of ways you can support and have dogs - some shelters will let you have weekend playdates.  Maybe offer to babysit for a foster family for their vacation, or a weekend. You can go hang out with dogs in a shelter when it is a time of your choosing.  Sometimes rescues need an very temporary home ( like a week or 2) until the foster is prepared to take a dog.  And then there are dogs who may need to recuperate from a surgery or illness in a very low key quiet setting for a few days or a week.... many ways to help without a long term commitment to a dog.  When you are ready you will know, but in the mean time - time to let this one go if you find yourself ""annoyed"""

rescuedogs,2o1w0r,UnicornToots,2,Tue Dec 2 15:39:09 2014 UTC,"I feel selfish because I wanted a dog and felt prepared for one. I brought her to my home, and I put her in a position where she had to adjust to a new home and new people, and now I resent her presence and I think both of us would be happier without each other. That's pretty spectacularly selfish. I have the resources to take her of her, though she would be home alone for about 6 hours a day. It's not too long for her if I tire her out with exercise and give her water and a kong toy. She loves her crate, and sleeps in it most of the day.

You say you don't want her around, but you care about her. Did you want her so you could care for her? Is she not ""broken"" or ""bad"" enough to need the ""care"" you were hoping to provide?  I mean... I'm grasping at straws here because obviously this is something you can't define... so it kind of makes it hard to figure out why this is happening.  But, to answer your initial question...   Please help, share your adoption stores, tell me what you'd recommend?   First, I don't know what the difference between ""adoption"" and ""rescue"" is. I rescued my dog from a facility that gets dogs and puppies from the southern US and moves them up north where the demand for dogs is apparently higher.  My husband and I have wanted a dog for years and years. We both grew up with dogs as pets and since going to college, graduating, and getting careers, we never were able to get one of our own. Finally we purchased our first house! The day we closed was the day we put in an application for a puppy we saw on the rescue league's site. We got accepted and literally the day after we moved into our home a few weeks later, we brought our 3-month-old pup home."
rescuedogs,2o1w0r,ShiftyEyesMcGee,2,Tue Dec 2 18:10:36 2014 UTC,"It sounds to me like you already made up your mind! If it's only been a week and you're already annoyed, you need to figure out exactly what is causing you the grievance and decide if it's fixable or give her back.  What exactly is annoying?   I don't own a dog, but I foster, which has its own challenges. Fostering takes a lot of energy and attention. Sometimes I get annoyed because I just want to come home and sit on the couch and zone after an awful day af work, but the dog needs to eat, run and be occupied. Such is life.  Maybe a different breed or age would be a better fit for you? Different energy level and temperament? Are there daytime daycares near you that are an option to help out?  Don't feel guilty about giving her back if that's what it comes to. I've had fosters returned to me and was VERY grateful that they were, it's a much better option than living in a home that doesn't fit, or being abandoned."

She's as perfect a fit a dog could be for me, but I'm still annoyed by her being around. Despite getting the perfect fit dog and making sure I was financially prepared for her, I wake up in the morning and I think to myself ""This was a mistake."" When she cuddles up on me or we go for a walk I feel overwhelmingly guilty about my feelings because she's sweet and so good to me. I don't understand why I feel like this. I think I may ask my adoption group if they have some kind of policy about dealing with conflicted new pet owners."

rescuedogs,2nwe1e,beedo_x,3,Mon Dec 1 02:11:36 2014 UTC,"First and foremost, do not take her to a shelter. Owner surrenders are the first to be put down --as are dogs with medical issues: she won't have a chance in hell.  Secondly, if you got her from a rescue foundation (not the pound, humane society or shelter), they will take her back. I've had dogs given back to me before and it's ok. Just be honest and keep her until another home or foster home is found. If you got her from a shelter, contact some local rescues and ask for help-- offer them a donation to post her online and allow her to come to their adoption events. What rescue? Google some in your area that have regular events, look under her breed/mix or ones that specialize in special-needs dogs.  Finally, talk to your parents. Let them know that you have to stick it out until she gets a new home; otherwise she could face death if put in the shelter. Should they expect the same treatment when they get old? Do they want you to dump them in a nursing home instead of changing their diapers? That is the example they're setting. They need to fulfill the obligation that they agreed to take on and set an example as parents and adults. You will be their care-giver one day. How would they like to be treated?"
rescuedogs,2nwe1e,frackyou,1 point,Mon Dec 1 02:41:12 2014 UTC,"""I've had dogs given back to me before and it's ok."" - Thank you for saying that, I really needed to hear that. The rescuer we got her from was understandably upset when I broke the news to her, and she said that this is the first time this has happened.   My parents are okay with taking care of her till she is rehomed. Just had a talk with my two younger siblings and they seemed very...indifferent that we will be losing a family member.   Sorry for the rant, I've never been more disgusted or disappointed in them. And I understand that I am to blame as well, I should have asked for a homestay first before making this commitment. Given the reaction of my family members, I think it's safe to say that she will be better off with another family."
rescuedogs,2nwe1e,frackyou,3,Mon Dec 1 04:20:56 2014 UTC,"Hey, it's ok. The dog isn't facing death and that's what's important. Yes, the rescue is probably disappointed, but it's all about finding the right home, not just any home. They should realize that. It's my mantra. I think you may have discovered that not everyone in your home bonded with the dog like you did and that's something to consider if you decide to get another dog eventually. They're not bad people, just maybe not in the same place as you. It may be best to wait until you're more independent in the future before getting another dog. Then you can choose which dog and how much you can take on.  It's wonderful that you're someone who is caring enough to rescue. So many people won't go that far. Don't beat yourself up. Hang in there."

However, you may also be interested in this subreddit: /r/nonprofit. There, there are many people who are grantwriters etc for all sorts of non-profits and there may be someone around who works for a different kind of organisation. Nevertheless, often the channels and hoops you have to go through are very similar.  Good luck!  My advice: try to be as precise as possible when asking for advice, and maybe put more info in your title about what yuo need."

rescuedogs,2njffv,walaska,3,Thu Nov 27 16:27:58 2014 UTC,"Mine was from Pitesti, picked up by an organisation that sends dogs to germany and Austria. We failed at being a foster home at the first hurdle ;)  Apparently, he'd been living in the parking lot of a supermarket for months and these guys drove there by chance to pick up supplies. They saw the dog lying injured on the side of the road and the security guard shouted at them not to feed him. When he realised they were taking him away he explained that the dog turned up once, probably left back as the runt of a schnauzer breeder who didn't like the way he looked. Also turned out he had heart worm (of course).   One thing we learned quickly: don't leave any trash or food in bags accessible in any way (knocked over bins, stuff taken from the bar that is three times taller than him). Great, supersweet dog, there was no way we were going to give him away. I wish you many happy years. Must have been a long flight to Canada!"
rescuedogs,2njffv,karate_plop,1 point,Thu Nov 27 16:56:35 2014 UTC,"That's awesome. So glad you could help this dog! Yeah heart worm is a big problem with many strays, was the treatment ok?   Funny you mention about the food and trash. Our girl is from a shelter with hundreds of dogs and she's the complete opposite. She won't take anything unless she's explicitly encouraged to, I guess at the shelter she learned nothing is truly ""hers"" or something. I could put her favourite treat on the floor in the morning and if I don't tell her to take it, it'd still be there when I get home from work. It's great because she's never gone into the trash, never chewed any of our stuff etc, but it's a bit sad that the root is probably a learned fear of taking what's not hers."

But here it goes:  Love GSD and intelligent, driven breeds. Our GSD died right before our first daughter was born. Our other dog struggled with it. A few months later we started looking for another. Decided a non puppy, breed recognized for being good with kids and not as much work would be the best fit at the time. Found a very sweet Saint Bernard maybe spaniel mix. She was great with our daughter and other dog but boy was she dumb. And not in a cute, good way. After weeks of no bonding and little to no progress in training we decided to give her back (it was more of a trail).   A bit later we got a young GSD that we fell in love with immediately. He was crazy and annoying and sooooo much more work, but we were happy.  It's kind of like dating, I think. There are choices that we know are safe, but just don't feel it.

Sometimes in shelters where there are plenty of other dogs, some dogs will be timid and shy.  They are least likely to get adopted.  Could be when timid dog is ""free"" and can come into a loving home, she will shed some of her shyness and warm up.  She will be a little more work in public, training will be needed, but she could be a keeper!  I had one that bonded only with me initially and was petrified of everything.  That said, it took almost a full year for her to trust even me, but once she was sure and secure, she was a total love bug and quite the social butterfly; though in a crowded situation, I always was aware of her ""body language"", and allowed her to retreat from what she considered a stressful situation.  I vote for giving ""shy girl"" a chance - she may surprise you.  The only issue I would foresee is if she bonds well with your family, she may be over protective of you, but that CAN be trained out of her and she can become social with strangers when   you approach it well.  Positive training is the key."

It is cruel and abusive, and you are not teaching him anything but the fear he already knows!  If that is going to be your method of training, return him, he is no better off with you than where he was before.  Sorry that sounds harsh, but it is true!    Lets look at the big picture here. Has he been vetted - if he was in a kennel, he may have contracted parasites.  Get a stool sample to the vet to check to see if he is infected. Parasites will cause constant and often loose stool and defecation without notice.  Again, remember, he probably has no control over this.  Dogs do not generally poo 3 times in a night - get him to a vet.  Did you change his food from what he was getting at the pound?  Sudden changes in diet (vs. gradual) can cause GI problems.  Once you find out his health - and please do not base it on what RSPCA  staff tells you, they are in the business of moving dogs out - now look at what is happening.  This dog has ""bonded with you"" - though it doesn't seem perfect.  But you move away from him and he freaks out.  I am guessing severe separation anxiety.  Time for some puppy Prozac or Clomicalm (generics are relatively inexpensive).  I speak from experience - lots of it. My 20 pound dog removed a wall to wall, nailed down carpet in 15 minutes.  Poor guy was totally freaked out.  We went with the meds and a trainer.  BEST DOG EVER.  He is smart, loving, and a loyal companion.    Seriously I wish you luck.  But if administering more trauma is how you react to things, let him find another loving home with someone who might understand what ""adopted and rescued"" is really all about."

If that is going to be your method of training, return him, he is no better off with you than where he was before. Sorry that sounds harsh, but it is true!   I plead innocence. He is my first dog, and I'm just going off what RSPCA said etc. What 'is' a good way of making it clear that pooing inside the house is not a good thing? From what I have read online it is not good to let that become a routine, or the dog will not learn to go outside/will grow accustomed to doing it inside. For a dog that's been in a concrete kennel for the past 5 months and just letting it go wherever, that isn't something I want to continue.   Lets look at the big picture here. Has he been vetted - if he was in a kennel, he may have contracted parasites. Get a stool sample to the vet to check to see if he is infected. Parasites will cause constant and often loose stool and defecation without notice. Again, remember, he probably has no control over this. Dogs do not generally poo 3 times in a night - get him to a vet. Did you change his food from what he was getting at the pound? Sudden changes in diet (vs. gradual) can cause GI problems.   I have kept him on the Chappie Buscuits and Chappie Dog Food as advised by RSPCA, as he already head a bad stomach whilst with them. With this in mind he will very occasionally receive a 'dentistix' dog treat, or a chicken/beef flavored chew strip (such as pedigree schmackos). I haven't given him any human food. The first two nights when the kitchen got bombed in poo I put down to him being scared in a new environment, and those stopped once I started sleeping downstairs with him so it made sense to me. In any event, the yellow-y ones seem to have become less and less over time, which I took to mean he is getting over his bad stomach and new environment stress. The yellow-ish/liquid-y poo he had would generally come-out during our walks, whereas what he did during the evening time tended to be more solid and brown. Call me naive, but since it wasn't all one way type or the other, I thought perhaps the yellow runny poos might just be 'fresher' than the evening ones, and he was simply getting rid of breakfast. With that being said, I too was a little worried over x3 poos in one night, all inside the house, especially after he had seemed so good about letting me know he wants to go out for a poo in the previous week and a half etc. Then this morning as I was shoveling the back garden, I noticed he had a pink blob in one of his more solid, brown, turds, almost like he'd eaten some bubblegum. Looking it up online that does seem to definitely point towards parasites, so I've already booked him in for an appointment with the vet tonight.   Once you find out his health - and please do not base it on what RSPCA staff tells you, they are in the business of moving dogs out - now look at what is happening. This dog has ""bonded with you"" - though it doesn't seem perfect. But you move away from him and he freaks out. I am guessing severe separation anxiety. Time for some puppy Prozac or Clomicalm (generics are relatively inexpensive). I speak from experience - lots of it. My 20 pound dog removed a wall to wall, nailed down carpet in 15 minutes. Poor guy was totally freaked out. We went with the meds and a trainer. BEST DOG EVER. He is smart, loving, and a loyal companion.   Indeed. That is something I hadn't even thought to consider, the RSPCA's 'angle' in this. For example, when registering him with the vet and setting up an appointment for later, I realized that whilst he had been advertised on the RSPC website as 5 years old, his paperwork states he is 7 years old. A little deceptive, no? I too realize he has severe separation anxiety, which is why I'm going to get him a DAP collar which I've read about this morning as well, when I go to the vet's later on.   Seriously I wish you luck. But if administering more trauma is how you react to things, let him find another loving home with someone who might understand what ""adopted and rescued"" is really all about.   My aim wasn't to actually the traumatize the dog during the spanking/putting him outside. Moreso to make it clear he wasn't to do it in the house, and to physically get him outside quickly before he did any more inside. Now that it seems like he has an infection and isn't at fault for last night, and I know about these collars that should fix his separation anxiety, I'm hoping everything goes OK in the future. Love the dog, he's good as gold normally (in the week and half I've had him so far, up-till last night), I was just running out of options."
rescuedogs,2mz05d,imaginesomethinwitty,6,Fri Nov 21 12:53:25 2014 UTC,"He may be a good candidate for crate training - this can help with night time accidents especially, prevent destruction and ease separation anxiety if done right. The trick is to make the crate a safe space that the dog enjoys, not a punishment or bad thing. Worth reading up on."
rescuedogs,2mz05d,stubbornPhoenix,6,Fri Nov 21 14:03:12 2014 UTC,"These would be good topics to bring up in /r/dogtraining. They will be able to help you and say more about positive reinforcement training, which is what is needed especially if you have an abused rescue. Crate training will be difficult since the dog already associates them with bad things, but it will help a ton with the separation anxiety.  To be honest, everything will be difficult with this situation, and it's going to take a lot of time to fix the potty training and anxiety issues. A LOT of time. You're starting out on hard mode, here. Not your fault, sounds like it's worse than expected, and you were definitely lied to.  However, do not do things like rub the dog's nose in it's own poo. Whatever your intentions, it will more than likely not have the desired effect. Your intentions really don't matter in this respect. I don't mean that to be harsh, but rubbing their nose in it is showing them a problem without a solution.  Say you decide to make grilled cheese sandwiches for you and your friend, a sandwich crafting pro. You burn the sandwiches to a black cheesy charcoal, but instead of telling you what you did wrong and how to fix it, your friend makes you eat both sandwiches , bite by crusty bite as they watch, to show you just what you did. The problem is that you still don't know how to make a damn sandwich, and now you're nervous to make one in front of your friend, who could have just as easily helped you. Well when your dog goes in the house, that sandwich is already burnt. There's nothing you can do until it's time to make the next one.   You have to think of yourself as a supportive, knowledgable guide to your dog, not as someone who cracks the whip. If you continue to act out of anger or frustration, all you'll become another owner that your dog is afraid of. Your attitude is patience, and as soon as that changes, it's time to step back, remove yourself from the situation, and think of what you can do next time.  Also, I'd recommend looking up Zak George's YouTube channel, full of very informative positive training videos. They will get you started, /r/dogtraining can help fill in the gaps, and patience is the most important thing going forward. It will not be easy, but it also sounds like you've got quite a lovable dog beside the issues, so focus on that."
rescuedogs,2mz05d,3houndsmom,4,Fri Nov 21 15:19:52 2014 UTC,"Okay - sounds like you're trying - sorry for yelling. I am assuming you are in the UK. But please don't hurt him (not even his feelings) for something he may not have control of.  You will get so much further with a monotone, ""Oh, doggie, what happened?"" If he knew before to let you know, he may still know, but when those bugs bite, it's too late.  I'm betting when you were sick, no one rubbed your nose in it.  That doesn't work anyway.  You have to proactively housetrain a dog. MUST be consistent. A new dog -new to you anyway - needs to learn your expectations, and your schedule.  That being said, all bets are off with training until he is medically well.  DeWorming is relatively easy, but once you give him the meds (not at night - do first thing in the morning) make sure you are there with him, because when the med kicks in (usually just 3 doses) he will need to be out right away. They usually pass the parasites over a series of poos.  NO SCOLDING if it happens in the house - he will have NO control over that. I am guessing he knows to go out back, just can't make it. Try taking him out every hour or 2 to give him the opportunity - yes even at night. Trust me - it will make both of you feel better.  DAP collar? No offense, this is a dog who has been traumatized.  You said neglect, then off to the pound, and now to you, sick. He's a ""hot mess"".  Forget the collar, go with the meds until you both can get settled into a routine.  You can eventually ween him off.  It takes about 3-4 days to start kicking in, and what a world of difference....   As you are looking to work with him to make him your best friend, if you are not in the position to find a positive dog trainer, Google Positive dog training.  I learned so much.  My guy (now 8) still remembers the rules, even when I don't sometimes.  For instance, when he poos/pees outside, praise, praise, praise.  Act like a fool praise.  He truly wants to please you. When he even runs to the door to go out, praise praise praise.  He is 7, not a puppy.   He needs to learn a whole new way of life and dogs inherently want to please you.  Rescue dogs, recycled dogs, anything you call them, arrive with baggage(usually negative) - your job as the adopter, and the most rewarding, is to teach them love and manners and good behavior and how to get rid of all the negative.  Which is why I suggest the meds.  You can't get to all that until you have a calm dog, who is not panicking that he is about to be yelled at, hit or anything else.    Do you mind me asking what breed he is?   There is a whole positive regimen for training with separation anxiety.  It takes consistent dedicated work.  I hope you don't mind - but I will tell you what worked for me.  Put the dog somewhere safe, even the crate. Make sure a radio or tv is on. Save a special treat, or toy for ""going out"" - sometimes a KONG filled with little tiny treats works good. Make sure it is very special to him - a treat he LOVES.  Then give it to him, telling him you will be back.  Pick a specific phrase.  ""watch the house"" works.  Keep it monotone, and low key.  Once you assure he is settled, leave.  Go sit in your car, or somewhere away from the house ( they have good noses).  Also - speaking of scent, put a blanket or old t-shirt or something that has your scent on it (don't wash it) with him. Your scent will be comforting to him. First time out - 10 minutes.    Come back in.  No destruction? Make a scene, jump for joy.  Praise praise, praise.  Each time you leave, increase the time by 5-10 minutes.  If there is a fail, start back to the same amount of timing for a positive result, and move forward from there.    Make sure he has good chew toys, Nylabones are good, and they relieve stress if the dog can chew.  Of course, as I said - until you are sure he is completely healthy, all bets are off.  Honestly, All of the rescues I've had, all were abused, neglected etc. All came with emotional baggage.  I never raised a hand.  I got so much more out of "" I am not happy"", in a very monotone even tempered voice.  It's almost instant guilt for them.  Then you blow it off in 5 minutes - because they have a short memory - and hug them and go back to life.  Dogs don't understand holding a grudge - you shouldn't either.    One last thing - once he is healthy - exercise is so important.  If you need to go out for a while - make sure he has a good walk before. A tired dog is a good dog.  And stimulate him mentally.  If possible, play outside in the garden with him.  Hide toys, let him find them. Make him think.   A short side note about my Jake - He has stayed on a low dosage of medicine.  And I am thankful I did.  In the course of 6 months, we lost both his 4 legged step brother and sister, and my Aunt who lived with us.   I was working full time and was expecting the first few times I left the house to come home and find it destroyed he had NEVER been alone in the house.  But nope - stuck to the plan - and he has never destroyed a thing and has full run of the house without issue.    When he is healthy - dogs will occasionally eat something outside, etc, that will upset their stomach.  Try cooking rice (not instant) and mix with a little boiled very lean ground burger, or boiled white meat chicken.  No dog food until the diarrhea stops.  If they stop drinking, or won't eat within 24 hours, or seem lethargic  - off to the vet!  If it helps, mix dog food back into the chicken/rice mixture little by little until its back to dog food.  Hope my wall of text helps.  I do wish you much luck, and it really is the most rewarding thing, but love, patience, and dedication is key.  Along with good health.  If I can offer any more suggestions to questions concerns - please ask.  I have gone from a not so much a dog person, to a huge rescue dog person."
rescuedogs,2mz05d,Mousejunkie,5,Fri Nov 21 14:54:18 2014 UTC,"Don't yell at him for using the bathroom in the house. He will start associating that with using the bathroom being bad and he will stop going in front of you and just hide/wait till you are not watching and still go in the house. Just take him out often. Stand there and wait. Give him GOOD treats when he goes to the bathroom outside (I gave my rescue tiny pieces of turkey...but you might wait on that till the stomach issues are settled). Praise him a ton.   For sleeping, could you try crating him right next to your bed? Lots of dogs just want to be near their human at night. One of our dogs has some separation anxiety issues but he is perfectly happy to sleep in his crate all night, as long as it's in our room. Also, you could try giving him some melatonin before bed. You can google to find the proper dosage based on his weight. We did that as well as adding some chamomile tea to their water before bed, they loved it!  Just be patient and show lots of love and safety."

He came to the shelter with another dog who got adopted, but he was unfortunately left behind. The shelter lists him as unfriendly with other dogs, but in my experience with him he is fine as long as he is introduced to them properly and they aren't too energetic. The shelter also lists all dogs as unfriendly with children and cats unless proven otherwise, so Beamer is not necessarily bad with either. He is extremely loving and has always been affectionate with the volunteers who walk him. For being a senior he has a pretty good energy level, but he is still very calm and relaxed. Even a foster home would be good for this handsome boy!   For more information you can check out their website www.friendsforpets.org/ or their Facebook page. You can also ask me, I've been volunteering at this shelter for a little over a year and Beamer has been there the entire time, so if you have any questions about the process, the prices, or Beamer himself I'd be more than happy to help. Thanks!"

That being said, dogs are much more resistant to Lyme than people are and they can just treat him with antibiotics. Lyme is really only a problem when it's left untreated.   Also, any open wounds need to be cared for so they don't get infected, clean them and put some antibiotic cream on them. The oral antibiotics your vet gives you should help as well.

Keep washing and brushing until the pup's bug free.  Most likely, the mites will die from the washings, if not, your vet will prescribe you something like Ivermectin for it and it won't take long to clear up.  As far as treating Lyme disease, we have had a couple rescue dogs diagnosed with it.  They were put on doxycyclene for a month and it has been a success.  That pup will probably test positive for Lyme going forward, and you'll need to follow up at your yearly vet visits, but you'll be surprised how little it might affect the dog.

Meet lots of dogs, foster a few if you can, spend time with them to determine if their temperament matches your lifestyle. When you do finally adopt the right buddy for you, make sure you go to a vet within the first two weeks of adopting, that way if there is a health issue you'll know right away. Often the shelter will take the dog back or pay for any medical expenses. But yea, take your time making the decision and be prepared that adopting an older dog means you might only get a year or two with them.

I am definetly going to take my time searching for a rescue and an looking to adopt a dog at a mininum of a year in age. I've had a puppy before who used to nip so much to the point of exhaustion.   How has your experience been with previously 'housebroken' dogs? The only exception I have for adoption is if it is housebroken and crate trained to a certain extent.
rescuedogs,2ldety,redditor031112,2,Sat Nov 8 20:49:14 2014 UTC,"All of my dogs were already house trained when I got them. We haven't ever crate trained them, they could have been for all we know, but all three dogs were so laid back and easy going when we got them we didn't feel it was necessary. Good luck!!"

They can go speak with the residents about the conditions and give them the option of improving living conditions for the animals and the overall health of the animals, or realizing things are out of hand and surrendering some or all of the animals. If you go this route I would also ask surrounding certified rescues (equine, farm, dog/companion animal) if they would be able to take in any of these animals if animal control would be able to have them surrendered."

rescuedogs,2ktkld,lanabananaaas,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:20:25 2014 UTC,"Labs can be high energy. Most labs I have ever know have been puppies until they're about 6 years old.  If she does not have enough room to run and burn energy, get played with and tired out, as well as being challenged mentally, problems (like chewing) can develop. If you are not very active/ high energy like a puppy is, perhaps you could find a 4-6 year old dog.  They're usually more laid back.  happy with a daily walk, some time in the yard, etc. and then hanging out with you in front of the tv.  If you do not feel that ""connection"", and I am just guessing that maybe it is because she is needy - maybe she is not the pup for you.  Puppies, like babies, are a lot of work.  They need to learn, run and play ALL the time.   There are MANY older dogs who would love to just hang out with you.  Think about it. May be the way to go.  As your pup is young, will probably easily find a good fit.    I am not being critical of you - I commend that you are realizing this early on.  Personally, I knew from the get - go I did not want a puppy.  All of my dogs were at least 2 when I adopted them.  And after a walk and some play time, they were happy to just hang out.  That fit my lifestyle and we were always happy."
rescuedogs,2ktkld,3houndsmom,1 point,Fri Oct 31 00:04:19 2014 UTC,"I completely understand not being able to form a connection with a dog and it is frustrating. On the other hand I know exactly how it feels to have that wonderful obvious connection with a dog. My first dog was a female Yorkie, that I was given when I was 13 years old. Her and I never bonded, she did however bond with my dad, and him to her, which is where she happily resides to this day. When I was 19 I decided to try my luck with puppy love again and I struck out. This dog is so connected to me and I with him. He is my baby/best friend/cuddler/protector, I call him my dog soul mate. I've had him for 5 years now and couldn't imagine a day of those 5 years without him. The decision is not going to be an easy one, in my situation with the yorkie I had someone in the house who did connect with her so there was no question as to keeping or getting rid of her.  Both Labs and Shepards are high energy working dogs and need a task to focus on. This is why they are used for hunting, human assisting, therapy dogs, and police work. You'll even notice when playing fetch that the ball/stick becomes an obsession and they are unlikely to stop until it is forced.  Sorry to ramble, I hope you find this useful in your decision making."

rescuedogs,2kgm4l,heck_yes,5,Mon Oct 27 13:21:18 2014 UTC,"I cat test for a dog rescue charity I voluteer for.  All different dogs can have pray drive e.g. as soon as they see small furries such as cats, squirrels, puppies, birds etc they want to chase and some want to kill.  Obvious breeds where this is more likely are greyhounds, working terriers etc.  However it really depends on how a dog has been socialised at a young age as I have a friend with a lurcher and a greyhound that live happily with a cat so there are no definites.  Without letting a dog see a cat it is impossible to know how they will behave regardless of breed.  I get to foster dogs to see how they behave around my cat.  I can never truly guess how things go until they meet.  Then I have to take it slowly and let then meet through a dog gate and I observe the dog's body language, are they getting over-excited, growling, tail stops wagging etc.  If I feel they are calm I will let them meet but the dog has a lead and harness on so I can control them if I think they are going to lunge or attack.  My cat is very confident so I can see how comfortable he is feeling.  If he is getting stressed I stop.  The key is slowly, slowly and safety first always.  I would suggest in your situation looking for a puppy or young dog where you will be able to train and socialise them around your cat as I guess you can't foster dogs to 'try them out' although some rescues may let you do that first.  We do at my charity but I am in the UK and guessing you are most likey in the US (apologies if that is a wrong assumption!).  Another good indicator is if they have lived with cats before but I appreciate not all rescues know this information.  Also if they have lived with small children seems to be a good indicator they might be good with cats but again this is not a definite.  Also before you start looking ask someone you know with a dog to come visit you at home to see how your cat copes.  Some cats don't want to live with dogs and you need to see your cat's response before commiting.  My brother's cat is much more nervous than mine but he has built his confidence around cat-friendly dogs I have been fostering and taken round to meet him.  I am sorry I can give you a straight forward answer but it really depends on the specific dog. If I can help with further questions my reply might of raised please feel free to PM me!"

This handsome, tri-colored bundle of fun was rescued from a shelter in Abilene in late September. All the staff at the shelter and the ABCR volunteers that have met him have fallen in love with him. That’s because Howdy is one of the sweetest pups ever. Howdy has a personality that matches his name. He’s friendly and wants to meet everyone!  Here are some things that a potential adopter might want to know about Howdy:  -Howdy is working on potty training and crate training. He has come a long way, but still has accidents every once in a while. He has not had an accident in his crate, however. A potential home will probably need to continue the training with consistency and positive reinforcement. He is eager to please and shouldn't take much longer train.  -Howdy is so excited about many things... particularly cats and other small animals. Howdy definitely has a chasing instinct that will overwhelm animals that can stress or panic easily. His foster family does not recommend he go to a home with nervous or reactive dogs, cats or free-roaming small animals (ferrets, rabbits, etc.). For the record, he has shown no interest in his foster family’s hedgehog, and he plays very well (and rough) with his foster family’s two young Border Collies.

Our 501c3 is currently pending, but everything else is set up and ready to go - we just need to get set up with homes to bring our dogs into before being placed in their forever homes.  Feel free to PM me for any further proof, details, etc.    Fostering for BCR&R is very simple.  At this time, there is no financial compensation for foster homes - this is a volunteer position only.  Likewise, we will not ask for any money from you save what you spend directly on the dog you’re fostering unless you choose to adopt.  We do require that you have some experience with dogs and knowledge of the breed, but you do not need to currently own other dogs, have personally owned a border collie, be more than basically experienced with dog training, or be prepared to adopt a dog.  You choose the age and energy level you’re comfortable with - if you only have the time to work with senior dogs that just need daily walks and lots of love, we’re happy to have you and we can place puppies elsewhere!  Fostering is a big time commitment, but if anything happens you can always give us a call and we can place a dog in a different home with enough warning.    Here’s how it basically goes:    You fill out the application linked in the post title.  We receive it, read it over, and make sure you aren’t some kind of deranged Cruella De Ville character.   Once we’ve determined that you’re a suitable foster candidate, we’ll call you to do a quick phone interview and arrange a home visit, where we’ll make sure your home is reasonably dog-proof and up to our standards for dog care.   Assuming you pass the interview and inspection, we’ll put you on our foster list and get a dog out to you as soon as we have one that’s suitable for your lifestyle.   We provide a collar and leash along with special foster tags which must be kept on the dog at all times.   We pay for any applicable vet care, spay/neuter procedures, and microchipping (which is done in the rescue’s name and can be altered by the adopter upon the official transfer) at our designated rescue veterinary offices.   We will also supply at least one chew toy.  All you need to be responsible for is a crate (we do prefer that our fosters crate train, but it’s not required), treats, food and water along with the bowls for such, time, and love!    You must be willing to use Force Free/R+ training techniques only.  We do not allow anyone who trains in accordance to dominance theory, ‘alpha’, or ‘pack leader’ type methods to foster for our rescue.    If you’re interested and able to drive to North Texas (the DFW area or Wylie, Allen, Plano, etc in specific) please feel free to apply!  We’re not accepting out of state foster homes or long-distance foster homes (more than a 5 hour drive) right now simply because we’re still a small group and want to keep things relatively local."

rescuedogs,2jebeb,missamarie,2,Thu Oct 16 06:52:16 2014 UTC,What special needs does she have?
rescuedogs,2jebeb,dogGirl666,2,Thu Oct 16 13:17:02 2014 UTC,"She was neglected badly as a pup and because of this her immune system didn't develop properly (best guess.) She was pretty naked when we brought her home; demodex. About four weeks ago, the demodex came back. She has also had a few infections since April... I feel like we are always at the vet. Luckily we caught the demodex early this time and she is responding well to the meds."
rescuedogs,2jebeb,dogGirl666,1 point,Thu Oct 16 19:33:39 2014 UTC,"Aww! I had a rescued female pit bull that initially had parvo, once she recovered from parvo she had a demodex overgrowth. Once she recovered from demodex a few years later she turned out to be highly allergic to oak pollen and her paws became swollen, red, and filled with blood-blisters/pustules this then made her at least partly dependant on cortisone to control her swollen paws despite being removed from the source by several miles. She was a ""blue-nose"" pit bull. I had learned that many of the diluted colors of Dobermans and shelties for example have immune disorders especially related to their skin. I wonder if blue-nose pit bulls are more susceptible to immune-related problems. I hope your sweetheart will recover and have no further problems related to her immune system. I love pit bulls and believe that they have a low number of genetic diseases compared to many popular breeds --I hope that immune system weaknesses are not working their way into being a common heritable disease."
rescuedogs,2jebeb,dogGirl666,2,Thu Oct 16 22:26:43 2014 UTC,"That sounds really rough. I'm still hoping that she will ""grow out of it."" Maybe as she gets stronger so will her immune system. I have a few friends on a doberman forum that had similar issues and they eventually cleared up around 2 and a half. Hopefully, it won't take her that long. But as long as she gets healthy, I'll be happy.  I don't know about shelties but dobermans tend to have Color Dilution Alopecia (CDA) that causes they fur to fall out and is related to their diluted color. The immune issues that can crop up tend to be related more to their breeding than to their actual color. Plenty of reds and blacks with it. Then there are thyroid issues in dobes that cause similar problems. sigh Seems like finding a healthy dog is such a trial.   I don't mind the extra bit she needs, she's wonderful and always worth it. I always knew I wanted to add a pit to the family and so did my husband. Him even more so. Can't help but love these smoosh faces."
rescuedogs,2jebeb,dogGirl666,2,Thu Oct 16 22:53:53 2014 UTC,"Whoops! It wasn't shelties it was collies:    Two major health issues may arise with blue coat dogs...collie puppies. It is called acyclic neutropenia and is an immune system disorder. Puppies are unable to fight infection and may die within the first few weeks of life.   And apparently a mutation in the gene most involved in blue pigmentations in many mammals can cause    A mutation in this gene results in Griscelli syndrome type 3, which is characterized by a silver-gray hair color and abnormal pigment distribution in the hair shaft.  Mutations in melanophilin cause the ""dilute"" coat color phenotype in dogs and cats. Variation in this gene appears to have been a target for recent natural selection in humans, and it has been hypothesized that this is due to a role in human pigmentation.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanophilin  http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/5/468.long  Griscelli syndrome is defined by the characteristic hypopigmentation, with frequent pyogenic infection, hepatosplenomegaly, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griscelli_syndrome     So, no wonder I got the impression, from the lecture on blue dogs I saw about 15 years ago, that the veterinarian giving the lecture had suspicions about blue coats in some type of relationship with immune system dysfunction. I'm not sure if 15 years ago they had the ability to trace the melanophilin gene and its mutations in relation to blue and/or blue merle dogs.  [My memory is foggy about it but I still had a vague impression about the possible relationship of blue-dilute coats and something related to the immune system--- I still have suspicions that this gene and its permutations in relation to dogs have not been fully teased-out. --But vague suspicions do not mean much of anything coming from a non-expert like me. ]"
rescuedogs,2jebeb,norcon,1 point,Fri Oct 17 03:28:01 2014 UTC,"I can't say that I'm an expert by any means. Most reputable dobeman breeders don't breed for dilutes. (Harder to finish championships and so many pet owners don't want naked doggies.) Very few ever even have them, so it's definately not something that I am well versed in. Doberman's have so many dang issues nowadays, I just try to stay abreast on what may be a problem for my red boy in the furture. I'll have to research it more, most people are worried about cardio so that has been the focus for most health topics of late.  Collies have a whole mess of problems it seems. The breeding for dilutes is so much more destructive in collies it seems than in dobermans. I have no idea why that is, what the genes look like. (And now I'm ridiculously interested and will have to look into it.) I think it was a rough collie that won Westminster last year? This dogs dad was a double merle bred just for their breeding program so that he would always pass on the blue? gene. Most double merles have a lot of health issues (iirc) and this was, in many people's eyes, not an ethical move. And now I'll have to look more into dog genetics. :)"

rescuedogs,2ivysy,nlewicki,5,Fri Oct 10 20:21:36 2014 UTC,"1st thing - block bush so she cannot get under it.  I have one, and I just got fencing to put around it.  You can go fancy I used a stretched out metal dog yard, or you can go chicken wire and poles - just don't let her have access to it.   Secondly - for a treat - make the ""I'm going out"" treat a super special one.  Cheese sticks sometimes work. But that special snack is ONLY for when you go out.  When you come home, give her another special snack. You're associating your going out and the fact that you ARE coming back with something really special. It takes a while, but they catch on....and it does work.    Now, as for men, my girl HATED men.  Petrified of them.  So 2 things. the first - when you go somewhere, and she is by your side and men are there.  Ask them if they will help out.  They should continue to have eye contact with you, ignore her, but you hand them a small soft treat to give to her.  While they are giving it, they should continue to ignore her, but put their hand down where she can smell treat and they can hand it to her.  After a few treats, she may just seek them out to see if they ""are carrying"".  Do this with as many men as you can. It takes a while, but again, you are associating men with good things.  They can pay attention, i.e. say her name as she becomes comfortable with them giving treats.  It took almost 3 years with my badly abused girl to get it.  Finally, when she would go for a walk, and a man would pass, she'd stop and sniff the air to see if they had a treat on them.   It was kinda funny.  Secondly, if you have men in the house - identify a safe place for her.  Allow her to go there.  maybe it's a crate, or a room where the man/men is not.  Use a baby gate.  So she can see they are good, and mean no harm, but she feels perfectly safe.  This worked beautifully for my Sadie. Men could come and go, and do work, and she'd just watch and enjoy.  Got to the point I didn't have to do that either after a while.    Overall, be patient.  You don't know exactly what she went through, and after her bad life, you are the first one she has bonded with, so she wants you there all the time.  You are hers, and she needs to hold on to that.  Also when you go out, if she lays in a bed, or or a particular piece of furniture, put down a blanket or shirt or something that has your scent.  Sleep with said article a few times, so it smells like you.  This will comfort her when you are not there.    All the best, be patient and know you have a good friend and companion, for the rest of her life!"
rescuedogs,2ivysy,3houndsmom,2,Fri Oct 10 21:35:07 2014 UTC,Thanks! I've been nervous to do anything with the bush- I was debating cutting it down but I don't want her to see that as me taking away her safe place. I will try the fence. I will also definitely be trying the special treat method for when I leave and come back. Thank you so much for all of the advice!
rescuedogs,2ivysy,arrsquared,3,Fri Oct 10 23:03:05 2014 UTC,"It mostly just takes time. I have one who was like that, wouldn't walk on a leash, froze any time someone came close to her, super submissive/fearful behaviors like rolling on her back or peeing herself if someone moved too fast, made a loud noise, or stood over her.   She is still shy but about 2 weeks in she started functioning on a leash, got scared when i switched her to a retractable one, but eventually got used to it.  Slowly made progress to being relaxed with me in a couple months, got curious about other dogs and people about a year in. I think the best/most rewarding of all was seeing her go over several months from not playing at all, to playing when she couldn't see me, to playing when she could see me but thought I wasn't looking, to being willing to play in front of me."
rescuedogs,2ivysy,arrsquared,2,Fri Oct 10 21:16:32 2014 UTC,"The strange thing about her was when I first got her, she would only go places on a leash. I would have to put the leash on her when she was in my bedroom and then she went freely outside or to the car...otherwise she wouldn't move.

rescuedogs,2idpfh,vikram13,2,Sun Oct 5 19:38:07 2014 UTC,"Reserve cash for emergency vet visits can run from hundreds of dollars, to thousands. And that's not even after-hours emergency. Our last dog got a deep cut on his paw once ... shaving the fur was $10 per minute. Local anesthetic was close to $100. 6-8 staples were $30 per staple. 'Diagnostics' was another $100. Antibiotics another $100.  When he suddenly got sick (eventually diagnosed as Evan's Syndrome), the blood work, other tests, and finally the cost of having him put to sleep, was well over $1000 over 3 days. If we had gone with more intensive ICU treatment (with limited success in his condition), that would have added another $3000+.  Annual vaccinations & check-ups can easily rack-up another few hundred. If you're getting a puppy that isn't spayed/neutered, add a few hundred to the initial cost. If he/she also needs some of the initial vaccinations, that's another few hundred. Plus the initial adoption fee usually ranges from $200-$500.  Food, treats, toys, and other supplies are easily $150+ per month.   The cost of dog ownership should not be taken lightly. There are extremes that you need to be prepared for.  The primary question I would have is regarding your time availability. Cats are low-maintenance ... leave food, water, and a litter box out, and they can manage an entire day on their own (or more, but that's not ideal obviously). Dogs need at least 1 good long walk per day of an hour or more. Plus playtime with you and toys. Plus the time it takes to train a dog, whether it's obedience school or home training - but both are a daily commitment of at least an hour. A puppy needs to be let out every couple of hours (at most) to go to the washroom. An adult dog shouldn't be left alone for more than 8-10 hrs at a time.  If you're cramming for exams, can you see yourself being able to break away from that when the dog needs you, whether or not it's convenient? What about when you start residency (if going that route) .. will you have the time?  Dog walkers and doggy daycare are options that lots of people use, but they again cost money.  Assuming that all of the above can work for you ... regarding your cats:  Most rescues have a dog in a foster home before he/she is adopted out to a permanent family. Many times, the foster family will have had the opportunity to see how the dog does with cats. Try to avoid ones with a high prey drive (this can be breed-specific too).  Our cat got along with our last dog OK. She's very shy, so it took her awhile, but we eventually caught the 2 of them chilling out beside each other all the time.  However, our new rescue pup (8 months old) is VERY high-energy, and our cat wants nothing to do with him whatsoever ... so we've given her a safe space. She has a bedroom all to herself, with her food/water/litter. A doggy gate blocks the door, with a small cat-access door so that she can still come and go as she pleases. Once our puppy is older, we can already see that he's going to be far more relaxed, and we figure that they'll eventually warm-up to each other."

It's tough when you're in school .. I think anyone can appreciate the desire for the furry companionship, even when the future is uncertain.   Fostering is great volunteer experience for your resumes, doesn't require much more time investment than your own dog would, and all the major expenses (medical/food) are covered by the rescue organization. They're also generally short-term fosters, so you don't have to worry about all the ""what ifs"" for when school is done.  The obvious big downside is having to give-up each dog to their new family, no matter how attached you may have become. Many people are successful at it though, and still love every foster dog like they would their own.  Just some food for thought :)"

rescuedogs,2idpfh,uhhidontcare,2,Mon Oct 6 03:01:11 2014 UTC,"I highly recommend pet insurance if you are worried about finances for emergencies.  You would need to pay up front, but the insurance company reimburses you.  They also have care credit, which is a medical credit card that most vets accept nowadays.  It's a good back-up because you never know.  Emergencies can range from being $200 vet visits to into the thousands.  We lost our dog about a year and a half ago to a flesh eating disease.  We took him to a place down here called GVS which is the best group of vets in the southeast outside of the universities.  The whole ordeal cost us over $8k, and we still lost him.  So, it totally depends on the situation, but I would expect to keep a couple thousand, maybe 2 or 3 aside to be safe.  Cats that have not been exposed to dogs will typically high.  if you get a dog that ignores cats (we have 2 that do this) it certainly helps.  The cats will probably hide the first few days either way, but if a dog ignores them, things go back to normal pretty quick.  Doge aren't cheap.  A good, high quality dog food (you want this because it will seriously reduce the chances of medical issues later) can run you around $50+ a bag.  I'd recommend something like taste of the wild or Blue wilderness.  Whatever you do don't feed the brands you see on TV most of the time...Iams, pedigree, purina...they're low quality foods and cause more problems than they're worth.  baneful has been seen to cause diabetes.  Toys, annual vetting, food, etc. all add up.  It's certainly not impossible, but make sure you plan ahead. and have the money aside.

rescuedogs,2icca5,bigbadorange,2,Sun Oct 5 12:52:02 2014 UTC,"I run a Doberman rescue and we do most of what you described.  Let me give you the view from a rescue point of view and maybe it'll help you understand.  First off, we are a registered non-profit with the secretary of state, we have our 501c3 and are tax exempt, and we are licensed by the state of Georgia as a shelter.  If a rescue you are looking into isn't even properly registered in their state, I would beware.  That's definitely an issue, and I would even tell them that.  That said, being registered and having you 501c3 doesn't necessarily make you legit either.  And since I'm in Georgia, I'll answer your question about the southern shelters.  Yes, they are very kill shelter happy.  We are overwhelmed with dogs down here.  I JUST deal with Dobermans, and we can't get them all out of shelters because we don't have room.  It's disgusting. I originally lived in NY, and we had one shelter for our county that was a humane society and animals were RARELY euthanized.  Animal Control was only for abuse, rabies, strays, etc. and if they were strays they'd turn them over to the humane society.  Down here, animal control acts as a shelter and will have hundreds of dogs, with close to a hundred being turned in or picked up daily.  They don't have the room, so dogs and cats are euthanized to make it.  Now to answer your main questions...  -Foster networks are very common.  Thats what we do.  The cost of running a shelter is incredibly high, and we don't get much money.  ALL of our money comes form adoption fees and donations, which we get every so often.  Donations are not common though.  We also run fundraisers though to try and make some money as well such as selling t-shirts or holding auctions.  Foster networks don't require a physical building, PLUS we get the advantage of actually learning that dogs personality so we can speak intelligently about them.  Dobermans specifically also do TERRIBLE in shelter environments since they are bred to be with people and it's mental torture for them not to be.  We learn how they are with kids, cats and other dogs, if they're potty trained, etc.  And we can work on any problems or bad habits they have BECAUSE they are in foster and getting one-on-one time.  Granted there are some places that call themselves fosters that will have 15 dogs kenneled in their homes, but thats not how WE do things.  We do not hand out the names, addresses or contact info for our fosters until we have almost approved someone for adoption.  It's for their safety.  We've been threatened before, and we've had to get restraining orders against people before because we have turned someone down for a handsome cropped and docked doberman that they HAD to have.  Our treasurer had some guy show up at her house demanding a dog and threatening her.  So...while you're not likely to do that and probably not crazy, lots of people are.  -our adoption fees range from $150-$350 depending on the age of the dog, with the average being $250.  The average cost for us to fully vet a healthy dog is about $200-$300 including vaccs, spay/neuter, heart worm test, fecal test, exam, microchip.  The adoption fee covers those costs.  Problem is, RARELY is it that cheap for us to fully vet a dog.  We got a dog from AC about 2 months ago that we were hoping would be a quick, easy adoption.  Nope.  He ended up having heart worms which cost us anther $600 to treat on top of everything else.  His bill, when finished, was over $900.  His adoption fee?  Still $250.  We also had a female that had a bad reaction to her anesthesia from her spay and almost died.  Her bill ended up being over $1300.  Adoption fee?  Still $250.  And they are non-refundable because 99% of the time if you try and return a dog after a week or two, we've already spent the money on another dog and do not have it to give back.  We typically TRY and refund the fee should there be a real problem, or if it was our fault or something, but if someone comes to us and says ""the dog snapped at my child because I let my child climb all over her"" when I specifically told them not to let ANY child climb on ANY dog, no...they're not getting your fee back because they're idiots.  -We ask for the license number for 2 reasons...first to verify your identity, and second to make sure you have nothing to hide.  If someone refuses to put it, it's a red flag for us.  We've never run a license number, and if we can see your license in person to verify your identity, thats good enough for us.  Most apps are not done in person though, so we do ask for it.  -We ALWAYS do a home visit.  If you're not willing to open your home to us, we suspect something may be wrong.  We don't do it until we have an extensive conversations with you first to make sure WE feel safe though.  There are a couple of reasons we do these.  First is to make sure that the home is a safe environment for any dog.  For example, we require a fence for any of our dogs.  We want to see this fence for ourselves because some of our dogs are jumpers and can get out of a 4 ft chain link.  We want to be able to point out anything that we feel may be a problem and allow you the chance to fix it.  A lot of our adopters are first time Doberman owners so it gives us a chance to really sit down and discuss the breed as it would be in their home.  Things like..oh, I see you have a litter box out.  You'll want to find a way to block that off because any dog would spend all day with their head in there eating away at the catbox crunches inside.  Or we might have a dog thats a counter surfer that you want, and we get to your house and see a lot of food or medications sitting out on the counter.  We'll let you know that won't be safe and pose a solution to you.  Our goal for our dogs is to find not just ""any"" home, because when they had ""any"" home they ended up in the shelter.  Our goal is to find the RIGHT home so that they aren't abandoned again.  When you have a dog living in your home with you, even if it's not yours, you fall in love and have a sense of responsibility for it.  I foster, and so do the other board members, but we also have our other fosters as well.  They get attached, and we owe it to them to make sure that the dogs they've fallen in love with and cry over when they leave have THE BEST home they could ask for.  Granted Dobermans are more difficult and are NOT a breed for everyone, so we're more strict than some rescues, but the things we ask for are for the safety of our volunteers and the wellbeing of our dogs.  We're not on some power trip or feel like we're ""Gods"", we just feel responsible for the dogs in our care and don't want them done wrong again.  Someone may be a good home for a dog and apply for a specific dog we have, but upon looking at their application, they may not be a good fit for THAT dog.  We'll recommend another one that is a better fit.  It's up to them if they decide to adopt the other recommended dog, but we aren't just going to adopt a dog to you because you have to have it.  We do it because it's the best for everyone involved.  That said, there ARE some rescues that are on a power trip and see themselves as Gods (I used to help one...ran for the hills after a year of that crap) so be careful who you go for.  You are just as much entitled to ask for their references as a rescue, as they are to ask you.  Look them up on the secretary of states website and make sure they are legit.  If they say they are a 501c3, look it up on the IRS website and make sure or ask to see their letter as evidence.  We have people let us know they want to make sure we are legit, and I'm never offended by that because I have nothing to hide and want them to feel confident in who they adopt from.  I've had people tell me they find it odd that we're a non-profit and have such a nice website, so how could we be spending money on the dogs?  I just say ""thanks, I'm a web designer myself, glad you like the site"".   If the rescue gets defensive, I would be careful.  Also, ask who is coming out to do your home visit and their affiliation with the rescue.  We try and send out our board members to do it.  I do A LOT of them myself if it's a reasonable distance from me.  If a board member can't do it, we see if a foster can.  If they can't, we go for another rescue that may be closer that we know and trust.  If not them, then a personal friend or family member.  We never have random people do them.  Anyways, hope that helps and gives you some insight into what rescue is like in most cases.  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.  You can also go to our website... georgiadobermanrescue.com and see some more info on our process in particular to compare to your rescue of choice.  I'm not saying we're the end-all, be-all of rescue by any means, but our practices are pretty standard in the south, so it might be something to compare against.  Good luck, and don't give up on rescuing!!!  Rescuing a dog is incredibly rewarding and the best feeling there is.  I would implore you not to buy from a breeder without knowing how to find an ethical one, since it just makes our cycle of rescuing continue.  My dream is to one day be put out of business because there are no longer any dobermans to rescue.  EDIT:  Also...did I read they're asking for money upfront?  Hell no.  We ask for the adoption fee at the execution of the adoption contract (after the app, home visit, etc have all been completed and the adoption has been approved).  If they are asking for money with the application, thats nuts. I'd run away."
rescuedogs,2icca5,Kalicodreamz,1 point,Sun Oct 5 14:26:34 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed comment!  Yes, about half of all adoption networks I've found via papers/web/petfinder around here want an ""application fee"" for a few hundred dollars.  For most, this is non-refundable.  For some, they say it may be refunded if your application is rejected, but if not, it's non-refundable.  It does mean that the adopter has zero control over which dog they eventually adopt unless they walk away from their money.  But it doesn't seem abnormal from all the ads I see around here.  And to be clear about it, the house thing weirds me out because it's not reciprocal.  It seems like from what I gather - having not been through the process with any of these organizations yet - the foster / volunteer never tells me their info or invites me into their house to meet the dog before hand.  At least from what I can tell of this process here.  Thing is, I've taken in an adult dalmatian - older guy about 7 years - before off a want ad.  I got to call the people.  I got to go meet them & the dog.  Then they got to come over.  And I took him in.  And I didn't mind letting their daughters and them come back around to play with him from time to time etc.  That's all cool.  But it does seem like these volunteer networks want me to trust them a whole lot and don't really show a lot of trust back in return, I suppose, is what feels weird about it?  Does that make any sense?  Do you let people meet the dogs before they're committed?  Thanks again for all the info, etc."
rescuedogs,2icca5,Kalicodreamz,1 point,Sun Oct 5 18:04:40 2014 UTC,"The application fee is really weird to me.  It may be because we have so many rescues and dogs in need in the south, so thats just another level to keep people from adopting.  Up North people's first instinct is to adopt, where down here it's still to go to the cheapest breeder they can find.  I don't know of any rescues down here that ask for an app fee, but that could be a regional thing.  We don't ever let adopters or potential adopters go to the homes of our fosters as a safety thing, as I mentioned before.  It's also out of respect for our fosters.  But we absolutely do let them meet the dogs before the contract is signed and the dog is theirs.  If an adopter is local we usually schedule a meet and great either at a park or nearby starbucks.  There are occasions where we can't do that due to an adopter being out of state, but we scrutinize those people further due to that, and we ALWAYS take a dog back should it not work out.  Sometimes, if the adopter doesn't have a current dog, I'll try and bring the dog they are interested with me to their home visit, or have the foster do it and bring it with them.  To not let you meet the dog beforehand AT ALL is strange.  Especially if you are at an all breed rescue since mixes and various breeds all vary greatly from one another.  At least with us, people's preference tends to be color, ears and tails and we help guide them to the general personality, but they still get a doberman in the end.  With an all breed rescue you may end up with a terrier, and their neurotic behavior may not be a good fit, but it sounds like you wouldn't find that out until later and that you could lose money if thats the case.  That doesn't make sense to me at all.  Typically the plus of going through a rescue versus a humane society or shelter is that you get a dog that the rescue knows very well and the dog is fully vetted and a good match based on your app and what they know bout the dog.  If that's not happening, then you may as well go to the humane society or animal control.  I can understand the hesitation in trust, and my advice would be to follow your guy.  if you feel something is off, then trust that.  Before even contacting a rescue, I would go and check their registration with the secretary of state and their 501c3 status.  Ask around to see if others have used them before and how they felt about the process and the dog they ended up with.  If they seem to have a great track record and people are genuinely happy with the results, then they ma be doing it right.  If you find a lot of people have returned dogs to them or ends up with dogs that were not a good fit, I would look elsewhere.  And just quick about the Dalmatian thing...those people probably have never had to deal with the level of crazy we often do.  Rescues that do this every day end up building these walls to protect themselves based on experience.  One bad apple can seriously ruin the bunch in this case.  They and no reason to suspect anyone would take advantage of them and whatnot, but we've learned the hard way thats not true.  People lie on their applications to us, fake references, show up at our doorsteps and threaten us for dogs, so we've just decided not to allow them to come to our homes.  I can't speak for the rescue you're dealing with now, but thats the case with us.  I had one guy threaten to break into my house and steal my foster dog because I would not approve him for adoption for this dog (yeah, and a threat is TOTALY going to make me change my mind...).  So, don't take the trust thing personal.  It's typically a blanket protection."
rescuedogs,2icca5,beeasaurusrex,1 point,Sun Oct 5 23:10:58 2014 UTC,"That application fee thing is really odd, I'd be hesitant about that.  I'm in the South and we don't do anything like that at our rescue or any of the rescues we network with; we individually place dogs with homes that they'd be a good fit with and if the owner isn't a fan of such and such dog we'll swap them out until somebody clicks.    You should always be able to meet the dog (or even have the dog vetted) before adopting it.  Even if the fosters don't want you in their home (and some won't give out the home address because it makes it too easy to drop unwanted dogs there... :( ) you should be able to meet up at a Petsmart or something.  Home visits on adopters, however, are pretty common and mandatory."

If you get rid of her it's not going to be to make her feel any better or get her a better situation. It's going to be to make you feel better.  This is something that is going to happen with older dogs (and people too). They can't go as long without releaving themselves. Younger dogs can go 10 hours, but older dogs just have a lot of trouble making it that long. You just need to find a way to make it work. Maybe she stays in a kennel and you leave her outside when it's not really cold. Or maybe a dog door (in the garage even).  You are going to have a big problem finding someone who will take a 16 year old dog. Shelters and similar are pretty much out. The first dogs to be put down are older dogs. And the chances of her getting picked in a no kill shelter are pretty slim. She's going to sit there and be all lonely for her last days and have even less attention paid to her. Think of the trauma that poor dog will have after having it's pack\loved ones disappear and she's just sitting in some strange place. She is much better off with you getting at least some love and attention occasionally.  Is she full on peeing or is she ""leaky""? Based on the age I am going to assume it's a bit of both. However, older female dogs sometimes ""leak"" pee and there are 2 drugs that we've had an older dog on before. One was called Proin. The other had a fancier name, which I am sure your vet would know. They both made a huge difference and completely stopped the leaking for a year or 2 (until she got even older).  16 years old is pretty old for a dog. Particularly for a bigger dog (50-60lbs +). It may just be her time. If she's still happy and can move around and not in pain, then maybe not. Keep her. Try to make her situation the best you can. She's probably earned it."

Rehoming is a very stressful transition for a dog. Especially  a senior dog. Rehoming a senior dog can be a death sentence for her.  I agree with the other posters. She pees everywhere because she can't hold it. She might have a UTI.. try pee pads.

The following advice is assuming you are trying to take him home yourself, even if it's only as a temporary Foster.  Before you even put him in the car give him a bath with Dawn dish detergent. This will get him cleaned up, and if you let the soap sit for 10 to 15 min it will kill any fleas on him. It will also help to clean out any small wounds he has. Once you get him home keep him quarantined until you are able to get him checked by a vet and vaccinated. I wouldn't worry so much about the hair in his ears, as there are more pressing issues but obviously get that fixed as soon as you can. if you can't afford to take him to the vet immediately, wash his wounds daily and put antibiotic ointment on them. If he seems to be chewing at his wounds put an e collar on him."

rescuedogs,2gv2ev,tarasometimes,1 point,Fri Sep 19 19:18:35 2014 UTC,"I have fostered quite a few dogs myself. My comments:   Don’t have a dog and thinking about getting one? Fostering can be a great trail run. Or if you do have a dog and are thinking about adding a second or third fostering is a good option to see how they will interact.   Indeed, this is how we adopted our latest permanent dog after we lost one last summer. We waited until we had a foster dog that seemed to mesh well with our house and adopted him. Honestly we're extremely picky now about which dogs we keep, which is a benefit you get from fostering.   Are you on tight budget? Then becoming a foster parent you get the benefits of adding a pet to your family without the added expense. Most rescues will cover all of the medical expenses and some may even reimburse you for the food. Plus, think of all that money you are saving the rescue on boarding fees that it can use to save other dogs!   This greatly varies depending on the rescue. Most will expect you to pay for food and will only pay for medical bills. This leaves you to pay for the dog's bed, bowls, food, toys, treats, collar, leash, everything else. Some rescues have donations to give you for these things but not all. I would estimate that on average I pay about $300 per foster out of my pocket. I think that's probably above average. Some of them I will pay medical bills myself as a donation and then I'll expect to pay about $800 per dog, since usually I foster dogs that are heartworm positive.  Still it is cheaper than adopting a dog.   How great is your foster dog? Help the rescue and potential families learn about the dog’s unique personality. When you see a dog in a shelter environment for 10 or 15 minutes it’s hard to determine what that dog is really like. By being in a foster home you are helping the rescue learn if the dog is good in a crate, with kids, other dogs, chases squirrels and any quirks or special needs that he/she might have. Does he know basic commands, what ‘s his energy level is like, is he/she afraid of anything? Knowing these upfront decreases the chances of the dog being returned to the rescue or shelter because they weren’t a good fit for a certain family.   It is true. I know a crazy amount about my foster dogs like what they like, don't like, etc. and that makes their adoption and transition easier on them. I usually give their favorite toys to the adopter so they have something familiar.   Do you love animals? Fostering is a great way to give back to your community and many rescues can’t function without foster homes. Most rescues do not have shelters to keep the dogs so they rely on the generosity of families who will to open up their homes.   This is a very important point. Many people assume rescues all have shelters but that's rarely the case.   Afraid of being a foster failure? Don’t be! Being a foster failure is not a bad thing. Many fosters (at least once) realize that the dog they are fostering is a good fit for them and their families. This is a good ending for you AND the dog!   If the dog doesn't fit in your house, you'll be prepared to let the dog go to save another. It's hard sometimes to let the dogs go but it's easier than you think it would be."

rescuedogs,2gw8r4,jennatroll,1 point,Fri Sep 19 20:56:11 2014 UTC,"Was the dog abandoned inside the house?  I am guessing she got used to going to the bathroom in the house and doesn't realize that it;s not something she should be doing.  Sounds like you have to train her not to go in the house.  I would head over to /r/DogTraining.  I know it must be frustrating, but it has only been two days, and it's definitely worth going through the training."
rescuedogs,2gw8r4,HeathNYC,1 point,Fri Sep 19 23:19:36 2014 UTC,"First, get puppy pads. Has she been going in a particular area? Put them all over the floor there. There's a chemical attractant that encourages them to go potty there.   Never EVER yell at her or punish her for going outside - it'll just re-traumatize your already-traumatized dog. Take her out to do her business every hour or two if you have to.  I got a second rescue dog ~2 months ago who would use my bathmats as her potty targets - it took a couple weeks but she's good to go now through a combination of restricting access to the bathmat (no suitable potty spots), using her crate, and training her bladder to hold it for longer periods of time (she'd been in a kennel run).  For going outside, it's just going to take time. She has to learn that the outside is okay. Is she food-motivated? Get some nice stinky treats - dog 'beef jerky', or salmon strips, or even sliced people-ham (in training quantities it's okay). These are doggy jackpot treats.   Then, just spend a couple minutes with her a couple times a day (as often as you can) putting on her harness/leash and opening the door and coaxing her out with these super-tasty treats.  One of my friends had a dog after he hadn't been outside his entire life. He was too big to carry, so they resorted to putting him in their car in the garage, driving to the end of their driveway, then opening the front door and getting him used to walking back inside. He's a beautiful, happy, confident dog now.  Definitely check out /r/Dogtraining and others. Basically start out as if she were a puppy, since her social/mental development has been delayed by being locked inside."

rescuedogs,2gb4ie,actionpacked,5,Sat Sep 13 18:57:42 2014 UTC,"Maybe try to remove the option of ""other food"", so that he's hungry enough to eat his own when it's put out for him. If he needs to be let out or crated while humans and/or other pets eat, then do it.  If he gets aggressive around his own food bowl, put it down right in front of you & hand feed him out of the bowl. When he starts eating from the bowl, pet him and say calm soothing things to him. If he gets grumpy or starts speed-eating while you're petting him, go back to the hand feeding. Just make sure you're taking it from the bowl, and that he sees you taking it from the bowl.  He just needs to learn what food is his, and that no one is going to steal it from him.  Our rescue pup came from a big litter + a house full of fostered dogs, so he did some resource guarding at first too. Nothing extreme, but enough that we knew we had to nip it in the butt. All the above worked for us, and now he'll even come sit beside me with his bone while he chews."
rescuedogs,2gb4ie,FancyBiatch,1 point,Sat Sep 13 23:53:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your insight!   As far as eliminating other food I quickly learnt that I cannot leave anything lying around. The biggest problem is what he finds out and about like half decomposed bats and ant infested rubbish to name a few!  He doesn't get aggressive when I put food out for him and I can quite happily take the bowl away from him if needs be. Its the food he scavenges and shouldn't be eating, the food that I really should be able to take off him.   You have given me some great pointers though and I will continue to enforce these as good practice!"

It's a constant battle of ""drop it!!"" and ""leave it!!"" LOL.   Try practicing ""leave it"" with low-reward items (like carrot slices or something), and work your way up to ""leave it"" with high-reward items like treats. That might help too :) but it'll take time and lots of practice!"
rescuedogs,2gb4ie,fuckjacksonville,3,Sun Sep 14 17:38:24 2014 UTC,"I have worked on food aggression with my own dogs and with client dogs. My most difficult case is one of my own dogs, a 5(ish) yr old black lab I rescued. He had a record of being EXTREMLY food aggressive to the point of making himeslf bleed from attacking his kennel so aggressivly when people walked by or if the dog next to him looked at him, moved closer to him, or just was generally to close to him. What Ive found is that a combination or positive reinforcement obedience, exercise, and high value food, and appropriate managment is the best solution. I always begin by teaching a lot of obedience, ALWAYS with positive reinforcment. Most Malinois are very toy driven, so I would suggest finding a very high value toy and using it only for training. This makes it a game for both you and your dog, and you can incorporate exercise to your obedience routine by occasionally rewarding your dog by throwing the ball as opposed to just tossing it directly to him. Make sure you teach sit, stay, and come first, as these are VERY important for the next step. Once your dog has a good grasp of sit, stay, and come my next move would be teaching the dog to trade. Depending on how aggressive your dog is with food involved, you may want to start this with toys. Give your dog a low reward toy, then pull out a higher reward toy, ask your dog to drop it, and give him the higher reward toy. When moving from toys to food, I typically use rawhides, pressed bones, or other edible chews since they last longer than a treat yet there is almost always something that tastes better. After giving your dog the chew, pull out very high value treats (I like to use chicken, turkey, hotdogs, or other similar and meaty foods), ask your dog to drop it, and then give him his reward. If (like most dogs) he initially doesnt want to give up the chew, GIVE HIM HIS SPACE! This is very important, if you get to close that your dog is uncomfortable and showing aggression, BACK UP! From a safe distance where your dog feels comfortable, toss him some treats. When he leaves the chew for the treats, verbally praise him and call him to you. If (like most dogs) he initially doesnt want to come to you and goes back to the chew, reamain calm and toss him more treats and try to make a treat trail leading up to you. Once you get him to you, if possible hand feed him a treat (Ive found when hand feeding food aggressive dogs, if you hold your hand flat like you would for a horse, and only give them one piece at a time they take it without getting your fingers and it gets them used to your hand being near them while they eat), then put him in a sit and stay while you go pick up the chew. In addition to training, exercise is a big must, especially for Malinois! If at all possible, give him a job to do. Obedience, agility, search and rescue type exercises, dock diving, scent detection, schutzhund (IPO), any of these are great options for Malinois! The reason behind giving them a job is two fold, it creates a much stronger bond between dog and handler and instills faith and trust in both the K9 and the handler, and it gives the dog mental exercise. Using this method, and working with him every day, I got my lab to the point where I can call him off of almost any food, even if I don't actually have any treats on me. A big part of having a food aggressive dog is knowing how to manage him. Feed him by himself, and even if you think that he won't do anything if you try to touch him while he is eating, why push it? That is a boundary that by testing it, you could be sealing your dog's fate. If you have other animals or small children around, it might be a good idea to put him in a crate or other safe place while you prepare his food so he doesn't have a chance to get overly excited/anxious and snap at someone. When you have guests over, even if you know without a doubt you can trade him for things, warn your guests not to take anything from his mouth (depending on how aggressive he is, you may want to tell them not to touch him or possibly even approach him if he has anything in his mouth). If you take him out in public, it might be a good idea to invest in a halti or similar style head collar, so you have control over his face and therefore have more control over weather or not he can even get anything in his mouth. Since my lab has a history of such severe food aggression I dont let people pet him when we are out in public, since I dont want to possibly put his life (and possibly the life or well being of someone else) in jeopardy for a pat on the head.   If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me. I have experience with training both pet and working dogs, I specialized in training GSDs and Malinois, I have rescued and rehabbed quite a few dogs, and I have experience with both food aggression and aggression in general."

You have definitely reassured me, as what my dog has seems very mild in comparison to what you were dealing with so I know it can be done! That being said, I don't want any sign of it and need to stamp this out pronto.  I am going to try your high value treat/toy exchange training once I find out what he likes best. I got him a toy similar to what a previous dog of mine absolutely loved. It has a squeaker inside but so far he hasn't really taken to it. I will keep trying different things and I will try and show him the fun he can have with a tennis ball.  I already have a few jobs lined up for him and once we have developed a bit more of a bond, other than feeder and eater, I will introduce these to him. I mentioned in my other post on /r/dogtraining that the rescue home didn't know much about him, not even his name so we are pretty much starting a fresh as far as training goes! Once we have the foundations like sit, stay and come I think it will make everything else a lot easier!  Once again, big thanks!"

rescuedogs,2g96cv,GHGDR,2,Sat Sep 13 11:49:15 2014 UTC,"It can really depend on the rescue. A few years ago I was living with my best friend and we adopted a dog together, but because I was much more of a dog person, everything was done in my name so I could keep him when we moved apart. Turns out they adore each other an absurd amount, so when she moved out he went too. The rescue has her on FB now so they can still get updates, they're in no way concerned that I signed a contract to keep him forever then game him to her.  On the other side of the coin are rescues like the one that got in that big kerfuffle with Ellen after she gave her dog to an employee instead of returning it to the rescue."

Definitely glad I got to skip the adoption fee and the dog got to skip the confusion of going back to the rescue before being rehomed.  Edit: Of course we're going to keep him. I couldn't bear to abandon him like everyone else. Poor guy was found in a tied Walmart bag on the side of the road as a puppy. Only litter mate to survive!

Most if not all of them are already overrun and have very few resources, so it wouldn't benefit them to take the dogs back, especially if theres already another wonderful home ready to take them in. I'm always sad to hear about stuff like this, but it sounds like the new owners already have a bond with the dogs and could provide  a much healthier lifestyle. You don't go into the rescue business for the glamor and the money, so hopefully these people show their hearts and allow the transfer of ownership to happen.  Good luck to your neighbor! :)"

If they notify the rescue that they cannot keep them but have found a new wonderful home, odds are the rescue will be relieved that they took care of the dogs themselves, and just ask for the new owners information and that they sign an adoption contract.   Also, as a rescuer... even years later, we still often remember and care about our former dogs. We just want to know they are OK and in a good, safe home! So please encourage your friends to let the rescue know where they are."
rescuedogs,2g96cv,bucketsgirl,0,Sat Nov 1 04:28:26 2014 UTC,"I work with a rescue that has the same policy in their contract.  The reason for this is for the protection of the dog and so that they know where the dog is.  Our rescue puts this in place because they know every single dog they have had by name and still have close contact with most of the families who have adopted from them.  They want to make sure that the dog is well cared for, for the rest of its life.  They would rather take the dog back and find another home for it, then ever hear that it is in a bad placement, being abused, not being properly cared for or in another shelter. I would suggest that the family notify the rescue of the situation.  The rescue should then talk to the other family.  If they deem it an appropriate placement the family will get the dog (more then likely for an agreed upon trail time).  A home check should follow and if all is well they will be able to permanently adopt the dog"

rescuedogs,2fxfwa,maribellee,6,Tue Sep 9 18:19:05 2014 UTC,"Have your boyfriend do the majority of care for the dog including feeding, walking, and treat giving. Find out what she likes whether it's toys or food and have him give the dog the valued items. Over time, she will begin to trust but sudden movements, coaxing and jerking the leash should be avoided. Let her come to him but make it desirable for her to want to do so."
rescuedogs,2fxfwa,letoiledenord,3,Tue Sep 9 19:43:35 2014 UTC,"This is perfect if your boyfriend lives there. If not - stick to the same concept, but when he shows up, he MUST bring her something really special.  A little ice cream, a few pieces of hot dog, anything that is of high value.  If there is a special toy, he gets to take it out of it's hiding place and give it to her when he gets there and it gets put away when he leaves till next time.    Whether or not he lives there, if she is really shy, he should sit at her level, the floor, and pretty much ignore her, watching tv, reading, talking to you, tossing her treats, but tossing each one closer to him until she comes to him to get a treat. No petting, just let her come to him.  Of course, if she retreats at any point, let her and start again.  If she sits right next to him for a bit waiting for another, petting can commence, and he should talk very gently to her.  Not that they exactly understand the words, but they can understand that this person will NOT hurt them. They understand the tone.    A few pointers. If he wears a hat / cap  he should take it off for now. Some dogs do not like them. He should try to speak quietly, and limit real impulsive quick movements when interacting with her. If you and he are persistent, but let it go at her pace, within a couple of weeks, she should settle in and think he is the best!  Much luck!"
rescuedogs,2fxfwa,3houndsmom,1 point,Tue Sep 9 20:59:58 2014 UTC,"I agree.  Our rescue regularly brings in ""guy-shy"" dogs.  As the husband, I get to offer treats, toys, etc.  I don't do any disciplining until we get comfortable and I try to not raise my voice.  When I walked past new fosters, I'll put and arm down, hand open as I walked by and let the foster sniff me but I don't force any petting.  We're a dog on the couch family, so I also softly coax my new friends onto the couch with me."

He came to us deaf and severely malnourished and suffering from undiagnosed digestive issues.  He was in our rescue for a year while we tried to nurse him back to health.  We literally celebrating weight gains in increments of ounces!  He had multiple issues with bloat.  Was diagnosed with various internal conditions and was on an incredibly restrictive diet while we tried to get him back into good condition.  Last night he bloated again, xrays were taken and showed his intestines were pinched.  As decision was made to help put an end to his suffering and, after snacking on Pop Tarts, candy, and a lickety stick, he was euthanized.  We are extremely grateful to have the opportunity to be involved with dog rescue even on the most difficult days.  We have set up the Casper Fund in order to continue helping giant dogs in need.  Feel free to go to our Facebook page and show some love or the Casper Fund if you can.

rescuedogs,2fkra5,canehdianchick,2,Fri Sep 5 19:28:56 2014 UTC,"We are sad to announce the unexpected passing of Ketza this week, one of our former adoptees who held a special place in the hearts of her rescuers and those who followed her story. In 2.5 years of operation, Ketza is our first dog to cross the rainbow bridge...  Ketza's tribute video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAog_xU3O1M&feature=youtu.be  Ketza was rescued in 2013 from Onion Lake, Saskatchewan. She was one of 4 female dogs living homeless outside with winter looming, in an area where the temperature drops to far below freezing. We immediately said yes to Ketza (although last we heard, nobody had stepped up for the other females who were thought to be pregnant, we are unsure of their fate.) This lovely girl blossomed under the care of Cecily, ""When Ketza arrived I knew as soon as I looked into her eyes that she was a special one. She didn't complain or shy away from anything. It was clear that she wanted and needed to embrace the life she now had. It is so rare for a dog from her circumstances to walk in and just ""fit"". I could find her flopped down in the middle of the living room with many other dogs running over and around her or wake up to find her snuggling beside me.  I knew she needed a very special person who could give her the life she do deserved.""  Ketza was thought to possibly be pregnant upon her arrival so when she arrived she was vet checked for pregnancy and found not to be pregnant but was instead going through a heat which meant she had to wait to be spayed. In the meantime, we received an application that we knew was meant for Ketza and she hadn't even been posted for adoption yet! ""I was in no hurry and was waiting till Ketza let me know who was right. Her dad was exactly who she needed and she was who he needed. I knew in my heart that she would have the life I had imagined."" Days before moving to her forever home as a foster-to-adopt, until she could be safely spayed and officially adopted, she was vet checked again and found to be in great health, just a handful of weeks until she could be safely spayed when her heat was over as most vets recommend. Ketza moved in with her new Dad to a very remote resort with no vet access.   To our immense surprise, less than one week after moving, Ketza gave birth to 6 healthy puppies! ""The shock that I and the rest were in when our non-pregnant Ketza gave birth was beyond words. Her dad took it all in stride and provided Ketza and the pups with the best of care and love"" said Cecily. Her Dad helped raise the pups with the help of the ranch hands and his kids and we shipped in all necessary supplies to care for them until they were old enough to be moved to a foster home where they were assessed, given full vaccinations at the vet and spayed and neutered when they reached 6 months old. Ketza's dad decided to adopt one of her pups too! Ketza got to enjoy living a free life in the wilderness with one of her pups, who all would have surely frozen to death had they been born in middle of the sub-zero Saskatchewan winter had she not been rescued.   Sadly, Ketza was hit by a vehicle this week and did not survive her injuries. We are saddened by the loss of Ketza but rejoice in the fact that she was able to have her pups safely and live a fulfilling year, loved dearly by a family. He calm loving spirit lives on in her puppies and for that we celebrate. Cecily was also honoured to foster Ketza's puppies when they were weaned up until adoption. ""They, like her, are very special dogs. I can see Ketza in the pups that I am fortunate enough to see regularly. Her calm loving spirit will live on in each one of them. Sleep well my beautiful girl. I will be there one day for more cuddles."""

Didn't have the time/patience to train or care for him (work schedule got more intense, went back to school), couldn't keep affording the food, landlord hit them with a pet fee they couldn't pay, community bylaws no longer allowed dogs, moving and couldn't take the dog with them.

And there's a chance one or two of those returns were someone just deciding they didn't want a dog anymore. Some dogs need a lot of time and patience, and people underestimate what that actually means, especially if they've never had a dog before, or never had to train their own dog. I get folks who say ""We want to adopt an adult dog so we can bypass all the mess and fuss of the puppy years,"" only to get the dog home and find it generally acting like you would expect an animal to when you bring it to a new environment where it doesn't know the rules, and all the sights, sounds, and smells are entirely new to it. Shitting in the house because it doesn't know it needs to go outside to do that; or getting into things it shouldn't because it's curious and doesn't know any better; or playing inappropriately, which is reinforced because the person's instinct is to immediately grab or yank away whatever the dog is mouthing that it shouldn't be (leashes, purses, shoes, arms), or running toward/away from the dog when it's doing something it shouldn't, thus signalling to the dog that it is playtime."

I work for an animal rescue and it's the worst feeling when I have to tell potential adopters that an animal has been returned to us while going through its history in our files, and then tell them why. Even if the problem was really specific to that situation, like the dog that came back to us because he dug holes in the backyard, which was a fruit orchard and the family's livelihood, or a cat who had some carrier anxiety and litterbox difficulties because he was punished whenever he made a mess by being stuffed into his carrier by the previous owner, who yelled at him."

rescuedogs,2f1lr9,lonelymedusa,2,Sat Aug 30 23:48:13 2014 UTC,"This is tough to answer without a bit more info.  Do you know if the dog is destructive if left alone?  Is he housebroken?  If the dog doesn't have any issues with destruction/accidents, I see no reason why the dog can't be free to wander for a bit with some really high incentive rewards while you're gone.  I'd avoid things like bully sticks since they present a choking hazard, but things like: Kongs stuffed with peanut butter/yogurt and frozen are really great if the dog is food motivated.    If the dog needs to be left in a smaller area, would a bathroom work with a nice dog bed?  Or the kitchen with some dog gates?    In an ideal situation, you'd want to slowly deal with the separation anxiety.  So, when you bring doggy home, don't just leave for an hour or two.  Put the dog somewhere safe, give him something nice to occupy his time/attention, and just walk out the door (don't say goodbye or make a scene).  Come back in 2 minutes.  Do this A LOT the first few weeks you have him before you do anything like go out to dinner or go shopping, increasing the time gone.  This should help with the separation anxiety.  Bringing a dog home is a great opportunity to have a dog re-learn behaviors since the environment and people are new.  Good luck!"
rescuedogs,2f1lr9,KatFiveE,1 point,Sun Aug 31 06:33:20 2014 UTC,"He is house trained, and they didn't say anything about destructive behaviors although I'll be sure to ask about that now... I like the idea of using the kitchen with some gates, at least at first. Since ours is more of an open floorplan, it would probably feel a lot different to him than a closed up laundry room or cage. Thank you!"
rescuedogs,2ezh69,monakitten,0,Sat Aug 30 05:37:42 2014 UTC,"First off, do NOT take the dog to any shelter. 'No Kills' are usually just places that send dogs somewhere else to be killed. Rescue groups are the ONLY solution if you want this dog to have a chance.  -Second, call the cops and report that woman who dumped this dog. NOW. (The woman who possessed the dog before she gave it away, or said she did, is also liable.) Call the cops but REFUSE to return the dog.  -Thirdly, you said you own 3 rescues. Where did you get them? I bring this up because if you went through a rescue group, they'd probably take this little one in for you. Especially since you have a full house. If they think a shelter is your only other option they'll come get the dog.  Please please please though-- no shelters period. Here is a list of good rescue groups. If you have trouble, PM me and I can also try to help you. -A Dog's Life Rescue in LA -West Coast Animal Rescue (your area) -Ace of Hearts in LA Rescues for labs would be likely to take the dog: -Indilabrescue.org -sclrr.org  -Labradorsandfriends.org  Again, get on Google and get on the phone tomorrow.

rescuedogs,2ewfcu,Xan_the_man,11,Fri Aug 29 07:32:29 2014 UTC,"He is growling because he is frightened, hungry and maybe sick. If he wont let you near him, yet, try to find some blankets and pile them up near him.  Make sure he has water and food.  Since he seems a bit skinny, try puppy food - dry and wet.  If there is a place you can give him shelter, like a crate you can cover for shelter - put some food inside with blankets.  Even an anchored cardboard box with a ""door"" will work.  If you are trying to catch him, try sitting ( get on his level so you are not so intimidating)  a distance (15 ft) from him with a couple of McDonalds burgers (or similar high value food). Toss a tiny piece to him, he'll like it and then toss another piece - this time closer to you - and so on until you may get him to eat out of your hand.  Try not to pet him right away as he may frighten and scoot back again.  Have a cloth leash ready - make a slip loop with the handle of leash. If you can get him close enough for a minute, quickly, but calmly get loop over his head and pull the slip loop tight.  Talk to him quietly and calmly the whole time.  He might freak out with the leash.  Don't pull, just keep feeding little pieces and talking calmly, he'll settle down.   Once he does calm, take to vet or shelter.  He may be microchipped and really belong to someone - have him checked out by vet or shelter to see. Good luck!"

rescuedogs,2ewfcu,3houndsmom,4,Fri Aug 29 11:14:30 2014 UTC,"Ah, introduce them on neutral territory if possible.  Not in the house, maybe have someone with Friday on a leash, and bring your other 2 outdoors to meet. If he is skittish, give him a safe place in the house (like a crate) until he is used to them and vice-versa. It may take a few days.  You mentioned he is food guarding(growling - not uncommon - may also toy guard) - keep them apart for eating  - at least at first.  I would also keep them separate during time when you are away until you are sure he is perfectly comfortable and a gentleman."

He said he was a stray and got from some people who found him and wanted him to play with his dog...but apparently this isn't happening and this dog is very hyper and trying to get out of the fenced yard and bothering the neighbors (and since he's being bad, he wanted to kick him). Now he keeps him in a cage all day. I had him send me the pictures and as you can see the dog hasn't been fixed! I told him to remember what it was like when HE was a teenager and to try to get the dog fixed and that might stop him from roaming and trying to get out but he can't afford it and doesn't want to put anymore effort in the dog. The dog seems sweet and is about a year old from what he says. Can anyone help with this poor thing? He just wants to play and be able to run free...not spend the day in a cage just because he's a boy with hormones."""
rescuedogs,2epde5,KatFiveE,1 point,Wed Aug 27 06:45:54 2014 UTC,Thank you so very much for sharing your insight and for rescuing a puppy mill survivor; not many will do this.  I'm so happy to hear that your dog finally started coming out of her shell.  It's helpful to be reminded that so very little can cause regression.  And..you're absolutely right - where she is now is way better than the shitty amish puppy mill she was in.  Poor girl.  Thank you so much for the trainer resource and for sharing your story.
rescuedogs,2epde5,bostonterrierlove,1 point,Wed Aug 27 14:39:43 2014 UTC,"She's adorable!  I think 10 days is really not very long.  I once had a foster that refused to come out of her crate for weeks without putting a leash on her and dragging her out (she would bite if you tried to pick her up).  When she was out, she would freak out, and all she did was try to get back in her crate.  I used a wire crate so she could see everything that was going on around her.  I just left the crate open and went about my business.  She was petrified and a total fear biter.  Eventually, she came out with the help of hot dogs.  One day she would willingly put one foot out because the hot dog was just out of reach, and then a little more every week.  She would bolt back in when she grabbed the hot dog, but it was a start.  Then one day she ventured out on her own.  By the time she was adopted, she was sleeping on my bed.  It took months though.    You have only had her for 10 days.  I would say if you are stressed out and afraid, she's probably also picking up on that and reacting.  Do you have other dogs?  Sometimes having another dog around to show them, for lack of a better term, ""how to be a dog"" can help, assuming they are dog-friendly.  I've seen similar behavior in lab beagles when they are sprung.  It's so sad, but beagles are a pack breed and mostly enjoy the company of other dogs.  I think time, patience, and figuring out what is going to work for her will be your best bet.  Every dog is different, and while hot dogs might have worked for Chloe, and having another dog works for others, it might be something else that works for your girl."

I think you're right that she's picking up on my stress/fear.  I don't want her to take my distress as something that's directed toward her, so I've been trying to be much more positive and less stressed out. Slow and steady progress.

We are sharing his story to (1) ask the community for support for baby Micah as he is a local dog and (2) to raise awareness of the dogs that are needing help here on the island. We often hear that people honestly didn't know situations like this happen here- we are sharing this to tell you they do and often! We hope to bring awareness to the issues we have on our island and in BC, this is NOT an isolated incident and we are constantly turning local dogs away that are in dire need like Micah because we cannot keep up with the demand.  Please donate to help Micah and dogs just like him, there will be more as there always is.  GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING  Watch Micah on video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2TBR6ua8Mw&feature=youtu.be  8 month old Micah was found on deaths door last week with over 7 gaping and severely infected cuts, so infected that he smelled of rot, flies were landing on him and maggots we infesting his deep neck and ear wounds.  Without immediate vetting Micah would have died.  Micah spent the past week under the constant care of the Central Island Emergency Vet Hospital team in Nanaimo. After 30 hours of IV fluids and pain meds, he was now stable enough for surgery. He underwent several surgeries over the next few days to flush out and close his painful gaping wounds.  He left the operating room with no less than:  -10 drains to help clean out infection  -24 staples  -48 stitches  -he also developed pneumonia from the severe infection  -a barrage of drugs needing to be administered every 2 hours, thankfully now down to every 6 hours"

Maybe obedience training would help, I'm taking my pup in next week to start group classes because as soon my cat walks into the room or we step outside for a walk it seems like he becomes deaf and blind to everything but whatever he is interested in. Teaching them the focus command really seems to  work wonders(they get a treat whenever they look at you after you say their name or tell them to focus, and then when you want them to do something you first use the focus command to get their attention and then tell them whatever else you want)  I hope all is well with your new pooch."

If it works out well, finalize the adoption.  If not, no longterm commitment.  Even if you don't keep your foster, it's still wonderful for them to get put of the shelter and into a home for a bit.  I have my foster failure laying next to me right now, and I couldn't be happier :)"
rescuedogs,2du5rz,Themoosedoc,1 point,Mon Aug 18 00:24:26 2014 UTC,My fiance fostered a lot when he was a kid so it would be something to consider since he already has experience with it. I know somebody who fosters so I'll ask her about it. I thought with fostering you couldn't adopt the dog? She had one dog she was fostering but couldn't adopt it because another family was interested.
rescuedogs,2du5rz,Themoosedoc,1 point,Mon Aug 18 00:28:34 2014 UTC,"The rescue I work with let's you know when someone is interested.  You then have 24 hours to decide if you want to officially adopt your foster.  Every rescue should have a protocol in place, but it seems silly to not be able to adopt your foster if you fall in love :). I do see that it's important for the foster family to make a decision quickly, because you don't want an adoptive family to fall through.  Check with the rescues around you and see what fits your needs."
rescuedogs,2du5rz,tommyball,1 point,Tue Aug 19 10:44:28 2014 UTC,"That's actually a really good policy. We have a few different ones around and one that definitely doesn't do fosters, adoption only. We're working on it."
rescuedogs,2du5rz,walaska,2,Tue Aug 19 20:35:34 2014 UTC,Any chance of getting your neighbors dog to meet potential dogs? The owner might say it's okay with other dogs but sometimes it doesn't work. My thought was you don't want to get a dog that will be barking at the other dog all the time.   Sometimes it's hard to gauge how a dog will be after it's been in a stable home for a while. Our rescue was very anxious and skittish for months after we got her. She had separation anxiety which was a huge issue for a while. Do either of you work close enough that you can go home for lunch to let the dog out?  Good luck!
rescuedogs,2du5rz,gwenmom,1 point,Sun Aug 17 23:27:23 2014 UTC,"That's a good idea, I'm sure she'd be open to it. I never thought of that.  We both work 20 minutes away but my fiance works a lot of split shifts so he'd be able to come by. I work in a hospital so leaving the campus for a lunch is a no-no :("
rescuedogs,2du5rz,gwenmom,2,Sun Aug 17 23:32:06 2014 UTC,"We (a couple with very similar sitzuation to yours) fostered and eventually adopted a medium-sized schnauzer.  fostering first was a great way for us to get to know the dog. It also helped us understand how our schedule was affected workwise. It did require some adaptation and we did it, but it's good that we would have had the option of giving him away (which would have been easy, we had offers).  3 things that are good about our dude that you may consider when applying for the dog:   Our fella is pretty lazy and calm, which suits our lifestyle just fine. Two walks a day, one morning / one evening, one of which is longer than an hour, depends. On weekends and occasionally during the week we'll take him on longer hikes / with us around town. He loves that, but to him there is nothing better than getting home so he can lie down on the couch and go to sleep. Vet says it's okay, just his temperament. Also he hates walks in the rain. Lastly, he is flexible about his walkies-times, which is great and brings me to my next point Despite everything, at some point you're going to have to see what your dog's limit for holding ""it"" in is. It's important to know, especially if you'll send it to a dogsitter while you go on holiday or something. With that, you can figure out how long you have between pee-runs. Fostering, at least in our case, ensured we did NOT have to pay his vet bills, which were massive at the beginning due to heartworm and a couple of other parasites ($1000+ we got back from the shelter). Had we adopted immediately, we'd have been taking money from our savings Good dogfood is often not cheap If you don't have the space to crate-train (like we didn't) barking may become a real thing you need to think about. Our fella goes for 15 minutes when we leave, luckily then he stops or we would have to do more about it. Separation anxiety is a real thing. I'm not sure what it's like in the States unfortunately, but don't be afraid to ask for an ""easier"" dog to foster for the first time (to maybe adopt). Even if you think you or your hubby have experience with dogs and could handle it, disturbed dogs are hard work that need a lot of time and patience and love. Now, usually very easy dogs aren't fostered for long since it's easy to find adopters, but if it's an overfilled shelter they will maybe still be happy to have another dog outside being socialised. If you foster and adopt the same dog, it is NOT a failure on your part. ""Failed foster"" is a euphemism for awesome people whose heart was too big to give the dog away again. You haven't mentioned interest in any particular breeds, and mutts are totally fine, but there are sometimes breed-specific shelters if you do actually have an idea of what you want. Fairly small is realistic, but I would say that if the circumstances allow it you could maybe go to small-ish retrievers or pitmixes. Maybe avoid pack-dogs because they can get depressed alone and will likely howl the house down when you're away (think Beagles). Bassenjis, pinchers, medium/small schauzers, terriers of almost all sorts including pitts, pugs, chihuahuas, cocker spaniels, shelties and many, many others are I think possibilities for you.  Here in Europe, we had a hard time getting a shelter to give us anything though because we live in an apartment. Not sure what they will say in USA."

I'm really looking for a calmer senior dog who would like to walk everyday and go on long walks one day a week. I'm not being lazy and avoiding training it just suits my lifestyle more at this time."
rescuedogs,2du5rz,justgoawayplease,1 point,Mon Aug 18 17:15:06 2014 UTC,"Ask at the shelter about dogs that are in foster homes. You could get a much better sense of their behavior if they are not in a stressful setting. Second the idea of having your potential pup meet the neighbor dog, just don't do it on the pit's territory, meet in a neutral area.  Also discuss your specific needs with the shelter's adoption people, they can often help you narrow your choices to dogs that will work best for you."

We got updates all night last night about Yoda getting visits from family and friends.  He's doing well.  That's how we measure success.

After staying at the vet for a few days, I bought her home to nurse back to health and once she was crazy and rambunctious like kittens should be, she moved to a new foster home (where they foster failed!).   I'm glad there are homes like yours out there.  The one thing we desperately need more of is foster homes.  Thank you for being one for you area!  It sounds like your rescue or shelter is very lucky."

He's so wrinkly he suffers from skin conditions and takes plenty of medicine to keep him from stinking up a room (no fault of his own).  He was neutered a couple weeks ago and on a trip to go pee pee, we noticed his urine had so much blood in it that it looked like iodine!  Back to the vet we went. They found nothing, gave him some antibiotics and he's back to full health.  This weekend he goes to his fur-ever home!  Yay for Yoda!  Follow our efforts at Giant Hearts Giant Dog Rescue.

So far she's done great on the car ride, she loved cuddles and loves her crate. She knows sit, paw, and lay down- but isn't too excited to play with toys. We also had a mishap today where she slipped between my legs out the door and went after a rabbit, and wouldn't obey my call back. This is understandable I guess but very scary living in a city. She also pulls a tonnnn on the leash while we walk. All in all, I'm happy to have my lil nugget at last."

She'll probably get used to the toys once she's settled in a bit more. Find something she loves to do!

rescuedogs,2cuvc1,LongDogSilver,5,Thu Aug 7 04:54:56 2014 UTC,"Owner of two ""real"" rescues here.  I agree with the author's stance, but she seems like a hypocrite. I know she says she's ""doing it the right way"", but you can't breed dogs and in the same breath strongly condemn breeding dogs.  I get that there are differences. She's against those who do it just to make cute dogs and turn a profit and she's doing it to get ""puppies that are truly better than both parents""... but what's the real difference? Couldn't the people she's against use the same argument?  I dunno. If she has a way to 100% guarantee that all of her puppies find forever homes, then I guess I'm ok with it.   But at this point in time I think it's probably best to stop intentionally breeding any dogs other than those going directly into service. Mutts are just fine for 98% of dog owners."
rescuedogs,2cuvc1,HaYuFlyDisTang,1 point,Thu Aug 7 20:28:21 2014 UTC,"Would you consider a competition agility dog a service dog?  I ask because I currently have two rescues (an Aussie and a real mutt of a dog). I've been wanting to do agility for years now, and I'm finally in a place where I can do it. The rescue mutt is absolutely terrified of the equipment, loud noises, and anytime I pick up an object larger than a food bowl... and this is after a couple of years of purely positive reinforcement training. The Aussie, who was surrendered by his first owners, just gets it. His breed is more suited to it. I'm strongly considering buying a dog (a first for me) in a few years who will be intended as a competition dog. Of course, I wouldn't return him or her if competition didn't work out, but I have to say that I appreciate working dog breeders. This is coming from somebody who used to strongly condone any kind of breeding."
rescuedogs,2cuvc1,giro_,1 point,Fri Aug 8 23:56:23 2014 UTC,"That's sort of a gray area to me. As long as the dog would never be abandoned based on performance it sounds fine. However...  I know mutts wouldn't stand a chance against a dog bred for competition, but what if everyone just had mutts?  What if instead of breeding for the traits it took to be good at agility, schutzund, dock jumping, or any other competition, we all scouted out dogs for these purposes? The shelter I got my second dog from had a small agility course. If I wanted to I could have ran their dogs through it and picked out a mutt who enjoyed the activity as much as I did.  I know it won't happen, but I think that is a better way. If I were interested in competing, I would scout out a rescue that was interested in doing what I was interested in rather than buying or breeding one.  But again, I do understand that to do these things at high levels (currently) you have to have a dog bred specifically for the purpose."
rescuedogs,2cuvc1,HaYuFlyDisTang,1 point,Sat Aug 9 00:34:00 2014 UTC,I agree with you completely.   I always wonder how much of a difference we could make as a nation if we stopped breeding dogs for one full year. Imagine the impact!

rescuedogs,2caihe,ggiwtharas,3,Fri Aug 1 00:32:21 2014 UTC,"She is probably not ""good with kids"" and other dogs because these 2 breeds are ""herding dogs"", that is, they are ankle nippers which is how they herd sheep, cattle, etc.  They will instinctively to herd anything.  I knew one who would try to herd flies.  They are also barkers (part of the herding).  This dog may try to herd the cat.    That said, they need to be tired out, they have a huge amount of energy, they are working dogs.  If you can run her good in the morning and evening, she may lose some of that need to keep busy. Probably would need lots of toys to keep her busy - Lots of toys that make her think, they are smart dogs.     As you do not know her exact history, she may not have had lots of cuddling early on, so that may not be something she is used to, but could learn to love!  If her previous owners did not understand her physical/ mental needs, she may just be aloof with people and need to learn to trust again.  Maybe the SPCA has a foster to adopt program, where you take her home and see how it works out.  Just make sure you tire her out before taking her in so the cat stands a chance.  Be mindful that it may take a few days for her to adjust being around a cat.  Maybe the SPCA can ""cat test"" her.  If in good health, these dogs tend to be wonderful agility dogs.  They like to learn new things, and if ""worn out"" enough at the end of the day, will happily curl up by your feet.  A good ""positive"" trainer can help you get her focused on you.  You will need to make sure you can keep up with her physical and mental needs to keep her (and you) happy together.   Good Luck - she's a beauty!"

rescuedogs,2c6dlw,kholling1,5,Wed Jul 30 20:57:57 2014 UTC,"All 4 of my dogs were / are rescues.  The first one was a breeding dog at a puppy mill.  She was just thrilled to have freedom and never had issues.  The second had a horrible first six years - never seeing sunlight, living in a box in the mud with his litter mates/ other dogs.  He had some skittishness, but learned quickly to trust and LOVED EVERYTHING about life.  The 4th one, was thrown out of a moving vehicle over a bridge.  He has issues.  Has severe separation anxiety ( the meds have helped and he is fine with this), but certain things make him cower, and I think why? It's just you and me, but overall, no issues.  Now my 3rd one, a female was terribly abused.  She was malnourished, had mange and was about to be euthanized, but someone felt bad and called the rescue I deal with.  She was bounced from shelter to vet to another vet to rescue to a foster home and finally to me in a matter of months.  Emotionally she was a hot mess when she got to me. She was a coonhound mix. No front teeth - probably kicked out, and cowered at EVERYTHING.  The first night she never put her head down to sleep.  She was forever my work in progress.  It took 3 years for me to be able to put my arms around her to hug her without her retreating after 5 seconds.  Once she realized a hug was just a hug, and love, with no harm to come, she wanted to hug all the time.  She was even wary of food.  I used to joke that with any new item she was offered she did everything but send it out for forensic testing.  I do not know what goes on their head, but I found that downplaying it and almost ""forcing"" love on her had a positive effect, eventually.  Had I played it her way, she would have been more comfortable just receiving food/shelter from me, but once she discovered love and affection, she became a happy and occasionally playful pup. She was very serious, and an ""old soul"", but was ""my best girlfriend"".  She wasn't terribly bright, but she was intuitive - she operated on instinct.    As for the treats - that is a huge plus, actually.  I always used a ""special treat"" when I left the house - only time they got that particular treat.  It was so they knew I was going, and I would give them the same one when I came back.  SO they waited for that treat, they knew I was coming back when that treat was given.  This worked out well with my 2nd guy.   During his last year he was deaf and blind.  But he knew when I had to go out and when I got that treat, he would go to his ""spot"" and patiently wait for my return.  It's how he knew I was leaving.  During that time, if I left a room, and he didn't know it, he would come looking for me panicked.  But when he got that treat, he knew I was going out and all was good.   Yes, we have to buy their trust and affection with treats, but really, with what they had been through, I think they are deserving.  I think they do remember.  My really scary dog had nightmares ALL THE TIME.  She would just lash out and snarl until I called her name.  It was frightening to me at first, but as she settled in they went from 2-3 x a night to once every 2 months.  But I truly think they remember, but like with humans, it moves further back in their memories and they learn to love and trust.  Your pup might always cower at times, but minimize your response, keep the treats in the plan and give her an extra hug.   Much luck - they are lucky to have found you and in reality, they know it.  Sorry for the wall of text, but it is a subject close to my heart."

rescuedogs,2b0wpu,jacybear,1 point,Wed Jul 23 00:27:31 2014 UTC,There are a lot of beagle / dachshund in the community we pull from...and after a toxic reaction to ivermectin meds the vet figures some collie as the breed has known issues with that med.

rescuedogs,2aoze0,CapitalizedInterest,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:30:40 2014 UTC,"You may find that these rescues that pull from high kill (or Open access) shelters are private.  That is, they don't have a ""shelter"", per se, they simply pull, foster in private homes and then transport to NE rescues.  That means many of those folks have jobs, and do this rescuing on the side.  It is purely a volunteer effort.  The best bet is to try and identify the rescues in your area that take these dogs and go through them to get a dog from the south.  It will be the rescues in your area that will do the adopting.  That means you fill out an application with them, they help you identify a dog that fits into the lifestyle of you and your wife and they have the dog transported, neutered, fully vetted, vaccinated and in tip top shape.  They will also be able to give you a better idea of the dogs background, their personalities, etc. You pay a fee to them (and while may seem expensive) is really inexpensive in terms of the money they lay out to get you a healthy, usually fairly happy pup.    Good for you for adopting, esp. dogs from the south.  Please do not be intimidated, or put out, by a reputable rescues lengthy app.  They go through all of the work, and want to make sure the dog goes to a home that will love and care for it for their WHOLE life, esp. when it is old and may need more care.  They want to make sure you are looking for a family member for life.    Best is if you have an idea of what you are looking for in terms of temperament, level of activity.  Most dogs coming from the south are hound/ hound mixes.   Many of the females have usually reproduced and are turned over b/c they ""got themselves pregnant"" - sadly the mentality of the owners is well - the dogs are usually smarter, we'll say.  If you have only e-mailed Friday - be patient.  Wait a couple days, and if you don't hear, leave a message (if one is available) or e-mail again.  Like I said, these folks are so very busy trying to save lives, and sometimes, they are involved in transport, which generally occurs on weekends when most volunteers are available.  Good luck and I hope you find a friend for life.  Be patient and love them, and they will be loyal and loving for their entire life.  Sorry for the wall of text, but my heart is big for rescued pups (esp from the south - all 3 of mine came from that direction :-)"
rescuedogs,2aoze0,3houndsmom,1 point,Mon Jul 14 21:01:19 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reply.  I am definitely going to follow through and re-email.    The the ""shelter"" with the dog I'm interested in is as you say a private rescue, without a facility, and the dog I'm enamored with is being fostered near me.  Through the group's facebook page, the current foster has identified themselves.  Would it be weird / overstepping for me to reach out directly to the foster if I still haven't heard anything back from the group / main contact in a couple of days?  Obviously this would be in the next couple of days, if I still don't hear any response back from the prior message and a follow up one.  Thanks!"
rescuedogs,2aoze0,3houndsmom,2,Tue Jul 15 00:58:19 2014 UTC,"Absolutely reach out to the foster, the sooner the better. MANY rescues allow a foster to make a decision on the new ""furever family"" - or at least have a say in the final decision.  Fosters are the best - they can tell you every little quirk the dog might have - what treats / toys they like, how they sleep, etc.  2 of my 3 were in foster - and they were everything I was told they were.  No real surprises.  The third I got directly from an open access shelter - and they were about 90% wrong on everything about him.  LOL - wouldn't part with him for the world, but he's a bit more psychotic than I would have liked, but doggie downers have kept us both sane.  (He has severe separation anxiety).  But I really won - because he is without question the smartest dog I have ever had.  But yes - do contact the foster directly if that is an option and introduce yourself, tell them you e-mailed the other rescue and how interested you are.  Dedicated fosters will set the wheels in motion, because for every pup they find a good home for, there is another one to take their place, another life saved!  Let me know how you make out .  ALL the best - and if I can answer any questions for you - please feel free to ask!  Much luck!"

rescuedogs,2aks86,Boles83,5,Sun Jul 13 11:01:21 2014 UTC,"Hopefully he likes cats, and doesn't feel the need to chase them :-).  Other than that, I would just have plenty of chew bones ( I prefer nylabones - most durable) and toys to keep him happy and entertained. Initially, he will probably be sedate - just because he is in a new environment and learning the territory.  You may need to keep him confined to one room when you are not there, but everything is going to be trial and error.  Discuss with the vet exactly what he can and can't do, for example, can you walk him down the block and back, how many times a day.  Make sure you keep him leashed outdoors so he has no chance of overdoing it.  Also, as he is new to you - he has much to learn, so any training you can give him, such as sit, lay, paw, etc. etc, without getting him too worked up will make things better.  Even older, adult dogs need to learn your schedule, the way you want him to do things, etc.  Just remember - don't lose patience with him, he will be in a new setting with limitations placed upon him - accidents will happen, and the more excited (upset) you may get, will fire him up more.  Congrats on the new pup - and I wish you many years of happiness together.  Hope this helps."
rescuedogs,2aks86,3houndsmom,1 point,Sun Jul 13 12:03:24 2014 UTC,So he is definitely interested in playing with the cats....and they are definitely not interested in the same. We got him a one chew bones and have put the cats in a closed room while he checks everything out.
rescuedogs,2aks86,bostonterrierlove,2,Sun Jul 13 19:46:07 2014 UTC,"Thank you SO much for adopting a HW positive dog! I don't know where you're located, but around here, the treatment is several weeks of oral meds. HW was never a big issue here until people brought back rescue dogs from Hurricane Katrina. Now more and more dogs are popping positive, and the ""official"" treatment meds have been on back order for years. The alternative does seem to work (I've fostered and treated several).  As far as keeping him calm, I usually recommend that adopters tether a new dog to them while potty training so they are never out of sight and you can watch and see when they might start circling or acting like they need to go potty. I have a running lead with a strap that goes around your waist that works well, but even just a lead tied to a belt loop works. This would probably help with keeping him from tearing around the house and would probably help to keep your kitties safe in the event he does want to chase them and you don't have control. I would crate when you're not able to watch him though."

Your new dog will want to check out everything, most probably the kitties. I think the main thing you will need to do is train him not to chase kitties. I dog sit for a friend of mine when they go on vacation, and when Sam first came here he was fascinated with the kitties. He also had to deal with my two Labs and German Shepherd. Just give him some time and scold him if he chases the cats. He will learn fast enough. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the kitties likes to play with him. I am also going to tell you a toy that my dog was given and every dog seems to love.

If he does lose his vision, he will adapt fairly easily.  Remember, dogs operate a lot on instinct and their sense of smell.  As he is a mix, he may not lose vision.  I would think long and hard about this, maybe even talk to someone with a disabled dog.  If you are super concerned, I would not adopt, as you may be inclined to return him if more problems develop, and that would be tragic for him once he has bonded with you.  Patience ,understanding, and dedication are key.  But I think you would find his loyalty, love and devotion unwavering.  Good luck."

rescuedogs,29980r,lollyopple,2,Fri Jun 27 17:25:56 2014 UTC,"Have you tried networking him to rescue groups across facebook?? Sharing dogs on FB has become an enormous leg-up in rehoming. If you haven't already, start spreading his picture around there!"
rescuedogs,29980r,Stef41,1 point,Fri Jun 27 18:33:43 2014 UTC,"yes - everybody says ""super cute dog, good luck"" =( all my friends are sick of seeing him on FB too lol. I did put a post on CL as well, but I deleted it because I don't want to attract someone who might hurt him.  What's funny is people are selling blue nose pit puppies in my area for $250+, it just seems ironic that people pay that much for a dog and then throw them away (totally extrapolating here). You can't give a blue nose adult away lol. I also tried posters around my area."
rescuedogs,29980r,liah,1 point,Fri Jun 27 19:28:29 2014 UTC,$250?! You'd be lucky as hell to get a bluenose for that price up here. You can't even rescue a dog for $250 here (it's at least $325 for adult dogs). You're looking at at least $700.. and that's the backyard breeders.  I evidently need to go to California.

rescuedogs,291604,3houndsmom,2,Wed Jun 25 21:31:08 2014 UTC,They said he was a shepherd mix for some reason but he looks an awful lot like a coon-hound.  Dat bay doe.

rescuedogs,28yctl,takethemoneyrun,3,Tue Jun 24 10:18:08 2014 UTC,"Make sure to teach him manners and show that off to anyone that comes to look at him.

Go to any local event in the area that allows dogs."

rescuedogs,28vl98,jillm23,4,Mon Jun 23 15:10:35 2014 UTC,"My biggest advice is to be at the event with him. Hold him in your lap, walk him around. He is already feeling safer with you and so it is a little traumatic for him to go some where without you there the whole time. Sometimes this works, sometimes not. One of my fosters would scream everytime I left to go get a drink or the bathroom ;)  Oh and write bios of him to put on his crate at the events, cute stuff to show his personality."
rescuedogs,28vl98,littlewolfen,1 point,Mon Jun 23 15:31:02 2014 UTC,"Yes, we already planned to make a sign that shared all of his awesome traits. My only question with staying, is will people assume he is already being adopted if we are holding him and not come over?"
rescuedogs,28vl98,littlewolfen,4,Mon Jun 23 15:49:31 2014 UTC,"Maybe so see if you can make an ""Adopt me bandana"" and maybe pin a note on your shirt that says ""Ask me about My Foster Dog""."
rescuedogs,28vl98,rottnzonie,2,Mon Jun 23 16:53:37 2014 UTC,Very good advice!!
rescuedogs,28vl98,ShiftyEyesMcGee,1 point,Mon Jun 23 18:49:44 2014 UTC,"He is adorable. My advice would to give him some time to settle before you take him around to unfamiliar places. After being in the shelter, dogs tend to be traumatized even if nothing awful happened to them before they ended up there... I've done fosters and adoptions, and every dog didn't display their real personality for a couple of months at least. They also need at least a week of calm and sleep, they don't get much of that in a shelter either. My last shelter adoption was about a year ago, and for the first 3 months she never made a sound. Then very slowly, she started to make all kinds of little noises, then bark, then howl.. She's actually very talkative at this point, she barks whenever she can get away with it, she howls at sires, and growls when she plays or when she wants attention. Take your time! Dogs are creatures of habit, and in a new place they need time to get new habits. Once they have a routine and are secure with it, they'll start to change. :-)"
rescuedogs,28vl98,ladym4ssacre,2,Mon Jun 23 18:26:31 2014 UTC,"Yes, one of our other dogs was a rescued stray. Almost two years later and she is finally being herself. Dancing for food, howling at us and demanding to be petted.   My deal with my husband was that we would only do short term fostering (no more than 4 weeks at a time). So I need to get him adopted quickly. The shelter did tell me if he wasn't adopted, she would try to find another foster. I would never allow him to be put back on the kill list so quick adoption is my plan or making my husband very angry and keeping him for a bit longer. Hopefully the former!"
rescuedogs,28vl98,duppyconquerer,1 point,Mon Jun 23 18:53:12 2014 UTC,"This depends on where you live... I personally tend to foster dogs that don't do well with other dogs (because I don't own one myself and it's easy for us). Obviously crowded and crazy adoption events don't usually show them in the best light...  Our tactic is to take lots of cute pictures to post online and keep their online bio updated on new behaviors and funny little anecdotes about them. We also live in a big city so I take fosters out with me when I do errands, and we go for walks in populated areas often. When people on the street say ""cute dog!"" or ""can we pet him?"" I always say of course! And actuallllyy I'm fostering this dog, he's up for adoption!  Sometimes we get adopters that way, or their friend/family member happens to be looking foe a dog etc  Good luck and thank you for fostering!!"

rescuedogs,28lo0u,canehdianchick,1 point,Fri Jun 20 00:46:57 2014 UTC,Why does it matter? Both dogs are in need of a family; we just know who to blame in the case of rehoming.
rescuedogs,28lo0u,flume,1 point,Fri Jun 20 22:53:32 2014 UTC,"The difference is in the support system. Not every dog needing re homing is in need of rescue. Often times, owners who want to do good by their pets are capable of re-homing themselves. We are happy to educate on home selection, adoption processes and what to look for in potential adopters. If they are able to do this process themselves than it leaves rescue resources and foster homes available for dogs who have no one to speak for them or who are in much dire circumstances.  Of course there are dogs who are owner surrenders who are in need of getting out ASAP."

I offered to help him out and find him a home. Now I have two dogs. I love the new little guy and so does my older dog, so it works out great. Good luck with your new pup! :)"
rescuedogs,28kfq6,snowboo,2,Fri Jun 20 01:43:36 2014 UTC,"Well I'm actually in a similar boat as you. I picked up a dog last week that's a blue nose pit and she is thin as a rail and her neck is rubbed raw from her collar. We rescued her (someone found her in their yard and couldn't keep her) and the humane society is full here and our animal shelter is a kill shelter so we don't use them.   Pretty much what we're doing is training her so that she will be more adoptable. It's so much easier to find a dog a home when they are house broken (or at least potty trained) and can do basic commands such as sit, stay, and lay down. It's all good if you can teach them how to walk on a leash correctly.   It may be difficult to ""rehabilitate"" her, as I don't know what behaviors she is exhibiting. She may have come from a bad situation but she may do extremely well in a caring home. The pit that we rescued is literally the sweetest dog I have ever met. She doesn't know how to handle being loved on so she just kind of lays against us and gets really excited.   Couple of questions, is she underfed? (Can you see her ribs and does her stomach dip significantly on both sides?) If she is under fed, you may need to give her half portions of food at first and then give her the second half thirty minutes later (dogs that have been starved can eat until they literally make themselves sick or die from it).   If she's not exhibiting any behavioral issues per say or you just want some general knowledge in more training you should check out Zak George on youtube. He's got a TON of training videos that focus on positive reinforcement rather than on punishment. It's worked great on our pups at home."
rescuedogs,28kfq6,snowboo,2,Thu Jun 19 19:33:59 2014 UTC,"Oh also, you should post pictures of her on facebook or whatever social network you know to get the word out to friends. She doesn't necessarily need to go to the shelter or rescue center before being adopted.   I was able to find an 11 yr old husky with health issues a home about an hour and a half from me (we met in the middle) because I had posted on Facebook and it was shared a few times. It was a perfect match, they had an older husky and wanted a playmate."

rescuedogs,28an39,thatoneguy889,8,Mon Jun 16 17:34:25 2014 UTC,"Petfinder itself is extremely legit but I don't think they thoroughly qualify posters. That being said, there are many small rescues that operate with very little business savvy so I would definitely give this rescue a chance. Just don't do anything stupid like let them send people to your house before you've met or spoken to anyone. Otherwise, it's kind of hard for you to get scammed...   As far as contact information is concerned, there's a reason that many rescues don't make their addresses available. It's to deter abandonments and drop-offs. My rescue operates over capacity and I can't have people leaving dogs at my building, so I only give people my address once I know who they are and what they want, have their name and contact information, and have scheduled an appointment for them."
rescuedogs,28an39,AgentDL,3,Mon Jun 16 17:57:06 2014 UTC,"Petfinder is only as legitimate as it's users. They don't comb through everyone who posts their listings; there are rescues on their database that haven't been active in years, multiple listings for the same animal, fake listings for silly things (I once saw a teenager posted there as a 'kid' goat, poor kid still hasn't been adopted), rescues with no way to contact them, etc. It's not common at all, mind you. But just because it is on Petfinder doesn't mean it should automatically be trusted. Think of Petfinder as being a Facebook for shelters and rescues; most people would be pretty truthful and use the site as intended because they just want to use it to connect with others. However you have a few people who make fake accounts just for the fun of it or to advertise or god knows what. Again, it's not very common (especially for Petfinder) but it does happen, you should always look into the shelter/rescue before adopting.  As for this scenario, why not contact them to see what's up? There may be a good reason why they don't have their address on Petfinder. Just don't let them do a house visit before visiting their grounds. This rescue might be ran at home, or as mentioned, they don't want drop offs. I'd say give them a chance before writing them off, but if red flags start popping up, by all means run away."
rescuedogs,28an39,Mad_Marchie,1 point,Mon Jun 16 19:11:09 2014 UTC,"In order to post a pet for adoption on petfinder, I am almost positive the shelter has to be a registered non profit.  Some shelters are small and/or new and some start out as only foster homes and they don't have an actual shelter.  Don't overlook the dog just because of that.  :)"
rescuedogs,28an39,Kristycat,3,Tue Jun 17 03:52:53 2014 UTC,We actually just got in contact with someone at the rescue and found out that they are actually 60 miles away. I asked them why they were listed in my town and she said that they just list the dogs in different cities all over the county for more exposure. The deception (and the distance) just kind of turned us off from adopting from them. We did find another puppy at a much closer rescue and will probably be able to get her this weekend.
rescuedogs,28an39,Kristycat,1 point,Tue Jun 17 04:03:25 2014 UTC,That sucks! I don't know why they would do that! That is deceptive and I would feel the same way.  Thank you for adopting! Not all shelters are deceptive like that!

rescuedogs,28867o,neur0,2,Sun Jun 15 20:51:19 2014 UTC,"What a cutie!    As for your question about fetch: not all dogs have the instincts to play fetch or really enjoy it. My gal plays fetch, but to her it is more like a job. ""The ball is thrown, I go get it and give it back."" She doesn't seem to like it nearly as much as the dogs you see at the park. What I'm trying to say is that yes, you could teach your dog to play fetch, but will take time and may now be worth it.    To teach fetch: First, you'll have to work towards getting him interested in the item you want him to fetch. Once he'll play with it togethrr with you, try tossing it and see if he'll follow. Then you need to teach him the three important behaviors involved with fetch: pick it up, bring it to me, drop it. With enough practice, he'll get the hang of it.  Your dog may learn to love fetch, or not. If it's not up his alley, you might instead work on new exciting tricks. There are infinite possibilities for what your little guy can do. You could also teach him hide and seek or other fun games! Good luck!"
rescuedogs,28867o,MySapphy,1 point,Mon Jun 16 00:17:21 2014 UTC,Wanted to say thanks for the suggestion. I'll look into other activities. What's a sure fire way you get your dog to enjoy the activities rather than work?
rescuedogs,28867o,MySapphy,1 point,Fri Jun 20 21:59:21 2014 UTC,"I don't think there is a sure fire way to make them enjoy something. It's like if a child didn't like to play tag, you could keep playing it with them and trying to make it more fun. Maybe it will work, or maybe not. Definitely teach your dog fetch, and hopefully if you play it enough together, he'll start to enjoy it. :)    If not, like I said, not all dogs have the prey drive/retrieval instincts to go for fetch. Lots of other games and things to play together!"
rescuedogs,28867o,dog_hair_dinner,1 point,Fri Jun 20 22:13:15 2014 UTC,"Hi there, dog trainer here! Rawhides are fine in controlled amounts, such as a treat once a week. And yes, sticks can be bad if they splinter and the dog swallows it. I'd recommend antlers that you can usually find at pet stores now. Depending on your dog's chewing strength they can last anywhere from 1 week to 1 year. They're expensive, but I've had many customers rave about them."

rescuedogs,27yymu,nosila221,6,Thu Jun 12 15:31:16 2014 UTC,"The whole head/face shape is definitely Weimaraner. As for mix, it's anybody's guess, but I would say pitbull,  american bulldog etc. are pretty good guesses."
rescuedogs,27yymu,Bergamasco,3,Thu Jun 12 17:42:09 2014 UTC,"I've met a lot of Dane mixes and that looks possible to me. You should try a DNA test, I bet that would be fun and interesting to see for her."
rescuedogs,27yymu,zoethezoologist,1 point,Thu Jun 12 19:43:11 2014 UTC,"I think we will, just because it would be interesting like you said. Have you heard much about how accurate they are? I've heard mixed reviews."
rescuedogs,27yymu,Cat-a-saurus,3,Thu Jun 12 22:19:09 2014 UTC,"I like Wisdom Panel a lot! I've done two. One was for a total 'mutt' dog. I suspected beagle and shep. The results came back as: beagle, german shep, basset, old english sheepdog! The second was for a dog who came from a hoarding case. I was at the home doing medical for all of the dogs coming out of the house, and MANY were purebred. I suspected she was yorkie and maltese. The results came back as: 50% Maltese (straight up one parent's lineage) and 25% Yorkie, 25% Poodle (the other parent was Yorkie/Poodle).   Another friend did Wisdom Panel for her dog. He was supposed to be a mastiff mix but he definitely wasn't big enough once he hit full grown. He turned out to be a 'pure bred' Boxweiler. One parent was full boxer and the other full rottweiler. As we realized this, it was COMPLETELY obvious in his looks. His face is very boxer, his body is very rottie. It totally made sense."
rescuedogs,27yymu,zoethezoologist,2,Thu Jun 12 23:53:19 2014 UTC,"We sold Wisdom Panel ones at the shelter I worked at, and for the most part they all made sense.  But there are some dogs with proven breeding history that end up looking like a completely different predominant mix.  So I trust even the weird ones."
rescuedogs,27yymu,ShiftyEyesMcGee,1 point,Thu Jun 12 22:30:21 2014 UTC,"I think the DNA tests are really interesting even when you get broad mixed reviews! They usually don't work well if both sides of the genetics are highly mixed breeds going back 3 generations. But if there's a full bred or 50% bred dog in the lineage it'll pick it up. The rescue I work with uses them on occasion when fosters are willing to pay for them!  In my experience, if you don't understand or aren't happy with the results you get sent, give the company a call! They're almost always happy to explain the results in more depth with you and theorize on what they found.  Good luck :)  p.s. My vote is weimaraner,  great dane, lab, one of the Billie breeds :)"
rescuedogs,27yymu,rottnzonie,3,Thu Jun 12 23:12:18 2014 UTC,"I would say a mix of black lab and pit.. depending on size, its hard to say from photos, but if he's over 80 lbs, you can throw in a dane lineage... I have a pit that looks just like this :-) http://imgur.com/tT45iOj  Also consider that most shelter dogs are mixed breeds, and with the prevalence of pitties in shelters and on the streets, there is always a good chance they're mixed in somewhere along the line. Love them!   edit: add last paragraph"
rescuedogs,27yymu,SonotaShorty,2,Thu Jun 12 23:21:21 2014 UTC,"The coloring makes me think something other than just lab/Weimerainer, since neither of those breeds have white patches of coloring. Definitely could be pittie!"

rescuedogs,27ffwb,canehdianchick,8,Fri Jun 6 00:04:00 2014 UTC,It baffles me that people don't want to pay an adoption fee (usually in the low $100s) when a pure bred puppy could run them thousands of dollars.
rescuedogs,27ffwb,workacct1,3,Fri Jun 6 12:35:34 2014 UTC,They're not the kind of people who will go to an actual breeder who rightfully charges that amount. They're the ones on kijiji and craigslist looking for backyard breeders or pet stores.
rescuedogs,27ffwb,liah,0,Fri Jun 6 20:38:25 2014 UTC,"Absolutely! Searching for the ""free dog"" ads."
rescuedogs,27ffwb,Tiffhoney,5,Sat Jun 7 14:59:15 2014 UTC,"I thought maybe other rescues, societies, groups may be having the same issues and want to follow the template. We asked for the vetting we receive on both a 50 lb male and 50 lb female then found the average of this cost from all 3 veterinarians we use most frequently. Considering we also take on a lot of extreme medical cases and our adoption fees are much less than the outcome of this survey.. I hope we may make some leeway with those who don't understand that there are costs associated for rescues."
rescuedogs,27ffwb,Tiffhoney,4,Fri Jun 6 00:18:34 2014 UTC,"And that is for a healthy dog.  Throw in the need for a dental or mange treatment or something not so easily treated and they become dogs worth a mint. They don't understand that rescues take the dogs that shelters don't want to put the money into.  And along with fundraising, adoption fees have to cover a small bit of it."
rescuedogs,27ffwb,AlwaysDisposable,4,Fri Jun 6 05:33:33 2014 UTC,"Absolutely! We have our one major mange case who will be an easy $2000 once it's all said and done ... 4-6months with us until he will be even considered adoptable!!!   My next graph... I'm going to do a visual of our last year in dogs comparing vet fees to adoption fees and showcasing the percentile that is made up of donations or fundraiser money. Fundraisers are no walk in the park either... I have learned the hard way that bake sales cost way more $$ and energy than they seem to return. Sticking to raffles, events and our prize wheel!  I completely went off track there!"
rescuedogs,27ffwb,AlwaysDisposable,1 point,Fri Jun 6 06:21:02 2014 UTC,"I am part of a rescue.  I'd love it if I could share the information you compile, with my group.  Would that be okay?"
rescuedogs,27ffwb,Happy-feets,1 point,Fri Jun 6 15:01:29 2014 UTC,Absolutely... I will share once complete. We have several vets as we operate island wide and Vancouver island is 300 miles long and 30-40 mi les wide!
rescuedogs,27ffwb,soopadog,4,Fri Jun 6 16:21:33 2014 UTC,"Right?! I rescued a dog last year and between multiple mange treatments, multiple deworming treatments, all his shots, neutering, huge amounts of food, collars/tags/leashes/halters/etc, flea and heartworm medication for almost a year...I was easily $1,000+ invested in this dog. That's why he went from this to THIS! So that $100 rehoming fee was nothing. The woman who took him in thought nothing of it, but some people definitely expect to just get handed an animal for free. And those are people I don't want to deal with!"
rescuedogs,27ffwb,amadeobellotti,3,Fri Jun 6 15:26:04 2014 UTC,Wow great work!!!!!! Absolutely adore the after shot!!!!  Oh god I had the worst adoption... our new volunteer had never went over adoption fees during home visit...and the adopter never read our auto reply that goes over all faqs when you apply. .. so I go to do paperwork and dog transfer... family thought she was free.  It was a rough moment!!! The dog wad one who had had t.p.o surgery as well so they at least understood after but it was awkward and uncomfortable.
rescuedogs,27ffwb,dog_hair_dinner,3,Fri Jun 6 16:19:28 2014 UTC,"Oh sheesh. I made sure to mention the fee multiple times. I was like, ""He's going to come with his kennel, food, heartworm medicine, leash and collar, toys...so for $100 you have basically everything you need!"" And things like that. The money exchange was super awkward nonetheless because the woman got so into talking to me that she got all the way to the final handshake before I had to remind her that she hadn't actually given me the money. Nothing malicious, just an honest oversight. I'm so bad in social situations so I kept avoiding it because I thought surely she'll remember. lol  Here's a bonus pic of Chance with his new friend in his new home. :)"
rescuedogs,27f3do,DrLodz,5,Thu Jun 5 21:49:10 2014 UTC,At risk of being busted for this comment ...  Steal the dog.  I do it all the time. It's often the only solution since Animal Control rarely cares.
rescuedogs,27f3do,cdahlkvist,1 point,Fri Jun 6 00:04:01 2014 UTC,I like the concept but OP lives next door. How hard would it be for the neglectful owners to find the dog?
rescuedogs,27f3do,Happy-feets,1 point,Fri Jun 6 21:01:02 2014 UTC,Find a friend to hide the dog until you can get a rescue involved.
rescuedogs,27f3do,cdahlkvist,2,Fri Jun 6 22:28:57 2014 UTC,"I think you should firmly but nicely suggest the owner take better care of the dog. I mean if they are the owner and took on the responsibilities that having a dog entails, then your neighbor needs to get there act together.   It's probably easier said than done but what happens when you go on vacation or you're too busy to feed the dog extra?  And I'm surprised the animal control people didn't say anything about the dog sleeping/eating in its own poop."
rescuedogs,27f3do,D-woo19,2,Thu Jun 5 23:32:04 2014 UTC,"I worked with a rescue in New England for a while that partnered with a shelter in Arkansas and saw this type of situation often. A lot of people in southern states have a different social interaction with their dogs... (clearly not everyone, obviously because you care and there are lots of rescues!!).  Personally I don't understand why anyone would keep animals if they don't use them as companion animals or work animals.... it doesn't even seem as though your neighbors use their dogs as guard dogs if they're kept in a cage all the time?  Anyway, small rant over, my advice is to contact a rescue in your general area. They might be able to pressure Animal Control into doing something. You could also take pictures on certain days when conditions are especially worse so you have evidence ie if it's 100+ degrees outside and there's no water for the dog etc. Or try keeping a log of when you feed the dog, it can't be used as evidence but it might help a little....  If you need help finding a rescue near you, I suggest putting your zipcode into Petfinder.com and narrowing the search parameters to ""dog"" only. You can then click on a rescues link and get their contact info.  Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions!"
rescuedogs,27f3do,ShiftyEyesMcGee,2,Fri Jun 6 02:22:25 2014 UTC,"Please rescue this dog. Please. I'm looking at my pittie, who was neglected and abandoned, and right now I'm crying remembering what she looked like when she came to me.   Please help this dog. If you don't, who will?"
rescuedogs,27f3do,okdanasrsly,1 point,Fri Jun 6 03:19:55 2014 UTC,"I just checked on the dog and it did not have food again so I fed it. It does have sufficient water. The animal control person had stated that the owner had an automatic feeder setup, but I looked around and could not find it. Also, her chain had gone around a pole so it could not access the water for a while I suppose. I have more than 8 rescues already and although I think this is a good dog, I am not sure if it would not hurt my current pets. I have had long debates with the owner and her husband (he is locked up due to another situation) and they seem to more interested in the castle doctrine than anyone helping the dogs. Her yard and house looks like something out of hoarders (TV show), not judging but that might give you some point of reference (?)."
rescuedogs,276je1,Happy-feets,1 point,Tue Jun 3 06:12:39 2014 UTC,I'm getting a blank screen.
rescuedogs,274tc5,AgentDL,11,Mon Jun 2 18:54:04 2014 UTC,"This is 100% accurate, and I'd like to add that not everyone who says ""Oh, that rescue is awful; they didn't accept me as an adopter/foster home/etc for ___ stupid reason!"" is telling you the real reason.  I have my first foster dog with a border collie rescue in Texas and one of her first applicants to adopt her stated straight out that while his wife didn't want a dog, he didn't care about her opinion and was going to do what he wanted to do, and that the dog would be a yard dog only and only allowed in the house if the weather was bad.  While I have no doubt that some dogs do great in yards, a 1 year old border collie who needs a lot of attention, training, and work cannot just be thrown out to sit in the yard.  Especially a rescue who doesn't know how to play with toys or entertain herself.  That's how you wind up with a destructive animal that fence-fights, digs up the yard, and attacks anyone who walks out there.    Our rescue does not allow 'yard dog' style keeping, or adopters who have a split-decision household (wife wants dog, husband does not, or vice versa, etc) or who won't actually devote time and energy to the dog.  He was rejected immediately.  And I have no doubt that he'll bitch about it to his buddies because everyone's a nice guy in their own eyes and believes that their home is a better option for any rescue dog.  But the fact is, we who have put in time, effort, money, and love to rescue these dogs will not turn them over to a home that's just 'good enough' or 'better than a shelter'.  The dogs deserve better than that."
rescuedogs,274tc5,beeasaurusrex,3,Mon Jun 2 19:44:48 2014 UTC,"that's just 'good enough' or 'better than a shelter'.    I hear that all the time and it so disheartening. Because no, sometimes it is not better. The rescue I work with asks for there to be a fenced yard or we have to have a lot of assurances that the dog will be walked. No chained in the back yard homes for our dogs."
rescuedogs,274tc5,littlewolfen,1 point,Mon Jun 2 20:56:00 2014 UTC,"not everyone who says ""Oh, that rescue is awful; they didn't accept me as an adopter/foster home/etc for ___ stupid reason!"" is telling you the real reason.   I understand feeling resentment over being denied a dog, but to go and bash a non-profit whose sole purpose is to save lives is just a whole new level of douche."
rescuedogs,274tc5,dog_hair_dinner,3,Wed Jun 11 18:44:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to say this. I'm trying for a dog right now. I must say that sometimes it feels discouraging when you go through so much. Rescues mean well but, man!, sometimes it's SO frustrating!"
rescuedogs,274tc5,wordsoundpower,5,Mon Jun 2 19:54:45 2014 UTC,"The best thing you can do is be genuine.  Rescues know if you're just telling them what they want to hear, and it's always best for you to give too much information versus too little.  If you're passionate about rescuing a dog and willing to put forth as much effort as it takes, they'll work with you.  Just stay positive and keep trying. :)"
rescuedogs,274tc5,beeasaurusrex,1 point,Mon Jun 2 21:12:12 2014 UTC,"Definitely telling the rescues the truth. One reason why I'm foregoing a younger dog is because I work an eight hour day and don't want to (in the worst case scenario) leave my dog alone for that long. The good thing is that I have crossover schedules with the mate, so the dog wouldn't actually be alone for eight hours.   Also, since this would be my first pet, having a vet in line (something they often ask) is something I'd considered but hadn't chosen yet. Feels like a Catch-22 of sorts. I wouldn't just sign up with any old vet before finding out if my pet is comfortable with them.  Thanks for the support! :)"
rescuedogs,274tc5,wordsoundpower,2,Tue Jun 3 03:40:11 2014 UTC,"One thing I'd recommend is finding a local rescue (instead of a breed rescue that might be statewide but inconveniently far away) and just putting on the application that you will use whichever vet the rescue uses.  Almost all rescues have a specific vet they work with for ALL their animals and using the same vet means they can keep tabs on how your dog is doing after the adoption is done and over with.  Generally the rescue has the dog vetted, microchipped, and given all shots/other medical treatment before it goes out for adoption, so that also means that the dog will already be familiar with that vet and won't need to go through the stress of meeting a new person who's gonna stick their fingers in uncomfortable places.      As long as the dog isn't home alone for 8 hours I can't see that being a reason for rejection, but you should let them know if it'll be both you and your SO's responsibility.  You should also inform them that you plan on crate training, as that's the best way to handle a problem with potential scheduling issues.  A healthy adult dog can hold their potty needs for a max of 8 hours, but having a dogsitter in line in case you'll have an issue where nobody shows up within 6  hours at the max would be a lot better and put most rescues' minds at ease.  Like I said before, the best thing you can possibly do is to plan for every potential situation and then tell the rescue about your thoughts.  Showing that kind of forethought and concern means you're likely to be a great pet parent!  :)"

rescuedogs,274tc5,canehdianchick,2,Tue Jun 3 03:41:52 2014 UTC,"Thank you for this post!!  Our hoops protect you just as much as the dogs that we care so much about!  We also have been dealing with a lot of negativity for adoption fees. Our fees cover FULL sets of shots(that's 3 vet visits!), microchipping, alteration, pain killers, flea, and worm treatments. We also temperament test our dogs-- do a lot of extra ordinary vetting like leg surgeries, mange cases and behavioural issues that we spend big $$ rehabbing. I get that 450$ may seem like a lot but to get a dog and then vet it to the same extent in our area for a 50lb dog costs nearly $700! No dog included!  Also we find the process allows some people to think a little more critically. If you're filling out adoption applications and you're asked a question you never considered you may go ""oh.. maybe a husky isn't for me.. they're pretty but I can't do 20 kms of running a day"" and consider taking all parts of adoption into account.  I think our rescue is lucky we are based in an area where many people understand the benefits of the added blockers and they get that it's about making things work for their lifestyle as well as the dogs.   If you can't take the time out of your day to do an application, home visit and meet and greet-- you probably don't have the time for a dog. Just sayin'..."

rescuedogs,26r742,heteroerotic,4,Thu May 29 02:56:10 2014 UTC,"as far as mill rescues go, it sounds like you have a very good dog with minor, normal issues.  it souns like you're doing a great job too.  My first rescue was a mill stud who lived in a dark barn for the first 6 years of his life.  He came out of his shell occasionally, but very rarely and he never really came out completely.  He was pretty traumatized for the rest of his life.  Since then, I'd fostered 4 ex-mill dogs who all came out of their shells within a few weeks, but I credit that to everything I learned from desensitizing my first dog to new sights/sounds/situations."
rescuedogs,26r742,dog_hair_dinner,4,Thu May 29 16:11:05 2014 UTC,"My corgi was a mill dog and was 6.5 when I got her. It took her 6 months before she barked once and then probably at month 7 or 8 she finally broke out and now goes up to everyone and everything. Before that, she had to be touching me or else she would freak out over the littlest things. Our new rescue (literally got her Monday) has already attached herself to my SO and is very open with other people. She is starting to try to play with the corgi, though that won't go far because the corgi is nearly 8 now and doesn't play with any dog, only humans."
rescuedogs,26r742,ITchick,4,Thu May 29 18:36:36 2014 UTC,"I got my pit mix straight from the shelter, she was there for almost 3 months and about to be put down... Not sure what her story was, she's aobut 2 or 3, and acted like she'd never lived indoors before. But she got house trained pretty quick, and was very quiet and sweet. I also had an older male Rottie, and they got along great. She didnt make a single sound for the first 3 months, I didnt even know what her bark sounded like. Then very slowly, her noises starting coming it - she purrs like a cat, she howls  at sirens, barks whenever she can get away with it, and this other noise that sounds like a growl but is actually her way of saying ""play with me"". Its been almost a year since I got her, and she is a completely different dog - running around, barking, playing, stealing things, having fun non stop, making noise! :-p"
rescuedogs,26r742,rottnzonie,3,Sat May 31 03:30:19 2014 UTC,"Our last 2 rescues were vastly different.   One was uneasy for one day, then sleeping under the covers between me and my wife the next.  The other we've had for almost 2 years, and she is my cuddle bug, but still a little uneasy around others, and still panics and hides if she feels the least bit boxed in or restrained by someone.  Keep doing what you're doing, the dog will come around at its own pace."
rescuedogs,26r742,LilJacKill,3,Thu May 29 06:30:21 2014 UTC,"It can take a lot of time, and there may be things that set her off always.   I fostered a GS who'd been with the rescue for 2 years and every time someone came into the house she would hide under the kitchen table. My friend adopted a dog 5 years ago who still bolts if she hears metal on metal, because she was on a chain for 7 years.  It may take several months for her to realise that this is life now. 4 years is a lot of trauma to overcome."
rescuedogs,26r742,imaginesomethinwitty,1 point,Thu May 29 11:30:12 2014 UTC,"My current rescue was never in his shell it seemed. He had lived in kennels for about a year before he was put on death row to make space for another dog, he had no interest from any adopters. We went to the kennels after an ad in the newspaper about a different dog but they bought out our little man by accident, we fell in love with him instantly. He was so excited to be out of his cage and in the sunshine (the kennel in question wasn't a great one and has since been taken over my new management), and he was all smiles. Came straight over to me and my family for cuddles and fuss.   A week later we went back to collect him, before they bought him out we already had the boot open and ready for him. They brought him out and he bee-lined for the car, pulled the lead out the handlers hand, went straight past my family and jumped right in then looked back at us as if to say ""Let's go home!""  He has been nothing but loving and happy ever since.   We were lucky, but rescues we have had in the past have taken months, or even years to fully settle in. I'm sure you're little lady will settle in fine, as silly as it might seem she might be having nightmares or something similar due to trauma. Just love her with everything you got."
rescuedogs,26r92v,beaglemama,2,Thu May 29 03:19:24 2014 UTC,"We need help finding her a suitable home. We're in the Birmingham, Al metro area, and we've started to lose hope. This dog deserves a good home and people to be able to give it love and attention. Does anyone know what we should do, we've covered all friends, family, we've gone to dog parks and do dah day. We've even taken her to a couple of local bar/night life events for pets and everything has fallen through. Any help would be great.   Try getting in touch with a no-kill rescue group.  I know sometimes groups transport dogs to no-kill shelters up north.  Maybe if you offer to help pay her transportation fees a northern rescue group could help her. http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2014/02/animal_rescue.html  But local rescues might be able to help, too."

Those breeds need constant training, or a job they can do all the time, otherwise they become... restless and not in a good way.  You might get some traction with a breed specific rescue for pitbulls or maybe the border collies if there is one in your area."

rescuedogs,26phvj,Bramble_Bee,3,Wed May 28 16:43:35 2014 UTC,"Shelters can be desperate and do take advantage of people sometimes out of desperation. It's very important to set your boundaries and be able to say no.   For example, I will not take puppies. I don't want to get up every two hours with them, I don't want to clean up after them and I especially don't want to deal with their energy. I really admire the lunatics who bottle feed newborns, but it ain't for me! I also say no to JRTs- it's a personal preference, I don't love terriers. We have people who only take greys, who only take pits, who can't take bitches etc. So you need to be clear on what you are willing to do.  That being said, this rescue does not sound like it has the best set up. It's crazy to expect you to drive so far repeatedly, and the rescue should cover costs for medical supplies like electrolytes. Our rescue provides food and will refund all costs incurred if asked. Some people pay for everything themselves as a donation. At times when we've been short of cash I've taken the free food, if we are doing ok I pay myself. If you decide to buy something like a playpen that will not go with the cats, I would expect you to pay for that yourself.   I have really enjoyed fostering, although I am sort of retired now as we adopted our last foster. I love watching the dogs come out of their shell. We had a hound that peed himself every time a man walked in the room, watching him creep up to my partner one night and touch his hand with his nose was amazing. There was a GS who watched my lab playing with a ball for about an hour before suddenly realising that chasing a ball = fun, and then was never seen without a ball in her mouth again. She had never had a toy before. There was a Samoyed Husky that I thought I would have to send back to the shelter as I could not get him to listen to a word I said, and then one day he decided that I was the greatest person he ever met and never left my side again until he was rehomed.   They all had difficulties, but the joy outweighed it for me."
rescuedogs,26phvj,imaginesomethinwitty,1 point,Wed May 28 22:58:03 2014 UTC,"Thank you - I think you are exactly right. I will definitely make sure to find out more about the animals I am taking on and about the group next time I foster.  As for this group, I think you are right - they are pretty disorganized. I have decided I will find another group and volunteer at their shelter and other events before I start fostering."
rescuedogs,26phvj,dog_hair_dinner,2,Thu May 29 01:02:04 2014 UTC,"The first two sentences of /u/imaginesomethinwitty 's post sum up my experience.  I've fostered 21 dogs in three years and toward the end, I had to start saying no.    The important thing to remember is that if you burn out, you will stop fostering all together.  That's what you need to avoid.  In order to avoid burnout, you need to recognize and respect your personal limitations.  Take on challenges you are comfortable with, but remember that you have your own life and responsibilities to yourself, your family, and your friends.    The majority of the fosters I had were nightmares like yours, but it was due to my choice to help out a small rescue with very few volunteers, which resulted in those 45 minute car rides often and lots of emergency cases that we didn't have volunteers to cover.  But I have to tell you that the good experiences made ALL of it worth it.  The love and gratitute you get back from the animal is an irreplaceable feeling."
rescuedogs,26opnf,BuddhasPalm,5,Wed May 28 11:06:54 2014 UTC,"Now the rescue is treating me like I'm some barbaric subhuman, because they think I neglected my dogs heart worm testing/preventative   Are you drawing this conclusion based on their email reply in your OP? If so, you're overreacting. This is something that should be easily cleared up. Have you told them what you just told us?"
rescuedogs,26opnf,AgentDL,3,Wed May 28 11:21:43 2014 UTC,"Perhaps I am over reacting but it feels passive/aggressive(perhaps because I think that kind of neglect is barbaric?)  I did send them the updated info in this reply:  Hello, thank you for responding.   There seems to be a bit of a mix up. Winston has been tested(negative) last June and schedule for his check up this June 2(which he will be tested again, and preventative bought)  ""I was having the hardest time with your website. I kept trying to correct info for a second vet but it wouldn't allow me to re-type the information. It is for that reason that I only listed Winston's most recent vet, under the assumption that Dr. XXXX had all of his records. Prior to last June, I took Winston to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and as it turns out, only his vaccination records were sent, not the rest of his records going back to his puppy days  Sorry for the mix up, I hope you will reconsider.""  I guess my assessment arises from the fact that they've been so helpful and quick to reply until they came under the impression that I neglect my dogs heartworming."
rescuedogs,26opnf,AppleJuiceCookies,3,Wed May 28 11:27:40 2014 UTC,"It's a simple misunderstanding. If they don't take the time to understand this (I'm sure they get lots of replies to denial emails), then that is rather unfortunate.   The thing you need to do, is to get the records they think don't exist, scan them in and email them to the rescue. Right now they only have your word that it was done, that isn't enough; after all they called the vet originally.   I can't see them not approving you after you send them the paperwork (assuming that is the only reason). There is a possibility there are additional reasons, but they just used this one as the main one. I only suggest that because I work with a Rescue, and usually the biggest issue is used as a reason for a denial, even though there were other things that would justify a denial."
rescuedogs,26opnf,AgentDL,3,Wed May 28 14:24:46 2014 UTC,"Respectfully, I do think you're way way way overreacting. From my perspective, they sent you a relatively sterile email saying, ""We can't accept your app because there's no evidence that your dog is on heartworm meds. Heartworm is dangerous."" All you need to do is reply with, ""Oops! He is! I guess my old vet didn't send my new vet all of our records, and I had trouble putting my old vet on your website. I'll get the records for you.""   I think it's safe to say that nobody is treating you like a barbarian or jumping to conclusions. Just relax and rectify the situation without getting all butthurt about it."

I've been in the Doberman community for quite sometime, and due to the breeds once extremely negative stigma, I've noticed there is some elitism involved(understandable). I just feel like sometimes that the same mentality meant to protect the breed, the public and the individual animals is also shooting itself in the foot.  It just gets frustrating because I know I can provide a very good forever home for a dog that is stuck in a foster home with 8 other dogs(I got to talk to the foster mom, very nice lady) where it may not be getting the individualized attention that I could give."
rescuedogs,26opnf,Barbicore,2,Wed May 28 13:31:33 2014 UTC,"Oh, I phoned my old vet immediately as I was mortified, by even the thought that maybe his heartworming was possibly overlooked. They were able to verify he had indeed been tested(negative) and treated. It was then that I replied to the email with an explanation and the relevent info for the prior vet. I'm now starting to wonder based on some of your guys' opinions if my reply will get through, if it was indeed an auto-response kind of email.  Edit: thanks!!"

We adopted Kitty about a year ago. Then we decided a while back that we were ready for a dog and started visiting the shelter regularly. Unfortunately most of the medium-large dogs that we met were not compatible with cats..   Then this little guy, Scruffy as named by staff, showed up as a stray one day. He was on stray hold, but then his owners came forward and said they did not want him back. He wasn't exactly the shepherd/retriever type dog I was looking for, but I had a feeling he wouldn't torment the cat and that was key for me. I also loved how he went from mellow, sluggish dog to wide-eyed puppy-like the second he saw I had a toy, but my fiance' was still convinced that he was more cat than dog. I had always had big dogs, but it just felt right and I filled out an application for him. :) Once he was neutered, he came to live with us.  I originally thought he was one of the ugliest dogs I had ever seen.. but now he's just the cutest thing ever. Funny how that works! We all agree we love him, and he loves us. I was skeptical as to why his owners didn't want him back.. but he hasn't given us any clues. I read Pekingese's have difficulty housebreaking and prepared to clean up a lot of pee, but we joke that his bladder was gifted from the Gods because for a 20lb guy, he has no problems holding it."

rescuedogs,267up1,icd2k3,2,Thu May 22 15:52:53 2014 UTC,"First a few questions. How old is your dog? How much exercise does he get a day? What type of collar do you use when you walk him? What is your level of anxiety when you are out in public with him? Is this your first pit mix? Does your dog show a need to please you? When you walk him do you feel that you have full control of him?  These questions are important. You would be amazed at how much a dog's disposition is colored by the owner. If you are fearful in public (because of his behavior) he may sense this and feel the need to protect you (thus his aggression).   I'm speaking in generalities. My pitbull was about 85lbs and when she was young began to show aggression but she also had a need to please (which I believe most dogs have). If your dog is the same you need to demonstrate that you are the boss and that this behavior is not accepted. So long as your dog is not overly aggressive with you I would suggest putting the dog on it's back with you standing over him, (feet on both sides of chest or shoulders) and with a firm ""NO"" letting him know that you don't accept this behavior. Hold him there until he stops wiggling.   Some might say that this is too aggressive but in my experience it breaks the ""bad"" train of thought and forces his attention back on to you ""the leader"". You want to nurture the relationship where he always looks to you for approval and leadership.  In my experience I have found that most bad behavior with my dogs has been due to them not getting enough exercise. Being a lab/pit mix he probably has a ton of energy. You need to find an activity that depletes him and then try working on his aggression in public. If he's got any retriever in him get a Chuckit and run him for at least an hour. (I used to do an hour twice a day when my dogs were young) Often once the dog is physically tired their bad habits surprisingly disappear. This is when you would want to go out in public to test him, reinforce the good behavior and it will also be easier to correct him.    Just a few ideas. If I'm totally off base let me know I would love to help."
rescuedogs,267up1,myb120,1 point,Thu May 22 20:24:50 2014 UTC,"Hey myb120 - thanks for your response and great questions!   Age: about 2.5yo Exercise: On average a 1.5 - 2mi run with me every other day and some fetch/running around in the backyard everyday + some tricks training (but he would always be happy to get more exercise). Collar: usually a gentle leader (he doesn't usually pull, but it makes him easier to control if he does) My anxiety: pretty high, I avoid people on our runs/walks First pit mix: yep Need to please: yea I believe so, he's very good with commands and generally quick to pick up new training tricks Full control while walking: yes, on leash I can control him (he's about 55lbs and strong, but I can hold him back with little effort)   There's no doubt in my mind he picks up on our anxiety around other people, lately we've been avoiding them altogether and focusing on gradual counterconditioning (which is basically: have a stranger/friend sit on one side of the room, bring the dog in on-leash at the other side. Make sure he sees the stranger and gets lots of treats, then put him back in his crate after 10min or so).  Hopefully we'll never be in another situation where we have to stop him from freaking out (by putting him on his back etc) because we won't allow him to be that far outside of his comfort zone until he's ready. Seems like the idea here is to gradually decrease his comfort zone bubble in a way where he doesn't tense up and walks away with an overall good association with the stranger.  Did your pit eventually stop showing signs of aggression or does it still happen on occasion?"
rescuedogs,267up1,myb120,1 point,Thu May 22 21:28:04 2014 UTC,"For my dog it was a stage. She really was an attention whore and would actively seek out people to play with. When they get to be around 2 or 3 they are like teenagers. My take is...dogs being pack animals, look to see what they can get away with. They live by the creed ""...it better to ask for forgiveness than to ask permission."" A dog will constantly test the leader of the pack to find the moment when they can rise up in the pecking order. Since you and your gf are the pack it's only natural for your dog to be testing what he can get away with.   I wouldn't save the ""on the back"" treatment for special occasions. I would do it to see how he reacts to you. You can get on his level, instead of standing over him. If you can keep him on his back and he becomes calm, reward him with affection. If he's kicking and wriggling he might have an idea that he doesn't have to submit to you. Make this part of your play with him so it's not associated with punishment rather it's you exerting your position.   With the exception of mental problems and illness (the one thing I did forget to ask is that he's in good health. Sometimes aggressive behaviors can be due to an illness or injury, ie. arthritis [he's too young for that]), I believe most behavior problems stem from a breakdown in boundaries. The more you can establish and reinforce them the better your relationship will become.  How is he with other dogs?"
rescuedogs,267up1,myb120,1 point,Thu May 22 22:45:33 2014 UTC,"Cool, yep, that makes sense. He's in great health and he generally loves other dogs (prefers big ones he knows he can play with; he doesn't seem to know quite what to do with smaller ones haha).  As with most ""teenagers"" I do get the feeling he tries to test me sometimes to see what he can get away with. For example, if he finds something in the backyard like a rock or a plant he knows I don't want him to have he'll play keep-away from me, or getting too excited and body-checking during play. In any of these circumstances I think that the ""on the back"" treatment would be appropriate to remind him that I'm in charge.  Thanks again for the input! Going to definitely give that a try and see how he reacts."
rescuedogs,262s55,Rutibegga,9,Wed May 21 00:11:55 2014 UTC,"I pulled him because he had kennel cough and was on their urgent dog list. Also, we brought our dog asking, and their body language was loose and relaxed. He was the first dog I met, and I told the foster coordinator he would be fine: I wasn't picky because it's a short term commitment.  He had a name there, but it wasn't a very good name. As I took him on the first of our many walks so far,I decided to call him Wallace.   He and our dog were cautious at first, but they're starting to play. He's interested in my cats, but not in a creepy way.   He seems to have some degree of hip dysplasia, but he's also muscle wasted and underweight, so it's hard to tell. I was hoping my foster dog would be a running partner, but I don't think Wallace is built for that. We've gone on long walks at least twice every day since he's been here, though.  The thing is, i'm not sure I can foster him. He's been here four days, but the thought of giving him up breaks my heart.   I'm giving it a month before I make any decisions. I already have two potentially interested parties. I'm no newbie at this-I've had foster dogs and hundreds of foster cats and no issues sending them on their ways, but this guy just clicked.  Had anyone else here had a foster just come in and feel perfect like this? I feel like I'm letting other potential foster dogs down, but I'm also not sure I can let this guy leave."
rescuedogs,262s55,wetnoses,7,Wed May 21 00:21:00 2014 UTC,"That's a Dalmatian!  A poorly bred one, his head isn't Dalmatian shaped, though he's very handsome.  I've fostered 40+ dogs over the past few years. Most of them i was thrilled to adopt out but some really do just grab your heartstrings and it's terribly difficult to let them go.  If I was you, I'd continue fostering him,  especially if your rescue is like mine & the foster home gets a say in who he'll be  adopted to. Giving him up will be easier when you know he's going to an awesome home that will adore him!  Fostering is just as hard as it is rewarding.  If you really click with this fellow then it'll be so wonderfully satisfying to send him to a great home.  I still get updates from a lot of my fosters and most of them have owners who are able to devote way more time to them than I'd be able to. Remember that just because you love a dog doesn't mean you're the best possible home for him.   Another thing to keep in mind is : were you wanting to adopt a dog before you met him?  If not, why?  If the time isn't quite right, the world is full of fantastic dogs waiting to be adopted,  And when you're ready,  you'll definitely be able to find one you love just as much as him!  And my biggest question - will you be able to continue fostering if you adopt him?  If not, think of all the dogs you won't be able to save. There are a lot of adopters out there but there aren't very many awesome foster homes such as yourself."
rescuedogs,262s55,mangoman12345,2,Wed May 21 01:36:40 2014 UTC,"I'm trying to keep all this in mind. If we kept Wallace, I'd certainly be less-inclined to foster another dog, but I would continue to foster cats and possibly special-case dogs.  I'm also trying to remember that Wallace is not my ideal dog. If I'd been looking to adopt, I wouldn't have even met him- I'd be looking for smaller (a pittie or herding dog type) and compact and more athletic -- a running partner. Wallace won't be that, I'm afraid, unless his hips get a lot stronger.  Still, he and I clicked, and he slid right into my household like he'd always belonged. It's a tough call. And I'm not making it until mid June."
rescuedogs,262s55,hoppityhoppity,2,Wed May 21 10:15:23 2014 UTC,"I went to the shelter to adopt an adult or senior dog that was dog friendly and cat friendly. I came home with a 9 month old fear reactive Border Collie/German Shepard mix who doesn't like other dogs and is getting used to the cat.  My point is they aren't always your ideal dog in rescue. If you wanted to be able to pick out your ideal dog, then you go to a breeder. And that's no good! If it clicks.. then it clicks! That's the important part.  Your ""ideal"" dog that likes to run may hate cats and put your kitty fostering to an end.  I say give him a chance and if you foster fail.. it's a good thing! The point is to give him a chance and a home:)  Edit: Glucosamine will help those hips. We rescued a lab that could barely walk but the glucosamine really helped her and she was running with the big dogs when she left."
rescuedogs,262s55,Soahtree,2,Wed May 21 12:38:56 2014 UTC,"Fostering can be very difficult emotionally!  That being said, it can also be very rewarding, as you know.  He may not be a running partner now, but working with him on getting back to a healthy weight and muscle tone could change that.  In your shoes, I would continue.  It sounds like he needs someone athletic in his life to help him get back to where he needs to be.    Good luck, regardless of your decision!"
rescuedogs,262s55,headinthered,3,Wed May 21 15:48:26 2014 UTC,"Ps. His intake paperwork said he was originally purchased from a breeder. What on earth is he supposed to be? He looks nothing like his white pitbull foster brother- almost twice as tall, way more angular, floppy ears. Dalmatian? Dogo Argentino? Polar Bear? Those are my best guesses."

rescuedogs,262s55,LadyLynn,4,Thu Jun 5 11:30:23 2014 UTC,"I have two that started as fosters but I couldnt give them up. Both my mastiffs were brutally abused before getting sent to the pound; cigarette burns, a stab mark on the female, starved, and thats just the stuff we could see. We worked so hard on socialization, getting weight on them, and play (neither of mine could or would play). I spent months on the floor with them arms outstretched teaching trust and love. When it came time, I just couldnt bear to have them leave and not get the life I wanted for them. They were the perfect fit for us and I dont regret at all that we asked to keep them."
rescuedogs,262s55,imaginesomethinwitty,3,Wed May 21 06:25:16 2014 UTC,"No worries, this same situation happened to my parents. Their story - I got married, and my husband and I are living in another country, and, with me being an only child, my mom took it pretty hard. So I got her into fostering since she doesn't work, lives on land with a barn and pasture, and has two dogs already. She absolutely loves it and is doing a really fantastic job. She primarily gets young puppies (and the mothers too if they're found together). She's had many litters now and found them all loving families.  She says each pup is an individual, unique in it's own way, and she has kept a special place in her heart for many of them. Letting them go is always hard, she says, because there's always that one pup that you grow extra fond of as you watch it's personality come to life. But she finds it immensely rewarding to see them find happy homes, even though it's especially bittersweet to see the little, extra-special ""heart-stealers"" go.  However, with one particular pup, my parents just knew they couldn't give her up - she was already home. Simple as that. People say ""when you know, you know"", and I think this is one of those situations. Of the countless puppies she's had to let go, this one just wasn't going anywhere. It was hard because, like you, Mom had several families interested in her and ready to adopt. She had to call them and let them know.  Shelby simply fit right in and was especially taken with one of their other dogs, like she'd been there forever. They hadn't experienced that kind of instant connection with any other foster - like Shelby was the dog they never knew they were supposed to have, and, now that she's there, can't imagine their life without three dogs (and a ton of fosters, of course).  Sorry for rambling, but I just have so much pride and admiration for what my mother and other fosters do!"
rescuedogs,262s55,Charley2014,3,Wed May 21 05:22:20 2014 UTC,"Both arguments have valuable merit - 1. It will be rewarding to see him happy and with a wonderful family, freeing you up to continue fostering and 2. If you know, you know, foster failure is nothing to be ashamed of.  We have fostered nearly 100 (93 as of this spring) cats and several dogs and kept 6 cats along the way. It was always wonderful to see another family happy and know that the animals were well taken care of, even if some tore at your heart to let them go. But as stated in GeneralPeach's parents tale - sometimes there's one that was always yours.  We have kept the runts of the litters for the most part as they often required the most blood, sweat and tears to keep going, but there was one who was totally not our 'ideal' cat, but she needed us. It took so long to get over her fear and abuse issues that we simply couldn't imagine uprooting her again. Today, while still shy, she occupies a very special place - she's turned into the biggest lap cat, but still doesn't take to strangers. But the affection she shows us is so sincere that when she ""asked"" to stay it was settled.  You're right in giving it time, but stay open to either outcome. And it is very possible his hips will improve with nutrition and weight. Good Luck!!"

Not being able to foster would be the only thing i don't think I could handle. She was in line to be destroyed this last Friday by the Kansas City Kansas Animal Control. I've had to teach her a lot and I don't know her real name but she understands me. She's probably one of the smartest dogs I have ever fostered. I've only had her for 5 days though.

rescuedogs,25drtf,HHMinnow,2,Mon May 12 19:09:34 2014 UTC,"First - I am so sorry for the loss of your pup.  I came here to say I think what happened to your pup was just a freak accident.   Sounds like you were doing everything right.  The woman who has the rescue I adopted 2 of my babies from made this PSA video  - this happened to her last year.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llnBTFz14Mc  I would trust her with any dog.She has been doing this many years and has adopted out over 400 dogs.All happy healthy, neutered and chipped.  She has strict adoption criteria, and does not bend. She has invested time, and money ( a lot of times, her own) and wants only the best for her pups.  My point is this.  After what happened to her, and making this video, I do not think that she would ever judge your ""parenting"" skills, based on what was an accident, nor should any rescue group.  And they use vet references, so I think if they asked a vet for a recommendation, they would say that indeed you did everything as you should and it was accidental.  I wish you all the best. There are many dogs who need loving homes,do not give up if you get rejected by one, it is the beauty of dog rescues - you can find one who has a dog who needs you and will love you unconditionally."

When she told me she had ""lost"" her last dog, alarm bells went off. However when she described the circumstances - a totally freak incident and an extensive search, with posters, door to door flyering, a large reward - with tears in her eyes, I felt that on balance, as she had a terrible experience that could have happened to many responsible dog owners. I asked for a veterinary reference and it was glowing.  I passed her, and the dog is in heaven with her, completely adored.   Be honest, explain what steps you will take to prevent to same mistake again, offer references, and I, for one, would pass you. Tragic things happen in life. I'm so sorry for your loss."

I will never understand people, he is under 10# and there are more apartments then not that take pets. They were told by the family he had not seen a vet in years and the person that picked him up consoled the gentleman. They only told them they were moving, nothing about the other dogs or that there were issues. There was NEVER bashing, never names used or anything personal.  Btw Amelia when mill dogs are adopted you don't know if they will be ok alone but if they do have a problem which I have seen twice the rescue worked with both families and adopted them another dog. Add:i understand asking for compassion but please on the other hand we ask for a little understanding. It is his right not to share but it is ours to have opinions and yes we do get jaded i will admit that. So sometimes it is better to just be upfront for the dog.

I also did admit that I understand the frustration because that's terrible to have to deal with. But my father was literally sobbing when he dropped off Jackyl. I've seen my dad cry three times in my entire life. Yes you can have opinions and I know it has to be hard to consistently see maltreatment for dogs but that dog was very loved. He didn't see the vet this year yet but I know he did last year. My step mom took him so my dad probably just didn't know that when he was asked and said he hadn't because he hadn't been this year. My point in all of this is you should never shame someone for taking the steps to take care of the dog and give him a better future. It truly was heartbreaking for us. I know many others just don't care and drop their dogs off, but we did care."

I just ask for compassion and to remember there is always more to the story that's all  Edit- adding this: I also do understand the frustration of having to deal with another disappointing situation for jackyl. We are heartbroken and rest assured that the guilt and sadness is more punishment than is deserved for them bringing him back to a rescue that I am sure will find him a loving home and quick because he is a joy!
rescuedogs,25a6wo,AmeliaPondPandorica,-2,Sun May 11 18:51:35 2014 UTC,"[removed] is the rescue organization on Facebook. They posted on their page that they don't understand people who have to move and get rid of their dogs because most places allow pets. And that he is only ten pounds. It may have seemed like an offhand comment but to my parents who are already heartbroken, it's a tremendously judgmental approach to people doing the right thing. My parents already have two older dogs as well and most if not all places have a two dog limit. So it made sense to take the youngest dog to the rescue as he was the one with the most chance to be readopted. It made us all very sad to have to get rid of him but literally all options were exhausted. This was the first of very heartbreaking decisions that they're going to have to make and they did the right thing. They could've done what so many others do and leave him on the streets or take him to the pound but they didn't. They took him back to the organization we once thought would lend help to the helpless and and now are being trashed on Facebook for it. This upsets me to no end because my parents loved that dog. They are also claiming he's had no vet treatment in years which is just a blatant lie.  Edit: rephrasing and removed rescue name"
rescuedogs,25a6wo,Extra_Cheer_Bot,-4,Sun May 11 15:07:16 2014 UTC,"Some rescues get so high and mighty. We've had two bad experiences in our adopting days, the first several years ago, when we adopted a former puppy mill mama beagle. We brought her home and she was so lonely add the only did that she became depressed. She stopped eating, drinking, and through she was perfectly heartbroken when we brought her home, she starting going in the house. She wouldn't come out of my room and be sociable when we wanted to love on her. The rescue had us take her back to their vet for a checkup. I walked in with her to a waiting room with 3 other dogs, she was friendly and energetic. This the rescue lady she needed a home with other dogs, she agreed and said we did the right thing, but that we could never adopt from them again. Second time was worse: different rescue group. We went asking for a lab or golden, a dog really patient with children. I specifically said no huskies, pits, or rots. (Yes, I'll get hate for this, but I have to do what I think safest for my kids.) She brought us a pit mix, and husky/vs mix. I recognized the pit mix, but the husky mix got by me, and he was friendly, so we took him home. After we got him home, he started being more aggressive toward our younger kids, and five days later he bit our daughter with no provocation. We had been told that if we needed to return the dog, we had ten days. We brought him back in seven, thinking we would get out money back. No such luck. We got stiffed our adoption fee. The lady we dealt with lied to us."
rescuedogs,25a6wo,AmeliaPondPandorica,1 point,Sun May 11 15:38:39 2014 UTC,"The first rescue should have accepted the unforeseen situation for what it was, sometimes that happens.  As for the second rescue, no decent rescue should ever try to adopt a breed to someone who doesn't want that breed.  I may disagree with people on their reasons not to like a breed but all the breeds you mentioned require owners that understand, accept and responsibly own the breed for what it is.   I have seen plenty of pits and other mixes that were uncharacteristically mellow in rescue but we still wouldn't put them where they weren't wanted."

Sure, they remember things like we do, their brains process and cataloge memories and develop a familiarity with their surroundings.  But, emotionally, they do not dwell.  They stay in whatever Moment their life is in.  When he was under your car, that's all the life he knew.  The adversaries, Hunger and Pain and Cold.  He did not wish for death like we humans might in that scenario.  He was just waiting, but he did not know for whom.  That could have been the only Moment he would ever live in again.

If they are legit there should be no problem. If its a guy just trying to do the right thing and help out some real rescues then he may get some help from them.   Never heard of rescues on E-bay. But I never thought to look on e-bay either.  What kind of scorpion stings? Its usually antihistamines and steroids that are first administered. Then maybe adrenaline or straight to anti-venom depending on severity."

I am in the process of moving and my dog and him don’t get along very well. He does well with most dogs but needs to meet them first. It breaks my heart seeing him in the kennel. I go there at least once ever week or so and I am starting the process to become a volunteer. If anyone here is looking for a dog or knows of someone and you live in SC please take a look at him. He is playful but will also sit and snuggle for as long as you want. Here is a link to his page on PetHelpers web site.

rescuedogs,241uj6,danger_is_fat,12,Sat Apr 26 20:00:06 2014 UTC,"Always happy to be a great rescue parent!! Haha Thank you!  We pull from communities in the North and West Coast of Canada. These communities have very little knowledge for animal welfare -- with few people and lots of dogs -- so it's been an uphill climb trying to educate.  We had him at the vet yesterday and were told he would have only had about 2 weeks left if he had not been brought in. We all want this guy to be pampered loved and happy and it's going to take a long time!  Long story short: He has a heart murmur, he was incredibly dehydrated-- which could be the cause of the murmur-- worms, mange that has turned into bacterial infections,  as it had been left untreated, several secondary infections and he has urine, blood, stool and nasal samples currently being run in the lab. Fingers crossed that these come back okay!   We can't treat the mange until his infections are treated. Basically he is one very sick dog that had very little time left. Under it all is a very sweet loving boy. I hope that the rest of the tests come back good and no distemper."

rescuedogs,2459dc,FreeThinker76,1 point,Mon Apr 28 01:29:22 2014 UTC,Yeah I didn't post it to bash pits - it's a terrible lesson but small children shouldn't be interacting with a new dog like this. Even a dog that you know very well can injure a child.

rescuedogs,23um82,arubi2008,5,Thu Apr 24 11:13:54 2014 UTC,Looks identical to my old dog now residing with the ex wife. Depending on the size of it it may be a designer breed called a Yoshi. shitzu Yorkie mix.   Ours was 6lbs and depending on how long you let her fur grow or how short you cut it it would severely alter her appearance.   Disclaimer: I do not condone breeding designer dogs. This was rescued by us from somebody who purchased her and then didn't want her anymore.

rescuedogs,23t6g7,dukepeppington,9,Wed Apr 23 23:01:55 2014 UTC,"Sometimes it takes animals a bit to get accustomed to their new environment, and the other animals they will be living with. You should always watch the 2 dogs when they are together and reward them for positive behaviour. If they are getting really worked up and aggressive, it would be a good idea to separate them for a bit. Each dog will need their own space, such as a quiet crate to sleep in when they want privacy from each other. The new dog will benefit from some training so that she can get used to her new owner and will obey your commands. I'm sure with some time, some love, some training and reward, she will settle into her new home just fine :)"
rescuedogs,23t6g7,Lioness90,1 point,Wed Apr 23 23:17:15 2014 UTC,Thank you! :) Will start looking into training classes.
rescuedogs,23t6g7,3houndsmom,6,Wed Apr 23 23:19:50 2014 UTC,"A couple of things. 1st - Pom needs to be first. First to get his food, first to go out the door.  It will help with his jealousy.  As for the new pup,  she will be more comfortable when she gets used to surroundings, people, dogs and schedule.  Even though she is an older adult, there is a whole new set of things to learn.  My suggestion to start is to get some high-value treats -like tiny pieces of cheese - that they like and sit in the middle of the floor. Invite them over for some treats and attention. She may be more difficult to entice.  If so, toss a piece in her direction.  If she takes it, toss another, closer to you, etc. etc. until she comes to join in.Talk gently to both and share your attention with both.  Give it time, she will adjust. Just do not leave them together alone when you are not there, until you are sure there will not be any fur flying if someone gets too close. I'd use a baby gate to separate them.  If all else fails, get a trainer to come in and help out.  I did that - got good suggestions.  Sounds as if neither of them are to well socialized and are not sure how to react to each other.  I don't mean that in a bad way, my guy was fine with his brother and sister, but not well socialized with other dogs.  Good luck, and remember to give them time.In the meantime, as my trainer told me, manage it for both their safety and well being.  Good luck!"
rescuedogs,23sby6,DecadentDuke,3,Wed Apr 23 18:13:58 2014 UTC,"It sounds like she has bonded with your girlfriend, but is still nervous when she is away, is that it? Honestly it will just take time. A month is t very long for a young dog to get used to a completely new environment.  My advice is short frequent interactions where she gets a pleasant reward. Get her out of her bed and give her some chicken, then let her go back in. Do the same thing every hour. Do the same taking her outside.  Don't force a long scary walk or interaction on her before she's ready, just quick interactions where she gets a treat. If you're patient she will learn that going outside and hanging with people who aren't your girlfriend isn't something to fear."
rescuedogs,23sby6,Oolonger,2,Wed Apr 23 21:58:32 2014 UTC,"Two days to get used to petting? It took two weeks for my shy dogs to come up and sniff me with my back to them. She's shy and scared. Sometimes you have to force shy dogs into new situations, but only a bit. And Very Very gently. At first I had to carry our big dog out the front door for walks, after the first couple of times he started going out the front door on his own. He used to shy away from his harness, now he's still because he knows it means fun time. It will take time and work and time and more work but she'll get there. I let my dog be my guide, and take my cues from him. Find a treat that she loves that only you get to give to her. Your girlfriend can give her biscuits, you give the dog biscuits and peanut butter! Your popularity will skyrocket. Just hang in there. It's worth it when the little accomplishments start piling up, then you've got a great dog. Good luck!"
rescuedogs,23sby6,Soahtree,1 point,Thu Apr 24 05:05:29 2014 UTC,"You could reinforce her for doing what you want her to. Reinforce her with treats for walks, going to the bathroom outside, sniffing you, letting you pet her, coming up to you. You in this case means you, your girlfriend, or anyone else who is a regular in her life.  You'll want to start walking her in the mornings and evenings for now to get her used to being outside with fewer scary things. When she handles that well, try switching it up and go for one walk during the day, and then a few in morning/evening times. If it goes well to go during the day, try it again after a few days.  As far as her sleeping pattern, it might just be the time of day that you're around lines up with when she wants to be napping? If you think that's not the case, make time with you very reinforcing for her. Start small, too :) Initially, if she so much as looks at you, give her a treat! Once you get her more comfortable being near you, work on touching her. Hold out your hand, and if she sniffs it, give her a treat. Touch her chest for a second, give her a treat. Touch her head, her back, etc in the same fashion and treat for responses like staying still or smelling you. After a few successful trials, give treats ever other one, and then every third if success continues, eventually phasing out treats for suffering the torture of being petted, and just your attention should become reinforcing for her.  Kikopup is an amazing resource for short training videos on literally anything you could need to teach your new buddy. I would highly suggest looking around there for ideas to help her socialize better."

After giving her a week to recover from the spay surgery, she has been coming out of her shell more.  She has a bit of an issue with men with deep voices, but overall she is pretty quiet and sweet.  She only chews on her toys.  She has quickly gotten the point that she isn't allowed on the bed.  Everything else can be worked out with training; I've scheduled her for some training classes starting next Friday.  Considering how fast she picks things up, I think those will go just fine.  As for what type of dog she is, we definitely know she is a dachshund mix of some sort.  Not sure what else she is.  The shelter said dachshund/GSD mix, but we aren't so sure.  Some of her behavior makes us suspect a greyhound of some sort (she is generally quiet, likes to sleep as you can see from the number of ""sleeping"" pictures in this gallery, and she loves to run despite her short little legs), but again, we aren't sure.  The shelter also said she was 2 years old, which seems about right, I think...  EDIT: We also know that she was picked up as a stray about a month ago, about two weeks before we adopted her.  She was picked up with her litter of six puppies as well as a male lab we've been calling her baby daddy, though we can't know for certain."
rescuedogs,23dfmn,Busty_Beaver,1 point,Fri Apr 18 18:05:15 2014 UTC,"She sounds like she will be a great fur-ever friend! I immediately noticed she was a doxie mix, possibly with plot hound or something? She is gorgeous."
rescuedogs,23dfmn,3houndsmom,2,Fri Apr 18 21:04:31 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I had never even heard of Plott hounds, but looking at photos, yeah, I can definitely see it.  And from a description of the breed, she does share a lot of personality traits.  She does act like a scent hound on walks, but I thought that just came from her dachshund heritage."
rescuedogs,23dfmn,urkiddingrite,2,Fri Apr 18 23:29:09 2014 UTC,"Yep - came here to suggest Plott hound mixed with the doxie.  That said - as a hound lover and parent I have only one piece of advice.  NEVER trust her off leash outside of an enclosure (fenced yard).  I don't care how well she is trained, if she catches a scent - you could morph into a side of beef and call her name  - she WILL ignore you for the hunt. It's instinct.  Especially if she started out her life being trained for hunting.  So many hounds are dumped b/c they are ""failed"" hunters :-(.  But you will never find a more lovable snuggle bug of a dog.  As for mes with deep voices.  Always carry a pocket full of special treats.  Meet a man with a deep voice - give a treat.  Associate what she is frightened of with something really good.  Even better if you can give the man the treat to give to her... All the best - she's a cutie...."
rescuedogs,239nsf,ZAOrnithologist,4,Thu Apr 17 13:48:18 2014 UTC,Looks like bc & husky to me but I'm not familiar with the dogs in South Africa. Both are cuties!
rescuedogs,239nsf,babyeatingdingoes,2,Thu Apr 17 15:14:55 2014 UTC,"People have said she could be some sort of mix between any of the following border collie, husky, spitz, or kelpie. She loves to hunt and how but definitely runs like a BC and reminds us a lot of Roxy, our pure BC on the left. Would love to do a DNA test but have never seen them in South Africa."
rescuedogs,239nsf,eb1106,1 point,Thu Apr 17 13:51:24 2014 UTC,looks like she could definitely have some Kelpy in her. Maybe a Kelpy/BC cross?
rescuedogs,239nsf,beebop8929,1 point,Thu Apr 17 21:43:39 2014 UTC,"There are DNA tests you can order on Amazon. My boyfriend and I just did this for a dog we rescued because we had no idea what he was. The shelter told us he is a Border Collie/Corgi mix, but it turns out he is actually a Miniature Bull Terrier/Labrador mix. Of course the DNA test may not be 100% accurate, but it might be able to give you some idea. The one we bought cost around $70 or $80."
rescuedogs,239nsf,Tiffhoney,4,Thu Apr 17 23:15:52 2014 UTC,"My boyfriend and I recently got the results of our dog's DNA test. It was so worth the $70! We knew he was part Boston Terrier but NEVER would have guessed the rest. Apparently one parent was boston and standard poodle, the other parent was a mix of 5+ breeds, including pharaoh hound, flat coated retriever, Sealyham terrier, staffordshire bull terrier, and Neapolitan mastiff. Crazy! Here's our little ""bossipoo"" http://i.imgur.com/uXJun1A.jpg"

rescuedogs,234kxo,TheRoadHome,2,Tue Apr 15 21:20:51 2014 UTC,"I love sharing food with my dogs too! Just be careful with jelly. (Not sure what kind you used.) Dogs can't have grapes or raisins, they are poisonous to them. So grape jelly is off the list. Just wanted to make sure you knew because I just learned this very recently. Thanks so much for changing this dogs life! It's an amazing thing you did!"

rescuedogs,2344eo,liquidbrains,1 point,Tue Apr 15 18:41:29 2014 UTC,Up vote for Staffie. I'm just waiting for my rescue collie to settle in and then I'm going to try to find a Staffie that'll live with it.  Hopefully she won't terrorise him.
rescuedogs,2344eo,duckydoom,1 point,Wed Apr 16 06:49:32 2014 UTC,"Our pup is 5 mo old (ish)... and she will try to get our elder Dane to play, and sometimes the Dane is into it and sometimes not. So we just have to keep her well exercised and I never take my eyes off her. Once or twice the Dane has corrected the pup... biting her but not breaking the skin, just a warning. The puppy ran away yelping and mostly learned her lesson. I was afraid that we were in over our head with a pitty puppy but ... once I found the ""High Value Treat"" (Tillamook Cheddar), suddenly she is an A student in class (we got her enrolled in doggie lessons) and I have little trouble with her.   The only thing I can say about her is it takes her forever to wake up. I get her out of her crate in the morning and she will sleepwalk to the door and has actually peed in front of the door then laid down in it, back to sleep. I have to make sure she is fully awake lol"
