Sing along with his solos to get an idea of his language, pacing, and the overall picture of the solo. There's also a great interview with Branford Marsalis where he had a conversation with Wayne after a gig about his playing approach and Wayne played him rhythm changes as Lester Young,Charlie Parker, and finally as he  would play them. Where he was getting at was that he sounded the way he did by listening to the greats before him. So in addition to studying Shorter, you might want to look into Parker, Young, Webster, etc. to see where Wayne might have gotten some of his ideas from."

Jazz,3e0rsk,leannpurpp,9,Tue Jul 21 01:58:56 2015 UTC,"“lingers on chords, churns slowly, something that ultimately sounds really melancholy.”  FIRST, SOME EERIE SONGS  I think this is your prime candidate right here:   Miles Davis - Guinnevere (he was covering Simon & Garfunkel here, surprisingly).  It’s imperative you let this churn, don’t skip ahead to when the horns come in.  That one right there lingers.  It lingers so hard.   And some other tunes from the same album sessions that I find somewhat listenable, with a little bit of calmingness and/or some spookiness:   Orange Lady Recollections Sanctuary Other stuff on Bitches Brew (1969) is spookier and crazier, which I normally don’t recommend to any normal human being because I don’t like it much myself, but you might like the sound.   Or from Miles Davis’s Live-Evil:  look at Little Church and Nem Um Talvez  THE NON-EERIE:  These ones aren't eerie, but are definitely darker calmer more nocturnal textures. These are more structured and straight music that nevertheless has a melancholy or calm flavor, but no spaceyness.   Sanctuary from the second quintet (not to be confused with version above) Footprints by the second quintet Autumn Leaves done by Miles and Cannonball Miles Davis - Nature Boy Summertime by Miles Davis and Gil Evans Round Midnight by Wes Montgomery Herbie Joni Stevie - Summertime Nardis by Bill Evans on Explorations Coltrane - Equinox Day Dream on that Billy Strayhorn album with the choir Charles Mingus - Invisible Lady Charles Mingus - Theme for Lester Young Duke Ellington - Morning Mood (this is a Grieg cover) Duke Ellington with Mingus and Max Roach - Fleurette Africaine Grant Green - Idle Moments   And maybe you should check out the entire albums:   Viva La Woman!.  The horns in the tune you linked remind me of some of the horn sample/arrangement stuff done on this album. Blues-Ette by Curtis Fuller.  One of the song titles references “after dark” which definitely captures the tone throughout every song.  This album, and a lot of stuff by Curtis Fuller, is some of the most consistently listenable and accessible and flavorful stuff in ""jazz"", more people should talk about him."

Jazz,3e0rsk,lost_in_stars,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"I think you might be interested in some of the stuff by pianist Paul Bley. He has recorded a lot of different kinds of things, but he is one of my go-to jazz peeps for melancholy slow-burn stuff. Sometimes he is more of a sideman in these configurations, sometimes it is equal billing, sometimes he is listed as leader. Most of the time there is no drummer. For instance:  Bley/Parker/Phillips, Time Will Tell: One interesting thing about this is that the reed player, Evan Parker, is mostly known as a scorched-earth kind of free player, but he is definitely introspective on this record.  Bley/Koglmann/Peacock, Annette: Covers of songs by Annette Peacock, who was (iirc) married to both Bley and the bassist Gary Peacock at different times.  Jimmy Giuffre 3 (the Giuffre/Bley/Swallow band), Thesis: Mixed tempo and feel, but in many ways it is the original template for the other Bley configurations."

To me, the whole reason to transcribe, memorize and learn someone's solo is to make your playing sound like them by understanding what they're doing. I've heard many non-saxophonists who I can hear Bird in their playing - through many other aspects besides the language. It's a great start, but there's a lot more that can be done."

I'm 19 and going into second year and I'm surrounded by players, guitar and otherwise, who objectively are better than she is.

It comes across as a label use to cater to an audience of armchair social activists, who use their status as a social badge of honor, rather than their activism coming from a genuine need for it.  Mingus, Roach, or Bob Dylan, etc. (some of which the band claim to be inspired by) were all engaged artists, injecting strong social commentary into their art, as well as getting involved ""in real life"", but never needed to broadcast it as a ""brand"" so to speak. It just.. was that way.   we hope to bring jazz back into the socially provocative music of our era.   The way the project is worded also comes across as rather naive and immature tbh. Music isn't socially relevant because you decided it is. It's a combination of things and an ""organic"" process. Socially relevant art has always come from subculture movements / aesthetics sprouting simultaneously in different areas and communities, that happened to hit all the right spots at the right period in time.   There's nothing provocative about the Kickstarter process, there's nothing really provocative about the themes they're touching on either.

Jazz,3dutwt,Honeybair7400,6,Sun Jul 19 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"Mingus was a genius. No possible way to deny it. But good avant garde is how music evolves. Bach was avant garde and so was Mingus. I subscribe to the avant garde. A lot of people will disagree with me, but I hate the concept of ""wrong"" notes. Music isn't about what sounds nice. We've done years of what sounds nice and we know it. We're used to it. Music is about the conviction and emotion played behind those notes, right or ""wrong"" as they may be. I hope one day music will push past what we like to hear and start hearing what musicians are saying. A lot of musicians just want to say what people like to hear though... I'm not saying Mingus is wrong at all. I totally believe in learning how to play along the lines that have been drawn for us, but more than that I think we should push beyond and draw new lines."
Jazz,3dutwt,j_win,11,Mon Jul 20 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong on this, but the point I took from Mingus' speech was you need to know how to play what's current before you can legitimately play something new. If you can't play a line on a CMaj7 properly, don't come at me with some Db bullshit because you think it's progressive. Mingus, in my opinion, is absolutely talking about pushing music forward. Just not doing it ignorantly."

I urge you to listen to Penderecki's Three Pieces in Old Style and Polymorphia back-to-back. To use a jazz example, Ornette Coleman didn't start out with free jazz. And even if I'm not a big fan or Ornette, I realize that he was just following his own muse, and as a musician and composer, I can get behind that.  I love Mingus, but I don't always love his ideas about what music should be. In the same way that I love Wynton Marsalis as a player, but dislike him as a philosopher. Basically, I'm immediately suspicious of anyone who thinks that music should be one singular thing, or that there's a wrong way to make music."

Or, more accurately, Jazz musicians with 'chops' and a grounding in music theory think everybody else should have them. Advanced technical knowledge is a useful avenue to musical development, but hardly the only one.    Esp-disk, back in the early days of Free Jazz, specialized in outsider types that emphasized sound and emotion over an ability to run the changes - and that stuff still sounds great. From another genre - could Capt. Beefheart writes for a symphony orchestra? Could the Magic Band do ELP covers? Thank God, no. Picasso could draw like Raphael, but spent years trying to forget. Jackson Pollock made some of the most powerful images of the 20th Century, and couldn't draw worth a fuck. World Music of vast variety has managed without Western theoretical sophistication."

Jazz,3dwnp3,JeanJeanCreemers,10,Mon Jul 20 03:48:41 2015 UTC,"It's pointless to speculate what Trane would have done, but just think that Sonny Rollins is still kicking and, until very recently, Ornette was too. Pharaoh Sanders is still playing. None of them still play what they did 50 years ago, and you could bet Trane wouldn't be either.   But your chronology is off. Trane joined Miles' band. Miles who played with Bird. Miles who revitalized Bebop and ushered in Cool Jazz before Trane was really on the scene. And Miles who, with Trane, unraveled all that with Modal Jazz. Yes, Trane was forward thinking, innovative, original, and an absolute master. He was a perfect foil for Miles, musically, professionally, and stylistically. But Trane burned like a comet and his career was cut short. His influence on spirituality in jazz cannot be overstated, nor his influence on free jazz, or on the saxophone itself. But Miles went on to redefine jazz itself several times over after Trane left. The Second Great Quintet: what is it? Free jazz? It's something else. And fusion. Miles again.   And regarding your reference to Miles covering Michael Jackson and Cyndi Lauper, sometimes I like to think Miles came out of retirement just to say FUCK IT and invented Smooth Jazz."
Jazz,3dwnp3,porter_esq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:25 2015 UTC,"eeeh, but Miles didn't invent smooth jazz, it was already happening.  I think if you go back and look at the reaction to his 80's reemergence, there were some critics who were baffled that he went smooth.  From the electric/free/funk/rock period to impressionist painting to smooth?  Perhaps it was to pay for his coke habit.    Trane's venture into free jazz easily pre-dated the Mile's second quintet version of free-improv. And if you think about that period, Wayne Shorter had more to do with the creative direction of that band than Miles.  He did most of the writing.  Miles was hanging on for dear life with the young ones.  Even cut a record without taking a solo himself.  think about that!  The Electric period was probably his most radical statement, but it isn't like the elements that made Bitches Brew came outta nowhere.  Jazz was definitely moving in that direction.  The Rhodes, synths, latin percussion, rock and funk rhythms... all that was becoming common place as jazz looked to stay relevant in the late 60's rock era. Sun Ra, for example was already there, he just didn't make accessible music.   But Miles was ready."
Jazz,3dwnp3,zegogo,3,Mon Jul 20 05:54:48 2015 UTC,"A quick comparison of Wayne Shorter's version of Footprints to the second quintet's version with Miles shows me very persuasively that Miles was a driving force.  It's clear and it's explicitly on-record that Miles was revitalized artistically by Wayne Shorter, yes.  But it seems like a vast oversimplification to say that Wayne Shorter ""had more to do with the creative direction of that band"".  I don't judge creative direction by what was written on paper or by who, but by sound and texture, even moreso.  And Miles soloing there also clearly shows that he wasn't hanging on for dear life.  He was only about 40 and Shorter was only a few years younger.  Can you be more specific about timeframe and albums?  I'm less familiar with what was happening once they went electric.  Anyway, something like Coltrane's Ascension in 1965 certainly seems different than what Miles was doing, and possibly preceded Miles doing the same thing later on.  But I don't think it's clear that (1) one venture into ""free jazz"" really pre-dated the other, because where do we draw the lines of freeness and jazziness.  And (2) even if that's true, is it even artistically significant or is it just a function of Music Journalism™ and the Christopher Columbus Syndrome of planting a big landmark flag for the ""first"" person to ""do"" ""a thing."""
Jazz,3dwnp3,CoconutDust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:01:18 2015 UTC,"The differences between the two Footprints have more to do with  Joe Chambers/Reggie Workman vs. Tony/Ron.  One is a quick studio rhythm section the other had been working together for quite sometime. Tony and Ron were an incredibly flexible tandem, not to mention Herbie.   I don't think it shows us anything about Miles himself.  Did he suggest some element?  Perhaps, but we don't know that.    I am purposely overstating the Wayne Shorter ""direction of the band"" thing a bit, as I find Miles to be the subject of more ""overstatements"" than any figure in jazz.  I've seen people claim he ""invented free jazz"" and here it's he ""invented smooth jazz"".  I think we can both agree that those are wrong.  What Miles did better than anyone is surround himself with incredible talent and have the balls to try new ideas.  He didn't invent cool jazz.  Gil Evans has as much to do with that as anyone.  But Miles had the balls put it on wax while Bird was still going over rhythm changes and the blues.  He didn't invent Modal jazz... etc.  In a way he was a fantastic opportunist, but to say that would diminish his playing and artistic vision as a whole, so I won't because I love Mile's music! But I do feel you also have to give some credit to the other artists who helped blaze those same trails separately instead of writing history as if it's a one man show.  I base the Wane statement off of a vague memory of Herbie telling the story of Miles coming up to him after a set with the second quintet and asking why the rhythm section didn't play behind him the same way they did Wayne.  That's pretty telling.  That whole band was really stretching out, but I don't think there was much discussion by any one member as to how they would stretch. They just played.  That's how Miles directed all of his bands.  Pretty much all of his sidemen has said the same thing ""just play, you know your horn"" or whatever.   Wayne did write the bulk of the material so you have to give a nod to that.   I agree with your final paragraph.  Are we talking free of form?  free of harmony?  free of rhythm?  And does it mater?  The OP's chronology is off a bit, but in regards to going ""out""  Trane was definitely a step ahead of Miles. Does it matter? no. I will say that I have a hard time imagining Trane play Cyndi Lauper tunes... that's just crazy talk!"
Jazz,3dwnp3,zegogo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:39:11 2015 UTC,"Good point about the quick rhythm section hire on the (""bad"") Footprints.  But it raises the question of whether Wayne Shorter approved of that sound, or maybe even loved it, or couldn't have changed their playing even if he tried.  My reading (or ""listening"") is that Tony Williams was a big part of the second footprints and quintet, true.  Plus, Ron Carter blasts through the changes in rhythm awesomely, and he is supremely perfect with Tony Williams.  Yet I listened to one of his solo albums (""My Hands"" or ""Just Me"" or something) years ago and it really didn't have the same movement or feeling.  That's just one example, and it's an odd ""solo"" outing, so maybe it's just irrelevant, but still.  Herbie played on both albums so I'm taking him out of the equation.  So to my eyes, it seems like Miles was a crucial orchestrator of that storm.  Perhaps it is just that Miles hired Tony Williams and Ron Carter, while Wayne Shorter didn't.  But even this mere choice of sidemen is greatly to his credit, and I'd have to chalk it up to directorship or auteurism or whatever you want to call it.   But beyond that, when Miles comes in with his soloing, it's every bit the match for Shorter, it's like a perfect union of art.  I think Miles is at the very least very actively taking it all to a certain place, not just going along for the ride.  Another important source of information is Herbie's and Wayne Shorter's work after leaving Miles.  It's great, but I think there is a change or a difference that is fundamental enough that I feel I can attribute it to Miles.  But then again, I don't like Miles stuff through the 70's and 80's either....)    So when I put all this together:  I hear that incredible sound, it clearly owes to the collaboration and to Wayne Shorter's writing, but it's the delivery and the overall feel, and that kind of airiness, which really seems like the Miles factor.  Especially compared to what the sidemen did later.  It's possible that it's really Tony Williams and Ron Carter who just bumped it up from the start without actual input from Miles, but I personally doubt this, or at least it's not clear-cut at all.  And although Miles's own earlier stuff (first quintet for example) didn't have that rhythmic magic of Tony, Wayne, Herbie, etc, suggesting that it was really them and not him, it's also true that the mid 60's.  I do understand the intention here, to get away from Overstatement Journalism.   At this point I genuinely think that many people who talk about the topic of ""jazz"" are not so much hearing the music as hearing the journalism and the cultural ""conventional wisdoms"".  Ambiently, we are often more exposed to claims about music than we are exposed to music itself.  Your paragraph about the anecdote with Herbie, and about Miles leadership style, does seem to weigh very strongly on these issues.  I'd like to read more about it.  Also I guess I""m going to have to examine some of the Miles albums that for some reason or another I have avoided over the years, and look at the personnel listings while doing a close reading."
Jazz,3dwnp3,CoconutDust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:18 2015 UTC,"Curious why you think the Adam's Apple ""Footprints"" is bad. It's a different groove and feel, but the playing on it is great. I love the double time on Herbie's solo and Reggie's spot is nice. It's a great piece in itself, just different. I will admit that the version with Miles sounds like it has Mile's moody stamp all over it, and it is a bit more polished.   As a whole, I think Miles was the engine, brain and inspiration of that band, but I do think it was more of a collective than any of the 50's stuff with Trane.  And I think as time went on, Wayne was really starting to find his voice, as was Herbie.  Of course, Miles was more than ""along for the ride"". I was exaggerating the point.  Miles sounds fantastic during that era.   I don't know if you can compare the 50's Philly Joe Jones/ PC combo with Tony/Ron.  That was a very formidable tandem as well, two of the best in the biz for that era, and very creative in their own right. PC's playing on ""Round Midnight"" blows my mind with how funky it is.   Miles always had top notch rhythm sections.  And I think he gave them room to grow as well.  He knew when to stay out of the way, and when to get after them, like in that photo with Red Garland where Miles is angrily wrapped around him trying to show what he's hearing on the keyboard and Red looks like he's about to explode.  Good stuff.    I looooove Herbie's post Miles stuff.  Mwandishi is incredible, it doesn't have Mile's accessibility or immediacy but that stuff is really underrated.  Definitely Sun Ra inspired.  (I believe Wynton claimed the electric Miles bands were Ra inspired once, which is a weird quote...) I think Herbie stays relevant all the way up till the present.  The Headhunters, Future Shock, the whole nine.  At that point, it just becomes subjective. I will take Miles over Weather Report any day of the week though.  In contrast, I'll take Herbie's 80's stuff with Laswell over Miles in the ""smooth jazz"" era.    I do understand the intention here, to get away from Overstatement Journalism. At this point I genuinely think that many people who talk about the topic of ""jazz"" are not so much hearing the music as hearing the journalism and the cultural ""conventional wisdoms"". Ambiently, we are often more exposed to claims about music than we are exposed to music itself.   Absolutely.   Jazz is such a deep, complex form.  And unlike classical music or classic rock (studio crafted) these recordings become snapshots in time, and we're compelled to know what drove these people to make such incredible art in that moment. All of it gets murked up by the cult of personality aspect of history that it's kinda hard to really know what to believe.  Slopfests like Ken Burn's version of history don't help.  So if we're diggin this stuff enough to spend time on it, we gotta dig deep to really understand what these people were experiencing to create this art.  It's part of the fun of it."
Jazz,3dwnp3,zegogo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"Damn you guys, the smooth jazz bit was a joke! And forgive me if it seemed I was puffing up Miles more than necessary, I didn't claim he invented anything, but certainly his career was based on pushing the art form forward. And he did that by working with some of the greatest artists jazz has known. And he did that with Columbia Records behind him. He didn't do it alone, or in a vacuum, but his particular work still resonates, and I think it leads young players down the path of discovering his sidemen and their work and the fine lineage of jazz, and hopefully adding to it themselves."
Jazz,3dwnp3,porter_esq,2,Tue Jul 21 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"Jazz musicians always played pop standards of the day. Coltrane played ""My Favorite Things"" and numerous other standards by Rodgers & Hammerstein & Gershwin etc. Miles showed what beautiful songs Human Nature & Time After Time were. One thing Miles never did was go backward to older styles, he always advanced.  It's interesting to see where his bandmates went after his death. Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders went on to make some incredible records for the five years after his death, then they began to mellow. Pharoah's style eventually mellowed and did not resemble his playing with Coltrane at all. Alice went on to play devotional Hindu songs before eventually coming back to jazz.  Eventually, it's likely that Coltrane's music would not be bringing in the money and audience that he was accustomed to. Would he have changed to fit the times? Who knows."

Or the story of when Miles Davis got attacked by a cop just for being a well dressed black man with a nice car,  the cop assumed he stole everything.  Fuck being black in America, you can't even be educated and successful,  if you are black, you are gonna get the police, and ignorant racists' attentions."
Jazz,3dpqjo,Mozartist,2,Sat Jul 18 19:25:05 2015 UTC,Fuck being black in America   Not really. It is hard to think of a better experience to be enlightened in a culture of darkness. Then the human spirit battles in social relams to overcome oppression. To excel in arts - and to finally have a black man in the white house. This is a story of a triumph of a race of people that were stripped of everything. This is still a ways to go - and this is everywhere in every country - but there is nothing better than being a black American as far as I can tell. But I know what you mean that it is hard to face oppression - but it is also a great triumph to overcome.
Jazz,3dpqjo,CoconutDust,3,Sun Jul 19 00:43:19 2015 UTC,"nothing better than being a black American as far as I can tell   All of the research data on discrimination, socioeconomics, health, police behavior, movie and television deals, shows that there's definitely something ""better than being a black american.""   It's being a white american.    The president's election doesn't mean the problems have gone away.  It's been entrenched in the society for hundreds of years.  Hence why in the year 2015 a white terrorist went on a rampage and murdered 9 people, and why the confederate flags are still flying, a flag created for the expressed purpose of symbolizing white supremacy over black people.  Not to mention the vastly statistically different likelihood of facing police violence if you are unarmed, depending on whether you are white or black, which has been especially prominent recently in the news and on social media.  All of the above topics are easy to research using the web.  And secondly, although struggle creates triumph and has been connected to brilliant art, the idea that it is a ""great [struggle] to overcome""?  The word ""great"" here seems blithely dismissive of hundreds of years of brutal enslavement, apartheid, murder, and poverty.  And it signifies monumental privilege, to be able to enjoy the artistic products that have come out of this history, while calling the struggle ""great""."

Jazz,3dpqjo,xooxanthellae,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:53:41 2015 UTC,"He was evicted because they found a hypodermic needle in his possession. However the location he was in, he was developing a small local music school, to specifically help kids stay away from drugs and teach them music... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujllLRulFo  If you see the video, Charles Mingus even mentions that their actions are illegal, and he has no attorney present.  Also, I don't get how being beaten for standing in front of a white girl is any worse (not saying you are implying that)  but it still seems ridiculous for Miles to be beaten like that.    Edit:  actually Charles mingus was being evicted, then they arrested him for a hypodermic needle. Sorry for the mis info."
Jazz,3dpqjo,Mozartist,2,Sat Jul 18 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"I believe the eviction was a rent issue, but I also think that Mingus was holding rent because the landlord wouldn't let him start the music school.  Something like that.  I don't think there is enough solid details for me to make a judgment on the legality of Mingus' eviction.  I will be hard pressed to side with any slumlord though.  There's a scene in the documentary where the landlord shows up asking the camera crew to leave.  I could see where Mingus and that chump might have their differences.  The arrest was technically the needle, but Mingus explains that it was for insulin or some other prescribed use, and the fact he was released the next day suggests the needle was actually not used for narcotics.  I would guess that the routine of the arrest was the same function as what happens to Ella and the crew in Texas as mentioned above."

It would be another tragedy of drug war bullshit (even though the drug war didn't exist)  Since I can't really tell why he was being evicted, I can only see a black musician being taken advantage of by the police, as was the case for many black people... simply for being black.

Mingus is by far my favorite bassist, but the dude had a major screw loose.  I'm simply not surprised that he would be evicted somewhere.  Not because he was black, but because he was nuts.

My statements  ""Since I can't really tell why he was being evicted, I can only see a black musician being taken advantage of by the police, as was the case for many black people... simply for being black.""  I've seen many of my friends go to jail for being black, I've read so many injustices black people deal with overpowered police departments (like in LA, Detroit, NYPD)    And the injustices were much worse the more  you go back into history.   I'm willing to change my thoughts, I'm not so thick I wont listen to reason or the truth,   but you haven't provided any information. Just an accusation of racism, based on a, what I would say isn't even that conflicting of a statement.  It's not like I was ""Fuck these white ass cops always keeping the black man a slave!""  nope,  just said ""there's no evidence to what happened, and all the years of American history came to that conclusion for me"" i don't want to think that way but that's what I know about how America treats black people, poor people, etc.    And it also comes from the passion and hatred of seeing a music school being closed down.  I personally just don't see anything bad about what he was doing that it needs to be closed down.  He was a violent, angry man, But I would still love to meet him,  I've been around a lot of crazy people, the things he did still don't top the shit people can do.  And he got evicted a little later in his life, I'd like to think he was doing his best to stay sane and get better.  Him having a music school might have really kept him healthy and creative- It's hard to imagine a 40 year old giant musician teacher fighting with little children, but if that did happen, then by all means evict him."

Very good dudes all around.  The big thing that separates the Houston cats from them IMO is their willingness to do straight-ahead stuff. The Snarky cats did a lot of work in Gospel churches in the greater-DFW area and you can REALLY hear it in their playing. I know more than a few of the Snarky cats have moonlighted in various country/Texas Country and Rock/R&B cover bands at times. Houston players have more of a traditional sound. Those cats don't play anything BUT Jazz. Straight-ahead, fusion, whatever. Its much more of an old-school sound.   I'd also like to elaborate on what I mean about the Houston scene. Houston doesn't really have much of a music scene in ANY sense for a large number of reasons (TOO BIG, not really a ""cool"" spot or area of town for people to know to catch live music, etc.) However, there is an upper echelon of about 50 or so absolutely WORLD CLASS jazz musicians who make their living by gigging day in, day out 6-7 nights a week. Everything from private events to tours as sidemen for international touring acts like Al Jarreau to the simple wine bar gig on a Tuesday night in Montrose.

Jazz,3drj5w,MePlayDrums,4,Sun Jul 19 01:47:09 2015 UTC,His parents were there just as kinda to help him get where he needed to go. He really seemed like he loved doing what he was doing on his own and that he really didn't need any motivation from his parents or anyone else!
Jazz,3drj5w,sajrah,3,Sun Jul 19 01:58:42 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Too often is it the parents forcing the child to do something.
Jazz,3drj5w,Zcott,2,Sun Jul 19 02:54:07 2015 UTC,Did he swing? And what'd he play?
Jazz,3drj5w,seasonedwell,5,Sat Jul 18 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"he swung like crazy! he played some of his own compositions, coltrane, My Funny Valentine, stuff like that with his trio. He played Whisper Not and Cool Breeze with us (Jazz At Lincoln Center Youth Orchestra)"

Jazz,3drj5w,AlfaTomato,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:41 2015 UTC,Do you think he understands the theory and everything behind what he plays? What do you think makes him such a successful musician at a young age?
Jazz,3drj5w,CoconutDust,2,Sun Jul 19 08:59:38 2015 UTC,"I think he really does get it. To what degree he understands it, such as actually reading the chords and knowing what he's doing, I'm not 100% sure. But the way he was playing with us...I would say he totally gets it. In some of the videos I upload later I think you can see him talking musically to the bass player in his trio and it's just crazy that he can do it at such a young age. He started by listening to his dad's old jazz records and taught himself piano from that which is just incredible. It's hard for me to say at this point what makes him so successful but I think a part of it is that it comes really naturally to his brain so it's something he's already gonna be inclined towards."

Jazz,3dsod5,Speznaz123,3,Sun Jul 19 02:05:11 2015 UTC,I do it all the time! It's extremely helpful as it internalizes the tones and licks you play and that makes it way easier to create melodic lines during my solos. It's all about the ears.
Jazz,3dsod5,JoeConti21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"Guitar player here, but I do it a lot when I'm practicing new stuff. It's an amazing way to get what's in your head and what your fingers are doing to sync up, and you can do it on a gig for some cheap points with the audience"
Jazz,3dsod5,djangoman11,0,Sun Jul 19 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"I would love to be able to, but, I don't think I can. It feels like I'm doing two things at once and I tend to lose focus."
Jazz,3dol8t,SingInMeMuse,11,Fri Jul 17 23:43:28 2015 UTC,whosampled.com might work.
Jazz,3dol8t,JoaquinBandersnatch,8,Sat Jul 18 01:25:24 2015 UTC,The listing for a-train would be bananas
Jazz,3dol8t,engartst,6,Sat Jul 18 03:15:49 2015 UTC,It Don't Mean a Thing would be the same.

Jazz,3dol8t,jazzytrombone,4,Sat Jul 18 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"nice idea. instead of whosampled, it might be called whoquoted. It just might take a whole lot more effort and research to crossreference all jazz tracks."
Jazz,3dol8t,levicelery,3,Sat Jul 18 05:30:29 2015 UTC,Yes it would be a very VERY longterm project. Maybe once I graduate from college I'll do something with it
Jazz,3dol8t,alseye,3,Sat Jul 18 05:32:54 2015 UTC,Why don't you do it?

Jazz,3dol8t,impussible,6,Sat Jul 18 02:44:50 2015 UTC,"I like the idea a lot.  I've wanted to do a similar thing except for harmonic progressions rather than melodies, but melody would be equally interesting to do.  I made an app a while ago which lets you search for jazz artists that have appeared with each other on recordings.  Maybe I could take a stab at this one if i have some time!"
Jazz,3dol8t,BedriddenSam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:23:17 2015 UTC,great app!  thanks for that.
Jazz,3dol8t,j3434,2,Sat Jul 18 08:35:04 2015 UTC,Yes there should.
Jazz,3dol8t,rddtacct,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:08:16 2015 UTC,"Can you give an example of a jazz song lick ""quoted"" in another song? Do you mean like how the 60's hippie bands like Doors and Traffic borrowed chord progressions? Or do you mean ... what do you mean?"
Jazz,3dol8t,j3434,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"In jazz, ""quoting"" is the process of playing a famous phrase during an improvised solo. A famous story goes that Sonny Rollins once quoted the melody line ""In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it"" at exactly midnight the Saturday before Easter (signifying that it had just become Easter Sunday in the middle of a solo. OP wants to create a site that indexes instances where standard tunes are quoted."
Jazz,3dol8t,rddtacct,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:52:58 2015 UTC,"It would be hard to find many of them - or should I say enough to make a web page. There would be some few significant effective quotes here and there as far as I know. What is your favorite? I would say mine occurs in pop music. In Stevie Wonder's Fingertips Part 2 he plays ""Marry Had A Little Lamb"""
