Usually a single player can share enough energy, but occasionally you'll see the entire team sharing that energy.  How is it possible to share energy like that you may ask?

Since the average dog is about 1/7th the mass of a human, the dog year comes out to be about 1/7th of a human year, give or take a few months.

The way they see it, they sat around all day and nothing exciting happened, and when you get home they're excited that something is finally happening. When you do absolutely nothing all day, time seems to move at least 7 times slower.  That's also why the phrase ""the dog days of summer"" exists. Heat makes time move slower, so in the ""dog days,"" it's so hot that the days seem to last around 7 times longer than normal.

ExplainLikeImCalvin,3bvcgp,wicro,44,Thu Jul 2 13:26:28 2015 UTC,"Well you see, magnets are rocks from deep down near the center of the earth. Since the center of the earth is where gravity comes from, these rocks get a full blast of it almost all the time and soak up some of it. They don't actually have enough gravity to pull you or me in, but they can attract metal and other magnets. The reason magnets have 'north' and 'south' ends comes from the fact that one side spent most of the time facing the center of the earth and the other side spent none."

This again means they are pushing space around them more than if they were small and when something not as huge as a magnet comes into contact with a magnet, space swallows the other thing and glues it onto the magnet.    But if you put two magnets together, you may see one pushing the other away because he doesn't want a magnet up his ratata! When two magnets are in love, the glue to each other!"

And you know how, when you register for a website and find out your preferred username is taken, so you just add a bunch of random symbols after it? It is basically the same thing. When the Scottish people first started making Scotch, they labeled the barrels. However, this didn't really help, because they just ended up with a lot of barrels labeled ""Glen's Scotch"", since most Scottish people are named Glen MacDonald. So they started putting random nonsensewords on the labels so they could distinguish it. Much like how you had to name your WoW character ""calvindarkstar1539gs""."
