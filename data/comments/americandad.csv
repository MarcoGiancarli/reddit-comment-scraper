Off the top of my head, S10E12 ""Introducing the Naughty Stewardesses"", where Roger and Steve swap faces. The part when Roger hits Steve in the face with a lamp and says, ""ah, shouldn't have hit him in the face...that's my face"" cracks me up every time.   Will probably update with a few more favorites as I think of them.   EDIT: Thought of another one! S08E11 ""Old Stan in the Mountain"" when Roger and Francine are practicing for a dancing competition and actually it's for Roger to get a red wig. For two reasons, first, the line, ""I have the keys you stupid biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch"". Second, they reference my hometown, Louisville.   EDIT 2: Okay now they're really coming to me. S08E18 ""Toy Whorey"", for the B plot of Roger and the bottle of Rain Duck. ""YOU'RE GETTING A PUNCH!"" As well as, ""I sometimes sleep under your car. Like a cat or a meth addict. I'm not a cat. meooow""  EDIT 3: So sorry for making this comment so long. S08E16 ""The Boring Identity"", when Steve takes up a paper route and Roger is the best paper boy. ""M-M-M-M-More money means M-M-M-M-More speech therapy.""   EDIT 4: I swear this is my last one (probably not) S11E11 ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", while the A plot is incredible! I strangely enjoyed the story with Stan and Hayley with Robert Wuhl. I have no idea who he is or what Arli$$ was, but I love the potato salad jokes."
americandad,3dkgs7,united1020,4,Fri Jul 17 00:20:47 2015 UTC,The face swapping machine was probably one of the most disturbing and horrific things I've ever seen but that plot was so funny

Greg and Terry, deputy Bullock, Steve's friends, even very minor ones like Shari and Buckle have great moments. I think that's why the Cleveland Show didn't hit with me (and apparently many others) because while the humor is pretty much the same the surrounding cast was really weak.
