PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,Masked_koopa,3,Tue Jul 21 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think ease of use by itself makes a character overpowered. There are definitely characters that are easy to use in the sense that little aiming ability is required to do well (Toxic Pea, Paleontologist, Plumber, etc.) but I don't think that alone makes them OP.  I think a character being OP should be judged by if they can succeed at almost any range (looking at you super commando) or if they completely dominate their ideal range to the point where other same-range variants become redundant.  In my mind the agent pea is much more deadly than the toxic pea even though the agent pea is more difficult to use effectively. I know they have different jobs but, at least for me, it's much easier to work around a toxic pea than an agent pea.  Not to say that nerfs to these ""easy to use"" characters shouldn't happen. I understand this game is for a more casual audience but you shouldn't be able to just spam in the general direction of the opponent and get kills easily.   I guess in short, a character being ""OP"" should be judged by how well it performs with a good player, not just ease of use."
PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,Executionator,2,Wed Jul 22 00:40:52 2015 UTC,"Citrus Cactus is maybe the easiest character in the game to play, but it isn't OP by any stretch of the imagination"
PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,Music2th08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:10:30 2015 UTC,"No, easy to use didn't mean Overpowered at all, if it was the case,pretty much 3/4 of the cast would be overpowered.   For me there is two type of ""easy to use"" char, Clutch character and the beginner friendly character   Clutch character are char that do well in lower skill level but fall flat against higher skill level of play, Garden warfare didn't have any straight example afaik. But toxic pea came close due to trading direct hit damage for a better splash.  Beginner friendly char are simply char that are also easy to use but still end up being effective in higher level of play, in GW,pretty much every char but the scientist are beginner friendly. Including most variant.  So do that make them OP? Obviously not,they are all more and less balanced as for now."
PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,boolerex,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:11:35 2015 UTC,"If there is an easy to use character that is also easily abused by good players, then it's OP. But to be completely honest a good player can do better with another variant besides Toxic Pea or Chemist. Easy to use characters are fun!"
PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,orangemofo,2,Wed Jul 22 06:51:22 2015 UTC,"IMO the real problem here is how abusable they are.  Take to Toxic Pea for example. What do A LOT of players choose to do with him?   Find a high ground where the splash is uncounterable, if they are hit, they would hide. Then reappear to spam. It is not uncommon to see Toxic Pea getting Vanquish Master, Streak Master and Assist boasts. And also, I mean how nasty is it to be hit long range with SUCH EASE? Sniper classes have to aim. If I was far from opponents, I would feel safer. If I was to hide from Toxic Pea, I would move it but it wouldn't make much difference because of the splash. If a sniper killed me even though I am moving a lot, I would be impressed. Also yeah, that Toxic Pea just got Assist master because he chips away much of my HP, then gets me killed by an encounter with other player. If in encounter with opponent, what do most Toxic Pea do? Jump around. You don't jump around with other classes because you have to aim. Even regular Peashooter should not jump around. I mean, how do you EVADE AND HIT AT THE SAME TIME. If I was facing him I would have hard time hitting him and miss a lot because he is jumping all over my face. Let's say his damage is not strong, but HE WOULD BE HITTING ME AND EVADING MY ATTACKS, by the time he hit me for say 70dmg I probably hit him 30dmg or lower. My DPS MIGHT BE STRONGER ON STATS BUT ALL OF IT WILL NOT HIT. He has more consistent attacks landing on me.   TBH sometimes it would be as much as cheating, the way a lot of people choose to use him. I am not generalizing but most just uses him in such way.  This can be said with some Engineer variants. Plumber jumping around while on jackhammer? He kills me before I even get the chance to aim, while he does not have to.  You are probably working hard using a character which uses skill, and this character just makes his way to the top of the leaderboard most of the time."
PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,fierypunkd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:54:17 2015 UTC,"Find a high ground where the splash is uncounterable   My personal opinion on that is that happens regardless of variants, players will find spots that make them as unaccessible as possible to enemies while taking advantage of their situational abilities.   And really, those spots are not impossible to counteract, they just take effort and time. If a Toxic pea is getting all the boasts, again, a personal opinion is that it points more to a weak team overall.    Toxic Pea just got Assist master because he chips away much of my HP, then gets me killed by an encounter with other player.   Situationally, that's what the Toxic pea is for. Weaken a group of zombies and let everyone else pick them off.   Even regular Peashooter should not jump around.     I don't think a pea shouldn't jump / shoot just because you think they shouldn't or someone else can probably be more accurate with it than you can.   The perks of a toxic pea is the splash, but it has a limited round, fairly long reload and unless you get a direct hit, the damage is still pretty meh for 1v1s.   I guess, when people claim that certain variants are ""abused"", I don't see how its contained to a single variant when its more the type of strategies that players employ that are being ""abused""."
PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,whurlwinds,0,Wed Jul 22 10:08:11 2015 UTC,"no, it's what makes this game more accessible while also giving variation, toxic pea needs some tweaking but hes definatly not op, people just seem to think he is. to are a few other variants that are also a bit to easy (stares at half of the engineers) but i wouldn't consider any of them op"
PvZGardenWarfare,3e4i6r,spacemanandrew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"There are definately OP classes, having way too much versatility and DPS simultaneously. To make game variations work, there should NOT be a class that excels at every single situations(Super commando, Paleontologist), has too much DPS to counter it within time(Super commando, Agent pea), shadows every other variants(Fire chomper, Paleontologist) or spamming one is so easy and efficient that you donâ€™t have to think about aiming(Toxic pea, Electrician).  Some people prefer to defend them to cheese more out of them but it is clear that when a more than average foe use those OP classes against you, you CANNOT maintain your gameplay experience without switching to a yet another OP class. (unless you decided to try so hard to stop the vicious circle like myself) Having OP class basically kills the game content so drastically and severely. I do agree that a newbie may wish to leverage them but a so-called good players with 313lv. sticking to super commando ONLY is already meta on PC platform. It is impossible to have a single game without 5 super commando pro guys wrecking plants only to make others do the same in the next game.  Edit: While OP variants problem is a thing, people in my server found out that if they stack on each other with 3+ voice cheating pro OP class spammers they basically cannot lose a single game. Welp, all public servers became a clan league, except it is more like Clan thugs vs Pugs:OP warfare"

I am not saying I have seen it or it doesn't happen, but I have encountered what you have described far less in GW than any other FPS in recent years.  For me it was one of reasons to play (593 hours and counting) more GW - there was less clan activity than other shooters.   I just wanted a game I could pick up (PUG) at any time and enjoy -  and for 99% of the time this is still true."

They are so similar Chester chomper or chomp thing, they didn't add anything really new for the class Cactus is hard to choose as they all kinda unique...My pick would be ice cactus as his ice gimmick pretty much fall flat.  Super commando... He kinda overshadow the more interesting tank commander Engineer is also hard to choose for the same raison as cactus but if I have to make a choice that would be welder just cause it a another fire variant Dr chester is a bit too similar to chemist to be interesting but that it All-star have a tons: Baseball star, hockey star, wresting star are all variant with different stats but nothing that really stand out, and of course they are inferior to basic anyway."

I love all the Sunflowers, but I'd have to say Fire Flower too because others are more interesting to use.  Fire Chomper - I don't know but I just don't like him. Also the regular Chomper for having no perks.  Future Cactus - I like her but I'd like to keep my sniper hidden. I have snipe spots for every map where I have great view but can remain unharmed/hidden for the whole duration but the future cactus gives her location.  Z4 Crossbow - coz OP  Electrician - the concept of splash + electric chain sounds good but his wasn't quite done right.   Dolphin Blaster - he is missing the fun of being scientist. Being accurate using shotgun(Scientist,Physicist,etc) or being close enough to hit using point blank shotgun(Chemist, Dr Chester)  100% agree with what you said about the All Stars.

PvZGardenWarfare,3dwk0c,ExOTiC1234,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"Really great post. I've always been against nerfs in general. I'd rather see characters get buffed to reach balance than nerfed, if possible. Nobody likes their favorite character getting messed with, and once you nerf one or more variants, there will almost always be a new variant that rises to OP status as a direct result. Your post, though has some very excellent points, and I find myself agreeing with you about the three characters being too well-rounded and too effective/versatile. But honestly, I don't see that as a bad thing. Those three characters, along with the toxic pea, are great classes for beginners. It's sort of like Welcome Mat, but with variants. It's a bit of a choice. Am I in the mood for an easy game where I will be cursed for doing well simply because of the variant I chose, or would I prefer a challenge and possibly let my team down? It's not just about combat versatility, but playstyle versatility or even difficulty versatility or whatever you want to call it.   I'm mostly just playing devil's advocate here. I think your post is well thought out and convincing. I was just responding with a few thoughts I had while reading it. The fact that I don't see any of these variants (save the stock foot soldier) being used overwhelmingly, leads me to believe that not everyone likes to just run around with the flavor of the month variant mopping the floor with everyone on the other team. If I saw teams of nothing but toxic peas or paleo/super commandos, then ya, there is a problem. Stock foot soldier is debatable whether or not people use him overwhelmingly because he's easy, or more fun to play, or because they have all of his upgrades since he's the starter variant, or possibly because he's the first character choice once the game loads."

You sure as hell sound like one, and the way you analyse the characters bit for bit is jaw dropping, I have no words for how well this is, can you give me tips though? I like to play stock Peashooter, as if you miss you can still hit, and when you get DHs, the damage is great. So I'm wondering if it's good or I should play a different character. I'm sure you might say ""well if you like it, then it makes it better than every variant"" and I agree. I use all default abilities, and I try to get Crits as often as possible, lead my shots, etc, my stickerbook says 43-46% accuracy, and I usually run tank commander, Ddefault scientist, because that damage is wonderful, and can still partially counter mid range, landscaper, because if you aim right, he is better than every engineer, and All-star and hockey star. Mystic flower, count chompula, camo cactus and stock cactus. I find a lot of the stock characters great, just overlooked because they are not ""new"" like other variants, I'm glad people use Retro gatling, as they deal less damage since they can't aim. I just use regular gatling as I heard it was much better. So, any tips?"

PvZGardenWarfare,3dwk0c,Executionator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"I like your suggestions.   I have thought that the super commando and paleontologist should probably get nerfed as well, didn't give much consideration to the foot soldier.  My initial thoughts of a nerf to the super commando was to reduce the damage and increase the reload speed. Maybe something like 15 consistent damage with maybe a 0.75 second reload time. Not sure how that would work out but it was a thought that I had. This would make him much less effective at close range   Paleontologist is such a stupid character but I love him. You can literally just shoot into the garden and get kills due to splash and DOT. Even at close range he is decent, not at good as most other scientist variants but he definitely isn't helpless. I like your suggestion of no splash making his shots not as spammable. 10 damage seems a bit low to me, maybe like 15 seems okay as long as there's no splash which also catches them on fire. On top of that reduce the close range damage to under 40. That would make him more of a mid range attacker.  Just some thoughts of mine. Didn't put as much as you so they may be too little or too much."

Didn't even knew Palentologist got splash in his weapon lol, should be removed if it really the case then."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dwk0c,TouchTheInfinite,0,Mon Jul 20 10:33:26 2015 UTC,"Paleo was specifically designed to be a short and long range healer. It is in the patch notes, which were put up by a popcap dev. His splash is not like toxic etc, without a hit on one character, iron maiden, etc, there is no splash. He also is the weakest or one of the weakest scientist variants at close quarters, and the amount of rounds needed for a kill is ridiculous (17 damage at range and people are too stupid to move out of the way?) So yeah, he is a jack of all tradez yet a master of none. He is not OP, he functions exactly as the devs intended."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dwk0c,TouchTheInfinite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need splash though, that just makes him stupidly good at long range for a character that does over 40 damage at close range. The suggested nerf would just stop people from shooting at long range without having to aim. Right now he makes archeologist completely redundant, as he does the same damages but with splash and fire DOT."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dwk0c,spacemanandrew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:20 2015 UTC,"But you do have to aim at long range. Headshots are like 17 damage, no splash to other characters unless you make a direct hit. If you can get whittled down from 17 damage shots, over quite some time without moving, you deserved to die. A versitile character is not OP. An OP character is one who dominates at all ranges. Astronaut is a better sniper, and variants like bio and chemist do way more damage at close range. This is why people believe super commando is OP. He dominates at short and long."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dwk0c,PyroSpark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:44:02 2015 UTC,"He doesn't do head shots. And yes, splash DOES happen just by hitting the ground, that's how you're getting 10 direct damage on opponents. Whatever the case is, he does NOT need splash to be decent at long range."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dx6p5,PickingPixel,4,Mon Jul 20 07:28:06 2015 UTC,"You forgot to mention that regular tallnut is better as a ""step"", which allows you to shoot from places normally unsuitable. It's also better for getting on rooves, which often make better cover than iron maidens.   For anyone looking to get high streaks,  I recommend using drone REALLY often. It's a risk-free way of actively getting kills, as long as long as you hide your ""body"" in a safe spot far behind the garden."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dx6p5,Masked_koopa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:05:31 2015 UTC,"However, the iron maiden can also be used as a step easily if you jump on the back of it. Also, the iron maiden is much better for flying on your drone then the regular tallnut and as the post said, it's better for defense.        EDIT: Then again, the normal tallnut is better as a step but the advantages of an iron maiden (along with how you could use it a step as well) still make the iron maiden the ideal choice for most matches."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dx6p5,alexgonzalez409,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:31 2015 UTC,Reason why I prefer Tallnut is you can use more of it than the Iron Maiden. Some good snipe spots require using two or more tallnuts to get to.
PvZGardenWarfare,3dx6p5,SirCuluuuu,3,Mon Jul 20 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"TallNuts and Maidens in G&G are mainly for slowing down box zombies.  They really do make a difference if you place them right around the garden. They can be taken out of course, but if they are at the garden then the zombies have to target them while in range of the plants counter attack.    If the zombies don't take out the tallnuts or maidens, then there box zombies will have trouble getting in against a solid plant team defense.  I've seen this happen before and I have been on the receiving end of it.  If I am carrying a zombie team on vanquishes and we aren't making progress, it usually means three of my outhouses zombies are having a battle with a maiden somewhere.    Yes, AI zombies will go after tallnuts and maidens as if they are plants and fight them while the clock ticks off.    Potato nugget mines are only good in Garden OPs.  Really good for protecting the garden or to place in front of your potted plants.  NEVER go into the garden as a cactus unless you are dropping mines or putting up tall-nuts.  Even if its being captured, get in range to pick off the zombies in there.  Let the peas rush in with their chili bombs.  The exception of course if its an Overtime fight or a final push."

I can handle the fire and the vairants themseves, but not the eugh! eugh! my character makes and the screen shaking when being hurt by it, as it makes aiming 3x harder.

So he end up pretty bad with it Fire flower is generally considered a good variant dispirite the lower ammo clip. Fire chomper...He pretty much just take advantage of this breath to attack from behind without being forced to shallow instead of the actual fire damage Fire cactus pretty much trade pure damage for DOT. Centurion is kinda different but is still a nice side grade. Weider is actually decent thank to the small fire rate boost that make it a bit easier to spread fire. Palentologist get a good range option while still getting decent in close range (maybe too much). Cricket star is pretty much the only good all-star variant that isn't basic,thank to the very high fire rate.   And yeah every single class have a fire variant so far."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dx37t,boolerex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"Fire pea is just a bit more skill based, I use him when my team is hopelessly outnumbered, and he does great. Don't underestimate him.  As for all star variants I think that these two are actually really good.  Golf star is AMAZING, and he's the best all star at longer range, I don't get why no one uses him, he's only just not OP.  Hockey star is great at close range, don't underrate him.  Sorry for a bit of an off-topic reply, but you're seriously underestimating some variants ;)"

PvZGardenWarfare,3duvod,fierypunkd,0,Sun Jul 19 19:41:13 2015 UTC,"but with marine bio you can 3 hit kill all plants except for the chomper and destroy garlic drones, all the chemist/chester can do is run away when they see a garlic drone."
PvZGardenWarfare,3duvod,ApolloIntheSky,3,Sun Jul 19 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"While the Marine can 3 hit most plants, its damage is not consistent unless you are kissing your target which the chemist/chester do not have to do. The Marine also lacks the spread the chemist/chester have which allows them to hit multiple targets at once for the same damage.  The LITTLE spread the marine has is a huge fall in damage meaning the Marine cannot solo a group of 3-4 plans like the chemist and chester can do successfully.   The Marine is strong straight 1vs1 and could be better than Chester overall, but it requires him to kiss his opponents and be dead on close to get that 3 shot KO.  With the chemist and chester, you know what you are going to do and you don't have to necessarily be dead on close to do it. They also KO multiple targets at once on a SINGLE clip."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dvmqo,orangemofo,3,Mon Jul 20 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"Energy warp - not bad per say, but choosing this over one of the best abilities in the game in regular warp is just silly. It may be good for the mansion, but not much else.  Chesterweed - Spiky spikeweed, but bright orange! Yaaaaaay. All the zombies will step on this for sure, it blends in perfectly.  Regular sunbeam - It lasts longer, which is just giving the foot soldiers more time to ZPG your face in.  Artichoke drone - Rocket drone would be here too, but it's a lot easier to ride, and thus I actually like it's inclusion. With a singular corn strike that only deals 25 damage, and a weaker primary weapon, artichoke drone is just completely useless. 15 more health still puts you at an awful 20 health. If it had 75, or even 50 health I might feel differently, but as it stands I can't see any reason to give up the ability to take down the teleporter in a few seconds."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dvmqo,Masked_koopa,2,Sun Jul 19 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"Including custom:   5) Armored Heal Station: hard to destroy sure ; but it because of how it heal so slowly, plant generally wouldn't even care about it and would just shoot you instead. It still have utility when put in a garden, but otherwise it generally inferior. 4) Sprint burrow: Way too low duration for the speed to matter ; add that the near impossibility to burrow kill out of that skill and you have a skill that just never work 3) Super Pea Jump; The lost of speed for higher jump height is very very situational,most of the time the additionnal air time actually make you easier to shoot,completely wasting the interests of it in the first place. 2) Shield decoy: Putting more shield would have been interesting, but unfortunately, those shield just get destroyed quickly by everything ever,they are harder to climb into and still have the lowish cooldown of the standard shield. 1) Potato nugget mine: 50 damage mine only allow you to kill the basic browncoat zombie and that it...Forcing you to sack them if you want any lasting damage which just defeat the propose of this side-grade at the first place. They also still have the same cooldown as mine to make sure you will never get back those 5 mine slot you started with.   Notable contenter:   Dark flower (only considered bad because you need the self heal much more,actually decent if yoy have a another sunflower to heal you instead)    Cheesy warp (30 damage warp at the cost of only one slot of warp is meh,but thankfully it have a low enough cooldown to be just okayish)   Additionally, Retro Gatling is actually pretty good if you use it in close range, it just have a very notifiable fall off and the total ammo is a tad too low."

PvZGardenWarfare,3duvwn,CAPTINMINCRAFT,2,Sun Jul 19 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"Potato Mine Drone - A land drone. You control the potato mine so you can strategically position it in the garden or anywhere you want. Radar - you place it in an area and within its radius, you can see all the stickers of the enemies so you can snipe targets better. Downside is it kinda gives away that there might be a sniper near the radar. Other plants can also go in there to find who they will target."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,nutmegpancake,7,Sun Jul 19 02:27:32 2015 UTC,"I can see your point and I would never throw an objective, but it should also be noted that the game is inherently in favour of the zombies capturing all objectives up until the final one.   It is less common to see the plants win before that just because the game is built to last a good portion of time. Putting it into perspective if there was an even battle at each objective (50/50 odds either side would win) we would only see the final objective in one in every sixteen matches.   That is clearly not how Popcap designed the game, therefore the actual task set for the zombies is very easy. I think a lot of people always assume that the zombies will win simply because the game is built this way and while I have never tried to let them win as the first few objectives are very naturally designed to be in their favour, defeat on these is almost inevitable if the zombies are anything but awful.   I do not personally think you earn more money by finishing games, and winning early. While you do get a win bonus which does helps, the intermission and loading times just make it unworthwhile in terms of coins per minute overall. So in this respect I think your boyfriend may be mistaken.   Something to consider is that what we are measured, or rewarded by, shapes our behaviour. If Popcap wanted the plants to give it there all, at every objective they could weight the rewards in a way that increases the sooner that they stop the zombies. So stopping them on the first garden could yield a 10,000 win bonus, stopping them on the last, only 2,000. However I imagine that they thought doing so, and having more matches that finish on the first objective is actually less fun for both teams, and personally I'm inclined to agree with that."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,Propofolkills,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:57 2015 UTC,"Super post, well worth the read."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,whatarewaves,0,Tue Jul 21 12:29:50 2015 UTC,"Boyfriend here, I hadn't thought about the loading screens really, just that the perfect captures would give around 7-8k so in my head it seemed since the perfect captures were really short, that you would gain more that way. Thinking about how long it takes to start a match though I'm very inclined to agree with you lol.   I kinda wish that popcap had given me more incentive to try to do the objective I'm being told to do. But like you said short games are often not as fun. I just don't want it to suck to be a plant.   Also, I think I'll actually time a few of my matches and see what the averages are. I'll probably post my results on the sub in a couple days."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,Chronospherics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:20:48 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to know, for sure! :)  I'm always disappointed when the zombies don't take the first objective, just because it means they didn't try hard enough. The first objective is always especially easy to take, but they often spend too long camping for kills and leave it till too late to push for the garden.   It's also amusing how easy it is for them to take it, if they wanted to. Requiring to be captured only once to win a zone, it's unbelievably easy to just rush. Plants like Cacti aren't realistically going to be on objective area, and sunflowers can't hold any ground against footballers etc. So the zombies dominate this space, and only need to hold it for about 10 seconds. It's very easy to do if they coordinate even a little bit."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,ExOTiC1234,7,Sun Jul 19 21:34:10 2015 UTC,There needs to be a +1000 coin bonus for each garden you defend and a +3k for a perfect defense. You barely get any coins for defending the objective fully and thats why people could care less. also its fun to have a long game then just a 5 minute wrecksge.
PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,Eladtzvi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:00:07 2015 UTC,good idea
PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,Executionator,5,Sun Jul 19 16:30:56 2015 UTC,"It is true that you get coins for each defended garden but usually you actually do get more coins if you go until the last round than if you stop them at the first or second garden. The coins from ko's, assists, streaks, revives, plants, etc. add up and by the time you're done you can end up with 15-20k whereas if you win at the first garden it can be like around 7k.   I think I've only encountered that happening like a few times but yeah it makes the game less fun. I'm with you in that I'd rather everyone play the game seriously the whole time because it's more fun that way. Besides, you get coins fast anyways so there isn't much need to do that."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,Executionator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"of course you get more coins because the game is longer, but as faw as cpm your getting less as you dont get the garden defended bonus. most of your coins in this game comes from the end of the round, if your letting the zombies cap the garden at the last second as the plants BOTH teams are getting the least cpm possible."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,redHEYseuss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:53:20 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right you do get more cpm for defending the first garden as plants. If your goal is to get coins as fast as possible it would still be in your best interest as a plant to defend well.
PvZGardenWarfare,3dsqko,boolerex,2,Mon Jul 20 00:16:27 2015 UTC,We have noticed this too. It is annoying. When it happens we usually stick around for that game then exit out and try to find a different one. I can't stand it. Coins or no coins.

Point is they can kill you easily even though its just a noob. I hope you get it.  Shooting from a distance with massive spam? Lol at you if youre gonna defend it. Shooting from distance with a sniper? At least it takes skill.  I didnt get ""angry"" please read properly. He said on reddit that the Cactus ""sucks"" because he cant hit and would just stay with Toxic Pa coz of the splash, I just found that sad.  Plumber as your favorite variant already says a lot about you."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,whurlwinds,5,Sat Jul 18 04:48:51 2015 UTC,"Plumber as your favorite variant already says a lot about you.   That's completely unnecessary. You don't need to be snide to make a point.  It is a fair point for people to feel that certain parts of the game require less skill because of the game mechanic where splash also deals damage.   However, I think that most people who have played this game and still do, enjoy the diverse characteristics of the multiple variants.   I always wonder why people like to jump quickly to the conclusion that a character is OP or does not require a certain level of mastery to be good at them just because they're easier to pick up. You've still got to be a good player to be accurate, to handle your character well during airborne motions, or use situational circumstances to benefit your own gameplay.   The different characteristics always act as prompts to think about how situational most characters are and how and when or where to use them or against a specific class to counteract what they're good at.   Basically, the game is more interesting as it is than without those game mechanisms. If someone wanted to play a COD or BF type game, they should play those games instead of asking a game to be changed to be like them."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,whurlwinds,-2,Sat Jul 18 11:25:20 2015 UTC,"I know it sounded wrong but I was referring to him about shooting splash from a distance.  Yeah, I definitely agree and that is the reason why I love this game the most out of all shooter games, its large variety of playstyle.  But my point is to make it balanced. I don't have a problem with a Camo Cactus headshotting me for 66 dmg. He is a pure sniper, zooms too far, aims really slow and more penalties, making it reasonable for him to deal that much damage. On the other hand I do have a problem with Super Commando who can deal more damage without difficulty.  Splash damage should be reasonable. If the splash has a wide radius then the splash damage should be small. If it has smaller radius then I'm definitely fine with it dealing more damage. The Plumber's splash is about as strong as Ice Pea's direct damage so that is definitely not a balanced character. If he misses and splashes, it's still about as strong as Jade Cactus or Ice Pea hitting all their shots.  That's why I'm talking about nerfs, balancing. I love it for the variety of playstyle, I use every class but I can't use those characters because it's not satisfying to use unbalanced, same with the underpowered. I would love to play them when they become balanced."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,Weltall548,3,Sat Jul 18 11:58:53 2015 UTC,"No issue with you wanting to discuss about balancing and appreciate the points you're trying to make as well.   However, if you look at some recent post about categorising the different variants into tiers, it is fairly obvious that there are characters in this game that are easy to pick up and are dangerous on their own, even more so when used by skilled players.   And while I appreciate the point of contention about balancing the game, I also think that having characters like the Electrician / Plumber are good examples of how situational usage of characters can benefit objective gameplay.   If you're aware that a plumber has a huge splash radius that hits you pretty hard, you give them a wide berth and take quick snap shots at them when you can. Obviously, you'll have certain players who camp in places or only shoot from long-range, but that's part of the game and I accept it for it. What i'll do is to make adaptations to my game while also finding the time to sneak up these campers and take them down when possible.   When a garden is being defended by a large group of flowers/peas/chompers, it can be pretty tough separating them at all given how fast a downed enemy can be revived by the flower variants. In such a situation when i'm faced with a team that's attacking and not making a breakthrough, the Electrician is a super useful character to switch to to break these plants apart since staying tight means being affected by the chain damage. That could mean breakthrough attacking-wise for your team.  Toxic pea is an annoying variant on several maps and while it may be easy to use and pick up, it makes perfect sense as the variant to use when defending the castle map where zombies are filtered up the stairs. It's a super effective strategy but the toxic pea can still be taken down by good zombie players.  I apologise if i'm a little long-winded here, but I think the diverse nature of the variants make these fights super fun and interesting for me, even challenging when you're up against one of the higher-tier variants that you'll need to work your mind to think of how to counter the situation or avoid their strong points with the options provided by the different characters.  Again, in every game you'll have players who enjoy confrontations (1-1) and you'll have others who enjoy sniping / camping even. I just accept it as it is. However, a poorer player doesn't make a variant OP and neither does an easy to use character make a player less skilled.  Cheers"
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,IronCatFish,2,Sat Jul 18 12:30:39 2015 UTC,"Well if its dps you're talking about with Plumber you're completely wrong. Other classes misses and deal zero or default peashooter deals 10 dmg by splash so you still wont kill unless you use all your ammos. Plumbr can miss and still splash big damage. So if in a fight your damage is more consistent, as if you never miss.   Then why can I do equally well with Welder?   Shooting from a distance with massive spam? Lol at you if youre gonna defend it. Shooting from distance with a sniper? At least it takes skill.   Both are just aiming and shooting. Plumber is ineffective at long range, anyway.   Plumber as your favorite variant already says a lot about you.   Thanks a lot, jackass. I like it for its high impact damage and stupid appearance. The splash is just a bonus.  And your entire tone is angry.  Does anyone even call Plumber the best Engineer?"
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,Masked_koopa,0,Sat Jul 18 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify that Plumber thing. I made it a point on my post that I was talking about people who abuse the splash of them. The variant can be used as higher tier in terms of strength but it can be very often abused. Now I thought you were referring about that, defending the spamming. You commented on that point. I know the ""Plumber as your favorite"" sounded wrong but I thought you were spamming with Plumber from afar because my point was about spammers/how it can be abused and you defended it.  Like I said on other replies, spammer or not, the splash of Plumber is almost as strong as te direct of Ice Pea or Jade. Even if you miss, you do as much splash damage as their direct + if you do hit, high impact damage. It's as if you never miss. But it I learnt to tolerate it, unlike Super Commando, that's why I didnt say that he needs damage nerf. My point was still about how abusable its splash is.  My tone looked angry because you didnt understand some of my post properly and you had to say something as if I said that."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,Chronospherics,5,Sat Jul 18 16:10:00 2015 UTC,Chompers DO NOT need nerfs spray or otherwise.  The splash spammers you mentioned are pretty weak if not just annoyances.  The electrician can lose against a fire chomper even if it stuns it and lands direct hits in close range.  Agent Pea already nerfed
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,boolerex,0,Sat Jul 18 03:55:42 2015 UTC,"Like I said, the sprayer chomper does not become vulnerable unlike the Chomping Chompers which after they eat they have a high chance of dying after eating ONE enemy. The sprayer dont need high HP because they can kill MULTIPLE enemies with spray and ddoesnt have to be chewing, slow and helpless for 3 seconds.  The Chompers are helpless compared to Sprayers."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,boolerex,3,Sat Jul 18 04:56:06 2015 UTC,"You are just spurting out what you THINK Chomper sprays are like. They ALL do less damage per second than normal chompers, believe it or not, and none of them are even CLOSE to scientist. Don't beleive me? Take a look at the dps chart. :P"
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,fierypunkd,0,Sat Jul 18 07:27:31 2015 UTC,"yeah you actually have a point but the bite does not have as big of radius as the spray. So it can kill multiple enemies easier and can follow enemies better because it has better range.  But yeah I have to agree since I only looked to it like the Chompers only chomp and forgot about the bite.  Edit: i just used Chomper as a biter but it seems like it's bugged? A lot of times he would just stand there and not bite the enemy even though I am pressing it correctly. I dont spam the button at all, I go really slow but he still does not bite. Probably the game is having hard time reading if it is a bite or a chomp?  I would love the bite to be auto-fire even though they make him bite slower."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,boolerex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:42:09 2015 UTC,"I huge advantage for spray based chompers is that you can't accidental activate a chomp instant kill. Having to spam the button to fire on the chomping chompers means you can accidentally initiate the animation if they turn around, and that isn't always what you want."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dpabu,RWQFSFASXC,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Super commando: high dps, no reload and plain superior to any another variant in close-mid range (and still decent in long range), all with soldier skills make for a too versatile class. my suggestion would be to remove the fourth bullet upgrade and replace it to something weaker like a another reload speed (not like it quick enough already hue)  Agent pea: Give it back his 125 health and nerf headshot damage, maybe buff body shot damage for teleporter or stuff, Agent pea DPS at headshot is just crazy even if it not the easiest thing to hit and the health nerf is weird considering how different he is compared to default.  No further nerf or removal needed otherwise:   Toxic pea is a minor clutch considering you gave up direct hit damage for toxic damage. Plumber is fucked by everything that is higher then him aka then he's forced to get a direct hit to do damage Electrician still relies in direct hit to deal a decent amount of damage even against a group of plant and the splash is weak against a single target Fire chomper still have the core problem of a chomper of being screwed by roof camper and anything that shoot him out of this range."
PvZGardenWarfare,3dkdgx,CAPTINMINCRAFT,2,Thu Jul 16 23:46:30 2015 UTC,"IMO they should make it as close to the original battle as possible. Like if you get him on the slots, the music stops and pans over to the direction he will spawn and back. Oh yea, and keep the original music. It would be kinda cool to implement the ice/fireballs, but they would have to give you free ice shrooms/snapdragons for that to be fair, so I dunno."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dkwxc,Masked_koopa,2,Fri Jul 17 02:36:59 2015 UTC,"some abilities will make little sense in Zombie Ops, and for this reason i foresee zombies and plants getting some new and old abilities.    potato/nugget mines:   these are hardly as useful when you're on the attack  tallnuts: still useful for reaching good places, but not so much for camping.   we don't need cactus becoming foot soldiers just sitting on random high places.     gattling/retro pea and sunbeam/solar flare:   still useful obviously but not nearly as much.   it's much more suited towards defending.   need to be changed.  heal/dark flower:  dark flower is much less useful.   heal flower still is useful as a bad healing station, but again, this is much better when you are staying in one place defending as opposed to attacking.    spikeweed(all three): still useful for close range fighting, but it loses a lot of it's value when attacking like potatoes mines.    Chile/Sombrero bomb, hyper, and heal beam all are better thanks to this game mode.    the other abilities i feel are either fine or are very minority affected for plants."

PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,mantissteam,4,Thu Jul 16 19:33:00 2015 UTC,"You're too far away from the first Chomper to do any damage; right before you could do any damage, he got ZPG'd.  In your Agent Pea gif, you were too far from him when you first shot. In the second shot, you can see the damage counter ""40"" as he's getting ZPG'd.  Dr. Chester and the Chemist are very close range variants, fitting the shotgun class role better. The Chemist has a fixed 40 damage shot and Dr. Chester has a fixed 30 damage shot."
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,EpNn10,5,Thu Jul 16 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"I think that it is extremely good. OP, even. You just need to be very close (Chomper range) and it can do 40+ damage per shot."
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,I_Am_Gotham,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:17 2015 UTC,it might do 40+ damage once you get into his tiny range circle but you spend more time being out of range and missing easy kills you might have got with another variant. so it is actually a very limited variant on the battlefield that can only perform in one given range out of three.  so at general the chemist does not seem like the optimal character to play as main unless you have a specific goal  and on general tier lists i would place him down low
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,Eladtzvi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:09 2015 UTC,this is why regular scentist is better. 73 damage up close and can hit people for 20 at any range
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,ExOTiC1234,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:05 2015 UTC,Chemist is it's best when you spot 2 or more plants right next to each other. Get right in there and wreck shit. Hes got the widest spread. Chemist is easily a top 3 variant in his class. You just can't play him the same way as the others.
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,jimmykup,2,Fri Jul 17 02:51:03 2015 UTC,"after this thread decided to give him another try and play him right, and i can say he is now one of my favorites. i would not use him as main because its hard to keep a streak going once you move in its quite suicidal but his damage is like poetry :P sneaking up behind the garden with two warps getting there fast throwing in two sticky balls then blasting away with his weapon and damn they fall like flies, might not be the best variant but it sure is a fun one  http://i.imgur.com/9e48eTr.jpg"
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,Jocomat9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:30:21 2015 UTC,its worse for dr.chester . ..  Its mainly because the enemy is moving and with lag it causes this exact situation.

PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,PyroSpark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:52:05 2015 UTC,"You need to be point blank. And since he does 40 damage per shot, you can easily wipe out multiple plants in quick succession."

PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,Taylorhead,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:26:19 2015 UTC,"My best interpretation of the first and second gifs is some glitch where the damage wasn't being shown but was happening. Hard to say considering in the first the chomper was killed by ZPG, though in the second you got the coins for the kill so damage was happening somehow. Chemist has to be chomper-close to do significant pain but it does have a 180-degree spread so quite good for thinning out multiple targets who are, say, camping/sniping at the back. You can try normal warp as that may be more useful for the chemist to blink in and out of combat."
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,Executionator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:57 2015 UTC,The chemist had a nerf to his range along with clip size. I'm assuming they didn't change the reticle turning red with the new range he has. I never got to use him before the nerf but I bet that used to be his old range. You can actually shoot and get hit markers but won't do any damage. He's best when you get group of sunflowers hanging together or in gnome bomb you get groups of enemies trying to defuse the bomb. He's most fun to play for me cause you can take out several guys at once with the wide spread.
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,Eladtzvi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"You have to be very close to the enemy for the chemist to do any damage at all, which like you said is almost point blank. In the first gif you were too far for most of the shots. A good bet with the chemist is to be very sneaky. When you see an enemy warp up close to him and shoot him a few times and you will probably kill him unless it's a chomper or something then warp away to heal and repeat the process.  I had that struggle a bit when first using the chemist too. You just have to get used to his damage radius and he will do wonders."
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,ilikepstrophies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:28:27 2015 UTC,i can imagine him being a good solution in G&G when there are 20 seconds left to capture and all the plants are in the garden.   a wave of multiple chemists might clean out the entire garden combined with multiple heal stations
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,neongreen3395,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"Your first clip explains the chemist's range well. You took two shots at the chomper no hit markers but as you got closer for the third shot you got a hit marker so you now know the range. Basically, the chemist has no range but packs huge damage when you in the very short range."
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,JugglerCameron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"like others have said, youre too far away for chemist.  It shreds close range.  Also, you should be able to fire faster than you did in the 3rd gif - nearly full auto if memory serves correctly.  That area of the map/mode you were playing wasnt a great use for chemist.  Try it on a smaller vanquish map and remember to get close."
PvZGardenWarfare,3djg6d,spacemanandrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:24:49 2015 UTC,Chemist is super OP if played right I never end a game in anything but first place with him.   Plus you also get heals and revives.   Streaks are a bit harder but super doable.   I frequently get 2 or 3 person multi kills no one has as much spread as the chemist.   It's a different play style but he's super awesome if you learn it.

PvZGardenWarfare,3dga88,kaffars,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:35:09 2015 UTC,I actually find that astronaut very easy to run and gun seeing as his weapon you just have to  hold down the trigger and with careful aim mow down at least 2-3 plants before reloading. Taking hits? Warp outta there heal up. Ambushed? Throw some of those grenades then warp etc. Astronaut would be my go to scientist. I play on the PC as well. Maybe we should team up some time?
PvZGardenWarfare,3dga88,Executionator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:13:16 2015 UTC,Great guide as always. Keep them up! Lately I have been playing around with the astronaut and I like him. He is definitely a variant that you have to get used to and I'm still working on the accuracy at moving peashooters.  I have been doing something kind of similar where I stick with the more campy foot soldiers to help heal them and target plants in the beginning of the garden captures.  i think that laying traps with the sticky explody bomb does have its merits. It can help to weaken aggressive plants that try to sneak up on you/your party. It can help since astro is not great close range and the reduced health is nice. I do however definitely see the benefit of the mega heal bomb and there have been times where I wish I had it. It seems like a matter of preference between extra healing or security since the cheetah heal station can heal well by itself.  I've found he can also do well being discreet on the side while foot soldiers and all stars take the garden. The plants are usually more occupied with them while you can provide cover fire from a mid range. This is of course more dangerous than the more campy style since he gets overwhelmed at close range very easily. Not saying it's the best way to use him but it's a decent option for people less patient.
PvZGardenWarfare,3dga88,Eladtzvi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:32:28 2015 UTC,"this was a nice read.  astronaut is my main scientist, i use the exact abilities you mentioned but i play him a bit different then described, i mainly play sneaky and flank with him while the main rush forward is going on.  he feels best at a medium safe distance from the enemy but i do well with him at close distance as well dropping a heal bomb to my feet and having it explode in the middle of a 1on1 together with a heal station kept me alive many times.  and usually when flanking the opposition will be a random rouge single player, only major thing is notice him first and be ready for the 1on1."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dgmeu,Masked_koopa,2,Thu Jul 16 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"Played law pea quite alots ; one of my first unlocked variant I got then I started playing, gave it a try last game and here are the tip I can give to you:  Generally you want to get a low mouse sensibility in general in PC,not law pea specific ; it just in general. Make aiming easier and such ; it take a while to get used to so you can keep your current sensibility if you want  Now for the actual law pea type: In close range you generally want to unload all your shot,reload,unload all your shot until you kill the enemy. STAY IN THE GROUND WHILE SHOOTING it make it easier to hit that way and you can juke all you can once you need to reload.  You are rarely gonna hit all your shot that way but just hitting 3-4 shot each time allow you to kill everything that isn't a all-star after 1 reload.   You're obviously gonna have to reload alots due to the low clip and super fast-fire-rate so make sure you have a full clip before starting a fight.  Another good tip when using hyper: Unload in the ground then jump once you need to reload. If your timing is right you will be ready to fire again once you touch the ground. Repeat until hyper end and that should help you shooting at stuff then using hyper.  As for shooting at long range just aim and time your shot ; you don't have trouble with that but heh still worth mentioning.   And that should be all for now."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dgmeu,TeaMonk42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:45:42 2015 UTC,the only advice i could think of is something interesting i noticed watching my own recordings after matches. something i was not aware of while playing but was visible while re watching.   noticed when i get into a 1on1 situation i align myself with the zombie and copy his movement trajectory then all left to do is unload as fast as you want seeing you are both moving parallel to each other all shots should land. and you as law pea should have the advantage
PvZGardenWarfare,3dgmeu,Eladtzvi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"I play on the console so I don't think i've got any real tips to offer w.r.t mouse sensitivity.  But when I do use the Law Pea, I enjoy snooping around corners, anticipating oncoming opposition and having the small window of time advantage to get your aim on target and unload your rounds before slipping back into cover, reload and re-do if you don't get the kill within the first clip.   Super close distance works with enemies who're probably not full health, otherwise I'm more comfortable engaging at a slight close-medium distance where you have more time to reload and get a 2nd clip going if you don't down within the first. Hyper's usually used to give yourself the window of time to reload / create distance so that you've the opportunity to shoot again and be hard to pin down.   And.. a little bit of shameless sharing here"

PvZGardenWarfare,3dc3rn,spacemanandrew,2,Wed Jul 15 13:37:26 2015 UTC,"Dr chester USED to do 76.9 DPS, which translates to roughly three shots per second (he used to do 25 per shot). Now he does 30 damage per shot, which means he does over 90 dps. Copare him to chemist, who only does 72.7 dps, and you can see why Dr. chester is perfectly fine. That's not even going into the fact that chemist needs to shoot four times to kill 125 health characters, wasting 35 damage, and therefoe time. Dr chester shoots five times to kill an enemy, and only wastes 25 damage/time. You see why Dr. chester is better for people who know how to aim him?  Thecarlos summed up my opinion on law nicely. I personally think a slightly faster reload for law would not hurt, as currently killing a moving target without reloading is near impossible, and the reload is a bit too long when you take that fact into account. :P"

PvZGardenWarfare,3dbn5t,Taylorhead,2,Wed Jul 15 02:01:13 2015 UTC,So I'm not sure about the other goops but the regular purple goop does 25 damage on a direct hit. You get double 5s on a direct hit and then 3 more 5s after affect. If you miss and splash their feet you'd get say a 4 with an additional 3 5s. So a direct hit it is 25 and a splash hit is 18-19 damage. example

So when you have more characters and weapon upgrades go and play G&G (well  i prefer play with more character variants rather the free stuff thats not even good like chester chomper or the berry shooter).

PvZGardenWarfare,3dapoo,Executionator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"It's nice to hear that you're having fun with it. To answer a couple of your questions:   To an extent yes some classes/variants are better in certain game modes than in others. A good example being that Chompers in general are fine in Gardens & Graveyards but not very good in Garden Ops. This is because they are good for sneaking around and taking out enemies in a 1v1 situation or taking out a specific target, in garden ops you have swarms coming which is not good for this style. For the most part it isn't a huge deal when it comes to Gardens & Graveyards, Team Vanquish, Gnome Bomb, etc.  Fastest way to earn money (outside of using your own money to buy coins) is by playing Gardens & Graveyards. If you play a full game you can easily earn 10-20k coins which can add up quickly.  Yes you need to buy card packs to unlock things. You can get whole characters in the 40k character packs and pieces in most of the 20k ones. You can also get additional abilities in the 20k and legends of the lawn packs as well. I will admit it can take a while before you unlock all the characters and abilities but just keep at it and you will get them. Yes some people use the gestures to taunt after getting a kill. There's also some challenges that require them (ex: taunt 10 players after getting a kill). Some of them are kinda cool but you don't need to worry about them much.   The most packed game modes are team vanquish and gardens & graveyards and this is pretty true for all platforms with G&G probably being the most popular. Stick to the normal versions rather than the classic versions since more people play there and you can also use unlockable variants/abilities. If you play these modes you should have no trouble finding decent sized games. It will also be helpful to see the different variants so you know what they do."

She's an awesome human being so don't take it for granted. As for the game: don't take it too serious, have fun and experiment. The records don't matter, each game doesn't matter so there is no pressure. Die 100 times and no one really cares. Enjoy! Took me around 7 million coin to unlock everything so it's a slow process."

PvZGardenWarfare,3dapoo,iWizardBeats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"Just hit 313 a few days ago!  Here are a few tips I've found helpful along the way.    Shoot the feet of outhouse, coffin and barrel zombies if you're not chomper.  Chomper can just bite through any shield the zombie might have. Always put down potato mines, spikeweeds, sticky balls and proximity sonic mines when you have them.  Put them on top of zombie summon piles, around objectives, around blind corners, or hidden in the vegetation.   Always summon zombies if you're near a yellow pile or plant something if you're on the plant team.  If there aren't many chompers on the plant side, outhouse, coffin and barrel zombies are very helpful.  For plants, Bonk choy and doom shrooms for blind corners, scared shroom and laser bean for long range sniping, and bamboo shoots are nice for area damage near objectives or place healing flowers near the back areas of objectives.  Always keep moving.  If you have to stop moving for accuracy while firing a clip, move right away once you start reloading.   Try finding a way around a side to an objective instead of charging right at it.   If an objective has just been captured and you're scientist, put down a healing station right away.  People will often be grouped up and in need of some healing and it's easy points.  If you're a sunflower, put down a healing pot and heal your teammates whenever they need it.  It's an easy way to get points as well.  Use the high ground and cover.  It's much easier to shoot down on people, especially if your weapon has splash damage.  Don't stand in the open.  Hide behind things and peak around to shoot.   Don't be afraid to runaway and find a scientist or sunflower to bring you back to full health!"
PvZGardenWarfare,3dapoo,allisoonnn,-3,Fri Jul 17 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"Just play the broken classes like everyone else. The game doesnt take any real skill, just learn the maps. Also, dont spend any money. The game gets boring pretty quickly, you might have buyers remorse. People will try and treat the game like its battlefield or something. Run around and kill shit till youre blue in the face. The most broken class is the scientist and foot soldier. Level those first, pea shooter is the only real counter to them. Lastlt, there are ALOT of gaylords with 313 rank. Imagine if you will, the type of person that would treat this game as their primary shooter. Yes, theyre garbage and will probably crap on you as a new player so try and find balanced lobbies or play classic"

I can't seem to play any other plant class effectively other than the Chomper.  Zombies: All-Star; cricket or rugby. All-Stars are good in every situation. Chomper burrowing towards you? Sprint tackle or shields. Group of plants or you're about to die and want to take down your attacker with you? Imp punt can usually do the trick.

This is also another trick I found with my Cactus, I placed a bunch of nugget mines and tallnuts in the garden (not really a good idea because the explosion damages the tallnuts and iron maidens), repawned, replaced my tallnut and nugget mine with the Iron maiden and potato mine, placed a bunch of them in the garden.  And after that I planted my Garden and planted Ice shrooms on the two pots near the garden and laser beans on the others, got up the left side stairs and planted a heal flower and camped there with my Base Cactus, after my iron maidens were destroyed in the garden, I blocked the way into my camping spot with Iron maidens  After my Potato mines were destroyed inside the garden, I placed a bunch if them in my camping spot, survived all waves including the boss waves (I only got the Disco Zombie and the Vampire zombie in the boss waves lol) Scared the hell out of me when the garden was about to get destroyed  Now this is where I had a hard time with, and its escaping. First I fully healed myself before killing the final boss, I got killed ALOT in this escaping part until I only had 1 self revive, planted heal flowers in this pot buuut didnt really help, got shot to death be a Football cannon :( and what I did is I didn't used my LAST self revive right away, Since it was almost time before Crazy dave arrives, so I waited for the timer to reach 10 sec before I used my ONE and ONLY self revive, jumped around in panic and then after some time Crazy Dave FINALLY arrived, only had almost 10 health but escaped haha."

PvZGardenWarfare,3d8crc,orangemofo,3,Sun Jul 19 03:02:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the plants were designed to defend and the zombies to attack. That is why they are vastly different. Have you ever seen a group of plants try to attack the zombies? The outcome is the garden gets over run fairly quick. They were meant to hold up around the garden and prevent the zombies from capturing.   With that said a good chomper or pea can move out towards the zombies and wreck havoc if you are good enough. I do it all the time if I notice we have a big enough group defending the garden.   GW2 is going to balance the game so plants can attack, but that is mainly because now the plants will HAVE to attack.   I also don't understand your statement about micro-transactions? I have never bought a thing and have every unlock you can get. The only thing micro-transactions are good for is buying coins for cosmetics or zombie/planted pots. I have so many of those now I couldn't imagine having to buy coins.   You have only seen a trailer though and already bashing the sequel.

PvZGardenWarfare,3cqv61,PickingPixel,5,Fri Jul 10 01:19:57 2015 UTC,"Really enjoyed those reading up those little bits of guides written up and shared around recently about variants like the Citrus Cactus, Hockey Star and etc., they also prompted me to try out the less popular characters and there is some joy to that.  Messing about with all the variants from time to time is always fun. However, if the objective is being lost or the team on either side is being steamrollered, it makes sense to switch back to a slightly more effective variant to bring back a little bit of balance. After all, losing all the time and too easily isn't too much fun if it happens too often."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqv61,whurlwinds,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that guide on the citrus cactus is good.  It is not a weak variant."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqv61,IronCatFish,4,Fri Jul 10 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"Most variants are strong enough on their own, the less popular ones are usually a kind of niche variant that are not weak like you said, but are definitely more situational types to use for various reasons. They're less likely to excel in all-rounded aspects (esp 1v1) but can succeed if played correctly in favourable circumstances."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqv61,whurlwinds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:36:43 2015 UTC,its not weak but nowhere near as good as the stock cactus full power

I like to play around with less popular variants (Archaeologist, Law Pea, Hockey Star, etc.) unless I notice that we our gardens are getting taken quickly or we time is running out to get one, I might switch to one of my stronger variants."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqv61,Executionator,5,Sat Jul 11 22:49:10 2015 UTC,I've been experimenting too lately as I've lost a bit of passion for this game of late and have found a new love for all these mediocre characters I'd forgotten about. Been having a really fun time and I highly recommend stepping outside your comfort zone once in a while and trying some of these characters.

PvZGardenWarfare,3cqcj5,nwilloughby,5,Thu Jul 9 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"I think a simple fix would be to lose all (or a set amount) of your coins after a switch. If you switch at the start to be with a friend, no real harm but switching late to exploit would cost you big time."

It was a very small room but a close game the entire time so everytime I checked the leaderboard, he switched from one team to the other... just so he could be on the winning team. I messaged him to stick to 1 team and he left."

PvZGardenWarfare,3cqcj5,Propofolkills,3,Fri Jul 10 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"This is actually beneficial to the player, if theres like 10 seconds to the clock and you know 100% that you are going to lose, you could suicide-switch teams to get bonus coins. Theres literally no reason not to do this.   What this game needs is team balancing, shit sucks when theres 6 zombies and just 1 plant."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqcj5,RWQFSFASXC,4,Thu Jul 9 23:26:53 2015 UTC,This would work also my main problem is what you said the teams are never balanced and it is an onslaught for the first few gardens then the plants finally catch up to equal the zombie players.
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqcj5,BeyondDream8176,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I notice often that when I first join a server, you get rolled over and spat out for the first few rounds before things begin to equalise out. In fairness, I'm not sure if this an issue that can be easily solved. If you attempt team balancing without addressing the ability to switch sides, it won't work. I cannot see a logic in having the ability to switch sides."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqcj5,boolerex,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:42:42 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel, I was playing Team Vanquish and this one guy kept switching to zombies at the start of the game, we have all done it at some point, so I just stayed on plants and taunted his ass! He was playing stock foot soldier so it was more than easy."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cqcj5,Calaisix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:50:16 2015 UTC,I'll regularly switch at the beginning of a match because I like getting in the groove on one character. But mid-way switching annoys the brains out of me

PvZGardenWarfare,3cq11l,RWQFSFASXC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:12:16 2015 UTC,Team vanquish is definitely my favorite mode. But they really need to increase the coin count.
PvZGardenWarfare,3cq11l,PyroSpark,2,Fri Jul 10 06:51:21 2015 UTC,"I think a good way would be to give a large payout for playing a game from start to end. Maybe 5000 coins, along with coins earned and win bonus."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cq11l,PyroSpark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:02:39 2015 UTC,5000 would be perfect. And really fair based on how you wrack up coins in Gardens and graveyards.

PvZGardenWarfare,3cnbge,Music2th08,5,Thu Jul 9 06:09:33 2015 UTC,with the zombies i can have a laid back game and still own. with the plants i need to be on the edge and on point.  can play astronaut or super commando from a distance and chill  if i play a pea shooter i need to be right in there up front and i feel weaker in general.  basically it all comes from the fact there is one side attacking and one side defending.  you cant really chill while being on the defending side. but if you are looking for a challenge then its better to play as a plant
PvZGardenWarfare,3cnbge,Eladtzvi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:01 2015 UTC,Camo Cactus has the same feel as what u described :)

PvZGardenWarfare,3cnbge,evocative_sound,2,Thu Jul 9 16:52:11 2015 UTC,Plants have more unique classes and varients thats why i love them.
PvZGardenWarfare,3cnbge,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"Not unique, per se, but i feel like the traditional roles of shooters (assault, ambush/melee, sniper, and healer) are more clear-cut. Like peashooter is clearly assault, chomper is clearly ambush/melee, etc. etc. But for the zombies, the scientist blurs the line between assault and healer. I don't like the blurring of classes, I think they should be clearly defined. Thus, I prefer plants"
PvZGardenWarfare,3cnbge,TouchTheInfinite,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:15:19 2015 UTC,"i play as both, and enjoy both equally yet for different reasons. honestly i try not to pay attention to my character, as hard as that is being 3rd person, so they all just feel like different weapons. it sounds strange, but in my mind i envision myself running around taking pictures with a camera. sorry at an (8) right now lol."

PvZGardenWarfare,3cpeo8,demonlark27,2,Thu Jul 9 18:34:11 2015 UTC,This makes no sense because generally both teams earn a similar amount for a win/loss. This would make being on the losing team more beneficial. They just need to reward boasts on both sides period.
PvZGardenWarfare,3cpeo8,TouchTheInfinite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"I've made this suggestion before, but I agree.  There should be coins awarded PERIOD for players who achieve boasts.  Otherwise, they are just icons on the leaderboard.    250 coins per boast. 1000+ more for all boast."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cpeo8,IronCatFish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:09:49 2015 UTC,As you say - the risk i sthat people start team switching in the last minute to abuse the system - otherwise I think its a great idea. :)
PvZGardenWarfare,3cpeo8,Mumpi87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:10:48 2015 UTC,I like your idea of getting extra coins for boasts but I'm still not sure why the losing team should get them over the winning team. Most of the boasts are dependent on what you do rather than how your team does (you could argue assist master but meh...) so it seems like it shouldn't matter if you are on the winning or losing team.

Especially when it was a jump of only a few seconds; the first few times I thought the video was skipping bits. Your commentary is decent, and not annoying like a lot of streamers, so I think it would be more enjoyable if you just left the video as a whole game. Otherwise, if it's necessary to edit down, maybe try a compilation of great kills or funny moments, rather than weird skips that disrupt the flow of gameplay.   Still, thanks for sharing. I've been using Sunflower a lot more lately (Shadow flower ftw!) and am really enjoying playing a support role but still raking up the kills. I think some players will underestimate her at times and focus on killing ""stronger"" plants, which lets you sneak in and grab the kill."

PvZGardenWarfare,3cjjry,TheCarlos76,3,Wed Jul 8 12:14:39 2015 UTC,"Intro  Well, the most common way is that sharkbite shores thing but here's how to do it on any map, any class, SOLO.  The key to winning SOLO is how you place your reinforcements. They are vital, you must think very carefully about where you place them.  Where to place your plants  You need at least one flower pot as your ""designated heal-flower pot"" Make sure it's out f the way in a safe place. Also, if you're in a serious need of health in a boss battle, keep certain pots empty, reserved for heal flowers so they don't die before you can use them.  Have at least two of the flower pots near the garden as either Fume-Shrooms or Snap-dragons. If the pot is close to the garden use a snap dragon for more damage, if the pot's sorta far use a Fume-Shroom because it's range is a bit longer. These two plants will easily take out coffin zombies around your garden.  For your front line fighters I suggest using laser beans, Why? They have a high DPS and can penetrate armour.  Get creative! Think about what plants would be more effective is each pot. You can even have other plants assist another plant or ""cover"" it. Just be smart and don't only plant bamboo shoots.  Self revives/Team retrys  These are by far the most valuable things you have and should only be used if absolutely necessary. If you go down, maybe consider waiting to lose and using a team retry, why? Self revives are vital to your victory and should only be used as a last resort.  Don't forget about your garden!  Please remember to defend your garden, Make it top priorty. You may forget to protect it while running away from a boss. Clear out the zombies whenever you get a chance.  Escaping  Now, depending on how you played the match, this can be the part that makes or breaks you. If you have all your self revives it should be easy! Now, what you should do is not move to the evac zone straight away, but instead camp with your surviving potted plants until about 40-50 seconds remains. When you are moving in you'll probably go down on the way so make sure to be careful and kill as many zombies as you can when covered by your remaining plants.  When you arrive you should always plant a heal-flower, you can also make barricades as Cactus to increase your chances of survival, good luck!"
PvZGardenWarfare,3cjjry,Krook1235,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:43:25 2015 UTC,"I beat crazy mode on Sharkbite Shores. Use the garden on the left, as it has this high land you can hyper up to so you can shoot at enemies from below. Also, use the toxic pea or fire pea. For the potted plants, look up a tutorial. I used a video I found on youtube for my potted plants and it worked out pretty well, but I can't find it.

PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,iWizardBeats,8,Thu Jul 9 03:26:51 2015 UTC,"I really don't see a problem with the leveling up/coins/unlocking process. Yes, it takes time. It's supposed to. It's what keeps players in the game.  I have just about everything unlocked and haven't spent anything other than the price to own the game. All I am missing is a few more packs for Legends of the Lawn and majority of the Bling pack items.  And are you really bringing up greed about being able to purchase coins when ALL of the DLC since the game has launched has been FREE?  Military shooters are getting stale and this was a fun refreshing change. Badsters and try hards are in every game, it's not something exclusive to this game.  The game doesn't suck, it's just not what you want it to be."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,imawin,-12,Thu Jul 9 03:48:55 2015 UTC,"I think you might be a bit naive. If you think the time to level is reasonable, or that it doesn't directly correspond with the paid aspect, you're blind my friend. The dlc BARELY helps flesh the game out, a title which was originally, and still is, lacking in meaningful content. This is a 60 dollar game, mind you, that feels like an arcade title in scope. The game is a welcome change of pace, but it wears quickky, the offering, while vibrant and kind of funny,  is flimsy and without any real substance. At a different pricepoint, or had the title released as free to play ( this game took minimal effort to develop ) then I might be inclined to agree. As for the player base, yes I wish the matchmaking system was decent. Players are soooooo bad, such a simple game and even basic, familiar objective game types go way over their heads. Thats a lot of my, if you can call it this, frustration. Just terrible players, games are horribly one sided as a result. I honestly feel like EVERY game should have a playlist called the kiddy pool. Below a certain stat threshold, you're FORCED to remain in this playlist. Every other matchmaking system I've encountered that attempts to keep things balanced just fails miserably."

PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,Danger-Cl0se,5,Thu Jul 9 05:15:19 2015 UTC,Where the hell did you buy it for $60? Either you're mistaken or someone seriously ripped you off. It's at $20-$25 for all systems at most stores. the only time it hits the $40 max is if you buy the Next gen version digitally from the PS/XB Store. Not to mention the DLC is free and coins are easy to earn making purchasing them unnecessary.  They even have the prices by retailer at the bottom
PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,imawin,2,Thu Jul 9 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"I think you might be a bit naive. If you think the time to level is reasonable   It doesn't take long at all. You only need to get each class to level 10 and open the 'full character' packs until you have all the characters. This can easily be done in a couple weeks if you are actively playing the game.   This is a 60 dollar game   At no point in time was this a $60 game. When it launched, it was $40 on X1 and $30 on X360.  And the game has been out over a year. Most games don't hold people this long.

PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,MrRafikki,3,Fri Jul 10 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"This is probably one of the least greedy games out there. EVERYTHING has been free since launch. While I'm not the biggest fan of the leveling system (mainly because I stick to one character for each side) it's nice to have a game that's just not an ""oh, you've played for fucking ever, now you're max level"" type of game. It's still a change of pace. Plus this game was cheap when I got it like 8 months ago. So that was nice. The skip challenges are nice too, because sometimes there's just shit I don't want to do or rarely get the chance to do. Oh, also, this was one of the ONLY splitscreen games for xbox one when it came out. That was a huge plus for me and my wife. Overall, I have rather enjoyed the game but if you're going to compare it to AAA titles such as battlefield 4(also my goto game), it's probably not for you"
PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,whurlwinds,2,Thu Jul 9 04:20:47 2015 UTC,"Have your rant my friend, then go play something else that you actually enjoy. You state your opinion as though they are factual, but they're just one opinion in a sea of others and you're the overwhelming minority here.   Not everyone here wants to play competitive mainstream either and you're free to do so if you so wish.  However, it is not your right to degrade anyone who enjoys a slightly more casual game that has it's own competitive aspects in it's own right.  If a game is pricey, you're not forced to pay for it. If a game is something you do not enjoy, you're not compelled to play it.   Have your rant and go enjoy your time doing something else."

Also while you can buy coins, the rate you get currency is fair.  When I play Gardens and Graveyards you can get on average 10-30k coins, sometimes a bit more.  They didn't gimp the amount of coins you get to force you to buy coins which is awesome since a lot of games such like Dragon Age Inquisition give you coins at a snails pace to get you to spend real money.  PvZ GW is probably the most fair game when it comes to handling this.  Oh and free DLC to boot =<3  It's not everyone's cup of tea, but as long as the game is fun that's all the matters."

You can easily get most stuff in the game without playing extra in a decent amount of time. Plus the pay for real money thingy is heavy under-priced for what you can get in-game anyway  You can't really fix a playerbase too. Not the best I have saw but not the worst either.

PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,Krook1235,-2,Tue Jul 14 08:40:06 2015 UTC,"This game is kinda garbage compared to other games in the same genre. It's filled with unbalances, bugs and it's an overall a waste of potential.  But when you look at it, it's a game for more casual players. There's no real skill needed, just something you can sit down and relax with; God-like players in this game, are mediocre players in other games. It's believably unbalanced and I can't play a full game session without encountering several bugs, and the worst part? It's going to stay that way.  This game had horrible support. Hardly any patches, so many bugs left unattended, still horribly balanced. The devs just gave us the game and said ""see ya"" and left it broken. They gave us ""community challenges"" to give us the illusion that they were still active and cared about their community.  The game was very overpriced, it wasn't worth it's original asking price of $60 (Even more for Australians). Looking at the first game I'm also kind of deterred from getting the sequel, why? Who's to say the bugs in that game will be fixed? What if it's still incredibly balanced? Will we get essential features the first game was missing or will it just be ""Copy paste the first game, better graphics, add more maps, more classes done!""?  But as I said, It's not meant to be a serious game, it's for more casual players who just want to sit down and relax. IMO if the game was around $30 at launch I'd be 100% okay with how broken it was. If you want me to pay around $70 for the sequel it better be balanced and have better support from the devs."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,TouchTheInfinite,3,Thu Jul 9 08:01:38 2015 UTC,"Garden Warfare wasn't $60 at launch. I don't see any major unbalances and rarely come across game-breaking bugs. And they supported the game for free with new content, balancing and some bug fixing. That's great for a $20-$30 price tag. With the sequel being more expensive I would only expect more content, polishing and support. And what's wrong with having a game which targets casual players?"
PvZGardenWarfare,3cmv1f,Propofolkills,-1,Thu Jul 9 09:20:08 2015 UTC,"I never said it's a bad thing that the game target casual players. I said it was a game you can sit down and relax with.  The game was $60 for me so maybe it's a country thing, I guess cause I'm Australian I pay more but it was not $30.  You said you rarely encounter game breaking bugs? Encountering a game breaking bug, ever! Is unacceptable. Active devs would swiftly remove such bugs.  As the the unbalances. Most players don't realize them because they're just hopping in and playing for 15 mins without much experience in any balanced shooters, not giving it a second thought when that one guy playing super commando gets 80 kills.  I wasn't calling this game garbage in general, I was calling it bad compared to other games in the same genre. It's not given much attention for a reason."

PvZGardenWarfare,3cd8gg,Weltall548,5,Tue Jul 7 00:25:12 2015 UTC,The Berry shooter has the most splash damage and high impact damage but fires slowly but the Fire and Toxic Pea do DoT. The Plasma Pea can fire quickly or charge a powerful shot.
PvZGardenWarfare,3cd8gg,Danger-Cl0se,3,Tue Jul 7 02:08:10 2015 UTC,The answer would be toxic pea
PvZGardenWarfare,3cd8gg,DemoEvolved,2,Tue Jul 7 01:48:50 2015 UTC,"They all have different attributes, but for ease of use I recomend the Toxic Pea. You can fire at all the zombies feet while you jump all over the place. Shooting into a zombie occupied garden is very effective. Also, you can damage enemies behind cover with the slpash damage or by jumping and shooting over the cover. So really, the toxic pea is a little more for  defensive combat and getting tons of assists for your team."
PvZGardenWarfare,3cd8gg,orangemofo,2,Tue Jul 7 04:15:56 2015 UTC,Stick with the fire pea or use the standard pea.  Or you could use...toxic pea but it really just depends on how good your aim is.

If im not wrong, i think thats all, i think potted plants and summoned zombies can do crits under certain conditions,"
PvZGardenWarfare,3c98qc,TheCarlos76,3,Mon Jul 6 02:25:35 2015 UTC,"Headshot. That's why some characters like chompers and sunflowers are at a disadvantage, they have larger heads. Compared to their body"
PvZGardenWarfare,3c98qc,CQCnotBLT,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:26:20 2015 UTC,Headshot or direct hit with a char with a splash attack (expect citrus cactus ; which have splash damage but still need to headshot for a attack to count as a crit)
PvZGardenWarfare,3c98qc,boolerex,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:50:03 2015 UTC,Thanks guys. Googling it got me no hard answers!
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,whurlwinds,2,Sun Jul 5 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"that list might be how the guy who made it feels but i cant agree with plenty of things in there.  Astronaut way down there its a great character can get wild streaks  good firing speed ammo amount and damage from all ranges. can heal himself and others.. warp, recently i play him more then super commando because its more strategic and interesting.   Jade Cactus is also better then that place in the list  and law pea should be in the top tier group  if you can put your crosshair on your target law pea can take guys out in under a second unloading 6 shots.  either way all characters have their roles in a match  a better list would place characters in groups bases on main role/purpose.. a group of aggressive front line pure damage, super commando law pea..a group consisting of second line characters that should play behind the first line or a bit sneaky via flanking.. such as Astronaut..and various Engineers..i would also place jade cactus in this second line, not in front of the battle but behind the main fight or flanking.  and then a third group of characters behind those first two like Camo Ranger..and various cacti.  and even within a class you will have some variants in different groups.. jade cactus second line vs other third line cacti   or some Engineers that can be played as the first line of attack better then other Engineers   that list combined with info about clip size speed between shots  reload time damage output on various types of impact, direct, headshot..splash impact such a list would be interesting. i for one never got to see something like that and plenty of the characters are a mystery to me still.  you cant really put all the characters into one list and choose the best while each plays a different role in the match.  you could maybe pick the best variant in a group after sorting every character into groups like described.  either way a good player could own with just about any variant"
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,mantissteam,2,Sun Jul 5 21:57:17 2015 UTC,Hes a high risk high reward character and the playstyle needed to be successful with him doesnt fit mine at all. I also hate not being able to destroy cactus drones when im in the foot soldier class.   Its like he fires 1 of the rockets from the mini rocket and has to reload slowly after every shot. Hes great if you go up on roof tops like the first garden on the Sunflower G&G map. You can get lots of splash damage in that garden. But you are easily spotted when you start shooting and you cant take out multiple plants shooting at your from different angles. If you miss one shot its kinda like you're done. I prefer the camo ranger if i wanna snipe as a foot soldier. No splash but hes much more forgiving!
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,ExOTiC1234,2,Mon Jul 6 00:18:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed that the play style has to be a fit, no issues with that at all.   However, the idea that he's only good or meant to be used as a character who needs to be perched high up to use his splash damage is one that undersells his ability though.   There was recently some guides and even videos of how the Citrus Cactus should be used, now that's a character that blossoms if they are perched on higher ground because the splash damage is their actual reward and specific skill set.   If you can't snipe a drone, don't. Otherwise, get into a sheltered area and if the drone follows, use the explosion or splash damage to get rid of it.   Now, if you prefer to be a solder variant who remains on roof tops to get their shots off, then obviously you'll choose a different type. That's just about it.  Just think he is slightly under-represented because the usual flaws are highlighted constantly as reasons not to use when, he may just not have been used right or played to his strengths."
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,TouchTheInfinite,2,Mon Jul 6 00:39:19 2015 UTC,"Nice video man. Im kinda jealous of your consistency at knocking peashooters out of the air with tank commander, any tips? Just wait for them to reach the highest point? Out of curiosity whats your accuracy? Where do you keep your sensitivity set? Thanks."
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,TouchTheInfinite,2,Mon Jul 6 13:42:39 2015 UTC,"The airshots are some times hit and miss so I definitely don't hit them as consistently as you may think I do. It's nice when you get them, especially with the Tank Commander, so I get them on record.   With the TC, I like to get up close and get an accurate shot on the target, even if you miss you'll get the 20 splash and usually have the time to get another shot away. Jumping right before you take your shot also helps with avoiding hits and having that small window of time to adjust your aim to get it off accurately. It's easier to hit accurately when the target is directly in front, when approaching at angled directions just slightly lead your shots a little in anticipation of where your target is heading.  I don't really consider them tips, but if you're looking to knock targets in the air then anticipation is probably key and a good sensitivity level that you're comfortable with. My sensitivity bar fills up to somewhere in the middle, counted it backwards and it's around 15.   Peas usually hyper and jump around whenever you engage them, I just try to follow their trajectory and it can be a lot easier to hit them when they're in the scope right above your own character. It's a lot of trial and error until you get a good feel for it and become more consistent at it as you attempt it more often. Here's my stat page, accuracy is 39%.  I never thought it was even possible to knock an opponent out of the air with the TC until I saw a video from a PvZ opponent who is now my friend and I just picked it up from him. Here's an example of his airshot1, airshot2, airshot3, airshot4, he's a lot more consistent with it than I am.   Feel free to browse his XboxDvr page, x muumuu x if you're keen on those kind of stuff.   Thanks for the compliment and I hope it helps somehow."
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,Calaisix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:15:32 2015 UTC,"Our sensitivity as nearly identical then. So are our accuracy stats, I believe mine is 38. Gonna have to practice with tank commander later, those shots really stood out in the vid."
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,Cristian888,2,Mon Jul 6 23:37:23 2015 UTC,"Hi Whurlwinds, I have nothing to add but just wanted to say hello, we roll through the same lobbies and I have competed with/against you on many occasions resulting in many a death. Your a fantastic skilful player and it's nice to see you on the Sub/forum. Keep up the good work... Calaisix"
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,IronCatFish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:26:08 2015 UTC,"Hey Calaisix! I've seen you around these parts for a long time now, but I wasn't much of an active commenter so just lurked.   I've had plenty of deaths resulting from your sneaky Camo Cactus and picked up useful tips of locations from where to hide as the Camo Cactus (or hunt them sneaky players down), so thanks for that!"
PvZGardenWarfare,3c7vd2,boolerex,2,Thu Jul 9 04:53:34 2015 UTC,"That would be my list and it's based on my 200 hours or so of playing the game. I've played the Tank Commander a ton and he is simply bad at getting kills. From far it's almost impossible to get direct hits since the ammo travels pretty slowly that by the time it reaches the target the plant likely moved. From close its easier to get kills, but you're just asking to get eaten by a Chomper if you're that aggressive with him cuz you still need minimum 3 direct hits to take down a Chomper at full health. Tank Commander is pretty good at clearing gardens of Potato Mines and Spike Weeds, so perhaps I could've ranked him higher based on him having decent value to a zombies team, but overall, he gets outclassed by other Foot Soldier variants IMO."
