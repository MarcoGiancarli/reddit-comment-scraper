chicagofire,3e3cz4,Mr_Tomfoolery,5,Tue Jul 21 17:26:47 2015 UTC,DONE!
chicagofire,3e3cz4,oscaradrianzen,8,Tue Jul 21 17:49:46 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, I'm starting to get excited, concerns be damned"
chicagofire,3e3cz4,jkure2,7,Tue Jul 21 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one not excited about this? I feel more comfortable expressing this here than on /r/mls or /r/soccer - I do not like this signing, and I think this is the final hail mary that seriously puts us at the bottom of the table for the rest of the season.  He's 37 (38 in March), a striker who won't do a full 90, and slow. He's certainly ""smarter than the average bear,"" he's an incredibly smart player. But wouldn't you guys rather have a Giovinco than a Drogba?"
chicagofire,3e3cz4,futbolnico,10,Tue Jul 21 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Not only are we getting the chance to watch a legend if he comes, but the Fire lead the league in chances created and are near the bottom in goals scored. If he can still clinically finish (and he's at a high enough level that Chelsea played him last year) then he's worth it."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,AquaPigeon,5,Tue Jul 21 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"I would much rather have a Giovinco than a Drogba, but I'd rather have a Drogba than a Maloney. I agree with harry below me that I'd rather have Chicharitto. He would fit in with Chicago and the Latino population. Man U has stated they are not selling him anymore. We need someone to score up front, right now. Drogba can do that. He is physical and this is a physical league. His name can draw fans and help grow the brand. He can open up the door for future signings."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,Mr_Tomfoolery,6,Tue Jul 21 18:30:51 2015 UTC,I think the last sentence there is big. We question why the big names go to other places. Is it because they already have had big names? Well part of that is that we haven't had a big name for a while. If he enjoys the club he could become a path to other players in the future.
chicagofire,3e3cz4,Gostaverling,4,Tue Jul 21 19:02:43 2015 UTC,We're not going to pay for a Giovinco. Drogba is better than Iggy and we are near the top in chances created. Our finishing is what sucks right now.
chicagofire,3e3cz4,xjimbojonesx,4,Tue Jul 21 19:02:57 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie, my idolization overpowers my logic on this one. Drogba has been my favorite for years."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,LudwigWittJr,3,Tue Jul 21 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"I'm biased because I'm a huge CFC fan, so I'd love nothing more from him to come here.  But also he is a finisher that can score those chances when we need them most.  Regardless of his age, he's the kind of smart player we need to play and coach our other strikers."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,McCheetah,2,Wed Jul 22 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"I'm just 'meh' on this signing, or at least the drama associated with it. If we get him, 'great!' we have a player that might bring a few extra hundred fans a match out to the games and potentially win us a few games this year. If we don't get him 'great!', we need defensive help more than anything and we can target someone else or just chalk this year up as a rebuilding year (again) and go after someone in the offseason.   I'd definitely rather have Chicharito, personally, but since there's no chance of us getting Giovinco I can't really put myself in a position to compare that signing to Drogba's."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,harrylee773,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"considering I would have loved a player like Luca Toni to come to the fire (old as shit and still banging in goals like they're nobody's business) I'm ok with a Drogba signing. This is a player who will put himself in the right place at the right time, and put the ball in the net. That's exactly what we need. A straight up target man."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,xwint3rxmut3x,2,Tue Jul 21 23:33:53 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't you guys rather have a Giovinco than a Drogba?   Of course, I'd rather have a Giovinco!! No question! I really wanted Chicharito to come here.   But that's the problem. Giovinco isn't going to come to Chicago. Chicharito isn't going to come to Chicago. If you know of a player, that is as good as Giovinco and is interesting in coming out to this shit show, then by all means, let's recruit him. But for at least a season or two, Drogba could be a massive boost for the team. It won't make us a contender for the MLS title, but it gives us, the fans, some excitement and someone that could bring us hope. It also give casual fans a big name to rally behind and join the crusade. If nothing else, it will be a boost until the end of the season. Then in the off-season, we drop Iggy and go out on a search again for our Giovinco."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,Lomotograph,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:53:42 2015 UTC,"On the pitch, anyone would take Giovinco over Drogba. Off the pitch, Giovinco makes way more money, which he earns through play and not through name recognition. When we had Blanco there were a ton of Blanco haters. The second he left people were demanding the next Blanco be signed. Drogba is that signing. Maloney is the poor man's Giovinco."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,Pharaca,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:42 2015 UTC,I'm back and forth on it. I think this seasons pretty much toast so Drogba is at least a spectacle.
chicagofire,3e3cz4,pokerjoker23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"At this point I just want a guy that can finish. We miss way too many easy chances. His fit in the lineup remains to be seen, but I think it'll be a good signing. At least it's something, and something exciting."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,pantstofry,0,Tue Jul 21 23:33:19 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, mostly. The only way this signing makes sense to me is if there's another signing coming involving a bona-fide center back.   If we're leaking goals week after week then Drogba doesn't do us any good. For me, this is simply a move to sell tickets and it'll work. We'll still be an unwatchable mess, but at least you get to watch a legend."
chicagofire,3e3cz4,f4nt,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"Drogba has his good and bad parts, like any other player...what I'm most concerned with is having world class talent arrive, but still coached by Yallop.  I don't dislike Yallop, and know he's got challenges to face, but is he really still the guy to coach a striker like Drogba?"
chicagofire,3e34l8,Johhnyfingers28,7,Tue Jul 21 16:22:43 2015 UTC,Jeff Crandall said that they must be confident they're going to get Drogba otherwise Atul wouldn't have been tweeting that stuff out.
chicagofire,3e34l8,xjimbojonesx,3,Tue Jul 21 16:32:10 2015 UTC,That's my take as well. And now the twitter account is speaking French? Good news incoming.
chicagofire,3e34l8,Ahesterd,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:33 2015 UTC,It seems odd that they are addressing this head on after Yallop has been so close to the chest about the situation
chicagofire,3e34l8,imjustbuzzed,6,Tue Jul 21 17:07:36 2015 UTC,Atul also said that they usually don't comment on potential signings but since Joey Saputo came out with that radio interview last night they made a comment about it.
chicagofire,3e34l8,xjimbojonesx,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"That's my thinking. They probably wouldn't have said anything about it, but since Saputo made a statement, then he forced them to respond in kind."

It would make more sense if he were president, but oh wait.  Beyond all that, you have to love how the Fire remain reactive to all situations. They can never be up front about anything and only do things like this when they feel they have to. Another product of not having a President looking out for ALL THINGS in Chicago.  Andy is your President folks. He had a chance to speak to media the other day and declined, as he has for well over a year."

I think it would be cool if they worked in a basic skyline into the stitching, the kind where you could only see it from very close or feel it. But I know nothing about designing a jersey.  That being said, I think if you don't like the 5th, I think the only real choices for me are 3 and 4. The first two are fine, just a bit bland imo, I like having the stars."

chicagofire,3dyyts,king_zog,9,Mon Jul 20 23:09:56 2015 UTC,"I don't need to think it. MLS's statistics tracking proves it.  http://fantasy.mlssoccer.com/a/statistics  Let's take a look at the top 20 under the Key Passes category.    Rank Player Team Key Passes    1 Morales RSL 55   2 Maidana PHI 51   3 Felipe NYR 47   4 Higua√≠n CLB 46   5 Nagbe POR 45   6 P√©rez Garc√≠a SJ 44   7 Morales VAN 44   8 Feilhaber SKC 43   9 Shipp CHI 42   10 Giovinco TOR 37   11 Davis HOU 36   12 Powers COL 35   13 D√≠az DAL 35   14 Rosales VAN 34   15 Kljestan NYR 33   16 Kaka ORL 33   17 Maloney CHI 32   18 Piatti MTL 31   19 Villa NYC 31   20 Pappa SEA 31    In this list we can clearly see that only three teams appear in the top 20 twice: New York Red Bulls, Chicago Fire, and Vancouver Whitecaps. Harry Shipp is ranked #9 in key passes, while Maloney is ranked #17.  MLS defines ""Key Passes"" as any pass that resulted in its first touch being a shot on target. This means that, in general, our midfield is better than most of the league when it comes to creating basic chances in terms of shots on goal.  Now let's look at the overall MLS stats and see how the team as a whole ranks.  We can see from this that when it comes to shots on goal, the Fire are ranked 8th overall, one shot behind the LA Galaxy. We have had 89 shots on goal. If we look at the other two teams that have had more than one player in the top 20 for Key Passes, we can see that Vancouver (#2 on this list) has 104 shots on goal, and Red Bulls (#4) have 98 shots on goal.  Still not convinced that we have a comparable number of chances created compared to the top half of the league? Let's take a look at blind shots taken. Chicago Fire sit at #4 on this list with 273 shots taken. Vancouver sits in #3 with 289 shots, and Red Bulls sit in #5 with 269 shots taken.  Need more? Fine, let's look at FOX's breakdown of each team's Corner Kick attempts and see how we stack up. Chicago Fire rank #8 with 108 corner kicks this season. Red Bulls are #5 with 111, while Vancouver is #10 with 105.  No matter which stats you use to break it down, the Chicago Fire are consistently in the top half to third of the league when it comes to creating chances. In fact, the only statistics that set us apart from the Whitecaps and Red Bulls (continuing to use them as examples) are goals scored and goals conceded.  We AVERAGE 15 shots per game, and 0.22 shots on goal per game. THAT is the problem. We dominate the league when it comes to getting the ball down the field and shooting. If our guys knew how to finish or put the ball on target, we might actually win, and Harry Shipp would be sitting at around 20 or so assists right now.  To put that into perspective, Morales and Maidana are sitting at 7 and 9 assists on the season, respectively. Shipp is sitting at 5 despite creating 10-15 less key passes than each of the other guys so far this season.  So no, I don't need to think it, the statistics and reality prove it for me.  Edit: added number of key passes to the table."

Either way I think it pretty much expresses the frustration.

chicagofire,3dzq75,Jingr,3,Tue Jul 21 02:44:50 2015 UTC,"It's because since then he's been marked like crazy, especially with Accam gone for as long as he was there was no other real threat on the field."
chicagofire,3dzq75,Jingr,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"Ehh, even in space he's looked off. Bad passes, bad runs, loses the ball, crosses to no one.   I think we all, team included, put a lot of pressure on him to be the central playmaker, and he's just not there yet."

Unfortunately, teams know this now and close him down quickly. He typically has 2 or more defenders on him when he has the ball. Unlike, Nyarko and Accam he does not have speed.

The ref has two choices in that situation: call the penalty, or call the simulation. Also in that situation, either is worth a yellow. Simulation is almost always a yellow, and a 1-on-1 foul where all Johnson has to do is turn and shoot is also a yellow.   The issue for me is with his first. THAT was the soft yellow. The ref put himself in a shitty position bully giving a super soft yellow to Johnson earlier. Now Johnson is sitting on an undeserved first yellow (imo) and gets sent off for a dive.   It's tricky, and obviously I'm not upset at the result. I definitely think the yellow for the dive was deserved, but it shouldn't have been his second yellow."

The offside is a split second play and it could be called or jot depending on when the AR considers the ball being touched.   The second goal, there is contact, but not enough IMO to disallow a goal. Letter of the law? Yeah each I ally a foul, albeit a very very soft one. That, and way worse contact gets waved on like nothing happened multiple times every single game.

chicagofire,3dnze4,snkscore,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"My only thing is they play different positions, Lampard would be feeding the ball to his forwards whereas Drogba is chasing and trying to outrun defenders. Both IMO are very old, but can still be an extreme asset to each team, especially here in chicago we could really use Drogba and his following."
chicagofire,3dnze4,fuq-daht,2,Sat Jul 18 12:55:18 2015 UTC,Maybe because Drogba hasn't played for a season?  EDIT: Looks like I misread the article. Shows how much I watch EPL...

More interest from people like that would be huge for our team. The more people who care about the team increases the amount of pressure on the front office to give us a winning team.
chicagofire,3dnze4,wazzzzzzzzzza,7,Fri Jul 17 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If anything, it's at least a start at getting recognizable names on the roster.

chicagofire,3dnze4,Kramgunderson,10,Fri Jul 17 22:45:36 2015 UTC,Sign drogba and Tim ream. Kennedy and adailton out. A cam gets core dp. Imagine that team for a second.

chicagofire,3dnze4,Kramgunderson,2,Sat Jul 18 00:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'd be absolutely gutted if he left, to be honest. I agree he's got the most trade value on the team (though can anyone in the league really bite on his contract right now? Not a small hit). But he's just about the only bright spot in the last several years of the club - I mean, Shipp was good last year, but he's absolutely sophomore slumping, and RotY candidate isn't the same as MVP winner. Magee seems like one of the only guys who really absolutely wants to be here."

chicagofire,3dnze4,flowlikeariver,4,Fri Jul 17 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"I totally get your point, but I kinda do care about filling up the stadium. I think it positively impacts every part of the team.  Regardless, I also happen to think finishing is one of our biggest problems. As many mistakes as our defense has made, if we had someone up top who could finish the chances we DO create, we'd be near the top of the eastern conference.  Whether or not Drogba is that guy, I honestly don't know."
