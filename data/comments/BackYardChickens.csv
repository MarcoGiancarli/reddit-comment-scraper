I had the same thing happen and I thought it was a raccoon or skunk until I saw a hawk pull a chicks head through the kennel and eat it off. Birds will also eat the eyes first, as it's the least protected source of protein.   I have cattle panels that I put over my run in the shape of an arch. And then I covered that in chicken wire. No casualties after a year."

And having it open to the top is not going to stop a raccoon either since they are quite accomplished climbers.  Possums and weasel-types are the other predators to worry about. Pulling the head off sounds like a mammal. Owls wouldn't just take the head.  And the predator will be back. Build that door ASAP, they need to be completely enclosed at night.  e: also, sorry about your bird, and sorry to come across so harsh."

BackYardChickens,3e2t3g,melligator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:33 2015 UTC,Racoons tend to take the bodies. I have heard weasels will eat the head and leave the body because the head is the only part they like.
BackYardChickens,3e2r2t,I_heart_fartleks,4,Tue Jul 21 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"First, I would start with at least 3 hens. Chickens are extremely social creatures, and if something happens to one you're going to have a very lonely and eventually sick hen remaining. Most of the more docile breeds are good layers, so you'll be looking at 4-5 eggs per chicken per week when they start laying, so you'll be getting more eggs than you expect I think.    You are going in the correct direction with Buff Orpingtons, I've heard nothing but good about their temperament. My FIL has several that are the sweetest gals. However, quiet isn't exactly how I would really describe any chickens. It's not as much breed dependent as personality dependent. They're not like barking dogs by any means, but some of them develop quite the egg song, regardless of breed or disposition. So be prepared for that.    The Pacific NW challenge isn't so much a cold climate (I'm assuming you're talking coastal and not east side of the mountains?), chickens can easily deal with 20-30's F cold so long as it's not freezing their water into blocks of ice. Your challenge is going to be keeping them dry. Good ventilation in the coop with a nice dry bedding like hay, plenty of roost space, and consider covering your run at least partially to keep the mud to a minimum. You are more than good on run space it seems, assuming that 10x13' is total for your run and coop. 10 sq ft of run space per bird is considered a good minimum, so a handful of hens would be very happy there."
BackYardChickens,3e2r2t,cordial_carbonara,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"Orpingtons can be really loud, but it's quite individual basis, not a strict rule. This goes for all of the other large and daily laying breeds.  In Oregon myself. I've had  Barred Rock (quiet and great layer)  Rhode Island Red (loud as hell, egg)  Hybrid/Blackstar Sexlink (great)  Wyandotte  (great)  Americauna (cool eggs but unreliable layer)  All of these were docile and productive, but the RIR was particulary loud every egg.  Look at bantam breeds maybe, if you want quieter or have limited space."

The roo loves to be petted and tolerates cuddling better than any of my hens. The girl hasn't started laying yet, but she's the quietest pullet I've ever had when compared to the other girls at her age. I've heard they're good winter layers and take well to confinement. My birds free range, but I can tell that the Favs could handle a run if needed. I'm not sure how their feathered feet would do in cold, wet conditions though.  I definitely agree that it would be better to start with at least three hens. Even if nothing bad happened, if one hen in a pair went broody, the other would be quite lonely."

With these 4 hens (all great breeds) you will get nearly white eggs, nice tan to almost brown eggs, bluish green eggs, and DARK chocolate colored eggs (hens listed in that order gives that color egg).  If you add a Marans rooster and hatch some of the Americaunas eggs, and raise a hen from her you get the famed ""olive egger"" which will lay an egg a dark olive color.  Your variety of egg colors would be awesome! :D  Oh I should add, a good layer will give you about 6 eggs per week by herself.   With 4 good hens you should get 3-4 eggs per day, or around 2 dozen eggs per week.  Don't worry, extras can be sold VERY easily to people you know, we get ~7 eggs a day and never have trouble getting $3 a dozen for extras."

My two full-grown frizzles haven't grown feathers on their elbows back yet after the rooster was a bit rough with them. The buttercup made a mess of their crests. Haven't had an issue with smooths.  The only thing with polish that you have to watch out for is that their feathers basically block all of their ""up"" vision. My frizzles are easily surprised and are really bad at figuring out that my toes are offering them treats about 3 inches off the ground.

Overall the waterfowl tend to leave the chickens alone, although sometimes at night the Rouen drake will begin to chase the goose very aggressively in an attempt to mate, running over any birds who dare to stray into his path.  I know that some male ducks can become a problem when housed with female chickens. Because male ducks have an actual penis, whereas male chickens have only a rudimentary sex organ inside the cloaca, and for this reason male ducks can severely injure hens when attempting to mate with them. Now, not all male ducks will do this - mine doesn't, and that in particular is the reason I chose him over other ducks. I could have gotten any breed I wanted off craigslist in a heartbeat, but my best friend already had a 1+ year old male who was known to be non-aggressive to chickens, so he was brought home instead.  I have, however, heard that Muscovies tend to be more aggressive than other ducks; the males in particular. I suggest you keep a close eye on the situation - if you begin to see any mounting behavior, the best idea is to rehome him, as there isn't really any way to curb that kind of thing."

BackYardChickens,3e0fkb,Grimsterr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:06 2015 UTC,"Unfertilized eggs are completely eatable, just don't let the eggs go uncollected in the summer heat for too many days, they can start to develop resulting in a small fetus in your egg when you crack it and a spot of blood.  Just be sure to collect eggs at least daily, if not twice a day and this should never be an issue."
BackYardChickens,3e0fkb,OceanPizza,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yes unfertilized eggs are definitely fine to eat, but if one has a pair then wouldn't the eggs be fertilized? Wondering why one would keep a pair for this reason."

We're collecting another dozen now to eat but if the hatch rate is low we might throw more in the incubator too."
BackYardChickens,3dy12v,Flatfooting,5,Mon Jul 20 13:45:13 2015 UTC,Could be any of those things mentioned. I would take measures against all of those possible sources.

Her but looks almost exactly like the one in the picture of the beginning stages of being egg bound, but the messed up feathers continue up her chest. I'm hoping this is just from lying on it to much. I fed her water with oyster shells ground up in it but she vomited it up almost immediately. My roommate went in her vent but couldn't feel anything. I just have her a bunch of water with oyster shells and I'm going to try to give her a bit more time to digest it, but any extra advice is more than welcome."

BackYardChickens,3dz22t,groovinit,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:04 2015 UTC,I had a problem with rats earlier this year. Buy a cheap game camera and you'll easily find out who's the culprit.
BackYardChickens,3dz22t,jfastman,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"Set a mousetrap or two with peanutbutter just outside the coop overnight, just to rule out little critters. You'd be surprised how much food a family of wee mice can haul and horde away. Get a beefy trap or a havahart cage if you think it might be squirrels or something larger than field mice.   If you're curious, can setup a webcam. An old cellphone, a laptop or usb camera could work, or buy a real gamecam or an IP/wifi camera for like $50 -which can be set to motion-detect, and many models have IR for night view. Different models either store photos on a microSD card, or sync/send photos and realtime video to a phone, pc or web service."

The issue has stopped. The trap is always set in case something else finds that opening."

BackYardChickens,3dvrsn,NeverMyCakeDay,10,Mon Jul 20 06:13:44 2015 UTC,How much does a chicken x ray cost.  How did they hold her down.  What happened.  So many questions tell us they story of this.
BackYardChickens,3dvrsn,rockherder,6,Mon Jul 20 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"Short story = too much! $185 to be precise.   Longer story: I inherited this flock of grown ass chickens last September, not knowing much about them at all. I was told they were all about three years old at that time, so 4ish now. Quickly became enamoured of the lot of them and then proceeded to learn how fickle their health can be. I lost two to predators, two to egg yolk peritonitis, and one to a mysterious blood disorder all just since September. Aside from the partially eaten incidents, I took all the hens to the vet. What does a person do in those situations? It's been a bunch of money and I'm not exactly rolling in it, but do I just sit and let them be miserable and for sure die or see if they can be helped? I'm learning that chickens get sick and then shit all happens fast. Each time by the time the vet is indicated, it's been too late, but I feel like I took them on and it's my job to see what I can do for them. I don't know, what does everyone else do? How do you decide to euthanise your own animals you're attached to, and do it yourself?   I'm new to ""livestock"" and I really like my chickens.  Anyways in the case of Mina, above, I'd been mulling over taking her in anyway. All the chickens, when I got them, were pretty mangy looking. I was told they were moulting, and some got better but some did not. I imagine it is just pecking but Mina in particular always pained me to look at. Wednesday night I saw she had a pronounced limp, and when it hadn't improved the next day I made an appt. for her for Friday and isolated her in a dog crate within their coop, with all the chicken amenities she needed. Vet couldn't feel anything broken and I opted for the x-ray to be sure. Nothing broken, but the cool pic you see above. I had already asked if they could give her some chicken valium or something as she is not a huge fan of being handled and her day had already been kinda major. I guess they doped her just enough to get the shots. They sent me home with an anti-imflammatory and recommendation of confinement for her limp, and some clavamox to treat what pecks had got a little unhappy over time.     So there you go. She's being a champ about her meds but a little more time is needed to see if the limp clears up. I need to find a way to get them in her without me doing it orally, I feel like the steps forward with the meds are negated by how upset it makes her in some way. I'm kind of at a loss of what I will do if she doesn't improve.  Edit: also I spent all of Friday at the vet with Mina, all of Friday night treating the symptoms of what seemed like egg binding in one of my buffs, Beatrice, who has a problem with soft shells (well, had) only to find no egg up in there and her worse by far in the morning. I was back in the vet Saturday for euthanasia for her. Shitty weekend, really."

BackYardChickens,3dwrm0,kayakyakr,6,Mon Jul 20 04:45:11 2015 UTC,Because of the poop.  I didn't correct this in my first set of birds and I had to clean the nesting box so much because of the poop.
BackYardChickens,3dwrm0,Aerron,3,Mon Jul 20 11:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'd have no problem locking them out, but I think they are on the verge of finally starting to lay eggs.  They have had access to the nest boxes for a while, but just started even paying attention to them in the last week.  The funny thing is that I was worried that they would be too small for one chicken, let alone all 4 of them piling into one nest box."
BackYardChickens,3dwrm0,Aerron,5,Mon Jul 20 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"A ""nest egg"" is an old trick to get them to start laying in the box.  A golf ball works fine.  Even an old plastic easter egg filled with sand (and taped up) could work in a pinch.    Oh, and they will all use the same box.  We've had as many as 15 birds, and they line up waiting to use the same box, regardless of  how many other boxes are empty."
BackYardChickens,3dwrm0,Aerron,3,Mon Jul 20 12:00:04 2015 UTC,"That's good to know!  They crack me up.  I need to take my camera out next time I put them to bed.  It's funny to see them all stuffed in one box.  I've got a couple of fake eggs in there to try and give them the idea.  I figure when they are ready, they'll start laying.  They got perfectly good roosts to roost on, so hopefully it's just a phase they are going through."
BackYardChickens,3dwrm0,jfastman,3,Mon Jul 20 13:42:31 2015 UTC,I've had to resort to blocking the nesting box off to keep them out of it at night.  Good luck.

BackYardChickens,3dwe92,Elsey21,3,Mon Jul 20 02:21:30 2015 UTC,When my dog had a cyst in her eye it looked like that. The white dot was the cyst. Try to protect that eye from further damage so maybe make a makeshift high collar. A warm wash cloth would probably make it feel better and clean it. CAREFULLY. Be very aware that she may very well loose her eye.

BackYardChickens,3durld,cupreous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:16 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that train them to start eating their own egg shells?

BackYardChickens,3durld,Pukako,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:52 2015 UTC,Exactly. If you crush them up they aren't recognizable to the chicken as an egg shell.

BackYardChickens,3dv01o,HeraldOf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... it does sound a bit like broody behavior. Is she always laying in the nest on eggs, or just laying wherever she happens to be? We've found that usually when a chicken gets sick she won't lay down, but will stand in a corner of the coop or run with a droopy tail and head down. If she were really sick I don't think she'd have the energy to run away from you when you try to pick her up. I would wait until nightfall when it's easier to capture her, and then check her out, it could be a leg injury making it hard for her to stand. If she's really broody she'll be sleeping on the nest at night."
BackYardChickens,3dv01o,ImaginAcres,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:30 2015 UTC,"Day 2 and her behaviour is exactly the same. She isn't on the nest all day and is still eating. I think we can rule out broodiness now. The only real difference is that instead of standing around eating all day, she is sitting around eating. She does move around occasionally, and got up when I came in from work to get some food from me, but always seems to be looking for a place to rest.   I am starting to wonder if she has hurt her leg. Her steps are very tentative and she's normally so assertive. Also, one of the others dug a big hole in their run, and I'm concerned she may have fallen into it and hurt herself!"
BackYardChickens,3dv01o,ImaginAcres,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"Yes that does sound very much like a leg injury. I would check it out tonight, see if the leg feels warm, or swollen, or anything out of place. It can be so hard to figure out what's wrong with chickens because they don't show signs of illness or injury until things get really bad, and then you have to play detective to figure out what's wrong!"
BackYardChickens,3dv01o,ImaginAcres,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"She doesn't like being handled at all, but I'll try to get her tonight after they go indoors to roost. The legs look OK when she stands up, but as you said, hard to say what's wrong!  If it is a leg injury, what do you recommend I do next? Should she be separated and rested, or do I keep her with the flock to do her thing until she's better?"
BackYardChickens,3dv01o,ImaginAcres,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"If the other hens aren't picking on her I'd just let her stay with them, from our experience hens being in the group can help them to heal quicker, but that's just me.

BackYardChickens,3dr0oc,not_whiney,24,Mon Jul 20 01:39:00 2015 UTC,I used to live on a lot of land and would let my chickens out in the field while I watched them. One day one got a mouse and of course all the chickens wanted the mouse.   My hen with the mouse took off and the others followed in hot pursuit. One of the bigger hens got it off her. But it continued like this for like 10 minutes - One would manage to take it and run and then everyone would follow that chicken.   It was like watching a morbid soccer match.

BackYardChickens,3dsezb,PM_ME_UR_CHICKENS,3,Sun Jul 19 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"That's totally normal. Some birds, and some particular breeds, have feathers which come in patchy. I currently have 16 week old gamefowl who only just lost these bare patches 2 weeks back. I also have a few very young chicks who are half naked. Unless you start to see evidence of picking (blood, scabs, feathers broken at the base) I wouldn't be worried at all."

I know our pheasant chicks got little bare spots on their back for a bit when they were feathering out and they're fine. I can't remember other chicks having them right off but that doesn't mean they didn't."

BackYardChickens,3do40s,Fertile_Taco,18,Fri Jul 17 21:19:40 2015 UTC,Use the floating egg trick to determine freshness. Fill up a large bowl with lukewarm water and put an egg in. If it sinks to the bottom it's okay to eat. If it's bobbing it's questionable. If it's floating then toss 'em.
BackYardChickens,3do40s,UnfinishedProjects,3,Fri Jul 17 21:32:50 2015 UTC,I had never heard of this before. Thank you for the advice!
BackYardChickens,3do40s,UnfinishedProjects,3,Fri Jul 17 22:31:38 2015 UTC,No problem! Did you do it already? How were they?
BackYardChickens,3do40s,crystaleya,3,Sat Jul 18 01:23:40 2015 UTC,Yeah. I made French toast. They all suck right to the bottom and looked/smelled fine when I cracked them.
BackYardChickens,3do40s,olearlearlear,8,Sat Jul 18 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"Do the float test as the other poster suggested. There are 3 possibilities that immediately jump to mind. 1. They are 6 months expired and your food pantry is horrible at rotating goods. 2. The eggs are donated from a backyard keeper or small farm that reuses old cartons to save money. 3. My store gives all its salvage to the local food pantry but almost everything is frozen first-eggs, dairy, and produce aren't, but all meats, bakery goods etc are frozen and kept that way to prolong their useable time. In eggs that would cause the shell to crack from the expanding pressure, so I doubt it."
BackYardChickens,3do40s,WomanWhoWeaves,5,Fri Jul 17 23:47:19 2015 UTC,"Is the carton stamped, or are the eggs stamped?  I reuse old egg cartons that people save for me, so the dates on my cartons are meaningless.  I date each individual egg with a pencil."

BackYardChickens,3dmqt1,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:31:44 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard to tell by appearance until they get older. Usually if it starts strutting it's a male, they could begin to strut anytime between 1 day old and a couple months old. If it gobbles it's almost definitely a male, females that gobble are quite rare IIRC.  I have an 8-10 week old right now who just started strutting and gobbling, however he was definitely encouraged by my older ones so I don't know if a lone turkey will take longer to show."

You may need to crate him and keep him warm, in a quiet and shaded place, with plenty of good food and water.   Nutradrench or other vitamins would be good to try and snap him back into getting better.  13 years is incredible. That is beyond the normal life expectancy, and it may simply be his time.

BackYardChickens,3dkfax,jrwreno,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:03:03 2015 UTC,Thanks that appears to be the culprit. Is it recommended I vaccinate the whole flock? Just the affected ones? From what I read it should clear up in a few weeks.

Only thing that's come up was the chicks being unable to get back into their nest and were huddling in the corner.  I ended up clearing their path and scooping them back to their mom."

BackYardChickens,3dk9cd,omgmypony,7,Sat Jul 18 12:27:09 2015 UTC,"Are they running loose? Go out at dusk and wait to see where they roost. Dark is the easiest time to catch birds.  Otherwise x2 on the net.  The best way to kill a bird is by bleeding out or breaking the neck.  Bantams may not be particularly meaty and roosters don't have the best flavor, but I recommend dressing them anyways - if you stick 'em in a pot and boil the hell out of 'em for 5 hours, you'll have some great chicken stew meat."
BackYardChickens,3dk9cd,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:27:27 2015 UTC,I've never heard of roosters and hens tasting different. Is there some reason for that?
BackYardChickens,3dk9cd,poorsoi,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, the hormones in a rooster will make him very tough and gamey by the time he reaches around 6-7 months, and he'll be roughly comparable to an old boot by the time he reaches a year old. This is why roosters are usually not eaten, except by those few who enjoy who flavor and know how cook them correctly to make them tender, or unless they are caponized."
BackYardChickens,3dk9cd,GallusLafayetti,5,Fri Jul 17 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"Listen, it sounds/looks brutal but the quickest way to kill a chicken that isn't blasting it with a shotgun is with an ax. Put two nails in a stump/table just wide enough to fit the neck and hold the head. Stretch out the neck and give it one good whack with your ax. Instant decapitation kills the chicken as quick as possible."
BackYardChickens,3dk9cd,IFeelLikeBasedGod,3,Fri Jul 17 04:58:23 2015 UTC,OP I'm gonna have to agree with /u/GallusLafayetti! I've run my share of chickens down on foot out of necessity. For example when one was injured etc. The best way to catch them if you don't have to lay hands on them immediately is at dusk/dark. If they are roosting in a hen house block up the exits and go in with a flashlight and pick them out. SO much easier!

BackYardChickens,3dk6w1,Jechira,4,Thu Jul 16 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"Netting. You can get outdoor netting on Amazon, or other sites. It's cheaper than a proper roof, will keep the chickens in, and deter hawks as well.  If you need to go really ghetto for a short term fix, get a big spool of twine or string (butcher's twine would be a good start), and run it back and forth across the top of the fence, forming a loose net. It can be at fairly random angles, and should have lots of points where the lines intersect. Done right it will form a crude net that will deter the chickens, and also help deter hawks (who won't attempt it if they can't fit their wingspan through)."
BackYardChickens,3dk6w1,on_a_moose,5,Fri Jul 17 01:23:06 2015 UTC,"How high is your fence? Anything lower than 5 feet (in some cases 6) they will jump simply because they can.  The old idea that chickens can't fly is a wives tail. Most chickens can jump a healthy 5 feet, light bantams can fly 10-20 feet with ease. One of the best fliers of chickendom, the Sumatra, has been purported to fly over 5 miles, on prevailing winds, from their place of origin, the island of Sumatra, to the neighboring island of Java.  Escaping can be fixed by either wing-clipping or replacing the fence with a taller one. If you wing clip, you should only clip 1 wing. If you clip 2 they will still be able to jump quite well."
BackYardChickens,3dk6w1,GallusLafayetti,5,Fri Jul 17 03:42:15 2015 UTC,You could try clipping the wings. That's what I did with my parakeet however I know chickens are larger. I'd be free anyway and I bet there's a YouTube video out there. Good luck!

Honestly I'm pretty new at this chicken thing myself but I have heard of people clipping chickens wings so they can't fly-jump. Bring meal worms to make friends maybe? Bribes can't hurt anyway.
BackYardChickens,3dk6w1,ollitotter,4,Thu Jul 16 23:33:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple handling chickens at night. Someone to help would be beneficial. They can still jump a 4 foot fence easily. They like to hop up on top of the fence if its solid, then hop down.   You can find netting on Amazon around $50. Doesn't keep predators out, but keeps birds in. Or share eggs with the neighbors. Just a couple ideas."
BackYardChickens,3dk6w1,Grimsterr,4,Fri Jul 17 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"At night is fine, clip only ONE wing, it unbalances them and they quit trying.  Even a short jump sucks with one clipped wing."

BackYardChickens,3dk6w1,davidwebb_uk,5,Fri Jul 17 04:31:07 2015 UTC,Clip only one wing. Then they won't be able to fly straight and they'll stop trying. Only do the feathers at the end of the wing and do it at night when they're passive.

BackYardChickens,3dhxvl,corinthian_llama,7,Thu Jul 16 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"Small backyard flocks pose a very high risk because of their close quarters with people [source].

BackYardChickens,3dhxvl,voldemortoutbitches,2,Thu Jul 16 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"Typically, they don't. But chicks coming from large hatcheries with less than stellar testing policies are making their way to feed store bins. This is why it's important to know where your animals are coming from. Fully grown chickens are also typically symptomatic when infected, so backyard owners are more likely to notice.    That being said, the people getting infected are probably simply not washing their hands after handling baby birds. Salmonella is usually transmitted to humans in three ways. Fecal-oral route, undercooked eggs from a sick bird, or undercooked meat from a sick bird."

Chickens naturally carry the bacteria....and regularly carrying your chickens about, having some contact with clean, healthy birds....should enable a healthy person to develop a natural immunity to the disease over time.  Allowing your birds to crap all over your house, lawn, or places you frequent often...and not cleaning it up sufficiently, increases outbreak risk.   People should have regular contact with their flock, they also need to keep their birds clean and healthy with responsible practices. I believe a lot of these incidents come from inexperienced or irresponsible people, or the purchase of birds with high concentrations of salmonella due to an irresponsible Seller...."

BackYardChickens,3djg6n,jrwreno,2,Sat Jul 18 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"Warning! Rant ahead!  These posts about snuggling with chickens being the reason behind the CDC report and statement.... I will say it, it pisses me off. It makes it seem that hobby-chicken ownership is a health-liability due to simply holding/snuggling your chickens. It also makes it seem that ALL chickens always carry Salmonella, even when that is not the case!  No! ANY chicken ownership and handling, whether commercially or residentially....is a potential health-risk IF you care for or handle your poultry in a repulsive and irresponsible manner....the same being said of buying birds from repulsive and irresponsible Sellers, or buying chicken meat or eggs from unsanitary and irresponsible Farmers/Grocers...  The majority of Salmonella infections from contact with live-birds is due to the same reason people get Salmonella infections from food or products.....irresponsible and unsanitary conditions.  Healthy and well cared for chickens normally do NOT carry Salmonella, or they do at very low and very safe levels.   Even ones that carry Salmonella at very low levels can be very safe, if the bird has a diverse gut flora and healthy diet from foraging on fresh greens and insects, plenty of clean food and water not contaminated by vermin, plenty of space to live in so the fecal matter is not concentrated, plenty of sun and exercise....you know, the basic Living Rights that Nature affords to all living creatures.  if you practice unsanitary habits and allow chickens to contaminate your house or living area considerably, your chances of getting sick increase. Holding a healthy chicken and snuggling it normally carries very little risk of getting sick, as long as you use common sense. Do not french kiss your chickens. Chicken vents should be considered the same as Human assholes. Do not mud-wrestle in your chicken run as a past time, do not gargle in puddles they walk in.....  The same is said of commercial operations! Poultry meat and eggs, if raised and harvested responsibly and safely.....carries very little risk of being contaminated with high levels of Salmonella. In fact, there have been tests that show commercial chickens and eggs carry dangerous levels of Salmonella due to their living conditions and the repulsive practices of the Commercial Operation...this is before the chickens are butchered and the meat and eggs are sanitized in caustic chemicals for shipment.   Small operations like Polyface Farms have proven that with responsible husbandry... even culling and butchering your chickens in the outdoor air, without using caustic chemicals or preservation....is far safer than a commercial butchering factory. The tests done on their stations and product showed incredibly low levels of bacteria compared to what was typically allowed for large commercial farms to sell to the consumer.   If people neglect their chickens in the same manner as commercial operations, then yes, they increase their chances of facilitating a Salmonella illness. If people are abnormally unhygenic, and allow their chickens to contaminate living spaces or food preparation areas, they increase the chances of illness. If they spend the afternoon bare hand-poking a sick and dirty hens vent for a broken egg, and immediately grab a danish to eat without washing up.....they may get sick.  But most importantly.....a chickens quality of life and how well they are cared for determines whether they would even transmit Salmonella to begin with. I personally have handled my chickens barehanded, with poop or chicken litter smearing my hands or arms or clothing. I have been deeply scratched by flailing hens or jerk roosters dirty dirty feet. I have had muddy chicken water splashed into my face or mouth while I was putting straw down on a rainy day, or emptying water jugs to clean out. Sometimes, I do not get to the sink to clean up for hours, because I go right to the garden or some other chore.   I do not wash my eggs unless they need to be damp-wiped due to poop or broken eggs. I do not refrigerate my eggs ever. I cull my chickens out in the Bee garden on a log, using a hatchet and my Kershaw knife only. I clean and butcher my chickens in my sink with just hot water for feather dunking, then hot water for rinsing. I do not use any caustic chemicals, preservatives, pressurized steam, etc. And yet, miraculously, despite using no sanitary protocols the commercial industry uses....none of my family has ever been sick."

BackYardChickens,3dfk6e,GallusLafayetti,8,Wed Jul 15 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"I currently have a Faverolles rooster that is my favorite of all the chickens I've owned. Every time I go outside, he runs to greet me, quietly chatters at me and waits patiently to be petted. He tries to offer me food and is the most gentle and experessive of all the birds I own. If I didn't have the most tolerant neighbors ever (and a rooster collar that keeps his crowing at a lower volume than the ducks), I would be desperately searching for someone to caponize him so that I could keep him.  I'm betting that most of your customers would be city-dwellers that are accustomed to the idea of pets that don't produce anything, so I think you're right that most people wouldn't have a problem keeping a ""freeloader"". If anything, I think you'd have a harder time selling a surgery without anesthetic to squeamish city folk, but considering the alternative facing most roosters, caponizing starts to seem a bit better. I'm betting most people simply don't know caponizing is possible at all, so it wouldn't hurt to ask some of your customers if it was a service they would consider."
BackYardChickens,3dfk6e,chestypocket,3,Thu Jul 16 01:24:42 2015 UTC,"I've definitely thought about the issues regarding the lack of anesthetic. While I do use ice and a numbing mint-gel designed for horses prior to the procedure, it's still certainly a painful process - but not as painful as some might think. The only really upsetting thing seems to be the plucking, and the single cut - which only last 5 minutes and around 10 seconds, respectively. They don't seem to feel anything going on internally, and once I finish and let them up they immediately begin walking, eating, drinking, etc. The next day they were up and about.  Ideally I'll be able to explain this to them. It certainly would be worth mentioning that the guy who buys returned roosters who don't find pet homes within a couple weeks, has them caponized anyways and raises them for meat to sell in Asian markets down in the state capitol... basically they'll be going through it either way, but only one has a happy ending.  And I also am thinking that any roosters who would be caponized preemptively for the purpose of sale as pets (probably only a few every month or two, since capons as pets are ultimately a novelty and don't have huge demand) would be popular ornamental breeds, e.g. Silkies, d'Uccles, OEGS, Sultans. People are buying these birds for pets, not laying, anyways, so I have to imagine they would be quite open to buying a male bird who has the characteristics of a sweet hen, but the long, beautiful feathers that even the prettiest of hens lack."
BackYardChickens,3dfk6e,voldemortoutbitches,5,Thu Jul 16 06:44:17 2015 UTC,"I loved my dear roosters so much and it broke my heart to give them away (even though they went to a humane home where they will live long happy lives). Though I know little about it, the idea of caponization makes me nervous, as does any procedure done on an animal... buuuut it does seem like a better alternative considering how many roosters are killed or have no safe home to go to. All in all, when I think about it I wish this option was more widely available for pet chicken owners- it could change the lives of so many beloved roosters. Anyways, I feel like there needs to be more education/awareness on the process because I had never even heard of it until I found this subreddit."
BackYardChickens,3dfk6e,voldemortoutbitches,3,Thu Jul 16 02:53:37 2015 UTC,"Great to hear.  I agree, it's considered by some - myself included - a lost art. It was quite popular in the 1850s-1950s or so, albeit for it's use in meat endeavors, but fell out of favor when the modern Cornish Rock broiler was created. It was never popular for use on pet fowl, but then again it's only recently that chickens were considered pets; prior to that they were either livestock or show animals.  It definitely has its risks. While I so far have had 100% success, 3 roosters is not at all a big sampling of fowl. I think I'll have an even better grasp on the subject when I do the other 5 this Friday.  Obviously no one's perfect, and if I continue doing this for the foreseeable future, I'm eventually going to lose one - it's simply inevitable. However, from what I understand, bleed outs are uncommon, even for beginners. So ideally the success rate will be quite high, and I'll be able to determine exactly how high after I've done more roosters. And once the bird is off the table and closed up, I've heard the recovery rate is damn near 100%. In fact, so far I haven't heard a single story of someone losing a capon post-surgery.  The other issue is that for some there may be welfare concerns from some people. While the surgery is, if you think about it, not horribly painful, it's still surgery done on a conscious animal, so I can see why there would be complaints from some people. So far I have been doing my best to prevent pain - icing the wound for 20 minutes beforehand, and applying a pepper/spearmint oil analgesic gel designed for sore muscles on horses (but it works on anything with skin, I got it on my hand once and it tingled/was numb for an hour). Overall, the surgery isn't as painful as it sounds - the thing that seemed to bother the bird the most was plucking, about 30 feathers in total, on the side beneath the wing - it takes about 5 minutes and they squawk about it quite a bit. The icing they also seemed to dislike, but overall settle into pretty easily. The cut itself they definitely felt, and I'm sure it stung quite a bit, but overall that was the worst of the pain - the cut takes about 10 seconds to make. It's only about 1 inch long, and the rib spreaders are then used to widen it to about 1/2 inch wide for the length of the surgery; it closes back up most of the way once they are removed. And they didn't seem to be able to feel anything going on inside the body cavity - they didn't react at all the the slotted spoon, forceps, etc. touching their various insides and removing the testes, and I'm guessing that they can't feel anything internal since I'm not doing any kind of major cutting in there, just 2-3 very thin mucus membranes which I don't believe have any kind of nerves in them at all. And after I was done, I let the skin slide back in place to cover the wound, released their ties, and they stood right up. They were drinking and eating 5 minutes later, and walking around happily the next day. 2 days later, the incision area is already completely scabbed over and healing very well. The only issue I've encountered post surgery is a small bit of wind-puffing, which is pretty common after caponization. Basically, the skin puffs up, because there's air beneath it. Mild ones are supposed to be left untreated and will go away on their own, and larger ones are solved really easily - just a small prick to the skin with a needle or something similar, and the air will deflate. As I understand it, even if a bigger one goes untreated, it's never fatal - just kind of uncomfortable for the bird until it goes away.  Overall, there is pain, but it's definitely a better experience than going to the stew pot. And besides, when it comes to roosters that are brought back to my workplace under our guarantee, we do our best to find them good homes - but, ultimately, if a boy doesn't find a home within a couple weeks, we call our friend Alex up to come get them - and he actually caponizes them anyways, just not for pet reasons. :(  I definitely am excited to get more experience, and will probably open up services sometime next summer, if everything goes as planned. Not only will I be able to help people to keep their beloved roosters, if I charge a small sum for each bird (probably around $20-$30) I'll be able to make a little extra cash to supplement my regular job."
BackYardChickens,3dfk6e,omgmypony,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:29:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah for me the most uncomfortable thing about it is just that I worry the animal would be in pain, but as you said, it's a better fate than ending up on the dinner table.

BackYardChickens,3dfk6e,acdev,4,Fri Jul 17 21:05:37 2015 UTC,I actually own some capons (did them myself for meat) and ended up getting attached to one so I'm keeping him. Selling a caponize service for these accidental Roos seems good and a lot of people would do it probably (has to be pretty cheap though usually) but I wouldn't go out and buy a capon on purpose unless it's for meat
BackYardChickens,3dfk6e,Washcloth_Smuggler,3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:44 2015 UTC,"Ideally I'll be charging around $20 dollars per bird since most people will have just one rooster they want done, but $30 for the ones aged 4-6 months because they are supposedly more difficult. And I'm possibly thinking $40/hour if they have many birds they want caponized (for meat and such).  Yeah, I do recognize that the capons are ultimately useless, since they would mostly be egg breeds. But my target market would be those keeping for pets, whom wouldn't mind having a pretty bird even if it didn't produce eggs. They wouldn't be expensive either, we sell the roosters for $10 and pullets for $14-$18, so the capons would probably be around $15, not a bad price for a pretty bird."

I think the above post really hit on an emerging market among people like my wife and me, i.e. city people who keep backyard chickens as a hobby and who treat their chickens as pets. We'd totally keep a capon as a pet. You really do get attached to the birds, and the alternative -- trying to find a home, but more likely the bird ending up as dinner -- is tough and a little sad.   Having a capon would be just like having an older chicken who stopped laying due to age. We already plan to let our hens live out their retirement with free room and board anyway."

It's actually not that hard to do, logistically, you just have to have the stomach for it - serious stomach. I thought, having raised and processed meat birds for 2 years and having also done things such as super-glue sew and clean wounds on my birds, I would be ready for it. But full-on surgery is very different, even if it's doing the bird a huge favor in the long run.  However, I did teach myself, since I couldn't find anyone in the area willing to teach me. I ordered the Nasco caponizing kit, which is overall good, although the rib spreaders were of cheap quality and needed to be modified a little to work properly.  I just kind of cleared up an afternoon, starved the birds beforehand, and went right in. Bird #1, there was bleeding, fumbling, and it was a success - he lived- but not a clean success, if you get what I'm saying. But by bird #3, there was significantly less bleeding and fumbling - when a bird is depending on you to cause it the minimal amount of pain possible, you learn quickly. Or at least I did."

BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,indychickens,2,Tue Jul 14 05:40:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to be sharing the chick perspective, but I've always gone the pullet route.  I had a few personal reasons for doing this, but here's a few quick hits why you might want to consider it.  I do want to go the chick route one day, and will when my youngest is a little older.  1) A pullet is almost laying age.  You'll get the payoff sooner than later.  2) You don't have the extra care and set-up younger chickens need.  3) Just a more direct route to getting hens in your coop making you fresh eggs!"
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,Aplos9,2,Tue Jul 14 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"What are things I will forget that are vital to a coop?     Easy to clean, easy to feed/water, ventilated, and weather resistance?  Depends on your climate, here we have hot summers, and not that cold, or not cold for long winters so ventilation and SHADE are a must.    Is there a particular feed that will work best for the chickens?     Everyone has their brand, I buy whatever's cheapest, I feed about 50/50 scratch to laying feed, with days where they get almost nothing but layer feed, if they're getting plenty of outside (free-range) time.    Certain breed that will suit us best? (Aiming for three-ish chickens and live in the Indianapolis area)     Docile and good egg layers, I recently got some Golden Buffs and they're quickly becoming my preferred egg laying chicken.  Jumbo eggs, very easy mannered almost friendly hens and not very aggressive to the other birds.  I'd avoid ""game"" or bantam varieties and go for the big softies, dominiques, leghorns, orpingtons, americauna, Marans, etc.    Health things to look for?     It's usually easy to tell, they just won't act right.  With only 3 or 4 chickens you'll likely notice anything pretty quick.    Special treats for the chickens outside of the feed?     Bugs!  Mealworms and crickets are easy to get.  Watermelon rinds are another favorite, stale bread, most anything really.    How can you go about selling the eggs?     My wife posts on her FB page when we have a couple extra dozen, they're usually gone within the hour.    Advantage to starting with baby chickens or older chickens?     Babies: you know the age, you have a bigger hand in the friendliness of the chicken since you can handle as little or as much as you want.  Grown: eggs NOW, but you can never be certain of age because every hen I've ever bought ""just started laying""."
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,Grimsterr,2,Wed Jul 15 17:30:34 2015 UTC,"I feed about 50/50 scratch to laying feed   I'm not 100% sure on this but I'm pretty sure you're meant to only feed them layer feed, with scratch or corn only as a treat. From what I know it is not good for chickens at all and they should just get a few handfuls scattered on the ground rather than put in their feeder."
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,MelonHeadSeb,2,Wed Jul 15 23:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah google seems to agree, gonna cut way back on the scratch."
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,Grimsterr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the beautiful world of having your own chickens, and being one step closer to being self sufficient when the zombies attack! 1. Vital to the coop - large doors so it's easy to clean out / adequate roosting space and diameter of roosting stick / proper ventilation for both summer and winter. 2. I honestly feed my chickens cheap feed from TSC, about 15 bucks for 50 pounds of food. Obviously if you're getting baby chicks you want to start with the appropriate food - higher % protein and gradually bring that down until they are about to lay, and switch to a layer feed with added calcium. I'm currently on my grower feed, and in about a week I will switch to the layer feed. I will also have a separate dish with oyster shells for added calcium if the hens feel it's necessary (never mix that with your feed, keep it seperate). 3. I love my RIR - they are great egg producers, and you being from in Indianapolis, you suffer from the same winters as I do, and they thrive in colder conditions as long as they are dry. 4. Make sure they are properly gaining weight, make sure they don't develop any sores on their feet, make sure their droppings are fairly solid, and if you raise chicks together, you shouldn't run into any issues with fighting, and injuries. 5. I have an all organic scratch that I give them. I also give them bread, any greens from my garden, pineapple, watermelon, I also hang cabbage and lettuce from a rope, and they love to peck at that. Periodically I also place worms from my garden in the coop. 6. I have plenty of co-workers that are excited for eggs. I just have them give me egg cartons, and I will sell them in the office for about 3 bucks a dozen. 6. I loved starting with baby chicks for two main reasons: they won't fight and they have grown attached to me.  Also - I built my chicken coop from tearing apart old pallets, and in total spent about 150 bucks for an 8'x4' coop, and a 8'x6'x4' run.   For watering I bought a 3 gallon bucket, drilled 5 holes in the bottom, and installed nipples. It's the easiest, and cleanest way to water them, and not have to worry about it for days. Come winter, I will continue to leave the water out of the coop, and place an aquarium heater inside to keep the water from freezing.  Hope this helps!"
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,bendingmarlin69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"This is the feed when my chicks were very little  I then moved down to the 20% protein to grow them, then the 16% once they started laying. Cheap, and my chicks are very healthy."
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,bendingmarlin69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"1) Ventilation is too often overlooked. I use doors and windows with hardware cloth and outside options to close it in when it gets cold. Also, think about cleaning. Something I did with my coop that has worked fantastically is putting down linoleum on the coop floor, so it's super easy to wash out when needed. Also, space. The general rule of thumb is 3-4 sq ft of coop space and 10 sq ft of outdoor run space, minimum. And you'll always want more chickens, so build big now so you're not in a bind later when those cute feed store chicks start haunting your dreams next spring!    2) Feed can be anything from cheap bulk feed from whatever supply store you have to organic. It's completely up to you as to what you want to spend, honestly, just make sure you're using the correct nutritional steps for each stage of life (starter/grower/laying). I use Dumor from Tractor Supply and my chickens are just as healthy as they were last year when I had them on organic.    3) My Pet Chicken has a neat chicken breed selector. I like to have a diverse flock of whatever breeds are suitable for my climate. You'll want something that is winter-hardy, but other than that it's really about what you want in egg laying and personality.    4) I've not had any health problems with my chickens, they're generally very healthy animals. Just keep an eye out for any open wounds or birds that act lethargic.    5) My girls get kitchen scraps. The Backyard Chickens website has a page on what's good for them and what's unsafe. They can eat most anything and love it!    6) Depends on where you live. If you're only wanting 3 birds, you probably won't be selling many eggs. I have 13 laying hens right now and sell about 10 dozen every other week at my local farmer's market. Before that, I just gave away eggs to friends and family (mostly my mom as penance for babysitting my kids!).    7) I prefer to start with babies. They're really quite easy and so much fun to watch grow! If you can wait a few months for eggs, I definitely recommend it. Some people like to rescue battery chickens, but if you go that route be prepared to deal with any health problems. Others don't like to spend money on a brooder setup or waste money feeding chicks that aren't laying yet. A brooder setup for just a handful of chicks can be as simple as a cardboard box and a heat lamp.    Have fun and remember that there's really no right or wrong way to get started with your chickens! Just make sure they have enough space, water, and food, and go from there. Learning as you go is pretty easy with chickens!"
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:46 2015 UTC,Linoleum is a great idea. I did that as well. Easiest cleaning in all the land.
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,bendingmarlin69,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:02:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's been said already,  but get all your chickens from the same place. That way there is less of a chance that they will infect each other with harmful diseases that they are not used to."
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,Brosephjrrexaurs421,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"A good coop needs roosts, nest boxes, and adequate ventilation. It should either be a coop big enough to walk into for easy cleaning, or a small coop with trays. I also like to have a small shelf or cabinet on either the inside or outside of the coop to keep supplies in, which will need to be designed so the chickens can't roost or jump on it. Chickens need a medicated starter 0-8 weeks, a grower 8-16 weeks, and a layer from then on. Big name brands (Purina, TSC brand, Walmart brand) typically suck. I recommend looking into whichever high-quality options are carried at your feed store; smaller brands are usually better, as are ones which offer organic or non-GMO options. I recommend Barred Rocks, Sex Links, Delawares, Wyandottes, Orpingtons, Ameraucanas, Dominiques, and similar breeds to beginners. Barred Rocks in particular I consider the #1 beginner breed. I wrote up a wiki on all the common breeds, which is linked to in the side bar under ""Breeds"". However, if it gets quite cold where you live, I also recommend purchasing a breed with a small comb. Look up chicken comb types; breeds with combs such as rose, walnut, or pea (e.g. the Wyandotte, Dominique, or Ameraucana) will not experience frostbitten combs like birds with large combs will. A healthy bird will be active, have a bright pink or red comb (depending on age), have fluff clear of any pasting or droppings, and have clear eyes, nose, and mouth. The feathers should be clean and shiny. A sick bird will appear droopy, ruffled, have poor color, and may exhibit vent pasting. However, birds who have in the past experienced an illness and recovered may become carriers - not exhibiting symptoms of the illness, but still contagious. This is why any birds brought in from an untrusted source (a hatchery being an example of a trusted source, whereas craigslist or a local fair would be untrusted) need to be quarantined for 2-6 weeks with a ""canary"" (a bird you are not attached to, who will become infected if the new bird is in fact a carrier of something - the canary in the coal mine) prior to introduction to a flock. Treats should make up about 10% of chicken's diets. No more than 15% or they will not eat their feed and become nutritionally imbalanced. Treats include dried mealworms and scratch feed, which are sold at feed stores. It also includes table scraps, such as bruised fruits, old veggies, stale cereals, and similar items. Chickens should not have onions, citrus, raw potatoes (cooked are fine), avocado, chocolate, anything extremely greasy/fatty, or anything moldy/rotten. I work at a poultry specialty store, where we sell both chicks and 8 week old pullets, so I have quite a bit of insight into this. Overall, the pullets are our best sellers, because they are closer to the point of lay, hardier, require no heat, and ready to go outside immediately. The only advantage chicks have is that raising them is a fun experience - but it is also a hassle."
BackYardChickens,3d7z8o,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"I think most questions have been answered really well already but here are some things I wanted to add:  1) The coop is the ""house"" part where they will sleep and lay eggs, and the run is the larger, fenced off bit where they spend their time in the day. Use hardware cloth and not chicken wire; chicken wire is good for keeping chickens in but not for keeping predators out. If you live somewhere rainy (eg. the UK) then I'd recommend putting a roof on the run to stop it from getting all muddy and wet as the chickens will scratch all the grass away in a matter of days, leaving just dirt. This can help stop them getting infections such as bumblefoot and will be nicer for them in general.  2) Layer feed should be used once they've started laying eggs (18-20 weeks old) and provides chickens with everything they need to grow and lay eggs. They should have access to this 24/7 (no ""three meals a day"") and can be fed corn or scratch as a treat, scattered on the ground for them to scratch around for.  7) The main advantage with starting with older chickens is you can tell their gender straight away, whereas with chicks you will not know until they are older. If you only want hens, this means you will have to give the males away or perhaps kill them, so it is a bit of a gamble."

She pooped on me, the house, furniture....pretty much guarantee that there was salmonella everywhere. I have never been sick from it....  Contact with small amounts of any bacteria is beneficial for our immune systems to build up an immunity just from constant contact.  Now...I am not asking for you to cuddle-up a wet, sick bird that is fresh from a very muddy and foul-smelling chicken run.....but having constant contact with your environment, and just making sure to wash up after mucking about outside in the garden or chicken run.....that is all that is needed.  I do not believe our ancestors that had to raise chickens 100+ years ago had to deal with salmonella like WE have to....simply because where people get their poultry and eggs is incredibly unsanitary vs household hobby flocks....  Make sure you have a sanitary and reasonably clean chicken run and hen house, make sure that their food and water is clean, practice health security and keep wildlife out, and make sure sick chickens are tended to....and you should not have to deal with salmonella growing to unsafe levels. Let alone ANY human-deadly pathogen."

I've used it on open wounds several inches across (injury on my turkey hen due to the tom) and the wounds healed quickly, no infection, although plenty of scarring because of the size of the wound. The birds weren't even caged during the healing process, they were free to move around and dustbathe, yet no issue whatsoever. It's important to remember to use the type without pain medication, though. The pain medication used in Neosporin is part of the ""-cain"" classification of drugs, which are poisonous to poultry.  The only other things I would typically use on a comb injury would be anti-pick solutions, if the wound is not so severe that the bird will be separated from the flock anyways, and possibly cornstarch, if the wound is discovered while still bleeding heavily."

BackYardChickens,3d2uwd,GallusLafayetti,2,Tue Jul 14 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about sand. I haven't used it personally. From other people, I've heard mixed things. I've heard some people say it stayed very clean and was overall quite manageable. I've also heard the opposite.  I would have to guess that people with smaller flocks would have more success with it. 6-8 birds or less isn't really going to make any kind of big mess, no matter what kind of bedding you put them on. But I also can't imagine that ducks are going to be helping the situation at all - they make a mess of everything and I can imagine sand being just as bad or worse than other beddings in that respect."
BackYardChickens,3d2uwd,SchipAlong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:16:43 2015 UTC,I have 13 hens and two ducks. The main reason I started looking into alternatives was because the hens push shaving and straw out of the coop and I can't ever keep anything in it. I've read good things about sand but I'd love to hear what people say against it before I give it a go.  I'm willing to try it out for a bit to see what kind of a mess it leaves but am weary of doing anything that may be dangerous / unhealthy for my flock.
BackYardChickens,3d2uwd,SchipAlong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"I've always found shavings to be the absolute best option for bedding. I don't like to mix shavings and straw, and in fact inside the coops I avoid straw whenever possible. If straw is being used, rice is best.  With 15 birds I would be hesitant to use sand. I can't see any reason why it would be dangerous, but I feel like the mess could get very out of hand, very quickly, and they are liable to scatter it anyways.  Is there anyway you can build a lip into your coop, to prevent the bedding from being pushed out? My coop has a 2 inch lip in front of the door, which keeps the majority of it inside.  If you do try out the sand after all, I would love to hear back as to the results. Where I work we have a lot of people coming in asking about poultry bedding options, and I prefer to be as informed as possible when answering them."

I currently have the original formula made with naked oats, but I'm thinking of trying the grain free version next time since they already have oats in their grain/seed mix. Oyster shell and granite grit is offered free choice on the side and they get a lot of veggie scraps, weeds, leftover lentils/beans, and some leftover meat. Decently orange yolks, orange tinted egg whites, thick shells that take effort to crack, durable egg membranes that need to be punctured after the shell is cracked to actually get the egg apart, shiny feathers, and well pigmented legs and combs considering they're laying a egg almost every day.

Especially since it's not a complete feed per se, more one component of their complete diet and something for them to nibble on throughout the day. I think the dog food is really a key part to filling in any gaps, as well as lots of fresh plant matter and forage.  I built my recipe using what my local store has available and this feed calculator: http://www.gardenbetty.com/2014/11/garden-bettys-chicken-feed-calculator-for-determining-your-protein-content/ My recipe is... 6 cups wheat, 4 cups black oil sunflower seeds, 4 cups oats, 2 cups millet, 2 cups buckwheat, 1 cup flax, 1/2 cup brewer's yeast, and 1/4 cup kelp granules."

We also feed them some scraps as treats like the tops of strawberries, watermelon, green grapes from our vines, and earthworms we find when working in the garden. Every once in a while we give them some cooked spaghetti, I think they think it's worms, but they really like it. As far as flavor, we got some eggs from the local farmers market that were caged bird eggs on organic feed and did a side by side, our eggs are amazing and the others are just good. You can really taste the lemon balm and pepper corn. The yolks have almost a citrus zest flavor. My favorite thing to do with them is a soft boiled egg with just a pinch of salt."

They're great for prevention, but I would never trust them to eradicate an issue already established. (This is coming from someone who will always use the natural method if it's available and works. In this case, it doesn't work).  You need to powder all the birds and the coop with permethrin dust. The chicks especially; mites and lice can't hurt a healthy bird, but chicks and old or sick birds can actually become substantially weaker when infected with lice or mites.  After you've treated chemically, you can use wood ash and food-grade DE in the area where they usually dust bathe, as a preventative."

They were all over the coop, on every bird, was even finding them on myself after handling the birds. We didn't want to use chemicals so we switched the coop bedding from straw to pine/cedar shavings and dusted literally everything with food grade diatomaceous earth (DE)--the coops inside and out, every bird about every 3 days or so, and areas where they hung out and dust bathed. The mites like to hide in the cracks in wood, so I would take a brush and brush the DE into the wood grain of the coop and roosts.   Be careful, DE is safe and natural, but chickens respiratory systems are a little more touchy than you'd think. If the fine DE dust is irritating to your nose/mouth, it will be to them too.  It took us about 2 months to fully rid the birds and coop of mites without chemicals. We haven't had a problem with mites since."

In a growing egg, around 5-6 days of age you will first begin to see a black dot, surrounded by a cluster of blood vessels.

BackYardChickens,3d2exg,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jul 13 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"Guinea eggs have a different appearance than chicken eggs. The shell itself is thicker, so it appears completely clear, but in fact it's just darker so you can't see the difference between the shades of the yolk/whites and the air sac.  And store bought eggs are just pretty crappy and have been on the road for many weeks or months (and probably sat in a refrigerated warehouse somewhere for a good long time too), that's why their clear.  This is what all my eggs look like in the first 3-5 days, or prior to incubation.

He also said i could go to court if my chickens were worth it.   After my conversation with him I called my city clerk and she said that there wasn't a law that she was aware of.

It's impossible for chickens to fill all there dietary needs through table scraps and foraging. Even birds who are completely free-ranged, on good land, can be expected to obtain only 25% of their diet at the absolute maximum. And the average is 10-15%. If you don't feed your chickens a proper mix such as layer ration or supplemented flock raiser, they will become emaciated and most likely cease laying and growing very quickly.

BackYardChickens,3d1gmp,justinsayin,3,Mon Jul 13 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"There are actually no wild chickens. There are semi-feral chickens in other countries, who are usually a mixture of kept wild-type birds and wild-type birds which have reverted to ferality, and then there are fully feral chickens, who manage to survive in Hawaii and parts of Florida, because A. The conditions are perfectly ideal (tropical, predatorless) and B. Tourists feed them. Regardless of these pocket populations which have cropped up in very specific areas, the domestic chicken, Gallus Gallus domesticus, is a completely different species than their closest known ancestor, The Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Their dietary differences are great; Red Junglefowl are considered extremely difficult to keep, because they have not adapted to a modern diet. For example, Red Junglefowl consume up to 50% protein as part of their diets; while the domestic chicken only needs 16-20% (and amounts much higher than this are actually known to damage their internal organs). They are also completely undomesticated, and considered more or less untameable.  There's also the fact that all of these populations are wild type animals, usually of the origin of a cockfighting breed or having a large percentage of their genetics able to be traced back to cockfighting fowl; which, while vastly better at surviving on their own, are extremely poor producers of both meat and eggs.  So yes, you could attempt to get your chickens to live off table scraps and foraging; but even a game breed is likely to end up malnourished, and producing even less than the meager amount they already wound have been."

BackYardChickens,3d0d7l,heathenyak,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not much. We are under tree cover so hawks aren't a problem, yet. We have a dog and a cat to keep foxes away during the day, and they lock up at night."
BackYardChickens,3d0d7l,Thunder_god1987,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:01:37 2015 UTC,My back yard with a 4 foot chain link fence. My barred rocks and buff orpingtons can't really fly they just fall slower. Only one of my hens can fly but she's the rooster of my hens so she sticks close to her girls.
BackYardChickens,3d04eu,mister-disco,3,Sun Jul 12 10:37:26 2015 UTC,"Looks great. Expensive (only four chickens, right?) but not a problem if you aren't concerned about ROI and are just doing this for quality of life. For the water system, you'll want a way to easily clean it and I agree with the other poster about using nipples for water.   I'm not a fan of chicken wire on the ground to prevent scratching. I'd be worried about them hurting their feet. To get my hens some greenery in their run I used 2x4's to make a square (about 2ft x 1ft) and put hardware clothe on one side. Put that down, hardware cloth is raised above the ground with the 2x4s, and am now growing grass inside the box. The hens can nibble at the grass and periodically I'll move it so they can scratch up the roots. if you make 2-3 then you can rotate the grass sections they are able to dig up."
BackYardChickens,3d04eu,spotpig,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:48:42 2015 UTC,"That sounds great, I hadn't considered hardware cloth."
BackYardChickens,3d04eu,spotpig,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:03:27 2015 UTC,"It was super easy to staple it to the 2x4 and the box is small enough to easily move so we can rotate it around the coop. Did the same thing, but without hardware cloth, to make a dusting area for the birds and filled it with an ash/sand/organic soil mix."
BackYardChickens,3d04eu,IBProBro,2,Sun Jul 12 15:58:17 2015 UTC,Looks great.  I like the idea for the run.  I keep them off patches of ground and re grow grass in small areas. Personally I like using the nipples for watering.  I did have one break on me so far but it was my own fault.  While i repairng the drip methd i had a pan in the coop and they spilled it or made it filthy within hours.  The drip nozzles are cheap.  Just buy a couple extra and fix the system.  Im not very handy and i made a great bucket watering system.  I just think it keep the water clean and available for longer.  Gonna find out in a couple of months how they work in the cold.
BackYardChickens,3d04eu,sampson158,2,Sun Jul 12 10:55:46 2015 UTC,"looks good, but you should seriously consider the water nipples.  I simply put mine on a 5 gallon bucket hung from the ceiling and have had 0 problems.  they always have clean fresh water.  I too have considered using a rotational chicken run method like this with predator proof enclosures.  also, consider making them bigger.  you'll always want to expand and get more chickens."
BackYardChickens,3d04eu,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:08:25 2015 UTC,"Looks good, although chicken wire on the ground won't prevent them from tearing up grass. I agree with /u/spotpig about using hardware cloth boxes, they're an excellent solution.  Chicken nipples have pros and cons. The pro is that they will keep the water completely clean and fresh. The con is that studies show that chickens using chicken nipples drink less water overall than birds drinking from a basin, since using the nipples is an unnatural motion for them, and this issue can cause more heat stress during the summer."
BackYardChickens,3d04eu,dontforgetthelube,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:30:33 2015 UTC,Neat. I'd just say keep in mind that if you make things cut in even numbers of feet you'll get the most out of your material. So making a wall 4'4' instead of 4'5' will cut your cost in half since you won't be throwing away a 3' piece. I hope that makes sense. And I'm not sure if you'll be able to keep all the grass alive. I'm afraid even by rotating it they'll kill it all. Maybe just let them kill the grass in one quadrant and keep them in there 4 days per week and then just 1 day per week in the other quadrants. I guess that's something you'll have to decide once you have them in there.

I have and LOVE a mini advance, highly recommend them, but no way I'd sell mine :)  Though I'm hatching more eggs now so I've moved to a two hovabator setup, one has the auto turner, I put eggs in there and on day 18 I transfer them to my non turner hovabator for hatching, I keep the water topped up on this one, both are digitally controlled and so far, reliable as a rock."

If it bends normally, appears normal, and there aren't any obvious issues, it's probably physically fine, and she had most likely just tweaked/bruised it.  What is the hen's age? Is she vaccinated for Marek's disease?  And are you 100% sure your hen is a hen? Dropping one wing is a common way roosters display to hens or other aggressing roosters."

Good layers.  The black one is a black star, aka black sex link. Also a great laying breed.  The first ""auracana"" is an easter egger, which is a mutt of a breed anyway. Could be all ameracauna or could have some wellsummer or something else mixed in. Her ears should be whitish, and she should lay some sort of pretty blue egg.  The second ""auracana"" is almost certainly a speckled sussex mix. Looks like she has some heavy barring on the rest of her body, but who knows where that came from. Best guess? Sussex x Ameracauna."

BackYardChickens,3cv4nq,Grimsterr,3,Wed Jul 15 17:47:52 2015 UTC,This picture was taken after most of the flock went to the roost. I have 19 little ones that were born may 5. And 12 one year old hens. The area down wind of the scratch yard smells like the smell is coming from something hot. I can't describe it but it's an acidic smell. What you see in the pic is lots of the crumble from the feeders scattered about from their scratching and such. It's really nasty out there but not deep mud or anything. The chickens free range about half of the day so they don't spend all their time in there.

Don't recommend grass cuttings because they eat the grass and may wind up with impacted crops.  Cheapest source of bedding is driving around looking for people who have bagged up the leaves from their yard and thrown the bags out on the curb. Summer's a pretty slow time for that activity, so I'd recommend getting a bale of hay or taking a weed eater to any tall weeds you have on your property and tossing the results in.  e: also, raising those feeders up off the ground will give them less opportunity to spread it all around."

BackYardChickens,3cuo3c,GallusLafayetti,4,Fri Jul 10 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend you medicate right now.  Bubbly eyes are a common sign of respiratory illness, such as Mycoplasma.  Right now you need to quarantine and observe. If you treat, symptoms may disappear - which sounds like a good thing, but is bad in the long run. Right now, more than anything, you need to diagnose. Yes, it could be a simple eye infection. But if it is not, you are dealing with a much more serious issue.  Have you brought any new birds in recently? Have you heard any strange respiratory noises, including but not limited to coughing, sneezing, gasping, rattling, gurgling, choking, and wheezing? Have you seen any other birds with ocular symptoms at all? Any nasal discharge?  Quarantine Daisy as soon as you can. Watch her carefully, and the rest of your flock as well. Pay close attention to everyone's breathing and take note of any ruffled or lethargic birds, and especially pay attention to the eyes.  If you wait 3-4 days and see no respiratory symptoms, you can then begin treating Daisy (and only Daisy) with Tetracycline. If you can find an oinment approved for use in the eye at your local feed store, use it as well.  If you do begin seeing symptoms in other birds, I HIGHLY recommend seeing a vet. Blood tests are required to definitively diagnose respiratory illnesses, and depending on the vet and where you live, will most likely cost between $50-$100 dollars.  If symptoms arise in other birds but you really cannot afford or do not wish to see a vet, treat with Denagard instead of Tetracycline. It costs around $40/liter bottle, but is far more effective in treating Mycoplasmas (the most common form of respiratory disease)."

I attempted to rinse the eye a few times with some success, very gently of course and with tepid water, just in case there is a bit of dirt in the eye.  Her poop seems normal.  She didn't seem bothered by the eye until this evening.  I only noticed a problem about 24 hours ago though.  None of my other birds have any issues that I've noticed.  I will keep a close watch on that.   I'll get an ocular ointment tomorrow, and follow your other instructions.  Wish me luck.  Daisy's a sweet little hen, I hope I don't lose her.  Thank you again."

BackYardChickens,3cvkql,Jade_Orange,3,Sat Jul 11 06:36:52 2015 UTC,Honest question: why antibiotics?
BackYardChickens,3cvkql,adlerchen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:15:39 2015 UTC,"Cautionary thing I'm thinking, as I do this as well. However, this is only when I'm introducing new birds into my flock to prevent any diseases from spreading to mine."
BackYardChickens,3cvkql,Thunder_god1987,2,Sat Jul 11 18:34:06 2015 UTC,"What were the symptoms prior to death? Age and condition of the birds?  EDIT: A quick google search suggests Rural King is a farm supply chain store similar to Tractor Supply Co. Most stores of this type buy their chicks from large hatcheries, e.g. Murray McMurray. While all such large hatcheries maintain 100% clean, healthy stock, it is quite possible that poor care in such large chain stores can result in substandard health of stock and a high death rate. But they really shouldn't be carrying anything contagious or be capable of infecting adult birds."
BackYardChickens,3cvkql,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:41:13 2015 UTC,"I've asked an got no,real straight answer. They blow me off with bs statements that they aren't liable for any deaths.

BackYardChickens,3cvkql,falk225,5,Sat Jul 11 03:59:53 2015 UTC,"You replied to the comment but didn't answer any of the questions asked. Do you honestly think the guy at the retail store knows why your birds died but just won't tell you? No one knows what happened to your birds, but if you give us the details requested maybe we can figure it out."
BackYardChickens,3cvkql,Thunder_god1987,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"Find someone local, and buy from them. My assumption is the place you got them from didn't take good care of the birds. I raise baby birds all the time, and I've never had more than one or two per batch (30-60 little ones) not make it to adulthood.   Twelve out of thirteen is just absurd, you should warn your community of this so no one else buys birds from them. Write a review on their webpage, ect."
BackYardChickens,3cvkql,Sovereign_Curtis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:37:26 2015 UTC,Describe in detail the environment your flock was in.
BackYardChickens,3cvkql,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:03:50 2015 UTC,"What were the conditions like in the store? How did the chicks behave there? Things like plenty of clean water and food are often overlooked when stores get large batches of chicks and the staff isn't trained to take care of them. You might see chicks huddled together in corners because the heaters aren't correctly placed, or they'll be lethargic from malnourishment or mistreatment. Unfortunately it happens a lot in big stores, and it's rare that they take responsibility for any deaths.    Also, what kind of setup do you have for your brooder? Food, water, heat, etc? Were the chicks ever active and healthy or did they seem ill as soon as you brought them home?      I order my chicks from hatcheries with guarantees. McMurray gives a 48 hour live chick guarantee, though they've given me credit for chicks that died up to 72 hours later. I highly recommend them. Their customer service will also provide troubleshooting if you aren't comfortable with your brooder setup."
BackYardChickens,3cuhp4,__tmk__,3,Fri Jul 10 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"You need to be sure they are secure at night. If nothing can climb in, dig under, or otherwise gain unfettered access them then you should be ok. We have a small coop and pen. I let ours out into the pen early in the morning and will let them out into the back yard later in the day. At night they return to the coop and I lock it all up. Rinse and repeat."
BackYardChickens,3cuhp4,ethereel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  We have enough predators around (raccoons, skunks, hawks, etc.) that their run/pen is going to be completely enclosed -- am even debating sinking the fencing wire below the ground to deter diggers.  And I have learned enough to not use chicken wire! ;-)"
BackYardChickens,3cuhp4,kayakyakr,3,Fri Jul 10 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"You can also make ""wings"" of hardware cloth that extend out a foot or so. They'll try to dig right at the base of the coop and will hit wire. Don't have to bury it then."
BackYardChickens,3cuhp4,kayakyakr,2,Sat Jul 11 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, if they have a fully enclosed run, you're good to go. Don't leave a roost outside or they may choose to sleep outside. If it doesn't get too cold/wet where you're at, then letting them sleep outside isn't even a bad thing.   My chickens have no hen house, just a run with roosting bars under a covered end."
BackYardChickens,3cuhp4,cordial_carbonara,2,Sat Jul 11 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"Like the others said, so long as your run is as secure as your coop, you should be good. For our run, we dug around the perimeter and placed hardware cloth a foot into the ground and up two feet from the ground, then did field fencing with 2""x4"" holes up from there. I leave the coop door (a 1'x2' opening) open into the run 24/7 unless the weather is particularly severe, and we've not had any losses in the past 2 years since we constructed the coop (and we live in a rural area with lots of raccoons, opossums, coyotes and dogs).    The first week or two you have your chickens out there, you will want to shut them in at night to make sure they understand that's where they're supposed to roost. But after that you should be okay!"
BackYardChickens,3cuhp4,Grimsterr,2,Sat Jul 11 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"If you're sure none of the local predators can get in there, it's fine.  I keep mine in a chain link dog kennel (12x12) and I have chicken wire over the top of it so it's 100% enclosed, and my ground is hard, nothing is gonna dig under in one night, if I find any signs of digging, I just move the kennel a foot and it's back on solid ground and the pest has to start over again.   I never shut up the coop."
BackYardChickens,3cv3vh,MrsMoose7911,5,Sat Jul 11 00:50:49 2015 UTC,You'll need to remove her for more than a day. A week is about the minimum to have any serious impact on the behavior.
BackYardChickens,3cv3vh,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat Jul 11 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Helps to have a time frame. Do you recommend locating ""chicken jail"" out of sight of the rest of the flock or is simply unable to make contact enough?"
BackYardChickens,3cv3vh,GallusLafayetti,3,Sat Jul 11 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't have any contact, visual or otherwise. A dog crate in a laundry room, garage, or similar place works quite well in my experience."
BackYardChickens,3cv3vh,MelonHeadSeb,2,Sat Jul 11 03:27:56 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be better to let them have only visual contact so she can get used to the pullets being around her so she hopefully stops chasing them?
BackYardChickens,3cv3vh,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:45:55 2015 UTC,"No, she shouldn't be around them at all. The idea is to hopefully remove her from the pecking order entirely, so when she's brought back SHE is seen as a new bird - and low hen on the pecking order."
BackYardChickens,3cv3vh,MelonHeadSeb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:37:22 2015 UTC,Good to know. I was kinda surprised to have any issues at all because the two flocks have been in separate pens but within inches of each other since the newbies were old enough to go outside. I've pulled Lagertha back out and she's currently sitting alone in the cage I use for broody busting. The rest of the flock is totally peaceful. Thanks alot for your help!!

Make sure there aren't any wounds, and check the bottom of the foot for any abscesses or bumblefoot-like black spots. Is she just limping? Or are you seeing stumbling, discoordination, etc.? If you can't find anything wrong at all, she probably just stepped wrong. It usually resolves itself. Occasionally, it won't - I had a rooster who limped severely for 3 months straight. Nothing at all wrong with his leg, everything completely normal on the inside when I went to butcher him. He just wouldn't stand on that leg. It didn't seem to cause him too much strife, though - if he hadn't been so mean I probably would have left him be.  Rhode Island reds are sexed like any other breed. Comb/wattle and stance are the main things to watch out for. You'll know for sure by 12+ weeks, RIR roos are known to be feisty."
BackYardChickens,3curjw,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:29:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is excellent advice.  I'm thinking that he is a rooster, because him and another chick are always ""standing off"" and fighting a little bit. Hopefully I don't have an extra rooster, or the poor fella is bound for the soup pot.   We will see in a few weeks though!  He doesn't seem to be disoriented or anything like that, just  limpy and sitting down a lot.  It doesn't seem to be getting worse, or spreading to the rest of the flock, so hopefully it will resolve itself.  Thanks again!"
BackYardChickens,3cuyvv,Zelytic,3,Sat Jul 11 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"I can't see any reason for trying to fix a meat bird. Even a slow-growing meat bird is not going to live long life, so if the wing heals wrong, it's not as if it's going to be causing him to be in pain for years and years.  In some cases, wraps aren't even recommended for chickens. I'm not a vet and haven't dealt with broken wings as so far, but I can relay the steps that were taken when my Buff Orpington's leg was broken some years back. My avian vet (highly respected in her field) said that it would heal on it's own, without a wrap or cast, and also commented that ""If you put two chicken bones in the same room, they'll heal together."""
BackYardChickens,3cuyvv,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat Jul 11 02:47:22 2015 UTC,"Wrap the wing, then use that tape they use to wrap your arm up after a blood donation to wrap both his wings against his body, then make the little guy a cone of shame out of a tiny sized Dixie cup with the bottom punched out. Then make him a pet since you care about him this much that he isn't a Cornish game hen yet."

The first examples of the breed appeared in the 1870s. Wyandottes are a docile, dual-purpose breed kept for their brown eggs and for meat. They appear in a wide variety of color patterns, and are popular show birds. The Wyandotte lays pale brown or tan eggs and usually has a white ring of feathers around its neck. Wyandotte hens are devoted mothers.    Image i     Relevant: Mike the Headless Chicken | Winnebago chicken | List of chicken breeds   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

BackYardChickens,3cq98k,big_onion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'd really appreciate that! I'm going to a feed store tomorrow. In the meantime I have some fruits and vegetables she might be interested in. I'll double check lists of hazardous foods first, of course.  What exactly should I do about shelter? She goes under the houses. I assume for security and coolness. I don't want to put her in a place that isn't secure enough or doesn't provide escape from predators."
BackYardChickens,3cq98k,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:02:31 2015 UTC,"If you go to a feed store in NOLA or Metry you're gonna pay quite a bit. We used to go to Rose Garden Center on the Westbank -- he had decent prices (and is a really nice old man).  But Double M (there's one on Jeff Hwy, another in Midcity, another on W. Esp) or something should be fine. Don't buy a huge bag for now. Just get some lay pellets or whatever is cheap. NOT medicated. In the meantime, some fruits and stuff are fine but birds need protein. If you have some dog kibble or something, she'd probably appreciate a little bit of that -- don't overdo it.   Living under the house isn't the best place. Raccoons, cats, dogs, are all predators ... but she probably has some decent survival skills so maybe she will be ok. If you want something secure you will need to buy or build. Lots of plans on the internet for enclosures -- your challenge will be getting her into it.  Chickens enjoy routine. If you want her to stay, just be consistent with what you do. Feed at the same times for a few days and she'll be looking for you, give a call when you feed (""chik-chik-chicken!"" or whatever) and she'll come when you do the call.  If I had a spare coop I'd help you out, but my movable pens are big (8' x 8') and full of rabbits right now. Look on Craigslist or something ... someone is bound to have something, and hopefully for cheap.  If you have any quesitons let me know. Good luck."
BackYardChickens,3cq98k,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Jul 10 05:01:03 2015 UTC,"Can you catch her? It's important to get her somewhere safe. A large cage would work well as a temporary housing unit. Dog crates work very well - something sized for a lab, retriever, similar sized dog should be adequate. Pine shavings are the best bedding.  She's most likely an adult or pullet of laying age, so she needs a laying feed. Go to the closest feed store and ask for a laying crumble. They may sell it in 5 lb. Or 35 lb. bags or you may have to buy the whole 50 lb. bag.  She should have fresh, clean water available.  If you can catch her, check her for mites. Check the fluff area below the vent (butthole), the neck between and below the wattles, and under the wings. Mites/Lice will create nests of many tiny white eggs which will form hardened clumps clinging to the feathers. You may also see bugs crawling on her. If you do see signs of mites, you should buy a permethrin dust and dust her entire body.  Chances are she's a gamefowl hen of some breed; they are the most common to go feral. Would love to see pics of her."
BackYardChickens,3cq98k,kayakyakr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"She's a little skiddish but will approach within a few feet. I have a large dog kennel/cage that I can repurpose for her. Maybe she'll just wander in there if I leave tasty things for her?  Where should I keep the cage? It's for a collie, so it's pretty big. I don't think any predator could reach in far enough to get her. Any thoughts on strategic placement?  I can't get close enough to know for sure, but I'm worried her ears may have infection. But I have bad eyesight even with glasses, so it might just be the color of her feathers around her ears. In any case, I plan to bring her to a local vet to get her looked at as soon as possible. I may have to recruit help because of my schedule for the next few weeks.  My phone is acting up, but I'll post pictures as soon as I get it straightened out!  Thank you!"
BackYardChickens,3cozf5,FarvasMoustache,6,Thu Jul 9 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea!  What we do, aside from keeping the brooding hen out of the neat box, is put her in a pet carrier at night. We have one that fits inside the hen house. Sleeping on the cold plastic floor of the carrier at night usually breaks the brooding cycle within 2-3 days."
BackYardChickens,3cozf5,weshallrise,6,Thu Jul 9 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"We broke our broody hen in the same way with a wire pet carrier. The  trick is to keep their stomach area cool with airflow so as not to encourage the heat loving broodyness that they hens want. We did let our one broody hen nest with the other ladies at night on their perch, but during the day it was into the pet carrier. Also of course needed to provide food and water. The broody hen was still near the other hens when she was in the carrier during the day. Just spending time out in chicken jail."
BackYardChickens,3cozf5,OldGrumpyRepublican,3,Thu Jul 9 21:51:58 2015 UTC,"Similar idea, but we usually just kick them off the eggs, then dip them legs down in water to wing level. It makes them chilly I guess and they usually stop brooding.   Either that or it's a coincidence and I've bought into a superstition."
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,thestraightarrow,2,Fri Jul 10 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"3-4 is a great starter flock! It is recommended that you get 3 birds minimum - if you only get 2, and 1 is taken by a predator, the remaining bird will be awful lonesome until you can get her a friend.  I don't trust dogs. No matter how sweet they are, or how small. Even toy breeds like Chihuahuas have been known to kill full grown chickens. The best thing you can do is keep your dog completely separate from your birds at all times.  Eglus are not my favorite design. Personally I recommend a box coop (sold in a large cardboard box, assembled at home) for those who only wish to keep 4-8 birds. Box coops run $300-$400 for a good quality one, and are ideal for the small backyard flock. They usually come with trays, for easy cleaning.  Silkies aren't really the best choice for a first time owner with county restrictions. The main reason is because they are sold straight run only, meaning they are mixed, unsexed, males and females. So any resulting roosters you would have to rehome, and it's not easy to rehome a rooster. They are also poor egg layers - they lay very small white eggs, and few of them.  We have a breed wiki right here on the /r/backyardchickens sub, put together by yours truly. In the sidebar you'll see a little link titled ""Breeds"". Head over there for descriptions and stats on most of the common feed store breeds.  I recommend Barred Rocks, Rhode Island Reds, Ameraucanas, Sex Links and Wyandottes as some great beginner breeds. Barred Rocks in particular make excellent first-time birds.  I also recommend the book ""Storey's Guide to Raising Chickens."" It should have nearly all the information you need to begin the project. I also recommend ""Storey's Guide to Poultry Breeds"", if you can spare the money - it's one of the best breed books out there, and I've found it an invaluable resource in choosing and buying a lot of my birds."
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Jul 10 03:38:18 2015 UTC,Just an additional note - ameraucanas are sold straight run as well.   Edit: well real ameraucanas. You may find birds labeled as such but are actually mixes or Easter eggers that are sold sexed.
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,cluckingaround,2,Fri Jul 10 08:55:33 2015 UTC,"I typically refer to Easter Eggers as Ameraucanas. It would make it a lot easier if everybody just sold them as Easter Eggers instead of an entire variety of names (including Ameraucana and Araucana, to name a few popular ones), but unfortunately I don't see the hatcheries changing their policies any time soon, so I call them Amerauacanas for the sake of simplicity."
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,GallusLafayetti,3,Fri Jul 10 09:37:41 2015 UTC,That is like saying a lab mix should be called a lab and there shouldn't be a golden retriever.   Ameraucana and araucana are breeds of chicken that breed true.   Easter eggers are a cross between either an araucana or Ameraucana and anything else.   Just because a pet store calls a chug (chihuahua x pug) a name doesn't mean it's a real breed.
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,cluckingaround,2,Fri Jul 10 10:29:11 2015 UTC,"Of course Easter Eggers aren't a real breed. They're a type more than anything, with some shared characteristics and shared genetic heritage - that of both Ameraucanas and Araucanas of various colorations, left over many years to interbreed and produce a mutt-type population. It would simply be a lot easier if hatcheries got together and decided to call them the same thing. The most correct name for them is Easter Egger, but the majority of hatcheries still sell them as Ameraucanas."
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Jul 10 10:36:56 2015 UTC,I agree and honestly I owe you an apology. I read your response as that they SHOULD be called Ameraucanas. I think we are on the same page.

BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,SchipAlong,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"Also, are Silkies still bad if I can get a female? I've seen sellers that sell female, male, and straight run. We don't go through many eggs. Just the occasional weekend breakfast and baking. When I buy them, I usually only used 3-4 then the rest go bad. I guess I have concerned about having too many eggs and them going to waste, but I guess I could give them to friends."
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"If your heart is set on a Silkie, I say go for it. Especially if you can find a female. I actually prefer bantam eggs over large eggs, and I'm considering rehoming my large fowl because I can't remember the last time I ate one of their eggs (I give them all away). Bantam eggs are quality over quantity. The egg might be half the size of a large chicken's, but the yolk is nearly the same size between the two. Most of the flavour and baking quality is in the yolk. It does require double the amount of eggs in recipes, so they probably aren't the best choice for someone who goes through two dozen eggs a week, but for someone who just wants pocket pets with bonus adorably tiny eggs bantam are fantastic. I'm much more paranoid about eagles with my bantams though, which is really their only downside."
BackYardChickens,3cr4eh,SchipAlong,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't see a huge problem if you can find somewhere selling sexed females. But you will have to make sure your coop is well insulated during the winter. Silkies are not cold weather birds; their feathers don't hold in any heat, and can't protect from rain or snow. For reference, they can be kept in cold, just not extreme cold and bad weather. I have several Silkies, and our winters get to around 25 F. on the coldest few days of the year. But I wouldn't recommend them if it gets any colder, or extreme weather is a norm for your winters.  If you do, be sure to get some Sizzles too. Sizzles are great."
BackYardChickens,3cql3l,grievous2552,3,Thu Jul 9 23:55:19 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of the time I stepped on a broody hen'd chick and broke its neck, cause I looked away for ONE second. Birds can really put themselves in the worst places sometimes...  Head and spine injuries will either resolve themselves, worsen, and remain in a steady condition and require either lifelong care of humane culling.  For now all you can do is keep her quiet and calm. The injury doesn't sound too severe, so I would be optimistic. I have seen very hurt birds recover - one rooster of mine ran into a fence, and seemingly injured his neck/head. After watching him flop around on the ground for several minutes, I decided to put him out of his pain by breaking the neck. I twisted his head around THREE TIMES. He seemed dead, so I left for a minute to put the other chickens away for the night - when he comes walking up behind me! He stumbles into the coop, I'm too shocked to do anything, so I leave him and close the coop. Next morning, he's acting completely normal. I called him undead chicken after that."

BackYardChickens,3cqdzy,IdesofBlue,2,Thu Jul 9 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"What age are they? If they are younger than 6 weeks and comparable in age to your other chicks, there is no reason to keep them separate.  They are mostly likely just stressed.

When they do deign to notice the other poultry, even the Cochins, who are bigger than they are, it's to bully and push aside.  They have not shown aggression towards humans (that's a one way trip to the chopping block in my yard).    I think they're at about puberty, and may start fighting with each other, too?

Nobody wants the noise or aggression. But Once I am experienced I think I may ask my boss to let me perform the procedure on a few of the boys we are sent missexed as hens...

BackYardChickens,3clrq0,jrwreno,3,Thu Jul 9 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"It is not impossible to train your dogs to ignore, even to protect your chickens. However, it is dependant on the person, AND the dog.  I have an almost 4-month-old Border Collie. He wants so very badly to go in and bother the flock of 40+ chickens. The day he did not listen to my instructions, and went into the chicken run, he met Big Papa. My golden Australorp rooster that stands as tall as he does. Big Papa kicked his ass, and then some for good measure.  I allowed the ass-kicking, because I felt it was an important lesson  for my dog Yoshi.   My puggle Suzie is well trained to protect my flock. She gets paid in eggs. She protects them from hawks, at-large dogs, and even alarms for coyotes.   It took 2 weeks to train her from wanting to attack or run at them, to be able to lay down among them while they dust bathe in a feathery pile.  At first, after a good walk, I had her on a leash that I had tied to my belt loop, with a treat/training pouch in my shirt pocket, and 2 pieces of 2x4 in my other hand. Anytime she would start to make a move at the chickens, I would loudly tell her NO, and tug on the leash. If she advanced or barked beyond that, I would clap the 2 pieces of 2x4 together (it is a loud CLAP), point at her and tell her NO, walk over to her and make her lay down. I only needed to clap the 2x4 2 times.   With hunting dogs I have trained, I have had to use the 2x4 clapping to 'snap' them out of the aggressive prey-drive tunnel vision they sometimes get. If the dog relaxed, laid down and ignored them, they got heavily rewarded with treats and praise.  When we would walk by them, at first I would keep the hand on the collar, and if the dog would get too excited, I would make it sit, and I would stand in between the dog and chickens.   The best training, is to have the dog on a VERY secure tie-out (escape proof, preferably with an escape proof collar too), that only allows them within 8-15 feet of the nearby foraging chickens. With aggressive hunting dogs for the first couple of days, I put a humane muzzle on them in case they escaped the tie-out.    Supervise, but leave the dog alone on that very secure line, and then feed the chickens nearby. Ignore the dog if it goes crazy or whines or watches the chickens too much. Once the dog relaxes, THEN heavily praise the dog, treats and pets, then go immediately back to feeding scratch to the chickens.   After a few days, the dog will grow accustomed to the chickens being YOUR chickens, and to be ignored. Always follow-through and be consistent in your rules. You can also keep the dog sitting at your feet when you feed the chickens, and make them pay attention to you, or ignore the chickens, while you feed them.  With big dogs or hunting dogs, this takes a lot of effort and will power."

I can own a rooster in town (as long as the neighbors don't complain), so I just built him an insulated house and run (10 sq ft, 4 sq ft internal) that I could throw him way out in my creek bed.  The issue with the crow collar is you have to get it just right, and that takes it being pretty tight. When you have it that tight, you take the risk that the bird tries to swallow something too big and chokes and dies.  For some people, the risk will be worth it. For others, it will not."
BackYardChickens,3cjh3s,flip69,2,Wed Jul 8 13:39:52 2015 UTC,"What I read is that to crow roosters suck in and expel a large volume of air all at once, and the collar simply forces them to exhale at a normal rate. So it's reduced noise, not eliminated noise, and they can still go about their day making all their other vocalizations. I've DIY'ed two collars, a fancy stitched fabric and velcro one just like the brand version and a simple all velcro collar. I have one collared cockerel at the moment because he's unbelievably loud (louder than a large fowl rooster my SO met yesterday), he crows so freaking often, and he sounds like a hysterical old woman. His half volume collared crow is still louder than my other cockerels' uncollared. I think they look pretty cute wearing collars too.  Edit: They do freak out and flip around/try to back out of it at first, because they're not used to feeling something around their neck. It took maybe a day at most for my guy to stop furiously grooming his hackle feathers and now he doesn't even acknowledge he's wearing a collar at all."
BackYardChickens,3cjh3s,Thunder_god1987,2,Wed Jul 8 14:48:44 2015 UTC,I bought one and it ended up being a disaster. My roo would not calm down and raced around the coop trying to get it off.

These last few months I've had to move him indoors to muffle the sound of his calls (morning and evening).   This seems like a very good solution.

BackYardChickens,3cikgf,justinsayin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is Alfalfa Hay, and Alfalfa Straw.   I prefer Alfalfa Straw, because it gives something to the hens to peck and eat, it also supplements green nitrogen the layers of compost I put down in the 40'x40' chicken run. I use my chicken run as a massive composting floor, and I get a cubic yard of rich compost soil from them every 6-10months.   Because I put in a lot of leaves and wood chips recently, I need to balance the nitrogen in the compost layers, so the wood chips lock up nitrogen from the Alfalfa straw and grass clippings.   I also get a lot of alfalfa volunteers in the chicken run by doing this, which I encourage for my chickens to forage on due to improving the flavor of the eggs significantly. It also improves the nutrients in the eggs as well."
BackYardChickens,3cikgf,Grimsterr,0,Thu Jul 9 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"Alfalfa is expensive, roughly 2-3 times the price of just plain old straw, I would never use it as bedding on that alone."

BackYardChickens,3cht0d,Pukako,5,Wed Jul 8 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on the age. I wouldn't dream of introduction anytime before 12 weeks, at least.  First, are you getting them from a trusted source? craigslist, acquaintances, etc. are not trusted sources. An example of a trusted source would be a hatchery or a feed store.  If not, you need to quarantine them. This must happen out of contact of your existing flock; a dog crate in the laundry room, garage, etc. works great. Quarantine should last for a minimum of 2 weeks and an ideal of 3-4. Be sure to disinfect yourself before and after handling them.  After quarantine, if necessary, is over, you can move them to an area of your pen which is fenced off. 4 foot chicken wire works well. They should remain in this area for at least a week, preferably a couple weeks, depending on age. They should have a dog crate or cage inside the coop for nighttime.  After several weeks of introduction and once the pullets reach at least 12 weeks of age, you should wait until nightfall, and put the new birds on the roost beside the others. They should wake up in the morning together, and that will reduce stress and picking.  Remember to mix their feed until the young birds reach ~16 weeks. A 50/50 grower-layer combo works nicely."
BackYardChickens,3cht0d,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! We're getting them from an established hatchery just out of town, so vaccinations, etc are ok. The initial girls were from a different hatchery so they were vaccinated, too.  We will be picking them up at 12 weeks. Yip, we've thought about the different food, and will get a bag of the pullet mix for them.  Sounds like, to ensure the greedy pair don't eat all the new chooks food, I should keep them separated.  At the moment, it's easier to allow the chickens the run of the back yard, and fence off the vege garden than the other way around. And there's only one entrance to the coop. If I give the new birds a temporary coop for the first few weeks, will there be issues with them finding the real coop later?  Also, how do I get the new oners to sleep on perches? Had no idea with the first lot, and they sleep in a pile in the corner of the old coop, and still sleep in the nesting boxes. I'd like to get these ones off to a better start..."
BackYardChickens,3cht0d,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:32 2015 UTC,"If I give the new birds a temporary coop for the first few weeks, will there be issues with them finding the real coop later?   They may attempt to sleep outside the first few nights. Personally, I would just recommend moving them by hand each night, to a dog carrier inside the current coop. But if that isn't possible, I can't see any major issues with using an entirely different coop, aside from the difficulties of moving the birds.   Also, how do I get the new oners to sleep on perches? Had no idea with the first lot, and they sleep in a pile in the corner of the old coop, and still sleep in the nesting boxes. I'd like to get these ones off to a better start...   Move them to the roosts each night if they don't jump up there already. You can do it with your current birds as well, to prevent them from roosting on the nesting boxes. Continued placing on the roosts is the only way to train them."
BackYardChickens,3cht0d,jrwreno,2,Wed Jul 8 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"If you are moving them in at 12 weeks/3 months, and they are 3 to 2, I think you will do fine.  Rearrange the chicken run completely, add new things, toys, perch areas. Do this the night you introduce your pullets.   The next day, the old AND new will not know what to do, they will be like a whole new flock of chickens in a new nest site. The old chickens will be so baffled, they will have little time to bully the new ones.   You will need to pick up the new ones and set them up at the roost at night, for at least 3-7 days. If they free-range the whole backyard, I see little chance of the new ones getting cornered and hurt.   Good luck! It is always fun to increase the flock...."

Chances are pretty good she and the other birds will kill them, if they don't freeze to death from lack of warmth first.  It can be quite difficult to get even a broody hen to accept chicks. She must have been broody for so long, but not too long, or she won't accept them. They can't be more than a few days old, and if she already has chicks, she can't have had those ones for more than a few days. Even then, a perfectly suitable broody might reject and kill the babies."

Then, little things like her plumage is a bit off, and her comb is uneven and kind of ""chunky."" Also, her legs should be yellow, not gray. Don't get me wrong, I love her and think she's gorgeous, but the show ring is a whole other creature. If you want to show birds, you'll need to find a breeder. Hatchery quality birds are great pets and awesome for backyard flocks, but they tend to breed their animals based on health and production rather than the perfection that breeders look for in their stock."

BackYardChickens,3cbi0e,nspectre,9,Mon Jul 6 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sure, she was 16 weeks when she left and most of my chickens lay at 21 weeks. She's just hit 20 weeks old now and still isn't laying, so I'm really freaked out about what the hell she's been doing for the past four weeks.   I don't even live on a farm or anything btw, these are in my garden which I've turned into a mini chicken pasture. They usually stay at my neighbors during the day since their garden is literally a mini forest, but they don't mind at the cost of the free eggs ;)  There isn't anywhere she could have went to get lost, so I'm convinced she got abducted by aliens."

Despite an injury to one of our (now deceased) girls when they were pullets, the remaining two really upset the neighborhood cats.

BackYardChickens,3cbwm8,urbanmermaid,3,Mon Jul 6 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"The first of many to come, they get pretty crafty with where they lay their eggs. I own a free range flock that has access to seven acres of land, and those girls are geniuses at finding the best hiding places to lay.   You can try golf balls, or some sort of stone egg to fool them into laying in one spot. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. With mine, it's a split since some lay where the golf balls are, and some lay in my wellhouse."

I was surprised that she laid on a day it was so hot though, it's been in the upper 90's -low 100's here in Oregon.   They have a nesting box with some decoys in it, I'm hoping the next one gets laid in the nesting box. Sooo excited though, can't wait until the other 5 start laying as well. I got them all as chicks in February and wasn't sure when we'd start to see eggs as it seems to vary pretty widely by breed.   First time chicken owner and I'm really enjoying these ladies :)"

BackYardChickens,3cbwm8,asheridan_,0,Tue Jul 7 16:46:43 2015 UTC,I'm not an expert but I think it's because they laid it in the dirt on the ground in their run instead of in the clean bedding in the nesting box.

If I had to guess, I'd say the cause was a sharp board or nail, or a nasty henpecking.  Apply neosporin. Do NOT use the type with pain medication; anything with an ingredient ending in ""-cain"" (such as the one used in pain-treating neosporin) is harmful to poultry.  You should also put on some Pick-No-More lotion to prevent the other birds from attempting to cannibalize it.  On the off chance that it begins to turn black or otherwise appear quite infected, you should dub the afflicted area of the comb. Use a very sharp sterilized pair of scissors or a knife, and apply flour or corn starch to the area afterward to staunch the bleeding. Treat the wound with neosporin and Pick-No-More for several days to a week."

The coop was not damaged at all and I don't believe the other hen in the coop was the culprit, as she is very mellow. (Any ideas as to how this might've happened?)  Do combs have many nerve endings? If so, is there anything I can do to alleviate any pain she is feeling or make her feel more comfortable? First-time chicken owner and quite concerned."
BackYardChickens,3c915n,whatsreallygoingon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"Mine was injured by trying to stick her head through bird netting (in a run that was made by someone else, and which I've since discarded). I'd imagine that it could have been caused by her poking her head into any place where the comb may have gotten caught.  The magical part was, that her head was covered in blood, which turned into small black specks on her feathers (in addition to the torn comb). I was worried that one of the other hens would peck her and got a fright when I saw her ""sister"" the Brown Leghorn standing over her and pecking at her head. The Orpington (who is usually top chicken) was standing very still, in a submissive posture. Within ten minutes the Leghorn had gently plucked every drop of dried blood from the injured hen's head; without causing further injury. It was gross to watch her eat it, but fascinating that they seemed to have arrived at this mutually beneficial interaction."

BackYardChickens,3c915n,peeksvillain,3,Mon Jul 6 05:27:24 2015 UTC,I cannot tell you what caused this.  I would suggest covering the wound with petroleum jelly or a product similar to prevent insects from being attracted to it.  In my experience it is not a very nerve sensitive area.

BackYardChickens,3cao37,cubanesis,3,Mon Jul 6 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it's just the basic new hen stuff, but you might want to start offering them a laying mash, and an extra source of calcium like oyster shells.    laying mash is designed specifically to supply the nutrient content that laying hens need to lay you lots of eggs and be nutritionally happy.  and you are right about the calcium deficiency, but it's part of their natural process, as their laying cycle kicks in, they are kickstarting their calcium cycle, supplementing their diet with oyster shell is what most people do, plus a 50lb bag will prob last you a little over a year.     as for the free range foraging, they will come eat feed as they need it, if you want them to forage your yard for bugs that's an easy way to supplement their diet, and when they want feed they'll eat that too, it might have them laying a few less eggs but it should work out ok."
BackYardChickens,3cao37,sampson158,3,Mon Jul 6 14:08:45 2015 UTC,"Chickens take a few weeks to get things worked out. You could get double yokes. Deformed eggs. Weird stuff.  Sounds like the one hen didn't know to go lay in a box.  For calcium get a bag of supplement and leave it near their water. They will get it as needed.   Two recommendations.  1) lock them up in the pin for a few days, they need to learn where to lay eggs or you are going to have eggs all over your yard.  2) start a compost pile somewhere. Nothing fancy, just a spot where you dump kitchen scraps and grass clippings. Put the old egg shells in there too. This will become a gold mine for everyone. Bugs for the girls and after they turn it a few times that dirt compost is great for the garden."
BackYardChickens,3cao37,kramfive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:10:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, we already have a small compost pile going. We have only been out in the country for about 6 months now. They all have boxes and we've tried getting them to lay in them, but so far only the bantam will actually use hers, and she only uses it half the time. She will lay 2-3 eggs in the box, then a few days of no eggs, and then I find a new nest under a bush. We don't have a huge yard so I don't mind hunting them down. I really want them to be as much like ""wild"" chickens as possible. I'll try cooping them up for a few days and see if we can get them using the boxes. Thanks!"
BackYardChickens,3cao37,falk225,2,Mon Jul 6 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"Make sure the boxes are inviting. Elevated, but not as high as the roosts, filled with some sort of soft bedding material (hay, wood shavings, etc) and close and secure feeling. I also recommend placing a golf ball in each nest box to help cast the vision for what a great place to lay an egg it would be."
BackYardChickens,3cao37,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jul 6 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"It's normal for the first few weeks of egg laying to be strange. Their reproductive systems are still getting used to the stress. Although 2 eggs within half an hour? Now that's interesting. A hen's typical cycle is 25 hours. Technically, this shouldn't be able to be changed, and it should be impossible for a bird to lay more than one egg in a 25 hour span. Of course, they do it anyways, god knows how. But I would expect maybe an egg in the morning and an egg in the evening. Two so close together is very interesting. Keep an eye on that girl's laying, she could be something fascinating.  As for the shell-less-ness, you can supply them with oyster shell, which they will eat if they feel they need it. Regardless, it may not be a calcium deficiency causing this issue, sometimes shell-less eggs just happen.  First eggs are usually smaller, but they usually ""size up"" within a week or two. I'd love to see a picture of your Welsummer; 10 pounds would be freakishly large for hatchery stock bird, even a rooster."

We go back to close up their roost around dusk and we always spend a few minutes rubbing their bellies and scratching their waddles. Her and our Cinnamon Queen get so excited they start screaming when we come back there. At first I thought they didn't like us messing with them, but they move towards us and nuzzle us until we start rubbing them, so I guess they are into it. Even the bantam, who is super skittish, has started letting us give her some belly rubs when they are getting tucked in. They are really one of the best decisions we've ever made.

BackYardChickens,3c7xfn,cordial_carbonara,3,Mon Jul 6 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"It's unusual for a bird to begin laying prior to 18 weeks, but there are a few high production breeds - such as Leghorns or Sex Links - known to lay as early as 16.  High-production, early layers are more prone to reproductive issues than birds that lay less and later. But I wouldn't say that laying a few weeks earlier than typical really changes their chances of acquiring a reproductive problem, at least not in any significant manner."
BackYardChickens,3c7mz1,bredoub,4,Sun Jul 5 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, you should really not introduce a chicken by itself. It's always recommended you bring in, at a minimum, pairs, as a single bird is likely to be picked on far worse than a pair.  Kudos to you for remembering to quarantine. Failing to remember the big Q is a big mistake I myself have made. That said, 2 weeks is the bare minimum. 3 weeks is all that's necessary in most cases, but if you can, go 4. After the first week or so, introduce one of your hens to the new birds' quarantine. Choose whichever one you like the least; this bird is your proverbial canary in the coal mine. If the new birds are carrying (but not displaying) a disease, the ""canary"" will become infected and begin to show symptoms.  Ideally, after quarantine is over, you should put the birds in a separate part of your pen. A 4 foot chicken wire fence to round off a corner should suffice. Use a small dog crate inside the coop for night-time. The new birds and existing flock will be able to see, but not injure, each other. Keep this set up for anywhere from a couple days to a couple weeks (the longer the better).  When they are ready to be introduced, you should wait until night fall, then place the new birds beside the others on the roost. They'll wake up together in the morning, and this should reduce stress and picking."

BackYardChickens,3c7mz1,corrikopat,3,Mon Jul 6 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"When you add the new chicken, rub her down (especially her head) with a bit of Pick No More by Rooster Booster for the first week or so. It will cut down on her getting pecked by the others. Works VERY well"
BackYardChickens,3c7mz1,uliarliarpantsonfire,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:04:18 2015 UTC,I would probably quarantine a few weeks if it's a full grown chicken. After that I'd bring in one of your other hens and introduce her into the quarantined area. Let them bond and sort things out for a few days then add them both into the group together. This will help deter fighting since they are an even number. Hope that helps?
BackYardChickens,3c7mz1,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Sun Jul 5 22:53:59 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really great idea. They're all about 4 months old. The one I'm adding is the shy one of my friend's flock. I could introduce my shy hen first. The smallest hen of my flock (not a banty, but banty-sized) is the top of the pecking order, so even though the new chicken will be picked on, she'll still outsize the mean one."

I did that for about a week, and then found the wonder that is a 50lb bag for $17.50. Medicated feed depends on if your land has had diseases. Mine has never had an outbreak of anything, so I don't use medicated starter feed. If any of my birds show any signs of sickness I'll mix some antibiotic into their water for a few days until it clears up."
BackYardChickens,3c4emy,Thunder_god1987,2,Sat Jul 4 21:37:41 2015 UTC,Some form of feed grain or corn + Kitchenscraps
BackYardChickens,3c4emy,esbenab,2,Sat Jul 4 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"I don't give medicated feed until they go outside, and even then only one or two bags. The birds can only develop immunity to cocci while being treated with the medication if they have been exposed, and until they go outside they're not likely to have exposure. Some people never give medicated feed though and never have problems. I do because I had a nasty run-in with cocci and know now the cysts are in my soil and I don't want a repeat.    I feed my gals Dumor from Tractor Supply. Once they get outside and are free range I notice they don't eat as much, I have 17 fully grown chickens right now and buy a 50 lb bag every couple weeks at the most, depending on the weather and how often we give them kitchen scraps. I'm also not concerned with being all-organic either, though, I can't afford it."
BackYardChickens,3c4emy,cordial_carbonara,2,Sat Jul 4 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Purina is basically the cheapest you're going to get, and that's because it's a crap feed.  Where are you buying it at $6 a bag? Are you buying the 5 pound or something? It's much, much cheaper to buy it by the 50 pound bag.  How many birds do you have?  I don't know what feeding schedule Purina recommends. Bar Ale, my brand, suggests switching from medicated starter to non-medicated grower at 8 weeks."

BackYardChickens,3c4emy,falk225,2,Sun Jul 5 00:41:12 2015 UTC,I dont' see anything on Amazon that isn't super expensive. We get our feed from tractor supply. The 50 Lb bags are significantly cheaper. The feed we use for chicks that havn't started laying yet is Dumor brand Starter/Grower feed. Then once we start getting eggs we move them to Dumor's Layer crumbles. 13-16$ for a 50 lb bag.
BackYardChickens,3c4emy,Aerron,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:07:42 2015 UTC,Try  different feed store or Tractor Supply.  Get a 50 lb bag for less than $20.    We've used a couple different brands and haven't noticed a bit of difference in the health of the birds.

BackYardChickens,3c1d30,jrwreno,11,Fri Jul 3 21:43:02 2015 UTC,"It is perfectly natural, and nothing can really prevent it, because it often is due to a small defect or rip in the chicken's oviduct. Perhaps ensure low stress, plenty of calcium/water/and comfy nest boxes?"

BackYardChickens,3c0jqo,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"Take a look under the ear feathers, is there goop and nasty built up in her ear? Then it might be an ear infection. Clean away the gunk and drip some peroxide in there, then pack it with non medicated neosporin. Then give her a round of vitamins to boost her immune system.  Note that if it is an ear infection or wry neck she will be more prone to it in the future. But that doesn't look like an ear infection to me. My baby walked with his head tiled when he had an ear infection. That I'm sorry to say looks like something else. It could be Newcastles, wry neck or Mercks."

BackYardChickens,3c0jqo,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"That looks like Wry-neck, unless she has some paralysis in her legs or nerve jitters. You can solve this by giving her immediate vitamins, the best being Nutridrench (because it is vitamins mixed with sugar, which the stomach immediately absorbs).  If she has more nerve issues, it may be New Castle or Mareks, which you need to immediately quarantine her for.   I would kennel her, and get her vitamins right away. If the vitamins do not address her issues quickly (like in 48-72 hrs) then it is likely END or Mareks virus."
BackYardChickens,3c0jqo,LadyDarkKitten,0,Fri Jul 3 21:48:10 2015 UTC,No nerve jitters and the legs seem to be working well. We're working on the assumption it's wry neck. I'll try Nutridrench. THanks for that. And thanks for taking the time to answer.
BackYardChickens,3c0jqo,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:13:58 2015 UTC,"Looks like wry neck, but its uncommon in adult chickens. Could also he Mareks, but once again, rare to see symptoms in birds older than 6 months.  A head injury is also a distinct possibility.

If they peck you it might sting for a short time, but I half the time don't even notice due to being used to it. I think it's more just your worry about them pecking, once you actually find out how hard they peck it won't be so bad. Chickens usually do test pecks on something, so you won't get them to go all out on you unless your fingers are covered in food."
BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,Thunder_god1987,2,Fri Jul 3 13:55:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, good to know.  Thanks very much!"
BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,Aerron,3,Fri Jul 3 14:50:09 2015 UTC,I've had two birds peck at me out of annoyance and several peck while eating food out of my hand.  It stings a tiny bit.  Probably like getting pinched by  a clothespin.
BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,Forlarren,4,Fri Jul 3 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"It's kind of funny too.  I'LL KILL YOU, *peck*. LOL  But I live in Hawaii and aggressive roosters are childhood friends here, just fun and games."
BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,Mycd,10,Fri Jul 3 19:37:37 2015 UTC,"Haha, yes they will peck absolutely. Its their main way of interacting with the world. It can hurt too, especially if they grab a little flap of skin.  That said, I feed all my hens by hand daily. They nip me a lot, but it's expected and pretty adorable. At worst, it's a bit of a sting, nothing close to a real bite or bloody mess - and they don't do it intentionally per se.   Small children and those with tender velvety skin may get a tiny bruise, but an average adult should be able to take dozens of pecks without any real physical discomfort (or visible injury).   Don't be chicken! Stick your hand down there cupping some treats and let them peck away."
BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,StrawberryCupcakess,3,Fri Jul 3 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"Same thing for me!   I notice that my ex-batt hens peck harder because they had slightly snipped upper beaks, but even then it's a tolerable feeling. They'll peck at my wedding ring and my nails if they're painted."
BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,voldemortoutbitches,7,Fri Jul 3 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"They do peck but in my experience, they general they don't do it maliciously and generally just wanna see what's up with my clothes or nail polish. Personally the pecks don't bother me - scratches are my main area of concern since I am very hands on with my chickens and sharp talons inevitably scratch anytime they come in contact with bare skin. The scratches aren't purposeful either, just another hazard with owning birds that think arms are for perching  That said, I am convinced that my sweet Rhode Island Red knows that pecking hurts me, because she is always very gentle when taking food out of my hands."
BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,Cedora,4,Fri Jul 3 16:01:58 2015 UTC,"I hand feed chickens all the time and it doesn't hurt at all! It basically feels like pressure hitting your hand very quickly so it could be startling if you're not expecting it. I've never felt that their beaks are very sharp or that they could hurt me. I grew up with chickens though, and my husband who didn't refuses to hand feed them. We'll see how that changes as we just got him his own little flock of chicks. :) I would suggest trying to hand feed them; It's fun and they love treats!

Some hens, like broody hens, can peck more hard. I have also had grumpy laying hens complain and peck.   You can only desensitize yourself by allowing it to happen, and realizing it is not so bad."

BackYardChickens,3bzpvr,JaberJaw1978,2,Fri Jul 3 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"You have to remember it will only hurt or do any damage if they peck your had when it is against something hard.  Your open hand will only move when they peck you.  My 7 and 3 year old are in charge of our birds,  they only get hurt when they are pecked on the foot or knee.  Unless you have an aggressive chicken they are pecking out of curiosity.  Even when they are scared they will peck and run most if the time."

This morning we discovered that one of our 2 week old chicks had slipped through a teeny crack in the fencing and must have gotten her leg stuck in a trap. I don't think it's broken, but there's a rather large section of skin on her upper leg that has been completely detached. Cleaned it, dried it, sprayed it with Blu-Kote, and hoping for recovery.

BackYardChickens,3bxhlc,tokitorii,3,Thu Jul 2 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"His feet are only partially feathered but his muff (face feathers) is pretty full and his comb looks to be a pea comb. My diagnosis, he's a mutt. He could be any number of breeds and with out knowing where he came from its impossible to tell  The important thing is feeding. For just one rooster it would be easiest to do what I do, go to your local health food store and buy bulk whole grains. My babies get 2 scoops Brown Flax, 1 scoops white wheat, 1 scoop red wheat, 1 1/2 scoop hulled buckwheat, 1 scoop sesame seeds, 2 scoops lintles or split peas. I get them millet too but you can skip that and get a small bag of bird seed from walmart or something. The bag of bird seed will have millet and black oiled sunflower seeds among other things, I usually get a small bag of cracked corn to mix the other grains into but the bird seed should be fine for now. A small can of unsalted peanuts, for the selenium and magnesium. You'll need to supplement animal proteins too, go to the reptile section of walmart (or any pet store) and grab a container of freeze dried meal worms or crikets. Throw him 2 handfulls, my guy only eats one but your bird is bigger and under weight. As long as he's outside he can supplement his own greens and probably most of his animal proteins too. Otherwise he'll need leftover salad stuff.  Why do I suggest this complicated mess? There's a couple of reasons. Reason one, this is a rooster so you can't just go buy a bag of scratch (not enough vitamins and protein) or a bag of layer feed (Too much Calcium). Reason two, you could buy a bag of Rooster Booster or CockFeed but it would be 20lbs. So one of two things would happen, you would need to give it to who ever the bird goes to. Not a bad option by any means but expensive, depending on where you are a bag of cockfeed can be anywhere from $15 to $40! Or it would go bad before he could eat it all, especially if you have trouble placing him. The cost of what I laid out is roughly $25 a month, thats the bulk grains, the bird seed, the peanuts and the meal worms and I live in Hawaii everything is more expensive here. Depending on where you are it may very well be much cheaper, but it shouldn't be more than that. Bonus no moldy grains making your roo sick.  It takes my two bantams 2 months to go through the bulk grains and 1lb of cracked corn, roughly 2lb of feed. The peanuts and the meal worms supplement their diet. I would also give him a vitamin boost, just to start him off on the right foot. If you have someone in the office with kids a Flinstones vitamin crushed into yogurt or something like that will do him some good. I would also give him some B vits to boost the vitamins hes getting from the other food.  I have been caring for a small roo for the last 5 years, I have learned a lot. Let me know if there's anything I can do."
BackYardChickens,3bxhlc,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"I'll see if I can get a better picture of his feet and his comb, the outside of his legs and feet have black feathers on them (it looks like this but not as nice because he is kind of scraggely). As for his comb, he doesn't even have 3 nubs, he just has a single nub on top of his head. We were only concerned in case that had something to do with age/sexual maturity. Like I said, we know nothing about them. Also he is a big guy, about 2 ft tall - I don't know if you can tell from the pictures- and his breast bone is very prominent when felt, which is why we were worried he was under weight.   Those feeding instructions are great, we live in a fairly suburban area and getting to a feed store isn't the easiest. I will certainly look into those grains! Do you just lay down a little feed in the morning or just let the rooster free feed?"
BackYardChickens,3bxhlc,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:34:19 2015 UTC,"Just toss a couple of hand fulls in the grass when you get to work in the morning and he'll free range the rest of the day. Since your keeping him by the drainage pond he'll probably be getting enough animal protein from frogs, bugs and what have you. But the dried meal worms and peanuts will be a good source of calories for him, the peanuts have essential vitamins. With no competition and a good steady source of food he should bulk up in a month or so.   Most feather footed birds have lots of feathers, like this guy here. The feathers support each other and help prevent breakage, birds with thin feathering on the feet are always mutts. Given the foot feathers, blue feet and small comb I think /u/GallusLafayetti is right, he's some kind of EE cross.  As for his comb, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with it, most people are familiar with the single comb but there are lots of different formations. That's not even all of them, but it gives you an idea. Now for his weight, I think this will give you a better idea of weather or not your roo has a good body index. Basically for a fit bird there should be some meat on the sides of the keel (breast bone) but you should still be able to feel the keel. If you can feel his rib bones he needs extra protein added to his diet, meal worms and peanuts baby! Just remember to get unsalted peanuts."
BackYardChickens,3bxhlc,GallusLafayetti,3,Fri Jul 3 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"That right there is a cross, with heavy influences of Easter Egger blood. Given the coloration, hard feathering, and the popularity of the cross, he very well may have resulted from a cross of Black Copper Marans and Easter Egger, in an attempt to create olive-egging birds.  He may or may not be underweight. Most hatchery stock breeds (probably what he's been bred from) have very light builds, without any broadness to their breasts at all. You should weigh him; if he was at a proper weight, he ought to weigh 5-8 pounds. You should also feel the keel (breastbone) - it should be shaped rather like a wedge.  Your local feed store should carry basic laying pellets or crumble. If you find that he's at a good weight, they should suit him fine. If he's underweight, ask for a non-medicated grower feed, which should contain around 18% protein and help him bulk up.  Have you checked him for mites/lice yet? Wandering birds are prone to them. Grab him, carefully turn him upside down and hold him by his legs, and spread the feathers right beneath his vent and in the surrounding area. If you see any crawling bugs or clumps composed of tiny white dots sticking to the feathers, you should buy some permethrin powder and dust him thoroughly."
BackYardChickens,3bxhlc,KnifehandHolsters,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"We figured he might be a mutt, but were hoping for some guess so maybe we could know if the comb issue was a breed characteristic or a sexual maturity thing or something else all together. We know nothing.   When we felt him, his breast bone was heavily prominent which was why we were concerned about his weight. I know you should feel it, but should it have a good layer of muscle on it? Or should it stick out? As for weight, he is roughly about 2 ft tall, you think he ought to weigh about 5-8lbs? We have plenty of scales so we can weigh him.   We will check him for mites/lice today, I had not thought about that! Can we use permethrin spray instead of dust? We have quite a bit of that at the clinic, we can always buy dust if need be though."
BackYardChickens,3bxhlc,GallusLafayetti,3,Fri Jul 3 11:39:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. I use permethrin spray on mine. He can also be dipped in it if he is heavily infested. I get a 10% permethrin concentrate and put a little short of an ounce per gallon of water. Same ratio to the spray, a little shy of a quarter ounce per quart spray bottle. Same as anything, keep it from his eyes. If you dip him, try to gently squeeze the water from his tail feathers and wrap him in a towel to keep him warm and dry him. Good time for hand feeding treats as well.   He will also happily eat salad greens, bananas, melon, cooked oatmeal, etc. They make good treats that are readily available most anywhere."

Don't use any fast movements until they are willing to eat out of your hand. After that you can grab them and cup them in both your hands.. If you do this a certain way, they'll fall asleep in your hands. Give them meal worms or some treats and when you do this, use like a saying ""come here"" or whatnot so they know that means treats. Usually this will tame them down a bit but when they're older sometimes personalities change.

Its his favourite way to sleep. We just don't know what he is and I want to show him at our state fair for fun. He has the greenish sheen which makes me think Giant Australorp but I read they have white bottoms to their feet. Does this count as a white bottom? Please help!"
BackYardChickens,3bu57o,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"What does he weigh? As a general rule, Australorps should weigh around 8 pounds, whereas Jersey Giants can be upwards of 10."
BackYardChickens,3bsvya,MelonHeadSeb,5,Wed Jul 1 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Hose down the yard every morning. Make sure all dirt gets soaked. If you're home to do it, twice a day is even better. Frozen water bottles work great. Put them in a shady area. Misters are incredibly helpful. Stick them on a hose and put them a few feet away from wherever your birds hang out the most. But make sure the hose is not in the sun, or you'll just be spraying your birds with scalding water. Frozen treats are awesome. If you have any mushy fruits or veggies you're planning on feeding them, stick them in the freezer the night before. They'll pick off them through the day as they thaw. Watermelon is especially a favorite. Ice cubes in the water really help as well. I've also heard of success dunking the chickens in a bucket of water. I can't define the validity of this method since I have 150 birds and neither the time nor patience to attempt dunking each one of them, but I imagine it would be a good measure during the hottest part of the day."

My chickens like grapes from the fridge and fresh cold water in their drinker a couple times a day. Try to shade the coop. One of those things you put on your car windshield to deflect the Sun's rays is a good tip. Someone suggested a cooked - then frozen - corn on the cob, which I've yet to try, but know for sure the chickens will love it."

And like the others said, shade, cold fruits/veg/water. Someone elsewhere suggested frozen water bottles to lay next to but my girls were never interested. Someone else said the got a swamp cooler and hooked it up to a solar power system for the chickens. I've never tried a frozen corn cob before, might have to once the harvest comes in!

The guy that I got them from said that the father is a Faverolles, but he isn't sure if the mom is Welsummer or Speckled Sussex.  The more I observe them, the more convinced I am that the greyish one is Welsummer and the other 2 brownish ones are Speckled Sussex?  The 2 brownies seem to cling closer to each other and are a little noisier than the greyish one.  Also, the greyish one is a lot more adventurous and is willing to come far closer than the other 2 for treats.  Does this theory seem to hold any water?"
BackYardChickens,3bs49u,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"Mottled/Spangled genes (such as those of the Sussex) usually show through pretty strong, so I would expect to see more spotting in the case of a Sussex cross. What I'm seeing here (with the exception of the middle bird in picture #1) is stippling, striping, and a general wild-type pattern - characteristic of the Welsummer.  My educated guesses:   Grey: Most likely Welsummer/Faverolles cross. Darker Brown: Given the slight spangling across the shoulders and rump, I would say she's a Sussex/Faverolles cross. Lighter Brown: Lack of spangling and messy wildtype pattern suggests Welsummer/Faverolles cross."

BackYardChickens,3bnvz0,whatsreallygoingon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:28:11 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of issues with this plan. I'll give you the answer to the original question you asked, but I ask that you listen very carefully to the information following it.  I recommend Denagard. It's one of the strongest meds available for the most common respiratory ailments, Mycoplasma synoviae and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. It is, however, expensive, and considered off-label. It's technically a swine medication, but can be adminstered to poultry at a rate of 1.5tsp/gallon of drinking water, to be changed every day. It's usually available as a 1 liter bottle, 12.5% solution, which will cost you about $40. This is not guaranteed to fix the symptoms; respiratory diseases are very tricky and can be quite stubborn. Sometimes they can even appear to be treated, but later return. However, DG it is you best bet. Note that it can also be used in conjunction with Gallimycin or Terramycin for increased effectiveness.  Now listen to me. It is not a cure. Nearly all respiratory diseases are incurable. This doesn't mean they are a death sentence; birds can recover from symptoms and show no signs of illness. However, they will be carriers for life. As long as they live, they will shed the virus or bacterium, infecting any birds they come into contact with.  I say with certainty that if you introduce them to your existing flock, the rest of your birds will become infected. As will any chicks you hatch or buy. The only way to ever remove it from your flock would be to do a complete cull, burn the carcasses, and bleach the grounds. If these birds are allowed to join you current flock, the property will become infected. Any wild bird who passes by, or backyard flock down the road, is liable to become a biohazard. You will never be able to take your birds anywhere, rehome them, show them, etc. You absolutely must bleach your shoes after entering your coop, or maintain a dedicated pair for use inside your coop, lest you track the disease into the local feed store, to be picked up and spread.  I highly, highly recommend that you return the birds to the breeder. You have a chance right now to keep your own flock healthy, and let me tell you, as someone who has a flock carrying multiple incurable diseases (including one of the ones your new birds are most likely suffering from), I would give anything - anything - to go back in time and never bring in the birds that infected my flock. Hell, if I could do such a thing, I would undoubtedly have top-quality show stock by now and ideally be bringing in quite a lot of cash from my hatches and extras. Instead, I am left with a hobby flock, the meat, eggs, and chicks of which can never be sold, and birds who die monthly of a disease which does not always react to medication.  By the way, I would highly appreciate if you could message me the name of the hatchery/breeder who sold you these birds. Even if it is a isolated incident and the rest of their stock is clean, I would like to at least be aware of who they are, as I order from many different hatcheries every year, large and small alike, and would appreciate knowing who I may need to be wary of."
BackYardChickens,3bnvz0,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jul 1 04:38:24 2015 UTC,Wow. This is both fascinating and terrifying.
BackYardChickens,3bnvz0,whatsreallygoingon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"ughh...I know you're right, I've also read that they will always be carriers no matter what, just like you are saying. I think I'll try to return them, even though I might be in the dog house for a few days with the kids. The breeder said we could exchange them, but I'm not sure I want any more birds from them after this. I also want to make sure the quarantine coop is fully sanitized before acquiring new birds anyway.   I didn't want to name the farm outright, but the thing that bothers me is I still see them advertising on Craigslist in the area, as well as pet and farm supply stores in the area. They even had the balls to say the new birds didn't need a quarantine before adding to existing flock. I insisted anyway...I'll send you a PM with their info."
BackYardChickens,3bnvz0,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"They suggested that their birds didn't require a quarantine? Uh, jesus... that's just bad information. Even if I was buying from an NPIP breeder of the highest recommendation, I would still quarantine. It's just good practice.  Yeah, bleach down everything the birds touched, then leave it empty for 3-4 weeks. If I recall correctly, that's about how long it takes for hostless respiratory diseases to die off."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,okayimback,2,Tue Jun 30 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"The oyster shells are a source of calcium and are crushed to a size that they can eat. If you've got a calcium rich shell that's the right size, it should work.  All chickens love shade, as they descend from jungle fowl. Most any birds should do well there, so long as you don't have predator problems or something. If you want a tougher more self-defending bird, think dark cornish. Plus they taste delicious and lay pretty well."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,OtisB,2,Tue Jun 30 19:25:01 2015 UTC,"Oyster shells are usually used because they are rich in calcium. If mussel or clam shells have the same calcium content, I can't see why not, although I can't say that they would be any cheaper than oyster shell.  Trust me, grass will not be there once you put the chickens in. They will turn it to flat dirt within a couple months of being there, shorter or longer depending on how big the run is.  I recommend Barred Rocks, Sex Links, Ameraucanas, and Brahmas. I also recommend you get at least one flighty breed, such as a Leghorn or Hamburg, so that you can determine what type of bird you like. Here is the wiki I wrote up on common breeds, with all their basic stats."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jul 1 04:16:14 2015 UTC,"I vote for a Brown Leghorn. Mine is the surrogate rooster. She leads the others around and scratches like a machine.   They are said to be flighty, but she's remarkably bold (especially considering what she's been through); and is the one who will try anything and take food directly from my hand. Very quiet, and a egg layer, too!"
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,whatsreallygoingon,2,Wed Jul 1 13:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've always liked the Brown Leghorns more than the White Leghorns. Which is saying something, because I'm not a Leghorn fan. It's not that there's anything wrong with them, per say - I just hate the personality. I don't really mind flighty birds so much, but to me Leghorns have always seemed more like they're mindlessly frightened of everything, rather than the attitude of, say, a Hamburg, who more just doesn't want to be touched, and would rather do their own thing. But I suggest them to people, since they're one of the most common flighty breeds, great utiliterian birds, and my dislike for them is really just a personal bias."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I'd always heard that they were flighty, but mine is not. She isn't cuddly (but none of my hens want to be handled), but she's very practical and is the first to come running when it looks like I have treats. I guess I just got a good one. I actually considered having her bred and raising up a couple of her progeny, to try and perpetuate her temperament."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,whatsreallygoingon,2,Wed Jul 1 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"Mine were always very flighty. I had 4 or 5 a couple years back, they were undoubtedly my best egg producers but I really disliked them, so to freezer camp they went.  You must just have a pleasant one."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:41:52 2015 UTC,I guess mine is unusual.  Did you eat them? They don't seem to be very meaty.
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,whatsreallygoingon,2,Thu Jul 2 01:59:41 2015 UTC,"I did eat them. I eat all my culls, even the ones with little meat. Although though the legs were quite stringy, they made good use in stock, and the breasts, small though they were, were plenty tender enough for baking or frying. The combs, hearts, and livers went to the collection that builds up in my freezer until I find a use for them or have enough for a recipe."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"The combs? Learned something new. Never heard of eating the combs. Good on you!   I'm still struggling with the eventuality that I'll have to put one of mine down. I'm determined to be a true urban homesteader, though; and will power through it, one way or another."
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,whatsreallygoingon,2,Thu Jul 2 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"Most people don't, but I use them in a lovely recipe for candied cockscombs. They taste quite a bit like gummy candy, and I'm looking forward to the next time I'm collected enough to make a batch.  It's an unpleasant process, but it's also a valuable experience. You should always autopsy the body afterwards, even if you know what killed/injured your bird. Since I had to do my first cull (and especially since I began raising meat birds and eating my extras) I have learned a lot of information about how chickens are put together, and can say with certainty that there are many circumstances in which I would have been unable to save a bird's life had I not been intimately familiar with their anatomy; this is what I consider one of my greatest gains from raising meat fowl, in addition to the good fresh meat, giblets, and offal I can put away, as well as the uses of the skins and carcass remains."

The mussel and clam shells are free since I work in a restaurant kitchen where we cook off our shellfish at the end of every work week. We also have oysters, but only once in a blue moon.  Barred Rocks and Ameraucanas were both on my radar, but not the other ones. Thank you!"
BackYardChickens,3bnuep,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jul 1 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"Well, see if you can find the calcium content of then shellfish vs. oyster shells. I'm sure you can find the numbers somewhere online. If they seem comparable, then I can't think of any reason why they shouldn't suffice.  Barred Rocks and Ameraucanas are both lovely birds, as are most common breeds.  And Brahmas - they're undoubtedly the sweetest birds I've ever had the pleasure of owning or working with. If you want a really friendly bird who's also a good (not fantastic, but certainly good) layer, definitely buy a couple of Brahmas. The only birds I can tell you to steer clear from are Polish and any kind of bantam. They can be lovely birds, but they come unsexed, so you are liable to get roosters. Oh, and Rhode Island Reds. They're not bad birds per say, but avoid getting more than 1-2 of them. In larger numbers, they may form a ""gang"", and feather pick the other breeds of chickens.

BackYardChickens,3bnuep,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jul 1 14:49:14 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! It's The Poultry Palace, in El Dorado county. We (I work there part time, but I swear I'm not just biased because I'm an employee - I was a customer there for years before the owner offered me a little work a few days a week) - We sell feed (Bar Ale brand, the best feed available), 8-12 week old pullets, chicks ranging from 3 days to 2 weeks, feeders, waterers, supplies, bedding, and everything else you might need, including really knowledgeable staff (especially the owner, and he's there pretty much every day) in case you ever have any questions about your flock. We also give a 100% female guarantee (if it turns out to be a boy, you can bring it back!) and a 1 month health guarantee on all our birds.  We're open all days of the week except for Monday."

BackYardChickens,3bnuep,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:07:01 2015 UTC,"You are very welcome! Trust me, it's the worth the drive - there's nowhere else you can buy everything you need in one place, plus get all the helpful information we're willing to give out.  That's why a lot of people buy pullets from us! They're either brand new and have heard pullets are easier, or they've been keeping for a while and they know pullets are easier.  We have a huge variety of breeds, too - right now we've got remaining Barred Rocks, Rhode Island Reds, Delawares, and a single Black Copper Maran from earlier this month, and sometime this week (probably Friday or Saturday) we're getting a huge batch of breeds in - Ameraucanas, Dominiques, more Barred Rocks, Sex Links (can't remember right now if they're Golden or Black), Blue Laced Red Wyandottes, and probably a few other breeds."

BackYardChickens,3bkgnm,whatsreallygoingon,6,Mon Jun 29 23:21:01 2015 UTC,"Mind if I ask how you dispatched them?   I adore tiny rodents, and have rescued both rats and squirrels in the past. These were hairless and still had their eyes closed; so I knew there was no hope of my saving them. I used a thin piece of wood, from a privacy fence project, and quickly decapitated them. Then, I chopped them up into smaller pieces for easier digestion.   It wasn't pleasant, but I've had to put numerous creatures out of their misery, and it's gotten easier over time.  The saddest part was that the momma just came down and looked around the fallen nest for them. Nature is harsh sometimes..."
BackYardChickens,3bkgnm,cheese_on_rye,8,Tue Jun 30 00:11:03 2015 UTC,"Just for future knowledge: squirrels have an intense maternal instinct and will come back for babies who fallen out of a nest, even if its been several hours since they fell. Age of the babies doesn't matter either- pink and blind or fuzzy and eyes open. They build several nests in their territories, so they have a place to relocate to if a storm blows their current one down. If you find babies in the future that have not been severely injured, you can put them in an open box with some leaves/rags/towels, and leave them close to the base of a tree nearby. Momma will come back for them.  Source: volunteered at a nature center and worked as an Animal Control Officer for 2+ years. Just FYI :)"
BackYardChickens,3bkgnm,cheese_on_rye,3,Tue Jun 30 00:17:02 2015 UTC,"Baby birds blown out of nests or destroyed bird nests are alot harder to help then squirrels. Usually there are only two real courses of action, provided the babies have not sustained any injuries.   A. Construct an artificial nest from a plastic berry basket, tupperware container with drainage holes punched into the bottom, or actual wicker basket and fill with grasses, dryer lint, feathers, or even a towel and place back in the tree/shrub as close to the original location as possible. Momma bird will continue to raise her young untill they are old enough to fledge. Once fledged, babies will stick by in the area, hopping about, learning to fly and hunt on their own while mom feeds them on a regular basis.   Contrary to popular belief, wild birds do not just kick the babies out and boom they are magically adults- they also go through a teenage/college kid phase where they are awkward, scruffy and simply terrible at flying further then a few feet (Yall probably already know about the awkward teenage years :P). Mom is still there keeping an eye on them and feeding them until they can care for themselves.  B. Contact your local Animal Control or Wildlife rehab facility and let them deal with the rehabilitation.   Sorry if this was way more then you care about knowing. Once I get going its hard to stop talking about animals hehe :D"
BackYardChickens,3bkgnm,cheese_on_rye,2,Tue Jun 30 00:27:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That's good to know; and is something that I will keep in mind. Kudos to you for your service to helpless creatures!  I seriously contemplated this possibility as the events unfolded.  The factors that prompted my actions were:   A. It was still raining, and the temperature had dropped by 20 degrees.   B. The entire nest was on the ground; so it was unlikely that she had a place to keep them (Now I know better).   C. The hens had already been pecking away at them, for who knows how long, before I made the discovery.   I knew that it would be hard on the mother to lose them, but I figured that they would suffer more when she tried to save them, considering the circumstances."

BackYardChickens,3bjhaq,CTRL_Y,2,Mon Jun 29 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"Welcome! It is totally possible to do a portable run for this and some people do. I actually have an issue of Practical Poultry laying around with just such a run in it that is awesome and can easily be taken apart, have panels added, be made any shape that is necessary, etc, and I can see if I can find it for you if you'd like.  It shouldn't be difficult to move them from the permanent structure to the portable one as long as they are friendly enough, and you could also lure them with treats - mine will go anywhere for treats. You can free range, but with only an acre it's very possible they would decide to visit your neighbors too, so you'd have to make sure they were okay with that. Plus, as you said, you're risking predators.I free range because I have a guard dog and seven acres, but it's not for everybody.  I actually wouldn't recommend any prefab coops - most times they are tiny and built with sub-par materials, and advertise that they can hold a lot more birds than they really can. You could easily build something that looks just as nice for a fraction of the cost, or even hire a local builder. A lot of times people advertise on craigslist that they will build chicken coops to order, so you may check there. You might also find someone selling a very nice used coop, too. Here's a great resource of many coops to give you some ideas: http://www.backyardchickens.com/atype/2/Coops"

I sometimes transport them to my fenced in backyard which is about 30 yards from my coop so they can get some fresh grass, and I can tell you, it's a pain in the butt. Some of my flock comes to me willingly and is fine being carried back and forth but not all, and it's not necessarily a matter of taming them, it's just that different personalities and breeds don't act like puppies. I only do this once a week or so at the most, it's definitely not something I'd ever want to do every day."

BackYardChickens,3bjhaq,spotpig,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend a combination of coop and portable tractor. Having experience, if you have to take the chickens out and put them somewhere during the day, you might do that for a month, maybe two, but eventually you'll just have these portable tractors sitting around your yard not doing anything.  Building a tractor isn't difficult, but it's much easier to build a decent, large coop. Virginia is probably barely too cold for a simple, no house coop (where you just build roosts under cover over the run), but you could build a bunch of different permanent coop structures or tractors fairly easily depending on which you want more.   A good tractor is more complex, less secure, but can be a little smaller because the chickens regularly get new areas to scratch. OTOH, a simple coop + run is easy to build can be large enough for a lot of birds safely, and if you want, you can fence in a larger area around the coop sometime down the road to provide them with decent free ranging."

BackYardChickens,3bh0h3,dlev_,4,Mon Jun 29 03:41:22 2015 UTC,Ok some of her symptoms sound broody others sound like calcium deficiency. I would first take care of her bum. You can use a warm damp washcloth clean away what you can and then clip very carefully the feathers around her bum. This will keep her from getting poop in them and getting it clumped on.   I would ask how long has this diarrhea lasted? Was it one massive squirty poop or has it been going constantly over a longer period of time. If it was a massive gross runny poo it's likely she was evacuating from sitting broody in her nest for awhile if it's a lot over time then yep diarrhea. For the diarrhea I would give her some vitamins and electrolytes in her water. You can pick them up at any Tractor Supply or get some online. If you can't do that some gatoraid or pedialyte will help.  For the soft shell I would make sure I was giving her layer feed and oyster shell or some other calcium supplement.    Belly feathers being pulled and stopping laying are symptoms of broodiness. Is she sitting a lot?
BackYardChickens,3bh0h3,uliarliarpantsonfire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:07:10 2015 UTC,"She has a small yellowish scab on the belly.  The diarrhea is new, but she hasn't been laying solid shell eggs for a couple of months already - few eggs with very fragile shell, some no shell, mostly not laying.  The feathers around her butt are dirty.  She lives with 3 sisters and the other ones are doing great and seem happy."
BackYardChickens,3bh0h3,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"Looks kinda like she picked out her belly feathers to brood. Hens who are brooding will also not lay. Have you noticed her sitting on the nest a lot recently?  Otherwise, I would be concerned that it may be an intestinal or nutritional issue. Do you supplement with oyster shell? If not, you should begin doing so. What kind of feed do you feed? Some poor quality feeds can result in birds who fail to thrive or lay well.  Buy some yogurt and Sav-A-Chick probiotics for her; they could help clear up the diarrhea.  In the meantime, you should cage her, somewhere quiet and not too hot or cold. Laundry rooms or garages work well. A dog crate lined with old towels will do."
BackYardChickens,3bh0h3,Lawdogg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:57:05 2015 UTC,"Good advice above. One other thing i would add. She looks like she has vent gleet, aka nasty butt. Put a little apple cider vinegar in the water (1 tsp per gallon) and give her some plain yogurt to eat."
BackYardChickens,3bgli9,spillsomepaint,5,Mon Jun 29 01:19:57 2015 UTC,"For their first 2-3 days, they should spend the whole time inside the coop alone, not the small run. This will teach them where home is, and where to roost at night. After that, I suggest another few days in the small run and the coop, before you allow to them free-range. Right now, they're just scared and stressed in their new environment, and not sure where to roost or sleep yet. Be sure to keep things as quiet and stress-free as possible. Throw some scratch, meal worms, or other treats out a couple times a day."

BackYardChickens,3bgli9,chingchongtong,2,Mon Jun 29 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"Depends. If the coop is well ventilated and shaded enough that it's going to be 100 degrees whether they're inside or outside, then there's not much reason not to.  In 100 degree weather, they do need special care. Frozen water bottles are great for keeping them cool, as are frozen treats (i.e. did that watermelon from the store turn out to be kinda sour? Throw it in the freezer, and give it to them in the morning! They'll peck off it through the day, as it thaws). Ice cubes in their water can be a good measure too.  Is your coop one of these styles? If so, you should also spray the lower wire-enclosed area with water."
BackYardChickens,3bgli9,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:45:14 2015 UTC,With that type of temp I think it would depend on the configuration of your coop and how much shade it gets. If it gets a bit of shade and has a pretty big access door that you could keep open and affix fencing of some type (those big break down dog crates work well) to keep it heavily ventilated during the day.
BackYardChickens,3bgli9,Meticulous_Gardener,2,Mon Jun 29 06:31:32 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the fun of teaching new members of the flock where they are supposed to sleep.  Go out there right at dark, or a bit after and put them in the coop, shut it up so they can't get out.  In the morning, a couple hours after sunrise but not more than an hour or two, let them out.  Rinse, repeat, until they get the message."

BackYardChickens,3beof8,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:19:47 2015 UTC,What makes you think he's a rooster?? I have 7 chicks now that were labeled pullets... but they are always wrong! My only hint is watching their tail feathers to see if any start to form a fountain.
BackYardChickens,3beof8,mommyandlove,2,Mon Jun 29 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"Well, he's holding his tail and head very high, which are typically signs of a cockerel. However, I wouldn't say he's definitely a boy yet. The comb is pretty henny.  By the time roosters develop their sickle (curled) feathers, you'll know it's a boy. More reliable methods are examining the comb, wattles, stance, voice (roosters have a raspy tone), and ""tail-flipping"". I keep meaning to make a damn post with a video of this method, since it's not well known, but I've forgotten thus far. Basically, you need to hold the bird at chest level, with it's head facing you. Your thumbs should be on it's hip bones, and your pinkie and ring finger should be on either side of each leg. Hold it until it's completely relaxed, they quickly (quickly!) flip it so it's butt is completely in the air and it's head is straight down. I usually do it three times, or until I'm sure I'm getting the right response. It's not 100% (I'd say... 70%), but hens will flip their tails up and fan the feathers. Boys will keep the tail where it is, not flipping or fanning.  Hatcheries are usually right - I see a lot of pullets go through my workplace, and I would say that the 95% accuracy label they have is pretty correct - but occasionally, a rooster gets missed."

BackYardChickens,3bbnor,Bentonkb,7,Sun Jun 28 02:22:33 2015 UTC,"Very rarely, twins will hatch. Typically, however, either one chick is absorbed by the other, or they get to large to continue growing, and die off before hatching.  I actually have a twin guinea egg in my incubator right now. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any movement in a few candlings, so it looks like both embryos have died. However, they did at least make it to 10-14 days, which was more than I was expecting."

A single chicken can be herded. Given that my day job is literally catching and boxing pullets for our customers, I've learned how to use my body to make them go where I want them to go. I know exactly how far to lean to the side to make them switch direction, where to put my arms to make them think the exit is blocked, and exactly where that hen is going to jump into the air to escape being boxed into a corner. Although I have no clue if a dog could do it.  By the way, these are some great bantam breeds you should definitely look into:   Silkie Serama Japanese Bantam Ko Shamo (only available from breeders and can be costly, but absolutely worth it) Old English Gamefowl Frizzle of pretty much any breed Cornish Bantam Hamburgs (usually sold as standard, but even standards are a very small breed, only a bit larger than Silkies) Bantam True Ameraucana (because who doesn't want adorable tiny blue eggs!?)

I've heard they are a little...slow but I just assume that's because of the feathers in the eyes.  I've never heard of Old English Gamefowl or Frizzle anybird, what are they?"
BackYardChickens,3bcqyg,GallusLafayetti,2,Sun Jun 28 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"Silkies are great fun. Occasionally, if one super fluffy, they'll bump into things, but it doesn't really happen often. They're just very calm, sweet little birds. Even roosters are incredibly tame and docile.  Images of Old English Games. They're a gamefowl breed, which means their original purpose was fighting. They were developed in England as a standard breed (4-7 pounds) throughout the Middle Ages. When cockfighting was outlawed in the mid 1800s, breeders began to select for exhibition quality birds, and the bantamized version was developed. Today there are one of the most popular showing breeds, since they are very tame and their small size makes them easy to handle. The only drawback is that roosters cannot be kept with other roosters, as cocks of gamefowl breeds are likely to fight and injure each other.  Frizzle is a feather type. It means that the feathers curl upwards rather than laying flat. Example. It's most often seen in Polish, Silkies, Japanese Bantams, and Cochins, however it can be breed into any bird by crossing. There is also a breed known as the Frizzle - however, they are more or less frizzled Cochins sold under a different name. It's similar to how there are chickens who display the Silkie gene, and then there are actual Silkies."

BackYardChickens,3bcqyg,spotpig,2,Sun Jun 28 17:11:11 2015 UTC,Chickens split. But Runner Ducks are pretty cool for herding.
BackYardChickens,3bcqyg,SchipAlong,2,Sun Jun 28 12:49:12 2015 UTC,"I tried herding my large chickens with my Schipperke (miniature shepherd), but they just scatter lol. My bantams do seem to flock a bit better though, and they follow me when I walk around. Sometimes though one will get distracted and break away from the group, and I think there's a small chance of training a herding dog to move the stragglers back in line. That's as close as it gets to herding chickens though, and I think a dog would need to be trained on easier stock first to have the self control not to spook the chickens. Ducks are much better because they naturally flock together rather than scatter. Call ducks are mini, super adorable, and somewhat popular for herding already. Those might be worth looking into. They're called Calls for a reason though, and the females especially can be quite noisy.  Edit: Also that's not a silly dream at all. One of the reasons I chose Barbu d'Anvers chickens was to have mini Belgian chickens to go with my mini Belgian shepherd lol."

Ducks will, runners and cayugas are considered good flocking ducks.   I was hoping to do the same with my dog, at 9 months she still isn't trained enough to keep good distance from the poultry, so it does take a long time. You would also want to make sure the corgi is from a working line so would have strong herding instincts.

The encounter had happened less than 20 minutes prior. My husband was home and went out to see what was going on because the hens were on the fence making a lot of noise.   This is the first time in a year on our property that a fox has come around during the day while we are on the property.

BackYardChickens,3bced2,Cancer-Cheater,3,Sat Jun 27 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I work at a poultry specialty store where we sell 8 week old pullets, so I give out this advice almost daily.  First, you should definitely get two, if possible. Introducing a single hen to multiple birds is a bad idea.  They should have an introduction period of at least 2 weeks, preferably 3-4. I wouldn't feel comfortable introducing 4 week olds to 8 week olds, especially with two Rhode Islands in your older flock; they are a notoriously picky breed. The ideal age would be between 6 weeks to 12 weeks and 8 weeks to 14 weeks.  What you need to do is separate an area of your run for them, to be used as an introduction pen - they can see each other, but not interact. 3-4 foot tall chicken wire is a great option for fencing. Fence off a small corner or section, put in a feeder and waterer and make sure they have shade. They'll live in there during the day. You should have a dog crate or similar cage inside your coop, where they can sleep during the night.  Once your younger birds reach 6-8 weeks, you should wait until dark, then set them on the roost beside your older pullets. They'll wake up in the morning together, which greatly reduces stress and picking."
BackYardChickens,3bced2,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"This. Exactly this. Having a separate area where they can see each other for a couple of weeks, but not interact, is definitely the most important.   I never waited until dark for mine, although I hear it's a great way to introduce. I introduce mine as soon as I let my chickens free range. They're so excited to get out of the coop and run around the yard that they generally never paid much attention to the new additions. Eventually there's always a little squabbling, but nothing bad. Just the normal order of operations for chickens establishing who's the top hen.  Good luck!"
BackYardChickens,3bced2,moosobay,2,Mon Jun 29 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"What I have done in the past is section of a part of the run to put the new hen in so they can eat and drink near each other, but not in contact with each other, so they can get used to each other. I also let them all sleep together and let them free range together while I'm supervising to make sure there's no bullying. After a while I will stop sectioning the run off so they can all live together normally."
BackYardChickens,3bced2,MelonHeadSeb,2,Sun Jun 28 00:35:56 2015 UTC,So they sleep together at night with no issue?
BackYardChickens,3bced2,MelonHeadSeb,2,Sun Jun 28 00:47:18 2015 UTC,"That's how it's been in the past for me because they seem a lot more docile at night, but if there is some bullying going on then you may still have to separate them at night. Also if their run isn't very big maybe you shouldn't section a bit off and instead just see how it goes at first with them all together. If there is a lot of bullying then you should section it off. I would also not really recommend getting only one hen at a time."
BackYardChickens,3bced2,quack_quack_moo,2,Sun Jun 28 00:49:41 2015 UTC,Introducing a single new hen is a pretty good guarantee that it's going to get singled out and beaten up all the time.

With 7 turkeys total and 4 of them boys, I feel pretty secure about my flock when I'm not home. Those turkeys can really hurt if they want to, and I wouldn't be surprised to see them go after any predator that dared to enter the run."
BackYardChickens,3ba4m3,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"have you lost any to hawks since you have had them?....Also, my toms were beating the tar out of each other and non stop gobbling  so i had to butcher all but one."
BackYardChickens,3ba4m3,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"I lost one last year, but the toms were still pretty young at that time, so can't blame 'em for being useless. Haven't lost any since they got big though.  My toms did the same thing. I applied pinless peepers, which stopped most of the fighting. The new guy I recently brought in duked it out with my dominant male for a few days, now the new guy is in charge and he's got all the other boys quite scared. The other 3 mostly spend time in the lower area of the run now, and Brooks gets to hang out up top with the hens.  But they are very loud still, they gobble all day."
BackYardChickens,3b9137,stowawayhome,6,Fri Jun 26 23:23:36 2015 UTC,"What breed are they? While most breeds can be tamed down, some breeds, such as Hamburgs or Leghorns, for example, would probably require more time and work than it would be worth.  Regardless, I've found that what I like to call ""Touch Desensitization"" is a good method. You should pick them up, and touch them every where - head, eyes, wattles, neck, breast, legs, fluff, feet, toes, tail, saddle, wings and shoulders. Hold them at angles, flip them onto their back. Do all of this gently but firmly. Make handling a routine. Make sure NOT to set them down if they struggle or flap. Especially when lowering them to the ground; a lot of birds will see an escape and begin to struggle. Do not set them down until they will be calm when released.  Besides T.D., standard ""treating"" methods, sitting and walking around in the coop for long periods of time, and teaching them to come when called are also effective."
BackYardChickens,3b9137,GallusLafayetti,3,Sat Jun 27 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the touch desensitization information. I have added some images and background in the OP, for help with figuring out the breed."
BackYardChickens,3b9137,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat Jun 27 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Well, they definitely aren't Dorkings. Dorkings have a short-legged gene, and they have a very long and heavy body type.  What you are looking at are mixed gamefowl breeds, as most of the Hawaiian feral chickens are. Because most gamefowl typically look similar (certain body types survive fights better and so breed more, and the body types only differentiate based on fighting style used, not where they originate from - you can have two nearly identical gamefowl breeds from opposite sides of the world, if the fighting style was similar) it's difficult to tell which specific breed they are. My guess would be mixed foreign and American games, of a light slasher-and-gaff-style body type (as opposed to the strong, heavy orientals bred for naked heel fights). And obviously, since these are gamefowl descended from mixed fighting stock, they technically have no defined color - however, the male has nice type as a Silver Duckwing, and the female looks like some kind of mixed ""wild-type"", likely with both Silver and Golden Duckwing heritage.  These type of gamefowl can be quite flighty, especially since they've been living wild on the Hawaiian islands for many generations. However, when handled often, they tame down very nicely - gamefowl breeds often tame down well, since training for their original purpose required many hours of handling, and the birds who were calmer were trained better and thus more likely to survive fights."
BackYardChickens,3b9137,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"They certainly look like the Duckwings, though I think there is heavy dose of ""mutt"" going on. They are pretty chill considering that they are many generation wild and feral. They actually prefer to live in the coop, where they are fed 2 Sq meals a day, and the rest of the time can be spent socializing and sleeping. There are always randoms sneaking in.  Fighting is such a popular thing with some communities, I have been invited multiple times (non-ironically ;) I always turn them down because I don't know if I can turn off the socialization I have pertaining to chickens being for livestock or pets only."
BackYardChickens,3b9137,cuginhamer,2,Sun Jun 28 01:42:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, certainly. Most fighting breeds are mixed, the heritage is usually at least partially unknown. I would say that the birds on the HI islands are probably 80% fighting stock, with some mixed domestic breeds accounting for other 20% and causing the various colors/mutations not typically seen in games, but which appear in the feral stock.  I've always found fighting to be a ridiculous venture. Slasher fighting, especially. While I greatly respect the place and influence fighting had on today's keeping of the animals - after all, they were first domesticated for cockfighting, and their meat and eggs were considered sacred; not for human consumption - I believe that today's society should know better, regardless of matters of ""tradition"". Now, perhaps Naked Heel, I could understand - it's a matter of strength and skill, and has none of the element of luck seen in slasher fighting (where one chance hit can end a fight). It's an extreme (but definite) method of natural selection, as the loosing bird would be avoided as a breeder, resulting in the strongest birds possible. Slasher fighting, however, is nonsense. It does not benefit the strength or hardiness of the species, as most birds die in their first or second fight - even the winner. It has resulted in a beautiful and light appearance, yes, but not the strength, courage, intelligence, or disease and injury resistance seen in breeds who were used for Naked Heel alone."

(But follow instructions on package to make sure) The earlier you start the quicker the recovery usually.  I've had birds that had infections so bad they couldn't get food/water because they couldn't see it. I feed them with a syringe with water mixed with a little chick starter and often they recover just fine! Also helps to rinse the eye with a saline solution which can cheapy be made, but you must not used iodized* salt. You can get pure sodium tabs from amazon for cheap.They tend to get super tame from the attention too."

An ointment approved for use in then eyes may help as well.  Respiratory diseases can also sometimes present with ocular symptoms, so you should quarantine her away from the flock just in case. Look carefully for respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing, rattling, gurgling, nasal discharge) and keep an eye on the rest of the flock too."

BackYardChickens,3b7aux,cheekske,3,Fri Jun 26 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"Hold them and bring them treats. Do you have any hens that are trying to adopt them?  If not, they still should learn about scratching in the dirt and dust baths. Take some time each day to bring them to a some loose dirt and tap on it as their mothers would. They should come running and look for food- drop some cheese or chick feed.  Later, as they grow feathers, sprinkle some dirt on them when the are lying down... they'll figure out dust bathing.   At night, just hold them for 15-20 minutes so they associate snuggling and calm with your touch."
BackYardChickens,3b7aux,givemethosecatsnow,2,Fri Jun 26 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"Get a storage tote or two, they're cheap and work great for holding the babies, and they also make cleaning easy with a water hose. Cedar shavings are a big no no, but large pine shavings are excellent! A bag of 5 cubic feet goes for cheap, and you'll have plenty left over if you decide to have more chicks. Their main diet should be chick starter, and they must always have access to clean water. Treats can be given to them after a couple weeks, but nothing hard. Tomatoe, lettuce, grapes, hard boiled eggs, ect are very great treats. Just don't over do it, the nutrition they need is in their chick starter feed.  As far as bonding with them the best way is to spend time with them. Let them out in a small area under your supervision, and let them play/run around. Handle them often, and give them lots of pets and snuggles. You can even incorporate a treat with your pets, and snuggles to make them really love you.  If you do these things you should have very happy, healthy, and tame chickens when they get older. It's a labor of love, and well worth it in the end."
BackYardChickens,3b7aux,Thunder_god1987,2,Fri Jun 26 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"Agh, I made that mistake last year. Lost about 1/2 of my 80 bird order, mainly turkeys.  Hold them a lot, and get them really used to your touch. With my pet hen Misha (who's actually sitting on my lap preening herself as I type this), I did what I call ""touch desensitization"". I would hold her in my hand, and touch her everywhere. Her wings, her legs, her head, her fluff, her tail. I would also lay her on her back in my hand. She's now incredibly sweet and tame.  Once they grow and get to 5-6 weeks of age, you can also start giving them treats by hand. Dried mealworms, seed/scratch, and watermelon are some of my bird's favorites. Food is always the way to a chickens heart."

I keep my mom and babies in a dog kennel/cage with small cage sides so they cant get out for the first week or so and once they are a little more rugged I let them out every morning to range with the egg layers and the momma chicken protects them from most problems with anyone in the flock

BackYardChickens,3b3564,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:39:52 2015 UTC,I generally setup the cage with water and food before hand but should be fine to wait till they hatch. When they initially hatch they will stay under mama anyway. She wont try to take them out of the nest till day 2+ in most cases. After looking at your picture I would just toss a divider board up in your coop to seperate them till chicks gain alittle size then remove and let her be a mom.

BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,Thunder_god1987,8,Thu Jun 25 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is a definite Easter Egger. Lucky catch too - white ones and majority-white ones seem to be less common than brown/buff. I've only seen a few.  Get some Marans hens for him, too - the cross would produce beautiful offspring that would lay a dark, olive-colored egg (""Olive-Eggers"")."
BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:34:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I may have to do that. I am currently working out what breeds I want to add to my flock. Now that I know he is an easter egger, I will be hitting up my neighbor for some of his fertile eggs to put in my incubator. I don't think anyone around me has Marans, but I bet those would be some beautiful eggs. I'll check around to see if my local feed store is able to order some for me."
BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,Aerron,3,Thu Jun 25 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"The pea comb, slate shanks, and puffy cheeks make me think easter egger."
BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,SliceOfFrenchSilkPie,2,Thu Jun 25 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that too due to his greenish colored feet. I've been hesitant to decide that because my neighbor has easter eggers that are a beautiful black, and gold color. Picture for reference of what his easter eggers look like, it is not one of my own pictures."
BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,SliceOfFrenchSilkPie,5,Thu Jun 25 02:03:49 2015 UTC,"EEs are crosses or mutts, so you can get a huge range of appearances.  Because the pea comb is closely tied to the blue egg gene, EEs tend to inherit it from their Am. parent (if a first gen cross) along with getting green legs (true Ams have black or slate legs), but this often turns to green in crosses.  The Ams also contribute the puffy cheeks.  So your EEs may look nothing like someone elses if different parent stock are used, but green legs, puffy cheeks, and pea combs in unidentified non-standard colored chickens are good signs of EEs.  Edit: Ams = ameracaunas (I give up on spelling, sorry, think I botched it tonight), talking about APA standard Ams not EEs sold as Ams, as happens way way way too often."
BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,Aerron,2,Thu Jun 25 02:12:49 2015 UTC,"No worries, I knew what you were talking about. My ameracana's have black legs, are pure white, and lay beautiful blue eggs. I unfortunately have no green egg layers, but hopefully that will change now!"

Going to do sex linked crosses next round with barred rock hens x Am roo, just for the fun of having more greens in the egg basket and the ease of a linked cross.  So many options!"
BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,paisleyterror,2,Thu Jun 25 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"Most easter eggers I've seen are brindle like the one in your pic.  We've had 4 that color, but we also had a pure white easter egger hen.  Do you have easter eggers in your flock already?  If any of your current chicks end up laying green eggs, it'd be a good sign?"
BackYardChickens,3b0ur8,gratefuldiver,3,Thu Jun 25 02:11:28 2015 UTC,"No easter eggers in my flock at the current time. I will be having a talk with my neighbor, and get some of his fertile easter egger eggs to hatch in my incubator. I feel he's earned a spot on my farm, and I'll definitely be adding his breed to my mixed flock.  Edit: Just a rundown of my flock:   Road island reds: 5 hens 1 rooster Americanas: 6 hens Barred Rocks: 6 hens Australorps: 12 hens Buff Orpingtons: 7 hens White Australorps: 7 hens 2 roosters Chaunticleer (My majestic rooster, not the breed)"
BackYardChickens,3b0mrg,king_mustard,3,Thu Jun 25 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"Most chicken tractors are often designed for meat birds, which people typically assume require less space, so that's why they're smaller.  A 6x8 or 8x8 would probably be sufficient, but really, bigger is better."
BackYardChickens,3b0mrg,GallusLafayetti,3,Thu Jun 25 02:36:58 2015 UTC,Any chance a run isn't required? What about movable fence sections to partition off different parts of the yard to achieve the same effect?
BackYardChickens,3b0mrg,macgyverwannabe,2,Thu Jun 25 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, tractors are not as great as they seem. They are darned heavy and need to be pretty big to handle the pressure.  Back when I had just three hens, I had the recommended sized tractor, with an extra run that I built as an add-on. I had to move the thing every day, because they would trample, poop up and dig holes like crazy. I moved it over my 1/3 acre back yard, at the time, and (although the surviving grass was very healthy) the ground was pitted with holes; which made mowing the grass a bumpy nightmare.  On this go-round I have foregone the tractor (I use it as a stationary coop) and let them free-range all day. Five hens on about 1/6 acre have wiped out the easy to get insects and spend all day digging bigger holes where they found the juiciest specimens. Not to mention the dust baths everywhere.  After seeing how much they love to forage and sit in the shady dirt, I wouldn't have the heart to lock them up for very long.  I strongly suggest that you start with two or three and get a feel for how much damage they do and how they handle the boredom; then add more as you see fit.   Also, kitchen scraps run out fast, but they are always looking for a variety. Today. I found myself feeding them the leftover salmon and rice that I would have had for lunch, had they not convinced me that they were starving to death! That's another thing: Chickens make you go a little crazy. I'm five-chicken crazy, but I'm really glad that I started out just three-chicken crazy!  Good luck to you :)"
BackYardChickens,3b0mrg,whatsreallygoingon,2,Thu Jun 25 02:47:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend a tractor for laying hens, really. Tractors are typically smaller because they're mostly used to house meat birds that don't require as much space because they don't live as long. If you want a movable enclosure for hens I would suggest putting your coop on wheels and having movable fence panels around it. Depending on your breeds you'll probably have to clip their wings but it would definitely be easier on you."

BackYardChickens,3aufcq,SparklePantsForAll,20,Tue Jun 23 17:29:50 2015 UTC,"I saw this on /r/all today and laughed about it.  I asked my boys, 10 and 8, if there was a difference.  The 10 yr old said, 'Nope!'  His brother said 'yes.'  Then we explained it and he understood.  He was the one that insisted it was OK for me to slaughter his pet chicken.  She was laying thin shelled eggs and even after weeks of trying to correct it, we couldn't.  It was encouraging egg-eating in our flock.  I asked him more than once if it was OK for us to butcher her and he said yes.  He insisted on being there.  I hung her and another chicken from the line.  I slit the throat of the other, then his chicken's.  I turned and saw the look of horror on his face.    I picked him up and carried him inside as he cried.    My wife cooked those two birds that night and we ate them.  We told him he didn't have to eat if he didn't want, but he said he wanted to.  Moral of the story:  No matter how many times he/she says it's fine, no matter how much they insist they watch the process, don't let them watch you butcher their bird.  Oops, this wasn't supposed to be  a wall of text.  TL;DR Don't let your kids watch you butcher their pet."

BackYardChickens,3aufcq,ThisSeemsReasonable,16,Tue Jun 23 17:54:01 2015 UTC,Biggest reason we don't eat ours is that it is such a hassle. Feathers for days.
BackYardChickens,3aufcq,ChickenDinero,7,Tue Jun 23 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"Tell me more of this feathers everywhere phenomenon, please. I am approaching my first slaughter date. Yes, there will be a more experienced person to supervise. Any tips for a noob?"
BackYardChickens,3aufcq,GallusLafayetti,15,Tue Jun 23 22:29:59 2015 UTC,"(Not the person you were asking originally, but I have lots of experience with slaughter)  Yes, feathers will get everywhere. After scalding, they really do come out in clumps. They will stick to your hands, the meat, and any other surface the come into contact with. They will escape the bucket/bag. And once they are on the ground, unless you feel like picking every single on up, they somehow stay exactly where they are, rather than blowing away, for months. I killed a guinea hen 4 months ago, and because I was being lazy and throwing some of the handfuls on the ground, there are still hundreds of spotted guinea feathers in the dirt next to my butchering table.  Hey, tips:   Assuming you're using the standard throat-slitting method rather than an axe, it can be hard to tell the difference between a bird that's dead and a bird that's still alive, because the spasms look very similar. The eye is an organ that will only react if the the bird is alive; so poke the eye a couple times (gently open it if it's already closed), and if it doesn't blink or react, the bird is dead. A lot of tutorials will make the process seem really complicated, especially the prep. It's not. My first few times I would take upwards of half an hour getting my supplies together and making sure everything was in order. Now I grab my knife, a handtowel, a bucket, a water bucket, a gut bucket, and ziplock bags (or whatever you're using to store the meat). These are really all you'll need. Prep is 5-10 minutes.  Make sure you knife is sharp. I can't stress this enough. Any small-medium knife will work, as long as it's very, very sharp. I usually test them on a piece of paper beforehand. I prefer a regular flat blade, but serrated will also work for the process (except for killing, you'll need a flat blade for that). A water bucket is easier than a running hose. Use a very large stew pot or a 5 gallon bucket, filled with cold water. Use this to clean the table/knife and for washing blood/feathers off the carcass whenever needed. Change the water every 1-2 birds. How many birds do you have total? Don't expect to get more than 4-5 (at the most) done your first day. It's exhausting work, and since they're your first it will take a while to do each bird. Expect to get blood spattered on your clothes, arms, and probably face Keep the feet for stew. You should put them in a separate bag, bring them inside once you're done, drop them in boiling water for 30 seconds or so, then remove them and peel the outer layer of scales off. The outer layer of the toe nails will pop off if bent and pulled. If they have any scabs/issues with the bottom of their feet, cut the affected area off. Expect flies and meat bees. They will come, and there will be a lot of them. Sometimes, if the neck and trachea/esophagus are still attached to the body and you put pressure on it, it'll make a very weird, chicken-like sound. I'm telling you because it freaked me out a lot the first time. Don't hold back feed from the first 1-2 birds you are going to kill. The very first problem I encountered with my birds was being unable to find and remove the crop. It's much, much easier if it's full or partially full. Yes, you run the risk of breaking it, but if you're careful it most likely won't, and since it's full, it won't be difficult to find. Even if you do break it, it's not a big deal - just wash the feed away. I like to keep the feet on while eviscerating. Many people don't, but I find it much easier to hold the legs apart during the process if the feet are on. In fact, removing the feet is one of the last things I do before I bag the carcass."

It's also because I've never quite trusted my aim enough use an ax (although I've been meaning to learn this year).  I actually do skin, although not quite like that. I actually just cut a slit down the center of the breast skin, and down the side of each leg, then remove the breast meat, legs, feet/neck/giblets from the body itself, because it saves massive amounts of freezer space, and other than presentation, there's actually very little reason to keep the entire body intact (and when I do want a presentation bird, I just pluck anyways.)  I suggest learning plucking first regardless. It's a very useful skill to have, and a chore you should take the time to get used to.  But once you've done your first 10 or 20 birds, there's no reason not to try skinning. It's also a very useful skill to have, and it saves a lot of time if the bird is for use in stew or another dish wherein appearance isn't important."

BackYardChickens,3aufcq,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:04:20 2015 UTC,"My husband and I recently processed our first big round of meat birds. The first several we tried to use a hatchet. We put two nails in a stump and secured the head in there, stretched out the neck, and it was a quick kill. However, we found that the body is extremely hard to hold onto while it's doing death convulsions. We ended up with broken wings and bruised skin everywhere before it finally bled out and it just wasn't good at all because we were supposed to be selling most of these carcasses and needed them in good shape. So we did the killing cone and slitting the necks of the rest, it was so much better. When you get the cut right, the life instantly leaves their eyes, and the carcass isn't busted up from flapping around. Not to mention most of the blood is in a bin under them, not splattered all over you. I won't do it any other way now."

Last summer (until it broke cause it was cheap) I did my killing inside one of those camping easy-ups, basically the plastic tent cover with screened sides. It actually was very useful - I intend on buying a less-cheap one as soon as I can. It kept the feathers contained to a smaller area, provided shade for butchering on hot days, and prevented the carcass and myself from being accosted by meat bees and flies (as well as mosquitoes, when I was doing evening butcherings). I think it cost about $100, but like I said, it broke within the year, so it may be wiser to invest in a less Walmart-y one."

BackYardChickens,3aufcq,jollyn,2,Wed Jun 24 14:17:30 2015 UTC,"I think it should be a big deal. Allow me to say why.  From the fact that we evolved as omnivores, nothing follows about how we should behave. After all: we didn't evolve wings, so should we not fly in airplanes? See what I mean? We are dealing here with what in philosophy is called 'the fact-value distinction'.  You might think that this is not the place to make such arguments. However, I detected in what you said one of the common, and, frankly, really bad arguments for eating meat, and so (especially since I look after chickens) I saw this as an opportunity to point out why the argument was poor."
BackYardChickens,3aufcq,TechnicallyMagic,3,Wed Jun 24 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"So by your logic, since we created the technology to fly (something we can't do biologically), one could argue that we could use science and technology to avoid eating meat (something we are biologically equipped to do). So some people choose to fly, and some people choose to not eat meat. It still has nothing to do with whether or not it should be a big deal to explain to children."
BackYardChickens,3aufcq,SpamEggsBaconAndSpam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"It still has nothing to do with whether or not it should be a big deal to explain to children. I suppose that explaining to a child how it is that people have come to do it (to raise and eat chickens) is straightforward (aside from the evolutionary details). My point, though, can be put thus: explaining the ethics of the situation is another matter. (You might think: no, that too is straightforward; it's simply about choice. On what grounds, though, do/should we make ethical decisions?)   I'll leave matters there - and give you an upvote for responding civily to my no doubt slightly surprising intervention."

BackYardChickens,3awahy,Elizzle1,3,Wed Jun 24 00:40:49 2015 UTC,http://poultrykeeper.com/respiratory-problems/mycoplasma  Our entire flock was infected by a chicken we didn't properly quarantine with exactly what it sounds like Buttercup has. Is she or another chicken new? Just so you know she will get your other birds sick and you may lose a weaker bird or two. We lost our favorite roo and 2 of the M.G. positive birds that we had bought to this last winter.
BackYardChickens,3awahy,inapproprievan,2,Wed Jun 24 04:13:24 2015 UTC,"I got her about 3/4 weeks ago, and she showed symptoms about 2 weeks ago and hasn't improved. She steers clear of the other chickens, so I'm not too worried about the others getting infected.  I just read a bunch of articles on MG and was hoping it wasn't the case. I think I'm going to get the Denegard antibiotic, treat the whole flock, and separate her from all the others for about a month. From what I've read, it's one of the only antibiotics that won't mess with a human's system after eating eggs from chickens that were treated."
BackYardChickens,3awahy,GallusLafayetti,4,Wed Jun 24 04:36:26 2015 UTC,"This has the symptoms of either Infectious Coryza or Cholera. Could also be one of the Mycoplasmas, however those typically present with bubbly eyes rather than swollen.  There is a chance that this is just a environmental issue, allergies, etc. The chance is very, very small, and I would not be optimistic. Most likely she does have Coryza or Cholera, and this is not going to be a fun situation.  You need to quarantine her away from the flock. Disinfect yourself thoroughly before and after handling her. If she's been in with them more than a few days since showing symptoms, regardless of whether or not she socialized, the chances are very good the rest of them already have it, but you should be keeping her separate anyways.  Duramycin, Gallimycin, and Denagard are all options for treatment. They may or may not work. Keep in mind that these are only a treatment. They are not a cure. If she does live (depending on severity of the disease, that can be a big if) she will be infectious for life.  Do not remove birds from your flock. Do not add birds to your flock. Do not allow chicken-owning friends into your coop/run. If you have any nearby neighbors with chickens, advise them to keep their birds confined if possible and watch closely for symptoms.  If you see symptoms in other birds, your flock is infected. They will be infected for life, and carriers for life. You face a difficult choice: you can keep a closed flock (no birds out, accept that birds brought in may or may not survive), doing regular rounds of medication for new birds or relapsed birds, and possibly loose birds due to the disease. Or you can do a complete cull, bleach everything, and wait a few months to start over.  This is why quarantine is invaluable. Over the years, my flock has been infected with Marek's disease, Mycoplasma Gallisepticum, and Mycoplasma Synoviae. All of these instances were due to poor sourcing and improper quarantine.  Good luck."

In some cases it's survivable, in some it's not. The afflicted birds that do survive past chickhood (or aren't subsequently culled to prevent slow death) usually learn to scoop feed rather than pecking it, and may be aided by a deeper dish for feed. Some keepers may also choose to trim the beak, and mixed results have been reported. Even then, many birds can live several years or more with no aid whatsever."

We have minimal migratory waterfowl that come through our yard (at least from what I've seen) so I am actually not terribly worried, but better to be prepared. And while I know keeping them in the coop won't ensure 100% protection, complimenting that with good biosecurity procedures should theoretically help. Again, IF it hits our area.

Probably gonna go with Belt/Sandhill Preservation for my '16 order."
BackYardChickens,3aqa8q,justinsayin,3,Mon Jun 22 18:02:46 2015 UTC,How can the quality of a newborn chick be judged?
BackYardChickens,3aqa8q,chingchongtong,5,Mon Jun 22 18:39:51 2015 UTC,"Well, it can't. I mean, in terms of hardiness, it's usually pretty obvious - hatcheries with poor shipping standards or unhealthy birds usually result in deaths  or sickly birds during and after shipping. But as far as quality of the bird - likeness to breed, temperament, laying ability - knowledge can only come from keeping of the adult birds of their stock. Like I said, McMurray has very poor standards of breeding. Their birds are great layers, but most don't even come close to the uniform appearance that the breeds should have. I mean, all hatchery-quality birds have this issue to some extent, as they are bred for laying or meat rather than appearance, but McMurray's chicks in particular have strayed bizarrely far from the standard."

BackYardChickens,3aqnfl,jfastman,2,Mon Jun 22 20:04:43 2015 UTC,No wattles or much of a comb. It should try to make crowing sounds by now. I think you have a hen. Does it raise it's hackles and challenge the other birds? Are the hackles pointy or oval? They look oval to me and this is a way to determine the sex is female.
BackYardChickens,3aqnfl,freakydeeky105,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:07:10 2015 UTC,She hasn't been crowing but she does challenge the other birds quite a bit. I think I might have been a bit paranoid. Thanks!

BackYardChickens,3ao2ru,asheridan_,2,Mon Jun 22 08:53:47 2015 UTC,I have a hen sat on 7 eggs which are due to hatch any day. I have no real clue what to expect and was wondering if you have any advice on how to properly prepare for chicks in the coop?
BackYardChickens,3ao2ru,asheridan_,3,Mon Jun 22 15:59:38 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about chicks is that they don't really require much at all!   Make sure the coop, and especially the area surrounding the nest, is super clean. If other chickens have a habit of being all up in the hen's business, consider getting a big cage/crate ready to move her and the babies into for the first week.  Chicks seem to hatch most often in the earlier morning hours, and will be exhausted for most of their first day...check on them by lifting up the hen if you can, but don't bother them too much. They absorbed the yolk and therefore don't need food or water until the next day, but it's good to have it ready. Grab some starter chick feed (I usually go with the unmedicated type, since my layer hens like to get into it) and move any big bowls of water that you might have around. Chicks can fall in and drown in an inch of water, so get them a small shallow waterer if you don't have one. I usually get a packet of electrolytes (they're super cheap) and mix some in just to give them a little boost.  The hen will probably sit on the eggs for up to an extra 48 hours, since some babies hatch 1-2 days apart, so keep that in mind. With a broody hen, you really don't have to do much but make sure they have a safe and healthy environment. :) Unless you have a lot of issues, you shouldn't have to separate them...my broodies like to nest in a corner of my coop on the floor, and I've never had a problem. Even the roosters seem cautious around the babies. The hen will make sure to integrate all the babies into the flock before she weans them.  That's really all there is to it! First time moms might make a few small mistakes, but they know what they're doing. Good luck with your chicks...it's an incredible process to watch!"

BackYardChickens,3aqfxq,severalmonthsb415,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"You should only need to dust once, maybe twice at the most. Unless they have some source that is constantly reinfecting them (do you have wild birds living in your pen or something?), one treatment should kill all mites and eggs, and a second application should kill any that were in the bedding and climbed on after dusting.  What's Sevin dust made of? I know that DE (and other natural products) are inneffective as a treatment for mites. It's fine for use as a preventative, but you should always use a permethrin dust when treating an infection that has already taken hold."
BackYardChickens,3aqfxq,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jun 22 18:08:17 2015 UTC,A quick google search says Sevin dust's active ingredient is Carbaryl.  It's an insecticide.  We live in wetlands so there are birds in the area. That may be the source of reinfection.  I'll try permethrin if Sevin doesn't work.
BackYardChickens,3aqfxq,KnifehandHolsters,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"I dipped mine in a permethrin solution. Picked a really hot day and did it early. Toweled off the excess and left them to ruffle out in the sun to dry. It seems to have helped. I also shop vac'd the coop and sprayed it thoroughly with permethrin. Once it dried, I loaded back up with fresh bedding. I also sprinkled Eight Dust over the new sand in the bottom of the enclosed run area. You can put the same permethrin solution in a spray bottle and spritz the birds if they are docile enough. I'll have to do this again in about ten days, but should be able to give them a spray every so often as preventative.   We have wild birds galore and mine basically free range so it is a fight to keep the mites off them. DE makes for an ok dustbath but it doesn't seem to really prevent much of anything."
BackYardChickens,3aqfxq,asheridan_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:52:49 2015 UTC,I'm struggling with a red mite infestation right now too. After a rough week I'm finally seeing numbers dwindle and here's what I've done:   1) steam cleaner on every nook and cranny of the coop 2) poultry shield coop disinfectant spray 3) Burn all bedding (don't bin it! Your bin will become infested for sure!) 4) dusted entire coop and chickens with DE 5) out of desperation when seeing the hens visibly distressed during the night due to the amount of mites crawling over them I treated them both with one small drop of a spot-on flea remedy normally put on my cats
BackYardChickens,3aqw0h,PlasticOwl,2,Mon Jun 22 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"Given that all other possible causes seem to be accounted for, I'm inclined to think it may have to due with her behavior as the alpha hen. Sometimes, when a rooster is lacking in the flock, hens will adopt rooster-like behavior, and very rarely even start to have the physical appearance of a rooster. In most cases, however, the change is mild - crowing, mounting, aggression, lack of egg laying. Have you noticed any of these other behaviors?"
BackYardChickens,3aqw0h,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jun 22 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"Humm. She is pretty vocal, definitely aggressive, and doesn't lay. I have not seen her mount anyone.   Does this mean I need to get a roo?"
BackYardChickens,3aqw0h,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:58:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the right rooster can be a very positive influence on the the flock. And while there are sometimes other causes for hens to become or partially become roosters (i.e. infection in the ovary), the addition of a rooster would most likely solve the issue. (Assuming it's the correct diagnosis - these things can be tricky, sometimes.)  When picking out a rooster, you should try to get an adult 1 year or older, and for the best chance of having a good rooster choose a calm breed like a Brahma, Silkie, or Cochin."
BackYardChickens,3aqw0h,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:54:18 2015 UTC,I can't have a rooster where I live.  Is there anything wrong with just letting her be the man of the coup?
BackYardChickens,3arcwe,theCrowForetold,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:58:06 2015 UTC,Fascinating! Are these by any chance related to the completely naked birds who select groups have been trying to turn into broilers as of late? Or is it just a highly improved Naked Neck line? Is there any chance you would be willing to share where you found the stock to create this bird?
BackYardChickens,3arcwe,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"Completely naked chickens are unrelated -- and they're not a viable option in the poultry industry because bacterial contamination of the skin is more of a problem (the feathers are like a glove, to contact all the bacteria in the environment, then we can take the glove off at processing) -- and they also dissipate heat too well without feathers and it's harder keeping them warm.  Anyway, this chick is a cross between a silkie (black-skinned) and a naked neck (which is a chicken/turkey cross)."
BackYardChickens,3arcwe,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jun 24 12:13:36 2015 UTC,"Love the idea of using Silkie genetics for the project (since even feathered areas typically see less heat retention due to the way the feathers are structured), but I do feel compelled to point out that Naked Necks are not turkey/chicken hybrids, as it's biologically impossible - they were only sometimes thought to be, gaining the nickname ""Turkens"". They in fact simply carry that Naked Neck gene - which really isn't seen exclusively in Naked Necks, but is also found in older gamefowl breeds, such as the Vietnamese Ga Noi or the Madagascar Gamefowl, on whom it may cause even more extensive featherless-ness."

A lot as in if you are home with free time the babies are in your lap, use a nasty old towel and have baby wipes handy. What will most likely happen is one will pick you out, the others will be sweet but they wont be cuddly. One will decide that you are just the best thing ever and that will be your cuddle buddy.  I have a rooster that is very cuddly. When I found him he was hatching directly into the ground, his egg was cold and the poor thing barely had the energy to peep at me. So I peeled him out of his egg and hand raised him, I was WWOOFing at the time so I was home pretty much all the time."

BackYardChickens,3aogva,pianosaur,8,Mon Jun 22 04:58:54 2015 UTC,"Barred Plymouth Rocks are often seen as ""the"" American breed; go back in time 100 years, and Barred Rocks were in everybody's backyard. Funny enough, they aren't the original ""American"" breed; that place goes to the Dominique. Originally sometimes called Dominiccers, they were the very first American breed. They were insanely popular - everybody had one because they were the best bird to have! Until the advent of the Plymouth Rock, that is. In fact, the Rock's new found popularity almost caused the extinction of the Dominique; it's a breed we're lucky to have today.  They may not be considered quite as ""American"", but many gamefowl breeds were also imported very early on for the purpose of cockfighting. The Sumatra comes to mind (imported 1847) and perhaps the Malay (imported 1846). Not to mention the American Game, by far one of the most popular gamefowl in America, created right here on U.S. soil.  As for the popularity of keeping and the rise of the chicken industry, Leghorns and the Standard Cornish (which were, in fact, created from oriental gamefowl including the Malay) were invaluable in the creation of commercial strains - the best producers in the world, undoubtedly."

Upwards of a week would be good. Hopefully when she is reintroduced, she will have lost her status as an aggressor. If she resumes the behavior, you can turn to pinless peepers or a bit as a last resort. This should be a definite stop to all picking, but rarely a bird will be very determined. If you continue to see issues after attempting all of these methods, you should hit craigslist to place a rehoming ad, or, alternately, here are some great recipes using chicken.  It concerns me that you're seeing so much picking at such a young age. Picking can sometimes start up without a cause, but typically when they're this young it's due to overcrowding. What size coop/run are you keeping them in at the moment?"
BackYardChickens,3amsh7,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"I don't have the measurements to hand, but initially their brooder space was about 4 feet by 2 and a bit feet I think - it was a box big enough that I could get in it! There was stuff hung up to peck at, and a roosting bar. By the time I moved them out, they could all easily get out of the box, so they were able to get out and run around my conservatory to explore, then come back to the box to sleep/bathe etc.  They are now outside with a coop space designed for four adult birds, and a small covered run (on my way to work - will get measurements when I get home). I used this no problemo last time I had chicks to get them used to treating the coop as home before letting them out in the main run (14m2) after about a week in the covered space.  I held off getting them outside until they were 6 weeks, as one chook was a bit behind the others with her feathers, and it hasn't been a warm spring (I live in Britain!). Since going outside, they seem significantly calmer. I've seen a bit of pecking from the aggressive Welsummer, but no real fighting and no one has a big bald patch (touch wood...).  I assume the pick no more stuff just taste gross - will this affect normal preening behaviour?  Thanks for your help!

Pick-No-More has a bad flavor, and contains a dye which makes the area less visible (which, by the way - don't get it on your hands or clothes. That stuff never comes out!).

The chickens pictured with it are the last birds I had (RIP Ginger Frank and Black Frank!) at roughly three months of age.  My FIL bought that triangular coop, but I didn't really like it, so I've traded it out, I'm just using the covered run from it. I didn't like that the sides were angled, which made the roosting space a bit tight on the top roosting bar, and I felt it was a bit small for four birds. The one I have now is this one which is a bit more appropriate.  I can't get to the pet shop until tomorrow (won't be back from work before it shuts tonight) but that pick no more stuff sounds like a winner.

BackYardChickens,3amsh7,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jun 22 08:30:48 2015 UTC,"Well, they need a yard too. The small coops which have both an enclosed area and a lower wire area are designed for night time and early morning hours only. The ""run"" is really only OK for the the first few hours of the morning, say if it's the weekend and you decide to sleep in and don't let them out until 9:30-10:00.  They need to have a fenced run as well, for four birds preferably 5x5 feet or larger; it is very bad to keep them in the coop/wire-underneath area all the time."
BackYardChickens,3amsh7,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:58:35 2015 UTC,"The wired run is inside a larger fenced area that is 14 square metres (google tells me thats about 150 square feet). I wouldn't dream of keeping them in that little space permanently! The surrounding fence for the run area is at chest height on two sides, with netting running a little higher on the top. On the other two sides there is a six foot fence and the back of a wood cabin, so I've not had any escapees yet.  I'm only using the enclosed area while they get used to the outside coop, since all the advice I've seen so far is to keep them quite enclosed for a few days to get them accustomed to where 'home' is. After that, they'll get access to the main run.  If this is wrong I am very happy to let them out earlier, but when I had FIL to help last time we had chicks, he recommended keeping them in the covered run for a few days, so I'm just doing that again."

Day old, only had them an hour.  I thought their brooding box was strong enough and was outside building the coop.  I was almost mad enough to kill the dog.  When we started over, we added a rooster to the flock, and specifically sought out the biggest rooster in Louisiana.  His name is Punky Rooster and he weighs 16 pounds.  You might consider adding one to your flock."

BackYardChickens,3akl7y,bananasciber,4,Sun Jun 21 03:39:43 2015 UTC,If we can figure out who the dogs owners are...
BackYardChickens,3akl7y,Grimsterr,5,Sun Jun 21 04:34:14 2015 UTC,"No warning required, dispatch them and let animal control pull their info from the tags on their collars.  Last time dogs got into my chickens animal control came out and collected the corpse of the one I got, told me the owner's address and name, and I drove over there and let him know he owed me $100 for chickens and a broken chicken pen.   He reimbursed me and that was that."
BackYardChickens,3akl7y,Grimsterr,9,Sun Jun 21 08:55:33 2015 UTC,"As much as people are probably balking at such an example, once an animal gets a taste for chicken blood, it's going to go pretty high on their priority list for returning to have a taste again and again and again. Sometimes it really is the best remedy to the situation."
BackYardChickens,3akl7y,LostMyPasswordAgain2,2,Sun Jun 21 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"I had a border collie I simply couldn't break from killing chickens, so I just made sure chickens didn't end up in the pen with him and if one did, well that's my failure.  This dude lived in a subdivision almost 2 miles away (as the crow flies) he kept his dogs in a backyard fence, when I got there, just glancing at the fence I could see from the sidewalk he'd had them escape several times, I saw holes under the gate with concrete blocks in them, and patched fence galore (it was a privacy fence).  He failed as an owner by not securing his fence better.  A single strand of electric wire about 6 inches off the ground would have stopped them digging out.  I felt bad, real bad about his dog, especially after I met him, but I felt worse about my flock of chickens, who WERE secure in their pen, just not secure enough to resist the efforts of two full grown collies (border and ?australian?)."

Also, do you really think I'd go unarmed to visit the guy who I'm about to notify that not only is he short one dog but that he owes me money?  That'd be just dumb."
BackYardChickens,3akl7y,LostMyPasswordAgain2,5,Sun Jun 21 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless OP is a GREAT shot, they're likely only going to wound a dog with a .22, 12 gauge would be my choice.  Last time I had dogs stalking my goats (they'd already killed my chickens) I dispatched one (of the pair) with my .223, it did the job, a 22 probably would have sent the animal home wounded or she would have died on the run home.  The .223 laid her out on my driveway in one shot."
BackYardChickens,3akl7y,Gorillaz_Inc,3,Sun Jun 21 09:02:58 2015 UTC,"A hit on anything in the heart/lung region on a dog with a .22 will end it, really. the .22LR is really an under-rated round. I work at a gun shop part time some nights and on saturdays, because I like it more than my engineering job, and when I retire hopefully in 15 years at most, I can still work there for fun.  A couple weeks ago we were bored, and we had a block of ballistic gel with a hunting round in it, given to us by the manufacturer, but it had gotten pretty old and dirty. So, we took it into the range, and I put 2 of my 9mm Pow'RBall rounds into it. They penetrated about 12 inches, and had a good diameter of damage as expected.  Then, we pumped 10 rounds of .22LR HPs through the gel, and that was actually really surprising - they penetrated just as far as the 9mm round, and expanded well. They could dispatch a dog easily enough if they wanted to, and the rifle would cost the person a lot less as well, if they weren't firearms enthusiasts and just wanted a rifle to shoot varmints getting on to the property and into the chickens and such.  But you are right in that a .223/5.56 rifle would do a better job for that size animal, I just wouldn't tell them to spend that much more money unless they were going to use the rifle for more than that."
BackYardChickens,3akl7y,LostMyPasswordAgain2,2,Sun Jun 21 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"Growing up we used .22 LR on the strays and feral dogs.  But then my dad could put 5 shots into a quarter at 50 yards so that helps.  And before the brigade starts, we lived out in the county, last house for miles, it was a favorite spot up the road from us for people to drop pets, being the first house we saw almost all of them come to us, over the years growing up I'd estimate we had ~100 dogs and god only knows how many cats wander in stray to our farm.  The cats were shooed up to the barn where they could earn their keep, the dogs, it depended, mangey, mean, unsocial, they were killed, the friendly sociable ones who we felt would be easy to find a home for were taken in and given away, or kept.    The pound would not take them from us, as we were nowhere near the city limits, and there really was no ""animal control"" in the county, when called they said kill it or take it in and that was that."

I get really annoyed with suburban people (I live in subrgatory myself, full disclosure) when they buy large dogs and don't have a large area for them to run and exercise. 1 of 2 things seem to inevitably happen:   The give away the animal after a year because it's no longer a cute cuddly puppy and takes work to take care of The start putting their dog on a diet, because they can't figure out how a dog can gain weight by sitting inside all day while they're at work, then going for a 1/2 hour walk and sitting inside the rest of the day. Then their hips go bad after 7 years and people put the animal down because it's too much to take care of.   Animals are for life. I don't understand people that regard them as possessions, and as such I generally get pretty annoying when I see someone talking about how their dog is purebred such-and-such.

The owner of such a dog cares nothing for their neighbors, little for the dog, and ultimately has left the fate of that dog in the hands of a neighbor who may need that dog to stop doing something that is causing destruction.

I checked her backside and she was straining and just starting to prolapse (do not Google that)  I popped my pinky in there and didn't feel anything like a stuck egg. There were some recommendations for a warm water soak that if nothing else is relaxing, so we tried that and she seemed to like it, and started falling asleep, and then about a minute later, the straining neck feathers all straight out and crazy mouth /face and she was gone. Figured I would get some butchering practice. So I plucked and tried to carefully autopsy her. The results are on imgur.  I was surprised at the amount of food in her crop. And her gizzard seemed larger than expected. There was a little bit of hard poop in the intestines but it wasn't backing up...  Any ideas?"
BackYardChickens,3akdww,GallusLafayetti,3,Sun Jun 21 01:48:04 2015 UTC,"The contents of her gizzard looks very strange. Is it just the photo, or is the color actually red? If so, do you feed anything that might cause that color due to dye/etc.?  The liver also looks much paler than it ought to be. Liver should be a dark, slightly brownish red.  Can't tell from the image; in the third photo, what is that large reddish mass on the top left part of the cutting board?"

BackYardChickens,3akdww,GallusLafayetti,5,Sun Jun 21 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"She may have had a blockage from mullberry seeds, which impeded her digestive tract. Too much sugar and not enough protein or carbs, and with very dry crumbly poo in the intestines, I believe she had a blockage of mullberry seeds in her crop, causing dehydration, possibly a serious issue in her pancreas and liver for sure. Too much sugar to process.   I would watch the rest of your flock to be safe......supplement grit, rake up the mulberries, get some good protein in them, and check all of their crops first thing in the morning. Anyone with swollen crops in the morning may be at risk for dying the same way."

BackYardChickens,3akdww,GallusLafayetti,2,Sun Jun 21 02:59:05 2015 UTC,"Also I noticed her liver was a lot lighter than expected, and was very soft and broke up easily... Shame I don't feel comfortable eating her."
BackYardChickens,3akdww,bowhunter3,2,Sun Jun 21 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"Livers are typically very soft, but yeah, the colors definitely off.  Why don't you feel comfortable eating her? If it's because she's a pet, I understand. But if not, she should be completely edible. Given that she wasn't showing any signs of a disease but rather was having symptoms of prolapse makes me think it's most likely some kind of injury/physical problem, rather than a virus/bacteria etc. that could be harmful to humans (even then, the majority of virus'/bacteria that affect chickens pose no threat to us). I've eaten plenty of birds who died from injuries and physical ailments, and plenty who have had odd livers as well; I just throw the livers (and any other weird organs) out."

BackYardChickens,3aj61w,melligator,2,Sat Jun 20 18:31:54 2015 UTC,Missing belly feathers happens with broody hens. If you don't want her broody you just have to remove the eggs and keep her from going back to the nest. You probably don't need to separate her. It may take a day or two but if you keep taking her off the nest she should get over it. My bantam girls go broody very frequently but it's easy to remedy.
BackYardChickens,3aj61w,asongoftitsandwine,2,Sat Jun 20 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Broody hens will pick out their own belly and fluff feathers to line the nest with, it's perfectly normal.  If you want to break her, you should use wire. Put a wire cage up on bricks or cinderblocks so her belly is exposed to the cold air. A few days in it should do the trick."

I buried 3, the 4th was missing.  Hoping she got away and may come back but highly unlikely.   We hadn't quite named them yet but they were almost 19 weeks old and 1 had just started laying and they were very much a part of our family and our daily activities.

The neighbor denied it was her dogs but I haven't seen the dogs since. I also contacted the county and received a check to help cover my loss. Many places offer compensation for agriculture losses. I also wish I had pulled the trigger the first time the dogs got after my chickens ... I think the neighbor might have learned and prevented the major loss. I was compassionate since the 3 dogs only chased and didn't kill any that won't happen again.

BackYardChickens,3agbby,GallusLafayetti,2,Sun Jun 21 09:48:01 2015 UTC,"Are your boxes part of your coop? If not, remove them during the night. The behavior should break within a week or two.  If they aren't moveable, you'll just have to move the birds every night. They'll eventually realize they're going to be moved to the roost anyways, and stop going to the boxes."
BackYardChickens,3agbby,jrwreno,2,Sat Jun 20 00:00:31 2015 UTC,"I set up 'curtains' in the 10 nest boxes I have, and it seems to dissuade them at night, because they cannot see crap, and do not want to be boxed in.   For laying in day time, curtains are perfect! Just the right amount of darkness, privacy, which also prevents egg-eating."
BackYardChickens,3ah3gw,stukufie,4,Sat Jun 20 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"That's not worms, that's maggots. Make sure all the dirty feathers are cleaned or removed, and give her some yogurt to clear up the pasting. A small amount of Sav-A-Chick probiotics mixed in won't hurt.  Oh yeah, and don't trust DE as a treatment. It's a fine preventative, as are other natural options like garlic power/cayenne pepper in the feed or apple cider vinegar in the water, but if you suspect the problem already has a hold on the bird, it's time to go chemical."

BackYardChickens,3agvfd,OKaylaMay,3,Sat Jun 20 01:41:59 2015 UTC,"My reason? Raccoons are clever bastards that are exceptionally good at climbing over fences. Armor that bitch up.  (plenty of people have made and have success with a simple fenced run. It's less secure but sufficient for a low-predator area. Remember, even if you're in the middle of downtown, there are still dogs, possums, raccoons, hawks, and all sorts of other things that want to eat your birds.)"
BackYardChickens,3agvfd,kayakyakr,2,Sat Jun 20 05:24:43 2015 UTC,We did the wood frame for no reason other than we had some wood posts lying around and it went with our backyard.  I see no reason to not use metal stakes.
BackYardChickens,3agvfd,stukufie,2,Sat Jun 20 03:19:21 2015 UTC,"Depends. Most people with small flocks use a wooden frame because it's more secure and easier to cover/net. I use a simple welded garden fence and t-posts, since my run is about 8000 sq. ft. and framing it would have been ludicrous.  Depending on your predator load, a simple fence may or may not be sufficient. If you're on a budget, you can just put up a simple fence for now, as it very well may work fine. I lived in a suburban neighborhood with my first flock for a good ~5 years. The fence was just a 4 foot wooden picket fence, the birds jumped over it all the time, but I never had a single predator loss except in the first months, to the family dog, and she learned swiftly that the chickens were off limits.  If you can afford it though, you may as well put in a fully covered frame. No reason not to."
BackYardChickens,3agvfd,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was going to cover it for sure, but I could see how that would be easier with a frame."
BackYardChickens,3agvfd,jrwreno,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"I built my 40ft x 40ft chicken run by building 3 ft raised garden beds, with 8-10ft tall posts that support the fencing to keep the chickens in. The raised beds prevent digging, the height prevents climbing.   I also installed coyote roller-bars, by attaching metal conduit pipes, with larger PVC piping fit over it. The rollers are fit at the top, so if any animal; raccoon, coyote, bear....tries to climb the fence, their paw hits the rollers, and down they go!  I have bird netting at the top, with a cottonwood tree providing shade and cover, as well as a mulberry and grapes being grown as a living 'ceiling'. I am considering installing a hot wire on the top of the fence to prevent asshole-coyotes."

I was actually gonna fly out there to the Ohio National this year, until I heard it was canceled. Next year, I suppose.  It's absolutely true, about the private sales - out here in California we're also seeing a huge increase in bird sales (where I work, we aren't even breeders - our birds are hatchery stock, bought, raised, and resold through a specialty store) thanks to a new egg law that's bumped organic eggs to $5/dozen. And prices are expected to double - double, that's $10/doz organic! - over the next while, cause of the AI outbreak.  I mean, the business is going crazy - we're getting in batches of 200-300 pullets every few weeks, and they're typically all sold by the time the next batch comes in. And maybe 1/2 of our customers are brand new people, who are just now getting into chicken keeping. It's totally nuts.  It's a great time to be in chicken breeding and selling business."

I understand that this may be difficult for those who keep a pet flock, but it is very important. There are many diseases which leave no external trace but many internal symptoms and signs.  Keep a close eye on your flock's breathing and activity levels. Take note of any birds who are acting lethargic, have a pale comb, aren't laying, aren't eating or drinking, aren't preening, or are otherwise displaying abnormal behavior. Examine each bird, including around the vent, on the bottoms of the feet, and inside the mouth. Dust for mites, even if you don't find signs of eggs (they can hide well sometimes and there's no harm in preventative dusting anyways). Check your feed for any discoloration, wetness, or mold. Check your waterer to make sure it isn't getting icky. How's the weather by you? If it's above 90 F., you should be watering down the yard and providing cold treats and frozen water bottles."

If a rooster comes after you, kick it. Hard. This is the only effective way I've ever broken a rooster of the behavior. Hurt him before he hurts you. It's unpleasant, but it's necessary.  If neither of these improve the behavior, use an authentic Coq Au Vin recipe, and buy a Brahma or Cochin roo."
BackYardChickens,3aa6vs,Grimsterr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"Kick him, then chase him.  You have to mean it, my wife can't break a rooster from attacking her to save her life, she simply won't do what's necessary.  He comes at me I do my best to kick a 40 yard field goal, bonus points if he bounces off at least 2 walls (or a wall and the roof) of the chicken run.  I rarely get attacked twice."
BackYardChickens,3aa6vs,Grimsterr,3,Thu Jun 18 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"You didn't mention doing your best imitation of a place kicker.  If a rooster goes for me, I kick the SHIT out of him, I mean really put your foot in it, one of two things happen, you kill him (I've never had one die, but I'm sure it's possible) or he learns to leave you alone.  Add in a nice chase after he lands, run his ass around the coop a couple times, try to get another couple kicks in right to his backside (softer though, his wings protect him from the kick but not from one to his rear).  If he's not making the OH SHIT cackle chickens do when scared, try harder."
BackYardChickens,3aa6vs,SchipAlong,2,Thu Jun 18 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've given him quite a lot of chances and time already. I hate when people jump on the kill wagon at the first sign of aggression, but I also think there are definitely truly aggressive roosters that can't be made friendly. I went through this with my rooster, who I hand raised from just a few days old, and gave him a year of trying everything and hoping he could be tamed. I ended up having to put mine down."
BackYardChickens,3aa6vs,SluiceBox,2,Thu Jun 18 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"As far as aggression towards humans, I've had luck just subduing mine and carrying him around under my arm as much as possible. It only took me doing that to my rooster a couple times a day for a week and a half before he started voluntarily hoping in my lap and falling asleep.   I'm not sure what to tell you about that kind of chicken on chicken aggression. Are they getting a well balanced diet? I wish I had more to offer on this but I'm leaning towards agreeing with the chicken dinner suggestions before he causes the hens permanent damage."
BackYardChickens,3aa6vs,kayakyakr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"They have plenty of layer food and they free range hours a day. They seem to lay fine, so I don't think it is food.

Seconding what NauticalxDisaster said, my first thought is allergies of some kind. It might be worth checking if it's a sinus infection though, just to rule that out before assuming it's allergies."
BackYardChickens,3a96tu,SchipAlong,3,Thu Jun 18 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"Looks like a possible infection. Allergies are a possibility, but not really something seen commonly in chickens. Check for any foreign substances or objects in the eye, and see if you can find any ointment approved for use in the eye at your local feed store.  Also, take a moment to listen carefully to her breathing. Put her beak up to your ear, then put your ear to the area just above her crop. Lots of respiratory diseases are accompanied by ocular symptoms, however having seen several of these diseases first hand, I will say that it doesn't look especially typical of those which I've seen."
BackYardChickens,3a96tu,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"Both of her eyes are irritated and itchy. They were much worse a week and a half ago. She was also showing signs of coccinia infestation (bloody stools and weight loss), so I treated her with Corid for that. Her eyes improved a bit as well but it's been almost a week since the treatment finished and her eye irritation still hasn't gone away. She doesn't have any respiratory symptoms that I have noticed.   Im grasping at straws here. Google and the backyard chickens forum hasn't quite matched her symptoms."

BackYardChickens,3a6hj3,Malthaeus,2,Wed Jun 17 19:42:57 2015 UTC,"To have an egg that fresh is really great.  As a test, you should try eating it - softboiled, scrambled, whatever your favorite way is - to get an understanding of exactly what a really super-fresh egg tastes like - a same-day egg, not days old, weeks old, even months old if it comes from the store.  This will help you acquire some egg-snobbery too.  When you eat store eggs or something from a restaurant, you'll KNOW.  Because you've had hours or less old eggs.  Be curious!  Find out what it tastes like!  Later on you can experiment and figure out eggactly at what point your eggs are at their flavor peak.  It may change based on time of year, their diet, even the weather.    But you'll still know what your hens are up to.  You'll become...  The Egg Whisperer."
BackYardChickens,3a6hj3,supershinythings,0,Wed Jun 17 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"You're funny and I love your user name. Too bad for me we hadn't expected eggs for another month and those girls like sleeping in their boxes. And pooping in them. A LOT. So I think she kicked away all the bedding in preparation for her egg and it hit the wood, cracking it. Which is why I heard it and knew I had ""witnessed"" her first egg. So the dog gets it cracked into his dinner tonight, lucky shitwad. He loves him some raw eggs. Meanwhile we will get curtains for the boxes so they stay out of them except for laying. Or at least I have seen that suggested before so it's worth a whirl. Already cleaned it out and put a nice layer of fresh bedding."
BackYardChickens,3a6hj3,Malthaeus,2,Wed Jun 17 22:53:38 2015 UTC,Soon...  You can begin your Egg Whisperer training.  Consider this practice.
BackYardChickens,3a6hj3,PlasticOwl,2,Wed Jun 17 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"We had chickens for years, I never got to ""hear"" one actually laid. I am frankly jealous  :-)    But our chickens would pretty often do the ""Egg Cackle"", did yours?  It's hilarious to hear!  Like they're bragging or something.  About giving your dog the raw eggs, if you think he can get near the chickens, some dogs will steal eggs if they get a taste for them and then you'll have heck trying to stop that.    P.S.  if your ladies are sleeping and pooping in the nests, maybe they have trouble getting on a roost at night?"
BackYardChickens,3a6hj3,rightc0ast,0,Thu Jun 18 01:39:09 2015 UTC,"I heard no cackle but you know what, both my chickens were in the box when she laid it. It seems like the smaller one never wants to be alone. I'm pretty sure he cannot get the eggs or the chickens. After being pecked on the nose a few times through the fence he is not even really interested. And he has eaten raw eggs for years and we just got chickens this year so I'm not sure how he'd associate the two. Unless maybe he could smell a cracked one...but I don't think he'd be motivated to get over the fence and then try to break into the coop. If he got over the fence he'd probably just go nuts on the blackberries and tomatoes to be honest.  And they can get on the roosts, I see them in the morning and at various times of the day. I don't know why they hang in the boxes like that really. I thought they were supposed to know what to do!"
BackYardChickens,3a6hj3,LydiaBendrick19,2,Thu Jun 18 01:47:37 2015 UTC,Our first was this past Saturday!   We now have four blue-green eggs.  The fourth was significantly larger than her first three.

BackYardChickens,3a79da,spotpig,3,Thu Jun 18 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"Saw in one of your responses that you have a secure coop/run but also let them do some free ranging daily.   We have foxes and hear them quite often. Lost a bird to a fox last Fall. We keep our flock in the run whenever we aren't home. On weekends we let them out after 11am. 1pm in the dead of winter when the foxes are most hungry. I start getting nervous if the birds aren't put away by 7:30 in the evening, 4:30/5 in the dead of winter again bc the woodland critters are hungry and light fades quickly.   It isn't perfect but, fingers crossed, it has worked for 9 months. I'm sure we'll lose another bird to predation but this is a balance of free range and protection that we feel is appropriate and feel good about our birds. This is the balance of free range and safety that we are most comfortable with."
BackYardChickens,3a79da,millipixel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:12:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I also let them  free range and now and then they are doomed but this is the circle of life. I don't have to kill them and I have new baby chicks. For me it's working for now.

Whenever I dig up the garden I find grubs, a few worms, and insects of various sizes. You might want to put them in a container to give to your chickens.  You can also trap earwigs and slugs and crickets. Put the crickets in a container with a few tiny holes, in the freezer for about 2-5 minutes, they will go to sleep. Then feed to chickens. Will chickens eat earwigs? Search Youtube for each trap type.  You can also breed your own crickets in a 10g aquarium, a taller Rubbermaid storage box, or something tall, with 4 inches of sand.

Ducks are way messier than chickens, I'm not familiar with any breed of duck that is anywhere near as reliable for laying eggs as most any chicken is, also a duck without water to play in is not going to be a happy duck.  If you want my advice, get a dominique, an americauna, and a leghorn, you'll get brown, blue or green, and white eggs (in that order).  Chickens are social animals so I'd never keep less than 3 at a time.  If you desire more than three, throw a Marans into the mix (a wheaten if you can find one as it lays the absolute darkest eggs I've seen) to add chocolate colored eggs to the mix.  It'll be like Easter every day without the food coloring stains on your fingers."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Grimsterr,2,Wed Jun 17 14:57:53 2015 UTC,sounds perfect.  How old should they be when I get them?
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,MelonHeadSeb,3,Wed Jun 17 15:12:11 2015 UTC,"I like getting mine at around 16 weeks old, which means they are on the point of lay, so they should start laying eggs a few weeks later and you can give them layer feed straight away."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Grimsterr,2,Wed Jun 17 15:29:33 2015 UTC,"Old enough to know you're getting pullets/hens and not roosters.  I'm terrible at the ""is it a rooster"" game so I like to buy no question about it hens.  You want as young as possible if you buy hens already laying so you get as much good egg time from them as possible.  Of course, everyone will say their hens are ""almost a year old"" you just have to trust the seller at his word, if they're not obviously still pullets.  Some breeds are easily sexable some aren't, my French Black Copper Marans keep me guessing sometimes till the only way I know which is which is who crows, and that isn't always a true indicator of male either!  I've seen females crow, my mom has a hen that crowed until I gave her a rooster (she had none) and now the hen doesn't crow, and has a baby she hatched."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,falk225,2,Wed Jun 17 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"It's really a matter of preference. The younger they are the more of their life cycle you get to experience, which can be a lot of fun. It is also more work though as eggs/chicks/and adult birds have different needs. I enjoyed hatching our eggs and see the chicks grow up, but if you are just starting out and a little nervous I would recommend getting birds that are already 1-3 months old if they are available. You will get eggs sooner and you won't have to relearn how to care for them every couple weeks."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Wed Jun 17 16:01:53 2015 UTC,How soon do you want eggs? Do you mind keeping peeps in a brooder for a few weeks? Do you mind eating or selling cockerels?
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,spiderdan13,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"Not in any hurry to have eggs, we have a little community farm behind the house that has chickens and I can go snatch up some eggs anytime I want. I think I've decided to get chicks, I have the equipment to make a brooder (I've had reptiles for years and have heat lamps etc), and I don't think I could eat the cockerel, but I could sell them or give them away."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Grimsterr,2,Thu Jun 18 12:18:22 2015 UTC,"I hadn't seen anything in my research on having a minimum of three chickens. I just started after researching for a while, and only have two. The girls are doing great so far but should I introduce another chicken to the flock? Which I've read a bit on the process on introducing them to the flock."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jun 17 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"2 is ok, I say 3 because if you lose one unexpectedly you still have 2.  I went for quite a while with 1 after April 27th, 2011 when I lost all but one hen in the tornadoes.  She did fine for a few weeks/months while we rebuilt and cleaned up then we hit the flea market and got some black Polish to keep her company."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,goldpickle,4,Thu Jun 18 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"First of all go ahead and check out the /r/backyardchickens ""Chicken Breeds"" wiki page (link in the sidebar). I volunteered to put it together myself, and designed it specifically so it would have all the basic information on each common breed in a compact, easy to understand form. They aren't all there, but all your typical ""feed store"" breeds are there, plus a few extra.  I'll also give my opinion, based on my work at a poultry specialty store (where we see hundreds of pullets of different breeds go through our doors each month) and my own experience.  If you want a very docile layer, go with Cochins, Brahmas, or Salmon Faverolles. They are the three calmest common breeds I've seen so far, and the Brahmas in particular I've had many people come back to buy more of, always claiming, ""They're so calm and sweet!""  If you just want an average flock who is friendly but not quite so much, go for any of the following: Barred Rock, Orpington, Wyandotte, Ameraucana (""Easter Egger""), Australorp, Red Sex Links, and Black Sex Links. (Rhode Island Reds are a good bird too, but be sure not to get more than 2 or maybe 3. They will often form a ""gang"" of sorts and pick on the other chickens. They are the only breed to do this.) Of the above breeds, most have a medium personality, but depending on time spent with them and the individual bird herself, some will be a bit more friendly and some a bit wilder.  If you want the best layers out there but don't care about personality, get a mix of Leghorns and Sex Links. You'll have both brown and white eggs, and the Leghorns will most like the very flighty, and the Sex Links a bit calmer.  Hope this helps.  EDIT - More info, since I realized I was NOT, in fact, going to be late to work, and had time to come back and read your entire post:  Ducks are a terrible idea. 10/10 would not recommend ducks. They're messy, smelly, loud horrors. I hate mine with a passion. I hate the goose, who is a bit cleaner, slightly less, but all waterfowl are very, very icky.  4-5 week olds are just a guess at sex. 8 weeks is a better guess, but many breeds will still fool you at that age. 12+ weeks is when they become definite.  Pullets can be a great option for a beginner and those who can't risk getting a rooster, however they are more expensive and sources are harder to find to buy them.  Personally, I would just get chicks. I've had maybe 250-300 birds go through my flock in the last decade, and exactly 1 of those was mis-sexed. Avoid bantam breeds and Polish (typically unsexed), and never get chicks from Tractor Supply Co., because I'm pretty sure they buy straight run (unsexed) and don't label them as such.  (Or, if you're in Northern California, I can recommend a fantastic place which regularly carries 8 week old pullets and a 100% ""If it's a rooster, you can bring it back!"" guarantee.)"
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jun 17 15:17:32 2015 UTC,Id like to know that place in northern California :)
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,rigby_321,3,Wed Jun 17 17:00:03 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! Its called the Poultry Palace. Located in Placerville, which is in El Dorado county (near Sacramento).  I've mentioned several times in previous posts that I work at a ""Poultry Specialty Store"". Yes, this is the place. I was a customer for several years before I was hired part-time. There's a reason I've been so loyal and I've been so happy to start working there. It's really a fanatic place to be all day.  Stuff:   We sell pullets, usually in batches of a few hundred, typically bringing birds from the growing barn to the shop in batches of 50-100 a day. The pullets are 8 weeks old, and we carry many different breeds - in most batches, we'll have all the common breeds - Barred Rock, Ameraucana, Delaware, Rhode Island Reds, etc. We also carry different less common breeds, which depend on the specific batch thst comes in - we've had Silkies, Polish, Hamburgs, Cochins, Partridge Rocks, Marans, Salmon Faverolles, Blue Laced Red Wyandottes; in fact, today we even had a few Sultans! We get theses batches in every few weeks, although the popular breeds (especially Easter Eggers/Ameraucanas) often sell out within the week.  We also usually have chicks in the store, sometimes only fifty, sometimes 300. We carry turkey poults and guinea keets some times of the year as well.  We sell Bar Ale feed, which as anyone who feeds it knows, is the best feed available. It's 10 times the quality of feeds like Purina, and the organic and non-GMO options are considerably cheaper than those offered by other local brands.  We have everything else you need too - heat lamps, feeders, waterers, poultry dust, DE, treats, bedding, even a few coops for sale.  Our guarantees: We give a 1 month health guarantee, so any birds who become sick or injured within the first month you can bring back for a refund or exchange. We also give a 100% female guarantee. All our birds are sexed with 95% accuracy, but if one of those 5% slips through, we'll take it back as long as you have the receipt.  And I personally can vouch for the excellent care of the birds. I think we've all seen the situations some feed stores have going on - dirty water and food, pasted butts on half their chicks, the trampling of sick and dying birds. This is due to feed store's lack of time and knowledge about these birds.  The owner - my boss - Jay, has had 35 years experience. He actually cares about the birds, and he knows how to care for them. Whenever I'm there, I personally clean all their feed and water, so I know that they're being kept at a very high standard of care. And I know that Jay keeps them just as well as I do on the days I'm not there - always clean feed and water, always healthy birds, regular preventative care and supplements, not to mention all the treats that Jay's resident pet flock of 8 gets during lunch time."

BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,manakopi,2,Wed Jun 17 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"I did some research and lucked out by finding the exact breeds I was looking for at a local rural supply store: Buff Orpingtons and Wyandottes. Both are really docile and have adequate egg production. Mine haven't started laying yet, and apparently it's a thing to sometimes have to wait for many months before anything shows up. But both of these breeds are mixed when it comes to egg production versus meat production."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Aplos9,2,Wed Jun 17 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"I had Wyandottes, they are fine layers, but not very friendly.  My Barred Rocks, on the other hand, are the sweetest chickens I have ever had.  And mine lay every day in the spring, summer, and fall, and mostly every day in the winter."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Wed Jun 17 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"It takes 6 months for them to go from chick to laying, so if you're looking for eggs soon you may want to see if there are older birds available in your area.   My main interest is ducks, I got the chickens because everyone kept telling me how messy and frustrating ducks are so I wanted to be able to compare. Having both creates challenges because the ducks don't mind a bit of moisture but the chickens can get ill if they are too moist.   Pros on ducks is that the males are silent, and there are a lot of low-quack varieties. Mine (which are Cayuga) bunch together in a flock and generally stay close to home. Their poop is less solid so it washes away easier, they are less succeptible to disease. I prefer the taste/texture of duck eggs to chicken eggs. They are bigger so are less likely to become prey for hawks when fully grown.  Cons is they don't produce as many eggs as chickens, some hybrids may come close, but not the general case. They manage to get everything wet even with nipple waterers -- I have mine in their outdoor run so its not an issue for me. They need access to water deep enough that they can submerge their heads, and prefer swimming water (Muscovies are happy enough without swimming I have heard.) My ducks don't have much personality at this point, they are fun to watch because they are pretty, but they never really try to do anything interesting. I'm pretty sure they do everything by committee and if one decides they don't want to swim, they don't swim.  For chickens my chickens manage to get into everything, they are a lot more adventurous. On the other hand they also are much more schedule based, they want out of the run first thing in the morning and are back in as the sun sets. I have barred rocks and golden sex links which are all very friendly they run up to me and want to hang out unless I try to pick them up.  edit: for spacing, didnt realize I wrote so much"
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,chingchongtong,2,Wed Jun 17 17:20:28 2015 UTC,The sweetest most prolific egg laying hen I had was a red star.  Just my 2 cents.  And they are sex-link so no worries about roosters.
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Thunder_god1987,2,Wed Jun 17 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"The best egg layers are not the friendliest. That's ok. Do some research for yourself and pick some breeds.  Chicks are generally available as day olds and as started pullets. Do not expect to be able to buy birds at any arbitrary age.  Re: chickens vs ducks. Do more research on ducks and decide if you want ducks. They don't lay year round. They are filthy. Ducks can be very rewarding, though."
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Thunder_god1987,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:39:30 2015 UTC,Thank you.  I think I have decided to just get a mix of chick breeds.  These will be more for pets and entertainment than anything.
BackYardChickens,3a5qzn,Thunder_god1987,2,Thu Jun 18 12:21:10 2015 UTC,"Ducks are REALLY REALLY loud, my cousin who has them says that they usully lay year round, and are great for garden (poop can be used right away, and theyll eat slugs/snails, wont dig like chickens). Downside is they're really really loud, really dirty, and you can't really leave them alone for a few days (their water will foul very very quickly.)"
BackYardChickens,3a4m6f,Drgnchasr,7,Wed Jun 17 04:43:51 2015 UTC,So sorry :(
BackYardChickens,3a4m6f,dotMJEG,7,Wed Jun 17 06:02:48 2015 UTC,"Get an air/ pellet rifle if you can, or a paintball marker, foxes hate those and they won't penetrate skin. A less-lethal solution.   Otherwise a .22lr or .17HMR will suit you well.   Make sure you have rock/ wire going underground from their enclosure as well, have had a few critters dig under our chicken-wire outdoor cage, we now have about a foot of rock/ wire underground."

I'm just here to confirm that the guns you buy at the big box stores are not powerful enough to penetrate the skin of a fox or ground hog. They will scare them and leave a bit of a bruise, but that's all. You need at least 1000 fps for that, plus a hunting pellet would help too. And you won't find 1000 fps unless it's from a hunting store, or sports specialty store like MC Sports."

Spray down the dirt every morning, and early afternoon if you're home to do it. Alternately, you can purchase a standing mister to run all day - but then again, given the current drought, the first method is probably better.  You can also provide frozen treats - freeze blocks or slices of fruit like watermelon or cantaloupe, and they'll pick off them during the day as they melt. You can add ice cubes to their waterer as well.  Make sure they have plenty of shade, and a covered/shaded place with loose, cool dirt so they can dig deep and dustbathe."

BackYardChickens,3a3tka,nefariousmango,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:13:18 2015 UTC,Yup.  We pasture our chickens with some horses and one drowned last week in a large water trough that has both a chicken rescue ladder and a chicken boat in it (because chickens are dumb).  I have seen one hen purposefully get in and out of the trough before to get a drink so some chickens can handle water better than others :-/

It's what's made them survive from extinction for all this time. They are prey, and prey is... well, it's eaten. A lot. If a chicken didn't go broody as often, there'd be less prey created, and therefore the species could quickly die out.  Chances are, really, that your hen would have gone broody anyway, with or without the sudden loss of the other chicks."

An 8 week bird will be fine without heat unless you're in the dead of winter. All your 8 week birds can go to general population. They don't need to be in a brooder at that age, though you could keep the hurt one in a hospital cage just to play it safe.  My birds hit the yard at 4 weeks. Never had a problem. Unless you're posting from southern Australia or something, it's probably ok to shut down the brooder."

I would have used the whole thing as a good experience to teach your kids about the food chain, their part in it, and how that little chick is truly just the mcdonalds nuggets they love so much. but that's just me. i wouldn't have spent money to take it to the vet.

BackYardChickens,39zqnd,on_a_moose,8,Wed Jun 17 05:55:10 2015 UTC,"This whole mess happened because of how contagious broodiness seems to be. 4 out of 8 of my ladies are now committed to sitting (including my lone bantam silkie, who can't be convinced that her eggs aren't fertilized), leaving the other 4 to be ""shared"" by my three roosters. They're sitting on a grand total of ~35 eggs, so I hope to god that there are some ladies growing in some of them!  ...and yes, I do have another vacant nesting box just a couple feet away. That's how they work, am I right?  These broodies drive me nuts, but it does melt my heart to watch them help each other rotate the eggs while they make cooing noises for the growing chicks. <3"
BackYardChickens,39zqnd,GallusLafayetti,11,Tue Jun 16 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"There are a number of things you should do/improve if you want to successfully hatch out chicks. Just letting them do whatever they want, with that many eggs is a recipe for disaster, or at least a big mess. You should limit the number of eggs to what each hen can comfortably brood on, candle and mark viable eggs, and remove any that aren't fertile or appear to have died. You should also be careful about staggered hatching, as it can put chicks who hatch later at a serious disadvantage. Ideally, you want all of the eggs in a clutch to be no more than a day or two apart.  It's personal preference to some extent, but I find it better to select a hen who will be the broody and exclude others. If necessary you can use a large cage like a dog crate to accomplish this. It prevents fighting over the eggs, and the chicks, and fighting among the hens after hatching.  The first thing you should do is candle the eggs, and remove any that aren't viable. It's very hot under a hen, and infertile eggs will spoil quickly. You don't want to be around when those break, and it's best not to let chicks be exposed to that kind of gunk either.  If you have other questions or I glossed over anything, hit me up with a reply. I'm happy to help."
BackYardChickens,39zqnd,paisleyterror,6,Tue Jun 16 04:38:40 2015 UTC,"This is a helpful post. I just had my first broody hatch her own eggs and made lots of mistakes with it. Some of the other ladies were determined to sneak eggs under her and, in moving them, I broke 2-3 of the ones that were developing. Whoops. She got 3 hatched and I think I'm going to remove the rest since she's now busy taking care of chicks.  Total mess, but I've learned a lot for the next time she decides to brood a batch: mark the eggs she's sitting on, limit it to 8-10 eggs. Added 2 new nest boxes in addition to her little brooding box, so we should be all good for next time with no egg hiding. The other hens don't seem to care much about the chicks that hatched, so that's good.  e: She's a silkie, no chance in getting her to not brood at least once a year, if not more. She's a determined little girl."

I finally got around to a culling day recently, and did the guinea as well.

BackYardChickens,39vp1e,Sharnevain,2,Mon Jun 15 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"That sounds.... incredibly strange.  You should apply lots of neosporin to the area daily. Make sure it is regular neosporin, NOT the kind with pain meds or anything ending in ""-cain"" in the ingredients; the ""cain"" medications are poisonous to birds/poultry. Chickens usually don't need much else for wounds; I recently had a turkey with 6 inch long/2 inch wide mating wounds, which healed fine when treated only with neosporin."

Chickens are remarkable healers, so unless she gets a major infection, I wouldn't worry that much. Just keep a watchful eye on her for lethargy or major changes in behavior (especially willingness to eat), and keep the coop extra clean. In the future, it's best to stay away from hydrogen peroxide when it comes to deep wounds...it kills off certain bacteria and can potentially make room for nastier types.  If it makes you feel any better, last year, my favorite Brahma hen ripped herself free from a hungry fox and got a pretty deep wound. All I did was make sure she wasn't getting pecked by her coopmates, applied a tiny bit of Furazone every day for the first few days, and you can't even see a scar today. :)  I followed this article back then."

Dirty liars, I say...)  And yes, I would be concerned about their health because although I doubt he would attempt to fight with or attack them, he would be very interested in breeding with them. At that age, they will be very resistant to mating because they haven't developed the instincts to be receptive to it yet, so this can result in chasing, feather-pulling, etc. The difference in size is also a concern.  They would probably be ready to go together around 4-5 months. You will need at least 6 pullets; 8-10 is even better. Otherwise the rooster's attention will be too concentrated, resulting in feather loss."

Cheap feeder = homer + 2.5 gallon homer + a 2"" hole saw fitting I had lying around + a couple nuts & bolts to bolt the 2.5 gallon homer right above the eating hole, fill with food and then put the lid on, total cost about $8 assuming you own a hole saw already and some nuts and bolts lying around."

BackYardChickens,39t8kz,lamia_ubyr,2,Sun Jun 14 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"The 8 week olds should be ready to mix around 12-14 weeks. For now, you can fence off an area of the pen (4 ft. chicken wire works well) and send them out in that. A dog kennel is all they'll need at night. Whatever temperatures are in your area, there's nothing 8 week olds can't handle that adults can. They stop needing special heating around 5-6 weeks.  When they do reach 12-14 weeks, you should mix them with the others during the night, by setting them on the roost beside your larger birds.  If you put them out closer to 12 weeks than 14, you'll need to mix your grower feed with your layer for the next 1-3 weeks. 50/50 should be fine."

BackYardChickens,39tg72,Aerron,2,Sun Jun 14 21:11:23 2015 UTC,Thanks I’m going to use regular play sand inside the coop only because I plan to use a shop vac with a piece of screen inside as my filter to catch the droppings.  Out in the run ill put down concrete sand and some gravel which I haven’t decided on yet.
BackYardChickens,39to97,IdesofBlue,2,Sun Jun 14 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"Put a 1 inch thick layer of pine shavings in the tub. Newspaper is too slick, cedar/other wood shavings are bad, towels are only ok if you only have a few chicks, and straw is icky and easy to get tangled in. In the middle of the tub, on top of the shavings, put down a sheet of thick paper; kind of like colored construction paper. You can probably find a large piece at Office Max or the like. Scatter a handful of feed across the paper. Be sure to put Sav-A-Chick electrolytes and probiotics in their water.  You can remove the paper after 3 days or so.  And for reference: don't put down paper for any future chicks you hatch yourself. By the time hatchery chicks reach you, they are already 2-3 days old. This means their legs are formed correctly by this age. However, when you hatch your own, they are put into the brooder at a few hours of age. If paper is added, the slickness can cause difficulty walking, resulting in splayed or spraddle leg. But, as I said before, it's fine to do with hatchery chicks - they've already been on their feet for some time.  And I wouldn't give ACV at such a young age. Probably 8+ weeks would be a fine time to start adding it."
BackYardChickens,39to97,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:36:44 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice. I am only getting 4 chicks for now. I have a roll of brown paper from Lowes that you put down so you don't mess up your floors during a project. Will that work? And do you do that instead of a feeder for the first few days?
BackYardChickens,39to97,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jun 15 02:49:09 2015 UTC,"That sounds fine, actually sounds a lot like what we use for our chicks at the store.  Add feeders too, but make sure and scatter a handful across the paper. It means the chicks see it as soon as they're put in, and start eating as soon as possible."

BackYardChickens,39rkj2,Slaquor,4,Sun Jun 14 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Most likely coccidiosis which ruins the lining of a chicks intestinal tract and impairs their ability to get nutrition from food. Sometimes it's just failure-to-thrive without an obvious cause, some unknown infection that keeps the chick feeling too sick to eat or grow.   In my experience it is too late for effective treatment for this chick; in the unlikely event that it lives, it will always be smaller and weaker and will succumb to death relatively early in life. It will also host every viral and bacterial disease your birds are exposed to which weakens the overall immunity of your flock.   Is it crying a lot? I would take the chick away from the others and use scissors to chop it's head off quickly and without fuss, the chick won't even know what happened.  In the future, keep an eye out for early symptoms like pasty butt and excessive crying. Sometimes there's just nothing you can really do, it's heartbreaking but it happens."

BackYardChickens,39rkj2,SliceOfFrenchSilkPie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:20:26 2015 UTC,Is it being crowded out at the feeder?  I had that issue once and more feeders helped catch it up (not so sever a difference).  And not sure if I missed it - hatched yourself or bought?  If the latter maybe a younger chick got mixed in with older ones.
BackYardChickens,39rkj2,limmster,2,Sun Jun 14 12:53:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is being crowded out, but I'll watch for that closer to see if it's happening. I bought these chickens, but I bought them  about 5 1/2 weeks ago. I bought them all when they were about 3 days old. It's just weird because this one seems like it is about 6 days old.

BackYardChickens,39rd6b,mmccarthy781,4,Sun Jun 14 00:30:41 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the hen. Some girls will break two weeks in, before the eggs ever hatch, and some will stick with it for more than a month. Hell, I have a turkey hen who's going into her 6th week right now.  Maybe not go for eBay eggs. Try to find somebody local instead - it's a lot cheaper and there's a lot less loss, on the chance she does stop sitting.  If you decide not to give her eggs, the best way to break a broody is with wire. I tried for about 2 weeks with my Rock hens recently, finally gave up on throwing them out of the coop everyday and stuck them in my wire battery cages for the night. They were broken by morning. Maybe that's not always the case, but I'll say I was impressed by how quickly the method took this time."
BackYardChickens,39rd6b,GallusLafayetti,2,Sun Jun 14 00:39:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  I'll try and get them locally, but I don't know of anyone up here in Massachusetts who has them for sale and craigslist isn't turning up anything.  And this might be a stupid question, but she isn't able to starve if she's broody too long is she?  I'm still relatively new to chickens, so I'm a bit worried about that."
BackYardChickens,39rd6b,GallusLafayetti,2,Sun Jun 14 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"Try the backyardchickens.com sale section. You might find something already up on there, or you can post a wanted add. If you don't really care about breed, it shouldn't be too hard find some.  No, she'll feed herself. Hens typically loose weight during the brooding process, but she'll gain it back once the chicks hatch. For now, she'll get up every couple days, eat and drink, and leave massive smelly broody poops all over.  Although I do like to help them out when hatching time comes around by leaving a small bit of feed and water near the nest. They can be quite reluctant to leave the nest for nourishment when their babies are just hatched."
BackYardChickens,39rd6b,mrscarrieoke,2,Sun Jun 14 01:01:08 2015 UTC,She won't starve herself. She needs a lot less when she's broody and not producing eggs.  Another option is to try getting chicks and shoving them under her. Some people have had success with that!
BackYardChickens,39rd6b,20years_to_get_free,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:18:32 2015 UTC,"We just had exactly the same problem.  For 2 weeks we kept throwing her out of the nest and trying to get her to break broody.  Finally, we decided that letting her have chicks wouldn't be so bad. We got a dozen eggs from a friend of ours who has a rooster, and stuck them under her.  We figured if she quit halfway through, no loss, since we weren't planning on more chickens anyway.  We have never done this before, so were very nervous.  We only candled once, at 10 days.  Found 3 unfertilized eggs, so we tossed those.  On day 21, exactly, she hatched 7 of 9.  One didn't make it out, and one was a dud (candled it after the others hatched, and it was all liquid).  She has left the nest with the chicks and is teaching them how to catch bugs at 3 days old.  This is the coolest thing we have ever done.  TL/DR: if you have room for more chickens, it is totally worth it to let her sit some fertilized eggs.  You will love the experience."
BackYardChickens,39rd6b,moosobay,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:46:23 2015 UTC,"She'll probably sit on them if you order them in time. If you're in the market for some potentially fertile eggs, I could ship some. I raise silkies."

I think (but could be wrong) that you won't see proper feather regrowth until they go through their molt. I wonder, if your rooster's spurs are very sharp, if filing the tips smooth would help. When I had a rooster I didn't see feather breakage and it was just him and my two hens, but all he had for spurs were smooth little nubs."

You have to keep those saddles on for a while or use light to trick their bodies into thinking its fall. That is, deprive them light. That's what the commercial egg factory farms do to increase production.  You may want to trim or remove your roosters spurs.   Additionally, give him some more hens so your girls are not overbred."

BackYardChickens,39pb3o,pileated_peckerwood,5,Sat Jun 13 17:44:03 2015 UTC,"It's true. Whenever I cull a bird who had a full crop, I pull it out and take it back up to the flock to let them pick it open. They usually get little scrappy bits of meat too.  And my indoor hen, Misha? Her favorite food is chicken. If she's indoors while I'm cooking chicken, she stands at my feet, begging for scraps. I've even seen her steal raw bones from the dogs in the past."

It really won't hurt them to be ""naked"" though. They will tend to hang out in the shade if they are getting too hot. They won't broil themselves. I have a half bred frizzle polish who is half naked all the time, doesn't seem to affect her in the least. I would though if I were you clip that rooster's spurs and think about adding a couple more hens or separating him from the ladies if you want. I mean unless you are hatching eggs."

Some birds will never like being picked up and having lotion rubbed on them but you can sneak up from behind and spray them. Seriously, chickens sunburn just like people."
BackYardChickens,39prff,number114,6,Sat Jun 13 15:47:59 2015 UTC,You cannot add smaller chicks to full grown chickens.  They have a pecking order and will harass and peck that little thing to death.  You will need a separate living space for it to grow up. Once it is about the same size as the adults you can slowly start introducing them.  They will return to their pecking order and harass her again.  She will at this time be bigger and have an easier time putting up with the abuse while they decide where her niche will be on their totem pole.
BackYardChickens,39prff,Masil123,3,Sat Jun 13 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"It's very, very bad to add only one chicken to a flock, especially young pullets. You need to find her a buddy, within 3 or so weeks of age. Once her and the buddy have bonded, you can make a separate area of the run for them to hang out in - 4 foot chicken wire works well to fence off a corner or side area. They should also have a small dog crate inside the coop for the night time.  After about 2 weeks of this, you should wait until night time, remove the dog crate, and set the two birds on the roost next to the others. They'll wake up together in the morning, and this should reduce stress and picking."

BackYardChickens,39prff,LosIslenos,2,Sat Jun 13 19:26:23 2015 UTC,"Is there any way you can fence a portion of the yard just for her?  The big girls can see her and be around her, but can't actually get to her?   This is how we introduce young birds into our flock.  We let them be outside in a ""playpen"" for several weeks before letting them out."
BackYardChickens,39prff,Aerron,2,Sat Jun 13 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"I would wait until she is 14 weeks old, and introduce them in an area where she has PLENTY of room to move away from the bullies (such as a free-ranging situation). I just introduced a single pullet to my flock of adults at approx. 14 weeks of age and I didn't have any problems. However, when the flock isn't free-ranging, they are kept in a 10x20 run, so she had plenty of room to escape from anyone who was picking on her. If there is one or two hens in particular that are relentlessly picking on her, I would remove them for a couple of days while she establishes herself within the flock. However, part of the reason that I didn't have any problems is that I keep Faverolles, which are a very docile breed to begin with. When I had an Ameraucana and a Barred Rock, they were the bullies of my flock and picked on any new members that I introduced."
BackYardChickens,39prff,absinthy,2,Sun Jun 14 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with this rule if there were still, say, 3 or 4 pullets for her to group together with, this is actually very dangerous advice when there is only one bird. I do sometimes do a quick introduction method like this with my young birds, but when I do, there is typically a minimum of 5-6. Usually more like 10-15.  Even if she was introduced very slowly, keeping a lone bird in the yard is quite dangerous."

BackYardChickens,39lp75,paisleyterror,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:28:16 2015 UTC,Now that's a beautiful baby!
BackYardChickens,39m6zh,quack_quack_moo,2,Fri Jun 12 18:41:33 2015 UTC,"This little pullet had a serious case of wry neck as a wee chick.  Twice a day, she got some Nutridrench (via an eyedropper) into her and a few weeks later she started to do much better.  I never separated her from the other group o' chicks;  I felt by keeping her with the others she would be forced to keep up her strength (and avoid loneliness- a single chick peeping away all by itself is pretty sad).  Now I have a best friend whenever I go out."
BackYardChickens,39m6zh,Zebba_Odirnapal,3,Fri Jun 12 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"Had an Orpington who got limberneck at 4 week. Fed her with a tube for a few days until the paralysis passed, while holding her on my lap for hours a day. Now she's always the first one on my lap when I visit the chicken yard."
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,bonobo1,3,Sat Jun 13 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"I say shoot it. Clearly it's not going to give up, and probably won't respond to being asked politely to stop."
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,DogNamedZeke,2,Sat Jun 13 01:29:47 2015 UTC,"Judging by the accent, the guy would have to shoot it with a thrown rock.   SSS only works if the first S is occasionally heard. In Europe you'd never get to shovel and shut up."
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,rightc0ast,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"Could you not use a slingshot, or some other similar method?  Pepper spray, for example, would definitely ruin that fox's day."
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,serpentjaguar,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"You can, but neither would deter a fox for more than a day, just teach it to be sneakier. Plus, pepper spraying anything, probably, is against the law there. Can you even buy that stuff in European countries?"
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,rightc0ast,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:22:23 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between using weapons on animals/pests and people.  Sling shots, cross-bows, swords etc are perfectly legal here, as are shotguns and rifles (under licence).  Just don't carry them for self defence against people, and only use against a person if force is proportionate.    I think pepper spray is actually illegal under some obscure noxious fumes and gases legislation, but it would be illegal to carry for self defence against a person anyway, but perhaps not a bear.  Considering our most dangerous remaining native land animals are either the badger or the fox, I doubt there's much call for non-human pepper spray application in the UK.  edit: clarified pepper spray"
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,justinsayin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:24:08 2015 UTC,Now I kinda want to see a man fight a fox with a sword.
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:27:58 2015 UTC,"I think a slingshot would be unnecessarily mean, likely to cause serious but non-fatal injury.  You can get shotguns and rifles without too much trouble in the UK.  It's largely just handguns that can't be licensed."

We already had a fox that was really aggressive (I yelled at it from the window and the dude just backed up a few feet), but haven't seen him for a few days."
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,spotpig,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:29:38 2015 UTC,"Luckily, in the UK, where I think this is taken we're rabies free.  I guess that would be another very serious reason to shoot the blighter though, as well as the obvious risk to chickens."
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,jrwreno,0,Sat Jun 13 23:40:48 2015 UTC,What idiot decides to open free-range their chickens in FOX country....with their property surrounded by forest?   An idiot that does not care enough about his chickens.
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,jrwreno,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"These chickens are perhaps not truly backyard, but I hope the sub will find the video interesting none the less.  The chicken owner’s love for his livestock is obvious, but also he has a respect for the fox to an extent that could be considered excessive by many chicken owners.  And then there’s the assertiveness (desperation) of the fox.  He may be used to humans, and that particular dog may not be able to outpace him, but many dogs can and will easily rip foxes to shreds.  We have at least one fox around here, and in an urban area. My chooks are safe from foxes during the night, but they don’t have any serious daytime protection.  I’ve only ever seen foxes active in between dusk and dawn and not had problems with them over 4 years, but I'm increasingly considering installing an electric hot wire/ribbon atop of the exiting 5ft or so fence. I guess it only has to happen once and then the fox will be back again and again.  So kind of better not to let it happen in the first place.  This will involve cutting back some trees and shrubs though, so will have to convince the other half.  Anyone else have any thoughts either on the video in general or on my electrification proposal?"
BackYardChickens,39nh6f,VaruStorm,2,Sat Jun 13 00:30:39 2015 UTC,I have to wait until at least 11am to let chickens out for free range time. Our foxes are active in the late morning when I thought they'd be asleep (learned this the hard way...). There are plenty of critters for them to eat in the woods and I appreciate that they keep a balance in nature. I respect them as predators and accept some risk with my hens. But I do try to set my girls up for success and safety as much as possible. I am far happier to see foxes in the area than coyotes and would actively try to remove coyotes if they lived in the area.   The man in the video clearly cares for his animals and probably for wildlife - including foxes. Not a fan of his set up but people gotta do what they gotta do.   No opinion on the electric at the top of your fencing. My gut feeling on it says they'd be more likely to dig than go over the top of your fence.
BackYardChickens,39m3cb,Boshaft,2,Fri Jun 12 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"I miss the chickens of Key West, except when I was trying to sleep amd some damn rooster was parked outside my window."
BackYardChickens,39nfsw,chingchongtong,3,Sat Jun 13 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"These eggs were not shipped, picked up locally."
BackYardChickens,39nfsw,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Sat Jun 13 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't incubate shipped eggs underneath a hen, I would put them in the bator and give her the chicks. Shipped eggs already have their issues.   You're just gonna have to wait it out and see if they survive.  Edit: wow I'm stupid, I read your comment and totally didn't process it. Anyways, like it said, you're just gonna have to wait it out. Be on duty in case any chicks need help out."
BackYardChickens,39nfsw,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat Jun 13 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"Large air sacs can be seen in eggs that were transported roughly; this could mean shipped eggs or even just a short but bumpy car ride. Sometimes it also happens for no reason.  I've had two batches of eggs that were shipped, and both had huge and/or sideways air sacs. One got a pretty good hatch rate (3/6) and the other got a pretty poor one (3/24).  Not much you can do. Just make sure the hen keeps sitting."
BackYardChickens,39nfsw,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat Jun 13 01:27:59 2015 UTC,What about these sideway ones? Yeah bumpy car ride for sure...
BackYardChickens,39mka5,gotskott,4,Fri Jun 12 20:13:51 2015 UTC,I would leave it on the coop. It's not an especially strong poison. Not really much reason to wash it down.
BackYardChickens,39mka5,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:25:23 2015 UTC,I was wondering about the strength.  Thank you for your advice!
BackYardChickens,39mka5,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Fri Jun 12 21:37:18 2015 UTC,"Leave it. In the future, look for regular garden-grade Sevin dust. You can directly dust your chickens in it."
BackYardChickens,39m24d,Xaneran,2,Fri Jun 12 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"Based on typical minimum space requirements (4 sq. ft. per bird coop space, 10 sq. ft. per bird run space), you can fit 20 chickens in your run and 20 in your coop. So technically you are a little over your requirements, but since some are bantams, it's more or less perfect. And when it comes to coop space, minimum requirements can be bent; as long as you don't see any picking or cannibalism, and the coop doesn't get gross faster than you can clean it, you can probably just add more roosts and have room 30 chickens. As for run space, I'm glad to hear you're adding room! While coop space requirements can be bent, it's always best to give them more run space than the minimum; lots of space = happy birds.  Well, a little white egg means that either your Silkie roo isn't a roo (Silkies are near impossible to sex until they've laid an egg or crowed) or your 3 month old Silkies are older than 3 months.  Here's a really helpful page I found regarding the bloody egg."
BackYardChickens,39m24d,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Jun 12 18:33:13 2015 UTC,"The Roo is the father of the chicks, we are more than 100% sure he is a Roo, and I hatched the chicks which were laid as eggs on February 8th."
BackYardChickens,39m24d,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Jun 12 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Well then it must have been one of your other Silkies' eggs. Oh, did you mean the 3 Silkie hens you have are adults, and the Silkie chicks are three months old?  Even an old hen can have a strange egg. So if you're sure the chicks are only 3 months old, then it was definitely one of your three adult hens who laid the egg."
BackYardChickens,39m24d,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Jun 12 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"We have 3 one year old Silkie hens, the year old rooster, and 6 silkie chicks whom are 3 months old. Then the 12 red hens, all 15 of the hens are laying and the chicks I'm fairly certain are not as they are still young."
BackYardChickens,39m24d,SchipAlong,2,Fri Jun 12 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"So you're pretty sure it isn't anything major or fatal seeing as you don't seem too concerned. (I'm not being passive aggressive here, I'm just curious what you think.)"

BackYardChickens,39jg5j,LupoCattivo,4,Fri Jun 12 03:45:09 2015 UTC,"You should remove her from the yard immediately. If it is contagious, the chances are pretty good that the rest of the flock already has it, but there's no harm in caging her anyways. Put her in a dog crate, cage, or cardboard box, and keep her somewhere warm and not extremely bright/loud. You can offer her Sav-A-Chick electrolytes and probiotics in her water, or Gatorade if you don't have SAC on hand.  Do a full physical check; pat down every part of her body. Check for any growths, abscesses, or tumors. Check for lice and mites and their eggs. Put her beak very close to your ear, listen to her breathing. Put your ear up to the side of her neck, an inch or so above her crop, and listen again.  You mentioned your other hen had trouble walking; can you describe this to me more? Was she just reluctant to move and/or very slow, or did she seem to have poor coordination/loss of muscle control? Did her legs, wings, or neck seem paralyzed in any way?"

A few of my flock were also having feathers broken in half. I thought it was just from the rooster mating them but his feathers were breaking in half too. I gave them all vitamin supplements mixed in with their food and electrolytes in their water. the hen that was acting paralyzed I gave doses of Vitamin supplements from a syringe. after a few days, she got better and was soon back to her old self. I didn't ever have the soft egg problem though. I might try vitamins. maybe she is deficient in something?"

BackYardChickens,39gmx7,poorsoi,7,Thu Jun 11 16:17:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, so, in order to get her out of her broodiness, you have to make it impossible for her to keep her underside warm.   Wire cages for showing or whatever work well. Place it on top of some buckets or something so that there is nothing beneath the hen but wire. Put some water and food in.  She'll try and try to cozy up to something, but she'll give up soon. It may sound cruel but she'd be keeping herself cooped up while brooding anyway.  If you don't have anything for that sort of setup, you may just have to keep tossing her out. Don't leave any bedding for nests and remove eggs immediately (although they rarely care if they have eggs under them lol).   I had a hen that I tossed out of the nesting boxes twice a day, and she'd puff up and run around all hunched over, pissed off. Then she'd go find the barn cat and chase it, run back in the coop.... It was a mess. Took quite a while. Your hen is probably still eating and drinking, but you might not notice it."
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,BirdLadySadie,4,Thu Jun 11 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is a good alternative to locking the girls out of the coop overnight. I'm still concerned she'll just bounce back into broodiness in a few weeks, though."
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,DeeDee304,4,Thu Jun 11 18:38:47 2015 UTC,"My grandma, an old farm gal from the Italian alps, used to dunk her chickens in cold water when they went broody. Since she needed the eggs for bread and pasta (which she made from scratch daily), her hens either layed or became zuppa. There is some info on this cold water method on the internet.   Edit: I do not raise chickens  (yet) due to my move every couple of years lifestyle, so take my advice with a grain of salt. I threw it out there because I have discovered over the years that my mom and my Nonna's Italian peasant style of gardening/small farming works amazingly well and is easy on the earth."
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,Aerron,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"We've had a bit of success with the water method.  We had a silkie that would go broody every couple of months.  Dunk her in water a couple times a day and she'd come out of it.  Plus, as hot as it is, dunking her would likely cool her off."
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,DeeDee304,2,Sat Jun 13 13:54:02 2015 UTC,Nice to know it works so well!
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,jimevansart,3,Sat Jun 13 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"I just recently broke one of mine from being broody. I tried the water method, just holding her there. Seemed to work for an hour, but thats it.   I finally just kept up with removing her. And even shut the coop entrance once I knew the other two had layed. The biggest helped, seems to be when I covered the nesting boxes in the coop at night. Cause I found her a couple times in the morning in them.   I do have the advantage that I work from home, and can see the coop from my desk. That helped me keep an eye on her."
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,whatsreallygoingon,3,Thu Jun 11 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"I just got my chickens back from a friend who was keeping them for me. One of my hens went broody as soon as he took them, and has spent the majority of her time there brooding.  She was in bad shape when I picked her up. My friend had been kicking her off the nest twice per day and couldn't break her.  I put her in a pet carrier and took her for a 45 minute ride to my place. She snapped right out of it and has been back to normal for a week and a half. It might be worth a try to take yours for a drive?"
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,whatsreallygoingon,3,Thu Jun 11 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"I'm glad your hen is alright! I'm able to break her fairly easily by locking her out of the coop, but I was hoping there might be a way to avoid going through this cycle every few weeks."
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,SchipAlong,2,Thu Jun 11 23:54:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! Mine never went broody until she went to stay with my friend. She went from sleeping and laying eggs in a smallish tractor (one box for three hens) to a deluxe coop with multiple nest boxes (one each for six hens).   I've wondered if the spacious digs inspired her to start a family? I'd be interested to hear if anyone else could make that correlation with their broody hens?
BackYardChickens,39gmx7,Aplos9,3,Fri Jun 12 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"Only if you have rational chickens lol. My hen's broody trigger was danger. The first time she went broody was after I tried to blend my LF and bantam coops, and my Barnevelder failed that by getting progressively more dominant each day. After I removed the LF my tiniest d'Anvers was like, ""well, having that giant monster chicken beat us up was quite the horrifying experience! Guess it's time to have babies!"""

She has only ever done it when I was already holding the other one. I think she is smart and knows who gives her the good stuff. They LOVE yogurt and I'm the one that feeds it to them."
BackYardChickens,39i6pm,Moral_Gutpunch,2,Tue Jun 16 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"When my girls were young, I would use one of their sisters as ""bait"" to catch them one at a time and get them back in the brooder.   Teenage chickens are pretty flighty so I would get one, hold her in my lap, and another would show up all ""Hey what are you doing in there? Oh noes!"" and I would catch the flighty one."

BackYardChickens,39fih0,Zebba_Odirnapal,3,Thu Jun 11 15:41:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction!
BackYardChickens,39fih0,heathenyak,3,Thu Jun 11 21:56:16 2015 UTC,I'm currently building a new run and planning to use corrugated plastic roofing to keep other bird droppings out as much as possible. I'm in MN in the heart of bird flu territory. I haven't heard of anyone with a backyard flock getting infected.
BackYardChickens,39fih0,RW_Highwater,2,Thu Jun 11 12:18:34 2015 UTC,"Really interesting that backyard flocks aren't as affected. I wonder what the ultimate differences are and if backyarders with ponds are still at a higher risk.   I've contemplated the corrugated plastic. I designed the largest/widest run I could which, in retrospect, makes any sort of top cover more difficult."
BackYardChickens,39fih0,heathenyak,4,Thu Jun 11 14:12:50 2015 UTC,Really interesting that backyard flocks aren't as affected. I wonder what the ultimate differences are and if backyarders with ponds are still at a higher risk.    Same reason cities are hotbeds for disease: population density.
BackYardChickens,39fih0,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Thu Jun 11 15:12:26 2015 UTC,"It's going to be really expensive to cover my run. I may not be able to do it this year.   No one is sure why back yard flocks seem unaffected. Genetic diversity is as good a reason as any. I have 3 kinds of birds. No one I know who keeps chickens has fewer than 2 breeds.   I also turkey hunt and the dnr is handing out pamphlets on what to look for in wild bird populations. When to contact the dnr, etc."
BackYardChickens,39fih0,fredeasy,2,Thu Jun 11 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"Re: diversity and turkeys.  Turkeys are often carriers of a milder strain of Mareks. Exposing young chickens to a turkey is a good way to build their resistance vs chicken-Mareks, as the antibodies are somewhat compatible and turkey-Mareks isn't harmful."
BackYardChickens,39fih0,whatsreallygoingon,3,Thu Jun 11 15:44:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in Texas and I have tons of wild birds in my area.  There are 2 hawks, a pair of Blue Jays and another pair of Cardinals using the same dirt as my Chickens so the possibility is there.  Overall I am not concerned."
BackYardChickens,39fih0,GallusLafayetti,2,Thu Jun 11 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Well, the primary threat is waterfowl so if you aren't seeing those birds then that is definitely good for your flock."
BackYardChickens,39fih0,sadpony,3,Thu Jun 11 14:09:02 2015 UTC,"Oh great. My chickens are in the back yard and there's a public lake in the front yard. So many people feed bread to the birds that I'm amazed at their ability to walk. The moochers come running when you step outside. Forget about trying to spread fertilizer or ant bait. They'll eat it up.  The waterfowl can't get into the back yard, but the songbirds do; and they drop the bread into the yard, and eat the cat food. I'm watching my girls with dread, for fear that they'll be afflicted."
BackYardChickens,39fih0,heresyandpie,3,Thu Jun 11 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"My personal flock hasn't been affected, but I've had a behind the scenes glimpse on how it's affecting the market and hatchery availability. The poultry specialty store where I work has been getting shorted chicks on nearly every order coming in; just today, there was a pretty bad short: we got 40 turkeys when we should have had 80, and between the three chickens breeds that were short, we had maybe 50 chicks that should have been there that weren't. I personally was quite disappointed about this; I was supposed to get 7 BB White turkeys, and now I'm stuck with 1 BBW and 4 BB Bronze.  I suggest everybody gets their hatchery orders in early next year. There's going to be a lot of demand, and not enough supply."
BackYardChickens,39fih0,J973,2,Thu Jun 11 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I'll share our plans: Our run is now covered in netting (done anyway because of hawks and our chickens were easily flying out of the 7ft high fencing...). I plan to build some new enhancements for mental stimulus in the run because we plan to limit their free range time during migration season."
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,lucariojr,5,Thu Jun 11 03:12:09 2015 UTC,Really strange. Looks like the entire foot is pretty messed up. Do you have any better pictures?  Do the scales look like they're lifted up? Do you see any mites? It could be an issue with scaly leg mite.  Are there any wounds or cuts on the leg? What's going on with that patch of skin above the swollen area?
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,GallusLafayetti,2,Thu Jun 11 03:29:02 2015 UTC,"There are no wounds on the leg that I can see. We've cleaned the leg with iodine and antibiotic ointment and the scales seem to be healing, but the leg is still swollen. I'll take more pictures when I get home."
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,cheezerman,5,Thu Jun 11 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"This is bumblefoot, an infection of the foot. We've treated it by soaking in warm Epsom salt water, but minor at-home surgery and antibiotic powder might be necessary."
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,Chlamedia,5,Thu Jun 11 05:49:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with cheezerman. Look for a black pimplelike thing under the foot, my chicks always had them in the center. I would seperate it from the others. Had 4 cases in 1 week, no fatalities in my flock at all. We did this little surgery thing and treated it with chick-proof antibiotics (cant recall name right now, google will find it quicker than me). What confuses me is that like /u/galluslafayetti says it looks like the rest of her leg is swollen, and while this might be because of me never seeing a bantam, my chicks only had their feet look bad."
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,Chlamedia,2,Thu Jun 11 06:28:03 2015 UTC,What kind of 'surgery' are we talking here?
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,cheezerman,2,Thu Jun 11 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdigBHE-GsQ something like that. Basically cut off the black part under her foot. Our chicks took it like champs. I couldnt do it at all though, luckily my girlfriend is tougher than me when it comes to blood and such.."
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,soykommander,2,Thu Jun 11 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"Like Chamidyia said, you're removing the hard impacted part of the wound, so it can heal properly. Just be careful of sanitation and clean everything. The funny part about our birds is that once you get them restrained, they resign to the fact and are very stoic. Literally the hardest part of this surgery is catching and restraining them. Watch some youtube videos and read up. I'd try the Epsom salt soak first"
BackYardChickens,39e2t6,johnnyssmokestack,3,Thu Jun 11 23:13:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what to do with this hen. We treated her for scaly leg a few days ago, but her right leg isn't getting much better."

My grandpa was a grocer all his life and while he never became wealthy, that guy had an amazing business acumen. Running a grocery can be a lot tougher than, say, running a hardware store where durable product can simply sit on the shelf indefinitely.

I've mixed all sorts of breeds with no real issues.  Some breeds are better layers, some are better brooders, and some are just fun to watch.

The average chicken's cycle is every 25-26 hours. Some days, it skips. Most hens lay 4-5 or 5-6 a week. This results in some days with fewer or no eggs."

BackYardChickens,39b375,lehthanis,4,Wed Jun 10 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"Introduction? Don't.  Quarantine. 12 meter air gap is usually what's recommended. Maybe if you have room, put up a new yard with chicken wire on the opposite side of a building from the existing yard. Doesn't have to be fancy--if you don't have t-posts to spare you might be able to use scrap lumber or drag some timber poles out of the woods. Tying up with fence wire is cheaper than using hog clips and won't make a huge time difference unless you're setting up a long run of fence.  Since it's summer your young birds will be fine in a box outside. Turn a tote upside down and cut a door and some ventilation holes, and the 5-6-week-olds can sleep in that.  But don't introduce the two flocks to one another without a quarantine unless you're willing to replace them all."
BackYardChickens,39b375,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Wed Jun 10 16:30:41 2015 UTC,what is the difference between being quarantined since birth at my inlaws down the street and being quarantined 12 meters away for however long I'm supposed to do that in the same lot?
BackYardChickens,39b375,Zebba_Odirnapal,3,Wed Jun 10 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"If you're confident that they are disease free, sure. Go ahead and mix them."
BackYardChickens,39b375,Zebba_Odirnapal,3,Wed Jun 10 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not necessarily confident so much as unsure about the quarantine circumstances.  What's the timing? Is the 12 meter air gap supposed to be enough for no diseases to pass?  What's the difference between them having lived at my in-laws down the street as opposed to 12 meters away.  What I'm most worried about is behavioural issues with mixing the flock.  Do I need to do anything to give them time to become familiar with each other and not have the old birds try and kill off the new ones.  How much time do they need to look at each other across the fence to not try and kill each other?  I know they'll need to establish a pecking order, and there may even be a cockerel in the mix now where as the old hens don't have any male exposure."
BackYardChickens,39b375,ship_tit,3,Wed Jun 10 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"Adult hens are more of a threat to a 6 week old cockerel than he is to the hens.  If you have observed both flocks for a long time and are confident to skip quarantine, maybe just divide your chicken yard down the middle for a few days. Six week olds will be fine withot a roost as long as they've got a box to sleep in at night."

Thanks for the feedback on the behavioural thing though, that's the big answer I was looking for...a few days is the kinda metric you can probably gauge by watching their interactions with the fence in place?"
BackYardChickens,39bqds,DTRIK302,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"4.5 feet? That's easy, chances are he jumped the fence, wandered too far, and got taken by a predator. You need to replace your fence with 6 foot fencing, at least, and probably something stronger than chicken wire alone; garden fencing with the chicken wire on the outside of it should do the trick. Do it ASAP; 12 weeks is around the time most breeds start to realize that low fences are, well, low. Chances are good that you'll lose more if the fence stays the way it is."
BackYardChickens,39bqds,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jun 10 19:05:20 2015 UTC,That's what I figured that he possibly jumped it and couldn't get back in. Of course my father says oh he jumped pretty high a few days back I forgot to mention that to you.

Sometimes hens will even lay them for weeks at a time for no reason, an stop for no reason. Watch your birds closely for the next week or so, just to be safe; there are a few diseases which cause shell-less eggs, but they are all quite rare, so it's not something I'd really spend time worrying about."
BackYardChickens,39blnz,cant_stop_dreaming,2,Wed Jun 10 17:37:47 2015 UTC,"Don't introduce one; no matter what, you should always add in pairs or more. She can't pick on them both at the same time.   They can be introduced as early as 12 weeks; they need different feed than her - don't put them on layer feed, switch both her and them to grower feed. Adults can be introduced whenever you want. But be sure to remember quarantine! Any birds you get from questionable sources (craigslist, livestock swap, etc.) need to be quarantined for a minimum of 2 weeks before introduction to your flock, to prevent diseases from spreading. Quarantine them somewhere separate from your coop; a large dog kennel or cage in your garage or laundry room works fine. Remember to wash you hands after handling or caring for them.  When introducing, you should put them out in the coop in a separate area for a few days; an area of the run fenced of with chicken wire and a dog kennel in the coop works fine. Usually it would be a week or longer, but I'm not super concerned about it since there'll only be one of we an two or more of them. After these few days, just go out at night, and set them on the roost next to her - they'll wake up together and go out into the run the next day."

We had the 2 new pullets in a dog kennel in the chicken area for 2-3 weeks. This allowed for a ""look, don't touch"" period.   Then, with heavy supervision, we had times each day they were let out with the rest of the flock.   The flock begrudgingly accepted they were just a part of them, and eventually let them in.  Now you couldn't tell a difference in behavior.   The biggest complication for us was the original flock beating up on each other to re-establish a new pecking order. They did this during the look, don't touch period.  The lowest hen in the order was then the only one that did anything to harm the new pullets, which was why they were supervised at first."

Firstly you need a privacy fence. Put a privacy fence, board on board since you can see through the slats, around your entire backyard. Plant bamboo around the perimeter, it gets tall, crazy tall and offers lots of privacy and a sound barrier.   Second, know your rights. Animal control are police officers, and they cannot come on your property without a warrant. Use this to your advantage. Code enforcement can fine you but not without proof. If you don't pay the fine they can put a lien on your house. I advise you to avoid fines if at all possible. Don't let them in if you have birds, or you can have code enforcement come by when the birds are stashed in the house. They are also not allowed to look over your fence but they can look through it.   Learn to not answer the door. Use your peephole. Know your rights and do not consent to searches."

Attend council meetings. Look into joining boards or committees. Build up your resume. Do your research. Make connections.  This may take some time.  But in a few years, when you personally have three or four council members on your side (that are looking forward to eggs) have a well-regarded personality, have reams of evidence as to the historical, economical, and environmental benefits, and maybe even a petition of several hundred fellow citizens who support it, you can make your move. Hell, you can probably write the law yourself and just present it to the council to approve as written.  Be as professional and respectful as possible. This is how it's done.

BackYardChickens,39871b,poorsoi,4,Wed Jun 10 02:49:53 2015 UTC,"Theory does not equal reality. Realistically, this is how government works.  An individual who  gets worked up because they suddenly realize they're up against the law is not considered to be noteworthy - they are little more than a protester. The government doesn't listen to protesters. They only listen to protesters when there are vast (we're talking vast) numbers.  Usually when there is a law on the books, it got there through a long and laborious process, that went through various consultants, lawyers, boards, think tanks, and focus groups several times before finally being put through multiple readings and revisions, and ultimate approval by politicians. A law represents an incredible investment of time, money, and research. They are not going to go through the equally laborious  process of reversing or amending a law because of a handful of disgruntled individuals.   The government works very slowly for good reasons, the main one being stability. People generally have short memories. What happens to be the cause celebre one day is relegated to the dustbin of anecdotal history the next. (Reddit is full of it.) If the government bows and sways to the whims of a relative few individuals, it compromises that stability. This includes something like backyard poultry: if one person raises a stink about it and the government bends, then the next 10 people are motivated to raise concerns about a whole slew of other matters. The government would like to avoid that.  That is why the best way to effect change in the law is to already be an active and well-known member of the community. Be one of the people that is respected enough that when these ordinances are bouncing around in the government machinery, you are one of the people consulted. It pays dividends for everything. /u/DoctorYogurtButter may be able to change the backyard fowl ordinance, and then several months later help determine a speed limit, or where to construct a recycling center, or what to name a park. At the very least, make contact with several members of the city council before you start raising a ruckus at the next public meeting.  Of course, much of this has to do with scale. If OP or anyone else is living in a very small community, one voice is given much greater weight."

Long story short, the HOA reaffirmed a no-chicken policy, but told me outright that they would not ever check my yard. If I tell them I complied, and they get no complaints, my girls are safe.

BackYardChickens,39871b,Yanrogue,-9,Thu Jun 11 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it might be to some one else's benefit, that's a very selfish and short sighted way to live your life but if that's how you want to do it that's your prerogative.   Conviction rates are dropping in the states partly because people like yourself refuse to talk to the police, which you are entitled to do, but it doesn't help any one except the criminals."
BackYardChickens,39871b,murtrondar,8,Wed Jun 10 03:41:58 2015 UTC,"Well, since they generally view citizens as either criminals who haven't been caught, or out right threats then your statement is pretty much correct.   How about they stop harassing, threatening, illegally arresting, destroying private property, murdering innocent and non violent people, killing family pets, initiating violence when their authority is questioned in any way,  lying, committing perjury, tampering and destroying evidence, planting evidence, exhorting, outright stealing,  actively looking to incarcerate anyone they come into contact with, defend and exonerate their obviously corrupt and guilty brethren, etc.   When they earn back the trust they have been abusing,  then maybe they won't have people who refuse engage them when approached. Right now it is a matter of self preservation and good judgment to not speak with law enforcement voluntarily, and only with a lawyer when forced."
BackYardChickens,39871b,murtrondar,2,Wed Jun 10 09:48:33 2015 UTC,Well said!

I can tell you right now that the overwhelming majority of them are not like that. There are a few bad ones, like any job but those are the ones that make the headlines. You are doing your own community a disservice by making sweeping generalisations and assumptions about people who for the most part got into the job because they wanted to make their communities a better and safer place. But once again, that's your own prerogative."
BackYardChickens,39871b,Bigdx,7,Wed Jun 10 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, there are only a few bad ones. Then there are many more that cover up for them and facilitate moving them around when they must be ""fired"".   How many corrupt cops,  how many videos of one or more of them beating/murdering citizens while the others stand around, how many ex cop whistle-blowers are fired/harassed/threatened/assaulted/murdered for bringing events to light?   Seriously, take a reality pill.  The saying you are alluding to is ""A few bad apples... Spoil the whole barrel"".  So in that respect, you are once again right.  Until we stop suffering cops murdering people, lying/planting evidence, having a different set of rules when they break the law, and generally abusing the citizens get used to thus attitude growing.  Only those good cops can stop this and reverse course, but they are the ones standing around and/or harassing people who video while those few bad cops beat someone to a pulp."

BackYardChickens,39drlj,TheLurkerSpeaks,3,Thu Jun 11 02:03:34 2015 UTC,"Get rid of the silicone and great stuff. For some reason, chickens love to eat foam. If you don't remove it, they'll do it for you."
BackYardChickens,39drlj,SeymoreBhutts,2,Thu Jun 11 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"I am interested in taking this thing down off its stilts, put onto the ground, and making it into a chicken coop.   Based on what you see in the album, what would you recommend I do in order to create a functional coop? What should I add, take away, etc? Willing to take any and all suggestions."
BackYardChickens,39drlj,baldylox,2,Thu Jun 11 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone here has the right idea. You'll have to make a ladder for the entryway that's less steep and more chicken friendly. Maybe cut some more windows out and cover them with chicken wire. It would be a good idea to make wooden, hinged doors to cover the windows in the winter. In the summer you'll want plenty of ventilation and maybe even a fan.   You'll want a people ladder, too, so y'all can get up there. Keeping their feed and water in the coop will encourage them to live there. Otherwise, they may find someplace else that they like to live.   Think about something to keep them safe from predators. Cats, possums, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, etc. - all kinds of critters that live in the city - will get them quickly if they're not very safe. I keep miniature donkeys to protect my animals from predators, but that's not an option in the city.   I'd panel the inside and pull the carpet. Painting the inside with lime paint - it's like whitewash - will make it easier to clean.   Chickens like to roost, so I'd pop a couple roosts in there and some nesting boxes. You can fill the boxes with straw or pine shavings. Putting some fake eggs or golf balls in the nesting boxes will encourage your hens to lay there, where you want them to.   The lime paint will make the inside easier to clean out. I wouldn't worry about spending weeks making it look like a photo from Good Housekeeping. The whole thing is going to be covered in chicken shit in a day or two anyway. Chickens are wonderful pets, but they're little shit factories.   Good idea to invest in a good pressure washer if you don't already have one. You'll see what I mean eventually.   That should do it, but like any new venture you'll learn what works as you go. You can read a hundred books on caring for chickens, but evidently the chickens never read those books.   On really hot days, the fan will be great. A good heat lamp in the winter will keep them warm and happy. Chickens love watermelon. That's a great summertime treat that keeps them cool and hydrated. Chickens can overheat and die. I've seen it happen when it gets up to 106 or 109 here before. :-(  Linoleum on the floor would be good, too. Think something that's easy to clean.   Good luck with your hens! Let me know if you need anything else. Since you're local, you can bring the family out to visit our farm and chickens if you like. It might help you know more about what you're getting into. My wife and I have no kids, but we love it when kids come out. ;-)"
BackYardChickens,39drlj,sampson158,2,Thu Jun 11 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"+1 to this, But I'd recommend leaving some room underneath for the chickens to get under the coop (2-3 ft).    For that matter, have you considered using it right where it is, with a trap door opening to a chicken ramp leading out underneath.  You could just go in underneath and use hardware cloth (many times better than chicken-wire I hear) to create an enclosure underneath the coop.  You can hang a bucket of water with water nipples in the bottom under there, and a hanging feeder down below too.    If you wanted to allow them to ""free range"" then you could also consider placing a small door in the framing underneath for them to get in and out of.  You just have to let them in and out (unless you want to build an automatic door).    That's what I would do."
BackYardChickens,39drlj,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Sun Jun 14 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"Well as long as it's not in the neighbor's yard...  Pull the carpet. Slap down some epoxy or bedliner on the floor. Knock some windows and cover them with hardware cloth or chicken wire. Add a big ol' chicken ramp and a pop-door. Add some roost bars and some nest boxes and hey buddy, you've got a tree coop."

BackYardChickens,3966sn,moneyshift,13,Tue Jun 9 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"You're probably right.  This flu epidemic is nature's way of giving the finger to factory farms and centralization in general.  The system is broken.  Perhaps this will finally give incentives to more people ""on the fence"" to raise happy and healthy chickens who will then provide themselves and other locals with good quality food."
BackYardChickens,3966sn,fredeasy,4,Tue Jun 9 18:05:34 2015 UTC,Not really.  Influenza has been passing between species for longer than humans have existed.  If you want to blame anyone for these types of outbreaks you need to be looking at south east Asia where human contact with birds and lack of sanitation is high.  If anything factory farms make containment easier.
BackYardChickens,3966sn,loveshercoffee,3,Tue Jun 9 18:44:11 2015 UTC,How long would the flu take to kill 50 million chickens if most eggs came from small farms and backyard flocks?  Because just shy of 50 million since December is the number of chickens and turkeys in the US either killed by the flu or destroyed because the facility they were in was contaminated by the H5N2.
BackYardChickens,3966sn,nspectre,4,Tue Jun 9 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"It would slow the progress but not eliminate it.   The primary vector is through the feces of wild birds. Secondarily, through saliva and nasal secretions. So, unless you know of a way to keep ALL other birds from flying over your chicken territory or landing and drinking, eating, pooping, sneezing, etc... it's still going to be an issue.   Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza virus through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry, or through contact with surfaces (such as dirt or cages) or materials (such as water or feed) that have been contaminated with virus. People, vehicles, and other inanimate objects such as cages can be vectors for the spread of influenza virus from one farm to another. When this happens, avian influenza outbreaks can occur among poultry."
BackYardChickens,3966sn,Cat-tastick,2,Tue Jun 9 21:37:02 2015 UTC,"Also, if most eggs came from small flocks and backyard flocks there would be a shortage of eggs. It's not sustainable for our rate of consumption."

BackYardChickens,398flh,SchipAlong,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:19:23 2015 UTC,"Chickens are social animals. Two will keep each other company fine, but three is a better number, since they will always find creative ways to die, and a hen who was raised with company won't do well if her only buddy dies.  You can raise a singular bird by itself, but it will most likely become very attached to you, and probably become stressed when you are not with it. Not a good idea, unless it is, say, a house or therapy chicken."

BackYardChickens,396pbg,Grimsterr,3,Tue Jun 9 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you. So they are contained to just their coop all winter? No insulated ""roaming"" area? That's what I was curious about. A coop doesn't seem like much space to be stuck in for months"
BackYardChickens,396pbg,Grimsterr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"I have my coop inside a 12x12 (or 10x10 I forget which) chain link dog kennel.  On days where I'm outside I'll let them roam the yard, but I've found during wintertime the predators are much bolder and hungrier than in summers so they only get let out if I can supervise.  They're often let out during summer for most of the day."
BackYardChickens,396pbg,upnorthhickchick,4,Tue Jun 9 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"I live in northern Michigan and it gets COLD. If my chickens are going to have an issue with the weather, it will be in the heat and humidity of the summer. The important thing is to understand the difference between ventilation and drafts. They need the former and not the latter. I have a metal box with a lightbulb in it to keep the water from freezing (most of the time). Honestly, the chickens can easily leave the snow, but the cold does not bother them at all."
BackYardChickens,396pbg,20years_to_get_free,5,Tue Jun 9 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"Wide roosts (2x4s) so they can perch sitting on their flat feet.  Keeps the feet warm.  Draft free coop.  Try deep litter method for overwintering.  It generates a bit of heat.  Mine free ranged during the day all winter, and wandered all over the snow.  I had one get in trouble when she stayed out in the rain to eat worms, got wet, and then the temps dropped into the single digits.  I put a heat lamp in the coop, and put her under it and she was fine."
BackYardChickens,396pbg,wmartin428,3,Tue Jun 9 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"Make sure your coop isn't drafty. They crowd together for warmth. In most places they will be fine, unless you live in Antarctica or something."
BackYardChickens,396pbg,Zebba_Odirnapal,3,Tue Jun 9 18:37:26 2015 UTC,Adult chickens are fine down to zero F.    Don't hatch chicks in the winter.  Don't raise bantams or Mediterranean breeds if you have harsh winters.   Chickens are tough. Don't worry about winter unless you live in like Alaksa or extreme Northern Midwest.
BackYardChickens,396pbg,not_whiney,3,Tue Jun 9 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"Couple of points.  Chickens roost. That's what they do. So make sure they can do that. They need a bar or a 2x4 layed flat that they can get their feet on and then sit down over their feet. They will fluff up the feathers to trap air as insulation and the feet stay warm.   NO DRAFTS. it needs to be ventilated so that they stay dry. You can't have condensation or damp build up. But no drafts or air currents blowing thru. This goes back to one. If their are drafts the air doesn't sty on the ruffled feathers and they get too cold.  Bird to coop ratio. If you have a very large coop but only a few birds then they will not get as ""cooped up"" in the winter and peck at each other out of frustration or boredom. But too big a coop and they can't keep it warm with their body heat. Balance in all things.   Combs are the worst spot. Get colder hardy birds with small combs. When it gets real cold go put vaseline on the combs before bed."

BackYardChickens,396pbg,raevnos,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"I live in an area that routinely gets well below zero before windchill (I never pay any attention to wind chill it's for folks who don't understand cold) it's not at all uncommon for us to get 10' of snow in a season without a single melt off.    My birds are free to come and go from the coop any time they like EXCEPT when it gets below zero when I put them on lock down but it doesn't matter because they really stop wanting to be outside when it gets down into single digits anyway.  Water I keep liquid with the use of a self adhesive 100 watt oil pan heater and a submersible thermostat intended for folks who keep reptiles. Keeps the water at a consistent 70 degrees regardless of air temperatures, and it isn't on 24/7.  I never heat my coops.  Used to.  I stopped in the interests of reducing my energy consumption and per egg costs.  The only thing that's on in my coop in the winter time is a single florescent bulb in order to stretch ""day light"" to the 12 hours they need to lay consistently.  Ventilation is the key. You need a way to evacuate the warmer, wetter air at the top of the coop.  Cold air is dry air.  Dry air is healthy air for chickens.  To that end I have vents up high and I never close my coop up entirely except on those nights where we are going to be wicked cold and the wind is going to be howling.  Even then unless you build your coop like a house with tyvex and caulk everything there will be enough airflow to keep most of the warm air moving via convection without too much trouble."

BackYardChickens,396o11,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Tue Jun 9 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"I called him back and he says his chickens use an identical coop as a coop and then he lets them free range instead of having a run. It does have hardware cloth on 2 sides but theres a 3 wood-sided structure inside of that. He said if I want a run instead of free ranging I could put one on the side with the door, as long as its big enough to put another big door to get in and clean it. Is it ok to have a coop thats not 100% wood enclosed as long as its enclosed with the hardware cloth?"
BackYardChickens,396o11,Grimsterr,2,Tue Jun 9 19:54:48 2015 UTC,Is it ok to have a coop thats not 100% wood enclosed as long as its enclosed with the hardware cloth?   Yes. You may need to provide a huddle box if you have cold winters.

I'd move it so the prevailing rains won't get inside it.  In my case this is turning it to the east in summertime, and straight south with a slight east angle to it during the cold times.  Most breeds are surprisingly tough old birds and can tolerate some pretty cold temps, as long as they can stay DRY."

I wouldn't feed grower so soon - they really ought to remain on higher protein longer than that. I would recommend the opposite - keeping them on medicated starter for a longer time period will not hurt them. Go ahead and buy another bag, and switch to grower whenever that bag runs out.  Straight switch is fine. I never introduce slowly, and it always goes without issue."

BackYardChickens,39561t,chingchongtong,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:11:25 2015 UTC,"Hm, that's not right. The ideal protein levels are 20% for starter and 18% for grower. I'm not why they would carry an 18% starter.  Anything between 22% and 18% is fine for a grower. For reference, I raise my meat birds and heavies on the 22% and any layer/pets/extras on between 20% and 18%. Honestly, more protein is fine, just not less than 18%."
BackYardChickens,39561t,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks - I was worried that feeding them chick crumb for too long would do them harm. The starter feed I've got isn't medicated (or if it is, it isn't mentioned anywhere on the packaging) but so far the chooks seem pretty healthy :)  The little b*stards have found out that they can tip over the feeder if all four of them rush it at once (started doing it yesterday, has become a new party trick...) so looks like I might get through another bag of chick crumb pretty quickly after all..."
BackYardChickens,39561t,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed Jun 10 08:56:04 2015 UTC,"No, they legally have to label if it's medicated. Medication wouldn't hurt them anyways, even if it was feed into adulthood - it's just usually withdrawn at 6-8 weeks because it's no longer necessary, and because they want to make sure there's no residue remaining when thy begin to lay eggs.  Since it's unmedicated, it could technically be fed into adulthood, with supplements of oyster shell, with no il effects. So yeah, you should be fine to switch them to grower after the new bag is gone."

BackYardChickens,392ob8,BrookieDragon,5,Mon Jun 8 20:35:46 2015 UTC,"I live in a neighborhood in Hawaii that has a ton of wild chickens walking around. I can drive down the street and see several different hens marching their young ones around. There are a bunch of outdoor cats around here too, but from what I've seen they all tolerate each other. Whether that's different for hatchlings, I don't know. But what I can get at that this area has to be at least remotely safe.  Also since its Hawaii we can cross off snakes, owls, most predatory large birds, raccoons, possums. Really regulated closed off community as well so no wild dogs. Just traffic, a house cat that might turn aggressive, boars, and peacocks (don't know if they are aggressive to chickens).  So what I'm getting at is that I think the chicks are pretty safe as is here. I'm don't want to ""keep"" them as all the chickens are wild around here. But I wouldn't mind being able to handle them if need be. Most of the wild chickens around here are at least tame enough already that you can walk out and throw them bread and they'll gather around you."
BackYardChickens,392ob8,20years_to_get_free,2,Mon Jun 8 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't so much as call the wild hens ""tame"" as I would ""indifferent to people."" You can't walk up and put your hands on any of the ones in the neighborhood, they'll keep a 15 foot radius around you unless you are throwing bread at them.  I tried putting a (gloved) hand on the back of hen on my porch.... that didn't go so well. She quite promptly attacks, but she's doing that to anything that gets too near her... a few doves after the bread I left her, a cat that just sat and stared at her, and (most frequent) other chickens that come up to my porch. I don't know if this attitude will persist after the eggs hatch, thats something I'm hoping someone else would fill us in on.  As far as where the other wild hens lay their eggs? No clue. I'm pretty sure they just find a quiet spot anywhere in the neighborhood and start laying eggs. This hen started by laying eggs in my baby stroller. We'd just go outside and see an egg in the stroller... I'd move it, then the next day I'd find two. Then next day another. Finally I put a towel out and just kinda wrapped the eggs and the next thing I know I got a brooding chicken sitting on them."

BackYardChickens,393t1w,myblueheaven,4,Tue Jun 9 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"Chickens lay weird eggs sometimes. Some have multiple yolks. Some have no yolks at all. Some have wrinkly shells. Some have no shells at all. It's even possible for an egg to have two shells. Big, small, round, pointy. Chicken eggs can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. In commercial operations, the weird eggs often get used in processed foods like mayonnaise or pasta. Short answer: Yeah, that's a pretty mild deformation.  Source: I've raised chickens for eight years and spent a very brief time sorting eggs for a commercial hatchery where I handled several thousand eggs a day."
BackYardChickens,393t1w,YardEggs,2,Tue Jun 9 03:23:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot to respond.  Thanks for the answer! I kind of figured that eggs mustn't always be uniform but the eggs that I buy (even at the farmers market) are always so perfectly eggy looking!

BackYardChickens,393t1w,chestypocket,2,Mon Jun 15 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"/u/YardEggs is absolutely correct. I've only raised a small number of birds, but have found a wonderful variety of shapes, colors and sizes. I've got a few birds that lay unusually-shaped eggs, and it's just a quirk of the hen and is consistent with every egg she lays. In fact, I can trace every egg I collect back to a specific lady from either the color, shape, or weight of the egg.  Here is a photo of a few eggs I have collected in the past few days. In the top row, from the left, we have a normal duck egg, an slightly skinny gray duck egg, and a double-yolk duck egg (it weighs nearly 5 oz!). In the bottom row, we have a nearly round chicken egg, a normally shaped blue chicken egg, and a small green chicken egg. I've also had one duck that would lay a egg that ranged in shape from football to torpedo, a chicken that would lay a chocolate-brown egg, and another chicken that would lay a pink egg with white spots. I've also had a few shell-less eggs and some wrinkly ones.  After raising chickens for a year, grocery store eggs are just boring."

BackYardChickens,391prn,AlpacaFight,2,Mon Jun 8 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"The ""penguin squat"" is one of the most well known signs of an internal layer. It's a somewhat rare occurrence, but does happen every so often. It's usually accompanied by yellow, runny poop that looks as if it contains egg yolk. It's usually considered incurable, but there have been reports of improvements while using VetRX as well as antibiotics such as Duramycin or similar.  Egg binding sometimes also results in this stance, although less often. I've found that warm baths and use of oil or a similar substance to lubricate the vent/inner area and make passing the egg easier can help. Calcium Injections are also considered helpful.  In situations of egg binding and internal laying, going to the vet is usually the best chance the bird has. If the vet is unable to fix her or is not an option for you, and she does not recover after several days, culling is unfortunately the best option, to prevent continued pain."
BackYardChickens,391prn,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jun 8 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response! I will definitely be trying extra calcium, as you and another commenter have both recommended it. I checked her again just now and she is still squatting and no egg is felt. I also checked poop for worms and the yolky substance you described. I have vet rx I'm going to try tonight as well."
BackYardChickens,391prn,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"I'd give her a tums just in case she's egg bound, worst that will do is cause her to expel an egg early and better safe than sorry.   How long has she been laying? How are the other hens doing? You say that they usually lay daily but aren't at the moment. So it sounds like something affecting the whole flock. It could be as simple as mites or a nutritional deficiency. It could be something as bad as New Castles... but if it were an illness such as New Casltes they would be showing other symptoms as well.  So check them for Parasites, give them some vitamins and keep a close eye on them. I'd give penguin chicken a tums to be sure she's not egg bound, large amounts of calcium suddenly introduced to the system causes them to expel the egg. To ease the process put a little olive oil or personal lubricant in/on her vent, this will help prevent tearing."
BackYardChickens,391prn,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! She has been laying since last November, and is about a year old. My hens just had a very traumatic experience with a fox (it chased my hens into hiding and killed my roo when he defended them), which is why I suspect they aren't back 100% yet. I just went to check her again, no egg felt and she's still squatting. I checked her for mites and took a look through their poop for worms and haven't found anything. They have oyster shell sitting out, should it still try tums?"
BackYardChickens,391prn,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"Yup I'd still try the tums, it gives a large dose of calcium more quickly than oyster shell would. It could be stress from the fox, but with the squatting I'm willing to bet shes egg bound or internal laying."

BackYardChickens,392d1s,sykofl,3,Mon Jun 8 19:20:42 2015 UTC,"At this point in time, her brooding has broken. Regardless of other behavior, roosting instead of sitting is a sure sign that she does not have or want babies.   She just sounds very broody. Some hens are like this. She sounds like she makes a poor mother however, so I suggest avoiding use of her as a broody.  You can cage her away from the flock for a week or so and then introduce her again; this could shake up her environment enough to change the behavior for some amount of time."

But, this is the first time she's continued to have the mama-like behaviour. When she had babies, she was amazing! She only hatched one (the others weren't fertile), but adopted 12 others--as many as would fit under her. And, that was her first go. Normally, she's very sweet towards everyone, but now, she just seems like she's protecting babies that aren't there. She even does the 'here's food' clucking.  I'll have to try the caging. Maybe that'll help. Thanks for the advice."

BackYardChickens,3935v8,GallusLafayetti,2,Tue Jun 9 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Outside of the USA and Canada, some poultry associations consider Araucanas with tails to be the corrct kind and rumpless ones are flawed.  As cool as those birds are I don't know if I could live with 25% in-shell mortality from the ear tuft gene. It's easy to see why Ameracaunas and our beloved EE ""mutts"" are more popular. I've got a pullet this spring that may yet turn out to be an Ameraucana if she lays blue. Still a very fun bird either way.  However, if I ever sold her fertile eggs or her chicks I'd be sure to come clean about her heritage as a hatchery EE. Heck, even some of my barred rocks have disqualifying leg and beak color. They're not for show so I don't care, but I would never misrepresent their bloodline if I sold them. Besides in this part of the county any barred bird is a ""dommynicker"" according to the older farmers. They know as much as the APA or 4H or anyone else, so I just roll with it ;)"
BackYardChickens,3935v8,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:41:32 2015 UTC,"Araucanas do not have muffs, but they do have tufts - instead of soft, fluffy feathers, they are hard - rather like a Polish's crest.

They aren't actually Ameraucanas in the first place, they're EEs, and now they're trying to change one of the few distinguishing features of the EE type. Ridiculous.

BackYardChickens,3935v8,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the hatchery must of had separate Araucanian dominant breeding stock with different characteristics, using Araucana and Ameracauna to differentiate their different EE genetics.

BackYardChickens,3935v8,GallusLafayetti,2,Tue Jun 9 04:01:05 2015 UTC,"If you got them from a feed store or similar, they are EEs. Commercial hatcheries may sell their birds as Ameraucanas, Americanas, Araucanas, or Easter Eggers, but they are only ever truly Easter Eggers. Easter Eggers lay blue/green eggs, and have muff/beards, pea combs, and slate colored shanks. These are the only traits they share - they can come in any mix of colors, weights, body types, etc. They are really more of a type than a true breed.  Ameraucanas and Araucanas are two distinct breeds that come from breeders. Ameraucanas lay blue eggs, have muff/beards, and come in distinct colors. Araucanas are similar, but have ear tufts instead of ear muffs, and are rumpless. You won't find true Amerauacanas or Araucanas in hatchery stock."

BackYardChickens,392q2t,Jackawolf,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, the biggest you can go - you won't be sorry. Also, 4 hours of sunlight is not great, but add as many windows as you can.  In the coop, 4 sq ft per bird and 10 sq ft in the run is a good minimum...However, birds do get bored in small areas, and since busy birds are happy birds, then happy birds are healthy birds...  I also agree, you won't have enough hens to have a rooster. (1 for every 10 hens or so).  It is better to have a minimum of 3 hens, in case one dies. They are very social and don't do well alone. If you can't provide some time on grass or in a yard to free range, you could add a plastic kiddie pool and fill it with clumps of grass, dirt and weeds for them to scratch and peck through. Chickens love to seek and scratch - they need that. They also need a place to dust bathe and a place to roost."
BackYardChickens,392q2t,Jackawolf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:19:36 2015 UTC,"sorry if i miss worded, but they will be outside all day, its just 4 hours of direct sunlight in the morning, then around 8 hours of shaded light on the side of the house, and i will close the coop every night. and i have already decided to take the advice of everyone else and not get a rooster. i was wondering if its ok to have the run permanent with them enclosed in it, but they cant free range because we have cats, and im unsure on how they would act if they were free range chickens"
BackYardChickens,392q2t,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:11:15 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. I think that is fine. If you had to pick one or the other, shade is better for chickens - so I think you actually have a great balance."
BackYardChickens,392q2t,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:15:48 2015 UTC,"10 sq. ft. is the rule to go by for their yard, or outdoor space. Their coop, where they will sleep at night, should be 4 sq. ft. per bird. Or, alternately, 10 sq. ft. if they will be confined inside the coop all day. Larger is of course better, and chances are you will want to get more in the future (everybody does), so if you can, go ahead and build larger. And remember to add roosts, they are just as if not more important than nest boxes. They should be made of rounded dowels 1 inch or thicker, or if you are in a cold area, flat 2x4s so they can sit down and keep their toes warm. Put in about 1 foot in legnth of roosting space for each bird.  If you are getting only 3 hens, you should not get a rooster, unless you are willing to spend about $7 per hen on chicken saddles. These protect the hens from rooster's sharp spurs and claws, which can damage hens if there are too few for him to pay mind to. These ones from Strombergs are very durable and will last for years, although they are not very pretty and the cloth is a little rough on hen's skin and feathers. These ones are also durable, however the cloth is quite a bit softer and they come in beautiful patterns. They are a little bit more expensive, but it's a one time expense, and I personally prefer these over Stromberg's saddles.  4 hours of direct sunlight isn't exactly perfect, as birds do like to dustbathe in the sun on warm afternoons, but I can't imagine they will have any real ill effects from it."

I had a chick that sneezed constantly until I started adding a bit of apple cider vinegar in their water, everything seemed to clear up after that.  But it sounds like your chicken has some sort of chest-cold, not the sinus cold mine did.  Maybe it's just a wait and see kind of situation? If she's not showing any other signs of being sick, I'd wait for a week or so to see if it just will take a while to get rid of the ick."
BackYardChickens,390f6a,kibitzello,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:55:16 2015 UTC,"We gave the first injection yesterday around noon. I gave the second one this morning before I left for work. I let her out of the cage for a few minutes and she was standing and walking fine, not swaying or anything like that. I gave her the shot of meds and rubbed her down again with the Vet Rx, I put it on her beak and then I rub my hands together and get it warmed up and rub under her wings and her throat and then just a general over the body rub. She seems to really like it. I also added some chicken vitamins/probiotics to her water with a few drops of the vet RX on top. She loves that stuff and goes straight for the little blobs of it floating on the top of her water.   Her appetite is still seemingly very healthy, I'm giving her mostly seeds and greens right now. I made a mix of chopped garlic, bib lettuces, a little grass, some clovers, basil, rosemary, and sage. She really likes the safflower seeds, but she waits until I pick out all the black sunflower seeds and then eats the little white safflower ones out of my hand. She's acting like a normal chicken other than the gurgling sound when she is breathing heavy and a few sneezes. She was also peeping like crazy this morning when my fiance and I would walk by. Yesterday she was very quiet and just seemed to be trying to sleep, but the stuffyness kept waking her up.   This is my first year doing chickens so I'm learning as I go and don't know exactly how to tell if she's getting better or if I'm just masking symptoms. I really hope she is better when I get home. We had to cull our rooster this weekend (we're in a neighborhood and he started crowing). We raised 4 chicks from peeps one ended up being a rooster, and one ran away or got eaten by a hawk, we're not sure. So we're down to two birds and the new one I got this weekend (the sick one) I'm going to be really bummed if she doesn't make it."
BackYardChickens,390f6a,kibitzello,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:26:47 2015 UTC,"Well, fingers crossed for you. Sucks to hear about your rooster. We're also in an urban setting and have a rooster in our mix. He's started to make crowing sounds, but so far it isn't any louder than the dogs or screaming children of the neighborhood, so we haven't done anything yet.  Your mentioning of how she seems to like the treatment reminded me of when I had a pullet who was having a bad day... I semi-diagnosed the issue as perhaps souring crop, so I offered the flock some plain yogurt. The sick girl immediately went after the yogurt and it's probably just my imagination, but it looked like she gave me a thankful, relieved look after her first few bites of it. Then she proceeded to devour the rest of the bowl. :D"
BackYardChickens,390f6a,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jun 8 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it took a lot out of me emotionally to kill the rooster after raising it from a baby. But I worked really hard to not get attached to him once I knew it was a rooster. The hens will be around as long as their natural lives will let them, so thankfully I'll never have to kill them unless they get super sick or something. The most upsetting thing is just how the girls are acting now that he's not around. They are obviously upset about it and a little scared when out in the yard. The one positive about the whole thing is that he was a tasty dinner for me and my friends and it felt really fulfilling to know that I produced my own food from peep to plate. I'm definitely an egger, I don't like hurting let alone killing an animal. But this is farm life and it had to be done."
BackYardChickens,390f6a,Jackawolf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a respiratory disease, not an infection. Respiratory infections are actually very rare in chickens; it's nearly always a contagious disease caused by a virus/bacteria/etc.  TSC's advice is typically BS. I've found their birds, feed, and knowledge to be extremely poor. Tylan is an OK way to treat respiratory diseases, but it's available in water solutions that are way cheaper, as are Duramycin and Gallimycin. I've spent maybe $30 on powdered water solutions of Duramycin in order to treat my entire flock of over 100 birds.  You need to put her in quarantine right now. Respiratory diseases are very contagious. Keep her somewhere far from the other birds, where no dander/bodily fluids can make contact with them, and disinfect yourself before and after handling her. Check her eyes for any bubbles or cheesy material, and inspect all your other birds for similar symptoms (especially in the eyes), and look closely at both her and their poop for abnormal substance or color. Do not let any friends who keep chickens into your coop right now, do not wear shoes you wear in the coop into feed stores etc. Do not take your birds anywhere or allow other birds into your flock.  If you find symptoms in any of your other birds, make an appointment with a vet as soon as possible. Find an avian or exotic vet, as most normal vets have no clue what they are doing. (If you're near Northern California, I can recommend an amazing one). Ask them to do a physical exam as well as draw blood. This sounds expensive, but my avian vet did it quite cheaply - under $100 to take blood and get her opinion based on examining two of my girls. (My flock was diagnosed with Mycoplasma synoviae a week later when the results came back)."
BackYardChickens,390f6a,davidwebb_uk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like MG. Go here and read the section under chickens: http:en.m.wikipedia.orgwikiMycoplasma_gallisepticum#Clinical_signs  If it sounds like what your chicken has, you might want to start some Corid or other brand of amprolium asap. All chickens should be treated, but symptomatic chickens must be quarantined.   Be aware that when you get new chickens, they must be quarantined before allowing them into your established flock...whether they seem sick or not."

BackYardChickens,38ye4h,dontforgetthelube,5,Sun Jun 7 22:10:42 2015 UTC,"Ducks can be kept with chickens, but firstly you should be aware that any birds you bring into your flock must be quarantined away from your current birds for a minimum of 2 weeks and preferably 4 to 6. This means they must be in a completely different area where their dander, stool, or other bodily fluids cannot make contact with your flock. You must also be careful to disinfect yourself before and after handling them. Even though they are a different species, there are some diseases that either A. Affect multiple species or B. Can be carried by ducks (or other birds) but not actually effect them, which is only noticed when susceptible species are affected. This is why it is a good idea to use a ""canary"": introduce a bird you are not attached to to the quarantine area, to see if it begins to show signs of sickness.  Next, some male ducks can be a danger to female chickens. Unlike roosters, who have only a rudimentary and almost entirely internal sex organ, male ducks actually have a penis, usually 1-2 inches long. They can hurt hens by trying to mate with them, as hens are not designed to be bred like that. Not all male ducks are a danger to hens - I have a sweet Rouen male who has been kept with chickens for well over a year and never shown a bit of interest - but some definitely can be.  Thirdly, ducks are messy. They are very gross with their water - even if you offer them a baby pool or DIY duck pond, they will still find time to dirty your chickens' drinking water, turn the area around it into a mud pit, and leave very runny, smelly poop all over the entire yard. I have heard that some duck/chicken owners have turned to nipple watered to solve this problem, but not all like to use nipple waterers, so it's really a personal choice.  However - ducks can be quite fun. They are loud, silly animals, and pretty fun to watch. They are also very good layers - as good as most Leghorn chickens, except the egg is much bigger - although the eggs taste somewhat different than chicken eggs. I don't know if you are into meat birds, but if you are - ducks taste much like a very, very good chicken, and they grow much faster.  Adding new species is always fun, and ducks are no exception. While mine can be irritating sometimes (they really are quite messy!), I do enjoy seeing them out in the yard with my other birds."

BackYardChickens,38yjde,Jackawolf,2,Mon Jun 8 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"Relocating raccoons is never a good idea. You are not only making them someone else's problem but you are likely sending it to a rather inhumane,  unpleasant death. Raccoons are territorial and putting it in another territory presents a host of unpleasant results.  The raccoon may have babies who will be abandoned and likely starve. The raccoon may search desperately for the babies she is separated from. The raccoon will not know how to find food in the new area or where to go to escape from predators. The raccoon will likely be attacked and killed by raccoons who live in that territory.  Your best bet is to predator proof your chicken coop and run. When they cannot access your chickens, the raccoons will move on"
BackYardChickens,38yjde,Jackawolf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned this animal may be rabid and/or dangerous. Raccoons are nocturnal. They don't snoop around chicken coops and fight with cats in the middle of the day while the sun is bright and shining unless there's something wrong with them. I live in a neighborhood with plenty of children and pets around. I don't think it's safe to just let this animal be. There will always be predators to be concerned about, and I'll always be doing my best to make sure my coop is predator proof, but I have the sinking feeling that this animal is more than just a predator to my chickens. I'm going to trap it and call animal control, because this isn't the kind of place for predators who are actively presenting themselves as dangerous. This isn't the same as hearing a fox calling in the night and knowing there's just a threat to my flock. This animal presented itself in broad daylight, with people around, and got in a fight with my cat. I don't believe taking it somewhere to be someone else's problem is the right thing to do, but I also don't believe I should let it stay alive in this area."

BackYardChickens,38u1qi,wuthaveya,2,Sat Jun 6 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"I've seen people sell coops like that in my area for $600-750. The people that seem to really be making money are the ones that are building custom coops, those are easily going for $1000+ for a similar sized coop."
BackYardChickens,38u1qi,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:08:16 2015 UTC,thanks that's about what i was thinking. did you watch the video? it has some really cool features
BackYardChickens,38u1qi,dontforgetthelube,2,Sat Jun 6 21:46:52 2015 UTC,I think my dad paid like $1000 for the materials for ours. It's pretty solid. About the size of a porta-potty on it's side. Plus an enclose made with chicken wire over wire livestock panels.
BackYardChickens,38u1qi,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"That's a nice coop, but not $1600 nice.  At my workplace (poultry specialty store), we have a range of coops. Some are box coops - the come in a flat box, an at assembled at home. Same coop'n'run design as this one. They house 4-8 chickens depending on size, and are relatively sturdy. They cost $300-$400. We also have two coops who were handcrafted by some Amish folks nearby. These cost $900 and $1500 respectively. They house 10 and 20 chickens respectively. They have no lower ""run"" area and are very solid.  So I say go for a more solid style, basically an attractively crafted miniature barn (wheels are a great plus too).  Necessities:   Roosts: Should be placed at the back of the coop, so they don't get in the way, and if there are multiples (ideal), should be in ascending ladder fashion - the first about 2 feet high, the next 1 foot back and 3 feet high, and so on. They should be made of rounded dowels 1 inch or more thick, if you are in an area with average winters (down to 20 or 30 degrees F. or so), or rather flat 2x4s if the area is any colder. Nest boxes: Should be 4-6 boxes for a coop designed for 10-30 chickens. Boxes built into the wall of the coop with an external lid that opens are a big plus in my book. Be sure to have a latch that holds up the lid while eggs are gathered, and another that keeps it closed so predators can't lift it up. Ventilation: Really, really important. Add as much as you can. Be sure to screen it all with hardware or chicken wire. Size: Most people want a coop for 6-12 chickens. Determine size allotment by using the 4 sq. ft. per standard, 2 sq. ft. per bantam rule.   Hope that helps."

BackYardChickens,38t1iq,Moral_Gutpunch,3,Sat Jun 6 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"My chickens' favorite foods are eggs and chicken. No joke. Chickens are weird and annoying sometimes with the things that they do. I used to lose about 75% of the feed because they were throwing it all around. After getting a proper feeder that didn't allow them to do that, I was surprised by how little I had to go to the feed store.  And yeah different chickens like to eat different stuff. Most of mine hate tomatoes and carrots, but I have a few that go crazy over them. I have one who will only eat eggs, nothing else. Some go CRAZY over pasta! Half of them really enjoy yogurt. None of them like lettuce.  I started blending some left over veggies they didn't like with dry foods they loved, that way they ate the whole thing!"
BackYardChickens,38t1iq,HeadWhack,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"Proper feeder?  Like what? And can I build it?  My chickens will only eat boneless meat (they'll pick every last bit of fried breading off, but don't want to pick meat off). They also love yogurt, but hate how it gets all over their beaks, so I have to mix it with other food."
BackYardChickens,38t1iq,MelonHeadSeb,2,Sat Jun 6 16:57:53 2015 UTC,I used to just keep my feed in half a PVC pipe cut lengthwise and they would constantly knock the feed onto the ground. Then I got one like this and a lot less is being wasted and I also have to refill it a lot less.
BackYardChickens,38t1iq,HeadWhack,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:09:29 2015 UTC,I have that without the 'sail' in the middle.  They throw so much food.
BackYardChickens,38t1iq,MelonHeadSeb,2,Sat Jun 6 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"You can build it yourself or get one online with metal bars (don't know what they're called exactly) that prevent chickens from throwing the feed outside the feeder. I built one using a PVC pipe with a hole cut by length from the top that's just right to make sure that they eat without throwing out outside the feeder. If you don't have the proper tools a carpenter can do the trick. I also connected the pipe to a feed bucket so it automatically refills, just dig around online to find something that suits you to build."

It appears she licks up rather than pecks food. She's a slow though avid eater. The others will eat out of her bottom beak which drives her nuts :/
BackYardChickens,38ol0z,UndefinedHuman,10,Fri Jun 5 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I had a severely crossbeak hen similar to yours and she lived a year before she went to a new home. As far as I know she's still alive. Anyway, as she got older it became more severe and the thing that helped her was a food bucket deep enough for her to immerse her beak in completely. So there's your unsolicited suggestion of the day!"

I'd say you've got a little roo there! Also, I've had a hen crow before and I believe it usually starts a little later in life and in my experience it's much more throaty.

My 12 week Australorp pullets are just now getting to be more than half the size of my fully grown hens. They aren't usually fully grown until around 20-24 weeks, so your little guy is still growing. Bantams are just a smaller class of chicken not a genetic anomaly. Think of them more like a toy breed like we have in dogs!"
BackYardChickens,38repz,ODBeef,2,Sat Jun 6 04:13:20 2015 UTC,"Just to make sure - it's definitely twisted? Not splayed?  If it's just splayed, it's most likely nothing more than Splayed Legs. Use a bandaid to keep the legs in the proper position, until it can walk on it's own.  If it's actually twisted around, it's called Twisted Leg, and it isn't typically correctable. It's almost always the a result of a deficiency of the vitamin Choline, but simple deformity is a possibility too.  The kindest thing to do would be to humanely cull it. Unless you are willing to keep it caged and give it special care for the rest of its life - not necessarily an impossible option, but certainly time consuming."

The most painless way is to cover it up with a towel, hold gently but firmly around the body, grasp the entire head in your hand, and pull outward sharply. You can wear gloves etc. if you want. Chances are the entire head will come off, and there will be a small amount of blood. This may be painful for you, but unless you are willing to spend a lot of time with it, keep it in a separate area from all your other other birds, and give it special care every day for its 10-15 year lifespan, it is the best option."

BackYardChickens,38repz,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat Jun 6 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I understand your predicament completely. The first bird I was ever forced to cull was a cross beak chick. I cared for that bird day and night for the entire week I had her - hourly feedings, a DIY intensive care unit, a little bantam friend bought specifically because he was too small to pick on her... She was my baby. But she went downhill fast at the end of the first week, then clung to life for days. She was suffering, and I wasn't gonna let that happen to her.  Culling is unfortunately a necessity sometimes. I like to give birds a chance, but if their quality of life stops meeting it's requirements, I won't let them go through that any longer."

BackYardChickens,38mdl2,solom1ne,2,Fri Jun 5 04:50:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks like bumble foot - it can get that swollen, black look. :( My mom's chicken's have gotten it before and it's difficult to deal with, but leaving it without treatment can lead to really bad infections. OP, you might want to look up bumble foot and see if the symptoms match with your chicken's. You might need to open it up to drain it and soak it in something like epsom salts, though definitely research it before you attempt anything. Hope it turns out okay!"
BackYardChickens,38mdl2,sockofdoom,2,Fri Jun 5 06:45:06 2015 UTC,"The way it's bent makes it look broken, which would also explain why it's swelled up."

BackYardChickens,38lv23,hectorinwa,2,Fri Jun 5 02:21:54 2015 UTC,Mine too. They're hollering for food by 6. The one polish is particularly vocal. They get let out and fed around 6. Actually about to go do that right now...
BackYardChickens,38lv23,KnifehandHolsters,2,Fri Jun 5 01:56:25 2015 UTC,The hollering for food is exactly why I planned to have a week's supply available to them in a homemade feeder (from pvc elbows and a plastic bucket with a lid). It also reduces food waste and they don't depend on me getting up at the crack of dawn to eat.
BackYardChickens,38lv23,Hanneyh1,2,Fri Jun 5 11:11:38 2015 UTC,I used to do that until the birds and some mice decided to get all mission impossible and clean the feeders out. Then we had a rat dig when I tried to fill the feeder at night so they'd have some for the morning. They scale the side of the coop and go down the chain that hangs it. Giant pain in the ass.

I liked the act of opening the coop up for them in the morning and counting them and closing it in the evening. Did it all last summer and all winter. This summer however, I've been leaving their coop door open and letting them go in and out as and when they please. Their enclosed run is very secure, so predators is not a concern. Now I see the value in the automatic door. Come winter, I'd really like to avoid the early morning trips out to the coop and having to bundle up in the evening to close the coop door. I can see one of these in my near future for sure."

Some can be programmed to open and close at certain times. Some operate by light and darkness. After owning two different ones - both around $200 each- I wish they were a little simpler to program.  That said, I would hate to be without it.  A good place to check is backyardchickens.com and search the forums. There are lots of posts with feedback/reviews. Just make sure they are current. Some doors have changed over time."

BackYardChickens,38omog,chestypocket,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"My ducks rebelled last summer and refused to be penned one night. I was home by myself and not feeling well, so after about half an hour of chasing them, I gave up and told them that if they were killed, it was their own damn fault. They were fine and happy the next morning, but went to bed properly every night thereafter.  Everything was great until one night in September, when my husband and I went out of town and our birdsitter fell through after we'd already left. Since the ducks had already spent a night out and we live in the middle of town in an fenced yard with dogs all around, we figured everyone would be okay for one night. Came home to a massacre. Lost my two favorite chickens and my favorite drake to what I'm sure was a raccoon. My favorite female duck (the drake's mate) had a gigantic gash running from her shoulder to her throat and barely survived with intensive care and injected antibiotics.  I am now of the opinion that it's not worth the risk. Everything will be fine until it's not, but it's painful and traumatic to the flock and heartbreaking for you when the night finally comes that the fox or raccoon or other animal you didn't think lived anywhere near you wanders by and finds the meal of a lifetime. If it doesn't happen right away, don't let your guard down. In the summer, food is abundant for wild predators so you might get lucky (although lots of mamas have babies to feed this time of year), but in the fall and winter food gets scarce, and your ducks will be even more at risk."

BackYardChickens,38hqwg,dirtnapfarmer,2,Fri Jun 5 01:59:56 2015 UTC,Even after they look completely feathered out they can get waterlogged. Best not to give them continuous access to swimable water until you've seen them oil their own feathers for a couple days.

When it tries to walk, the feet don't sit right; they turn in and bend a bit, like if a person tried to walk on the sides of their feet.   Will the chick be able to live at all normally with its feet like this? I don't want to completely give up on it; I've got a rooster with a deformed leg who is positively thriving. If the chick won't be able to grow up happy and healthy, though, I am willing to put it down.

She's now as back to normal as she will ever be, and has totally adapted to her new way of life like she never lost anything at all.

BackYardChickens,38dgxo,Zebba_Odirnapal,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:59:34 2015 UTC,A way to close it up at night would protect your flock against raccoons and possums. They'll dig under that wooden lip in no time flat.  Salatin-style tractors operate under the assumption that you've got multiple tractors per field and that a predator is likely to raid just one tractor. Plus dogs. I believe Joel runs guard dogs on his fields.
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,asheridan_,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:34:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I too have a dog which had done most of the work. But yeah I figured raccoons and such could get under. Bit I'll be securing the door much better.
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,RebelRatel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:07:59 2015 UTC,Foxes at least can (and have) dug under mine in one night and killed a hen 😔 so don't underestimate them. Tractor looks great!!
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,RebelRatel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:04:30 2015 UTC,That's great!   It looks very similar to the tractor I am planning to build. A few questions :  What are the dimensions of the structure? How big is the coop?   What area are you in? Are you concerned about water freezing in the winter?   How many birds are you planning to house?
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,RebelRatel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"It's a 3-1/2 ft x 8 ft structure with the coop being about 3-3/4ft x 3-1/2ft. It houses 3 birds. I'm in the gulf coast area of Houston.  Am I concerned about water freezing, yes I am. Should I be? I don't know."
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,RadocWade,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:56:43 2015 UTC,Thank you.   I am working up a 5' x12' tractor with 5'x 5' in the coop for 6-8 chickens. I asked about the water freezing because I am in PA and that is a dilemma for my area. I am sure you are good on that front.

BackYardChickens,38dgxo,copmaumau,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:45:38 2015 UTC,Do you have trouble moving yours?
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,ghos7man,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:09:52 2015 UTC,Only in high grass areas. I made the weight near the wheels so it was easier to move. I plan to improve the wheels by adding a bolt so that I can leave the wheels higher when needed but can disengage so that the bottom is flush with the ground.
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,clapdog,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:26:04 2015 UTC,Very nice!
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,clapdog,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:12:27 2015 UTC,Looks very nice. I think your real test will be how it performs in the field (literally) though.
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,clapdog,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:42:33 2015 UTC,So far it's been good. I am looking to make a lever system to raise the wheels so it is easier to move in the taller grassy areas.
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,millipixel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"Hi, can you tell me about how much you spent on all of the parts? And how much time it took? Thanks!"
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,rufil-dixon,2,Wed Jun 3 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I'm going to guess around $100. The hardware cloth was fairly expensive compared to the lumber. It took about 2 weekends. If you had specific plans it would go faster, I just threw this together from some basic sketches. And of course compensated for the things I didn't take into account. Lol."
BackYardChickens,38dgxo,wuthaveya,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:43:48 2015 UTC,Can you provide any photos or plans for the watering system? I'm looking at building one myself.
BackYardChickens,38gody,invaderzoom,6,Thu Jun 4 02:16:21 2015 UTC,Some people put panels on the ground around it and apparently that works decently well as most digging predators will give up if they can't dig right up next to the thing they're trying to get into.
BackYardChickens,38gody,cordial_carbonara,2,Thu Jun 4 03:56:16 2015 UTC,Ahhh that looks great!  Good plan!
BackYardChickens,38gody,Grimsterr,3,Thu Jun 4 09:12:13 2015 UTC,"The ground in my yard is HARD I can't imagine a fox getting under in one night.  Also my dog wouldn't allow it.  Turns out that lazy old hound dog who spent the first 7 years of her life in the goat pen is a vicious killer and one of the best hunting dogs I've ever seen, it's too bad I don't hunt and didn't start training her as a pup, she would have been amazing to work with.  If I were worried, I'd probably just put a skirt of chicken wire around the pen so it kinda lays out around it making digging much harder as it just kinda lays on top of the dirt."
BackYardChickens,38gody,olov244,2,Thu Jun 4 05:31:14 2015 UTC,"we have wild cats, birds, raccoons, and I've seen a fox or two in the yard, but so far nothing's tried getting in my tractor. if there's a gap I'll wedge in some bricks or a chunk of wood just in case"
BackYardChickens,38gody,rockherder,2,Thu Jun 4 14:10:25 2015 UTC,I cut my hardware cloth about a foot longer on the bottom bent it to 90 degree and installed it so a foot around the coop is covered.  Then I hold it down with bricks.  We have lots of foxes around here and they have yet to get in.  Lost some in the beginning to coons who climbed into the top but I sealed that up and they have not gotten in since.
BackYardChickens,38ffw1,Mr_Clump,2,Wed Jun 3 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the ideas, I hadn't actually considered they might be dragon eggs; I guess the only way to find out for sure would be to place them in a fire and see if they hatch...  On a more serious note I am actually wondering if we may have an egg eating problem. I just let them out of the coop for the day just a few minutes ago, and in one of the nest boxes I found a load of wet, as if an egg had been broken there; but no sign of an egg.  The bronchitis thing, that's interesting because now that I think of it I could have sworn that I heard one of them sneeze the other day, but then thought nothing more of it.  Also, just found this useful chart on egg shell quality: https://www.alltech.com/sites/default/files/alltech-egg-shell-quality-poster.pdf"
BackYardChickens,38ffw1,MelonHeadSeb,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:00:41 2015 UTC,I've had the wet nesting box before and it was from one of mine laying shell-less eggs that burst in the nest box.
BackYardChickens,38ffw1,VaruStorm,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:08:07 2015 UTC,(I'm looking into backyard chickens for the first time so forgive me if this is dumb) Is this a common problem? Or is this more of a stress related issue?
BackYardChickens,38ffw1,MelonHeadSeb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:53:39 2015 UTC,"I think it probably can be caused by stress, but usually it just means there is a calcium deficiency of some sort if it happens frequently. AFAIK younger hens who have just started laying could do this occasionally but then will start to lay normally, and I believe it is also normal for shell-less eggs to be laid occasionally by fully-grown hens. If it happens all the time though, then there may be a problem."
BackYardChickens,38ffw1,VaruStorm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks a bunch!"
BackYardChickens,38ffw1,poorsoi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"I wish I could offer more help, but my hens have only quit laying when they're either stressed or broody. Stress only slows laying for a couple weeks at the most.  Those are some interesting looking eggs you have there. Have you checked to make sure your chickens aren't actually dragons?"
BackYardChickens,38ffw1,KnifehandHolsters,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:14:50 2015 UTC,Infectious bronchitis can cause wrinkled eggs and a stop in production. It's contagious so they probably all have had it.   I think that may be why one of mine has stopped laying.
BackYardChickens,38eeoi,PlasticOwl,7,Wed Jun 3 17:48:09 2015 UTC,Separate her from the flock in an isolation coop for a week then re-introduce her to the other chickens.  If it fails go for 2 weeks isolation.  Once a new pecking order is established she will have to re-establish her status and the other chickens will likely be fond of their status and not put up with her continued abuses.
BackYardChickens,38eeoi,Grimsterr,5,Wed Jun 3 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"you can try isolating your troublemaker for some days, a bit of solitary confinement can often work.  Otherwise....a batch of meany-hen soup may be in order."
BackYardChickens,38eeoi,Mycd,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:07:53 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.   Also, I've actually gone out & pretended to be the boss chicken sometimes, scolding and batting at the mean one (not hard, just discouraging) when she's pecking the others. This worked after a few days."

BackYardChickens,38cyko,janeyk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"So sad, but good to know. I had a really sick gosling and watching it die was torture. Honestly this may not have worked as she was pretty big. It was so upsetting."
BackYardChickens,38cyko,bad_duck,8,Fri Jun 5 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"Continue to keep it warm, make sure it has access to water. If you have chick electrolites, add them to the water you're giving it -dip its beak in the water if it isn't drinking right away. Dehydration is a big issue. Be sure to check for pasty butt especially if it isn't able to stand properly. If it continues to have weakness in its limbs you may be able to make braces to help it stand and strengthen its legs. Good luck!"
BackYardChickens,38cyko,cordial_carbonara,2,Wed Jun 3 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for replying!  Would it be safe to try and water it with a dropper? I would put it with its siblings in the brooder so that it can drink from their waterer, but it can't really walk and I'm afraid they'll hurt it.   Also, what would you recommend for braces? I've got a ton of popsicle sticks if I can use them."
BackYardChickens,38cyko,Zebba_Odirnapal,5,Wed Jun 3 13:43:24 2015 UTC,"I've never braced legs, but you can use a dropper to encourage water consumption. Mix some water and electrolyte solution and gently hold the dropper to the edge of his beak and squeeze out a single drop. In my experience, all but the sickest chicks reacted by instinctively opening their mouths and swallowing as soon as the water touches their beak, and you can go from there a drop at a time. Remember they are tiny beings and don't need much and at that point every little drop counts!"
BackYardChickens,38cyko,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Wed Jun 3 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for replying!  I don't have electrolytes, but I do have a dropper from where I've fed kittens."
BackYardChickens,38cyko,uliarliarpantsonfire,3,Wed Jun 3 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"Feeding with a dropper can be dangerous if it goes down the wrong pipe. You might try using a very fine catheter to deliver water/electrolytes directly to the crop. I've done it on birds as young as 4 weeks but never a day-old. You'd need a very fine cath and a gentle touch, but it's doable. Just hold the cath tube up next to the bird and make a mark on it with a sharpie so you know how far to go. Hold the bird's beak open by gently pressing on either side at the base of the beak, make sure the neck is extended, and go straight in, staying above the tongue. After tube feeding, bend or pinch the cath before withdrawal to keep the chick from aspirating on any stray drops as the catheter comes out.  Spraddle leg can be treated with vet-wrap or even a couple of carefully tailored bandaids. But if the bird is too weak to stand anyway, bracing the legs may prevent it from developing the strength and coordination it needs.  Good luck again with your little one. I hope he makes a full recovery"
BackYardChickens,38cyko,uliarliarpantsonfire,5,Wed Jun 3 18:23:15 2015 UTC,"If you don't have electrolytes you should pick some up first chance you get since other chicks can benefit from them too. You can use a dropper but try to just wet the tip of it's beak with it not put the dropper all the way in it's mouth since they can drown with a tiny bit. Until you get electrolytes or pedialyte you can give Gatorade or use this homemade recipe. I've not used it but I've seen it recommended before and it should at least help.   Also I just wanted to say for anyone else reading this, the old the hen booted it for a reason is sort of a myth. I've found lots of chicks like this. If mom has 8 under her and one squirms out and falls she may not notice, she might notice and not get off the other 8. If she does get off and go down to attend to it it's not like she's a mama cat and can carry it back up. She may not be able to get the other chicks down to her. She will eventually decide to leave it, return to the large group of chicks she has, and just move on. It happens, they really have the attention span of a gnat. I just usually tuck them back in unless they are in distress in which case I give them some electrolytes, a little feed with the electrolyte water added to it, and heat then pop them back in. I've even found one drowning in a little puddle in the chicken yard and brought her in gave her this treatment for a few days and then popped her under a different mama hen who had fewer chicks to keep up with. She's now one of my most hateful broody hens but she's alive and strong."

BackYardChickens,38ec4z,UsagiYokai,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:02:14 2015 UTC,They make some gauze that sticks to itself but not hair or skin. You can get it at the first aid section in a drugstore. Maybe you could wrap each leg with the gauze and then do a bandaid over that?
BackYardChickens,38ec4z,paisleyterror,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"You can try vet wrap, which you can find at feed stores in the horse section. It sticks only to itself and nothing else."
BackYardChickens,38duoi,cluckingaround,5,Wed Jun 3 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm doing it all wrong, but I keep food and water in their run, but none in the coop. Nothing bad has happened yet. In the mornings when I let them out, they come down and eat and drink, but they don't seem ravenous or super dehydrated or anything.  Just before they go up to bed, they all eat and drink a lot, like they're storing it up for the long sleep."

BackYardChickens,38duoi,Mycd,3,Wed Jun 3 19:35:18 2015 UTC,I am up at 4am everyday but they will eventually have auto coop doors.
BackYardChickens,38duoi,Mycd,2,Wed Jun 3 21:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, sounds like you're setup good then.   Having their food and watewr in the coop is only really necessary while the sun's up."
BackYardChickens,38duoi,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Wed Jun 3 21:51:53 2015 UTC,I will likely go as planned and keep it inside unless I find reason to change.
BackYardChickens,38duoi,manakopi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"If you lock your coop at night, YES they'll need water in there.  A feeder isn't a bad idea too since it will help them learn quickly where their home base is. Even free range chickens need free-choice feed available. You'll just find that they consume less feed versus caged poultry.  My birds sleep in a mesh-sided pavilion sort of coop at a density of ~12 square feet per bird. They have nipple waterers and a hanging feeder in there, plus a big trough of fresh water in their fenced yard. Since there's a fence I prefer to consider it yarded rather than free range. The main thing is: they have fresh water no matter where they happen to be."

It's always hard when something like that happens just as we get attached, and it sounds like he was a really good rooster. The good ones will distract predators while his ladies get away.    I do feel terrible for that poor dog though too. Kept on a chain her whole life, how was she supposed to know any better? At 8 months old she's still a baby! She had a moment of freedom and took advantage by doing what she thought would be fun. Your neighbor is the one to blame, not the dog. I hope she's not euthanized at the shelter he's probably going to dump her at and is able to find a home that actually cares about her. Also, unfortunately people like your neighbor are often serial dog owners, so you might want to keep an eye on that situation even if he does get rid of this one."
BackYardChickens,38bp9y,cordial_carbonara,2,Wed Jun 3 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"I talked to him for about two hours last night and honestly it did seem like he is one of those people who ""must"" have a dog. He was really sympathetic though, I guess he had a jack russell that was attacked by other dogs and had to be put down. I did some research and I found this article about predatory behavior in dogs. I am going to print it out for him and hopefully he trains her like the article says. I would feel a lot better if he trained her properly instead of getting another dog that may or may not repeat the cycle."
BackYardChickens,38bp9y,Jade_Orange,3,Wed Jun 3 16:09:32 2015 UTC,"That's really sad for you, the rooster, and the dog. You seem to be doing a good job with your animals, but the gormless wonder keeping a dog on a constant chain and not training/socializing her ought to be casually tipped into a canal.   Poor dog's going to end up euthanized because people can't be bothered."
BackYardChickens,38bp9y,Jade_Orange,2,Wed Jun 3 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"I really hope she wont be euthanized. I really hope he gets her another home honestly, he sounded like he was going to put her on craigslist. As we are in a big city she probably wont be tempted to chase chickens again. I am just afraid that if she stays here and gets loose again that she will go after my girls first thing. If that happens the city would probably step in because she would be branded a ""vicious dog"". The whole thing makes me really sad, because she seems like a sweet dog but shes discovered her predatory response.   I did a little reasearch and found an article on the ASPCA's website on what they can do because this dog has already started chasing chickens. Unfortunately it does call for them to tie her up securely until she has been trained sufficiently which I doubt this guy is going to do. It seems in the article this kind of training is considered highly advanced so I can see why people wouldn't want to do it. It just makes me so mad that so many people see owning a dog as their right when really it is a huge responsibility. I went through so much prep and read books and blogs about being a responsible chicken owner but they probably just picked her up and got some food and called it good. Its not just them either so many people do that its disgusting! Yet there is no zoning or hoops they need to jump through to have a dog, yet having chickens in the city is highly regulated! Having a rooster crowing is against the law but the dogs bark and are way louder than an occasional crow!   Sorry got a bit ranty there but I have just been getting more and more angry the more I think about it. The guy seemed pretty cool though so I think I will print off this article for him."

In situations like this, the low monetary value of your bird can't make up for what happened, especially what you had to go through putting him out of his misery.

BackYardChickens,389k4p,snuvy,6,Tue Jun 2 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"Looks like a rooster problem, usually solved by getting more hens, removing the rooster, or buying chicken saddles. I'm honestly quite surprised that you're having so much feather loss with that many hens and only 1 roo, but it's possible he's an aggressive and/or clumsy mater. If you don't want to increase/decrease the flock, hen saddles are your best bet.  It's also possibly a picking problem, but it doesn't really look like feather picking to me. You can buy some Pick-No-More lotion and see if it helps, but if it doesn't, it's probably your rooster.  It's probably not mites, but if you want to go ahead and give treatment for all the options just in case, buy some permethrin dust and liberally apply to each bird. Be sure to dust between the legs/on the fluff, on the throat, under the hackles, and under the wings, (and for crested breeds on the crest), and check these areas for mites/mite eggs as well. There is usually evidence of an infestation."
BackYardChickens,389k4p,GallusLafayetti,2,Tue Jun 2 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight.  Would it be possible to remove the Rooster for a few days at a time--or would this mess up their pecking order?  (I don't even think the Rooster is on top...maybe somewhere in the middle, haha--he's a big push over)."
BackYardChickens,389k4p,GallusLafayetti,2,Tue Jun 2 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"That's the standard treatment for feather picking, so as to drop aggressors to the bottom of the pecking order and stop their picking, but I doubt it would work on the rooster, since his actions are not motivated by aggression but rather mating drive, and because roosters are generally on a different pecking order altogether.  Really, the only option is to get rid of the roo, add more hens, or buy saddles. Here and here are some places with good, cheap saddles. Strombergs are very durable and a little bit cheaper, but the material is rather rough and caused a little irritation to a few of my girls' skin. And it's a pretty ugly black and white, which gets looking gross pretty fast. Pampered Poultry makes really high-quality stuff too, with the bonus being that their's have pretty patterns - I haven't had first hand experience with their saddles, but I bought a chicken diaper from them a while back, and it was very well made and very pretty. They are a little more expensive, but not much."
BackYardChickens,389k4p,peeksvillain,5,Tue Jun 2 20:26:04 2015 UTC,Your rooster has a good sex drive.
BackYardChickens,389k4p,grubera,5,Tue Jun 2 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"LOL.  The sad thing is, he was the most passive of all the roosters I had (which were given away at the beginning of this year).  Even now, when he tries to jump on some of the hens, they just fight back and then he runs away.  He's a big softie."
BackYardChickens,389k4p,virgilturtle,6,Tue Jun 2 20:17:28 2015 UTC,"Well, that's why these few hens are overworked, the rest won't let him near them! Maybe if you removed his favourites for a while he'll have more incentive to move up the pecking order."

BackYardChickens,387sag,moosobay,12,Tue Jun 2 13:39:28 2015 UTC,Turkey's aren't a whole lot different than chickens when raising them. Only thing to be wary of is blackhead. Its disease that chickens wont really be affected by but it will be fatal to turkeys so you may have it but you won't know about it until the turkey has it. That being said plenty of people raise them together without issues.   In my experience the turkey's work well with the other birds you just have to either work with them a lot to get them to like you while they are young or keep your distance.   Do you happen to know what breed it is?
BackYardChickens,387sag,Ekleo,5,Tue Jun 2 15:11:25 2015 UTC,A bronze turkey.

BackYardChickens,387sag,Grimsterr,3,Tue Jun 2 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"If you can try and spend a bunch of time with it and it may imprint on you. Although if it imprints on a tiny little bantam chicken that might be funnier. They all have personalities, some are great others not so much. Is it a broad breasted bronze, or just a bronze or  no clue? If it is a broad breasted bronze it will grow bigger and may be too big for your oven come November. Just speaking from experience. Take a look at this for growth rates"
BackYardChickens,387sag,Ekleo,2,Tue Jun 2 16:22:41 2015 UTC,LOL I have no idea! I'll call the feed store and find out right now though. I think it might be hilarious to have a big tom be bff with my little silkie. They would look so goofy walking around the yard together.
BackYardChickens,387sag,Grimsterr,2,Tue Jun 2 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"The boy I talked to couldn't tell me, but the growth chart says that the female is 22 lbs, and the male gets up to 38 lbs. So I'm guessing the wide breasted. They also sell them straight run. I would really like a male, but I don't want two. I think I'll just go with the luck of the draw. Even a 22 lb turkey is a decent size. I just think the bigger, the funnier :)"

BackYardChickens,387sag,big_onion,2,Tue Jun 2 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"Okay well i did some more looking and the broad is bigger, but depending on the hatchery it comes from on how much bigger. Regardless it will be a big bird. As far as a risk of it killing the other birds i guess there is always a risk, but I am fairly doubtful either they will get along or the chickens will be faster most likely. Generally if they've been raised with them there shouldn't be too big of an issue"

BackYardChickens,38aipa,cluckingaround,2,Wed Jun 3 00:15:07 2015 UTC,Easy way would be to use that slide platform as the base for the coop with your best boxes as low as possible.

BackYardChickens,38aipa,englebert,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:24:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's what I was thinking, and make a roof above the slide platform and use the space on top for storing feed/bedding."

BackYardChickens,388il7,jdayl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"For six chickens, you should have a 3 gallon waterer and 12 pound feeder. You'll have to fill the waterer ever 2-3 days and the feeder maybe once a week. Plastic works best, but metal is OK if you can't find plastic. I personally prefer the plastic, the feeder prevents waste better and waterers can last upwards of a decade, whereas metal ones begin to rust after 4-5 years.  All dust bathing areas should go outside. Don't use DE inside your coop; it can be harmful to the bacteria/organisms necessary to break down deep litter.   never more than 6   Good luck with that. No, really. If you find a way to actually keep your flock at or below this number, send word. I started out with 6 and now I have 100. It's like a disease."

BackYardChickens,388il7,snuvy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"I love the Premier 1 Waterer.  It works very well for me.  I like it because you don't have to ""flip it upside down"" to fill and then screw in the base.  All you have to do is open the lid and fill it up (they have a 3 gallon and 5 gallon version).  I put it on top of two cinder blocks.  I also use the Premier 1 Feeder.  You may want to use a smaller one than this if you only have a few chickens.  I like this as well, the grill helps keep the food in place and it's easy to fill through the top.  I place this on cinder blocks as well.  FYI. I recommend using chicken feed pellets.  I find it the least wasteful, because it's big enough pieces that even if it falls on the ground, the chickens will eat it.  The mash is the worst, because it scatters everywhere and then they won't eat it (and sometimes they try to dig it out for specific pieces of stuff).  The crumbles is a good starting point for chicks before moving onto laying pellets.  With this set up, I have to refill water/feed every other day.  Hope this helps.

They're not in an organized breed though, as you'll find varieties of Baladis across the Middle East. They all lay small eggs that are flavorful though, and you can have a colorful flock all of the same breed. I currently have a hen that's entirely black to the comb, she's like the Arabic version of the Ayam Cemani lol, and I have a rooster who is very colorful and looks like he's been colored black, white, brown, gray, and copper in color pencils.

BackYardChickens,386e7d,GallusLafayetti,2,Tue Jun 2 06:33:25 2015 UTC,"What do you want them for? Eggs or meat?  Egyptian Fayoumi would make a good free range bird. I've had 3 or 4, they were were quick and flighty, and good layers, although the eggs are on the small side. In the same vein, Hamburgs might be a good choice. But neither would make a good meat bird.  I haven't raised Bresse, but I've done quite a bit of research into them, since I have the appropriate areas to raise them in the proper French tradition. They seem somewhat hardy, but because they're a meat breed, I imagine they would be quite heavy and therefore susceptible to predators. I imagine they'd be more suited to being pastured, presumably in a very large fenced area. They're also supposedly adequate layers, but not fantastic. Just adequate. Not to mention that they are quite rare, and quite expensive.  My suggestion is to get several breeds, and either natural selection will tell you which ones survive best, or you can crossbreed. Get a few flighty breeds (Leghorns, Hamburgs, Fayoumi) and a few heavy (Bresse, or more commonly, Red Rangers or Standard Cornish). See which ones do best, and which you like best."

His skin is red right now because his feathers are starting to grow back. It's not ""shitty care""--if that were the case, it wouldn't be just him. He's perfectly healthy otherwise. He lost his feathers because he likes to start fights. Yes, odd for a cochin, but he is the aggressor, and he targets only one or two go after time and time again. He's the lowest rung and, like a chihuahua, he has more ego than he knows what to do with. Liberace is well over a year old, as are most of the roos in there with him, and at least 1/3 of the ladies. They don't fight anymore, unless someone new joins the ranks (and those are usually sold off) or he instigates something. Yes, I do know what I'm talking about because we have sat out there for a very long time, repeatedly, watching to see what was going on when we noticed his leg feathers were disappearing.

This allows them to move away if it's too hot, and keeps the water cool and clean."
BackYardChickens,386geh,GallusLafayetti,2,Tue Jun 2 18:37:51 2015 UTC,As long as the chicks have the ability to move away from or closer to the heat lamp they will regulate their temps themselves.
BackYardChickens,386geh,MrBungles,2,Tue Jun 2 16:01:10 2015 UTC,"I use a 125w heat lamp bulb, and set the bulb about 15 inches above the bedding. If it's cold out, this works. If it's warm out, move it further up. I don't have any science to it, I just hold my hand where they'll sit and if it feels cozy but not scorching I leave it. If after I put them in, about 10 minutes later if they're huddled right under the lamp I might lower it. Just watch them and see how they react.  Can't say anything about the bedding, I always use straw."
BackYardChickens,386geh,OtisB,2,Tue Jun 2 16:14:54 2015 UTC,"Like you, I spent a lot of time obsessing over getting the 95* suggested temperature. I had a digital thermometer in there that was logging their temperature, but, like you, got wild variations on if I put it on the ground, at chick head level, above the chicks, etc. And then after a week I obsessed over how to get a tiny 5* change when moving an inch produced that in my thermometer! In the end I think we moved the lamp to only 3-4 positions between first day and the move outside.  Turns out the best thermometer is the chicks themselves. Their behaviour will tell you all you need to know. Just so long as you have a place for them to escape to, and they have plenty of water, they'll be fine. The temperature recommendations are more of a ballpark figure for setting up the heat lamp, the chicks will find a comfortable place along the temperature gradient, so long as there is a spot that is warm or cool enough.   I'm not sure how your mom killed a chick with a heating pad, but it's likely the chick might have died for other reasons & the heating pad only contributed -- if it didn't know better or have enough energy to move away from the heat, it was probably already sick. Chicks can be quite fragile and death comes quick if they lose strength."
BackYardChickens,386geh,shoutpy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:28:06 2015 UTC,Thank you all for your advice! We will watch the chicks closely and I moved the heat lamp down a bit and off to the side. We pick up the chicks tomorrow!
BackYardChickens,384ey1,pitapocket93,9,Mon Jun 1 19:51:15 2015 UTC,"Just keep feeding them, they'll know who feeds them soon enough.  Especially in the morning, when they're good and hungry, spread the food around you and then just stand there still and kinda force them to come near you to eat.  I'm doing this with a shy goat right now, I stand there and she either lets me rub her head some while she eats or she has to sit there, watching the other two much friendlier goats eat for a few minutes before I leave.  She's gotten MUCH less shy in the last few weeks, not a puppy dog yet, but enough so I think I'll be able to milk her when she (hopefully) gets bred for her first time in December."
BackYardChickens,384ey1,Grimsterr,5,Mon Jun 1 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"I like training them to come when I call- it's been helpful a few times when they got out of the yard.

My daughter and I handled them regularly.  For 4 weeks I raised them in a tote box in our 2nd floor hallway before moving them to the henhouse.  They're now 14 weeks old and runs away at the first sight of me.  There was no bonding.  From the very beginning (after first few days) they did not enjoy being handled.  My ducklings on the other hand are much better.  They don't like being touched but will eat from my hands.  I wouldn't call that bonding though.

I don't know about all chickens but mine like to be stroked under their beak and chin! Spread food out close to your feet so they get comfortable eating near you and eventually they'll come eat their favourite treat straight out of your hand. I think I sped this up by first feeding them by hand through the wire of their run, so they felt safe. Good luck!"

I see that they may well be embryos, which is still a yuck factor for me. I'm mighty squeamish that way ><   My specific eggs remain a mystery. One of them did have a pink line extending through the egg white, but I didn't have a picture of that. It was the first one I peeled and tossed away. Once shelled, I could see a pink spot on the white, so I cut through it there. The discoloration seemed to extend in a thin, wavy line from the edge to the yolk, which had a ring like the others. That still could be an embryo I suppose!  I've emailed my friends just so they can look at it and make an assessment. They're fantastic chicken keepers, so I'm confident they'll know what to do. I wanted to ask here first because I thought it might just be a normal change of seasons or feed-related thing I'm not familiar with, and I didn't want to seem silly. They also grow amazing organic produce, but there are people who complain about finding a bit of dirt or a live bug among greens that they literally pick and give to you still warm from the field.

BackYardChickens,383cf2,lgfromks,11,Mon Jun 1 15:41:34 2015 UTC,"I got a pair last year.  They have exactly one pro:  They are absolutely gorgeous. To see them out in the yard is fantastic, because they really are stunning.  That's it. That's the only reason why anyone would ever want to deal with them.  So, if you have lots of space (they get upset when confined unless it's a very large area), don't park your cars ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR COOP, don't mind noise like a very large, very angry cat who has just been run over by a train (sometimes well into the wee hours of the morning), don't care about their egg-laying ability, and have a high tolerance for them being little shits, then yes, absolutely get them.  My female isn't so bad. She's only noisy when she honks (sounds like a car horn, they occasionally do it if something exciting happens), she usually isn't following me around and getting aggressive if I go into ""her territory"", although she does like to fly out of the pen a lot. But despite the lack of drawbacks, she really isn't that pretty (pure white, no tail, just generally ""eh""), so there goes the only pro.  The boys take 3 years to mature and grow their train. If raised with chickens, they are usually pretty OK with them, except during breeding season, when they'll bite out at small things that walk past. I keep mine on the same feed as my chickens, although I believe that they should ideally have a higher protein % during breeding season.  They are absolute brats. 3/4 of the year, they want nothing to do with you, unless you have spent a good long time socializing them. Even then, I have no idea how docile they act - like I said, mine don't want anything to do with me, and when we got them, the previous owner described them as ""very friendly, for peas"".  During the breeding season, males become incredibly obnoxious - mine has taken over the lower part of my large, L-shaped run, and if I go in there he stands in my way, refusing to let me to past, and jumps in the air and screams if I try to move him. When he isn't being freaking Gandalf, he's following me around, playing like he's gonna come after me. He hasn't actually tried to thump me yet, but I've had enough roos do it that I keep my eye on him any time I'm down in low part of the run. At night, he flies onto a shed just outside the run, and about once an hour, spends  5 minutes screaming like a dying cat. He does this during the day too, but more frequently.  They haven't found our cars yet, but I've heard horror stories about how they just LOVE to roost on cars. Do you know how sharp their nails are? I have a scar on my palm from when I first got my pair (nearly 10 months ago) and didn't know how to handle them yet. So, if you have a nice car, invest in a cover.  Also. Handling them is very, very difficult. They are very clever, always devising ways to get their legs out of your grasp and scratch the living shit out of you. And getting hit by a wing is kinda like being punched in the face (well, not exactly like - OK, fine, I've never actually been punched in the face, but what I'm saying is, it hurts a lot, OK?)  So. If you are willing to deal with all of this, in the interest of keeping these brats (because really, they are very beautiful), then by all means go ahead. I love my pair, even when I hate them. But that's because I have a lot of space (which they need), and the coop and run is FAR FAR FAR away from the house, so I can only faintly hear them screaming into the dark every single night, and because I am able to deal with them taking over my coop and deciding ""IT IS MINE, NO, FOOD KEEPER, YOU CAN'T ENTER, I SAID IT'S MINE! NOW I'LL HONK AT YOU TO GET THE POINT ACROSS!""  They're rewarding to watch, if you can get past all the brattiness, but they really aren't for everyone."

The hen is around 7 and the male is 4(ish?). We got them last September. Sounds old, but they can actually live 40-50 years in captivity, so they're actually pretty much just teenagers."

I mean, I'm out in California, so technically this shouldn't affect me, but ever since this January when a new egg law went into effect (bumping prices to $5/dozen), it's already been cheaper to raise your own. And I'm absolutely sure that they'll find a reason to raise the prices over here, as well. I now work at a poultry specialty store, and oh boy, while I wasn't working there at the beginning of the year, when everyone was really going crazy, my coworkers have told me stories of how some days, when a new batch of pullets came in, they were giving out 30 NUMBERS to people an hour before they were even open. Since I've been working there, the biggest rush I've seen has been 15 numbers on a single morning, with 1 person already there when I arrived at 8:30 (we opened at 10 that day)."

BackYardChickens,382mp5,Stagnant_Life,3,Mon Jun 1 20:23:15 2015 UTC,"It actually was voted into law about 3 years ago, but they had to give the industry time to adjust before it actually went into effect; basically, they required all hens to have at least 2 sq. ft. per bird in their housing (whether caged or free in houses). Since they were mostly at like 1 sq. ft. or less per bird before, you can imagine they had to enlarge their housing units drastically, which I'd bet cost quite a bit of money. It is a good thing for the hens though - even though 2 sq. ft. per bird is well below the recommended minimum of 10 sq. ft. per bird when confined, it's definitely an improvement.  I'm not kidding, it's really around $5/dozen. That may be for organic though - conventional are around $3.75 or $4, I think. I really do expect it to go up later this year too, when the effects of the A.I. outbreak really really begin to hit the market.  In CA, at least, it's a very good time to be in the chicken business. Our pullets sell like crazy, since we're the only local place that sells 8 week olds. And we often run out of the most popular types of feed before our next order comes in; and mind that each order is 15 tons - lotta chicken feed. It's pretty crazy. I don't know the exact $$ amounts being brought in, but I know it's a lot. My boss has even been talking about moving to a larger place soon, because we don't have enough room in our little store anymore."

BackYardChickens,380uhf,cordial_carbonara,2,Mon Jun 1 13:35:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have a home made coop to show off (my woodwork skills are totally nonexistent...). With regard to your other question - you can get sex-linked chicks if you want the fun of getting them a bit younger. These are chicks which can be told apart by the colour of their down from day-old.  I've had Maran RIR (crossbreed) sex link chicks before with complete success, this time I've got Welsummers and a Cambridge Cream Legbar (she should lay blue eggs when she's a bit older!).  In terms of what to do with males - it's up to you to some extent. Many people can't keep out of consideration to their neighbours, since roosters are loud. If you do decide to keep roos, bear in mind that they may fight each other if there is more than one. If you don't decide to keep any male birds, you can choose to cull them, or attempt to re-home them. If re-homing is not practical and you don't want to cull them yourself (don't think I could...), some breeders will do this for you if you return the bird to them."

BackYardChickens,380uhf,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"The general rule of thumb is 3-4 sq ft of coop space and 10 sq ft of outside run area per chicken, minimum. About a foot of roost space per chicken is also good. I also see a nesting box per 3-4 hens, but honestly all 6 of my current layers use the same box, it's ridiculous lol. I highly suggest going as far above that minimum as you can for a couple reasons. Your chickens will be more comfortable and happier, and also chickens are addictive! You can never have enough, and trust me, adding on is a pain! Also, even if you plan on free ranging, a decent fenced in run is a good idea for those times when you can't be home, so your chickens can safely get out of the coop.    I don't have any great pictures of my coop (I really need to get around to that!), but there are tons of plans available online and it's a simple enough build, especially if you already have the tools. You can spend as much or as little as you want, really.    You could go with juvenile or adult birds if you want, but you don't have to. There are several types of sex-link birds that can easily be identified upon hatching by their color. Also, many hatcheries sex their birds for you via different methods depending on the breed and offer something like a 90% success rate. The problem there would be most hatcheries require a minimum order around 15 birds. My Pet Chicken offers smaller shipments and sexed birds, but I've never used them so I can't say much except that I've heard good things. If you do accidentally get a cockerel, you basically have the choice to keep, rehome, or eat. Caponizing is also a thing, but I'm kind of iffy about how humane it is and have no experience with it. I will say, though, I have purchased 52 chicks total from hatcheries in the last two years and only 2 have been incorrectly sexed, so the odds are pretty good you won't have to deal with it!"

In the United Kingdom, birds sold as capons are chemically or physically castrated roosters (cocks in UK).

BackYardChickens,380uhf,SuramKale,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"I never really thought of making a run, my chickens will be pretty much free range in my backyard, but maybe I will end up making a smaller run just in case. Thanks for all the advise!"
BackYardChickens,380uhf,cordial_carbonara,2,Mon Jun 1 13:32:20 2015 UTC,Having a run of some sort is definitely a must. It enables you to be gone (either for the day or vacation) and not worry about predators or escaped chickens.
BackYardChickens,381ehi,candlesandfish,3,Mon Jun 1 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"None of those breeds should cease laying this early. In fact, most common breeds should lay well into 4, 5, 6 years of age, and even up to 10 years old they ought to be laying at least 1 egg per week.  There are five reasons chickens stop laying: stress, disease, molting, brooding, or sometimes, malnutrition. They don't sound stressed, and if you don't see any other signs of sickness, chances are it's not disease. You didn't mention any brooding right now, and if you're feeding a 16% layer pellet or crumble, they shouldn't typically have any nutrition issues. But the fact that they didn't return to laying after molting makes me thing it has something to do with that. My suggestion is to switch to a feed with higher protein content - 18% should suffice. You should also add oyster shell and a vitamin supplement to their diet to encourage laying. Putting a light (not a heat lamp, just a light) in their coop will make them sense a longer light cycle and hopefully also help to kickstart their cycles again. If they still don't lay after that, you may want to see an exotic/avian vet regarding the matter."
BackYardChickens,381ehi,GallusLafayetti,0,Mon Jun 1 04:39:22 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll definitely try that. I hadn't thought of it being related to their moulting.
BackYardChickens,381ehi,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:58:21 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Pretty much all birds stop laying for a few weeks during and after molting, buts it's unusual for them to stop for any longer. I figure the molting may have triggered their bodies to notice something, i.e. a nutrient they aren't getting enough of, so hopefully with an extra dose of light, protien, and vitamins, they'll go back to their usual cycles."

BackYardChickens,37ziyj,heathenyak,2,Sun May 31 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Same, when it happens for me, its usually first year hens."
BackYardChickens,37ziyj,wezzz,3,Sun May 31 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"A chicken's egg cycle is every 25-26 hours. Rarely, this time period can be lesser. The world record for egg laying is an Australorp hen who laid 367 eggs in 365 days. So 2 days that year, she laid twice. Mind that this is the world record; this hen was a very, very special hen, and I'm surprised that she had no health effects from this ability.  While many people claim to have hens who will lay more than once a day, what's almost always happening is they have a hen with an odd laying cycle; laying after dark, laying very very early, etc. Or they are simply missing the eggs the first time gathering."
BackYardChickens,37ziyj,GallusLafayetti,2,Sun May 31 19:05:05 2015 UTC,Chickens can lay twice a day everyday if you screw with the light cycles. So I'm sure it's possible. Happened to me a few times.
BackYardChickens,37ziyj,SiberianShibe,2,Sun May 31 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain my red sex link gave me two eggs in a day 2-3 times in before a dog got her. It was always a little disconcerting to go out an find another egg in the afternoon when you had just collected one that morning.

My half-blind hen who rarely lays eggs anymore was living inside the house this winter and she popped out two eggs in the space of an hour and a half. Granted, I'm not there to witness every egg being laid and perhaps another bird of mine has performed the same feat but, even so, I think it's probably pretty uncommon."

BackYardChickens,37wqly,Grimsterr,2,Sun May 31 01:11:37 2015 UTC,"Story time: I've wanted ""chocolate egg layers"" for a long time, and finally last year around May I drove 2 hours to buy four four week old French Black Copper Marans ""pullets"".  Well I ended up with 1 hen, 2 roosters, and 1 black game hen that lays green eggs (da fuck?).  They matured and I started getting eggs this spring, and hatching eggs from the single hen I have, and my first 7 chicks ended up with 2 yellow chicks hatching (da fuck?).  So after asking some Marans gurus it was determined my FBCM are mixed, badly, with probably a game chicken of some sort.  When I bought the 4 chicks they looked identical.  So I got pissed, and asked ""what lays the darkest eggs, and who has the best flock of those particular Marans I can possibly find?""  The answer was Wheaten Marans and Bev Davis.   Well Bev isn't selling any eggs right now but she gave me the name of another breeder who was (luckily) selling eggs and her Marans were straight from Bev herself.  So $75 later I have 31 eggs in my possession, I put 24 in my hovabator and 7 into my brinsea (those are not yet ready to hatch).  So far I have 11 chicks and 1 more about to pop out of the egg.  By god if someone says THESE Marans are mixed mutts I'm gonna go midevil on someone's ass."

Sometimes it's just weakness and can be righted by loosely tying the legs together which forces them to stand. After a week or so you wouldn't know which one it was.

Splayed leg is fixed by using a bandaid to hold the feet in their proper position (does not always work).  Slipped tendon or twisted leg only affects one leg. The leg is splayed outwards, and twisted in the case of twisted leg. Treatment for slipped tendon only works if it is implemented within a few days, and is to gently stretch the leg out and push the tendon back into place. I don't believe there is any treatment for twisted leg."

BackYardChickens,37t2ol,ithinkimightbegay,13,Sat May 30 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Gamefowl roosters are often very friendly towards people, especially those who actually spent time being trained under a cocker. They spend many, many hours being trained, exercised, put on treadmills, having equipment attached and detached from their bodies, and being fetched from to and from the ring during fights to have ointments and narcotics rubbed into wounds, be medicated, be agitated so they're willing to continue to fight even if they're half-dead, etc... despite all that he's gone through, he's very used to human contact, and he's a very sweet boy to me.  He is, however, very dangerous to other roosters - he'll continue to fight until the other rooster is dead or he's killed. While some gamefowl breeds can be kept with other cocks, under the correct circumstances, he is simply not compatible at all. But he is very good with hens, who he can be kept with without issue."
BackYardChickens,37t2ol,CochinBrahmaLover,7,Sat May 30 06:00:19 2015 UTC,"I had a gamefowl dude.. Loved him. Wasn't an ex fighting roo, but one time we had a rescue of several chickens, including 7 roosters. Didn't have any place to put them separate, and the hens all got along. We were new and stupid. Put the rooster in there. He was half dead but kept wanting to fight.   Also, TIL how they train fighting cocks. Haven't read up much in it tbh.  Edit: do you know if he was dubbed, or bred with a small comb? Hard to see in this photo."
BackYardChickens,37t2ol,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Sat May 30 06:03:07 2015 UTC,"Gamefowl are such lovely birds. Most of the games I keep are oriental, which are much taller and more muscular than long, low-to-the-ground American types like he is, but after the first day with him I already want to get more! I'd love to have a little flock of gamehens for him.  The training methods vary by cocker, but they usually involve things like treadmills, attaching weights to the birds' limbs - some cockers even believe that beating the neck and legs will make the muscles tougher and stronger. They also sometimes drug them with amphetamines, narcotics, etc., to make them more agitated during fights. It's honestly a real surprise he ever survived the pit; most birds don't, since slashers/gaffs can kill with a single hit if the angle is right.  I believe he was dubbed, there's some tissue that looks like it's scarred on the comb/wattle, and it really doesn't look like any kind of pea comb/other small comb I've ever seen - more like a typical wide single with the whole top sheared off."
BackYardChickens,37t2ol,CochinBrahmaLover,3,Sat May 30 06:08:10 2015 UTC,"I really love the look of the thin ones. Like modern game fowl. Old english are a favorite of mine too.

My main focus is still on orientals, but I'm looking for a breed to keep for show instead of just pets, so I may go with Americans or Old English instead... easier to transport and show for sure, and plenty of varieties to choose from.  Cockfighting is a real shame, for sure. I have a very grudging respect for the first cockers all those centuries ago, since it's how chickens were first domesticated and how all these lovely, spirited game breeds were developed, and because back then, that kind of bloodsport was considered ""OK""; but you would think that by now people would have figured out that with all these humane and proper uses for birds, there's no reason at all to go on fighting them, tradition or not.  Yes, the dubbing is a shame. While I can see the logic of it in fighting - reducing pain and bleeding, while keeping the genetic factor of big combs (can indicate better laying ability which results in easier breeding) - what really gets to me is that it has carried over into show fowl. Standards for birds like OEGs and American Games require the birds to be dubbed for showing, which seems so unnecessary. I was just talking with my friend today about how the only legitimate reason for dubbing is to aid in the prevention or treatment of frostbite, since it's the only time that it actually benefits that bird, rather than the owner."

Also, I just found this bit of information about still air incubators. ""It is very easy to overheat the eggs in still-air incubators and difficult to maintain proper humidity. During the warm-up period, the temperature should be adjusted to hold a constant 101°F for still air, 99°- 100°F for forced air."" So, it sounds like you need to bump your temperature up to 101 degrees OR purchase a fan kit to turn your still air incubator into a forced/circulated air incubator (which I highly recommend as a fan will eliminate hot/cold spots inside of the incubator and allow for a uniform temperature)."

Marans should lay dark eggs; although Black Copper do lay a darker egg than othe varieties, even Cuckoos eggs are noticeably darker than most chickens. Even the hatchery Marans I've gotten have laid a decently dark egg. It's possible they aren't true Marans (although the way you described them sounds pretty accurate) or they came from very poor or crossbred stock."

Her flock looked nice, never saw the eggs though, so I guess that was a mistake on my part. Either way, eggs are eggs and the hens lay pretty great although 2 are currently broody. One day I'll get my dark eggs though."

BackYardChickens,37vsvk,poorsoi,1 point,Sat May 30 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"This website describes how no owner of livestock or poultry is allowed to let them roam streets, sidewalks, or neighboring properties. So it's not a definitive yes, but as far as I can tell it's not saying you can't have fowl, it just says you can't let them run free.  I'll see if I can find more legal codes on it.  EDIT: I found the actual code regarding the keeping of animals here. As far as I can tell, you must obtain a permit from the board of health, who will conduct a public hearing to determine issuance; you can't have more than 20 birds; and you can't have a rooster unless the permit specifically allows it. There also several other sanction requirements, which are actually rather lenient.  EDIT II: I may have the incorrect link, these may be the requirements for Bedford, not New Bedford."

BackYardChickens,37t2mj,nachoqueen,3,Sat May 30 04:06:50 2015 UTC,"Ideally, chickens should have 4 sq. ft./bird coop space, but since this is a rescue, the area sounds OK for now. A large cardboard box or dog crate with an old towel in it would be better, if you can get them moved soon.  You can tell if they're roosters or hens by their feathers. Roosters have long, pointed saddle and hackle feathers and large red wattles/combs. Hens have smaller wattles/combs, and their saddle feathers are short and round. Roosters will also crow, make ""coo, coo, cook"" noises, and grow sharp Spurs on their legs. However, if they are under 12 weeks of age, they will not yet have these characteristics. Post pictures when you can, and I'll be able to tell you more about breed/gender/age."

I will move them out of the can first thing tomorrow a.m. I'm just worried about overnight at this point.  I can't imagine somebody just dumping them like that. We have feral cats and sometimes other predators at the park. I guess folks know we'll do our best to keep them safe.   Thank you for your prompt response.

BackYardChickens,37t2mj,GallusLafayetti,3,Sat May 30 04:23:31 2015 UTC,"That's fine. Chances are they're roosters or very old hens; I can't think of any reason someone would want to dump a good laying hen. Then again, I can't imagine dumping a bird at all - it's shameful and wrong and ought to carry a hefty fine from the law. Do you know where you are going to rehome them? How much do you know about chickens?  You can try to feed them treats in the meantime, such as lettuce, stale bread, or other grains/cereal. Treats always help birds feel better. If you haven't offered them water yet, you should do so at the soonest possible time."
BackYardChickens,37t2mj,GallusLafayetti,2,Sat May 30 04:29:40 2015 UTC,"I put cracked corn in the can with them...had already offered them bread pieces, but they may have been distracted by noises from the 200+ ducks, geese and other birds in the park.

BackYardChickens,37scp0,johnnyssmokestack,7,Sat May 30 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"My favorite part about keeping chickens is roosters. I used to only keep hens, until I moved to a more rural area. I have maybe 15-20 boys now, and a separate pen just for them. They're beautiful, sweet (at least the good ones are), and tend to have more personality than hens - just today I adopted an ex-fighting cock who was in need of a home, and I can already tell that when he grows his tail feathers back in, he's going to be nothing short of magnificent.  A lot of people who have problems with their roosters (hens losing feathers, aggression, stress) either have the wrong rooster, or too many roosters. A good rooster will protect his ladies, alarm call when he sees a predator, dance and ""coo-coo-coo"" for them before mounting, and share all the food he finds with them. Now, good roosters aren't difficult to find per say, but not all roosters grow up to be good roosters. Some can turn out to be very aggressive, very bratty birds.  Roosters almost never pick on hens, they typically only pick on roosters - roosters and hens have a completely different pecking order. However, a rooster who mates aggressively can result in hens loosing feathers on their back, wings, and head due to roos' claws/spurs/beaks. This can also be caused by having a rooster-hen ratio with too many roosters. The rule of thumb is 1:8 roosters to hens, so you actually have an ideal set up to bring a cockerel into your flock.  I suggest you wait until your hens are fully grown (~6 months) and then bring in an adult rooster. By 6 mo. aggressive cocks are beginning to show their bad traits, while friendly roos are beginning to coo and dance for hens, so it's easier to tell how a roo is going to act before you buy/adopt him.  There is no ""one breed"" to get to guarantee a good rooster. I've met vicious Silkies and I've met RIRs who were sweet as apple pie, so it varies quite a bit. Polish can make fine flock roosters, but for a free-ranging situation I would probably consider them a poor choice, due to their reduced field of vision. For protection, roosters such as Orpingtons, Australorps, Brahmas, and other large breeds are ideal. Gamefowl are especially quite good - they're usually friendly with people, and I've heard stories of Oriental Gamefowl roosters attacking and injuring/killing hawks who were attempting to carry off their hens."

BackYardChickens,37scp0,voldemortoutbitches,3,Sat May 30 11:41:04 2015 UTC,"Just raised 2 cockerels along with 8 pullets and as much as I loved my sweet boys, they were still total pains in the butts. They were only 9 weeks old but pulled feathers out of the girls, bit them, bit me, fought each other and one crowed nonstop. However, they did protect the pullets and tried to keep them safe. Ended up giving them both away to a new home 2 days ago. I'll miss them but my pullets and neighbors will be happier for it, and I think they will be happier on a nice big farm with lots of hens and other roosters."
BackYardChickens,37scp0,NikaNuss,3,Sat May 30 02:59:39 2015 UTC,"Only do it if you want to have your hens have chicks. Roosters can be awesome, but they can also be very mean, so you need a better reason than protection to get one.  When I was a little girl my mom's rooster latched onto my pants with his feet and pecked so hard I was bleeding through my jeans. On the flipside, her current rooster is a darling and he basically acts like a herding dog - whenever he thinks his girls are getting too far away, he runs over and brings them back into the zone he's guarding. So they can be great, but unless you want more than just protection it's unlikely to be worth it."

One of the roosters is ENORMOUS and very aggressive towards us; he has kicked holes in our shins many times with his 2"" long sharp spurs.  I refer to him as Mr. Bad Ass.  If you ask me, if you are raising chickens for eggs, there is simply no reason at all to keep a rooster.  I live next to a woodsy swamp and we do occasionally lose a chicken to hawk/owl/fox whatever, but in my experience the roosters can't really protect them from that other than raising alarm (the last one we lost to a predator was a rooster)."

BackYardChickens,37q0gm,Dirty_Hort,2,Fri May 29 14:15:25 2015 UTC,"Impacted crop will be hard; it's impacted, meaning that there is little to no room for the food to move around; sour crop is also a possibility, crops will be squishy in that case, and she would have very bad breath. It's possible it seemed painful simply because she didn't want you to touch her crop; I would imagine the sensation of having your crop squished or touched could be unpleasant for some birds.  Treatment for impacted crop is to give her some olive oil and withdraw feed for 24 hours or until the crop empties. Treatment for sour crop varies, but usually includes withdrawing food, sometimes water, and feeding small amounts of yogurt. I highly suggest you buy a copy of Gail Damerow's The Chicken Health Handbook for future use, it is an invaluable reference source whenever a bird is acting sick or off.  Do you by chance still have her remains on hand? I understand this may be difficult for those who keep their flock as pets, or who are squeamish, but it would really be ideal if you could perform an autopsy. If it was not impacted/sour crop, it could be something else environmental, contagious, etc. If you really are adverse to doing it, see if you can get the number of a local veterinary institution or teaching institution, or similar - for example I'm out in C.A. and I've called UC Davis in the past regarding this. They will sometimes do free necropsies on small animals like chickens, and send you a report afterwards. If you do find someone willing to take the carcass, bag her and put her in your fridge in the meantime, not freezer, as freezing can destroy some of the things they need to study.  In the meantime, watch the rest of your flock carefully, on the off chance it was something contagious."

If you find anything hugely abnormal in the autopsy, or if the other birds began to display symptoms, definitely contact an avian or exotic veterinarian near you, since early detection and treatment are critical in acute or contagious diseases.

BackYardChickens,37opoz,darrenpauli,2,Fri May 29 05:05:16 2015 UTC,"Hi folks,  My elderly landlord dropped off her old friend's three chickens which she says she can't care for. I've added them to my young flock of three.  The new chickens are in a bad way and I haven't yet as a new keeper had experience with clipping nails and beaks.  The landlord says they are laying, but there's a bit of dementia going on there so I don't know.  So I would very much love your help.  The Isa Brown in these pictures has a badly overgrown beak, plus a large belly, which I checked on forums looks to be an internal egg. They say they can live for years, but I'm not sure.  1) Can or should I trim her beak? Should I put her down? How would I do either? I'm a squeamish bloody vego, so an axe really isn't going to be something I think I can wield TBH.  2) There is a white chook here. What is it and is it a hen? I would assume the old lady didn't keep a roo with her hens.  3) The white chicken and the second Isa Brown not pictured have long nails. Where should I cut them and do I need to be particularly careful given the length of the nail?  A last note: I am away for next week so I would love to sort this out over the weekend (I'm in Australia BTW) so my wife doesn't have to worry.  Thanks guys,  d"
BackYardChickens,37opoz,NauticalxDisaster,7,Fri May 29 05:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly no expert as my chickens seem to manage their nails on their own digging around and suck but it is my understanding that you trim them just like you would a dogs.  You can use dog clippers and just be careful not to cut all the way to the quick (the whitish colored bit you can sometimes see through the nail.  If you're worried about cutting too much at once you can do a little bit at a time until you've worked them down to a manageable size.  Basically cut a little, give it a few days, cut a little more.  The quick will shrink back.  If you do happen to cut through the quick its not a huge deal (like with a dog) but it can be a bit painful and will bleed.    I'm not sure about beaks.... but I did want to mention that you might want to be careful putting these chickens in with your own birds right away.  since they weren't cared for properly they may have some yucky stuff they can pass on to your healthy birds.  Lastly, I wanted to thank you for being a good person.  Many people wouldn't have taken these birds and I think its wonderful that you have and are trying to help make their life better."

BackYardChickens,37opoz,ChIck3n115,5,Fri May 29 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"NauticalxDisaster got the toenails pretty much covered, so I won't go in to that.  They should be fine if you accidentally hit the quick (it will bleed a lot, but chickens clot REALLY fast), but you can apply some antiseptic/neosporin to prevent infection if you like.  As said above, biosecurity is a must when introducing new birds.  Isolate these birds from your flock for a while to test for diseases.  You might put a ""test bird"" in with them for a bit to see if they are asymptomatic carriers (the test bird would obviously be at higher risk though).  If they have already been together for a while it's probably too late, just watch your birds for any signs of illness.  There are a ton of poultry diseases, but most of them will pass on their own.  The bird with the deformed beak looks to be in pretty bad condition, but if she is eating well enough you can try slowly trimming the beak back a bit to make it easier.  Watch how she eats and trim accordingly- the priority should be the top, but you may need to trim the bottom a little as well.  If she is having enough trouble eating that she is losing weight (or noticeably skinny), you should put her down.  You can do cervical dislocation, which is usually cleaner than an axe, but requires a bit more skill.  I can give you instructions if you need it, or just have a local farmer kill it.  The big belly looks more like ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen) than being eggbound.  It's not uncommon in older birds and usually doesn't harm them as long as they can still move.  It's exposed due to featherpicking- either from other hens or the hen itself.  Usually indicates either mites or lack of calcium in the diet.  Check for mites/egg clusters on the birds and dust with sevin dust or adams flea spray if found (may have different name brands down there though).  Otherwise add supplemental calcium (oyster shells, cleaned/crushed eggshells, etc), and make sure they are getting a proper layer feed.  The white one looks like a White Leghorn hen, not sure why she has the spurs though.  Some breeds still have hens that grow spurs, so she may be a crossbreed or just a genetic anomaly.  You can remove them if they are too long by baking a potato, impaling it on the spur for 1-2 minutes, then gently twisting the spur off.  She is very yellow however, which usually means she isn't laying (normally all the yellow pigment goes in to the yolk, bleaching out the beak and legs over time).  May just be a very effeminate rooster, but everything else in those pics looks like a hen.  These birds look at least 2-3 years old, so I wouldn't expect a ton of eggs out of them.  But they should still be good pets for a while.  Let me know if you have any other questions!"
BackYardChickens,37opoz,Aerron,3,Fri May 29 07:03:44 2015 UTC,Wow thanks so much for the help!! On second inspection it did seem like a roo because those spurs are massive! I'll isolate the birds and go from there. Thanks again!!
BackYardChickens,37opoz,Yudash2000,3,Fri May 29 07:45:57 2015 UTC,"Sure.  You can usually tell by looking at the hackles if it is a rooster or hen- pointed hackles usually mean rooster, rounded usually means hen.  Also, if it is a rooster, it will most likely crow sooner or later.  Though I have had several old hens grow massive spurs and start trying to crow (poorly) as well..."

BackYardChickens,37gpbd,kayakyakr,4,Wed May 27 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"I posted my new brooder up yesterday, I will put them out there after a couple days probably.  The lone resident will get promoted to the current (soon to be replaced with a new A frame) grow out pen."
BackYardChickens,37gpbd,Boshaft,4,Wed May 27 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"It sounds like this is a first hatching for you, so let me stress something you've probably already read-only leave the chicks in the incubator. They will chirp and holler and crash around like they're dying, but don't take them out for at least a day!  When chicks hatch, they absorb the yolk into their stomachs. This can keep them feed for a few days, which is why you can order day old chicks but not week old chicks (who would need constant food and water). The sound of them chirping also lets the other guys know that it's time, so they need to hurry up. Lastly, opening the incubator will let out all all the humidity in the air, which can dry out the membranes inside the hatched eggs and kill otherwise perfectly viable chicks.  Hopefully you have your incubator in an isolated area, because that constant chirping was hell on my nerves (ours is in the living room). Good Luck!"
BackYardChickens,37gpbd,kayakyakr,2,Wed May 27 18:53:09 2015 UTC,"Nah I hatch my own eggs all the time, just hatched 10 more this last weekend.  It's just that my own Marans (French Black Copper) aren't pure and I got pissed when I realized the chickens I drove 3 hours to buy last year aren't even full blooded, and spent some cash getting these eggs so whatever hatches from them I know are as pure as money can buy.  But yes this is definitely my first time hatching shipped eggs."

I can run these guys all through winter and keep 12 birds in the larger one up to 2 months. Summer coming on, though, it's tempting to build a combo tractor/brooder like yours.  I'm expecting an 18+ hatch out of this new batch, though, which is waaay too many. Already have a Silkie/Polish and a Buttercup/Polish pipped in addition to the full Polish hatchling. Should be all out by Friday."

BackYardChickens,37gpbd,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed May 27 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"That is odd, and if you have a low hatch rate, that may contribute to it. Starting on day 7, the hatchability of eggs begins a swift downward decline, usually becoming quite low by day 10."
BackYardChickens,37gpbd,xxred_baronxx,1 point,Wed May 27 16:33:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe they were shipped ground?  As I understand it, air travel isn't kind to eggs.  Of course if it's hot between ""here and there"" and the eggs get over 85ish degrees that could be an issue too, damned if you do, damned if you don't I suppose.  And yeah, by Saturday it should be all over but the crying (or the cheeping, I hope for cheeping)."

I've only done shipped eggs one; I had good luck with eggs from one seller and terrible with the other; from the first (bought as Malay, but turned out to be some kind of Asil-type mutt - thanks a lot, filthy lying Ebay seller) I got 7 eggs, 1 was cracked, and 3 of the remaining 6 hatched. I still have two of the birds. With my other ones (Blue-Laced Red Barnevelders), I hatched 3 of 24. 1 survived, and I ended up giving her to my friend to make room in my bantam pen (she was undersized, and never grew larger than a Silkie). She was pretty though, I'll give her that.  Air sacs are weird, I see them in strange places all the time, shipped eggs or not. I've hatched a few with odd air sacs in the past with no issue; right now, I'm more excited waiting on my current oddling pair in the 'bator - a cracked (fixed) duck egg and what I believe is a double-yolked guinea egg."

BackYardChickens,37gblt,rustleman,4,Wed May 27 12:36:23 2015 UTC,"You have a few options but your most important first step is to isolate her from the other birds. They may pick at her and can actually kill her accidentally. Keep the area around her vent clean. You'll need a topical anti inflammatory suitable for internal use. Preperation H or honey are the two most common used for chickens. Gently treat the affected area morning and night. It could revert in a day, it could take anlot more time than that. Good luck!"

BackYardChickens,37gblt,maxhatcher,3,Wed May 27 14:14:45 2015 UTC,I did the push it in with honey and it worked. Everyday for a week then it was every other day eventually it stayed in. I also separated the bird from the rest. I have a small coop for damage recovery.
BackYardChickens,37gblt,jester8484,1 point,Wed May 27 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"Be sure to separate her before the others pick at it. Try applying hemorrhoid cream or something similar and you can either see if it reverses on its own or gently push it back inside with your fingers. If it doesn't reverse within 24 hours the likelihood of recovery usually drops. If she doesn't recover within 2 days, I would cull. A vet may be able to fix it but I would imagine it would be rather expensive. Vets can put birds to sleep at their office or you can cull at home by putting her under a towel or blanket, holding at the shoulders/base of the neck with one hand and around the back of the head/wattles with the other, and twisting the head 180 degrees and pulling down and out. A strong BB gun works as well, as does broomstick method."
BackYardChickens,37gblt,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed May 27 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"I commented in another thread a while back...but this is what we did:   We had a hen with a very bad prolapse. We did everything you were 'supposed' to do...we cleaned the area with warm water and honey (for an antibacterial wash), reinserted the prolapse with a generous lubing of hydrocortisone ointment, isolated her from the flock so as to reduce pecking on her exposed area, provided supplements, etc...and she would be ok for a few days.  But we had the same problems whenever she would lay (she is an older bird so her laying is sporadic at best). Finally we took her to a vet we found about an hour and a half away who specializes in birds. He told us we had a few options, the simplest would be to perform a simple surgery which would just reinsert her prolapse and stitch her vent (literally 2 stitches above and 2 below the opening), OR a bird hysterectomy (over a thousand dollars and very risky [edited the cost...husband reminded me it was very expensive and potentially fatal])  We opted for the stitch procedure. She handled it very well! Her recovery was swift and it is now 2-years later and she hasn't had a relapse! We took the stitches out ourselves and she didn't even fuss :)  So if the home remedies don't work...it might be worth looking for a vet near you who can help. Try to find one that specializes in avians. I found farm vets didn't really do chickens...and standard vets didn't either...  Bruce at the vet before her procedure...the puddle behind her is her leaking vent...she was NOT a happy bird that day   Bruce lived a very happy life for several years after her procedure...sadly she passed on Monday...but it was not prolapse related...she never had another incident after that.  Good Luck!"

It's difficult to tell from the angles of the photos, plus EEs are very difficult to sex. Can you post some photos of them standing, with the tails visible?  Also, at my workplace, we make them flip their tails before we sell them to anyone, and we don't sell them if they won't flip. Take the bird, hold it facing toward you, calm it until it relaxes its body (it won't work with stiff legs), then very quickly tip the bird forward so the butt goes into the air. Hens will usually flip their tails up and fan the feathers. Roos occasionally do, but not very often. My boss (he's been keeping them for 35 years) swears by the method."

BackYardChickens,37dcmu,TechnicallyMagic,8,Wed May 27 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"Farm animal is a relative term. Yes, technically, they are an animal that lives on farms. However, for some people, chickens are well-loved pets, and in some cases, like those who breed for show, a bird is a very expensive project - in my flock, for example, there is probably over $1000 worth of quality stock, including some birds worth $100-$200 on their own. For some, birds are livestock, to be humanely culled if a cheap fix is not available, and that's OK too. I've been on both sides of this fence - I've culled production birds because a home-fix wasn't available, and I've also driven over 200 miles and paid almost $1000 to fix up an Orpington roo after a dog attack."

BackYardChickens,37c4qd,Altah,2,Tue May 26 21:30:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely prolapse. Occasionally, if the area is cleaned and hemorrhoid cream is applied, it will reverse itself, but I've never personally had luck with that method. Then again, I also have a friend with an OEGB who prolapses every few weeks (she lays HUGE eggs for such a tiny bird) and it's been consistently reversed each time, so I guess it varies by bird. You can also take her to the vet, I'm sure there are options available from a vet that can't be explored at home, although I can't say specifically what they are as I've never taken a bird to the vet for this particular issue. However, if it doesn't reverse after about 24 hours and the vet cannot fix it, chances are it's not going to get better, and you will need to cull her. I suggest wrapping her in a cloth and removing the head with a quick twist and pull. It's an ideal cull method and nearly painless for the bird. (The cloth is for those who don't wish to see the process, understandably so)."

She's pretty skeeved out by the little suckers, and it took some convincing to get her to go along with this method of pest removal rather than pesticide.

BackYardChickens,37b4ht,BinkyGreen,6,Tue May 26 09:22:12 2015 UTC,"You may need to teach or just give them time to figure it out. Roosting is a learned behavior. If they've never had a chance/or had to roost, it'll take them a little bit to discover how awesome it is to not poop on each other and be off the ground at night :). When they start to doze off, set it up on the roost. They'll get the hang of it."
BackYardChickens,37b4ht,simplyjessi,3,Tue May 26 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, this. They somehow teach themselves if they have access to roosts when young, but older birds who never roosted like ex batts will need some encouragement, but they'll figure it out.  Another thing to consider is how high is the perch? They may just not want to jump up high, if you start them with a low perch (6in) where they like to huddle up at night then maybe they'll get it themselves, then transition to a taller one."
BackYardChickens,37b4ht,shoutpy,5,Tue May 26 20:34:38 2015 UTC,"How old are they? Some of mine sleep on the floor, and some get up on the roosting bars. Usually the older they get the more they like being up off the ground. The younger chickens prefer to huddle up in groups like a big chicken blanket on the ground.  Another thing is the shape and size of the perch. Some folks like to have a flatter perch in the coop for sleeping, like a board with a flat surface, and others like a more curved approach, like a cut-off broom handle."
BackYardChickens,37b4ht,kibitzello,3,Tue May 26 12:40:04 2015 UTC,"I found that my birds strongly prefer a natural tree branch in the coop.

BackYardChickens,37a4rt,poorsoi,2,Tue May 26 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"Predator is my guess, but that's just based on my experience from the last 2 years or so. Perhaps someone more experienced can chime in. But here is my reasoning:  I've had ""beta"" roosters before, and they've never run off. Even the lowest bird in the pecking order recognizes the importance of safety in numbers. I've only had chickens wander off once or twice ever, and this was a hen making a private nest to brood on.  Four of our chickens were lost to a bobcat last year, and we never saw a bit of evidence until the fourth one. That time I actually saw the bobcat hop in, grab a chicken, and make off with it without leaving so much as a feather behind. Some predators are messy (like dogs that kill for fun or weasels which will just tear the head off), but efficient, human-shy wild animals can make off with a chicken without leaving much of a trail.  As for the rest of your flock, chickens are easily spooked, but they also bounce back quickly. If you didn't see them until hours after it happened, there is a perfectly good chance they would be behaving normally.  Finally, I googled ""mottled Houdan rooster"" since I'm not familiar with that breed. Unfortunately, this looks like a breed that would be a prime candidate to predation. White birds are easy to spot and that poof around his head would make it more difficult for him to see predators."

Either way, I completely understand.  We had a neighbor's dog break down a slat in our fence and he killed 7 of my 8 hens while I was at work one day.  We were devastated, and are definately more paranoid with the new flock.  That being said, I love for my girls to be happy, and I like to think they are more healthy eating grass and bugs.  I know their eggs are healthier for us!  We only let them free range when we are at home, though.  That way if anything gets in the yard, we can hear them kicking up a fuss (had to chase off a red tail hawk who was swooping at them last fall).

Somebody will be home all day today so we're letting them out for the day. I'm glad they get to be out. They're not laying yet but they seem happy to be out. Thanks for your input!"

The weasle that decimated our flock did it during the night, but I wouldn't be shocked if they did day time attacks.  Between hawks, weasles, and foxes.. we lose one to two birds a year and it absolutely sucks. It traumatizes their friends and us.  We've made a smaller enclosed run for them and during mating season we keep them in the run, but once it's summer and most baby animals are grown up and don't have their parents trying to support them, we let them back into the large yard. It's not a perfect system, but it lets them enjoy space while mitigating the risk during the time of year when most predators up their game."

BackYardChickens,375qwq,sordidlyspeaking,3,Mon May 25 02:51:14 2015 UTC,"What type of feed do you keep your birds on? Feed can make a lot of difference. Brands like Purina are usually quite low quality. Try switching to a higher-quality feed if you do currently feed something like Purina. If you're in the western U.S. I highly reccomend Bar Ale. I've also heard good things about FRM in the Eastern U.S.  Sounds like Ascites. I don't think I've ever heard of a treatment besides draining. I have seen birds stop walking but then get better, although it's been from different causes, like Marek's disease or nutritional deficiencies.  I understand the feeling of bad luck. My flocks been hit with three different contagious diseases over the last few years, Marek's, M.G., and M.S. Four, if you include the bout of dry fowl pox a few months back, luckily that one passed within a few weeks.  I don't know why anyone would tell you chickens can only survive two years, hatchery type or not. Chickens have a natural lifespan of ten years or so, barring death to predation or disease. It is true that Leghorns have a decline in laying around 2 years, but this is only found in Leghorns (other breeds decline around 4 years) and they certainly don't die, they just lay somewhat fewer eggs. (probably 180-200/year instead of 250+/year)."

In My area of the US it is pretty common to find $5 chicks that don't make the cut for a brewer's program but are still great birds.  My experience with your specific problem is limited, my parrot got it from egg binding and died. Do you feed oyster shell for healthier eggs? I recommend as high quality food as you can afford, and lots of nutritious treats. Have you tried sprouting fodder for them or doing fermented feed? Both of these things add huge nutritional boosts for a very small amount of money. In the case of fermented feed, the investment is a little extra time but less money than the dry food since it goes further.   My 5 years with chickens have included: CRV, Mereck's, Bobcat that killed 30 hens, Bumblefoot, Brain damage from low oxygen after getting attacked by other hens (poor integration technique), ingrown feathers, abscess, snake eating 19 chicks after learning how to unlock a bird cage, and a poked out eye.

I've done this same thing with newly hatched turkeys as well as older ones from someone elses farm. I keep them in the pen for a couple weeks before letting them out.

BackYardChickens,370dd7,Luaire,5,Sat May 23 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"Here in the US, vaccinating chickens seems to be an economic issue. A lot of places accept the attrition over the cost of meds and labor.  You first need to make sure that you will not lose your organic certification. I have no clue except assuming that it is better to check than be surprised.  Part of the problem with small flocks and vaccines is that the meds are sold in large quantities. You may need to work with a vet or a farm co-op.  Since you mention visitors, be sure to take a good look at your biosecurity measures. You would not want your flock to catch something from outside (and vice versa)."
BackYardChickens,370dd7,ReverendEarthwormJim,2,Sat May 23 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have clarified: we are not certified organic but we farm organically (no pesticides, fungicides, use organic homemade fertilizers, etc.) so I am not concerned with a revocation of certification. However, a good point.   I had the same feeling that because we do enjoy so many visitors, I should take extra precautions against viruses (and other problems that can be brought in).  A recent example was a well meaning neighbor who felt our young flock needed a dominant rooster to maintain order and dropped off his large friend; now I am dealing with a lice infestation and the possibility of worms.   I guess talking to our vet, our local extension, and perhaps coordinating with other local farms and chicken owners is the way to go.    How risky is not vaccinating? Which are the 'essential' vaccines?"

BackYardChickens,370dd7,bonobo1,1 point,Sat May 23 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"The farm veterinarian should know what's up in relation to your particular situation.    As a backyard hobbyist I tend towards the vaccination route (buying vaccinated birds) as it helps to rule out a lot of potential issues if a chicken gets ill, as well as preventing a number of illnesses from decimating the flock.  Also I think it's generally in the chicken's, their flock's and neighbour's interests, for the same kind of reason that we vaccinate children.  For a business though, as already said, I think you will ultimately have to make an economic decision, and take advice from people who know your kind business locally (like your farm vet).  Rules concerning organic certification could be key."

BackYardChickens,370dd7,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat May 23 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really have that option of unfortunately.  It's either a choice between vaccinated or not really. Commercial hens in the UK are routinely vaccinated for Infectious Bronchitis, Avian RhinoTracheitis, Mycoplasma gallisepticum as well as Marek's (although I think this raises chick mortality).  Most of my flock are 'retired' ex commercial hens that will have received the range of vaccinations.  I try to make sure any others I take on have been vaccinated as chicks, but I don't bother with any boosters.  Hopefully I should have enough heard immunity.  If you were going to choose your vaccines though, I'm sure it would  be a choice very specific to your needs and local area."

Being crammed together requires a lot more care and sanitation because of the sheer amount of crud that collects. There's also the ammonia issue that irritates their lungs.

A Welsummer and a single comb Brown Leghorn. I have no idea what I'm going to do with them yet. My flock is only big enough to keep one rooster around (and I definitely wouldn't mind keeping one if his temperament is right). Anyone have experience with these breeds of roosters? Are they typically aggressive?    I'm super sad I'm missing out on pretty white and chocolate eggs as I planned. But hey! The exotic chick is a buff laced Polish pullet! So I've got that going for me!"
BackYardChickens,36ouis,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed May 20 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"I would imagine they would both be rather skittish. The Leghorn for certain, and I've never heard of Welsummers being especially friendly either. If neither of them turn out to have particularly special personalities, I would rehome these guys and get a more friendly, gentle breed, like a Brahma, Cochin, or similar. Roosters are great fun, but if you can only have one, I'd get one with a really pleasant personality.  If you do decide to rehome them, craigslist is a great place. It's usually a pretty safe place to advertise them; most people don't want to eat roosters anyways, because they taste nasty. Add a ""pet only!"" note in the ad, just in case, and I'm sure you'll be able to find homes for them."

BackYardChickens,36ozs1,mommyandlove,1 point,Thu May 21 04:10:38 2015 UTC,"She might not brood. She just found a convenient and safe spot to lay. With my hens, I've found that one of the hens who is not predisposed to be broody (like the silkie) will decide she needs to sit on eggs once there are 10-12.  So you can collect eggs and make an omlet or you can let her continue to lay and see if she goes broody."

BackYardChickens,36naei,Latexagogo,2,Wed May 20 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"It was a good idea to separate her from the rest of your flock. They may be pecking her because she wasn't defending herself, and then they kept pecking because the flesh was red. Chickens are genetically conditioned to be attracted to red.   Make sure you keep her warm, give her access to water and feed, and make sure she's still able to to do her chickeny things like pecking, scratching, and bathing. These are important behaviors for her physically and mentally."

There's not really much that can be done about it, but if there are three other nest boxes, I see no issue. I have 30-40 laying birds in my flock, and 3 nest boxes total. Half of the birds refuse to use them, and back when I had 10 or more nest boxes at the same time, they only used the same 3 every day. Hens will be picky about their nesting spots."

BackYardChickens,36jcg6,krose0206,1 point,Tue May 19 20:51:22 2015 UTC,Do you sell your eggs?
BackYardChickens,36jcg6,frugalNOTcheap,0,Wed May 20 18:44:18 2015 UTC,We sure do!
BackYardChickens,36jcg6,krose0206,1 point,Wed May 20 23:40:46 2015 UTC,If you dont mind me asking how much do you sell them for?  How many per week do you sell?  Do you use a heat lamp to keep up production in the winter?  Is it hard to get clients?  How much do you spend on feed per week?  Sorry for all the questions. Im just wondering if I can turn a hobby into a small amount of pocket cash.
BackYardChickens,36jcg6,frugalNOTcheap,1 point,Thu May 21 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"Ok.... We don't use a heat lamp or extra light in the winter. With the harsh winters in upstate NY, the eggs freeze quick and I really don't enjoy trudging out to the coop. We have talked about improving the coop for this year and may try to keep the girls laying all year. I'm pretty cheap with my egg prices. We charge $3/dz. I've seen them going for. $4-4.50 at the markets. I stay low for my older customers.   Feed runs around 11 for egg layer pellets and 9 for cracked corn. In the winter I go through roughly 5 bags of each per month.In the spring-summer-fall I try to only give them food as a treat. They get one small bucket scattered through my yard. They have to scavage for the rest of their food. They are great bug control.  I let them roam about 4 acres. Of course all this will change as this was for only 35 chickens. I have since added 54.   For customers I sometimes use Craigslist and word of mouth. I sell 10-15 dozen a week. That will increase when my new batch of pullets start laying.  I also sell fertilized eggs for hatching. That has been the big thing this spring.  Hope this helps."
BackYardChickens,36jcg6,krose0206,1 point,Thu May 21 01:14:52 2015 UTC,Yes it helps a lot. How much area does a chicken need to find enough food to lay an egg? I have 2400 sq ft fenced off at the moment but I plan on expanding it to 5600 sq ft this summer (I only have 6 chicks).  Right now Im worried they are getting too feed dependent and not foraging enough.
BackYardChickens,36jcg6,frugalNOTcheap,0,Thu May 21 02:01:36 2015 UTC,I would make two separate areas so you can rotate them on and off. That way the grass will grow back and be ready for your hens.
BackYardChickens,36jcg6,krose0206,1 point,Thu May 21 19:51:26 2015 UTC,but is 2400 sq ft enough space to even forage in? They are currently eating some of the grass but it doesnt seem like they are eating bugs. Would 5600 sq ft be much of a difference?
BackYardChickens,36jcg6,frugalNOTcheap,1 point,Thu May 21 21:43:04 2015 UTC,More is always better. If you pump up the quality of the pasture for them then it might be fine. Rotate and reseed. Grow lettuce and other fresh greens. Make a decent mud patch for worms. You can also make a hanging maggot feeder. (Uses raw meat).

Provide food and water, but NO bedding.  Keep her in there for 3-4 days, unless she lays an egg earlier.   Let her out one morning and watch what she does.  If she hurries back to the nest spot, she'll need a few more days in the Broody Buster.  But if she goes back to hang out with her flockmates, her mood has changed."

They get some days in the broody box and the other girls get to lay in comfort.  We have a few chickens that will go broody and not let smaller chickens lay eggs in the other nesting box.  No guilt here about using the broody box
BackYardChickens,36jusz,DavisDogLady,2,Wed May 20 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on you.  As long as the chicken isn't actively broody, you shouldn't have much of a problem.  I had a brood last season.  The active part of staying in the nest was short (only about three days), but it took over a month before that one started laying eggs again.  It wasn't that bad and it didn't encourage more broodiness.  Letting a chicken brood is a possibility assuming you don't care about the eggs and have enough nesting boxes.  I had two open (an extra is blocked off for food storage) for 5 hens.  Having one try to lay an egg on top of a broody hen was an issue."

I thought to myself ""I'll never be able to sell her""  When it came time to sell the pups, a family with two kids came and wouldn't you know, that freaky pup LOVED those kids.

BackYardChickens,36ee9r,immafoxx,4,Mon May 18 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"I would be concerned and keep an eye on your other chickens for any symptoms at all. If you notice a chicken acting strange or coughing or anything like that, separate it immediately. If you have another death, call around and see if any vets will do a necropsy. If you're in the midwest right now it would probably be really easy to get someone to test your flock for avian flu.    Otherwise, what are the living conditions like? What breeds are they? Type of feed, free range/cooped, etc? What has the weather been like in your area? Do they have good access to clean water? Are there any strange stools in the coop? Details like that might seem mundane but could help you identify what's going on.    In the meantime, it might not hurt to start putting some probiotics in your chicken's diets or water. You can buy drops for the water at most feed stores, or give them yogurt if they'll eat it (some of mine will, others won't). Antibiotics could be a good idea as well, but I prefer to avoid them unless I know what specific pathogen I'm dealing with."
BackYardChickens,36ee9r,cordial_carbonara,3,Mon May 18 19:42:02 2015 UTC,- this. The other thing to consider is if your feed has gone mouldy or something.
BackYardChickens,36ee9r,falling_stone,3,Mon May 18 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the concerned response. We also are wondering if it is possible for the chicken to die from an egg exploding while laying. They are mostly free range with a coop they sleep in at night all completely covered and shaded by trees. We feed them egg laying hen feed we get at a local feed store and kitchen scrapes. They most defiantly always have access to clean water and food. One hen was a RIR and the other was a Cornish. As for the weather lately we live in Florida so it's been rainy as it always is and rather hot. Other than the two deaths everything has been normal even with the two we loss, they showed no signs of alarm anytime before they passed and we do spend a lot of time with them so it would be very easy to tell."
BackYardChickens,36ee9r,cordial_carbonara,2,Mon May 18 19:58:46 2015 UTC,"Impacted eggs or eggs breaking before being laid can certainly result in death. However, most hens who have this happen definitely show symptoms beforehand. They would stop eating, maybe limp or droop their wings, and just generally appear unwell.    If it's been damp, check your feed and coop for mold. I lost a couple meat birds to moldy feed this year (Texas has been getting more rain than we're accustomed to)."

At that point, we decided that maybe WE needed to change something, so we switched to a dry hatch method. Two new clutches arrived. 3 from a clutch of 4 hatched (yay!), but the other clutch got into day 7, showing nothing to lead us to believe they'd develop."

You can keep batches of live fermented feed in the fridge for up to a week, or you can always freeze it for longterm storage.  As another Deep South chicken keeper, I'd also add this: keep your bulk feed in wooden or plastic bins. No metal! Metal bins will sweat and transfer moisture to the feed."

BackYardChickens,36cdqr,mocweems,1 point,Mon May 18 06:44:48 2015 UTC,"The Wyandottes will not kill your RIRs. I have never heard of adult or adolescent birds killing one another, except of course fighting breeds which are prone to fighting to the death if left together.  They will certainly fight, and some birds will bully other birds. This is unavoidable, no matter how birds are introduced. Only time can solve this issue. You did mention that the pens are side by side; if they aren't capable of seeing each other through the fencing now, you may want to adapt the pens so they can. Familiarity will certainly help with the process. When you do make the transition, be sure to do it during the night. Simply place the new birds in the coop where they will all be staying after the others have gone to roost.  What age were the chicks you attempted to integrate previously? They were likely too young. I have had chicks killed by adults multiple times, due to early introduction. It's important to balance all factors when introducing fowl at young ages.  16 weeks is plenty old to switch to a laying feed. I work at a poultry specialty store, and we recommend to all our customers to switch from grower to layer at 16-18 weeks.  I find myself concerned by your rooster to hen ratio. 4:5 is far too high, especially with roosters like Rhode Islands, which can be very mean when they want to. You will at the very least see a lot of feather loss in the hens and some fighting between the cocks, and at the worst they may injure you hens. In the past, I've had two hens fatally wounded due to keeping too many roosters at the time (three total were injured, but for the first I chose to pay our vet $200 to clean and sow her wound). I highly suggest you rehome or cull them, or at the very least looking into buying some hen saddles or additional pullets."
BackYardChickens,36cdqr,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon May 18 10:00:20 2015 UTC,"The barrier between pens is just chicken wire, so they've seen each other all the time.   The killed chick's were too young. I tried to put a piece of plywood in front of the coop entrance and leave the chicks in the coop.  But the wood fell and that was the end of that.   The rooster ratio does concern me. We didn't want 3 roosters, but my gf bought chicks  from tractor supply and she could have sworn they were sex linked.  I personally want to get rid of all of them, blood has been drawn on me from the Wyandotte rooster.   One detail I didn't mention was that this whole senerio is actually at my gf's parents' house. They have land, and it's only a 35 minute drive. So I only see the birds every weekend at best. That's the main reason for my heavy concern."
BackYardChickens,36cdqr,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon May 18 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"I always snort when I hear the words ""Tractor Supply"". The people there have no clue what they're doing when it comes to chicks. I mean, all feed stores tend to be clueless to some degree, but the sheer lack of care and knowledge I've seen at TS certainly usurps the standard level.  I've heard of TS mislabeling breeds before, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if your RIRs were supposed to be Golden Sex-Links. They look quite similar, to the inexperienced eye. Of course, why TS might buy straight run chicks of any breed, I can't even begin to fathom, but there's no way you got that many cockerels any other way.  It's a shame that so many people have no choice but to buy from them, or similar feed stores doing a similarly (if slightly less) crappy job. I'm lucky enough to have a specialty store in my town, but it's very unfortunate not everyone has access to someplace like that.  Why is she still keeping the birds? Does she have an attachment to them? I suggest you tell her to keep them until the two flocks are completely integrated (birds always integrate better in large groups), then get rid of at least 3 of the cockerels. Craigslist is best, and there is actually plenty of opportunity to find them a good home. There's really little concern about the roosters being eaten or fought (they're the wrong breeds entirely). Except perhaps the one who has attacked you. I can't see any reason for someone to buy a human-aggressive rooster except perhaps stew, but then, frankly, there is no better solution to an aggressive rooster."
BackYardChickens,36cdqr,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon May 18 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"She just loves animals in general and doesn't want to get rid of any. That's why we have the birds in the first place. Our first ducks were supposed to be Swedish. Both were neither. We lost 1 duck and 3 chickens total to predators getting in. Hopefully that's over with. The young ducks, we bought 4. 1 was blind and after about 1 week.   Probably will keep one of the RIR roosters. They are somewhat hesitant about people. But at least not aggressive. Up to me, we would have zero roosters period. We don't plan on trying to hatch any eggs again."

To get to really noticeable, you need a few days of incubation.  Most people pull eggs daily, which would be enough to stop embryo formation (unless you live someplace where ambient temperature is routinely in the 90s all the time.)   Eggs need to stay really warm for a long period for there to be a chance at chicken life.  It would take a few days for you to see effects of fertilization (blood vessels; creepy!).  Even then the egg would still be edible."

Now they just go in on their own without the light when it gets dark.  You could also try luring them back with some scratch for a few days or so, just anything to make it part of their routine."
BackYardChickens,367uh2,Mczwiz,1 point,Sun May 17 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"I did the light trick and I also put some roosting poles in the coop.  They're up high where the birds can see out the upper vents and every night after dark I go out there, do a head-count and close the door to the run.  Oh, and for the light, try getting one of those solar-powered lawn lights from Home Depot.  I got $50 model that turns on automatically at dusk and I was able to disassemble it so that the solar panel mounts on the facade of the coop and the wire goes inside where the light shines up at the roof.  It runs until about midnight.  If you haven't tried that to make the place a little more appealing, then you might.  Also my coop is up on cinder blocks so they have a place to hide down there if they prefer, but they all seem to like the roost."

BackYardChickens,367uh2,SGB_Mom,2,Sun May 17 02:29:03 2015 UTC,"What I have done that works well is to train them with a verbal cue. Keep them in the cage for about a week or more and every time you feed them make some unique sound( we say chick chick chick). On days when they are being free ranged, do not give them food until it is time for them to go up. Then make your sound and put food in their enclosure. Our chickens usually go up without a hitch using this method. This works for both ground level and elevated coops."

Ours love bananas or canned corn. Once they recognize a treat, they'll run wherever you're standing. Sometimes it take 2 of us to reign them in. I used to have to create two parts to the coop/pen where I got half of my flock in the pen on the first try and brought the other half in through the back coop door.

BackYardChickens,364geg,ReverendEarthwormJim,1 point,Sat May 16 08:48:32 2015 UTC,"Put a thermometer in there. You want to start them at 90 and back it down a degree every day until they can go outside without getting a chill.  They will move closer to the heat lamp when cold and will move away when they are too warm.  Calibrate your thermometer. Don't assume the temp is correct. Check it against your house thermostat, for example.  I got a couple thermometer/hygrometer battery-operated gadgets at Wally World. Used them for hatching eggs where temp and humidity must be controlled. Note that calibrating the hygrometer for humidity is critical for hatching, but not relevant for chicks."
BackYardChickens,364geg,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Sat May 16 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yep like u/ReverendEarthwormJim said thermometers are the ticket. We have a couple of those outdoor thermometers that we put in there with peepers. And yes if they are all bunched up under the lamp they are trying to get warm, if they are far away from it they are trying to cool. It's much easier to regulate though if you have a thermometer."
BackYardChickens,363uha,LakeRat,5,Fri May 15 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"You will eventually lose some to predators. It just happens with free ranging in the country. The dogs roaming would probably be your biggest problem, as hawks don't tend to take that many. Also, dogs are bad about coming back for more once they've gotten a taste, so you need to be ready to deal with your neighbors about keeping their dogs on their own property or be prepared to protect your flock with force.    Unless you clip their wings, no a 4 ft fence is not going to keep them out. And clipping their wings would be a bad idea if they're going to be vulnerable to predators.    I've never heard of adult chickens drowning. They're typically not as stupid as people claim.    Yes, they will destroy your garden. Quickly.    Free ranging chickens is wonderful, and they absolutely love it. However, as you can tell, it's not without logistical problems! How much you're willing to deal with is up to you. Another solution would be building a permanent run that is plenty large enough for most of the time, and allowing your chickens to range outside of it on days when you can be around to monitor them. It doesn't have to be all or nothing!"

Put them up a day or two before you intend to have a cookout to give the bait time to bloom, so to speak.   An old trick for eating areas is a ziploc full of water.

BackYardChickens,35y5hr,heathenyak,4,Thu May 14 15:19:38 2015 UTC,"I made a broody breaker last week cause my cochins were all turning broody. A few days in the breaker and they all came out of it. They are back to there normal selves. Unless yoy plan to use broodt hens to hatch and raise chicks, I would highly recommend making one."
BackYardChickens,35y5hr,TehRealRedbeard,3,Thu May 14 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why they do it, but it's funny as hell when they do. My Barred Rock, Pepper, did that last year. I called it going into turkey mode because of how she looked when she puffed up and got all weird. I loved it."
BackYardChickens,35y5hr,ChickenChic,6,Thu May 14 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"Hormones. When chickens become broody their hormones have sort of taken over temporarily. It also has a lot to do with instinct. Broody hens do take little breaks from warming their eggs, looking for food/water. Their behavior, raised feathers, making that 'buk buk' noise and acting agitated is all normal. It's all down to hormones and instinct."
BackYardChickens,35y5hr,DuchessofYanks,2,Thu May 14 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"Broodiness is controlled by hormones which also instill rage which makes them fiercely protective of their eggs.  I had one go broody a few weeks ago and she was protecting the eggs that others were laying, my husband was terrified of retrieving the eggs!"
BackYardChickens,35ydh0,mattdanskin,3,Thu May 14 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"What ever type of grass you plant, the chickens will scratch and tear it up eventually unless you fence them out of it. When I first started, my backyard was nice and full of pretty plants, perennials, and nice grass. After two years it was a mud/poophole in the winter and dry and beat up in the spring summer and fall.   Contractor grade grass from the home center would be fine to get started."
BackYardChickens,35ydh0,jfastman,2,Thu May 14 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"Seconding this, but also, remember, you can make a frame from 2x4 materials, and staple screening (hardware cloth) over the top to preserve an area. The grass roots are protected under the screen, and the grass grows through the screen holes. The chickens can only eat and scratch what is taller than the screen."
BackYardChickens,35ydh0,KazenDei,3,Thu May 14 17:08:08 2015 UTC,"You'll never get grass to survive inside a run, especially one that size. My chicken tractor has a 12x6 run and it only takes two weeks for 10 hens to turn thick, well established grass into bare dirt. Even when they're free ranging the area in the run will eventually get destroyed just from the traffic of them going in and out to the feeder and nest boxes."
BackYardChickens,35ydh0,Taidashar,1 point,Thu May 14 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"What time of year do you plan to pull the birds off that area to grow grass? Pick something that will grow well for the season.  Also, once you put birds on it they will lay waste to whatever you plant in short order. May as well plant something cheap and yummy. If you allow time to let it go to seed, buckwheat, amaranth, sorghum and oats are all super chicken grains. If sowing in fall in Colorado, maybe try hardy rye or winter wheat."
BackYardChickens,35ydh0,Zebba_Odirnapal,1 point,Thu May 14 21:04:41 2015 UTC,I have 25 meat birds in a 8x8 ft tractor. I move the tractor once a day and the ground is completely bare. There's no way you're going to be able to keep grass in that run unless you keep the chickens out of it for weeks at a time so it can grow.

BackYardChickens,35wcpl,Benji_Likes_Waffles,1 point,Sun May 17 10:05:08 2015 UTC,"We immediately began handling them. We put our hands in the brooder, palms up, flat on the bottom. Doing that tells the chicks that hands are nothing to be afraid of. We pick them up from the bottom by gently scooping them up. If you come at them from above, they think you're a predator and flip out. They're sweet little things, but not necessarily tame just yet. We're working on it through consistent handling and by using an open brooder that's in the middle of the living room. ""Oh my god, the living room?!?!"" Yep. We have them in a hardware cloth pen on layers of easily changed papers in the floor. They see and hear us all day. When they get older, they won't spaz out like our hen-raised birds. Those girls are freaking nutcases. Walk out onto the deck? The sky is falling. Good luck with your babies!"

BackYardChickens,35w99p,z-seel,3,Thu May 14 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"This behavior is usually referred to as brooding or sitting.  If there are no other birds bothering her or laying eggs in the same nest (having widely varied hatch-dates can be disastrous and usually results in live eggs being abandoned because they didn't hatch at the same time as the rest) then you can leave her where she is.  If not, you should set up a medium-sized dog crate in the corner of your coop, fill it with bedding, create a small nest, and move her at night. You can move her eggs with her if you want, although depending on how long she's been brooding, you may want to candle and see if any are less developed than the others, which could indicate they are fresher and should be scrapped before they get any further along, to prevent late death.  Once a hen becomes broody they cease laying until they either A. fail to hatch anything or B. have raised chicks to several weeks of age. If you wanted, you could scrap this batch and give her eggs of your choosing from other hens (if you wanted a certain breed or something similar), but this batch is probably just fine to leave with her if you aren't picky."
BackYardChickens,35w99p,GallusLafayetti,2,Thu May 14 02:57:55 2015 UTC,"The term is broody. Personally would leave where she is. If you do move her, take her eggs she's laying on with her."
BackYardChickens,35w99p,LadyLouCup,2,Thu May 14 02:28:19 2015 UTC,"I have a ""maternity ward"" set up for one of my broody hens. I continue to put the other hen eggs under her. She's grateful to have an entire batch.   Candle them in a week and take out the ones that aren't fertile. Let her hatch the rest. Easy peasy. She won't get fertile eggs if she's enclosed away from t he rooster."
BackYardChickens,35w99p,moosobay,1 point,Thu May 14 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"Seconding the ""move her at night"" thing if you're moving her. Broodys are known to get aggressive and bite sometimes.

BackYardChickens,35w99p,jennythegreat,1 point,Thu May 14 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"Moving at night is the best way, but if she's nice and really broody, it won't matter. As long as she can see the eggs, she will sit on them. More than likely. At least that's been the case with my silkies. Maybe it's a certain breed kind of behavior."
BackYardChickens,35w99p,moosobay,1 point,Thu May 14 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"Well thanks everyone for the help!  It took me a few days to get to it but I have made an area for my broody hen!  I took with her all the eggs she was sitting on, maybe a dozen and a half or so. When I picked her up to move her she had more than I expected under her.  I placed all the eggs in a box first, then slowly plopped her in. She didn't seem to mind it too much.  I put her in the new area with the eggs and checked on her after dinner, she was sitting on all but 3. I placed the 3 right in front of her and in the morning today she had those added to her stash."

BackYardChickens,35tkmm,compwalla,1 point,Wed May 13 11:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 1:3 cock to hen ratio is definitely your issue. The proper ratio is 1:8 standard and 1:10 bantam (could probably be bent to 1:6 and 1:8 respectively but no lower). In the meantime, saddles will do just fine. They can stay on 24/7 until the hens grow their feathers back and your new hens are added to the flock, but check for lice/mites weekly. The undersides of saddles make perfect breeding grounds for them. If you see any, take the saddle off and throw it in the washer, and dust the hen thoroughly."

He knew that I had an incubator going so he brought the eggs over and I popped them in.   15 of the 18 eggs hatched. There ended up being 14 hens and 1 tom.   They stuck around for a while until they were full grown, then the hens all left one day. After a day or two the tom (that I named 'Wishbone') took off after them.   I even took a movie of one of them hatching:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjHUR7OyGmo  I wasn't terribly upset when they left. Turkeys are very, very messy. Messier than chickens by far.

I, personally, don't feed grit at all. My chicks go out at 3-4 weeks of age, and they find their own grit in the soil. I have several year old hens and cocks who have been raised on the property and never fed grit, and are doing quite well.  What kind of soil is in your area? If it's anything even mildy rocky, they should be fine to just get their own grit whenever they're sent outside, which, at 5 weeks of age, I would imagine will be rather soon. You can buy grit if you want, (it's not that expensive), but I wouldn't really peg it as necessary."

The technical ratio is 1(rooster):8(hens)  for standards and 1:10 for bantams, but there are a few ways of getting around this if you don't want that many fowl.  I would suggest you get 2-3 standard-sized hens (more difficult for him to upset than birds his own size) and fit them each with a hen saddle, which should prevent most feather damage and keep them pretty healthy. You can visit the chicken breeds wiki which I recently set up for basic information about some of the most common breeds."

That'll keep flies down. It can be scooped like a cat box as well.  If you want to protect the yard, try putting something in there for them to peck at. A quarter head of cabbage is good. I've got a hanging basket feeder I fill with spinach and pieces of over ripe fruit every morning.

I couldn't tell exactly how large of a coop/run you have, so I didn't want to suggest putting in a ton of pine shavings (as it's typically more expensive than straw). If cost isn't a big deal, go ahead and put down a layer of pine shavings, as it will absorb the smell (and give off a pine-sol freshness), then follow up with a thin layer of straw (to help provide softness to the ground and to aid in absorbing moisture and nitrogen)."

BackYardChickens,35qipc,Yudash2000,2,Wed May 13 13:54:07 2015 UTC,"We are in Vista with 4 girls (2 leghorns, 2 silver laced wyandottes). Think they'd get along? Does he crow a lot? We orginally planned on just the 4 girls with eggs, but if you can't find a home, let me know."
BackYardChickens,35qipc,SGB_Mom,1 point,Wed May 13 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"I won't sugar coat it, he does crow quite a bit once the sun rises but after 7am he's pretty quiet. But it is mostly due to other roosters in the area going off around that time. He possibly would be pretty quiet if there are no other roos for him to call at.   He extremely loves the ladies and always shares his food with them first. He has fathered children so he will mount if the girls let him. He's pretty gentle though, none of my hens have lost any back feathers over it.  Edit: he currently lives with four silkies, a blue laced red wyandotte, and a dominique (and my black tail roo). He's only ever made babies with two of the silkies. The wyandotte and dominique are too smart for him."

He was an unintended roo and got along with my black tail roo until he got bigger than him. He's been challenging him lately and I just don't want anyone to get hurt. He's a pure bred bearded white silkie, loves hugs, finding food for the ladies, and very gentle.   EDIT: Here's a pic of one of his daughters. This is a cross with a buff non bearded silkie (ended up making a bearded partridge). The beard is strong with him so if you wanted super fluffy bearded babies, he'd be the roo to talk to."

BackYardChickens,35q97q,AppleSpicer,1 point,Tue May 12 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"Ours seem to perch on just about anything available: the food dish, the top of the cage, each other...  We found a stick in the yard that seemed to be thick enough to give them something to stand on comfortably and hold their weight, but small enough that we could shave the ends and have the cage hold it up. They seem to enjoy it, at least until the mini-joust games start up and everyone gets knocked off."
BackYardChickens,35q97q,kibitzello,1 point,Wed May 13 12:49:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, it is ideal to prevent them from roosting until they are older. Early roosting can easily cause crooked breasts. I raise my chicks to 2-4 weeks in dog kennels or similar, on a towel or shavings. I do not provide anything for roosting. Once they're sent outside, they usually huddle on the floor in one of the corners at night (or sneak underneath my non-roosting Silkies or broody hens, who usually seem rather perplexed as to why they're being mobbed by two dozen fluffy babies when they don't remember hatching all those??). I don't often see roosting behavior before 5-6 weeks of age, and if I do, I discourage it. This is fine, and the later a bird roosts, the straighter of a breast it will have."

BackYardChickens,35puox,onlyone21,1 point,Tue May 12 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"3 years isn't old at all, unless ""Blackie"" is something like a Cornish Cross! They can easily live to 10 years old. If there's a vet in your area who treats poultry, I'd take him in asap. There's a lot of poultry diseases that show as respiratory symptoms, some not serious at all but other are very serious and could spread to the rest of your flock. Right now, isolate him from the rest of the flock and monitor his progress until you can get him into a vet."
BackYardChickens,35puox,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Tue May 12 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"3 years isn't old; the world record for oldest chicken was an OEGB hen who lived to something like 15. I, personally, have had quite a few 4, 5, and 6 year olds pass through my flock.  Swollen eyes combined with wheezing is a very bad sign. While it is true that respiratory sounds on their own can sometimes be indicative of environmental issues like an unclean bedding situation or something similar, swollen eyes are usually a clear sign of a Respiratory Disease.  Can you give any more detail on how his eyes look? Any bubbles in the eyes? Are the eyes affected at all or are you speaking of the skin around the eyes/eyelids? Are his comb/wattles/facial tissue swollen as well? I suggest you post pictures ASAP.  Are you sure he's wheezing? Would it possibly be better described as coughing, gurgling, rattling, etc.? (It's a small difference but can be very important in diagnosing such issues).  In the meantime, quarantine him as soon as possible. Keep him in a cage or kennel somewhere far away from the coop (inside a house/garage where it is warm is ideal, as cold makes respiratory diseases much worse). Once you've been in contact with him, absolutely do not touch the rest of the flock without sanitizing yourself first. Many Respiratory Diseases are very, very contagious.  You can give him Sav-A-Chick electrolytes for now, if you wish. Vitamin supplements and a high-protein feed (ask your feed dealer if they have non-medicated or organic chick-starter, or molting feed) can also help him feel better. Proper medication isn't really feasible until you know which respiratory disease he may or may not have, although if he really goes down hill you could give him some Tylan or Gallimycin in case he does have one of the particular diseases they are designed to treat.  I don't mean to alarm you, and I certainly don't mean to sound as if he DEFINITELY has a respiratory disease and the whole flock is going to die and the end of days has come and hellfire is going to rain down upon us all. But respiratory diseases are something to be handled with extreme caution. I have dealt with them myself and it is not a pleasant ordeal. Best of luck."
BackYardChickens,35puox,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed May 13 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am speaking of the red skin around the eyes and the ""cheeks"" being puffy. It is definitely a wheeze, it is not a mucousy sound at all. It's almost an asthmatic sound. Do chickens get allergies???  It's been three or four days and he has not gotten any worse or any better. I guess it is time to see a vet."
BackYardChickens,35puox,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu May 14 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"Chickens do not get allergies.  That sounds very, very bad. When you do go to see a vet, make sure to ask them for a blood test. And if you can, get a vet that specializes in birds. Many regular vets are pretty clueless about poultry and their diseases. In the meantime, if any of your other birds die, try to find out if there are any places in your state willing to do a free or cheap necropsy. I live in CA, and U.C. Davis does free necropsies on livestock so they have fresh bodies for their students to mess around with."

BackYardChickens,35pqbl,frugalNOTcheap,2,Tue May 12 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"I have a ""nipple bucket"" waterer and also made the rain-proof bucket feeder. Best two things I have ever done.  They only cost me a few bucks for the PVC elbows for the feeder, and the nipples for the waterer. In total, like $15, and they don't need refilling but every three days or so."

BackYardChickens,35pqbl,high6ix,1 point,Tue May 12 14:57:16 2015 UTC,Bought elbows and nipples to add to the buckets.
BackYardChickens,35pqbl,OtisB,2,Tue May 12 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"Adult chickens can easily eat out of just about anything. You risk them crapping in it if it's a handy place to perch, though. But that said, a gravity feeder could be made easily out of plywood and some 2x2s or something similar.   Waterting is more complicated, but for me I have an old 5 gallon bucket that I cut off to a height of about  5 inches. I fill that once a day when I'm out in the garden. During winter, I use a large steel commercial waterer on a heated base. I have also used heated dog dishes with some success as well, but it has to be rinsed out every couple days as it will get crapped in."
BackYardChickens,35pqbl,GallusLafayetti,2,Wed May 13 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"If your birds are standard sized (or agile enough to jump onto the lip), you can use simple 5-gallon buckets for water. Be sure they are filled to the very top every morning, so they can reach the water easily. You could also buy a nipple kit and make nipple waterers, which I hear keep the coop/run very clean. (Although I'm not fond of them because it's a rather unnatural way for them to drink, and because studies show nipple-watered chickens drink less water on average than those who can scoop the water up with their beaks.)  I can't say I have any advice regarding feeders. Because chickens can be prone to feed-wasting, I prefer to buy the feeders specially made for the purpose, as I believe it saves money in the long run. Of course, with only 6 hens, I don't imagine there's a lot of waste, so it may well be cheaper to make your own. Perhaps look into a treadle feeder? I saw a fantastic one at a fair once, and I'm sure there's design plans for them floating around on the internet. It keeps water, dirt, and rodents out, and because it's nice and deep but the chickens can't get into it and scratch the feed out, it's an ideal design to prevent any wasting.  I'm assuming you bought the 1-quart waterer and 1-pound feeder? Yes, those will need to be switched out soon. Ideal sizes would be a 5 gallon or larger waterer and maybe a 10-12 pound feeder."
BackYardChickens,35pqbl,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed May 13 20:09:15 2015 UTC,How often do you have to refill the 5 gallon waterer and 10 lb feeder?  I have to refill their water everyday. I can go almost 2 days on the feeder. I usally do it every day for peace of mind. They've been getting out in their run and eating grass/foraging so I assume that is supplementing their feed.
BackYardChickens,35pqbl,GallusLafayetti,2,Thu May 14 02:33:24 2015 UTC,"Ha, I have over 100 fowl in my personal flock, so I have two 40 lb. feeders and several waterers that amount to about 50 gallons, which have to be cleaned and refilled daily. Not quite the same.  However, I do have to clean/refill waterers/feeders of those sizes at work. I'd say the resident flock of seven large birds goes through a full 11 pound feeder within five days - one week, and they have acces to a couple of 1 and 2 gallon waterers and a five gallon waterer, which all need to be cleaned every 3 days or so. (could probably last 5 in the winter when they don't get quite so icky). With small flocks, it's usually not so much a matter of needing more water as it is how often to dump the old stuff so it doesn't get nasty."
BackYardChickens,35pqbl,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu May 14 02:41:40 2015 UTC,I was just thinking my 6 birds probably wont drink 5 gallons of water per day. Since Im going to clean it every day I might as well get them a smaller one.

BackYardChickens,35ky1j,millipixel,6,Mon May 11 10:09:03 2015 UTC,"You should remove them. Chicken eggs hatch a week faster than duck eggs so you'll risk mother duck abandoning her other eggs when the chicks hatch.  Also if you have a pond/open water source you don't want mother duck to lead the chicks into it, they will drown.  On the flip side, I've often heard or people using a clucky hen to hatch a batch of duck eggs without issue."

BackYardChickens,35jvbv,atodaso,6,Mon May 11 01:52:00 2015 UTC,This seems like a good place to ask a question I've been wondering about for a while...  Can you eat any breed of chicken's eggs?  Or rather most breeds' eggs?  Are there specific breeds that lay the eggs we normally buy at the store?  Are there some breeds that lay eggs you shouldn't eat?  Do the eggs of different breeds have different tastes?   I don't have chickens but hope to have them someday.
BackYardChickens,35jvbv,sabrefudge,5,Mon May 11 03:46:59 2015 UTC,"There is really very little difference in the taste or quality of eggs from any breeds I know of, or that you're likely to run into. I'm hesitant to make a blanket statement that they're all equally good, as this is reddit, and someone would be sure to dig up some edge case insisting otherwise, but yeah, you can eat any chicken eggs and they'll be OK. Flavour is much more influenced by the hen's diet than her breeding.  Three main factors are at play when it comes to breeds of chickens for laying eggs. One is frequency of laying, the second is the size of the eggs. Bantams and silkies lay smaller eggs as a rule, and often don't lay quite every day. Many meat breeds tend to lay every other day. Many layer breeds will give you an egg every single day if they're not in moult, and getting enough light (not the shortest days in winter, without supplementary lighting). The third consideration is how long a hen will produce, but that isn't a big concern for backyard flocks, as you can (and will probably want to) either breed or acquire more hens as you go.  A few breeds need a bit of special care, but for the most part if you just want a backyard flock that produces enough eggs for your family, you can get any breed you like and you'll have plenty of eggs. This lets you select among ""luxuries"" like their appearance and temperament, things commercial producers can't afford to enjoy in the same way."
BackYardChickens,35jvbv,on_a_moose,2,Mon May 11 09:46:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reply!
BackYardChickens,35jvbv,sabrefudge,2,Mon May 11 09:53:13 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, you can eat any breed's eggs.  The eggs that you buy in the store are most likely from a Rhode Island Red crosses. The eggs that our girls lay taste the same regardless of colour.  The diet of the layers makes a big difference in their egg's taste. I find that in the summer, when they are outside foraging and grazing, their yolks are a brighter yellow and have a richer taste to them.    You should get chickens at some pt, they are easy to keep and are awesome.  Just have a plan for them when they stop laying in ~ 2 2 1/2 yrs."
BackYardChickens,35jvbv,PeacefulTreeLand,1 point,Mon May 11 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, here is my follow up stupid question.  Do most chickens stop laying eggs after 2-2.5 years?

BackYardChickens,35jvbv,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon May 11 23:59:28 2015 UTC,"they taper off with laying. right now my girls are producing ~ 5 eggs/week.  By ~24 months of age, they will really drop off in production 1-2 eggs/week and then stop.  We raise our own meat birds as well. We usually process them around 8-10 weeks of age, depending on how much room we have in the freezer, and how big we want them."

BackYardChickens,35i6uz,on_a_moose,2,Mon May 11 09:53:06 2015 UTC,"She's a champ layer in the spring and summer but the second the days get shorter, she stops laying.  Of all my hens, (even my other silkies) her laying cycle is the most photosensitive to change.   Her largest eggs are ~avg medium size store egg."
BackYardChickens,35j3ei,Theantleredfish,5,Sun May 10 21:37:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm, sounds like it could be a head injury causing a balance issue. The wetness on her beard is probably water, which would support such a theory, as with no sense of balance she could easily get her beard wet while attempting to drink. Head injuries will either go away on their own or lead to death.  Other than that, it's odd that she isn't laying. She could be egg bound. The standard treatment for binding is a warm soak in a bathtub or sink and hoping is works.  Have you done a complete physical exam yet? Check for any wounds, abnormal lumps or bumps, swollen areas, etc. Remember to check under the wings, feel the crop, and check the abdomen and belly for any odd protrusions.  In the meantime, I highly suggest you cage her, somewhere quiet and somewhat dark. A dog crate, large rodent cage, or even sturdy cardboard box will work. You can buy Sav-A-Chick electrolytes and probiotics at most feed stores. Go ahead and mix some up if you can and if she won't drink on her own, you can dip your finger in the mixture and put drops of it on the corner of her beak.  Can you post a picture of her stool? It can be important in diagnosing some diseases."
BackYardChickens,35j3ei,GallusLafayetti,3,Mon May 11 00:36:28 2015 UTC,I would bring her to the veterinarian in case it is worms or something that antibiotics do not address.

BackYardChickens,35i3op,MrMatthewJ,3,Sun May 10 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"I'm near Seattle as well. The weather is plenty warm enough to have 8-week-old chickens outside. You don't need to make any special arrangements for them in winter, either. Chickens can do well in temps much lower than what we get here.  They're also old enough to move on from open containers of water to an adult waterer with nipples. I made ours by putting a few of those in the bottom of a 5 gallon bucket and hanging it up---super easy and inexpensive. Until you get their adult waterer figured out, all you can do with the current one is sit it up on something like a block of wood. They'll still get shavings in there, but it will help."
BackYardChickens,35i3op,poorsoi,2,Sun May 10 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"You can use chicken nipples for day olds. My very first hatchling, not 2 minutes out of the incubator and into the brooder had already figured out how to drink from the nipple. For chicks, I'll use a 32-64 oz juice bottle. Drill a hole in the cap, shove a nipple in there, put a hole in the bottom so the water can flow easily, hang it in their brooder, somewhere they can get to it."
BackYardChickens,35i3op,kayakyakr,1 point,Sun May 10 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely do this if we raise chicks again. They make such a mess of their watering dishes, and nipples have no risk of drowning."
BackYardChickens,35i3op,poorsoi,1 point,Sun May 10 21:13:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip on the adult waterer! Seems reverse compared to mammals. :P
BackYardChickens,35i3op,SchipAlong,2,Sun May 10 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"I'm in B.C. so similar climate. At eight weeks they should be fine to go outside. I have a small heat lamp for my bantam babies outside right now, but they're only 4.5 weeks and the plan is to phase the lamp out by 6 weeks. Their first few nights out are always a little nerve wracking though.  Dampness will kill a chicken before cold, so while it sounds counterproductive having plenty of ventilation is the key to keeping chickens comfortable. Just make sure cold air isn't being blown directly on the roost area and they should be fine. In my coop I have the roost split between a window and the wall so in the winter they can sleep in the sheltered area and in the summer they can get a nice breeze if they want. My boss hen sleeps right in front of the window so she can keep an eye on everything.  For feeders/waterers it definitely helps to raise them up off the floor. Either by hanging then from the ceiling of the coop/run or placing them up on concrete blocks. If you place them on blocks, you can set the height for their adult size then put a large flat rock in front as a stepping stool until they are full grown and can easily reach the food and water on their own. Saves on having to buy lots of concrete blocks."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,dontforgetthelube,10,Sun May 10 13:12:54 2015 UTC,Yes.
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,PissOnEddieShore,7,Sun May 10 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"In my experience, if you try to teach a chicken not to go somewhere, they will go behind your back and poop on it."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,cordial_carbonara,2,Sun May 10 16:53:19 2015 UTC,It does seem like they know where you don't want them to go and they try extra hard to go there. We have a patio that has a gate and if I leave the gate open for any amount of time I'll come back to them pooping all over the patio. Once I left the patio gate and door (to the house) open and came back to two chickens in the house (thankfully caught them before they pooped)  By nature they like to explore so if they have access they'll go for it. No way to teach them delayed gratification.
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,shoutpy,1 point,Mon May 11 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"Nope, they aren't capable of learning that, you'll have to use chicken wire."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,shoutpy,2,Mon May 11 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"They are capable of learning that, I have two indoor chickens. The hand raised rooster is better at remembering to stay off things than the rescued hen is. The rooster doesn't jump on the tables, shelves or computers EVER. The hen is usually good about it, but if she gets excited and the thing she's not suppose to get on is in the way she will jump on it.   It takes a lot of time and consistency but eventually they learn. The rooster is 6 years old and we've had him since hatching. The hen is of an unknown age and we've had her for a little over a month."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,LadyDarkKitten,2,Mon May 11 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, How did you train him? Seems like a fool's errand to try to train chickens, but I guess I'm just the fool."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,shoutpy,2,Tue May 12 08:12:44 2015 UTC,"Training a chicken is about consistency, persistence and time. If you have all three it can be done, mostly it comes down to working with the animals natural instincts. For example, getting them to stay off things. Training Chicken-Butt, our rooster, to stay off of things was pretty simple. Chickens learn from flock mates, since my fiance, our cat and my self were his flock and we didn't make it a habit to walk on tables any time he jumped up where he wasn't suppose to be we put him in an acceptable place. Like in a chair, on the bed, on his cage or on the floor.  He was never punished, or scolded just corrected and we've taken to doing the same with Princess. With Chicken-Butt as a good chicken example she's learning very quickly.   Chicken-Butt has a pretty big vocabulary, some of them are commands.   Step up.   Up you go, for when we want him to jump on things.   Come on, is follow.   Go go, for when he's walking in front of me.   Chicken bed time, he heads for the cage when you say this one.   Adventure time or going on an adventure, which is when we take him somewhere; when we say this one he goes looking for his carrier.  So it is possible, it just takes time and dedication. And remember this is treat free training, you can get them to do a lot more with goodies."

BackYardChickens,35hkw3,poorsoi,2,Mon May 11 19:58:55 2015 UTC,"They wear diapers... little chicken diapers. And before you ask his tail was not damaged by putting the nappy on, he spent a lot of time out and about which meant time in the carrier and broken tail feathers."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,LadyDarkKitten,3,Mon May 11 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, you see something new every day."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,poorsoi,2,Mon May 11 22:45:32 2015 UTC,"The hen doesn't seem to care one way or the other, but she does love having her nappy changed. The rooster prefers his nappy, we spent a year trying to potty train him because I had heard that I could be done. It almost worked but cleaning up the mess every time he miscalculated was such a pain. On top of that he would get anxious and upset even though he wasn't really in trouble. So eventually I gave up and made him a nappy. Now when ever he gets a bath and the nappy gets washed he gets anxious. If I don't get it back on him in time and he poops on the floor he gets upset and starts making the warning noise. Once the poop is cleaned up and he gets the loves he's okay again but pooping on the floor really bothers him."
BackYardChickens,35hkw3,LadyDarkKitten,1 point,Mon May 11 23:41:08 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Despite whats being said chickens CAN learn to stay out of things. It takes an insane amount of time and dedication but they can learn. It's easier to teach them in smaller numbers as well, chickens seem to get smarter in larger numbers. But honestly it would be far easier to get chicken wire to keep them out of it.  I have two indoor chickens. The hand raised rooster is better at remembering to stay off/out of things than the rescued hen is. The rooster doesn't jump on the tables, shelves or computers. And he doesn't steal food, I can leave a plate on the bed next to him with food on it and he will stand there. The hen is usually good about it, but if she gets excited and the thing she's not suppose to get on is in the way she will jump on it. We can't leave her alone with food yet, but she's getting better at not begging or stealing. And she gets people food treats probably more often than she should.  It takes a lot of time and consistency but eventually they learn. The rooster is 6 years old and we've had him since hatching. The hen is of an unknown age and we've had her for a little over a month."

BackYardChickens,35f28t,up2late,5,Sun May 10 00:28:14 2015 UTC,I didn't get my nipple setup done until my chicks were about a month old.  Just take away their old water system and pick up each one and rub their beak onto the nipple so they understand water happens when I touch this.  If just one chicken figures it out the rest will see them hitting the metal part of the nipple and try it too.
BackYardChickens,35f28t,f34rinc,3,Sun May 10 03:34:54 2015 UTC,I just tried them with three year olds on a five gallon bucket and they couldn't figure it out. I'm guessing you need to start young. Maybe the babies can teach the elders.

BackYardChickens,35ffdz,anorex,3,Sat May 9 20:52:36 2015 UTC,Do you have a separate cage or enclosure to put an individual hen in (one at a time)? I put mine in there with food and water but no comfortable spot to lay. Leave her for about a week until she lays an egg and then put her back with the rest. She has to lay to know that she is fully out of brood.  Move on and repeat with the next hen.
BackYardChickens,35ffdz,dayron422,3,Sat May 9 21:37:28 2015 UTC,"This is the method I've used too. If you let them out before they're 'broken,' they'll just make a beeline for the nest. Lock her up, throw away the key, and wait for an egg."
BackYardChickens,35ffdz,fishiepants,1 point,Sat May 9 23:46:21 2015 UTC,May have to try this as a last resort. Do you let them out at all? ( Assuming they don't have access to the coop. )

I have 7 dogs and the chicken pen is partial fenced in where the dogs are.  So, I may have to throw them all out at night. I leave the coop wide open in the summer, but since they can't see at night anyway, I doubt they'd find their way inside."

BackYardChickens,35frxl,Jackawolf,1 point,Wed May 13 02:12:16 2015 UTC,Great idea! How much do you sell it for?
BackYardChickens,35frxl,Jackawolf,2,Wed May 13 11:40:43 2015 UTC,"I don't sell it... I have given it in trade (plants). But if I did, I would look at what it would cost to buy manure at a local garden center. Then decide. You could get in touch with your local permaculture group and let them know for their newsletter. Also beekeeping and gardening clubs. I am thinking that where I live, I would probably get $4 per bucket or so."

Dominiques have a flat Rose comb whereas Rocks will have a Single. Lol I constantly have to check combs at my workplace to be sure I'm not accidentally selling people Barred Rock pullets instead of Doms or vice versa, because they're all in the same pen. It's basically the only difference between the damn things."
BackYardChickens,35crvu,GallusLafayetti,3,Sat May 9 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure my old girl has a single comb.  She's been with me a long time now, she was my only surviving chicken through 2 wipeouts, first being April 27th, 2010, the other two hens I had were crushed when a tree knocked my chicken coop over on top of them, the other time is when a pair of dogs ripped my chicken run apart and killed all my chickens, she somehow managed to escape and ran under a truck I had that was stuck in the mud beside my house where the dogs couldn't get under.  She's pretty much earned the right to finish her days out.  Shoulda seen her establishing pecking order on the 4 new hens, she was putting the smack down.  And here I thought she wouldn't survive this last winter, instead here she is laying eggs again and kicking ass to keep her spot as top roosting chicken in the coop."
BackYardChickens,35crvu,GallusLafayetti,3,Sat May 9 08:26:26 2015 UTC,"Ha. No kidding. Sounds like a tough old girl. Reminds me of my old Dominique, Lieutenant.

BackYardChickens,35c6vu,69Ghostfarts,22,Fri May 8 22:18:37 2015 UTC,Close them inside the coop and keep them there all day for a few days.

You can try spraying wasp spray in a cup and brushing the liquid on places they are trying to build a nest. Do it at night though. When they settle down. It shouldn't hurt the chickens since you are putting it up in the rafters where they don't go. You can also try spraying with permethrin. That is safe for birds and will also get rid of any mites or critters that want to get on the birds."

BackYardChickens,35chw5,SharpStiletto,3,Sat May 9 00:01:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, such interesting birds. I always love learning of new breeds, unfortunately there are so many small regions of the world where breeds are created and remain as a local, isolated type not seen anywhere else in the world, that it's impossible to truly know all of them. Is the blue one the ""Andaluza Surena""? Do they have any relation to the Andalusian breed seen in North America?  Which type is the buff/white one?"
BackYardChickens,35chw5,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat May 9 06:07:56 2015 UTC,"The one at the back, ""partridge"" colour they call it here, is the Andaluza Sureña. The ""golden"" one you call ""buff"" is the Euskal Oiloa and the blue is Extremeña. Apparently the Euskal Oiloa is an intelligent and friendly breed, I found some US websites and there are some Stateside.  I've read the the Andalusian was imported and shown in Britain around 1850; perhaps the ones in America arrived through there? There are several breeds of ""Andalusian"" chickens in Spain and the above-mentioned (mostly blue) is just one of them. Here's a website in Spanish that lists different breeds that gives some info, you can scan through it - it has pictures! [Edited to add link]  I'm new to chickens so I don't know much beyond my reading and asking around, but I'm on a learning curve and hopefully meeting an acquaintance this week who knows all about local chickens, so I'm looking forward to that.  I felt it would be a good idea to go for indigenous or somewhat ""local"" birds especially as I'd like to free range and all three breeds are very ""rustic"" and suitable for that. I thought /r/backyardchickens might be interested in seeing something a little different! :~)"
BackYardChickens,35b94j,clamdragon,2,Fri May 8 17:41:30 2015 UTC,Can you give them a bucket of weeds or something to keep them occupied?  I know 5 gallons of weeds/grass/some scratch grains keeps my hens scratching around and content for quite some time.

BackYardChickens,35b94j,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sun May 10 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"For now, buy some Pick-No-More lotion and slather it all over the area. Cage her until the scabs go away or they'll just make it worse. If that doesn't work, buy some pinless peepers. If it continues after that, you'll probably have to rehome the offending hens."
BackYardChickens,35aq7c,LegacyJared,6,Fri May 8 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't risk it. Too low of humidity during hatching and your chicks will literally get shrink wrapped to their shells. The membrane sticks to them like dried glue and causes all sorts of problems. Raising the humidity once it has happened doesn't help either. The only way to get it off of them is to peel them out of their shell and peel the dried stuff off. It is a mess and turns a hatch into a disaster. I would raise the humidity to 70-80% during hatching.  Contrary to popular belief, lots of humidity during the last 3 days will not drown your chicks. The only way they can drown is if humidity was too high during the entire incubation process and their air cells did not get large enough for them to pip into it without drowning in the fluid surrounding it. You can compare your eggs to this image to see if their air cells match what they are supposed to be."
BackYardChickens,35aq7c,absinthy,1 point,Fri May 8 16:24:13 2015 UTC,Thank you for the information. I have a few eggs that are 5 days and 8 days apart in the same incubator when i raise the humidity will that effect the eggs that aren't ready for the humidity chances? They are all at least 10 days old. Any suggestions?
BackYardChickens,35aq7c,absinthy,2,Fri May 8 16:48:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, that does present a problem. Staggered hatches in a single incubator are not easy and IMO should be attempted by only experienced hatchers.  Most people who do a staggered hatch like that have a separate incubator (which they call a ""hatcher"") in which they place the ready-to-hatch eggs inside of to hatch. That way they can raise the humidity inside of the hatcher for the ready-to-hatch eggs and not affect the eggs that are in the main incubator. I think that this would be your best bet if you want to continue to do staggered hatches. You can find a foam incubator without a turner for less than $50 and I have seen some used ones on Craigslist go for as low as $25.  If you want to try to hatch them out in a single incubator, I would incubate them all normally up until the first batch is due to go into lockdown. During incubation, you should be adjusting the humidity according to the air cell size shown on the picture I linked (Air cell too big = not enough humidity, add water. Air cell too small = too much humidity, remove water) and then raise the humidity to 70%ish when the first batch goes into lockdown. As soon as the last chick hatches from that first batch IMMEDIATELY take all of the water out of the incubator and leave the incubator dry over the next 2-3 days to make up for the excess humidity that they had the 3 days prior. Then you can re-add water if you need to in order to bring the humidity back up to what you had it before."
BackYardChickens,35aq7c,absinthy,1 point,Fri May 8 17:34:19 2015 UTC,Your so helpful thank you. Im definitely wanting to continue the hatching. I'm going to go to get a second incubator.

BackYardChickens,35aq7c,ruby_saffron,1 point,Mon May 11 20:16:16 2015 UTC,Ok do you normally leave your humidity the same during the 21 days? Im new at this. Hatch day is tomarrow.
BackYardChickens,359zov,cluckingaround,8,Fri May 8 10:29:08 2015 UTC,They will most likely follow each other into one coop. Whichever one is their favourite.  If they are free ranging during the day I wouldn't worry too much about room at night.
BackYardChickens,359zov,nicecoldbeer,5,Fri May 8 11:30:30 2015 UTC,If they are free ranging during the day I wouldn't worry too much about room at night.   Meaning the whole 4sqft per bird rule is not as important for free ranged birds?
BackYardChickens,359zov,braverbeverages,6,Fri May 8 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, 2sq ft. per bird is ample if they just sleep in there, while 4sqft. if they're not let out doesnt seem like enough in my opinion."
BackYardChickens,359zov,braverbeverages,1 point,Fri May 8 14:25:38 2015 UTC,Oh interesting. In that case I may be able to get away with just my current coop in progress for a little longer than I expected. Current coop is about 14sqft. I was thinking I would be pushing it trying to keep 4 birds but going by your rule I may be able to keep the 6 I had initially set my mind on. Thanks again.
BackYardChickens,359zov,flockofpterodactyls,3,Fri May 8 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"Another thing rarely mentioned is the ""cubic feet"" aspect of it. I mean, my coop is 32sq on the floor, but with the roosting bars up above it's technically a 2 story dwelling, most of the ladies are on the roosts whenever they're in there so that 32sq is fully open for them to move around. Now that I think about it I might as well get another 16 hens, no??"
BackYardChickens,359zov,flockofpterodactyls,2,Fri May 8 16:28:23 2015 UTC,Even better news (glad I asked here) ... the coop I am working on is pretty tall and will have virtually the same benefits you are talking about with floor space + roosting bars to utilize the upper part of the coop. So now I am feeling much better about the size of the flock I am planning.
BackYardChickens,359zov,BareFootMumma,3,Fri May 8 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"We have four different groups/coops and free range during the day most of the time. They divided themselves on their based on the flock they were raised with. After they've been with their flock awhile, it's almost impossible to separate them, especially if they're all mingling together. For example, my one year old and 4 month old groups will go in the same coop together sometimes, but they don't sleep in the same area and will hang out in different places during the day."
BackYardChickens,359zov,Grimsterr,1 point,Fri May 8 13:29:55 2015 UTC,Thank you. This makes me feel better about the situation. I plan to only have 4-6 birds at first but may grow the flock and would hate to scrap the current coop when I could just build a duplicate.
BackYardChickens,359zov,Grimsterr,1 point,Fri May 8 13:35:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that won't be a problem at all! Just be aware of who you want to keep together if you plan to breed them at any point. I've had some flocks that won't accept ""new members."""
BackYardChickens,359zov,kayakyakr,1 point,Fri May 8 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"For now there is no plan to breed, only egg production. However in the future if I do plan to breed it will likely only be the one breed I keep."
BackYardChickens,359zov,BananikaND,2,Fri May 8 13:46:40 2015 UTC,"I have accidentally ended up with multiple houses in one run and it's been fine.  In the past I've integrated young girls by free-ranging both groups together and leaving both houses open so they can choose which one they go to at night. It never took long for the young girls to move themselves from the small grower house into the much more comfortable big house with the older girls.    This year they just wouldn't do it. After months of letting everyone freerange in the garden together (and everyone getting along) no one had transitioned. Out of frustration (and to save my garden) I disconnected the small house from it's run and dumped it in the middle of the big girls run and shut the gate. Now everyone shares the run and at night the old girls go to the big house and the young girls still go to the little house. Everyone seems to get along fine which is impressive since I've got a real mixed bag (14 girls including everything from big laying breeds to bantams, polish and frizzles and a bantam rooster)"
BackYardChickens,359k1k,ReverendEarthwormJim,6,Fri May 8 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"Just going to paste the advice I posted there:  If I were you I'd build/start building the coop before getting the chicks!! I hatched 6 earlier this spring and 8 weeks (the max size they should be moved out of a brooder into a coop) was barely enough time to build a 8' x 8' x 5' coop with walk in run! That's cutting, painting, drilling and stapling for 9ish weeks on our free time.  It may sound really big of a project but you and your chickens will really, really appreciate it. I've learned a lot from trial and error! I've bought a pre-made coop which are way too small and cheaply made for even one regular sized chicken! I've gerry rigged an 8' x 8' x 4' run without painting it which gets weather worn fast and I'm going to have to replace it soon! That and I have to crouch everytime I go inside which is a pain!  This is the current coop we built before we put the roofing material on. I barely have to do much other than dumping out their waterer and cleaning the coop poops everyday.   Edit: Also hanging feeders and waterer are easier to deal with. The ones that sit on the ground waste sooo much food and water! Babies hanging out in their new home!"

BackYardChickens,359k1k,YotaIamYourDriver,2,Sat May 9 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Great idea.  Couple of repeat questions and advice that come up...   Hardware cloth, not chicken wire. BURY the hardware cloth. No, your adult chickens do not need a heat lamp. But do be sure to post pics after your coop burns down.  Yes, your chickens need 24/7 access to fresh water. Broodiness is natural. Want chicks? Give her something to set on. Want to break her? Isolation and cool temps. Chickens naturally scuffle with one another, but if you see blood you MUST separate them. The term ""blood in the water"" does not just apply to sharks. It the coop smells bad then, yes, it probably does need to be cleaned. Free eggs are a wonderful way to meet new friends and keep neighbors happy. Dog-proof coon traps are wonderful inventions. So are .22's, but check your local ordinances first."

We recently planted our garden and have had to coop the chickens for a while until the plants are big enough. The coop is large and has an attached 40 foot run, but since not letting them free range our egg production has gone slightly down. Any thoughts on why that might be? And how to bring it back up again.   Since cooping them up, we have been giving them 16% protein pellets and 16% protein scratch in between filling the trough. Also mixing in oyster shell and Omega Egg Maker with the pellets."
BackYardChickens,359k1k,YotaIamYourDriver,1 point,Fri May 8 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, when it comes to plants, there is no ""big enough"", unless maybe you're talking actual trees. Chickens will destroy anything green. Either from eating it or from digging up the roots. You may want to rethink allowing them to range in your garden, if you actually want to get anything out of it.  Where are you getting 16% scratch? I'm only aware of one company that makes a scratch that can also be used a complete 16% chicken/turkey feed if ground, but it's not something you'd see sold in the average feed store. What brand is it?  When you say 40 foot, do you mean 40 square feet or 40ft. long/wide?"
BackYardChickens,359k1k,aimlessego,1 point,Sat May 9 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"40 feet long by 4 feet wide. This was the addition, they still have the coop and a smaller 12 foot by 3 foot run.  You are also right on the scratch. The pellets are 16% and the scratch is 9%. Also as an aside production seems to have picked back up again."
BackYardChickens,359emg,chingchongtong,4,Fri May 8 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"Suggest you keep your chicks on sand to avoid risk of choking on shavings. They can upgrade to shavings a few weeks later when they have a few more functioning brain cells and recognize food.  Chicks need a different environment, called a brooder. You will also need a heat lamp and thermometer. They need external 90 degrees when tiny and can be backed down as they grow.  Check the sidebar for coop plans. You will want a ""small"" one.  Coop should be 4 sf/bird (6 hens = 24 sq ft floor space). Roost should be a 2x4 on its side so they have a place to sit. (Important in cold weather). Coop should have good ventilation, but no place where the wind blows right on a chicken. No insulation (except maybe for near-polar conditions). No electricity. No heater. They are self-insulated and warm-blooded.  Suggest that you provide nest boxes you can access from outside. You will appreciate this when you are in a hurry.  Coop should be enclosed so predators with clever fingers or brute strength cannot get in. DO NOT USE CHICKEN WIRE. Hardware cloth is what you need.  The chicken run should be 10 sf per bird (6 hens = 60 sq ft). Good drainage is important. Nobody wants to walk in wet poo. Some people make small runs entirely fenced with hardware cloth. Some people make bigger runs and use 2x4 farm fence (maybe with a skirt of chicken wire to discourage rubbernecking or hardware cloth if raccoons are common).  The top should be covered. Some put in a roof over hardware cloth, some have partial shade, some use farm fence, and some use bird netting.  Check out the sidebar Learning Center. You also need to work out how you will maintain the coop and run. If it is big enough, you can walk in and maybe use the deep litter method in the coop. For smaller coops, you may just need an access door and a kitty litter scoop or similar small tool.  Seriously consider a compost heap/bin. You will need to dispose of chicken poop and it makes good fertilizer after decomposition has cooked the bacteria.  Buff orpingtons, red stars, and black stars all lay brown eggs. ""Easter eggers"" lay green eggs. True americaunas lay blue eggs. (Anyone who tries to sell you one that lays green eggs is passing off an easter egger, which is fine if the price is the same and you are not breeding). There are some other breeds that lay speckled eggs, and of course there is the white leghorn which produces white eggs for your grocery store. You can find more breed info on BackYardChickens.com and hatchery web sites.  The Chicken Lytle blog has a lot of stupid stuff, but covers the basics of having a first flock."
BackYardChickens,359emg,ReverendEarthwormJim,2,Fri May 8 06:22:07 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for all the information! Couple of questions: you suggest I keep them on sand, but the feed store I plan to get them from have them on shavings, should I just keep them on this or would it be better to change em off?  What is rubber necking?  Why is chicken wire not used? Thanks again for all the information. I have quite a bit to go before getting chickens! Haha."
BackYardChickens,359emg,Grimsterr,2,Fri May 8 06:38:34 2015 UTC,"He forgot the Marans (my breed of choice) who lay -dark- brown (chocolate looking) eggs.  If you want colorful, get a Leghorn (white), a Maran (DARK brown), an Easter Egger (green), a full Americauna (blue), and any of the number of brown egg layers, I prefer ""Domineckers"" (Dominques) for this.  This should pretty much cover the majority spectrum of chicken eggs.  If you can have a rooster, I'd probably go with a full Americauna or full Maran and only hatch out pure blooded of that breed, not being elitist they're simply worth more if you sell the hatchlings, a full Maran hatchling easily fetches $8, a barnyard ""mix"" will fetch maybe $2.  My single Maran hen has already netted me $45 so far this year alone, and that was selling 5 hatchlings for $8 and 3 eggs for $5, I have 21 more of her eggs in the incubator right now, 6 hatching today, the rest in 2 weeks."

BackYardChickens,359emg,ReverendEarthwormJim,1 point,Fri May 8 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"Sand gets everywhere if you are using a box instead of a tub. I should have mentioned that.  Rubber necking is when chickens stick their heads out to eat things outside the run. Good way for them to get killed by predators.  Chicken wire is only slightly stronger than a spider web. It will constrain the movement of a chicken, but a dog, raccoon, fox, weasel, or whatever, will tear right through.  There is so much to learn! But very little you need to know to get started. Plus you know somebody who has been successful enough to inspire you."

I don't think there are any predators in my area, however if rather build soemthing to last! :P I may go to the feed store and pick up a few chicks in a couple of days, probably around 4 or so..

I hatched 6 earlier this spring and 8 weeks (the max size they should be moved out of a brooder into a coop) was barely enough time to build a 8' x 8' x 5' coop with walk in run! That's cutting, painting, drilling and stapling for 9ish weeks on our free time.  It may sound really big of a project but you and your chickens will really, really appreciate it. I've learned a lot from trial and error! I've bought a pre-made coop which are way too small and cheaply made for even one regular sized chicken! I've gerry rigged an 8' x 8' x 4'run without painting it which gets weather worn fast and I'm going to have to replace it soon! That and I have to crouch everytime I go inside which is a pain!  This is the current coop we built before we put the roofing material on. I barely have to do much other than dumping out their waterer and cleaning the coop poops everyday."

BackYardChickens,359emg,ErinWithaQ,1 point,Fri May 8 17:17:27 2015 UTC,You may need to put in multiple roosts across or one lengthwise. Try to get them high enough that their tails and feet are not in the mud.  You can try experimenting with stacked boards on the lawn to see the minimum height.

BackYardChickens,359emg,heathenyak,1 point,Sun May 10 00:41:32 2015 UTC,A chicken tractor should have hardware cloth due to the limited space for hiding chickens.

We ordered pullets and they very quickly got too big to stay in the house. I had to bang together a coop and run over a weekend and it has been iffy. I'm currently building a new coop and run.

Also some raccoons, snakes, etc. might have no problems getting into something like this.

They're part-hound, and have caught numerous birds and rabbits throughout the years, and almost savaged a cat, once. That said, they were pretty old when we got our chickens, and they were never particularly hyper, anyway. You need to supervise, and allow them to get used to one another through the chicken-wire, first. Then, allow the chickens to walk around and keep the dog leashed. Correct any aggressive or hyper behaviour. Do this a couple times, and try him without the leash, with you supervising.

BackYardChickens,352z29,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Wed May 6 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"Cochins & leghorns tend to get their combs pretty early. And silkies are just a bitch.  But yes, hens shouldn't have a developed comb until they're near laying."
BackYardChickens,352z29,kayakyakr,1 point,Thu May 7 05:29:19 2015 UTC,"No, you don't. At 7 weeks old you cannot tell a roo from a hen based on their feathering, they don't get their rooster feathering until earlier.  Sure, they can get it at 7 weeks but it's pretty unlikely. Going off the comb is the most reliable at this age and it says rooster. If you go off hackle & saddle feathers at 7 weeks you're going to think 90% are hens when they're just normal developing roosters."
BackYardChickens,352z29,Aerron,1 point,Thu May 7 05:27:38 2015 UTC,"It was a general comment for sexing birds. At that age, my biggest indicator is usually their carriage anyway (roosters are taller, more upright)."

BackYardChickens,3542s0,mrkelley1,1 point,Wed May 6 22:53:41 2015 UTC,"What I noticed with our rooster was that he had a favorite hen and she seemed well worn much of the time with lots of lost feathers and some minor injuries. Once we increased our flock, I think it gave the rooster more ladies to service and so she didn't get ridden as much. If you've got the room and don't mind a few more hens, that may help.  I've never cut the spurs on a rooster, so maybe others can give you advice on that."
BackYardChickens,3542s0,loveshercoffee,1 point,Thu May 7 03:06:25 2015 UTC,"I've got 9 hens and one big shiny barred rock x dark cornish cross rooster. Not a single one of my hens has full feathers on her back. He's big (about 8-9 pounds) and loud and rough. We keep him because we hatch our own eggs to raise meat birds and he's very efficient. Last 2 dozen that went into the incubator were 100% fertile and this is the norm.  That said, I watch the hens and if I see blood, I isolate that hen for a while to heal.   Hens are a lot tougher than you might think. I once had a hen get completely scalped in a fight with something. The skin was pulled from the middle of the top of her skull about 3 inches down the back of her neck. I cleaned the wound and kept it clean, and she has completely healed, with the exception that no feathers grow on some parts of the healed wound. I inherited another hen (mutt easter egger) that had been beat really badly by a rooster, there was no skin left on her back in an area about 3 inches by 4 inches. All bones and muscles were clearly exposed. I cleaned her up and isolated her for 6 weeks and she made a full recovery and is now laying a little green egg every day. Chickens are tough, man.   The breed of rooster is going to have something to do with this, but generally the only recourse you have is to deal with it, get more hens, or put him in the stew pot and get a different rooster from a less aggressive breed. Some breeds are known to be hard on hens, some are known to not be.  I know nothing at all about removing spurs."

BackYardChickens,3538ku,Moral_Gutpunch,3,Wed May 6 19:03:10 2015 UTC,"I tried just scraps and range and notices a significant - maybe 30-50% drop in egg production. They were fine health-wise but if you want eggs, keep them full"
BackYardChickens,3538ku,sweintraub,3,Wed May 6 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"you should always have layer feed (pellet or granule) fresh, dry and available at all times, can be up to 100% of diet.  Letting them forage for plants and bugs, and giving table scraps can be part of a daily diet, but their primary food should be the feed.  Only give cracked grains (scratch) as a treat, a handful at most. These corn and wheat grains are carby, empty calories, junk food basically, and should be given sparingly if you want egg production or it's warm out."
BackYardChickens,3538ku,Mycd,1 point,Wed May 6 21:39:16 2015 UTC,What is layer feed made of? Can I make it or something similar?
BackYardChickens,3538ku,Mycd,3,Wed May 6 22:08:03 2015 UTC,"you can make it yourself, for sure. The Protein and Calcium levels are the most important nutrients for egg production to get right. All layer feed is basically the same but some are fancier. Generally a few basic grain types for filler (corn, wheat, barley, oats), then soy or mealworm protein, fish or bone meal, oystershell, lentils, millet, flaxseed, kelp, limestone, and so on.  You're looking for around 16% protien and 3% calcium for optimal for egg production (there's also 'broiler feed', starter feed, and other formulations with different nutrition ratios)  You can find plenty of recipes online, but honestlycan be grabbed at a farm store for as low as $10 for a 50lb bag, and will help assure daily egg production. There's tons of brands out there, I've found some to be more dusty or whatever, and organic is generally a better quality, but they all work. http://www.tractorsupply.com/en/store/searchterm/layer%20feed  edit: here's a basic ingredient and nutritional list for a  couple higher end (and non-corn non-soy) feeds: http://www.scratchandpeck.com/wp-content/uploads/Soy-Free-Layer-20-25b.jpg http://cdn.backyardchickens.com/f/fb/fb547888_2013-02-1911.26.01.jpeg"
BackYardChickens,3538ku,Mycd,0,Wed May 6 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"16% protien and 3% calcium  Sounds like what we intend to give them (they aren't laying yet; once they do, we're going to give them a lot more calcium like eggshells, bones, and crustacean shells, and mollusk shells).  We're growing corn and cover crops for them, but I'm wondering if they need a much larger amount than a handful or two that every day (per three chickens)."
BackYardChickens,3538ku,Mycd,0,Thu May 7 00:11:27 2015 UTC,"a bag of layer feed will last you a couple months, and they will eat it as needed. Remember that these are domesticated animals, they thrive when we provide what they need; dry shelter, formulated feed, protection from many predators, etc.   If you provide a decent layer feed always available they will stay healthy and productive"
BackYardChickens,3538ku,Mycd,0,Thu May 7 00:51:31 2015 UTC,"I've heard vets recommend fresher homemade food, so long as it has the right nutrient balance for most pets, actually."
BackYardChickens,3538ku,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Thu May 7 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"if it's worth your time, interest, an money for ingredients, by all means.  I've raised hens for years, and keeping a hopper full of generic layer feed is super low maintenance, consistent, cheap, the hens gobble it up happily, and provide reliable daily eggs. This is supplemented by hours of free ranging, table scraps, and treats like scratch and mealworms."
BackYardChickens,3538ku,Zebba_Odirnapal,0,Thu May 7 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get it once I get more hens, but I want to vary their diet and provide as much as I can of it myself."
BackYardChickens,3538ku,poorsoi,1 point,Thu May 7 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"you seem to be arguing with everyone in this post, or stubborn at the least.  Without a decent (store-bought) layer feed available always, you'll just end up with sicker birds, impacted crops, or infrequent egg production.  Yes hens like to be free-range, but daily consistency and specific diets are needed for good egg laying. Store-bought layer feed is formulated to provide exactly what your hens need to be happy and healthy, and will be the least chore work for you by a wide margin."

BackYardChickens,34xdr0,jrwreno,9,Tue May 5 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"The carrying them around thing works or just holding him down to show that you are dominant. Put your hand on his back like a roo would his body on a hen and sit there a bit pressing them down holding them still. I would also add that the thing OP is doing with their boot is simulating a fight for him and he's getting off on it so to speak. If one of my young roos chased me I'd chase his ass right back until I caught him, petted, and hugged him into submission. They seriously hate that.   Edited to fix words and to say that my geese at least are the same. If you ever run from them they will chase forever but if you chase them or hold them it subdues them. Would not attempt with wild geese though..."

BackYardChickens,34xdr0,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Tue May 5 10:56:32 2015 UTC,We would take our boots and get them up underneath the breast of the rooster and flip them on their backs. It will piss them off initially but eventually they get the gist and start backing off.

Only had to do it once for my guy.  Only kick him if he's flogging you and don't try and hurt him, just to give him the idea, otherwise just chase him"
BackYardChickens,34xdr0,alfavametraxis,2,Tue May 5 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"We have a rooster that chases us when we turn our backs, or bend over - basically as soon as he can't see your face/eyes.    I kick him.  I give the kids a metal rod to swing when he gets close. But right now, even if you're outside the pen, and you are at the edge of the fence, and start walking away, he'll run up at you, as if to scare you away.  I'm going to pop his neck before too long, because it's not acceptable, and he will not stop. :("
BackYardChickens,34xdr0,kimberlyann0507,2,Tue May 5 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"IMHO, submission training - and shows of force do not work with roosters. Kicking a rooster, spraying a rooster and shoving it with a shovel may threaten him into submission in the short term, but they will not make the rooster more passive in the long term. Threatening a rooster will make him jumpy. I recommend holding the rooster for five minutes a day. Hold him close enough to feel your body warmth. Pet him. Sit him away from the other hens, and feed him special treats. Roosters who are aggressive are better free range roosters. They protect the flock better, and tend to fertilize a larger number of hens. They are only too aggressive in my opinion, when they pick on their hens too much. That being said - I have kids on the farm - so I don't let the rooster free range. I keep my rooster in a breeding yard with 4 of my best hens, and that rooster lives for only one reason, to make other hens. Culling roosters used to bother me, I don't like animal cruelty. But the vast majority of roosters who are ever born, are culled as soon as they are sexed. If you don't like the rooster - process him, and start fresh. Treat the new rooster like a pet, and he will hopefully be less of a jerk."
BackYardChickens,34xdr0,quack_quack_moo,2,Tue May 5 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"I've had a few aggressive roosters, all but one actually came from the same batch of chicks, and the only thing I could do was to like spread out my arms and stomp on the ground and chase them a little. It never really fixed anything, one particularly grouchy red rooster would chase kids all over my yard and charge me whenever my back was turned. They eventually all made excellent soups."
BackYardChickens,34xdr0,jones61,2,Tue May 5 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"My little rooster would try to get aggressive from time to time..  every time I went outside to do something, I would pick him up, tuck him under my arm and he would be my chore buddy.  Definitely helped mellow him out."

He will reward you with a good tasting dinner....then go out and get another rooster."
BackYardChickens,34xdr0,JodyLarrow,4,Sat May 9 21:46:25 2015 UTC,"well you have the boot portion correct, just need a bit more force. Don't punt him across the yard but reply with force so he doesn't think he's winning.    Grab some gloves and carry him around by the feet for awhile too.

BackYardChickens,34xdr0,Boshaft,1 point,Tue May 5 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"Our one and only rooster (a RIR) is extremely aggressive too.  It's always a contest.  I think twice now he has lost part of his beak when it gets caught in my boot laces while kicking.  I've kicked him over and over and he still keeps coming.  Recently, when he wants to spar, I've taken to chasing him around with a 6 ft stick.   After a couple of good smacks I can't get within 6 ft.  Each time I think he's learned his lesson I'm proven wrong.  Last time he even closed a long distance in a short time to attack me from behind.  He's got all but one or two of fourteen hens featherless on their backs.  I think like so many others we'll eat him.  I just hate to see the hens w/o any protection (lots of hawks and vultures here).  We're only about a year in with this little experiment.  For the more experienced ... do you think it may be extra testosterone in having 14 hens to himself that might be creating the aggression?  I've read a better ratio is 1:8 or so.  However, if you only have two then they'll fight until one kills the other.  So far, this is the only negative part of the experience."

The second eldest is cock of the walk and is the protector and dominant to the other two roos. He doesn't beat the other two, but he does nip their tail feathers to keep his place in the heirarchy. Number three is the youngest and has just started chasing hens around.  Number one knows his name and eats from my hand, number two treats me like an equal but keeps an eye on me, and number three has learned to keep away from me or suffer more lost feathers. You see, number three decided to challenge me once. Once. I grabbed my leg hook, picked him up, made baby cooing sounds and stroked under his beak. I have a feeling he was so embarrassed by the incident that he tries to keep it from happening again.

BackYardChickens,34vkid,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Mon May 4 23:43:04 2015 UTC,I'm in Minnesota and a lot of wild birds are testing positive....
BackYardChickens,34vkid,aimlessego,2,Tue May 5 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"Wild birds are attracted to chicken food, and shedding the virus into flocks. Using step-on food bins, or food that is unappealing to wild birds helps(pellets).   Trying to keep wild birds out of a closed chicken run will help loads....as well as keeping the run dry, the dispensers clean."
BackYardChickens,34vkid,jrwreno,2,Tue May 5 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"I am in an affected state, with farms as close as 60 miles having outbreaks.  We are keeping our birds in their run, no free ranging until it appears to pass.  We have taken measures to seal up any gaps in the coop where little birds could get in.  No bird feeders in the yard this year, and I use dedicated coop-shoes. All feed and bedding is kept in the garage in sealed containers."

BackYardChickens,34vkid,corinthian_llama,1 point,Wed May 6 16:30:13 2015 UTC,Probably crows. During the last epidemic we were supposed to report dead crows we found. They roost in huge groups so everything gets spread.  Commercial barns are supposed to have everyone step into disinfectant with their rubber boots. Outsiders are supposed to stay off the property. At least that's the excuse. I wondered if they just don't want people sneaking in to film the bad conditions.
BackYardChickens,34wo38,Kiaton,2,Tue May 5 04:20:01 2015 UTC,So you're saying the poor conditions of the chicks caused their strange behavior? Could be but I would say there is a lot of variability in behavior among chickens so it could just be that. Some just make weird noises. Some don't like people as much. Also I would say you should just continue to provide them with proper care and maybe they will come around. That's all you can really do unless you notice actual bodily harm or unhealthy behavior (not eating or drinking).
BackYardChickens,34wo38,Redcard911,2,Tue May 5 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"Tough to say. The one that is stargazing, do you have a photo? Perhaps a vitamin deficiency? I would first suggest making sure they are physically healthy... Sav-a-chick electrolytes and probiotics in their water. Nutridrench daily, if you can get it(one drop in the side of the beak) and no-iron Polyvisol children's liquid vitamin. Also some extra protein- chopped boiled egg, etc."

Production is best when there is a lot of light and they have a good diet. That said, a good rooster will...   protect the flock. negate the need for a ""top hen"". Pecking order among hens can cause a lot of bullying, even injury. scratch up bugs and other tasty stuff for the girls.   The cons:   you need to keep enough hens for him to mate with, or he can harm them from overdoing it. 5 hens for one rooster is minimum. possible aggression toward people. You can sometimes adjust the attitude of a pissy rooster, but it takes time and patience and is not always possible."

BackYardChickens,34w9on,YouCanCallMeBoo,8,Tue May 5 02:06:18 2015 UTC,Talk to your neighbors and ask them to keep the chickens on their property. You shouldn't have to deal with their animals.
BackYardChickens,34w9on,UnidansVoteBot,2,Tue May 5 14:56:11 2015 UTC,I checked at what my local laws are for Live Stock and it does say that they're required to have a fence that keeps their chickens on their property or I can contact the proper authorities.

Its very inconsiderate. I would talk to them about it first and give them the chance to do the right thing. Most people aren't jerks but sometimes they don't really think about how other people might feel about something they don't care about.   If they don't remedy the problem I would again go to them and tell them you will get some authorities involved. I don't know about where you live but I live in a town that allows chickens unless they are a nuisance. I would definitely say that qualifies!   Good luck! Hopefully talking with them solves it."
BackYardChickens,34w9on,Jackawolf,1 point,Thu May 7 03:01:43 2015 UTC,Have you talked to them about it?
BackYardChickens,34w9on,poorsoi,4,Thu May 7 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"A motion-activated sprinkler is the only thing I can think of. Chickens will eventually grow accustomed to any other obstacles, plants, or scare tactics you put out there."
BackYardChickens,34w9on,Grimsterr,9,Tue May 5 04:08:14 2015 UTC,"Talk to the neighbor, if he refuses to keep them at home, then he might reconsider after you eat one or two."

BackYardChickens,34v8au,IdesofBlue,2,Mon May 4 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"12x12 should be big enough. Chickens are good at squeezing.  I say go with deep litter. Carbon and more carbon.

BackYardChickens,34v8au,Jackawolf,2,Tue May 5 00:16:38 2015 UTC,"A good rule of thumb is 4 sq ft per bird in the coop and 10 sq ft in the run. If you decide to get more chickens, and that is completely possible, you will want a bigger coop. Better to go bigger now.  Chickens may be good at squeezing, but that's because they don't have a choice. Remember on bad weather days they may spend the whole day in the coop. Packing chickens in causes stress and pecking.  Happy chickens are healthy chickens."
BackYardChickens,34v8au,Jackawolf,1 point,Wed May 6 20:13:25 2015 UTC,My coop is 4x6x3 so thats 72sq feet right? And my run will be 4x10x2.5 which is 100sq feet. So that should be plenty for 4 birds right? Unless I'm doing my math wrong.
BackYardChickens,34v8au,Jackawolf,2,Wed May 6 22:57:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, bad math. :) Your coop is 24sq ft (width x  length). So you have plenty of space for 4 (6ft per chicken). You have just the right size run.  Just want you to be aware of something called chicken math."
BackYardChickens,34v8au,Jackawolf,1 point,Thu May 7 01:14:33 2015 UTC,Haha i heard that before. I guess i was calculating volume. Its 72 cubed feet. At this time i only plan on having the 4. I only plan on getting more if something happens to one. But thats the thing about chicken math...
BackYardChickens,34t5d5,aw8gr8f8,10,Mon May 4 10:16:00 2015 UTC,Cute chick. They do better in pairs if you can get another as a friend for her. Wonder where she came from!

I am happy that he seems so healthy. I can't imagine he was alone out there for long as it got close to freezing last night. I'm thinking he may have been dumped. =("
BackYardChickens,34t5d5,corrikopat,3,Mon May 4 12:06:02 2015 UTC,I can't imagine! You can put a small mirror and a stuffed toy for her.

BackYardChickens,34v8ri,Venymae,1 point,Mon May 4 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"Keep the vent clean. I usually just run a sink with relatively warm water and hold the chick parallel to the ground and just let the water run all around the vent. If you do it just right the rest of the chick won't get wet. Even if you soak the rest of the feathers, just run a warm blow-dryer about a foot away to dry them off.  For sour crop, I think you should provide cool, clean water, some small grit stirred in with their food, and perhaps some unflavored yogurt on the side. Is the crop firm? Does it feel like a big hard growth on their chest? Sometimes you can just massage the area to get everything moving in the right direction."

BackYardChickens,34tv51,Grimsterr,1 point,Mon May 4 15:03:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you. No blood, so hopefully they get over it soon. The gal we got them from had already mixed them, but I think she had done it right before she gave them to us."
BackYardChickens,34tv51,dogGirl666,2,Mon May 4 16:25:30 2015 UTC,Yea as long as it's not drawing blood it's just them establishing the pecking order. If one of the adults is being too rough you can take it out for a full day or two and it'll help throw the pecking order out of whack which usually makes it calm down.

They also move their heads more freely/inquisitively even at this age-plus they seem like they have longer necks. I'm told that they don't scratch at their food but only peck at it so food does not go flying everywhere-this seems to be true even at this age a few days. They also[mine anyway] have tried flying [starting at 2 days old]; they make a running jump and flap their wings--seemingly acrobatic for a creature that shape and age! The sounds they make are different and they respond to my calls (an imitation of theirs). I'm mostly comparing them to the 25 baby Australorps I got the first of March and how they behaved [you can see their mugshot-like photos I posted on this sub in March], so other breeds of baby chickens may act slightly differently or?"

One of my brave little Giants came out yesterday and ate next to one of the hens, but I am afraid they are going to get eaten.  I know, I am just being overprotective.  Right?  Thanks everyone!"
BackYardChickens,34rfvq,SluiceBox,2,Mon May 4 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know honestly. The chicks play outside supervised, and come in at night. We don't leave the chicks with the hens unattended."
BackYardChickens,34rgxz,bredoub,10,Sun May 3 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"Sexing chicks at that age is guesswork. Adolescents' sex is hard to figure out. There's a couple features that can point toward male or female but you won't know until they get closer to 4-5 months.  If you bought it from a hatchery that vent-sexes, it's probably a hen.  Don't worry about giving it away just yet. To me the lack of wattles and rounded neck feathers scream hen :)."
BackYardChickens,34rgxz,umaerth,3,Mon May 4 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"The photo was taken a a little less than a week ago, and the waddle is coming in now. The chicken is about 6 weeks old now. Here is one from yesterday  But here is one taken on the same day as the original I posted.  You think there's a chance it could be a hen?"

BackYardChickens,34rgxz,sunsmoon,1 point,Mon May 4 05:16:45 2015 UTC,I have some experience with this and I hate to cast doubt but... hen feathered is a thing. Here's my boy at 2 months and one year. In the one year photo you can see that his feathers are not very rooster like but he is obviously a rooster.
BackYardChickens,34rgxz,sunsmoon,5,Mon May 11 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"The lack of thin, pointy saddle feathers also scream hen to me.  I've had loads of hens around that age that had well developed combs.  I've never had a rooster that age that hadn't yet developed the thin, pointed saddle and neck feathers, and I've had quite a few chickens."
BackYardChickens,34rgxz,kayakyakr,1 point,Mon May 4 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"The chicken is 6 weeks old. If it were a roo, should it have pointy saddle feathers by now?"
BackYardChickens,34rgxz,Bigdx,2,Mon May 4 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"At 6 weeks they should have most if not all of their adolescent feathers, which are very similar to their adult feathers.  The tell-tale rooster feathers should begin coming in at this point, and will become more pronounced over the next 2-4 weeks.  While the neck and saddle feathers won't be as long as an adult rooster, they should still be of similar shape.  If you have other chickens, you can see how this one interacts with the others.  If it has showy fights, it might be a rooster.  If it just pecks a bit or chest bumps a bit and then settles down quickly, it might be a hen.  Also, if you move the chicken to living outdoors, roosters tend to become less friendly after that transition while hens are more likely to retain the same friendliness they had when they were in the brooder/being handled frequently.  Of course, the only way to know 100% for certain is if the chicken crows or lays an egg."
BackYardChickens,34rgxz,high6ix,6,Mon May 4 19:31:27 2015 UTC,"Do you have other barred rocks of a similar age? The roosters are significantly more white than the hens, making them fairly easy to sex starting at around 4 weeks. From the picture I could go either way."

It is possible to breed feather-sexable barred rocks via the delayed feathering gene, but I don't know of any commercial hatcheries that do it. It requires selecting only certain males and females to breed, and by the time they've reached sexual maturity it's no longer obvious which K gene expression they have.  Did this bird have a yellow dot on its head when it was a day old? That's usually just a female thing in barred rocks."

BackYardChickens,34rgxz,_feffers_,1 point,Mon May 4 05:05:37 2015 UTC,"If it's a barred rock that's a huge lead-on it's a pullet. If it has very yellow legs, it's definitely a barred rock. My maran started getting grey legs around 5-6 weeks, before that they were almost white. Do you have a picture of it standing alone? The angle of the tail and relative size of the legs can be another clue."

I'd say by the yellow skin you've got a barred rock, and if that's the case I've heard that the black marking on the legs can indicate a pullet. At 6 weeks I would also expect the tail to be much more ""rooster"" looking. Some hens and some breeds just mature faster than others and this can lead them to looking ""manly."" I've actually got two little pullets (a Welsummer and a Brown Leghorn) this year that are maturing faster and already have larger red combs than their brooder mates but everything else is definitely pullet."
BackYardChickens,34tr8m,ppoppers,3,Mon May 4 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Don't really look too much like saddle and sickle feathers, just hen feathers that have been bent downward.  Give it some more time, that still might be a hen."

It turns out that my leghorn carries barring, so he is a sex link and is buff barred and beautiful. He's got a great temperament and looks like he's going to be gorgeous. He's a very soft buff color with white barring. He's already got a huge comb at 10 weeks, courtesy of his leghorn mother, and is trying to crow, which is adorable."

BackYardChickens,34r6vx,carefree_dude,4,Sun May 3 21:19:10 2015 UTC,My guess is cockerel. Those hackles look too pointed to be a pullet.
BackYardChickens,34r6vx,_feffers_,2,Sun May 3 21:34:24 2015 UTC,This is what I'm afraid of. Where I live (portland) doesn't allow roosters. I'll have to try and find him a new home. Thankfully he's super tame and would make a good pet. He's a shoulder bird.
BackYardChickens,34r6vx,_feffers_,2,Sun May 3 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into crowing collars? I've never personally used one, but I have a friend who uses one for her silkie Roo (similar situation- 3 hens, no Roos in city limits).

BackYardChickens,34r6vx,anna_boson,3,Sun May 3 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"Possibly. I don't think the collar is big enough to prevent him from mounting.  Is that a problem?  You can eat fertile eggs. If you collect daily and refrigerate immediately, there's almost no difference between fertile and infertile eggs.  Example: http://imgur.com/lLExODQ  Another thing to think about- while he may be very docile and friendly now, he will mature.  His spurs will grow out and he may become aggressive.  This is a great for protecting your hens from predators (Hawks, raccoons, possum, dogs, etc), but not so much for you when you want to gather eggs. :)"

Getting it tight enough to keep him from crowing added too much risk of him choking on something and dying.  That's a bit of a tough call. The crest is still fairly tame where a polish rooster's crest tends to be very spiky. I don't see saddle feathers, but there are a few tail feathers that look like they could be sickle feathers.  10 weeks... if it's a roo, you should start hearing him attempting to crow sometime in the next month."
BackYardChickens,34rbwy,abby1371,4,Sun May 3 22:02:36 2015 UTC,"Its pretty simple with chickens.  Basically if you feed them, they will like you.

BackYardChickens,34qjpq,poorsoi,6,Sun May 3 18:01:50 2015 UTC,We have chickens that lay shell-less eggs occasionally.  Though there's usually at least a membrane around them.  My first guess is an egg eater.  Not finding shell isn't unusual.  They sometimes eat the eggs for the shell.    Do you supplement with oystershell?
BackYardChickens,34qjpq,Aerron,4,Sun May 3 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"This ^  Occasionally eggs get messed up. It's a little factory in there, with more than a dozen eggs in process. Lots of things can cause a hiccup. These are probably soft shell eggs that get crushed and the membrane is eaten, plus maybe part of the egg. It's also possible if the nest box has a hard floor, a hen may not be sitting and causing a similar effect with more robust eggs.   Make sure you're giving up them enough calcium supplement, good food, clean water, and ideally some access to bugs."
BackYardChickens,34qjpq,zebra5150,2,Sun May 3 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"No, I don't supplement any kind of calcium. Last year I was adding very finely crushed egg shells to their food, but I stopped because the shells of their eggs were very tough already, so it didn't seem they needed it."
BackYardChickens,34qjpq,DominionGalactica,2,Sun May 3 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue to this at one point when I got ducks.

BackYardChickens,34plmy,your_mom_is_availabl,6,Tue May 5 13:32:43 2015 UTC,"Chickens are tough on whatever plant you have growing in their run: they peck the blades, scratch up the roots, compact the soil, and leave a lot of harsh chemicals in their droppings. (No gardener would dream of fertilizing their garden with raw chicken poop -- it would burn the plants!)  If you have enough room, consider having a rotation. Maybe divide the run in three and only let the chickens graze one section at a time. When they're done and you move them to another section, rototill the soil, do something to improve the soil, and then seed.  You can also protect the grass from the birds like this:  http://i.ytimg.com/vi/CIGmLDlDN5E/hqdefault.jpg  You can either cover up sections of the ground, or build a free-standing planter for the grass. As long the chicken wire is a few inches above the soil to keep the chickens from killing the grass completely, that should help with the problem."

Most of that stuff grows waist high by maturity. Check at your county extension or local feed store. You can slash it when it goes to seed or run livestock on it.

BackYardChickens,34e93k,KnifehandHolsters,4,Thu Apr 30 13:37:27 2015 UTC,Can someone explain the difference between a frizzled mutt and a chicken that breeds true?
BackYardChickens,34e93k,alfavametraxis,4,Thu Apr 30 15:08:09 2015 UTC,"Chicken that breeds true (so an actual new breed of chicken) will have its offspring with the same features as its parent. For example, Silkies have blue skin and polydactyly (an extra toe). If you think you've bread a silkie and it doesn't have those features, then it didn't breed true (and what you have is not a silkie). For her ""breed"" to breed true, it would need the same colors and physical characteristics as its parents.  Frizzle is a genetic mutation that can be passed around different breeds. You have to be very careful with frizzles because 1: their feathers are a bit more delicate than smooth feathered birds, and 2: breeding two frizzles together gets you a double frizzle which will have all sorts of problems and probably not survive.  Source: I have two frizzle hens that I've bred with my smooth roo. Theoretically, I'll wind up with 50% frizzle chicks. One of my frizzle hens has bad... elbows?... where her feathers have broken due to her rubbing against the coop edges (Polish don't like being cooped up) and being mounted by the rooster (he's a juvenile jerk sometimes)."
BackYardChickens,34e93k,kayakyakr,7,Thu Apr 30 16:15:19 2015 UTC,So... she created a 3rd or 4th generation frizzled mutt and got an award for it?  Talk to me when the hybrids breed true.

BackYardChickens,34e93k,kayakyakr,1 point,Fri May 1 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Spanish blues would be a color variation of black and splash with the resultant color coming across as blue. I don't know if you'd consider the blue as a different breed than the black or splash, that's up for debate (in dog breeding, coloration is not a factor in differentiating breeds, but it seems to be in chickens). Most importantly, though, when you breed spanish blues, you wind up with some additional spanish blues. That means that you've bred true.  Physical characteristics of the bird are much more important than coloration: size, build, temperament, egg color..."

BackYardChickens,34eoxh,blunereid,6,Thu Apr 30 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"There's this lovely video on YouTube that really helped me to watch before my first processing. Here is a link. It's just truly incredible, and even if you don't use the same method shown in the video, the way she acts around the bird is just something amazing to see.  Some other advice: While the process is generally the same, there are certainly some differences between the butchering of Cornish Rocks and the butchering of dual-purpose breeds. Most guides are speaking of Cornish Cross, so if you are doing DP breeds, try to find a source regarding their processing, specifically.  Secondly, people will tell you you HAVE to remove the oil gland in the tail and the lungs. This isn't really necessary (oil gland removal is necessary in game or waterfowl, but not chickens). Of course, you can if you want to, but it doesn't effect flavor or appearance of you don't. The oil gland is beneath the skin and the lungs are adhered to the inside of the carcass.  Also, lots of instructions say you should withhold feed for 24 hours beforehand. Since it's your first time, I wouldn't. The thing I experienced the most trouble with when I started out was finding the crop. As long as you keep the knife well away from it, it's quite a bit harder to tear than people make it out to be, and it's SO much easier to find if its full of feed.  If you are dealing with male fowl, be careful of the testes; they are very easy to cut or tear and, frankly, I don't think anyone wants that on their food. With hens of laying age, there will be quite a few yolks and partially formed eggs floating around in the abdominal cavity; these are also super easy to pop, but obviously not as much of an issue to wash off. They're great for dogs, to throw back to the flock, or even to cook up for yourself.  Lastly: A great tip I found somewhere on the web a while ago, there is a fantastic fool-proof method for making sure a bird is dead. In some killing methods - for example slitting the throat - it can be very difficult to tell the difference between a chicken that is actually dead, and a chicken that is still experiencing death spasms. I can personally say I screwed this up once, on my second chicken ever. I put the poor thing in the scalder before it was completely dead, and I have never gotten over it. So here's the tip: poke the eye. If it blinks, it's alive. If it doesn't, it's ready for the hot water. Never once had this method fail me.  Kudos to you for embarking on such a project. It's very freeing in terms of what you can do with your flock. You can have more diverse breeds, bigger hatches (cause what'll you do with the extras? Cut em up, throw em in the oven! Keep the cuties), and best of all - you have a FANTASTICALLY better knowledge of chicken anatomy, which is invaluable when one of your pet or layer chickens is sick or injured; Two years ago, I'd have never been willing to fix up a guinea hen's neck with superglue and iodine, but after well over 50 or 100 birds processed by my hand, I was confident enough to patch the thing up in under an hour. Good luck with your project!  EDIT: some words  Edit 2: more words"
BackYardChickens,34eoxh,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri May 1 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this wonderful comment. I am really nervous about starting to process my own birds and it gave me a lot of courage, especially your excellent point that it will help me learn to care for my other birds better."
BackYardChickens,34eoxh,electrobolt,2,Fri May 1 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, the nervousness is normal. I'd say it took me ~20 birds to stop shaking and pacing beforehand. It always used to help me to go in the bathroom, look at myself in the mirror, and say, ""OK, I can do this. I am strong enough to do this. It needs to be done, and I am going to do it.""  Just try to shut down the feelings, and focus on each task individually. When you're sharpening the knife (or ax, etc.), don't think about what you are going to do with the knife, think about sharpening the knife. When you are gathering bags or storage containers to put the carcasses in, think about the bags or containers, not what you are going to put in them. Only think about killing the bird while you are killing the bird. After the bird is dead, it's much easier to focus, because it sort of becomes like solving a new puzzle. It's all very confusing at first, and your first bird will probably be pretty ugly and, well, ""butchered"" looking when all is said and done, but all that matters is that it's tasty!  Also, assume the process is going to take about twice as long as you think it is. My first bird ever took me an hour and a half (with help). Now, I can do a bird in maybe ~30 minutes, with a record of 10 minutes. So on your first day, be sure to clear a whole afternoon to do it, and remember - you may have three birds to process, but that doesn't mean you have to do them all in the same day. It's mentally and physically exhausting work, and if you only get one bird done your first day, it's absolutely fine. You can go back and do the others the next day, or the day after that."
BackYardChickens,34eoxh,GallusLafayetti,4,Fri May 1 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"I butchered my first last year, and watched a ton of videos, but nothing really gets you ready for the deed. My mom worked at a chicken farm that processed its old layers when she was a kid, so I had her help me with the actual removal of entrails, chilling, etc, but it's pretty straightforward.   First of all, you want a big pot of water, as near to boiling as possible, and a big tub of very cold water (if you're not going to cook your bird straight away). A small tarp or brown paper yard waste bag will help you keep the mess to a minimum. You'll also need a knife for processing (VERY sharp if you're going to slit the throat) and a very sharp hatchet if you're going to remove the head entirely. You should also probably process the animal out of sight of your flock, unless you're trying to send a message.   I went with the hatchet for my first time. I'm thinking that I'll try the killing cone at some point in the future, but if you're unfamiliar with the anatomy and possibly nervous, beheading is surer than slitting the carotid/jugular. I whetted that hatchet until it laid a line of blood when I tested it on the pad of my thumb; you want a one-strike beheading. I settled the hen into a squat, stretched out her neck on my board, had my helper hold her in place, and WHACK.   Once the head is off, you want to hang the bird by its feet and let the blood drain for a while. Any movement is reflex. The body will shudder, jerk, or convulse for a while, but not more than a couple of minutes. Once the bleeding has stopped, take the bird by the feet and plunge the carcass into the hot water, twirling it from side to side, like a washing machine. Pull it out after 20 or so seconds and start pulling out feathers by the handful. (This is where the tarp or bag comes in handy.) If the feathers aren't releasing, plunge and twirl again, for 10 seconds or so. Flight feathers and tailfeathers are the hardest to remove.   Once plucked and rinsed, it's time to gut it. I like to get the crop out (in the neck area), remove the oil gland (base of tail), and take off the feet before I open the body cavity. We make an inverted ""V"" cut from the bottom of the rib cage to either side of the cloaca. Cut lightly and carefully: if you cut the intestines, you can taint the meat. Slide your hand, palm down, into the body cavity, with the entrails below your palm. move your hand from one side to the other to loosen them, grab the esophagus and trachea, and curl your hand, pulling out the entire mass. I prefer to finish the cut around the cloaca after I remove the entrails (to reduce the liklihood of nicking it and contaminating the meat), but some do it beforehand.   If you're processing a hen, you may find that some oviduct tissue clings to the inside of the rib cage. Ensure that the interior of the carcass is clean, then place it into chilled water (or cook immediately). I like to save the livers, hearts, and feet, but you have to throw the feet into your scalding water, scrub them, and pop off the outer claw sheaths befor you want to use them. If you're saving any organs, do NOT, under any circumstances, nick the gallbladder. It's green and small and the bile within will taint whatever it touches.   One word of warning: a processed carcass will experience rigor mortis if not immediately cooked. It's no big deal, but it took me by surprise the first time I processed my own. The joints are stiff, not wiggly like a store-bought bird. You can freeze it for later, and the stiffness will disappear as you thaw, or you can refrigerate for 12-72 hours and it will dissipate.   Sorry for my lack of links, but there are so many videos that I watched that they all seem to blur together. I'd suggest a search string similar to ""humanely processing chickens"". You'll find what works for you best through time; experience is the greatest teacher."

It was my first exposure to keeping chickens. Up until then, I assumed they were dumb ""meatballs"" with very little redeeming qualities other than being delicious.   That summer I watched as one of my favorite teeny-tiny, docile, friendly bantam hens attacked and killed a HUGE rat that was nearly the same size she was. The hen was a new mother, having just hatched 8 popcorn-sized chicks that she kept neatly tucked in the feathers when the little family was resting.   The rat had dared to sneak into her pen to steal some of layer crumbles when she spotted it and unleashed her inner ""mama"" T-Rex on the doomed rodent. By the time I realized what was happening, the rat was dead and Mama Banty was back at her nest doing a ""head count"" of her precious brood.   Chickens are pretty bad-ass when they want to be. :)"

BackYardChickens,34cnk5,Nikkibert,6,Thu Apr 30 02:09:14 2015 UTC,"How would you feel if a black SUV followed you around everywhere you drove? Freaked out, right?  Do this to your rooster. On foot. Just follow him slowly wherever he goes for about 10 minutes. Do it every time you go near him. After a while he will give up and accept you as dominant. Then you can use a brief refresher stalk as needed.  I am told this is how peacocks intimidate."
BackYardChickens,34cnk5,ReverendEarthwormJim,3,Thu Apr 30 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"We had one that attacked our son, who was four at the time. I showed him to put his foot out and push the rooster away. Never to kick, just to nudge, and to be consistent. It took one day for the roo to chill out and we had no problems after. Holding them and carrying them works, too. We broke an aggressive hen by holding her. Keep trying different methods until you find something that works. Good luck to you and your little one!"
BackYardChickens,34cnk5,Benji_Likes_Waffles,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:02:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! I'm willing give these a shot! Plus...stalking a rooster sounds kinda fun
BackYardChickens,34cnk5,nilikon,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"I have three cockerels hitting puberty and the testosterone is INCREDIBLE here. I am a huge advocate for what others have named ""corporal cuddling"".   When one of mine begins to get a bit cocky (haha), I pick that big boy up and carry him under my arm while I collect eggs, fill feeders and waterers, check out the fence, etc. If he struggles or complains, I'll occasionally take my free hand and (very gently) hold his head below (his) shoulder level. If it pops back up, I repeat this action until he keeps his head lowered for a time of his own accord. When it's time to put him down, I only do so if he remains calm and uncomplaining. Any attitude and I scoop him back up right away.   As others have mentioned, stalking your roosters also works well, but I prefer my method since I can do all my chores and don't have to follow anyone around. I had one of mine actually trying to throw spurs at me (a level of aggression above the ""dance and charge""), and it took me only three days of enforced closeness (twice daily for about 10 minutes) before he was back to appropriate, friendly behavior."
BackYardChickens,34cnk5,Grimsterr,2,Thu Apr 30 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"I've done the stalking thing, it just resulted in the rooster turning around and trying another attack.  I had to fall back to my old stand by, bouncing him off the fence with a well placed kick.  We had one get mean last year, I bounced him off the chain link of the chicken pen and that was that, he just froze after he landed looking at me like ""da fuck dude, that's not fair"" and after that he never tried me again."
BackYardChickens,34cnk5,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"My main flock rooster, Benedict, is a jerk like this. Whenever he does it, I grab him by his hackles and his feet, lay him on his back, and scream in his face. It terrifies him, and he leaves me alone for a while. This happens about once a week, or if I wear a different pair of shoes into the coop.  Generally, I just try to terrify aggressive roosters. If they're scared of you, they won't be coming after you. I don't ever really hurt them, but I like to do a lot of LOUD noises and growling and to hold them upside down by the legs, and rub all over the body really quick, mussing up the feathers, especially near their face and belly. They seem to hate the sensation.  Barring that, you can leg tie him, or make soup. I'm sure you could try to give it away on Craigslist, but realistically, no one wants an aggressive rooster."
BackYardChickens,34cnk5,kayakyakr,1 point,Fri May 1 00:56:12 2015 UTC,"If mine starts to give me attitude, I'll grab him, push his chest and head down to the ground until he stops struggling and then carry him around for a bit. He will only challenge me when he's protecting his girls, though. The two frizzles are easily surprised so when I go to pick them up they squawk like mad and that puts him in a tizzy.  Recently tried feeding him from my hands and he was surprisingly polite and gentle. Good bird."
BackYardChickens,34cnk5,high6ix,1 point,Fri May 1 00:58:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed with all of the above. In a chicken society you need to understand that you are part of the flock, or you aren't. So you and your daughter are either low-man or are not part of at all but either way need to establish dominance. We've grabbed our rooster and pinned him for a few minutes at a time, or just pushed and lifted with our foot to get him away. Every time he gets a big head we do this a few times and he's good for weeks on end. Of course this depends on how much myself or my daughter is out there. But keep in mind you are the head of the flock so you have to demonstrate (your daughter as well) who's in charge."

Personally, I wouldn't bother with raising Cornish X unless you plan to butcher and sell by the pound. 8 weeks is butcher weight. I'm raising them for meat this year, at 6 weeks old they've already had me for $10/each in feed alone, and that's not including the ones that had heart attacks in last week's thunderstorms that are lost profits.

BackYardChickens,347lve,plbogen,6,Wed Apr 29 12:59:57 2015 UTC,No joke my Anatolian Shepherd mixes would take one look at the Fox and laugh. They are bred to kill wolves.   But as others said that Fox doesn't look right and maybe rabid.
BackYardChickens,347lve,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:04:19 2015 UTC,LOL. But then my dog wouldn't run and be safe like the coward she is. She's just have a belly full of FOX RABIES.
BackYardChickens,347lve,cordial_carbonara,8,Wed Apr 29 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"If you manage to shoot it, save the body for the game warden or take it to a local vet or something. If it was behaving as suspiciously as it looks in this image they'll probably want to do an autopsy to rule out rabies."
BackYardChickens,347lve,adamdreaming,2,Wed Apr 29 02:54:32 2015 UTC,yep. that's the plan. They only need the head though apparently.
BackYardChickens,347lve,alfavametraxis,7,Wed Apr 29 02:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's all they need, but really....I'd just take the whole body lol. I'm not going to behead an animal and carry around just the head. They can pick which parts they need! That's how I handled a rabid raccoon a few years back anyway."
BackYardChickens,347lve,JALevine,2,Wed Apr 29 03:00:26 2015 UTC,"Sucks about your chickens, hope your dog is okay. Hope you keep the pelt on that thing, nail it to the coop."
BackYardChickens,347lve,JALevine,5,Wed Apr 29 12:48:21 2015 UTC,"I think the chickens are all accounted for, believe if or not. My other theory is the Fox was not hungry for chickens, he was hungry for beagle love."
BackYardChickens,347lve,JALevine,2,Wed Apr 29 13:53:36 2015 UTC,"It may be the angle of the photo, but something looks ""not right"" about that fox. What ended up happening with it?"
BackYardChickens,347lve,JALevine,2,Thu Apr 30 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"still prowling around as I understand it. I'm still out of the country, so I only get updates when the Mrs. gets home or if the MIL decides to take a photo of it rather than shooting it."
BackYardChickens,347lve,wintercast,5,Thu Apr 30 15:27:59 2015 UTC,They're closed because their budgets keep getting cut
BackYardChickens,347lve,wintercast,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:32:59 2015 UTC,"That's what I said to the wife. But nonetheless, no open so no help."
BackYardChickens,347lve,KidKarate,2,Wed Apr 29 12:33:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a bummer.  I used to work for a large municipality, and the local tea party kept demanding cuts to the budget.  The mayor suspended dead animal pickup and overtime for garbage men.  Those howling for the cuts quickly realized exactly what they were demanding."
BackYardChickens,347lve,KidKarate,2,Wed Apr 29 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"it's silly. These are necessary functions. you want to cut stuff, but you aren't looking for efficiencies FIRST in current systems. It's so dumb."
BackYardChickens,347lve,KidKarate,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"That's because looking for efficiencies would mean taking time to truly assess where those inefficiencies lie.  The problem is that those demanding the cuts want them to happen NOW, and those at the top don't want their budgets cut so they don't really have a motivation to find appropriate cuts.    edit:  I think it's also a case of wanting your cake and eating it too.  If you want lower taxes, that's fine, but you also have to deal with fewer services."
BackYardChickens,347lve,czerniana,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:02:16 2015 UTC,"in my view, the data is ALWAYS there, you just have to build it into the workflow. So everything that they're (governement programs) are doing should have timetables and accounting built into it. I know I have to know how long stuff takes me to do in my work because I bill by the hour."
BackYardChickens,347lve,czerniana,2,Wed Apr 29 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, however, working for the public doesn't always align so neatly with the way the private sector accounts for time and billing.  There were so many times that a half hour job would take me an hour or more because someone would see my city vehicle and would want to lodge a complaint about something.  I would then have to take the time to explain to them who to get in touch with.  There are so many variables facing public sector employees that private employees don't have to deal with."
BackYardChickens,347lve,CochinBrahmaLover,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"Of course! Which is why I think that kind of thing should be captured. If you know that your time is being wasted on the regular for something that say a website or a hotline could do instead, that's an efficiency that could be build in. Otherwise, the bean counters look at your job and they don't understand why the ""same job"" takes longer sometimes."
BackYardChickens,347lve,plbogen,2,Wed Apr 29 16:57:32 2015 UTC,"This is like animal control in my area being closed at night.  that is when people leave their dog's outside in freezing weather all night with no shelter, food, or  water and let the poor thing howl all night."
BackYardChickens,347lve,czerniana,2,Wed Apr 29 19:52:32 2015 UTC,"eh, I have a beagle. They howl all night regardless. She's also kinda dumb. I watched her sit in the rain and look sad right next to her dry dog house. I went out dried her off and put her in the doghouse with food. She then proceeded to walk right back out of the doghouse with the blanket and sat in the rain to look sad. She's EMO."

BackYardChickens,347lve,Ekleo,5,Wed Apr 29 00:21:58 2015 UTC,Yep.  I didn't take the pic. My mil did and sent it to me on FB. With no updates about the kids or dog or chickens.  So I got to have a heart attack for 20 minutes.
BackYardChickens,347lve,The_Grub,4,Wed Apr 29 00:24:42 2015 UTC,Yikes. They'll keep coming back until all the chickens are gone

BackYardChickens,347lve,KittyJ,3,Wed Apr 29 01:38:40 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're getting downvoted for what is going to happen to the fox. It's not like I'm going to adopt it as a rescue and we'll all live happily ever after.
BackYardChickens,347lve,onlyone21,4,Wed Apr 29 13:57:32 2015 UTC,Bleeding hearts and romantics. One of these guys found my ducks and chickens. Ate and kept eating until I caught him. Its the only way.
BackYardChickens,347lve,Alacritous,2,Wed Apr 29 15:33:32 2015 UTC,they don't care these foxes because they don't have tumblr accounts. Otherwise they would know how adorable they're supposed to be.
BackYardChickens,347lve,Grimsterr,5,Wed Apr 29 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"that's encouraging at least. Chased a dog roughly the same size though, in broad daylight, so I'm leery."
BackYardChickens,347lve,jrwreno,5,Wed Apr 29 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"Yikes.  Definitely be careful.  Make sure you take a good look at your dog too, to make sure he didn't get bit. Not even a little nip.  I hope you find it, before it wreaks havoc on your chickens."
BackYardChickens,347lve,rufil-dixon,2,Wed Apr 29 01:39:31 2015 UTC,The Mrs said the dog did not get a scratch which I'm very glad about. The dogs had her vaccinations for rabies as well so I hope that helps but I know that they're not a hundred percent
BackYardChickens,347lve,IdesofBlue,4,Wed Apr 29 03:49:02 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  Seeing a fox is not necessarily rare, but having one chase a dog and then come right up to the window like that?  That behavior worries me.  I'm glad everything is safe so far though."

BackYardChickens,347lve,graffiti81,0,Wed Apr 29 18:25:34 2015 UTC,i hate fixes. They are worse than foxes. Funny acting animals don't get a pass from me. Except maybe the deer. They're just giant dumb dogs that eat roses. I can't get mad at them.
BackYardChickens,347lve,graffiti81,3,Wed Apr 29 18:38:49 2015 UTC,Such a bittersweet photo.  It's a shame that it has made itself a pest to the point that it should be condemned to be killed.

If i feed and placate him, he will no longer be wild and that sucks. If I do nothing he will kill my chickens (only a matter of time). At the end, he's got to go. And if I see him, I will be the one who makes him go."

BackYardChickens,34589d,LadyDarkKitten,15,Tue Apr 28 15:31:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're pets. Most of us in this sub name our chickens, know their personalities, and show affection to our birds just like any other pet owner would. The fact that our pets happen to produce delicious, healthy food for our families is a happy bonus."
BackYardChickens,34589d,CochinBrahmaLover,10,Tue Apr 28 15:57:39 2015 UTC,Well said! I think many of us here take their birds to the vet which isn't really a farm life kind of thing.
BackYardChickens,34589d,LadyDarkKitten,2,Tue Apr 28 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Phhht, if there's a vet to take them to. I have to vet my own birds, fortunately I have a solid back ground in first aid that helped quite a bit."
BackYardChickens,34589d,CochinBrahmaLover,2,Tue Apr 28 17:12:21 2015 UTC,I live in the country and was astonished to learn people take their chickens to vets.  I asked the local horse/dog/cat vet about chickens and he said he knew damn near nothing about chickens. Got a similar response from the Texas A&M small animal clinic when I had to get surgery on a cat much loved by she-who-must-be-obeyed.
BackYardChickens,34589d,LadyDarkKitten,6,Wed Apr 29 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"It's a little bit of an unusual situation.  They're city chickens.  Apartment type life.  Every morning I get them dressed in their harnesses and they go out and about with us.  Some days they mow the lawn of a preapproved place.  They are egg layers but just have a little different life than most.  They're identical though so we color code them.  (Larry blue, Mo purple, Curly pink, and Shemp Green)"
BackYardChickens,34589d,CochinBrahmaLover,4,Tue Apr 28 15:58:42 2015 UTC,Do they have their coop indoors? I have 3 3-week chicks that we are currently building a coop for so they can go outside in a few months. I'm nervous about it and would rather keep them indoors forever lol
BackYardChickens,34589d,LadyDarkKitten,5,Tue Apr 28 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"So they identify ""coop"" as milk crates with bedding.  Some nights they stay at my apartment and come into a remote corner of the basement using a cat flap.  Other nights they stay at their own house which is a Fisher Price Playhouse converted into a coop that is kept at a vacant house nearby.  As long as they come inside something (even a dog kennel once) that has milk crates, they're happy.   Edit: swypo"
BackYardChickens,34589d,LadyDarkKitten,3,Tue Apr 28 16:27:19 2015 UTC,"If you've only go three then you can get them a parrot cage, especially if they are just sleeping in it.

As far as I can tell, at some point in time he broke his neck, and it healed, but at a bad angle. He can now only reach the feathers around his neck and breast to preen. I was wondering if anyone ever dealt with a bird like this before? At the moment, I'm doing my best to preen his feathers for him. He seems to enjoy it a lot, and he ever bites at the air, like he's trying to help, while I do it. I only get to it once or twice a week, however, so he looks kinda raggedy a lot of the time. Does anyone have any suggestions for how often I should preen him? Any tips? Tools to help with it? Thanks."

BackYardChickens,344fte,muzzawood,3,Tue Apr 28 05:34:01 2015 UTC,"I check daily and when it's either too stanky or more than I'm comfortable with, I change it. Usually about once a week for my 3 birds in a 1.2m x 1.2m coop."
BackYardChickens,344fte,Thorax_O_Tool,2,Tue Apr 28 06:45:27 2015 UTC,What litter are you using? I'm using auboise. Using the deep litter method. Cleaning it out totally very 6 months or something. They keep turning the litter so as long as the ventilation is good it doesn't smell.
BackYardChickens,344fte,boyced,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:42:22 2015 UTC,I am using straw at the moment.  Ventilation is good.  Never smells is just the look of it.  And a busy life to.
BackYardChickens,344fte,boyced,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:24:56 2015 UTC,I'm not keen on straw it doesn't really seem to break down
BackYardChickens,344fte,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on what litter you are using. If you use pine shavings, you can go with deep litter method, and just add a thin layer over the whole coop each day, and do a full cleaning once or twice per year. If it's straw or something else, you should be adding new stuff every day or two and clean at least once per week."
BackYardChickens,344fte,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:54:49 2015 UTC,WOW.  Yeah using straw but only changing once a month.  It is a bit of a open space so the deep method might not work.  Might have to box a bit up under the roosting area.  That might help but I think I should start paying more attention to it.
BackYardChickens,344fte,Zebba_Odirnapal,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even every two weeks would be better than once a month. With two hens it can't be that bad, but straw has this way of getting very icky very fast, especially wheat. I've always found rice straw to do a slightly better job of absorbing moisture and covering the poo.  I'm not sure it matters so much if it's open. My coop is very large, more of a barn than anything, with a large window that's open 24/7 (even in bad storms, I just lower the covering a little) and a large door that's open all day long. Deep Litter works just fine for me, and pine shavings is waaaay easier to keep fresh and clean than straw."
BackYardChickens,344fte,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:11:31 2015 UTC,Oat straw is awesome if you can get it. Almost zero dust. Very absorbent.
BackYardChickens,344fte,Zebba_Odirnapal,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm, our local feed stores only carry wheat and rice. Maybe I'll ask my specialty guy if he can get some oat straw in. I don't use it inside my coops, but I use it in my peafowl pen to keep it nice for them."
BackYardChickens,344fte,Jackawolf,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:43:48 2015 UTC,Oats are more of a northern crop. I've had success in zone 7b sowing in the fall for mid-summer harvest.
BackYardChickens,344fte,Jackawolf,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:18:28 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend installing a poop board if you have the room. I use Sweet PDZ on the board. It takes less than a minute to scoop the poop with a cat litter scoop and toss it in a 5gal bucket. The coop never smells and you can see at a glance if a chicken has issues, like blood in the stool.  Sweet PDZ removes ammonia, dries the poop and is compostable and edible for chickens. It has really made keeping the coop clean, a breeze. Edit: tablet autocorrect"
BackYardChickens,342iu4,1_EYED_MONSTER,2,Mon Apr 27 20:14:28 2015 UTC,Done! Pretty fun I've never built a coop/shed before and didn't end up using any plans but it was a great experience. Just have to build the run (any suggestions?) then move their nesting boxes/feeders/waterers when we move the gals.
BackYardChickens,342iu4,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"We did our run by burying a foot of 3' hardware cloth into the ground (So 2' of hardware cloth visible). Above that, we used rolls of 2""x4"" field fencing. 4x4 posts at the corners. The first 8' of our run is covered with plastic roofing panels and a sloped roof similar to what you did on your coop so the gals can get out of the weather but stay outside if they wanted, the rest is covered with field fencing and straight across. Two years now, not a single predator problem!"
BackYardChickens,342iu4,not_whiney,2,Tue Apr 28 00:57:15 2015 UTC,"I built a very similar coop. Only difference was 8x8. I also put down sheet vinyl flooring before the side framing. It lets us get a better clean out for the floor. It also prevents water damage since we put the waterer in the coop during winter cold.    We were worried about predators. We went with dog run fencing. 10 foot sections that are 6 tall and clamp together at ends. It gives us a solid fence that is easily expandable and can be moved. (Other difference with our coop is its on 2 8x8 skids to drag around with tractor if needed) We had to buy the first section at the farm place but add on to it as we see sections on craigslist or on the traveling/bartering page. It keeps out the four legged predators well. We have not had raptor issues but will add netting if we do. The bottom 2 feet has chicken wire attached and the wire extends down and out a foot or so from the bottom of fence.  You can find them for usually 4 sections for like 80 to 100. It is very sturdy and since prefab easy to work with. They are galvanized and will last for years. And more than likely if we stop with the birds would get most of our money back out of them. (Coyote, fox, feral dogs, and raccoons have been the issue around here.)   Also nesting boxes. Hope you have better luck than we did."
BackYardChickens,342iu4,not_whiney,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:52:41 2015 UTC,Very cool - only reason I did it after the walls was so I could rip it out later easier and I figured shoveling might be easier as well cleaning to the edge.   The chain link may work if I can find it cheap enough. I'm doing 12x20 so 64 linear feet.
BackYardChickens,342iu4,rufil-dixon,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:41:04 2015 UTC,The original set we bought was 199 for 4 ten foot sections with a gate. We used the u-bolt type clamps to attach to the front of the coop and made a pentagon. That made a 48 linear foot around run to start. We now have 10 sections.  The other thing you can do with the chain link is in the corners of the fence put roosts for them. They sell the hand rail/banister in unfinished hard wood. They are flat on one side and slide right thru the chain link across the corner to make a nice little roost for them to sun on.

It's either don't let them out, let them out and be responsible, or get an automatic door.  If you don't lock them up, something will eat them. If it doesn't happen the first night, it will soon. Predators have all night every night to check in or work on a meal, it's what they do."
BackYardChickens,3432bm,Jackawolf,3,Tue Apr 28 17:39:21 2015 UTC,Do you have a run?
BackYardChickens,3432bm,bantambird,5,Tue Apr 28 02:09:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm wondering this too. They really should have a run. They shouldn't be locked in a coop all the time."
BackYardChickens,3432bm,MelonHeadSeb,2,Tue Apr 28 02:43:46 2015 UTC,"I guess my terminology is a bit off. They have a small coop inside of a larger chicken wired area (perhaps that's a run?) It's a decent size, but still, I have a pretty green back yard and I think they'd really enjoy foraging and stuff, since there's just dirt in the ""coop."""
BackYardChickens,3432bm,Jackawolf,2,Tue Apr 28 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"The run is the fenced off cage-type thing, whereas the coop should be the house thing that they actually sleep in. They should always be allowed in the run and not just confined to the coop."
BackYardChickens,3432bm,ThisIsPhantomhive,2,Wed Apr 29 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"I have 9 hens and I free range them after work, when I can be outside with them. We have many predators, including hawks, so leaving them out on their own is not a risk I am willing to take. However, I do give them things in their run to keep them amused. I bought a plastic kiddie pool for about $11 and I dig up clumps of grass and weeds. I fill the pool with them and they love scratching through it and eating the bugs and worms. When they are done, the clumps are reduced to clean soil, which I use in my garden or filling holes. I also give them live grasshoppers and crickets to chase, every now and then. They have plenty of perches and objects to roost on.  If you can't give them time outside, at least give them things to forage for and peck at. It's part of their nature and they deserve it."

BackYardChickens,3432bm,WeavesByNightAndDay,2,Wed Apr 29 23:50:52 2015 UTC,You can let them out in the afternoon and they won't get into too much trouble. Say one night just open the run around 6:30. They won't get far enough to want to jump your fence into the neighbors yard because at 8 or 8:30 they will be looking to coop back up.

BackYardChickens,340q4m,Apoplecticmiscreant,2,Mon Apr 27 11:42:06 2015 UTC,"You'll want a small surgical punch or a scalpel, triple antibiotic, (but not with pain relief stuff) betadyne and gloves.  Basically, you end up taking a small corm out of the foot that has formed.  It's an infectious piece of tissue that will not heal on its own, will only get worse with time.  My first time out I had to use a xacto knife, and I do not recommend that.  They are not made for this type of work.  There are many videos out there, with many questionable remedies, so be sure and watch several before trying.  To prevent these issues going forward, make sure they have clean, dry bedding and consider perhaps rethinking your perches, both size and height.  They may be causing foot injuries.  It's really common.  PS-- you'll also need gauze and something called, ""vet wrap"" from the farm store.  Not very expensive, easy to use."

They do have to change it fairly regularly, wash the feet in epsom salt water prior to wrapping.  May take a couple of weeks.    I've seen lots of odd methods they use in Thailand, one uses a big chunk of bar soap under the bandage.    From what I've read, the top issues are keeping their feet relatively dry, especially at night, the height of their perches is important, as well as the litter they walk through.  Personally, I was using perches in my early days that were too narrow, branches from trees.  I corrected by getting thicker branches and a couple of 2x4s. Since I corrected a few of these issues mine seem to have far fewer problems."

They looked great and were packed well, but the jostling and movement of shipping tends to kill at least a few of the early blastoderms.  I used a little giant still air incubator with an auto-turner. I think I should have gotten my own humidity reader because mine just did not pick up on it right and I ended making it way too humid on hatch day. I knew early on though that only four eggs were developing properly, the fourth died around day 18-20. I cracked all ten of the unhatched eggs and only that one went anywhere.

It may pull through, but be prepared for the worst."
BackYardChickens,33yyqy,Thorax_O_Tool,2,Mon Apr 27 01:35:11 2015 UTC,"I recently lost a chick that was refusing to eat, seemed lethargic, had watery poop with clearly undigested bits in it, and threw up what we were able to feed her.  I later realized each day as my other chicks grew bigger my sick one looked smaller.  I don't think she ever ate after hatching, just was running on what she was born with in her system.  I did notice that her crop was full and hard, the only thing big left on her small body.  Not sure if it was impacted, but she had other physical deformities upon birth as well.  So maybe see if your chick also has a large hard crop which could be a sign that nothing is being digested properly."

BackYardChickens,33yyqy,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Apr 27 11:27:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm. If you can, try to build her a separate brooder. I recently made a heated care unit using a plastic storage bin. I laid old towels over the sides, bottom, and top, and laid the lid over it but didn't completely close it so the babies had air. I set a board across the top and clipped the lamp onto that. The box was about 85F air temperature and nearing 100F directly around the light.  I'd also suggest putting Sav-A-Chick electrolytes in her water. Adding SAC probiotics couldn't hurt either. If you don't live close to a feed store, you can mix Gatorade with water instead.  Yes, chickens can throw up. It happens if they're sickly, or if you pick them up right after they've been drinking water. It's usually caused by accidentally pressing on the crop, or tilting them forwards too far."

However, it sounds like they may not be digesting foods correctly. Perhaps ad some grit to their feed or put a dish of it in the coop."
BackYardChickens,33u1so,poorsoi,7,Sat Apr 25 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"Salmonella can seep through to the inside of eggs because the shell is a permeable membrane (this is why a humid environment during hatching is critical). So yes, an infected hen can lay infected eggs. This is why there are still salmonella outbreaks in the US. In Europe they have a salmonella vaccine and have all but eradicated it from egg and poultry productions.    You are correct, though, in backyard flocks salmonella is much more easily noticed. Also, most hatcheries we get our chicks from screen for the bacteria regularly in their laying flock, as do many hobby breeders. Practicing strict biosecurity when introducing new birds to your flock all but eliminates the possibility of salmonella assuming your birds are given appropriate space and are cared for regularly.    I do not suggest sterilizing the outside of your eggs for the very small chance your flock is infected. Eggs have a natural protection called bloom that keeps foreign bacteria not native to the mother hen's system from entering the egg. By sterilizing the egg you are removing that bloom, and the egg will now have to be refrigerated and the shelf life is drastically reduced. If you go to Europe, eggs do not have this bloom removed (because of the use of vaccination) and eggs are sold in the groceries, not the refrigerated section. The US only refrigerates eggs because every commercial egg sold must be sterilized and pasteurized.    Now, personally, I trust my flock. I know every bird is at maximum health and well cared for. I don't and never have worried about cooking eggs completely. I always lick the spoon while baking and I let my kids do it too! Even with commercial eggs, salmonella is extremely rare, and infection almost always occurs in those with weakened immune systems."
BackYardChickens,33u1so,cordial_carbonara,3,Sat Apr 25 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"The US only refrigerates eggs because every commercial egg sold must be sterilized and pasteurized.     This is partially wrong, only egg products are required to be pasteurized.

BackYardChickens,33u1so,PM_ME_FACTS,3,Sat Apr 25 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"Yes. The system here is instead of required flock wide vaccination, the chickens are removed if they show any signs of being sick. But since they could be sick and not showing it yet while laying further precautions are used. In America the eggs are washed and air dryer to remove any outter contamination that could cause infection. This removes the 'cuticle' or waxy outer coating that protects the egg. Since this makes the shell then be more porous and able to transmit disease, they are refrigerated. Eggs in Europe aren't washed so still have coating. If you know your chickens aren't sick you don't have worry. You can refrigerate or not. But if you choose to wet wash, you have to put in fridge."

Materials (i.e. usually styrofoam incubators < hard plastic incubators) Energy Used   Personally, I always buy Brinseas. They're kinda the Cadillac of incubators, and I'm fortunate to be able to afford them. There are more expensive brands out there, but it's not worth the extra $200 just so you can get a 100% hatch rate as opposed to 90% with a Brinsea.  I always prefer automatic turning incubators. Everyone does. It takes time to turn the eggs by hand twice a day, whereas with a automatic bator you just add water every couple days.  Size is also really important. Most people only need a single small incibator, like a Mini Advance, which holds 7 eggs. I have two because I run a larger operation; a Mini and an Octagon 20 DX. The Mini was bought for me as a gift. I chose to buy the Octagon because it was a great, medium sized Brinsea, with simple controls and a turning cradle. The original price was about $300 but I got the incubator + a candler second hand from a thrift store, for $150.  Materials are usually what I judge an incubator on. Hard plastic is fantastic, and that's what the best incubators are made out of (excluding Redwood incubators, I hear they are an absolute dream). Others made out of styrofoam or cheap plastic work, but not usually very well.  Incubators don't use a huge amount of energy, so for most people it doesn't matter, but my house runs on solar panels and we have a limited quantity of energy. This is another reason I love Brinseas. They're fantasticly energy-efficient; my Mini uses 13-18 watts and my Octagon 22-28. It's lovely.  I may have missed something but there are some ogre lost important points, to me.

The more water surface area you can get in there, the higher the humidity will be. If you put a paper towel stretching from the water well out along the bottom of the incubator, the humidity will be much higher than if you just toss a small sponge or jar of water in there, for example."
BackYardChickens,33sean,bantambird,1 point,Sat Apr 25 10:20:20 2015 UTC,"I use an ice cube tray in mine. It gives lots of surface area, and is easy to control the humidity with by filling/emptying cube holes."
BackYardChickens,33q9ug,Grimsterr,3,Fri Apr 24 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's always deaths when you hatch yourself. Some just aren't strong enough to make it out of the shell, others refuse to thrive after they do. Just yesterday I had to bring a turkey poult back from the brink of death, she's a very lucky one, although I'm still not sure she's going to make it. That's why I always put in as many eggs as I can fit, my incubator has only 50% hatch rates and out of 40 eggs I got 20something developing and 16 chicks at hatch. Most of my Silkies were unable to hatch for some reason, I lost three or four who died after pipping.  I'm sorry for your loss."
BackYardChickens,33q9ug,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I broke the ""don't help them"" rule on this chick, he pipped and zipped about 1/5 of the way around the egg then just set there for the rest of the day, I finally just finished his zipping and put him back in the incubator, he sat there struggling periodically to get out but not getting there so I picked up the egg and he just slipped out.  The other chick I helped out (he never even pipped but I felt him moving) I noticed was up and active quite a bit faster than this chick was.  This one also kept having pasty butt we had to clean.  My theory is he just had a kink or other blockage in his intestines."

BackYardChickens,33q9ug,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"Well, the best you can do is make sure to keep the temperature a little low and the humidity nice and high, and only ever help them if its been more than, say, 26-28 hours since they pipped and they still aren't out. It's not guaranteed that you'll lose some, especially if your hatch isn't very large, but its good to prepare yourself just in case. Good luck!"

BackYardChickens,33qhuk,frugalNOTcheap,3,Fri Apr 24 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"They will consume or harass every green thing to death within the fenced space in a few weeks at most. Our run is about 40' x 20' and not even the most stubborn weeds can grow more than an inch high in there. You could create some forage, though.   Whenever I mow, weed, or rake leaves I throw all of the greens in there for them to munch on and scratch through. I keep two compost bins in the run and I just move the lid back and forth so they can pick through one while the other one ages. This is also handy because their poopy wood shavings make great nitrogen filler for compost. All of our kitchen scraps except for meat go in the bin, which amounts to about one big bowl per day. Varied snacks for them, less waste and free compost for us. Leave a log in there and roll it over every couple of days so they can feast on the bugs.   Just a tip, if you do let your girls out and don't want to track them down, it helps to just let them out during the last couple hours of the day. This way they'll coop themselves back up before wandering too far. Last year we'd let ours free-range all day, but given enough time they'd occasionally wander onto a neighboring property or find nighttime shelter apart from the coop.  Good luck!"
BackYardChickens,33qhuk,poorsoi,2,Sun Apr 26 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"At first, absolutely, but they will stomp and eat the grass down to bare dirt in very little time. I recently enlarged my run to include a 40x10 foot patch of land, covered with 5-12 inch tall grass and weeds, and it took them about 1 month to completely clear it."
BackYardChickens,33qhuk,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Apr 24 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I was worried 12 inch grass would be too high for them; that I would need to weed eat it first.  I have a semi-permanent fence so I can move them around the pastures. If rounding them up is worth it."
BackYardChickens,33qhuk,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Apr 24 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"No, they love having cover. Heck; I bet if there was a way to grow that 10 foot tall elephant grass they have in Africa, it would just be a dream for chickens.  Six chickens is no problem to round up, unless you're getting a real wily breed(s)."
BackYardChickens,33qhuk,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:46:02 2015 UTC,Any tips on rounding them up? Do you just chase em down? Or do you lure them in with a treat?  Here I was thinking I needed to get some goats to eat down some of these pastures I have.
BackYardChickens,33qhuk,hectorinwa,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"I like to chase mine into the coop and close the door, then catch them once inside. A long, thin stick works great to help herd them, use it just like an extension of your arm to block them from turning around and running behind you or to gently boop them on the rump if they aren't moving. Treats work if they're tame enough that you can sneak up on them from behind while they're eating, but a scared bird will see you coming a mile away."

If you feed them a treat every time you call them, they'll start coming when called. If you chase them, they'll always mistrust you. Move slowly and carry a good bag/handful of treats and they'll follow you wherever you go."

BackYardChickens,33pmht,annoyingone,0,Fri Apr 24 14:25:05 2015 UTC,Front door. We keep the door open during the day and they are free to roam around but crows have figured there are eggs inside.
BackYardChickens,33pmht,annoyingone,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"Is this a full sized door for people or a chicken door?  If a full sized door you may have to look at closing that and making a smaller 18""x18"" door for the chickens."

BackYardChickens,33p5mh,my_neck_and_my_back,2,Fri Apr 24 10:47:38 2015 UTC,"I would contact the hatchery and ask them directly. They would have to disclose any information about infections in their flocks. I called McMurray (also based in Iowa and I received chicks from them in mid-March) and they offered to email me copies of their tests from the month my chicks hatched, apparently they test their flocks monthly for both AI and Salmonella. I don't know much about Hoover Hatchery, but I'd feel safe ordering from McMurray again.    Everything I'm reading is saying this strain is killing quickly, within 48 hours, so I imagine in new chicks they probably wouldn't even make it to you if they were infected (also why it's a much bigger deal for larger operations with closely housed chickens). If you practice strict biosecurity measures by quarantining your chicks and only handling them minimally for the first week or two and washing your hands and any clothing that comes into contact with them before visiting your existing flock, you'll know very soon if your chicks have been infected. It seems the bigger problem right now for backyard flocks is with wild birds in the area spreading it to them."
BackYardChickens,33p5mh,cordial_carbonara,2,Fri Apr 24 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"I contacted the hatchery and this is what they said:  ""Avian flu does not affect hatcheries.

BackYardChickens,33p5mh,cordial_carbonara,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:54:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, it kinda makes sense assuming the hatchery is separate from the breeding operation. 21 days in the incubator is going to kill off pretty much anything that wasn't transferred through the egg (avian flu is not), assuming the hatchery practices even decent biosecurity there's a very very slim to none chance the chicks could be infected."
BackYardChickens,33p5mh,AppleSpicer,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:42:47 2015 UTC,Well I was lucky enough to buy chicks right before it hit the news and some came from Iowa. I called all the hatcheries and luckily they've all been super screened and determined clean and are also taking precautions. Someone also explained to me that the bird flu mostly hit the fertilized egg laying facilities bad who then supply the hatcheries with eggs so the flu is one step removed from people who buy chicks.   Personally if I had an existing flock I would wait until it's all clear but if not then I would take the risk or wait another month until things settle down a bit more.
BackYardChickens,33p5mh,AppleSpicer,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:54:04 2015 UTC,"Excellent, thank you!  What hatchery in Iowa did you buy from? The chicks I'm thinking about buying are from Hoover's Hatchery."
BackYardChickens,33p5mh,GallusLafayetti,2,Fri Apr 24 15:57:50 2015 UTC,I bought mine at a feed store but one came from Welp Hatchery in Iowa.

He started with leghorns but they all died of disease and were larger than mine.   That PDF was very helpful! ""indigenous chickens (Ethiopian) are not classified into specific breeds; rather they are heterogeneous in phenotype and probably also in genotype.""  That was what I thought, seems Ethiopian chickens are just random mutts. So the type in my town might not even be genetically the same as the chickens the next town over. :(  That makes sense when I find other papers studying the chickens; they list the breeds; tukur, natch, and kie. Which probably someone local told them because those are literally just colors; black, white and red.

BackYardChickens,33jjaw,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:25:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your friend had a lot of roosters. That sounds like pretty classic feather loss due to inappropriate rooster to hen ratios, and she's hiding in the coop because it's habit; hens quickly learn its the best place to hide from roosters. You need to buy some Pick-No-More lotion and apply it to the bare areas immediately before your other birds begin to cannibalize her.  FYI, never introduce a bird into your flock without quarantining for 2-6 weeks first. You may get lucky a few times, but eventually  your birds will get a disease."

My chickens are fenced and I have a separate pen/run for when I want to separate. Wouldn't be all that bad to let the birds in the pen have some grass time on a leash.
BackYardChickens,33dwl9,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:48:53 2015 UTC,Each rooster has a 7 ft cord and a sort of a hut to roost on. They are rotated between the cord and pens.

Mostly among the Hispanic and Filipino populations, but plenty of other people are in it, as well. It's like anything else. If something is popular, banning it doesn't make it cease to exist.   I used to rent a farm from a little Filipina lady whose nephew had over 250 stags on ties here in America and another 600+ in the Philippines."

And these birds are obviously not being cared for by a loving breeder. It's frustrating, but there's not anything law enforcement can do unless I know where the actual fights are taking place since they are ""livestock."""
BackYardChickens,33dwl9,onlyone21,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:02:27 2015 UTC,I can understand that. They have a very rich history but it's also very bloody. I tell people I raise fighting breeds and they give me this look and I have to quickly explain they're for only for ornamental purposes. I just love the look and the spirit of a game.
BackYardChickens,33dwl9,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Tue Apr 21 23:36:26 2015 UTC,Exactly. I know how bully dog owners feel. They have a rich history but we wouldn't have these beautiful animals with such a game spirit if it were not for the breeders of the past.
BackYardChickens,33dwl9,ThunderOrb,2,Tue Apr 21 23:39:12 2015 UTC,"Well said. A game that doesn't have a game attitude is no game at all. Sure, it makes raising them harder because they need to be separated, and I'd never want my cocks or hens to hurt each other, but there's something majestic about seeing the puff up their hackles or jump or posture at each other through the fence. They're truly magnificent."

BackYardChickens,33f91s,Hang-Em-High,5,Wed Apr 22 01:14:56 2015 UTC,Mine are a year old and every night 3-4 will put themselves up in the coop while 1 or 2 will perch up in a particular bush in our yard. So every night when I'm closing the coop up I have to check the bush and take those with me.  It used to be annoying but its kind of our fun routine now. And the bush girls chirp like chicks when I come to get them....makes me all fuzzy.

BackYardChickens,33f91s,Zebba_Odirnapal,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:07:31 2015 UTC,About a week.
BackYardChickens,33f91s,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Wed Apr 22 02:28:33 2015 UTC,Ok. Well maybe try picking them up and putting them in the coop right at sunset for a few evenings in a row? Once it gets dark they'll naturally want to hunker down. Make sure they know where to go. Sometimes the sun will set and birds will get caught out and not realize where to go.
BackYardChickens,33f91s,Jackawolf,2,Wed Apr 22 02:58:00 2015 UTC,I did at least 2 weeks. Maybe that's why?
BackYardChickens,33f91s,Grimsterr,2,Wed Apr 22 03:55:42 2015 UTC,"Happens sometimes, if I catch one perching outside of the house, I just put them in it, if it goes on night after night I'll lock them in the house for a day and that usually re-homes them back to roosting in the house.  I had a particular black Poland rooster who would perch outside a LOT, I quit worrying with him during summer but when winter came I just locked them in there for 2 days and that fixed his roosting."
BackYardChickens,33fkzb,I_ATE_TODAY,2,Wed Apr 22 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"Lock them in the coop for a week. Also, you can bribe them with black oil sunflower seeds (BOSS) and use that to reward being inside at night"

BackYardChickens,33g1km,devoskitchen,2,Wed Apr 22 05:42:59 2015 UTC,in my experience is chickens have no interest in slugs.  I hear ducks do.  I have had my chickens get into my garden and drink up my slug trap beer tho.  maybe slugs soaking in beer will entice them.

In a group of 5-10 there's a significant increase in noise, whereas when I get my yearly spring order of 60-80 chicks they are surprisingly quiet. It has to do with chickens' flocking instinct. As babies they are much happier in large numbers.  I've also noticed they make more noise if they are cold. Are they huddling at all, or inactive? If so, move the heating lamp closer to them."

Before bringing them inside for a warm slumber party, here they are getting some time playing jungle chicken in their garden. Once they're older I trust this area will become a wasteland. For now though, they're having so much fun playing jungle chicken in waist high grain. It's just a feed plot mix from my local co-op: crimson clover, oats, wheat and daikon. Also got some volunteer wild onions and lamium, aka henbit. Good stuff for off-season cover crops, and fun forage for all kinds of critters."

I had to help the last two though as they simply weren't doing their thing after waiting a day.  5 (4 black 1 wheaten) were born Friday night and the 6th was pipped but never finished, the 7th I could feel movement but no signs of hatching so Saturday night I went ahead and helped them out, seems like they're doing ok though."

Best site I've found so far to describe Marans genetics is this one  Idk how much that helps, really. But maybe this (below) is what happened? And would that mean that one of your birds has brown/black alleles?  ""The use of Brown-Red birds in crossings with only one Black bird to regenerate a Black breeding line is not recommended for two reasons. Firstly because the ""copper"" gene (s+/s+) will introduce a range of unwanted gold/red tones, and the recessive Birchen allele which can often be visually expressed in the hens.""  I'd be really curious to see pictures of your breeding birds. And I'd love to see your set-up for breeding if youd be willing to share (or link to similar). And also if you know anything more on chicken breeding/genetics, I'm always ready to learn!"

BackYardChickens,335d05,Probablythefirst,5,Sun Apr 19 19:17:15 2015 UTC,Why do you say that? Chicken can swim.. Also it doesn't look PS'd.
BackYardChickens,335d05,ChickenOfDoom,-1,Mon Apr 20 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty good photoshop, but there are a few things that make me think it is one. There are no ripples or visible disturbances of any kind in the water around the chickens. Almost every picture of a bird in water will have some ripples or a wake. The outlines look a little off, and the boundary between the back left chicken and the water is a very abrupt straight line in a weird place. Those chickens look very relaxed; while they can swim, I think it would be really unusual for a chicken to sit floating in a pool just to hang out. Their feathers appear completely dry above the waterline; this is normal for waterfowl because they have oils on their feathers that keep them dry, but chickens aren't waterproof and would certainly get more wet than that in a pool.  I just found out that this is part of a much larger set of photos and now I feel less sure just because of how much work it would have taken to fake all those. That picture still seems very suspicious to me though."
BackYardChickens,335d05,yourfuneralpyre,4,Mon Apr 20 06:24:36 2015 UTC,Definitely not photoshopped unless it was a true master who spent hours and hours on it. The feet below the water in refracted light and even the yellow ish reflection in the water would be extremely hard to make look realistic to the point of not being worth it.

BackYardChickens,334qa7,Zebba_Odirnapal,4,Sun Apr 19 16:30:14 2015 UTC,Use any softwood other than cedar. Hardwood can harbor aspergillis. Cedar is toxic.

As for the heat lamp, use one with a red light and notice how they are around it. If they're all grouped under it, the lamp may be too high. If they're scattered away from the lamp, it may be too low. If you don't really notice anything then they should be fine. Hope this helps!"

BackYardChickens,334uhk,clever-nom-de-guerre,2,Tue Apr 21 16:53:30 2015 UTC,"I know there are quite a few who prefer nipple waterers, because spilled water can make a soggy mess of pine shavings and chickens love to spill water, but I can't bear to because I'm neurotic about my chickens getting enough water. There's a solid advantage in nipple waterers, but hens who get their water from the nipple waterer spend twice as long drinking each day (2-3% vs 6%) and still get less water than with other methods of drinkers, and this can be seen in how dry their droppings are comparatively to bell or fount drinking waterers. But there are many chicken owners out there wo have had perfect success with their nipple waterer, and so I'd just suggest you try whatever method out you feel is best. Chickens each need about 200 mL of water a day (more when it's hotter), so you could grab a quart sized waterer and call it good."
BackYardChickens,334uhk,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:46:31 2015 UTC,"I've never used a nipple waterer so I can't comment on how well they work, although I do hear that they keep the bedding in the coop very dry.  A 5-gallon waterer and a 12-pound feeder should work fine for a flock of four. You could use smaller (2 gallon waterer, 5 pound feeder, etc.) but you would have to fill them more often."

Cats usually take their kill with them and I have never seen one take anything older than a chick, and that was a feral cat.   If you found remains with the head missing, it's a raccoon. They start at the head. Raccoons are everywhere, they can fit into small places like cats, and they are tenacious little bastards. I just had this exact thing happen and it was a raccoon - caught him red-handed. If there are people around, there are raccoons.   Word to the wise - that beast WILL return. Once they learn where an easy meal is they will come back until you have no more birds left. Tighten up your security, do a head count every night, reinforce chicken wire with hardware cloth, and seal up any holes or cracks in your coops with wood and expanding foam insulation. You could also trap them, use cat food as bait and then call animal control to come and dispatch them."

Zip ties may be easy for a bored or determined animal to gnaw off. A padlock is secure, but I never had a problem with a raccoon opening up a heavy-duty D-ring, FWIW.   I use leftover bits of 2x4 farm fence wire as twist ties for this type of thing. As you have the cage currently should be safe for short-term use.  Good luck!"

Beside that, I had a great feeling of satisfaction letting my girls out into something of my own making for the first time!

I have one but I don't trust it much, it'll keep most of the predators out but one determined coyote or dog and whatever's in it is gonna be lunch.  If you buy, get on craigslist or something like that and find someone locally who builds them by hand out of 2x4's and real wire.  Here's one near me I've been looking at for a 2nd flock: http://huntsville.craigslist.org/grd/4970279568.html  I bought my henhouse ($140) and put it in a 12x12x6 chain link dog kennel, then I put chicken wire over the top of it (fucking raccoons).  EVERY single time I put out my raccoon trap around the kennel, I catch one, or an opossum within a night or two with minimal bait.

BackYardChickens,32zh3q,Azorax,3,Sat Apr 18 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"Could be picking but it looks like most of her feathers are growing back, so I'm guessing it's a really, really ugly molt. Put her on a higher protien feed if possible (organic chick starter works great as it is usually not medicated) and that will help her grow her feathers back. If they disappear again, it's probably picking, and you should apply Pick-No-More lotion to the affected areas and find and remove the aggressor."
BackYardChickens,32zh3q,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:48:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I'm hoping it's just a bad molt, as a few of them have done the same thing recently, though not to this extent. Should I get them an extra bag of Sunflower seeds to mix in? It has helped their coats in the past, so worth a try.  Also, it's a home flock so I can't/won't get rid of any, though I may have to separate her for a couple of days."
BackYardChickens,32zh3q,GallusLafayetti,2,Sun Apr 19 03:25:06 2015 UTC,"Sunflower seeds (especially the black ones) will give them extra energy and can make the feathers grow in shinier and fuller. However, the best tool for feather growth is a high protien feed. Anything from 18 to 20% total. Organic (non-medicated) chick starters or specialized molting rations are ideal.  I'm always concerned when people say they can't or won't rehome birds. I understand that not everyone is willing or capable of making a problem bird into BBQ, but for someone to balk at the idea of finding the bird a more suitable home is not a good sign. If a bird presents a problem that can't be fixed, steps such as rehoming should be taken to ensure the safety and health of the flock.  Now, I'm not saying you should post an ad on Craigslist the second you discover your feather picker, and I'm not trying to start a fight. I'm not even saying your current issue is feather picking! But for future reference: if you take measures such as temporary separation and reintroduction, or use of peepers, and these do not work after several attempts, rehoming should always be the last-resort option. It may be sad to say goodbye to a bird you love, but if she is causing a problem within the flock and causing injury/unhappiness to the other birds, you should always put the health of the flock first."
BackYardChickens,32zdwk,LaBellem88,2,Sat Apr 18 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I can't say I know what's wrong, but I've got a Cornish roo with a similar problem.

Most repository diseases begin to show in chicks older than one week, anyways. Additionally, respiratory diseases are in fact very bad news. They can wipe out a whole flock and cost a lot of money to treat (or a lot of heartache to depopulate).  Heavy breathing/lethargy are symptoms of quite a few things. The chick could be overheating, it could have been injured, it could be stressed, or it could just be a weak bird - not all chicks will survive to become adults.  Make sure it's feed is medicated, put some Sav-A-Chick electrolytes in its water, and if the other chicks are being too rambunctious, you may want to give it its own separate brooder for the time being."

BackYardChickens,32xvvz,alagary,2,Fri Apr 17 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"I've been feeding my flock scraps for years. There's rarely a day I don't toss something out the kitchen door to them. They've eaten fruit, veggies, roots, bread, meat, fish, dairy and lots of eggs. They free range over a couple acres and also scavenge all kinds of greens, bugs, garden goodies and the occasional small mouse. I work at a restaurant on Saturdays and bring them a bucket full of scraps and plate scrapings for a Sunday feast (and sell eggs back to the restaurant). About the only things from my kitchen that make it into the compost pile are coffee grounds and hot peppers. The chickens just pick everything else out the compost pile anyway. The only thing I don't like to feed them is chicken."

BackYardChickens,32xry7,jsmith65,2,Fri Apr 17 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know about chickens, but there is a channel called Guinea Fowl TV which has both educational and hilarious videos about guinea fowl.  Shameless self promotion: I also run a tumblr blog about chickens (and other poultry), and I recently made a YouTube channel under the same name - it's not active yet, but over the course of the next few months I will hopefully have time to make and post some educational videos concerning the care/raising of poultry, as well as a couple fun extras/funny clips."
BackYardChickens,32xry7,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:31:17 2015 UTC,Really liking you're tumblr blog. Those peacock's are beautiful!!! What has you're experience keeping peacock's been like? Would you recommend it?
BackYardChickens,32xry7,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:25:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I work hard to make it a good blog.  Yeah, Ming and Icey are very pretty birds, Ming's even started fanning for us recently but I haven't been able to photograph it yet (he's camera shy).  Um, well I can say peas definitely are not for everyone. First of all, peafowl are kind of... well, asses. They fly around, jump around, honk (sounds like a car horn) when they get upset, jump onto and scratch up cars/houses/basically anything, and they are very strong. When you first begin to handle them, you will probably get hurt at least a few times. Their spurs and claws are incredibly sharp.  I would recommend it to someone with a large property and a tolerance for stupid birds. Keeping them confined is a pain in the ass. They can jump up to 12 feet with a wing clipped, so if you want to keep them confined you need to build a pen with a covered/netted roof. If you buy adults or juveniles, keeping them confined for the first 4-6 months is a necessity, as they have strong homing instincts and they will try to return to their original home.  The easiest way to keep peas is to let them free range and roost in trees, but during the breeding season you may lose hens who attempt to brood on the ground.  They are also expensive. We paid $400 for this pair, specifically because of the coloring. Ming is a pied and Icey is a white, which is a pairing that will only produce white or pied chicks - valuable colors.  For a regular India Blue, you can expect to pay between $20-$40 for a peachick, $75-$100 for an adolescent cock or hen, and upwards of $100 once they get into adult plumage, i.e. trains etc. (which they don't grow until approx. 3 years of age). Price varies through other varieties, but follows the same basic idea of ""the older they are, the more expensive they'll be"".  They also don't fit in your average chicken coop, because of the whole 6-foot-long tail thing. I keep mine in a 16x16 coop with chickens, turkeys, and guineas.  One more thing: Peas are a long term commitment. They can live upwards of 40 years in captivity.  So, in summary: they are a pain in the ass and pretty expensive, but honestly, it's kind of worth it just to have them, because they really are beautiful."
