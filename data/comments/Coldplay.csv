More like these first 7 albums were all connected in some way, maybe with a certain idea or musical approach. Maybe the next albums to come after LP7 will be a new era for Coldplay."

From what I could gather from other interviews the rest of the band felt that song was out of place and shouldn't have been on Ghost Stories.  I dunno, I could maybe see him doing solo stuff maybe years from now."
Coldplay,3dqsvt,mormonminion,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:09:52 2015 UTC,"The song was pure crap and was definitely out of place. An amazing song like Ghost Story should have been on the album, but people just say that it was out of place due to it not being a sad love song like the rest of the songs, but isn't ASFOS also not incredibly out of place too?"
Coldplay,3dqsvt,Averdian,3,Sun Jul 19 11:06:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's out of place at all. It's that moment in Ghost Stories where the main character finally breaks through to the other side of all the heartache that came before. Here's what Chris had to say about it:   ""I know that this song in this point in the album needs to be called 'A Sky Full of Stars' because it needs to be about unconditional love. And I know that in a concert, if we're playing this whole album, there'll be a point where you're like 'OK, I got that out of my system. Now let's go dancing.'""   Source"
Coldplay,3dqsvt,MattNOYB,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:44 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but I can name many Coldplay songs that can make me jump up and down that are actually good songs. Maybe ASFOS is not a crap song as I stated earlier, but I see it as one of the worst songs they have put out. Even though it is a good pop song, it is subpar to Coldplay's previous work."
Coldplay,3dqsvt,Averdian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from. My problem is that it 0% feels like an actual Coldplay song. It's more like something from an Avicii album that Chris just did the vocals for. I'm not against collaboration between artists, but the point of a collab is to see the two distinct elements from both artists (Avicii and Coldplay) play off of each other in interesting ways. In ASFOS it feels like you're hearing one artist and no input from the other, so the end result can't help but be pretty damn bland."
Coldplay,3dqsvt,SpaceKaddett,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"That's also what I feel like. It is an ok pop song, as I said earlier, but it   Doesn't feel like a Coldplay song Doesn't reach the quality of their other songs (in my opinion obviously). Doesn't fit in on the album Ghost Stories (also my opinion)."
Coldplay,3dqsvt,Averdian,0,Sun Jul 19 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"My opinion on AFOS is that if it was a stand alone single (not on GS), or even apart of Avicii's new album, I would have been okay with it. The fact that it was on GS is what I find most disappointing."

Coldplay,3di0ps,atomuk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents:  Thank you so much for only having 10 songs. Almost all comments are 20 songs, and it's really hard to get a good overview on.  I love the idea with Postcards From Far Away as an album opener! Amazing and unique!  Death And All His Friends needs to be the last song. The Escapist is simply too beautiful for anything to follow it up - what I'm saying is that it is, imo, the best album closer of all time and that it can only work as as the closer.  A Message doesn't really fit in there. I can't put my finger on it, but I think it's too... happy? I don't know, put something like See You Soon in there if you are going for the melancholy theme.  Lastly, this is overall a really beautiful list, and you did a great job.  EDIT: Maybe a song like I Bloom Blaum or maybe even Reign of Love (even though it can't be picked without also having Lovers In Japan) could make the list."

Coldplay,3cj1fw,DundahMifflin,21,Wed Jul 8 08:08:24 2015 UTC,"It's a great song, and you are 100% correct that Coldplay does simple extremely well. Many of my absolute favorite Coldplay songs are very basic musically, such as Till Kingdom Come and O.    I've always found the first part of the song a bit odd in relation to the second part; they're somewhat different from each other and the transition between them never clicked with me all the way. It reminds me a bit of 42 in that sense, though that song is much more extreme in its duality and I don't like it nearly as much as Up With the Birds.    Also, how incredible are Coldplay's album closers in general?    Everything's Not Lost / (Life is For Living) Amsterdam Till Kingdom Come Death and All His Friends / (The Escapist) Up With The Birds O    All six are in the top ~10% of Coldplay songs in my opinion, and Amsterdam and Till Kingdom Come are my personal #1 and #2 favorite song by the band. Up With The Birds is probably my least favorite song on that list, which is crazy considering how good it is. These guys know how to finish strong."
Coldplay,3cj1fw,Silverflash-x,4,Wed Jul 8 09:07:00 2015 UTC,Holy shit...yess I absolutely love all those songs for the same reason! I've even learned O and Amsterdam on the piano. Can't listen to Amsterdam without tearing up...so powerful.
Coldplay,3cj1fw,Aiph,11,Wed Jul 8 12:43:34 2015 UTC,"There's not a tiny little bit of my existence that can understand why Up With The Birds is so underrated. Only perhaps because it's on the ""infamous"" Mylo Xyloto (for the record, I personally absolutely love the album), but I don't feel like this specific song even shares many characteristics for which MX gets criticized. On its own, it's an amazing, powerful song with a beautiful melody and strong lyrics - and its cleverness and intensity get even more prominent when put in context as a closer of MX and the story it narrates.   As u/Silverflash-x mentioned, Coldplay know how to do their closers. There's not a single album-ending song from them that wouldn't make me shiver (don't you shiveeeeer... ♫) and I consider Up With The Birds as the best one of those amazing six. It just perfectly follows Don't Let It Break You Heart, which expresses strength and positivity through people's hardest times, and continues with a message of determination and hope.   It's so motivating. As pretty much every other Coldplay song, it's open to interpretation - but it still remains so happy that what makes me want to shed a tear the most is the strength of the feelings it reminds me of. While Amsterdam has a melancholic feel to it (as practically the whole AROBTTH), Up With The Birds is encouraging, optimistic and colourful.  Amazing, unique song. Full stop. And those bird sounds, oh, those bird sounds. I call upon all of you to stop whatever you're doing, let that roast beef in the oven, let your kids play with those matches, go play MX right now and appreciate its beauty.  P.S. To be honest, this song is also very personal to me, as I am in a happy long-distance relationship and that's where the lyrics ""fly all over the world just to see her again"" get their literal meaning :)."
Coldplay,3cj1fw,MrTheRiedl,3,Wed Jul 8 10:18:13 2015 UTC,"There's not a tiny little bit of my existence that can understand why Up With The Birds is so underrated. Only perhaps because it's on the ""infamous"" Mylo Xyloto   Had this song been the closer on any other album, I have no doubt Up With The Birds would be a very popular song within the Coldplay fanbase. It seems to me people heard Paradise and Princess of China, assumed the entire album was like that, and missed out on a great album. It's a shame too, because musically and lyrically, it's absolutely one of Coldplay's best."
Coldplay,3cj1fw,RPast,6,Wed Jul 8 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"The subtle violin in the background during the piano piece at the end really hits hard for me. In all honesty, I can easily say that it is one of my top 3 favorite Coldplay songs, and is severely underrated by most. It is such an uplifting, hope-inspiring song that has gotten me through a lot these past few years. Such a perfect way to end an album."

Coldplay,3cekp8,SageC_Random12,9,Tue Jul 7 08:25:21 2015 UTC,"Lost+. All of the versions are really enjoyable with their different approaches to such a great, meaningful song, but Lost+ just feels the most complete. I'm not the biggest fan of Jay-Z, but his rapping part fits in the song really well and elaborates on the Lost's message.   On the other hand though, I'm glad it was released separately on Prospekt's March and not on Viva la Vida. The rather calming and motivational feel of Lost! makes it a great transition between energetic Cemeteries of London and 42, whereas Lost+ has a lot more energy on its own and thus would stand out. But maybe that's just me and how much I'm used to hearing rap-free Lost! when listening to Viva :).  BTW does anyone know why that is? Why Lost+ was released separately and Jay-Z's rap wasn't a part of Lost! in the first place?"
Coldplay,3cekp8,MrTheRiedl,0,Tue Jul 7 13:18:54 2015 UTC,Because Coldplay hadn't Lost the plot yet. They are a strong enough band to not need collaborations to sell their main work and should instead leave that stuff to B-sides (like they did with Lost+).

Right now we're Up In Flames but please Don't Let it Break Your Heart. The Hardest Part of this community (all of reddit) is trying to keep everything well and organized.

Aiko was one of many songs from the MX-era that never saw the light of day, and to think that it quietly just shows up almost four years later screams fake to me.  Coldplaying jumped on the bandwagon without even looking to see if it were a Jon Hopkins track from Live 2012, and instead just copied it from the original source.

Coldplay,3b3huf,josh21218,8,Thu Jun 25 17:46:48 2015 UTC,Slid this right in between DLIBYH and Up With the Birds..... so many reasons that works!
Coldplay,3b3huf,ehzoolpoe,5,Thu Jun 25 20:41:15 2015 UTC,This sounds amazing! When was this made?
Coldplay,3b3huf,gamehelp16,3,Thu Jun 25 21:15:29 2015 UTC,It's from the MX era.
Coldplay,3b3huf,IJetfire,5,Thu Jun 25 21:25:45 2015 UTC,"Kinda reminded me of the song ""Time"" by Hans Zimmer."
Coldplay,3b3huf,hholbrook,5,Fri Jun 26 04:24:47 2015 UTC,Forever hoping for a full album of ambient tracks. They always nail it!
Coldplay,3b3huf,TankBearz,3,Thu Jun 25 23:38:51 2015 UTC,Someone pointed out in the comments on Youtube that it's likely actually a rework (either by the band or Jon Hopkins) of the chords from 2.22 in Major Minus. It is very very similar.
Coldplay,3b3huf,SpaceKaddett,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:12:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds like a Jon Hopkins rework, I'd put my money on that. Still a cool song though!"
Coldplay,3b3huf,SaintTriangleFace,3,Tue Jun 30 05:42:05 2015 UTC,What a beautiful little track. Hope we get some similar vibes on the next album.
Coldplay,3b3huf,TankBearz,3,Sat Jun 27 15:17:26 2015 UTC,Is this available for download anywhere? It's honestly beautiful.
Coldplay,3b3huf,Cookie_For_ME,3,Sat Jun 27 22:01:04 2015 UTC,Seconded. I need this in my life right now.
Coldplay,3b3huf,TankBearz,3,Sun Jun 28 01:26:27 2015 UTC,Dexynboy on Coldplaying made it from cleaning up the audio from Will's interview. He does a lot more edits and he remasters some tracks aswell!  You can download them from here: http://www.coldplaying.com/forum/threads/103814-Dexynboy-s-Edits  Be sure to thank him as well!!!

Coldplay,3b3huf,DundahMifflin,2,Mon Jun 29 16:37:36 2015 UTC,How do we know that's actually Aiko? Did the Oracle confirm it or something?
Coldplay,3b3huf,Cabbaggio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm curious too. I am constantly on the hunt for this stuff and I've never heard of an ""official"" finding of Aiko."
Coldplay,3b3huf,DundahMifflin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I don't think this is actually Aiko. I've never seen anyone provide an official source confirming it as Aiko, and I've never seen Colplaying talk about it."
Coldplay,3b3huf,Cabbaggio,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. Whenever new lost tracks are discovered, it's a pretty big deal on Coldplaying. Something about this one doesn't ""feel"" like Coldplay, and considering it's somehow flown under the radar this long feels weird."

Coldplay,3arsat,Noxate,5,Tue Jun 23 03:59:36 2015 UTC,I love Jay Z and Coldplay so I definitely fell in love with this one. Understandable if others don't feel the same way because the song puts two artists with totally different listeners together.
Coldplay,3arsat,DundahMifflin,4,Tue Jun 23 02:38:20 2015 UTC,"In hindsight, this was the first song that ended up getting me into rap. I've always preferred this version to the original release, too. Great remix!"
Coldplay,3arsat,Timothy-H,3,Tue Jun 23 05:59:17 2015 UTC,"As wonderful as the guitar is on the original Lost, the version with Jay-Z is my favorite"

Coldplay,3arsat,TheCarterIII,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"Jay-Z only did this song because Chris Martin did Homecoming with Kanye West. Kanye and Jay were in a bit of a feud at the time, so he was trying to one up him"
Coldplay,3arsat,Noxate,2,Tue Jun 23 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know about any feud, but I think the song was Beach Chair by Jay Z from his Kingdom Come album that Chris was featured on.   From a Kanye song, ""Big Brother"":  ""I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay (Homecoming), next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay, back of my mind i'm like ""no way"" translate espanol no way jose""   I think Kanye was humbled that Jay liked his choice of a feature and emulated Kanye's choice. Kanye looked up (and still does) to Jay Z."
Coldplay,3arsat,Qorinthian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:15:14 2015 UTC,"If I'm correct, Jay-Z also produced an album where he rapped over every song on the Viva album. Let me see if I can find them...  edit: I was wrong, it's a mash-up album called Viva la Hova."

Coldplay,3adkrw,Dustygusher,10,Fri Jun 19 07:39:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah it'll be a 1.5-1.75 years between albums, almost half of what it has taken before. I guess that's the positive to them only doing a couple small shows for a tour."
Coldplay,3adkrw,Spartan1799,6,Fri Jun 19 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"I completely believe they are near completed with the album, especially with the Ghost Stories tour being so short. I'll be surprised if we don't get the first single by the end of the year."
Coldplay,3adkrw,DundahMifflin,3,Fri Jun 19 22:40:13 2015 UTC,They didn't go on a world tour after Ghost Stories. That's why this is coming out sooner because they were back in the studio sooner.
Coldplay,3absv7,LegendaryLTU,10,Thu Jun 18 20:42:48 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree.

Coldplay,3absv7,XNY,2,Fri Jun 19 07:36:36 2015 UTC,The best version of Clocks is in Toronto 2006
Coldplay,3a6ct7,thepilotman,3,Wed Jun 17 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"I was rather surprised to hear it being played when I watched the wedding live. It was beautifully sung and the way they played the music was amazing. While the lyrics can seem quite pessimistic, the song gives hope. And even though I myself think it was quite an unusual choice for such a happy day as a wedding day, I'm sure nobody there minded."
Coldplay,3a6ct7,SeasWouldRise,3,Wed Jun 17 21:38:42 2015 UTC,"I felt exactly the same way, the lyrics were indeed pessimistic but I guess everyone just takes the tune in and not how deep the lyrics are .. Coldplay have deep lyrics which only Coldplayer's understand ;)"

Coldplay,39yzzx,mormonminion,13,Mon Jun 15 22:56:14 2015 UTC,"To this day I can't listen to ""O"" without tearing up because of two deaths in my family after it released.  It was one of my favourite tracks of GS when it got released, but now I have to constantly skip it or fight tears back when this song comes up...   It's such a shame, because it really is a masterpiece that shows how good Chris can capture a specific atmosphere and share it with the listener.  I basically break once the vocals kick in and usually when it gets to ""Sometimes they arrive, sometimes they are gone"" tears are already streaming down my face."
Coldplay,39yzzx,Erethas,11,Tue Jun 16 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this interview was one of the highlights of the Ghost Stories era. Chris always gives good interviews, but this was the first one in a long while where we saw him as a human over a musician. Just great all around."
Coldplay,39yzzx,DundahMifflin,10,Tue Jun 16 02:31:41 2015 UTC,Zane Lowe gave a great interview. I was happy to hear he'll be a part of Apple Music as a DJ.
Coldplay,39yzzx,XNY,7,Mon Jun 15 23:54:50 2015 UTC,Aaaaaand now I'm going to listen to Ghost Stories all day.
Coldplay,39yzzx,NeverToYield,3,Tue Jun 16 12:25:25 2015 UTC,"I just love ""O"" it's just beautiful the piano, the composition, the vocals I was literally in tears when I heard it first.. ""Maybe one day I'll fly with you"""
Coldplay,39yzzx,thepilotman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:47:28 2015 UTC,"In addition to this part, the part near the end where he mentions the vision for the various records is interesting. Ghost Stories and A Rush of Blood to the Head are both exactly what they envisioned, the others are about 80-90% and X&Y was about 65%.   I knew the album had a lot of difficulties, but I didn't know they released it while still so unhappy. I wonder what it'd look like if they went back and sort of redid it?"
Coldplay,39uj3n,DundahMifflin,18,Sun Jun 14 22:10:44 2015 UTC,This makes me incredibly sad. Jon Hopkins really made the Viva album special :(
Coldplay,39uj3n,ebarnes12,2,Sun Jun 14 23:56:22 2015 UTC,Coldplay got me into Jon Hopkins. His stuff is great.
Coldplay,39uj3n,MmmmmKittens,4,Mon Jun 22 22:47:15 2015 UTC,I really liked Jon Hopkins' work on Midnight and Life in Technicolor so he will be missed by me.
Coldplay,39uj3n,CaptainFalconsFist,4,Fri Jun 19 22:38:23 2015 UTC,They might be going back to their older style maybe?  Heavy on acoustics rather than the synths that they used from Viva onwards.  Could be interesting.
Coldplay,39uj3n,geekleyweekley,5,Mon Jun 15 16:31:09 2015 UTC,Wishful thinking my friend. Not gonna happen with Stargate around I'm afraid.

Coldplay,39uj3n,ASFOS,6,Mon Jun 15 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"Its not going to be full blown acoustic, but i wouldn't predict it being on the A Sky Full Of Stars end of EDM spectrum either. Im prediciting a more Mylo Xyloto style album, with a few collaborations. I'd be more than happy with that; that album had a bit of everything, from the euphoria of Charlie Brown and Hurts like Heaven to nice acoustic tracks like UFO and Us Against The World. Not to mention their most underated track, Up With The Birds. Who knows though? It may well be a full dubstep album."
Coldplay,39uj3n,geekleyweekley,3,Tue Jun 16 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think that's a pretty safe bet.  MX had a lot of diversity, so I guess I'd be happy with something like that."

Coldplay,39qndz,SHERBREENA,8,Sat Jun 13 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"So much has been going in with my life since, I feel like it's been ages but I can still vividly remember the first time I ripped the Viva La Vida CD on my computer, put it on my iPod and listened it in full. I also have fond memories of the Coldplay show in Udine the following year, which was pretty much my first ""real"" concert."
Coldplay,39qndz,djs415,3,Sat Jun 13 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"Wow. What a crazy coincidence. Viva LA vida was my first album I ever got and listened to completely, on my own. The viva LA vida tour was my first concert as well, in West Palm Beach Flarida.   As someone who considers music to be a core part of who he is now, I always think back to almost 6-7 years when I really had no real interest in music and how viva a Vida, and each member of cold play changed that for me and my life for the better. I have been playing piano since I was 4, I'm now 22, and Coldplay reignited my fire to pick it up the piano again when I stagnated around my mid teens. Now, years later, I've become better at playing the piano and singing than I ever could have imagine. Coldplay made me branch out to music I though I would never listen to. Now I can easily say The Beatles, Elton John, Billy Joel and of course ol'  Coldplay are my favorite musicians, giving me inspiration on the daily.  Last Coldplay weird coincidence thingy rant...my love for music that Coldplay ignited pushed me so far into the depths of musical appreciation that I became ecstatic over the most odd music... Considering I'm a white 22 year old from a nice, mostly Jewish suburb. New Orleans Blues. To this day, I play the new Orleans blues everyday. With so little information on how to play it online, I had to learn by ear... Which took lots of time and was frustrating. But now, I feel like an old black guy from the 60s with so much soul when I sit down at the piano and start to roll my ands and fingers or whatever the fuck they are doing! And that's all thanks to Coldplay. They started the fire that was waiting to burn so bright."

Viva La Vida and Prospekt's March are my favorite Coldplay LP and EP, I feel like that was their highest moment creatively. It's weird how, years later, I'm drawn to Remain In Light for almost the same reasons that makes me like Viva La Vida so much – experimentation and crossing genre boundaries."
Coldplay,39qndz,philliplennon,6,Sat Jun 13 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"Same for me! It's also still my all-time favorite album to this day, and it almost single-handedly persuaded me to explore the rest of Coldplay's discography. There's not a bad song on the entire thing--even when you include Prospekt's March.  My only complaint is that I didn't get into Coldplay until the tail end of the Viva era, so I missed out on a lot of the exciting stuff!"

Coldplay,39qndz,gamedemon24,8,Sun Jun 14 00:53:43 2015 UTC,It's gotta be ghost stories or mylo though
Coldplay,39qndz,Renter_,4,Sun Jun 14 02:11:38 2015 UTC,"I liked Mylo a lot. It had energy to spare, and some catchy melodies. Ghost Stories was definitely in the bottom two, but I'd say Viva's weaknesses are worse than Ghost Stories' weaknesses."
Coldplay,39qndz,gamedemon24,4,Sun Jun 14 02:29:56 2015 UTC,"I see so much dislike on Mylo Xyloto... That's one of my top albums by them. I think it's ghost stories the worst, and then X & Y"
Coldplay,39qndz,Renter_,6,Sun Jun 14 07:16:51 2015 UTC,I always found X&Y really underrated. There are some sick tunes on there.
Coldplay,39qndz,Averdian,3,Sun Jun 14 16:43:56 2015 UTC,"It does. Great songs, but as a whole it's eh"
Coldplay,39qndz,Renter_,2,Sun Jun 14 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd probably rate X&Y and Ghost Stories as the two worst too. Viva is the best by a mile though, with A Rush of Blood To The Head coming in second."
Coldplay,39qndz,Averdian,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"For me I think it's MX and Viva are close to tied pretty much, then AROBTTH, Para-para-parachutes, and then X & Y then GS. All of them GREAT albums as they all have good songs but some just as a whole are more suited."
Coldplay,39qndz,Renter_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"So your list would look something like this?   Viva la Vida & Mylo Xyloto blank A Rush Of Blood To The Head Parachutes X&Y Ghost Stories   Mine would be close to identical, only difference would be Viva la Vida as number one and then Mylo Xyloto goes down to a shared second place with A Rush Of Blood To The Head. My 4-6 are the same as yours for sure."

Coldplay,39qndz,XNY,2,Mon Jun 15 16:48:49 2015 UTC,"I personally think 42 is one of the best songs, the whole ""You thought you might be a ghost"" part is absolutely amazing.   But I must agree, the strongest components of the album are the three last songs, Violet Hill, Strawberry Swing and Death And All His Friends, as well as the amazing intro, Life in Technicolor, which might be the best album opener of all. Wait, Mylo Xyloto/Hurts Like Heaven is the best one for sure!   I often get so conflicted when ranking Coldplays stuff. It's hard."

I had jumped on the Coldplay boat at the Prospekts March release, and followed the band thoroughly after hearing Rock Am Ring. I even remember how shitty Princess of China sounded and how the bass overpowered all of the microphones at Rock im Ring and we never heard it again up until the release. Good times indeed :)   The build up to Ghost Stories wasn't as good. I was not enthused by the Midnight video... but I'm already looking forward to AHFoD"

Coldplay,3950yh,colormessage,3,Tue Jun 9 10:26:04 2015 UTC,"yeah I guess so... Production is good, but kinda takes away from the laid back vibes, the electronicenss also removes the magic which I got from first albums. Mylo Xyloto was like GS but the tunes waay catchier so I didnt really mind."
Coldplay,3950yh,DundahMifflin,6,Tue Jun 9 10:38:32 2015 UTC,I think it may be my favorite; As an ambient lover and mellow mood music man it hits the spot for late night just trying to relax. I Hope they revisit more ambient influences.
Coldplay,3950yh,cyan_sunshine,4,Tue Jun 9 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not their best, but packs a good punch. It's easier to understand if you know that Chris Martin seemlingly wrote every song about how he felt breaking his relationship with Gwenyth Paltrow.

Coldplay,3950yh,JIASnake,2,Tue Jun 9 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"I also felt it was the weakest album so far. Unfortunately, I don't think any of the songs had the lyrical depth I am accustomed to from Coldplay, despite the fact that the songs were likely from a very personal place. I would go so far as to say that I barely listen to this album, except for ""Ghost Story,"" which I think is a fantastic song."
Coldplay,3950yh,clwestbr,2,Tue Jun 9 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"When I first heard Midnight, I was super excited. IMO, Midnight is Coldplay's best song in the 2010 decade, and I was really happy, believing that Coldplay hadn't actually sold out completely to the 100% pop market after the horrible piece of trash that is ""Princess of China.""  I really thought Coldplay was going to expand into new musical boundaries. I was hoping for something more ambient and experimental, so I was super excited.  And then I heard Magic and I was like ""...ohhh""  and then A Sky Full of Stars, ""....ohhhhhhhhhhhh""  This record is a piece of pop-shit, and the song Midnight is pretty much just salt in the wound. ""We could have made something really fucking awesome, but we didn't because FUCK YOU! LETS CRANK UP THE EDM LAWL DROPT HAT FILTHY FUCKING BASS AHAHAHAHA!""  And then Chris Martin made millions of dollars.  Fuck.  Edit: I will admit that ""Oceans"" and ""O"" are actually good songs, but if I hear A Sky Full of Stars one more time I swear to god I will AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FUCK YOU"
Coldplay,3950yh,chocolatecheeese1,2,Wed Jun 10 09:44:50 2015 UTC,"Personally I totally agree with you, it kinda hit the wrong vibe for me, especially as it seemed a polar opposite to the direction they were taking after MX. I also feel like, compared to the previous two albums, it underplays the non-chris martin members of the band, although I guess it is understandable considering the circumstances :p  All round still a great album, but yeah no shame in prefering previous releases! One of the reasons I like coldplay is that each of their albums is distinctly different, keeps it fresh :)"

Coldplay,38zxee,Averdian,3,Mon Jun 8 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have a good theory for the song name, ""1.36""? It makes no sense to me. But there has been alot of stuff I have been confused by that this subreddit has explained to me nicely, so I hope for a good answer."
Coldplay,38zxee,Alex_Plum,5,Mon Jun 8 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, I believe the original length of the song was 1 minute 36 seconds. Once this final version came to be, Coldplay didn't bother to change the name along with it."

Coldplay,38teka,josh21218,5,Sat Jun 6 19:13:44 2015 UTC,Any reason why it's called Cause & Affect as opposed to Cause & Effect?
Coldplay,38teka,The_Prospektor,3,Sat Jun 6 22:07:40 2015 UTC,"Quote from /u/JordanCox2:  I should have explained my reasoning a little better when I first made the suggestion. Since the second half is about love, I wanted to use 'affection' somehow. I thought, ""Hmm, 'Cause and Effect' is a neat title that ties the album together, but I still want to add the love element to it as well. 'Cause and Affection' doesn't sound right... I'll go with 'Cause and Affect'. It still works, and it can be seen as a play on words with the actual phrase 'Cause and Effect' and portray the same effect""."
Coldplay,38teka,Blanchimont,2,Sun Jun 7 06:29:01 2015 UTC,"Why are Prospekt's March tracks included? They aren't B-sides, are they?"

Coldplay,38o4dt,chillininantennae,16,Fri Jun 5 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"Here's my interpretation. Just a caveat, this could mean something completely different to someone else.  X&Y, as a whole, is a love story about two people who feel like they are too damaged to love someone else. They're both sort of alone in the universe, and they've been hurt before, so they're treating everyone with caution.  Square One features the main character, we'll call him X. X is smart and thoughtful, but he's never really fit in. He's the sort of person that most people just ignore, and not too many people can deal with. He's frustrated that no one seems to listen to him, that everyone else seems happy and here he is, lost and hurt and lonely. He has so many things that he wants to do, but he doesn't know how he's going to do them, and he feels constantly stuck at square one.  X meets a girl, let's call her Y. (Or it could be a guy, if you want.) Y seems to be just like him, and although he's cautious about stepping into a relationship (""every step that you take could be your biggest mistake""), he goes with it anyway, hoping to atone for previous mistakes with relationships. He thinks about the risks involved and decides to just ""take a breath, jump over the side"" and do it, because if you never take a risk, there isn't much meaning to life.  In White Shadows, X is feeling worthless. This is the part of the story where the boy's gotten the girl, but he feels like he doesn't deserve her. He doesn't understand how anyone could love him and how he experiences a disconnect with most people (""all this noise I'm waking up, all this space I'm taking up, I cannot hear you're breaking up""). He's thinking that Y must want someone easier to be with than him, someone who wasn't so misunderstood. He makes sure Y really knows what she's getting into, and that Y really wants him. Here he makes it known his true desire to be with Y.  Fix You could be X singing to Y, but I like to think of it as Y singing to X. After X tells Y about all his baggage, and how he feels like he's unlovable, Y tells him that it's okay, that everyone feels like that sometimes, and that she will always try to fix him. She knows better than most what it feels like to have been hurt, and is determined to show X that she cares. X repeats the sentiment, saying that he will fix her if she is hurt.  After spending a little bit of time away from Y and in the real world, X again realizes how much he doesn't fit the mold. He knows he has potential, but he doesn't know where he wants to take his life or what he wants to do. He feels jealous of the few friends he does have, since they seem to have it all in order, and he recognizes Y's talent as well. As X listens to his friends converse, he realizes that he doesn't care about any of it and he doesn't realize how anyone could. He has no idea how to respond (""I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak, and they're talking it to me""). He knows that all he needs is a friend who can understand his situation, and that's what he's found in Y (""are you lost or incomplete? Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?""), and he just wants to go talk to her and get it all out.  Before he can, he gets betrayed by one of his close friends and has a breakdown. It's not the first time something like this has happened to him. He loses faith in humanity, and when he finally sees Y again, he still hasn't recovered. He feels like he's been broken inside (""when something is broken and you try to fix it, trying to repair it any way you can""). He knows he still loves Y, and he wants to be with her, but he doesn't know if he can trust her, since he's been betrayed by everyone else he put his trust in. Y is a little bit blindsided by this. She wants to help X, but she's not sure she knows how, because she doesn't know how to fix herself. How is she going to fix another? She has her own problems that she has to deal with, and she's not sure she wants to deal with X's as well. Both X and Y feel disconnected from the world (""you and me are floating on a tidal wave, you and me are drifting into outer space""). They decide that they need some time apart.  In Speed of Sound, X is sitting alone one night, crying his heart out, staring up at the sky, when he realizes that instead of X and Y being so different, like he had originally thought, they were basically in the same situation, and that was why they understood each other so well. He believes that their relationship problems were caused by fixating on himself and not trying to understand her as well as she understood him, because they were really the same (""all the signs that I couldn't read, all the light that I couldn't see""). He feels overwhelmed by everything going on (""all that noise and all that sound, all the places I got found""), but remembers all the times he had with Y, and resolves to apologize and get her back, hoping that she sees things the same way that he does.   X rushes back to Y's house, where she is just as distraught as he was, crying in her room. He sings her a song, where he lets her know that she is loved and that he knows how it feels to be alone (""my song is love, love to the loveless known""). He lets her know how much he loves her and that he truly is sorry for the way he pushed her away, and that he understands what she's going through and she doesn't have to be alone. He also sings it to try to convince himself that the same is true for him, that he doesn't have to be alone. He lets her know that being with him isn't easy (""I'm not gonna stand and wait, not gonna leave until it's much too late""), but that he still loves her.  Y doesn't trust that X really is sorry. She's had her heart broken one too many times to just run back when he apologizes. X, distraught, tells her how she doesn't see the nuance of the situation, how to her, everything will either work or it won't. (""you see the world in black and white"") He knows she's a perfectionist, and that all she ever wanted was for everything to work out perfectly, but now that they're older, they both know that the world doesn't work like that. He knows their relationship has been full of ups and downs, but he believes that that's what will make it work, because a ""perfect"" relationship would not be a real one (""all you ever wanted was love, but you never looked hard enough, it's never gonna give itself up/all you ever wanted to be, living in perfect symmetry, nothing is as down or as up as us""). He walks away from her, not even awaiting her response, because he believes that they are too far gone and she will not want him back. (""I feel low, oh no"")  He goes back to his own home and carries on life without her, realizing that he's not over her and she's still all he things about (""the hardest part was letting go, not taking part""). He still, however, finds solace in all the memories that they had together (""you left the sweetest taste in my mouth, you're a silver lining in the clouds""). He also feels frustrated, feeling that he was the reason the relationship ended, and wishes that he could get over his issues (""everything I know is wrong, everything I do comes undone, and everything is torn apart.""). He struggles to find hope and light in his life now that Y is gone.  While Y has been separated from X, she does some thinking of her own. She realizes that before she met X, she had been lost, and only after she met him did she find herself. (""You cut me down to size and opened up my eyes, made me realize what I could not see"") She notes that X is brutally honest, and that he had hurt her, but the things he had said were true, and he had always had good intentions. She believes that she is to blame for what happened with them (""you put me on a shelf and kept me for yourself, I can only blame myself, you can only blame me""). She realizes that her past experiences with love and her past grudges were holding her back (""what good is it to live with nothing left to give? Forget but not forgive, not loving all you see""). She returns to X and apologizes for hurting him, saying, ""You belong with me, not swallowed in the sea.""   As they get back together, X acknowledges that Y was the best thing to ever happen to him (""sunlight opened up my eyes, to see for the first time, you'll open them up""), and that love and life are fleeting (""hundreds of years in the future, there could be computers looking for life on earth""), so they might as well love as hard as they can while they can. He tells Y that they're both kind of a mess, but that everybody kind of is, and as long as they listen to each other, they can work it out (""don't fight for the wrong side, say what you feel like, say how you feel"" and ""cremated, then drilled and invaded, if somebody made it, someone will mess it up""). He knows that they'll have their ups and downs, but you have to take the good with the bad in life, and that's the beautiful thing, because the good would not be nearly as meaningful without hurt (""you go backwards, but then you go forwards again""). The fact that he ends the song with ""you'll go forwards"" fully cements the idea that the good of life outweighs the bad. I like to end the album there; it's a satisfying, yet ambiguous ending.   If you continue to Til Kingdom Come, that's like your fairytale ending right there. X acknowledges that he still sometimes feels lost (""I don't know which way I'm going, I don't know which way I've come""), but that he instantly feels better when she listens and understands. He reflects on the ups and downs of their crazy relationship and also of life, saying that he wouldn't change a single thing and that no matter what happens, he will still love her. X and Y promise to keep in mind that they're more similar than they are different, and that they both can be selfish, and difficult, and messed up, but that they truly see the beauty in each other. They kiss and walk into the sunset. (Just kidding, but if you want to end it like that, you definitely can.)"

Coldplay,38fw20,Trevman825,10,Wed Jun 3 23:08:41 2015 UTC,I saw this just after I read a bunch of people hating on Coldplay. Glad to know that I'm not totally socially unacceptable :)
Coldplay,38fw20,cyan_sunshine,10,Thu Jun 4 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Coldplay is considered a bland, stadium band. Great show, serviceable music, but not too innovative (and their last couple of albums haven't exactly disproved that, though they've had several that did).   I enjoy them and think they're far more interesting than given credit for, but feel like they peaked early while still hoping to hear one more mind-blowing piece from them."
Coldplay,38fw20,clwestbr,14,Thu Jun 4 01:21:11 2015 UTC,"I need another Viva, and soon."
Coldplay,38fw20,TheTastyHam,3,Thu Jun 4 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't like them that huge. Viva was amazing, but I don't want them to become that massive again, it would feel bloated or repetitive. Mylo Xyloto saddened me, it was a huge let-down after Viva.   I miss the feel of their first two albums. They captured the tone with Ghost Stories, but not the execution. They came close, though, very close."
Coldplay,38fw20,clwestbr,2,Thu Jun 4 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree with you. Viva is my favorite record of all time and I want their next record to match it in terms of emotional magnitude.   If they release anything remotely similar to any of their first four records, I'll have the biggest smile.  And all this is said with me still loving MX and GS.   I got downvoted in another post for saying this, but Coldplay could release a record of autotuned farts called ""Coldcrap"" with a pile of poo as the cover I would still find a way to absolutely love it."
Coldplay,38fw20,TheTastyHam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:41:14 2015 UTC,"My cousin said she would buy an album full of either silence or Rebecca Black covers if they released it.  I've grown to a point where the bands I love don't supercede my love of good music. If a band I like releases a garbage album (like I consider most of MX and parts of GS to be) I tend to just ignore those albums.   I think the reasons things like book series, tv shows, music, and film franchises decline is because fans get to the point where they refuse to acknowledge that the thing they love is capable of a mistake. It happened to HIMYM, it happened to Star Wars (no one would tell George Lucas 'no') and its happening to Coldplay. I wish we'd hold them to a higher standard so that they would be forced by album sales and concert attendance to get their butts in gear and release truly great music again."
Coldplay,38fw20,clwestbr,2,Thu Jun 4 01:48:45 2015 UTC,"Well, sure, if they release an album I dislike then I'll exclaim that dislike (even though I'll most likely find a way to love the record.)  But I'll be damned if I won't buy the record and buy tickets to see them on tour.  Regardless of what album sales and ticket sales dictate, I hope that they're never pressured by money to redirect their creativity."
Coldplay,38fw20,TheTastyHam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"I kind of hope not as well, and they don't need the money anymore, but album sales numbers might tell them what they need to hear. After Mylo Xyloto I let a friend buy Ghost Stories and borrowed it before I shelled out my own cash for it, and I'm glad I did (Ink...what the hell?).   The only way to push them to be better is numbers, and with a fanbase that large that is guaranteed to pre-order every album the numbers will always say they're the greatest thing ever, so they'll keep doing largely what they've done the last two albums."
Coldplay,38fw20,clwestbr,2,Thu Jun 4 02:05:36 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, Ink is one of my favorite songs on the record. To each their own!  Music is such a personal, intimate, and subjective art-form that it's a wonder most of us agree to like half of the same songs/records."
Coldplay,38fw20,TheTastyHam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"I think that's why there are such large fandoms for bands like Coldplay. Inoffensive, calming, large range of appeal in age groups, and star-crossed in public. It helps.  Bands like that were meant to have giant concerts and sell tons of albums for awhile. Oasis did it as well, but they did it in an era where being drug-addled and slightly offensive was desireable."
Coldplay,38fw20,clwestbr,5,Thu Jun 4 02:27:12 2015 UTC,"It's hard for me to take anything Pitchfork does seriously. That said, I can't complain about someone trying to explain to those that intensely dislike Coldplay why they're so popular."
Coldplay,38fw20,Silverflash-x,7,Thu Jun 4 07:33:41 2015 UTC,I think X&Y is definitively better than Viva la Vida and Ghost Stories. It's a really good album.
Coldplay,38fw20,gamedemon24,3,Thu Jun 4 03:03:19 2015 UTC,X&Y is my favorite.
Coldplay,38fw20,cyan_sunshine,3,Thu Jun 4 10:59:21 2015 UTC,"I think its better than GS by a long shot.  As to it being better than Viva...its not for me. I love every song on the album, but I find the overall collection boring. If I hit 'shuffle' on my Coldplay set it mixes perfectly with everything else, but its not good for me on its own."
Coldplay,38fw20,clwestbr,3,Thu Jun 4 11:43:00 2015 UTC,I think I teared up reading that.
Coldplay,38fw20,mission17,2,Wed Jun 3 23:40:31 2015 UTC,did i miss the memo on why everyone hates coldplay???  i don't get it.  what makes them different from all the other pop acts out there?  there music has much more substance than most.  i guess the transformation over the years has annoyed people.
Coldplay,38fw20,brettievedder,2,Thu Jun 4 13:42:41 2015 UTC,"I thought this was their most consistent album tbh. It didn't have any song as good as Trouble, Yellow, The Scientist, In My Place, or Clocks.....but the album tracks were great. It lacked the classy warm piano sound that was on Parachutes and maybe wasn't as memorable but a really good album over multiple listens. I never understood the adoration for Viva La Vida over this because I think that album might've been overrated on the backs of a couple strong singles.  Either way, it's a far better album than the garbage they've put out in the past two especially Mylo Xyloto. I don't think X&Y was Coldplay trying to be anything as others proclaim but MX was definetely them trying to sound like a pop band from the top 40 rather than the post-Britpop band they were. At least Keane and Travis are still sticking to what they're good at though Travis are a bit old and past-it.  Square One, Talk, A Message, Low, X&Y, and Swallowed in the Sea are really underrated songs"

Coldplay,38b00k,cyan_sunshine,22,Wed Jun 3 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"When I first got into Coldplay a few months ago, I listened only to ARoBttH and Parachutes, and didn't bother with anything else. Then one day   One day: Yo Violet Hill is a sick song  Later: Hey Lovers in Japan is great too  Even later: Yes is hella fun to sing along too  Continuing: Life in Technicolor is a surprisingly great instrumental, I would never have expected that from a band I called pop a few months ago.   Even Later: Strawberry Swing is chill, and Death and All His Friends is great.  Last Week: Strawberry Swing is the greatest Coldplay song, second maybe to only Amsterdam.  A Few Days Ago: Hell this album is fucking amazing.    Took me a while, but I really think this album is tied for #1 with ARoBttH.   But of course, you may never come around to it. Just know that, while Viva isn't a hard album to listen to like most of Coldplay, it does take a while to warm up."

Try to give it a full listen, and please don't skip Death And All His Friends.  Its an epic conclusion to what is in my opinion their most artful album.  Also, the strings thing is correct, but I personally play the violin, so I'm kinda partial to that..."
Coldplay,38b00k,Epos_Metallicus,9,Wed Jun 3 01:40:37 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to say but it's my favorite. I could listen to it start to finish any day. Every song has something that just envelopes me.  Hnnnng Lovers In Japan.

I get the creativity and expression they took on, but I dunno. As an album, it's alright, but in separate pieces, it's fantastic."
Coldplay,38b00k,DundahMifflin,3,Wed Jun 3 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"Listen again, because that is probably their best record in my opinion!  One of my favorites ever. It's perfect from start to doing and has such a specific feeling attached to it when I listen.  It's what I want Coldplay to go back to for this new one, or at least something similar."
Coldplay,38b00k,GreeneRockets,2,Wed Jun 3 10:50:46 2015 UTC,"Of their six studio albums, it's in the bottom half for me. I agree that it's better individually than it is as a whole. Viva La Vida, Yes, and Strawberry Swing are among my favorite Coldplay songs, and it has other great tracks as well (Death and All His Friends and Violet Hill for instance) but it never completely ""clicked"" with me as an album.    It's sort of hard to explain. If pretty many any track from the album comes on shuffle, I'm happy to listen to it, but if I feel like sitting down and listening to a Coldplay album straight through, it would be, like, my 4th choice or somewhere along those lines. Hell, X&Y has more songs that I'm not a huge fan of (three) than does Viva (one), but I'd still rather listen to it straight through than I would Viva just because it feels more cohesive.    All that said, it's still a great album and any complaints are really just nitpicks. It's more or less tied in my eyes with AROBTTH for their best album lyrically, so that's cool."
Coldplay,38b00k,Silverflash-x,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"It took me a while to get into Viva just because when I first found Coldplay I thought all of the Viva titles sounded too weird. ""Lovers in Japan,"" ""Strawberry Swing,"" ""Life in Technicolour II."" I had no idea what these songs would be like so I avoided them, but Viva is by far my favorite album/era. I think it's also got their best b-sides, and every album should have its corresponding Prospekt's March.   As far as the album itself goes, I think its their most cohesive, besides maybe Ghost Stories. Starting with a short instrumental is a great way to set the tone of the album. Switching between a song about life/hope and a song about death/despair pretty much throughout the entire album is a great way to emphasize the themes, and ending with The Escapist so that the album loops seamlessly is such a nice way to sum up the entire album and make it feel like you've completed a journey.   Reasons you might find it hard to get through is probably because it starts with its weaker songs and builds towards the end. Also, having Reign of Love and Chinese Sleep Chant so close together sort of make the middle of the album drag on with less gripping bits.   Reasons to love it, though, include the fact that Strawberry Swing is the happiest song out there. Death and all His friends has the most calming bits in Coldplay's discography, and then escalates to a bombastic closer. Violet Hill and Viva are obviously awesome. Yes is just so dark and intriguing with its Middle Eastern string sounds. Etc. Etc. I love this album."

I thought that Life in Technicolour was a brilliant instrumental song, but frankly even Violet Hill and Lost! didn't get me interested. It didn't ""feel"" like Coldplay to me at all...and that is where I progressively lost interest in the band. Mylo Xyloto was an absolute train wreck.   I still believe that Parachutes and Rush of Blood are still their best studio albums to date."

For example, with the Scientist, if you bought the official single as a CD, there would be a couple of extra songs like I Ran Away. B sides come from when people used to buy vinyl records. The song you wanted would be on the A side and the B side would be stuff likes songs the band put to fill the empty space.  You don't really have B sides anymore because most people buy/stream singles electronically and you don't need to make b sides to encourage people to buy the single now."

I also think Ghsot Stories contain some of the most hard hitting lyrics:  'My body moves, goes where I will, but though I try my heart stays still'  'Tell me you love me, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me'  'You've got to find yourself alone in this world'  'Maybe one day I'll fly next to you'  And my favorite is probably the most simple:  'Don't ever let go'"
Coldplay,37ikgc,chris7197,3,Thu May 28 09:20:49 2015 UTC,"""Don't ever let go""   Interesting. Which song is this from?"
Coldplay,37ikgc,colormessage,2,Thu May 28 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"According to the almighty Google, it's from O. But I don't remember hearing it in that song."
Coldplay,37ikgc,flumpy_pumpy,3,Thu May 28 18:56:46 2015 UTC,It's the line that Apple sings at the end of the song. If you listen for it you can hear it.

Coldplay,375avr,ebarnes12,2,Mon May 25 14:27:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. So, how does Mumford and Sons sound anything like Coldplay? They remind me of folk music and that's nothing like Coldplay. Especially the vocals."

Coldplay,373teu,MattNOYB,6,Sun May 24 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. A few others have pointed it must be some sort of inside joke between them. Most likely, they're just using the same studio or something."

Coldplay,373teu,comiclover1377,7,Sun May 24 17:46:28 2015 UTC,I really liked Princess of China. A Sky Full of Stars on the other hand didn't need to be made.
Coldplay,373teu,nibsti,5,Sun May 24 20:05:05 2015 UTC,Yes it did. Chris said the album needed such a song.
Coldplay,373teu,uttamo,5,Sun May 24 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"This is all matter of opinion but when Rolling Stones says it ""was designed to lift listeners out of the melancholy of the rest of the record,"" it is pretty clear IMO that it didn't belong. It was very different for Coldplay, especially in an album that had so much focus on one theme. It just felt out of place."
Coldplay,373teu,nibsti,3,Sun May 24 20:33:31 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand - how does that Rolling Stone quote go against the song not belonging on the album? The album's theme was to do with the breakdown of a relationship. You don't stay sad forever so it makes sense for the album to be that way too.
Coldplay,373teu,uttamo,1 point,Sun May 24 21:38:19 2015 UTC,It doesn't mean that it is against the song but it explains why I am against it.

Coldplay,373teu,uttamo,2,Mon May 25 00:13:46 2015 UTC,Really I think it was just included because they new a large majority of people would eat it up gaining more popularity for the album. Thats all that song was really there for. To get more sales.
Coldplay,373teu,ImUnderYoBed,6,Sun May 24 21:27:59 2015 UTC,I believe Coldplay don't seek commercial success nor do they become pressured by their label to release radio-friendly hits.

Coldplay,370g56,DundahMifflin,5,Sat May 23 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"Fun fact from a comment I made a few months ago:   After doing a little research: Chris was interviewed by Howard Stern on Nov. 9, 2011. During the interview, Howard suggested that Chris re-do Speed of Sound in concert to a point where he likes it. The Mylo Xyloto Tour began on Oct. 1, 2011, and I can't find any record of Speed of Sound being played prior to Spring 2012. I guess he took Howard's advice!"

Coldplay,36g3kg,antonistute,2,Tue May 19 06:36:51 2015 UTC,Yes!! One of my top Coldplay favourites.

Coldplay,36g3kg,UltraPowered,2,Tue May 19 22:40:01 2015 UTC,Totally! Didn't expect to ever hear it on the radio though..
Coldplay,36g3kg,randorolian,6,Thu May 21 03:01:39 2015 UTC,"I also absolutely loved it! Magic, Ink, O, True Love and Midnight are all fantastic songs, and Always In My Head is in my top 3 Coldplay songs of all time. I just love the general subtleness of the album."
Coldplay,36g3kg,ehzoolpoe,7,Tue May 19 10:46:14 2015 UTC,One of my favorite albums :)
Coldplay,36g3kg,Dustygusher,5,Tue May 19 05:35:38 2015 UTC,"The entire album is sooo good! Especially the instrumentation. And I really like Another's Arms, the instrumentation is legendary when you listen to it without vocals! The production quality is so good."
Coldplay,36g3kg,clpage1991,4,Tue May 19 06:07:55 2015 UTC,I feel like the instrumentation is like a more modern Parachutes.. Like people expect Coldplay to come out with stuff just like their other albums but I feel like that would be boring. I love GS
Coldplay,36g3kg,FishFollower74,3,Tue May 19 14:24:39 2015 UTC,Yup...it's my go-to album when I don't have an urge to listen to anything else. Love the live version also...very soulful and full of energy.
Coldplay,36g3kg,TyrannosaurusHives,1 point,Tue May 19 09:59:31 2015 UTC,YES! I just watched them perform some songs from GS on Youtube and it was incredible!
Coldplay,36g3kg,boqeh,12,Thu May 21 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"I don't love Ghost Stories, but I have a theory about it.  I think it's a decent album that was released at an absolutely horrible time. The release of Ghost Stories was in May of last year, right at the beginning of summer. I got the album the day it came out and was so excited to hear it, but it didn't click at all with me those first weeks. I put it on the shelf and forgot about it.  However, I ended up throwing it on at the beginning of December, and it was just perfect for that timeframe. Ghost Stories is definitely a winter album, and works really well with the snow and the cold weather. I feel that if they had released the album around Christmas, reception would have been much more positive."
Coldplay,36g3kg,Apprex,4,Tue May 19 06:29:17 2015 UTC,"I have a weird thing where I place bands by the seasons, and I've always considered Coldplay to be a late-autumn / early-winter band (with the exception of MX). I think Ghost Stories fits in that time frame beautifully."
Coldplay,36g3kg,krisbykreme,1 point,Fri May 22 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"It's funny, because back at the end of last year when Spotify did their Year in Review thing, it sorted all my artists into the most often played based on season. Lo and behold, Coldplay was the artist I played most often during the autumn and winter months."
Coldplay,36g3kg,blackhawkdown58,1 point,Sun May 24 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I never thought of it that way. Even I took a while to listen it properly and then loved a couple of tracks like Ink, O, True Love and Midnight. It's definitely a winter album."
Coldplay,36g3kg,raicicle,1 point,Wed May 20 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Never thought about it like that, but this totally makes so much sense. It definitely is pretty somber overall, even if there are some ""peppy"" moments. Come to think of it...I generally listen to it to PUT me in a good mood...Interesting thought!"

Coldplay,36g3kg,Karenleafry,3,Tue May 19 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"I think Ghost Stories stands in a place as one of Coldplay's most subtly innovative albums. There's nothing on there that screams out the kind of experimentation of the Coldplay sound that Mylo Xyloto or Viva did, but there was definitely new space carved out. The XX-style, R&B-influenced Magic, sampling on Another's Arms, and Midnight's super minimalist vibe felt incredibly fresh, even though a lot of people would consider this a step back from the experimentation of the past few years."
Coldplay,36g3kg,Cabbaggio,1 point,Tue May 19 19:19:37 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. I agree that it didn't seem super innovative and in the beginning I just realllyyy liked the sound. But as I listen to it over and over again, I do notice the awesome production (esp on songs like Midnight, AIMH, True Love, etc)."
Coldplay,36g3kg,thepilotman,2,Thu May 21 03:04:35 2015 UTC,"It would be my second favorite  (after XY) save for another's arms. It's an overly sexualized song for coldplay, at least. From start to finish it's  an assault of lyrical vomit to the ears.  Every time I hear it I cringe."
Coldplay,36g3kg,ner_ners,2,Tue May 19 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely Love this album! Magic, Ink, True Love, Oceans, Always In My Head, and Ghost Story. I love 'em all!"
Coldplay,36g3kg,Silverflash-x,2,Wed May 20 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely love it. But I think you absolutely need to be able to relate to it if you're going to like it. Chris seemed to know that, too. He said that a lot of people might not like it, but it might speak to other people who are going through similar things to what he was going through. And Ghost Stories is really for those people.   Always in my head is genius though."

O is one of my favorite coldplay songs now. True Love and Oceans are also fantastic... Happy birthday!"
Coldplay,3682xk,Peteos,3,Sun May 17 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"See, I was the opposite; I loved Ghost Stories on the first listen but each time I went back to it I disliked it more and more. It's an okay album, but in my opinion, it's Coldplay's only okay album. Everything else they've done is stellar, and this album just felt a bit rushed, a bit constrained, and a bit predictable."
Coldplay,3682xk,JimJamBimBam,14,Sun May 17 06:16:47 2015 UTC,"I've definitely come around to this album since release, it's still not even close to my favorite but I appreciate it way more now."

Coldplay,35zvld,EmbraceComplexity,6,Thu May 14 22:35:29 2015 UTC,It reminds me of a similar article regarding The Beatles. The author tried to argue that Hey Jude was the worst Beatles song.

Coldplay,35zvld,DundahMifflin,4,Fri May 15 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"I don't even think that lyric is all that bad. It's not one of their best, but it's clearly trying to conjure a similar aesthetic to Lennon's ""Imagine,"" and it does a fine job at that.    Their criticisms for the lyrics in Lost! are laughable, though. There's absolutely nothing wrong with ""Just because I'm losing, doesn't mean I'm lost"" and it certainly isn't a ""sad attempt at wordplay."""

IMO music is 100% subjective, I mean people try to come up with objective reasons they don't like a song, when someone else might love the things they hate. The things they bash in the article seem ridiculous, imo it's just a method of saying ""I don't like this song, let's come up with some reasons I don't like it."" I dunno if this makes sense to anyone, and I'm not very good at saying what I want to say effectively, but I guess what I'm trying to say is I really couldn't give a crap what anyone else thinks about the music I like, it's all simply one's taste. If music was judged on how well done it is, then wouldn't everyone be listening to Mozart? I mean, I like classical, but I'd much rather listen to stuff like Coldplay, even though from an objective point of view Mozart is way better. Not sure why I wrote this much :P"
Coldplay,35zvld,Dustygusher,1 point,Sat May 16 00:58:51 2015 UTC,"That is why I don't read reviews or think they should exist for music. If anything the review could be short and helpful as in warnings about certain features that may be undesired such as a more subjective approach. ""The new blah blah blah album contains mild language and is in  a synth pop retro style with influences from james brown and various disco bands..."" ect... Not "" Ok, I thought the first half of the album was dull and slow, and sounded like more stuff. The drummer is ok I guess with his polyrhythms but whatever like any drummer can do that....

Coldplay,35zvld,DJHazro,1 point,Fri May 15 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's really difficult to rank music, particularly Coldplay's music. I think it has a lot to do with mood and the feeling in the moment. There have been times when I listened to songs that I didn't like on the first listen, but have came back to them and love them. Violent Hill and Politik are some example of these for me.   Sometimes, I find myself switching my favorite Coldplay songs around, across all their albums, even Ghost Stories. If I'm in a really happy mood, I love to drown in the happiness and exciting of Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall (one of my absolute favs). When I'm feeling meh or so so, I'll listen to their more humble and softer music like something from Parachutes."
Coldplay,35wxe1,gamehelp16,12,Thu May 14 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"It might be in reference to the three EPs they released in 1998-1999: Safety, Brothers & Sisters, and The Blue Room. That's a good question, though, to which I'm not exactly sure!"

Coldplay,35u3lx,Ayrgente,14,Wed May 13 15:12:31 2015 UTC,Impressive! Didn't see this coming. Also surprised by this photo of a modular synthesizer. I suppose AHFoD will be more electronic than the band's previous efforts.
Coldplay,35u3lx,lelebuonerba,12,Wed May 13 16:07:39 2015 UTC,Damn I sure hope not. How can they go more electronic than GS?
Coldplay,35u3lx,cpm619,17,Wed May 13 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd rather see them go more electronic and produce something innovative / experimental (I'd love to see them go back to work with good old Brian Eno) than mash up their pop/rock with big room EDM (like they did with GS)."
Coldplay,35u3lx,lelebuonerba,12,Wed May 13 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, if they are going to continue to explore electronic let it be ambient, a la Jon Hopkins, rather than generic poppy EDM (Avicii)."
Coldplay,35u3lx,cpm619,7,Wed May 13 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"You also should understand that electronic music/edm is a massive field that can be categorized far deeper than ""ambient"" and ""poppy edm""  If you have ever heard of Kygo, SnakeHips, Tycho, then you understand what I mean. It is perfectly plausible that Coldplay go the edm route without sounding poppy or using avicii for that matter."
Coldplay,35u3lx,Sky-Pala,8,Wed May 13 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"I understand that and I am fan of those other EDM artists (I saw Kygo 3 weeks ago). However for the sake of simplifying it in terms of how Coldplay use electronics, I used those terms. Ambient as in (The Escapist, Midnight), Poppy EDM as in (ASFOS)."
Coldplay,35u3lx,cpm619,3,Wed May 13 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"That's precisely why I always add ""big room"" before ""EDM"" when talking about what the general population thinks EDM is. There's so much great electronic dance music out there, it's a shame that most only relate to one of its sub-genres."
Coldplay,35u3lx,lelebuonerba,5,Wed May 13 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, ASFOS was really Coldplay's take on doing ""big room"" house music."
Coldplay,35u3lx,cpm619,2,Wed May 13 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Haha, I get that :)  I was mostly saying it for some of the people in the sub who associate electronic/edm with pop.  I'm thinking about doing a self post on the topic actually.."
Coldplay,35u3lx,Sky-Pala,1 point,Wed May 13 17:39:49 2015 UTC,Would be an interesting read! I've recently gotten into this type of music and prefer artists like Kygo and Pierce Fulton over the likes of Avicii and Hardwell.
Coldplay,35u3lx,cpm619,4,Wed May 13 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"I think there's plenty of headroom for a band like Coldplay to experiment with electronic instruments without falling into either ends of the electronic music spectrum, big room EDM (which has mass appeal but is arguably formulaic) or ambient (which has very little appeal to the masses).  On one hand I'd like to see the band make some proper alternative dance-oriented music (a la Talking Heads), on the other (having listened to Ghost Stories) I'd rather see them get more influenced by ambient than big room EDM. One recent record that I feel Coldplay could learn a lot from is Caribou's latest LP Our Love. It has quite broad appeal yet it's still quite experimental and unique."
Coldplay,35u3lx,lelebuonerba,5,Wed May 13 17:40:58 2015 UTC,I agree! A good example could be Kangaroo Court by Capitol Cities. That song has modular synth and many other electronic elements.
Coldplay,35u3lx,Sky-Pala,3,Wed May 13 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Great example! It makes me think of Holy Ghost! (here's one of their songs). They might be a bit too much on the synthpop side of things for Coldplay to get inspiration from, though.  Speaking of DFA acts, I'd really love for Coldplay to put out something like LCD Soundsystem's Sound of Silver, but I might be asking for too much.  Maybe they could draw something from Phoenix's latest two records, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and Bankrupt!. Plenty of electronic instruments but very catchy songs (actually quite similar in style to Coldplay)."
Coldplay,35u3lx,lelebuonerba,3,Wed May 13 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"I love SOS, great LCD.S. album. I would love if Coldplay went in any of these directions!"

Coldplay,35u3lx,RuDreading,2,Thu May 14 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"I think that with ""A Head Full of Dreams"" being their ""last"" album, ""A Sky Full of Stars"" could have been a pretty cool final track, name-wise."

Since the second half is about love, I wanted to use 'affection' somehow. I thought, ""Hmm, 'Cause and Effect' is a neat title that ties the album together, but I still want to add the love element to it as well. 'Cause and Affection' doesn't sound right... I'll go with 'Cause and Affect'. It still works, and it can be seen as a play on words with the actual phrase 'Cause and Effect' and portray the same effect""."

Coldplay,35izqk,diet_ice,6,Sun May 10 21:04:45 2015 UTC,I would like to hear a Rush of Blood/Viva la Vida sound but also if they made more Midnight-type songs I would love that even more.   Side note: can anyone recommend me artists/albums with similar music to Midnight? I know people compare it to Bon Iver but are there any others?
Coldplay,35izqk,uttamo,4,Sun May 10 23:26:14 2015 UTC,"Have a go with the rest of Jon Hopkins' music since he produced Midnight: of his discography, Insides and Immunity are most similar sonically, Asleep Versions is a super-chill ambient EP, and Diamond Mine is a more folky outing with singer-songwriter King Creosote.  Alternatively, Imogen Heap or Brian Eno. Both are contemporaries of Jon Hopkins, and Brian Eno of course does huge amounts of work with Coldplay and is a goliath name in his own right. Other names worth checking out might be The XX, James Blake or SOHN."

Coldplay,35izqk,uttamo,12,Thu May 14 01:22:24 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for a more Viva mixed with a little Rush Of Blood to the Head sound. But I think that the band will end up going with a more A Sky Full Of Stars feel.

Coldplay,35izqk,nationpower,3,Tue May 12 20:16:47 2015 UTC,"I've always liked how they treated synths in X&Y and Viva la Vida - very ethereal. That kinda went away with the last two albums (besides Every Teardrop) and I really hope they make a return at some point in the future, preferably LP7."

Coldplay,35izqk,Camdenfalcon,4,Sat May 30 04:28:48 2015 UTC,"Loud, atmospheric, quasi-symphonic rock. A triumphant sound that can fill an entire stadium with energy. Something along the lines of Mylo Xyloto, but without the overarching electropop sound and with less production. Think ETIAW or Major Minus - only replace the synths with some face melting electric guitar. Death And All His Friends is a great example, too. It's a sound that would fit well with the themes we know of so far.  Either that or the entirely opposite direction, like an album that focuses on a haunting sound with an introspective and intimate feel. Even Parachutes would be a bit too in-your-face. I want to hear an album like some of their b-sides/non-LP tracks. If they could make album full of songs like For You and U.F.O. and Poppyfields and Moving to Mars, that would be awesome."
Coldplay,35izqk,quesoesbueno59,2,Mon May 11 04:01:23 2015 UTC,You and I would get along very well. I love those type of sounds and I think it would be freaking awesome if Coldplay went that route. ETIAW and DLIBYH are some of my favorite songs by them and I wish they'd make more like it.

I LOVED that song, and while I was bummed it didn't make it on the actual album, it made sense because it would seem out of place with the rest of the tracks. That being said, I hope it's the next step in the evolution of their sound. It reminded me of the adventurous feel that Viva has, along with the more bare-bones approach to rock music that they took with AROBTTH. Either way, I'm VERY exctied."

Coldplay,35ap3n,ThatFag,3,Fri May 8 15:02:22 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd seen this before! Hilarious. Do you think he forgot to take a mic with him or did he just purposefully go for a little run and then get stuck?!!
Coldplay,35ap3n,peanutismint,3,Fri May 8 17:33:22 2015 UTC,I remember an interview he did about this but I can't find the link.  I think they were one of the first acts of the day and he felt like he needed to do something to get the audience going. In a classic front-man spur of the moment he decides to run into the crowd.  Needless to say he regrets it
Coldplay,35ap3n,Matteratzi,2,Fri May 8 20:51:09 2015 UTC,I would love it if you or someone else finds us a link to that interview!

Coldplay,359xn0,notthathunter,3,Fri May 8 16:09:48 2015 UTC,See..... I don't think it's that good a song. In all honesty I usually skip it. And apart from the obvious standout hits like Clocks and The Scientist AROBTTH might be my lowest ranking Coldplay record :-$   (braces for backlash)

Coldplay,359xn0,DundahMifflin,1 point,Sat May 9 03:40:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree about Amsterdam, but I agree about the album as a whole. It's very quintessential Coldplay, but, it's just an okay album when you compare it to the rest of their work. I'm sure if I were a fan when it released though, I'd be in the other group."
Coldplay,359xn0,arjavrawal,1 point,Sat May 9 05:59:18 2015 UTC,"I was a huge fan when it was released and thought it was an awesome record back then, but I just feel like it's been slightly superseded by other newer, better albums."

I love making fantasy setlists as much as I love making playlists and mixtapes. It's fun to play with the ebb-and-flow of emotions during a set.

Coldplay,355eby,thepilotman,14,Thu May 7 06:38:51 2015 UTC,"To me it's about dealing with feelings after a breakup and realizing that just because things didn't work out, there was still a ""magic"" in the connection the two people had as ""true love"" in the world. This is especially noticeable in the last lines.  ""And if you were to ask me After all that we've been through Still believe in magic? Oh yes I do Yes I do."""
Coldplay,355eby,Peteos,4,Thu May 7 10:45:45 2015 UTC,"Well, as for the fact that Chris Martin says the album is about moving on in life etc.; I think it's about being happy with life, and that all of a sudden there's a problem and you're not happy, and when he "" still believe(s) in magic"" I believe he means he still believes he can have a happy life."
Coldplay,355eby,Renter_,3,Fri May 8 00:26:35 2015 UTC,"This may jut be because it's the interpretation that's relevant to my life, but I interpreted it as falling in love again with someone you've loved for a long time, especially the part about still believing in magic after all that we've been through."

Coldplay,350c34,antonistute,8,Wed May 6 07:59:14 2015 UTC,Probably one of my favorites off (imo) a kinda boring album.
Coldplay,350c34,MegaCoaster01,5,Wed May 6 03:25:46 2015 UTC,"I love: ""You see no meaning to your life, you should tryyyy-iiieee"" and ""come give her your own silver spooon"".

Coldplay,350c34,Silverflash-x,7,Fri May 8 01:23:28 2015 UTC,"I'll be that guy and say that Low is one of my least favorites off of X&Y. It's not a bad song by any means, and I've appreciated it more in recent years than on release, but it still isn't a favorite.    I will say that I love the the climactic refrain that begins 2/3 through the song (""I feel low, ohhhhh"") with the excellent guitar from Johnny. But it takes too long to get to that part of the song, IMO, since I find the verse and chorus rather uninteresting."
Coldplay,350c34,cyan_sunshine,3,Wed May 6 05:12:35 2015 UTC,"I actually like the beginning part, and I like the end part at first, but it goes on way too long. By their 10th time singing ""I feel low"" it's just old.  I think I might like it more if it were on a different album, though; X&Y is absolutely my favorite and after listening to Talk, then X&Y, then Speed of Sound, then A Message, Low feels like a bit of a letdown."

Coldplay,34wa77,JacksonSX35,2,Tue May 5 05:16:50 2015 UTC,It is a half step down! Is there a certain recording/performance you are trying to emulate?

Coldplay,34wa77,locustwind,2,Tue May 5 05:13:10 2015 UTC,So from what I can tell it's open E tuning but also a half step down. Then he plays little 3 note cords on the 3 low strings while leaving the other three notes open!

Coldplay,339oxg,Water_Fish,4,Mon Apr 20 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"I actually have two names to suggest if it's okay. ""No Rest No Peace"", and ""Nomad's Land"", a word play on the term No man's land   I derived both names from the idea that since the album can loop, it suggests that this story has happened and will happen many times. The idea of always encountering war and love seems to suggest Prospekt may be a sort of mercenary who, after the ""happy ending"" in The Escapist, will slowly go back to being a hired soldier for yet another war, and the story repeats. His career may have also have played a part in why he could not form a proper relationship with his love, and it questions whether if it was really true love in the first place.   In conclusion, I would like to bring out the idea that Prospekt never truly settles down, and is always moving between love and war or a blend of both."
Coldplay,339oxg,Water_Fish,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"I would like to extend this a little and say Prospekt may have never really changed for good, the scarring from ACT II, though appeared to be healed, will eventually take its toll on Prospekt till by the time of ACT I of the next cycle, he has regressed back to before his epiphany by Glass of Water."

Going deeper than that it also means ""A sudden, vast change in a situation, a discipline, or the way of thinking and behaving"" which he goes through many times throughout the story. From hopeful to confused -> sorrowful -> hopeless -> enraged -> accepting He bounces back and forth before coming full circle back to hope, playing with the idea that his story is almost like a never ending cycle of sorts, the revolve in revolution. Lastly it also gives hope to the character of Prospekt in that he might one day undergo a personal revolution, break the cycle, and emerge a better, stronger man once all is said and done"

Coldplay,337jj8,MattNOYB,9,Mon Apr 20 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"The title is too tight with the 'Coldplay' words, but the idea is not bad.

Coldplay,337jj8,Ayrgente,3,Mon Apr 20 07:18:04 2015 UTC,"Stay open minded. A Head Full of Dreams does not sound like a break up album at all. On the contrary, it sounds exactly what you're wanting.

Coldplay,337jj8,Ayrgente,2,Mon Apr 20 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"True, I could have moved them apart a bit more. That was an oversight.  And I didn't mean it'd be another break-up album, more like this would be the coming out of the forest afterwards. It'd be an album that quickly releases the shackles of Ghost Stories and sets forth on a new journey of hope and self-discovery. It would very much be in the vein of Viva/MX.  And yeah, I'll see if any ideas come to mind for that!"
Coldplay,337jj8,TimesNewBroman,5,Mon Apr 20 07:39:48 2015 UTC,"(I'm by no means a graphical designer, so apologies up front.)  Basically, this is just a hypothetical idea for a future Coldplay LP. I know there's already A Head Full of Dreams as an album title, but I personally hope LP7 ends up changing names last minute since it just feels too similar to ""A Sky Full of Stars."" Hence: A Forest for Trees.  The name came from the phrase ""can't see the forest for the trees,"" meaning when you are too close to a situation you need to step back and get a little perspective. It seemed like the sort of thing Chris would write about, especially as a post break-up album..uh...album.  That leads me to the art. I found an old map of Fort Worth, Texas on Google. The exact location doesn't matter as much as it being a super zoomed in shot of a very, very large map. It's looking at the minute details, and it's very easy to get lost in it. It's also why the words sort of melt into the background--they're getting lost as well. The key is to take a step back and see things for what they are, if that makes sense. Plus, the fact that it's ""Fort"" Worth sparks plenty of ideas for songs about guarded hearts and so forth."
Coldplay,337jj8,TimesNewBroman,3,Mon Apr 20 07:00:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's neat.  Maybe something you could toy with is putting Coldplay and A Forest for Trees as street names?

Coldplay,3338ay,peanutismint,3,Sun Apr 19 17:30:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that was interesting. Am I the only one who's never been fully on-board with Coldplay's switch from 'real band' to 'marketed product'? I mean, of the 'manufactured' rock bands of the world, they're still easily the best and actually have a LOT of creative control/input, but something about them having a '5th member' has just never quite sat well with me... Just something I thought about watching that video..... I guess they perhaps wouldn't have become this all-consuming world success without being 'managed' to such a degree (choosing what songs go out, what 'costumes' they're gonna wear on their next tour etc...) but then again I'd still love them even if they hadn't reached this huge stadium-rock level."
Coldplay,3338ay,DundahMifflin,6,Sun Apr 19 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"Phil Harvey, the 'fifth member', has been around since day one. It's not like he was the one who single-handedly morphed the band. They're all very honest with each other and very open, so it's a group effort sort of thing. Besides, they've been stadium rock since A Rush of Blood to the Head and have only progressed. Just because they aren't ""small"" anymore doesn't make them less great."
Coldplay,3338ay,peanutismint,2,Mon Apr 20 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"I'm Absolutely not equating their success with how much I like them; id love this band whether they were a huge worldwide rock act or just an under-the-radar indie band, I'm just a little conflicted sometimes at how many ancillary factors seem to determine their success, aside from their music...."

Coldplay,3335fa,cyan_sunshine,5,Sun Apr 19 06:44:02 2015 UTC,He's definitely not a Christian.
Coldplay,3335fa,tswaves,3,Sun Apr 19 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"Based on the song lyrics on Viva, I feel like Chris had the same view of God that I do - God is an abstract concept. God is the feeling when I listen to Coldplay or go outside at night and star at the stars.  Basically, God isn't a person. He's not saving us, he's not creating some afterlife. God is a feeling, a word we use to explain the inexplainable (""God is in the houses and God is in my head."")  He also uses God as a metaphor in Violet Hill - ""when the banks became cathedrals, and the fox became God."" I think that part of the song is talking about how the narrator was lookkng for hope and he never finds it. It seems to slip out of his hands. Maybe he turned to religion at one point, but didn't get the answers he was looking for. The priests clutching onto Bibles are just as scared as he is, and they're just putting on a facade. I'd say if he's a Christian, he's a pretty unorthodox one.  Anyway, that's just my interpretation. Obviously I don't know Chris personally, so maybe it's different."

He starts from song titles and tried to create songs from there. Check out this video and this one.
Coldplay,32vkq1,uttamo,5,Fri Apr 17 02:14:42 2015 UTC,"The other comment explains it well, but I know that the band used to try and play other band's songs without knowing how and come out with different sounds for their own music. That's how the Scientist came about, if I remember.   Also! There was an interview in which Chris admitted to popping sleeping pills prescribed for his insomnia in order to find some creativity late at night. He said they put him in a different place or something."

Coldplay,32vkq1,MattNOYB,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"While Chris seems responsible for the lyrics and a large portion of how the songs sound, it seems like he's been trying to push more collaboration from the band as a whole. On the track-by-track commentary of Ghost Stories, Chris said this about ""Magic"":  “Well, the song Magic represents a big deal for me which was that[...]we are very much a band and we always have been and we are more than ever. [...] I think the rest of the band, this was about 2 years ago, were like, oh something is up with Chris and i’ve been asking them for ages, please can someone please start a song and they were like, no, we like the system as it is. I like that system too but I came in one day and Guy said, oh, we’ve got something you may like to hear. They played me this loop and I thought it was just awesome and this song called Magic appeared in about 5 minutes and to be it represented them…I needed them as friends at that time and it delivered. They also provided our first single and that was handy!”"

His personal channel (cinemasins jeremy) has him voicing a lot of supportive opinions and such. So the fact that he made a music video sins video for coldplay just makes me happy. Plus, he recently started changing his channel from actually doing sins into just plain joking about the sins. So most of those are jokes, and not really things he would take seriously.   Plus he pokes fun at himself a lot, and shows himself listening to Miley Cyrus, so I wouldn't take his jokes too personally.

Coldplay,32igr6,gamedemon24,4,Wed Apr 15 02:17:28 2015 UTC,"The phrase ""Hurts Like Heaven"" sort of implies that the speaker is anxiously deciding whether someone (the girl I suppose) is good or bad. The key word being anxious. Then you have the instruments of the song which are also very jittery and ""OCD"". Then the themes of paranoia in Major Minus, as well as a similar vibe from the music, also tie into the conditions of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder."

Glass of Water portrays Prospekt doubting his future and wondering whether life will become better (""Will I see heaven in mine?""). Moving to Mars reflects his desire to fulfil his dreams of living in the stars. Christmas Lights portrays how he can't overcome his love being gone (""But I can't believe she's gone""), but he hasn't given up hope (""Maybe they'll bring her back to me / may all your troubles soon be gone""). 10 years later, they bump into each other, and it's been such a long time, and he tells her that he still loves her (Gravity). She confesses that her family made her leave him (I Ran Away, but she realizes that nothing matters except life and the love you make (Crests of Waves). She tells him that she'll do her best to gain back his trust (See You Soon). However, every time he tries to pull her close to himself, she always has to leave him (Ghost Story). But he still promises her that he'll carry her world and all her hurt (Atlas). But once again she is forced to leave him, and he tells her he doesn't want to die on his own tonight (Prospekt's March / Poppyfields). Things I Don't Understand shows how he's moved on from life because he's realized that it's just for living, and even though he doesn't want to live it alone, he'll still be able to find someone else, maybe her again (Life Is For Living). The Escapist concludes this journey, with Prospekt finally breaking out of his shell and meeting someone else."

Even if the song name isn't sung in the lyrics, you identify particular words with what is in that particular song. Obviously I am looking a little far into it, but I see this on the flipside with songs I don't like from Coldplay. ""White Shadows"" for example, is simply an interesting thing to read, but once I've listened to it (in my opinion hurhur), I don't think of the idea behind that title; I associate it with a song I don't like.   TL;DR: song titles can change the meaning of the words used in said title, and reflect the song in a particular light."
Coldplay,325lq0,firethorn43,7,Sat Apr 11 01:19:46 2015 UTC,It's because they have this special touch. They feel what's behind their music and they know how to express it in words and in song names.

Coldplay,32485u,Renter_,4,Fri Apr 10 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this seems to happen between most of their records. Chris always makes a vague quote referring to his mindset during the writing/recording process, which is to think of the record in progress as their last so that he holds no material back for any future record, and the media twists it and runs with it like wolves. Then a few months later he pops back up and casually explains that it's not going to be their last record even though he has to imagine it that way during the writing/recording process. Nonetheless, it leaves the media confused.  I do think that there is something different with AHFoD from the previous few records though, because he's said a couple of times that it's the final chapter in a saga, even going so far as to compare it to the seventh Harry Potter book. That excites me not only for AHFoD and it's, hopefully, explosive exclamation mark on this part of Coldplay's career but for LP8 and how it will begin the second saga of their musical gift to the world."

But then, (Atlas) he begins to feel to pressure of life and the troubles that one can experience. He breaks away from loved ones (Christmas Lights) and everything is starting to go wrong. But, at this point he's in denial, thinking that ""It could be worse"" (Crest of Waves). He loses the rest of his hope when he truly experiences the evils of the world (Prospekt's March) and realizes that complete optimism is pointless (Ghost Story). He becomes depressed and nihilistic (See You Soon) and decides he needs to separate himself from his world. He abandons everything he ever had to move far away (Moving To Mars), hoping it will all get better. But it doesn't. He becomes depressed at the thought of what he's done (I Ran Away), remembers the way he saw the world before (Postcards), and wonders why the world is as chaotic and unbalanced as it is (Things I Don't Understand). But then he realizes that there is good AND evil in the world (Glass of Water) but he needs to keep his head up and take the good days with the bad. He realizes that he can't ""spend his whole life living in the past"". He comes to the peaceful realization that ""Life is for living, we all know"" (LiFL), and he achieves inner peace and a quiet understanding of the world (Gravity). He ends his journey with the thought that everyone wants to escape from what exists, and are all looking for their happiness and peace (The Escapist)."

Coldplay,31nqk0,_SpanishInquisition,5,Mon Apr 6 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"Act I: Life   Life in Technicolor II Things I Don't Understand Crests of Waves Glass of Water Prospekt's March / Poppyfields Atlas Moving To Mars Postcards from Far Away   Act II: Love   Life Is For Living Ghost Story Gravity Christmas Lights I Ran Away See You Soon The Escapist   This album is a tale of life and love. In Act I, we follow our main protagonist, Prospekt, on his journey though life. The album begins with Life in Technicolor II. War is coming. It's a violent world and Prospekt can hear the sirens sound, however, he clings to the one thing he holds most dear: Love.  The world is a confusing place for Prospekt as evident in the lyrics of Things I Don't Understand. As frustration and anticipation builds, he cries out and shakes his fists at the world in Crests of Waves. Despite all of the chaos around him, he realizes that things could be much worse than they already are, and that nothing else matters except life and the love we make. At this moment, we begin to witness a change in how Prospekt views the world. In Glass of Water, Prospekt begins to understand that dwelling on the past will get him nowhere. In order to change the world around him, Prospekt must first ignite a change within himself.  War has arrived in Prospekt's March / Poppyfields. Prospekt fights for what he believes in. The battle begins to take its toll. He carries the weight of the world on his shoulders as if he were the greek Titan, Atlas. The war raged on and Prospekt endured, but the world became a different place. The remnants of the war are evident. Wreckage is everywhere and governments are overthrown. There is no future for Prospekt here. His only hope is to look up and venture out to new worlds that await him. Prospekt leaves this world on his journey past the satellites and stars in Moving To Mars. We end Act I and transition into Act II with Postcards from Far Away.  Act II is a tragic tale of love, loss and forgiveness. It begins with Life Is For Living, and we see Prospekt in a relationship that's on the rocks. He is apologetic for things he shouldn't have done and expresses that he does not want to live alone. In Ghost Story, we begin to see deeper problems within the relationship. Unfaithfulness? Betrayal? Prospekt is losing his voice and desires to be heard. He feels as if he doesn't exist. Questions like, ""What's the point of feeling love for you when you don't believe I'm here?"" and ""What's the point of trying to raise your voice if no one ever hears?"" begin to echo through his mind.  In Gravity, we witness the tipping point. Consider it a last-ditch effort to save the relationship. Prospekt is crying out, expressing his love. He loves her with every beat of his heart, but he begins to realize that things may be too far gone. Continuing on this downward spiral, their relationship finally breaks in Christmas Lights. Prospekt can't believe she's gone, but he clings on to a fading glimmer of hope that his love will come back to him.  Realizing that the love of his life is gone forever, Prospekt expresses his anger in I Ran Away. Distraught by the events that unfolded, he calls himself a fool for being with his love in the first place, that it was a stupid thing to do. Prospekt's emotions settle down in See You Soon. He begins to move on as he continues to reflect on the relationship. His love lost his trust when she never should have. He knows that he will see her again someday, whether up close or at a distance, but he must stay strong and not let his emotions and desire for love get the best of him. As much as it hurts to say, letting go and moving on is what's best for Prospekt. The album closes with The Escapist. Prospekt finally moves on. We sense a spirit of forgiveness as Prospekt wishes no ill will against his former love, but dreams of peace and happiness for both of them.  TL;DR: Just read it... :P"
Coldplay,31nqk0,JordanCox2,5,Tue Apr 7 11:55:37 2015 UTC,"My idea for the track list:  Life in Technicolor ii  Atlas  Moving to Mars  Ghost Story  Christmas Lights  I Ran Away  Crests of Waves  Things I Don't Understand  Glass of Water  Postcards From Far Away  Prospekt's March/Poppyfields  See You Soon  Gravity  Life is For Living  The Escapist  And for the story (I apologize, it's a little long):  A young man, Prospekt, is living a life that he doesn't want.  He feels he's stuck, having never chased his dreams, and now the world is on the tipping point of another major conflict. There's a Cold War, and society is on the brink (Life in Technicolor ii).  A few days before Christmas, and suddenly, his town is invaded. The war has begun.  He hears the gunshots (Atlas), but he's never been a fighter, and is overwhelmed, and in the fray, he meets a girl.  She's beautiful, bold, daring and courageous; everything he's not.  Despite this, they develop an attraction to each other while holed up in hiding. On a starry night, where there's been a lull in gunfire and bombshells, they have a moment together, and fantasize about leaving the wreckage of the war behind and moving to another planet (Moving to Mars).  Xyloto says she'll leave with him as soon as they win the war.  A few days later though, on Christmas day, things have changed.  They're losing the battle, and Xyloto is focusing more on the war than on Prospekt. The've been speaking less and less, and Mylo feels like he's not even there (Ghost Story).  Prospekt finally tries to convince Xyloto to abandon the town and escape so they can be together, but she refuses to budge.  She wants to stay and fight for their town.  They argue (Christmas Lights), and reluctantly, Prospekt flees, walking the streets still lit by the Christmas lights that were put up before the fighting started.  He only realizes then that he loves her, and wishes he could go back, but it's too dangerous (I Ran Away).  He makes his way to the seaside, where he joins a group of refugees escaping on a boat. They set out, (Crests of Waves) and he regrets his decision more and more, because ""nothing matters except life and the love you make"".   They make it away from the town, to a relatively safe coastline, and hole up in abandoned buildings by the sea. Prospekt is distraught at this point, and questions every decision he's made to get him to this point (Things I Don't Understand).  One of the elderly refugees sees the pain he's in, and shows him an old fortune telling trick with a glass of water, telling him if he spends his whole life living in the past, he'll go nowhere fast (Glass of Water). This finally snaps Prospekt out of his gloom, and he vows to become stronger.  He trains with the other refugees and becomes a true soldier.  Soon after, a courier finds their camp and gives Prospekt a postcard, with no writing on the back, only a picture of Mars on the front (Postcards from Far Away).  He instantly knows that it's from Xyloto, a message of some sort, and sets off on foot to return to their town to help or rescue her.  Along the way he passes by other war-torn towns, and sees the horrors that the survivors have endured.  It all seems strange, though, that with all the destruction, they're surrounded by beautiful, untouched poppy fields (Prospekt's March/Poppyfields).  As he camps one night in the poppy fields, he writes his own message to Xyloto on the back of the postcard, in case he doesn't make it there himself (See You Soon).  At last, he makes it back home, and after battling enemy soldiers and searching for hours, finds Xyloto alone in a bakery near the enemy's camps.  She's badly injured, and lost a lot of blood, but at the sight of Prospekt's face, lights up.  They embrace and Prospekt tells her how he received her message and confesses his love (Gravity).  Xyloto explains that they've lost the town, and that she was the last of the resistance.  She had given up hope, and crawled to the enemy's camp to set off a bomb and sacrifice herself to slow down their advancement to the other nearby towns.  She tells Prospekt to leave and save himself.  He refuses, and tells her he was wrong to leave her, and how much his heart ached when he thought of the things he shouldn't have done (Life is for Living).  He tells her that life is for living and she comes to understand.  He sets off the bomb's timer, and carries her (as he promised he would do in Atlas) and makes it to the safety of his camp in the poppy fields. The bomb goes off, but they don't hear it.  They're lying beneath the stars, finally together and at rest, dreaming of their escape from the war (The Escapist)  Dreaming of maybe someday settling down (or moving to Mars)  Dreaming of how maybe someday, they'll finally be at peace.  (First time doing this sort of thing, let me know what you think!)"

In the chorus, Gb/Cb is replaced with just Cb.   For Gb/Cb, mute the sixth string and lift your finger from the 5th string so whatever fret you're barring is played, with everything else a regular F chord pattern slid up a fret. In the case of Gb/Cb you'd just take your finger off the 5th string (so the 2 is played by the finger barring it).  For the very end, the chords go  Cb Db Ebm7"

Coldplay,31lk08,cyan_sunshine,2,Mon Apr 6 11:44:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds a lot like Coldplay, yeah. On the one hand, I love Coldplay, so that's not necessarily a bad thing. But on the other hand, I love Mumford & Sons. They get a lot of hate for what's perceived as mindless foot stomping and banjo jamming, but they have some fantastic lyrics and a really unique sound.    I didn't like their second album as much as their first (which is nearly a perfect album in my eyes) and their songs were starting to blend together, so I'm happy they're trying something new. I just hope they don't totally abandon what made them unique."
Coldplay,31lk08,Silverflash-x,2,Thu Apr 9 05:59:13 2015 UTC,"The whole atmospheric backing sound reminds me of elements of MX/ X&Y/Jon Hopkins. Even the ending drum part is like ETIAW/Miracles.

Obviously less banjo, and no foot stomping till the end, which is wierd for Mumford and Sons.  The first half of the song almost had a Ghost Storied feel, with the minimalist/bassy feel to it.  I only listened to it once, but I liked it."
Coldplay,31lk08,Vibrantspoon,0,Fri Apr 10 13:17:39 2015 UTC,The sound underlying the entire song is very very similar to ETIAW. Listen to when the vocals and instruments cut out at around 1:56 on Believe (just before the electric guitar comes in). Identical to the opening of ETIAW.
Coldplay,31jdew,Renter_,19,Sun Apr 5 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"I went to their MX tour concert in Houston.  It was fantastic, I still have the xyloband.  I'd rather not post the video as it features some rather embarassing singing on my part lol"

Coldplay,31jdew,jimmydushku,12,Mon Apr 6 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"I've seen Coldplay FOUR times, all in Toronto, and they are amazing every single time. They are wonderful musicians and showmen. Some artists' live shows don't do justice to their recordings which I always find super disappointing. Coldplay is just the opposite... They are BETTER live. They make you fall in love with their music again. 10/10 would recommend :)"
Coldplay,31jdew,Novah11,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:40:45 2015 UTC,Were you at the 2006 show they filmed for the unreleased DVD? It still bugs me that I lived in Toronto that year and was familiar with Coldplay but not a big enough fan to even know they were in town.
Coldplay,31jdew,MaGNeTiX,2,Sun Apr 5 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"My favourite show from that era by far. Always remember the date too as he mentions it during Politik!  ""It's Thursday, March the 23rd, 2006.

Coldplay,31jdew,4two,6,Sun Apr 5 22:35:57 2015 UTC,The production is amazing and they make sure it's a good time for the crowd. It's fun no matter where you're sitting and worth every penny. I brought a friend to the last one I went to and he said it was the best concert he's seen. He doesn't even like Coldplay and has seen a ton of other concerts.

Coldplay,31jdew,MaGNeTiX,5,Sun Apr 5 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"Been to several (once for VLV tour, twice on MX tour) and seen almost every live performance that's been televised.   Video from MX concert at The O2 in London, December 2011 - http://youtu.be/nGLEtBOlIxk  Probably my favourite concert as, despite the size of the venue, it genuinely felt intimate. Plus got Chris looking straight at me!  Instagram pics from Emirates Stadium - July 2012 http://imgur.com/a/JLxtr  Amazing concert again. Warning sign was one of the highlights for me, but turning round and seeing 60,000 flashing lights during Charlie Brown was simply breathtaking. Watch Live 2012 if you want to see what I mean!"

Coldplay,31jdew,randorolian,4,Sun Apr 5 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"Went to their July 1 show last year at Royal Albert Hall in London. It was amazing as the band were in the round in the middle and the audience was all around. Got to hear Midnight live which was incredible and they played some classics like Don't Panic, 'Til Kingdom Come and even Everything's Not Lost! Great night, I can't wait until they hit the road again."
Coldplay,31jdew,firethorn43,3,Sun Apr 5 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"I saw them in Glasgow, Scotland on the 3rd of December 2011 - the first Mylo Xyloto production show, and it was genuinely the best night of my life. I had been pretty obsessed with Coldplay for about 3 years before that, and I will never ever forget that feeling I got when I saw those 4 figures moving across the stage at the starts of the show just as they came on. It was the first show where the Xylobands were used aswell, so the crowd really had no idea what to expect - when the whole arena lit up the roar was insane. The setlist was also incredible too, they played Daylight, Politik and What If which was really special. I shot quite a bit of footage. It was actually a pretty small venue compared to some of the mammoth places the band normally play so that made it even more special. I also saw them perform at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland on June 7th 2012 which was also brilliant. I was further from the stage but the spectacle of seeing Coldplay perform in a stadium complete with Xylobands was really insane."
Coldplay,31jdew,missm0neypenny,2,Sun Apr 5 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"I went to a Tampa concert 3 years ago, and still the only concert I've been to. Magical! The wristband you get lights up, having the room look like a Christmas tree during Hurts Like Heaven"
Coldplay,31jdew,missm0neypenny,2,Sun Apr 5 19:39:37 2015 UTC,"MX tour in Boston, the second night. It was unbelievable. Still have my Xyloband and it brings back great memories. Amazing stage presence. Definitely worth the money & I will see them again."
Coldplay,31jdew,Gre3nArr0w,2,Sun Apr 5 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"also — they make a point to sing to/interact with every part of the audience, singing to all sides of the venue."
Coldplay,31jdew,cacahuete,2,Sun Apr 5 19:59:24 2015 UTC,I went to viva la vida tour which was great but it was before I loved there whole discography then I went to MX and it was the best concert I've been to yet. They put on the best show ever.
Coldplay,31jdew,TankBearz,2,Mon Apr 6 01:18:16 2015 UTC,Went to the show for MX in Madrid in 2011(2012?). It was incredible.
Coldplay,31jdew,venu_21,2,Mon Apr 6 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"I went to the MX tour in Toronto, and when the Xylobands turned on right at the beginning, it literally took my breath away. I stopped paying attention to the beginnings of Hurts Like Heaven and just stared in awe. It took me about 20 seconds to realized I wasn't breathing, and I started laughing realizing what just happened, aha."

We got to the stadium early also on the concert day, I was right in front and luckily could get in my camera.(cameras with retractable lenses aren't allowed at concert venues in South Africa).  One of the very best experience of my life till now. I can't wait to go  to another Coldplay concert.

Coldplay,31e1sj,SandstoneJukebox,2,Sat Apr 4 16:14:57 2015 UTC,"For the future, I would recommend finding an instrumental of one and an acapella of the other, instead of overlaying both of the original songs.

Coldplay,31e1sj,Karenleafry,2,Sat Apr 4 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that would be so ideal. Even when the chord progressions coincide and they're similar, there's a lot going on and I don't have the software or the materials right now to strip certain elements out of the songs, but I'd love to do that in the future."

Coldplay,312q40,19202122,5,Wed Apr 1 16:38:05 2015 UTC,Is Tidal an April Fools joke or do they really expect to be taken seriously?
Coldplay,312q40,mission17,3,Wed Apr 1 20:49:00 2015 UTC,"You can guarantee the next album will be exclusively available on Tidal a week before its actual release date (like iTunes preview). It's not a bad deal, $9 for 320kbs quality or $20 for FLAC quality. More expansive library than spotify. Would I spend 20 for FLAC? No but $9 a month isn't bad for the library at 320"
Coldplay,312q40,mission17,4,Thu Apr 2 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"Do you really need the quality?  Unless you have $1000 headphones, I can't see it making too much of a difference.  Spotify is free and Spotify Premium is affordable.  Tidal seems incredibly unnecessary."
Coldplay,312q40,Vibrantspoon,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Spotify premium is the same price as the equivalent TIDAL package barring the student discount. $20 for FLAC is kind of ridiculous I would agree, but the library will always be superior to Spotify's from this point forward. I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more labels edging away from Spotify as they will easily gain more revenue via tidal."
Coldplay,312q40,Noxate,2,Thu Apr 2 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"I wish the band would compile stuff like this more. I love their music, but I like to listen and discover new things. I would love to have access to a more comprehensive playlist that has music that has significantly influenced their sound."

Coldplay,30zs92,Noxate,10,Wed Apr 1 00:36:30 2015 UTC,Honestly made me feel so empty (in a sad way) that Chris was involved. The whole thing is just Jay Z trying to cut out the middle man and add another profit stream. Chris definitely didn't do it for personal interest because the Coldplay main channel uploaded all of their songs. I can only wonder as to why he did it.
Coldplay,30zs92,Vibrantspoon,8,Wed Apr 1 01:37:42 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying about the Coldplay channel, but IMO I do think Chris did it by choice. Maybe not out of personal interest exactly, but definitely by choice. Chris and Jay Z have been good friends since before the VLV era, and I'm sure that Chris was approached personally by him to be a part of this.  My best guess at least. I don't like TIDAL either. Very lame."
Coldplay,30zs92,fucdatsit,8,Wed Apr 1 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"It kind of sucks that Coldplay is involved. I remember watching an old interview where they said they didn't want to be part of the bullshit and the fake attitude of so many artists in the mainstream media, and to see them constantly being associated with these people is... idk... weird."
Coldplay,30zs92,cpm619,9,Wed Apr 1 02:58:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, say what you want but i feel like Chris has strategically taken over the band. Everything since post viva feels like a deliberate move from Chris to be more mainstream/recognizable/likeable by the masses and I can't say this doesn't contribute to that."
Coldplay,30zs92,socceraze,2,Wed Apr 1 04:57:57 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me how Tidal works? I couldn't get on the website from my phone.
Coldplay,30zs92,TimesNewBroman,2,Wed Apr 1 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"It's basically Spotify but for $19.99 a month for (what I'm assuming is) only marginally better quality, or you can pay $9.99 a month for ""standard listening."" Or something."

As for X&amp;Y, I love Square One, Speed of Sound, A Message, and Twisted Logic.  If I were you I'd get the albums on Spotify and give them a listen. That way, you can figure out what you like. I also have a general Coldplay playlist, which has about 100 songs (basically all of them I could find).  Oh! And I forgot great early Coldplay b-sides! See You Soon, For You, Crests of Waves, Murder, Gravity, Things I Don't Understand, and The World Turned Upside Down are my personal faves.  Sorry for the edits. I just keep forgetting stuff."

It takes me to nights of unrequited dreams, summery breezes, and the soft ember glow of the setting sun. The album has a woody, warm, end-of-the-night quality, something on the cusp, like waiting to finish the last sip of wine. If you want songs in particular, listen to ""sparks"" and ""we never change"". The next album was good, the next ok, and then I never really followed them after. For me, coldplay peaked with parachutes, which is neither good nor bad. The album was just so brilliant, I've never been able to get past it"

For cleanliness and organizational sake, I would highly advise against making 10-15 posts a day about each song. I'm sure us mods could easily set up an auto post where every few days the sticked post would change to a new song.  Would you all like it in a random order or to go album by album- song by song?"
Coldplay,304oqb,misterlittlebear,4,Tue Mar 24 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"I think if we did it in order we could explain how each song goes into the next, and it would make more sense. If we did the B-Sides as well, then those could be out of order."
Coldplay,304oqb,LonleyViolist,2,Tue Mar 24 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"I was thinking having a daily (weekly? Might take forever) sticky with the discussion of lyrics. Starting from the first album and first song on there would make sense. Maybe B-sides or there could just be a round 2 with rare songs/B-sides.  Personally I'd love some detailed analysis and happily several of people's opinion weighted in, so I'm not sure if there is a new one every day that we would get these good analysis.

Every night, I'll put on my headphones and listen to them for an hour or two, letting myself relax and find some peace in the day, no matter how hectic it was. That's the greatest thing Coldplay's music has offered me - a moment of relaxation in a life nearly always void of it."

Coldplay,2zyrlp,ASFOS,5,Mon Mar 23 10:52:57 2015 UTC,"Mylo Xyloto came out the night that my mum was having an operation to remove a tumour. I was obviously anxious on the night, and listening through it all in one go for the first time absolutely changed me. That album kept my whole family going for the following two years and i will always look back at it as an album that stopped me from falling apart to be completely honest (i realise that sounds a bit overdramatic, but im sure there are others out there that have had similar experiences). Whatever people say about these men, they will always be regarded by me as a vital part of my life; i feel honoured to have had an emotional connection to such a band.  Also, last year, Chris sent me and my sister a handwritten letter wishing we were well. Bearing in mind this was in the midst of his public break up with Gwyneth, it cemented in my mind that he is the greatest man alive and i honestly couldnt be any more grateful for what he and the band have done. I dont think they will ever realise how many lives they have affected. Thank you Coldplay."
Coldplay,2zyrlp,Dustygusher,3,Mon Mar 23 18:37:22 2015 UTC,You got a LETTER from CHRIS? How did he know about it?
Coldplay,2zyrlp,ASFOS,4,Mon Mar 23 22:40:46 2015 UTC,"i know i know, crazy right?! The day it arrived i thought it was a hoax, but my mum couldnt believe it either. Turned out it had involved her sending a hopeful letter to glastonbury festival saying how it was mine and my sister's first fest, and just mentioned that the the prospect of the festival, along with Coldplay and Foster the People, had helped us get through a tough year. Somewhere in the magic of Glasto, this letter must've got to Chris who decided to write one of his own back, hand write and post it himself! Turned out there were other amazing people within the festival that allowed us to watch Foster the People from the side of the stage too! It was, expectedly, the greatest week of my life."

I get it since it wasn't eligible for Crossroads...just makes my decisions much harder. gulp  BTW, how was it decided which songs didn't make this poll? Was it simply a matter of quality/availability? A few ones I noticed weren't here include:  -A Ghost  -Lost?  -Lhuna  -Don Quixote/Spanish Rain  -Wedding Bells  and most important of all...  -Ode To Deodorant"
Coldplay,2ztpoy,TankBearz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:26:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't knew anything about the song ""A Ghost"" so I'm sorry I didn't include it in the poll. I forgot also Lhuna and Ode to Deodorant. Damn I feel dumb! Lost? is 'simply' a piano version of Lost. I couldn't include EVERY piano version that Coldplay played because we would have too many songs in the poll. Even if Lost? is to me the best version.  Don Quixote and Wedding Bells are among my favorite songs BUT they are live recordings. I also didn't include The Dubliners even if it rocks.   I know it seems unfair and arbitrary but sometimes you need to make hard choices :/"

Coldplay,2zitex,Matteratzi,3,Thu Mar 19 00:13:12 2015 UTC,It's a lovely little tune and I hope Chris keeps the EDM/Dance stuff going. I feel like it's a very viable means of expression akin to some of the more upbeat coldplay songs.
Coldplay,2zitex,kirkrikster,0,Thu Mar 19 02:16:35 2015 UTC,The idea that there are Coldplay fans that WANT this to be a new song tells me a lot about where coldplay fans are at these days...

Coldplay,2zgp7a,Water_Fish,12,Wed Mar 18 13:12:17 2015 UTC,"Surprising, since Speed of Sound is Chris' least favorite song and he hates playing it live because he feels they never got the recording right.  After doing a little research: Chris was interviewed by Howard Stern on Nov. 9, 2011. During the interview, Howard suggested that Chris re-do Speed of Sound in concert to a point where he likes it. The Mylo Xyloto Tour began on Oct. 1, 2011, and I can't find any record of Speed of Sound being played prior to Spring 2012. I guess he took Howard's advice!"

Coldplay,2zgp7a,JacksonSX35,6,Fri Mar 20 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"Speed of Sound was the reluctant last addition to the Mylo Xylotour setlist, due to Chris' not-so-hidden disdain of the song. I personally don't like the song that much, but I know the crowd used to go wild when the intro came in, based on the two or three concert recordings I heard of it."
Coldplay,2zgp7a,Hoffmaster21,5,Wed Mar 18 17:59:13 2015 UTC,This is a great version. They put a good grove on it.

Coldplay,2zgp7a,cyan_sunshine,2,Thu Mar 19 00:29:55 2015 UTC,I was at this show! They played two nights in a row and my wife and I went to both of them! They had a photographer taking panoramic pictures of the crowd at every show and then they would post them on their web site a couple days afterwards. I printed out both pictures for each night and framed them because we can easily see ourselves in both pictures! Loved seeing them back-to-back! What a great time!

Coldplay,2z8d1t,Silverlakers,2,Tue Mar 17 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"I remember listening to this song in 2001, as a freshman in college when parachutes had just come out. We used to download music illegally back then, and I cherished every Coldplay song I could find. To me, it felt like I like Coldplay was a real band singing just for our young generation, with real honesty. Just being that person, and being excited to hear what they would do next, and experiencing the unbelievable reward of the first listen to ""a rush of blood to the head.""   There was something so special in those first albums. The youthful hope of the turn of the millennium maybe? Something missing from music now, but I'm also old."

Coldplay,2z1zro,JacksonSX35,3,Sun Mar 15 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"I entered some, but the new Rock Band will let you import past DLC onto the new one. In Rock Band 3, they had a Coldplay DLC (Yellow, The Scientist, Fix You, Viva La Vida, Clocks and ETIAW). So it is highly unlikely that they will add anymore :( It's all about the $$$, but maybe some of their other less known or newer stuff could make it???"

Coldplay,2ywrny,Peteos,4,Fri Mar 13 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"My personal two favorite albums of theirs are Viva and MX. Viva is just perfection and MX is a super up-beat, positive album that I fell in love with.  With that said a lot of people around here didn't like MX. So I think most wouldn't particularly care for Eno... though I'd love to have him come back."
Coldplay,2ywrny,Tomliness,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:25:21 2015 UTC,"That's true... Although I think the general ideas and upbeat sound of the record came from the band itself. I see Eno as just kind of a way to help the band perfectly communicate and express what they want to, not as the actual decision maker. If that makes any sense :P"
Coldplay,2ywrny,Peteos,2,Sun Mar 15 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"No no I agree - I just meant it as ""People see Eno having worked on those two albums, therefor most people automatically associate him with the sound""  I know the band is responsible for the actual sound and ""theme."" Eno keeps them focused. It's that focus that, to me, just makes them really get into the rhythm and keep the stuff fresh and exciting."
Coldplay,2ywrny,Tomliness,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:49:00 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily - most people like Viva, so it's a mix with him. I would like him to come back, but I also want Coldplay to keep moving forward with sound development. It may be time to have less Eno. He technically worked on the whole album but I don't really see song credit."
Coldplay,2ywrny,Qorinthian,9,Mon Mar 16 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"I once heard GS described as a ""low release"" (as much as possible). It's just the kind of album they wanted to make without pressure from anyone else. Now they're on to something new :) it was always the plan for a quick turn around"

Coldplay,2yuqtm,JacksonSX35,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:03:39 2015 UTC,Why is there soo much silence in that part? I never understood that.
Coldplay,2yuqtm,ImUnderYoBed,12,Wed Mar 18 04:16:19 2015 UTC,"Few examples:   A lot of songs have strings parts that are not played live (like Clocks and The Scientist). Acoustic guitar and piano for ASFoS and a lot of the other music isn't live. Will plays the acoustic guitar at the start of ETiaW but later when he's on the drums, a recorded version plays."
Coldplay,2yuqtm,uttamo,5,Fri Mar 13 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"A Sky Full of Stars' piano (and Magic's, by extension) are technically played live, but by a robot. Not really a robot, a MIDI program that can make the hammers move. But technically robot."
Coldplay,2yuqtm,JacksonSX35,3,Fri Mar 13 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the robot plays a recording of what Chris have played before. It's kida cool."
Coldplay,2yuqtm,Chribbex,9,Fri Mar 13 09:26:32 2015 UTC,"Most musicians use backing tracks during live performances. In Coldplay's case, there are so many elements to their songs, it's almost impossible for just the four of them to play everything in a live setting and make it sound ""full"". Obviously their main instruments are played live, but any extra fluff you hear is most likely the backing track.  Another example: Chris' vocoded vocals in Midnight aren't live. The Oracle says they are, but when they played at SXSW last year, Chris got a little off the track."
Coldplay,2yuqtm,JordanCox2,4,Fri Mar 13 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think, based off of the performance on Live 2014, they figured out how to do them live after SXSW."
Coldplay,2yuqtm,JacksonSX35,2,Fri Mar 13 01:58:52 2015 UTC,Isn't it that the vocoded backing he became off-track from is Will singing?
Coldplay,2yuqtm,droctagonapus,12,Fri Mar 13 10:33:37 2015 UTC,"Viva La Vida's strings are, though I think they mime them so it doesn't look too prerecorded."
Coldplay,2yuqtm,uttamo,7,Thu Mar 12 23:58:27 2015 UTC,I think there is a small synth part near the beginning that Jonny plays but stops soon after.
Coldplay,2yuqtm,JacksonSX35,3,Fri Mar 13 00:35:08 2015 UTC,That's the tack piano that give the early strings some extra oomph. Chris plays some before the second verse as well.
Coldplay,2yuqtm,OtherCartridge,5,Fri Mar 13 02:18:14 2015 UTC,"They use a backing track for Viva La Vida but Jonny is definitely playing the keyboard too, as you can see here:  https://youtu.be/kYtVHMj3rDU"
Coldplay,2yuqtm,misterlittlebear,2,Fri Mar 13 08:55:41 2015 UTC,"There's some tracks on AROBTTH that have a synthy string sound that is used in backing tracks, such as In My Place or Politik."

I feel the greater distance from the album, the tad but more appreciation, especially being those had slightly higher standard deviations (aside from parachutes... idk why that does...)"
Coldplay,2yrpu1,IronicCharles,3,Thu Mar 12 12:00:22 2015 UTC,"It hasn't really taken years for me, Ghost Stories is growing on me by each passing day. I didn't like it too much when it was first released."

Coldplay,2yrpu1,Easter21,2,Fri Mar 13 21:09:57 2015 UTC,What exactly does the Standard Deviation mean?
Coldplay,2yrpu1,uttamo,2,Thu Mar 12 17:27:15 2015 UTC,Approximately 68% of the data points are predicted to be within 1 standard deviation of the mean. It's a measure of how spread out a set of data is.
Coldplay,2yrpu1,Camdenfalcon,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"That assumes normal distribution. But yeah you're right, a higher standard deviation means that people's ranks varied more. If you look at ARoBTTH, for example, it has the joint lowest SD (along with Viva), which kinda makes sense because most people put that album as 1 or 2, so its ranking didn't vary as much as it did for others."
Coldplay,2yrpu1,Spartan1799,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:06:04 2015 UTC,Lets face it. All Coldplay albums are great :) Thats what is so special about this band! Parachutes is my favorite and MX is my least but I still love MX all the same!

Coldplay,2yoktj,misterlittlebear,3,Wed Mar 11 20:28:21 2015 UTC,They're OK. I don't think any of the songs have the energy of the tracks from previous albums. Too much electronic drums which I don't understand the purpose of. Will's real drumming is always great. Too much Avicii (sp?) I just find the whole thing boring and uninspired. And its a good thing I bought the Deluxe version bc w/o the bonus tracks it would be even weaker. No band can stay the same or put out the same types of songs over and over. I appreciate that they're trying to grow and evolve and develop their sound. I just think GS was a total failure. I don't know if the best song on GS is better than the worst song on any of the other 5 albums.

Coldplay,2yl05j,cyan_sunshine,8,Wed Mar 11 01:07:05 2015 UTC,"Out of all the tracks you listed I really only loved two. The rest ranged from 'meh' to 'ugh' for me, it felt like they knew they were too big to not succeed financially on Mylo and just put it out. I hear seeds of an amazing album, but it just didn't make it. Ghost Stories was mostly mediocre, I didn't hate it but it was forgettable outside of a couple of standouts."
Coldplay,2yl05j,clwestbr,8,Tue Mar 10 23:05:40 2015 UTC,Listen to Live 2012. It completely changed my view on the album. I used to hate it and now I have a new place in my heart for it.
Coldplay,2yl05j,SHERBREENA,6,Tue Mar 10 23:33:32 2015 UTC,I prefer the live version but the album still feels cobbled together for me. I'm one of those weirdos who thinks Major Minus is the best song on the album.

It is fun sometimes but a crown of 10,000 people isn't for me. I prefer the smaller (yet still fairly big) shows I've seen such as The Postal Service and Death Cab for Cutie. I've even seen smaller stuff that was super intimate, a couple hundred people crowded around a stage appreciating and getting lost in music. It is just more fun to me.  On the Live 2012 album I was forced to think it again but landed on the idea that it just isn't a good album. It has the right idea but botches the execution."

Coldplay,2yl05j,abattleofone,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"Mylo Xyloto was horrible but I strongly disagree that Ghost Stories was a horrible album. I think Ghost Stories is a more mature Coldplay. Not to say that their younger works were immature, but I think AROBTTH is full of young energy. Ghost Stories seemed as if they mellowed out a bit."
Coldplay,2yl05j,wildwolfway,3,Wed Mar 11 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to call you on that one. The sounds are mellow and more mature, but lyrically it sounds like a high school breakup album. Always in My Head, Magic, Ink (seriously, fuck Ink) are very childish."

Coldplay,2yl05j,kirkrikster,8,Tue Mar 10 18:40:02 2015 UTC,I think calling it a break up album is a bit of a stretch. Every song on that album is about falling in love with someone. The closest it gets to the spirit of break ups is probably when it deals with unrequited love. The only song that is probably about Gwyneth is O. That's it.
Coldplay,2yl05j,fucdatsit,24,Tue Mar 10 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"Always in My Head - ""My body moves, goes where I will, and though I try my heart stays still""  Magic - ""Call it magic, cut me into two. And with all your magic, I disappear from view. And I can't get over, can't get over you.""  True Love - ""I've lost you now, you let me go. But one last time. Tell me you love me, if you dont then lie, lie to me.""  Anothers Arms - self explanatory  Oceans - ""Wait for your call love, the call never came""  O- ""Fly on"""

Coldplay,2yl05j,clwestbr,7,Wed Mar 11 00:28:30 2015 UTC,Gwyneth probably influenced most of the songs one way or another.
Coldplay,2yl05j,Cykey,3,Tue Mar 10 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree! Every song on that album is about moving on! In addition to what /u/koalakid5 said:  Ink - ""And you wonder when you wake up will it be alright? Feels like there's something broken inside."" (i.e. knowing you're not good for each other, but still wanting to be with them regardless)  Midnight - ""When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone Leave a light, a light on."" (i.e. don't disappear from my life)  A Sky Full of Stars - ""I don't care, go on and tear me apart."" (i.e. You can leave me, but I'll still love you.)"

It's just an opinion. Just look at me for a second. I prefer their first four albums to their last two. Does that make me an asshole? Because it shouldn't. I'm talking very civilly and patiently right now, which, if I were an asshole, I would not be doing."
Coldplay,2ymtf0,5k1895,5,Wed Mar 11 02:51:55 2015 UTC,I'm not saying their opinions are the bad part of this. It's just that the way they're expressing these opinions isn't very civil.
Coldplay,2ymtf0,5k1895,2,Wed Mar 11 02:57:15 2015 UTC,"Understood. That said, I haven't seen much of that. I can't really imagine anyone on here (at least among the regular users) who would attack someone for having a different opinion."
Coldplay,2ymtf0,misterlittlebear,4,Wed Mar 11 03:07:00 2015 UTC,"On some level, I agree.  However, as fans of Coldplay, I think we can voice our opinion on an album if we think it isn't as good as previous efforts. This actually can be applied to any artist, and if the artist is looking for anything, it would be constructive criticism.  But I think some people should accept that the band will probably never return to an old sound, but evolve into a newer, greater sound. You're always going to see the ""thEir oldd stuf was wayyyyyyy beter!!11!1!"" comments about any artist, and I don't expect it to be any different for Coldplay. But as fans we reserve the right to give criticism, if we don't like the path they are taking. They take that into account. You need to see that this is more of a good thing than a bad thing."
Coldplay,2ymtf0,misterlittlebear,2,Wed Mar 11 02:38:20 2015 UTC,"I guess I wasn't clear enough. I can understand people who have these opinions, but some people go over the top with their bashing."
Coldplay,2ymtf0,cyan_sunshine,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"Well, there's really nothing anybody can do about that. They say what they say, and people who respect the band more will just ignore it. It's as simple as that. I don't usually see too much of that go down on this subreddit, we're a pretty chill fan club."
Coldplay,2ymtf0,Silverflash-x,4,Wed Mar 11 03:06:59 2015 UTC,"I don't like the bashing either, but I know from experience that it could be much worse. I used to be in the fandom for a certain TV show (and keep in mind, this was a huge fandom), but everywhere I turned on the internet, people were bashing the show's writer. It was like they refused to talk about anything else. The thing was, I actually liked this guy's episodes. And while I agreed with some of what they were saying, there was so much bashing that I could tell there was no place for me in the fandom. I became so disillusioned that even the show lost its spark. I don't watch it anymore.  /r/coldplay isn't like that. I feel like there's a place for me in this fandom, even though X&Y is my favorite album (and, to make matters worse, I think it should end on Twisted Logic). When I did the survey, it was really cool to see all the diverse opinions. A lot of people's favorite songs were on their least favorite albums, which told me that people weren't just outright hating. And I like that."
Coldplay,2ymtf0,cyan_sunshine,2,Wed Mar 11 11:18:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I know this isn't really related to the point you're making, but you don't like Till Kingdom Come? That sort of blows my mind."
Coldplay,2ymtf0,Renter_,3,Thu Mar 12 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's not as much that I don't like the song that I like Twisted Logic as an album closer. I think it's similar in theme and sound to Square One, which makes it wrap up the album nicely. (As far as I know, I'm the only one that thinks this, though, so I'm probably delusional. But that's the reason.)"

Coldplay,2y3m4u,GenuinelyNathan,6,Fri Mar 6 03:28:40 2015 UTC,"I might be able to tab it out. I've been messing around with it for the past few minutes and I've almost got the tuning; once I have that then it shouldn't be too hard. Just trying to figure out what the 3rd string needs to be at the moment.  Edit: So I'm 99% sure the tuning from low to high is Eb-Ab-Db-F-Ab-Eb. The tuning from the thread I found on coldplaying isn't right. I'm not totally sure about the 3rd string since I can't find anything in the video to give it away, but the most reasonable justifcation is this part here, from 29-31. You can hear an F ringing a bit and it stands out in the chord because he's unintentionally bumping it while he's strumming.  Edit 2: Sorry I'm not great at this but I'll try format what the chords should be. Here's what this should sound like.   So for the verse, here are the chord shapes you need to be playing:  Eb|--0---0---0---0--  Ab|--0---11--0---0--  F .|--0---10--10--0--  Db|--12--12--7---7--  Ab|--12--12--7---9--  Eb|--10--0---9---9--  There are 4 main chords in the verse and a strumming pattern as well, but you should be able to get that from listening to the song. Then the chords in the chorus:  Eb|--0--0--0--0--  Ab|--0--0--0--0--  F .|--7--8--7--3--  Db|--7--7--7--4--  Ab|--5--7--0--4--  Eb|--x--0--x--2--  And sometimes, he plays the 3rd chord in the chorus like this:  Eb|----0--  Ab|----0--  F .|----7--  Db|----7--  Ab|----7--  Eb|----5--  Hopefully that makes some sense!"

Coldplay,2y3m4u,WaxyPumpkin72,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:21:04 2015 UTC,"Well it looks like you got it worked out! Haha. :) let me know if you have any more questions though. Another tip I'd suggest is to not neglect using your thumb to fret on awkward chords! You can wrap it around the neck and press bass notes relatively easily; it should help with some of these chords.   For future  reference, yes,  D# and Eb are the same."
Coldplay,2y3m4u,Renter_,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:51:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, a problem that posed me. On the first chord for the chorus I was having trouble trying to mute it, but wasn't a major problem.  Thank you again so much, you've helped me out a good deal :)   Edit: you should also think about posting your tab on guitar sites? Or in the coldplaying forum because I know many people have been trying to figure it you and you nailed it"
Coldplay,2y3m4u,WaxyPumpkin72,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:02:43 2015 UTC,"If you wrap your thumb around the neck a bit and rest it on the bass string (not next to a harmonic, mind you) then it should effectively mute that string while you're strumming. Also like I said before, you can put more pressure and actually fret that string if you need to. But slightly pushing into it will mute it.   Eh, too much work. :) I don't really feel like compiling it into a readable format. Also it's still not entiiiirely correct and I'll get a ton of annoying feedback so I think I'll pass!   Feel free to share it yourself, though, if you want to."

Coldplay,2y0qac,abattleofone,8,Thu Mar 5 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting forever to listen to O with that 3 minutes of silence. To me, that length of silence is the most important part of the album. Was it a mixing mistake? Maybe? I don't know; if it was, then it was a great mistake.  To me, this album is about moving on; it's about living after feeling like life has ended. O wraps up the album before fading away to silence, but it's silence in the John Cage sense. Now that you've finished falling into such an emotional album, the silence snaps you back into reality. It brings your world into the song. This album is suddenly about you. This is about you and the cars passing outside your bedroom or the chatter of the coffee shop or the chatter of birds in the morning - no matter how heartbroken you are, listening to Ghost Stories over and over again, it keeps bringing you back and telling you:  ""Look how beautiful your life is. Appreciate it. Embrace it. Move on. Life is worth living."""

Than I completely forgot about it until Ghost Stories came out and Midnight became on of my favorites off the album. Ah this brings back soo many memories from summer. goes into deep depression
Coldplay,2xpx2k,Renter_,8,Mon Mar 2 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's and electric Yamaha GT20, painted to the MX color scheme. He uses it because he can switch sounds from the organ in Fix You to the piano in Paradise. Pretty cool, if you ask me!"
Coldplay,2xpx2k,misterlittlebear,2,Mon Mar 2 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's an actual acoustic piano; it has real action, hammers, and strings. But it also transmits and receives MIDI data, which is how we hear many different sounds created by it."
Coldplay,2xpx2k,th9109,2,Tue Mar 3 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"No idea what make it is, but I do know that the band has had it for years - they took it on tour for Viva then repainted for MX."

Coldplay,2xp1o8,misterlittlebear,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:16:42 2015 UTC,The only difference between them is the case and the booklet.  Everything else is the same.
Coldplay,2xp1o8,SparkG,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:32:44 2015 UTC,The CD cases are really just less common on releases like this. No difference otherwise. Same with Live 2003 and 2012.
Coldplay,2xozdj,akashlevy,6,Mon Mar 2 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"I've always heard Chris singing it as, ""But it won't change a thin."" Maybe it's because he's British, or maybe it's because he's just Chris, but he often distorts words from their actual pronunciation.  The best example I can think of is in Paradise: ""When she was just a girl, she espected the world."""
Coldplay,2xozdj,DundahMifflin,2,Mon Mar 2 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah on their website the lyric is written as ""thing"", I just think it's his pronunciation."
Coldplay,2xozdj,XNY,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:52:04 2015 UTC,"The band has said that they don't include the lyrics in their CD's because they want listeners to interpret the songs however they want. Often times, two people will have two completely different views on what the song is about."

Sure, some songs would be nice to hear, but to just add those to an old setlist seems boring. I'd rather see them put out the album we've all been waiting for, the one they've clearly had planned for a while, and unleash it in a wave of euphoria on the masses at Glastonbury."
Coldplay,2xnzm9,IronicCharles,2,Thu Mar 5 03:55:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I think they saw how it would play out if they performed. It is their favorite place to play a concert at as well.

Coldplay,2xnigw,CaptainFalconsFist,2,Mon Mar 2 11:01:20 2015 UTC,"Just gonna tap onto this. I'm fairly confident I've heard someone, probably Chris, say it's something like honey and ginger.  All I know is, a lot of voice actors use concoctions like this. Andy Serkis did for Gollum in Lord of the Rings. I'd imagine it's relatively similar to what Chris uses. I know singing and doing crazy voices is different, but it would have the same effect."

Like, that song is so god damn fucking good. Heck, that whole album is my idea of a perfect album. Objectively i'd say it even tops AROBTTH, but due to what AROBTTH means to be it just stays top.  Honorable mentions go to the entire discography of Arcade Fire, the only reason I haven't mentioned any songs is because I can't pick. Normally I listen to full albums, and AF works waaay better as complete albums. The same can be said about the National, it was pretty hard just picking those two."

However, it does come down to opinion. If you want some more relaxed, acoustic songs, you could buy Parachutes. If you wanted electronic, you could buy X&Y. If you want electronic with some poppy feeling, then Mylo Xyloto, and a mix of it all in a Ghost Stories. So buy what you think you would enjoy the most."
Coldplay,2wy7vc,misterlittlebear,9,Tue Feb 24 03:35:35 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about getting A Rush of Blood to the Head and Mylo Xyloto, so I'll probably go with that or Viva La Vida over Mylo Xyloto."

I'd get the albums on Spotify or listen to the iTunes snippets to figure out which ones to get. (Also, if you buy Viva, get the Prospekt's March edition. It has a bunch of extra songs for way cheaper than they would be otherwise.)"
Coldplay,2wy7vc,thunderingtyphoons,2,Tue Feb 24 11:33:47 2015 UTC,Best two? A Rush Of Blood To The Head and Viva La Vida.  My favourite two? X&Y and AROBTTH.

Coldplay,2wuwek,misterlittlebear,9,Mon Feb 23 09:58:16 2015 UTC,One of my favorite Viva era B-Sides!! It sounds like everyone's having so much fun on this song. Can't help but smile when I hear everyone sing :)
Coldplay,2wuwek,Touch_of_Glass,3,Mon Feb 23 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely a gem. Brian Eno is clearly audible during portions of the song and could be the best part of the track. His voice adds a deep tone that (with the main band) gives the melody volume and thickness. Also part of its charm is, well, how charming it is. You can hear the guys chuckling during lyrics and in between stanzas, and the joy they're having in the studio is just plain infectious. It's like a saloon sing-along from the 19th century wild west. There's a lot to like in this b-side, and any time the full band is harmonizing (plus Brian Eno, no less) its a must listen!"
Coldplay,2wuwek,cpm619,2,Mon Feb 23 21:28:48 2015 UTC,"Easily one of my favorite B-Sides, really captured the essence of the Viva era. Would love to see them do more quirky folksy type songs but sadly that doesn't seem like the musical direction they are headed in."
Coldplay,2wuwek,Silverflash-x,2,Wed Feb 25 02:21:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely love this song. It's just infectious and fun. Very few other Coldplay songs can match the level of joy you hear from the band in Goldrush.

Coldplay,2wiwmm,TankBearz,7,Fri Feb 20 11:46:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like Another's Arms never really has a chance with its lyrics and dull (for lack of a better word) nature overall, but I think they missed out adding/keeping most of the guitar throughout the song. Many of the live versions have a much more prominent guitar throughout that definitely helps it out. But honestly, whether or not I skip that song depends entirely on if I want to put up with the rest of it to hear the solo."

But if my experience is any indication, this is an album that really grows on you, and I mean by a LOT. Even though it's very different from standard Coldplay in many ways, it's risen the ranks to be one of my favorite albums by them. It's nowhere near the strongest lyrically, but it's amazingly atmospheric. Just crank up some good headphones, close your eyes and let it soak in. The story it follows from being in love to moving on is, well, moving and I really felt every word Chris is singing. Go on and give a shot, just know it's not the happy-go-lucky experience Mylo Xyloto mostly was."

Coldplay,2wi5x3,josh21218,14,Fri Feb 20 02:31:14 2015 UTC,I don't blame you for feeling that way. Overall this album is a chill listen through but doesn't have that same lasting power that other albums have. Many of the songs don't really go anywhere and feel almost purposely anticlimactic because they were trying to make a softer sounding album.
Coldplay,2wi5x3,cpm619,3,Fri Feb 20 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I know I will be able to listen to Viva or AROBTH for the rest of time, but Ghost Stories? It'll probably be significantly ignored"
Coldplay,2wi5x3,Dustygusher,5,Fri Feb 20 23:40:09 2015 UTC,"I would disagree, I think Midnight is absolutely amazing and the instrumentation and mood of Magic is just legendary. But yeah, the album isn't as huge as their first 4, but I still love it to pieces."
Coldplay,2wi5x3,Dustygusher,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:48:02 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what was your first album by Coldplay to listen to? I wonder if your opinion on this album has to do with where you started in the band's history."
Coldplay,2wi5x3,Walkaround1,1 point,Fri Feb 20 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"Viva la Vida, so 2008-2009. I still like their first four albums more, but not by much."
Coldplay,2wi5x3,marimbaguy715,3,Sat Feb 21 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"I did the same, it might be the different emotions im feeling at the moment, or it could be im just hearing the music for what it is.   I still have a soft spot for 'Always in my head', 'True Love' and 'Sky Full of Stars'.  Stating the obvious but not a patch on anything before 2010."
Coldplay,2wi5x3,IronicCharles,4,Fri Feb 20 08:48:15 2015 UTC,"I love listening to it top to bottom, but most of the songs on their own don't interest me as much as they do together.  It's kind of like parachutes to me: love the album, but I'm not really in love with any of the songs"
Coldplay,2wi5x3,Gre3nArr0w,2,Fri Feb 20 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"I actually feel like upon first listen, the album seemed like it could've been more, and that it wouldn't be a strong album relative to the rest. But over time, I've actually started to consider this one of the stronger one in terms of lasting power. The only song I admit that I occasionally skip is Another's Arms, however, I do like the song for what it's worth (a kickass solo and some nice live renditions). But going through Always In My Head, and ending with O (well, Ghost Story actually), it's been consistently enjoyable for me."
Coldplay,2wi5x3,clwestbr,3,Sat Feb 21 06:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yup, Always in my head and O are the strongest songs. I really don't like the album much at all. They all say the same thing pretty much. I don't have high hopes for HFOD just because I had high hopes for MX and was let down and had high hopes for GS and was let down.  The creative side of me says HFOD will be a lot like GS a year between an album isn't enough to fully develop and change your sound to make something completely new. I hope after HFOD they take a break from music and come back with something completely different like what they did with VLV."
Coldplay,2wi5x3,EED416,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:06:25 2015 UTC,"My hope for HFOD is that it is made of songs that were made during the GS era that they thought were too upbeat for the album. If it is a collection of Miracles-esqe songs, I won't be floored but it'll be easier to listen to"
Coldplay,2wi5x3,MattNOYB,2,Fri Feb 20 23:41:43 2015 UTC,"Their last 2 albums have been lackluster, but I'll say that Ghost Stories was less needy and I applaud it for that. Not a good album, but a good try.  EDIT: 'Their', not 'They're'."
Coldplay,2wi5x3,ramzy2,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"I guess I get why people don't like it, but I thought it was actually pretty solid. Oceans was by far my favorite song on there though, so I definitely disagree with all the hate for that song. But I believe this album was much better than Mylo Xyloto."

Coldplay,2wa28q,Spartan1799,13,Wed Feb 18 05:26:42 2015 UTC,I uh.. In second grade sang Viva La Vida for the talent show and dressed up like Chris Martin.

Coldplay,2wa28q,Timothy-H,2,Wed Feb 18 08:14:23 2015 UTC,"I think Ghost Stories was the coolest clothing style. Probably because it was such a contrast to the MX outfits, they just looked really sophisticated."

Coldplay,2w30w3,misterlittlebear,5,Mon Feb 16 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"For me, this is just so good because the original version of yellow is so joyous and full of energy and we've all felt that feeling when you're so in love with someone you feel like the stars shine for them.  Then this version. It's the polar opposite. It's so forlorn and sad, yet the lyrics and melody are the same. For me, it became about someone that I loved very much but couldn't have anymore. All the lyrics still applied, I still felt like the stars shined for her, but to borrow from Pearl jam's 'black', those stars were no longer in my sky. And the tone of this version, singing the same lyrics I used to sing so happily, just rip my heart to pieces. No other acoustic version of a song has ever made me feel like that."
Coldplay,2w30w3,spinblackcircles,2,Mon Feb 16 23:12:02 2015 UTC,I love how they used a touch of vocoder like they did later on in Midnight.
Coldplay,2w30w3,fucdatsit,2,Mon Feb 16 16:41:40 2015 UTC,What was this released on?

Coldplay,2w418w,MattNOYB,4,Mon Feb 16 22:36:39 2015 UTC,"I don't really interpret this as wanting to be noticed, but rather about escaping his current life. He wants to get out of this place where he is choking on the atmosphere--it's not a healthy place to be for him metaphorically. Being bigger, stronger, driving a faster car is just a way of saying he wants things to change for the better. He wants the courage to leave and improve his life. If only there was some way to do that at a touch of button, since there's no way it'll be easy.  Or maybe it really is about his old Civic."

Coldplay,2w3m63,cyan_sunshine,8,Mon Feb 16 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"In 2008 (6th grade) my brother bought Viva la Vida, Cemeteries of London, and Life in Technicolor II on iTunes. I really liked them, like really really liked them, and I watched the Life in Technicolor II video over and over and over on my then dialup internet, which was brutal :P. I didn't explore them much more than that, because I didn't listen to a whole lot of music in Gr. 6. One day, when my brother that bought those songs was house sitting, I was watching TV and the Grammys were on. Coldplay won for Viva and Lost or something, and the performances were so good I started to really get obsessed with Coldplay. Later on in the year an Australian exchange student was in my class, and one day he was singing Viva la Vida, and I was like OMG YOU LIKE COLDPLAY TOO? Then I bought all their albums and listened to them in the summer, and I was absolutely blown away. So since the beginning of 8th grade I've been obsessed with Coldplay ever since, and for a long time they were the only thing I listened to. I've ""converted"" many people, and when Mylo Xyloto came out I almost died I was so excited. Same with Ghost Stories. And I saw them live in 2012 which was freaking the best day of my life! Anyway, that's how I got into Coldplay!"
Coldplay,2w3m63,Dustygusher,7,Mon Feb 16 20:03:18 2015 UTC,"I was like 7 when I heard Viva La Vida. I've been a fan since day 0, my dad always played coldplay. I get so much nostalgia listening to ARoBttH. I'd be in 2nd grade and ask people ""hey, you like coldplay?""  ""Who's that?"" And now I'll ask and they'll say ""I like magic that's it.""  siiiighhhh"

Most people know a few of their songs, like The Scientist, Fix You, and A Sky Full of Stars, and their Facebook page has more likes among my friends than almost any other artist, but I still have yet to find another superfan. Nobody's even heard of Keane and Snow Patrol, my other favorites. Yet, I still hold out hope that there's another superfan out there."

Coldplay,2w3m63,Juincey,8,Wed Feb 18 00:07:18 2015 UTC,"I was born in 1997, so I would have been 3 around when Parachutes came out. My dad bought the album for my mom as a gift, and she loved it, played it all the time. My whole family loves the group, and our house has had Coldplay playing pretty much non-stop since 2000, buying and listening like crazy to each new album. So, Coldplay has just been a part of my life for about as long as I can remember. Around the time that I became old enough to really appreciate music as something more than just pretty background noise, around age 10 or 11, I started off by diving into the music of both Queen and Coldplay, listening to the two on my own time. Those two groups are what really got me to love music, and it's interesting to me that Coldplay was a band that I remember enjoying before I really started to even understand and listen to music on my own. I'm sure I'll love their music for the rest of my life, and it will always be nostalgic to me."
Coldplay,2w3m63,fucdatsit,2,Mon Feb 16 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to get my family into them. I played my dad Talk because he likes Kraftwerk, and I told my mom she should listen to Viva. I don't know how seriously they're taking my recommendations, though."
Coldplay,2w3m63,LonleyViolist,3,Tue Feb 17 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"The music video for Paradise grew on me. I watched a million times. I decided to check their albums on youtube and I was fascinated by how versatile their songs sounded, and the thing that made me a fan was their personalities and their image. They're nice and down to earth, without seeming fake."
Coldplay,2w3m63,Dustygusher,3,Mon Feb 16 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"My story could have ended very badly. In 4th grade, I remember hearing Viva on the radio constantly. I was quite annoyed by it, really. Once I stopped hearing it so repetitively, I forgot about it until I saw a ""music video"" on YouTube set in a certain mideval-set online game I was prone to playing. I really listened to it then, and LOVED it. I asked my parents about this newfangled band, and my dad luckily had all four albums on a CD his friend had burned him. I only listened to Viva for about a month, then the rest of the album and Clocks. That summer of '09, my family took a trip to Niagara, and surprised me with concert tickets to their show in Buffalo! Great seats, too.   I guess it was all downhill from there :p"

Coldplay,2w3m63,flumpy_pumpy,3,Wed Feb 18 05:34:53 2015 UTC,"I started playing piano around 2 years ago, and became a fan shortly after. So I'm a pretty new fan, with GS being the only album released since I started getting into them.  My piano teacher is a big Coldplay fan, but when I stated taking lessons I only knew the popular stuff; Clocks, Viva La Vida, Paradise, etc.. I never was a big fan of Chris' voice though. Then one night watching The Voice, a girl sung The Scientist. She did it beautifully, and I loved the meaning in the lyrics. So I started a Coldplay station on Pandora, and fell in love with many of there songs. As I gained experience in piano, I began to appreciate it more, and thus I began to like Coldplay even greater.  So here I am now! :)"
Coldplay,2w3m63,zacarooni,3,Mon Feb 16 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"In middle school, I listened to all of the popular songs everybody knew. Clocks, Viva La Vida, The Scientist, Yellow, and Speed of Sound. I never really listened to just Coldplay, but I liked some of their songs. That all changed the summer between Freshman and Sophomore year in High School, when I went with my friends to see Coldplay live in Dallas in 2012. The concert was INSANE! I listened to all of Mylo Xyloto before the concert and I felt terrible that I didn't know a lot of the songs they were playing (warning sign, lovers in japan, in my place, etc.). That is when I fell in love with Coldplay. Over the next couple of years, I've listened to all of their albums, b-sides, and live CDs. I still listen to other bands (DCfC, Tokyo Police Club, Bonobo, Alt-J, etc.), but Coldplay will always be my favorite band."

Ever since then I have been hooked. Im so much of a fan I check websites like coldplaying and this sub reddit daily for news on new music and what the band is up to.   23/07/2003 was the day I became Coldplay a fan

I really liked it so I went and figured out what it was, which led me to look into the band some more. I kept buying individual songs from iTunes that I liked until I basically had all their albums.

Coldplay,2w3m63,geekleyweekley,2,Wed Feb 18 05:12:57 2015 UTC,"Oh man. Here we go.  So I first heard Coldplay when I went to youth group in the 8th grade in Summer 2008. Funny thing about that is that I probably went to that youth group about 3 times because some people that I didn't get along with went to the same youth group. Its funny now because I'm not even that religious.  Anyways, It was after the youth group was over where everybody hung around for a few minutes and just kept chatting with friends. I was talking to one of my buddies when I heard the rhythmic strums of the violins from ""Viva La Vida."" Now I had picked up on the the song because it sounded familiar to me for some reason. I had never listened to that song before so I don't know why.   Flash forward to the beginning of my freshman year of high school where I went to a small private school that handed out MacBooks to every student. I wasn't really into music for some reason besides having a couple Fray tracks downloaded onto my PSP (didn't even have an iPod lol). So when I got this Macbook i felt this was the perfect time to download music because iTunes was the shit and owning a Mac just felt like I should download more music since thats what it was known for. One day in class I noticed one of my friends also playing around in his iTunes and saw that one of the Tracks he had on there was ""Viva La Vida"" so when I got home that day and downloaded the song on iTunes or some random bogus site (can't remember that part right lol). I literally listened to Viva la Vida all night. It was pure bliss. One of the happiest moments in my life. Now for me personally I'm not that outgoing and don't express myself as much as one probably should. Listening to Coldplay fixed that. I felt like it did that for me. It was almost like the band was reading my mind. speaking my thoughts. The next song I downloaded was Clocks when I saw a friend have that on his iTunes library. Fix You shortly after. It was amazing. I thought this band was so good! Then I started to delve into their older stuff... Parachutes and their earlier EPs. (This is actually my favorite coldplay stuff ironically) Oh my god it was fucking awesome. Yellow was beautiful. Sparks made me cry. Shiver made me vow that one day I'd treat my wife with unending love. Everything's Not Lost gave me hope when I thought there was none. This band and their songs have saved me from deep depression and weep tears of joy. I fucking love this band. I was so enamored on how young they were. These dudes were in their early 20s when they started making music and got big. That had to be fucking awesome. I would listen to Parachutes all damn day. It kept being awesome when I discovered there were other tracks on X & Y and Viva and AROBTTH. So awesome. I could keep going but fuck it this is probably too long anyways."

She had Parachutes and I always loved when she put it in the player in the car. She introduced me to such beautiful music.  Im seventeen now, and she left the world in 2013.. Now whenever I listen to songs like Everything's Not Lost, Sparks, Yellow, We Never Change, ect. I think of her, and sitting in the back seat of her Mazda.. Music is magical, my friends."

Coldplay,2w3m63,Renter_,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"The earliest album I remember listening to, is AROBTTH when it first came out. Wow, I was 4 when it came out. I remember listening to Clocks in the car. I also remember hearing quite a bit of X&Y when I was a young kid, and Viva La Vida. My dad was a fan, and has been to a few concerts. I didn't really listen to much music on my own though, so I didn't know about the band until I was probably 12 (I knew the music, just not the band). When I was 12, I was sleeping over at a friends house, and he played Viva La Vida for me. I got instant goosebumps, and a really great feeling from it. The next day, I learned Viva La Vida and Clocks on the piano. My dad hear me playing them, and told me that was Coldplay, and that I would like them. I'm sure glad I kept listening to them. Coldplay often times give me a nostalgic feel. Even for older songs."

The song itself IMO is one that doesn't need 'precise' lyrics and could have done with more 'ambient' words (like how Muse executed Madness lyric video). That's my opinion anyway.

Coldplay,2v8z1k,cpm619,7,Mon Feb 9 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"I take a more conflicting view on it. No I don't  particularly enjoy the song. I respect the thought process to justify its place in flow of the album, but outside of that it lacks the originality of a massive coldplay hit, ie Viva La Vida.   It takes the formula of edm and drowns out almost all the instrumentation with Chris singing , in my opinion, uninspired lyrics. It's catchy and I get that, but it does feel like it's there because they needed a pop hit to market the album and Chris loves that type of music. It did cause some controversy between the rest of the members and from what I gather it was one of, if not, the last song placed on the album.   This is coming from a huge fan of the band, but with the opinion that their best work was on LPs 1-4 so you may take what I say with a bit of bias."

It's much better than a lot of the EDM stuff out there, and Coldplay fully has a right to experiment with lots of genres. Personally, I find magic in the night, and for that reason I really like the imagery of the song."
Coldplay,2v6dyf,Dustygusher,7,Sun Feb 8 08:21:28 2015 UTC,MX for me. I love the simplicity but also the vibrant colours that do show through.
Coldplay,2v6dyf,callumrulz09,4,Sun Feb 8 15:41:14 2015 UTC,Ghost Stories! I use the cover art as my wallpaper both on mobile and the computer.
Coldplay,2v6dyf,cyan_sunshine,5,Sun Feb 8 12:04:38 2015 UTC,I personally like X&Y. It's very minimalist and the cover is just cool.
Coldplay,2v6dyf,polyethylene2,3,Sun Feb 8 14:27:06 2015 UTC,Ghost Stories!
Coldplay,2v6dyf,left_tele,4,Sun Feb 8 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"Although I really don't like the grey cover over the graffiti, I'd say the complete MX graffiti is astonishing."

Coldplay,2v6dyf,AstroTheStickman,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:16:42 2015 UTC,update: this is an awful idea for a wallpaper i lived to regret it
Coldplay,2v6dyf,AstroTheStickman,6,Fri Feb 20 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say Ghost Stories is my favorite album cover, although it is not my favorite Coldplay album."
Coldplay,2v6dyf,CaptainFalconsFist,5,Sun Feb 8 09:57:54 2015 UTC,"Live 2012 for me. I love the colours, the font, and how I can read all the lyrics on it and reminisce about good times I've had listening to Coldplay."
Coldplay,2v6dyf,Spartan1799,5,Sun Feb 8 15:36:04 2015 UTC,A Rush Of Blood To The Head for me. I think it just resonates really well with the album title. http://i.imgur.com/Ec90tDY.jpg. Looks damn good on a poster too!
Coldplay,2v6dyf,randorolian,2,Sun Feb 8 14:48:52 2015 UTC,I like how futuristic Rush of Blood's cover seems. It's very intricate.
Coldplay,2v6dyf,JacksonSX35,2,Sun Feb 8 16:47:11 2015 UTC,Safety and Parachutes
Coldplay,2v6dyf,S4EEDR3ZA,2,Mon Feb 9 15:56:50 2015 UTC,Parachutes. The warm yellow color emanating from the globe just makes me happy.
Coldplay,2v6dyf,Camdenfalcon,2,Thu Feb 19 03:52:19 2015 UTC,"Parachutes and Viva la Vida. I like Parachutes' simplicity. Viva practically tells a story on its album cover, which is why I like it too."
Coldplay,2v6dyf,Gianny0924,2,Sun Feb 8 15:53:37 2015 UTC,I think the covers of Viva La Vida and Prospekt's March both emulate the music and themes of both projects very well. I'm not sure how to explain it.  Mylo Xyloto and Live 2012 are both close seconds. The color intertwined with graffiti and blocky font just seems to radiate joy and emotion.
Coldplay,2v5eia,hexagonz,5,Sun Feb 8 01:38:37 2015 UTC,Live 2012!
Coldplay,2v5eia,duncanmcconchie,5,Sun Feb 8 10:03:10 2015 UTC,Coldplay live 2003. Best live album in history.

Coldplay,2v5eia,cpm619,3,Sun Feb 8 05:35:51 2015 UTC,"Probably my two favourite performances of all time. If you're watching together though, go Live 2012. More intimate and 'film' like"

Coldplay,2v1yfd,DundahMifflin,6,Sat Feb 7 02:41:47 2015 UTC,I Ran Away is one of their best ever. It's a shame it never saw a standard release.
Coldplay,2v1yfd,tobyj3,2,Sat Feb 7 02:52:18 2015 UTC,I agree. I like the contrast between the three tracks. I'm still praying for a B sides EP.
Coldplay,2v1yfd,GeeSpot007,1 point,Sat Feb 7 14:55:44 2015 UTC,The Scientist is by far my favourite Coldplay song ever. The video is amazing too.
Coldplay,2v2lcs,elfin8er,1 point,Sat Feb 7 06:52:06 2015 UTC,"These are my favorite Coldplay songs. Mostly X&Y, Parachutes, B-sides/unreleases, and a touch of Viva and Rush of Blood. Not really going for a specific order or anything. Feel free to let me know what you guys think :) There were a few songs (including a few from Ghost Stories) that I like the most, but they're too sad for me to listen to, so I left them out xD"
Coldplay,2v2lcs,furyasd,1 point,Sat Feb 7 06:53:40 2015 UTC,"I'm listening to this Swallowed In The Sea remix and it's great.  I never like Coldplay remixes, but this one is somewhat nice, it's relaxing instead of fist pumping music.  I like it."
Coldplay,2v1ggg,FJK_12,2,Fri Feb 6 23:51:55 2015 UTC,From a few years back on coldplaying.com in the Viva era. I remember it being confirmed as a genuine Coldplay song and have been listening to it ever since. Oh how I wish one day a version with lyrics would be released!
Coldplay,2v1ggg,arjavrawal,2,Fri Feb 6 23:52:54 2015 UTC,I agree with FJK_12 big time....Alex Jennison and Sander Sokk did an amazing collab adding lyrics to this thing.

Coldplay,2urtau,theskittz,7,Wed Feb 4 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"Good, I'm glad it's not another performance with Rihanna like what was reported originally."
Coldplay,2urtau,cpm619,2,Wed Feb 4 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"In an attempt to avoid using an absolute like ""true"" or ""real"", it's awesome to see when Chris Martin collaborates with a unique and esoteric type of musician. Cat Power, Beck, etc. Beck personally I feel makes some terrific tracks and it's great to see this."
Coldplay,2urtau,IronicCharles,2,Thu Feb 5 05:55:08 2015 UTC,I'm glad he's gonna perform with a real musician like himself rather than a pop idol. they've already played together back in 2002 during KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas Day.
Coldplay,2urtau,S4EEDR3ZA,7,Wed Feb 4 19:18:42 2015 UTC,I mean... I feel you but pop idols are also musicians. I know we like to shit on Rhianna but she's still a musician. Whether or not she's a good one is an opinion.

Coldplay,2ut9g8,TuckerWelch,11,Wed Feb 4 23:48:51 2015 UTC,"""Viva la Vida.""  Besides my wife, my dad is my best friend. I'm a professional musician now and he was when I was a child. We began to bond musically during the ""Viva"" era. When ""Violet Hill"" was released we danced around our house together. When the iHeart stream began we listened obsessively and couldn't believe how much we enjoyed what we were hearing.  We were on vacation on the coast the morning ""Viva"" was released. We woke up early, bought the record, and drove up and down the coast all day listening to it. I'll never forget it; Dad drove a blue Dodge Ram then. ""Viva la Vida"" will always be my favorite record because it will always remind me of my friendship with my dad."

Coldplay,2ut9g8,mitrepl,6,Thu Feb 5 07:37:22 2015 UTC,"Constantly divided between Rush of Blood and Viva La Vida.   I love A Rush of Blood because of its simplicity. It sounds like C,J,G, and W just picked up their instruments and cranked it out. Very bare bones but incredibly complex is how I'd describe it.  But Viva La Vida ties it because of its incredible atmosphere. The composition, the fluidity of the songs, etc. just forms a masterpiece. My favorite album to listen to all the way through.   Meh. I'll choose one day..."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,grossasaurus,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:16:03 2015 UTC,This is exact same conundrum I'm in

The pickup at the end with ASFOS is incredible and is followed by a great closer (O). The bonus tracks are great too with Ghost Story being on my top 10 Coldplay songs."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,left_tele,5,Thu Feb 5 02:01:58 2015 UTC,"Viva La Vida, it's their magnum opus."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,Manonmarz,15,Thu Feb 5 11:10:39 2015 UTC,"Since no one else has said it, I will. Mylo Xyloto. I don't think it's their best album. I'd have to give that to Viva la Vida. But it's my favorite by far. Every song on that album is associated to a great memory in my mind. ""Hurts Like Heaven"" reminds me of the first time I listened to the album and how much that track blew me away immediately. ""Charlie Brown"" reminds me of messing around with my friends on summer nights. ""Us Against the World"" was the song that was playing when the girl I was in love with at the time asked me out. ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"" was my alarm for a long time and got me excited about facing the new day. ""U.F.O."" is a song that my best friend and I associate with each other. I could go through the rest, but I think you get the point. It also contains one of my favorite songs, ""Don't Let it Break Your Heart"", which I think is impossible to listen to without breaking a smile. I think that it's really easy to focus on the bad in life, and that leads me to a lot of problems sometimes, but that album never fails to cheer me up and it reminds me that you can make positive experiences, even if they're small, if you just keep the right attitude. And that's why it will always hold a special place in my heart.  (That was really long... Sorry)"
Coldplay,2ut9g8,PrisonerOfMyWays,4,Thu Feb 5 07:02:56 2015 UTC,"Brb, changing my alarm to Every Teardrop is a Waterfall..."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,TankBearz,2,Thu Feb 5 09:51:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I absolutely love MX. I don't know why many fans are quick to disregard it (maybe because it's really pop-heavy). But Mylo Xyloto is Coldplay's most vibrant album. It highlights the fun in life and just simply tells us to cherish those good moments. Every song on that album is just thrilling. Honestly, whenever I'm done, I listen to MX because it's a brilliant reminder that I have to focus on the positivity that comes by each day."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,DJHazro,13,Sun Feb 8 13:55:27 2015 UTC,I really like A Rush of Blood to the head. For me it was just the sound was raw and new to me. The B-sides of that era also helped secure that album as my favorite.
Coldplay,2ut9g8,DefiantKoala,8,Wed Feb 4 23:51:39 2015 UTC,"X&Y, because it's the most complete album they've made."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,DundahMifflin,7,Thu Feb 5 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"A Rush of Blood to the Head. It's my favorite album of all time. Such a cool tone and atmosphere to the whole thing. 3/4 of the tracks on that album rank among the best Coldplay songs ever, for me, and even the ones that don't still fit the overall feel of the album.    I mean, it opens with Politik and closes with Amsterdam. Just think about that for second. :P"
Coldplay,2ut9g8,Silverflash-x,2,Thu Feb 5 03:24:43 2015 UTC,"Can't pick between A Rush of Blood to the Head, Viva la Vida and Mylo Xyloto."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,Averdian,2,Thu Feb 5 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"A Rush of Blood To The Head, simply because I loved every single song on there. I feel like with some other albums of theirs, there are a couple of songs that don't really make an impression on me. But if I were to make a top 10 list of my favorite Coldplay songs, most of them would be from that album."
Coldplay,2ut9g8,ribald35,3,Sun Feb 8 04:41:27 2015 UTC,Since I haven't seen Viva La Vida (or death...) I'll go ahead and say why it's one of their best.   Viva has the best production in my opinion. The balance of sound and string incorporation are amazing! Every single song feels unique to me (42 being one of my all time favorites). The album themes appeal to me because it's not just about love love love. We got to see the first politically charged Coldplay song! (Violet hill). The sound direction that the band went in during 2008 was so perfect. All of their albums are fantastic but Viva should be remembered as one of the strongest album packages.
Coldplay,2ut9g8,Anoblylegend,2,Thu Feb 5 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"It really depends on my mood. I love them all, but since Ghost Stories came out that's the one I've been playing the most. Although sometimes I just put my coldplay playlist on shuffle."

Coldplay,2ut9g8,ChamixMicah,1 point,Thu Feb 5 02:19:42 2015 UTC,A Rush of Blood to the Head. My favorite album of all time. I just love each song and the flow of the album. It's the album that made me fall in love with Coldplay.

Coldplay,2uhr2v,Jademalo,5,Mon Feb 2 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"This song is literally my holy grail, I've been searching for years.  This song was originally on a demo tape, that is fairly common knowledge among fans, along with Brothers and Sisters.  I'm terrible for quality, and so far I know of two versions of this that exist. The tape that was bought and dumped by Corriopatcat on Coldplaying, a CD that was ripped by Battmath. I have both of these in FLAC.  The Corrio version is in stereo, but has a huge amount of tape degredation in terms of quality. The Battmath version is much better in terms of quality, but is only in Mono. Also, while the Battmath version seemed to be a CD, it was a really bad recording of a tape to a CD, which you can tell by the volume increase at the start.  According to various sources, there is apparently a master CD of this out there somewhere, but it's never surfaced. I've been on years occasionally asking around, and I've still yet to find it.  So if anyone has the original CD of this and Brothers and Sisters, please rip it to WAV or FLAC so I can complete my collection ;_;  Thanks!"

Coldplay,2tyvns,Ayrgente,18,Wed Jan 28 16:42:47 2015 UTC,A lot of professional musicians don't read sheet music and play by ear.
Coldplay,2tyvns,th9109,4,Wed Jan 28 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yep. Many largely praised artists can't read sheet music, which I find very neat."
Coldplay,2tyvns,DundahMifflin,4,Wed Jan 28 17:33:12 2015 UTC,Unless you're in the classical or jazz world it's not very needed at this point in music history; especially when you're the one writing the music.
Coldplay,2tyvns,th9109,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about this? I'm taking piano lessons, and I'm tired of learning sheet music.  I can actually memorize very easily chords, and if I knew chords on the piano, I could play by ear, as my music teacher said that there are people who can't identify a note when played, and people who can have a better advantage in music.  And guess what? I can do it!"
Coldplay,2tyvns,furyasd,1 point,Sat Jan 31 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"I'm very sure; I'm a classically trained pianist who plays non classical music professionally and for a living. Never once in my career have I been given sheet music to learn a song, maybe a lead sheet or chord chart at times but for 99% of the time I'm expected to chart the songs myself and learn by ear.  BUT in NO way am I suggesting that you should quit lessons. Even if you have a proficiency to read by ear, the techniques and disciplines that you learn by training with a teacher and reading sheet music are invaluable and will be the catalyst that launches you ahead of every other ""by-ear"" player.  What I do recommend is buying the sheet music to ""ARoBTTH"" (ironic, I know) and learn the entire record by identifying the chords and playing it through a combination of reading and by ear. You should do this in addition to your lessons, not in place of them.  Stick with it! Pianists are too rare these days. Good luck!"
Coldplay,2tyvns,th9109,1 point,Sat Jan 31 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"I have all the sheet music for every of their albums, except Mylo Xyloto and Ghost Stories, would like to find those somewhere.  I want to learn Amsterdam, Everything's Not Lost, X&Y and Lost so bad, but I need to learn the chords somehow, I just have no idea where I can study chords actually."
Coldplay,2tyvns,furyasd,1 point,Sat Jan 31 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"This is where your lessons come in. To fully grasp the concept behind chords, not just knowing the names and playing simple triads, you need to tell your teacher that you'd like to focus more on music theory. Learn the circle of fifths, learn how and why different chords interact with each other in western music, and learn different chord inversions and cadences. All of these concepts will help to give you the background that not only allows you to ""play chords"" more easily but to understand the whys and hows of contemporary music."
Coldplay,2tyvns,th9109,7,Sat Jan 31 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that after playing the piano/guitar for +10 years he could easily learn how to play a song by ear, knowing the chords and strings to each song."
Coldplay,2tyvns,nasfari,5,Wed Jan 28 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Most musicians use their ears actually. I personally learn songs by ear, it's easier Imo. Though I have a lot of respect for anyone who can read sheet music flawlessly."
Coldplay,2tyvns,Swaqprophet,3,Wed Jan 28 20:16:15 2015 UTC,"...even if he did read sheet music it's not like bands write out and publish all of their songs on sheet music. Most can't read it anyway. I play trumpet in a cover band and we've learned over 6 hours of music, all of which by ear. It's not very difficult if you're musically competent."
Coldplay,2tyvns,milesahead89,2,Wed Jan 28 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he learns piano and guitar parts by ear, but with guitar you can easily get the tabs online, for which you don't need to know sheet music."
Coldplay,2tyvns,uttamo,2,Wed Jan 28 23:43:29 2015 UTC,"Most definitely by ear. Using trial and error (plus a lot of replays on YouTube), I've been able to figure out a lot of songs and pieces myself, and he's been playing probably 3 or 4 times longer than I have."

Coldplay,2ty9ks,johnnnyy10,3,Wed Jan 28 10:49:03 2015 UTC,I think this is probably Coldplay's most emotionally powerful track to this day. The lyrics are heartbreaking yet so beautiful - the way he sings the line maybe one day I can fly with you just sounds so sad.

Coldplay,2tr5zh,randorolian,2,Mon Jan 26 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"In no particular order:   Sparks - One of the most calming songs Coldplay's written. It's super relaxing, and the bass is beautiful. Fly On / O - Gorgeous piano, great buildup with the instruments layering on top of each other one after another, and possibly the truest and greatest lyrics Chris has written. The live version is especially fantastic. Fix You - Not much that can be said about this one that isn't obvious. It's basically perfect, and singing this together in an arena full of people is like no other experience on earth. Life in Technicolor ii - Just a very energetic song, it's got a great presence in that sense. Very unique sound. Also, one of my favorite music videos of all time, so that's pretty great as well. True Love - Heartbreaking lyrics. They kill me, and I love them. The guitar solo is also one of Jonny's best ever, and that's what really seals the deal on this song. Mylo Xyloto / Hurts Like Heaven - Fantastic album opener that sets the fun, colorful mood of Mylo as a whole really well. The guitar that closes the song is extremely beautiful. 'Til Kingdom Come - Fantastic lyrics. Coldplay plus acoustic guitar always leads to greatness. Politik - I absolutely adore how tense this song is. From the second it starts, it's dark, uneasy, and has a very eerie nature to the sounds. Then, the release towards the end, in the ""love over this"" section, is such a beautiful contrast to the rest of the song. It's a perfect piece. Sleeping Sun - A fairly more recent discovery for me, and maybe an odd choice, but this song is just catchy as all hell. It's has a very different sound, and the heavy breathing at the end is a really cool, intense effect. Twisted Logic - Some of the most unusual lyrics Coldplay's written, but extremely interesting and well done. The song tells a great story (how I hear it, at least) that reminds me a bit of Muse's stuff. It also has possibly my favorite ending of any Coldplay song, such a powerful way to close out X&Y, and it's so unusual and cool to end with such a bang, rather than a soft sort of fade-out."

Coldplay,2tr5zh,flumpy_pumpy,2,Mon Jan 26 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"Violet Hill Another arms - truly some deep sounds throughout the song, love it with great headphones.  Always in my head - when this album first released I was going through a breakup with my longing girlfriend, I started the new album up and listened in order and when this song played I almost cried it was so moving for me Midnight - the high point of the song towards the end also sounds amazing with good speakers.  Square One - I love everything about this song all the way to the end.  Warning sign - I especially love the ending to this as the song slows and he repeats the same line over quieter and quieter.  Lost!/Lost!+/Lost? No love lost for all the Losts, the beat just gets me so pumped up when I listen to it, and The piano version in Lost? Just calms my nerves.  Crest of waves - that chorus, chills every time.  A sky full of stars - I loved this contrast to the rest of the songs with the amazing upbeat song before the final calm piano track and it really does want me to jump around like Chris Martin.  Every other Coldplay song! - okay this is a cop out but as I made this list I realized more and more that every Coldplay song has some meaning big or small to me and I truly do love all of then in their own special way, I can't limit it to 10 and I don't want to make a top 121 Coldplay songs, that would be a lot of work."

So instead, these songs are usually bundled with singles. This came from records having ""A-Sides"" which were the song people paid money for, and the other ""B-Side"" on the opposite side which was an extra song by the same artist for the listener."
Coldplay,2tj3v4,TooManyWoodChucks,7,Sat Jan 24 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"Essentially refers to the ""other side of a pop single."" Clearly was used with records instead of MP3s, but the term is still prevalent today. Coldplay would release singles like ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,"" ""Shiver,"" and ""Speed of Sound."" On the actual CD releases of the singles they would include songs like ""Moving to Mars,"" ""For You,"" and ""Things I don't understand."""
Coldplay,2tj3v4,Hencley,5,Sat Jan 24 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"Old term. Vinyl records would have sides ""A"" and ""B"" labelled when you flip them. They would reserve the B-side for their smaller releases, or bonus tracks.  List of B-sides"
Coldplay,2tj3v4,Manny-Pearce,4,Sat Jan 24 21:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Top side and bottom side of a record. You'd play the top side. When it was done you'd remove the record, flip it around and play the bottom side. Old time singles records--and even some cassettes in the '80s--would put the main song on the top ""a"" side and that other song, rare song or live cut on the bottom ""b"" side.(Cassettes would just be ejected, turned around, inserted and played)."

On another note, I've set a goal for myself to remix a song from every Coldplay album, ending with a remix of Yellow.

The hardcore fans think Coldplay should win best actor and best song and best stubble on a man's chin, but the rest of the world wasn't as big on that one."
Coldplay,2sloed,clwestbr,5,Sat Jan 17 00:39:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair, what was I supposed to say?   ""Coldplay didn't get a nomination, thank god!""  This being the Coldplay subreddit, I don't think it's too criminal to be optimistic for the band to win (or at least be nominated ) for their first Oscar.  I can agree that the song isn't anything too special, but that doesn't mean that I can't be disappointed that the band missed out on the nomination."
Coldplay,2sloed,clwestbr,2,Sat Jan 17 01:36:55 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, you admit it isn't the greatest sing. Why would it get an Oscar nomination when even fans think it's 'meh'?"
Coldplay,2sloed,clwestbr,2,Sat Jan 17 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, I don't think it's ""meh"", I think it's an average Coldplay song that I enjoy listening to, and could see getting some recognition (with that said I also completely understand why it also wouldn't get recognition).   However, that is just my opinion, and I'm sure there are other fans besides you who also find it to be meh, and likewise who enjoy it as I do-- so I completely understand where you are coming from.  I do feel like it could have at least been nominated however (if anything for the chance to see them perform it live at the ceremony). That is again, just my own humble opinion"
Coldplay,2sloed,ASFOS,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:13:43 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, I just can't agree that it could have been nominated. The academy doesn't care about live performances or any of that, it is going for the strongest of all nominees and this song just want strong to anyone but the most hardcore of Coldplay fans."
Coldplay,2sloed,clwestbr,4,Sat Jan 17 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"I think its more because the Oscars wanted to completely snub the film. Out of the nominations for song, Miracles was probably the best, but Unbroken was hated by critics even though its actually a quality film. They labelled it Oscar bait, which is a bit of disrespect to the guy that the film's about, because it is in fact about his life."
Coldplay,2sloed,Dougmartin22,5,Fri Jan 16 22:34:27 2015 UTC,I thought the film needed work. The story focused on drudgery but the parts where he remains 'unbroken' are reduced to cards at the end. It's a wonky script.

But, to be more specific to your answer OP, the part where the lead guitar starts soaring.  Nearly every song that makes me emotional does it through lyrics (I'm a huge sucker for Billy Joel's Lullabye. Fucking cry every time). This song, though... oh goodness this song.  Roughly 2 years ago I was driving from university to home, depressed (literally suicidal) as shit. Thought about driving my car off the road. It was early in the morning, sun still rising. Played this song from my iPod. I swear the sun rose above from behind the treeline just as the crescendo hit. No words could make me cry like I did at that moment, just that amazing wave of sound and emotion. Tearing up now just thinking about it again. Whoever composed that part of the song could safely say they saved a life. One of the most magical things to happen to me, honestly. I never really 100% appreciated that song (it's always been my favorite, though) until that moment happened to me."

Coldplay,2siyhp,nath_leigh,3,Thu Jan 15 23:42:36 2015 UTC,"Okay so obviously pretty much everything everyone has mentioned is spot on. Fix you, Cemeteries, Amsterdam...etc. Yes.  But my single favorite moment in Coldplay's music is at 2:58 in Clocks on the Live 2012 album. Already the song has just that extra oomph of volume and bigness. But this addition, where they take any resolution they just made at the end of the last phrase gets exploded into a million pieces right here. They take tension, and they tighten, and tighten, and make you beg for it to end to get to the release, but secretly you want them to make it still be tense.  And then they release it and all is well with the world. And you may or may not have to go get new pants.  That said, the beginning of Paradise up to 0:35 is phenomenal too, from Live 2012. So yeah. I have a few favorites."

Coldplay,2rwqpr,Jewboypennylover,6,Fri Jan 9 23:20:28 2015 UTC,B-sides are fair game for me if this is the case. But I can't see them putting out a B-side featuring one of the most well known artists on it...sadly...
Coldplay,2rwqpr,IronicCharles,9,Sat Jan 10 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not totally sure this will end up on the record. It's been confirmed from a while ago the Rihanna tracks as a standalone thing. This entire article was written very weird, so I'd take this with a grain of salt."
Coldplay,2rwqpr,DundahMifflin,23,Sat Jan 10 03:41:08 2015 UTC,I must be the only person in the world that doesn't think this is horrible. Would Princess of China have been better with only Chris singing? Sure. But Rihanna did a fine job and the song is still pretty good.
Coldplay,2rwqpr,Silverflash-x,10,Fri Jan 9 23:55:50 2015 UTC,Chris likes Rihanna. And collaborating with her doesn't mean they won't collaborate with anyone else.    I guess I just don't share your concerns.
Coldplay,2rwqpr,Silverflash-x,2,Sat Jan 10 00:13:58 2015 UTC,Chris said that when he was writing PoC he had Rihanna in mind. Why should he go with another singer when he wants Rihanna to do it?

Coldplay,2rwqpr,IronicCharles,0,Sat Jan 10 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"Two opinions: This annoys me because Rihanna is clearly the most opposite choice for a Coldplay song. Just look at the Cat Power collaboration... that was incredible, and if anything, could have just used more Chris singing. A voice like that worked well with their music. As popular as Coldplay is, let's face it, they're not making true pop or whatever that kind of music would be considered. Second opinion goes along with this sort of... Anyone they get is not as good as a pure Coldplay song. In the case of Princess of China, the song was dominated by Rihanna. It would have been awesome if her ""featured"" role was simply the chants or whatever throughout the song and in the beginning; she did well for that. But my God people, let Chris Martin sing his songs."

Also, No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground from their very first EP Safety that eventually became the B-side to Yellow.   Are you only including original songs? If the only requirement is studio recording, you forgot both Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas (from the 2001 EP Mince Spies) as well as 2000 Miles, a cover of a song by The Pretenders that appeared on a 2003 Best Buy Christmas compilation album.    I'm cheating for this last one (had to check Wikipedia), but they also released a How You See The World No. 2 that appeared on another benefit album."

Coldplay,2rj2c1,Sky-Pala,1 point,Tue Jan 6 21:24:22 2015 UTC,Didn't really know how a song could be 'British sounding' but then I remembered this!
Coldplay,2rj2c1,Algorhythmical,8,Tue Jan 6 23:31:57 2015 UTC,I'd say Shiver or Green Eyes takes the cake.
Coldplay,2rj2c1,mission17,4,Tue Jan 6 18:02:45 2015 UTC,The Hardest Part
Coldplay,2rj2c1,Swaqprophet,2,Tue Jan 6 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"This is a really hard one for me to answer because, at least for me personally, Coldplay kind of defines what music coming from the UK sounds like. Kind of like asking which one of these apples taste the most like they came from an apple tree... I'm really interested in what other people say, though!"

Coldplay,2rj2c1,nationpower,1 point,Sat Jan 10 04:47:21 2015 UTC,I would partially agree on that
Coldplay,2rgvn0,tswaves,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:11:01 2015 UTC,Awesome man! Keep it up
Coldplay,2rd22x,chazzeromus,7,Mon Jan 5 03:02:13 2015 UTC,"This guy is awesome he really is an actual fan.  That video in the article of him dancing to Lovers in Japan then getting mad at his friend for ""disrespecting"" the band was hysterical and reminded me of myself whenever one of my friends disrespects Coldplay haha."
Coldplay,2rd22x,ebarnes12,2,Mon Jan 5 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"And sometimes he moves like Chris.  Well, it seems now I'm not the only one who does this. My girlfriend also tells me I've picked up almost every way of moving from Chris Martin.  FUCK YEAH! GETTING CRAZY!  And the quote, it's seriously something I would say if someone had done that to me."
Coldplay,2rd22x,furyasd,3,Mon Jan 5 07:12:22 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to Coldplay since I was 2 and in 2nd grade I'd ask a lot of my friends and teachers ""Do you like coldplay?"" And I'd get a reply of ""who's that?"" But now they're really well known. Love those guys"
Coldplay,2rd22x,Pm_me_your_ladyhumps,10,Mon Jan 5 03:53:52 2015 UTC,...you were 2 when you were in 2nd grade?
Coldplay,2rd22x,InforMedic,7,Mon Jan 5 06:06:18 2015 UTC,He claims that due to this amicable relationship he has a standing offer from North Korean officials to visit their country.   Don't do it bro.
Coldplay,2rd22x,furyasd,6,Mon Jan 5 07:11:05 2015 UTC,"Dushku has attended, by his own count, nearly 60 Coldplay concerts  YOU SON OF A ...."
Coldplay,2rd22x,Ayrgente,4,Mon Jan 5 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"I actually saw him at the concert I went to back in 2012. I remember Chris pointing him out in the crowd, like he actually remembered him! He's a cool guy, from what I've seen. :)"
Coldplay,2rd22x,laceyyy,2,Mon Jan 5 23:40:46 2015 UTC,Was it Chicago? That was supposed to be my last stop on the MX tour. Chris was nice enough to bend off the stage to shake my hand right before VLV. Hopefully I'll see you at another show sometime.
Coldplay,2rd22x,jimmydushku,1 point,Sun Jan 11 02:40:13 2015 UTC,Yeah! You had that light up shirt too! Such a fun night. Maybe we'll run into each other at the next tour in Chicago!
Coldplay,2rd22x,laceyyy,2,Sun Jan 11 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Haha ya! The shirt was originally supposed to sync up with the Xylobands, but we ran into some last minute trouble rigging it together. Definitely send me a message next time they're in Chicago. I'll be there."
Coldplay,2rd22x,jimmydushku,1 point,Mon Jan 12 02:33:41 2015 UTC,"That is freaking awesome! Those xylobands were amazing, I cannot believe you could even sync them up! I will totally send you a message next tour, maybe we'll run into each other again! :)"
Coldplay,2rd22x,laceyyy,3,Thu Jan 15 16:10:28 2015 UTC,Y'all know he posts here. Lol.
Coldplay,2rd22x,Silverflash-x,3,Mon Jan 5 09:08:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen his posts often. He's a cool guy from what I can tell."
Coldplay,2rd22x,DundahMifflin,3,Mon Jan 5 10:30:43 2015 UTC,what's his username?
Coldplay,2rd22x,Dustygusher,1 point,Tue Jan 6 00:04:56 2015 UTC,This is my username.
Coldplay,2rd22x,jimmydushku,2,Sun Jan 11 02:41:02 2015 UTC,Hello! :) Just wanna let you know you are so awesome! haha
Coldplay,2rd22x,Dustygusher,2,Sun Jan 11 07:51:04 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Coldplay,2rd22x,jimmydushku,2,Mon Jan 12 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but that is absolutely hilarious."
Coldplay,2rd22x,InforMedic,2,Mon Jan 5 06:06:35 2015 UTC,I find it hilarious! That guys is awesome he seems to have a really happy life!
Coldplay,2rd22x,Gre3nArr0w,2,Mon Jan 5 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, looks like I'm a fan of this fan!"
Coldplay,2rd22x,jimmydushku,1 point,Tue Jan 6 00:50:59 2015 UTC,Thank you. And I'm a fan of yours.
Coldplay,2rdgw6,thefutureofhollywood,8,Mon Jan 5 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"CAN WE PLEASE GET A GHOST FOR NEXT WEEK  A very beautiful song, and so many don't know about it."
Coldplay,2rdgw6,furyasd,3,Mon Jan 5 07:36:16 2015 UTC,"The earliest we got is four weeks! We ""queue"" up some of the songs in case anything happens. We'll get that in for sure."
Coldplay,2rdgw6,johnwickham,5,Tue Jan 6 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"It's happening!  Redditors can also submit their own brief descriptions of a rare song they would like to write about. We already have a few songs chosen, but let us know if there is any B-Sides or Rarities you are dying to explain to the world."
Coldplay,2rdgw6,ExplosionTaco,3,Mon Jan 5 05:26:10 2015 UTC,I love this idea. Please do The Goldrush soon.
Coldplay,2rdgw6,Dustygusher,2,Mon Jan 5 18:46:30 2015 UTC,LET'S GO BOYS!
Coldplay,2rdgw6,Qorinthian,2,Mon Jan 5 06:10:37 2015 UTC,I notice a few of Coldplay's songs reference feet off the ground or touching the ground or etc.
Coldplay,2rdgw6,Silverflash-x,5,Mon Jan 5 07:01:22 2015 UTC,I feel maybe whenever they do that its a homage to this song
Coldplay,2rdgw6,routefire,1 point,Mon Jan 5 15:58:28 2015 UTC,O that is awesome!
Coldplay,2rdgw6,The_Prospektor,2,Mon Jan 5 23:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Most people think it's a metaphor for taking off and shooting off into musical stardom. Later in the Viva eras, they sing about not touching the ground and just ""floating.""  Flying is a very evocative image."
Coldplay,2rdgw6,Karenleafry,2,Tue Jan 6 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"Nice, this is a really good idea."
Coldplay,2rdgw6,misterlittlebear,1 point,Mon Jan 5 09:08:50 2015 UTC,"I Bloom Blaum  This is one of Simon Pegg's favourite Coldplay songs. Not many people will like the first half, but in the second half it becomes a truly awesome song."
Coldplay,2rd83y,prco1994,9,Mon Jan 5 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"I also went on a long search a few years ago. Basically the company that makes it is a small design company in LA (I forget the name completely its been so long), they had similar but not exact jackets and they were the wrong colors, they were also $600+ because they were customer fancy designer stuff.   However after researching I was able to create a similar jacket, I posted it here a year or so ago. Here it is: http://imgur.com/a/YaGVp  Military jacket was the name of the style I went with in the end but a lot of different styles kind of fit the bill."
Coldplay,2rd83y,Amizats,1 point,Mon Jan 5 13:07:19 2015 UTC,Rag and Bone is the name you're looking for. They made the jackets.
Coldplay,2rd83y,jimmydushku,6,Sun Jan 11 02:48:27 2015 UTC,Here is one I created myself! Didn't take longer than a couple of hours.
Coldplay,2rd83y,Pyxa,4,Mon Jan 5 14:27:43 2015 UTC,Isn't that the VLV jacket?
Coldplay,2rd83y,misterlittlebear,3,Mon Jan 5 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, COMPLETELY read the title wrong"
Coldplay,2rd83y,Pyxa,3,Mon Jan 5 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Completely different style, but I really prefer the look of the 2008-2010 era look to the MX+ stuff. Although, the simplistic, yet stylish look of the Ghost Stories stuff looks really nice as well."
Coldplay,2rd83y,A9821,3,Mon Jan 5 17:02:15 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot guys! Just knowing the name of the style of jacket helps a lot!
Coldplay,2rd83y,jonesey46,2,Mon Jan 5 14:04:17 2015 UTC,"I've found similar ones, that specific style of jacket is called a 'worker jacket/blazer' (Google that and you should find something) and from there you can fabric dye, spray paint and do all sorts of things to it in order to replicate Chris'. Hope this helps :)"
