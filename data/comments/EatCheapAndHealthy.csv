I'm a big fan, and I've tried all the flavors now (jalapeño is my favorite, apple chardonnay is a close runner up).   There are countless ways to prepare it. It can basically act as the meat in just about any meal, and it's important to remember that they are already very salty and full of flavor. This means you should minimize the seasoning you add.   A few ways I've used them:  Dice them up and throw them into scrambled eggs/omelette. This is incredibly easy and you don't really need to add anything to make it delicious.   Cut it open lengthwise for a ""butterfly"" effect, then eat it whole on a bun. Trader Joe's also sells a pretzel bun that is perfect for this. Grill some onions and bell peppers, then top it off with spicy brown mustard. Mmmm.   Cut them into smaller cubes and fry them with veggies and rice. This has made some of the best fried rice I've ever eaten. Try adding chunks of pineapple to the mix. Or get creative and let me know what you discover works."

Roasted potato recipe  Cut up 1-2 lbs of red potatoes (qualifies as cheap, right?) into quarters, sixths, or eighths as you prefer and also depending on potato size.  Drizzle with olive oil or just veggie oil if you like, then toss with salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste. 'Steak & chop' seasoning works great too.  Cook in the oven for 40 minutes at about 350-400 F, turning potatoes after 20 minutes. I find the cooking temperature to be flexible and can change if I'm trying to cook something else at the same time that requires a more precise temperature. Use a metal pan to get the potato sides nicely browned.  Edit: make sure to put the cut sides of the potato pieces onto the pan, this is what makes them brown."

I recommend mushrooms, carrots, zucchini.  If it will go with the spices you chose to use, then you are golden.  3) carbs - rice, quinoa, even noodles (I prefer over thin noodles like vermicelli)  all change up the texture, making a distinction between similar meals you've had recently.  This means I can usually get away with a stir-fry once a week. Especially if I do something like spicy beef & broccoli over quinoa followed by lemony chicken on rice  or garlic chicken on noodles.  If you serve the carbs separate from the veggies & meat, then you can have more veggies, while your SO can load up on the carbs. Good luck!  editted for formatting"

Often I take the same amount of food I give him and split it in half -- half for dinner and half for lunch the next day.  Another option is to make something like fajitas and serve his on tortillas and yours on greens. Or pasta where his is all noodles and yours is half noodles, half veggies.

If you have a Wegmans nearby the marinated tomatoes they suggest are amazing but regular ingredients would be fine. I sprayed one side of the naan with olive oil and then put the ingredients on the other. Put them on the grill on med-low and cooked for just a few minutes until melted and the crust was browned. Careful not to burn. One was enough for me, bf ate two.  Turkey Meatloaf  I make my mom's recipe for meatloaf but use turkey. Again, I don't have a recipe but I can estimate:   1lb ground turkey 1 egg 1/2 cup diced white onion 1/2 cup ketchup Italian breadcrumbs (1 cup+) Seasoning: salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, italian seasoning   Essentially I mix it all the wet ingredients and turkey together first, season and then start adding breadcrumbs until the consistency feels moist but not sticky. I usually use my hands for this. Then I break it into two halves, round them into football-ish shapes, put them on a pan with tin foil, brush on a little more ketchup and into a 375 oven for 20ish minutes until cooked through.

I like to marinate my meats with soy sauce, water, tsp of brown sugar and a drop of sesame oil... if you're feeling more adventurous, some 5 spice powder will add to the flavor. This type of marinade can be used on chicken, pork and beef. Adjust the portions to your own taste. I've substituted honey for the sugar before too, it gives a nice glaze when grilling (use low heat, otherwise the sugars will burn).  Cook your meats and veggies separately. If you marinate the meats, but only steam/boil the veggies with no seasoning, you can have different flavored dishes without much work.  Also, stir-fry/saute is a very easy way to whip up dishes."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3e3mje,pesh527,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Salmon risotto. The fish makes it seem a bit fancy but you only use about 3/4 of the amount you would normally put in a portion.  Finely chop a bunch of spring onions and dice a small pepper. Fry them on a low heat in a splash of oil and a teaspoon of butter.  Add 150g of Arborio rice and stir in. Make up a mug of veg stock and add a couple of table spoons.   Slice about 6-8 mushrooms and add them to the rice. Stir the risotto frequently, adding another tablespoon or two of stock when the rice starts sticking to the pan.  After about 5-10 more minutes slice about 200-220g of salmon into inch cubes and stir them into the risotto. Keep adding a bit of stock when the rice sticks to the pan. When the stock is gone just add warm water.  The salmon is meant to break up into little flakes so don't worry about being gentle when stirring. If you have them or can get them cheaply add dill and parsely.  Keep stirring and adding stock/water until the salmon and rice is cooked. Adding a bit of liquid at a time should make the risotto nice and creamy. Just as its done you can add 1/4-1/3 of a cup of frozen peas. They only take a couple of minutes to cook, then its done. If you want to splash out a bit you could also add some prawns at the same time as the peas but it depends on your budget and likes."

These go well with a lot of different dishes, so their versatility wins my vote. I also add garlic powder to just about any savory dish to really ""round out"" the flavor.  Also, do you have fridge access? If so, and depending on what you plan to make, you should check out Better than Bouillon. It's concentrated broth in a small (8oz?) jar. It's really nice because you can make only as much as you need at a time. I often find that buying a carton of stock results in me refrigerating the leftover stock and tossing it when it goes bad, but with the concentrated broth, I don't have to worry about leftovers spoiling in the back of the fridge. They have quite a few different meat/non-meat flavors, so you can easily find something that you can use in multiple dishes.   Sorry, I know that wasn't really quite related, but I kind of consider the stuff to be along the lines of a spice too. If you get a chance, you should definitely give the stuff a try!"

I think in this case you would toast them?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3e0zuv,ImOkayAtStuff,3,Tue Jul 21 14:22:41 2015 UTC,"Bit of both.   In dry curries, like okra, the cumin is whole and is sauted at the start along with the mustard seeds.  In main dishes like rasam (lentil broth/soup), the cumin is powdered.   Since I have a massive batch of rasam powder (which is a blend of many spices - something like Garam Masala), the cumin I handle in the kitchen is 'whole'. Once every 2-3 months I blend up a batch of the stuff I need.  Honestly, the list of spices I mentioned above don't even come close to the absolute must needs for my pantry. South Indian cooking (and Indian cooking in general) relies a lot on blends of spices and seasonings.  White pepper, star anise, aniseed, cinammon, cardamom, cloves, mace... man the list goes on.   I cannot survive without those in my kitchen."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3e0zuv,SweetLordKrishna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:33 2015 UTC,"haha, I hear you.  whittling a list down to 5 is def a challenge.  my list would probably be: whole mustard, whole cumin, cayenne, garam masala, kitchen king.  I learned to start a dish by sauteing cumin and mustard seeds through indian cooking, and now I love to start dishes this way regardless or the style of cooking.  i'm not indian spice savvy enough to make my own blend, so having a couple of very different spice blends works.  Then cayenne allows you to make any dish as spicy as you want."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3e0zuv,ImOkayAtStuff,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"I genuinely think making your own blend is very difficult. It's far too many variables, combinations and balances. I strictly follow, what is now nearly, a 120 year recipe because I am not that adventurous.   It's also crazy in the sense that my mother hates blending at home. She is stronly of the opinion that 'professional' blenders in South India (who seemingly use very primitive blending machines) produce the best blends. No matter how expensive a blender/grinder I have bought for my mother to make sure she can do it at home, she still sends the age old recipe to the same blender in Chennai, India.   On the flip side, I have recently fallen in love with Cayenne. It's not something we get in India, so my mother now grows them in our garden. REALLY nice with chocolate based recipes."

Some sort of chili is a must have for me: chili powder, peri peri powder or chili flakes.    Get a ""spicy"" spice to change up the flavour profiles a bit:  Paprika, curry or turmeric.   Get a ""sweet"" spice as well. Cinamon is the best, because it goes surprisingly great with things like tomato based sauces and butternut soup.

For the other four, I'd choose garlic powder, curry, some grill seasoning like Montreal mix or Chicken & Poultry mix, and cinnamon sugar.  Garlic powder is great if fresh or jarred garlic isn't available (if they are, almost always go with those instead though). Curry is great because unless you use too much it has a very subtle flavor and gives your metabolism a kickstart no matter what you put it on. The grill seasoning is self explanatory, it's a thicker seasoning than my other suggestions, and the cinnamon sugar is for sweeter things.  Also as a side note, you might find it awesome and really useful to have a little windowsill herb garden. Have a few little trays or pots in the window of your room with staples like parsley, basil, mint, oregano, and cilantro. I've had an herb garden at home that I plan to try and restart in college on my windowsill and outside my apartment. It's both therapeutic and provides a great source of flavor for anything you make and once you buy the plants it costs nothing at all!"

That's even better because freezing can affect taste and texture, plus freezing then microwaving containers over and over again tends to break them down really quick. Anything over at /r/MealPrepSunday as /u/gingerlaur recommended is usually fine in the fridge for a week. Lots of jar-based recipes (a cute trend that's popped up lately) such as overnight oatmeal or jar salads also keep for a long while, since the jars are airtight and help preserve food.  If you're dead-set on freezing stuff, keep in mind that pretty much anything is freezable. The only items that seriously lose their texture or flavour in freezing are produce items that are soft or watery (bananas and avocado, or grapes, berries, lettuce, onion, tomato, peppers, etc. etc.) and soft cheeses and creams (which you don't want to microwave anyway). All meats freeze pretty well, hard cheeses do okay, rice does well, and good veggies to freeze include beans, corn, peas, broccoli, carrots, brussels sprouts, lentils (good for curries), etc."

Please show me a study from within the last 10 years that ""proves"" that sodium in any amount is dangerous for you if you're otherwise healthy.  4: Cheese? So... not only carbs are bad, but fat is bad as well?  So, basically, they should just eat a slab of tofu or 90% lean ground beef and not eat anything else.  Is this diet food? No. It's a dish with a decent amount of protein that you can have your sides of veggies for a decent meal."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3e0d1v,blacknumberone,5,Tue Jul 21 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"I never said those things were terrible for you. Especially when you break them down and consider them separately like you have. I was only agreeing with  /u/beer_swap that this dish is not the most nutritious when you consider some of the ingredients it lists. It is also not healthy simply because it has tomatoes, onions, and tofu.    I'm referring to added sugar (corn syrup), not natural sugars.  OP specifically stated that he/she was trying to stay away from carbs - ""I try not to do too much bread, pasta, or rice at dinner."" Why would they want to stay away from carbs? Because carbs turn into sugar (especially bleached white flour pasta) which causes people to gain weight. I'm not saying to never eat carbs. Too much sodium, just like anything (salt, sugar, etc.) is not good for you. Processed foods such as condensed soup and store-bought taco seasoning have high sodium contents.  Cheese is great. I love cheese. Fat is great. Fat is good for you in moderation. I never said it wasn't healthy to have fat in your diet. But combined with pasta, excess salt, and sugar - no, it's not healthy.    It's kind of like arguing that ketchup is healthy because it has tomatoes in it. You have to consider the other ingredients you are adding to the ones that are actually good for you."

I just fail to see what adding a can of condensed tomato soup adds to this, and truthfully it sounds a bit gross.  Cutting out the weird tomato soup and just using a no salt added can of tomato sauce thinned with a bit of water, or just cooking out the can of diced tomatoes and adding fresh tomatoes instead would help.  Also, making your own taco seasoning is very easy, it regulates the amount of salt/additives (even gluten for celiacs), and it keeps forever.  Corn flour tortillas can be seasoned and baked to provide a healthier and tastier alternative to an over salted bag of tostitos, and finally, I don't see how anybody can pretend that dish with pasta and a 1/4lb of processed cheese is healthy or nutritious."

You can find good recipes for baked tofu (I usually dredge it in cornstarch and bake it).  Bulk stores are your best bet for TVP and wheat gluten--Bob's Red Mill carries both in most grocery stores but they're more expensive there. Tofu can also be expensive in regular grocery stores. I can get it fresh, three blocks for a dollar, at a local Asian food store.  For ideas and recipes, I often use Vegan Dad's blog.

I'm trying to reduce meat for my health, but my BF often doesn't feel full if a vegetarian dinner isn't super hearty and heavy. Finding a middle ground has been a fun trip.  Not totally meatless but I make a black bean soup that's pretty great. You just use a bit of bacon in a huuuuuge pot of food. My recipe is very close to this one. His recipe calls for 10 pieces of bacon for 8 servings of the soup. I make mine with less bacon per serving than that, and it still tastes very bacon-y imo. Also, it keeps well for packed lunches, and it's super filling.  For salads things like beans, eggs, or cheese, roasted red peppers or mushrooms can all make a salad into something filling enough for an entree. Also ingredients like that are so flavorful you won't have to drown it in dressing just to taste anything.  Roasted or grilled portobello mushrooms are great, but are a little expensive to make them the star of the meal (they're not a lot of food for the price. When I get them I often marinate them and then grill the way I would with a burger.  You might want to look into frittatas and quiches, both are basically dinner omelettes. Both are also good no matter what you throw in them, so are great for clearing leftover veggies out of the fridge.  Any time you're doing Mexican food you can substitute more beans for meat, and you can use less rice in favor of sauteed onions and peppers. Take it easy on cheese if you're being healthy but a little bit goes a long way.   And my old fall back is to look up Indian food when I run out of ideas. There are a lot of dishes that are just vegetables in spicy sauce. With Indian food you'll see a lot of lentils, cauliflower, spinach, chickpeas, and sometimes sauces made with yogurt. Many are traditionally served with rice, but it's your dinner so you can do what you like."

Here's a simple one. Take a red/yellow pepper, cut it in half, remove seeds and pith. Sprinkle with seasoning salt (be sure it has actual salt in it). Cook rice on the side, I usually use wild rice or near east rice pilaf. Stuff the half pepper with the rice and then top with mozarella cheese, queso fresco also works. Place on a hot grill for about 10 minutes. Don't worry if the skin burns, peel it off and the inside will be super sweet. I do this with a side of black beans sometimes. Do not forget to salt your beans enough. You may also find that chicken thighs are relatively cheap and grill nicely if you are careful not to catch the skin on fire.

Bean tacos.   Sloppy joes..beans, bun, you know it. Maybe carby but filling.   Stir fry. Add tofu if you don't mind it but I make it without. You can sprout your own mung beans.

She cooked squash and zucchini in some olive oil, then added some rinsed black beans to it. We ate it wrapped in a tortilla with some freshly made guac. We added a little shredded cheese but if you don't eat any animal products you could easily leave that out. I've also done something similar with roasted broccoli, bell pepper, and mushrooms without the black beans the more garlic added the better in my opinion. I'm from Texas basically anything and everything can be eaten from a tortilla."

Reheated veg - roasted bell peppers, onion, squash, potatoes, sweet potatoes, celery, tomatoes, green beans, brussel sprouts. What helped me was looking up what produce is currently in season, looking up recipes with 5 ingredients or less, and going to the grocery store with a meal plan.

If you've got two hands free while you walk, you can also make overnight ""oatmeal"" in a jar. Super easy to eat with a spoon and you can just close the jar and chuck it in your bag afterwards. I keep jars from whenever I buy jam or pasta sauce. You can make it in batches of 2-3, ahead of time.  I find the ""oatmeal"" to be more...yoghurt with stuff mixed in. But you can play with oatmeal-to-yoghurt ratios. Regardless, it's super filling and an okay source of protein. You can start with the base recipe or look up specific fancy ones.  Plain base: rolled oats with equal parts plain yoghurt and milk added. Shake it all up and refrigerate overnight. To this you can add berries, mashed bananas, various nut butters, flavourings/spices (cinnamon, lemon zest, cocoa powder, etc), seeds/nuts, pudding mixes, protein powder, etc. etc. etc.  Two specific recipes I like:  Apple: Oats (1/4 cup) + yoghurt (1/2 cup) + unsweetened applesauce (1/4 cup) + cinnamon/""apple pie spice"" + honey.  Peanut butter cup: Oats (1/2 cup) + yoghurt (1/4 cup) + milk (1/3 cup) + peanut butter (2-3 tbsp) + cocoa powder (~1 tbsp) + vanilla extract, sweetener to taste, dash of salt.

I actually made it with 2 peaches this week instead of the apples, and it only made 3 servings instead of 5.  So I think the apples have a lot to do with it.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dxgyz,neurorgasm,2,Tue Jul 21 04:20:40 2015 UTC,My local Wal-Mart carries this brand of Chia Seeds.  Honestly I don't see as much benefit from a heavy sprinkle of the seeds as I do a class of Metamucil but that said the seed are a cheap and easy way to add fiber without impacting the flavor of the food.  I do agree they are a bit of a fad but they don't seem to have any negative impact on me.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dxgyz,b4xt3r,4,Tue Jul 21 00:26:29 2015 UTC,The chia seeds might help with the texture a bit? I know you can make a chia seed pudding over a couple hours so I always assumed that was part of it. But not sure.

I leave a box of cereal and a box of oatmeal at my desk and a box of almond milk in the fridge. I just added a bag of chia seeds to my desk drawer to add to my oatmeal.    Snacks: I also used to leave a block of good cheese at work (and a knife).  I'd get some grapes at some point during the week and eat some cheese and grapes in the afternoon.  I felt very civilized.   I have natural peanut butter in the fridge which I eat with apples, put into oatmeal or can use for lunch in a pinch.   I go to trader joe's regularly and pick up some healthy(ish) snacks like nuts, baked peas, whatever i see and keep them in my desk for afternoon snacks.   Lunch:  I like a good salad for lunch (no heating required).  You can find lots of recipes for mason jar salads online, if you are ok with prepping ahead of time.    I so invested in a bento box, which made me eat better at work (I think).  When I make a healthy meal for dinner, leftovers go into the bottom (this works if you have a microwave or don't mind room temp food).  Once the bottom is filled, I have to use the top because the strap won't fit without it, so I cram the top with snacks such as those listed above so they are all convenient!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dxgyz,Blackeye30,4,Mon Jul 20 17:24:58 2015 UTC,Just the tip: Try peeling them the night before and soaking in soy-sauce/fish-sauce/water over night. It changes the texture (more meaty) and makes them delicious.  Also - A steamer basket instead of full boil makes perfect eggs. I like 7 minute eggs.

Basically it's scrambled eggs, add in cheese and whatever else you want (I typically add green peppers, onions, bacon, etc.), and bake it for about 15 minutes.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dxgyz,squidzilla,3,Mon Jul 20 12:10:25 2015 UTC,"My husband and I have a green smoothie everyday for breakfast, and I think I have made it as grab and go friendly as possible by freezing daily portions. This makes it a lot more affordable as bulk produce is usually a lot more affordable and I don't have to go to the store every couple of days, just once every week for the bananas. Then I dump that in the blender along with the banana (easy peasy, peel and drop) and the liquid of choice and blend! It helps that I have the ninja blender which blends frozen foods like it ain't no thang.   For reference my green smoothie recipe for two people is 2 cups of greens, 2 cups of diced fruit, and a good sized chunk of ginger, and 2 cups of liquid. This results in two ~16 oz green smoothies. I try to buy different types of greens and fruits every time I make a new batch to keep things fresh and to expose myself to a variety of nutrients etc. If I'm feeling fancy I might soak chia seeds overnight, or add turmeric, cinnamon or other spices in but even on it's own the veggies and fruit do a pretty good job of filling us up and getting some more nutrients in us!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dxgyz,DrZealousDankinstein,3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:30 2015 UTC,could you enplane to me how this works? I am a little confused on what the process for this is
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dxgyz,ManCaveDaily,2,Tue Jul 21 00:41:53 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! You boil a gallon of milk in a stockpot on medium heat (or to just before boiling since it tends to surge upward. Meantime, have another stockpot in a sink full of cold water. Stir intermittently.   While it's boiling, plug in a crockpot on high to get it hot. Get out 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the yogurt you want to replicate.   Okay, milk ready? Pour it into the pot in the sink. You've just killed any bacteria you don't want. Now you have some pure milk ready for colonization but first it has to cool down (hence the cold water). Draw a cup or so out of the batch. Let both the cup and the pot cool. The cup will obviously cool first, and when it gets to the point where you can stick your finger in there without burning it, it's time to add your yogurt.   Stir the yogurt into the cup. Gently mix. When the pot in the sink reaches the same finger-safe temperature, add it to the crockpot. Then add the cup of yogurt/milk. Unplug the crockpot and wrap it in a towel to keep warm.   Eight to eighteen hours later, you'll have a gallon of delicious yogurt. If you want it thick, Greek-style, you can strain it in the colander. It's pretty darn nice as is, but I like to separate it because A) whey is really good for those lifting gainz and B) Yay, greek yogurt!  For whatever reason, this isn't really effective with ultra-pasteurized milk, so try it with normally pasteurized if you can be sure."

Then toss in the flax, PB2 and protein powder, then the banana, then fill with whatever milk you're using till you reach the desired volume (32 oz total is what I shoot for).  This ends up giving you a very hearty and thick smoothie that definitely counts as a full meal.  Add more oatmeal if you find yourself hungry before lunch (I'll do as much as 3/4 cup).  You can prep/mix the dry and frozen ingredients beforehand so it literally takes seconds to whip up.  *Frozen Banana Tip: Peeling frozen bananas is maybe the worst thing ever.

Coat some chicken in the yogurt marinade and let sit in fridge for around 30-60 minutes Lightly spray a non stick pan and with med-medhigh heat cook through. I like mine when it caramelizes lots.  Store in fridge    You can chop the chicken before marinading or after cooking. This is great with salads and in wraps and adds lots of flavor. Use a good regular Greek or natural yogurt the little bit of fat in them helps with the cooking.  You could also do this with lamb and beef and just use flavors that go well with those meats

So for me sometimes I'll be lacking in veggies (or over indulging in calories cause I'm a soda fiend) and need some fiber + vitamins and lo-cal... So for lunch I'll literally just take a can of greens, spinach, whatever and eat that. Fresh veggies are an option too if I have the time. I keep shakers of salt and pepper around for some taste.

You can also use them as a substitute for rice or mix them in with rice.  They feature a lot in Indian food as daals. A basic daal starts of by frying diced onion and crushed garlic. Spices are then added such as cumin, tumeric, chilli and ground coriander. You can experiment with different ratios and add other spices such as ginger. Then add lentils and water and simmer until the lentils are soft. You can also add veggies such as slices spinach or tomatoes.  Daals are traditionally served as a side dish in Indian. But there's no reason why you couldn't have a daal with the extra veg with some meat as a lunch or main meal, especially if you were trying to lower carbs and increase fibre."

I agree that you'll want variety, and there are different kinds of lentils to try out and having pasta and rice and things are also good, but I would suggest trying couscous, it's in the same sort of family as pasta and such, is much much quicker to make and is something a bit different, people don't seem to eat couscous that much. Also, I don't know where you're from, but in Lidl (and I presume other supermarkets although I've only seen them in Lidl) you can get couscous in boxes rather than bags, so that stacks nicely and neatly in a corner of a cupboard, better than bags of pasta and lentils and potatoes."

A package of tortillas is maybe $2 per 10.  If I cut each tortilla into 8ths, that is 80 chips.  A bag of nachos is like $2.50 and I feel as though you would get way more than 80 chips in the bag.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dytdv,xaxen8,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"You are probably thinking of flour tortillas. Corn tortillas are usually sold in the international food isle at Walmart in large quantities for about 3 bucks. A little drizzle of oil on them, a toasting in the oven, a light salting, and then make chalupas.  I would recommend getting a food processor if you are that into salsa. It will save you money. A large can of tomatoes, 2-3 onions, a little garlic, some cilantro, and a couple tasty/spicey peppers will cost you six bucks tops. This will make enough salsa for at least near a week. I eat it just as much as you do(I think). Pico de gallo is a good thing to make until you get a processor.  What are you putting on nachos to make them so unhealthy or are you eating a whole bag of chips a day? If you aren't eating other fats then that might not be really bad.  You can definitely find corn tortillas in bulk at ethnic groceries, but they might near as cheap as Walmart. Look out for brands with freaky preservatives."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dzs2g,momTacocatmom,3,Mon Jul 20 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"I would make a fried rice. Chop up any veggies or proteins you want to go into it. If they're raw, sauté them a bit first so they soften. Then add some chopped onion, garlic and ginger, and sauté until soft. Add any pre-cooked veg or meat you have. Then add the rice, crumbling it up as you add it. Toss it around and cook until it's hot. You can add an egg or two if you want. To season, I usually like a bit of soy, maybe some oyster sauce, a little dash of sugar (that will help take away some of the sourness from the lime), some hot sauce or Sriracha."

I've also tried cutting up sausage, browning in the oven, then making a bread+sausage+cheese sandwhich. Add vegetables - Lettuce is extremely cheap and at the end of the week I make a salad. I've also added tomatoes before. Celery is a good side snack as well Change the mustard (spicy or even horseradish mustard) or change the cheese  Make your own bread - Obviously not for everyone, but I've been experimenting with baking bread lately which is different from store bought bread.    This combined with eating leftovers every once in a while means lunch is never boring for me. Hope this helps"

My store didn't have wheat fettucine, so I had to settle with linguine, but I'm ok with that.  This meal is delicious and super easy to make.    Prep time - 10 mins  Cook time - 15 mins  Total time - 25 mins  Total Cost: $6.52  Cost Per Serving: $1.09  Serves: 6  Ingredients   4 cups vegetable broth $0.52 2 Tbsp olive oil $0.32 12 oz. fettuccine $1.33 8 oz. frozen chopped spinach $0.79 1 (28 oz.) can diced tomatoes $1.73 1 medium onion $0.43 4 cloves garlic $0.32 ½ Tbsp dried basil $0.07 ½ Tbsp dried oregano $0.07 ¼ tsp red pepper flakes $0.02 freshly cracked pepper to taste $0.05 2 oz. feta cheese $0.87   Instructions   Add four cups of vegetable broth to a large pot. Break the fettuccine in half to make stirring easier later, and then add it to the pot. Also add the canned tomatoes (undrained), olive oil, frozen spinach, onion (thinly sliced), garlic (thinly sliced), basil, oregano, red pepper, and some freshly cracked black pepper. Make sure the ingredients are submerged under the liquid, place a lid on top of the pot, and then turn the heat on to high. Allow the pot to come up to a full, rolling boil over high heat then remove the lid and turn the heat down to medium. Allow the pot to continue to boil over medium heat, without a lid, for 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir the pot every few minutes as it cooks to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom, but avoid over stirring which can cause the pasta to become sticky and mushy. The pot must be boiling the entire time. After the pasta is cooked, crumble the feta cheese over top and serve."

Sprinkle with salt and your favorite spice mix.  I like lemon pepper, dill, and smoked paprika. Into the rice, put 1/2 cup of your current favorite veggie, fresh or frozen (rinse in cold water first if frozen).  I like peas, corn, broccoli, or carrots, but anything you can steam or boil is fine. 1 cup white rice  1 1/4 cup liquid (half water, half stock)   The fish flavor will season the rice too. Heads up, this method can stain your steamer basket, but it won't actually hurt anything.  Black beans and corn quinoa - frequently used as a side with burritos or short ribs - just add everything to the bottom, no steamer basket needed:   1 can low sodium black beans, drained and rinsed (or 3/4 a cup dried),  1 cup frozen corn,  1/2 cup quinoa - make sure you rinse the quinoa first!! Even if it says pre-rinsed,  1 cup liquid (I use chicken or veggie stock).  1/2 tsp cumin,  1/2 tsp oregano, onion and garlic powder to taste (I use about 1/4 tsp each) salt to taste (I add it after it's cooked)   Replace beans with peas and cumin with herbs de province for a hearty side dish for most simply seared proteins."

On the weekend we can make a full pot of rice as part of dinner, then make packets with the rice we did not eat. This comes in handy for weeknight meals - if I don't get home until 7:00pm, I can thrown together a super-quick rice bowl with an egg, saute some kale/cabbage/baby spinach,  and a little avocado if I have it. We also use them for quick batches of fried rice. My daughter likes to use rice packets as an after-school snack along with any leftovers we might have!   Check out the rest of the Just Bento website. There are a TON of great recipes and ideas there! The owner hasn't updated much lately due to illness, but it appears this might be changing soon. Some of my favorites are the miso tahini nut paste for roasted veggies, sesame carrot salad, and turkey soboro. She also has a few recipes that are made in a rice cooker!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3du3qq,viperex,2,Mon Jul 20 04:58:05 2015 UTC,I do the frozen packets of a 1:1 mix of rice and lentils(requires a bit more water than normal rice) with chicken bouillon. Makes a great base to mix with various meats and veggies for easy cooking and provides protein in addition to the rice's carbs.  I call them L Rations

EatCheapAndHealthy,3du3qq,airbrat,4,Mon Jul 20 06:08:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. Make sure the packet is still wrapped well, but don't unwrap it. If you suspect it has a hole or was just wrapped poorly, go ahead and rewrap it. Place it seam down on a plate and put that in the microwave.  I portion ~one cup rice packets, and 2 minutes on high seems to be the perfect amount of time. The wrap bubbles up pretty large, but rarely pops.  The final texture is DARN close to freshly steamed rice, perhaps just a little chewier."

Making the Sushi Rice    Place 2 cups of sushi (short-grained) rice into rice cooker along with 2 cups of water; cook like normal rice Stir in 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar (I think I normally put a little more than this. I basically keep adding it until I can taste the vinegar on the rice but watch out for over flavoring!)

Now, prep your favorite veggies (or use a frozen ""asian"" blend) and a protein if you're using it, we generally thinly slice a chicken breast.   Heat your skillet, add a bit of oil, add protein, and cook through. Set it aside in a clean dish and cook your veggies in the same skillet. Once the veggies get nice and al denté add your protein back in and throw your two cups of day-old white rice in and stir to both heat the rice and keep it from sticking to the pan. Lastly, pour on your sauce and mix to coat the rice.   Serve.   If you'd like to add egg, do so just as the veggies are getting done and stir vigorously to scramble."

I started up on this after learning it cooks significantly quicker than rice (15mins-ish). It's flavorful and delicious hot, or can be cooled and used as a healthy salad base.  Here's my standard go-to recipe that you can tailor to your own tastes:   Two parts water  or chicken stock for more flavor (bouillon crumbled can work in a pinch) One part quinoa Some diced garlic (two cloves for a big batch) Black pepper Any other flavors you want (diced onion, oregano, peppers, etc) Put on 'white rice' option, or just start it and check in about 13-15 minutes into it."

Often the non stick bowl in the cooker has a very thin coating on it and it can very easily scratch or erode.   I've cooked chicken in it before (and it was heavenly) but it definitely affected the coating on the bowl. Rice cookers heat up very slowly, so if you like the texture that food has from rice cookers then invest in a slow cooker. They are around the same price as a rice cooker. /r/slowcooking has great recipes. Of course a pressure cooker is even better. Cooks rice and things like a slow cooker but fast!"

Pop it all in the blender and process until it's smooth, then cook 1/2C for each pancake on low to medium heat. These burn easily so be careful. Each pancake (with the protein powder) is 159 calories, 4g fat, 17g carbs and 13g protein. This makes 4.   I added 1/4C blueberries to the batter while it cooked, and it was awesome."

Dinner - these meals will have a lot of sodium, that will be your biggest issue. Again, try and find low sodium versions of these. Also, you might want to look for recipes in this sub for dinner that are composed of beans. Beans are cheap (black beans, kidney beans, NOT baked beans) and have a lot of protein. I don't know where you live but you might want to check out local farmers markets too. You can get some really good deals.   Your original meals will not help you lose weight in a healthy manner. It's not just about the calories, like I mentioned that sodium level you'll consume is very high. You'll probably hit a plateau at some point.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3duw30,LanceWackerle,2,Mon Jul 20 07:15:16 2015 UTC,"This isn't true. In Asia people tend to eat high carbohydrate, low fat and low protein diets. Also extremely low in animal products and virtually no dairy.   In Southeast Asia, people eat a lot of fruit too. It's not sugar or carbs from rice that makes people fat. It's animal protein and fat. Eating half portions of rice might help you lose weight only because of the calorie cut but is not necessarily a healthy way to lose weight."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3duw30,LanceWackerle,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"It's not true that Asians are just skinny ""in spite of the rice"" because they exercise a lot. You said they're skinny because of low sugar intake (many do not have low sugar intake as they eat lots of tropical fruit) and many don't necessarily have high exercise, not everyone's a farmer anymore.   The macronutrient ratio of high carb, lower fat is why Asians are thinner naturally than the high fat, high protein diets of the west. So you could argue it is the rice."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3duw30,KingJonathan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:51:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm well I'm less familiar with South East Asia; fruits are more of a treat in East Asia. But fruits are among the best of sugars since the high fiber content tends to be filling.  In terms of high exercise, I'm speaking relatively here; compared to the average U.S. lifestyle there is a lot more walking around to take the subway, taking the stairs, etc. so I'm not just referring to farming. Most Japanese people I know who live for a while in the U.S. lose several kg upon returning to Japan and complain of sore muscles for a few days just from returning from the car lifestyle back to the subway lifestyle.   The macronutrient ratio of high carb, lower fat is why Asians are thinner naturally than the high fat, high protein diets of the west. So you could argue it is the rice.   Do you have evidence for this? It goes against recent recommendations by the Swedish government which recommends high fat low carb for fastest weight loss.  http://www.docsopinion.com/2013/09/23/low-carb-diet-best-for-obesity/"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3duw30,Gingerstop,7,Mon Jul 20 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"Noodles probably work out more expensive on a calorie to price basis than if you were to buy a great big bag of rice - check Chinese supermarkets and stuff for it. Rice is quite calorie dense. I use My Fitness Pal to lose weight and whenever I have rice, I need to go easy on my other meals if I want to have a decent sized portion of rice. I get 500 calories easy from rice alone from the portions I eat. Same with beans. There's a reason why the stereotypical ""poor person"" meal is rice and beans. They're reeeeeeally cheap to buy in bulk. But they're also both very easy to make vaguely interesting with clever use of spices, sauces, stock, etc. I would always vote for them over noodles.   Make sure you get veggies in there somewhere. You say a healthy school meal, so I'm going to assume there's veg in there somewhere. Try to find cheap frozen veg and stuff like that. Or when you're having soup, make it as packed with veg as you can get. Eat as much veg as you can and as many different kinds as you can to try and keep your nutrition reasonable. Veg also fills you up which can help you stave off hunger.  To lose weight, you need to eat less calories than you burn by doing your daily activities. So based on what you've said there, you will probably be in a calorie deficit and so probably lose weight - but the sodium values in things like noodles will probably cause you retain a lot of water weight so you might see the scales stop moving completely for a while. Nutritionally speaking, that sort of diet you've mentioned in your OP isn't good for you. Certainly, from a financial point of view, it 'works' because it'll be dirt cheap, but long term, you're gonna end up feeling pretty bad. It's the kind of thing I've done when it was a week until payday and I had very little money to get by on, but I wouldn't maintain it for very long. You will struggle to maintain it though, just a word of warning.   The bare minimum recommended for women is 1200, for men it's about 1500. Obviously the actual amounts vary with height, weight, age, etc. Try and make sure you're at least hitting that minimum with whatever you end up eating. Below that and, at best, you're going to struggle to feel full, at worst, you could end up ill."

Have a quarter/third of it by itself the first meal and then pick/shred the rest it to your noodles and soup, that's two.  You can stretch it further of course by making potions smaller, just remember to store it properly.  (I'm into being cautious and I don't save leftovers past three days, ever.  But I don't freeze stuff either, which helps keep it.)  Edit: I mention buying a precooked chicken only for convenience.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3duw30,ItTakesTwoToVoyeur,2,Mon Jul 20 05:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm also struggling with finances and switching between ramen or rice for my dinner. I use lots of frozen veggies (and occasionally fresh, if I find a good deal or a friend gives me something from their garden) with my noodles or rice.   One whole mushroom, sliced, and some frozen peas, green beans, broccoli or a veggie mix and I'm good. Sometimes I'll cook an egg in the water while the ramen is cooking for some protein as well.  I use less than half of a seasoning packet (and ditch about half the water, too, once cooked) because I don't like a ton of broth.  Rice I just cook with the frozen veggies in it. I have been portioning out filets of frozen fish I got at Costco (just used up the hake, now using salmon - who said budget eating has to be boring?) and cooking to eat with the rice. I think the package has 10 individually-sealed filets in it, and I've been using 1/3 a fillet with dinner (or 1/2 if I'm hungry), so it lasts me a while.  As others have said - oatmeal is better than cornflakes. There are so many ways to tweak oatmeal to make it more exciting. I like a good splash of milk and a spoonful of brown sugar usually, or I've baked them into bars with a recipe I found on Pinterest. There are some amazing ideas on Pinterest that may just involve a little peanut butter, honey, berries, spices, fruit or something else you might like.  Soup is good, but I'd worry about the sodium content if it's canned instead of homemade... you could make a big pot of soup and portion it to freeze... if you find a good deal on a whole chicken or something, why not splurge, if it will last you a long time?"

On the rare occasion I've had to be more exact in my measurements, if it's water, as another person pointed out 100ml = 100g, and I worked out what 100ml of the milk I use weighs. 1 American cup being ~240ml makes it harder for me to put the solid ingredient into what I use to measure volume and estimate how much I'm actually using.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3du9t0,ONymeros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"It is not. We use ounces to mean two different things. The measurement for a cup that is designed for flour or dry ingredients is slightly different from that of cup designed for liquids. For liquid measurement the cup is a perfect 8ounces, a pint is 16oz, quart is 32oz, etc, and you can use the conversion ratio figure out that exactly in milliliters.  US liquid ounces to milliliters.  For dry ingredients the cup is a volumetric measurement. It should be by weight but most people don't have a food scale at home. You can find lists on the internet for dry goods and then convert them from ounces to grams. For example, flour is 4oz, salt is 9oz, sugar is 7oz.  Don't feel bad because I guarantee you most Americans have no clue about the difference between a 'measuring cup' for liquids and a 'cup' for dry measurement either. They will use one or the other interchangeably to their baking frustration.  http://www.thekitchn.com/weight-conversions-for-flour-sugar-and-other-common-baking-ingredients-171316"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3du9t0,yeetboy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:55 2015 UTC,"TIL. I had no idea they were different, I just assumed it was the design of the cup itself - ie. liquid measuring cup has a spout, solid measuring cup has a flat top so you can run a knife or other flat surface over the top to make it even. Being Canadian I don't ever actually use oz., I just use the volumes on them. Is it actually volumetrically different??"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3du9t0,ONymeros,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yes volumetrically different.  If it has graduations on it and a spout then its likely to be accurate. If it doesn't then all bets are off. Depends on the Chinese Injection Molding machine, or whatever made it but I guarantee you whoever designed it probably didn't spent too much time doing the volumetric calculus to determine that it was the same volume as a liquid measurement cup.    A dry weight cup is rough estimate really, and they differ from cup to cup.  Flour can be affected by humidity. Flour can have different weights per cup just on the amount of water vapor its absorbed/evaporated already and that affects baking times. So an experience baker knows he needs to keep certain variable like room humidity constant, always buy from the same distributor, etc, everything to keep your ingredients consistent so that when you go to use your cup, you get consistent results."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3du9t0,Shiro_Sora,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"I've been actually working on a web app which will try to solve this problem for us living in metric amd weight dominated part of the world :) It's still in early development but you're welcome to try it out: http://work.opacelica.si/recipemangler  You can try pasting or entering a list of ingredients (e.g. 1 cup of brown sugar) and when you switch between US and metric it should automatically calculate the weight for you.  It's different than all the other converters out there because it tries to extract amounts and ingredients from plain text which means you can most of the time literally just copy&paste the whole ingredient list from the recipe and have it converted for you in a second (no more hunting and pecking from dropdowns for individual ingredients).   If you do decide to try it, I'd be happy to hear any feedback :)"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3du9t0,ONymeros,2,Sun Jul 19 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I gave it a try and I've got a couple of points of feedback.  First of all, the use of decilitre is odd. It's not a term I come across all that often so I had to google it to check I understood it correctly. I think it would be prudent to return results in ml until you hit 1000ml, then provide it as litres to avoid that bit of confusion.  Secondly, the recipe I tried it with asked for 1 cup of white rice, which converted to 2.37 decilitres of white rice, rather than the equivalent weight of white rice, which brings me back to the same scenario as when it's in ""cups"", because it's weird (for me) to measure the volume of something that's not liquid.  Other than those, I think the principle of it is really useful! So if you iron out any little bumps like that, it'd be really good to have. Perhaps it'd be useful as a phone app as well for when we can't have the laptop floating around in the kitchen when we're trying a new recipe?"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3du9t0,fontophilic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for checking it out and even more for your feedback!  You are right on point, dcl is actually a quite a rare measurement unit for most countries, so I've removed it and now it's directly from ml to litres.  As for the weight calculations I actually need to add densities (weight per volume) for every single ingredient I have in my db and while that's still a work in progress for many ingredients, I have somehow missed white rice, which I've added just now :) If you miss any more, just let me know and I can add them (better to prioritize those ingredients which people actually use). I've also tried to include more esoteric measurements and quantify them to something more familiar for beginners, such as: splash, dash, stick, half-stick, double-stick (for butter), quart, fifth, pint etc should all convert quite nicely into g and ml.  The webapp right now is kind of responsive so it should be at least usable on phone screens too (still work in progress) but I've been also toying with the idea of a dedicated app in the future."

Greek yogurt can also be fancied up to become dill sauce for salmon. There are tons of recipes for it, and although I've never found one that tastes as good as the mayo + sour cream based version I grew up with, I've had some that were fine in their own right.    You can stir Greek yogurt into tomato soups to make them a little creamier. I sometimes don't stir and enjoy the contrast between hot and cold.    Avocado in egg salad works, but I've never tried Greek yogurt there. If you were making some kind of southwest egg salad with chives, cumin, chili powder, onion, etc. I think it would be good, but I think egg + yogurt would be too bland."

Your initial comment compared milk's sugar content. Just because milk is a main component, doesn't mean it will dictate the nutrition.  Looking at the variation in sugar count across multiple brands with the same serving size suggests that they do indeed add sugar. I took the lowest (6) as the baseline."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dtps4,communitychest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:13 2015 UTC,Lactose sugar still exists in the yogurt though. You aren't getting rid of the sugar. Greek yogurt has less sugar than regular yogurt because they strain out much of the whey. Yogurt will vary its sugar content depending on the amount of whey still present in the yogurt. Whey contains much of the lactose sugar. Less whey = less sugar
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dtps4,Athilda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"I just looked it up on the Oikos website, and the only ingredient is milk, and it has 6g sugar. In other brands there might be variation due to how much is actually in the serving (some brands have 5oz of yogurt in a serving, others have less or more). Plain Greek yogurt does not have added sugar in any brand I have seen. Also, sweetened Greek yogurt in a potato or egg salad would be pretty gross."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ds09q,roogug,21,Mon Jul 20 22:27:49 2015 UTC,"To me, the secret for cooking for one on a budget is making stuff that you can easily remix leftovers into something totally new. It's depressing to make a meal and then eat that exact meal for lunch and dinner for four meals. Here's two examples of the kind of thing I would do:  Meal 1 - four portions plain ingredients. EG: Roast a chicken (or buy a rotisserie chicken--seriously, it's frequently the same price to buy one already cooked, or even cheaper). Bake 4 potatoes. Steam a chopped head of broccoli (squeeze some lemon juice on it--yum). Eat one chicken breast, some broccoli, and one potato with topping of choice.  Meal 2: Cook some onions, garlic, celery and carrot in a little oil in a soup pot, along with a little sage and thyme. Chop up the cooked potato, broccoli, and chicken and add along with some broth. Eat a yummy bowl of soup. Freeze the leftovers in two individual portions and eat at some later point.  (Bonus round: use the trimmings onions, carrots, celery and the chicken carcass and make your own broth!)  Meal 1: Fish fillets cooked in parchment with zucchini and cherry tomatoes, and rice on the side.  Meal 2: Chop up the leftover fish and vegetables. Reheat the rice. Fill a tortilla with the hot rice, cold fish and veg, and a little cheese. (For me I would add salsa but I like spicy food.)  Easy ways to remix plain ingredients: make soup, make tacos/burritos, fill an omelet, make fried rice, make a casserole, make pasta sauce, make salads."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ds09q,beargrowlz,9,Mon Jul 20 14:02:58 2015 UTC,"First off, don't worry. For the sake of comparison, I used to spend around $100/month on groceries and did just fine.  Recipes aren't your best way of saving money. Bulk cooking isn't the best way. The best way is to get in the habit of buying opportunistically. Get in on the sales at the cheap grocery store. Buy what's on sale, because you need it, and don't waste your money on the more expensive brand of anything unless you know from personal experience that the cheaper one is bad. Most things are priced differently because they're trying to optimize the market price and not because the quality is any different. In many cases the exact same product is sold at different prices just so there will be a cheap, expensive, and a ""medium"" choice.. which serves to set the price at the level the manufacturer really wants.  Some bulk cooking is good - pot roasts can last a while. A shoulder of pork, turned into carnitas, can last a while. Dry pasta keeps for a long time, and so do most of the sauces that go on it. They'll be cheap and tasty.  Don't forget to treat yourself a little, too. Peace of mind is worth more than you can imagine. Get two tubs of the ice cream you like if it's 2-for-1. Use the flexibility you have from good buying habits to give yourself the little spirit-lifters.  If you buy smart, you won't have to skimp. They should be two entirely different things."

Get some fresh salad leaves, some of your favourite raw veggies, chop them all together, drizzle some olive oil or dressing over them and you're done! Here's a great salad infographic, to give you some inspiration.  Otherwise check out BudgetBytes, BBC Good Food, and start a Pinterest board of easy meals."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ds09q,theserpentsmiles,4,Mon Jul 20 14:10:26 2015 UTC,It'll be fun! On Sundays I get good music and a few beers. Then I think of what I want to eat through the week. I'm a vegetarian so I cook beans and such in my pressure cooker. And I do some quick prep for veggies and save them in separate Tupperware. I work between 60 to 90 hour weeks so when I get home at night I pair up an already prepared grain with already prepped veggies. The forethought really helps! Dinner for the night and lunch for the next day done! For meat just defrost the night before and use that instead of grains.

As for not knowing many spices, that's totally fine. I would reccomend buying premixed flavors that you enjoy.  For me, that's lemon pepper, garlic salt, chili pepper, cajun seasoning, etc. You can get good flavors without having to worry about ratios and whatnot.   do you have any meat preferences?"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ds09q,PeggyOlson225,3,Mon Jul 20 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"$100/week is a lot of money for groceries. I easily subsist on about half of that (oftentimes even less).  The best advice I can offer as a bachelor whose cooking experiences are often two steps forward, one step backward is to stick to cooking things you like to eat.   Some ideas to get your brainstorming started would be:  *chicken. There are a million different ways to marinade chicken. Just figure out what you like and try different things.  *veggies are insanely cheap.  Dice up some veggies, throw in a pan with some olive oil and spices and it makes for a great side. Better yet, add some meat and toss into pasta for a full meal.  I second the comments about buying in bulk. Rice is very cheap and very easy to cook. Canned beans as well.  If you have a slow cooker, /r/slowcooking has a lot of great recipes for things you can make in large batches. Then, while you have four meals worth of food cooking in the Crock Pot, you can do the rest of your meal prep and ""double up"" on the efficiency.  TL;DR: Cook what you like to eat. Buy in bulk when possible. Use a crock pot."

For lots of food you need a lot of space.   Me and my gf tried the Costco thing and only went three times and it didn't work. We'd get 1 thing of chicken or ground turkey that was no more cheap than 4 individual packs at Kroger but took up quadruple the space due to bulk pack/storage instead of finding room to store 4 1 pound packages.   If you have an external freezer? Rock it. If you don't, don't bother. A fridge freezer won't cut it."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ds09q,lpkitten,2,Sun Jul 19 02:25:56 2015 UTC,I would advise googling different cheap/easy cooking blogs or checking out chefs like Donna Hay or Jamie Oliver that are known for their simple style. Go through their recipe indexes and save all the ones you like to either Pinterest or Evernote (or something like that). That way you have your own little personalised recipe collection you can easily flick through on all your devices :)  (Edit: I also recommend making more than one serving - Freeze the rest for easy meals throughout the week)
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ds09q,plasticslug,3,Sun Jul 19 02:50:44 2015 UTC,"Hey a $100 budget a week isn't too bad for groceries by yourself. Anyway here are my few tips that I have learned from cooking at home as shitty chef too (Never cooked once in my life until 2 years ago when I moved out with my SO).   Meal plan every week and stick to it! Seriously write out what you plan on making for lunch and dinner for five to the seven days a week. Your grocery list should be the needed ingredients for the meals and stick to it! It's hard and sometimes you'll give in and eat out which is OK, but try to stick to the meal plan. Also make sure to stick to the grocery list when at the grocery store. Make sure you are NOT hungry when going too because next thing you know you have junk food piling up in your cart. This is also really hard, especially on us inexperienced cookers, but try to buy whole produce (meaning real vegetables and fruit and rice and blah blah blah). Not the boxed or frozen processed food. It takes time but trust me you'll feel better about yourself when you actually prepare the food and it's usually cheaper because those boxed meals are only good for one meal where cooking your food can also be next night's dinner or lunch.  Get a crockpot. It's awesome for cooking up big meals that can be the next nights few dinners or lunches.  Look up recipes EVERYWHERE. Reddit, youtube, pinterest, wherever, and do it for free. You really shouldn't have to buy a recipe book. Also make sure to organize your favorite recipes because next thing you know, you have a collection of recipes that fill half of cook book.  I actually don't recommend getting the costco membership. If it's only going to be you it might not be worth it (even with the second person, maybe get a third). A costco membership is good for family sized amount of people. And if it's only going to be the two of you it really won't be worth it. I use to buy food at costco and we could never finish it before it went bad. It's actually really great for non-perishables, and if it is in your budget then go for it. If not then don't.  Also back to grocery shopping; something I do is write out a list of what I am buying, sticking to it, and writing down the prices at the store. And seeing if its worth buying it. Sometimes I will find something that better price or sometimes one of the ingredients to the meal is just not in the budget. Also I don't get sticker shocked at check out (which would happen a lot). The whole process slows you down and keeps you from making spontaneous purchases, or better yet, you get to find that you have some room for luxury.    Sorry if this post is so long. It took me so long to figure this out (budgeting and cooking) and I just hope that maybe a little of my wisdom can help somebody."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ds09q,winchesterzombie,2,Sun Jul 19 12:08:16 2015 UTC,"one of the easiest things you can do is to cook a bunch of chicken in the crockpot, shred it, and use it for a few days.  easy quesadillas (put torilla in oiled pan until it has air bubbles, flip, add shredded cheese, chicken, salsa, whatever, and close it up when the cheese melts), put it on salads (I like bbq chicken salads with black beans in the salad and 1:1 or so ranch dressing and bbq sauce for dressing), mixed with bbq sauce on a bun, etc"

Its also back to school season, so you could pick one up from walmart on sale if you want to buy new. This would help you tremendously with costs.  If not, you can cook a lot of stuff in the microwave. Rice, beans, canned low sodium veggies, potatoes, bananas, apples, bread/tortillas are your best option if you want to eat at home or prepare something to take into work. As for the eating out every meal, you're not going to be able to do this cheaply over time. You can pick up premade salads/wraps/sandwhiches as healthier options at places like walmart or cleaner gas stations (Wawa, Racetrack, some 7-11's)  Remember the main thing when it comes to dieting is to scale down your portions and try to eat the most substantial foods to keep you full longer. Try out the app Myfitnesspal if you aren't on it already, it will have a lot of the prepackaged stuff on it, and can help you keep track of what you're eating throughout the day.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3drq7c,Yellow_giraffe,8,Sun Jul 19 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"Do you have a fridge, or just the microwave? If you don't have a fridge, basically you should think ""fancy camping"" as your inspiration, since everything will have to be stored at room temperature.   Are you willing to get a rice cooker and/or slow cooker? You can find brand new ones at Goodwill for $10-20 (usually cast off wedding presents, I suspect). Or do you have a coffee pot? There are tons of ""cook a meal in your coffee pot"" blogs. These tools will greatly diversify your food options, and don't require skills beyond reading simple recipes.   The base of a healthy meal is usually complex carbohydrates. Complex carbs are ""bulky"" and make you feel full, and  take your body a while to digest (unlike simple carbs, which can spike and crash your blood sugar). I find brown rice and quinoa to be good choices. Brown rice is cheaper than quinoa, but if you figure a big bag of quinoa can feed you for a few dozen meals, it isn't actually that expensive. A more expensive, but easier option is the precooked bags of rice in the rice aisle. They are stored at room temp and just need microwaving for a few min. Tortillas, multigrain bread, oatmeal, cornmeal, cream of wheat, and bagels can also be stored in a breadbox or cupboard out of a fridge (but check for mold on the bread if it's hot in your apartment).  The next item to incorporate is proteins. Canned beans, vacuum sealed tofu, nuts of all kinds, and even eggs (if they aren't cracked) can all be stored at room temp and cooked in the microwave. Canned tuna is another good choice.  Fresh veggies may be the hardest, depending on the temperture of your apartment during the day. Hydroponic lettuce may be ok if you keep it watered. Cherry tomatoes and avocados are usually fine too (I actually like them better at room temp). Obviously fruits are a little easier. I've had apples, mangoes and oranges last a long time out of the fridge. Buy bananas in small bunches, as they always seem to go mushy within a few days.  Misc canned goods: corn, chick peas, spiced choped tomatoes, and various soups are useful. I like the Annie's lentil soups. Also black corn tortilla chips and salsa are yummy.  Other inspirations: there are still plenty of places around the world that don't have access to refrigeration. A lot of authentic Mexican food can be prepared from canned or room temp ingredients. Indian food is also an option if you get jasmine or basmati rice. The paneer or chickpea sauce can be purchased in most ""international aisles"" in a grocery store.  Other nutrient considerations: make sure you're getting enough Vit C, D, and calcium. It's not the cheapest, but you might want to get single serve vitamin fortified orange juice a few times a week. Fresh veggies are the best, but may not be an option for you right now."

Learn how to cook, it's not hard, and ultimately cheaper. You can seriously just look at YouTube, or Google recipes, that's how I learned and now I cook for all the ladies!   What I generally did was start by cooking foods that I liked to eat and then you can move on from there, and start experimenting with spices, sometimes it won't taste great, but most of the time it will taste just as good as restaurant quality at a fraction of the price. I also cook a lot of food in the crock pot, and then throw it in the fridge and have a meal for a week or two, because I'm still lazy and prefer not to spend an hour preparing the meal.

I personally get groceries every other week and spend ~70-100 every time. I go in planning 4 ""big"" meals that I'll make, each with 4-5 servings, which gets set for ~20 of the 28 meals I need (breakfast is usually oatmeal or eggs, so that doesn't really factor into the cost). I then try to fill in the rest of the meals with basics that I can easily prepare with things I usually have around.  Big meal examples:  -Chili + cornbread (go heavy on the beans and veg in the chili)  -Asian rice/noodle stir fry (frozen veg are your friends - also prepared coleslaw mixes are 1~2$ and are just big bags of shredded cabbage and carrots)  -Pizza (dough is super easy to make, then top with anything)    ""Fill in the gap"" meals:  -Chicken + mashed potato + veg  -Chicken salad wrap(I use mashed avocado and a little ranch as a mayo substitute, add some pickle, nuts, tomato, anything, throw in tortilla)   -Frozen burritos (whenever I need to, I usually I'll make a big batch of these and freeze: veg+beans+rice+cheese+meat = fairly cheap and healthy if you watch the cheese input)"

You can get in fun stuff like pizza, burgers, tacos, etc. for reasonable calories assuming you're tracking how much you eat.  For burgers and tacos I use low fat % ground beef- in tacos it doesn't really matter since it's loose anyway, and for burgers I don't cook mine until they're well done so having dry pucks of meat isn't really an issue.  Being conscientious about how you prepare it all is key. For tacos I use corn tortillas because they're far lower calorie than flour. I measure out half a serving of cheese for my tacos because shredded cheese goes a long way. For burgers I am careful with condiments, don't use a ton of cheese or other high calorie additions like bacon, avocado, etc.  Taco salads are easy to make large batches of and use leftovers for lunches. Doing half meat half whole black beans gets you good protein and will make you full. The black beans help cut on costs.  Skinnytaste.com has some good recipes. For pasta cravings there are a few things I really like (lasagna rollups being one) on there."

Because ""carbs"" is one of the three macronutrients, you need it for a healthy body, and it's in a lot of stuff. (Like vegetables.)  In my opinion there's not really a satisfactory or cheap substitute for bread. I love fresh bread, and anything else feels fake. So I eat it, keeping it under control portion-wise.  Are you cutting out bread/pasta for a health reason other than weight loss, and do you intend to do it for the rest of your life? Often the type of diets that cut out a whole food group are difficult to stick with and the weight lost comes right back (sometimes plus some) if you start eating those foods again, because you didn't learn how to work them into your overall eating plan in moderation.  If you're feeling cranky/jealous about your friends getting to eat fried rice or baguettes, it sounds like you're not happy with your eating plan, which will just get frustrating the longer it goes on. Is there a way to readjust your outlook so that you can occasionally have those foods, and not feel deprived, instead of trying to fake a substitute?"

Carbs are one of 3 main macronutrients for healthy human bodies, the other two being protein and fat. People can debate and disagree on which types of carbs or what sources to get them from or how much of them is needed, but they are needed for a healthy body.  http://www.livestrong.com/article/419298-can-you-live-without-carbohydrates/   You can lower your intake of carbs quite a bit -- with both positive and negative side effects -- but eliminating all carbohydrates is not a safe dietary solution. You can, however, live without certain forms of carbohydrates, such as sugar.  Cutting back on carbs might have benefits when it comes to weight loss[...] cutting them out completely is problematic for other biological functions. Without the glucose that carbohydrates provides, according to the Iowa State University Extension, you might feel weak, dizzy and experience hypoglycemia -- low blood sugar. You might also experience decreased physical performance, as well as mental and physical fatigue.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dpvif,itzST,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"Cutting protein is absolutely the worst thing to do for losing weight. Muscle, unlike fat, is always working, so this increases your metabolism and keeps it high. If you cut protein, you start losing muscle, especially if you're at a caloric deficit. Also, eating protein itself increases your metabolism because your body has to do so much just to get amino acids from those proteins to work in your body."

Gotta cook the egg separately, not as good.  In terms of satiation, you just need to eat more of it because it's much lower in calories. This is fine as long as you aren't having a super rich sauce.

Normally I scramble an egg, set aside, cook the protein set aside, then cook the veg last (bean spouts, green onion, snap peas, carrots, whatever you like really). I add the processed cauliflower close to the end of cooking the veggies, it doesn't actually need to cook at all but you want the flavors to mingle.   For seasoning I usually add a little salt to the egg, soy sauce to the protein and a little soy sauce and rice wine vinegar to the veg and cauliflower.   Once your veg is cooked, add your egg (make sure to chop it up so its not just a big lump of egg in your rice)  and protein, take off the heat and season with soy sauce to taste.

You lose or gain weight by eating too little or too much calories. Cutting out processed carbs can help you lose weight by lowering overall calories. Here are my tricks on cutting down carbs but still enjoy the food:   Pasta: I would go for 1 oz of real pasta (90 calories) mix in with 1 spiraled zucchini/summer squash or just spaghetti squash. You get the volume and you still get to eat some real pasta. Rice: grated cauliflower or broccoli. I would sometimes mix them in with 1oz rice (90 calories or so) to get the volume and taste.  Eggplant: great pasta substitute as well if you have a lot of time on your hands.  Cheese and Meat can be used for pizza base   Hopefull this helps!"

Eating low carb high fat has really helped my fiance and my friend to lose weight, though YMMV, but your body needs energy from somewhere. Fats and carbs are the main sources of energy in our diets. Protein is important as building material, but shitty as a source of energy.  Edit: For a specific recommendation, it's really hard to keep costs even close to as low as you can get with a low fat, high carb diet. You might go with butter or lard to add in to whatever you would normally cook. Buying full or high fat meats can help bring that ratio up. Cheeses are pretty great for that, but as a rule, most dairy products have a pretty high amount of carbs in them and are very likely to be sold in low or no fat varieties."

No regrets.  Still using the same ones like 13 years later.  I wish the replacement lids were cheaper though.  Old ones are kinda stiff and don't seal tight anymore.

Excellent thermal shock resistance but can't be banged around too much because it can't take physical shock that well.  New Pyrex made from soda glass is the opposite. Can be banged around in your drawer but it's best not to put a glass dish into an already hot oven without preheating.  Tbh though. I've done exactly that and it hasn't shattered in the oven yet. Though after a few cycles...

I like this approach because it's cheap and you'd be amazed at how many good jars you can accumulate over some time.  I remove the labels so they look nice and they certainly do, in my opinion.

Remember to poke holes beforehand. There are really tons of things you can make without a stove or oven depending on your creativity and pallete preferences. In school I often preferred simple things to prepare. So I ate a lot of oatmeal or cereal for breakfast. Lunch was usually a salad or sandwich, both super easy to prepare, with fruit,  raw veggies, and maybe a treat like granola bars, chips, or dessert. Bananas with peanut butter, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, celery with peanut butter, and peanut butter on bagels are good if, like me, you love peanut butter and involve no cooking and little fridge space. Lots of other people gave dinner ideas (slow cookers are amazing, but do require morning prep time). If you have a few extra dollars I suggest a blender. A friend down the hall had a cheap one and we used it all the time. Smoothies are easy, you need no added sugar just some fruit, a liquid (milk, yogurt, juice), and ice. I like peanut butter, banana, and oatmeal smoothies myself. You can even add vegetables."

I also like peanut-butter stuffed celery stalks, though you'd need to carry them in a flat dish, kind of like what you get at some takeout places.   When it gets cold outside ( or if you're tired of cold food), make a thick, hearty chili or stew and pack in 1-2 cup containers on your days off. You can then grab a couple in the mornings & microwave on your breaks.   Also consider making and freezing breakfast sandwiches/ mini crustless quiches or doing slow-cooker oatmeal so your mornings are a little less rushed, too. You are a really hard worker!

Mind you, we have to get all that heavy, still-hot-from-the-oven shit unloaded and stacked before it gets too far down the line, or else it gets in the way of the dudes loading up the new stuff.  Sometimes, its not very difficult, and I get to do some work that requires speed and attention to detail which gives me a break (partially because I'm covering for the chick that usually does it, partially because I'm anal about quality control, and probably also because I'm a chick and the guys like to take it easy on me.), but for the most part, it's pretty physical.

If you can do two sandwiches you can do two burritos, one beef, one chicken, to keep it interesting. You can really load those up with a lot of protein if you keep the amount of rice minimal, and they should be easy to make in bulk! Just use a normal-sized tortilla, not those giant wraps. In my experience, they're just as tasty cold! Refried beans make the ""spread"" along with some guacamole/sliced avocado, then a bit of rice, some cheese, and the meat of your choice.

Most will have a bundle pack with assorted meats and cuts. If you are a beef eater, getting a 1/4 or 1/2 cow will save you some money also.   Growing up my parents would buy a half cow and it would almost last a year. Also, buy vegetables that are in season and cheap. A vacuum sealer would be ideal for this. I remember growing up spending a morning sealing veggies that my parents bought or hauling in the meat when my dad returned from the meat market."

The average cow will weight about 1200lbs live weight. This will produce about 530lbs of usable processed meat. The exact amount will depend on the cuts that you choose when you have it processed   The butcher will process the meat and package it. There will be different options of cuts. Time frame? Not sure, something you would have to ask the butcher.   Your cooler would probably be stuffed full with a half cow. I remember it taking a few wheelbarrow loads to transfer all the meat.   If you have a few friends that are interested in doing the same, buy a whole cow and split it up. I have some friends that are doing this once year...kind of hoping to get on it next year.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dn54j,sweatpantsenthusiast,2,Fri Jul 17 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"I would let them warm up a bit on the counter, then season them liberally with salt and pepper all over (under the skin too). Then I would put them in a cold stainless steel pan with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Turn the heat to medium high and let them sit there for 20 minutes or so...until they release from the bottom of the pan. Then flip them over and repeat.   While the chicken is cooking in the pan preheat your oven to 375F. Once both sides look GB&D (Golden Brown & Delicious), put them in a pyrex dish (or any oven safe dish) uncovered in the oven until they read 165F at the bone.   While the chicken is in the oven, pour off the oil and rendered fat from your pan and put it back on the stove on high heat. Once the pan is screaming hot (but not scorching your fon) pour 1/2c or so chicken stock (dry white wine is better) in and use a whisk or fork to scrape the fon off of the bottom of the pan. Save this liquid gold.  Once your chicken is done, take it out of the oven and let it cool on the counter for 20-30 min. The skin should be crackly like glass and the meat should be juicy and flavorful.   Once the chicken is cool, use your hands to remove the meat and all the delicious crunchy skin and put it in a bowl. Add the liquid gold you saved earlier and mix together.   This will be some of the best chicken for chicken salad you will ever eat.  Bonus tip: Shove some fresh herbs under the skin when you season the chicken (before you put it in the pan). This will add a ton of flavor to your meat."

Great with steak, burgers, grilled chicken or on tacos.   The blog has lots of pics and a printable recipe.   http://nerdswithknives.com/balsamic-roasted-red-onions-with-thyme/  Prep time: 5 min  / Cook Time: 30 min  Yield: 6 servings  Ingredients  3 large red onions (about 2 lbs / .9 kilos)  1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (60 mL plus 30 mL)  1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (60 mL) (you can use up to 2 tablespoons less if you want)  2 teaspoons fresh thyme (about 8 sprigs or 1/2 tsp dried)  1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  Method  Preheat the oven to 375ºF / 190ºC  Cut the onions in half vertically and then into 1/4 inch thick slices (not paper thin or they’ll get mushy). Place on a baking sheet and toss with olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar.   Bake on the middle rack for 30 minutes, turning once or twice, until the onions are soft and lightly caramelized. Remove from the oven, and while they’re still hot, pour over 2 more tablespoons balsamic vinegar. Toss to coat. Can be served warm or at room temperature."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dilns,undertheaurora,2,Thu Jul 16 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"I've never used kosher salt, does it taste any different from regular salt?"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dilns,undertheaurora,4,Thu Jul 16 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"It doesn't taste all that different (though I think it's a little milder) but because the grains are larger and more course, it's much easier to sprinkle evenly over things.    One thing to keep in mind, because the grains of regular salt are smaller, it takes much less by volume to achieve the same saltiness.   It's a bit easier to over-salt dishes when using regular salt because it's harder to feel in your fingers.   Edited for clarity: You can definitely use table salt but you'll just want to use less of it."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dilns,Huitzilopostlian,3,Thu Jul 16 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"i'm just throwing this out there, cause you wrote the same thing in the recipe... you should be using 'coarse' and not 'course'. I only mention it, cause I'm sure it's something you use regularly in your recipes."

I put the onion at like 400-425 and it goes in for 45 minutes.  Takes more time, but usually I already have the oven going (either roasting garlic or cooking something).

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dilns,spykid,4,Thu Jul 16 18:36:04 2015 UTC,"I would start them just with oil, salt and pepper (wait to add the vinegar and thyme).   Cook them on medium-low heat, stirring pretty often (so they don't brown too much) until they start to wilt down (probably 10-15 minutes).   Once they soften a bit, I would add the vinegar and thyme and continue cooking and stirring every so often until they are very tender and a bit brown (probably another 15-20 minutes). Once they're done, add the last bit of vinegar.   Caramelized onions take a while in a pan so you have to have a little patience but the results are delicious."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dilns,Axle-f,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Yes! Basically it's the same principle except these are going in the oven instead of a pan.

I usually halve the olive oil, and don't skimp on the dill! Salt after adding the salmon and tasting.  Edited to add: use it like bacon in a BLT--smoked salmon, lettuce, and tomato on toast with a touch of mayo or cream cheese."

I make mine in a wide mouth quart size jar, which I can easily fit my immersion blender in. A few buzzes turns a jar full of strawberries into a nice chunky jam. You could do it with a potato masher as well.  Fruit that is a bit harder, like apples, needs a bit of cooking to get soft.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dkzky,your_moms_a_clone,3,Fri Jul 17 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention the apple, because I used to make peanut butter and apple sandwiches with a drizzle of honey (they were a wonderful breakfast). Peanut butter isn't that bad for you, remember: ""healthy"" doesn't necessarily mean low carb, low fat, or even low sugar, it's all relative to your whole diet."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dkzky,Nilaxa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:53 2015 UTC,You could make your own jam! All you need is sugar (I believe there's special sugars for this) and a ton of fruit. Put it in a pot - 1:1 ratio sugar to fruit and bring it to a boil until it just starts to bubble and the fruit starts to solidify. Let simmer for some time and continuosly stir. Fill it in mason jars while still hot and seal them right after filling.  It may not be super healthy but at least it's way cheaper and healthier than the storebought stuff..
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dkzky,nevermindtheend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:53:35 2015 UTC,I often do peanut butter and banana in a tortilla. Half a banana per tortilla and you roll it up around the banana.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dl8ln,brickwall5,2,Fri Jul 17 04:26:09 2015 UTC,"Braised and Glazed Squash is a favorite of mine. Squash made that way goes well with other vegetables, too (caramelized onions, sautéed kale, browned mushrooms). Over rice or polenta (or faro or quinoa or whatever grain you're into) with a fried egg on top. You can switch up the seasoning by using different braising liquid to replace the stock--I like a little soy sauce and a little vinegar mixed with water to make 1/4 cup."

This can easily be made as a stew instead, just put it in a pot and add some broth.  Roasted ratatouille!  Combine slices of zucchini squash, egg plant, red bell peppers, tomatoes, yams, or whatever combination of sliced vegetables you want in a bowl with some olive oil, garlic, and any other spices you want. I also like to add some sliced sausage, but obviously you can omit that if you just want vegetables or want to make sure that it's low in calories. Then just spread it out on a pan, and cook at 400 for about 45 min, checking on it and kinda stirring it every 15 min or so. It microwaves really well, so I just put the leftovers back in the mixing bowl and eat it throughout the week."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dftbu,avidworks,5,Thu Jul 16 04:23:23 2015 UTC,You could certainly fry the chicken separately if you wanted to. You could keep the order the same. My rule of thumb is firmer vegetables first.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dftbu,AgDrumma07,2,Thu Jul 16 05:14:14 2015 UTC,It only took about 6 minutes to fry so any longer and the veggies wouldn't have been as crisp. You could certainly play around with the order. I suspect the difference in flavor may be minimal.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dig61,Hurleygirly,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"As someone mentioned, yogurt is a great option. But it requires refrigeration and may not work as something you can carry with you. But granola will. You can make your own out of whatever dried fruits and berries with nuts that you'd like. You can make them sweet or savory also, just to add variety. And these will last in almost any temperature. The sweet ones can help you cut back on ice cream, and if you make a savory one it may take place of one of your sandwiches.  I recently found a recipe for fake fried rice. Rather, fried fake rice. Basically you grate cauliflower and it comes out in texture somewhere between rice and couscous. Fry it like you would rice and then separately lightly fry up some veggies and an egg. Mix it up and you have a rather healthy and reasonable meal. I usually use this as a side dish to meat, but you can consider adding tofu or veggie ""chicken"" strips to make it more filling."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3djrsb,adickman18,2,Thu Jul 16 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"I love tomato juice in general, V8 especially. If you're looking for something cheaper, there are usually off-brand tomato juices available in large cans on a lower shelf. Of course, you can't store them in the can after they're opened (nor can you pour from them very effectively), so you'd have to use a decanter.  The taste of off-brand tomato juices can be very different though, depending on the mix of vegetables and spices they use."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3djrsb,jb05,2,Fri Jul 17 01:54:02 2015 UTC,"I make this pretty regularly:  Dump one can of tomato paste into a large jar or pitcher. Fill the can with water 4 times and mix it up with the tomato paste. Add garlic salt and celery salt to taste. Add Worcestershire sauce to your liking. I just add the ingredients a bit at a time until I get the flavor I like. A can of tomato paste is like 48 cents. If you make your own this way you know exactly what is in it, can change the flavors to your liking, and control sodium levels if that's something you are worried about. Plus its really good and tastes fresher than the pre-made stuff!  Also tomato paste is amazing - do you know it is the most healthful and nutritious way to eat tomatoes because cooking tomatoes actually increases the levels of lycopene and other nutrients? There have even been studies that show a diet high in tomato paste can protect against the harmful effects of the sun - in experiments, the skin of people who ate 2 tablespoons of tomato paste per day was 25% less red after UV exposure."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3diksd,mercfh85,3,Thu Jul 16 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"What type of storage do you have for your lunch - just a desk drawer, a fridge, a lunchbox with an icepack?  And how much time do you have to eat?  One thing I like to do is buy a pack of pita, two or three types of veggies, and some type of sauce (usually hummus).  Each morning, I throw some pita, the hummus and a veggie in my lunch box and then assemble it during lunch.  Takes five minutes in the morning to pack and five minutes to assemble at lunch.  It averages out to around a dollar a meal or less depending on sales.  You can keep everything in the fridge til you need to throw it in your lunch.  Another alternative is to skip lunch together and pack a bunch of fruits and veggies and nuts to snack on during the day.  It really depends on how your daily schedule works.

I've gotten one of each for ~20 at target new. The rice cooker can handle all sorts of grains, actually. And then veggies (frozen or raw, doesn't matter) in the steamer basket, use your pan for your protein and there you go. That's a base that can go world-wide depending on your mix of protein+veggies+rice+seasoning. Or throw a can of beans in with the veggies in the steamer basket, boom done, one thing to clean. I did this a lot in uni, still use it a lot of my week now tbh."

Honestly I've been omitting the potato usually, but I like tater tots for the potato part.  Once the peppers and onions are cooked, add the cooked sausage back in, add the potatoes if you're using some and have some cooked.    The thing I love about this dish is that you can season it however you want and you can use whatever kind of sausage you want.  You could even use ground beef, turkey, or whatever you want.  Super easy to make in mass quantity and split up for multiple meals through the week.    You can make it as healthy or unhealthy as you want and it's pretty guaranteed to be cheap."

With the summer harvest in full swing vegetables are abundant and cheap.  Preserving this produce is a way to carry summer savings into Fall and Winter. Fermentation is the method of preservation used for thousands of years until the invention of modern chemical preservatives.  Fermented vegetables are rich in probiotic bacteria that are essential for gut health.  Radish kimchi is a delicious hot spicy ferment that is healthy.  This kimchi is created by fermentation and is loaded with wonderful probiotic bacteria.  Ingredients:   2 Korean radishes 4 garlic cloves 2"" ginger toe  1/2 cup dried, salted shrimp Bunch of green onions Korean chili pepper flakes 4 Tbsp salt 4 tsp sugar    Peel and  slice radishes into 1"" thick disks. Cut disks into 1"" cubes. Place in bowl and combine with salt and sugar. After 1 1/2 hours wash the cubes. Make paste from garlic, ginger and dried shrimp. Combine Korean pepper flakes with paste. Cut green onions into 1/2"" pieces. Combine radish, shrimp paste and green onions. Place in jar with loose lid and ferment for 1 week then place in refrigerator.     Cabbage Kimchi   2 large Korean napa cabbage 1 Korean radish 1 bunch green onions 8 garlic cloves 1 onion Bunch of chives 3/4 cup fish sauce 1/2 cup dried salted shrimp 1 1/2 cup Korean chili pepper flakes 3 Tbsp sweet rice flour 2 Tbsp sugar 2 cups water 3/4 cup Korean solar salt   Method:   Remove outer leaves from cabbage.  Cut cabbage into  quarters.  Work salt into cabbage leaves and let rest for 2 to 3 hours, turning every 30 minutes.  After 3 hours thoroughly rinse cabbage and set aside. Combine shrimp, onion and fish sauce and puree into paste. Combine water and sweet rice flour and bring to boil, shut off heat and cool. Slice chives and green onions into 1/4"" to 1/2"" pieces. Cut Korean radish into match sticks Mix rice flour liquid, shrimp paste, radish, chives and green onions to make sauce. Apply sauce to every cabbage leaf and roll quarters and pack in jar. Leave kimchi out to ferment for several days. Put in refrigerator to slow fermentation."

If you were shopping at places like Safeway, then I think food will be about the same price in the midwest, maybe a little cheaper actually. If you were used to going to all of the little markets that locally-source produce, and that's the type of place you are looking for in Ann Arbor, you are going to have to fork over quite a bit extra due to the much shorter growing season (and overall agricultural production, actually).  All in all, I think you'll have the best bet at Trader Joe's and by going to Meijer when you need something you can't get at TJ's.  Welcome to University of Michigan, by the way!

Also meijer seems to be cheaper in general, and there's and easy bus AATA bus route to get to Kroger or meijer (free with your Mcard). I'm assuming you made it into UM, go blue! PS before I forget if you're leaving near north campus or near CCTC (the central campus bus hub) try taking the blue northwood bus up to ""the Kroger stop"" (ask any bus driver, they're really nice).

If I lived more on the north side I think I would have been at Trader Joe's more often.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ddtx6,Ooosh-E,17,Wed Jul 15 14:33:43 2015 UTC,"Anything like this is a recipe for failure. First off, I'm not even convinced that if you followed this plan to a T you'd lose weight- there's a day where dinner is cake (?!?). The big problem with diets like this that prescribe exactly what you eat, which day, is that you have no freedom, and you can develop a bad relationship with food.  For example, let's say you're following this diet, and a friend wants to get pizza for their birthday. If you're following a diet like this, you either ""succeed""- which may cause you to stay at home and miss their birthday, or go and not be able to enjoy the pizza. Or, you may ""fail""- you eat the pizza, and you failed because you did not follow the plan. I think it's best to emphasize a healthy-eating system, where you can totally enjoy that pizza, but you enjoy it in moderation, perhaps with a side salad.  I say this as someone who's seen friends follow terrible plans like Beachbody, and completely fallen off the wagon because after 5 nights in a row of ""chicken with sauteed veggies"" they saw pizza, went for it, and threw all their eating to shit. The best way to diet is to integrate sustainable, healthier choices into your life."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dcv14,cheddar_bunnies,2,Wed Jul 15 15:53:30 2015 UTC,"For a cold dish try lentil salad. It's crazy delicious. You can scale the recipe up/down.   1 cup black lentils 1 clove garlic, minced Juice of half a lemon (you can sub ACV or white wine vinegar) 1 tsp honey 1.5 tbsp dijon mustard Olive oil (honestly I always eyeball it, but probably 2 tbsp) Salt and pepper Optional: any kind of fresh herb, chopped   Cook the lentils in vegetable broth or water until they're tender-firm. Rinse them in a strainer until they are cooled. While they're cooking, whisk up the other ingredients, it should be a thick, mustardy vinaigrette. Make sure you taste it to adjust acid/sweetness/salt. When it's ready just toss the lentils in the dressing.  Goes great if you also mix in some cooked quinoa or brown rice, is awesome the next day. I usually have it with some roasted sweet potatoes and whatever leafy green I have in the fridge (you can also throw the greens in to cook with the lentils, just add more water)."

Its not easy but you just have to get over it and realize having a bad taste or texture in your mouth for 30 seconds won't kill you. I eat a ton of things now that I used to hate including all vegetables whereas before I really didn't like too many vegetables. Now some of my very favorite foods are vegetables - raw, cooked, I love them all now.   Also it's important to remember that you don't have to love everything you put in your mouth. Sometimes you just gotta eat things your body needs even if you'd rather have a pizza.  And don't forget - the shit that you eat now, whatever it is - soda, candy, fast food, pizza rolls, chips, french fries, refined sugars, fried whatever - it's precision manufactured to push the pleasure buttons in your brain and trigger all the right sensations in your mouth. It's a drug and it messes with your perception of what food should be, and what your body needs. Junk food is a multi-billion dollar a year industry, and those companies are profiting off your addiction. To get over it is really simple but also hard - it just takes time and willpower. You have to want to be healthy and happy more than you want a certain flavor in your mouth."

Had I eaten it I probably would have felt like poop all day and felt bad about myself for being a glutton.  Did I want the junk food? Oh yeah I did. But I want to be happy and healthy and feel good about myself even more. Don't get me wrong, I eat trash food sometimes, but it's rare nowadays. The corporations know you crave it, they know how to get you addicted. They know it's cheap and easy and you want it. But the less you eat it, the less you crave it.   You don't have to take the easy road every time. Let life challenge you. Let yourself be uncomfortable. Allow yourself to try things you don't really want to try. Food is one of life's great pleasures! Don't kill your taste buds (and your health) with junk and shit and sugar and manufactured who-knows-what. Don't deny yourself the simple joy of a perfectly ripe mango - a tomato fresh from the garden - beautiful crisp raw peppers - brussels sprouts oven-roasted until they caramelize on the edges - real food for your real human body!

Lack of education isn't the main reason people choose junk food. It is often because there are few good alternatives for them. They may not know how to cook and they can't afford to screw up a meal or two learning, they don't have the funds to stock a kitchen, to keep food from spoiling or getting eaten by rodents/roaches, or the time to cook, grocery shop (maybe involving an hour on a bus), then clean up between working 2 jobs, and so on.

Calorie count and nutritional info don't mean much unless youre taught to decipher it and how to make better choices -- and then have the will, time and often funds to follow through. And of course the 100% pure, no sugar added fruit juices cost a whole lot more than the mainstream commercial ones.   It's not at all impossible, but it is a difficult change to make for families who have been living their lives, and taught by their parents to live and eat a certain way, and often because of a particular set of circumstances."

Exactly why you may think it's disgusting and will make you vomit to eat processed foods, a person who has grown up eating that won't have any, or minimal ill effects at all (in terms of immediate reaction, not long term health).

Iceberg lettuce (the standard light green watery salad lettuce) is something even I don't care for. You can even little packages of tiny individual lettuce heads that you cut up yourself! Try something like that. Get closer to where your food comes from and what real food looks like. And try a few dressings to find out what you like best!

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,dandeliondid,51,Wed Jul 15 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"I used to be the same way! The important thing is to not give up and keep being adventurous. All through my childhood until I was 19, I avoided all veggies like the plague, and pretty much only ate potatoes, carrots and corn. Now my diet is mostly vegetable, lol.   You mentioned that you don't like the texture of vegetables, but which texture do you dislike? Vegies can be prepared in so many ways so I'm sure there's something for you. I'll post a couple suggestions that I personally like to eat. :)  Crunchy texture - Carrot sticks in tzatziki, hummus, whatever you like. Can also eat celery nice and raw, or just much on a juicy cucumber.   Soft texture - Any leafy green prepared with a little soy sauce, cooked down. I love eating cooked spinach and mushrooms for vitamin K and D, and iron.   Firm texture - Steamed vegetables, especially broccoli and cauliflower. Super delicious with a pinch of soy and garlic. I also highly recommend edamame beans, I like to heat a cup of salted beans and snack on them in between meals.   Crispy texture - Any roasted vegetable pretty much, pop a little seasoning on and you could roast any firm vegetable you desire, I like to do a thin cut mix of sweet potato and kale chips with light seasoning especially.   No texture - If you hate all of the aforementioned textures, don't worry! The immersion blender/food processor is your friend. You can make a really easy zucchini soup by boiling zucchini chunks and onion in chicken stock, then immersion blending them into a creamy soup, I imagine this could be done with almost any veggie.   I hope these suggestions help give you ideas! Good luck on your journey, and don't worry because if you keep trying, you'll learn to love vegies, just need to find what works for you! :)"

Do you prefer crunchy, tender, mushy, crisp, flaky, etc. Search for recipes by pairing the texture with fruit/veg: ""Tender carrot recipe"" or ""crunchy brussles sprouts.""

There's just somethings time won't help,  I've been trying to get over the slimey food problem since I was in elementary school,  I want to be able to enjoy onions, to be able to eat something at a restaurant without having to pick something because there's a chance I'll have to pick it out.  Mostly I'm pretty good but sometimes there's just no way around it,  and for mixtures I eat a small spoon/fork full and then drink water with it to take it down,  while barely even chewing as once I feel the texture my gag reflex goes and I've even thrown up from biting into a chunk of onion. Cooked veggies that get all soggy,  basically the same thing,  I could eat raw carrots for days but put them in a stew and it's basically ipecac.   Work around it,  find out what you like,  and work through it.  I love taco bell,  but they are awful for a diet.  So I make my own,  ground turkey instead of beef,  then the veggies I use are less of a variety but more of them,  load that shit up with lettuce and tomatoes.  Learn what vegetables you like and then substitute them in,  it'll take trial and error,  but the only way you'll get beyond that will be by learning to cook.  Make your own dinners,  just because people wouldn't consider it a full fledged meal doesn't mean it's not.   This is gonna be a lot of work,  but it's the only way to do it without just getting over it.  Learn to cook,  and try different things,  if you don't like something try to hide it within something else,  or find a substitute that can bring in the same flavors and nutrients.  Basically you have to learn to cook,  and it's something you should do anyway as it's a great skill to have,  sort of neccesary* for survival"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,travers101,2,Wed Jul 15 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"I was a super picky eater growing up. For that reason, I barely ate what my mother cooked. It drove my parents nuts, they even had me checked out to see if anything was wrong with me. I was just stubborn but I eventually grew out of it. I think the biggest change was actually moving out on my own and learning to cook what I wanted to eat. I enjoy cooking now, I make some really good dishes using vegetables, which I barely touched as a child. I think if you look at recipes and tweak ingredients to your liking, it will help you. Also, maybe starting adding things in smaller batches. I HATED onions, I would pick the pieces out of any food I had. So, I tried eat red onions which are a bit better tasting than white. Then, I would cut small pieces and put it in whatever I cooked. I did that with zucchini and tomatoes as well, which I despised as a child. Now, I can eat them no problem. I love junk food as much as the next person, but eating out all the time is expensive and you have bills to pay, you get inspired to make something tasty. Visit websites like budgetbytes.com or look up cooking videos on youtube to give you ideas on what to eat and the best ways to cook it."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,ameliorer_vol,2,Wed Jul 15 07:22:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a very picky eater myself, and these are the three things that have helped me to very gradually eat things I used to hate. 1. Just eat a tiny bit of something new with a meal. What I will do is usually make a small batch of a new recipe or food and then start out by eating a tiny bit for several meals. This has actually led to foods I now love such as avocados and eggs, both of which I used to despise. 2. Kind of similar to the above, but gradually add vegetables or anything healthy to meals you already eat, starting with small quantities. For instance, I love burritos. So I started to add vegetables to it, gradually increase the number of vegetables, then reduce the amount of unhealthy stuff in the burrito (i.e. cheese), and finally (just this week) I have switched from flour to low carb whole wheat tortillas.  3. Condiments! Condiments have helped a ton. For most meals I have some sort of hot sauce, ketchup, or mustard. And don't be afraid to experiment. Most people find it weird, but I love to eat broccoli with mustard."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,sjsmith074,2,Wed Jul 15 03:49:16 2015 UTC,"An immersion blender could be your best friend. I have a little picky eater and a husband picky eater and I ""hide"" all kinds of veggies in chili, spaghetti sauce, enchilada sauce, soups and gravy. They know it's in there they just don't want to deal with chunks. I've tried cooking things different ways and serving it 10 times and it has worked for some things but a lot of times it just gets wasted so a lot of it gets blended now.   It takes a little more effort but I also make stuff in big batches so we have leftovers and therefore don't eat out as much.   Bell peppers and onion add great flavor when sautéed before. Carrots add sweetness and can be used in place of sugar in tomato sauces. Spinach is pretty flavorless. I use broccoli and cauliflower sparingly though because they tend to be pretty strong flavors.    For example, when I make chili I will sauté the onion, peppers and garlic until tender then add the tomato sauce. I'll then add any other veg I want and cook until they are all soft. When they are soft just bebop the immersion blender around in it until smooth then add the meat and beans and let it cook a while longer.   Don't try blending the meat! Did this by accident once and it produces the worst texture ever."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,mamasrsoninja,2,Wed Jul 15 06:01:59 2015 UTC,"I am the same way about texture with food. Here is an example of how I've slowly over come this: while making a salad or a wrap I add both things I like and things I don't like. I love carrots, but not onions. I like beans, but not tomatoes. I put all the above in said meal and when I get to a tomato or an onion, I'm tricked. My taste buds are stoked because it tastes good and my mind can't tell the difference between the textures. Get a squishy thing and my mind thinks it's a bean. Get a crunchy thing and my mind thinks it's a carrot. Even out the ratios as you get used to eating new things."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,ELI7E,2,Wed Jul 15 04:49:15 2015 UTC,"Green smoothies. Get a really nice blender (a Vitamix or Blendtec), then make smoothies with a cup of greens (spinach, kale, chard), strawberries, a ripe banana, amd some juice/water. Maybe some sherbet to start out. Blend it till it's a drink (cheaper blenders just give you chunks of greens here) and then enjoy your servings of veggies and fruits. As you get more used to it, you can reduce the juice/sherbet, and even if you don't change anything else about your eating, you've just increased your greens intake by a fair amount.  I had the same flavor and texture issues as you - until I was 22, I only ate plain cheeseburgers, pizza, Hamburger Helper, and meats. No amount of ""practice"" has made me able to eat corn, or peas, or green beans - sometimes these lifelong pickiness issues are, well, lifelong issues. Over the last decade, I've taight myself to enjoy tomatoes (going from blended sauce to chunky to diced tomatoes to, finally in the last year, enjoying tomato slices on my burgers), and I've learned to tolerate a lot of things that are good for me, but it's a daily struggle. One thing that helped was something similar to the link provided by /u/Ceylonna, which is mindful eating practice. I used to bite into things that I disliked while actively thinking, ""You don't like this but it's not poison. Look at all of these fine people enjoying that bruschetta. You're no different, physiologically, than them (aside from maybe having more taste buds than them, which I'm still convinced is a thing), so just smile, chew, and choke it down."""

You've conditioned yourself to only ""like"" or accept certain foods and yt? need to reconditioned your body to ""like"" better foods. It really is as simple as that. 99% of ""disliking"" food is in your head. Just chew and swallow and stop making a big deal about it.   Humans are the only species that eats for pleasure.

A huge breakthrough for me was eating eggs. I always hated the texture of them, but know I make omelettes with spinach (another thing I hated) all the time. I'm never going to like a salad or broccoli, but I don't eat processed food and drink pretty much nothing but water.   Don't beat yourself up and make trying new foods fun. I incorporated new foods a little at a time. I started eating scrambled eggs with a shit ton of ketchup on it (for some reason the flavor kind of distracted me from the texture). Now I use homemade marina (with basil and oregano) and spinach or cheese and spinach. I eat a lot of the healthy stuff that I do like instead of eating just junk, which is a big deal. Every little food change is a celebration for people like us, so treat it like one. Food can be fun and healthy. Use seasonings and different cooking techniques to switch things up. Good luck!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,bears2013,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"Find out what flavors you like best--tangy? savory? Don't get discouraged if you don't like traditional salads like Caesar--I can't touch the stuff, and I don't think it's particularly healthy. What textures do you not like? A lot of the problem with texture can be easily fixed via different cooking methods. I used to HATE brussel sprouts--just the name invoked fear of a disgusting stringy goopy bland mess. But I learned my favorite way to cook'em--unthawed frozen with a toss of olive oil and salt, stuck in the oven until crispy. Now they're basically my favorite things ever, and I'm addicted.    This is just one specific suggestion, not general advice for changing your diet--I think the other posts have that covered quite well. If you like convenient food that's sure quick to make, I've been living off Mediterranean-inspired for the past few weeks and it's suuuper low maintenance as long as you're stocked up. It's also amazingly cheap, especially if you have a store like Trader Joe's that has cheap ""ethnic"" food (like pita bread), and is literally a one-stop shop.   I make a biig batch of something like Tabouleh salad (chopped parsley, cucumbers, tomatoes, some lemon juice and olive oil, some grain, etc), and proceed to eat it in various forms throughout the next 4-5 days. Hummus is also stupidly simple to make, and also dirt cheap (tzatziki is literally just sesame seeds and olive oil, then you add chickpeas and season to taste in a blender)--I also make a big batch and eat it throughout the next handful of days as a dip or as a spread for sandwiches. E.g., I'll spread hummus on a wrap, add some tabouleh, and throw on some slices of grilled chicken. A sprinkling of feta cheese tops if off. Leaves you completely full, and tastes very fresh. Or I'll microwave a couple falafels (thanks Trader Joes) and make a pita pocket with the hummus, chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, some feta cheese, and thinly sliced red onions. Or maybe once in a while I'll grill up some steak and have grilled veggies (zucchini, some small potatoes) and tabouleh on the side.   My biggest reason for avoiding ""healthy"" foods was that I never felt satiated--I thought eating healthy meant eating bland watery lettuce leaves with some tomatoes. The food I've been eating leaves me feeling so wonderfully full but not greasy or bloated or sick. It's a lot easier to eat healthier when it's the simpler option. That's why I like making larger batches of things like salads, and eating it in different ways for the next few days."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,casey12141,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:38:50 2015 UTC,"I grew up a really picky eater. I basically only ate raw foods, fruits/veggies, breads, etc. If veggies were cooked, I didn't eat them. I didn't eat pasta, rice, or pretty much anything substantial that wasn't bread. I still don't eat meat. If anything was squishy or chewy, nope. I pretty much lived on peanut butter sandwiches, apples, nuts, and raw salads. That didn't change until I was maybe 16-17.  Now I eat basically everything but meat. Dealing with sensory issues is really hard. I know how much it sucks to really want to be able to eat and enjoy something, and to be able to go to a restaurant and fit in, but almost throw up every time you eat something outside your comfort zone.  For me, I got past it by gradually pushing the boundary. I started eating plain pasta because I really needed carbs after a hard wrestling workout. The first couple nights of that sucked but after a few weeks I really craved it. Pretty much everything else that I once hated followed that format.  I'm not sure what textures you hate, or what foods you hate, but I'm assuming you're the opposite of me and you don't like fruits/veggies. Maybe try making some smoothies/juices if the texture doesn't bother you too much. My favorite smoothie right now is half a cucumber, a green apple, some kale, ginger, and a squeezed lemon all chopped up and blended together. One of these a day is a huge step towards fulfilling your fruit/veggie requirements for the day. I have a small hand blender and don't add too much water so it ends up pretty pulpy, and crunchy almost. If you have a real blender you can add a bit more water and throw it on liquify for a few minutes to basically make it a juice.  Good luck! I know you'll feel a lot better physically and mentally if you can get through this. Just takes patience and determination."

Can't be dealing with it. xD   If you can identify what about the textures you don't like, that'd be helpful. That way you can identify things that you probably won't mind the texture of, and not get too discouraged.  If you can narrow down the flavours in things you like too, and look for foods that have similar ones, that could be another way to do it. Example, if you like take away curries, try making your own curry with fresh ingredients, sweet potatoes or chicken. Lots less oil, just as curryish, etc.   Best of luck! You can do it. x"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dboc9,hollish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:50:37 2015 UTC,"What got me enjoying vegetables was to not dive in to the healthy end all at once. Basically, I took vegetables that you could make a lot less healthy (I'm southern so this actually came pretty naturally) by pretty much soaking them in butter/oil or frying them. Asparagus, squash/zucchini, broccoli, and green beans are all good for this. I love fried asparagus. Squash and broccoli are excellent with cheese - or in mac n cheese. Green bean casserole? YES.   Alternatively a lot of ranch dressing. Can you dip something crunchy in a ton of ranch dressing and enjoy it? Vegetables are great ranch vessels, especially carrots, peppers, snap peas, broccoli, and cauliflower.  I started to enjoy the actual taste of the vegetables and now I like them without all the extra unhealthy stuff."

It's not that I prefer eating plain, nutrient-deficient foods all the time, but rather that there are a huge number of foods that, due to either taste, texture or smell, strongly activate my gag reflex. I have vomited in the past from trying to force myself to eat a food that I ""dislike"" (I don't know a better word for it).   I have a lot of mental health issues that are sensory- and anxiety-related, and I suspect my picky eating may be another manifestation of these sensory issues. I've also recently (past 9-12 months) been experiencing decreased appetite, and my adverse reactions to tastes/smells/textures seem to be worse when my appetite is lower - the thought about eating anything other than very plain foods like banana, milk, or plain cereal (like Cheerios) becomes completely nauseating.

Peel a butternut squash, deseed it then cube it into bitesize pieces. Place on a baking tray/roasting tin. Sprinkle over salt and pepper plus a teaspoon of cumin and chopped/ dried sage. Plus two cloves of crushed garlic. Drizzle over oil and shake to get everything evenly mixed then put in the oven.  Dice an onion and pepper and fry on a low heat for 5 minutes. Add about 100-120g of risotto rice.  Make up a mug of chicken or veg stock. Stir in 1/5th of it. At this point check on the squash and shake it a bit to turn the pieces over.  Keep stirring the risotto and adding a bit more stock when it starts to stick to the pan. When the stock is all gone, just add the same amount of warm water at a time. After about 15 mins of last checking the squash, check it again. Poke it with a fork to see how soft it is. It probably wont be done yet. It needs to be soft enough to mash with a fork or potato masher. So check it every 10 mins or so.  When both the rice and squash is soft, take the squash out of the oven. Split the mix in half as one squash makes about 4 portions. You can put one half in the fridge or freezer, whole or mashed for another meal. Split the remaining squash in half again. Mash one half with a fork or potato masher and stir into the risotto and cook for a couple of mins.   Serve up, putting the cubes of squash you kept whole on top. This gives a bit more texture and adds to the presentation. This goes really well with chicken, so you could roast a chicken thigh per person with the squash."

I love doing this with gouda, or a bit of blue cheese  throw the patties into a frying pan on a medium-high heat. Use your judgement when cooking them - depending on the size of the burger it can take anywhere from 2 mins per side to 5 mins per side.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dd53e,fontophilic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:24:19 2015 UTC,Should i boil the chicken first??  How much water do it add? Enough to cover the chicken?  Do i leave a lid on it or bring it to the the boil and then simmer for 2 hours?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dd53e,fontophilic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"No need to boil it separately.   Enough water to cover everything. Make sure the chicken is submerged.   Leave the lid on.   If after 2 hours, it's too watery, leave the lid open.   Just keep checking and tasting!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3dc6c6,strawberrykoff,11,Wed Jul 15 03:11:28 2015 UTC,"I know this is kind of a lame one- but I would get a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shred it and put it over tossed greens. You can store the chicken in ziplocks and you can eat it cold without issue.   Do you have a microwave? If so you can make scrambled eggs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hs8dZuzIFs  which you can then put in a wrap/sandwich with some deli meats for extra protein.   Hope this helps!  Edit: oh yeah! if you like tuna, you can pop a can of that and mix it with an avocado! Also cottage cheese or greek yogurt with fruit and nuts."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3dc6c6,thesnarkysloth,6,Wed Jul 15 07:21:36 2015 UTC,"Just note that a lot of the hotels mini-bars are not fridges and don't keep food as cold as a fridge does. Be sure to call the hotel in advance and ask otherwise you'll have some questionable change of spoilage.  Also, depending on the hotel, you could always ask the front desk (preferably in advance, yet again) if they offer a way to heat your food in a microwave. The hotel has to feed the staff too during their shift so in the staff cafeterias they have microwaves and such. It's just not openly available until requested and you might not get that level of service at a cheaper hotel.  Lastly, if you are thinking about possibly bringing some kitchen appliances always double-check with the hotel. Some are against their room standards as they can be fire hazards and the fire marshal won't allow it so the hotel can't allow it."

You could try adding just enough sugar to where it satisfies your taste buds, then gradually reduce the sugar to 0.

My ""adult acne"" pretty much cleared up and I only get the occasional big pimple now. My ""insomnia"" which I struggled with for as long as I can remember is totally gone and now I fall asleep within 10 minutes of getting in bed most nights, sleep really well, and wake up refreshed. My body just feels better, my joints hurt less, my back is still creaky but less so. TMI but I used to have a lot of issues with constipation and that's not the case any more, thank god. I used to complain that I was ""sensitive"" to heat and bright sunshine, turns out I was just extremely dehydrated all the time.

Back in high school I was working at a pizza restaurant and we had free soda for employees. I was drinking a glass or two of Dr pepper in a two or three hour shift and realized how awful that was. Now if I have a sip of Dr pepper my whole face puckers
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d8mh3,wishforagiraffe,13,Tue Jul 14 19:14:44 2015 UTC,"I gave up soda for over a year for the same reason.  I was working in fast food and just drank tons of free soda, especially since I was often working 12-14 hour shifts.    But even after giving it up for over a year, that first sip of Dr. Pepper was fucking fantastic.    I don't mean to rain on your parade, or anyone else's, but I felt like it was a personal failing that I liked it after giving it up, since so many people talk about how they just can't stand soda after drinking nothing but water for so long.  That wasn't my experience at all.    It's still something I only drink on occasion, though, and I never buy it to have at home.  I'll just drink it now and then at a restaurant."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d8mh3,IfWishezWereFishez,4,Tue Jul 14 19:36:21 2015 UTC,I think I would probably still like Coke. It's got that balance between crisp and sweet that a lot of other sodas don't. But I won't even try a sip for fear that I'll start drinking soda regularly again.

I make ""infused"" water at work but instead of letting it sit (because I'm thirsty right away) I kind of muddle/smush the fruit and mint in the glass with a little bit of water and then top off the glass with ice/water. You don't have to complete smash it but it helps release a little bit of juice and flavor.

Half lemonade, half water to start. Once I got used to it, I increased the amount of water in the mixture. I'm to the point where I usually put 90% water, 10% lemonade.

All of the herbal zingers can sit for multiple hours to get really strong and very sweet.  However, if you don't have Celestial Seasonings in your region (they're not sold everywhere) then I highly recommend Adagio teas.  They come extremely fresh, and they have a Wild Strawberry herbal that really actually does taste a lot like Cool-Aid."

A lot of flavors from fruits don't come out on their own. If I did strawberry and mango alone, I wouldn't expect the outcome to be that great.  Usually you have to add some kind of strong flavor or citrus to start the process. I usually add lemon/lime, cucumbers or mint to my infused water.

I don't drink soda or sweetened teas, mostly just black coffee, liquors and beer, water and homemade smoothies (with almond milk.)  So relatively my palate isn't deadened to sweetness, and if the argument is I need to kick the above drinks and stick to water, well frankly you're wrong.   Still, this infusion thing tastes like weak tea no matter if its mint leaves, citrus fruit or cucumber.  Without any double blind investigation I can't say it is placebo but I'm not buying it.

Sliced fruits which are then allowed to sit in water just won't impart the amount of flavour you are expecting.   I would suggest that you either blend the fruits and then strain the juices into the water, which may make the flavour much stronger. Yes... this is no longer 'infused' water, but it will likely get you the flavour you want.  Or, you could try stronger flavours. I soak cardamom (skin and seeds) in my water over night. Pretty powerful stuff as it is a 'spice'. You could also try crushed mint leaves. These spices are inherently strong and should give you the stronger flavour you are seeking."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d8mh3,Luftwaffle88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:15 2015 UTC,What you need is a dehydrator. Dehydrated fruits release their favor into the water much better. Also works great with vodka.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d8mh3,jesuspants,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:30:06 2015 UTC,A few hours isn't much. You should let it sit 24-48 hours. I haven't made infused water but I have made cold brew tea and coffee and it takes about 24-48 hours to make a good cold brew by just letting it sit on a counter (closed jar). Note that I did not do this in the fridge. That means that the warmer temperature outside the fridge speeds up the interactions. If you put something in the fridge and expect a reaction it will happen slower. So be patient.   Also if you are hooked on sugary stuff just try drinking only water for three days and don't eat anything rich. Then try your koolaid or soda again and I guarantee it's going to be syrupy and nasty. By that time your infused water will taste delicious ;)

Here's what you do:  Either use 1 teabag or 1 teaspoon of leaves per 8 oz (1 cup) water.  Put an appropriate ratio of tea and cool water in a pitcher.  Stick in refridgerator for 8 hours.  It's now done.  If it's a huge pitcher, i don't even bother measuring the tea and just dump in as much as I can fit in the tea sac.  Essentially, it's not as bitter as normal tea but any flavors come through so if you brew mango tea, it has a strong mango taste.  Heck, you could even mix it with some lemonade or just sweeten as you like."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d8mh3,snakejawz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like maybe I am somehow doing something wrong here. maybe my expectations are unrealistic though, but its hard to have any realistic expectation when everything i have read have left impressions that basically equated it to actually biting into the fruit.   Depending on how bad your Kool-Aid habit is, actual fruit might not taste very good to you either. Your taste buds are most likely unable to appreciate tastes that don't resemble a literal bowl of sugar.  The good news is that it's completely reversible, and all you have to do is drink water. Just regular water, with no flavor, like people have been doing for thousands of years. I promise it won't kill you. If you can manage that for a few weeks, sweetened drinks will start tasting way sweeter. You might like ""infused water"" (whatever the fuck that even is) a lot more. Hell, you might even decide that regular water is good enough and lose the desire to make the liquids you consume taste like a Jolly Rancher."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d8mh3,ryzzie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"The tongue tastes sweet, sour, salt, bitter, and umami. The nasal passages taste smells. Any food is made up of those two. Water has no smell, but it does have slight tongue taste (more, depending on the mineral content). Infuse the water, and all of a sudden it has a smell. Add sugar, and now it has a very strong sweet tongue taste.   Without sugar, your tongue is going to crave some sort of tongue taste (sweet taste is probably the most satisfying because of evolutionary forces).   The secret is to find water that has a tongue taste. You can add salt (fucking gross), sugar (which is what you're trying to cut out).   This leaves you with sour and bitter (and the elusive, little understood, umami). How do get this? Minerals.   Mineral water (or a step further, seltzer water).   I quit soda and all sugared drinks several years ago. I could not have done it without seltzer water. It might take a little while to appreciate the taste, but it works.

My friend says it's very close to a Persian dish his family makes, so I call it Persian Spiced Lentils.  Persian Spiced Lentils  Serves: 16   Ingredients   4 cups regular brown or red lentils 8 cups vegetable stock or water 2 onions, diced 4 cloves garlic, microplaned 1 tablespoon minced ginger (or 1.5 tsp powdered) 4 tablespoons butter or ghee, divided 1 tsp red curry paste (the good stuff from Thailand that doesn’t have English on the label and is like 85% crushed chilis) 1 tablespoon garam masala 2 tsp turmeric 2 tsp cumin 2 tsp coriander 8 roma tomatoes, chopped 1 teaspoon salt plus more to taste cilantro or parsley for garnishing rice or quinoa for serving roast vegetables for serving (I like broccoli) Greek yogurt for serving   Instructions    Rinse the lentils and let them drain.   Cook the spices and curry paste in a skillet over low heat with 1 tsp of ghee until toasted and fragrant, about 5 mins.  Add the diced onions, pinch of salt, garlic and ginger, plus some more ghee, turn the heat to med-high, and cook until the onions are softened, about 10 mins.  If the spices start to burn, lower the heat and add a little water or stock.  While the onions are cooking down, chop the tomatoes.  Add the onion mix, lentils, tomatoes, the remainder of the ghee, and the stock to the Crockpot. Stir, cover and cook on high for 4-5 hours or low for 7-8 hours.  Check once or twice during cooking to add more water or stock if the lentils are soaking up all the liquid. The amount of water or stock you add depends on how soupy you want your lentils to be. Taste and season with salt. Lentils will be soft when they are done cooking.  Sprinkle with cilantro/parsley and roast vegetables just before serving. Serve over rice or quinoa or even naan. Top with Green yogurt if you like.   Notes: the reason you pre-cook the spices and the onions is to coax more flavor from them, thereby making a tastier dish. You could just throw everything into the Crockpot, but it would just be okay. We don’t like “just okay” food. We like awesome food. So pre-cook your spices and onions."

If you want to be able to eat meat, though, ypu could try other meats. Ground turkey doesn't sound necessarily appetizing to a lot of meat eaters but I find it a great way to have some meat flavor in a healthier way. It seems to be good for meatballs and as an addition to beans or spaghetti sauces.   We eat a lot of beans around here. You have to kind of learn the textures of different beans cooked to figure out how you can incorporate them in to foods. Chickpeas are a good way to bulk up soups- you can put them in nearly anything and they just absorb the flavor since they have a very mild taste on their own. You can make cold bean salads which are great for lunches. Burritos are a great way to eat black beans- with some brown rice. They save well and you can make a lot of them at a time. Eat lots of veggies to fill up. We have probably tripled our veggie intake since we stopped eating so much meat. When we do eat meat, it is generally a small serving of chicken."

Firstly, I'd start stocking up your freezer with meat and fish whenever it's a good price. The cheapest chicken gets around me is about $0.99/lbs. When I see it at that price I'll buy a whole big bunch. I portion it into freezer bags and label it. It's not crazy to buy 20lbs of chicken at that price.   That way 1 large chicken thigh is about $0.25 and about 20g protein. Adding two of those to your current menu adds $0.50/day and hits your target.   Also love sardines (costco or Trader Joes). One can is about $0.80-$1, and has 23g protein.   Tilapia and other frozen white fish can be around $1.50-$2lbs.  So yes, if you buy a 4lbs beef roast at a non-sale price, meat can be very expensive.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3daojq,FernsAreFine,2,Wed Jul 15 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone always falls back on it, but for good reason. Rice and dried beans. Costs pretty much nothing, can be used to make a million different things, easy to modify the flavor, and most importantly it's packed with protein. Getting the flavor to your taste can be a bit of work at first. But after that there's so many options.   A vegetarian burrito can be done insanely cheaply, for example, compared to what it'd cost to have someone else make it for you. And garlic or onions really add a lot to the beans in my opinion. And without really driving up the price all that much. As long as you're careful with it even some very light toppings like salsa or cheese won't add too much to the cost since it's spread out over so many meals. And the amount of protein you get from rice and beans can be a godsend if you're lacking in it. The protein thing for vegetarians can be a little overplayed. But personally, with my tastes I'd find it hard to keep in a healthy protein range if I didn't love rice and beans so much.   I usually just make up a big batch of beans every sunday for the week. One tupperware container of beans for spicy meals and another that just gets a bit of salt when cooking.   Oh, and frozen veggies are something I always like to have in my fridge for really easy and meals. I think they often get a bit of an unfairly negative rep. Obviously fresh would be better.

Basically, the idea is that because tofu comes packed in water, it's full of that water and you want to get rid of it so you can get marinade inside instead. Don't try this with any tofu called ""silken,"" which is used to make creamy things like pudding and smoothies. What you're looking for is firm or extra firm, which comes in rectangular or square blocks.   Open the package, drain out all the water, and pop your brick of tofu down on a plate covered with a clean kitchen/tea/muslin towel. Then you toss another towel (the woven kind, not terry cloth) over the top, another plate over that, and something heavy on top. I just use cans of tomatoes or beans for that. Here's a more detailed breakdown, which smartly includes tipping the bottom plate to let the expressed liquid run into the sink. (I admit that I just do this manually every few minutes and give the top plate a good  squeeze each time to help expedite the process, but I have an extremely small sink and very little counter space, so this is how I make do.)  For marinade, if you aren't vegetarian or vegan, you can use literally anything. I'm not either, so I admit to being less than well informed about the full range of options here, but I do know that there's vegan soy sauce and probably Worcestershire, also. You'll want an acid, an oil, herbs and spices, and something salty. Tofu as packaged is extremely neutral in flavor, so there's no base flavor like you'd get with, say, a steak. I just mix the marinade directly in a gallon freezer bag, pop the tofu in and squish the liquid around it a bit, then let it rest in the fridge until I'm ready. I think 20 to 30 minutes is a good minimum time, though, if you're in a rush. You can let out hang out while you prep veg or whatever.   To cook the seasoned tofu, just heat a little oil in a skillet, slice or cube or wedge your tofu, then let it pan fry until the exterior is golden brown and delicious."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d4hl8,westoftheocean,3,Tue Jul 14 04:27:02 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Thanks I will definitely try this!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d4hl8,JoyceCarolOatmeal,4,Tue Jul 14 05:29:08 2015 UTC,what do you marinate the tofu with?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d4hl8,westoftheocean,6,Mon Jul 13 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"Depends! Any marinade you'd use for meat is fine for tofu. For this I'd probably do soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, green onions and maybe a little sesame oil.   Edit: mobile-related typos."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d4hl8,BarleyWarb,5,Mon Jul 13 18:26:41 2015 UTC,Thanks! I don't really cook much meat so this is very helpful. Sounds delicious.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d4hl8,dlvial,3,Mon Jul 13 21:52:41 2015 UTC,That's exactly how I do it too. Really simple but nice and crispy.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d4hl8,JoyceCarolOatmeal,8,Mon Jul 13 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"For a bit of a bonus, do this, and then remove the tofu and coat it in nutritional yeast while you deglaze the pan, then saute it again with a mild squirt of soy sauce. That's how my local veg restaurant does it and once I found out, I can't stop. It is, as they say, dank."

That said, there are other fish/sea critters that are less expensive that you could use to make a dish similar to this."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d405u,this_is_not_enough,2,Mon Jul 13 15:46:22 2015 UTC,":) yeah, ""sharp side"" is a bit odd. But basically, the edge, not the rounded side. It is AMAZINGLY how well this works to peel ginger since spoons are a blunt edge. Better than a sharp edged potato peeler, which will tend to take off a slice of ginger flesh as well.   Fresh ginger is skin and softer outer flesh and fibrous inner flesh. You want to save that outer part for use, not throw it out w the skin. Personal preference, but when grating ginger, I only use the outer flesh and toss the fiber core away, doesn't grate well. Chopped ginger in pieces is ok to leave it all bc few people chew/eat ginger. But the fibers can be unpalatable in a sauce."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d6z5z,milksteakshake,7,Tue Jul 14 00:32:21 2015 UTC,"You can get a lot of meals out of one chicken. For example:   Start by roasting it. I love mixing up minced garlic with butter and olive oil and smearing it under the skin. Add a lemon to the cavity and have it with roasted veges (make extra veges for further meals).  Then take off all the leftover meat, shred it and package it up into 3-4 more serving sizes. You can freeze it for use in other meals later in the week.   Chuck the carcass in a pot with a couple of diced carrots, celery, onion and water and cook it down for several hours to make stock/soup. Squeeze out the lemon from the chicken if you like it more lemony. You should get quite a lot of liquid out of one chicken carcass, and can portion and freeze them.   Use the stock to make chicken soup, risotto or pilaf (risotto with leftover diced roasted veg is awesome with a little parmesan). Add some of the chicken to these dishes.   Make a stirfry or fried rice with some chicken, broccoli and other greens. If you do stirfry instead of fried rice, use Japanese soba noodles as they go great with this combo. The wholemeal ones are pretty healthy and delicious.  The lemon/garlic flavour of the chicken is amazing with soy and add some fresh grated ginger if you have any."

They're not too expensive. I can't remember the prices right now. But that's easily 4 or 5 dinners with other sides.  Buy your chicken in bulk.

I would pick three or four proteins that you really like (chicken is sometimes cheap, pork chops are always cheap and tilapia is always cheap) and pair with some fresh veggies and some frozen depending on what you like. I love brussel's sprouts but frozen ones are gross, so, I pick and choose.   Yogurt and oatmeal for breakfasts are great savings as well, a bunch of bananas can be added to both too!   My lunches are usually whatever is left over from the night before or some of what is left over on top of spinach and kale salad. So if you have extra chicken it can become a chicken and kale salad. If you have extra pork chops it can become a wrap if you have any leftover tortillas (my go to instead of bread - when you only have cheese and tortillas, you can still have quesadillas!).   Play around with herbs and spices too, maybe one new spice per shopping trip until you have a nice variety.  I think you'll do well on your budget!"

I really like buying chicken because it's the most affordable / healthy option but if you check your groceries weekly deals, they usually rotate deals on fresh fish/ shrimp/ seafood almost every week and then centering the week's meal on what the deals your grocery has that week. $60.00 should be able to feed you pretty well. Simply cutting out some junk food will also help save (eating full meals instead of snacking on chips and soda). I'd really recommend buying food staples like flour, spices, baking powder, sugar, etc. because left over fruit makes really great breakfast breads and pastries. For me, I usually make a big dish like lasagna and use left over meat sauce for spaghetti, roast entire chicken and shred some chicken for sandwiches and use carcass to make chicken stock,  make big batch of chili and eating it with noodles or crackers, rice and pan fried meat (fish, chicken, steak) and using left over rice to make fried rice.   http://www.budgetbytes.com/ is really great too!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d7alx,night-bus,4,Tue Jul 14 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"My biggest recommendation is a good rice cooker in your room. I had limited access to a kitchen for a while and the thing was a life saver. They can be insanely versatile the more you experiment with them. Though I'd advise avoiding the absolute lowest price point models as I've found they tend to break pretty easily. A modest increase in price can mean a huge increase in quality. I've been using an aroma digital rice cooker/steamer for years and it's still doing great. Only about $30 on amazon right now. Which is obviously a big chunk of a total $150 food budget, but in my opinion it's worth it in a situation like yours.   The obvious there is brown rice. I know, carbs and all. But I think that while higher in general, it's still far better than what you'd find in any cereal. And it's cheap, filling, and depending on your diet can be fairly nutritious. But also easy to store and prepare when you don't have access to a kitchen but do have a rice cooker. With any dried thing you probably should take some precautions for bugs if there's a lot in the house. But you're probably safe keeping dried foods in your room as long as you're careful with it.  You mentioned having some freezer/fridge space and that's all you'd need for some frozen veggies. You'd be the expert there, but I think that the pre-freezing prep there should make them suitable for you. If so they're a great addition when making rice. Take out of freezer, toss into steamer tray when cooking the rice, done.   Beans are a really good addition too. I know, rice beans/lentils are kind of a cliche recommendation. But it happens for a reason. They're versatile as hell. It's not optimal, but you can use dried beans with a rice cooker too without needing to involve a stove. Just those basics offer a lot of room to work with different ideas. A little flavoring in the water can really change things a lot. I like to add a little taco sauce, depending on the nature of the meal. Doing the beans separate from the rice opens things up a lot more. Something like ground red pepper can be kept in your room too without any issues. At my laziest I'm usually fine with just tossing plain brown rice, beans and steamed veggies into a bowl and throwing some soy sauce on top. But it's really easy to move past that into something more complex tasting but only slightly more time consuming.   Rice cookers are really, really, awesome when you don't have much access to a kitchen."

Roasted cauliflower turns what I find disgusting raw into a nice nutty flavor that is yummy and versatile. I have seen people turn it into soup, pizza crusts, etc.   The grill could be your friend too- throw your broccoli on the grill with some olive oil, salt pepper and red pepper flakes. Try grilled pineapple rings for dessert, they will surprise you  Portabella mushroom caps can be marinaded and treated like a steak, or used instead of corned beef for a Reuben and the like."

The last 2 pounds are still being pickled in just a salt brine and then I'll can them. The ones in vinegar kept in the fridge weren't canned, but should be safe for several months. Properly canned peppers will last for years. If you don't want them too hot, just remove most of the seeds before pickling.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d11o5,Fewbugie,7,Tue Jul 14 02:51:52 2015 UTC,"If you lacto-ferment the peppers instead of pickling, you don't need to worry about botulism and it also helps preserve the peps. I've totally strayed from pickling + canning after discovering fermenting. It's a cool bridge between art and science. The way flavors change over time is fascinating. For example, I've tried fermenting the salsa in its entirety (tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc) in one jar and also fermented them separately and mixed and matched fermented and unfermented veggies. It's a lot of fun and the amount of things you can ferment is almost endless. All ya need is water, salt, and a jar. Plus, you get some beneficial bacteria for your gut flora!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d11o5,ketchupboogie,3,Sun Jul 12 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"Water, salt and a jar.... that's all? I'm just trying to catch on to how this works. I'm curious because my friend and I grow tons of hot peppers and usually have more than we know what to do with. This sounds like an interesting way of dealing with the surplus."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3d11o5,hotakyuu,5,Mon Jul 13 00:49:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have the same issue. So basically, lactobacili exist in the ambient environment and on the skin of the vegetable. You want to create an environment where the lactobacili thrive and other, ""bad"" bacteria cannot proliferate. Lactobacili have no problem living in salt, where as other microbes are killed by it which is the purpose of the brine. For example, the bacterium that causes botulism is necessarily anaerobic whereas lactobacili can survive in either an oxygenated or anaerobic environment. This is why you must be careful with canning. If you don't boil the jars long enough, then you're creating a perfect breeding ground for the bad bacteria to proliferate. With fermenting, there's at least -some- oxygen involved, creating an environment in which the bacterium (can't remember its name) cannot thrive. It also cannot thrive in acidic environments. As the lactobacili take hold, lactic acid is created as a byproduct so the environment is not only salty but acidic and aerobic. So you submerge your vegetable in the brine, seal it in a jar, preferably with a rubber o ring and a latch and just give it time. I'm on mobile and people are yapping at me n shit so this isn't a great explanation  but I'd be happy to go on about this or clarify if you'd like to know more. There's a great book by Sandor Katz called the Art of Fermentation with tons of info and there are good recipes over at Cultures for Health, and elsewhere. Don't be too alarmed by the ""woo"" aspects as those people have really grabbed onto this trend. There are actual health benefits and it's helpful for preservation. Their recipes work just fine though :P  EDIT: got a moment to myself so wanted to go ahead and throw some things I've noticed out there. This isn't true for all veggies but with peppers, I've noticed the longer the ferment, the better. I've gone as long as three months which, I believe, is even less time than the Tabasco peppers are aged when they make the hot sauce. Usually a month will be good. With cucumbers, I only go three days. Use baby cucumbers. I've fermented snap peas, which came out great. Of course, you can ferment cabbage too. I've had a lot of luck with onions, although garlic takes on a kind of licorice-y flavor which I won't describe as bad but is just.. not really what I'm looking for. I've made mustard and let it ferment as well, with a bit of whey. That shit is bomb. I've had success with okra. I've done broccoli, brussels sprouts, green beans and mustard greens to varying success. But seriously, the experimenting is half the fun. When I know something will go bad before I get to it (in addition to a big garden I also get produce through a CSA and sometimes I'm not diligent), I just ferment it. Oh, and if you like beets, look into beet kvass. It's awesome. Frankly, I'm looking into a way to monetize it.  EDIT 2: Holy fuck, sorry. I just really love talking about this and getting people started. Here's a cool recipe that has a bit of information you might find useful in it too."

This is something I would really be interested in trying and I appreciate the quick layman sciencey explanation and recommendations.

Slice the peppers in half lengthwise, rub a little oil on the skin side, and toast them for about 5-10 minutes until you see a couple little blisters forming on the skin. While that's going on, chop up some onion, fresh spinach, and fresh tomato very fine, if you have those things. If not, feel free to leave out one, two, or all of them. If you wanna use them, mix the chopped veggies with the ricotta. When the peppers come out of the oven, let them cool, they'll be very hot.

Shred into strips lengthwise by hand (preferably hand shredded and I'd highly suggest wearing some sort of food prep gloves for the step above and this step) Put into bowl with some soy sauce, crushed garlic, a splash of white rice vinegar, a splash of sesame oil to taste.

I use a lot of garlic, fresh spices, sriracha, etc. When you're at the grocery store, read labels. A LOT of packaged products are very high in sodium. Almost all frozen foods are even higher.  Another good option is to do a stir fry with chicken, vegetables, rice/noodles. There are a few brands (can't remember them off the top of my head) that have a teriyaki stir fry sauce that is pretty low in sodium and healthy overall. Just remember to pay attention to serving size. Sauces are very easy to add 5x the recommended serving which defeats the purpose."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3d29bf,jlfon,5,Sun Jul 12 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"Microwave sweet potatoes: poke a couple holes in the potato, put it in a bowl and microwave for probably 6-8 minutes, flip it half-way through. It's really easy.   Sauteed asparagus or green beans: Olive oil in a pan, throw your veggie in and stir them around for 8-10 minutes til they look done. You can season with garlic/pepper/parmesan, or just salt & pepper. Very yummy  Rice: seriously, you can add so much to rice. I do a spanish rice with  black beans, brown rice, a can of rotel tomatoes, some cheese and cilantro on top. Or I've mixed green/red/orange peppers in with rice and black beans. You can do similar stuff with quinoa, if that's something you can eat.  Roasted potatoes: especially good with red potatoes, and you can throw veggies in too, like brussel sprouts (YUM!). I just cut them into bite size pieces, throw them in a ziploc, and shake with olive oil and seasoning. My dad always did this with a package of lipton onion soup mix, but I usually do salt, pepper, mrs dash, and thyme. Once it's good and mixed up, empty it onto a baking sheet, takes about 25-30 minutes in a 400 degree oven."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cz07x,skyyz,93,Sun Jul 12 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, jasmine rice is my go-to for just about everything, but that's because I grew up on it as I'm half Vietnamese. I think jasmine rice is somewhat fragrant but since I'm so used to it, I consider it's flavor a sort of ""blank slate."" My parents usually buy Golden Phoenix brand jasmine rice, but I personally don't find much difference in taste among different brands. I think one of the more common brands, even among American markets, is Mahatma. I've tried it before and find that it tastes pretty much the same, although I think the water-to-rice ratio can differ between different brands (and different rice crops). I find that Japanese short grain rice (not sushi rice) tends to be a little stickier than jasmine, but that might be because I don't soak my rice before cooking. Brown rice is healthier than white rice because it still has the bran and germ and thus contains more nutrients-- similar to eating whole wheat bread versus white bread. Brown rice tends to have a nuttier, more pronounced flavor than white rice. I haven't really tried other varieties such as basmati rice, which is usually used in Indian cooking. But from what I've tried, I think basmati tends to be less glutinous than white rice and feels a bit drier as a result.  As others have said, it usually depends on your personal preference. What you can do is, you can look at the labels at the market (the market's price labels will probably tell you what kind of rice it is, or you might see some English on the back side of the rice bag) and then do your own research on the general taste of the rice or what kind of cooking it's used in. You can then see what you might like and start trying different varieties that way.  Edit: Also, another thing to consider is that brown rice spoils faster than most other varieties because of the bran and germ. I think it usually lasts around 6 months when raw whereas most other varieties will last indefinitely (provided the rice is kept in a cool, dry, area in an airtight container)."

Given the prevalence of over eating and obesity, it's generally good to choose low gi foods. High gi foods spike blood glucose levels, which can trigger over eating when they crash, and is also stressful for the pancreas.  Furthermore, jasmine rice has been bred to be high gi.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cz07x,Run_bish_ruuun,20,Sun Jul 12 05:20:07 2015 UTC,"I currently live in Korea - the most popular type of rice that they eat here is actually a kind of bean and rice mixture. It has mung beans, brown rice, etc, all mixed up together. It's decently healthy and has a lot of vitamins and minerals. You can easily distinguish it because it has brown, green, and black specks mixed in with white rice. I actually love this mix - tastes amazing and acts as white rice in any dish but with the added benefits of variety!  They also really like black rice (also known as forbidden rice, or purple rice because it actually cooks up to be a dark purple and not black). Some online sources say it is even better for you than brown rice, but in general it seems to be the healthiest kind of rice - at least that's what Koreans have told me!  As for texture, most of the rices have a similar texture so long as you cook it the way you want. Brown rice can be made less soggy/sticky with less water, less cooking time etc.  Glutinous rice/sticky rice is good for sushi bowls, asian curries, anything like that. It's the most common kind of rice in Korea. Not the most popular, but the most common as it is the cheapest and easiest. So I assume they have a bunch of bags of that at your local store.  Also - if you get the google translate app on iOS (don't know about android) it can take pictures of characters and translate them. It's shoddy at best but it might help!   I've yet to easily find Jasmin rice in Korea, but I have a feeling it's just a Korea thing, and that you should be able to find it in Asian grocery stores. Otherwise, most rices have different flavors and textures, and the ones that are more Japanese and Korean tend to be stickier.  If you have any questions you can PM me. I've come to learn a fair bit about rice since I moved to Korea hahaha"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cz07x,Terrance_aka_Magnus,5,Mon Jul 13 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"What others said.   Jasmine is what you usually get served at Chinese restaurants. Short grain usually in sushi Japanese rice. Basmati is a long slender grain usually in your Saffron Indian rice with curry.   Go for the cheapest kind and see how you like it. The cheapest ones tend to be the most inoffensive and less bizzare and not picky about how it's cooked or served.   One more note: new bag of rice will need little less water to cook. Once it has sat around for a while you'll need a bit more water than originally. If you messed up and it's hard or too soft, congratulations, you can still make congee."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cz07x,Chocobean,4,Sun Jul 12 06:20:10 2015 UTC,"At first we always got a giant bag of jasmine rice because that's what my husband grew up on(his mom is Filipino).

I grew up on Minute Rice so it's been like a whole new world. But really, basic jasmine rice will get you pretty far."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cz07x,SashkaBeth,3,Sun Jul 12 06:22:18 2015 UTC,"This is the answer. ""Asia"" isn't one uniform culture. Different kinds of rice are traditionally used in different cuisines and different dishes. So get the rice that goes with the kind of dishes you cook."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cz07x,thephoton,4,Sun Jul 12 15:51:48 2015 UTC,"From my time in Japan, here's what I'll tell you:  If you like your rice on the drier side (the way it's often served with Chinese food), go with Jasmine. If you prefer a firmer, stickier and slightly moister rice like this, you want medium or short grain rice (what we tended to have in Japan), and the trick is to find the type with the most translucent grains. If they have lots of white marks, look very opaque, etc, you don't want them. A lot of brands will have a small, clear plastic ""window"" on the bag so you can compare.   Try around, but know you pretty much get what you pay for with rice."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cz07x,accpi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"Rice has a big problem with arsenic levels. Be sure to check out consumer reports to be informed about which rices have lower levels (on mobile, can't link). For example, one cup of Texas based brown rice already surpasses the weekly arsenic allotment for adults, set by national health guidelines. Even those rice cake snacks have enough arsenic for a child to max their week allotment with just one.  Ways to reduce arsenic include rinsing well (except white rices which generally have nutrient sprays that you shouldn't rinse off -- the lowest arsenic whites are generally basmati varieties, check the consumer reports), and cooking with a large amount of excess water and draining the extra water once done.   Edit: Wild and brown rices have high arsenic content, but they have better nutrient profiles. Black wasn't tested. Personally, I prefer a black/brown/wild rice mix 1:1:1 and cook with plenty of excess water and drain when done. Black has a lot of antioxidants, brown has a lot of protein and fiber, and wild has even more protein and a hearty texture."

I don't think there's anything Anglo-centric about being inquisitive about cuisine standards in other cultures. in fact, I don't really understand why that would even be Anglo-centric, unless you're simply using that as shorthand for ""inhabiting a mindset typical of a citizen of Western civilization"". in my opinion, even that is a bit of a stretch. I understand what you're trying to say, and there are good motivations behind your sentiment, but it comes across as discouraging somebody from asking perfectly reasonable questions. I think that anybody examining food products in an unfamiliar market might ask them, and that's a lot better than brushing it off as ""man, there's too many damn kinds of rice"". it sounds like you have a pretty ""Anglo-centric"" (by the aforementioned use-case) view of prejudice."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,DOE_ZELF_NORMAAL,177,Sat Jul 11 21:20:55 2015 UTC,"Hey! You got this. Think about other new skills or life experiences you've had in the past - the first time you tried to read as a little kid, the first time you tried to drive, even the first time you tried a completely new video game. It probably felt a little overwhelming and frustrating. Changing your lifestyle for the better is going to feel similarly alien at first too. But like any new skill, you don't have to be perfect from the get-go. Instead, you need to practice as if you were learning a new sport/art/musical instrument. Make little improvements every day, and after a few months, you'll be amazed what your new normal is.  Plus, you're young. Now's the perfect time to make long term lifestyle changes. It will only get harder as your metabolism slows down. You will have a much easier time learning new ""health skills"" now, instead of waiting 5, 10, or 20 years.  Here are a few concrete suggestions:   As a 19 year old ~300 lb male, you're probably eating 2500-2900 calories a day. I saw from one of your previous posts you're worried about becoming obsessed with calorie counting, which I understand. But you'll at least need a daily calorie goal in the back of your mind (2000 calories with no exercise is a good goal). And the trick is to eat larger quantities of low calorie foods. That way your tummy will feel full, but you're taking in fewer extra calories. Eat as many carrot sticks (without ranch dip) and apple slices and no butter popcorn bags as you like - it will take you way longer to hit your calories than if you're eating candy, extra butter everything, etc.  Case in point: Look at these photos comparing what 200 calories looks like. Obviously I'm not suggesting carrot sticks taste the same as Hershey kisses, or celery is as tasty as a Snickers. But when you consider over one pound of carrots = 7 Hershey kisses, and 3 POUNDS of celery = 3/4 of one Snickers bar, you can see why eating higher volumes of low cal foods will make you more full. (Not to mention veggies have actual nutritional value.) Do you have portion control problems? Many people do. Use a sandwich plate instead of a dinner plate, and use a salad fork instead of a normal fork when you eat. It tricks your brain into thinking you're eating more than you are. Look at these two plates - they both have the same amount of food, but the second one looks like more since it takes up most of the plate. Also it takes your brain a while to register when it's full. If you eat more slowly, your brain has a chance to catch up with your stomach. You say you mostly eat microwave freezer meals. At a bare minimum, make better choices when you're buying microwave meals. Amy's Kitchen and Kashi make ~10oz meals that are around 300-400 calories each. Compare that to a Marie Calendar's pot pie at 1040 calories per pie, and Stouffer's Fettuccini Alfredo at ~650 cal per serving, and you can see there's a big caloric range in microwave dinners. Drink a glass of water every few hours - especially before a meal. It will fill up your tummy, and get your organs in a happier place. As a rule of thumb, if the food wasn't ""born"" that color, don't eat it. Strawberry pop tarts, Cheetos, Skittles... these are super high in calories with no nutritional value.   A few more things to keep in mind:    Your gut flora is probably out of whack from all the sugar you eat. It will take you a little while to repopulate it with healthier bacteria. While this happens, you may experience some discomfort or gas while your stomach gets used to eating ""real"" food again. Wait it out - it's normal, and you'll feel better after your body adjusts. You can speed along the repopulation of your good gut flora by eating foods with probiotics, like low fat live culture yogurt/kefir, sauerkraut and kimchi if you can tolerate the taste, etc. I know you're young and probably aren't flush with cash, so I won't suggest expensive activities. But obviously you need to get your body moving.  Do you live in an area with an active meetup.com community? See if there are any low impact community exercise activities you can join, like a walking group, a beginner dance group, etc. Your local YMCA may have some cheap/free community classes too. Do you have a dog? Join a dog walking group or a dog play group. Basically joining a group will help you in two ways: It's more fun to get exercise when you're not focusing on how miserable it is (i.e. running on a treadmill), and it's important that people miss you if you don't show up (positive peer pressure). That will make you want to attend more. If you can't find it in you to join a community exercise class, there are lots of beginner online videos, wii fit games, etc. I don't think solo classes are as good as group ones because positive peer pressure is a huge motivator.  However, maybe you can organize a virtual exercise class with a few other online people, and you all do the same YouTube exercise video at the same time several times a week. Then you can keep each other accountable if someone starts slacking off. You may want to talk to your doctor. I see you have some history with depression - are you on any meds that mess with your appetite and feeling of satiation? Or do your depression swings impact your appetite and your ability to control your portions? Also I'm sure you've heard this a million times, but many people find exercise eventually helps their depression. Getting the body moving releases ""happy brain chemicals.""   Good luck! And remember getting started is always the hardest. No one expects to be a perfect pianist the first time they sit down to a piano, and you shouldn't expect a perfect diet and exercise routine on the first day. But with some long term practice, you'll get where you need to be."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Yellow_giraffe,36,Sat Jul 11 22:21:17 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of really good information and tips there, but there's one thing I disagree with.   As a 19 year old ~300 lb male, you're probably eating 2500-2900 calories a day.   His TDEE alone, being completely sedentary, is estimated to be 2900. As a mostly sedentary 155lb male I'm maintaining at 2500-2900/day. To get to 300 lbs he's probably eating more like 4000+ honestly. If he cuts down to 2000/day he'd probably lose more than 2lb/week in the beginning(which is acceptable at his size). But if that's too drastic of a change for him right off the bat, he could probably start a little higher and still lose weight."

However, I'd argue it's worth retraining one's tastebuds to be ok with ""bland"" foods that aren't coated in extra salt and calories.   I ate pure crap in college - mostly Ramen and off-brand EZ Mac. When I graduated and could afford ""real"" food for the first time, I kinda hated it at first. My palate was so used to simple carbohydrates and salt, it meant that fresh fruits, veggies, and non-processed chicken tasted very bland. However, after my tastebuds (and digestive system) adjusted to higher quality foods, I definitely came to prefer the lower salt, higher nutrient foods.   But again, it's all about eventually reaching health and nutrition goals. Even small improvements will add up over time, and there's no benefit in someone jumping straight from junk food to raw kale if it's not sustainable."

That's my favorite way to make a big batch of food with little effort.    Easiest recipe ever (and quite healthy) is a jar of your favorite salsa and a big pack of either boneless chicken breasts or thighs. Toss them in the slow cooker for a few hours (3-6 on low pending how much meat you buy). Then add the chicken in salads, wraps, sammiches and rice bowls. It's so effortlessly flavorful.  Add veggies to your taste. Or guac! (The cheat to guacamole is two avocados and a jar of Pace. Not a perfect recipe but its lazy and better than the prepacked stuff).    Just don't get overwhelmed. You don't need a recipe that has 27 ingredients and a ton of prep. Just keep taking steps in the right direction.    Onceamonthmeals.com and budgetbytes.com are my recipe inspirations. Don't be afraid to adjust to your own taste or ask for more help with individual recipes."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Forget_Regret,7,Sat Jul 11 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"Just stop those freezer meals!   The better advice is to just read the labels & choose wiser + track nutrition. You can still enjoy those things in moderation.  I lost a bunch of weight when I added frozen meals to my nutrition plan. You just gotta be picky with which ones you select. I particularly like this one because of the low calories & satiety it offered me. I love to cook most of the time, but having these in the freezer as an option for a $1.49 meal was a saver on work days that ran over 14 hours."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,killingxspree,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:47:44 2015 UTC,"I just cooked 40 pounds of pulled pork for my sister-in-law's wedding reception. I had four crocks going for over 12 hours for each pork shoulder. If you like pulled pork get a nice 8-10 pound pork shoulder,  season it and throw it in on low until the internal temp gets to 190. Then, foil it, wrap it in a towel, place it into a cooler with no ice and let it sit for a few hours. After that, shred it and eat it.   It sounds like an odd method, but I also do competitive BBQ and smoking ribs and pork butt are pretty much second nature to me. The cooler method is known as a faux cambro and makes a huge difference when shredding the meat. You loose a bit of bark, but you retain a ton of moisture in the meat.  Here's the last shoulder I smoked right out of the smoker prior to wrapping (Smoked for 10 hours): http://i.imgur.com/azT7iU0.jpg  And now here's the same shoulder two hours later out of the cooler: http://i.imgur.com/245ipMU.jpg  As you can see there's just a bit of liquid in there meaning much more in the meat itself.  Anyways, sorry for rambling, but I'd definitely recommend pulled pork for a slow cooker. Try the faux cambro method and see if you can tell a difference in moisture and texture. Plus you'll have a lot of meat for tacos, sandwiches, salads, omelettes, etc.  :)"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,BelaAnn,130,Sun Jul 12 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"This is what I do. I'm not very good at cooking, and I'm pretty broke.  For breakfast, I have eggs. I might have toast, but usually just eggs. Eggs are your new best friends. Start by learning how to scramble them (Stir it up with a fork, add a little milk or water, then slap it in a frying pan). Move on to over-easy (my personal favorite), or boiled. Eggs are a diverse breakfast food, and they're usually only about 70 calories per egg, and they fill you the fuck up. Add some spinach maybe, or tomatoes. Who knows. The best part? They're like 3$ a carton. That's 5-6 meals assuming 2-3 eggs a meal for only three dollars. Super cheap.  For lunch I have a sandwich. Find a poultry lunchmeat you can tolerate. Have you looked yet? Yep, it's all awful. Personally I like smoked turkey, and by like I mean I don't hate it. Now grab some bread and add your new eating healthy secret weapon - Hot sauce. I'm partial to syracha and mustard. Now that your flavor-hiding condiments are applied, the next step to your lunch is to just slap as many veggies as you can hold inbetween the meat and the remaining slice of bread. Zucchinis, tomatoes, pickles, anything that you can slice up and put in there. Each vegetable will run you about 1 dollar per from a grocery store, and as long as you store it correctly they'll last you a good 5-10 sandwiches. Bread is about 2$ a loaf, veggies are 1$ each, and lunchmeat is anywhere from $2-5.   For dinner, I mix it up and treat myself. I buy a canned progresso soup thing. They're about $2 each, and they have all sorts of flavors. Super easy to cook too. How do I cook it you ask? You put a pot on the stove, open the can, dump the can into the pot and stir it once every few minutes until it's warm enough and then eat it. They have tons of flavors, they're incredibly filling, and ridiculously cheap and easy to make.   The drawbacks of this diet are that it's pretty high in salt, but the benefits are that it's designed by a former fatass (me) who likes to feel full as fuck after he's done eating. It's really cheap, and low on calories. Good luck."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,ilikesmallbreasts,76,Sat Jul 11 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"People may bash on your last suggestion, but it's a good start in the right direction.    Next step after that is investing in a crock pot (or just use a good pan if you already have one, but our stove sucks). Homemade soups are delicious and underrated. You can make them to your taste and it's all your essentials in one bowl.    Kudos to you for being realistic though. It took me a couple years to start cooking my food from scratch. Sometimes I forgot the transition that it took.    By the way, to the OP, budgetbytes.com is a cool place to start. The recipes are anywhere from beginner to intermediate, affordable and delicious."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Forget_Regret,11,Sun Jul 12 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"I eat sandwiches all the time for lunch, so I think your little harsh on those. They're just too many ways to prepare them, too many things to prepare them with. It's all about your approach. Personally I like fresh baked bread made with whole grains, and fresh deli meat. Combined with an assortment of sauces. And I'm obsessed with my panini maker, puts Subway to shame."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Mompy,8,Sat Jul 11 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"It's been a while, but in my experience, it is surprisingly 'okay.' It comes in maybe quarter or larger size chunks generally and is really easy to plop into a stew or soup last minute. And you can sort of crumble it as needed - pretty tender.  You're not gonna want to have it on its own obviously - it will never be like a baked/grilled chicken breast."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,LususV,9,Sat Jul 11 14:18:54 2015 UTC,"Make a list of rules about your diet, add one a week. Start with just one big goal, then add little things. My weight has never been as bad as yours but when I slip into bad habits this approach works well for me as I have extremely poor discipline when I try to change through cold turkeying.  Start by saying ""I'm not going to eat more than one microwaved meal a day"". Write it somewhere prominent. Eventually, when you've learned to live without 2, you can move to 0. Baby steps.   You're so young you have plenty of time to make a change and live a full life. It's great that you've decided to turn things around this early- many leave it too late.  ALSO some actual diet advice: Adding onto other posts about eggs; a boiled egg sliced up on a leafy salad completely eliminates the need for dressing.  Instead of whatever you eat for breakfast, get a bag of oatmeal, the kind you can cook with just water, and use mixed fruit & nuts (or a banana) for flavour. Extremely cheap, very customisable. A really good first step.  Broccoli. Steam it. Try to eat two broccolis a week. Just put some broccoli on the side of all your dinners. It tastes fantastic, goes with almost anything and will make you feel great.  Good luck!"

I've found that prepping is the key to me eating healthy. I will have veggies all cut up and ready for snacking (typically with hummus) or fruit made in a fruit salad, etc. Another thing I've recently statted doing is making mason jar salads. There are tons of varieties and you can basically add or take out anything you don't like. There's a black bean and salsa one that's absolutely delicious an very filling. Another thing to try is perhaps egg bake muffins (I don't know the proper term). Basically scramble some eggs, put any veggies you want in there, and put them in a muffin tin and bake!   I've found that eating many smaller meals throughout the day has helped me to lose weight. I will have lots of snacks and things with me throughout the day...which is weird because I feel like I am always eating (since I basically am) and am always full even though I am losing weight.  I hope that helps!"

All the veg was stuff that I had to get rid of anyway. So a great way of cleaning out the fridge. 2-4 of those for breakfast with stich is was perfect!  Edit: srichia, not stich. Stupid mobile."

Figure out what you burn off on an average day,  then read everythig  on the nutrition of what you eat,  and make sure you keep it under the number.    Personally 90 percent t of my meals are brown rice,  corn,  black beans,  plus a protein usually chicken.  Look into spices as this is how you can get you flavor.  I am a huge fan of cumin paprika crushed red pepper and garlic powder.   The best thing to do is start a food journal,  and to cut out the frozen dinners like you plan,  add water and start going for a walk/keep yourself busy any time you feel like you want to eat.  If thst doesn't work,  start eating just plain lettuce when you get hungry.   That's just basics,  if you have more questions let me know as I was the exact same.

How good the result is will depend on how well you season everything.  A pretty large percentage of my meals are like this:   Rice, quinoa, or pasta. Protein. Vegetables. Seasoning.   Typically the carb and protein will be cooked separately, and the vegetables will be either cooked separately or with the protein (if the time/method are compatible). Everything gets mixed together then portioned into tupperware. I aim for about 4-5 meals per batch, twice a week."

I set the race as a goal I wanted to meet in 6 months. Anyway I drank and still drink a Whey Protein Shake for breakfast as a low calorie meal replacement. For lunch I eat a salad consisting of all spinach and whatever other veggies I like (olives, tomato, avocado, etc.) and light dressings. then I eat chicken brown rice and broccoli for dinner like mentioned before. I'm a lot shorter than you I'm like 5'11"" but my calorie goal for the day was only 1500. Which doesn't sound like much. At first id get hungry between breakfast and lunch but eventually I stopped craving junk and I stopped feeling hungry. I also ate the calories I burned from working out. You could probably eat 2000 calories and still get decent results. I was losing 2-5 lbs a week.   My work out involved lifting at first. You know just minor weights lots of reps but I stopped lifting due to sore muscles. I hated feeling sore while doing cardio. So all I focused on was cardio. Which sounds worse than it is as well. I ran 3-4 times a week depending on how I was feeling on my rest days. I worked mostly on building endurance. When I was 280 I did interval training, jog 30 secs then walk a min for like 20 mins. As I started losing weight and gaining endurance I phased out the walking and just tried jogging. Eventually I could jog a mile then I kept increasing the distance by a .5/mile every few runs.   I suggest weighing yourself at least once a week for motivation or to fix anything that might be causing you to gain instead of lose. And just stay motivated and avoid the pop and sugary snacks.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,DomSchu,2,Sun Jul 12 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"Haha well noting special,  usually just that,  I take a pan I'll cook whatever seasoned meat I'm having,  usually cumin paprika onion powder garlic powder and crushed red pepper.  After the meats mostly cooked I'll take my cooked beans corn and rice and throw them into pan together and let the rice beans and corn absorb the flavor from cooking.  After that I sometime throw it in a tortilla,  or mix it with lettuce and tomato,  hot sauce sour cream or Tazahiki sauce,  and I'll eat the burrito or just go at it with a fork/spoon.   I'm not sure what you qualify as a good meal though,  as this has everything I need,  veggies starch and a protein/meat,  I just mix em together as the flavors blend well together.

I don't eat strict paleo, it just isn't financially possible, and it can get REALLY boring if you don't have the time or skill to make complicated things.  So, I have adapted my own diet. It takes a lot of the principles of paleo, and builds on them. I've seen someone mention eggs. Absolutely. You can do so much with eggs. When I scramble my eggs, I just scramble them. I don't add milk or water. 2,3,4 eggs and you're good. I often just salt and pepper them and they're good. But, I have also added things to them. One of my favorites is salsa. I buy Newman's Own Salsa. It's delicious, adds a small amount of heat, and is 10 calories a serving, which is plenty to add flavor to eggs. (It's worth noting that it is NEVER even close to what it costs on Amazon. I get it at my local Walmart.) Once a week, I will treat myself and make bacon and eggs, with toast. Don't overdo it on the butter or bacon.  While on the subject of bacon, a good bacon is a fantastic way to eat. It has a lot of protein and it can add good flavor to anything.   For breakfast, I'll have one of a few things. Greek yogurt. Good greek yogurt can be super satisfying. I buy Fage 0%, the little cups with some fruit. Awesome. I also like to eat Quaker Instant Protein Oatmean, but that might not be easy since you have a peanut allergy and I think all those things are processed with machinery that also processes some nuts. Check it out though. It's a decent amount of calories and the carbs will help get you to lunch.  For lunch, I do meal prep and I make some chicken breasts for my lunch at work. I bake, grill, or simply pan fry in a little olive oil. Chicken is great. Low fat, high protein, and EXTREMELY versatile. You can season it and use it just about however you want. And it doesn't reheat too bad. Learn to make good chicken. When it comes to sides for lunch, I sometimes steam broccoli and throw it in the fridge. I also eat some rice. Not a ton, but a single serving of brown rice. If I'm feeling really healthy, I'll grab a spring mix salad with a light vinaigrette. A hard boiled egg is also a good addition. And also, a kosher dill pickle. 10 calories and oddly satisfying. My method for hard boiled eggs is super easy, and they come out great every time. put eggs in a pot and fill it with cold water just until they're submerged. Put a lid on it and put it on high heat. As soon as it's come to a very vigorous boil, turn off the heat and leave on burner for 10-12 minutes. Then remove from the boiler. Then, I soak them in ice water and peel them right away.   Dinner is often a toss up. Sometimes it's beef. A lean, good cut. Or even a hamburger on the grill with no bun (or with a bun if I'm having a rough day.) Stir fry is a personal favorite of mine. Some veggies (broccoli, snow peas, carrots, green bell pepper; there are a lot of awesome simple recipes out there) and chicken, tossed in a small amount of teriyaki and you're good. If you're making just chicken, beef, or pork and need a side, don't be afraid of steamer bags of veggies. They keep a while, they're usually cheap, and they're just veggies that you can make very easily in the microwave.  As for snacks, a small amount of organic jerky or fresh veggies. I also love cottage cheese, so I get the little single serving cups of those. Again, yogurt can be a life saver here. I also keep some ice cream in my freezer. Specifically, Blue Bunny makes these little ice cream cones. They aren't healthy, but they're small, 170 calories, and when you are craving something, I've found that it's often better to just eat that one thing than to eat a dozen other things trying to satisfy a craving.  Also, if you're not already doing it, count calories. I use MyFitnessPal and it helps me keep on track. And, exercise. If you can afford it, financially and physically, do it. Whether it's walking a mile every day, getting on a treadmill, or going to the gym. I personally do crossfit 4-5 days a week, and, while still obese at 6' 250lbs, I feel like I'm healthier and in better shape than I have been my entire life.  If you have any specific questions, you can PM me. I'm not a nutritionist or an expert by any stretch of the word, but I've learned quite a lot in the last 6 months since I've started exercising and dieting. If I've learned anything, it's that it isn't simply a diet. It's a lifestyle change. You've already made a huge step by acknowledging that you have to do something. You can do anything if you try. Good luck."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,randoh12,3,Sat Jul 11 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"Throw out all the instant meals, crips, chocolate, and all other crap. It's expensive and bad for you.   Breakfast: Scrambled or poached egg, avocado, toast or spinach.  Scrambled eggs are easy to make, just melt some butter in a saucepan then throw 2-3 whisked eggs in then keep stirring until it's almost cooked, it will finish cooking while you serve it.  Lunch: Sandwich, get some thinly sliced meat from a butcher and fill it with salad, tomatoes etc.  Dinner: Roast veggies and chorizo is my favourite.  The more varied the veggies the better. Sweet potato, peppers, onions, courgettes, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc.   Drink lots of water, always have some within sight. If you get a little peckish between meals, have some fruit. An apple, banana, handful of cherries, anything other than junk food.   Good luck!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,EnjoyableBleach,3,Sat Jul 11 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"First off, good for you for taking charge!  The important thing is to just eat real food. Anything processed, sugary, or filled with preservatives, gone. Easy mac, chef boyardee, chips, etc. None of that. Don't even tempt yourself.  I would definitely start with eating lean meats. Chicken, ground beef, etc. Get a lot of veggies. Trader Joe's has a great selection of frozen veggies and you can buy large bags of frozen chicken, defrost one or two at a time, and then marinade them however you like. You can also just buy fresh veggies and sauté them in a pan with a little bit of olive oil and whatever spices you want. You literally cannot undercook vegetables. I eat bell peppers raw.  You also should be drinking lots of water. Go to Target or a sporting goods store and buy a liter-sized Nalgene. Drink four of those a day. You will spend a lot of time peeing, but that is your body flushing out all the crap it's trying to get rid of.  Above all, keep it up! It won't happen overnight, but I commend you for starting a healthy lifestyle."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,DChomey2013,3,Sat Jul 11 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"So first, make sure you make your environment work for you, change out your kitchen to replace stuff like chips and cookies to fruits and veggies.  I dont know how comfortable you are with cooking, but with chicken, frozen veggies, and whatever spices you like, you can fit whatever your in the mood for. I usually do chicken breasts, but whole chicken is usually a pretty good bang for your buck.  The last thing i would recommend is to check out nerdfitness.com  Lots of good resources there to help and a great community."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,wvurower,3,Sun Jul 12 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"What I do is make my own frozen meals. Buy about 3lbs of chicken breast or chicken tenderloins, 3lbs of broccoli, a bag of brown rice, and 8 or so of these. Cook all the chicken up in the oven and steam all of the broccoli while your rice is cooking. Then you just portion everything up equally into your containers and freeze the ones you don't you will use within 4 days or so. You can take them out of the freezer the day before you plan on eating them, or just nuke them from frozen. You can cover it in hot sauce, soy sauce, or make bbq chicken. You can always substitute chicken for lean ground beef or tuna. You can add other veggies like peppers, asparagus, mushrooms, or substitute rice for sweet potatoes. Make sure you always have meals prepared and ready to go, because once your hungry its usually pretty hard to prep a healthy meal. That's why I usually have some Lean Cuisines in the freezer as a backup.  Other than just focusing on eating healthy, you mainly need to focus on how many calories a day you are eating. I calculated here that if you want to lose 100 lbs by July next year you will need to eat around 1900 calories a day. So if in each contain you put half a chicken breast (140 calories) 1 cup of brown rice (200 calories) and 1 cup of broccoli (50 calories) just note that each container will be about 400 calories.  Stick to drinking water only. Fruit juice may seem healthy but its actually loaded with calories and sugar. You are much better off eating your fruit or making smoothies with spinach/mixed berries/bananas or whatever fruits and veggies you prefer.   For breakfast stick to eggs (cooked with olive oil not butter) and oatmeal and some fruit if you like. I usually just make one of those smoothies and hold off until lunch.  Besides just altering your diet, you could amplify your results by using a community gym or getting a gym membership and lifting some weights/doing cardio for an hour or so 3 times a week."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Vexation,3,Sat Jul 11 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"Ive just started getting into salads which i take to work and its been working out amazingly so far. I never though a salad could get me so full and actually taste good. What i do is on Sunday nights get 5 mason jars. Start with dressing so its sitting on the bottom of the jar. Then get all the veggies you have out and chop them up. Tomatoes carrots celery. The layer on top of the dressing will be ""hard"" veggies that i just listed or similar. Next you can add corn, avocado cubes, mushrooms, zucchini etc. Then you need to add the part that will fill you up. So sliced hardboiled eggs, beans, pasta, quinoa, rice, chicken (sometimes i use diced up chicken nuggets) etc. Then you pick a leafy green (lettuce spinach kale) and stuff as much as you can in the remaining space. When its time you eat you dump it all out on a plate and chow down. It's surprisingly good and its really easy since you can make 5 or more meals in one go. The mason jars keep it all pretty fresh and the layering makes a pretty big difference (no mixing of wet and dry ingedients) and when you dump it all out it falls into a perfectly delicious mixture and it looks appetizing."

Focusing on a raw fruit and healthy cereal for breakfast will be great. Focusing on vegetables and brown rice/noodles for an evening meal is also good. Dont eat anything 5 hours before your bedtime. Follow these guidelines, and i promise you will not only lose fat but you will reinvigorate your organ tissues as well. If you want to take a daily multi-vitamin to play it safe so be it.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,oddlyshapedhuman,2,Sat Jul 11 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"Your comment deserves more up votes.  This is the best advice on this post.  Just eating as much whole plant foods as you want will keep you satiated and full while dropping the weight effortlessly.  Also, not eating a few hours before bedtime is a great tip.  I used to eat right before going to bed and then first thing in the morning.  Now I am done eating by 6-7 and don't eat again until 8-9.  Doing this I was able to lose the last of my puffiness and now that I've gotten into the habit of it I don't even get hungry during that fasting time."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,JimmyJonCricket,9,Sat Jul 11 21:54:47 2015 UTC,Stir fry really started me cooking. A pound of raw chicken tenders cut into hunks and a bag of frozen veggies can last a while. Cut the chicken into hunks and cook with some sauce like teriyaki. Add vegetables. Easy and good.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,carolina8383,3,Sun Jul 12 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yes!! I've been living on stir fry. So easy, so quick, and if you load it up with 9/10 frozen veggies to 1/10 saucy meat it turns it into a ten minute zero effort filling low cal dish. They sell pre packaged str fry beef or pre portioned chicken is another very easy way to get healthy protein.   Just watch out on stir fry sauces- often just salty sugar goop, although I do love me a little bit of Teriyaki."

One thing that I've started to really like and appreciate is flax seed. It's not a meal, but it can help regulate your digestive system, it's full of good stuff (antioxidants, fiber, omega-3s) and most importantly it helps keep you full. What I do is I mix somewhere between 1-4 tablespoons with a tall glass of water, chug it down, and then fill the glass with water again and drink. I do this usually once a day, usually between meals, and it has helped so much. You may end up not liking it, but it's worth a try since it's definitely easy, healthy, and relatively inexpensive."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,roguexbarbie,2,Sun Jul 12 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"you can also just mix the flax into something else, like your oatmeal, or something.  but don't get pre-ground flax- grind it fresh for the best results.  a cheap coffee grinder or food processor will work."

I like the egg approach though that someone mentioned. But if you do a green smoothie it's pretty cheap and filling. You will need a good blender though.  The trick is to add fruit AND veggies so you get the benefit of both.

You can search the huge database of food, or scan the Barcode on the food with your phone, or make your own food entry and set custom values for the nutrition values. It's way too easy to use and helpful. It comes as an app and you can use its website.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,DarkDubzs,2,Sat Jul 11 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"I was once in the 250+ club. It was not a good time for me. Congratulations on making this important life decision. You will not regret it.  First Things First   Do not try to change everything at once. Take small steps, changing one thing at a time, to ease into a lifestyle that you can maintain and enjoy. Avoid fad diets and other things. You need a permanent lifestyle change if you want to avoid an early death, not a weight-loss plan. Never discount the power of pulses and legumes. They are protein powerhouses that satisfy your hunger, are cheap, and low in fat. Western society has an impulse toward meats, but meat is expensive and many are higher in fat (especially given how they are prepared). Your life doesn't have to be bland and tasteless just because it's healthy. Many store-bought sauces and prepared meals are loaded with empty calories from corn syrup and other refined sugars. These things WON'T satisfy you and will increase your calorie intake. Where possible, use spices to give your foods life. If you do need a sauce, make your own with ingredients you can buy in any grocery store. Beware the hidden fats and calories in seemingly healthy foods: cream and sugar in coffee, dressings on salads, alcohol, etc. These things CAN impact your weight. As much as possible, prepare things in advance. You'll never resort to takeout and frozen meals when you have delicious, home-made food that just needs to be popped in the microwave for a few minutes. Most things last days in the fridge and months in the freezer. Watch your portion sizes. Portion sizes in North America have been growing over the decades, and we tend to not understand what a serving actually is. http://blog.massivehealth.com/infographics/Portion-Distortion/ Google is your friend. If you don't know how to make something, or want to make a dish you do know a bit healthier, look it up online!   Meal Ideas   Breakfast: Should be a well-rounded meal with some carbs, protein, fats, etc. You'll need something that satiates your hunger until lunch. Avoid high-fat things (that's not what you're going for), and fat-free things (it won't keep you feeling full). I eat a cup of medium-fat yogurt (half plain and half vanilla, mixed together), 1/3-cup or 1/2-cup of oats, and 1-cup of defrosted frozen fruit (strawberries, blueberries, mangos, whatever). Feel free to add a few nuts or seeds (if you can eat them) to the equation to get some healthy fats in there. If that sounds good to you, great! If not, find something that does and still meets those requirements. I'm able to eat this every day because I love it, not because I force myself to. Lunch: Make this your main meal of the day so your body has all day to burn off calories. You want another good mix: some carbs, protein, and vegetables. Home-made stir fries with rice. Chicken with oven-roasted potatoes and vegetables. Brown rice and lentils with vegetables. A single turkey sandwich on whole-grain bread with cut-up vegetables on the side. Dinner: Eat a satisfying but slightly smaller dinner. Stews, soups, leftovers--whatever you like. Spaghetti with meat sauce, but use whole-grain spaghetti, lots of tomato sauce and spices, and replace ground beef with ground chicken or turkey. Healthy chili. Etc. Snacks are OK, but plan them in advance so you aren't out buying things like donuts or milkshakes. Make your own little snack packs and put them in plastic containers you can bring to work. Fruit. Cut-up vegetables. Deserts are also OK, but again, watch your portion sizes and make healthy choices. Desert shouldn't be a giant piece of chocolate cake with 3 scoops of ice cream. A couple of pieces of dark chocolate, or some watermelon, or a single scoop of frozen yogurt. This qualifies as desert and doubles as a nice palette cleanser to signal the end of the meal. It'll also make you feel like you aren't starving yourself of sugars and sweets.   Play with your portion sizes until you know what your body needs. You should ideally go through a hungry-satisfied phase multiple times times each day. You should NOT experience a feeling of ""fullness"", especially uncomfortable fullness. That means you're overeating. You also shouldn't feel like you're ""starving"", waiting for your next meal. That means you're under-eating or not meeting your nutritional needs, and that'll come back to bite you with binging and weight gain.  Hope that helps!  Edit: formatting."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,stoicphilosopher,2,Sat Jul 11 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"I like to make a breakfast bake with a dozen eggs, a tube of sausage and a bag of frozen broccoli.   Cook up the sausage in a pan, I like turkey breakfast sausage. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a little milk, pepper and whatever other non-salt seasonings you may like, beat with a whisk or fork.   Spread the cooked sausage out in a 9x12 rectangular Pyrex baking dish, add frozen broccoli and pour eggs on top. You can add cheese if you want but that's not the healthiest. Stir a bit with a fork to make sure everything is covered with egg.   Bake uncovered in 375 oven for at least 30 minutes. I usually cook mine a bit more because I like crispy brown edges.   Cut into 6 pieces and you've got breakfast for almost the entire week. You can use ham or bacon in place of the sausage if you want to switch it up. Also use spinach, green onions, etc. instead of broccoli.   You can freeze the eggs squares if you don't want to eat the same things for 6 days in a row.   For lunch and dinner I would bake chicken breasts with a little olive oil, balsamic vinegar and Rosemary and steam whatever veggie was on sale that week. Portion it out and you've got a few meals.   Ground turkey with zucchini is also good. I cook up the turkey with some Italian seasoning and pepper, add chopped zucchini and squash. Adding chopped or dried onion is good for adding flavor. Eat with brown rice or on its own. Also can last for quite a few meals.   I actually made a pinterest account just to look for healthy, cheap, easy meals. No one knows about it, it's not hooked up to my FB. It is strictly for finding and storing recipes."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Logan_Chicago,3,Sat Jul 11 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"An Open Letter To A Younger Me:  A doctor just told me, legitimately, that I will die soon if I don't change my life.   Of course, Doctors have been tell me that since I was younger than you. But I have finally reached that truly dangerous borderline. Diabetes. I don't have it yet. But it's starting.   There are so many side effects to my lifestyle, it's insane that I haven't changed yet. Were I to give you details, you would be embarrassed and shocked all at once. Suffice it to say, there is truly a gun to my head now. I might have to go on diabetes meds soon. That, for me, is the final border I refuse to cross.  A grand total of 7 days ago, a confluence of events meant it was time. I had been putting it off, figuring I was in my last hurrah, and in a way, I was. So I am no expert. But I am just starting, just like you. Here is what I have learned in almost no time at all.   -I hate to exercise. So I found a low impact exercise I have never considered before. Walking. So stupid, you can't believe it. But, being overweight, I hate heat. And I have to urinate a lot. So I always thought walking around my neighborhood wasn't in the cards. Idiot. I'm an idiot. The grand gigantic change I had to make is to get out of bed at a normal, adult hour. Because it's cooler in the morning. As for the peeing problem, well, I have had to get over my pride and pee behind a few trees. But there are also port-a-potties and bathrooms in parks. So I make the bathrooms part of my walk. Duh. My body is overjoyed. I always thought I had to go to a stupid gym, which I hate, or buy fancy shoes, or blah blah blah. I have wasted twenty of the best years of my LIFE thinking I can't do this.   -My sister, who had no idea my doctor just told me I was basically screwed, sent me a Fitbit Charge HR in the mail. To be honest, I find the culture of health and fitness absolutely obnoxious. I don't think I'm wrong about that, but it's been holding me back. I see people with their water bottles and their fluorescent workout clothes, and I don't see a healthy person. I just wonder who they're trying to impress. That kind of negativity has also been an obstacle, mentally, but that's a different discussion altogether. So when my sister sent me the Fitbit, I had the same thought you have: ""I don't want to be obsessive about calories."" What I have found is that counting calories isn't weird. It's actually responsible, and lots of healthy people do it in a non-precise, sort of rounding-up kind of way that is effective. And that's what the Fitbit has been helping me with. Keeping track of my calories, and my activity level. It's easy to use. If you get one, be aware that it overestimates activity levels a bit, but it's very good at helping you ingest appropriate calories in a day.   And that's all I have been doing. Walking, and eating a certain amount of calories. I'm still eating some bad stuff. And I revel in it when I do. But the feeling of deciding to have a Twinkee because it fits in to my day, and not having to feel guilty about it is pretty stupendous. This has pushed me to find filling foods that are low-calorie options. For instance, I bought a popcorn popper on Amazon for sixteen bucks that pops popcorn (a low cal, cheap snack) using only hot air. Spaghetti squash, butternut squash, celery. Oh, and make ranch dressing with Greek Yogurt. Hidden Valley even has little packets that you just pour into greek yogurt and it tastes exactly the same way.   Oh, and for breakfast, I eat the peanut butter oatmeal that the guy on Obese To Beast talks about. That works as a good solid breakfast that gets me off to a good start.   Also: don't get crazy. Your body is used to a certain bad diet. Fasting or freaking out and going low-cal might put your body into a starvation pattern that could cause your body to stop burning fat. So eating a better balance of good things will turn on the right switches. It has for me.  What I was unbelievably shocked by is how just walking and counting calories has done to my body in seven days. The transformation is...I mean. I'm genuinely embarrassed it has taken me this long. I am only at the beginning, and I do not doubt that my results are going to slow down and get much more difficult in the coming weeks. But I'm okay with it. I'm ready for it.   And I want you to have the best twenty years of your life. 20 to 40 years old, that's your prime. I have had an excellent life. I have done a lot, and have achieved some true dreams. But it all might have been better and more productive if I had done what you are about to do at your age.  Don't wait for the hangman. Walk, son. Get up and walk in the cool morning air. Count your calories. I am limiting myself to 2400 right now, and that is a surprisingly satisfying number. I thought I was going to be hungry all the time. I'm not. I'm working this through, and I feel good about something I'm doing for the first time in ages.   I feel a true sense of regret under it all. My heart is breaking a little bit, knowing that, for instance, looking at my resting heartbeat (via Fitbit) and seeing that my resting heartrate is higher than a healthy person's...I have been stealing my own heartbeats from myself. We only all get so many. Keep that in mind. Every day you (we) spend unhealthy and overweight, you are losing seconds.   The final thought I want to leave you with, and this is counter-intuitive in this day and age of social media and sharing, and I am breaking my own rule in speaking to you, but...try to keep what you're doing to yourself. Don't talk about it. Somehow, in the past, all of my efforts in this regard have been undermined by me talking to people about ""wanting to lose weight"". Keeping it to myself has caused me to stick to this in this short period in a way that I never have. I am filled with hope for the first time in a very long time. I only hope it isn't too late. If you look at my limited history on Reddit, you will see that not long ago, I was posting about these problems...and I fell back into my own horrible habits almost immediately. Asking for help is important. Just remember to keep the discussion productive, and not about emotional support. You have it within you to do this. And learning self-reliance is, so far for me, the key to getting going.  Don't be me. Be you, and truly fight this demon now."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,IAmValenTelos,2,Sat Jul 11 22:46:46 2015 UTC,I cut out process foods and cut out as much sugar as possible to help me lose weight and I exercise like swimming and walking to actually feel better both mentally and physically. Doing just one of the two wasn't working for me.  Stop eating stuff that comes from factory and eat stuff that comes off a farm or isn't so heavily processed. Cut out as much of the processed foods and sugars as possible. Sugar is in almost everything and process foods hide lots of sugar in their labeling. Even sugar substitutes are bad and recent studies say they mess up gut bacteria.    “Fed Up” was the documentary that really got me thinking about what I was eating and what I should be eating.  I follow a Vegetarian Asian like food pyramid diet  I eat a lot of rice I buy in bulk and cook in a rice cooker that I cook a few times a week and package up for other days.  There are dozens and dozens of ways to make rice dishes with various ingredients spices and vegetables. I drink a lot of water and sometimes I put frozen fruits in the water for something different.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,SecondVoyage,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party OP, but I hope you read this anyway. The most important thing about losing weight is portion control. It will be pretty much impossible to have a caloric deficit if you don't control your portions. Normal healthy sized portions are way smaller than the average American is used to, so you will probably feel hungry after you eat them for awhile, but eventually your stomach (the stomach itself, not your abdomen) will shrink and a normal sized portion will fill you up. An easy way to control your portions is to only have one serving of things. This also makes it easy to track what you eat, which brings me to my next point: it is essential to track your calories for a few months until you can reach the point where you can tell if you are eating the right amount or too much just on the fly. Set a caloric goal and use something to track it. My fitness pal is great for this. Third, exercise some. You don't need to exercise a lot. 2 hours of moderate cardio a week is enough to get all the health benefits of exercise, but it might not be enough to tackle your obesity. I like to get about 30 minutes of cardio per day in the mornings before I get started with the day. I find this helps me feel energized, and it might for you too. I like to do 4-5 days of cardio and 2-3 days of yoga per week. Just a brisk walk is enough for cardio, but I mix it up as much as I can to keep things interesting. This is enough exercise for health. I track my cardio with fitbit and sync it to myfitnesspal.  If you wanna be sexy too, add three days of lifting in addition to the other things. Too look sexy, you need to do high reps at moderate weight. To get strong you need to do low reps at high strength. To feel good do high reps at low weight. Finally, if you have a bad day or a bad week, you need can't give up on being healthy. You need to get right back on track for the next day. The same thing applies for a bad decision early in the day. Just because you ate mcdonalds for lunch doesn't mean you should eat McDonald's for dinner to ""because your day is shot."" If you have a bad lunch or breakfast, either eat normally or light for the other meals in the day. This is the definition of moderation. I hope some of this advice helped.   Ps, I'm on mobile. Sorry for the lack of paragraphs."

I lost 50lbs over the last 6 months, you're life is going to improve so much. Not a day goes by where I don't think, ""wow I'm glad I'm not fat anymore, this is so much easier""  Starting out you're still gonna get to eat a lot and lose weight, which is great. My advice is plan your diet initially around how much protein you get, more is better. It will force you to eat healthier foods.   You absolutely have this man, don't ever give up and don't ever look back. Your gonna feel better and be happier then you ever were before."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,crapartist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"I am no expert but in my last few years of learning to cook for myself this what I've discovered...  When cooking and buying groceries, start with a vegetable base.  This doesn't mean going full vegetarian.  Rather than basing a meal around a meat, try to figure out what protien or grain you can add to the vegetable.  Good veggies to have: carrots, kale, spinach, zuchinni, mushrooms; get 'em canned, fresh or frozen  Good protiens: grilled chicken, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts quinoa; buy bulk or on sale when you can  Good grains: any rice ever, whole grain or egg noodle pasta, whole grain bread or flatbread  Healthy food ideas -Stir fry with a little soy sauce and garlic, sesame oil goes a long way in flavor.  Pick your veggies, add a protien. -Fried cabbage sauted in red wine.  I like to add tomatoes, sometimes a little sausage, and have lentils on the side. -Kale n' egg sandwiches.  Kale is good sauted with a little butter or butter substitute, fry or boil an egg, put on good bread with a little bit of cheese. -Salads with apples, eggs, nuts, and chicken or shrimp is bomb. -Quiche.  Basically eggs, milk, and whatever veggies or extra protein you like.  I made one tonight with a motherfucking SALMON.  Don't get too caught up on staying away from everything with fat.  A little bit of butter or a tiny bit of cream here and there for flavor is fine.  Stay away from dishes or sauces primarily composed of these things.  Try subbing vinaigrette for cream dressings and olive oil for butter when possible.  When eating meat, limit your portions and maybe even the amount per day.  Buy high quality shit and make a pact with yourself to stay away from cheap, filler-filled meat from pre-packaged meals and fast food restaurants.  They make you bloated and it sucks to eat anyways.  If you have to give into an urge to eat a lot of something, try nuts or avocados.  These things are filling, have the good fats which you are craving, while being low on all the nasty stuff.  Add salt, and drink lots of water to help curb cravings as well.  Avoid super sugary treats and sodas.  Learn to eat fruit, fresh or canned to help curb these cravings.  When you do have a piece of cake or candy, try to keep it as small as a couple bites.  Stay away from it altogether if its too hard to not gorge.  Good luck!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,doodoodleylou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:57:18 2015 UTC,The first step for me was cutting out liquid calories.  That's anything you drink so no sodas or that kind of stuff. Lots of water and then mild cardio to get started. You've gotta build slowly so you can create habits and routines that will last
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Richer_Times,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"Cut the sugar, you don't need desert, and will come to not want it.   Cook meals, you will realize you can do better then fast food at everything, even with a low skill level. Incorporate veggies as much as you can. You don't need as much protein as you think you do. You will feel way better making you're meals, low protein, high veggies. I like having a decent piece of steak with a salad packed with veggies and lite dressing. Or make tacos where you have a heavy pico blend, light meat and cojita cheese, shredded cheese is fucked.   Make your own burgers, thin. Add Roman lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and an actual cheese. Make the veggies the brunt of what you're eating. Your body will love you for this, and you will break even monetarily in most situations. Its just a matter of doing the work yourself for the most part.  I used to buy fast food every  night, now when I do it to reward myself, I realize how much I fucked myself over for convenience.   Once you start eating good, the shit you're ashamed of will taste disgusting, because it is."

I now weigh 190-205lbs depending on when I weigh myself. Anyway here's what I did... It's really easy to do it just requires discipline. I stopped drinking and eating sugary things Pop/soda, candy, cake, etc. I drank a protein shake for breakfast. I used almond milk and a half  scooped of whey protien to lower the calories. I know you cant  do nuts so dairy milk would work too. For lunch I ate spinach salads. Salads consisted of items I like for example. Red onion, black olives, avacado (god tier in salads imo), black beans, bacon bites so on and so on. I went with light salad dressing and no crutons. For dinner just about everyday I ate Chicken, brown rice, broccoli/green beans. It sounds bland and boring but it's not. You marinate and cook the chicken how ever you want. The rice you can season with spices or add beans to it (it's just a healthy filler so you won't get hungry). The broccoli I would steam or add things like sesame seeds and soy sauce and saute them. And if I ever had a sweet tooth I would eat fiber one 90 calorie snacks. Like the brownies or cookies. I think the most important things are to drink tons of water through out the day. Count your calories with myfitnesspal (it's a lot easier to say no to a bag of 200 Cal chips if you know how long you have to run to burn 200 cals) I set my calorie intake at 1500 but you can eat more and still lose weight. Last weigh your self at least once a week wearing the same thing  (or nothing all) so you can see progress or lack of and correct it b4 it becomes a habit.  Oh one other thing I did is I made a challenge for myself. I decided I was going to run my first 10k (like 6 miles) race. I told everyone about it so I couldn't back out. And I just trained for it. The running plus my eating change allowed me to go from 280 to 195 in less than 5 months. I'm 29 years old and I still play lots of video games. If can do it so can you! You just have to have discipline! Sorry about the block of text I'm typing this on my phone and I'm not sure how formating works."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,rnplyr1985,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:39:37 2015 UTC,Eating everything with chopsticks will slow you down and maybe make you less inclined to eat because it's more work.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,agoodliedown,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"Hello Scarylatinword!   I used to be in the same boat as you.  I don't know your measurements, but I was 6'1 and 377lbs.  Growing up I lived with my dad (who was a chef) and grandma (grandmas don't let you leave the table without eating seconds) so I was well fed.  After leaving and going to college, I wanted to break bad habits and this is what I did.  Drink lots of water There are two ways you are going to lose weight, sweat it out - or pass it out.  Eating a balanced diet just helps improve/maintain the process.  The more water you drink, the more your body uses it's digestive system.  This is burning calories.  Walking to the bathroom - burning calories.  Sweating from holding in your pee because there is a huge line at the wallyword - burning calories.  Drinking 16 ounces of water every 2 hours increases your metabolism by some sort of low double digit percentage.  Your body also cleanses itself and passes away waste when you ""go"".  Breakfast of Champions It is the most important meal of the day and you should pig out.  You wake up every morning and tell yourself that you want to be full and satisfied for the day to come.  Eat yourself a serving of grain, a serving of protein, a serving of fruit, a serving of vegetables, get your cup of dairy.  Drink your water.  A serving of grain is a slice of toast, or half a muffin.  It doesn't really matter within reason.  Your protein can be eggs or bacon - choose one not both.  I personally am a huge fan of oatmeal or granola as it keeps you fuller longer.  I get some really good greek yogurt and granola (dairy/grain), add a banana and drink some carrot juice (fruit/veggie).  I save my breakfast protein for my snack.  Eggs and spinach is a personal favorite as well.  You can do other things.  Overnight oatmeal is delicious and cheap (like less than $1.00 a serving - more if you add chia seeds).    Lunch Get in the habit of packing if you are in it for the long hull.  Your food is going to eventually taste better than anything you can buy because you will be the best chef in the world once you realize how cheap cooking is.  If only dishes just magically disappeared.  I am a simple man so I tend to keep my cooking simple.  Grain - veggie - protein.  This week I had quinoa, broccoli, and chicken in a chipotle tobacco garlic sauce that the chicken was cooked in.  If you are extra fancy make it into a stir-fry!  I layer my food in a microwavable tupperware container and am good to go.  Unless you are going to workout or something after lunch - eat less food during lunch than you did for breakfast.  Dinner - not Supper Don't eat after 7:00 pm.  This means don't eat 3-4 hours before bed.  Eat less food than you did for lunch because you are just going to lay around the house for the rest of the evening.    For dinner I usually do the same thing I do for lunch but no grain.  You mentioned you usually eat freezer dinners for two meals a day.  Sometimes I do as well, the only difference is I make my own freezer dinners.  Ziplock sells steam able ziplock bags. I hope you see where I am going with this.    Take your chicken and fry it up.  Take your Broccoli and blanch it.  If you don't want to blanch your broccoli, just buy a bag of frozen veggie that comes in a steam bag. Combine both of them into the ziplock bag and add your sauce.  I love chipotle tobascco - and usually add it to any stirfry sauce I find that I like.  People at work hate me because my microwaveable lunch smells so much better than theirs.   Dessert This is why you skip your grain.  I am not going to write anything here because this is your cheat section.  The key to not losing weight is to not over indulge.  You did well today so here is a small treat to help you relax.  Oh and remember you get to pig out for breakfast!  Snacks You eat less with each meal but you sneak in a small snack every now and then.  This allows your digestive system to constantly operative - BURNING CALORIES!  You have a nut allergy so I feel sorry for you.  Trail mix is my go to for this.  Sometimes I snack on a spinach salad.  It is like 200 calories and feels like a whole meal.  This is where you can sneak in some more fruits and veggies.  Oven roasted chickpeas are deliciously cheap and can be doctored up with basic spices.  I am bad at this section because I make my own trail mix and popcorn to suffice my appetite.  I used diet and exercise and got myself down to a healthier 226.  I'm still trying to shed a few more pounds but have come a long way.  I wish you the best of luck. Here's to good clean eating!  Sepulcralis!"

You'd be surprised how fat sugar makes us. Try that, along with stepping up your physical activity level a bit, and I think you'll see some decent early results.  Oh, and water, water, water."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,aratcliffe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:59:44 2015 UTC,"Herbs and spices are your best friend right now, imo. I've got a little shaker of Mrs. Dash that I got for like $4 from Walmart that's lasted me a good 2-3 weeks so far, and I use the hell out of it. I went with the oniony blend. But seriously, finding a set of spices that you like can make some stuff really edible that you wouldn't think would be that good, otherwise. They're not too expensive, and you get a lot of use out of them. Start building a spice rack!  Salt, ground black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, cumin, curry powder, lemon pepper... all sorts of stuff can be made delicious just by tossing in some shit. Keeps the veggies and meats from getting too bland.  So my lazy meal (read as: most meals) for the past year has just been a pastabomination, where I throw some cheap noodles on, then shuffle around about 1/4 of a bag of frozen pepper/onion blend from Walmart with some olive oil, then throw it all together.  But in the past week or so, I've been experimenting with frozen veggies instead of pasta, and it easily cuts like 200-300 calories off the meal.  So here's what I do. I fill a 2-qt saucepan like 1/3 of the way up with water, put in a fair amount of salt, and get that sucker boiling. Then I dump in a bunch of kale, and once it starts boiling again, I put in some broccoli. Then I do the same pepper/onion thing as I did with the pasta.  When the kale is done, I use my pasta strainer to get the water out, then I squeeze some lemon juice on it and add some delicious spices. Then I dump the pepper/onion concoction in and mix it all together, add more spices if it doesn't taste right, and stick it in the fridge to marinate for 10-15 minutes.  BAM. Done.  Another thing you can do is get a tub of some type of dry, salty cheese, like parmesan or romano (I go for a 3-cheese blend) and some pre-cooked bacon bits. Cook up a bunch of veggies, then while they're still hot, stick 'em in a bowl, add some cheese (you'll find that you really don't have to add that much to get everything you want out of it), add some bacon bits, add some olive oil and lemon juice, salt, pepper, whatever spices you want, and you've got a cheap, lazy meal where you do stuff for maybe 10 minutes then wait around for the flavors to soak in for maybe 15.  I don't bother measuring anything but the high-cal stuff. I make sure I know exactly how much cheese, oil, and bacon are going into it, but I don't really worry about the veggies, because... well... they're veggies. And they're not particularly starchy or fatty ones that are secretly high-calorie while pretending to be healthy.  SO, in summary, a per-meal cost:  Maybe $0.15 worth of spices and stuff Maybe $0.10 worth of olive oil Maybe $1 for kale (I load up on it because it's filling) Maybe $1 for broccoli About $0.25 worth of cheese About $0.10 worth of bacon bits  You're looking at maybe $2.50 for a tasty meal once you've already invested in your spices and oil and stuff. And trust me when I say it's FILLING."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,homedoggieo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:40:35 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people have responded to you, I just wanted to give you a few things that have helped me in my long struggle with weight and food.  Drinking water out of a straw is seriously magical. It makes me drink tons more water than usual. And staying hydrated keeps you from feeling hungry.  Cut out soda as best you can, but you don't need to go cold turkey, slowly decrease it. That stuff is addicting like crack cocaine.  Eat snacks, but not junk food. Nuts, veggies, cheese, yogurt, fruit, hard boiled eggs, are all good options.  Cut out fast food as best you can. Again, no need to go cold turkey, unless you feel like you can.   GO SLOW and don't totally deprive yourself. It is extremely hard to drastically change your diet, so just cut out things a little at a time, and you will slowly find new, healthy foods that you like instead.  If you eat one bad thing, don't make the whole day a cheat day. I have type-2 diabetes, and sometimes I eat a little treat that I'm not supposed to have (like ice cream), but I try to eat everything else healthy that day, so that it isn't just a crap day.   Finally, get some people to help keep you motivated! Tell people that you are trying to eat better, and let them know you are serious about it. This will motivate you, and hopefully cut down on people offering/forcing you to eat poor choices (i.e. co-workers be like ""You can eat just one doughnut, it's fine!"").   Good Luck, Man. Taking control of your diet and weight is one of the most empowering things you'll ever do."

To the diet itself, it seems to be more for extreme cases and not for people who are slightly overweight. The keto diet, as far as I can tell, is another variation of an Atkins type diet; high protein, low carb diet that induces ketosis. It's not the worst for you, but there are side effects and you're depriving your brain of its #1 fuel source (glucose). The larger point is that it's not sustainable long term."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cwfc4,Logan_Chicago,2,Sat Jul 11 11:01:12 2015 UTC,"The /r/keto FAQ has info on how your brain derives glucose by breaking down proteins taken in. You still feed your brain and you feed it right, just not from carbohydrate metabolism.  Also to clarify, the idea is low-carb high fat, rather than low-carb high protein. It is absolutely sustainable long term, and plenty of people move on to continue ketosis well after their stated dieting period."

It is absolutely sustainable long term   In a way I agree - humans can survive on just about anything, but is it advantageous? I highly doubt it. Diets that are high nutrition, high-fiber, low calorie are the only ones with lots of scientific evidence backing their efficacy (for long life mostly)."

I know it's really common for people to blame junk food and ""the media"" and fast food and the cheapness and accessibility of low quality food for being fat, but really you can eat shitty food and be skinny as long as you aren't eating more of it than your body needs. Will you be healthy? No not really - but you won't be fat either.  I mean, my brother is like 6 foot something and probably weighs around 160 or so. He is super scrawny and hates fruit, won't touch vegetables and pretty much lives on frozen food and fast food burritos. He's skinny because although he eats pure trash, he just doesn't eat that much of it.  Also drink a shit ton of water and drink nothing but water. Drinking more water and getting enough sleep are the two easiest and cheapest ways to start getting healthier."

Learning to cook and eat healthy is an easy but takes a long time to master skill. You'll have to spend time on it and also to make sure you get all your nutritional needs. Since you are 19 I imagine you also have started college or newly in a career, and that takes a ton of time.   With soylent, you can start eating nutritionally complete and perfectly portioned meals right away. It will hopefully train you to eat for nutrition and stop at reasonable portions, since commercially packed foods usually come in unreasonable portions. It will also train you out of eating heavily salted, high fats and foods specifically engineered for you to not feel satiated, such as freeze ready meals and snacks.   It's a crutch yes. But you sound worried about your health so start somewhere sustainable. The most dangerous thing is to jump into the deep end and getting frustrated with wasted portions and lack of time and giving up right away.   Chip away at this life long pursuit in a sustainable way. Keep coming back here and try one recipe at a time when you have the time.   Good luck, friend."

I was 250, got to a low of 172 and have been about 180-185 steadily ever since. Here was a typical day of meals/ snacks:  Breakfast: cliff bar 190-200 cal  Morning snack: granola bar 90-110 cal  Lunch: turkey sandwich on whole wheat sandwich roll with mustard. 160 cal. Peanut butter crackers 190 cal.  Afternoon snack: apple 100 cal  Dinner: lean cuisine and two pieces of wheat bread lightly buttered with margarine. 320 cal  Evening snack: yogurt with granola 120 cal.  This is a really extreme diet. I was taking in about 1200 calories per day. At the beginning I was probably closer to 1500 per day which is what most experts say is the lowest you want to go.   I was also working out 3 times per week and drinking 2 gallons of water every day.   It's not easy but you can definitely do it. If my lazy ass can anyone can."

I think diets fail because people try to augment their existing lifestyle with something very incompatible to who they are.   What I mean is being 284 is part of who you are right now. There is a version of you, it can be anything you want it to be, that is 180lbs. 180lbs you would not make the same decisions, do the same things, or live the way that 284lbs you does.   Start living like 180lbs you - find a metaphor for what that is and live it. The rest of your life will begin to fall in line behind your new mental attitude as your actions change to become that mental image.  Here's an example - basement dweller MeanOfPhidias thought exercise was torture and was fine eating a bag of crackers for a meal. Spartan MeanOfPhidias eats paleo because Spartans hunt and kill things and processed foods are for non-warriors. To be a good Spartan you have to be strong. Working out becomes a side effect to who you are. When you start seeing yourself differently it becomes easier to form the habit than trying to force the habit to fit into your old mental image.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,throwitallaway500,133,Fri Jul 10 21:43:28 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Incredibly sorry to hear about your situation. Take a deep breath, you can do this.   Sounds like you have a fairly decent diet already. I would recommend trying to ""sneak"" a veggie or two into dishes you already like -- vegetables contain a LOT of vitamins that will make you feel good physically and mentally! For instance, try slipping one slice of lettuce into your deli meat sandwich. Then stick in a slice of tomato. You said you like guacamole, try using that to liven up your sandwiches. Bam, you have lunch every day. (Prices: Deli meat can be ~$2 for ~10 sandwiches, if you get the cheap kind, or ~$4-$5 for the more expensive kinds. Lettuce is super cheap, like $1 a head, tomatoes are like $1 a tomato. Premade guac can be expensive, like $5 a tub, or you can make your own. TIP: Google recipes for anything that sounds good to you! Google is full of great recipes.) Another idea is add a simple veggie stirfry to the rice from the Chinese take out. It can be mostly rice with a few veggies on top!   Now, do something similar with fruits. Fruits are great -- they're like dessert without lactose or processed sugar! You mentioned that you like dairy-free icecream. Try putting some sliced strawberries on top, or some blueberries. (Be warned though, if berries are not in season they will be somewhat expensive, ~$5/pound.) Cheap fruits are bananas, oranges, and these can be eaten as delicious healthy snacks.  It's totally possible to have a delicious, healthy diet while being lactose intolerant! :)   Now here's some advice about next steps and budgeting:   If you're making $2500/month, you should be spending about $50 a week on food. Look on apartment rental websites for your area to figure out what a reasonable rent is. Try not to spend more than 30% of your income on rent. (Where I live, that's impossible, I'm spending about 3/4 my income on rent. It sucks, but it's definitely workable, just in case your area has similar rents.)   Once you've figured out a reasonable rent, try making a budget. Open up Excel and divide your income into the expenses you know you have (food, estimated potential rent, gas/public transit, car payment, student loans, potential phone plan.) Figure out how much of your paycheck you'll have left over at the end of the month, and that should go in your savings account.   One last thought: if you're still feeling unsure about how much different foods cost, just get out there and browse through a grocery store. Avoid high-end places where the prices will be jacked up, but most normal grocery stores have reasonable prices and be fairly similar to each other.  Good luck dude!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,Odran,7,Sat Jul 11 05:31:10 2015 UTC,"The reasoning as I've heard it is that processed foods are usually designed to be pleasurable to consume and cheap to produce, but not to satiate or deliver the best mix of nutrition.  Because of this, processed foods tend to be very dense in salt, simple carbs (including sugars), and fats. The also tend to be light in the broader mix of important nutrients. This makes it tough for a person with a large proportion of processed food in their diet to get a complete and sufficient mix of all the things a body needs to function well without over-consuming on those densely packed elements. It's becomes a lot easier to maintain a balanced intake of those different elements by just avoiding processed food as a general rule.  The sugar in fruits is often considered less of a problem because it's packed up with plenty of nutrients and a ton of fiber. So a person can get a more appropriate level of everything their body needs without overloading so much on one component (sugar and their calories). All the fiber also means that it is physically more difficult (but not impossible) to over consume to the degree that is easy with a lot of heavily processed foods."

That's jasmine rice pricing, you can get less flavorful kind cheaper. Make rice, steam a bag of frozen vegis (I use broc/carrot/cauliflower blends), then you can mix that with a can of soup, some meat from the stove, spices, soy sauce,  etc. Takes minutes to do the actual coming part, and if you're careful with soup type, no milk? We usually fry some burger meat with mushrooms and chicken stock and spices to top.  We also do, uh...microwave some potatoes, or bake them if you have time, then slice and fry with garlic, mushrooms, a handful of veggis you can handle or ignore with the taste of the mix, lots of spice (more garlic, pepper, salt, onion powder), and some egg.

That was something really important to us, since with new jobs and a new city and such, we haven't settled enough to know what we're doing day to day.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,margaret3lizabeth,2,Fri Jul 10 22:42:45 2015 UTC,Why not head into a local store and find out? Many large stores (ie walmart) also have weekly flyers you can find on the internet to get an idea of what prices are like in our area.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,nothingtoprove,0,Sat Jul 11 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"If you have an Aldi near you, eggs, milk, potatoes are much cheaper than traditional grocery stores, at least in the Midwest.    For example, a gallon of milk at Aldi is $1.69. At the grocery store it's about $3.50. Dozen eggs at Aldi is $.79. At the grocery store they are $2.29. I drive 20 minutes into town to go to Aldi instead of shopping at the grocery store up the street for me, because I just cannot bring myself to pay more for the same thing.  I'm going to price comparison with the grocery stores, Aldi,  Sam's Club and Dollar General (for a few shelf items like canned soup, flour, cereal, etc.). Aldi is cheaper than even the store brands about 90% of the time. Some people don't like to buy meat or produce there, but I found that it's all very good quality. The produce does sometimes go bad more quickly, so I take that into consideration when meal planning.  My advice to you on cooking and expanding your diet is to go slowly and be kind to yourself. You have a lot going on right now, and it won't help you to stress yourself further trying to cook gourmet meals seven days a week.  Stick with the diet that you know and are comfortable with to start, and add in one or two new foods or cooking techniques each week.  Try something new on your days off from work, so you have time to prepare and cook and figure things out.  If you like it, great! Incorporated into your regular diet. If not, don't beat yourself up. Try something new next time.    Small changes are key. For example, instead of getting your rice from the Chinese takeout, try instant or minute rice.  It's cheaper, and you always have it on hand.  Once you've gone through a box or two of that, then try boiling traditional rice on the stove.  Baby steps. You'll be fine."

That's basically my entire diet right now.  I work full time and make $2500/month. I started less than 3 weeks ago, so I am new to actually having an income and I don't know how to create a budget. I don't know how much should go towards housing (which is free...for now), food, etc. Before getting kicked out, my only expenses were my car payment and student loan payment.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,Just4Kix1230,38,Mon Jul 13 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"I realize that this sub is about eating and food choices, but if you would accept some free advice I strongly suggest that you start a budget.  Don't worry about it being a BAD budget either, just start somewhere and fix issues as you go.  For an extremely simple budget, consider the following as a place to start.  Divide your monthly take-home pay 3 ways:  50/20/30  50% ($1250) for fixed expenses.  This includes rent, utilities, car payment, and insurance.  20% ($500) for financial goals.  This includes paying down your student loan, credit cards, and retirement savings.  30% ($750) for variable expenses.  This includes groceries, shopping, eating out, entertainment, and gas.  A few points next:   Don't feel that you have to use the exact figures that I provided.  Consider them a guideline, but feel free to modify to suit your particular needs. DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR SAVINGS.  You should work (however gradually) on building an emergency fund of 6-12 months that you can access if you have a dire need. Whatever budget you decide on, stick to it!  I would recommend reconciling your spending no less frequently than weekly at first.  As you integrate this and make tracking your finances a habit, you can adjust to a comfortable level.   Finally, don't worry about getting some fancy app to track all of this.  I have been tracking mine through a few spreadsheets that I created, but I used to manage my budget with pencil and paper.  In fact, I personally believe that some of the flashy apps out there do more to obscure your spending than they do to help.  Once you develop some positive habits, keeping up with your finances becomes quick and easy."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,darkwolf131,3,Fri Jul 10 22:10:19 2015 UTC,I will say GoodBudget is a good app. It forces you to add your data manually which makes you keep on track of everything. Every two weeks I download the Quicken files from my banks and CC and feed them into GoodBudget to ensure I missed no transactions.  The envelope system ensures you don't make 'funny money' aka debt appear. I am debt free because of this program.  I used it to pay off my CC and track reward spending where I pay no Interest because I pay off the full balance every month.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,HexCodeHarry,16,Fri Jul 10 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"Stop buying rice from the takeout place. Buy a $30 rice cooker.

Think ""Why the fuck did I waste so much money on buying pre cooked rice?""   Try to use brown rice, it's better for you given you diet than white/long grain.  Also perhaps some of the rice/quinoa mixes you can buy these days. The extra nutrients will do you good and you seem to like ""earthy"" foods like beans & nuts so quinoa should be right up your alley.  My go to cheap meal when I'm working nights is: 1 cup of brown rice, 1 small can of 5 bean mix (red kidney beans, white kidney beans, butter beans, chickpeas and borlotti beans) and a 150g tuna in sunflower oil. It's cheap, it's filling and it gets you carbs, protien & fibre with minimal salt and sugar.  I know you have issues with veggies but give a small can of corn kernels a go. If you can eat popcorn you can eat corn kernels.  EDIT: I see you like hummus (chickpeas) as well so maybe try making some falafel premix which is granulated chickpeas with some herbs and spices. You add water, mix together and you can mush them into patties and fry them lightly in a decent oil."

We bought a $15 (at the time) cheapie from Target and I wondered how I ever made it through college. It's up there with a slow cooker... Set it and forget it.    Pick up a slow cooker; cheap cuts of meat cooked at a low temp for a long time become tender. They are common at thrift stores, if you need. (Rice cookers, it will be heavily dependent on your region whether you can thrift that.)   Agreed with a PP about figuring out a budget; I made it through a very tight time after college if only for this reason. There were times I was eating pancake mix without eggs, the cupboard was literally empty, but the rent was paid and lights were on, and pay day was a day or two away. In other words: I could pick what to pay for, and time things, because I budgeted.    Best wishes. My lactose intolerant roomie married a lactose/soy/egg/wheat-allergic fellow...

You should know that steel cut oats are NOT pre-cooked, and might very well sit differently in your stomach. More importantly, you can make OAT MILK which has no lactose. The by-product of making oat milk is cooked steel cut oats, which might very well digest better for you.  I'd suggest purchasing a small can of steel cut oats, and try them.

Potatoes are about $3 for 15 pounds where I live, and are generally super cheap everywhere.  All you do is take a potato that's a little bigger than your fist, poke some holes in it, and microwave it for 6-8 minutes. Cut it open with a fork, add a dollop of margarine, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Hot sauce is also a tasty addition.  This is much cheaper than ramen, and healthier! If you want protein, eat it with a fried egg (eggs are about $2-3/ dozen where I live).  Or just slap on a piece of lunch meat. Potatoes are healthier than most cheap breads, so I tend to reach for a potato rather than a sandwich when times are lean!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,JAS678,5,Sat Jul 11 02:27:32 2015 UTC,"My favorite blog is Budget Bytes.  Meals that are easy to cook and inexpensive.  I also suggest you keep some ramen or box mac & cheese on hand.  Should you be eating these things?  Not regularly, but when you're learning to cook you'll inevitably have a meal that turns out horribly or burns or whatever after 90 minutes of work and you'll want to say fuck it.  So it's important to have an emergency backup on hand.  Also, your budget will change over time.  It sounds like you have enough money for some disposable income right now and that's good.  I can feed myself quite easily on about $150-200/mn for groceries.  But that's taking into account I have a fully stocked kitchen.  There are a lot of ingredients that are called stock ingredients.  These are things like oil or sugar.  You buy them in large quantities, they take eons to spoil (if they spoil at all), and you use them sparsely.  I might buy a big container of olive oil for $15 which seems an insane cost at nearly 10% of my monthly food budget until you take into account the fact that I'll use that olive oil for a year.  When your kitchen is filled with the kind of stock ingredients that you use regularly, you can spend more of your budget on actual food.  You'll also need non-edibles.  Zip bags, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, etc.  I guarantee if you don't make a point to buy these things you won't realize you need them until you realize at home you need them and don't have them.  At first it's best to plan 2-3 days' worth of meals, go to the supermarket to buy the ingredients for them (make a list first), then make those meals.  Before your food runs out repeat the process.  Once you've gotten better and have a bunch of meals you know how to make (probably a few months in), what you'll do is go to the supermarket without a list but with ideas.  You'll see there's good prices on chicken, pork, and ground beef and pick them up.  Then you'll decide what you'd like to make with the chicken and get the necessary ingredients, as you will with the pork and the ground beef.  This is eventual but you'll get it.  Because you've asked about prices, in general, $3/lb or less for any kind of meat is good.  $6/lb or more is expensive.  In between is average.  When you're in a high cost-of-living area these numbers will shift up.  Keep in mind the relative value of food as well.  $6/lb for a ribeye steak is a better deal than $6/lb for chicken.  Bones are also relevant.  If you see boneless skinless chicken breasts for $5/lb and see a whole chicken for $4/lb, the breasts may actually be the better deal because the whole chicken has non-edible bones while the breasts are 100% edible meat.  That said, if your money isn't short and a recipe calls for a whole chicken, I would just buy the whole chicken even if the breasts look like a slightly better price.  Early on, minimize your deviation from recipes."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,dopadelic,7,Fri Jul 10 23:11:22 2015 UTC,There is a great way to cook chicken breast.  And easy to remember.  The 40/400 rule.  Bake in an oven for 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  Slap chicken breasts in a pan and cover with olive oil (or veg oil) and put salt and pepper on both sides.  Bake in an oven for 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  That's it!  Perfectly cooked and good!!!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,behindglasses,7,Sat Jul 11 00:00:17 2015 UTC,"Are you just not good with full on vegetables or fruits? I highly recommend getting some juice if you can handle it. Having so little can lead to a nutritional imbalance, which can contribute to mood swings, fatigue, scurvy, etc.   Also, is it the act of cooking that bothers you, or are you also triggered by using kitchen tools in general? How about watching other people cook? If you practice your knife skills and kitchen planning you can make cooking much faster (if you can chop meat smaller really fast, then you can also stirfry it and get a plate of something done in a few minutes). There are videos by Alton Brown, Jamie Oliver, and other cooks on youtube that show these skills really clearly. If it's just the cooking process that bothers you, you can always try out soup since the cooking process itself is short and it's just a lot of waiting around for it to finish. Split pea soup is pretty easy to make if you're ok with peas, as long as you have a blender. Chicken broth is also easy. A really basic one is just chicken, salt, garlic, water (not super tasty but it's fast and it's edible). You can also throw in some potatoes and noodles to make it more filling."

Bake on a broiler pan or grill), soups/stews, casseroles...   Cabbage is actually really easy to hide. I've put cabbage in enchiladas, and nobody would believe it was there, even after I told them! If you cook cabbage for awhile, it loses it's crunch and a lot of the flavor... super easy to mask with any strong flavor, like hot sauce. Try mixing it in with anything you're going to add strong flavors to, that also cooks awhile. Casseroles, burritos, soups, stews...  Cauliflower is easy to mask too. You can easily use it to substitute for rice or potatoes in most recipes, and it has a lot more vitamins than either of those!  Tomatoes. Get Romas because their flavor isn't shit, like the big tomatoes, and they tend to be the cheapest. Good in pasta, good in sandwiches... I like to make my own vinagrette when I can, and it tops pasta pretty well! Chop up a tomato or two, add some basalmic vinegar, olive oil, oregano, dried garlic or garlic salt, black pepper, and a spoonful of sugar. If you can use a blender, it's super easy. If not, just make sure the tomatoes are as small or squished as possible (consider using canned stewed tomatoes) and just mix the shit out of it.

In terms of food, do you have a blender? Smoothies are really easy for breakfast & you can throw some plant based protein powder in if you're lacking that due to the eating disorder. I use plant milk too instead of dairy (almond milk, hemp milk, soy milk, cashew milk etc) and throw in a couple scoops of protein, ice, a banana and some spinach. Can't even taste the spinach when it's all blended - banana covers almost everything :)   Also, the protein brand I use (www.aloha.com) sells Daily Greens which is a small packet of powder you can put into your smoothie, mix with water, or sprinkle on your grits/food. It's got 2 servings of vegetables in one little tiny packet & comes in a few flavors. It's worth checking out!   Good luck to you <3"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,neurophilos,3,Sat Jul 11 05:55:32 2015 UTC,"As someone else suggested, try Asian food. Its often quick to make and often doesn't contain dairy. Even creamy curries are often made with coconut milk and even if they're not meant to, someone like you could substitute cream for it.   Until you've mastered meat and can afford to buy it, try other protein filled foods that are cheaper and wont give you food poisoning if not cooked properly. Beans, chickpeas and lentils are great. If you like rice, then mix them together and you might not even notice the lentils. Lentils I buy take 20 mins to cook and rice takes 10, so I boil the lentils for 10 mins then add the rice and cook for another 10 mins."

The biggest thing is just being able to read and follow a recipe. Like following directions :)  Also, I really like my crockpot. I can cook a bunch of different chicken recipes in about six hours on low so I just put it on in the morning and it's done by the time I get home. Crockpot stuff is really good for leftovers, too. Like the blender idea that someone else said, you might be able to pick one up at a thrift shop.   Also, do you like fish?

You can find just about everything under the sun. But online recipes can be hit or miss, so do read the comments, they can be really helpful.   You will probably need to buy some basic cooking implements for your new place. For starters, you'll want a frying pan (to cook meat, sauces, and veggies), a large pot (soups and pasta), a casserole dish, a spatula, a colander, measuring cups/spoons, chef's knife, bread knife, paring knife, cutting board, wooden spoon, and slotted spoon. You should probably also get some resealable containers for leftovers, they make excellent lunches (and breakfasts if you're into that sort of thing).   As a poor and busy college student, my favorite go-to ingredients are beans. Dried is cheaper than canned, but canned is more convenient. To prepare black beans, I'll slice up some onions, sauté them in olive oil until they're soft, then toss in some diced tomatoes. Season the tomatoes with a dash of salt, a pinch of sugar (to counter the acidity), and some cumin and chili pepper to taste. When the tomatoes have reduced a bit, add a can of beans, and keep simmering until it tastes cooked! Since you have an aversion to veggies, you could start by going easy on the tomato. This black bean mixture is great in burritos or tacos, or on a baked potato! You can also toss an egg in the skillet as the tomato finishes cooking - I sometimes eat this straight out of the pan. If you're feeling adventurous, sliced avocado goes really well with this.  Regarding your dislike of veggies, don't underestimate the transformative powers of garlic. Olive oil/butter and garlic made me fall in love with veggies. Roasted in the oven or sautéed on the stovetop, veggies like broccoli and zucchini become vitamin-packed vehicles for garlic and fat! Idk if that helps, but I think a lot of people get off on the wrong foot with vegetables because they experienced veggies as overcooked and tasteless. But you're in charge of the cooking now, so you can prepare them in whatever delicious way you choose!   Good luck! Cooking may seem mysterious and difficult right now, but once you get a couple simple and tasty recipes under your belt you'll feel much better. You're a beginner, and you've got nowhere to go but up!"

I learned how to cook rice, steaks, poached eggs, bacon in the oven etc due to it. If you find a recipe that you like but aren't sure of how to prep something or want a second opinion on prepping stuff YouTube is a great place. If I am learning (let's say) jambalaya I will watch a few videos to learn the technique behind it and see variations etc."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,lurkattwork,2,Sat Jul 11 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"Follow budget advice.  It is hard the first one or two times, but after that is simple.  Make sure you dedicate some percentage of your take-home to emergency.  Mine is 7%, my checks fluctuate greatly, sometimes I reduce it to 5% or lower so I have money to eat and get gas (Im still struggling too).  But always put in.  I just had to have emergency surgery and it cost me $300 out of pocket and I did not even feel the stress of it.  That in itself is beautiful.  As for food - can you eat fish? Tilapia is a good starter fish in my opinion, just wrap in tinfoil with some salt and olive oil (get California certified, that's the real deal) and toss it in the oven for 20 min on 375F.  Put it over rice (no shame in Minute white rice).  Work your way to salmon, prepare the same way, but is healthier.  Add a splash of lemon juice, parsley, basil, garlic - your choice.  You can do a lot with a tinfoil wrap and tossing it in the oven and then serving over rice.    If you have a Wegman's (this is the only store I've found it in so far) then try duck.  It's back by venison and hot dogs in the meats.  It's a tad expensive but I think has a great cross taste of some kind of turkey cut and beef, it's hard to describe.  Same deal.  Get a thermometer to stick in to make sure the internal temperature is correct before you stop cooking it though.  They're maybe 10 bucks, most grocery stores have them in the baking aisle.    Working in vegetables - when you are ready, try shish kebabs.  Take chicken, beef, pork, hot dog (I like three meats, one veg) and add a slice of bell pepper as your fourth item.  Or tomato.  Mushroom occasionally as a fifth.  This was my go to for a while.  No grill needed, just pop it in the oven for 350 for 15 min or so.  Also good over rice.  Drizzle with soy or teriyaki sauce for something different if you wish.  You can also easily add spinach to your pastas, add it at the last minute so it wilts a bit.  It's healthy and not a super strong flavor.  If you like chicken, get a roasted chicken from whichever grocery store you chose.  Most do it anymore, it's a way for them to sell whole chicken that was about to go past the Sell By date.  Cut off all the meat, use as sandwich meat or over rice.  Put the remains in a large pot, set low heat, and let it go for a few hours (keep an eye on it).  That makes broth, which you can use for soup and is good for you.  If you refrigerate it and it gets jello-y, you did good.  It will turn back to liquid when heated.  I use it instead of water when I make ramen for some nutrients since ramen has none.    Lastly, if your budget allows it, and it should, as long as you don't overspend then I don't see a problem in reducing your stress by grabbing a healthy to-go meal from a restaurant.  I used to spend $300 a month on take-out - that's too much.  I still eat Peruvian chicken a few times a month when I don't have time to cook.    Lastly, if you want to talk to a therapist, and you should (not because there is something ""wrong"" with you, I'm atheist, i'm talking you have a lot of stress), just google ""therapist (insurance) (city name)"".  You should be able to find one easily that way.  I go to one just to keep myself balanced with everyday stressors, it's amazing the feeling you get just being able to talk to someone without judgement.  Edit: oh and to save money, see if your grocery store of choice participates in a rewards program with a gas station.  For example, one of mine gives you $0.10 off per every $50 spent at their store.  It's not an amazing deal but they do holiday offers and things can add up quick.  They double with another gas station so I used to save points and get gas for $1/gal."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cugt4,audieannie,2,Sat Jul 11 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"Learn to make things with rice and buy a rice cooker. It's the cheapest you can get and the rice cooker makes it pretty painless (just measure rice, rinse, measure water, and press ""cook""). If you gain access to a kitchen and some free time, learn to cook beans from the dry beans. Otherwise, canned beans. Either way, rice and beans contain protein and essential amino acids so you could eat it every day and not die. I'm assuming you've covered possible vitamin deficiencies by taking a multivitamin. In that case you could season with soy sauce or something else nonperishable and be set for months at a time even without a fridge.   When you are in need of new recipes for variety's sake, check out Chinese and Japanese cuisine because they are less likely to use dairy than Western cuisines as much of the population is mildly lactose intolerant. Japanese bento recipes will typically be outside your prep time patience but you can usually find something like mini-hamburgers that keep well at room temp for a day once cooked. You can consider putting in the time once a month to make enormous batches of whatever you find you like and freezing it in small batches. A set of freezer-safe food storage containers would be a good investment once you have a place to live. Freezer-safe and oven-safe would allow you to prepare 3-4 casserole-sized dishes and bake one a week straight from the freezer.   Eggs are another good source of protein and you can cook them plain, with hot sauce, or hard boil them and soak in soy sauce for an absolute minimalist approach to a meal. They also will allow you to make dairy-free bread-type things like pancakes when you are ambitious enough. If you're outside the U.S. your eggs will be safe at room temp for days if not weeks (I hear); inside the U.S., they keep a few weeks refrigerated. If they're cracked, consume immediately or toss.   Meat will always cost more than bean or other vegetable-based protein, unless you get really fancy. Among meats, chicken is cheapest and ground beef is next best. Undercooked chicken can kill you, undercooked beef probably will not. Bacon fries in its own fat and generates enough grease to fry something else in it after.   Chicken soup from bouillon (with or without egg noodles) is very simple and can be veggie-free. Potato options abound if you eat potatoes. Be sure to cut out any eyes (growths, knots) since those are poisonous, but potatoes are safe to eat even after sprouting if you trim those out. You can microwave them if you poke them with a fork first, and you'll have a proper baked potato in around 5 minutes. Lentil soup, if you can eat lentils, is very cheap, simple and adaptable.   If learning about cooking doesn't stress you out, there are a ton of YouTube recipes, and I find these much better to learn from than cookbooks. Way less ambiguity and confusion.   Building on the revelation that you eat guac, you can do so many things with rice and beans and avocado (or proper guacamole). Avocado is an excellent substitute for mayo or other similar consistency dairy products, by the way, and there are no-bake avocado-based cookies somewhere on the internet.   Oatmeal is a good breakfast food that can be adapted with dried fruit and nuts as you're able. Even plain oatmeal with brown sugar and nuts is hefty and tasty. I prefer stone-cut oats for taste and texture, but rolled oats are quicker to cook. I often make a big pot and divvy it up into microwaveable servings for the coming week.   Good luck, dude. You're gonna make it through this."

Please consider looking through /r/atheisthavens or Secular Safe Zone to find some support beyond your friends. There could be someone nearby who'd love to give you a cooking lesson in their home or just talk in a coffee shop. You're not alone :)   Lots of good food advice is already here!   Baby carrots dipped in hummus can be a good place to start for veggies. They are about $1 for a pound, which is about 5 large servings.   Simple chili: a can each of black beans, corn, and tomatoes (diced or spicy or anything) plus some taco/chili/fajita seasonings (or just cumin, chili pepper powder, salt, and/or pepper) can be simmered on the stove, heated in the microwave, or even eaten room temperature with no cooking. The cans are all $0.50 to $1 each. You can mix it with rice to make it go further. Eventually you can try adding a 1/2 cup of frozen spinach to the mix ($1 per pound, 5 1-cup servings).   Consider a slow cooker to make easy chicken and beef dishes, plus soups and even applesauce. They are about $30 and let you throw a bunch of stuff in the pot and then come back in 4-10 hours to hot & ready food. You can buy cheaper cuts of meat that become nice & tender. It's also really hard to mess up the recipes :)   Here's a free cookbook on eating on $4 per day, designed for people on food stamps. /r/budgetveggie (for non-dairy ideas, though there are a lot of vegetables) and /r/slowcooking are helpful too, and /r/freeebooks always has neat cookbooks.   As a young woman it's especially important to get enough iron and B vitamins. Look for a multivitamin pill that has calcium, vitamin D, B12, B6, and iron. You can get 200 tablets (200 days) for under $10 from your grocery store and it is absolutely worth it.   If you have a smartphone check out the app Flipp. It shows you local store ads and you can search all the ads at once. So if you need some cans of beans and are craving vegan ice cream it will show you exactly what stores have the best deals. It's so much easier than going through all the paper ads! Similarly the app Ibotta can save you some money with easy to use rebates.   Good luck, I know you'll be ok!"

All you need to bring it to taste is salt, pepper onions, garlic, any kind of Sambal, Ketjap Manis and an egg. Chicken works the best with this dish. It's also worth it to learn quick technique to cut at least onions and garlic, so you won't feel stressed out when making it. If you squash (push on) a garlic clove with your knife to crack it you can easily peel the skin off in one go. Also you can marinate the chicken with flavours you want to put through the dish, so the taste gets through eveything. Cut the chicken, put it in a bowl and putt olive oil, sambal and ketjap manis through it and season with salt and pepper. Let it marinate in the fridge while you prepare the rest. First fry the onions in olive oil and a bit of real butter. Add pepper and salt (always do this as you add new ingredients to the mix) then the garlic, not too long so it won't burn (but make sure that the onions were fried long enough to avoid it to get crunchy, unless you like that) and then add your left over vegetables one by one. In the meanwhile in a seperate pan quickly cook the chicken on hot temperate untill it's just barely done. Add the rice and chicken to the vegetables and add the ketjap manis untill the rice's brown and the sambal to taste. Make a hole in the middle and crack an egg in it, this is what will fry the rice more. Then stir it as it slowly bakes and mix it more and more with the rest. You can also garnish the dish with a sunny side up egg on top. (Also tip to make it look better: put it in a bowl and squash it down with a spoon and then turn it upside down on a plate and put the egg on top)   That's all! Sorry for my bad English and if anyone knows a better way of doing Nasi Goreng, please chime in. I'm by no means an expert, I just cook it like this regulary and others seem to enjoy it."

For you especially if cooking is stressful soup is a good choice because you can add things little by little and just let it simmer away in the mean time, so you could chop potatoes put them in, some carrots put them in, feel stressed? Take a break that stuff will be fine just sitting there until you want to add something else.   Also, you can't easily burn soup, best way to cook soup is a low heat for a long time, you don't need to watch it cook, you can just leave it to cook all by itself with little input apart from putting everything in the same pot and turning the cooker on.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cxbfy,itstheworstidea,2,Sat Jul 11 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"I assembled healthier things for myself in the dining hall-- microwave ""quesadillas"" with more beans than cheese, salads with plenty of beans and veggies (and a vinaigrette dressing, none of that heavy creamy stuff). Make sure to have a salad with both lunch and dinner and a piece of fresh fruit, like an apple or banana, with breakfast. If  your dining hall doesn't have fresh fruit, get a bag of apples. They'll keep for a reasonably long time, especially if you eat one every day. Non-cream based soups are usually filling but lighter in calories than, say, a burger and fries, so check out those options.   Basically just avoid the deep-fried things and try to limit your potato intake in the dining hall. That was my downfall, despite my salad-eating habits. I mean, there were potatoes in some form at every meal.   Keep some snacks in your dorm room to stop the temptation to run out and get junk food. Something like trail mix is great to munch on, keeps shelf stable, and is healthy and filling. Microwave popcorn without added butter or oil is a great choice, too!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cxbfy,carlaacat,2,Sat Jul 11 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"Not what you're looking for, but see of there is a dining Hall that serves fresh food. My school had a really good one, fresh food every day. Much better than the take out places that were around. Make sure to balance it out, get some meat, vegetables, etc. For me personally, I know I'm lacking in fresh fruit. Anyways, look into it."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cxbfy,lulzdemort,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend making microwave eggs if you're an egg fan. Just whisk some eggs in a bowl with non-stick spray (add milk/cheese whatever) and microwave for 1-3 minutes depending on your microwave. If you look online, there's all sorts of microwave recipes, try some out.  If you have a mini-fridge you can also keep vegetables for salads, some sort of pre-cooked chicken, lunch meat, bread, or whatever. Fruit and nuts are also great snacks. Tuna/salmon salads are great too, though you don't want to eat them more than once a week because of the high mercury content. Stir up the fish, mayo, relish/pickles, apples, celery and you're good.  Most universities also have some sort of student gym on campus. Find a way to stay active while you eat healthy and you'll be fine."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cxbfy,Steaknshakeyardboys,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:37:54 2015 UTC,"If you have a meal plan & dining hall, there are lots of articles online about how to eat healthy there - things like getting partial dishes, lots of salads, etc. if you google ""healthy eating in dining hall"".  I second the microwave recipes other people are suggesting, but if you can get a mini fridge or regular fridge/freezer in which to keep fruits and veggies, I think that would help you a lot! Most dorms allow a small fridge or have a communal one.You can buy a small, single-serve blender on amazon or at target for about $20 (I use this one: http://www.amazon.com/Oster-BLSTPB-WBL-250-Watt-Blender-Travel/dp/B004P2OLB8), and by purchasing some milk/yogurt, frozen fruits, and bagged spinach, and maybe some cocoa powder or protein powder, you can make a wide variety of fast and nutritious smoothies that make for great snacks and breakfasts (check our /r/smoothie). For a heartier meal, as another answerer recommended, pre-cooked chicken and some fresh fruits or veggies is a great idea."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct03y,StaticBeat,19,Fri Jul 10 18:57:33 2015 UTC,It tastes like real brownie. I have tried so many healthy brownie recipes before and I hated them so I decided to take matter into my own hands and create one that works for me.   I have experimented this recipe for a few weeks to fine tune the texture and taste and I can promise you it tastes like a real brownie and the texture is very similar to real brownie as well.   *Edit: Sorry guys forgot to mention stevia in the recipe.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct03y,foshofersher,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"It is hard to know for sure because depends on the coco powder you use and the type of apple sauce and stevia you use. I live in Italy (lived in USA as well). I know for sure the coco powder tasted different from the hershey one I used in USA. The apple sauce (although unsweetened) tasted sweeter as well from the ones in USA. The biggest part is stevia. Did you use the sugar equivalent stevia or raw stevia. In Italy we have both and the sugar equivalent stevia will require 1 cup rather than 1/4 cup. It is a lot less sweat compared to the raw stevia. I used raw stevia and it is plenty sweet for us and my husband has a sweet tooth in general.  (could be a bit sweeter if you really like sweet brownie). These are just my two cents.   *Edit:  So So sorry, I just realized I left the stevia out of the recipe in the comments. It's in the video though."

If so, you will love this recipe. I have tried many healthy brownie recipes before and none of them gave me that brownie texture or even flavor. I decided to experiment and come up with a recipe that doesn't compromise either the flavor or the texture. Don't get grossed out by the beans in the recipe, it helps you get full really fast and you won't notice the beans in the taste.   Calories and macro information for this whole recipe ( 8 brownies total):  439 Calories, 54g Carb (11g fiber), 12g Fat, 28g Protein.  Recipe:  Ingredients:    Flour substitute:    250 g canned beans (I didn't have black beans here so I used navy beans but you can use black beans)  Butter/sugar substitute:    100g unsweetened apple sauce  1/4 cup of stevia  Binding:    1 whole egg  Chocolate flavoring:   35g coco powder unsweetened  1 dash sea salt  1/4 tsp baking powder  1/4 tsp vanilla extract (my baking powder has vanilla flavor, so I didn't use it in the video)   Equipment:   Some paper towels to dry the beans 6 by 8 inch baking pan    Instructions:    Use paper towels to dry the canned beans (important for the brownie texture) and put them into a mixing bowl. Use a fork to crush all of the drained beans.  Add all of the remaining ingredients into the mixing bowl and use a spoon to mix everything very well.  Pour the batter into the baking pan and bake at 180˚C or 355˚F for 50 to 55 min. (check 10 min before it is done by inserting the brownie with a knife. If nothing sticks to the knife, take the brownies out of the oven) Let the brownies cool for 10 min. Preferably on a cooling rack if you have one. Cut them into the portion size you desire (I cut them into 8 pieces) and put them in the fridge before serving. They taste great cold."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cvvvg,iSeeXenuInYou,2,Sat Jul 11 05:23:23 2015 UTC,"My roasted butternut squash risotto is quite fancy and if you're good at Italian food then perhaps you've mastered risottos?  If you want to make less portions then you can still roast all of the squash, but freeze it, either in cubes or mashed, then just half/quarter the other ingredients. This recipe makes 4-5 portions.  Peel, deseed and cube a medium sized butternut squash into bitesize chunks.  Add a couple of cloves of crushed garlic, season with pepper and sprinkle over sage. I always use dried sage which in the end tastes the same as fresh.   Drizzle over some oil and roast on 180C.  Dice 2 onions, can be white or red. You can also dice a bell pepper if you want added flavour and colour.  What I do at this point is shake the squash a bit to make sure it's cooking evenly and if there's enough oil in the roasting dish, take a dessert spoon or two of it out and put it in a large frying pan. If there isn't enough then just add some fresh oil to a frying pan.   And gently fry the onion (and pepper) for 5-10 mins.  Stir 200g of risotto rice into the onions.  Make up a mug of vegetable stock and add 1/5 of it and stir in. The risotto should be on a low-medium heat so it bubble a little.  At this point I'd check on the squash again, maybe shake them a bit.  Stir the risotto mix every couple of minutes. Add 1/5 of the stock whenever the mix gets a bit dry and starts to stick to the pan.   When the stock is all gone you can just add the same amount of water to the mix. If you have some you can also add a glass of white wine to the risotto.  After 15 mins of last checking the squash check it again and also check how soft the rice is. The squash usually cooks a bit quicker than the rice.   If the squash is starting to go brown and is soft so that you can easily mash it with a fork, then it's done. If it's not quite done, check again every 5-10 mins.  When the squash is done, turn the oven off. Dispose of any oil in the dish. Keep half of the cubes as they are in the dish and put the dish back in the oven so that they keep warm.   Put the other half into another dish and mash with a fork or potato masher. Then set this dish aside (can be put back in the oven or just left on the worktop).  During the above couple of steps keep an eye on the risotto and keep stirring it and adding water if needed.  When the rice is soft, add in the mashed squash. Stir and cook on a low-medium heat for 5 minutes so that the squash is evenly mixed in and is hot.  Add in the cubes of squash. Gently stir so that you don't mash them up. Cook for a couple more mins.  I've also served this with chicken before. You can cook a chicken thigh or breast per person while the rest is cooking."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cvvvg,coriacea,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:22:25 2015 UTC,"steamed salmon/brocolli with rice. You'll need two steaming pans (or regular ones with a colander), a stock cube (vegetable), some soy sauce, a bit of sesam oil, some sesame seeds, a tiny bit of wasabi paste and a bit of ginger paste (last two optional) besides the main ingredients. It's very easy to make, looks good and tastes great.  Start with roasting the sesame seeds until golden brown and set aside. Next cook the rice. Make cups out of aluminiumfoil to hold the salmon + marinade (1 tblspoon soy sauce, 1teaspoon sesame oil, a drop of wasabi and a drop of ginger paste). When you have about 15min left bring in both pans a bit of water to the boil and add half a stock cube to them both. Add the salmon with marinade in the made cups to one and cover with lid and broccoli to the other. After 12mins the broccoli is ready but the salmon might need a bit longer. To plate up use a bowl to mold the rice in a round shape, add the brocolli beside that and add the salmon. Then add the sesame seeds to broccoli and salmon. Now quickly from the leftover liquid from the salmon pan make a sauce by adding a bit of cornstarch to it and put that over the rice. If you want you can steam mushrooms with the broccoli also (they need only a couple of minutes) and add them to the sauce.  e: the marinade is for two pieces btw, about a tablespoon for each."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,FunkyMonkeyAssassin2,36,Fri Jul 10 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"I can help with the mushroom soup, but my assistance comes with a story. So, we never had green bean casserole growing up. I saw it on TV, but never on my table. So one day my boyfriend and I were watching Good Eats, and Alton Brown is making green bean casserole. I decided, that's it! I'm going to make this stuff and see just how delicious it is.  Well, the part of the recipe that usually calls for a can of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup, Alton makes his own.   2 tablespoons unsalted butter 12 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup chicken broth 1 cup half-and-half   Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute. Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approximately 6 to 8 minutes.  Full Green Bean Casserole Recipe from Food Network.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,the_supersalad,2,Fri Jul 10 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"That's way more than 5 ingredients, plus it has a ton of fat, probably more than a can of campbell's soup."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,ChiliFlake,2,Sat Jul 11 01:15:00 2015 UTC,"I realize it's more than 5 ingredients, but it's really not a lot of fat."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,iownakeytar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:21:35 2015 UTC,"1 cup of half and half has 28 grams of fat, 17 of that saturated (and that's not counting the butter in your recipe.   1 can of CoM soup has 6 grams fat, 1 gram saturated.  I'm sure it's tasty, but there's a reason for that. The OP asked for healthier alternatives, not fattier ones."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,ChiliFlake,10,Sat Jul 11 02:31:19 2015 UTC,"6 grams is for just 1 serving and the can is 2.75 servings, so it's really around 17g of fat with 4g saturated, which isn't necessarily unhealthy.  What is unhealthy is the 1967mg of salt that comes with it, almost an entire RDA.  And it only makes, with a cup of water, about 18 oz.  The recipe above makes more than that with 2 cups of liquid plus 2 tablespoons of butter and 12 ounces of mushrooms. At roughly 26oz, it is more like 4 servings (using Campbell's logic), so it would be roughly 167 calories, 13g of fat, 8g saturated, but only 135mg of salt.  Campbell's takes out fat that has flavor and puts in salt to make up for it.  I think the recipe is the healthier choice but that's just me."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,Faitmaker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:42:27 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,iownakeytar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:43:38 2015 UTC,I agree... fat is calorie-dense but it keeps you satiated longer and it's a necessary part of your diet in moderation. I'd rather consume a bit of extra fat than too much salt.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,sprinklenoms,15,Sat Jul 11 22:55:06 2015 UTC,Take a look at this. You can make a batch of the base and add ingredients as needed.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,viperex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:29:04 2015 UTC,You could replace the water with broth. Add chopped mushrooms for cream of mushroom or celery for cream of celery.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,JohnnyBrillcream,8,Sat Jul 11 10:24:57 2015 UTC,I've always heard that you can use Greek yogurt instead of cream of mushroom to bind together dishes that require it. I've not tried it before but apparently the flavor is fantastic.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,SolarBurrito,6,Fri Jul 10 17:33:05 2015 UTC,I use Greek yogurt to replace sour cream. Works perfectly.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3ct46o,aaroneliz,7,Fri Jul 10 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"I have a recipe I love that requires Campell's cream of chicken. I replace it simply because they don't sell it at regular food stores here (Denmark) and I can't be bothered to look for it just to cook a cheap meal. So I use a chicken stock cube and whole milk or 8% cream. I don't know if it compares in taste (never actually used the soup), but works great for that recipe."

Make up a mug of stock (veg or chicken) and add maybe 1/8th of it. You don't want to make the mixture too wet at a time. Just add a bit more every time most of the moisture has gone. After the stocks gone, just add warm water. You'll need to stir it every minute or so to make sure the rice cooks evenly. Just cook until the rice and any other ingredients are cooked properly. You can add some grated cheese at the end, but that makes it less cheap and healthy.  That's a basic ristto mix, but that's a bit bland on its own, you can add all kinds of things: roasted butternut squash, roasted peppers, mushrooms, bacon, sweet corn, peas.

We cut them on the small side, and for a party of about 20 people, there was enough for most to have 2.   These aren't incredibly sweet, but you could even cut the sugar back more, maybe by 2 tablespoons in the filling and leave off the sprinkle on top and make them more of a breakfast bar than a dessert.   Blueberry, Oat and Almond Crumb Bars  Prep: 20 min / Cook Time: 45 min   Serves: 24-36 bars   Ingredients  For the crust and crumble:  1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons white sugar (125g)  1/2 cup packed light brown sugar (90g)  1 teaspoon baking powder (3.8g)  1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt  2 cups all-purpose flour (240g)  3/4 cup old-fashioned whole-rolled oats (don't use quick-cook or instant) (60g)  1 cup cold unsalted butter (2 sticks or 8 ounces) (230g)  1 large egg  1 cup flaked almonds (added at the end) (170g)  2 tablespoons Demerara sugar (optional) (24g)  For the blueberry filling:  4 cups blueberries, fresh, frozen or a mix (if frozen, no need to defrost) (1.5 lbs / .68k)  Zest and juice of one lime (or lemon) (about 1 1/2 tablespoons juice)  3/4 cup white sugar (144g)  4 teaspoons cornstarch (6.5g)  Method   Preheat the oven to 375º F / 190º C). Line a 9×13 inch pan with foil or parchment. Cut the cold butter into 1/2 inch cubes and set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together white and brown sugars, flour, oats, salt and baking powder. Cut in the butter and egg using a fork or a pastry cutter, or even your fingers. Dough should have a rough, sandy texture. Move half the dough into the lined pan and press into the bottom using your fingers. In another bowl, gently stir together the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch and lime juice and zest until just combined. Sprinkle the blueberry mixture over the crust. Add almonds to the remaining dough and give it a quick stir, then crumble over the berry layer. I like to squeeze a few bits together in my fingers to ensure some nice big crumbs. Sprinkle Demerara sugar evenly over the top (if you’re using it). Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until top is a light golden brown. Set pan on a wire rack and let it cool completely before cutting into squares (refrigerated bars cut even better).

Yeah, there's butter and sugar in these, but it's distributed between what, almost THIRTY bars? Plus there's also oats and almonds, which are great for you, and if you're looking for something to eat for breakfast on the go this is probably better for you than any bar full of processed junk you'd find in the supermarket.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3co7b2,avidworks,3,Fri Jul 10 05:46:59 2015 UTC,I love blueberries and these sound delicious. But they always seem expensive here in England :(
EatCheapAndHealthy,3co7b2,amasterm,2,Fri Jul 10 08:29:50 2015 UTC,That sucks. You could use whatever berry is in season around you though. Just be sure to vary the sugar in the fruit to suit the natural sweetness of what you use. Sweet strawberries would need less sugar than very tart blackberries.   Also frozen berries work well too and you don't even have to defrost them first. Just make sure they're unsweetened.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3co7b2,resting_parrot,25,Fri Jul 10 13:20:41 2015 UTC,Not entirely sure this qualifies as cheap or healthy
EatCheapAndHealthy,3co7b2,amasterm,36,Thu Jul 9 13:24:39 2015 UTC,I can see your point but the whole thing cost me a little under $8 in ingredients and makes 24/36 bars. That's around .20/.30 cents a serving.   There were also lots of kids who chose to eat one of these (which have oats and almonds and fruit in it) over a store bought chocolate cake that someone else brought.

Eating a big breakfast burrito has proven to be the most effective thing for me, since I can knock out 600-800 calories easily with one of those big Mission tortilla wraps, two scrambled eggs, grated cheese, and even some fried potatoes depending on my mood. Of course you can add bacon or sausage crumbles to this as well. Salsa or hot sauce, avocado, black beans, and chorizo turn it into a tex-mex breakfast burrito, so there's lots of flavor options to keep it from getting too boring.  I've also found that snacking on a baguette, torn off in chunks and dipped in herbed extra virgin olive oil, is really easy to eat a lot of-- and you're getting some good healthy fats that way.  Heck, snacking in general is really helpful, rather than trying to cram in three huge meals. I eat about six times a day, more substantial stuff than just a bag of chips-- hummus with pretzels or carrots, cheese and crackers or string cheese, or even a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3comu2,airial,9,Thu Jul 9 15:10:48 2015 UTC,"I made this last night for dinner.  It was really tasty and very quick to make, which is ideal for me since I make dinner weeknights after the gym and want to eat quickly.   We served it with brown rice and it was great.    Original recipe is Martha, and can be found here.    I've made some adjustments of my own to make it a bit healthier and cheaper (less butter, no wine) and to my own taste (hello garlic), so the recipe typed up below follows my method. If you want the original head to the link above.   I also grow my own herbs which I 100% recommend if you're serious about eating cheap! It's made a huge difference in my cooking, and I love tending to my little herb babies.   RECIPE   ¼ cup all purpose flour 1 ½ lbs chicken cutlets (you could use breasts, just adjust the cooking time accordingly) salt & pepper 3 TBSP olive oil (NOT EVOO) 1 TBSP Unsalted butter 2 TBSP fresh thyme leaves, chopped 1 TBSP or more minced garlic (optional, I added this myself) 1 lb button mushrooms, trimmed and quartered ¼ cup chicken broth ¼ cup dry white wine (NOTE: The recipe calls for white wine, but I didn't have it, so I just used a total of ½ cup of broth and squeezed half a lemon in there and added a dash of apple cider vinegar.  It was fine and still delicious.) ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley    Place flour in a shallow dish. Season chicken with salt and pepper, then coat with flour, shaking off excess. In a large skillet, heat oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high. In batches, cook chicken until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and tent loosely with foil. Reduce heat to medium, add thyme, garlic, mushrooms, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and cook until softened, 6 minutes.  If the garlic starts to stick to the pan, you can add a little bit of the broth mixture to deglaze the pan. You don't want it to burn. Add broth/lemon and cook, stirring, until reduced by half, 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Return chicken to pan along with any accumulated juices; top with parsley."

Trying to make sure that I stay mindful about what/how much I'm eating. :|  Lunch: Korean BBQ (included rice and BBQ Pork, with sides of Kimchi, Tofu, Beef Broth, and bean sprouts), Egg Tart   Dinner: Thai chicken curry, green beans with pork, Pad Thai, rice  Snacks: 1/3rd of a waffle with ice cream, 3 granola bars, peach  probably drank ~200 oz of water - kept refilling my nalgene throughout the day."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,wiglyfe,15,Fri Jul 10 00:10:16 2015 UTC,Eat eggs. Breakfast for dinner is awesome
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,ErikKarlssonsTendon,5,Fri Jul 10 00:33:26 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this! Or a poached egg on top of ramen, fried rice, salad, etc. Eggs go on almost anything."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,girlontheprairie,3,Fri Jul 10 01:09:53 2015 UTC,Breakfast is best around midnight anyway.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,Fatgreyclouds,3,Fri Jul 10 01:44:39 2015 UTC,"Omelettes aren't just a breakfast food.   I've also made quiche, which you can load up with whatever you have on hand and makes great leftovers. It's not super quick, but is low effort once it's in the oven.   Otherwise, I'd second the stir fry concept, you might also prep your meat by getting an econo pack of chicken bits, dividing them up into ziplocs with a marinade, then freezing. Put it in the fridge in the morning or evening prior to cooking should thaw it out so you just dump it in the skillet for dinner. Homemade teriyaki is easy peasy."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,Dissonata,3,Fri Jul 10 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"I usually go with rice and bean burritos. I almost always have wraps in the freezer, and lettuce, salsa, sour cream, cheese, onions and tomato in the fridge anyway. So a cup of rice and a can of black beans mixed together with a packet of taco seasoning or whatever spices you like is as easy as it gets. Once the rice is cooked just throw in the beans and seasoning and you're done.   Also, French bread pizza is easy. Tonight we had leftover chicken so I cut it up and tossed it with buffalo sauce, and put some sauce & mozzarella cheese on a loaf of Italian bread with the chicken.   I think the trick to quick and easy is having lots of little things always around that you can throw together. A salad with some hard boiled eggs or leftover chicken, tortellini with spinach and tomatoes, stir fry (it doesn't take long to chop some veggies... 5 minutes max), tuna melt sandwiches with a can of soup, etc. They're all fast and easy, as are many things, as long as you have them in the house.   For me, I feel like every dinner is pretty fast and easy because I meal plan. In the past, the hardest and most time consuming part was figuring out what I was going to make."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,ToiletSpiders,4,Fri Jul 10 01:45:33 2015 UTC,"Stir fry! The trick is to chop and prep your vegetables the day before or that morning. It's really easy to customize with your choice of protein, and then brown rice or bean thread, shirataki, rice, or egg noodles."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,carlaacat,3,Fri Jul 10 00:45:05 2015 UTC,Or just use a bag of frozen stir fry veggies!

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cqn0r,hlhlhlhl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"Mixed veggies, hamburger, canned tomatoes, and beef or chicken broth makes beef-vegetable soup.   Canned chicken, cheddar or mexi-blend cheese, onion, peppers, BBQ sauce and tortillas make quesadillas.   Canned chicken, mayonnaise, olives, bacon bits, parmesan and crackers or bread makes a great meal. Add lettuce and tomato for an extra boost of nutrition.   Corn and peas are easy to microwave and serve with butter and salt. Sausage like Polska and peppers and onions can all be frozen and throw together with a beer.   Frozen salmon. Instant mashed potatoes or quick cooking rice sides along with a salad or just sliced tomatoes."

Basically any time you don't fall asleep in 20min you go up and do something else, preferably not even in the  same room as your bed. It really sucks at first, but eventually you fall asleep within 20min, the whole point is to never do anything but sleep in your bed. (Well that and the occasional *hrm*)"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cm2ek,sunrisesunbloom,22,Thu Jul 9 08:19:48 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but when I started weighing out portions into little baggies to match the nutrition info serving size on the package, I realised just how ridiculous some of the serving sizes are. Honestly, it's like a suggested trail mix portion is three cashews and a few raisins.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cm2ek,DrewsephVladmir,4,Thu Jul 9 12:58:31 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Also food scales can help you accurately measure the calories in your home cooked meals through adding up your ingredients. It is so much better than looking online for a generic calorie estimate of that dish and hoping it's about the same number of calories as what you ate.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cm2ek,Fudgms,5,Thu Jul 9 14:24:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Or putting any faith in the numbers you find on MyFitnessPal. Like, I don't think enough people realise those are user submitted, and I don't trust other people to measure correctly. It's pretty obvious from the wild differences when looking up things with natural variances (anything in the fresh food category basically). Food scale + WolframAlpha for nutrition info per 100g is all you need."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cm2ek,Yukonkimmy,3,Thu Jul 9 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"I started weighing foods about a month ago. I think for solid foods it makes a difference in the amount in ""one portion"" of certain foods. Ex: my cereal's serving size is 30g or 1/2 cup, but if you use measuring cups, 1/2 cup is more than 30g. I also think it requires me to be more mindful of how much I'm eating and why I'm eating (hunger vs boredom or emotional eating, etc). I require myself to weigh foods before I eat then, which takes a bit more time and effort. It makes it less possible to overeat."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cm2ek,Fatgreyclouds,3,Thu Jul 9 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"Weighing makes a huuuge difference. You really start to pay attention to how much a serving is, such as 1 oz of cheese.

Drink water when you wake up before coffee.Drink it when you are hungry. You have to be able to help your liver filter and hydrate your body.  When you don't ingest a lot of calories, your body thinks you are starving and will turn those calories into fat.   Record everything you eat for a day and get back to us. I would love to be able to help you as I understand your struggle. I was at 220 in February and I am down to 190.   I cut back excess carbs, increased my good fats, tripled my veggies and exercise and drank water every time I could. I started making veggie chow on Sundays. It's a basic veggie stew with everything ( zukes, beans, corn, celery, kale, spinach, garlic, cabbage, tomato and spices. It lasts till about Thursday for around $10.  You will start to notice what works for you. I was on WW for a month or two to give me guidelines and counted points. That was all I needed to make their system work for me."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cm2ek,MissSwat,2,Thu Jul 9 03:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'm having quite a bit of trouble and need some guidance. I've asked in a bunch of different forums but am getting different ideas from all of them. I'm only 23lbs away from my goal weight of 127. I've been dieting for about 2 years and have lost around 70lbs. I moved abroad in February and since then have lost only about 10lbs. Those 10lbs have been an absolute struggle. I don't know if it's because I'm close to goal weight or what, but I can't reign in my binge eating and emotional eating. Here's a run down of the day.     Currently I skip breakfast, because I don't feel hungry that early and can stave off hunger til around 12 pm. If anything I'll have instant coffee (50 calories). When I do eat breakfast (because I try to fix my binge eating) I am insatiably hungry throughout the day despite drinking about 4-5 L of water every day. I end up eating over my calories every time because I've stoked the fire and can't stop snacking.  Lunch: Light salad with olive oil/vinegar dressing (about 150 calories total)  Dinner: Remaining calories spent on junk food (tends to be about 800 calories depending on my coffee intake during the day). Literally this can be chips, cookies, sandwiches, ice cream - whatever I can get my hands on.      Now I know this sounds like 'you don't eat enough during the day so you binge at night' but really I've always been this way. I eat quite a bit at night out of 'relaxing' or 'too stressed' and it's always been a family habit. I was better at breaking it when I was in the US but where I live now, it's like I go to the convenience store almost every night just to buy bad food. So no, it isn't in the house. But that doesn't stop me from walking my butt to a store every night to go get something. I've been told it could be protein intake, that I'm not eating enough protein so I'm not full. But the problem is that after about 300 to 400 calories at night, I feel 'full' but my mind is just incessantly thinking about food. And I mean, I cannot distract my head for 6 hours from when I get home to when I get to bed in order to not go out and get food!      I'm not sure what is wrong with me - this has been a phenomenon that really cropped up since I moved abroad. I'm so close to goal weight and the inability to shift the pounds when I'm so close is really getting to me.   Stats: 23F 5' 3"" CW:150 GW: 127"

Edit: I should add that I ask because in the last year I've gained substantial weight, and while I am now in a 'healthy' range as far as body mass goes (because I come from a tiny people and we are usually stick-like), my husband is not quite as lucky. The only thing that I can associate our mutual weight gain to is drinking.

Only get the kind that's refrigerated though; the others aren't crunchy enough. Also the whole sweet pickle gherkins are pretty tasty (just less salty).   I give into my cheese cravings but I try to add small amounts of cheese to recipes-- like putting cheese on top of beans and rice-- rather than just eating lots of slices of cheese. It helps.  Greek yogurt is really satisfying, too, and your body does need more calcium so it is a really good option. You can make it sweet with fruit, or savory (on top of a baked potato)."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cohkl,Fatgreyclouds,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"Well I'm trying to gain weight so I eat it pretty unabashedly. I don't think it's ""bad"" in moderation, but when the cravings hit moderation tends to fly out the window so using it as a garnish or serving it alongside other things (for example, a whole apple and one ounce of cheese slices or cubes) is a better way to feel more full and portion it out a bit better.  Allergic to dairy, or lactose intolerant? There's a difference-- aged cheeses don't have lactose but are still, obviously, dairy. If you're allergic though, cheese is bad for you! I'm sorry :("

Chicken and dumplings is my go-to, because it's a clear soup that tastes super indulgent with the dumplings.   As for desserts like cookies, I try to make them on my own so I can at least control what goes into them--you can make your cookie binges less awful if you only put 1/2 cup of sugar compared to the bakeries which probably double or triple what they put in theirs."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cohkl,murdermcgee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:46:27 2015 UTC,I totally agree about making your own desserts. I like subbing in whole wheat flour and replacing most of the sugar with stevia (using a small amount of sugar really covers up the stevia taste). It's still not the kind of thing you should eat in large quantities but it helps satisfy the craving without sabotaging your diet too much.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,Choscura,3,Wed Jul 8 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"Thai version (""khai jiao"" or ""kai jeow"", depending on romanization) is pretty fast and easy.  chop whatever you want up, including the meat, add fish sauce (or soy or salt and water), a dash of oyster sauce (umami, mentioned elsewhere), and put it in a pan with a coat of hot (smoking) oil on the bottom.  You can make this very thick, but it will come out soggy. You're almost looking for a crispy golden brown shell around the omelette from being 'shallow fried' this way, so don't be afraid of over cooking- go fast, crisp up the outside, and the center will come out perfect. It should be about 1/2"" thick when done properly. Serve with ketchup, pepper sauce (a derivitive of sriracha, probably the best description is 'ketchup made from bell peppers instead of tomatoes'), sriracha (yes, really, it's a Thai sauce, it's kosher here, this isn't foul bachelor ramen bullshit), and/or fish sauce with diced chilies and garlic and maybe a dosh of lime juice in it (""prik namplaa"").  Edit: forgot to talk about veggies. You can use basically anything you like- I recommend things like spinach, garlic, onions, peppers, mushrooms, etc.  So this is a natural place to start."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,Choscura,11,Wed Jul 8 15:19:37 2015 UTC,"You could stuff a portabello cap with almost anything... and they are tasty!  Cheese and breadcrumbs with some spinach maybe.  Spinach is always good to sneak in because you can chop it up pretty finely and it can offer flavor with little texture.  Stuffed peppers can have all kinds of veggies in them too, and you can do the traditional stuffing with onions and mushrooms... or I like to make a tex-mex kind with salsa black beans and corn.  Did you ever try to do spaghetti squash in place of spaghetti... you can put a pretty chunky meat sauce on top and it is good... it isn't quite like spaghetti but it is a carb and its flavor is mild and wouldn't hold up much to a meat sauce.  I have one of those vegetable spiralizers also (as seen on tv ""veg-ghetti"" or something like that) that works super well with zucchini and carrots, maybe do half linguini and half zucchini.  I have also done the cauliflower fried rice and it comes out awesome... if he already likes fried rice maybe you could try that half and half first to see how he takes it.  I like to add an egg, everything kind of sticks together and takes on the flavors of the soy sauce and chilis."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,Choscura,3,Wed Jul 8 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"Well you know what is even better than a meat sauce (from a vegetarian perspective at least haha) is a mushroom sauce!

Peppers and onions also go well with tomato sauce, and I stick with canned tomatoes unless they came from my garden.  Figures that cauliflower is the one thing you don't eat haha...and I understand sprouts, they have a very.... earthy flavor.  A cheap fave of mine is always rice and beans, and if I am trying to reduce my carbs I always load up on the peppers and onions, you can add garlic and chilis too to make it nice and spicy."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,budgiefacedkiller,12,Wed Jul 8 14:21:34 2015 UTC,"Your boyfriend sounds like he's going to have a heart attack by 40.  In any case, add some green veggies to the list, and find a way to make him eat them.  He's not 4, he doesn't have the excuse of 'wanting to be a T-Rex when I grow up' to not eat them anymore.  Don't make it unbearable, though- start with things like zucchini brownies, or coleslaw to get cabbage and maybe even something like kale under his radar (if it's all grated up and tastes good, how the fuck is he gonna know, after all?).  so, I have two kids and I regularly cook for them- and I get them to eat their vegetables.  The way I see it, if they don't like it, that's not their fault for being kids, it's my fault as a cook for not preparing it in a way they find acceptable to eat.  I'm not 100% successful, but I've got a pretty good track record.  Here are a few of my fallback recipes:    ""Chinese Buffet"" Green Beans   some kind of bean (I frequently use frozen for this, but fresh is better) garlic (to taste- I usually use between 1-2 tbsp of chopped garlic per 2 cups beans) oyster sauce or mushroom sauce (~1 tbsp per 2 cups beans) soy sauce, fish sauce, or salt (~1 tbsp) (use what you have, but I've listed these in descending order by usefulness) black pepper soup stock or water (~1-2 tbsp)   directions:  add tsp oil to hot frying pan. when smoking, add garlic and black pepper. Then add beans (prepped as necessary- I usually rinse frozen beans under tepid water and roll in a towel to dry). they should begin to brown very quickly- saute to keep them from sticking, and once you see brown, add oyster sauce, soy/fish/salt, and soup stock; stir to coat, then keeping on high heat, reduce the sauce.  The soup stock/water is used to distribute the oyster and soy sauces evenly, not make it bean soup; don't add too much.  Also, this recipe works on any vegetable you can cook in a frying pan- I highly recommend trying it with asparagus, snow peas, collard greens, or really any non-carbohydrate-based vegetable (not corn, not carrots, not potatoes, etc)     Cauliflower mashed potatoes.  I've had one person- ever- actually guess what this was, so don't be afraid to try it. Your boyfriend won't even notice.  My recipe is unusual, but is derived from a very successful restaurant's recipe for their mashed potatoes.   cauliflower garlic mayo butter oyster sauce 1/2 tsp cream of tartar (if not available, use 1 tsp dijon mustard: 2 cups cauliflower- this is an emulsifier to improve texture) salt, pepper (optional) sour cream, chopped onions, other condiments   boil the cauliflower; when it begins almost disintigrating, drain and put it back in the pot. Using a hand blender (preferred) or a mixer of some variety, blend the cauliflower until it is a pulp. after this, season with a mix of 50:30:20 ratio off butter:mayo:oyster sauce (the butter is obvious, but the mayo and oyster sauce? wtf? these are to give the 'potatoes' umami- that brothy meaty flavor) and garlic (again, to taste- I recommend about 1 tbsp garlic : 2 cups 'taters', but that's a bit strong for some people), and finally salt and pepper.  as a side note, I'm planning on experimenting with things like fruit pectin or gelatin to make the dish more 'stiff', as this comes out very creamy, but I can't make recommendations before trying this. I'm also considering trying a mix of potato and cauliflower in the future for the same reason.  If you experiment with it, post it here!    Zucchini brownies  This one I don't have my own recipe for, but the two recipes I can recommend are:  Zucchini brownies  Non-Zuke reference recipe . my mother found this and no longer buys box-mix brownies, because it's so much cheaper and just as easy.  I haven't made Zucchini brownies in years, but plan on changing that soon.  As another side note, I plan on using 3/4 of the zucchini in the first recipe and replacing the last 1/4 with an egg, to act as a binder and improve the texture.  I also recommend adding chocolate chips to this recipe.  And since you're almost certainly going ""yuck!"" and thinking what a stupid suggestion this is for your t-rex-wannabe boyfriend, I should tell you: there is a different texture to zucchini brownies, but it's a better one. you add grated zucchini, and it almost melts into the chocolate- you can't see it, you can't taste it, it just makes the brownies very moist and almost cake like: hence my note about adding an egg- I like thicker/chewier brownies, but the zucchini is a genuine improvement over traditional brownies.    Hope this helps."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,budgiefacedkiller,2,Thu Jul 9 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Considering how unhealthily he eats, its surprising that he's quite slim with some muscles actually being quite well defined! He does do a lot of exercise and normally has fairly small portions. For example he'll have just one of those 9"" mini pizzas with cheese and pepper on, for his main meal."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,razuku,2,Thu Jul 9 06:55:29 2015 UTC,"the ""quite slim"" thing will end sooner than you think (ref: ""Fit or Fat"", Covert Bailey) because as he starts accumulating fat/losing muscle, the first place he'll accumulate/lose is in the muscle tissue he already has- so he won't change appearance until after the damage is already done. (""intramuscular fat"", or, if it were a steak, ""marbling"".)  So he needs to install some 'best practices' on the diet side of things so he can sustain the looks long<er> term.  Part of that means making sure all of the macronutrients he consumes are balanced against what his metabolism can burn and his body can use without storing.  If he's going to be a professional bodybuilder, it's no sweat- but as he starts getting older, it's going to be less and less feasible to continue exercising like this, and the exercises are going to have to be less strenuous and more efficient- both because he's going to have less tolerance for it and less ability to recover quickly (hence the saying ""youth is wasted on the young""), and because he's going to have less time to devote to it as whatever career he has advances.  So green vegetables are mandatory. He doesn't get to argue. Period. Full stop.  But that doesn't mean he has to suffer. What I would do, if I were in your position, is I would look up various cultural bodies of knowledge about cooking: because what these consist of is not cultural identity, but the pragmatism of making good food using what is locally available to the culture making it.  In other words, Thai food isn't Thai food because it's made by Thai people, but because it's how Thai people have figured out how to make the ingredients they have taste the best- and so on.  And Thai food is an excellent place to start- and I can make specific recommendations here (www.shesimmers.com, www.khaomangai.com, www.thaifoodmaster.com, the youtube channels ""mark wiens"", ""hot thai kitchen"" or ""pailins kitchen"" on youtube, and... actually, those are the ones in English- and I don't think you speak Thai?).  But it's far from the only cultural bodies of knowledge like this that exist, and there are many to explore.    My second favorite that I recommend is ""traditional American"" food, which I use that term to refer to bodies of knowledge that surround several specific and related <but distinct> kinds of cooking: the first is the native tribal foods using the indigenous ingredients from the American continents: if you've ever wondered why it's called ""Beef Jerky"", this is why. It refers to a cooking and seasoning process from the carribean called ""charouk"", which was a process of smoking- particularly fish, but also any animal that was eaten, so that the dry meat would be both aromatic and flavorful (thanks to spices such as sassafras, in the continental US, and allspice leaves and berries), and which was subsequently adapted to the species (or 'ingredients') that europeans introduced- such as pigs and cattle- which became known variously as ""Boucan"" <french>, ""Barabacoa"" <spanish/catalan/portuguese>, and ""barbecue"" <english and the germanic languages>.  So, there's a science to this, which I referred to in my comment above but didn't detail- but fortunately, it's very simple.  See, your tongue only has (depending on your ancestry) between 5 and 8 kinds of taste buds.  Southeast asians have some extra ones, south asians have others, sub-saharan africans have their own set, etc.  It's almost as if we're a species that's still evolving.  But the 5 you can guarantee everybody has are: sweet <sugar>, sour <acids and bases>, salty <salts>, bitter <a *huge* category, mostly involving compounds in vegetables>, and Umami <meat/broth/some mushrooms>. There are certainly other 'tastes'- like 'spicyness' or 'freshness' (think chili peppers or mint)- but these don't actually have taste buds, but are typified by acting directly on your nerve receptors or other cells for specific effects- for example, 'spicyness' is a histamine reaction, just like cat allergies- so don't snort chili flakes. <side note: some of the taste buds that the other groups have let them pick up specific categories of compounds that are undetectable to the phenotypical population- things like polyphenols in wines, which cause the 'legs' in the wine glass and so on.>  Once you know this, you suddenly know what your five 'targets' are, and what your other 'option' flavors are, and the meals simply become a matter of 'pressing the flavor buttons' that you want to press.  interconnected with all of this is the interaction between taste and smell- which is where you get really 'sophisticated' flavor and smell pairings, because your nose has all kinds of scent receptors your tongue doesn't, even though they are related.  Which is why ingredients like ginger work- because ginger itself is unpleasantly bitter (and this is the actual general use for it in Thai cooking, for example- it's used as an 'embitterant' in recipes like jok/congee/boiled rice porridge, or in 'pad king' <'stir fry' 'ginger'>, to make the dish more bitter to balance out the other flavors, while also giving a pleasant smell)- but the smell alone is extremely pleasant, and this gets used freqently with sweets in western cooking.  So, anyway, I've mentioned some Thai resources already, and for the rest? I really highly recommend the show ""the mind of a chef"" to illustrate different cultural approaches to balancing flavors. The first season follows a korean american who cut his teeth in japan, and kicks ass- and the second season follows a 'hillbilly' from the southeast US who cooks some proper down home grub. Both are eye-opening, and the show is produced by Anthony Bourdain, who himself travels the world eating exotic things from faraway places on his own show, which is also worth checking out.  Youtube is also full of cooking courses- Gordon Ramsay's ""ultimate cookery course"" or ""the only cooking course you'll ever need"" or whatever it's called is also awesome.  So to illstrate this, the worst fuckup I ever made in the kitchen was mistaking white grape jelly for chicken stock/gravy.  I added about 4 cups of grape jelly to what's called ""Massaman curry""- a recipe I know backwards and forwards, and which I (srsly) can beat most Thai restaurants at.  But because of the 'taste buttons' concept, I was able to adjust for the sudden ""mysterious sweetness"" in my pot with the ingredients in my fridge, and people only asked why it was so sweet after they'd finished their plates and were going back for seconds.  It isn't that I cancelled out the sweetness- no no no- but the sweetness was at an appropriate ratio to the other flavors that I put in the pot, and everybody ate their hearts out.  Nobody had seconds, but everybody finished their <generous> first portions.  So even though it's my biggest and most embarrassing fuckup in the kitchen, it's also something I'm kind of secretly proud of. nobody said ""yuck"", even after we figured out what had happened.  TLDR: Treat cooking like engineering, and ""build flavor"". Don't be afraid of messing up, just balance out whatever you do if it doesn't quite work, because no matter what you do, it will balance out if you correct enough- even with the worst fuckups you can imagine- so long as the ingredients in the dish are still edible."

Both are favorites of my similarly anti-veggie bf (who puts up with my mostly vegetarian diet like a champ):  1) Portobello Mushroom Pizzas: FAST, easy, and pretty healthy (basically veggies on veggies).   2 large Portobello mushrooms, wiped clean and gills removed (scrape them out with a spoon) marinara sauce (I make mine from scratch and hide even more veggies inside) toppings (e.g. sliced onions, sliced peppers, olives, spinach/kale/chard, pineapple, pepperoni/ham/sausage, etc.) mozzarella cheese   Directions: Preheat oven to 375 F. Bake the mushroom caps face-up for 5 mins. Remove and add sauce, toppings, and cheese. Bake for an additional 20 mins or until the caps are tender and the cheese is golden brown.   2) Vegetarian chili: A huge favorite of both me and my bf. Full of flavor, extremely versatile (you can basically add any veggies you'd like as substitutes... in fact I just made this with only root vegetables the other day and it was fantastic), and super easy if done in a crock pot.   2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 large yellow onion, chopped 1 red bell pepper, chopped * 2 cloves garlic, minced 3 serrano chili peppers, minced 1 medium zucchini, diced * 2 cups frozen corn * 1 ½ lbs mushrooms, cubed * 2 tbsp chili powder 1 tbsp ground cumin 1 ¼ tsp salt ¼ tsp cayenne pepper 32 oz diced tomato 3 cups black beans, drained and rinsed 1 (15oz) can tomato sauce 1 cup vegetable stock or water ¼ cup cilantro, chopped   *These veggies can be subbed OR you can add more veggies and less beans, etc. Just note the cooking times with different things: for example, with my root veggies I let this cook on high in the crock pot for 8 hrs. But when I use zucchini/mushrooms/peppers/softer things I usually just make it on the stove and it's done after simmering for 20-30 mins without being too mushy.  Directions: In a large pot heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and serranos and cook until soft, about 4 mins. Add the zucchini, corn, and mushrooms, and cook until all of the vegetables are soft, about 6 mins. Add the spices, salt, tomato, beans, sauce, and stock. Mix well and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for at least 20 mins. Remove from heat and add cilantro.  Serve with rice and cheese, sour cream, or hot sauce as garnish."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,bleakmidwinter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"I think our grilling is what Americans call broiling. Where you have a heating element at the top of the oven and you place the food a couple of inches below it. And your grilling is frying to us. The word fry to us can mean a few different things, so we usually specifying if its gently frying/stir frying with just a splash of oil, shallow frying or deep fat frying. So whenever I see a recipe on here, I have to work out which it means!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cjn86,bleakmidwinter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:29:57 2015 UTC,Frying seems to mean similar things in both places actually.  Broiling would work too.  But I like cooking with fire.  So charcoal is what I would recommend.

You can cheat on the cream if you want to (a little milk instead of the cream+water is ok for a cheap/healthy alt.. may take a little trial/error but worth it!), but make sure you use proper lemons!  Also a simple stir fry with M/O/P's, tomatoes can taste surprisingly great you can add almost anything.. some things I did regularly; carrots (grated), gherkins (sliced), spinach, cucumber (sliced+diced), lettuce (shredded, either slightly wilted in the pan or added after). If you want to bulk it up potato cubes can be great. Then of course there's chicken/bacon/cheese/garlic you can add as you choose. Basically there are 100 variations and it always surprised me how nice a bunch of veggies cooked together would taste. Bunch of options with herbs too (eg cumin).  A tuna dish is another one that's great with mushrooms and peppers, can make a very quick healthy snack or lunch; cook mushrooms (sliced, many), mix with tuna, add raw peppers (diced finely), optionally mayo/cheese, spices (possibly egg?).

Some of the more common one you might not like so you have to try all kinds/qualities to see what you like.    Try making a vegetarian/vegan meal once a week to test out flavors.  You can make cauliflower rice instead of using rice. Use your food processor to get it to the consistency of rice and cook in a pan.  You can use squash (zucchini, crookneck) as pasta or you can cook spaghetti squash! cook up spinach/tomatoes/broccoli/ etc and throw it into your eggs in the morning.  experiment with cooking methods. I love green beans but I hate them canned/or steamed. I saute them with olive/salt/pepper until they are al dente. Grill your veggies if they are big enough. Focus on taste and texture.  Add sauce. Lemon butter is a good one. Find some healthy sauces and douse the mother-fuckers.   A recipe my husbands co-worker just gave us was great. Take a zucchini or two and cut in half length wise. Cut some slits and wedge some fresh garlic in there. Cut up a little more garlic and rub down with the chopped garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil. Roast in oven at 350 for 30 minutes? well until tender. (If you can easily slide a knife in, you're good). While thats a-roastin', toast up some pine nuts and cut up some sun dried tomatoes (got mine in a jar from TJS). When the squash is done, pull it out and put on the pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes and big dollops of goat cheese chevre. Throw it back in the oven for like 5/7 minutes.

Make sure the recipes don't look like too much work.  Then start trying the recipes and find some favorites that you could make once a week.    http://www.budgetbytes.com might be a good one for you.

Most veggies fresh or veggies of a particular strain can taste significantly better than their store bought counterparts.  Maybe try a farmers market to get the good stuff.

Whenever I make meals for friends who claim they don't like veggies very much, I make this:  I roast vegetables (sometimes just one or sometimes a mix) like butternut squash, zucchini, cauliflower, red onions, sweet potato, broccoli, brussels sprouts, etc.   I use a decent amount of olive oil, course salt and pepper and some fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary. I throw a few whole garlic cloves on the tray too.   Then I roast at 400ºF for about 25-30 minutes (depending on veggie and size of cut) until they are brown and caramelized and smell like heaven. That roasted flavor is so delicious and the seasoning on it is similar to what you would do for meat so it's familiar.  I definitely converted a few veggiphobes this way!"

Keep it covered and turn the heat down to medium for a few minutes.   Uncover and mix the kale around.   Add some garlic powder (maybe 1 tsp) and some sesame seeds (1 tsp) and stir some more.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3coym0,Harleequin,3,Thu Jul 9 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"Meal planning is the biggest start. Before shopping, write out what meals you're going to make for the week. Since its just you, try to think of meals that'll use the same ingredients.   Example: on Monday you'll make chicken and fried rice but you'll set aside cooked unfried rice so that on Thursday, you'll make chicken burritos with leftover rice.   You could also freeze most leftovers so that you have a quick option instead of eating out. This also greatly reduces the amount of leftovers you throw away. I freeze just about all pasta sauces, chili and soups, breads, burritos etc.   Then, when you go shopping, stick to your list. Add in any snacks that you eat regularly or things you'll need around the house.  I'm new to this sub so I don't have a lot of advice on organizing your budget and meals in one spot. However, I know pintrest has a ton of ""meal planning"" documents you can print out and fill in. You really won't know a reasonable budget for yourself until you go shopping."

It shows some of the healthier food options you should be eating and which ones to eat in moderation, and which to try to avoid save for ""cheat days/meals"".   A simple way to figure out the cost per meal is to add up the cost of all the ingredients you used to make it, then divide it by the amount of meals you get out of it. At the store, keep an I on the price per ounce/lb of foods. You'll quickly see that most drinks, packaged foods are pretty high and won't keep you full. The common advice is to buy the bulk of your meals from the outer permitter of the food section and stay away from the aisles in the center. Best of luck!"

Do any of your grocers have bulk sections?  I'm also living on $10-15 a week currently and I generally just buy produce from the reduced section (such as ripe bananas, big bags of potatoes and onions, etc.) and get my staples such as lentils, pinto beans, rice, and flour from the bulk sections.

Also you want to look at their discount area's. Many grocery stores I know will sell a decent size bag of veggies/fruit and bread for like $2 or less (not to get your hopes up but I have paid 60 cents for 6 medium sized zucchinis that probably had 3 days left to it) . Instead of going to the grocery store every day (cause they don't always do it everyday so you can ask them when they get their shipments in and go the day before; if that grocery store even does it)  you can freeze these products instead.  freezing them should give you that extra month to use it. Like another comment has wrote don't waste money on meat, but also don't spend too much on fruit either and nothing for juice.  You can get bananas for fairly cheap though if you really need a fruit. You can also cut those banana's up and freeze them as well.   Like comments before; rice, canned food, ramen. get eggs if you can, oatmeal, sometimes you can find a huge bag of spinach and parts of that you can freeze (just double bag it before freezing) and you can find freezing bags at dollar stores.

Even with milk and extras that is less than 10p for breakfast for me!   Here's a good Bombay mix recipe. You can make a big batch of it and keep it in an airtight container for a few weeks! The ratios of the fruit and nuts aren't that important, so if you've not got many peanuts but loads of cashews, that's ok.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cl7qb,bcrabill,3,Thu Jul 9 05:07:46 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem.  Got three stones in two years in college. The trick is to cook for yourself instead of eating take out and junk food.  When you cook for yourself, YOU control the sodium. I barely use any sodium these days and I'm now fairly sensitive to it.  Often times, you can avoid bland food by having a well stocked spice rack.  When I cook many recipes, I often reduce the salt to half or a quarter, and sometimes amp up the spices a little bit.  Cooking from scratch gives you the most control because a lot of premade sauces and stuff have shitloads of salt.  There ARE often low sodium alternatives to many products and these will be especially important for anything that comes in a jar or a can.  Plain canned black beans can have 15-20% of your salt while the low sodium ones can have 2%.  Trader Joe's is pretty great for low sodium stuff btw.  They have really unhealthy stuff, but their low-sodium stuff is great and well priced.  you need to start reading the labels of everything you eat.  Pay special attention to serving size.  Many super unhealthy foods will be listed as multiple servings even though it's something you would routinely eat one or two of in a sitting.  You will be shocked about where you'll see high salt content.    Many junk foods (chips, salty frozen things, fast food, and Asian take out) are just things that need to be CUT OUT or eaten once every few months.  This could be tough at first if you have a crappy diet, but after a month or two, you'll notice you don't crave salty fried things much any more.  The biggest tip I can give you is to do 90% of your grocery shopping around the outer rim of the store.  Most of the pre-processed salt added foods are located in the middle.  The outer edge is produce, fresh/frozen meats, and dairy in most groceries.  Your shopping cart should be like 75% fruits and veggies.  Sorry for rambling.  But there's some good advice in there.  I haven't had a stone in about 4 years"

Mrs. Dash spice mixes are excellent because I don't believe any of them contain any salt and there's a huge variety.  I also like making curry because it doesn't need any salt.    One note I forgot about, is to get that citric acid, start drinking more lemonade and water with lemon.  Just make sure you take care of your teeth because it can be tough on your enamel if you go overboard."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cl7qb,Its_free_and_fun,2,Thu Jul 9 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"I have found that if you want to practice and learn to do things like homemade pizza, homemade noodle dishes (using plain asian noodles) they're not too hard to do, and you have so much more control over your sodium, and it still will taste awesome. The salt is used to make processed food shelf stable, and taste good even though it may sit for weeks and months. Doing the same thing fresh eliminates that need (like making homemade tomato sauce for pizza, for example.  If you eat any canned vegetables, switch to frozen, canned beans learn how to soak them overnight, thats where a lot of sneaky sodium comes from. Canned soups are pretty bad, but soup as a concept in general is not inherently ""bad for you."" I don't have any ramen in front of me to look at the package, I don't know if the noodles are salted after they're fried, but a good start is to throw the seasoning packet away, and try and flavor them a different way.. Better is to buy plain noodles in the asian section, and read the back to make sure they don't have added flavoring...  If your chips are British chips, making homemade oven fries isn't too hard, and you can control the sodium, if it's american chips, try switching to something else crunchy like cut veggies?  Basically, you need to read labels. Sorry, it's no fun, but it's good practice for the rest of your life.  Also, I had no idea sriracha had so much sodium.. you can still get the heat if you start using fresh peppers, or read labels and find a hot sauce with lower sodium?

I made this place, so I do know what I am talking about. Down to 169 as of today and hiked 22 miles this past weekend. If I can do it, so can you. Talk to me everyday if you have to.   Here is what you are going to eat tomorrow. Exactly half of what you ate today. I know it is going to kill you (mentally) but you have to be strong and get your stomach smaller (insides not the outsides). This takes up to a month, but you have to cut back on caloric intake. You know that is the right answer. So do it. Report back tomorrow."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,momof2poms,8,Wed Jul 8 21:33:57 2015 UTC,The key to all this is you need a caloric deficit in your life.  I solved this by only eating one meal a day and no snacking.  Was hard for the first week but it's routine.  And remember just because you fell off your diet one day doesn't mean it's stopped.  You just pick the diet right back up the next day.  Diets are lifestyle changes not nazi regiments.

But the good news is that you can work around it until you get to a point where you've got a wider selection of palatable foods.  Sauces. All sorts of sauces, from tangy to savory to fruity. Take a trip down the condiment aisle and see what looks good to you (and read the nutrition label to make sure it meets your needs). Make a little of something you don't like along with a normal portion of what you do, mix 'em together, add sauce, and see what you think.  Look around here and other subreddits for advice on how to get kids to eat things they don't like. It's the same concept; just apply it to yourself. Also, drink lots of water and go for a short walk every day. Find a reason to get on your feet out of the house and go see stuff. You'll like it, I promise!

Super cheap if you buy dried ones in a bag or bulk. Less cheap if you buy cooked beans in a can.   Some beans require an overnight soak before cooking, others just cook. Read the directions on the bag. Lentils and split peas can go from being dried up in a bag to being hot and tasty in your bowl in about 30-40 minutes.   If you prefer canned and plain beans bore you, sauté some onions in a tiny bit of oil or chicken broth or water until soft and translucent. Then dump in your can of cooked beans. Add a little cumin, garlic, whatever seasonings you enjoy. Simmer for maybe 20 minutes. The beans get super soft, almost creamy, and the onions and seasonings kick up the flavor a notch.   Cooked lentil soup with chopped cooked veggies in it, ladled over a bowl of cooked brown rice  is super healthy, filling and cheap."

If you are at risk of diabetes - the diets for diabetics want you to stay away from starchy vegetables because they process like sugar (Potatoes, Peas, corn - though baby corn is OK, parsnips, pumpkin, squash, zucchini and yams).  I know that can be tough - being low sodium myself - and being picky on the veg side, i tend to go to sweet potatoes for the vitamins in them)."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,chucks138,6,Wed Jul 8 01:42:44 2015 UTC,"No problem. For foods you like, sounds like you've got carbs figured out pretty well. If rice isn't your thing, just about anything you can throw on rice you can throw on pasta, so look at recipes on the bags and boxes at the store and around here. The best resource I can think of is budgetbytes. You'll know what you like when you see it, and don't be afraid to tweak the recipes or ask for help tweaking. Try making a cookbook out of them!  When I lived in Japan I discovered some really neat pizza combinations. Try putting the corn on the pizza, or really any veggies you like (may need to soften 'em up a little first and cut them fairly small so they cook right). Pizza is a really good catch-all, like pasta dishes and pilafs or stir fry (make sure to go light on the oil there, but it's definitely doable).  You might also consider keeping a calorie diary or trying something like myfitnesspal. That's the one I use to help me lose weight; it calculates macros for you so you can get an idea about what you need to eat more/less off. Big Caveat Consult a doctor before any strict dietary changes; don't want to tip over into diabetic or cause other troubles!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,AdmiralMango,6,Wed Jul 8 01:49:44 2015 UTC,"I 100% back myfitnesspal on these - if he is trying to keep a low sodium diet things like Pizza are almost totally out of the question though - most breads sit between 350-600mg sodium, cheese per oz is normally 300-500 mg/sodium - so a home made pizza depending on other toppings can end up 1200+mg per serving (not full pizza) which is normally more than people on low sodium diets are allowed."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,chucks138,4,Wed Jul 8 14:34:03 2015 UTC,"That's so, and you can definitely make the crust out of other things to mitigate the sodium if you're willing to learn to cook. I suggested it thinking it would be a good transition food; you don't go from picky to eating everything overnight.  There are options during the transition for cutting sodium, so I don't think it would be too bad. Just requires some attention to detail."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,WeFosterKittens,2,Wed Jul 8 15:10:43 2015 UTC,Oh absolutely - it just matters depending on how quickly you have to cut for health reasons.   I know people who had to be low sodium because they'd gain 10 lbs (in water weight) in 24 hours - granted that came from heart issues.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,alias_enki,12,Wed Jul 8 20:05:14 2015 UTC,"If you want to lose weight you don't need to eat 'better', you need to eat less. You can eat 'better', but if still you're eating too much, you're still getting too many calories = still fat, so nothing has really changed. You can eat garbage, and as long as it's within your daily calorie limit, you'll lose weight.  Your portion sizes are probably too large. You're probably doing a lot of snacking that you may not even notice. If you change nothing but reducing your portion size, and don't undermine that by snacking more, you will lose weight.  Eating healthier food makes it easier to eat more and have it not be 'too much', because for example carrot sticks are less calorically dense, by volume, than a donut or chocolate or a large iced cappuccino with whipped cream.  On the other hand, carrot sticks may not satisfy you in the same way that chocolate does. Satiety signals - the various hormones that regulate appetite, aka. your stomach and digestive tract telling your brain that you're hungry or full - are a complex subject that I'm not at all well-studied in. But I've read that fat and protein stimulate the release of the hormone CCK, which acts as a hunger suppressant. So some hunger is purely mental, like deciding you want ice cream, or seeing an ad for pizza on TV. But some hunger is biological. However, both can be overcome with willpower.  If you want to eat less, you will need willpower. Breaking habits is hard. Being hungry is hard. For the first couple of days you'll feel fucking hungry all the time. But then your stomach will shrink, and your satiety signals will start to even out. You need to figure out when to listen to your body and when to ignore it - and how to ignore it.  I suggest finding a type of tea you like - no sugar. There are a zillion kinds. Tea is cheap and has basically no calories. A hot drink is a good substitute for a snack. Water works, but is more boring. Coffee works, but caffeine may be an issue. Milk-based drinks are bad for this purpose because there is actually a lot of nutrition in milk.  Cultural factors may make eating less more difficult. If you're alone, it's easier to decide that you had a muffin and a milkshake at 5pm, so you aren't hungry and don't actually want dinner. If you eat socially, if you always sit down for lunch/dinner with your family, this may mean that they're expecting you to eat a meal when you actually aren't feeling hungry. If your grandma is the type to equate food with love and always push a second helping on you, you need to figure out how to deal with that. If you find yourself habitually walking into the kitchen and opening the fridge every time you get bored and your mind wanders, you need to break that habit.  I suggest doing a little research on how many calories you should be eating per day, and how many calories there are in dishes you usually eat, common snacks, etc. This may help you make better decisions about what to eat, how much to eat, whether to have that second cookie.  Doing some cooking yourself may help. You mentioned all the food you don't like: it may just be that you don't like the way it's always been prepared for you. I didn't like a lot of vegetables until I started cooking them myself and cooked them properly, rather than overcooking them, eg. properly blanched nice crisp still-green asparagus, not horribly overcooked gross grey mushy asparagus. Brown rice is pretty weak, but if you cook it properly until it's tender, and mix in some high-flavour ingredients like fried onion, chorizo, diced roasted pumpkin or sweet potato, finely chopped herbs, a little butter, ground cumin or sumac, salt to season, it becomes very edible. I use way more spices, seasonings, and herbs than my parents used to, and can cook things to my own taste - which they generally enjoy too, when I cook for them.  Finding some kind of exercise you don't hate doing may also help. More calories burned = more donuts you can eat."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,fivecentpsychiatrist,18,Wed Jul 8 05:34:10 2015 UTC,"low salt, low fat, protein heavy food   So basically starchy foods that taste like sawdust and cardboard.  Why not swing by /r/keto for some healthy, tasty food and a dose of science? Eggs will be your new best friends. White flour/rice etc. are terrible for you. Rice and pasta are going to hurt you and your grandfather. Embrace dietary fat. Kick the carbs to the curb. How do you feel about spinach? I HATE iceberg lettuce and used to shy away from veggies in general, until I found spinach, arugula, romaine, and red leaf lettuce. Eating half of a bad diet isn't going to do anything positive for you. Your body will still pack it away just the same and you'll be left with no energy.

Making this a priority is number one. You're going to have to eat foods you may not like as much as pizza or sweets. Also, keep in mind that it's not just food choices, it's how much you eat.   The things you listed that you hate are not that important in losing weight. You can do this!   1) You said you only like white steamed rice. Try mixing white rice with brown rice 50/50. It's a lot better than just plain brown rice.  2)Eat veggies and fruits that are in season, it will be cheaper.  3)Make sure to count calories, and actually measure and weigh your food. This is where many people go wrong. They just estimate the amount of calories they eat. Don't do this. Make sure to count your calories properly.  4) do meal plans. Make meals in advance, that way you already have cooked meals ready for you.   Do you need help figuring out how many calories to eat in a day? Do you need help with recipes and meals?

And there's a learning curve so don't expect yourself to change all at once. You did great with the sodas, so what can you cut out next?   The further I get the more I realize there's no one size fits all to weight loss. It's tons and tons of tweaking till you figure out what's right for you. You can still be picky if you want.

I gained almost 100 lbs because I was pregnant and stuck on bed rest. If you're coming from a place that extreme (you didn't say), just moving every day at first is a good start. Do it while you tweak your diet. There are calculators to give you a caloric goal to aim for and using sites like myfitnespal can help you immensely.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,uliarliarpantsonfire,5,Wed Jul 8 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"Note: get your heart pumping in moderation. OP sounds smart enough not to decide to try and run a 7-minute mile right off the bat, but sometimes people get overzealous.  I don't have a problem with my weight, fortunately. I do have a slow metabolism, but thankfully my work allows me to jam down 4,000+ calories a day and barely maintain weight. But I have learned a few things in making the changes necessary to my diet:   Eat for what you're doing. If I have a light day, you can be damn sure I'm not going to be choking down a 4-scoop protein shake in the morning before munching on anything pickled I can find throughout the day. Heavy day? Start lean and mean, low carbs and higher fat, avoid sugar, and beast it out. Light day? Lean, small breakfast, moderate fats for lunch, light dinner. Focus on your portion and then consciously note whether you're hungry afterwards or if you just want to keep eating. If you just want to keep eating, distract yourself by engaging your mind in something else. For me, that's reading or scribbling or cleaning or maybe just walking around outside listening to some music. Over time you'll start associating a sated appetite with being full, rather than the physical feeling of it. A lot of modern foods are actually engineered to trick your body into not feeling like its had enough. Ever wonder why you could eat a family sized bag of doritos without feeling full, then you felt pretty bad later? Texture plays a huge part in your body knowing when to stop, and modern food makers are good at skirting that. Not that it's intrinsically bad, but there's a reason why I can eat a whole box of twinkies, and it's not just because I love em. Focus on your goals. Not just the big ones. The little ones matter just as much, if not more- without them, the larger goal is nebulous and unattainable. Everything happens by small increments, improving your health is no different. (Says the Full Throttle chugging pack-a-day blue collar worker.) Start exploring. Don't be afraid to get a little inventive. Hate lentils? Try using them as a base for something else so you don't taste them. Don't like the texture? Mash those bitches up and then use them to thicken a nice, healthy soup. You'll be surprised. As you get further along, your tastes will change. If you don't eat candy and drink a ton of sodas, an orange is suddenly just as sweet as any poet ever claimed, and plums are just downright scandalous. Don't be afraid to go back and revisit things a little way down the road; what you didn't enjoy may then seem absolutely delicious, or at least not so disgusting that you couldn't eat it every now and then for variety's sake. Relearn what your body is telling you. For myself, I have a bad habit of instantly assuming I'm hungry. For me, that's bad- if I'm out of the snacks I brought with me to the jobsite, that means gas station snacks. I sweat a lot, so a pickle won't hurt me. But what chance does a pickle stand against my favorite junk foods? None. So if I'm feeling ""hungry,"" I hit a gulp of gatorade and drink some water. If I'm still hungry a little after, then I know I specifically need some fats or proteins to pick me up, and that makes it a lot easier to control myself because then I'm craving a specific fuel. Which means almonds. And I love me some fucking almonds, son.   Overall, your mindset is great and your intentions are good. Start moving around. Walk for 10 minutes a day. If you feel good after that, walk 15 the next day. When you find your limit, keep doing it until it's easier. But please note that your limit is not failure- it's exertion. Can't do it without losing your breath a little? That's your limit. If you hate sweating, learn to love it, or at least endure it. You won't smell good, you'll look like shit, and you'll likely feel like shit. But we all do when we've exerted ourselves. I spend a lot of time laying on my bedroom floor after peeling off clothes that are drenched in sweat and just generally wondering why the fuck I do it, but you know what? I'm proud that I can do it, and you should be too. That little ache in your muscle the day after you really get on it? That feeling of sweat in your eyes? That's raw accomplishment. And if I can do it, you sure as fuck can.  I haven't been in your situation exactly, but if you need help with cooking, feel free to message me, or if you need tips for getting in shape I can help you out there. I will tell you that you should consult with your doctor to establish a baseline for performance, though. Find out what you can safely do in terms of exertion. I've watched a few of my friends pull back from the situation you're in, and I'm proud as hell of them for it. But more importantly, so are they."

Your tastes will change, and I wish I'd have known that when I started cutting out sugar because it would've seemed so much less overwhelming than the idea that I'd be giving all the good stuff up forever.  After a couple of months of a low sugar diet, I genuinely stopped liking milk chocolate, ice cream, even white bread and pasta.  Now I don't eat healthily because I have to, I do it because it tastes better AND I get to feel better."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,kill_me_plz,3,Wed Jul 8 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"Few things. Start exercising. A lot of psychologists refer to it as a keystone habit. Learning to work out, eat better, sleep better, dress better, etc when it comes to self-improvement are all really hard to do, however! Scientists have found that some good habits make other good habits easier to pick up and exercising was one of them. If you exercise more, suddenly eating fast food seems a little off since you don't wanna ruin your good vibes from your work out. So if you start exercising, willpower will become less of an issue in the other realms. Secondly, you've conditioned your diet to favor high carbs and high starch. Slowly wean and change your diet towards more complex carbs/fibers and more mineral-vitamin rich foods. It's hard but if you sustain it, you'll find that your sense of taste will actually change. This happens to a lot of people who give up sugar or soda and then stop the regimen. They find things are too sweet for them because their taste buds are sensitized to sugar again."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,alias_enki,2,Thu Jul 9 04:55:14 2015 UTC,"Good job on the soda. The objective will be to consume fewer calories than you burn. To do this, it will help to cut carbs out of your diet and use a calorie monitoring app like myfitnesspal. The hard part will be sticking with it, but if other people can do it, so can you. Picky eaters can train themselves to eat healthily. But first you need to learn how to eat the foods you already like in a more healthy way. Baby steps. Use Supercook to help you figure out what recipes you can make using foods you like, that you already have. But remember, lower your carb, increase protein, get some veggies in, and it helps to get moving a little every day. Learn to cook for yourself, don't depend on your mom. You can do it."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,TakenByVultures,2,Wed Jul 8 07:05:06 2015 UTC,"if you can begin to enjoy wholegrain versions of carbs it will make your life easier.  Wholegrain bread, rice and pasta do taste different but eventually if you force yourself to eat them and don't keep the white/processed equivalents in the house you will at least be able to tolerate them.  My favourite way is to follow a simple day formula which can be manipulated as needed:  Breakfast: 1-2 eggs (poached/boiled/scrambled) + 1-2 slices of wholemeal toast  Snack: Small handful of nuts (preferably almonds) and a small piece of fruit  Lunch: 200g (weight before cooking) of lean protein (ie. chicken, quorn etc.) small portion of whole grain carbohydrates (100-->150g cooked weight) Lots of vegetables  Snack: small handful of nuts small piece of fruit (i like to eat this after dinner as a desert)  Dinner: 200g (weight before cooking) of lean protein (ie. chicken, quorn etc.) small portion of whole grain carbohydrates (100-->150g cooked weight) Lots of vegetables  You can vary the veg, protein and type of carbohydrates, add some dipping sauces for the meat, my go to for lunch/dinner was chicken breast, wholegrain rice, frozen broad beans, frozen peas, salad onions and carrot.  The nuts as a snack are great as they have a quite high level of un-saturated fats, which means that they satisfy hunger without having to eat too many!  Also, exercise is key, aerobic and weight work is invaluable and helps you to feel better too :)"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,BlueAjah238,2,Wed Jul 8 10:55:45 2015 UTC,"For me I find that small changes help. You can't change everything all at once, it's unlikely to stay. You need a full life style change. It sounds like the food your grandmother makes is appropriate for what you want to do you just need to practice portion control. Also a physical activity regiment is a good idea. If you can't run start with walking. I find weight training fun.   On the picky eating thing. Sometimes I eat things I don't like to get the nutrients I need. Sometimes you just have to gut it out. The point you are at five mins of bad taste is worth it when you are looking at possible major health issues.  If you want to discuss at length feel free to message me. I'm not a health care professional but I care enough to try and help."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,Yellow_giraffe,2,Wed Jul 8 11:09:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I hear you. I'm a picky eater. Is it flavor, or texture that most affects you? For me, I have to deal with both.  My boyfriend is a picky eater and will pick the vegetables out of his food and eat the meat and sauce and bad stuff. When I go over to his place for dinner, he never makes side dishes or a salad.  He asks for double cheese on French onion soup, and it is so disgusting I want to gag. I'm trying so hard to work with him, as he is encouraging bad habits for me.   I found portion control to be of help. Also trying to substitute healthier options. There are some interesting substitutes for pizza crust - cauliflower is popular. I also like halving a zucchini, topping it with a few slices of turkey pepperoni, a bit of shredded Parmesan, and a few sundried tomatoes, then baking till it's the right texture for me.   I love steamed veggies. Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, zucchini. They have to be a little overcooked/soft, but not too soggy. I adjusted myself to eating them by putting a slice of veggie with a slice of meat (or some rice, potato, whatever) on my fork at the same time.   I love edamame. Steamed with garlic and red pepper flakes and a little sesame oil. Again, took some time to get used to. I used shelled edamame in salads to begin with.  Another good thing is quinoa. Like rice, but healthier. There are some flavored quinoa packs that come with seasonings  in them. Again, it took me time to adjust to (bite of meat, forkful of quinoa, chew and swallow).   Substitute healthier ingredients. There was a recipe that was popular a year or two ago where you took a box of cake mix and a can of pumpkin (like for pie filling) and mixed them to make muffins.  Using Greek yogurt for certain things is so good. I had a chicken Parmesan recipe that called for mixing Greek yogurt, a little grated Parmesan and some herbs and then spreading it over chicken breasts, then baking. It turned out amazing.   You say you don't like spicy foods. Is it the heat? Or the seasonings? You can have mild food that is so flavorful. Indian food springs to mind. McCormicks makes some seasoning blends for entrees. You buy the meat and whatever other ingredients are listed on the spice package. So yummy.   Don't deny yourself the treats - just make them small (a single Hershey kiss, for example). Learn to read the labels on things. Check Pinterest for ideas for recipes and substitutions; there are so many amazing recipes I've found via Pinterest that I love. See about helping your grandmother cook, or offer to cook by yourself. I know I feel better about what I eat if I prepare it and familiarize myself with it. I also notice a huge difference when using fresh (not canned, not pre-packaged/pre-made) foods.   It's rough trying to eat healthy, especially when you have specific likes/dislikes. If you haven't tried something in a long time, try it again. I've found foods I disliked years ago don't seem to bother me as much as I've grown up."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3chww2,Yellow_giraffe,2,Wed Jul 8 11:50:27 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar boat: about 30lbs overweight, recently diagnosed with hypertension, and just really like eating good food and drinking good beer.  Moderating caloric intake wasn't too difficult to me once I really made the mental decision to lose weight. I was a grill cook in college and had some decent cooking skills, but doing it as a job made me hate doing it. My downfall was seemingly making boring meals (i.e. quinoa, broccoli, and chicken--everyday) or planning boring meals. Knowing that I was going to be eating boring things would just give me the urge to eat out instead. Eating out and sticking to a healthy diet is so, so difficult.  What really helped me turn the table was deciding to cook at home at least 6 days a week. I increased my food budget for grocery shopping and started making plans to make good, healthy meals. Splurged a bit to make sure I had all of the cooking tools I needed/wanted, and started going to every night. I follow a rather Mediterranean style diet so I eat a lot of vegetables, fish, etc.  There are some incredible recipes that you would certainly enjoy, but you just need to take the time to make them. Planning is key. Go in Pinterest or the Interwebs and find recipes that you think you will like. Print them out and make your own Recipe book of /u/frerard4life taste buds approved. Plan your meals out so you know all of the ingredients you'll need for the following week (or next few days if you don't mind shopping twice a week). Make enough for dinner so you have a bit left over for lunch the next day.  Since changing my mentality about cooking and starting to exercise, I'm down roughly 50lbs and starting to feel healthy again. I enjoy eating at home more than ever and am currently training for a half marathon. I HIGHLY recommend checking out the folks at /r/c25k. That sub can be life changing if you stick with it.  tl;dr - You like food. Just find recipes that suit your taste buds. Plan your meals out to reduce the burden of grocery shopping and cooking."

The trick to losing weight is eat less calories than you burn. That's it. It's really that simple. If you eat more than you burn, you'll carry on putting on weight.   Now - where healthy food comes in, it that it's usually low in calories.. So it tends to fill you up more. A grilled chicken breast and some roast vegetables may only be a few hundred calories and can satisfy you for a few hours - whereas that single cheeseburger from McD's may have the same amount of calories, but only satisfy you for 30 minutes.  Start tracking your daily calorie intake and weight on an app like MyFitnessPal. Log EVERYTHING you eat or drink. And I mean EVERYTHING.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cfklj,jasondossett,21,Tue Jul 7 15:03:12 2015 UTC,"Just a little tip - if you have a decent pan/cast iron, simply dabbing a paper towel with oil and rubbing a preheated pan will grease it enough to cook off onions, and in this case, probably the cauliflower rice as well. If you dump cold ingredients into cold oil (like she does in the video), you aren't going to get that really nice sear on your ingredients (as you are basically boiling your ingredients in oil). It cuts out some calories (not a ton but it adds up over time), and your food will come out much nicer in my opinion."

I've also made the cauliflower crust pizza. The only complaint I have is that recipes like this are quite fussy and time-consuming and create more dirty dishes/mess than basic rice. And rice is way, way cheaper than cauliflower where I live, and we don't have Trader Joe's either.. I know, I know.. everyone here will have different definitions of cheap and I'm not saying this recipe is expensive per se, but rice is going to be cheaper in most places. Plus keeps better over time. I totally get that these recipes are great options for low-carb people but I think unless you have a dietary reason to not eat rice (totally understandable if you do), I think most people will find it easier and cheaper to just make regular rice. Just my opinion.. sometimes these work-around recipes that are like ""pizza that's not pizza"" or ""rice that's not rice"" end up being very fussy and time intensive and not really worth the supposed benefit over the time saved if you had just made regular rice, or regular brownies or pizza or whatever. So if you don't mind that, go ahead. Another option if you're worried that white rice isn't healthy enough is to consider brown rice for more fiber, or look into one of those blends that have a mix of brown rice, wild rice, quinoa, whatever."

I did ~1cm². Dice 600g of eggplant. About 1.5-2cm² worked well for my version. Chop 400g of cup (white) mushrooms into quarters. If using fresh ginger, grate about 10-15g. If using fresh garlic, mince 3 cloves. Heat 2 tsp oil in a large pan or pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, and ginger, and sauté until soft and translucent (about 5-7 minutes). Add the eggplant and mushrooms to your pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until the eggplant is soft and the mushrooms have released all their moisture and cooked down. The pan I was using was a bit small for the sheer volume of veg, so I had to cook it (stirring constantly) for just over 20 minutes. Your experience may vary depending on the size of the pan you use. Add 1/2 tsp turmeric, 2 - 2.5 tbsp curry powder, and salt to taste. Stir through and sauté a minute more until spices are very fragrant. Pour in a 400g can of crushed tomatoes and mix well. Add 300mL of light coconut milk. Mix thoroughly. Test for balance of spices, and once the mixture is heated through, serve immediately!    Makes 3 enormous or 4 normal servings (but at 250kcal for an enormous serving...why wouldn't you?). This curry is delicious on its own, over rice, or over naan/chapati."

And then serve the sauce with pasta.  Or hide them in a strongly flavored soup, like chili.    I like sweet peppers in stir fry - again, you're mixing them with a strong sauce.

Some of these recipes don't traditionally have pepper in them but I usually put some in...   lasagne or spaghetti bolognaise special fried rice (which can be served with seasoned and fried meat or a more complex Chinese dish) paella and risottos. I love adding peppers to a roasted butternut squash risotto as it adds a bit more colour, flavour and texture. Just dice the squash, add a couple cloves of crushed garlic, salt, pepper and sprinkle of sage. Add a drizzle of oil and roast on 180c until soft. While its roasting, fry onion and pepper. Then add risotto rice and a bit of stock at a time. Stir often and have it gently bubbling. When they're both cooked, mash half of the squash, and stir into the risotto. Serve the cubes on top. One squash makes about 4-6 portions. It can be frozen as cubes or mashed. chilli con carne - meat or bean."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3chabt,carlaacat,4,Wed Jul 8 01:31:07 2015 UTC,"Make your own chicken stock. Your local butcher should sell chix bones for no more than $2/lb... Now, once your stock is done, and strained. Reduce the fuck out of it. Simmer it for hours until it gets kinda dark and viscous... You have to make your own chix stock for this to work, because the prepackaged stuff, for one doesn't have much flavor, has too much salt, and most importantly doesn't have as much naturally occurring gelatin.  Now, in a separate pan, put some color on some minced garlic, ginger, and scallion. Don't burn, but do caramelize a little bit... Then deglaze with cheap sake (Sho Chiku Bai is like $6/bottle), reduce au sec and add your reduced chicken stock. Season with both reduced sodium soy sauce, and dark soy sauce (I prefer this stuff, total umami bomb)... A little rice wine vinegar, and just a little glucose or corn syrup just to mellow out the acidity and add a little extra viscosity. Now, you could also use a corn-starch slurry here, but I personally hate the texture of slurry-thickened sauces, so I would much rather just reduce it more to my desired viscosity. This concentrates the flavors as well, so beware of your salt content.  If it tastes flat, contrary to popular belief, MSG is not bad for you. And makes shit taste better without making it saltier.  This is better because you get more umami, and viscosity from naturally occuring gelatin in homemade chix stock without needing too much added salt. This will keep for 10-14 days in the fridge, or indefinitely in the freezer."

I'm looking for the best way to establish a food regime, stick to it, and avoid ""stress eating"" and putting on a ton of weight.    You guys have some great suggestions, keep 'em coming if you can!

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cgyvi,0anonymous1,11,Tue Jul 7 20:52:59 2015 UTC,Get a crockpot and bean it up my friend. (Assuming you don't have a stove.)
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cgyvi,mondo_balordo,11,Tue Jul 7 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"ok that's not a lot of money for 2 weeks, but with a little planning it can be done. I have a son in college and so I have a little bit of knowledge in this area:  1) Get familiar with coupons and buy only what's on sale. Make sure you shop around to get the biggest bang for your buck and check out grocers that will accept competitors coupons. And don't forget about Amazon. See if they deliver groceries in your area. Shipping is free with a Prime membership (if you have one or have access to one)  2) This may seem counterintuitive, but if you have a Costco membership, consider shopping there for certain meats, like chicken, hamburger meat, etc. You should check the prices before you go to make sure it won't eat into half your budget, but you can buy meat in bulk and freeze it and that might be worth it. You'll get plenty to last for 2 weeks. They do also carry organic, there.  3) Invest in a crock pot. You can cook in bulk with few ingredients and that can help stretch your meal plans out. If you don't know any crock pot recipes, google can help with that. Crockpot soups are another great way to use a crockpot.  4) Look for things that can help bulk your meals, like rice, pasta and potatoes. Make sure (and this is the mom in me) that you are getting enough protein and veggies, however.  5) Frozen fruit may be more economical than fresh. Costco also carries large bags of blueberries and strawberries that are inexpensive.  6) Eggs are a great source of protein and can be used for many things (omelets, frittatas, in fried rice, etc). It may be hard to find the free-range/organic eggs in your price point, but if you keep an eye on coupons, you might be able to find some.  7) Soups, casseroles, spaghetti, enchiladas, lasagnas, can all be made cheaply when pared down (you might have to forego fancy cheese in the lasagna for example and just use cheddar) and you can freeze these fairly well for use over the 2 weeks.  8) I made my son mexican chicken in a crock pot using chicken breasts, a can of salsa, and some taco seasoning. Just throw those in a crockpot, cook all day and then shred. He used it for tacos, in lettuce wraps, over rice, in omelettes, etc etc. He got a ton of protein for a few bucks per serving.   9) I am a huge fan of spaghetti squash. It's cheap and makes a great meal filler/ sub for pasta. It takes zero cooking ability also. Google it.  I hope this helps. Let us know if you need any more ideas. I have a ton of them. :)"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cgyvi,msully01,7,Wed Jul 8 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who spent the last three years as a broke college student and only had $50 every two weeks to spend on groceries... this hits the nail on the head. Use coupons, check what's on sale. Plan on using those ingredients that week in addition to your rice, pasta, lentils,  potatoes, etc. Additionally, you can usually buy those kinds of things in bulk, making them even cheaper. I used to buy a big 25lb bag of rice from a local asian grocer for hardly anything.  Favorite quick meal: Make ramen noodle according to package instructions. (Flavoring packet optional.) Drain most but not all of the water. Mix in a few spoonfuls of crunchy peanut butter, a little bit of soy sauce, and a couple of good squirts of sriracha into the pan with the noodles. Cut up a cooked chicken breast to toss in, or eat as is. Sounds crazy, but there's a lot you can do with ramen..."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cgyvi,snorbaluffagus,6,Wed Jul 8 03:10:56 2015 UTC,"eat lots of rice and chicken.  Walmart sells chicken breasts for $2 per pound.  drinks boat loads of water (half your weight in ounces - if you weight 150 lbs, then drink 75 oz per day). If you work out or have any coffee or tea, you need to up that amount.  That will also help you stay full as well as healthy.  Look for bargain fruits at your local markets (organic will be definitely more expensive, so you may need to go conventional). Eat lots of watermelon.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cgyvi,theninjanipples,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:09:00 2015 UTC,"I live in England, where prices are generally much more expensive and get by on less than 15 dollars a week (not including spices I already own). My main tips are - learn to love porridge - I often eat it twice a day.  Beans are you friend - you can usually get a lot of kidney beans or other beans for cheap in bulk - fry them with onions (also cheap) add some spices to make it into a vegetarian chili or curry. Serve with rice.   You can also stretch this even further by adding chick peas in - I eat them most days, they're a good source of protein for carbs. Chick peas are great - with some onion, spice and flour, you can make falafel which is absolutely delicious. You can eat it with rice, couscous, salads, bread etc. etc.  Only drink water - obviously.  Buy chopped tomatoes in tins, they're cheap and can be used as a base for a variety of meals - spag bol, chili, curry etc. Serve with rice.  You can usually get minced beef pretty cheap, look out for offers - can go well with basically anything.  Super market brand noodles aren't great, but you can get them very cheaply and they're so quick and easy; a student staple.  If you need more protein, eggs are probably the way to go. You can get them very cheaply, you can fry them, scramble them, make an omelette etc."

Season the beans as they cook with bay leaves, parsley, oregano, basil, onions, garlic, etc. as desired. If you must have canned beans on hand, Whole Foods has a sodium free line of canned beans.  My mom also watches her salt intake, but I love it, so I've taken to just omitting the salt in everything I cook (not in baking-- salt is necessary for baking chemistry magic) and adding a small amount right at the end and putting more in my bowl.  Investing in some good spices will help you not miss salt as much! Black pepper, onion and garlic powder, basil, oregano, cumin, and chili powder are some of the seasonings that I use the most."

Generally, things are relatively easy to identify (though sometimes it can get tricky, such as when I accidentally bought cornstarch instead of powdered sugar. What? It's a big bag, next to sugar, has a cake on the front. So annoying). Just a heads up, though, if you're buying fruit and veggies, you will need to weigh them before you get to the front (all the main supermarkets do this, I only saw Discount Markt weighing at the register) Hopefully someone will notice you over by the scale, though you may have to find them. They will weigh and put a sticker on the bag for you. The cashiers can get a bit grumpy if you don't."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cfftp,angrycat,5,Wed Jul 8 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"Greece is the ultimate ECAH destination! I spent two weeks there just last month. I was on vacation so I was eating and drinking pretty recklessly and it was still very affordable and very healthy.  The supermarkets (and the country in general) are very multilingual. Every one I went to had aisle signs marked in Greek and English, even in the more traditional/less touristy islands. Most of the products had labels with at least Greek, English and French. Also, everyone working was bilingual to a certain extent, and at least spoke enough english to point you to someone fluent. You'll have no problem finding the stuff you'd normally find in any other super market.  Greek yogurt with fruit and honey makes a good breakfast. The yogurt is pretty different and WAY better than the Greek yogurt you can get in the states.  Eating out is awesome. Pretty much anywhere you go, there will be a lot of fish, octopus and squid-based options, which makes eating healthy very easy. I also ate a lot of goat and chicken. I had a tomato, onion, cucumber, feta greek salad before every meal. Always fresh and delicious.  Also, almost every restaurant will give you free stuff after you pay your bill, usually a shot of a local liquor and a desert (good for the cheap, not so great for the healthy).  Eating out is very cheap too. The most expensive meal I had was 50 Euro (for two people), and that was for a massive seafood grill platter (multiple grilled whole fish, squid, octopus, sides -- the works), cocktails, at least 2 liters of wine (things got fuzzy after the first 1.5L), and multiple appetizers and salads.  Long story short, pretty much everything is very cheap and pretty healthy. If you feel like indulging on the calories at any point, pastitsio and mousakka are sooooo decadently delicious.  Also, unrelated to food, but the Greek people are among the most wonderful and welcoming I've ever experienced and you will have a great time."

We've never got sick even once."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,whiteraven4,4,Tue Jul 7 15:59:12 2015 UTC,I'm always worried that when I smell stuff it's really bad and I just can't tell because my sense of smell isn't very good.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,PurpleHooloovoo,2,Tue Jul 7 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"Depends. If I bought the meat on Wednesday with an expiration date on Thursday, then I take it home and freeze it that night, it's probably fine. If I take it home and wait until Thursday or Friday to freeze it, I would make sure to cook it the same day I thawed it out. Just pretend you froze time when you froze the meat and treat it accordingly. You're basically stopping the decomposition process when you freeze it, and it starts up again when thawed."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,kintyre,7,Tue Jul 7 03:15:48 2015 UTC,"speaking as the child of a grocer the date on food is, pun intended, a movable feast. when i was a kid if food was going out of date/was out of date in the shop that's when it got brought home for us to eat. the best rule is that if food has a best before then it's generally completely safe to use after the date expires, providing there is no obvious mould on it (to be fair though i'll pick the mould off bread if there are only a few spots and toast it). with use by dates you have to be a bit more cautious but again, the smell and signs of decay are usually a good sign. even when it comes to chicken, a thing that a lot of people freak out about can be ok to use a day or two after the date. my mum taught me to wash it under cold water and if the smell completely goes away then it's good to eat."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,triggerhippy,10,Tue Jul 7 07:50:38 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't do that with bread. If there is obvious mold,then the invisible spores are already in the whole bread. That being said, to be honest, I do that, too."

The discounted almost-expired food I can speak for, though, & it's generally so fine you wouldn't even know it was discounted."

I've also had brown flour and brown rice go rancid after too long.  Unprocessed foods that are on sale because they are near or shortly after the best before date can be worth buying - if you have a plan to use them immediately.  I have bought milk and cream at half price and used them to make cheese.  Ripe  fruits and vegetables can be good if you immediately make something that prolongs their life.  Like I've got crates of ripe tomatos on sale and canned the sauce, or bought ripe bananas and made a bunch of muffins for the freezer."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,greeneyesontherise,3,Tue Jul 7 06:08:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on what country youre from or buying from but western countries have a very strong margine for edpiration date. It's something like 40% but varies with food. This means that when the food has aproximately 40 of it's life left, thats the Date they put on it. So this is shorter for bread than for cookies for example."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,JohnoTheFoolish,3,Tue Jul 7 09:01:39 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between 'best by' and 'use before' (or whatever it is exactly called where you live). 'Best by' means exactly what it says, the food keeps it's desired best quality 'guaranteed' till this date. Afterwards quality of taste, texture or consistency can decrease. But it doesn't mean the food becomes unhealthy, just less 'appealing'. Use your senses to check the food, abnormal (bad) smells, color changes and mold are signs of food going bad (unhealthy). But if, for example, a yogurt separates into a clear liquid on the top and some dense stuff on the bottom, you can simply stir it back together.     Things like raw meat are often labeled with something like 'use before'. This means the food can become unhealthy after this date and you should be really careful."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,CarlWheezer,3,Tue Jul 7 10:00:10 2015 UTC,"Safeway has an area in their meat section for exactly this scenario where everything is 50% off.

(could you store the extras in the freezer to prolong their life?)

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,Relenq,2,Tue Jul 7 13:22:25 2015 UTC,My local grocery store will often sell their organic/hormone free meats and fruits and vegetables for a substantial discount the day of expiry. I routinely buy this produce - it saves me so much money and when cooked/packed away is great for meal prep. I generally cook the food right away(I make sure to cook meats throughly just to be safe) and pack it up in meal sized packs to freeze right away. It works out great and I've never had a problem. For example: this week I found organic chicken on sale. I roasted the lot and packed it into 300 - 500g packs (this is the quantity that works well for most of my recipes). I also found bananas on sale and since they were really ripe I cut up the lot and packed it in two banana packs (the amount I'd typically use to make 2 big smoothies).
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,Purrplecat,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"How can the shops sell food past the ""best by"" or ""best sell"" date? Where I live it's illigale, I think, the shops removes these and say thank you if you tell them that the food is past the date."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,54Br0,3,Tue Jul 7 13:04:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think they can sell food if it's after the use by date, but best by isn't saying it's bad after that date."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,kintyre,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:10:43 2015 UTC,"There are generally four different 'sales dates' on packaging: best before, use by, sell by, and display until.  Sell By and Display Until are for retailers to keep up a fresh, running stock and has no bearing on quality/safety of food. I tend to only see these in more upmarket places, and you'll usually see a best before or use by date alongside them.  Best Before is an indicator of quality; this doesn't mean that the product won't taste the same after the date, but that the manufacturer can't guarantee the quality after the date.  Use by is the main one that is in regards to food safety.  Now, personally? I've got a bunch of chocolate I got for 60% off because it was nearing its best before date. Dinner a few days ago was a couple of slices of gammon that I'd picked up (and frozen) as it was discounted due to its use by day being the day we picked it up. I've got some (sealed) yogurts that are past their date that are a bit watery but perfectly fine to eat. I've only gotten food poisoning once, and that was due to me thinking something smelled off and eating it anyway (so my own stupidity)."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cdqth,HyenaRuski,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:00:44 2015 UTC,"It's a shame my current supermarket doesn't do this, because where I've shopped in the past they'd do 50% off anything with a few days left and 75% off if the date was that day. Freezing it, or using it up that day always meant it was ok, and I've eaten stuff that has been in my fridge some days past and it was fine for the most part. Only once had yoghurt that was cultivating new life when I opened it on the best before date, and I honestly suspect something must have been up with that container because that should not happen so fast.   On the other hand they don't do these deals at my current supermarket because everything close to the date gets donated."

Eating healthy AND eating at a caloric surplus to build muscle while on such a tight budget obviously isn't going to be easy. Beans and rice are likely going to be staples of your diet but at least a good size bag of either can go a long way. Peanuts can provide high calories and some protein in a small serving size but I'm not sure what prices look like in your area.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cbrj0,jadedinvasion,26,Mon Jul 6 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I did zucchini noodles recently (using a vegetable peeler) and didn't find that they needed anything.  I'd definitely stress lightly blanching the zucchini rather than the 8-10 minutes most pasta calls for. Also, salt well.  When you sauce them, you should definitely use something that has a lot of flavor and isn't terribly wet. I feel like some simple sauteed vegetables would be a better ""sauce"" than a liquidy bolognese or marinara style sauce.  EDIT: Pioneer Woman has a pretty bomb zucchini pasta recipe that calls for the zucchini to be sauteed directly in the pan with the vegetables. This might be a better way of doing it than blanching and then topping with something. I'd caution to really lightly cook the zukes, though, as they do get watery and kind of fall apart if sauteed for more than a couple minutes."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3cbrj0,sarasmirks,9,Mon Jul 6 18:51:39 2015 UTC,I usually give mine a quick sauté for ~2 minutes. I think it works much better than blanching. They cook super fast!

Here's the good part: take it off the heat, and add cream cheese (low fat is just as good). I generally add a whole pack of cream cheese to a head of cabbage - 300g cream cheese to 800g cabbage. Even then, it's really low calorie per serving.  Mix it in. Season with salt/pepper.  Eat. goes well reheated with mash&bisto, or refried with mash to make bubble&squeak."

Both cottage cheese and yogurt contain natural melatonin which will help you sleep better.  Adding low GI carbs such as fruits and healthy fat to the mix allows you to feel satiated and not go for other unhealthy snacks. This also provides steady energy when you are fasting.

You can also steam vegetables and bake (cornbread, small cake) in a rice cooker.    The thing I'm struggling with is that if you don't have any fridge space for leftovers, do you have any fridge space for ingredients?  If not, you're kinda limited to things like peanut butter sandwiches.    Is it possible to clean out the fridge and then divvy it up so everybody has a shelf?

You could try sandwiches or wraps with hummus and chopped veggies, or make a cheese and fruit plate. All else fails, throw some fruit and yogurt in a blender and make smoothies and call it a day!"

If you got two of them, you could clamp one to a table or counter and use the other to hold stuff- eg, the can opener handles- while you manipulate with your good hand- in this case, by turning the crank to open your beans."

Although I guess they're generally heavy enough to not get knocked around and if nothing sticks to the pan it's not a huge issue, but I would just feel awkward not being able to keep the pan locked in position."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c8u94,novemberdream07,2,Mon Jul 6 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"a vice vise was my first thought too, but you can't really carry it around- especially one handed- and they're very top heavy, so it would tip over too easily. As far as pans go, it's easy enough to sauté that I wouldn't bother trying to use two hands- even now, when I have them available. If you <OP> don't know how to sauté, start with dry beans in the pan, kneeling on a rug. Watch a movie or something while you do it- it should take a few minutes to get the motion down, but that's it. After that, you just know how to do it.  As a brief attempt at a description, imagine the beans are little skateboarders in a halfpipe, and they need to get air and land in the middle of the pan. So the motion almost starts like scooping with a shovel to push everything forward, and then you tip the pan backwards <slightly!> and let everything slide forward and jump up on the lip of the pan, and then you just catch it. One motion. The side-to-side shaking you see in cooking shows is to get things to unstick from the pan where they've been cooking- which is part of why oil is such a good cooking medium. If you have trouble, add a pinch of salt to the oil before you begin cooking, and that will help keep things loose.  edits in italics"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c8u94,Holly_Tyler,3,Mon Jul 6 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"Salads are an easy one handed meal. Cherry tom's, store bought vinergrette, spinach, feta, salt and pepper. Your going to have to really rely on pre made and pre cut ingredients. I mean I dont know if your arm is mobile or not. If it is mobile and you're in a cast, you can still do knife work as long as it wasnt your dominate hand, even then I doubt you'll have trouble with that.  * * * Chicken noodle soup would be another easy one. Buy chicken stock, mirepoix, some of that pre cut/shredded chicken and noodles. The good thing about soups is the knife work doesnt have to be presice. Sandwiches are an option, just buy pre cut cheese and meat. You can tear a piece of lettuce off the head if you have no hands.  * For breakfast, eat fruit, yogurt, eggs. Cracking an egg one handed is easy after the 2nd attempt.  * uhh You can always poach a piece of fish for dinner and steam or blanch&shock veggies. You can no doubt cook a steak one handed if you really want it but there are other protien options as im sure you know. Fucking NUTS! That is a total duh, I guess my point is nothing should change. other than your knife work is going to be ugly if your dominate hand was hurt and/or you cant move the other. But hey just think of it as rustic. Even if you cant handle the knife one handed you can always eat fruits and nuts raw, and easily cook veggies.

Here's a good one: A couple of good squirts of runny honey A few glugs of dark soy sauce A tablespoon of crushed garlic (buy in a jar or a tube!) The equivalent of the juice of 4 limes (you can buy this bottled) A few tablespoons of brown sugar 5 sprigs of thyme (better to strip the leaves off but easier to just leave them on with one hand) Black pepper  Or here's another one we like - this one's good with any protein including cubes of paneer (indian cheese) or firm tofu: Greek yoghurt Lots of lemon juice (out of a bottle) Tablespoon each of crushed garlic and ginger (out of jars!)

EatCheapAndHealthy,3ca3s8,winryxoxrockbell,6,Mon Jul 6 07:58:07 2015 UTC,"If you're on a really tight budget, one thing I'd recommend is having less variety.   I recently made this post (recipes and daily updates in the comments), and two things really jumped out at me in terms of how to economize for one person. Firstly, spread the grocery list out over two weeks as opposed to one. So you're on the right track, there! Secondly, however, I found that while I made my list with an eye to lots of different ideas for things I could potentially make, what ended up happening is that I just didn't have the ability to make a bunch of different dishes (time, amount of tupperware I own, energy to cook a bunch of different stuff, sheer capacity of my kitchen). Instead I cooked three main courses over the course of the week and mostly ate a lot of leftovers. I did also have breakfast (and it would be nice to have a few different breakfast options), of course, but for lunches and dinners I mostly ate from the dishes I cooked. Even if you are really obsessed with variety and hate ever repeating a meal, it's easy to mix it up and do different things with your leftovers (fried rice! in a taco! turn leftover potatoes into potato salad or add leftover veggies to an omelet!) rather than having completely unrelated meals 21* different times.  You will also be able to economize a lot more by not buying convenience foods like lunch meat. If you want to do sandwiches, roast some chicken and cut it off the bone in pieces. (Can also be done with turkey, brisket, sausage, pork roast, basically any meat.) Or make sandwiches with leftovers of cooked meals. (Of course, bread is also expensive, and I found that it's much cheaper to get your carbs in the form of rice, pasta, or potatoes. I'd really only do sandwiches if I needed something cheap to bring to work for lunch rather than eating at home.)   Similarly, don't buy pre-made soup. Make soup. Tomatoes are in season and go for about 3 lbs to the dollar where I am. Even if fresh produce is too expensive, making tomato soup from canned tomatoes will be much cheaper (and result in much better soup) than buying cans of soup. One of my dishes in my linked post was a soup, and it cost less to make 6-8 servings of soup than it would be to buy one can of soup.   You could also look at economizing by number of ingredients. You're kind of all over the map in terms of types of food, which probably means you spend more on a lot of different items rather than thinking logically about how many different things you can make from only a few ingredients. In my linked post, three of my four dishes that I made called for potatoes. Which was awesome because I got 10 lbs of potatoes for $1.50. If I'd only made one thing with potatoes, I'd have wasted a lot of potatoes and spent a lot more on different ingredients.  *3 meals a day times 7 days a week = 21 meals a week"

I followed it pretty much exactly except I used fresh veggies for the seasoning mix instead of frozen.  I also included chopped chicken thighs for extra protein and omitted the cup of water because every time I try these “one pot” recipes, they end up too watery and I have to simmer a bunch at the end.  Freakin delicious!  Enjoyed with a Firestone Walker Union Jack.  Prep time - 10 mins   Cook time - 35 mins   Total time - 45 mins   Total Cost: $9.10  Cost Per Serving: $1.14 (1.25 cups each)  Serves: 8 (1.25 cups each)  Ingredients   1 Tbsp vegetable oil $0.02 ½ lb. smoked sausage (preferably Andouille) $3.67 2 cloves garlic $0.16 1 10oz. bag frozen ""seasoning mix"" $1.39 1 15oz. can diced tomatoes $0.79 ½ Tbsp Creole seasoning 0.15 ½ tsp oregano $0.05 ½ tsp smoked paprika $0.05 ¼ tsp thyme $0.02 Freshly cracked pepper $0.05 2 cups chicken broth $0.24 1 cup water $0.00 1 lb. penne pasta $1.49 2 Tbsp half & half or cream $0.19 ½ bunch fresh parsley $0.45 ½ bunch green onions $0.38   Instructions   Slice the smoked sausage into thin rounds, then cut any larger pieces in half. Add the sausage and vegetable oil to a large pot and cook over medium heat until the sausage is well browned (about 5 minutes). Mince two cloves of garlic and add them to the pot. Sauté for one to two minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the bag of frozen seasoning mix and sauté until heated through (3-5 minutes). Finally, add the can of diced tomatoes (with juices), Creole seasoning, oregano, smoked paprika, thyme, freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), chicken broth, 1 cup of water, and pasta to the pot. Stir until everything is evenly combined. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let the pot come to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, remove the lid briefly to stir, then replace the lid, turn the heat down to low, and let the pot simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir the pot once every few minutes as it simmers to prevent the pasta from sticking. Replace the lid as quickly as possible after stirring to avoid heat loss. While the pasta is simmering, pull the parsley leaves from the stems and give them a good chop, and slice the green onions. Once the pasta is tender, most of the liquid in the pot should be absorbed. If it's still a bit soupy, let the pot simmer for one to two minutes without the lid to allow some moisture to evaporate. Turn off the heat and stir in the half & half or cream. Stir in most of the chopped parsley and green onions, reserving some to sprinkle over top. Serve hot with a pinch of fresh parsley and green onions on top of each bowl.   Notes  *The ""seasoning mix"" used is a pre-chopped and frozen blend of onion, bell pepper, and celery, also known as ""trinity"". If you prefer to use fresh, chop one yellow onion, one green bell pepper, and two stalks of celery.  **Creole seasoning can be found in most major grocery stores, but you can make your own using this blend of spices. Store bought Creole seasoning blends usually contain a lot of salt, so you may need to add extra salt to the final product to compensate."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3cadp6,thecptawesome,21,Mon Jul 6 10:27:24 2015 UTC,"Long Grain: The grains are long and slender.  After cooking, the it is fluffy and the grains remain separate.  It is commonly used in curry dishes.  It is also used in pilafs, paella, stir fry, or salads.  It is excellent as a side dish, and the left overs are good to make fried rice.  Examples of long grain rice varieties include:   Jasmine Basmati American Long Grain (or Carolina Rice)   Medium Grain: The kernels are shorter and fatter than long grain varieties.  The cooked grains are are moist and tender, and tend to stick together.  It can be used almost any way you like.  Examples of medium grain rice varieties include:   Spanish (or paella) rice   Short Grain: The kernel is plump and almost round.   When cooked, the grains are soft and stick together.   It is good in dishes where the rice should be creamier and absorb some of the flavours of the dish.  Examples include risotto, paella, and rice puddings.  Examples of short grain rice varieties include:   arborio sticky rice sushi   Brown Rice: It still has the outer husk (or bran) surrounding the kernel.  This makes it richer in nutrients than white varieties.  It has a nuttier flavour and is chewier than white rice.  It also takes about twice as long to cook.  White Rice: This is the most popular type.  The outer hull is removed and the kernel is polished until it is white.  Sticky (Glutinous) Rice: Despite sometimes being called glutinous rice, it does not actually contain gluten.  Enriched Rice: As the name implies, it has had nutrients added.  These nutrients coat the kernel.  Instant Rice: Has been completely cooked and then dehydrated.  This means that when you bring it home, you can cook it much faster.  Converted Rice: Sometimes called parboiled rice, it originated in India.  Steam is passed through the grains with their husks still on.  This process helps to embed nutrients in the grain.  After the steaming operation, the husk is removed and the kernel is polished.  The result is more nutritious than other white varieties, and more digestible than brown rice.  It helped Indians avoid the scurvy that sometimes affected people in other Asian regions.  Wild Rice: It is not actually a type of rice.  It is the seeds of a water grass and is the only grain native to North America.  It is long and dark brown with black colorings.  It has a smoky, nutty flavour and chewy in texture."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7gbj,rearended,117,Sun Jul 5 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"In 2009 my husband and I were both laid off and were incredibly grateful for our local food bank. I learned how to make bread, biscuits and pie crusts from scratch and how to not waste. (I couldn't afford baggies so I kept the plastic bags from loaves of bread and plastic produce bags.)   When I look at your list a few thoughts come to mind.   If the frozen hamburger meat is all in one package, I'd suggest thawing and cooking it all, draining off the fat, then packaging it into baggies of about one or two pounds each, to make future meal prep easier. I'm pretty sure you can freeze some for use later in the month. See below for the ""Seashells"" recipe but hamburger can be turned into a million different pasta, hamburger, sauce combos that are filling and tasty. If you add a ton of veggies, it's even healthier and stretches the meat very far!  Long, slow cooking generally makes cheaper meats tender, like a 7 lb. pork shoulder roasted at 300 for eight hours- no amount of money can buy tastier food. If you haven't seen it yet, look up /u/electric_sandwich's post about making tasty food with a small budget. His three recipes are not only delicious but also good for a laugh on a hard day. (I don't yet know how to link to it here but google electric_sandwich and pernil and you'll see it's been reposted all over the Internet.)  I'd also take your chicken thighs and legs and just simmer them in a pot of plain water for a few hours.   After two or three hours, the chicken is falling off the bone tender and the water has started to become chicken broth-like.  At this point you can take the chicken out, let it cool, and pull out the skin, bones, cartilage. (If I start it a little after lunch, there's plenty of time to cook, cool, and debone in time to use it for dinner.) Now you have a pile of lovely, tender, tasty chicken meat to use for something like chicken and dumplings, chicken and rice soup, chicken pot pie (mix with some cooked veggies, a can of cream of chicken soup [or better yet, your own white sauce if you know how- if not, I added a post below about making white sauce], slap a pie crust on top [or even canned biscuits] and bake.)  And don't throw out that water you boiled it in! Keep it boiling for a while to evaporate out more water and turn it into a very flavorful chicken broth. You can add onion and garlic but you don't need to. Use that for making a soup, a sauce or for cooking rice.   If I'm working away from home and want to make cooking easier, I cook up the meats on Sunday and keep them in the fridge (or freezer) until I need them.   ""Seashells"" This is a pasta dish my (busy, widowed schoolteacher) mom cooked every week while I was growing up. Take one pound of medium-sized seashell-shaped pasta (or really any medium size, shaped pasta, like fusilli/corkscrew) and cook until tender. Add a family-size can of tomato soup. (You could use tomato sauce but there's something sweet and comforting about the flavor of tomato soup in this dish.) Now add half a pound to a pound of cooked hamburger, depending on how meaty you want it. Finally add a handful or two (or more) of shredded cheese. We always used cheddar but you could certainly use mozzarella or most any cheese. Bake until warmed through and when the cheese is bubbling.   Variations:  Take 1/2 pound to a pound of cooked hamburger (fat drained off) (or ground turkey, soy meat crumbles, shredded chicken, whatever crumbled or chopped protein you've got on hand)  Mix in some cooked pasta (or cooked rice or 1/4"" slices of cooked potato.) (Omit the starch if you want to save on calories, add more starch if you have active kids and need to fill their bellies.)  Mix in one or two types of cooked, cut up veggies: broccoli florets, corn kernels, peas, cubed or circles of carrots, chopped mushrooms (try to cook the liquid out of mushrooms before adding or they'll make the casserole watery,) pretty much any veggie you have on hand, cooked and chopped. The more veggies the healthier.   Mix in a sauce or cream soup of some kind (cream of chicken, spaghetti sauce, low fat Alfredo, home made white sauce (see recipe a few posts down), teriyaki sauce, experiment with what you have.)  Top with cheese or crushed tortilla chips or sliced green onions or something for a little color or texture contrast.   Bake until warmed through and bubbly.     Combo examples: Teriyaki goes great with meatballs, pork or chicken, canned pineapple chunks, rice, tender-cooked broccoli, and if affordable, sliced water chestnuts.   Crumbled cooked sausage, spaghetti sauce, shredded mozzarella, cooked chopped mushrooms, and ziti pasta, topped with chopped olives or a little cheese.   Cooked hamburger mixed with taco seasoning (or add a little each of cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder,  salt, pepper), add cooked corn kernels, cooked onion, shredded Jack and cheddar cheeses, and salsa or tomato sauce, all this layered with strips of tortillas, topped with a little more cheese and crushed tortilla strips.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7gbj,LiberalGrover,4,Mon Jul 6 03:45:41 2015 UTC,I would love to hear more about this white sauce...
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7gbj,behindglasses,15,Mon Jul 6 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"Will you be able to add some additional things to round out your ingredients?  Off hand I'd use some of the bread for breadcrumbs and some egg to make meatloaf and meatballs with the ground beef. If you can get some veggies and such I'd make soup as well with ground beef (cheeseburger or hamburger soup is good, taco soup). If you can get rice and some veggies you can make fried rice or stir fry with the meats and maybe an egg."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7gbj,not2reddit,14,Sun Jul 5 18:29:47 2015 UTC,"What things in particular are you having a hard time using?  You could use some of the cheese, eggs and milk to make a quiche. The general ratio is 1 large egg to 1/2 cup of dairy. A 9 inch quiche would be 3 eggs to 1 1/2 cup of milk. If you have vegetables (saute them first so their liquid doesn't dilute your quiche) and know how to make a pie crust it will be even better. You could just butter some bread and use that as a basis for a crust. Maybe make bread crumbs, mix it with shredded cheese and some butter until it holds together and use that for the crust.   You can cook the apple juice down to make a reduction sauce for the pork. It would be better if you had a fresh apple and some onions to go with it.   You could also use some of the bread to make stuffing to go with roasted chicken or pork.    Depending on the type of cereal, you can use that as a breading for baked pork chops or chicken thighs. Corn flakes would work well. Separate the legs from the thighs, dip in egg wash, roll around in crushed cornflakes and bake. If you have spices that would make it better. It might be good to add some shredded cheese to the breading as well.   You could make baked bacon, egg, cheese cups if you have a muffin pan. There are lots of recipes for those.   I would be sure to save all of the fat from your meats. It is a great source of flavoring. You can strain the fat through a paper towel over a colander. Straining the bits out prolongs the shelf life. Use it to saute vegetables, to make roux etc.   If you know how to make a roux you can make smothered chicken or a basic chicken gumbo.    I would suggest buying a bag of flour, some cornmeal, onions, garlic, celery and carrots. Those things will dramatically improve any dish and expand the things you can make. For example, you could make a pretty good chicken and dumpling dish, you can make pot pies using the flour  and rendered chicken fat.   You can also make microwave cakes using flour, peanut butter, eggs and sweetener. You don't even really need flour for some recipes.   http://kirbiecravings.com/2015/03/3-ingredient-flourless-peanut-butter-cake-2.html  INGREDIENTS:  3 tbsp peanut butter (creamy)  tbsp + 1 tsp white granulated sugar  1 large egg  DIRECTIONS:  Whisk all ingredients into an oversized, microwave-safe mug until batter is smooth and egg is fully whisked in. Microwave for about 1 minute. Let cake cool a few minutes before eating."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7gbj,liatris,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:13:42 2015 UTC,Wait did you say use bread as your crust for quiche? How does that work?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7gbj,SixAlarmFire,2,Mon Jul 6 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"It's not going to be as good as using a real pie crust. I would do it similar to how you make a graham cracker crust for a cheesecake. Make bread crumbs, combine it with butter (the water in the butter will react with the starch in the bread making it firmer when you bake it.) You could add cheese to it as well. It's not going to be gourmet fare but if you're broke and can't buy ingredients for pie crust it would be ok.   You could also roll the slices of bread out with a rolling pin, toast them, butter them and press them into the pie pan. I would probably use white bread with the crust cut off though. Again, not as good as real pie crust but if all you have is bread....  I found a website that has pictures of a spinach quiche made using sliced bread as the crust. Ctrl+f to ""SPINACH QUICHE""  http://beyondfoods.blogspot.com/   I think she would have been better off toasting the bread first."

If you've got food stamps, check out and see if they double at farmers markets. There is a ""change machine"" type thing at our farmers market. Insert your SNAP card, type in an amount and it gives you tokens for 2x as much. It's really awesome. Fruits and veggies cost ~30% more at the farmers market.

I highly recommend using it for things like baking, making sauces, making soups creamier, etc. You can also make smoothies with it, etc.  A good way to use up some of the milk and cheese is to make a home made cheese sauce to put over veggies, or to make home made mac and cheese. You can also dice up the bread into little cubes, toast it in the oven, and use that as a nice topping for the mac and cheese.  You may end up needing to alternate the PB and beans. A lot of families I talked to couldn't get through all the peanut butter. A whole can of beans is a great way to bulk out tacos, chili, soup, etc. Or just add seasonings, heat, and eat as a side.  For the yogurt, I recommend getting plain yogurt and adding your own diced up fruit, a little swirl of honey or peanut butter, etc. to get it tasting how you want it. Plain yogurt also works nicely for a variety of dips/sauces like tzatziki and raita."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7gbj,WeFosterKittens,3,Mon Jul 6 21:02:24 2015 UTC,"WHITE SAUCE  (Not low calorie but tasty, easy, and less expensive than always buying jars of sauce. And you know all the ingredients, no weird additives.)  (I'm happy my cooking ideas are helpful. I'm embarrassed that my second comment to thank someone somehow was added in the wrong place. I have a lot to learn about posting and replying on reddit. I hope this one lands in the right spot.)  Okay, so this sauce is outrageously easy and versatile.    Mix melted butter (I almost always use butter but really you can use bacon fat or chicken fat/schmaltz, anything similar) and an equal amount of flour in a sauce pan on medium or low heat. So if you're melting 2 T of butter, add in 2 T of flour. If you melt a 1/2 cup of butter, use 1/2 a cup of flour. Simple. It forms a paste pretty quickly. Whisk it around for a few minutes to mellow the flavor. (Not everyone but some people can really taste a ""raw flour"" taste if you skip this step.) You want it nice and warm but don't let it burn. This is a ""roux.""  Now add in a liquid like milk or broth. Depending on the liquid you use and how thick or thin you make it, this can become a soup, a pasta sauce, a cream gravy, a fancy sauce for meat- it's seriously versatile.   If you add milk and a little salt, it's now a white sauce. (Start by adding about a cup of milk, whisk until smooth. Add more milk a little at a time until it's the consistency you want.)   Add a little nutmeg to that and it's a Bechamel sauce. Kinda fancy, right?   Or skip the nutmeg but add garlic powder and shredded Parmesan and use it on pasta as a basic Alfredo.   Or add a few spoons of pesto sauce and now you have a creamy pesto.  Or instead, add cheddar cheese and you're making sauce for Mac and cheese.   Or add lots of milk, lots of cooked, chopped vegetables (potato or broccoli or most anything really), salt and pepper. Then whisk or use a stick blender until smooth and you've got cream of anything soup. You can add a little half and half or cream to the soup if you're not worried about calories and you'd like a really rich mouth feel.  When I make chicken and dumplings or chicken pot pie I start with a white sauce but instead of only milk, I use 1/2 milk and half chicken stock so it comes out like a rich chicken gravy. Thyme or tarragon (one or the other) are excellent seasonings for this, besides the usual onion and garlic, salt and pepper.   Play with this and experiment.   Enjoy!"

In terms of using up all the peanut butter - you can use it to make some tasty peanut sauces for meat or rice (goes great with asian-type vegetables). You can use it in smoothies/shakes too - yogurt/peanut butter/banana goes real well. You can also make a peanut butter dessert sauce by melting it with butter and adding sugar. It'd spice up pancakes, fruit, pretty much anything.   I am one of those freaks that would eat peanut butter from the jar, but I know some people need variety.   Eggs are some of your best assets. I'm unemployed right now and eggs/garlic/lemon/spinach/black beans are our staples.

You can also spruce it up with   Eggs- personally I liked scrambled and adding some of that block cheese would make it tastier so the kids will like it. If you want them to stretch out longer hard boiled would be a good bet.   *(1) 16oz jar of peanutbutter OR (4) 16oz cans of beans  Beans are going to last a lot longer and are likely healthier.   http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/calico-beans this recipie uses a few of the ingredients you have and is a personal favorite of mine.

If you only need one meal a day you've got stuffed peppers there for sure, that could last a while. If you can scrounge up some change pick up some tomato sauce to top them with and some potatoes for a side.   I guess you could live off that for a week if you really had to but you'll be quite hungry. Check out your local food banks if this is really all you have."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c8t8f,patchgrrl,7,Mon Jul 6 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"I would make it into a soup- that will make the most volume of food. Brown the ground beef, onion, garlic, and bell pepper with spices you like-salt, pepper, maybe some cumin or basil. Dont sesson too heavily at this point because the flavor will intensify after simmering the soup. Do not drain off the fat, it will help you feel fuller longer. Then add about 1-2 quarts water and a few dashes of soy sauce. If you can manage to get some cheap rice or pasta (or oats or any grain)  and/or a can of tomato paste (or even 5-10 fast food ketchup packets), add that too. Let simmer for about half an hour. Spice again according to taste. Once done go ahead and portion out so you dont overeat one night and leave yourself without the next day. This will cover one meal a day for 5-7 days but will be meager. If you can get oatmeal (dollar store)- that can be another daily meal. Drink lots of water, and best of luck to you.  Edit: didnt see the garlic clove,  added to instructions."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c8t8f,msreciprocity,3,Mon Jul 6 02:29:22 2015 UTC,"Also consider asking the butcher at your grocery if they have any bones for free. Simmer these in water then add that water to your ground beef mixture, it will add lots of flavor and nutrition."

Basically then you can make deconstructed Chipotle style burritoes without tortillas. (Rice, stir fried peppers, onions, garlic, beans, beef).  Also stuffed peppers with rice, beans, onion and beef is tasty.  To keep you full, you'll need bulk, aka complex carbohydrates. Your current quantity of protein and veggies aren't going to feed you for a week. If you can supplement with rice and beans, then you might be ok.  Pasta and tomato sauce could be supplemented with the the meat & veggies... it's cheap and you can use small quantities of meat and veggies per serving."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c8t8f,sarasmirks,2,Mon Jul 6 10:09:37 2015 UTC,"Recipe 1: Add half a small bag of frozen mixed veggies and about 6 potatoes worth of mashed potatoes and make Shepherd's Pie with one pound of the meat. I recently did this and got 6 full meal sized servings.  Recipe 2: Add rice and the other half of the bag of frozen veggies and make fried rice with the other pound of meat. No idea how long this much fried rice will last, but let's say you can get another 6 meals out of it.   Find something to eat for breakfast (or just know that you'll be skipping breakfast this week) and you've got 6 days of food right there with the ingredients you have and about $5 worth of additional groceries. ($1 bag of rice, $1 bag of frozen veg, $3 big sack of potatoes)  On the seventh day, have a few baked potatoes or some kind of rice dish with whatever is left."

I assumed you eat breakfast food.   You can cut bell pepper into flat pieces. So you can get about 16 large sizes.   You basically can make two versions:   bell pepper ground beef stir fry with garlic, soy sauce and other seasonings. Give you 5 meals or so.  Bell pepper ground beef pizza. Basically use the other bell pepper as pizza base and put cooked ground beef with garlic and seasoning on top and put in oven for 20 min or so.    You should be able to use them for 5 days (lunch and dinner).   Hopefully this helps."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,Ledanator,7,Sun Jul 5 18:18:14 2015 UTC,Same for me. I have zero appetite in the morning.    I started drinking giant glasses of milk instead then about an hour or two later I have a more real breakfest.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,LuxurioMusic,40,Sun Jul 5 15:13:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. Breakfast isn't critical for everyone. I have an apple for breakfast these days and do lunch around 11:30 or so. I don't eat until I feel hungry and in the morning I rarely feel hungry.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,tonylowe,16,Sun Jul 5 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"My doctor got on my ass for not eating breakfast, so I'm not sure.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,justhisguyouknow,7,Sun Jul 5 16:16:20 2015 UTC,I'm the opposite. If I eat breakfast I'll feel tired throughout the day. Though that could just be because my body isn't used to it.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,ClutchHunter,18,Sun Jul 5 20:39:55 2015 UTC,"Breakfast is definitely important for everyone   The studies on this have really turned tides in recent years. It's clear that breakfast can help with 1. reducing cravings later in the day (for some people) and 2. blood sugar levels. If you don't have diabetes and don't binge on crappy foods later in the day, breakfast has zero effect on your health. Further, intermittent fasting has shown to have a lot of benefits as well. If you get cranky when you don't eat, go ahead and have your breakfast. But this does not apply to everyone."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,brennok,8,Sun Jul 5 15:00:45 2015 UTC,For me it doesn't cover up the base taste enough unlike the pre-mixed flavors. It doesn't matter how much I add to it.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,dewprisms,2,Sun Jul 5 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"The main difference between the flavored and plain or vanilla is the load of extra sugar, and often their fruit flavors are added in a more gel/puree form for consistency.  I've noticed I like certain brands much more than others. I've found some plain or vanilla brands that are really gross, and some that taste great."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,brennok,2,Sun Jul 5 23:11:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I only seem to be able to tolerate Yoplait and Dannon so far but even then it is only a few flavors.

Form a patty and cook each side in a pan until it's crispy. It's not battery like traditional pancakes, or even like latkes. (Latkes are also delicious though, you should try them.) It's more like hash browns. They're really good though. I like putting cilantro, avocado, cherry tomatoes, even cheese on top. They're also good plain with salt and pepper."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,TempestStorm,16,Mon Jul 6 13:25:16 2015 UTC,An avocado really isn't that small...It's got more calories than an egg mcmuffin..
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,Pearberr,7,Sun Jul 5 13:59:50 2015 UTC,"Small in the sense that it isn't a large item, can be eaten quickly, and doesn't take up much space.  Calorically, it's all fat so it should fill you up well for it's size and sustain you for a much longer period than getting equal calories from sugar or carbs."

I actually started preferring the keto subs because they were more accepting of that idea.    I don't think it's unreasonable for people to still have the assumption that breakfast is still ""the most important meal of the day"", just like I don't think it's unreasonable for people on this sub to reject a grocery list that is 70% fats.  It's not absolutely right or absolutely wrong to skip breakfast, because every person's body is different.  If you honestly have a hard time functioning come noon time without eating, then you need breakfast.  Everyone ""fasts"" overnight technically, and eating in the morning (breaking fast, get it?) is benificial for some people.  A lot of people who are not hungry in the morning really do not need the ""break fast"" until later in the day.    For me, my most caloric laden meals are dinner.  My body usually feels fine until noon or so without any intake, but if I work out or go surfing or something I need to eat.    Feel out what your body wants and don't force it one way or the other.  I'm sorry you got downvoted, I feel like now that a few more studies have come out a lot of people have this smug superiority thing about the subject.

Because I dont really like thinking about food in the morning and even though I can be hungry I'm also often nauseous or just off feeling for a bit, and/or in a hurry, this makes it easy for me to grab something to shove in my mouth without too much time and effort. These things are simple tastes- lots of flavor, can be finger foods, so its easy to get a decent breakfsst this way. I do feel better when I eat a breakfast high in protien with somrw healthy fat .  Some other ideas are something like muscle milk, kefir, a cup of beef or chicken broth with an egg stirred into it while hot plus a few cut green onions, plain broth. Two cooked breakfasts I love are roasted tomatoes on toast with goat cheese (for the tomatoes, drain whole canned tomatoes, sprinkle lightly with salt, sugar, and pepper, and put on a cookie sheet with a lip, bake at 345 for about 15 minutes, broil for 3-5)...  And garlic mashed sweet potatoes with greens and an egg... http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/38ux19/z/cry9swb  In the actual breakfast food group, look into egg muffins.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,UltraLord90,2,Sun Jul 5 20:49:52 2015 UTC,"My breakfast is tea. Sometimes our bodies just don't like the stress of calories and high blood sugar first thing in the morning. Cereal, i'm sure, would completely fuck with my mood, because I'm like that. If you just miss his company while you eat, just have coffee or hot water for tea handy. He'll likely have his unsweetened."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,brenan6,2,Mon Jul 6 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"I just want to say I think it's nice that you care about your SO, and I feel like you're just trying to make sure he has what his body needs in a time where both of you are adjusting to taking care of yourselves.  Please don't take all these people saying ""didn't you know about fasting?  DON'T YOU KNOW NOT EVERYONE NEEDS TO EAT IN THE MORNING? He's a grown up leave him alone!"" too personally.  I found this thread from a year ago that I referenced for my SO without as many unhelpful comments.    edit-  pasting a reply to a comment that asked if skipping breakfast was unhealthy and was downvoted   I have not been on this sub regularly for a while, but when I was lurking here a year or so ago people went off about how bad skipping breakfast is. I actually started preferring the keto subs because they were more accepting of that idea.  I don't think it's unreasonable for people to still have the assumption that breakfast is still ""the most important meal of the day"", just like I don't think it's unreasonable for people on this sub to reject a grocery list that is 70% fats.  It's not absolutely right or absolutely wrong to skip breakfast, because every person's body is different. If you honestly have a hard time functioning come noon time without eating, then you need breakfast. Everyone ""fasts"" overnight technically, and eating in the morning (breaking fast, get it?) is benificial for some people. A lot of people who are not hungry in the morning really do not need the ""break fast"" until later in the day.  For me, my most caloric laden meals are dinner. My body usually feels fine until noon or so without any intake, but if I work out or go surfing or something I need to eat.  Feel out what your body wants and don't force it one way or the other. I'm sorry you got downvoted, I feel like now that a few more studies have come out a lot of people have this smug superiority thing about the subject. If comments like yours just get downvoted no one will see them or their responses, and then it's harder for more people that think like you to get the information they are looking for or need."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c6wyf,masimbasqueeze,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:07:27 2015 UTC,I don't like eating in the mornings sometimes so will survive on bulletproof coffee or just regular coffee with milk and hard boiled eggs and a handful of nuts or trail mix. Sometimes Greek yogurt on the go.

I used this recipe myself which is similar, but I made several of them and I still have 6 in the freezer!  Keep in mind that the sweet potato makes for a softer burger. I've had it fall apart in 2-3 pieces after throwing it in the pan, but it still tastes good!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7e0c,Meltingteeth,8,Sun Jul 5 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"Rice Congee  The main benefits of this food are that it's inexpensive, very filling and reasonably tasty. I think it's also pretty solid nutrition-wise, but I don't keep track of that. It's vegetarian, but I think some unsalted, unseasoned beef would go well in this if it was slow-cooked and tender.    Ingredients:  2.5 Cups White Rice (Long grain)  1 lb carrots (Chopped)  4 Stalks of Green Onions (Chopped)  1 can Coconut Milk  3-4 quarts of water. Eyeball thickness to taste.  3 tsp Green Curry  1 tsp Corn Starch  Season to taste with Garlic Powder, Sriracha and salt.  How To:   I cooked all of the rice separately in a rice cooker until it was done. I had the rice already cooked when I started the rest. Pour the coconut milk, corn starch, curry and water into a stock pot and set to medium-high heat. While that's heating, chop the carrots into medallions and pour into the stock. Do the same with the green onions. Wait for the soup to boil. When it starts, cover it with a lid for five minutes, stirring twice in this time.  Set the heat to medium and add white rice. If it appears too thick, add more water.  Add the garlic powder, sriracha and salt, all to taste. I season by smell, but do what you are comfortable with. Cover the pot. If you want your rice thicker, keep it on medium for a longer amount of time. Stir every few minutes during this process. Rice loves to stick. Once it's at the preferred thickness and texture (which shouldn't take more than 15 minutes), remove from heat and ladle into a bowl.    Thanks for the gild!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7e0c,_mindpalace_,2,Mon Jul 6 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"The corn starch is used as a thickener, which I think makes it taste a lot better. It also helps the coconut milk during the cooking, which likes to clump up. You may be able to substitute flour."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7e0c,_mindpalace_,3,Mon Jul 6 16:43:07 2015 UTC,LOVE congee. Made some the other day. Great for when I'm having digestive issues or have a bad cold/flu.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7crx,nomealskipped,9,Sun Jul 5 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I live in the Northeast, prices may not apply elsewhere.   Bacon Ends and Pieces a pound of uncured, applewood-smoked bacon for $3.50. Don't expect neat strips, expect a mixture of strips and chunks of meat. (They don't always have this in stock, check next to the other bacon with the meats.) Coconut Oil Trader Joes has organic virgin coconut oil for cheaper than anybody else I've seen. Brown Rice Pasta if you can't have wheat, this is delicious, and cheaper than any other gluten-free pasta I've seen. (Their Brown Rice & Quinoa pasta is even more delicious, but not cheap). Aloe Juice if you drink It, they have a gallon of pure aloe juice for under $10, half the price I've seen elsewhere. Haven't tried this yet, though. (If you don't drink Aloe Juice and want to try it, cut it with fruit juice, it doesn't taste pleasant on its own.) Nuts they have very competitive prices for nuts, including my favorite, cashews. Try the ""50% Less Salt"" versions if you like your nuts just a little salty. Mission Figs best tasting, juiciest figs I've been able to get year-round Greek Yogurt way cheaper than Chobani, Fage, et al. Try the honey yogurt. Coconut or Almond Milk $3 for a gallon Cheese you can find high quality cheese at a range of prices, including some really inexpensive ones Sriracha BBQ sauce not particularly cheap or healthy, but delicious   Careful of their prepared frozen foods, they're delicious, but often pricey. I'd also avoid their ribs in BBQ sauce; it seems like a good deal, but there's not much meat on the bones."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c7crx,adipisicing,5,Sun Jul 5 17:03:25 2015 UTC,Bacon Ends and Pieces is the best secret. If you don't NEED your bacon to be 100% aesthetically pleasing then you have just scored high-quality bacon at a crazy price. Sometimes there are whole pieces in there.   The almond butter and dried fruits are some of our stables.

I love their Mediterranean hummus with baby carrots as a snack, and if you eat cheese they have good deals on specialty cheddar. In the frozen section, try their falafels. I looooove them. Very tasty, easy meal. And their quinoa duo with sweet potatoes and zucchini is delicious. Their nut milks are great, but cows mils is cheaper elsewhere. They have some yogurts, but I try to stick to their full fat plain Greek yogurt, and add my own fresh fruit or honey and nuts or jam, because they mostly have a bunch of low/no fat options that are FILLED with sugar and negate any health benefits.  And as a treat, I like the peanut butter and jelly chocolate bar, usually as an impulse purchase by the register. good luck! I love trader joes."

Bags of salad greens, so many different kinds, really reasonably priced, cheaper than my grocery store. While I'm right there, I throw in more tasty salad ingredients - a bag of chopped brussels sprouts, baby/fingerling potatoes, tiny zucchini, and whatever else looks good. Also, the spice grinders - $1.99 for the pink Himalayan salt pebbles that I grind up.

Those will be great places to find cheap healthy food as well.  Their fish tins  are very reasonably priced compared to the Costco, and you don't have to buy in bulk. They have a nice variety, too.  The Simple Times beer is very hit and miss. The lager might be a somewhat safer bet than the pilsner, but it can also disappoint. I much preferred the Kirkland 24 packs at the Costco.

Only drink soda/juice/energy-drinks/etc. in extreme moderation. Seriously, that stuff will make you fat. It's pretty much just liquified sugar. Beer has a ton of calories in it too (seems obvious but some people don't know that). Frozen veggies are your friend. They're actually healthier as healthy as ""fresh"" vegetables from the grocery store, they last pretty much forever (so there's no wasted money when they go bad) and they're surprisingly cheap. EDIT: Freshness depends a lot on location, some grocery stores are better than others. Here in Arizona produce has to spend a lot of time on a truck before it arrives. Don't get fast food unless it's a treat (as in, maybe once every few weeks). It's cheap and easy, but it's horrible for you. If you don't feel like cooking every day, you can make a large batch of something on the weekends and eat it throughout the week. Look for recipes that freeze/reheat well.

The veggies you find in supermarkets have been picked weeks ago and probably shipped across the country, if not the world.  Veggies begin losing nutrition the second they are picked, whereas freezing them slows this process, so by the time it gets to you it's possible for frozen veggies to have a higher nutrient content.  Also some veggies, like tomatoes, are picked unripe, the ripened artificially.  Because the vegetable has to ripen itself without being able to draw on extra nutrients and energy from the plant, some is used up in the ripening process, leading to nutrient loss.    Another common veggie myth is that microwaving then damages the nutrients.  I have found no evidence to suggest this, and evidence to suggest it is false"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,killingxspree,7,Sun Jul 5 11:28:39 2015 UTC,"It's not true at all. Better quality frozen vegetables are pretty much flash frozen the instant they're picked and thus closely resemble their freshly picked state. This is exceptionaly obvious with peas, their starches start turning into sugar really fast and therefore frozen peas will almost always be better than fresh ones (of course this isn't true for truly fresh peas).  In general though, this really hasn't anything to do with nutrition. All the good stuff stays with time."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,roodvuur,7,Sun Jul 5 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"The subtlety here (supposedly) is that veggies destined for freezing are allowed to ripen to their optimal state while still living / on the plant / in the ground, whereas veggies destined to be sold fresh are picked before they're ripe, because they need to allow time for transport and storage before they're sold, and are often then ripened artificially when it's time to sell. People are saying that the reason frozen = healthier is because veggies start losing their nutrients when they're picked, but I think the real reason is supposed to be that they absorb / develop more nutrients if they're allowed to stay alive on the plant longer. Sounds plausible, though I'm not sure how true it really is."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,HenryTheDancingHorse,3,Sun Jul 5 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"Point 1: Synthetic caffeine is different from natural caffeine.  Here is a teaser from an article in Analytical Chemistry, one of the foremost ACS publications, talking about how they can tell the difference between the two experimentally. If they were chemically identical, formulating such an experiment would be impossible. The two are not identical.  Point 2: We don't know what synthetic caffeine will do to you over a long period of time.  I may have set myself up to fail here by proving a negative, but I did some poking around in some chemistry and nursing publication databases I happen to have access to. I could not find an experiment with clear conclusions that specifically dealt with the dangers of natural vs synthetic caffeine, but nowhere could I find an article or paper that said ""Sure have at it"". It seems to me that if there were a conclusive answer one way or the other, it would have come up in one of the hundreds of journals in those databases. So in short, we don't know; and that's all I'm saying. We don't know.  The point I'm really driving at here anyway is that caffeine can have some significant negative effects on your health, and synthetic caffeine is particularly dangerous because of the way you can ingest it. Drinking tea or coffee, you get caffeine (synthetic or not) in fairly low doses and consume it over a longer period of time. Taking caffeine pills you ingest all of the caffeine all at once and it takes seconds to do. If you aren't paying attention, you get way too much way too fast. This doesn't happen with tea.  I could give two fucks about being organic and all natural, I'm just advocating that people be careful with the stuff. Be very careful with synthetic caffeine because it can be dangerous, and no, we don't know everything about it."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,seonadancing1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:23:36 2015 UTC,Why do you say frozen vegetables are healthier than fresh? I've never heard that before.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,phoofboy,2,Sun Jul 5 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"From what I've read on the subject it's basically two major factors: First, ""fresh"" vegetables in the supermarket(this isn't true for farmers market vegetables generally) are often picked early in an unripened state so they are just ripe once they hit the shelves, frozen are picked at their peak and flash frozen at the height of their taste and nutrion. And the second is that fruits and vegetables start breaking down once picked(starches into sugars etc), this process is retarded via flash freezing so the frozen vegetables reach you in their peak state, whereas fresh veggies have had a few days/a week to break down while in transport."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,randoh12,4,Sun Jul 5 02:11:28 2015 UTC,This is solid advice. I suggest that more people read up on this topic to understand the complexities of fresh versus frozen vegetables.   Here are a few articles to get you started:  Eating Well  WebMD  LiveStrong  Good luck!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,seonadancing1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:08:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing!

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,Larrygiggles,20,Sun Jul 5 09:15:02 2015 UTC,"First, get into a routine. Every morning, if I have work that day, I have a specific breakfast. Just under 2/3 cup egg substitute (like offbrand eggbeaters) with 1/4 or 1/8 cup of lowfat shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 3 pieces of low sodium bacon. It's about 190 calories and decently filling. If I feel like splurging I include 2 pieces of whole wheat toast, lightly butter, for another 100 calories. The routine helps me start my day the same way, every day, and has made a huge difference for me.  Second, start making and planning meals ahead of time. It makes a huge difference- you have your food right there, ready to go, already portioned. I recommend /r/MealPrepSunday for some ideas. For me, I regularly just do about 3 oz. of chicken, a cup of mixed veggies (with some salt, pepper, butter), and something like 1 wedge of laughing cow cheese + 100 calories of wheat thins popped chips for the second side. It's filling, tastes good, and is healthy while not terribly boring. Takes about an hour from start to finish for me to prep a whole weeks worth of lunches.  By planning my meals ahead of time, sticking to a routine, and counting my calories I've lost 50 pounds in almost a year. I've also saved a ton of money because I only order out two meals a week. And, thanks to calorie counting forcing me to eat healthier meals, I've really expanded my tastes. There's so much more food that I like to eat now AND it's food that's good for me!  Ninja Edit! Forgot to add: It's important to start off on the right food with meal prep. Make sure you buy the appropriate amount of food and have food storage containers. I use these guys and while they aren't great, they divide the meal perfectly and nothing has gone bad."

I think this is better than a cookbook as for events and such where you have food prepared for you it helps you keep track from over eating. Since you have to input the foods I limit myself by not being able to eat till I put my previous meal in. This way I understand how I'm doing already for the day.   Next tip would be buying a compartmentalized Tupperware. I use one with 3 sections for lunch. The biggest sandwich sized one I fill with veggies. The smallest one with hummus and the other one with pretzels, or animal cookies.   Next tip is to make a list of food you like and is healthy from here. 3 breakfasts, 5 lunches, 10 dinners and make that your cookbook. When you have made all those and get tired of one or so, swap them out. This way you don't get overwhelmed and have to work hard learning new techniques or recipes. And you can perfect them one by one.  Good luck!"

For example, I start a set of 4 shifts tonight so I made hummus baked chicken and vegetables enough for all my shifts. I live alone so I can make one recipe (which I usually find on the myfitnesspal blog because they've got all the nutrition information handy, plus they're easy to log) which is meant for a family and that usually lasts me. Then I put together a couple smaller snacks to munch on during the night. If you're anything like me, night shifts can make you feel ravenous.

The low carb ones slowed down, burning less energy and adjusted pretty well to the lack of food. The fat rats were still getting high carb, but reduced calorie food.

When you are eating sugars you are still stimulating the leptin/grehlin/insulin hormones, whereas not eating won't cause direct stimulation of those. Because insulin is the main inhibitor to fat liberation it makes perfect sense that someone on a total starve would, after a short starve, gain liberation of their fat and therefore lose weight. Look at people constantly trying to diet though, they restrict calories without restricting carbohydrates, then they diet for months with no progress, then breakdown and binge. It is definitely more complex than you think, and yes, the mouse model does apply as this is a very base hormonal response issue, something which seems to be the same across most mammals."

Though it doesn't seem to be pointed out as much lately as when I first learned about it, part of why grain/carb based foods aren't good for you is because of satiation. IE you can eat popcorn/chips forever because your body doesn't really recognize it as fulfilling your hunger. Your body responds to proteins and fats as satiating your hunger much more effectively than carbs. I've noticed that eating more protein-based meals satisfied my hunger and didn't leave me snacky.  So I'd suggest having more protein-centric meals and cutting carbs as much as you can. Carb/grain based snacks cost you money and don't really fill you up, cutting them out of your budget leaves more room for things that are actually nutritious. There's lots of other advice, but +protein -carbs seems to have made the biggest difference in my life."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,reeblebeeble,3,Sat Jul 4 23:02:31 2015 UTC,Isn't it true that there's barely a difference in nutrition content in brown vs. white rice? I usually go for white rice (if I eat it at all) simply because I like it more. I'm not missing the extra gram of fiber or protein.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,frippere,6,Sun Jul 5 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to basically contradict what frippere said. The ""skin"" on the grain that differentiates brown from white rice contains fibre, some micronutrients like magnesium and zinc, and B vitamins. Brown rice has ""more"" nutrition in that sense.   You can't have a ""spike in your GI"". You can have a spike in your insulin. If you are eating a healthy, high-fibre diet otherwise, it's fine to eat foods that spike your insulin a bit, because it will go back down to normal without giving you a ""dip"". There's nothing inherently unhealthy about plant foods that have a higher GI, but you need to be eating a diet where fibres and sugars are balanced. If you eat lots of fruits and veggies and not many refined sugars, you're probably ok. GI is only going to cause problems for people who already have metabolic issues or who don't eat enough fibre.   If you are currently eating a low fibre diet, then switching to brown rice would be a good idea. It's best to introduce fibre into your diet gradually, though, so if you're introducing fibre from other sources like beans, you might prefer to have white rice so as not to overload yourself. It's a question of balance. But if in doubt, sure, brown rice is ""healthier"".   I keep both brown and white rice in the cupboard. If I'm eating a meal that's already high in fibre, like a lentil curry, I'll have jasmine rice because it tastes nice. If I'm having something like a meat and veg stirfry, I'd usually prefer brown rice."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,northamrec,2,Sun Jul 5 03:41:32 2015 UTC,"While it's true the nutritional content is near identical, white rice (along with most refined carbs) causes a higher spike in your glycemic index, which does a lot of stuff I'm not an expert on and supposedly ends up making you hungrier faster. It has something to do with brown rice and other less refined carbs being slower to digest. Because if you just blend up a brown rice slurry and drink that you'll still get a high spike in your GI."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,edddddddddd,5,Sat Jul 4 23:40:56 2015 UTC,"Most of the calories in popcorn and chips come from fat, so it's a pretty bad example to support your argument here, unless you're talking about air-popped popcorn, which is pretty low in calories for the satiation value. I find popcorn very satiating, as it's relatively high in fibre. I could eat 150 calories worth of air-popped popcorn and feel like I'd eaten lunch (not that I would). That's pretty high satiation per calorie.   People who talk about fats and proteins being more satiating often seem to be thinking more in terms of satiation per weight/volume measure of food. You need to think in terms of satiation per calorie. The foods that are most satiating per calorie are going to be high in water and fibre, and yes those foods are often going to be high in carbs as well.   Carb+fibre wholefoods are metabolised differently from refined carbs like sugar - the fibre slows down the rate at which they're absorbed. There's also evidence that resistant starches (found in legumes, grains, potatoes) actually encourage your body to burn its fat stores (http://authoritynutrition.com/resistant-starch-101/ - sorry, dumb site, but good information in that article).   You don't HAVE to eat carbs to be healthy, but with so many excellent, efficient, satiating foods that are full of them, you're basically shooting yourself in the foot (unless your doctor has informed you that you have some kind of issue that necessitates it).   Stop demonising carbs using non-food examples like chips, snack foods and refined white bread, it's a ""straw man"" and it just doesn't make sense. Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants, and you'll be fine."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,ms23789,4,Sat Jul 4 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the cheapest way to live is making food that is tasty enough so that you won't feel the same urge to eat out, and that you'll actually stick to eating at home. Because even if you spend a little extra on extras, you'll still save money not buying it when you're out.  For me, that meant learning how to make good burritos, good pizza/calzones, and good knock-off general tso's chicken/stirfry.   I make a ""healthy"" burrito by making split pea hummus, quinoa or rice, guacamole, cheese and hotsauce.   I make pizzas in cast iron skillets, they're smaller in size so I naturally feel less of an urge to eat more when I make them, and since I make them at home I can add whatever ingredients that I want without the price skyrocketing. Like today I put guacamole on my pizza (amazing btw). But imagine how much that would cost eating out.   And then my very knock-off general tso's chicken is fun. Basically the way I do it is teryaki sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, and either hot sauce or just crushed red pepper flakes. I cook that a bit in a skillet, and then I toss in chopped up pieces of unbreaded chicken. It's not really the same thing as general tso's chicken, but it's close enough that I wont go out to buy it instead. I also use the same sauce for stir fry.   The biggest tip I can offer is to not eat entirely clean, just calorie count and eat healthier than you would otherwise."

These are the 2 tips I have been using:   Snacks. I love to pop my own popcorn. A little bit of oil and 1/4 cup of corn will yield me a 2 qt pot full of popcorn. I love salt and pepper chips so I just sprinkle salt and pepper on the popcorn.  Chicken. It is cheaper compare to other types of meat, hands down. Bone in skin on thigh is even cheaper. Just trim the skin and fat off during the weekend, precut and marinade it if you are making stir fry, or leave it whole to make chicken cacciatore (just be careful it will be fattier than skin and fat off).   I am not quite sure what kind of cuisine you like to cook? I do cook a lot of Asian dishes so my recipes might not suit you."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,reeblebeeble,2,Sun Jul 5 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"Without imposing any sort of diet, here are my bargain items in each category  Carbs are super easy: rice and pasta in bulk. $1/lb dry is fairly typical. No substitute for fresh fruit, but blended fruit+veggies pouches are great for convenience if you cannot hit the store more than once a week (in bulk, I've found them for as little as $.25per).  Protein is a bit of a challenge, with the notable exception of eggs. Egg whites are amazing. Beans pack a good amount of protein, but with a lot of carbs in them as well (usually between 100% and 200% the amount of protein IIRC). Greek yogurt and cottage cheese are also good for bargain proteins, and are great as substitutes for dairy fat in baking recipes. Beyond that, chicken and protein powders are about on par, and frozen fish are a treat if you like seafood. (check out the microwave pouch method with frozen veggies)  Fat is very cheap in general, but I gravitate toward dairy fats which tend to be a little more expensive. I really don't have any tips for these. Avocados and unsalted sweet cream butter...I'm pretty much not giving them up.  Fiber and some v&m from frozen veggies. Think like the grandma that advertises Franks Redhot; put that shit on everything. Peas are a great source of fiber and protein, but I don't like the taste.  Supplement with a generic multivitamin and some fish oil if you want to be safe."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,gitsgrl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:51:45 2015 UTC,"Ah! Well... first of all I would embrace the idea of meal prep Sunday (or whatever your day off is). Go to /r/mealprepsunday to get the idea (even though a lot of people aren't that sub aren't the healthiest cooks). Plan what you're going to make and do a grocery shop for ingredients plus enough for your snacks and breakfasts throughout the week. Stocking your house with fresh produce will make things a lot easier.   I can definitely empathise with the not feeling like cooking problem, so batch cooking can help with that. But there are also very simple meals like baked potatoes, roast veggies etc that shouldn't take too much motivation to prepare.   If you have trouble getting affordable fresh produce, get bags of frozen veggies, people seem to be into those in this sub :) - easy way to extend your meal and fill you up is to just combine your chilli or stew with a serve of frozen veg and a grain or starch. Plus they don't take any effort to prepare.   You can use the meal prep day to prepare some healthier snacks for work as well.   You could make maybe two recipes each weekend so you don't get bored eating the same thing every night during the week, and use the freezer so you have a few choices.   Not sure if you are someone who actually enjoys cooking generally. Budgetbytes.com is a great place to start because the recipes there are usually pretty simple and easy to follow. They aren't specifically designed for weight loss, but they're generally pretty good, based on real food and plenty of veggies.   Here are a few suggestions for the types of dinner recipes you could prepare in bulk:   Lentil soup  Chilli or Chilli 2 so many variations on this - I always recommend vegetarian versions for people looking to lose weight, but it's up to you. You could serve this with baked potatoes or baked sweet potatoes, or grain of your choice, and a side of frozen greens.   Sweet potato lentil curry  Chicken corn spinach soup  African peanut stew - omg this is so yum.  Next you need to get a hearty and filling breakfast into you before work so that you aren't tempted to snack on unhealthy stuff. Oatmeal is the best in my opinion. I like to cook 1/2 cup oats with 1 cup water and a ripe banana, then finish it off with a splash of milk and cinnamon. But you probably have your own favourite way to enjoy it.   If you get up early enough to cook some oatmeal, maybe you could make yourself a sandwich to take to work as well. Otherwise:   Snack suggestions that you could prep and portion in advance:   Baked chickpeas  Raw veg slices like cucumber, carrot, celery (you could have hummus or salsa or unsweetened yoghurt as dip)  Hard boiled eggs (no more than one per day on average)   Fruit! Any and all fresh fruit, as much as you want.   I think half the battle is just picking a day to do your shopping and making sure you have easy-to-prepare healthy food in the house. Tinned beans, tinned tomatoes, frozen veg, potatoes, eggs, stuff you can eat without cooking like fruit, lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, yoghurt, peanut butter, wholemeal bread, etc. If you have these things on hand, the choice to eat healthy will be much easier."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c5330,myaussiefriends,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:03:15 2015 UTC,"Here are a few things I get that are relatively affordable and healthy.   bag of frozen chicken breasts - the lowest calorie and cheapest meat I've found.   Bags of frozen vegetables - these are easy to steam in the microwave, are pretty cheap, and make you feel full.  Cans of black beans and/or pinto beans - pretty cheap at ~.75 cents a can, lots of fiber to make you feel full.  Condiments like honey mustard, Bbq sauce, ketchup, ranch, taco seasoning/sauce etc. but use in moderation on the chicken.   You can make quite a few variations on lunches with these items. I usually make 4 to 6 ounces of shredded chicken with 1 cup of broccoli and 1/2 cup of beans. I make two of the lunches for an eight hour work shift and I eat one lunch 3 hours in and another lunch 6 hours in. You can prep a few of these lunches in advance but make sure you don't keep a made lunch in the fridge longer than 4 days.   If you want to browse through my post history I've posted some of my ""recipes"" to this sub.   That should be a good start. Keep in mind it will take a month or two for your appetite to adjust and for you to stop feeling hungry all the time so stick with it.

Eat more low calorie, low carb foods. It'll be REALLY hard because it won't taste as good and your body will crave your old habit.  DO NOT CHEAT AT ALL. Not even once. Go cold turkey and cut soda, beer, and ALL fast food. If you allow yourself to have it once in a while it'll be once a month... then every 2 weeks, then every week... slipperly slope. Just do NOT cheat ever.  Lots of vegatables you can just eat all day every day. The point is to fill your stomach so you don't feel hungry anymore (outside of your planned meals.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c82vb,blessis,3,Sun Jul 5 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"With eating less red meat comes new protein sources and more poultry and fish. I'm not exactly an expert, but eggs, especially the whites, are high in protein. The yolk is higher in fat if memory serves, so if you're worried about that then remove the yolks.  Chicken will be good. If you can get your hands on some cheaper chicken breast, a barbeque will be your friend. My favourite thing to do with chicken is grill it and some vegetables then add some hot sauce on top. Toss some brown rice in there and you have a good hearty meal that's still fairly cheap. Alternatively, buying frozen veggies is cheaper, but you unfortunately can't grill those as easily.  Tuna sandwiches can be a great lunch. Tuna is one of my favourite kinds of fish and a can is a meal. If you don't like tuna, canned salmon can be substituted or you could make it into patties. My mom always used to make them and I'm pretty sure she just used a few cans of salmon mixed with some bread crumbs and an egg or two, similar to how you'd make hamburgers.  Finally, don't forget about lentils. They're low in fat but incredibly high in protein. From what I understand, lentil soup is fairly easy to make but you can also steam them and eat them mixed in with rice or on their own.   I hope your diet goes well :)  Edit: this lentil soup recipe  sounds delicious and fairly easy to make  http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-red-lentil-soup-recipes-from-the-kitchn-212392"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3c82vb,UgandaBeKidding,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:50:01 2015 UTC,"A relevant comment in this thread was deleted. You can read it below.    Not to be a downer, but just to get this out of the way: A lot of people underestimate just how much sugar there is in fruit. This is not inherently a bad thing, obviously, but it's sometimes easy to fall into the trap of going ""I'm gonna eat healthy, fruits are healthy!"" and next thing you know you're slamming down an amazing amount of sugar every day.  Now, just to emphasize the point: Your body needs sugar. Your brain runs on glucose, and glucose is a type of sugar. But the way your body is ""meant"" to work, for lack of a better way of putting it, is for you to eat mostly things called complex carbohydrates two or three times a day. You stuff your stomach full (well, partly full) of mostly carbohydrates, and then your digestive system spends hours converting those carbohydrates down into individual glucose molecules. This process — starting with big, complex carbohydrate molecules and then digesting them gradually over hours — gives your body a nice, steady supply of glucose throughout the day. That's what people are adapted to; it's what works best.  So if you want to aim for that, then a good place to start is to identify a set of staple carbs and build your personal cuisine around them. I'm from Louisiana — I grew up there though I live elsewhere now — so my staple carb is rice. I'd say not quite half of the suppers I eat include rice. Rice is extremely economical; I'll buy a 20-pound sack of the stuff and store it in a large, airtight Cambro tub. As long as you keep the weevils out, dry rice has an indefinite shelf life. That forms the basis of my jambalayas, my beans and rice, my shrimp a la Creole, my gumbos, all that stuff.

Slice up preferred veggies and sprinkle on top (red and green peppers, red onion, black olive, cucumber, and mushroom shown) very little amount needed per veggie. I used only one slice of mushroom to cover the whole thing so it's great to take care of those little leftovers you have no other use for.  Now sprinkle with feta cheese and pop back in the oven for about 5 minutes or until cheese is lightly browned.   The pita bread and the cheese are the only expensive parts.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3c553q,AzureMagelet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"My husband and I spend about $60-$80 each week on groceries. We cook most nights, and eat leftovers for lunch the next day. It takes some planning, but can be broken down into the following components: 1) Look at the grocery store circular. Brainstorm meal ideas based on sale items to get you through one week. 2) Put the selected items into the calendar. Write the grocery list based on these menu items. 3) Go shopping and get everything you need for the week. 4) If meat or other staples are on sale, buy more than you need and freeze/store the rest.  It takes a little while to get the idea of what a ""good deal"" is for certain products, but you can save a lot of money by knowing what is a great sale vs. saving five cents.  Congrats on your future nuptials!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bvqns,pleatedmeat,27,Thu Jul 2 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"One of the things I have become obsessed with over the years is using cabbage instead of lettuce in burritos/tacos. It should freeze a bit better but won't come out as crisp after being frozen. It will end up more like a cooked cabbage after being microwaved. In my opinion though, it's still a million times better than soggy lettuce.   Try chopped cabbage in your fresh burritos/tacos too! Mmmmmm"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bvqns,BungViper,6,Thu Jul 2 17:45:45 2015 UTC,Maybe just go with KimChi instead of fresh cabbage? This would be real good if you used pork in your burritos too.

When you go to cook them from frozen, presumably using a microwave, how appetizing do you think that lettuce and tomato will be once nuked for 5 minutes or so? I wish there was a solution to this, other than having fresh stuff to add after reheating them.  I have seen a store-bought freezer burrito that has lettuce and tomato in it."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bvqns,eastcoastian,8,Thu Jul 2 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"Instead of fresh tomatoes, maybe a hot sauce or something would be better."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bvqns,justkilledaman,6,Thu Jul 2 16:32:08 2015 UTC,"Don't do lettuce... it will become mush after freezing. Also don't do anything that you wouldn't want to microwave or put in the oven/heat up... like sour cream. You could do spinach or some other greens that you'd want soggy as if they were sauted.  I do freezer burritos with black beans, refried beans, and cheese. I also cook some ground beef with onion, peppers, seasoning, and canned diced tomato and add that. If I don't have canned tomato, I just dump some salsa in every burrito. Shred the cheese so it cooks better when you reheat. They taste better texture wise when reheated in the oven, but I usually just do the microwave. I like to wrap each burrito individually, then put them all in a giant freezer bag. Usually I just wrap the individual burritos in smaller quart or sandwich bags, but I've seen people wrap them up in saran or foil too. The sandwich bag is handier if you're taking them to work.  Also your title... it should be ""Are there ingredients..."""

Add some salsa chicken (chicken that's been cooked in a crock pot with a jar of salsa, shredded, fricken delicious).  Your pot will kinda look like puke but it will taste oh so good in a burrito.  All of those ingredients freeze and reheat pretty well in my experience.  Sometimes I also put some shredded cheddar/pepper jack cheese on the tortilla before adding filling and wrapping."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bvqns,passionfruitsoyum,3,Thu Jul 2 18:28:08 2015 UTC,I make frozen burritos at every meal prep. One thing I've found is that spreading sour cream or plain greek yogurt on the tortilla before adding your fillings really helps the texture of the tortilla when you reheat. Definitely skip the lettuce. Peppers work best if you dice them and just get a good sear.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bvpua,Invictus11,12,Fri Jul 3 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"I use it to make soup! I'm a vegetarian, so I use the veggie one. It is my ""clean out the fridge"" recipe I usually sautée a bunch of veggies that are about to go bad in a bit of olive oil. Onion is a must, then I usually do some combo of carrots, bell pepper, broccoli, zucchini, asparagus, cauliflower, cherry tomatoes - seriously, do all the veggies, whatever is in the house! Don't cook the veggies all the way; they should be crisp but not crunchy because they will get simmered for awhile.   Then, I add a bunch of water so that my veggies are floating around in the water like soup, and I add enough of the Better Than Bullion for the amount of water I did. I usually start light on the BTB because you can always add more later. Then I bring the veggie/water/bullion mixture to a boil and add a cup or so of lentils, and then simmer until the lentils are cooked (15-25 minutes). BAM! Lentil soup! While the lentils are cooking, I usually add rosemary, thyme, red chili flakes, and sometimes a dash of soy sauce or vegetarian worcester sauce while everything is still cooking. Curry is also a yummy spice to add.   I have also added rice, quinoa, barley, and couscous to the soup when I had those items in the house. You just toss in your longest cooking grain/legume first, and then add the other stuff at the appropriate remaining time. If you are going to cook a grain or legume that requires more than 30 minutes of cook time, I would probably not recommend the one-pot method described here because your veggies will just turn to mush.   I make a huge batch of this soup and then put it into Tupperware containers and freeze it and it is still yummy when reheated. I've made it soup-like, with lots of liquid, but I've also made it more like a thick stew, with much less liquid. I prefer the thicker consistency because it is heartier! Anyyyway. This was a really long description of soup! But it is so easy and delicious, and Better Than Bullion is essential to make it yummy!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bvpua,Steeps87,11,Thu Jul 2 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"Better than bullion is great for making a rich flavor base for soups, sauces, and broths or stocks. Since its a paste rather than a brick, it dissolves fast which makes it easier to mix into stuff. Basically use it as a base for recipes that need broth or stock or are a sauce. I'm pretty sure they list some uses on the jar.  Also, to make a beef stock, just follow the directions on the jar. Add more or less of the stuff to suit your flavor needs."

If you do it like you often get in bistros, where the soup is really just a cheese vehicle, yeah, not healthy at all. But at the end of the day, onion soup is just caramelized onions + broth. Even if you do the cheese toast aspect, it's no less healthy than having a soup and a sandwich.  Cheaping out on the cheese will also make it very affordable to make.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bxcf1,NerdsWithKnives,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"To cook perfect plain white rice for any application, read the following:  The usual ratio of water to rice is 2:1, but there is a much easier method for cooking rice that requires absolutely no measuring at all and results in perfectly cooked and steamed rice every single time.   You will need a cooking pot with a lid, lid is not optional or you will not be able to steam the rice.  Steaming the rice is also not optional. Fill pot with water and heat till boiling. Add rice to pot of boiling water, doesn't matter how much, just remember that cooked rice is about twice the size of uncooked rice so I suggest you imagine how much cooked rice you will need and grab about half that amount.   (Optional step: Rinse your rice with cold water (not hot water, we don't want trigger the rice to start rehydrating and sticking to itself) before throwing into the pot, this will give you a slightly improved texture in the end, but its often negligible.)   Set a timer on your cellphone for exactly 7 minutes and have it start as soon as you throw the rice into the pot.  Then, stir the rice around in the boiling water for the first 1-2 minutes so that none of the grains try to stick to each other. 7 minutes later, turn off the heat, take rice off the heat and dump the rice through a strainer.  The rice may not be completely cooked at this point yet, that is fine.  DO NOT RINSE THE RICE! DO NOT RINSE THE POT! Carefully wipe the cooking pot clean. Place pot back onto the still warm stove with the heat still off, pour strained rice back into the empty, still warm, pot and cover with a lid. Come back 20-30 minutes later and check doneness.  The residual heat and the intense steam coming off the boiling hot rice being trapped by the lid will have done two things.  It will finish cooking the rice to perfect doneness.  It will allow some of the liquid still trapped inside the rice to evaporate out, drying the rice slightly and preventing it from becoming mushy and ""tightening"" the surface of each and every grain resulting in a very nice texture where every grain feels separate. Enjoy perfectly cooked rice!   The recipe I use here is a modified version of this recipe here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuPABfgsa4g  Just skip the potatoes (careful control of how much heat you apply negates their necessity) and all the seasonings etc if you just want plain white rice.

But honestly, a Big Mac is probably a miracle wonder cure for malnutrition.  You can make most recipes without ""specialty"" ingredients. You just see things like olive oil, fancy cheese, etc. in magazine and Food Network recipes because they are partially developed to show off the expensive ingredients their sponsors are selling. Buy vegetable oil, regular cheese from the supermarket, generic brands, etc.   Re kosher salt vs. regular salt, you may need to adjust the amount you use. Kosher salt flakes are bigger, which means you get less, errrr, ""saltiness"" within a given measurement.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bqxkh,MsAlign,7,Wed Jul 1 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of cabbage as a cheap and healthy vegetable. It's cheap per weight unit, comes in many different variants, very versatile for cooking and keeps really well both in and out of the fridge. A few tasty, low-effort things that I usually like to make:   Cabbage Salad: Slice cabbage into thin strips, Dump into bowl. Make a dressing consisting of oil, vinegar and seasoning of choice (I usually like salt, pepper, paprika and a bit of ketchup). Toss cabbage in dressing and let it sit at room temperature for 30-ish minutes. This gives the vinegar a chance to tenderize the cabbage a bit. Toss salad again, and then eat! Fried Cabbage: Slice up cabbage, add salt and pepper (and optionally a bit of hotsauce), and fry in an oil/butter mix. Cook until desired tenderness, and then stuff into face. Optionally add in a bit of onion and garlic. Cabbage ""Lasagna"": Basically a lazy man's cabbage roll type thing. Make your stuffing with ground meat of choice, rice, possibly beans, and spices. Layer things in a dish. I usually go: Cabbage leaves, chopped tomatoes (straight from a can, no need to get fancy), stuffing, and then repeat until I run out. thinner layers is better. Bake for 30-45 minutes and enjoy. Oil/Vinegar Coleslaw: Sliced/grated cabbage and carrots. A basic oil/vinegar dressing. Roasted sesame seeds for added flavor. Yummy, and lean enough in taste that you can eat a giant portion of it. Stewed Cabbage: Steam/lightly boil sliced cabbage in a pot, together with some vegetable stock (I use bullion cubes). Add milk, salt, pepper and thickener (corn starch or similar products) to make a thick milky ""sauce"". Let it stew until cabbage is tender, then shove into face.   Different kinds of cabbage produce pretty varying tastes and textures (all of them good though)."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bqxkh,thecipher,3,Wed Jul 1 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"Also try grilling. You would be surprised what holds up on the grill! I frequently do corn on the cob since it is cheap this time of year (soak it in some water for a minute before you throw it on) and I will throw either a little cheese- feta/queso/Parmesan- or some spices. Kick it up with a little smoked paprika and chili powder. You can definitely do this with broccoli as well- olive oil, s/p, and red pepper flakes are awesome there.  Kale also holds up well on the grill with some olive oil, salt, pepper and lemon. Go ahead and grill the lemon as well and just throw it on top when you serve"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bqxkh,thatkitchenlifebro,3,Wed Jul 1 15:55:19 2015 UTC,"Use any of your favorite vegetables (I personally use broccoli, green beans, and carrots) and mix in a bowl with olive oil, pepper, garlic, and salt.

I like to add acidity, especially with greens, in the form of vinegar or lemon, and use the pan lid to steam briefly, which really brings out the colors.

A lot of mild flavors are masked well with chocolate, and if you have mint, you could make mint chocolate flavored oatmeal. Or some other mint chocolate concoction, like a smoothie...or using mint tea as the liquid portion in a chocolate cake batter...etc.  Green tea works well with savory dishes - I've even made savory oatmeal with a bit of spinach and hummus mixed in. I've also used green tea as part of the broth in a stir-fry.  Rooibos or chamomile would be nice with a fruity flavor, or maybe a warm vanilla or cinnamon profile. I've used those a lot with oatmeal before.   Best wishes!"

Unless you have special dietary needs (ie, weightlifter, underweight person on a gaining diet), eating a small amount of meat once or twice a day should be more than enough. You could try adding more non-meat protein, like Greek yogurt and peanut butter, and more fiber to help fill you up on the cheap. You could also eat more eggs: cheap, meat-y, and very filling.  On top of easye's great suggestions, I find that chicken thighs, pork loin, skirt steak, and chuck roast are generally quite cheap as well.

You can get Pork shoulder, chicken thighs, stew meat, etc for way less than steaks.  Also a chest freezer is a great investment for both stocking up on meats, and freezing leftovers.  I got one for $200 on Amazon (Black Friday Sale), and it paid for itself in short order."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bm6mt,fitwithmindy,45,Tue Jun 30 18:02:14 2015 UTC,So there is this very classic Chinese cucumber cold dish everyone used to make when it is summer back when I lived in China. You take a cucumber and cut it into small pieces. Then you season it very well with salt and pepper. Then you want to crack a garlic (very important) with a knife and then mix the garlic with the cucumber. You then finish off with some sesame oil and soy sauce. A bit high in sodium but very tasty dish.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bm6mt,shittymonkeysuit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:31:25 2015 UTC,This is basically how I make my spinach. I learned it from a Korean cooking video. It basically is how you make Korean spinach side dish.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bm6mt,fitwithmindy,2,Tue Jun 30 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Try this instead: 1. Boil water  2. Pour boiled water in a large bowl  3. Put the (washed) spinach in the bowl, stir it around a bit to submerge the leaves until the split second they turn green ( individually picked spinach leaves take seconds, whole spinach might take 10-20s)  4. Drain the water and gently squeeze the extra water out. Season as described above.  This method is the one used by my family as well as all of my Korean friends. It takes off the stinging taste of raw spinach while keeping the crunch and aroma. Also helps to use whole Korean spinach and not the packaged leaves sold for salads. (Korean spinach looks more like bok choy)"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bm6mt,shstew,3,Tue Jun 30 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"I've probably posted them before but I like slicing them into little rounds and then using like you would with crackers, so putting various toppings/spreads on them. Great with cream cheese or other types of cheese, smoked salmon and cream cheese, little piles of deli meat (turkey, chicken, salami, whatever you like), or hummus and chicken or whatever. Pretty much use with any topping you would put on a cracker... it saves carbs/fat and makes for really crisp, refreshing cracker that takes on whatever flavour you go with. I also sometimes user cucumbers like you would with a bread/bun for sandwiches! Take a medium length cucumber, cut off the very ends where there's that stem part and slice in half lengthwise. Take a spoon and scoop out a little bit of the middle area where all the seeds and stuff are so that it's a bit hollow and a bit less wet/slippery. Then spread the insides with hummus, cream cheese, mayo, whatever you like and fill with deli meat, tuna, salmon, egg salad, etc. It makes for a really fresh, crisp sandwich without the carbs from a bunch of bread. You can eat each cucumber ""boat/bun"" open faced if you like (necessary if you mound a lot of filling) or closed up like a sandwich if you do a thinner layer of meat."

Peel & core one cucumber, then grate it on the coarse part of a cheese grater, line a colander with paper towels and put the cucumber shreds to get the moisture out.  Grate a small-medium onion - white, yellow, red - and combine with the cucumber.  Blend an 8 oz block of room-temperature cream cheese with a 16 oz carton of sour cream until it's as smooth as you can get it.  I only use a fork to do this, not a blender or mixer.  Season liberally to taste with either fresh minced garlic cloves or garlic powder.  Add about a tsp of salt.  Sometimes I add about 1/2 a tsp of cayenne pepper (you can use powdered or something like Louisiana Hot Sauce).  Mix everything together well -- sprinkle the top with paprika to make it pretty if you like.  I like this dip best with either Ruffles potato chips or Fritos Scoops.  It's one of my favorite things and I've been making it so long that it was difficult to come up with measurements because I usually don't use them!

Mix it all up, then pour some oil, garlic, and either lemon juice or vinegar over it.  Let it sit a little while, ideally overnight to soften the onion and garlic flavors.  You can serve it as-is, or over romaine, or add chicken.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bmjyd,talonofdrangor,3,Wed Jul 1 13:32:46 2015 UTC,"I mentioned in another comment that it makes at least 4 servings, so ofc nobody will consume the whole amount in one sitting. Besides, I don't really get your point - you're free to alter the recipe or just dont make it if you don't like the fat/protein ratio, but that doesn't make it ""wrong"" or unhealthy in general. Nuts have a lot of fat too and are healthy, many people on keto eat really high fat diets - as long as one doesn't eat too many calories in general, it should be fine."

Doesn't need to be leftovers unless that's what you want.

I agree that most posts in the sub are about having a ready-to-eat meal all ready for when you want it. But strictly speaking you could just do your portioning and cutting up and stuff in advance. (I did up 12 stirfry ready packs of meat, nuts and veg, they weren't sitting in the freezer cooked, they just waited for a lazy day dinner.)    except the onion   See, that's the sort of stuff you could look into that sub to see if it's doable. (pretty sure it'll be fine by the way. As long as you keep it cold nothing bad will happen, and if you're worried you can always cut it into portions and freeze the last couple of days worth)  From what you describe in your other comments I think a lunch dedicated sub is  not a bad idea.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bo1nc,tph3,3,Tue Jun 30 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"Lots of things are great in the freezer, but they tend to be winter foods. Pasta, chili, soups and stews, stir fry, and most mexican dishes often taste better the 2nd time around. Some things are no good at all. Some veggies get slimy the 2nd time around, like squash, spinach, or kale. Most anything that is made and served in 1 pot is going to work pretty well the 2nd time around so long as you reheat properly. The microwave is a great tool, but it can also wreck your food. Educate yourself on how to properly defrost things. Thaw them in the fridge if you can. Some things reheat better in the oven if you have the proper containers.  Also try making sauces ahead of time and freezing them. I make a ton of pesto in the summer when basil is cheap and in the winter all you have to do is boil some water for noodles and nuke the pesto and you are golden."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bo1nc,benicebitch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"Oh a crockpot is excellent. Most anything you make in a crockpot will stand up in a freezer for a pretty long time. What you really want to avoid are things that kinda look like lettuce.  A big basil leaf is gross the 2nd time. You have to experiment, but honestly if you find a recipe you like, google will XXXX freeze well, and probably somebody has tried it.  Just remembered, I did an eggplant lasagna that was total shit after the first day. Big chucks of veggies are gross the 2nd time. Tofu is pretty good, though the texture will change so if you are sensitive to texture experiment.  One of the things I do is prep things ahead of time. Doesnt' work with everything, but lots of things you can prep the night before and cook the day of.   Start with recipes for things you like, and work backward from there. Google ingredients you like + recipe. Read the comments on the recipes too. Of course half of them are bozos who triple the cheese or something, but you can pick up some good tips that way."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bo1nc,misty_donna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"Hi! I've tried this one month freezer meal plan from Aldi though you could get the ingredients at just about any main grocery store. I will say that some of her recipes were really high in fat especially, and I cut down by doing reduced-fat milk or cheese when I could. But I was out of a job for a month and I'm just so glad I made these meals a few days before that, otherwise we would have been screwed!  Also, I didn't learn this till the second or third time around, but when you're doing freezer meals, make sure you let the ziploc bags freeze while they are flat, that way you can store several right on top of each other as opposed to letting them freeze while they are upright and taking up a lot more space. Make sure you get good quality ziploc bags that specifically say they are for the freezer! We've been (freezer) burned before."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3boccl,sexytimespanda,2,Tue Jun 30 21:35:10 2015 UTC,"I like to roast the bones a bit before I make stock. Gives a slightly richer flavor. Use veggies, onion, carrot, celery.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3boccl,NerdsWithKnives,2,Tue Jun 30 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"The best and easiest way to make broth is throw all the chicken parts and/or veggies into a slow cooker, fill with water, and let it cook on low for 12-24 hours.

Then I added in about a cup of frozen broccoli and a cup of frozen green beans with a touch of garlic chili paste. I cooked that up and waited for my rice to finish.

I sprayed the inside of the slow cooker with Pam, then lined the bottom with 4 peeled and cubed Yukon gold potatoes and about 1/2 pound of baby carrots. I stabbed both sides of the chuck steaks several times with a meat fork, then rubbed a little McCormick steak seasoning in to them.  I very, very lightly browned them in a pan with some olive oil and garlic. Then I settled them on top of thr carrots and potatoes, added some raw onion, and topped them with a gravy mix my family likes to put in slow cooker beef: 2 cans of golden mushroom soup, 1 package of onion soup mix, and 1-2 cans of water. Cooked it on low from about 11:30am to 5:30pm.   The veggies are cooked perfectly and the meat is so tender and soft, you can cut it with a fork. And of course, chuck is really beefy and flavorful. Hurrah!  There's enough to feed 3-4 people, depending on their appetites and if you cook another veggie.

One of my favorite things to do is chicken thighs (they come in a pretty large package) with carrots and potatoes.  I season as I like and bake them in the oven for like 45 minutes to an hour and I'm good for the next 3-4 days (depending on how many times I eat it for lunch too).  Chili is always a good meal to make when you are trying to save money.  A big pot of it gets me through at least four days.    Not too different from Chili but I did a big pot goulash a few weeks ago with ground turkey.  It wasn't exciting but it was cheap (I've been on a tight budget because of vet bills for the past month or so).  Green beans and red potatoes in the crockpot (low for the whole day while you are at work).  You can bake chicken (thighs or legs are cheaper) when you get home and have food for days.

Remove the core from the cabbage and cut into thin strips. Slice the onion into thin strips. Cut the broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Slice the chicken into thin strips.  Begin boiling a medium pot full of water for the noodles. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the grated ginger, saute for about 30 seconds to one minute (its okay if it sticks to the pan but don’t let it burn). Add the chicken strips and cook until they are no longer pink (about five minutes).  Once the chicken is cooked through, add all of the vegetables. Stir and cook until wilted (about 5-10 minutes). Meanwhile, once the water boils, add the noodles and cook just until tender (2-3 minutes). Drain, return to the pot (with the heat turned off) and toss with the sesame oil to keep from sticking.  In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sriracha, and sugar. Use only ½ tsp of sriracha if you don’t want it spicy, use up to 1 Tbsp if you like it hot. Stir until the ketchup and sugar are dissolved. Pour the sauce into the skillet with the chicken and vegetables with the heat still on medium high. Add the noodles, stir to coat everything in the sauce, and heat through (just a few minutes)."

There just wasn't enough time in the day to get in all the healthy calories I needed otherwise! And I hate going to bed on a full stomach so my dinners tend to be the lightest meal of the day.  I almost always have eggs, since they're a cheap and easy source of protein. My favorite on the go breakfast is two eggs, a small potato cut up and fried, some cheese, mushrooms, and spinach wrapped up in one of those huge wraps. Make it the night before-- heck, make several for the week-- so you can just grab it, microwave it, and go.   On alternate days when I don't feel like eating eggs, I'll have some greek yogurt and then make a breakfast BLT with avocado instead of lettuce.

Recipe below.  In addition to making Shepherd's Pie I also prepped the 4 lbs of chicken leg quarters I bought. I feel pretty iffy about the quality of the meat, and I tend to procrastinate on cooking if I have to defrost meat in advance. So I roasted the chicken, pulled off the meat I'll use for Chicken Curry later in the week, and set the skin and bones aside for stock. I am not sure how feasible this type of thing would be if you are a single person with a full time job.   I finish Day 1 full, satisfied, and wishing my $30 of groceries had included a beer.  SHEPHERD'S PIE RECIPE  5 medium sized baking potatoes, peeled and chopped approximately into 8ths  1 cup milk  1.25 lb ground pork  1/2 a small package of frozen peas  about 1/3 stick butter  salt to taste  First, I made mashed potatoes. If you don't know how, basically you boil the potatoes (prepped as above) until they are fork-tender. Drain them, then use a fork or masher or whatever you have to mash them. Add milk as you mash. Salt liberally. Try not to either over-boil or over-mash the potatoes or you will end up with wallpaper paste and not mashed potatoes. These ingredients made about a quart of mash. I'd have liked a bit more; if I do this recipe in the future I might add a 6th potato.  After you make the mashed potatoes, preheat the oven to 400.   Next, it's time to brown the meat. Since I used pork, I was pretty aggressive about this and browned it until there was no pink at all.   Most Shepherd's Pie recipes call for some kind of gravy. Since I don't have the ingredients for gravy and the pork rendered out a lot of juices, I decided to wing it. If you're using a leaner meat (especially turkey) you should definitely add something for moisture, even if all you can do is some water and a buillion cube or Worcestershire sauce.    Put your browned meat into a baking dish. I used my 5-quart dutch oven, which IMO was a little bigger than ideal. Top with frozen peas. Layer the mashed potatoes on top like you're icing a cake. I added butter both on top of the peas and also on top of the potatoes, because I was worried about the whole gravy issue. Salt, pepper, and season to taste. (I added a few sprinkles of hot sauce.)  Put the baking dish into the oven for 15 minutes or until the potatoes begin to brown. Allow to rest for another 15 minutes after removing from the oven.  HOW LONG DID IT TAKE? Probably half an hour of active cooking, including making mashed potatoes from scratch. Including oven and resting time it took about an hour to do. If you did the potatoes in advance, closer to half an hour.  HOW MUCH DID IT COST? About $5 for 4 huge servings.  HOW WAS IT? 7/10. I would have liked some more spices and maybe a mix of fresh seasonal vegetables, but honestly I would 100% make this again. My main worry right now is that I eat the whole dish tonight and don't have leftovers."

I certainly don't live in one of the most expensive places in the US, but I am really interested in the price of food in different areas, and what you'd end up eating to get by.   Hey mods, maybe it would be cool to do regional budget challenge lists? :D"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,IdentityCr1sis,3,Tue Jun 30 19:08:50 2015 UTC,":O  hm.  I definitely think receipts are a must. Maybe two pictures, one of the receipt and the actual items sitting on a counter with a meal plan for the week?   I'm not particularly interested in specific recipes or images of each of the meals prepared.   Oh! And a listing of the target calories/day would also be helpful in determining the doability of any shopping list. if you're super active your average 1900 cal/day budget just won't work.   Another potential shade of the competition would be hitting a special dietary goal. Gluten free, vegetarian/vegan, paleo or whatever lists are sure to help some people that come round looking for advice."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,randoh12,7,Wed Jul 1 07:19:14 2015 UTC,"SECOND DAY UPDATE  Breakfast: 2 cups of tea with milk and sugar. Leftover Shepherd's Pie and a soft-boiled egg.  Lunch: Stuffed grape leaves from a can I already had in the pantry.  Dinner: Japanese Chicken Curry Rice. Recipe below.  Today I also turned the chicken bones and skin into stock. If you've never done this before, it's dead easy. This time I added all my chicken trimmings, half an onion chopped into rough slices, and a few cloves of garlic smashed with the back of a knife. I covered this with water, then I added a tablespoon of salt, a healthy grind of pepper, and some other spices. I let it simmer on low all afternoon while doing other stuff. It's done when the liquid reduces down into glorious schmaltzy deliciousness. The pickings from 4 lb of chicken came to about a gallon of stock, which is more than I can possibly get through this week.  JAPANESE CURRY RICE WITH CHICKEN RECIPE  1 box Japanese Curry Roux. Available in the International aisle of most supermarkets, but look out for it in Japanese groceries where it runs about $1.50.  1/2 an onion, diced finely  3 medium sized baking potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1/4 inch cubes  1/2 a bag of frozen mixed veggies  1 lb pulled roast chicken. This is what I used, but you can add pretty much any meat, from a hamburger patty to ground turkey.   2 cups chicken stock  1.5 cups water  1/2 cup dry rice for each person eating  -- THE CURRY --  In a dutch oven or high-sided saucepan saute the onion in vegetable oil or butter until translucent. Add the potato, and, if you are using raw meat (as opposed to pre-cooked), now would be the time to add that. When your potatoes are starting to become tender/meat is browned, add the chicken stock and water. Bring to a boil.   Because I used pre-cooked meat, I added it after bringing the liquid to a boil. Also add the frozen veggies and return to a simmer. Once the liquid is simmering again, add the curry roux. Mix it into the stew until it dissolves, creating a gorgeous fragrant sauce. Allow to simmer a few more minutes, just to get all the flavors to come together. Salt to taste and crack a bit of black pepper over the top. It is now ready to serve.  -- THE RICE --  Make a pot of rice. As one does.   When the rice is done, plate in a bowl and top with as much curry as you want. EAT IT NOW.  HOW LONG DID IT TAKE? Maybe half an hour? You're basically just assembling ingredients and heating them up. This is classic Racheal Ray/Sandra Lee territory.  HOW MUCH DID IT COST? $5 for... so much curry. Like, so much. The curry box suggests this will feed 6. Maybe six teenage boys?  HOW WAS IT? 10/10 Would make every day for the rest of my life. SO GOOD. Caps-lock good. Remembering that terrible yogurt commercial from the early aughts good.   A note about this recipe: if you live somewhere that Japanese Curry Roux isn't available, you can make it from scratch by making a roux with butter and flour and then adding Thai yellow curry paste or copious amounts of curry powder. You can also use this recipe without the curry to make the base for a chicken pot pie or chicken and dumplings.  EDIT: It just occurred to me that you could make the most delicious chicken pot pie ever by topping this with a thing of those pop-can biscuits and throwing it in the oven till the biscuits bake."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,randoh12,4,Wed Jul 1 01:07:19 2015 UTC,"FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH DAY UPDATES  Hello and welcome back from the Dark Times! Now that this sub is public again I'm going to update you guys on how the experiment has been going.  THURSDAY  Breakfast: Tea with milk and sugar. Oatmeal with milk and maple syrup.  Lunch: Leftover Chicken Curry Rice  Dinner: Potato and Caramelized Onion Soup with a soft-boiled egg.  Today I had my first recipe mishap. The recipe itself is a good one, and it would have turned out great if I had prevented one small problem. So I'm going to include the recipe anyway along with what I did wrong and how it could have been fixed. It's important to know that sometimes you mess up dinner, and it's not the end of the world. I don't want anyone to think I'm some kind of perfect chef or anything.  Potato And Caramelized Onion Soup Recipe  This is a recipe adapted from Julia Child's Potage Parmentier, in Mastering The Art Of French Cooking.   1 onion, diced very small  5 baking potatoes, diced very small  1/3 stick of butter  1.5 quarts chicken stock  salt and pepper to taste  Melt butter in a stock pot or dutch oven and add onions. With heat on medium/low, sautee the onions in butter until they are nicely browned and caramelized. Once you've achieved the desired caramelized onion result, add the potatoes and the stock. Simmer until the potatoes are soft enough to mash. Salt to taste. (This will probably be quite a bit of salt as potatoes are naturally bland and really suck up salt well.)  Now, here's where I went wrong. Halfway through making this recipe, it occurred to me that I no longer have an immersion blender. I could have anticipated that, cooked the potatoes in advance, and added them to the soup in the form of mashed potatoes. But sadly, no. After reaching the ""simmer until potatoes are soft"" point in the recipe, I was forced to try to puree the soup with a fork. Which didn't work all that well. If you have an immersion blender or some other efficient way of pureeing potatoes, use it at this point! If you don't, learn from my mistake and find a workaround in advance!  Once the soup is pureed and well-seasoned, it's ready to eat!   HOW LONG DID IT TAKE? This was actually a pretty time consuming recipe, what with the teensy weensy dicing and the caramelizing (which takes quite a while). It would have gone faster if I'd had an immersion blender, but even so, I'd say this is probably an hour of active prep time.   HOW MUCH DID IT COST? $2, for a LOT of very rich soup.  HOW WAS IT? 5/10. A great-tasting soup, but my pureeing fiasco turned a delicious meal into a so-so one. If I hadn't messed this up I could easily have given this a perfect score.  FRIDAY  Breakfast: I slept in and skipped breakfast aside from a cup of tea with milk and sugar.  Lunch: Because I skipped breakfast, I did a sort of ""brunch"" thing and had a 3-egg omelet with wild fennel fronds I foraged from a vacant lot on my street.   Dinner: Leftover Shepherd's Pie.   I am beginning to think I will never get to the end of the Shepherd's Pie, which I cooked on the very first day of this experiment and still have plenty of as of this writing (Sunday!)  SATURDAY  Breakfast: I slept in again and skipped breakfast aside from a cup of tea with milk and sugar and some tastes of my pasta salad as I finished seasoning it.  Lunch: Pasta Salad With Zucchini, Fresh Cheese, And Wild Foraged Herbs. Among other things at a Fourth Of July barbecue I attended. The recipe is below.  Dinner: I ate so much at the barbecue that I didn't really have dinner per se.  Confession: I realized that my originally planned Pasta Salad was not going to have enough flavor, so I went back to the store and spent $3.50 on lemons and cheese. Bringing my total grocery bill for the week to $33.60.  Pasta Salad With Zucchini, Fresh Cheese, And Wild-Foraged Herbs Recipe  1 lb package of short pasta. I used penne because I had it in the house, but you could use anything from Bowties to Fusilli to whatever you like for pasta salads.  4 zucchini, quartered and sliced very thin  2 cloves minced garlic  the juice and zest of 2 lemons  5 ounces fresh cheese cut into bite-sized chunks. I used Queso Ranchero, because I was at the Mexican grocery, it was cheap, and I wanted my dish to have a very local, terroir-based flavor. However, if I make this again I think a more flavorful cheese like chevre or feta would work better.  2 stalks of wild backyard mint, chiffonaded.  5 wild fennel shoots, chopped up small (these are the feathery little green frondy bits you will often see growing on wild fennel before it bolts, or presumably garden fennel if you wait a little too long to harvest it)  copious amounts of olive oil  salt to taste  (NOTE: if you're not into foraging wild herbs, or you don't have any way of doing that, almost any fresh herb will work here. I'd especially recommend parsley, anything in the mint family, dill, tarragon, or even oregano. Something fresh and light. Dried herbs will not work in this recipe.)  Cook the pasta in especially well-salted water according to the instructions on the package, but leave it in the water for an extra minute or so. (Cold pasta shouldn't be al dente in the way hot sauced pastas are.) Strain and rinse with cold water to cool the pasta.   Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a saucepan over high heat. When the oil is warm, add the garlic and zucchini. Saute the zucchini until it's soft and transparent. Add half the mint, half the fennel, and salt to taste. Fold in the herbs and remove the pan from the heat.   Place the cold pasta in a large mixing bowl. Add the hot zucchini/garlic/herb mixture, the remaining fresh herbs, the cheese, and a generous pour of olive oil. Squeeze in the juice of the lemons. Mix well.   At this point, I covered it and let it sit in the fridge overnight. You should refrigerate it for at least a few hours, to the point where it's a cold salad rather than just lukewarm pasta.   After refrigerating, add another good glug of olive oil, give it a toss, and taste to see how the flavors have come together. Correct seasoning if necessary. Add lemon zest to taste. Put it out on your picnic table next to the BBQ and go to town!  HOW LONG DID IT TAKE? Not counting the fridge time, this was super quick. It's basically like making pasta for dinner, where you do the noodles at the same time as you put together the sauce.  20 minutes, max.  HOW MUCH DID IT COST? $5, though it would be more if you bought the herbs from a supermarket. It would easily serve 4-6 as a side and would be something I'd be eating on for another week if I'd made it just for myself.  HOW WAS IT? 7/10, because I wish the cheese had more flavor. This is one of those recipes that is really only as good as the quality of the ingredients. Which can be tough when you're on a serious budget. On the other hand, it got positively demolished at the bbq potluck I brought it to."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,Nilaxa,3,Sun Jul 5 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"I'm very interested in how this turns out! Living in an expensive market area, some of that list doesn't work for me here.  That said, in defense of the author of the original, the price lists the OP used are from Tennessee, which probably has substantially lower food prices than you do in SoCal. I've lived in both suburban Texas and in a few major cities on the coasts and can say that the prices in Texas were way lower than I get now, especially on things like meat. I about died from shock the first time I went grocery shopping in LA. In addition, I notice the original post has a variety of stores, almost all discount ones, listed. So that also benefits the writer's budget. So it might not be an issue of reality but one of geography :)"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,Zelcron,2,Mon Jun 29 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"Having lived in a few different parts of the country, I feel like there are strengths and weaknesses in different areas depending on where you are. Here in L.A., meat and dairy are not cheap. Whereas fresh produce is amazing, diverse, and they practically pay you to take it. When I lived in New York, specialty items and prepared foods were surprisingly affordable, and there was great local dairy and cheese. When I lived in the South, staples like milk and ground beef were cheaper because the cost of living in general is cheaper.  Also, I picked the Mexican grocery because I thought it most closely approximated the whole Aldi/Dollar General/WalMart thing. In future weeks I may search for better deals by rotating to different stores (there's a chain of 99 cent stores here that offers legendary deals on food), but it doesn't make sense to go to 2 or 3 different places for food for 1 person.  EDIT: I will also say that, even though I spent more than $26 for a lot less food, it was still pretty much a shopping cart full of groceries. Even if I can't stick perfectly to the $26 to feed 4 idea, by using this plan I'm spending a lot more mindfully."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,ellequoi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely strengths and weaknesses in the markets. That said, my experience (and what I'm seeing by pulling up the weekly ads for my preferred stores in 3 of the metros I've lived in - TX, CA, and DC) is that price is overall way lower in the south. Meat is cheaper, most produce is the same or cheaper, basics are cheaper. In my experience, it wasn't nearly as diverse of produce as in CA, but I could eat good produce much, much cheaper. The money that bought me a full cart of quality groceries in TX got me the basics in LA and DC.   Anyway, it's just a bit of support for the 4 on $26 post, since I definitely would've managed those purchases in TX for roughly that amount. I think my average grocery bill was $25-30, buying whatever the hell I wanted. DC and CA? Nope."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,Zelcron,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think the $26 for 4 post is bad, or anything, or I wouldn't be testing it for one in a major city. But I do think the prices are a little unrealistic for most Americans."

But, that being said, this is an awesome post! I may sticky it for awareness."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk6yb,mslisa1990,3,Tue Jun 30 11:50:21 2015 UTC,"I shopped at the cheapest store in my area. While the dollar stores in my area often have good deals on food, they do not sell dairy or meat items. Which were the items that had the biggest divide between estimated price and real price.   The dollar store can be a good place to stock up on snacks and convenience items, though. For example if you're a working single person and don't have time to soak beans overnight, you can probably get pretty close to $1/lb by buying canned beans at the dollar store."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bngmw,Vladthewarrior,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:03:27 2015 UTC,I think a stir fry is always a safe choice. You could serve it on bean sprouts instead of rice. I also like pine nuts in my stir fry along with sesame.  Fruit and cottage cheese for breakfast is simple yet having your fruit cut for you ahead of time is nice.  Perhaps a salad with chicken or tuna on it.   Wraps are super simple and contain a lot less carbs than a piece of bread.   Fruit smoothies make for yummy snacks.   Some of my advice would be to take regular recipes and to see what you can replace the carbs with. I hope you have a lovely week. Good luck.

Basically making a normal salad and tossing on your pieces of burger....cheese optional.  Could do the same and make a taco salad.  Let the veggies be the main component.  Make stuffed pepper soup. But because your burger is all cooked.....make the soup and then throw in your chopped up patties at the end....so the soup heats 'em up.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Adolf_,11,Sun Jun 28 22:57:51 2015 UTC,This needs some spinach mixed in!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Adolf_,11,Mon Jun 29 02:40:28 2015 UTC,It totally does! I've done it with Spinach and it's the best way to add some more nutrients. Love putting spinach in every dish.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Adolf_,6,Mon Jun 29 02:53:41 2015 UTC,Fresh or canned?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,minastirith1,6,Mon Jun 29 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"The beauty of this dish is that either works. For fresh tomatoes, you will want to simmer a bit longer. In this I made it with both. Yesterday I made it with just canned."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,ext23,8,Mon Jun 29 03:38:40 2015 UTC,I meant spinach good to know though.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,chromiselda,7,Mon Jun 29 03:40:09 2015 UTC,"Ahh, yes. Fresh spinach for me."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,minastirith1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:55:01 2015 UTC,Nice
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,witchyz,3,Mon Jun 29 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"Is canned spinach a real thing? I have never seen that before and the way it gets brown after a little while, I can't imagine the canned version would be very nice..."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,jesster114,5,Mon Jun 29 06:50:47 2015 UTC,Actually this is what it looks like.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,jesster114,3,Mon Jun 29 06:56:36 2015 UTC,That looks terrible
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,richg0404,3,Mon Jun 29 07:23:49 2015 UTC,Popeye loves it I guess.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,flip_flap_flop,3,Mon Jun 29 10:50:21 2015 UTC,I actually really like grinding up dried chipotle's as a spicy seasoning to this dish. It adds a nice element to it
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,berserker13,2,Mon Jun 29 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"Oh good one, forgot about Chipotle. I've put in canned chipotle once, but never dried. I should get some, adds that dynamic flavor and spice."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,ChickenDelight,2,Mon Jun 29 05:53:38 2015 UTC,"So there are these chipotles that are sold in crinkly plastic that are a light brown, don't get those. They seem to be a mass produced low quality type. If you can, try heading to whole foods (I don't like their markup, but for chipotles they are the best). If you can find chipotles that are a really dark brownish red, they have the best flavor. What I do is put them in my toaster oven on broil for about 1-1.5 minutes, and they puff up a bit. Then I take them out, put them in a spice mill and grind the shit out of them. A great addition to most things, especially guacamole and salsa"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,ZircoFromCirco,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:57:01 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'll have to pick some up. Thanks for sharing. Some friends just brought me back some hotsauce from Mexico and the Chipotle one is amazing. Sweet and Spicy."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,sonsue,2,Mon Jun 29 17:43:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the idea. This looks great. I have subscribed to the youtube channel.  One suggestion. When you post your new recipes you should not only have an ingredient list but a description of how it is made. Yeah the video shows how to prepare it but it would be great to be able to print it off and save.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Fresh_AM,3,Mon Jun 29 18:49:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the sub! I'll make sure to include a description in the new ones and get them on the ones I've posted.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,bewwzerton,2,Mon Jun 29 14:11:43 2015 UTC,In the video you say you add tumeric but it's not listed here. Same for tomato paste it's here but not mentioned. Could you clarify please as I think I'll make this tonight but need to know if I need to pick up some things.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,bewwzerton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:02:44 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for noticing that. I've adjusted the ingredients in the video and on here. I was going to put the Tomato paste but didn't end up using it. It is optional but adds a nice thickness.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,bewwzerton,2,Mon Jun 29 18:27:32 2015 UTC,A teaspoon of of cayenne! Are you out of your mind?!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,neurosurg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"Haha, Feel free to adjust the recipe to your taste-buds."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,alwaystacobell,5,Mon Jun 29 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"Shakshuka...On a scale from 1 to 10 (unbearable), how spicy is it?"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,ClawTheBeast,28,Mon Jun 29 18:56:43 2015 UTC,Its a recipe. its as spicy as of much spice you add to it when you make it.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,dcenderelli,10,Sun Jun 28 23:33:06 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's actually pretty light for this recipe. I would say a 4. However, just avoid the Cayenne to make it less spicy."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,aceofblue,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:38:06 2015 UTC,"My sister makes an awesome shakshuka with caraway and a little jalapeno added in also.  She also uses 2-3x more oil and spices, and a healthy dose of salt.  Otherwise the recipe is quite similar."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,aceofblue,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:37:41 2015 UTC,I'll have to try with Caraway then.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,rissa_rizz,20,Mon Jun 29 13:25:18 2015 UTC,"Eggs, tomatoes and paprika...The more I think about it the more delicious it sounds."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Lightborne,10,Tue Jun 30 01:54:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Paprika and tomato can be great scrambled with eggs as well, but not quite as delicious as Shakshuka"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,silverarrows21,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:52:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm building it up in my mind the more I think about it. May do this for dinner tomorrow.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,TheRealTodoPoto,6,Tue Jun 30 01:55:22 2015 UTC,Thanks! Appreciate the sub. Hope you like it. Share a pic when you're done!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,ziggl,10,Mon Jun 29 00:14:48 2015 UTC,Looks mega tasty. Btw your videos are great to watch for peeps who already know how to cook; I love how you skip through all the self explanatory bologna. I'm making your butter chicken this weekend!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,damyunn,11,Mon Jun 29 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"Awesome, really appreciate the feedback. Trying to have a balance in teaching and displaying, as I do want to help less experienced cooks make great tasting meals. But ya, I feel like most people can go find another video on how to chop an onion, if that's what is holding them back rather than including it in the video and making them 20 minutes long. Trying to bring down the video length even more, with quicker cuts."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,aga080,8,Mon Jun 29 00:53:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I wish more people adopted your strategy. As someone who's trying to build a repertoire of dishes to have up her sleeve, ain't nobody got time to watch 10 onion chopping tutorials!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,aga080,5,Mon Jun 29 01:01:51 2015 UTC,Any dishes in your repertoire you think would be appropriate for this channel?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,lisa3535,3,Mon Jun 29 01:08:13 2015 UTC,"Sure! I love making Sriracha Lo-Mein!  Spicy Sauce, mix to taste Sriracha  Soy Sauce Brown Sugar Sesame Oil Grated Ginger  Prepare lo-mein noodles   I use prawns in mine, cook in sesame/canola oil with red pepper, then add zucchini, then add noodles, spicy sauce, garlic and 1-2 eggs and scramble with the noodles as I mix everything up! Finish with cilantro!  End result: yummers."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,TravellingPixie,6,Mon Jun 29 01:16:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds fantastic, and my mouth is watering thinking about it. I would probably go a bit easier on the Sriracha personally. Everyone seem to love it but it's a bit too tangy for me in large doses. Still sounds delicious and will try it out. May even make a video of it."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,ipedakitti,8,Mon Jun 29 02:35:58 2015 UTC,"Had this for dinner tonight! I prefer to cook my tomato sauce in a cast iron skillet, crack the eggs, and then let it bake for 10 minutes or so in a 400 degree oven. Baking the eggs gives a great texture and makes them perfectly runny if you time it right."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,branwen90,4,Mon Jun 29 03:07:48 2015 UTC,What a coincidence! Baking the dish is a pretty common way to make Shakshuka. Didn't know that you can get runny yolks from it though. I'll have to give it a shot.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,WinterMay,4,Mon Jun 29 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"my former boss (owner/chef at a restaurant) would poach eggs in tomato sauce in the oven. i think he just made a deeper well so that the yolk would be surrounded by the white. that way, it's insulated a bit from the heat. he made hundreds of these dishes, so he got it down to a science. figuring it out was all trial and error, i'm sure"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Ashilikia,4,Mon Jun 29 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for sharing. Ya if cooking in an oven I wouldn't push the whites around. The good thing about this dish is its hard to screw up. Even if you overcook your eggs slightly it still turns out great. I'm sure your former boss made a great one though."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Malcolm_Y,7,Mon Jun 29 03:46:43 2015 UTC,"That looks really good, I might make that tomorrow. On  smaller scale, thanks !"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,HipToBeQueer,5,Mon Jun 29 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"Even if you make it to scale, You have some delicious leftovers."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,zizzor23,5,Sun Jun 28 23:15:44 2015 UTC,How would you go about reheating it?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,zizzor23,6,Sun Jun 28 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"As /u/aceofblue recommended, you can put the leftovers in a pot/pan and heat it up with fresh eggs for better texture, or simply reheat the dish with eggs you already had in. Maybe add as many eggs as you're going to eat and have a little extra of everything else for the next time. Can even microwave when on the go but microwaved eggs aren't the best."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,zizzor23,8,Mon Jun 29 01:26:20 2015 UTC,"My fiance and I discovered shakshuka a couple of years ago, and man is it wonderful. We do it for dinner mostly rather than breakfast (because eggs are an anytime food!) and if we're in a hurry too hungry we'll cook it as you did. If we have some time we'll add a little bit of water at the simmer stage before putting the eggs in, and let it simmer and reduce for 20-30 minutes, adding extra water or tinned tomato as needed. Letting it simmer for a long time really amps up the flavor and makes it nice and thick.   We always make extra of everything but the eggs, since the leftovers reheat really well. I'll just poach a couple of eggs in the morning before work and add them to my lunch bowl."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,theladyofrohan,3,Mon Jun 29 01:33:14 2015 UTC,"Ahh, great tip. Ya if you have the time, the longer simmer really does add a lot. Going to have to try making leftovers without the eggs as you do. Reheating the eggs isn't as good as fresh ones."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Gummy-,3,Mon Jun 29 00:12:18 2015 UTC,"The eggs don't have that cooked-in-the-sauce flavor, but I've found that poaching gets the texture right, and the shakshuka is so flavorful anyways it doesn't even matter."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,iaminno,3,Mon Jun 29 00:16:24 2015 UTC,Ahh makes sense. And when you crack the yolk into it.. I'm salivating just thinking about it.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,wyamarus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:20:54 2015 UTC,"If you want this for breakfast, you can make a big batch and jar it. Then just reheat one jar and drop in the eggs. Takes about 10 min and can be done easily while getting other things ready."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,zyzzogeton,5,Mon Jun 29 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"Made some of this a few days ago. Super tasty, and super simple."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,benji1the1dog,5,Tue Jul 14 18:56:56 2015 UTC,Right?? More people need to know about this dish. Don't forget cheap and healthy.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Chizumaru,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"That's what I love about this dish, tomatoes, onions, eggs and spices are always on hand. I'll have to try in a Pita for on-the-go version. Probably want to reduce it quite a bit more then."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,z0rz,4,Mon Jun 29 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"Looks very spicy, and that's what I love about it. Time to head to the kitchen :)"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,quixoticacid,3,Mon Jun 29 02:14:59 2015 UTC,"What's awesome about this dish, is most people already have the ingredients for this in their fridge and pantry. Just add some more cayenne for extra spiciness."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,quixoticacid,2,Sun Jun 28 23:19:28 2015 UTC,I always add ginger to my spicy food. It brings out the hidden flavours :)
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,brunty,3,Sun Jun 28 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"Oh interesting. I hadn't thought of adding ginger to this, but I will have to try it out."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,BigT905,3,Mon Jun 29 00:09:24 2015 UTC,Fresh ginger or ginger powder?
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,BigT905,2,Mon Jun 29 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"I usually always go with Fresh Ginger unless making a rub or something, but in this case, I think either could work. Haven't tried it myself though."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,mr_richichi,2,Mon Jun 29 02:41:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude!  I just need to get some feta/cilantro for garnish, but this is one of the few times I already have all the ingredients handy."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,f3nris13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:55:25 2015 UTC,"The garnishes are not necessary, but do add to the dish. Don't let it stop you from making it."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Costner_Facts,2,Mon Jun 29 00:02:04 2015 UTC,"Holy crap! I have eaten this dish for my entire life. This is the only thing my father knows how to make. When my mom wasn't around, this was for dinner. I used to hate it and now I love it! I can't imagine not eating this as a breakfast (or dinner) at least a few times a month, I have a slightly different Turkish recipe but it's all the same concept!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Cuervoso,2,Mon Jun 29 00:03:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome, Your father must have perfected it then haha. What is the difference with your Turkish version?"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Cuervoso,3,Mon Jun 29 03:25:22 2015 UTC,"In turkish it is known as menemen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menemen_%28food%29  same concept, I like to throw whatever veggies I have into it, and have made it more into a big quiche in a pan. its also super good to add a crust. diced mushrooms are a great addition ive started recently"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,HuntStuffs,2,Mon Jun 29 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Oh interesting, rather than poached whole, the eggs are mixed into the other ingredients. Mushrooms would be amazing to this dish."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,stonecats,3,Mon Jun 29 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"How did you go about learning how to ""stir"" things by flipping things around in the pan? I've been trying to experiment but I'm a bit worried about sending things flying, and it seems so useful in this recipe."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,joca63,6,Mon Jun 29 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"Practice I guess. To do it: Push your pan forward, when the food comes to the edge of the pan, bring the pan slightly up and back. The motion of your hand is kind of like a C (from bottom, to the top). I would start with something like onions, worst that could happen is you have a bit of a mess. Start small and I bet you could have it down after your next cooking sesh."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,akebeth,3,Mon Jun 29 02:40:42 2015 UTC,"Minus the Feta, sounds a lot like Huevos Rancheros"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,akebeth,2,Mon Jun 29 03:34:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It can be quite similar depending on the recipe but I think Huevos Rancheros is made with refried beans, placed on tortillas and often with rice on the side, but there are so many variations."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Number_06,3,Mon Jun 29 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"Perfectly balanced video. Just for clarification, was that bread on the side at the end, or just like perfect 2-ply omelette?"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Number_06,2,Mon Jun 29 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"Thank-you! It was Sangak, a Persian bread that comes in big flat sheets, that most Persian marts should have. It's amazing fresh, and freezes really well. Great with Macedonian Feta cheese and some avocado."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Wolf2121,3,Mon Jun 29 02:55:40 2015 UTC,"For the eggs, do they have to be poached or could you scramble them and it still turn out about the same?   I know my mom does something about the same with all the same ingredients and throws in bell peppers and makes an omelet out of it ."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,Joy7593,3,Mon Jun 29 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"This dish in particular is much better poaching the eggs. Otherwise you get soggy eggs with this much liquid and try to scramble it. To make the dish scrambled, I'd cut out most of the tomato. In this video I cook scrambled eggs in vegetables similar to what we're talking about. https://youtu.be/nP0axhIFdSc"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,BlockWave,3,Mon Jun 29 05:41:46 2015 UTC,"True, I didn't think about the fact that there was a lot of liquid already in it.   What a man, that's the kind of thing I was imagining while I was watching this video. I'm trying to work a lot more veggies into my diet, so this helps a lot."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bg620,eboody,2,Mon Jun 29 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"Awesome to hear. These dishes and stirfrys are great for getting lot's of vegetables in your diet, and I'll continue to create more videos that helps with that."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bjmp6,michaelshow,9,Mon Jun 29 19:56:31 2015 UTC,I personally don't think it's a realistic goal if you're wanting to eat healthy. It could be done with a lot of really cheap packaged foods etc but those obviously contain lots of shit that you probably don't want to be putting in your body every day.   If you had access to a better equipped kitchen you could also probably do it and meet both the health and budget requirement.   My main question here is why? Do you have to go on this trip and why is your budget so low? Is there any way you can supplement it? Travelling will always eat up more money than you expect for things like food because you cannot always go back to the hotel at every meal and transporting food around with you is not always a practical option. I would re think this whole endeavour because it seems like you are planning to live on the edge of disaster the whole time. Sorry to come across negative but I don't see this working out too well.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bjmp6,rubybooby,2,Tue Jun 30 06:52:54 2015 UTC,"i feed 3 people a day on 5.22 it shouldnt be that crazy- for breakfast- 3 eggs, some green onions, a cup of minute rice mix them together with some water and salt and microwave them, throw the tortillas in the microwave and make taco things. (save the white end of the green onions put in water and put it on your window sill) another breakfast- cinnamon toast,bread is fairly cheap and you can probably make it till lunch if you drink water.  Lunch- ramen with some mixed frozen veggies in it, if you feel you need more bulk once the ramen is done add an egg and stir then reheat for 30 seconds. another idea, chop cucumber, add in a can of chicken chunks mix with mayo add salt and throw it into a taco or between bread you can add a diced tomato, i can usually get my hands on cucumbers for 2 for 1$ and tomatoes cost about 1$ for one and canned chicken isnt too expensive just go to a burger king or wendys and say you were just there and they forgot to give you a packet of mayonaise/ ketchup/ salt/ or whatever dinner- taco's? buy a can of refried beans heat them up add rice and a some corn and a diced tomato and put it in one of the tortillas. another idea, minute rice and furikake, basically take a can of tuna drain it, mix in a tbsp or 2 of soy sauce and sugar and microwave it till the sugar gets sticky and put it over rice, if you have mixed veggies you could add them to the rice. another idea- you should be able to afford a precooked chicken at least one a week , tear it up and add to ramen or eggs and you can stretch it to last a couple of meals. another dinner or lunch idea is hotdogs mixed with a can of chunk pineapple and pork and beans, it makes a really good soup ( even though its kinda weird)  I hope this helps"

One key factor will be in eating cheap, high-protein foods.  Those will help you to stay fuller longer. For snacks, look around and find peanuts on sale, as well as cheese.  For breakfasts, buy several boxes of cereal on sale ahead of time and take those with you -- vary with microwaveable oatmeal.  For lunches, try canned meats -- tuna, chicken, etc. -- whatever you can find on sale before you go and take with you.  For dinners, there are grilled cheese sandwiches, hot dogs, ramen noodle cups, microwaveable mac 'n cheese cups, and other microwaveable meals that don't need to be refrigerated.

Consultant here, so I travel 5 days a week every week: I eat fo' free all week using nothing but hotel provided food. Granted, I'm staying at ""full-service"" name brand hotels and I get lounge access so, I also get free appetizers (aka dinner) in the evening. However (note this is the part that's relevant to you), using the free breakfast options I am able to eat a large meal in the morning (oatmeal, an english muffin with peanut butter, coffee, and whatever fruit is in good condition that morning) I then snag some extras for lunch that day (I use the bread to make PB&J, steal some extra fruit and yogurt for snacks.) That should be enough to get you buy for 2 out of your 3 meals and make your budget much more doable. However, if you don't get free breakfast (which is a real possibility depending on the chain you selected) then I guess this is all moot and I apologize."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bjmp6,majesticunicron,3,Tue Jun 30 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"Your problem here is choosing a hotel room over food...I dont know what your situation is but my family often travels on an extremely low budget.  We camp, we drive my little car and have a pop-up tent in the trunk with a cast iron pan air mattress and our clothes/toiletries.    In the back seat we have my son and a cooler with our perishable food in it.  A basket with some dry goods.  Often campsites are free or at least very cheap, sometimes they even have showers and if not there is always a truckstop somewhere to shower at.  Along the trip we stop at grocery stores to restock our cooler.  We traveled from Iowa to Washington state and stayed 2 weeks and aside from gas money the whole trip cost us practically nothing.      I dont have much advice for you know but in the future I would consider camping instead of a hotel.  Your best bet currently is probably a food bank, soup kitchen, farmers market.  Find an Albertson's, I dont know if they still do it but back when I lived in New Mexico, expired food was free.  That in mind, if you found a small mom & pop privately owned grocery store id bet a fair chunk of cash they'd be willing to work something out with you on some overstock they might have of something.  My local grocery store saves meat scraps for my pets."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bjmp6,matriarch87,3,Tue Jun 30 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a master of kitchen-less cooking. If you can borrow a slow cooker and/or rice cooker, I would bring them with. A rice cooker can also serve to cook dried beans (same as a crockpot) and pasta/noodles, steam veggies, and act as a hot plate if you keep the on switch depressed. Of course, fire codes may vary, but that was the extent of what my dorm allowed. You can throw in seasoning, veggies, and beans with rice for a one pot meal.  I like to stick split peas in the rice cooker with a bit of oil and salt for a few hours. Makes a delicious soup, which I often add hot sauce to.  ""Healthy"" on that budget will have to mean something different to you than it normally would. Think varied, balanced, and calorically dense. If you can afford ground beef, buy the fattiest stuff and save any drippings to use as your oil instead of margarine.  Oats are a good bargain and quite filling.   Don't be afraid to have more up front costs for buying in bulk. Calculate the cost per meal for each item before buying. Inspect things like a bag of potatoes very carefully before buying - get a rotten batch, and your whole plan is thrown off.  Look up recipe blogs based on budgets of $1/day or food stamps.  Make spice mixes from spices you already have (e.g. taco seasoning, Cajun, ranch, onion soup mix) to pack if you aren't driving. No cost on the trip, but it will help so much with monotony. In fact, bring what dried goods and condiments you can. Think of salt, pepper, and sugar, anything you won't want to buy a full package of while there (especially at the prices of the smallest containers). Actually, make sure to cost compare against dried good sections/bulk stores, ie the places where you scoop whatever amount you want into a bag.  See what festivals or local events are on during your trip that could have free food. Go to Costco (say you're going to the pharmacy) or the farmers market for free samples. See if there's a local CSA/vegetable garden that might trade work for produce. If things get really dire, dumpster dive at supermarkets and restaurants, or wedding venues on the weekends? Show up at the end of the business day in your hotel conference area to scavenge the leftovers.  Ask the hotel for a free upgrade to a kitchenette when you arrive. If  you can (it not, it could help for next time), get a room at a hostel instead. Not only do they have full kitchens, but if you pick the place right, there will be a decent full breakfast as well. Some hostels will actually trade free lodging for work.  Another idea for cheaper lodging would be dorms, especially at colleges or small private universities. Hotel cancellations in advance would be easy compared to starving yourself."

You can save by getting a bigger bag of potatoes or buying eggs and milk that are close to their expiration date.  Cook them up ASAP, boil the milk in the microwave and it will last while longer.  For the eggs the best thing is to cook the potatoes whole in the microwave until soft, then mash the potato and crack an egg on it, then cook a little longer until the egg is the consistency you want.

If the handle is thinner than your finger, it's probably too flimsy to be much good.  I enjoy the flexibility of having an immersion blender. You can purée a soup or sauce right in the pot while/after cooking, or use it for an emulsion (homemade mayonnaise is the best example). Mine was about $50 as a birthday gift, but I think they go as low as $20 sometimes. Just don't use it to mash potatoes!  Aluminum foil. It creates covers where there were none before!  Rolling pin.  Spice collection - read a few make-your-own-spice-mix recipes, go to your nearest ethnic or bulk dry goods store, and grab all the ones you remember seeing.   I am very happy to have a proper knife set (serrated, paring, French, Santoku, cleaver) with sheathes, which I got from Paderno for $50 through a Groupon. Knife sharpener is also handy.  Ramekins, cast-iron skillets, and oven-safe bowls can add to your culinary repertoire. You can make dishes requiring stove/countertop to oven/broiler steps, like frittatas, individual pot pies, and crèmes brulées.  Salad spinners are super expensive except for the one from IKEA, which I have.  Keep a jar with a tight lid around for shaking up drinks, powder shakes, or salad dressings.  If you are planning on cooking for lots of people, like for holidays, there are other considerations to keep in mind: - serving utensils, eg ladle, carving knife/fork, tongs, large slotted spoon, cake thing, roller, BOTTLE OPENERS. My uncle got me a serving set for Christmas when I landed my first real job, and it's been a great gift. - roasting pan, rack, GIANT stock pot for potatoes (I have one with steamer inset, bought that one for CNY though LOL), baster, brush, whisks, non-stick whisks, meat thermometer, masher -baking trays and pretty casserole dishes -serving dishes or, for when that ultimately fails, trivets to set the pots on -pitchers, punch bowl, cooler, ice cube trays  I found I spent about $100 on each meal-based party I threw, slowly stocking up my kitchen over the years.

Heat milk in large sauce pan on low heat. Careful not to burn, and stirring occasionally.   At 200 degrees F, remove from heat completely. Add 1/3 cup white vinegar or lemon juice, and a healthy pinch of salt. (Salt may be omitted if desired). Let sit UNDISTURBED for 10 minutes. Set double layer of cheesecloth into a strainer over the sink or a bowl. (You can save the whey - the stuff you're straining out - for later use if desired). Slowly pour the seperated milk into the cheesecloth. Put it in the fridge. The longer it strains, the drier the cheese will be. Depending on what you need it for, maybe super dry isn't what you need. Check it every 10 minutes or so and see where it's at!  Enjoy! Some additional uses: If you press the liquid and then form the cheese inside the cheesecloth into a brick, you can put a weight on top, like a plate with a heavy can.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3biqz6,VonDenBerg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"looks like you could, although i have never slow cooked a steak before it should be fine. Other than that you could always throw the potatoes in a pan, sprinkle with oil and salt and pepper and bake them for about 15-20 minutes and then add the carrots and then fry those steaks up."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3biqz6,Selfcestuous,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:29:31 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much just Chuck roast cut into steak size. Same sort of connective tissue and fat. Your best bet is slow roast/braise, grind it for burgers/etc, or chop it for tacos. You can also thinly slice it and tenderize too for pan frying (breading optional)"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk27r,catsalots,2,Mon Jun 29 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"You adding your limitations messed me up but there are alternatives to almost all of those...Sounds like an egg bake will be the way to go for you.  Almond/Rice/Cashew/Soy are all non-dairy non-coconut milks.  Lemme make up a recipe quick.  Ingredients:  12 eggs  1-2 cups of cashew milk   (if my lil grocery store has it im sure yours does : P)  1 cup of wheat germ (or any other grain of your choosing)  Because you don't like cheese or meat and they are common in egg bakes I think a suitable alternative to both for you would be tofu.  You'll need a pound of firm tofu. Seasonings/Veggies of your choice, id recommend S&P, onion, diced gr peppers, cilantro.  Heat oven to 350  Oil 9x13 glass baking dish  Prepare tofu, crumble it.  Beat eggs and cashew milk and add remaining ingredients, pour into baking dish and bake for about an hour until its puffy, and browned.  When its cooled cut it up into long individual portions and freeze in zippy bags.  This warms up easily in the microwave and ive not made it like this but wheat germ and eggs are both heavy duty binders, im quite certain this will be very dense and can be eaten like a burrito.  I think it should taste pretty good too."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bk27r,matriarch87,2,Tue Jun 30 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I totally forgot about tofu. I used to eat it every once and a while, but just stopped for no particular reason.   It's not like me not liking cheese--it's cheese not liking me! ;)  I do already drink almond milk (it's still cheaper than cashew milk here somehow). I was just referring to some recipes that use coconut cream or other cream that I have a hard time replacing without losing lots of calories.  Thanks again!"

Making and slicing a giant vegan quiche sounds like your best bet :) that way you can pick and choose your toppings (method and proportion are more meaningful than recipes for quiches, substitute whatever toppings you like).  Asian cuisines have the best savoury breakfasts, since they don't discriminate as to time of day. You could try samosas, rice dumplings (the banana/screwpine leaves used to steam them in is the perfect throwaway wrapper), or sushi hand rolls."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfluz,melimsah,3,Sun Jun 28 22:21:16 2015 UTC,This one is the simplest solution.  I do this or just a bit of butter and a little Italian seasoning
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfluz,daltonian5,4,Sun Jun 28 21:19:48 2015 UTC,"idk if it's necessarily healthier, but if you have an asian store near you, and you're not crazy about chicken or beef broth for whatever reason, there are some different stock options. E.g., I like miso paste, but there's also stuff like fish sauce (I'm not big on fish though). IMO if you're going to cut back on salt, the easiest way to not notice is to kick up the heat.  I like to do half 'better than bullion' and half miso paste, with a healthy kick of sriracha. I freeze green onions (single guy, I can never each fresh stuff before they go bad) by chopping them and patting them dry--so whenever I make soup, I throw a handful in there. Corn and tofu always add a nice satiating quality to soup, so I always put them in noodle soups. Not a huge fan of the mushy texture of peas, so I usually leave them out. When the water is hot but not actively boiling, I'll beat an egg and slowly ease it in (like egg drop soup). Sometimes just for color rather than flavor (I don't taste a difference), I'll add some frozen chopped spinach.  But honestly, if I have the time to let regular noodles cook, I don't use instant. Since I live within driving distance to a big asian supermarket, it's basically cost-equivalent to get some decent-quality soba (buckwheat) noodles or rice noodles. Instant noodles are instant because they're basically deep-fried, so while the sodium in the broth isn't healthy, neither are the noodles. I empathize with the need to eat something cheap and instant, but if you have another five or so minute to kill, just prepare some regular soup noodles."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfluz,icaruscomplex,2,Sun Jun 28 20:18:21 2015 UTC,I generally prefer it to have just that little bit of kick. That molasses-y flavor adds a nice contrast to the spicy ramen imo. Those are just my little touches though. :)

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfluz,mountainslayer,10,Sun Jun 28 22:47:21 2015 UTC,At elementary school we used to eat them like that all the time. You could smack the bag up then shake in the flavour packet and eat them like chips.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfluz,sarasmirks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"You can use basically any stock or broth. The flavor packets are really just a powdered version of a bullion cube, to mix in more easily in contact with boiling water. This means you could either go simple and replace with an actual bullion cube or ""better than bullion"" or whatever you like, or you could go real fancy and make homemade stock. Or make up whatever type of sauce you like. I've seen instant ramen versions of mac & cheese. Instant noodles + tomato soup might be good. Thin out some gravy, add vegetables and shredded chicken, and you have a pretty damn good chicken noodle soup.  I prefer to get real elaborate with the more expensive Asian brands of ramen, like Shin, Nissin, Sapporo Ichiban, etc. because the fancier you make your ramen, the more obvious it's going to be that the noodles that come in Maruchan or Top packs are really inferior. For the el cheapo noodles I'll either make as directed, sub for better than bullion, and/or add a couple slices of Velveeta cheese (don't knock it till you've tried it). Too much more elaborate than that and the noodles themselves can't really stand up to the challenge, IMO."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,SableMinotaur,27,Sun Jun 28 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"Well you can use the crock pot in your room, so at least you don't have to sit in the kitchen. Don't forget that you could prepare a ziploc of things to go in the crock pot at any time of the day and stick it in the fridge, then cook it overnight in your room, then refrigerate it in the morning. It won't be hot when you get home but at least it'll get cooked.  There's something you might look into called 'once a month cooking' (OAMC) where you spend some time making a large amount of something, then freeze most of it in individual portions. You make one thing one week, another thing the next week, another thing the third, and before you know it you have a bunch of different homemade food sitting in your freezer for you to just pull out and heat up.   As for the poor cooking skills: work your way up. You say you buy muffins. How much do you spend on muffins? Would it be cheaper to buy muffin mixes and bake them yourself? (Muffin mixes are pretty foolproof, plus you'd only have to babysit the oven like 20 minutes.) Try stuff like frozen skillet meals and hamburger helper.  Only buy stuff in bulk that you can freeze, and freeze all but what you will use before it goes bad (in smaller portions!)

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,fontophilic,5,Wed Jul 1 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"Well granted this is challenging. but I´ll have a go at it. There is nothing you can do at dinner(real warm homemade dinner), you are simply not home at that time.     In the evening before you go to bed, you take 15 grams of yeast, mix it in  bowl with water and flower til having a dough that is a little wet, but can stand on its own, wets, sticky model clay(takes about 5 min), place it in the fridge. in the morning say you get up at 6-630 pour the dough on a baking tray(on baking paper)i a bread like shape. baking tray in oven 200 degree celsius for 20 min. the time is now 620, and you have fresh baked bread, for breakfast(or eat your breakfast while the bread bakes), you can have it with cheese or what ever, the rest you do not eat, you can make a sandwich, half the bread add lettuce salami,onion , roll in baking paper and you have your lunch, the bread recipe is a base recipe, you can add sunflower seeds, change the flour to half rye flour. the lunch can be changed daily to fit your wants, ham and cheese, bacon and eggs.    Now I do not know if you have a day off at some point, but this is the time you cook, make pasta, and freeze a portion(or 50), make a dish with rice, freeze it. This way you end up having a lot of food that just needs to be mikrowaved and you can eat. also if at all possible shop once a week, you proberly don't realize that shopping takes a lot of time. if you spend 60 min once a week(that is alot), instead of shopping 20 min every day then you save 80 min a week, you also save some money... Find out where you have some time you ""waste"" write down everything you do, and think is there somewhere I can do this smarter and save time.    Do you even eat dinner? you say you don´t eat after 1600, that makes thing easier.  Does your roommate cook?, you could eat together(careful this may cause actual conversation). you could pratice your skills at cooking(tasteless recipes, add garlic, salt, and lime, that will bring out some flavors.    Hope this gets you thinking atleast."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,itsamutiny,2,Sun Jun 28 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"I know you said you don't like Costco but unless you go to the supermarket every day and buy things that are on sale/marked down due to expiration date price is going to be an issue.  Eating out is way more expensive than making your own meals no matter where you go.  If I were you I would find a whole bunch of recipes you like online and then buy a variety of ingredients at Costco.  You can buy a combination of ground turkey, ground beef, chicken breast/thighs, and pork at Costco for cheap and then buy a variety of veggies.  20 lbs of potatoes is 10 dollars, 3 lbs of spinach is 6 dollars, a bag of avocados is a few bucks, peppers, lettuce, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.  They also have big containers of spices for a few bucks, eggs are pretty cheap (though the price has gone up a lot since chickens were infected with bird flu), milk is cheaper than any supermarket, american cheese is about 2.50 a pound if you get the kirkland packaged cheese.  A large jar of pesto is 8 bucks.  There are a lot of possibilities, you're just going to have to learn to cook.  It's not hard as long as you follow recipes and you can surprisingly make a large variety of meals with the ingredients I mentioned.  This is what I do and for my girlfriend and I, I pay between $150-$180 every two weeks for the both of us (breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and snacks) depending on what I make.  We also get a bunch of different kinds of meals out of these ingredients.  I know you said you don't want to shop at Costco but it's hard to beat $45.00 a week for one person and three meals a day.  Thought I'd share this suggestion because food prices are ridiculous and this is the best way I've found around it.  Good luck!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,sareptile,3,Sun Jun 28 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem with Costco for me isn't the price, it's that I'm not going to be able to prepare and eat 3lbs of spinach before it goes bad. Considering I work a full 40 hours a week and workout/do ballet for 10 hours a week and usually work another 5-15 hours on the weekend, I don't have a whole lot of prep time. All of my side jobs are an hour across the city where I used to live with my mom as well, so it's not just a quick drop off at work. I tried sharing with my roommate but she eats out more than I do. I think I'll buy a couple of things from the grocery store biweekly like you said for soups and such that I can make in my room, but there's no way I can go through the Costco level of ingredients before they expire."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,fontophilic,2,Sun Jun 28 22:43:05 2015 UTC,"When I get overly ambitious on my spinach/greens or fruit purchase, I make freezer packs for green smoothies. Doesn't matter if the texture suffers when it's going to become liquid."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,natziel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:13:56 2015 UTC,"Take one late evening a week and roast 6 or 8 boneless skinless chicken breasts seasoned with just salt and pepper.  Simultaneously hard boil some eggs, cube up some cheese, portion out some mixed nuts and dried fruit, etc. You can store all of these in individual snack-size ziplocks. Maybe also some fresh fruit like melon, berries, apples can go into tupperware or sandwich-size ziplocks.  Once the chicken is cooked, let it cool and slice it. Store this in 4 or 6 oz portions into tupperware or ziplocks.  Additional items to purchase from costco would be salad greens, shredded carrots (awesome/easy in salads), shredded cheese, sandwich bread or wraps, yogurt, bananas, and all your other favorite snacks.  This way, you can quickly make up a chicken salad or chicken wrap for lunches. You can grab some high-protein snacks like boiled egg, cheese, mixed nuts, or fresh fruit. And you could alternate proteins weekly between chicken, turkey, steak, pork loin, beans, etc. to mix it up."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,freeschooler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"BTW, I think your 220g protein requirement needs to be in your main post. That is pretty outside the norm for most people on ECAH.   I think you could get down to $350-$400/mo, just by no longer eating out, and getting used to a bit less variety. But by price, protein is the most expensive macro.   I would go ahead and get a great insulated cooler and ice pack. Pack into it greek yogurt, hard boiled eggs, low fat cheese, edamame, nuts, turkey/beef jerky, fruit. Make chicken breast or tuna salad and whole wheat or nut based crackers. Take this with you everywhere you go and basically eat constantly. A good cooler can keep things cool for 6 hours. Eat the chicken first, everything else can be fine at room temp.   Breakfast needs to be like 4 eggs (or 2 whole eggs, 2 egg whites), and a few slices of turkey meat or leftover chicken. Not eating after 4pm cuts out a lot of opportunities to get more cals and proteins in there. Consider adding a protein shake after your evening work out, at a minimum. You could prep a scoop of powder in a mixing jar, and add a box of shelf-stable, single serving milk to your cooler bag.   BTW, costco rotissary chickens are some of the best value. Let it cool, rip off the meat, make it into your salads. At your rate, you could eat 2 a week."

I already own a dehydrator and make kale chips as a snack, but I just recently noticed how expensive jerky is.   I'm definitely going to get a cooler for my yogurt. I eat maybe a handful of something every hour (a cup of yogurt at 8 a banana at 9, a protein bar at 10) but I feel a lot less hungry towards 4/5 o'clock. I could make a shake or a smoothie once I'm done with my workout, I suppose."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,freeschooler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:49:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no. Unless you're getting the meat for free (deer hunter?), or using ground meat (and you'd need a jerky gun) I don't think it's worth it.   I'd recommend the Costco size bags of Krave jerky. Best price I've found.   Jerky is not the cheapest way to get your protein, but it is shelf stable. Keeping it in rotation with other high protein snacks is a way to reduce that cost."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,blahblahwordvomit,0,Tue Jun 30 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"Stop buying processed food, stop snacking so much, be deliberate with your purchases. Know how much protein you need to eat and how many calories you need and plan your diet around that."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bfidp,dewprisms,5,Sun Jun 28 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"Add eggs (you can scramble them quickly in the morning, or boil a dozen and keep them in the fridge) and peanuts (in your car), that will at least help you cut down on the protein bars."

I have braces and sometimes even two weeks after they've been tightened I can't grind my teeth on hard foods (I have to avoid some protein bars for this reason). Is peanut butter just as good, or does it depend on the peanut butter because I know some have added sugars and such that kind of ruin the whole protein aspect of it."

Alternatively you can throw the broccoli or other veggie mix into a pan and fry them with some lemon pepper, garlic or almost any spice. I love saucy broccoli so sometimes i even cheat and pop a bowl full in the microwave with some water and let it cook through, then transfer it to a pan with some sriracha brown sugar and soy sauce."

You can buy pre- sliced mushroom and onion as well as crushed garlic and spices/herbs to dodge any prep, and the method is basically just to chuck ingredients in a pot and leave them, so it could be a really good option for avoiding that nasty prep.

A good way to incorporate veggies is making a bolognese sauce. I like Jamie Oliver's recipe. You can tweak the vegetable amounts to incorporate more, or throw some other things in like peppers or toss in some broccoli before serving. Make a huge batch and you can freeze the rest for later!  I also love puttanesca sauce. Chop up (or press!) loads of garlic, like 3-6 cloves depending on their size and strength. Put them in a saucepan with 1/2 tbsp of olive oil on low/med heat along with 1 anchovy fillet. Kind of break up the anchovy fillet a bit, and try not to brown the garlic too much (but don't worry if you do, this always comes out good). Add capers, olives and 1/2 tsp of chilli powder. About 3 tsp of capers and 3 tbsp of olives, or pretty much as many as you want of either. Let that sit for about a minute and add a can of chopped tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes or so while you boil your pasta. That's all! Again, you can add peppers or something if you like, add them at the beginning since they can take a while to cook."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bdar0,Carrot_Fondler,2,Sun Jun 28 07:59:21 2015 UTC,I imagine it would be more like a sorbet. Is that the case or is it too icy?

I say make good ice cream, and just use willpower and portion control. I find if I can have a spoonful or two of ice cream after dinner, that's all I need.  Invest in a freezer-bowl ice cream maker (about $40) and make your own ice cream, where you control the ingredients. Unfortunately, you'll never get away from using sugar in ice cream, but at least you can be sure that it's just milk, cream, sugar and eggs, and natural flavourings like fresh fruit puree, not all the additives and so on that's in store bought.   Edit: Also, making your own proper ice cream is cheaper than store-bought, of course. Ten batches and you've broken even."

I'm not sure how that'd play with the almond milk though (I love almond milk, but never tried it for ice cream) as it has more water content than milk. And eggs can help improve the flavour.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bdar0,dewprisms,2,Sun Jun 28 13:09:15 2015 UTC,"That's interesting - I've seen some recipes that call for half & half, but you do need some kind of fat for ice cream, purely to stop ice crystals growing too large. Sugar helps with that, but a combination of fats, sugar, and 'other' stuff keep the crystals small and the ice cream smooth and creamy.  However... I know that regular milk is great for things like french/italian gelato, so maybe half & half could work there as well.  We can't get pre-mixed half & half in australia, but I'll work it out and try it sometime. :)"

Neither of them is really unhealthy but that's a bit of a 6 of one, half a dozen of another situation.  Basically no matter which way you slice it, good ice cream is unhealthy. Either due to the large amount of high fat dairy and/or custard bases, sugar, etc. Like you said in your first post, the key is portion control."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bdar0,HyperTraveler,2,Sun Jun 28 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"Well, cream is 35% dairy fats so roughly 85ml of 1 cup of cream - so about 80g of fat? whereas one egg yolk has about 5g of fat x 6 = you're still lower fat, plus yolk carries iron, etc. I""m not saying eggs are puritanical, but they're a better option if the end goal is a healthier version of ice cream, so reduce the bad stuff where you can I suppose. Plus, personally, every batch I've done with egg, it always tastes better, has a better texture, etc.  But yeah, as the great Alton Brown once said, ice cream shouldn't be low-fat or diet or low-carb or whatever - it should just taste good. :)"

Going to a frozen yogurt joint like Red Mango is the way to go for froyo, not buying a carton. Mixing flavors and add-ins and getting something fresh is the way to go, legit, it's my favorite ice-cream-style experience. My personal go-to is peanut butter froyo with banana, granola, and dark chocolate bits. So good! And you can't get the taste and texture of something like fresh fruit or crispy granola in something you're pulling out of your freezer. Plus, once you eat it you're done, meaning no leftovers to tempt you. An average ice cream container has 12 servings! 12!

I can't afford to get ice cream from there regularly, but I sure do appreciate the ice cream more when I only go occasionally. :)"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bbjbw,raki27,9,Sun Jun 28 02:00:19 2015 UTC,Yes.  It's not very uncommon for people that are starting out weight training (or just bulking) to drink a gallon of milk per day and pack on MASSIVE amounts of muscle (and some fat).  The milk is loaded with calories and protein so you can bulk by drinking a bunch of it pretty easily.  If you don't lift and drink a gallon of milk a day you'll just get fat though.  When I'm bulking or doing a lot of running I drink a bunch of (chocolate) milk.  Helps with the recovery and gainz.  When it's bikini season and I cut it out.
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bbjbw,Black_Kitty,12,Sun Jun 28 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"As somebody who's done GOMAD more than once and is into lifting, I think you're understating the fat gain here. The maximum amount of muscle one can gain per week from lifting is approximately one pound. And that's if you're having a stellar week. Any other weight added is just fat and water weight.  The more you know ~"
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bbjbw,paper_alien,5,Sun Jun 28 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"I think I'd get sick after a gallon of chocolate milk. I've never really understood the GOMAD bulk though. I mean you could easily just throw in some whey protein and get a lot more protein without nearly as much fat and calories. I could see how GOMAD is good for someone who is struggling to eat enough calories a day to meet a bulk req, but I'd hate to see what it does to your digestive system."

Heat it in a big pot until it's not quite boiling (if it boils, don't let it boil for too long). Then cool it down until you can stand to put your finger in it for a few seconds. Dip out a few cups of it, and mix a couple of tablespoons of yogurt into that container, then stir it thoroughly and stir it back into the main pot.  Portion that liquid out into your jars, leaving only a small amount of space in each, then screw the lids on tightly. Place them in a cooler, and then fill that cooler up with hot water from the tap and put the lid on it. Leave for 8-16 hours (longer is tarter), then take the jars out and put them in your fridge."

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bdeq2,Auriga1992,8,Sun Jun 28 04:07:21 2015 UTC,"Salmon is great all by itself - rub it with olive oil and pour a little in the pan (maybe sprinkle some salt on it). When the pan is hot (medium-high heat), lay down the salmon and DO NOT TOUCH untill the meat is cooked 2/3 of the way (5-7 minutes, usually). Flip it over and DO NOT TOUCH until meat is completely cooked through. Profit.  I also like cod, which I usually poach in a soup. Any stock will do but I recommend herbs or veggie stock. Throw some green onions and parsley in there (to taste) and any other veggies you're a fan of. Keep the heat medium low (if the heat is to high your fish will be rubbery). When the cod starts to get flakey, it's done. I like to break it up with a fork before eating, but you could also remove it from the soup and eat the two separately (you heathen)."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bdeq2,FakePersonality,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:21:40 2015 UTC,I also love salmon pan grilled. My family has it about twice a month with a little blackening seasoning. Just make sure you don't overcook it!
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bdeq2,HereComesBadNews,6,Mon Jun 29 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of ""fishy"" fish, so I stick with mild white fish like flounder, sole, and sometimes cod, though I stick to flounder for the most part.  Flounder is relatively cheap, you can get a 2lb bag of frozen fillets from WalMart for $5.98.  My favorite ways to cook flounder are from frozen (it's easier and still tastes good), though you can thaw the fillet if you want to bread it and fry (or bake) it.   The easiest way to cook flounder is to put a few frozen fillets in a cake pan (or casserole dish) with a few pats of butter on top of the fillets, and season the fish with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Bake at 400 degrees for 12 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily.  Another yummy way to cook flounder is to cook it in tomato sauce. Pour a jar of tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce) in the bottom of a cake pan (or casserole dish) add a few flounder fillets, lemon slices, salt, and pepper. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes or until the fish flake easily."

When my fish is baking or cooking, I put a saucepan over medium high-heat and add rosemary stems and orange peels (which I save after using from fresh and keep in a freezer bag). Once it boils, I turn it down to low and keep it on the stove until I'm done both eating and done with the dishes. Sometimes I need to add more water to this mixture. Then I pour the scented water down the drain and immediately take out the trash. This is pretty cheap and easy and has prevented my house from smelling overly fishy."

I usually have broccoli and cauliflower with this - thaw frozen veggies in warm water, drain and place on baking sheet, into oven for 5 minutes while it preheats to dry them off a bit, remove and toss in olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bc5hk,rainbow33,28,Sat Jun 27 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"Here are some ideas to ponder. Obviously I don't know your individual situation, so take it with a grain of salt.   Go to secondhand/thrift stores and look for things like crock pots/slow cookers, toaster ovens, toasters, hot plates, etc. You might even find a microwave. Used appliances like that are generally quite cheap and will expand your options tremendously. A small cooler will also help with your food options. Barring that, try adding fresh raw produce to your diet. Even if the rest of your diet has to be sub-optimal, adding apples, bananas, carrots, cucumbers, grapes, etc. will bring your average nutrition up. Bananas are some of the cheapest produce, per pound, that you can buy - and they require no preparation or refrigeration. Nuts are also healthy and require no cooking/cooling, but they may be a bit expensive. You can grow some produce on your windowsill with nothing more than the end of a previous purchase and a cup of dirt or water. For example, green onions, lettuce, celery, etc. As it's growing, it requires no refrigeration to stay fresh, and it can add some good, cheap nutrition to your diet. Bread, peanut butter, and honey. Reasonably healthy, cheap, no refrigeration or cooking required.    Hope this helps!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,3bc5hk,iguanidae,16,Sun Jun 28 09:52:50 2015 UTC,"Is there any way you can get a mini fridge for your room? I would highly recommend that. Also, a hot plate and a toaster oven would be beneficial (both can easily be plugged into an outlet).   If you can get those things, then from there the produce and bulk food sections of the grocery store should be your main targets. Cheap fruits such as apples and bananas are great snacks. Dry lentils and beans are generally $1/lb and under. If you eat meat, stick with dark meat on chicken (wings, legs) since those tend to be the cheapest parts of the animal."
EatCheapAndHealthy,3bc5hk,HaggarShoes,6,Sat Jun 27 21:06:30 2015 UTC,"You can safely store veggies via fermentation. Check out /r/fermentation This is the process by which you make sauerkraut, kimchi, sour pickles, etc. (same chemical process for making yogurt and other products, even though yogurt requires temperature control), but you can store most hearty veggies without too much loss of texture.  They'll start to get sour over time, but will keep for months on end with proper care.  You just need glass or food safe ceramic dishes/jars/buckets + salt and distilled water. If using vessels without some kind of lid you can use a tea towel or cheesecloth to keep bugs out."

That's just always going to be true, and it means that all else equal you can typically save money by preparing it yourself.  You can try using a convection oven. To me it doesn't feel like the whole production that using the ""real"" oven is.  You can try a rice cooker. This is especially helpful if it comes with a steamer basket. You put whatever you want to cook in there, turn it on, and wait.  You can microwave scrambled eggs or a potato.  You can try a slow-cooker. It's like a rice cooker in the sense that you put the stuff in there and turn it on and wait.  You can try making food ahead of time. Check out /r/MealPrepSunday for a ton of ideas. It is still cooking, but you can knock most or all of it out in one day.

Pat the chicken thighs dry, and season each thigh on both sides with cumin, salt and pepper.   Pre-heat a heavy-bottomed skillet or dutch oven on medium-high for a minute or so and then add the oil. Add the thighs, skin-side down and cook until deeply browned (5-7 minutes). Don’t crowd the pan, work in batches if necessary. Turn and brown other side (3-5 minutes). Remove thighs to a plate and set them aside.  Lower the heat and if there’s a lot of oil, remove most of it, leaving about a tablespoon and a half. Add flour, garlic and sliced white scallion bottoms. Stir well to coat the flour in oil and cook for 2-3 minutes. Whisk in the wine and let it simmer for 3 minutes while scraping up any brown bits with a wooden spoon. Add the broth, honey, lime juice, lime zest and half the cilantro and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken, skin-side up and place it, uncovered, into the oven. Cook for 35-40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (165º F / 74º C on an instant read thermometer).

EatCheapAndHealthy,3b6ygz,ZionCypher,20,Fri Jun 26 18:01:33 2015 UTC,I've actually come to dislike breasts and use thighs almost exclusively.

Brands vary like crazy so it would be hard for me to recommend a specific one but I can tell you some types that would work. One is Sauvignon Blanc. Another would be Pinot Grigio. It should be pretty inexpensive (under $7 or so)  Also, you could definitely skip the wine altogether and just add a little bit more stock.
