There are juices from companies I haven't tried but have seen on Instagram that I would really appreciated a review for (Toque Juice Co. from Alberta, Alchemy Air, West Coast Clouds, to name a few)  I guess what would be important to me, or what I would look for in a juice review are the following:  -VG/PG ratio -how long the reviewer has had the juice for. Sometimes a flavour take time to develop and steeping helps things get rounded out, so mentioning whether or not the juice is steeped would help IMO.  -price -where to purchase -if you drip the juices, I guess you could also mention peak flavour at a certain wattage/voltage.  Just a few of my thoughts, but I think this is cool and if you have the passion to do it then go for. I hope all goes well and when the channel goes up, post a link here on reddit and provide us some info!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3e3zk7,jettscythe,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"Have you checked out /r/DIY_eJuice?   They seem to have a ton of threads on good starter flavours and what not, and the general consensus is that if you're going to put the money in to do it right, start with mixing by weight instead of volume right off the bat and get a decent scale.   I haven't taken the leap yet but I've been doing a ton of research and it looks like the best bet is to find some recipes you think you'll like and order those flavours to start.   If you're wanting small batches of flavours, DIY Ejuice is a reputable Canadian vendor, and they have everything except Nic.   Search this sub for nicotine reviews and someone (on mobile -  can anyone help with kudos here?) has done some really in depth reviews on many Canadian nicotine vendors.   UPDATE: /u/BooksofMagic did the reviews, Part 1 and Part 2.  Based on those and some other reviews it seems like Hydavape is the best value and quality balance.   If you're wanting larger batches of flavours, ordering bulk from the US may work out cheaper even with shipping and the dollar exchange, just requires some math to figure out.

Damn I would like to try diy. I have a very accurate scale (for measuring gunpowder in grains) and assume that would help."
Canadian_ecigarette,3e3zk7,ADrunkCanadian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:29:13 2015 UTC,that would be the base to make liquid excluding the pg and vg.
Canadian_ecigarette,3e3zk7,GreatBigPig,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:34:22 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think I missed the 100mg and 48mg part of that area.

Canadian_ecigarette,3e3zk7,GreatBigPig,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. So if I understand it, excluding all the cautious techique(and a brain) and supplies/tools, a DIYer only needs base, vg/pg, and flavours? If so, that is great to know."
Canadian_ecigarette,3e3zk7,SpeshulSnoflake,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's about it. It's getting the right flavours and right percentages mixed together in a way that tastes good that's the tricky part haha  It's not that scary, I'm just super indecisive when it comes to picking which recipes to try, but I'm hoping to be taking the plunge soon. :D"
Canadian_ecigarette,3e3zk7,GreatBigPig,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:23 2015 UTC,I think I will just try some of the tried and tested recipes. First I need to scrape up some cash. :-)
Canadian_ecigarette,3e3zk7,REDZED24,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"I just got my nic base from Hydavape today.  Haven't tried it yet, But it looks great!  And I ordered it Friday.  So it was quick. I bought All my PG, VG and flavors from TPA directly.  I found a few recipes and ordered those flavors, and a few extra to tinker around with.  My second order was more flavors to tinker around with and bigger bottles of the flavors I found I used the most.  Bottles and syringes I found on eBay. Just like you, I was looking for a kit with everything when I started and after hours of searching, I realized that buying separately would give me the best bang for my buck. Next step for me is getting a scale and mixing by weight.  If I were you, I'd start there."

If they don't let me know so I can pick that tank and coils up because I've tried it in so many other tanks and premade coils and it gunked them up after a day or two. I have had to switch to dripping it.

Stating that you left after 3 minutes because of talking about the box when the box came out at 2 minutes and had maybe a minute of dialog about it isn't exactly constructive criticism since there's no real validity behind it.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,v3d2,6,Mon Jul 20 16:59:13 2015 UTC,"Do you even realize how poorly our dollar is performing right now? Exchange rates are at an all time high. I've never found any vendor in Canada that doesn't offer ample nic,pg,VG options. As far as shipping goes, if cost money to move things around the country. Buying in Canada guarantees no seizures of shipments as well. Imagine, you make a nice bulk order of juice and HC snatches it up destroys/ships it back. Now you're out. Buying single 30ml is not the way to go anymore. Buying in volume gets great discounts. /u/thevaporist sells 5 30ml for 49.99 with free shipping..that's an amazing deal. ICYMI there was an article on ECR from an industry insider that exposed a bunch of liquid makers for not actually using clean rooms or any sterile equipment. They were some big names too. I'll never buy US made liquids. I'll DIY before I ever get to that point. By the time you factor the product cost,exchange rate,shilling costs and the risk factor its cheaper to buy here.  EDIT: I don't know how long you've been around on here but /u/majorvapes and /u/CuBu have done several reviews on Canadian brands. Both of them do excellent reviews."

I've been ordering all my goods from the states for years because of how terrible the prices are in Canada for just about every product.   2 years ago I bought my Extreme Q from the states for $140, while it was selling for $220 in Canada... even though it's manufactured in Canada."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,Lampburglar,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:32:29 2015 UTC,"Evaperated = $0.56 / ml @ 30ml  SZvapor = $0.5 / ml @ 30ml  Vapor North = $0.5 / ml @ 30ml | Sale packs = $0.375 / ml @ 120ml -- $5 shipping  The Vaporist = $0.53 / ml @ 30ml | Sale packs = $0.3 / ml @ 150ml -- free shipping on multi packs  East Coast Vapes = $0.33 / ml @ 30ml - definitely the most reasonable, but only EMT/Money order/pay over the phone? fuck that  Overall, definitely not impressed at the regular prices. Also, like I said before - there's not many ratings compared to Mt Baker for example which has hundreds on each item, and only costs $0.15 / ml  Also, when I spoke to Mt Baker, they said most of the orders just get returned to them, and they'll re-ship for free. But the point is, unless they start labeling their orders as ""perfume"" or something else instead of ejuice, it will just keep getting seized and returned."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,SlovenianSocket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"I bought my first sub ohm setup from Mt Baker before I knew of all the Canadian Vendors. I ordered some juice to go with it. This is the scenario you need to look at. It took 10 days to get to the border. 3 days to process it through. If it had been held for seizure that would likely take 7-10 days to get the letter in the mail. You call them, they release it back to the sender. 10 days later MBV gets it back. 10 days later its back at the border and hopefully it makes it through. MBV will only reship for free ONCE. The next time is on you. All in all worst case scenario it takes a 6-8 weeks to get to you. Best case scenario 1.5-2 weeks  EDIT: All the while you could have any Canadian vendor land an order at your door in a week or less. The Vaporist ships in 24hrs and its never taken more than 3-4 days to get here."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,SlovenianSocket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:53:22 2015 UTC,"The point of this thread is to find retailers who don't explicitly ship their packages as ""ejuice"" so that we can actually get the package in 4-7 business days to Canada.  Looks like vapewild, among others do this.   I'd also much prefer to order from US companies who actually value their customers, give them good deals/fair prices, have promotions, coupons, discounts, and giveaways rather than these Canadian companies who are basically saying ""fuck you, pay our ridiculous prices"" and that's that."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,Lampburglar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:21 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're after here and I'm not trying to devalue this thread in any way but I can think of a few active Vendors on this thread who do regular promotions,offer discounts and even have static Reddit exclusive coupons.  Sure, giveaways are cool but I wouldn't say a vendor is bad because they don't do giveaways. Canadian Vendors have a higher cost for all their products as well so they're not trying to rip you off, they simply just have bills to pay, overhead costs and obviously cost of ownership . One of our great Vendors even throws on 10.00 coupon codes every now and again. Either way, I see what you're after,I just don't agree with some of the statements made. Ivd delt with many Canadian juice makers and all of them would break their backs to make sure you're satisfied. So to group all Canadian Vendors as a bunch of give no fucks jerk offs is incorrect. Maybe you got burned somewhere along the line, I don't know but you can't generalize all vendors in the same category."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,Lampburglar,0,Tue Jul 21 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"No, I'm just sick of retailers overcharging Canadians, just because they can - and Canadians are forced or willing to pay those prices. I strictly order from the states, I'm willing to pay USD + shipping + customs + duties, and at the end of it all, I still get better prices than these retailers here.   Look at big guy /u/MikeArumba, charging OBSCENE prices.  Eleaf 30w for $73? Subox mini for $96? Is that a fucking joke? He's able to expand so rapidly because of how he scalps Canadians. I've contacted the manufacturers for wholesale inquiries, and those prices are honestly ridiculous. Just shop at fasttech.com and you can get a subox kit for $50 shipped.   Oh but maybe 180smoke will throw a petty coupon your way to make you feel like you aren't getting fucked on the regular.   they simply just have bills to pay, overhead costs and obviously cost of ownership .   Hmm, then these companies must be running in the red?  http://coolvape.ca/products/eleaf-ismoka-istick-30w - Eleaf 30w for $39.97    http://www.dashvapes.com/products/mods/25/eleaf+istick+30w+kit/734/5278 - $39.99"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,DJ_Chaps,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you feel that way, but as the previous commenter stated Canadian Vendors have a higher cost for all their products. We do have bills to pay, overhead costs and a cost of ownership. Our eLeaf 30w is $44.95, and the subox mini price is a bundle including a removable battery and a discounted 30ml bottle of juice, so you may have been a little mixed up with our prices."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,CuBu,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:02 2015 UTC,"No I noticed the additional things you included, still minimal in terms of added value.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,TheVaporist,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:13 2015 UTC,"I was referring strictly to liquids. As far as hardware goes, the bigger B&M's order in vastly larger quantity,huge quantities. They get great bulk discounts and are able to offer far better pricing. There will be greater price breaks at different quantities. I shop heavily before buying hardware, its easy to get hosed on hardware pricing. I'll agree with you on that hands down. My local B&M is selling the subox mini kit for 169.99...its a fucking joke. Hah"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,Winter_knights,-4,Tue Jul 21 01:02:34 2015 UTC,"Companies who make liquids produce them for less than a dollar per 30ml, the rest is just pure profit. Don't think for a second that 180smoke is just a poor company trying to scrape by.   Do you really think 180smoke is ordering in small quantities? No, they'll just bend over customers because they can. Until people stop buying their shit and pretending like their prices are reasonable, nothing will change. It's just like every other industry in this country. Alcohol, cable, internet, phone, gas, etc are the same way."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,SlovenianSocket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"Yes but there's more to it than raw production costs. Factor labor cost, factor equipment costs, utility costs, rent costs, insurance costs, heating costs in winter, cooling costs in summer. Shipping costs to acquire product, employee wages. Shit man,that's business ownership 101.  If every vendor made a bottle of juice for 1.00 and sold it for 2.00 they would be out of business by the end of the week. Add all those expenses together and factor that into the cost of the product so that you gain an operating profit and can still bank cash. The point of a business is to make money, not give shit away for nothing."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,Lampburglar,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"I totally understand that, the point is what is a reasonable profit margin before you start fucking your customers. Clearly a company that's able to expand at rate like 180smoke is making some serious profit. The would sell more units if they lowered their prices, and in turn would make customers much happier."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,TheVaporist,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:38 2015 UTC,Everyone saying VapeWild labels as essential oils.  I'm looking at my box that says ejuice.  Hmmmm.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,anxdiety,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"Meh there are lots of great value options in canada and has 0 chance of getting seized, regardless of the packaging it has a chance to get taken at the boarder.   I don't recommend that anyone buy us juice to be honest.   And I'll further it and say most of the points you've made are invalid.  There are tones of variety across vendors, most of them allow you to customize your mix, at least to a certain point.   You're told they use medical grade facilities but wasn't vape wild just under the radar of using the exact opposite?   Anyway just saying I don't agree with buying from the US. All the power to you though, hope it doesn't get seized"

Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,cloudmerchant,0,Tue Jul 21 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"Most are 0.5+, and the ones who aren't give you barely any choice.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/3dyr1v/can_we_make_a_list_of_us_retailers_that/ctaaape"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,anxdiety,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:29 2015 UTC,Barely any choice? I know Evaperated and Vapor North both offer customizable nicotine strengths and ratios. I'm positive if you dropped a note to SZ he'd do custom ratios as well. I'm not sure what choice you're looking for. Perhaps a vendor that sell 500+ flavors but not any of them particularly well. Keep an eye open or order in bulk from Jughead if that's the case.   Keep in mind I also said in bulk. Evaperated if you spend $30 you get a free 30ml and 10ml of your choice. There's a coupon code for 10% (weloveyou) if you're not also using loyalty points and free express shipping (I've seen the $30 pricetag on my envelopes). My monthly order is 3x140ml with a 30ml and a 10ml. A total of 460ml for $136.50. That's a mere $0.30 per ml.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,FunkMast3r,0,Tue Jul 21 06:52:33 2015 UTC,"Evaperated is fine in terms of their selection and choices. Unfortunately they have barely any product ratings/reviews. The prices are terrible ($17 / 30ml) unless you go with 120ml, and there's no way I'm buying 120ml when I don't even know how good the flavor is.   As for that mere price, vape wild comes out to 325ml for 65 cad, or 650ml for the same price you paid. They also have several hundred reviews on products, so I know I'm picking something good."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,anxdiety,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:58:36 2015 UTC,"I don't trust product reviews or ratings on vendors websites. Far too many vendors are shady and filter them. Taste is far too subjective, hell even as much as I fanboy evaperated's juices there's some I don't like and they are coil killers. Evaperated is one of the vendors that is highly respected here. Sadie's not pumping out single note flavors just to fill a website as Vape Wild does.   I just checked and vape wild right now using Ship10 for 480ml of On Cloud is $68us. Which converts to around $90CAD. So you're right it is a lot cheaper, but from experience it's no where near the quality.   The way I see it is DIY is the equivalent of rolling your own smokes. Cheap and effective. Premium juices are like your Dunhills or Benson & Hedges. Your average juice lines are like your regular cheap brands like Number 7s. Then there's  vapewild and mbv which is akin to buying native smokes."

Then there's vapewild and mbv which is akin to buying native smokes.    Wow that makes no sense. You realize they use the same ingredients. USP VG/PG, and flavors from the typical flavoring companies. They're well reviewed on reddit, and juicedb. Mbv is one of the highest rated vape sellers, so it's ridiculous to call them natives.  Canadian companies don't use any magical products that make them premium. They rely on that illusion so you keep wasting your money on $0.5+ liquid prices"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,nothing_of_value,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:34:31 2015 UTC,"It's not just the difference in ingredients themselves but the actual flavor mixtures. Some people enjoy the discount US mixes but I find they taste no better than the overpriced Flavor Crafters here in Canada.   Just because they are high rated and hugely successful does not mean it's any good. Tim Horton's is beloved by most and hugely successful, but their coffee is still swill.   You are right there is a hole in the Canadian vaping market for a discount juice vendor to move into. We could use a Timmy's or Mc-Eliquid style vendor that just shits out single note flavors.   A final thought to consider though is the size of our market. We're a fraction of the size of the US. A lot folks are still under the belief that nicotine in e-juice is illegal. That discount e-juice vendor is going to have difficulty making ends meet when they cannot push enough volume to compensate. Combine that with the horsecrap that is Canada post charging $30 for an express package from BC to Ontario."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,FunkMast3r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:25 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of skewed thinking you end up with after being scalped for so long with Canadian prices. Just because US retailers offer good prices, doesn't mean that their product is ""discount"" quality. They offer good prices because they understand that good prices will allow them to sell volume and earn more than charging artisan prices for the same kind of shit. Look at /u/dashvapes most of their products are premium priced, yet only have 3-4 stars. Doesn't sound like artisan quality to me.   US retailers have fierce competition, and unless they offer good prices, quality products, and good customer service - they'll fall behind. Vape wild/MTB are on top of their game. In Canada it's just acceptable to offer mediocre products at high prices, so why bother improving? Pretty much every industry in Canada is like that. Rogers charges $80 for 500mb of mobile data as if it's 1965, why? because fuck you that's why. These vape companies charge $20 /30ml, why? because fuck you. Hopefully the nicotine ban will be lifted, so people can experience actual quality businesses without worry.    Combine that with the horsecrap that is Canada post charging $30 for an express package from BC to Ontario.    Pretty much every seller charges the customer the shipping costs, so that doesn't really effect anything."

Personally I'm a custard lover with my adv being patient zero. My GF has been nothing but peppermint. The peppermint appears easy. The custard is where I get lost. There's so many flavor companies all with variations; FW, TFA; Lorran; Capella. Looking at recipes and flavor reviews some are good on their own, others are good when mixed with other flavors. A lot of those other flavors are not something that I think would appeal to me on their own (marshmallow, cheesecake, french vanilla and so on). It feels like a lot just for a single flavor.   Then there's the additives like sweeteners on top of playing with numerous flavors."

People far better than me should be able to answer it for you.   It can take time to learn but if you go to this site and look up the good star reviewed juices you should be able to come up with something :) also do you mix by weight or by syringe?
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,deltrisej,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:50 2015 UTC,Haven't even ordered anything to start with. Just doing my due diligence getting up to speed before doing so. I do plan on going by weight as that seems to be the best and most accurate method.   I've visited that site before and it's part of the reason for the confusion. Taking the top rated custards they contain a lot of flavors I could never see being used elsewhere.   Part of me just doesn't want to end up with a shelf full of flavorings that I never use. Quite similar to the shelf of steeping juice that I keep procrastinating on sorting through.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dyr1v,mazeofmystery,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:16 2015 UTC,Yes it does require a certain amount of motivation but its well worth it. Myself I only have 21 flavours but I find I can make a wife assortment of flavours. That is the joy of making your own juice. Being able to mix and match with a wide variety of flavours. So lets say you make a custard that has a lot of different flavours. Well joy you have the flavours for a specific recipe. But nothing is stopping you from making other simple recipes with those same juices.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dvxqc,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:08:05 2015 UTC,How come? Do you recco a different tank?
Canadian_ecigarette,3dvxqc,HalifaxVapist,4,Mon Jul 20 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"I could recommend a couple others but the Triton is quite good imo. Also has great reviews. Haven't heard of the crown or used the Beast.  Don't know why I'm getting downvoted for answering your question... Ahhh reddit, tis a silly place.   The Smok TCT is great, and if you rebuild the Lemo would be worth checking out. I also like the Eleaf Melo for an inexpensive sub ohm tank."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dvxqc,dienah13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"Silo Beast is the second best tank I've ever tried. First place goes to the Freemax Starre Pro. The Beast with 1ohm Atlantis 2 coils is great! No gross Atlantis coil taste. Also the temp sensing coils are fantastic. Top fill and an exceptionally high quality tank make for a great vape. The triton I found in the last few days I've owned it, mutes flavours quite a bit."

I know it wasn't on your list, but I'm not too familiar with using any of those tanks to be honest.  The Goblin has been nothing but the best for me. My pros and cons on it is, goes through juice real quick (but sub ohm tends to do that), flavour is top notch almost dripper quality imo, amazing vapor production.   BUT, it can be a bit of a pain to build on.  Goblin has always been my top pick for sub ohm tanks."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dwqpb,dicktoronto,2,Mon Jul 20 04:17:41 2015 UTC,"Some reasons why I don't like this product (from the JUUL site):   Benzoic Acid, is a naturally occurring acid found in the tobacco plant, which is a part of our proprietary formulation that makes JUUL the ultimate vaping experience   I enjoy how they are sugar coating the addition of preservatives into the e-liquid.   JUUL uses a closed loop temperature control algorithm to deliver the ideal amount of power at any given time to the JUULpod.    A fancy way of saying each pod has a predetermined resistance and the device delivers a constant fixed voltage.  Unless they've figured out temperature control for nichrome before Evolv.   The juice is heated using an industry standard wick and nichrome coil system.   Industry standard wick = silica or cotton(?)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dwqpb,tjc103,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that there is only one strength available, making it useless as a quitting aid."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dwqpb,Jack_Lad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:50:57 2015 UTC,Actually... It's kind of interesting... It's pretty close to the experience of an actual cigarette. Wouldn't be surprised if this is helpful for their target demographic of the average smoker.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dwqpb,tjc103,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of these comments. I think that if we look at it with smokers' goggles on, it's a great way of dumbing down what we do, and letting smokers know, ""hey, the product is a cigarette replacement."" nothing else...   Benzoic acid, can't comment, not a chemist, have no opinions.   Temperature control algorithm, I think they're meaning to reference the fact that it will do exactly what you said, a fixed voltage and a consistent vape. It makes sense considering their competition is shitty cigalike manufacturers.   I would have to assume that they're using a silica wick. No burning / dry hit issues with silica if done properly, and organic cotton would be a selling feature for a company marketing something like this. ;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dwqpb,tjc103,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:12 2015 UTC,I thought the nicotine we were vaping was HCl and not freebased.  That was my understanding of part of the reason why it's hard to transition from smoking to vaping for some people...

Can you take them back to the shop and talk to them about it, perhaps let someone at the shop drip a bit of them and see what they think?

Canadian_ecigarette,3dtvkf,azylem,2,Mon Jul 20 06:04:57 2015 UTC,"I used to LOVE sovereign juices. I heard they changed their recipes or something in the past few months, I tried two of the flavors I loved since then and they are completely unvapeable for me now. Like you said, they taste like soap or plastic or something. I gave one bottle of Duchess away and kept a bottle of Peach Royale to steep. After steeping the peach tasted even MORE like plastic. No idea what happened or if its just my taste buds changing. For the record, before this happened, I vaped around 14 bottles of peach, 12 bottles of merlin and about 8 bottles of duchess. Now I'm only gonna buy from /u/Vendeta44 (that guy is so awesome) til I finally start making my own, tired of being ripped off for garbage juice."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dtvkf,azylem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:53:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it is impossible, never know how long a juice has been on a counter for at any given shop.   I believe from his recent submissions he is in the process of having one put together. For now just pm him for his goodies :D He has a peach juice that tastes just like the fuzzy peach candies with an interesting throat hit. another one called dragon's toast which kinda tastes like cinnamon toast crunch a little but its really light in a dripper, my current adv's.   He has a grape one and a berry one too but they don't really fit my flavor preferences, so others would enjoy them more than I do."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,Beardharmonica,3,Sun Jul 19 02:56:32 2015 UTC,My Kayfun 4's have more flavor than my Lemo and Lemo 2's.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,Jhantax,2,Sun Jul 19 05:11:47 2015 UTC,"Because of the restricted airflow, just close it on the Lemo youll get the same with a better quality tank. Also all Kayfun leaks and have so many parts, its just collecting dust right now."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,Beardharmonica,2,Sun Jul 19 18:35:33 2015 UTC,Definitely get some sort of Lemo. Just got thr Lemo Drop and imLOVING the flavour this thing is giving me
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,Rew4Star,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"Also using the Lemo 2 but with a slightly smaller glass drip tip. I can't go back to the stock one, I find it heavily mutes the flavour.   Would recommend it if you have a couple drip tips to try out on it, something a little thinner,or don't mind picking a couple up from fasttech to try."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,SpeshulSnoflake,2,Sun Jul 19 03:18:56 2015 UTC,I have a Subtank Mini v2 and I use a drip tip from a Mini Protank 3 on it. Decent flavour.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,kintyre,3,Sun Jul 19 11:23:45 2015 UTC,"You can get flavour out of the newer cloud tank, but they are more cloud tanks. You must go with more restrictive tanks like kayfuns/taifuns/squapes.    Or if you're willing rebuildable carto tanks like the Sofia with the Cage from ""mods by Leo""    http://i.ytimg.com/vi/nkE_V0KylvE/maxresdefault.jpg"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,greekdude1821,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:59 2015 UTC,I love the squape r widedeck for cotton builds.     Currently running a subtank v2 and find it leaks a lot.  Yet will make a good travel setup.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,Circusmidget,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:42 2015 UTC,I haven't tried the Delta 2 or Lemo but I get great flavour with the subtank mini
Canadian_ecigarette,3dssh8,The_Stiffness,2,Sun Jul 19 14:03:51 2015 UTC,I found the Atlantis 2 is awesome as long as you get the drip tip adapter and an actual drip tip!

Canadian_ecigarette,3draom,MacHater420,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:20:00 2015 UTC,I had a less than desirable experience with the one in Regina.  They came very highly reccomended from a friend though and he still speaks incredibly highly of them.    The one in Regina seems to cater to the higher end mech mod crowd and the guy working didn't seem to want to take the time of day to help me understand what I wanted.  This was a while ago and with a larger understanding of how mods works the mech mods they make seem pretty legit and I am considering one as a segway between my Sigelei 150w and building my first mech myself.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,Awesummzzz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:44:27 2015 UTC,Honest noob question: does dna200 allow tc on kanthal too?
Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,FlamingDragonSS,2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:48 2015 UTC,Negative. Temp control is only for titanium and nickle coils. DO NOT USE KANTHAL!  That's a bad recipe
Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,FlamingDragonSS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:44:20 2015 UTC,Good call
Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,Awesummzzz,2,Sat Jul 18 21:53:05 2015 UTC,I don't even think that as possible as Innokin says it is. TC works because of the huge resistance changes that happen when you heat Ni200 and Ti wire. The device has an algorithm programmed into it that can estimate the temperature based on the resistance change   EDIT: Kanthal's resistance doesn't change that dramatically for it to work that way
Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,FlamingDragonSS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:24:33 2015 UTC,great info. Thank you!

Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,Awesummzzz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, neither did I. I went to the shop to get new coils and I asked if he brought a tank for me but he forgot and said he did remember to bring the ipv4. I first though, ""okay just the regular one"" I looked in the glass and there the 4S was sitting. I cursed him because I just bought this one yesterday and he chuckled and said ""Why don't you just buy that too?"" I already was going to haha."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:15 2015 UTC,It totally does. The ipv4s is only 120w and the ipv3 li with the firmware is 200w. The ipv4s in temp control goes to 100j but the 3 only goes to 50. The 3 cost me $150 and the 4 was $110
Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:32:06 2015 UTC,Which would you say is the better of the two with your short amount of time with them?
Canadian_ecigarette,3dr8h3,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the ipv4s. It's more ergonomic and smaller which I bring to work and need that. I haven't been able to test temp control on both yet so I can give you a opinion on that. I don't need 200w and 120w is more than enough. The ipv4s is way better looking IMO. The ipv3 is very square and it doesn't tickle my fancy."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dqto2,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:54:09 2015 UTC,Depends on what you mean by local since logical is the only one that I know if that's made and sold in Nova Scotia. I'm a big fan of vapornorth stuff as well since their max vg is true max vg. I've been making my own juice lately so I don't do a lot of purchasing other than diy supplies and the odd bottle of Serial or Berry Blaster from logical liquids.

One was called parlour (vanilla bean icecream with koolada) and is actually really good. As far as overall selection goes I think that the vapour trail on Joe Howe Drive has that covered. They carry premium labs, liquidejuice, blind pig, space jam, five pawns, and a few others I can't think of."

I didn't end up going but I'll probably pop in next time I go to vapor hub.   I don't go to vape escape any more since getting sold fake stuff by him. I will admit he makes decent juice though but that really pissed me off (especially since I was a noob at the time and it could have turned me off vaping) and I haven't been back since.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dp60z,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:57 2015 UTC,Looking to trade mainly.  Half or more are prizes so I def wouldn't feel right accepting a big value on them.  10 per 30ml in trade value or w/e?  edit:  cash is fine if neccesary.  I'd be putting it right back into vaping anyway.

For example for a while they had the cheapest price out there on Sigelei 150ws, but it turns out they were basically selling be stock units that were lacking the second QC check, and could have scratches or other imperfections."

Get something made by nitecore or xtar, avoid anything with fire in the name like trustfire or ultrafire.  +1 for illumination supply and the samsung 25r batteries.

Canadian_ecigarette,3do0vv,kelfun,2,Sat Jul 18 11:30:46 2015 UTC,Its just not feasible to offer free shipping on all orders in Canada. The shipping costs are to much even with a business account with Canada post.
Canadian_ecigarette,3do0vv,Vendeta44,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:37:56 2015 UTC,Most vendors offer free shipping after a certain price point. For example free shipping after 100$.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dmnfg,saient,3,Fri Jul 17 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just means you'll put less. If you were making 10ml with 3mg nic, if you had a 48mg base you'd use 0.63ml of the nic solution while if you had 100mg base you'd use 0.30ml.  I just got into DIY this week and found that steam engine has a juice calculator that helps out quite a bit. If you have any other questions, feel free to shoot me up."

Not familiar with the MVP2, but here's a very in-depth review.  I'm about to order a Cool Fire 4, which is regarded to have a very impressive battery life."

My one 30w has been great and the 50w I almost never use anyways because it's twice the size.  I believe how you treat them has a lot to do with how well the last as well."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dkr4n,skinnyhobo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:44:12 2015 UTC,"My bad. I always thought they went from the 20 straight to the 50 and then back to the 30 as so many manufacturers were coming out with mods hovering around 40W and they were back-pedalling, trying to fill that gap.  Anyhoo, I have yet to encounter any sort of problem with my iStick 50W after 3 months of solid use as my only box."

I bought it off AliExpress though, and I contacted the seller and he promptly re-sent me a new one. I would see no issue taking it back to Dash.  With some doubt that the seller would've re-sent me a new one, I went out and got the VT which I am absolutely in love with. Though, there are very mixed reviews on it.

Canadian_ecigarette,3djhus,VoralisQ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:45:35 2015 UTC,I'm having the same problem. I'm going to try drilling some 2.5MM holes on the sides I don't think those juice holes are adequate at all.
Canadian_ecigarette,3djhus,JoytechThrowaway,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:29 2015 UTC,I've seen one youtube demo where the person had drilled larger holes in the barrel.  Might be a thing I have to do as well.
Canadian_ecigarette,3djhus,sorennordstrom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is 100% with the way you're wicking it.  Cut the wicks short.  Like a bowtie.  Then from the outside of the wick cut off a triangle (down towards the base of the deck at a 45 degree angle from the ""top"" of the wick).  This should make your wick look something like a trapezoid. Once the chimney is on use a small screwdriver to push the ends of the wicks up against the edge of the coil.  This will clear your juice channels. This will solve your wicking problems.  Use less cotton than you think you need.    I use 5/6 wraps of 24g Kanthal around a 2.3mm bit to get ~0.8 ohms, wick it as described, use 90%+ VG juice and have never had a dry hit on the delta.  You certainly do not need to bore the juice channels out any more."
Canadian_ecigarette,3djhus,sorennordstrom,3,Fri Jul 17 00:14:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks Sorennordstrom!  I actually found a vid describing/demo'ing this method (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPsD4p5GD_g).  Tried it last night.  No hole drilling nothing.  Just wicking.  Clouds are back, no semi-dry hits, mucho flavour!  I also made a new coil for it.  26g Kanthal, double strand twisted with a drill, 6/7 twists, on a 2.5mm 0.86ohm @ 39w and yummy).  Running Onehitwonder Milk Man."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,demon1102,2,Thu Jul 16 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"Voting for kanthal, though I have never used anything else. I've transitioned from 28ga to 26 to 24. Big fan of 24, but 26 is a safe bet too. Thicker gauge is slightly easier to work with...less ""springy.""  It depends what you want to do with it, really. It takes some experimentation to figure out what works best for you, but if you have a ballpark estimate of the kind of resistance you're shooting for, that is helpful.   The lower the gauge, the lower the resistance will be. Since you're dripping, I'd assume you're going to be running dual coils in the sub-ohm range. Depending on your batteries and mod, there'll be a limit of how low you can build. I'd say 26ga and 24ga are your best bet, and if ""lower is better"" you'll probably want to go with the lower gauge.   I still have 28 and 26ga, though since receiving my 24ga from Lightning Vapes last week(ish), I have wondered if I'll use them again. 28ga was my first, and I used it in single-coil configurations in RTAs. I've since used it to try twisted builds, so it hasn't gone to waste. 26ga is still useful, but I'm using 24 now to get more wraps with less resistance.   If I wanted to use a mech (and had batteries that could handle super low-res builds), I'd probably opt for 22ga. Higher-power, lower-resistance builds, 24ga. Mid-range sub-ohm, 26ga. Nearing 1 ohm with a dual-coil or single-coil >1ohm builds, I'd use 28. I'd also use 28 and 26 for twisted/parallel builds as I don't tend to build much lower than 0.4-0.5."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:25:44 2015 UTC,Thank you ~
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,kkeeiiggaann,2,Fri Jul 17 02:57:16 2015 UTC,"Not sure I made a ton of sense there, but I hope it helps. I'd say given the price of kanthal (at least at Lightning Vapes), you could grab a few spools and see what you prefer. It's nice to have different gauges for different applications to fine tune it to whatever your preference may be.   TL;DR, maybe 26 and 24ga on a regulated mod and 24 and 22 on a mechanical (if you want to build super low)."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,jungleismassiv3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"I like kanthal personally. I started with 26 and built a lot of coils. The higher the gauge, the thinner the wire and I believe the higher the resistance. 28 is good for dual coils in my experience"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,majorvapes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:35:55 2015 UTC,Thank you :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,majorvapes,2,Thu Jul 16 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"The thicker gauges like 26, 24, and 22+ are best for sub ohm vaping while the thinner ones like 28, 30 and 32+ are good for non subohm vaping or for twisting or making Clapton coils. Kanthal is a good place to start but nichrome isn't much different, it's lower resistance and ramps up quicker. Nickel and titanium are reserved for temp control.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,majorvapes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:33 2015 UTC,My device is up to 30W. I also have a unregulated mod. I plan to rebuild my subtank mini and troll
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,CuBu,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"If you're working with 30w I would suggest you start with some 28 or 26 gauge kanthal. Practice some basic builds and work your way up. Check out steamengine if you haven't already.  They even have an app that makes it real handy. It can tell you what gauge, what length and how many wraps along with a whole slew of other info like heat Flux.   Let us know if you have any questions!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,CuBu,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:32 2015 UTC,Yeah that should be fine
Canadian_ecigarette,3dj757,DavidBoone,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"Ni200 and titanium are all for temperature control devices don't use them unless you have a TC device!   You want kanthal if you're just starting out if encourage 26g or 28g the gage is just the thickness of the wire, and thicker the wire the lower resistance for example 5 wraps of 26g wire might read .8 ohms, while the same amount of wraps on the same size screwdriver or whatever with 28g wire could read something like 1.1ohms (just an example not real numbers)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3di5k2,greekdude1821,2,Thu Jul 16 20:24:02 2015 UTC,I wouldn't blame the tank but rather the MVP 2. It is notorious for having soft 510 threads and a 510 pin that needs to be gently pried up from time to time.   Overtightening and tanks that have longer pins forces the 510 down. As you said you needed a lot of pressure to make a connection. Just pry the 510 up gently and only screw your tanks on far enough to make a connection. If they're unstable loosen the beauty ring up to reach the tank to act as a support.

You may also need to clean the connector on the MVP2, sometimes shit can get jammed under it and stop it from depressing.  Do you have a backup tank to see if that fits?

Canadian_ecigarette,3dfj2c,xenoxonex,4,Wed Jul 15 23:32:49 2015 UTC,Instead of buying pre-made coils you can make your own. That will save you money and give you a lot more flexibility for flavour and clouds. Check Google or Youtube for coil building.

Was my second rebuildable at that point and I loved it."

It comes with a couple coils already done for you and some cotton, so I'd definitely encourage you to try it out. Just put one of the coils in the RDA with the little screws, and watch a couple videos on proper wicking technique.  I feel like it sounds like I work for Kanger in all my posts here lol, but I'm honestly just really pumped about my Subtank Mini, especially since I've gotten better at building the RDA.

Canadian_ecigarette,3dfj2c,xenoxonex,2,Thu Jul 16 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"The mod itself will read the resistance, some closer to the real value than others. It will get you by initially, or in a pinch, but not recommended for long term. A decent OHM Meter is an essential part of a coil builder's tool box."
Canadian_ecigarette,3dfj2c,Hubatola,2,Thu Jul 16 10:30:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not using a mechanical mod, so I generally just trust the iStick's reading. I do have a multimeter though, so I could use that in a pinch if I really wanted to.  It's when you're using a mechanical mod that you need to be careful about that stuff, because you'll be doing all the regulating rather than the chip in something like an iStick.  Edit: To be honest, I trust my iStick's reading, and that of my multimeter for that matter, far more than the cheap ohm meters I see many people using. If I were using a mech mod, I would most certainly just make a 510 adapter for my multimeter, rather than use some budget meter in a project box."

Canadian_ecigarette,3ddxzs,RobertDF902,4,Wed Jul 15 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"All in all a pretty solid feeling device. Hits hard, nice buttons, really really nice 510.  1 2 3  Works great! I just happened to be at my favorite shop when the courier arrived so we dug right in. Used the TC coils in a subtank and was pretty impressed with it. I have been on the fence about temp control for a bit but this definitely a step in the right direction. I tried to get a dry hit out of it just for testing and it was solid. As soon as the wick goes dry it goes instantly in to protection mode as it detects a sudden spike in temp, same if you fire it without puffing on it, it will stop so it doesn't burn and as soon as you start puffing it takes right off again. The buttons feel great, no fuss just click the button between the arrows to quickly toggle between temp and wattage. The new 510 connector is what stood out the most, nice stainless steel threads and just looks really well made. Slightly bigger battery than the 20 and 30 at 2600mah. Also it is 22m wide so no more overhang like the 20 and no weird ""platform"" like the 30w. It is a tiny little bit bigger than the 30w as you can see in the pictures but still feels comfortable in your hand. My only real issue with it is the battery size, I've become accustomed to my istick 50w, but the 100w is right around the corner."

Canadian_ecigarette,3dfsld,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:40:41 2015 UTC,I broke my arctic 2 weeks ago and ordered replacement glass for it. It came yesterday and the glass is longer than the original arctic glass which is a huge pissoff. It doesnt screw in all the way theres a little gap between the base and the tank. Really disappointed. Hopefully yours isnt like that.
Canadian_ecigarette,3dfsld,adultishgambino1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Contact them and get a refund/fixed. If they have it listed as a replacement for the correct tank then they fucked up, or they sent you a clone/fake"
Canadian_ecigarette,3dfsld,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:22 2015 UTC,I will although this still works and theres no leaks so far so im just happy to be using it again i mean it was only 5$ anyway but ill see if they will send me the right glass

Canadian_ecigarette,3dfani,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:11 2015 UTC,Very happy to hear that !
Canadian_ecigarette,3dfani,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:16:43 2015 UTC,That's wicked. Definitely a step up from the testing bars I have in Nova Scotia! Read: none.  Fucking regulations :(  Seriously though I would put those on iStick 30ws or something that it's impossible to burn the coils out on
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,GreatBigPig,4,Wed Jul 15 16:20:46 2015 UTC,It really depends on the device you are using. The lower the ohms of the tank/coil the lower the nicotine you use. If you are starting with a coil that is around 1.8 ohms I would suggest you start at 12mg or 18mg. If you are using a coil around 1.2 ohms I would suggest 6mg or 12 mg. If you are using a 0.5 ohm coil I would suggest 3mg or 6mg.  Lower ohm coils make more vapor so you need less nicotine. Good luck!!
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,Robbie-R,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"I smoked just shy of a pack a day of export a green, i started at 12 mg and dropped within the first few weeks if that helps at all, but a lot of it will also depend on how much youll be vaping. If you can puff away all day long 12 mg may end up being too much."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,mryd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks. So ya smoke ""Green Death""? What flavour do you enjoy? I am curious what some smoking export a would go to."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,mryd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"Haha, i did yeah. I started with a tobacco flavor, hated it. I bought some cheap assorted juice from mount baker vaper and quickly found out im a big fan of fruity flavors. Currently my adv is from a local brand, its a pomagranite berry mix. I couldnt get into tobacco flavors at all, hated every one ive tried."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,Rabid_Grasshopper,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:38:27 2015 UTC,It would depend on what type of device you have.
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,lilfunky1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about a regulated, and maybe starting above 1 ohm for a while, until I can build decent coils slightly below 1, maybe .7 or 8. That may be months off."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"My husband was a pack-a-day smoker and was suggested that he started at 18mg.  That was way too high for him though, he got sick from it and I had to go re-buy a bunch of juice at 12mg for him instead.  Based on that experience, I think 12mg is a decent place to start."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,dienah13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"There's really no right or easy answer. This will vary from person to person. Vaping habits are as varied as diet. Your device, frequency of use, power settings, and many other factors will come into play.   There is also no real way of finding equivalency between the dosage labelled on the bottle and the dosage you're consuming, and no equivalency between the dosage achieved through smoking vs. vaping. The only way to really know how much nicotine you're absorbing into your body is to do blood tests.   This is one of the better things about vaping, believe it or not. You get to troubleshoot this yourself...meaning you won't be handed a simple answer, which can be frustrating. However, because you get to troubleshoot this yourself, you get to tailor your addiction treatment to your needs, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach like with other NRTs.   Experiment, find your comfort zone, and don't give up. Once you've got it, there's relief...not to mention more hope than any other cessation method will provide."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,VanGoVapes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"When I started, I went straight to 24mg. Huge mistake, my throat was gone for days.  I'd start at 12mg, then lower after that."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,mmm_chitlins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:32:26 2015 UTC,I agree. with the new hardware these days you dont need anything above 12mg even if you were a heavy smoker. if you find yourself needing something higher id say just get a better device
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,mmm_chitlins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:58:24 2015 UTC,"I did the same. Needless to say, I took a few hits then stopped until I could get some 18, which I still think is unnecessary."
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,user59873,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"I would recommend you don't make the same mistake I did with 18mg, and just go with 12. I was a very heavy smoker, and I rolled Drum too, so I got 18 thinking I needed the strongest stuff I could find, but I really believe that 12 mg is more than enough for anyone.  I'm now on 3mg, but only because I'm sub-ohming.  Also, I really like nicotine as well lol"
Canadian_ecigarette,3de9ml,tjc103,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:52:28 2015 UTC,Most (all?) flavours come in nicotine free as well. Find a flavour you're reasonably sure you'll like (B&Ms will help a lot with this) and buy two bottles. Then you can mix more or less any strength you like.  I like 3mg but lots of flavours in Canada come with a min of 6mg so I always have a bunch of 0mg bottles lying around.

I was thinking some of us might post from mobile about where we're at or what's going on. I'm not familiar with the venue so can't comment on entrances until I'm there.

Canadian_ecigarette,3d7cvm,WackedOutMike,3,Tue Jul 14 02:21:20 2015 UTC,I did a build like this just the other day :)  Except I used twisted 32ga Ni200... it was a tight fit.   Not that fun to build but it works great.  It's been the only temp control coil i've been able to build that I liked.

I picked up an IPV3 LI (first TC regulated device) and I've been absolutely loving it, and have been enjoying the TC mode a lot too. I've been finding it difficult to get the same amount of flavor though without switching to a smaller RDA. Think it's due to surface area? I've been using 28g but got some 30g yesterday which I intend to twist. I will say that I figured out a couple builds that taste great and have amazing vapor production.

I also never smoked. I want to say that I can feel the impact on my lungs but it's borderline enough that I may just be imagining it. I also sometimes vape and bike so it can't be that bad.

I bummed my knee and learned to play video games while I was recovering and never went back. So not only did I let myself get out of shape, I picked up smoking. But that's all behind me. A year in and I'm so happy my boyfriend told me about vaping. =D"
Canadian_ecigarette,3d734g,HalifaxVapist,2,Tue Jul 14 02:48:29 2015 UTC,"Consisten jogger on the treadmill and occasionally on the treats. I have no lung issues with vaping and jogging. I must warn you though, your lungs haven't fully recovered from the 10 years of smoking and it does take time for them to fully recover. I'm saying this because if you find yourself out of breath, don't blame it on the vape, but look back to how bad tobacco affected your lungs. Hope this helps :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3d734g,merelyadoptedthedark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:36:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Yeah I realize it will take more than a year to clear my lungs up. But was just wondering if vaping wasn't helping. I'm just getting back into jogging so I'm not even jogging for 15mins at a time or anything yet. =)   But even after a year (of not smoking) I can take a take a deep breathe and not cough. So 12 months in and I can already notice lots of changes. I'd never blame vaping for my lung issues. If anything, I think vaping saved my life. And one day I hope to not vape. Even though I love the community, I love the flavours, I quit smoking for a reason so to me it doesn't make sense to vape for the rest of my life. But for a few years sure. I started at 18 nic and I'm down to 3, if they had 1 or more 2.5 I'd probably be vaping that.  Thanks again. =D"

I think after 1 month I was dying from the ""sucking a golf ball through a garden hose"" syndrome.    Went up to a Delta II and eLeaf iStick 50w.  Loved it.  Had issues with the 1st one with auto firing, got a replacement and then I started having issues on the other side.  The firing button wouldn't work half the time.   So I kept my delta II tank and moved up to an eVic VT 60w.  Building my own delta II coils and loving it.  I would skip all the hassle and go big from the get go and save the hassle."

Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,itlow,6,Tue Jul 14 00:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly recommend steering clear from most pen style e cigs and cigalikes. Poor vapor production, often leaky tanks, weak flavour, bad battery life, etc etc. You'll use it for 2 weeks and either put it down for good or upgrade to a new device and feel like your first purchase was a waste.  Since you're attracted to the pens I would recommend a small mod like the Eleaf iStick 20w or 30w: http://i.imgur.com/712jE1F.jpg  They are nice and compact for you like a pen style battery, last way longer, are adjustable wattage or voltage so you can use basically any tank you want on it. It's better in every aspect and not really any more money. Plus it will future proof you for a while, you wouldn't have to upgrade unless you wanted to. Whereas with a pen you'll definitely be getting a new device in a month if you stick with vaping (if you're not turned off by the sub par experience you'll have with an EVOD)  For a tank I'd recommend a Nautilus Mini.  Where are you located my friend? I'm in Nova Scotia myself. If you're close I have some stuff you might like to try out :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,HalifaxVapist,2,Tue Jul 14 00:21:05 2015 UTC,"Just started vaping and have the iStick 30 with a Nautilus mini. Love it! Simple, great battery life, the airflow adjustments are nice; lower for more 'pull' and higher for more taste. The total investment was a little more than a weeks worth of cigarettes.   There are so many styles and mods out there it was overwhelming at first. I've got friends that have dropped a grand on gear alone. The above set up wasn't complicated and works more than fine for me and my DH.   For juice try Evaperated from B.C.  Exhale is a green tea/green apple blend that is amazing and I've heard good things about her blueberry cheesecake version. She's on reddit too :D"

Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,Vendeta44,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:57:18 2015 UTC,"The bad battery life can be fixed by buying two batteries and alternating them.  I did that for eight months.  My batteries were only $15 though.  I am from Nova Scotia as well; fancy that!  Edit: Oh, just looked at the sub, this is Canadian_ecigarette  so it's less fancy I guess."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,mryd,6,Tue Jul 14 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone here is going to be very up to suggest more advanced mods like isticks subbox's and segelei. But the important thing to remember is to use what works for you. Don't get swayed into thinking a EVOD is less than a Istick, they both have the same purpose and either will work as long as thats what works for you.  What I'm saying here is if a evod gets you to quit and your happy, don't go down the rabbit hole, just stay and enjoy what you have.  Edit: And the downvotes start. Because I'm the only one who doesn't try and upsell someone into something they might not need. Grow up."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,HalifaxVapist,2,Tue Jul 14 01:24:37 2015 UTC,"I too would suggest not starting with a more advanced setup like most are talking about, depending on what you're looking for. I personally started with a pen style battery and a shitty tank and within a few weeks at most I bought an Istick 20 watt and a nautilus mini. With all the options currently available it depends on more what you're interested in. The new subox mini and subtank could also be a great way to go, it gives you the ability to mouth to lung inhale and if you wanted to try sub ohming, the option is there without buying a whole new setup.  TLDR: istick 20-50watt and nautilus is an amazing first setup for mouth to lung  kanger subox combo could also be worth picking up instead depending on if you're also interested in sub ohming and lung inhaling."

Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,dissentience,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:51 2015 UTC,"An iStick isn't what I'd call advanced though, and it's cheap too. Hardly more then the pen and infinitely better."

I've started building on the RBA that comes with the Subtank and I get aaawesome flavour from it. I wish that there wasn't such a ""cost barrier"" to a Subtank Mini with iStick 30w because I really feel that EVODs are a waste of money. That is, of course, my personal opinion. I just see the EVOD as a weak product when the Subtank isn't really that much more but totally awesome."

Wife uses an eLeaf iStick 30W and a Kanger Subtank mini as well. Before that she used an Aspire Nautilus, which is an ok starter tank.  Bonus with the Subtank is it can be used with either pre-made replaceable coils, or once you get further into your vaping trip, you can build coils using the RBA deck it comes with."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,lilfunky1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"I use a joytech ego one and an vision xjet tank (off-brand tank).  The ego one lasts all day and then some with 2200 mah, but still being small and  pen-shaped.  The tank is nothing special, except that it sits flush.  I don't like to turn up the voltage or huff big clouds because I use 18mg juice, and I like a pen shape.  If you've got bigger clouds you can lower the nicotine content but you use more juice, and I'm cheap and not willing to change things up.  EDIT Gf uses two vision eGo batteries, one charging while vaping the other, and an aspire CE5-S.  If you don't want to spend money on a battery that lasts all day you can get two cheap ones.  She isn't laying down any clouds either with these batteries but neither of us need any cigarettes any more.  EDIT2 A detail"

Outside of work, it all depends, if I'm at home on the pc generally I have a few setups, lately its been a Dimitri with the twisted messes rda, a stingray mech mod with a Mutation xv4 and the sigelei 150 watt with the hellboy. I often move mods and rda in and out of use, but thats the main 3 I've been using lately. I really like to have different builds, flavors, mods and airflow styles around to use based on what I want to grab."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,paleking2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:11:51 2015 UTC,Since January I've now owned...   the evod2 starter kit (came with two tanks/batteries) sigieli mini 30w + kanger subtank smok m80 + deltaII   The Smok M80+DeltaII is definitely my favourite out of everything I have and it's what I use every day.  But it's probably a bit obnoxious for a newbie.  The evod2 starter kit basically died on me after 6-8 weeks of not a lot of vaping.  I found having to take the tank off to charge the battery (then take the charger off to put the tank back on) every time it needed to charge was a total pain in the ass.  Also either the charger or the batteries eventually broke so that I had to REALLY twist with all the strength I could muster to get it to charge.  Would not recommend.
Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,CanadianLatitude,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"At just double the EVOD starter kit prices, I always tell ppl to check out the EGO 1 mini, great size and flavor, for a tiny device. Only a 850 mah battery so you will need to charge on the go."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d6u05,mmm_chitlins,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"Since you say elsewhere you use an EVOD, I'll say this first - if you're happy with it, stay with it. If/when it's not satisfying anymore, then look at alternatives rather than going back to smoking.  I started with a Kanger eSmart 510 starter kit. It got me and my wife off cigs.  We've gone through a bunch of different devices. I'm now using a Lemo Drop RTA or a Freakshow mini RDA on a Nemesis clone mech mod.  If / when you get to a point where you want to move on from the EVOD, I'd strongly suggest the Subtank mini on top of an iStick 30W.   The Subtank gives you great flexibility - you can use the premade coils to start and move to building your own as time goes by.  The tank performs really well with either the premade coils or your own.  The iStick seems to be a good all-in-one battery with good power and reasonably good battery life."

Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,HalifaxVapist,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more with the last statement. When i first started building, i did the same thing. Putting the coils on one side each gives you a much more even vapor production from the RDA."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,joeyxl,0,Thu Jul 16 01:41:44 2015 UTC,Is .30 ohm good or should it be higher? It says 'atomizer low' on my iStick 30w...
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:33 2015 UTC,"Every device has a low end cutoff on the resistance, generally depending on how much power it has. The 30w istick only reads/fires at 0.4ohms and higher. You'll have to chuck er on a more powerful mod or redo your coils :(  If you don't already, use http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp for making your coils how you want them."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,tet5uo,0,Mon Jul 13 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be dual coil either, I'm learning so if something is better on it I'd rather that. Problem is I have 1 tool that I can actually wrap on. :/"
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,tet5uo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well, if you remove one of those coils, you'll be at double the resistance, so .6 or so."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,HalifaxVapist,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:40:36 2015 UTC,I ended up taking 1 off. But remade the other to have 10 wraps. Now it;s .64 which I'm liking :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,mryd,3,Mon Jul 13 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"The mod won't care, but you'll get one coil really hot before the other one has had time to heat up."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,HalifaxVapist,2,Mon Jul 13 20:48:44 2015 UTC,"You could, look in to staged heating. Problem with what you described is that by the time the thicker coil heats up and vapes juice the small coil is blisteringly hot and might be burning juice."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,mmm_chitlins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'd run it like that, however a lot of people, myself included likes to run claptons and other higher ramp up time coils in parallel with a single wire to give you better ramp up time to heat up the clapton faster. Currently on my Twisted messes rda I'm using a 24 gauge core wrapped with 34 gauge parallel with 24 gauge."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,mmm_chitlins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:42 2015 UTC,No i made a new coil. XD
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,drjigarn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:04:29 2015 UTC,"Good stuff. Just for future reference you want both coils to be nearly identical/symmetrical. If one coil is bigger than the other it will have a longer ramp up time, which can lead to burnt hits, fucky taste etc"
Canadian_ecigarette,3d5i50,Iamjmax,4,Mon Jul 13 23:44:29 2015 UTC,This is incorrect. The Istick 20 won't fire below 1 ohm. The 30w will fire down to .4 ohms.

Its not a super pretty mod, but it certainly gets the job done.  I'd also recommend the ipv4 if you're looking to get into temperature control, it works fantastically and I personally love the way it feels in the hand. I cannot attest to how it holds up over time as I've only had mine a couple months, but so far its been performing excellently although it did scratch and scuff rather easily."

Thanks for sharing op, just got in on this sale for the lenola cream and some nana cream been wanting to try both for a long time."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d2n6c,lumpy420,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:03:32 2015 UTC,"(sorry, a bit late to the party)  I got Nana Cream from DashVapes, and was underwhelmed. It's not ""not good"", it's just... Meh. There are some notes that I really liked, but like I said, underwhelming. However, I tried Monkey Juice from TBD and ohhhh, now we're talking! It's like a boosted Nana Cream. I got 6 flavors from TBD and so far I am really impressed, there is only one that I don't really like. But the Nana Custard and the Churro are spot on and super tasty too. Anyways, I figured I'd throw in my 0.02 :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3d2n6c,lumpy420,0,Sat Jul 18 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"It's so weird you like read my order. I just ordered from TBD yesterday and a bunch of other budget places such as Gordana, Vape Wild, Mech Sauce, Evaperated. I really hope they're as good as you say because it'll save me so much money. Which of the TBD did you like the most?  My TBD order is  1x Monkey Juice - 3mg / 80VG/20PG for $7.99 each Bottle Size: 15ml Plastic Bottle ($7.99)  1x Cereal Fiend - 3mg / 80VG/20PG for $7.99 each Bottle Size: 15ml Plastic Bottle ($7.99)  1x Nana Custard - 3mg / 80VG/20PG for $7.99 each Bottle Size: 15ml Plastic Bottle ($7.99)  1x Churro - 3mg / 80VG/20PG for $7.99 each Bottle Size: 15ml Plastic Bottle ($7.99)  I only started with 15ml to try and whatever I like I'm going to buy 120mls.  I also bought 120ml of Beard Vape Co No 32 prior to deciding to go budget and 120ml of Blind Pig The Real Mccoy from Premium Labs.  Check out Premium Labs if you want a good Canadian juice. I also ordered Premium Labs other brands Yogen Fog and Worlds Best Custards to see how they are. Ares from Yogen Fog and Paris Fog from Worlds Best Custards."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d2n6c,SlovenianSocket,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:45:51 2015 UTC,"Haha, weird indeed :) My TBD (all 70vg/30pg at 6mg):  Churro - Spot on, reminds me of MBV Cinnamon Roll, only richer  Nana Custard - As mentioned before, A+  Monkey Juice - Nana Cream on steroids, awesome  Polar Pear - That one I'm not sure. The pear is very perfumey. I'm letting the bottle breath for a few days now and will get back to it later  Cereal Fiend - Jumping on the ceral bandwagon, I had to try it. Tastes exactly like dry Froot Loops with a milky exhale. It's interesting and nice on occasion, but not my kind of thing for an ADV.  Peanut Butter Cup (free sample) I haven't tried it yet, but it smells really good.  Overall, I'm mostly impressed with the quality of this juice for the price. Except for the pear, all the flavors come through as fresh and clean. The customer service is equally awesome.  Now, for Blue Dot Vapors, I got my first order this week and I don't think I'll order again. Most flavors are muted (I use a Nautilus with 1.8 coils on an MVP 3.0, nothing fancy, I can't subohm) and there is a chemical taste on a couple. Here's what I got (same ratio and nic):  Mars - Tastes like orange pledge with a creamy exhale, weird :s  Spring Honeysuckle - Very muted, interesting notes on inhale but overtaken by a chemical honeysuckle wannabe that does not make for a pleasant exhale  Santa Cruz - Kinda lime strawberry lemonade? I don't know, it's such a dry exhale, I'm not enjoying this  Vanilla White Peach Yogurt - Haven't tried it yet, but it does smell good (but very muted, once again)  Customer service was very nice. I will let all these steep (as opposed to TBD which are presteeped) for a while and go back to them in a few weeks.  Thank you very much for your suggestions, I will look at Premium Lab right away. I'm actually shopping right now. Thinking about trying the Milk Man and the Muffin Man, as Albert at e-cigarettes has them in 30ml (instead of the 180 you see everywhere).   Have you tried DSV? I'm curious about Albino Storm and Wabbit Season.  But that Lenola Cream is reallly tempting :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3d2os6,GreatBigPig,3,Mon Jul 13 01:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's really all preference man. Also the total resistance of the tank as well. Some like low wattage, some mid and some high. There's no cookie cutter answer, its all in what you like. For instance right now I'm running a dual coil Billow V2 and its built at .4ohm and I run it at 45.5w...perfect for me. Then again if I change juices I may need to adjust the wattage some. So its also depends on the juice. You'll figure it out as you go really.  EDIT:I am currently vaping tree of life:Apricot by the Vaporist at 45.5..seems the perfect wattage for flavor and vapor."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d2os6,Lampburglar,2,Mon Jul 13 02:33:05 2015 UTC,Nice to hear that it may not be as complicated as I thought. I was considering the unregulated dual 18650 as they are so damn inexpensive. I think my beginners ignorance holds me back a bit. I was unsure of how a dual 18650's output related to future coil builds. Sounds Like I can just experiment. The unit suggested has a mosfet. Supposedly less worry. Thanks for the advice.
Canadian_ecigarette,3d2os6,mryd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"I picked up a dimitri off fasttech a while back, which is a dual 18650 mechanical box. It works amazingly. The big thing about using mechanical versus regulated is that with mechanical you have to build your coils to how you want to vape, whereas with a regulated mod you can generally ramp the wattage up or down to suit your needs. Always remember to check for shorts, even more so with a mechanical mod and do not build beyond the amps your batteries support. Make sure if you're using any dual battery mod you're pairing your batteries together from new and keeping them together.  If you have any other questions please post and ask or pm, I'd be happy to help."

Review two similar juices at once and compare them, not necessarily ""this is better or worse"" but just explaining the qualities of each."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d1fqu,JuiceInTheOven,2,Mon Jul 13 01:47:24 2015 UTC,No need to take draws on a mod to punctuate the video. I always find it akward when the guy/girl is vaping during the video. Unless its to demonstrate airflow or vapor production of a build of course.
Canadian_ecigarette,3d1fqu,tommytw0time,2,Mon Jul 13 12:35:46 2015 UTC,Be honest in all evaluations of the gear/liquid. Many reviewers are clearly protecting relationships while reviewing hardware and it comes across like an infomercial. Being Clear and concise is also important. Research and be informed while you speak.
Canadian_ecigarette,3d1fqu,obzilla,2,Mon Jul 13 12:58:26 2015 UTC,"An articulate person that can concisely address the continent while being him or herself, and ideally slightly entertaining without being gimmicky.  Attention to detail but not minutia. A run down of features and settings without breaking out the oscilloscopes.   A solid opinion of the item up for review, done in about 10-15 minutes maximum. The less time spent advertising how cool you are, the cooler you really are.  Themed hip music intro and other pizzazz reduced to 5 seconds.  It's a tall order."
Canadian_ecigarette,3d1fqu,greekdude1821,2,Mon Jul 13 13:06:14 2015 UTC,"Unboxing is useless and pretty much every reviewer does it just to fill up time.  I would just like to see a concise breakdown, rebuild (if applicable), filling and stress tests.  As for juice reviews, since taste is subjective I never trust them.  I have yet to buy juice based on recommendation of a review, nor do I know anyone who has.  Advocacy is another big thing that only a few reviewers do.  It may be boring to many, but as vapers we should be aware what is happening."

Canadian_ecigarette,3d1hn3,Winter_knights,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:05:33 2015 UTC,Have you tried cleaning the 510 connector with a bit of alcohol and a paper towel? The spring pin might be a bit stuck. The fluctuating sounds like it's not making a good connection I've had that happen with my RDAs when the pin becomes recessed in the RDA but with your tank it protrudes pretty decent so try cleaning the 510 on the M80 with a bit of rubbing alcohol or vodka on a qtip or bit or paper towel.
Canadian_ecigarette,3d1hn3,dragnaros,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:06:50 2015 UTC,Ok I'll try that. The 510 on the mod does actually looks little tarnished. Thanks!

Canadian_ecigarette,3d1hn3,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:30 2015 UTC,try playing with the pin inside with a screwdriver by pushing it down and letting it pop up a few times see if there's something gunked in there. make sure you dont press the fire button while doing that.

Canadian_ecigarette,3czrut,demon1102,2,Sun Jul 12 07:31:05 2015 UTC,"The in store warranty is usually there only as a protection from a device that causes immediate problem and fails to work. Since most problems that were manufacturer related will typically show themselves in a short amount of time, 30 days is the norm.   If you buy something that doesn't work, you have 30 days to return/exchange without having to deal with the manufacturer directly. This keeps the customers happy, since most devices are fine and the exchange usually solves their issue.  After seeing how hard it was to deal with Kangertech if you don't live in the USA, I'm glad that the shop I work in has  changed over to a 6 month warranty to protect against manufacturer defects.   If you're having such a problem with the M65, I'd suggest checking your product to ensure its not a clone, and then taking the matter up with their customer service."

Within 3 months from shipment: Upon returning, defective items are replaced and shipped back to customers for free. Return shipping reimbursement is USD 40 or 50% of the item's price, whichever is lower.  Within 6 months from shipment: Upon returning, defective items are replaced and shipped back to customers for free. Return shipping reimbursement is unavailable.  Afterwards: Customers may still send defective items back to FastTech. FastTech passes those items back to their manufactures and helps coordinating the repair. Customers are responsible for shipping charges both ways.  Depending on the problem, fees may be assessed by the manufacturers. FastTech will contact customers before committing the repairs."

So by the word of the law you could kick up dust and get a refund. The M65 has attractive specs but is a horrible piece of crap irl.   I would count it as a loss and learn from that mistake, instead of buying marked up chinese crap in a b&m only to get fucked when something goes south, just order the chinese crap from china and throw it out if it poop the bed."

Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,FlamingDragonSS,6,Sun Jul 12 04:45:48 2015 UTC,"Personal opinion on the best bang for the buck sub-ohm tanks are the Horizon Arctic and Freemax Starre. If you're looking for amazing vapour production and flavour then that's what you should aim for. They are a warm vape though which is what some people don't like about them (personal preference).   Haven't experienced any leaks and such with both tanks and airflow on both of them is a beauty as well. The Arctic is .2ohm and .5 / Starre is .25ohm and .5.   New tanks are coming out though like the Aspire Triton, but they're going for $35+"

I own 4 originals (including a Mk2 with the two air vents), and for shits and giggles, I bought a clone to see what it was like (and it was only like $13 from FT). I also bought spare o-rings in green (I like green).  Well... what I noticed was this - the aftermarket o-rings were pretty crappy, and actually caused my never-before-leaked original Subtank to leak. The bottom one (the one in the base) was pretty bad and thin.   And... the aftermarket one - on top of bad workmanship (metal burrs on the inside exoskeleton of the Subtank), also had the same crappy seals. And it leaked too.  My original subtanks, with the original seals? Never once leaked with litres put through them by now ;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,Wilibus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:01:37 2015 UTC,I bought the Subtank minis from a retail store in Toronto. Pretty sure they're authentic. But like peeps have mentioned.. It's something I am doing wrong.
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,Chris1077,2,Mon Jul 13 02:43:45 2015 UTC,Check the scratch code
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,bubbzie,2,Mon Jul 13 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"Kanger products have a code on the box that you can use to check authenticity. In my experience, the Subtank doesn't leak normally, but some juice will get squeezed out between the base and jar when you close it, so I give it a quick wipe after filling.  Are you using the RDA or the pre-built coils? I recall having a bit of juice in the air holes when I first started using the RDA, but I think it was just me dripping too much juice on the coil while test-firing, because it's never happened again. Make sure your atomizer is screwed in tight."
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,dotvapes,3,Thu Jul 16 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"When I got my vape I was set on a subtank mini, mostly because of the rebuildable coils.    Dude at my B&M recommended I go with the Vapeston Maganus instead because it wasn't as leaky and had better flavour.  Personally I have never tried the subtank mini but I am super impressed with my Maganus.  I run it with the 0.2Ω and the tank holds enough juice for me to vape all day.  The coil says it's rated for 20w-150w.  On my Sigelei 150w I haven't been past 70w since that fogged me completely out.  I usually vape at around 35w-50w and that creates clouds large enough to fill the entire cab of my truck (F150 crewcab) after about 3-4 hits."
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,dotvapes,3,Sun Jul 12 12:23:39 2015 UTC,I would suggest the freemax starre. I had the subtank mini and haven't gone back since my starre arrived. And you can use the atlantis temp coils in it with the snowwolf. Other than that the Smowell Hatrick looks very cool.
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,Beardharmonica,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:33:28 2015 UTC,Freemax and sense both have ni200 coils that will work in the starre. I haven't tried them yet but they do exist

The snowwolf 200 is an awesome device, and I have access to them if you would like one at a bit of a price cut ;)   Just give me a shout!  Cheers :)  DTV_John"
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,KernicPanel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah...really excited about snow wolf. But I hear it's not worth getting if you're only gonna run tanks or maybe I misunderstand it. I am sure I heard it on YouTube somewhere, where the guy says that if you really want to take advantage of a 150+ watt device, you want to go the rda route."
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,singalong777,2,Sun Jul 12 05:49:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say the snowwolf is most effective up to 150W, after which it switches into a pulse mode.   There are some tanks that can abuse the 70-80 range, but yes, even for myself, I never pass 120 or so (and that's only with 1 dripper I have).  I strongly recommend grabbing a dripper as well :) I think you'll enjoy it with the added power!"

Refillable from the top, hold more juice than the subtank-mini, dual-coil rba possibility, massive airflow, runs the stock 0.3ohms at ~40 watts and the flavor is fantastic.  Before buying mine I was rotating between two subtanks mini.  As for the leaks, my minis leaked but only in extreme weather (-20c or 32c). Most probably because of the expansion and contraction of the o-rings."
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,scabertrain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:11:54 2015 UTC,do you build coils for the Zephyrus? i find the stock coils are not the greatest in terms of flavor. I am comparing to my Freemax as well.
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,singalong777,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:05:32 2015 UTC,The stock 0.3 coils have been giving me tremendous flavor. I found the RBA to be more muted in terms of flavor. The juice channels are a lot bigger on the stock coils.
Canadian_ecigarette,3czh7y,DazVape,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"hmm, maybe i'll give it a try again. I compared the stock .3 coils on the zeph with my .5 coils on the freemax starre.

As for the batteries, all 26650s you're going G to find today are re-wraps. The Efest Green 4200 is decent (same cell as all the other 4200 re-wraps. It's around 20A continuous, though at that range it will definitely warm up a bit while chain vaping. If you want maximum power you need to go 18650."

Stupidly I figured there would be higher capacity and higher amp rated 26650s on the market than 18650s. noope  Any idea if you can buy tubes to use an 18650 in a 26650/26mm ID mech mod?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cwpl6,karmapopsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:09:36 2015 UTC,Indeed you can. They're just plastic spacer tubes.

Canadian_ecigarette,3cwpl6,RobertDF902,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:33:28 2015 UTC,Here's one in Canada. They're usually called 18650 to 26650 adapter or tube.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cwpl6,karmapopsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"These things scare me. The tubes aren't vented and IMO keep the battery hotter during use since it kind of insulates the battery from the tube which doubles as a heatsink. If you wanna run 18650 batteries, get an 18650 mech."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cwpl6,RobertDF902,2,Sun Jul 12 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"There's an alternate argument there that if your batteries are heating up enough to require the tube to provide heat dissipation, you should probably be building higher or get better batteries.   Or just go regulated."

You could use quite a large bit. That would help with heat dissipation.  /u/karmapopsicle is spot on with his argument though. Your batteries should never be getting hot enough to worry about it."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cwpl6,ljmesg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"Hit me in a few days and I'll post a review or at least let you know personally. I just got my IPV3 LI so I've pretty much been going nuts with that for the last couple days lol.   First impressions of it though, as I've used it for a couple hours. Love the look of it. Very sleek. Some don't like the dimpled bits on the side but I think it looks nice. Even with 22mm atties on there it looks really nice. Ventilation - plenty of it, both for the battery and atty. The switch is magnetic and is plenty powerful and will not fire under its own weight. Some mods have problems where if you put a large/heavy atty on it will fire, not this one. I haven't tested the tolerance of the button but it feels like it requires ~1 pound of pressure.  Wouldn't recommend it to absolute beginner vapers (due to the complications with battery safety/safe use, rebuilding and wicking coils, ohms law, buying and using RDAs etc) but if you feel comfortable which each of the things I just mentioned then go for it! I think it's a nice first mod, I'm very happy with it.    Obligatory Fuck Ameravape"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cuwrv,GreatBigPig,5,Fri Jul 10 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/GreatBigPig!  First of all, welcome to the world of vaping!   Posts here can never be too long, if you don't have access to a good local shop it's communities like this subreddit and other forums that act as the main resource for answers and guidance.   E-Cigarettes small enough to be mistaken for cigarettes are called 'cigalikes' and typically favor aesthetic over function. So while in an ideal world a small futuristic cigarette that billows nice clouds of vapor would be amazing in reality it just means they have small batteries that run out quickly and don't provide enough power to satisfy the average person. :(  The biggest advice I can give you is to find a device with the ability to charge it as you use it (referred to as pass-thru charging) to retain battery life, or having a backup battery to charge while you're using one. So something like the EVOD kit is great for a newcomer or an iStick 30W or similar pass-through capable battery paired with an atomizer like the Nautilus Mini. Both of these setups I would recommend as they have good cost to value ratio and would fit nicely within your budget. As a bit of a shameless plug any starter kit bought from us comes with some free liquid so you don't have to worry about having to add that on top of other purchases to get up and going.  If you are interested in producing bigger clouds and might have a knack in the future for rebuilding, I'd suggest pairing the iStick 30W with the Subtank Mini as you'll have the ability to learn how to rebuild your coils, but can just replace the coils with pre-packaged ones until then. That way you won't have to invest again in the future just to learn if you end up becoming an enthusiast.   Nicotine is wildly available as it isn't enforced, just deemed illegal by Health Canada. I wouldn't expect this to change overnight so you should be fine with getting the value out of a setup :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cuwrv,HeyCarpy,2,Sat Jul 11 00:30:37 2015 UTC,"I will echo what /u/CuBu said and tell you to avoid the kits that you posted. You won't get decent clouds or good flavour out of anything pen-shaped. The third one, the Aspire kit, has a decent tank and the mod is ok, but you can do better in your price range.  Like anything else in life, you get what you pay for (unfortunately). Good thing for you is that you can get a soild, versatile setup for around $100.  I'm less than a year into the game, but let me tell you that you catch on to this pretty quick. With that in mind, I would recommend the Kanger Subtank Mini as your tank. This thing does it all for a beginner and I can't recommend it enough. It's ready to go with pre-built replacement coils once you take it out of the box, and includes everything to get into building your own eventually - which I also highly recommend.   As far as a good mod, there are lots out there and I'll leave that suggestion up to someone else as I'm currently rocking an iStick 50w, and I'm pretty sure everyone will tell you to avoid it (although it's given me no problems 3 months in).

The rabbit hole of a hobby runs deep so to save money look for something with a bit more power.   I made that mistake myself. Started on Ego style batteries, then a month later had an 11 watt box in my hand. Which wasn't enough and I dove into mechanicals.   Devices these days you don't have to go to mechanicals, almost any 40-75 watt device will be more than enough to grow into."

As u\vapornorth said, the nice thing about the Subtank mini is that it comes with a couple of prebuilt coils you can use until you get your building Kung Fu down.   I have an iStick 30w. While it's not amazing in any way, it does the job for a decent price.   Everything should come out to pretty much $100 or so. Good luck!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cuwrv,Winter_knights,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:11:21 2015 UTC,Okay seems like all these people are suggesting the pen style vapes. You won't get the vapor you want from those. At all. And don't get the isticks they suck.   Subox kit would be best if you want vapor.   If you don't want a kit get a nice battery like a sigelei 100 or 150. It's great. Then get a good subohm tank like a arctic or Atlantis v2 or freemax starre. Huge clouds. Lots of flavour. That battery will be able to handle any type of mod you want. In the last four months I've tried three different battery types and from my experience you don't want built in batteries because when they die you'll be vaping with a usb cord attached. And half the people say don't vape while charging and don't charge while asleep. So what you gonna do for the five hours it takes to charge it. Get a mod that the battery can be externally charged and have back up set and you'll never be without a vape.

Canadian_ecigarette,3cv7a9,VaporNorth,2,Sat Jul 11 19:30:36 2015 UTC,This. It's simply not marketed though because of the lack of interest in 100% pg juices. But from my understanding they're a breeze to mix.

Canadian_ecigarette,3ctpr9,iiiCronos,2,Fri Jul 10 18:21:02 2015 UTC,"I had that exact setup, and still use it on occasion but I have a few new ones now. My favorite would be the freemax starre tank with the IPV Mini 2. The IPV mini 2 is nice since it can go up to 70 watts. Only downside is that at higher watts, the battery will die on you quicker.  I also just picked up the Evic temp control mod from Joytech. The tank isn't that great, but you can get the subtank and use the OCC nickel coils. 5000 MAH battery and you can run 3 modes, NI, TI and VW.  I like my Atlantis V2 tank as well, running it with .3 coils at 60 to 70 wll get you a nice warm vape, no warm hits as it can go higher."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ctpr9,singalong777,2,Fri Jul 10 19:59:34 2015 UTC,To add! You can even use your delta they make both nickel and titanium coils for that that will go on the evic nicely
Canadian_ecigarette,3ctpr9,CuBu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:18:33 2015 UTC,I will second the Freemax Starre. Its a great tank and the coils are the best I have used to date. 4 big juice holes and Ive yet to get a dry hit between 50-60 Watts. Flavor is great and clouds are the best from a tank I've used. I'm currently using it on my Smok xpro M80 for my work setup. Hasn't let me down yet! Good luck!
Canadian_ecigarette,3ctpr9,Swelton,2,Fri Jul 10 20:07:14 2015 UTC,Sigelei sigelei sigelei.  Proven to be safe and durable as hell. Get the 100 or 150 w... or wait a bit and pickup a new temp Control one when it comes out.

Canadian_ecigarette,3crzf2,extremethickness,2,Sat Jul 11 06:16:22 2015 UTC,"Just food for thought: I know that many consider a gap between their RDA and mod to be the worst thing in the world, or at least an ugly aesthetic, but from a pure functionality standpoint it's a great thing. Exposing the bottom of the RDA to air and having a smaller central area of connection means that heat can dissipate easier, and less heat is being transferred to your mod. This means less stress (over time) on the solder points under the connection, or for mechs less heat reaching your battery. For this reason I actually prefer a 1mm gap when using RDAs or tanks that get quite hot.  More on point to your actual question, look for RDAs whose connection pin has a slot for a flat screwdriver. The vast majority that have that can be adjusted. Be careful with mods that have a wide center pin, as if you shorten the pin on the atomizer it's possible to cause a short circuit in some cases, resulting in it just not working, or worst case burning it out (if protection fails, or it's a mech)."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cstsb,Toxyoi,4,Fri Jul 10 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"East Coast Vape is my usual recommendation for cheap but vapeable juice (from their regular line). $9.99 for 30ml, $16.99 for 50ml, or $29.99 for 100ml.  I think it's definitely worth trying some stuff from their ECV Premium Mix line as well. Highly recommend Ultimate Waffle. Cost is a couple bucks more than the basic line at $12.50 for 30ml, $19.99 for 50ml, and $34.99 for 100ml.  Everything gets mixed fresh to order, so you'll want to let most of the premium flavours steep for a week or so. Basic fruity flavours are often pretty fine right away.   And on a final note, if you're really concerned about cutting longer term vaping costs down as much as possible, I highly recommend looking into DIY. You can go as simple as stretching juice you like by ordering it in double nic with a flavour shot then diluting it down 50/50 with VG, or pick up some bottles/syringes/flavours/nic/VG/PG and mix up some simple stuff yourself."

Different form factor, and built in battery versus 18650.  But it's also cheaper, and the temp control works very well (and also supports titanium though I haven't tried that yet).  I have the (way too expensive) SX mini m class... Which I love and use.  I grabbed the Evic as a 2nd device and have used it daily ever since.  (I switch tanks/flavours often so I just run different types tanks on each through the day.)  As of right now, I think the Evic is easily the best temperature control device at that price point.    If you really want the 18650, or there is something particular about the DNA board that you are after, I'd only heard positive things about the HCIGAR mod."

Some reviewers have given it favorable reviews and compared to the older HB40 they made it more solid, and better looking. EDIT One thing to keep in mind the new DNA200 and even the Dicodes chipset from Germany can be programmed for different coefficients of resistance, which means you can use temp control with wires other than Nickel and Titanium."
Canadian_ecigarette,3csl4f,ry4life,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:15:32 2015 UTC,Honestly I found that the Geeko clone chips work just as well as the authentic DNA40s. The SXK or Zero Clone is a great option from Fasttech. Cheap and worth testing versus buying something authentic and hating it. The VT40 is a beautiful unit though!
Canadian_ecigarette,3csl4f,SlovenianSocket,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:57:10 2015 UTC,I have the heartbeat dna40 Hcigar box and it's awesome ..compact and works perfect . I'm sure the new one is great .

Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,demon1102,2,Thu Jul 9 22:10:29 2015 UTC,I bought a litre of this stuff a few months ago. I packed it up in 50 ml bottles.  It's still looking just as nice as the day I got it. I have a bottle outside and the remainder inside the freezer. Very nice nic. I like it a lot.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,beekermc,2,Thu Jul 9 23:56:12 2015 UTC,Been using these guys for a while now. Haven't had any issues. Would definitely recommend.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,Adolph_Bernanke,2,Fri Jul 10 00:15:32 2015 UTC,"I had a bad bottle from them, but it was the 120ml size. I wonder if it was just an old bottle or had a problem with it's seal resulting in oxidation.   The 120ml I got was unusable even as low as 2mg you could taste it strongly.   Good to see most have had better experience with it than me."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,tet5uo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:14:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that. I was a little worried as I have never ordered from them before and ordered a whole liter, but it turned out great."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,tet5uo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:26:41 2015 UTC,At least i only got a small bottle. I probably should have contacted them about it.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"I'm also looking to start making juice, wondering why you guys decide to purchase Nicotine in solution rather than pure? Just for ease of dilution/volumetric measuring?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,beekermc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:09:19 2015 UTC,Don't mess with pure nic. Just don't.  It's very hazardous and any skin contact will kill you slowly and painfully.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,HalifaxVapist,2,Fri Jul 10 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I do appreciate it. I have experience handling substances which are active in sub-miligram doses, as well as plenty of chemistry knowledge and extractions under my belt. I'd be alright. But for the layman you're correct and I bet that's why it's mainly available in solution. Hadn't even crossed my mind that handling hazardous chemicals wasn't a normal thing lol"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,therealdrg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:42:13 2015 UTC,"You need a fume hood or even opening the bottle inside will kill you. To work with pure nic you need a full lab pretty much. If you have one, go for it. Most people dont, which is why its not popular."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cpzxo,HalifaxVapist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:10:21 2015 UTC,"Nah I totally get it, blonde moment. Still good to say though, so hopefully no one gets a bright idea and stupidly orders some chinese nic and kill themselves with it."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cq8zm,JoytechThrowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"Blue Sky, Bitch reminds me of blue Livewires. Nevermore is an apple fritter flavour with a lot of cinnamon (my favorite Evaperated Juice by far), Achocolypse now is a banana chocolate flavour but I've never tried it, and I can't remember Hannibal Nectar or Cloud 69's profiles but I've tried both and they're pretty good"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cq733,Ecigz_Mission,9,Thu Jul 9 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"Hey! I have a few tips just based on my years of experience in retail as well as being a frequent vape shop customer.   Actively enforce the age restriction. Don't be one of the shops that will ruin it for everyone. Have gear and juice that covers both ends of the spectrum (beginners that just need simple devices and basic juices to advanced users that rebuild, DIY, etc) Try to keep elitism to a minimum, I can't tell you how many shops I have left and never returned because some dickhead employee turned his nose up at the poor old lady with an eGo vape while he took deep lung hit off his mech and fogged her right out of the store. Provincial laws still vary, but if you're in a place that allows vaping inside, don't completely fog it out. I love a good cloud sesh as much as the next guy but it's really off-putting and overwhelming to customers when they walk in to a hotbox. Also really unprofessional. Fair pricing, most people will pay a little extra to have what they want NOW and support local instead of ordering online. But they won't if you gouge them. Compare pricing with your competition and actually BE competitive. Stay with the times! There's a few shops around that just never really evolved with the industry, and it will ultimately be the downfall of those shops. The ""subculture"" is growing every day at an exponential rate. More and more people want new and exciting mods and juice etc. They will go to the shops that have the latest and greatest. Engage your customers. Ask them how they got started, what they like/dislike, how they found out about vaping, how they found out about your shop. These are key metrics in this ever changing industry. Be friendly to EVERYONE. Word of mouth is really the main driving force behind this industry. If you get a bad reputation you may as well just close up - it's awfully hard to come back from that. Be professional. Keep a clean shop. Keep your shelves full. This is a business and should be treated like any other business.   I hope you have great success!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cq733,RobertDF902,3,Fri Jul 10 00:16:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for these tips! You have put a lot of detail in to them and it is awesome.  We have pretty fair pricing, we try to sell things at the lowest cost in town (two other vape shops) and we are working on trying to bring in more product. With the 19+ thing, we are already strictly endorsing this rule and asking for ID at the door. Right now we are working on varying our product as we only opened a month ago and are trying to get our names out there. It is hard to get recognition when there are already some established vape shops around, but we have managed to gain a few regulars!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cqv8m,subievape,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:03:56 2015 UTC,Thanks. Considered this mod but I'd like a floating 510.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cqv8m,karmapopsicle,2,Fri Jul 10 02:39:55 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard Kanger started shipping out spring loaded units on July 7th. I know a couple of our Chinese suppliers have pre-orders on Subox stock, which usually means there was a break in production and new stock is coming in. Same thing with the eVic VTs.   Since I'm here though, I'll just add a couple thoughts towards your original question. First, the Sigelei 50w VR2 is simply a rock solid device. Built very well, and using a tried and true chip (same SX330 V2 board that powered the IPV2). The main point to consider on the Sig is that the board is boost only, which means it will only ever output battery voltage and up. This works out just fine for a lot of people, but I highly recommend looking at what resistances you're vaping at what wattages to figure out if you need buck/step-down at all. For example if you like to run a tank like the Arctic with the 0.2ohm heads at 40w, you'll be stuck at ~60+w using the Sig (yes it will output higher than the rated 50w due to the 0.2ohm resistance limit).  The Sigelei 75w looks like it could be another great device like the 50w VR2, and at a cheaper price point, but I would absolutely wait on reviews before buying one."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cqv8m,VanGoVapes,2,Fri Jul 10 02:40:20 2015 UTC,The IPV 4 is the only PY4U mod that seems to have major issues. All the reviews of the IPV mini 2 are decent thus far. The most glaring issue is the paint job. For the price it's worth the gamble to me.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cqv8m,anxdiety,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:44:39 2015 UTC,"I have owned an IPV Mini 2 for many months and it's a fantastic machine. Same with the IPV3 LI, although it hasn't withstood the test of time yet. Problems with the 4 were mainly their charging board, which you should be using an external charger anyways. As long as you get your P4U product from a reputable vendor you'll be square. I couldn't recommend my IPV Mini II or IPV3 LI (If you need/want temp control) enough."

And as for the people who are ""threatening"" to go back to smoking if they don't have those specific juices-- that's a pretty shitty thing to put on you, as well as being extremely childish. They're most likely joking... or not adults."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,n-senada,4,Thu Jul 9 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"100% agree with this.   This is why I'm for smart (not dumb) government regulations so vendors don't have to worry about ""I don't want to sell x, but if I don't my customers will go elsewhere to get it.""   When an industry is regulated you can simply make it so no one can sell something that shouldn't be sold."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,lilfunky1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:08:27 2015 UTC,Personally I voted to keep it with being informed. It's shitty that people are putting it on Sadie with threats but for some finding an all day vape is extremely challenging.   If I have to search for a new ADV it may or not be from Evaperated. Right now I'm leaning towards diy so I can avoid the bullshit and make my own that satisfies me.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,anxdiety,2,Thu Jul 9 04:49:17 2015 UTC,"I love how honest you are! I haven't ordered from you for awhile, I think I need to fix that!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,castlite,2,Thu Jul 9 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"My two cents.. I have ordered all of these flavours in the past, and enjoy them. Although glad you are pulling them until you reformat them.  I for one do not always read descriptions on websites so even if there was a disclaimer not everyone reads them.  And some may not care, but I do not think people truly understand the risks of what high levels of those chemicals can do. Good on you for getting your juice tested and pulling those that do not meet ECTA standards. Love your products, and your customer service.. Pulling these shows you care about your customers, and I'm sure you will bring out something new that will be better than the original."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,ldc26,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input!    Just wanted to point out that if we do end up deciding to keep the first versions available in some way, there would be a manditory box that would need to be checked with very obvious words like ""WARNING:  READ THIS BEFORE PUTTING THIS IN YOUR CART"" followed by the disclosure.    If we do go down this route it's imperative that it's done in a way that forces people to read it.  The main itch that people have with all of this is that none of the levels we as juice makers have to follow on any level, are based off of science or anything concrete.  the majority seem to prefer to wait for science to give us more answers and more proof.  On the other hand, there are a ton of people that wish to vape as little as possible, always, regardless of science, based on the fact they don't wish to inhale anything unnecessary.  That's why I'm trying to take my time here and get as much feedback as I can.  I've always been curious how the community really feels about all of this, and this was a great opportunity to weigh in on it with everyone.  I'm nowhere near making a decision yet, other than the ones I've already made, which is to reformat all flavors that don't meet ECTA standards so that -every- customer can vape how they want in the event that I do make the first versions available and there are those that want an ECTA passed flavor only.  If I don't make the first versions available in my final decision, those that would be unhappy with that choice will hopefully fall in love with the new versions.  The other option I'm considering is making the first versions available UNTIL I've got the reformatted versions available, and then pulling the first versions completely at that point.  Three ways to go here, and I'm not close to choosing any of them lol."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,CAVaper,2,Thu Jul 9 16:58:02 2015 UTC,This is slightly unrelated but is selling unsweetened versions of your flavours an option? I love your products but I find my atomiser gets gunked up really quickly and I am more concerned health wise over vaping sweetener than I am with Diacetyl.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,MaddogBC,3,Fri Jul 10 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"I personally believe this all to be a witchhunt. There will never be a 100% ""safe"" ejuice. I have yet to see any real information to even suggest these particular chemicals are going to be damaging in these trace amounts. I smoked all kinds of diacetyl for 30 years and I find it pretty ludicrous that folks who don't vape are waggling their finger at me for it now.  I vape a few mls combined of these flavours at most in a day. The amounts in question here are simply not worth all the fuss. If you're a 30 ml a day guy of the sweetest mix you can find well I'm sorry, your levels of excess are going to kill you someday. I'd bet a paycheque it won't say diacetyl on the report...  Mana Biscuit is literally the rock on which my vaping foundation is built. I realized the day I dripped it that giving up tobacco was realistic. I didn't think I liked dessert vapes before MB...  LEAVE MANA BISCUIT ALONE!!!   ;)  PS I'm Sadies #1 fanboy and already explained this via a SKY IS FALLING panicky email... I think it's exemplary of her to place so much importance on this. Few vendors anywhere care about their customers as much as Evaperated does. This truly is the standard that should define the word ""premium"" in this market IMO.  Thanks Sadie!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,on_a_moose,2,Thu Jul 9 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"I've never tried your brand, but I would say to support your customers as long as they're making an informed decision. Full disclosure of your findings published on the pages where they can buy the juice is more than sufficient in my opinion.  As for reformulating, if it's something you want to do, it's fine. Just keep in mind that butyric acid is horrible, vile stuff. Many people are very sensitive to it, and the threshold between a ""useful"" (I was going to say ""pleasant"" but I just can't) note and the smell of puke is different for different people. Most ""v2"" flavourings substitute butyric acid for diacetyl or acetyl propionyl. Most reviews of those flavourings that I've read are quite negative, and I can't disagree personally.  As an aside, I find these ECTA ""standards"" and requirements to be premature and unhelpful to the community. I know of no actual science behind their various thresholds for diketones in juice, nor any evidence that those thresholds actually help to protect anyone from... anything. It really looks like they pulled some nice round numbers and said ""oh, that looks good"", and that was that. Considering that diketones haven't even been brought up as an issue in the last draft of proposed legislation I read (which was a while ago, so correct me if that has changed), it seems we have a trade organization trying to police something that even Health Canada hasn't touched.  I have serious doubts about ECTA."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,anxdiety,2,Thu Jul 9 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"I completely agree on ECTA jumping the shark and feeding the regulation freaks. As I've called it in the past ""Food for the feds"". It falls completely within the same thoughts as the hippocratic things like ""It's not tobacco"" but ""Don't vape where you wouldn't smoke""."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,DonJulioTO,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:32:28 2015 UTC,"I agree in general,  but you can't say ""the legislators don't even say anything about this"" and still say ""the legislators have no idea what they're talking about."" It's disingenuous. You can't use an ignorant bunch of lobbyist-influenced politicians to support your statement."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,on_a_moose,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:57:10 2015 UTC,"Of course I can. Regardless of the level of incompetency or corruption in our legislature, they are ultimately the power that we have to answer to. I'd also note that I didn't comment on the competency of anyone but ECTA in the above post, so you are projecting your opinion of the legislature onto what I said.  There are two main possibilities I see for the reason that diketones haven't come up in the proposed legislation. It could be one, both, or something else, but hear me out.   Inclusion of diacetyl in e-cig regulation might create pressure to examine it in conventional tobacco products, which would be a threat to big tobacco if it received the same level of alarmism and panic as in the e-cig community. When one considers that cigarette smoke contains a hundred times more diacetyl than vapour from a juice make with a ""normal"" amount of diacetyl containing flavourings, one can see how this would be very bad PR at a time when tobacco companies are already losing ground in many countries. There is simply no science to back up the claim that the quantities of diketones in our juices are dangerous. This seems the most likely to me. We have people who have been vaping since ~2008, starting out with god knows what in their juice from before flavouring companies started to adapt, and even with all of that I have yet to hear of a single verified case of lung injury as a result of vaping. Health Canada and the legislature shouldn't, mustn't be creating regulations about as yet imagined threats, so until we have better evidence that the levels of these chemicals in our juices are dangerous, they're doing the right thing to ignore it (for once)."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,MaddogBC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:26:02 2015 UTC,"Give this man a cigar flavoured juice, he understands that ECTA has no business setting ""standards"" that our health professionals can't agree on.

Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,SpeshulSnoflake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:35:32 2015 UTC,"I believe that the reformulation for those that want to avoid as much harm as possible definitely makes sense, but for those people who are aware of the test results but still consider it harm-reduction over smoking, should have the option.   The first thing that some to mind is flavouring companies. I believe it was Capella who had their Vanilla Custard test high for diketones and reformulated it to replace them (I think someone mentioned with buteric acid?)  and launched that as a Version 2 but they still keep Version 1 available.   I think this would be the best bet. Promote the version 2 on the site but maybe have a link from the flavour to "" Version 1""  and have a separate product page with more information and warnings.   Just my 2 cents :)"

Any that come back failed as these three have will go through this process though, and our customers will be informed.  We didn't want to wait for our 20 tested flavors to be done before we made customers aware as that's not cool.  So if it's still available on site we either haven't tested it yet, or it passed :)"

The thresholds themselves are somewhat arbitrary to prevent long-term health issues versus an acute one such as e-coli contamination, so I don't see an extra few weeks or months making a difference personally.

I believe a warning should suffice. I for one prefer juices that contain DA/AP.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cm4rr,Jack_Lad,0,Fri Jul 10 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"I'd rather you re-formulate everything to true MAXVG and not 60%~ VG, and no more sweeteners.

Canadian_ecigarette,3cmbh9,IridiumForte,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"Damn, I got antsy and ordered the Kanger Evod starter kit from mtbakervapor.com like 20 minutes ago haha... After a little research it seems like a decent choice for starters, you agree? Got a nice 25%off and a free bottle of eliquid. I think I might still head up to VaporNorth just to check it out and get a hand setting up my vape when it arrives, as well as try some other flavors.   Any other tips for a newbie?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cmbh9,giraffebacon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:27:16 2015 UTC,Importing juice from the states is technically illegal & some shipments get sent back to the sender by Canadian Customs. Most shipments get through but its a roll of the dice every time you order. Hopefully that free bottle of juice doesn't get your shipment returned.   If you need advice about using your gear you should consider buying from a local Vape shop instead of online. It might cost a couple bucks more but the advice and knowledge you get is well worth it.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cmbh9,Robbie-R,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"Shit, thanks for the heads up. I'll definitely head down to the closest vapor shop tomorrow for some tips and tricks.   Any advice on legal cheap juice in Canada?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cmbh9,giraffebacon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"All juice with nicotine is ""technically"" illegal in Canada, but it has never been enforced. Canada Customs is the only law enforcement agency in Canada that gives a shit about e-juice.  Its hard to recommend juice flavors because everyone is different. My advise is go to a local vape shop and sample some different flavors. There is tons of great juice flavors available in Canada. Many are house brands made locally. You can buy American Juice (Vape shops are importing it despite the fact that its illegal) Its more expensive and not necessarily better than Canadian Juice."

You will see Roxy Market Smoke and Vape shop on google (Hurontario and Confederation) and they have great hours since they are inside a convenience store. Set up is much better than expected, and the staff are friendly and willing to let you sample tons of flavours. They will be moving to a completely separated vape shop in the back of the store soon. They carry brands like Dr. Fog, Worlds best Custard, Yogen Fog, Milkman, Moshi, Spacejam, Mr. Goodvape and a few other basic lines of ejuice. They don't have RDA's, but a good selection of juices, tanks, batteries at a decent price. They sold my friend a Subtank Mini for 30 flat because the Zephurys tank he bought from them seized together. Wouldn't take the return, but sold him a second tank for a dirt cheap price to keep him happy which was really cool."

I'm pleased to see a review of her shop on here, as she really deserves the attention. I'd credit her with some of the success of my initial transition from smoking to vaping, just by way of being so helpful in getting me started with my first order. She really cares about seeing people quit, which is awesome in an industry whose appeal is so often just making money.  I've had numerous dealings with her since then and it has always been pleasant. The one time there was a minor mistake with an order she sent out a replacement of the item right away, telling me to keep the item I received as well. Before I got into DIY I enjoyed her line of e-juice as well. It's all good stuff.  As far as ratio goes, you can request any ratio you like in the order notes and she's happy to mix to it. Next time I'm talking to her I'll remind her that it should be on the product pages though."

It sucks that it has a bad board but they'll likely replace it with a version 5 with atty lock.   There were a couple of errors in your description. It was made by Steam Crave, not Hcigar. And the dna40 board does have reverse battery protection, you could put one or both battery's in backwards and it would be fine but if you put one in correctly and one in backwards that would cause a hard short in the batteries. That could be very bad. That's not the fault of the mod, all the two battery dna40's work this way.   It's a nice solid box that looks easy to upgrade and as you said, it's quite heavy, personally I like that but not everyone will. It would be a lot more comfortable with a skin though."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,lilfunky1,5,Tue Jul 7 18:32:40 2015 UTC,I opened up a decaf only coffee shop next to my local Tim Hortons.  Gonna be pissin' hundies.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,demential,2,Wed Jul 8 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"I only vape 0mg juice, but I know I'm a minority. (albeit a growing minority)  As vaping gains popularity with non-smokers I feel the 0mg market will open up a bit more. As well, some people will switch to 0mg after getting down to 3mg and wanting off. Others will just quit vaping altogether if they feel they've killed off any addiction."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,AnarchoElk,3,Tue Jul 7 20:51:10 2015 UTC,0 mg will grow as the current boom of vapers work their way down to zero. Today's 6mg and 3mg will potentially become 0mg.   The problem is that they will have their favourite flavours locked down already.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,golden_rhino,2,Wed Jul 8 07:47:54 2015 UTC,"Happy Vaper is still around and they only started selling nic juice very recently. Not sure how ""successful"" they are though, guess it depends how you define it."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,Iamjmax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"No  PG and VG are easy to get. If you can't get Nicotine, you're best bet is to focus on a niche, such as really good (perhaps organic?) flavorings. Flavoring is the most important part of eLiquid. You can make a good living off of this niche."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,phantomseliquid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:50:19 2015 UTC,I'd say no.   But if you had amazing recipes that tasted great you could approach vendors who would add the nicotine in themselves. So you'd just sell large mixes of flavourant. But i don't see a lot of profit margin in that.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,joekerr37,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:45:28 2015 UTC,There are also a few large eliquid production labs in the country that will manufacture and distribute your liquid for you.

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,NATEMCWN,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:30:12 2015 UTC,The only brand I know of who sells ONLY 0 nic is http://vapesnack.com/
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,greekdude1821,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:26:12 2015 UTC,Honestly people might not agree with me but you buy nic juice because your addicted to it. Its the same as every other drug out there. Everyones just chasing the high (nic). Its like a coffee shop. coffee wouldn't be successful without the addicting part of caffeine.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,justalittleoff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"I guess it would depend. I'f you're selling it as a ""partial"" base sort of thing with all flavorings already done. If might appeal to a B$M but realistically that market would not be large enough to make decent coin from. The ratio of vapers that use 0nicVs nic would be low."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,Lampburglar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:46:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, I just stepped into the world of RDAs a few days ago, and the amount I vape has increased... tenfold.  I picked up my first 0mg juice yesterday because I think I got a little nicotine sick from Vaping so much 6mg the first day, and I'm considering getting more so I can just vape all day!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,Rew4Star,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:11:32 2015 UTC,If they only solg 0mg?  probably not.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,VoralisQ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:08:41 2015 UTC,no. I've personally only sold about 4 bottles of 0 nic juice ever.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgel1,Vendeta44,0,Tue Jul 7 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"Well your initial set up cost would be much lower than the average juice maker. Nicotine isn't cheap. So that being said, you could have slightly lower costs than the next guy which might help boost your business but I don't think it would be quite enough to make it a thriving business. Maybe a side job? But then again, I haven't looked into it too much but I'm seriously considering it"

Buying them in Canada would have been 10-15 bucks per battery, no thanks. Worst thing about Canada retailers is trying to take advantage of naive consumers for some things."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ch6dx,karmapopsicle,3,Wed Jul 8 08:51:12 2015 UTC,"Most vape shops don't have great prices on batteries, but it's not about preying on consumers, it's about making enough money to stay in business. Margins on  a lot of hardware are slim.   That said, Canvape has 25Rs for $7CAD/ea, which will be cheaper than any American site."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ch6dx,joshuaauger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:12:51 2015 UTC,Depends on volume as Illumn.com with shipping was about the same price per battery as canvape but I do believe if you order more batteries Illumn might be cheaper as the shipping gets cheaper.
Canadian_ecigarette,3ch6dx,karmapopsicle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Shipping goes up at Illumn with larger orders, since all of the shipping prices are live estimates based on weight/size. Canvape is free after $150 as well. Also important is that past $100 or so you'll get dinged with customs/duties/taxes at the border from the states."

Canadian_ecigarette,3ci447,kootenaygal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:51:58 2015 UTC,I'm kinda confused. How does this site work? Is it only open a couple times a year for orders? And is it all their own juice?   And how do they have like 600 flavours
Canadian_ecigarette,3ci447,jungleismassiv3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"Jugheads is a small mom and pop type operation. They are one of the early Canadian juice makers that offered nicotine options (dating back to when finding nicotine options involved having to request access to restricted lists on ECF).   Ordering (other than bulk) is restricted to certain announced times to allow them to handle demand (I don't know the full story but they have not sized up to accommodate and have faced some other difficulties). Even then they definitely still have a large following.   And yes, the flavour choices have always been insane.    Edit - And also yes, they make their own juice. They used to also sell Halo but have since stopped."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,lilfunky1,12,Tue Jul 7 19:55:35 2015 UTC,"If you pay the extra $2.50 (or what ever it is) you should get in within a week. I believe the shipping option is called ""e-packet"".I can say that my last order came to me in 5 days. This is as long as they have the product in stock (which it will tell you on the product page whether it is or not). I have a friend that recently got a subox from fasttech and it is completely authentic, you don't have to worry about that."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Hubatola,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:25:41 2015 UTC,What exactly does completely authentic mean?  That it was a perfect copy that performed the same or it was an actual authentic product that came from kangertech?
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Wilibus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:20:21 2015 UTC,"Actual authentic product. If it mentions ""styled"" in the product name, it's a clone."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Dervie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:55:39 2015 UTC,Cool.  I was under the impression the fasttech was a site dedicated to clones and generic supplies.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Wilibus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:10:13 2015 UTC,"They're known for their abundance of clones, but I'm assuming they're able to provide affordable authentics because they're located in China. Nonetheless, the items listed AUTHENTIC are real."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Dervie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:38:21 2015 UTC,What do you think I mean? Come on now.  That it IS a kanger product. A product that came from Kanger and made by Kanger. There are authentication methods to prove these things. (ie: authentication scratch code). It is widely known that Fasttech does sell AUTHENTIC Kanger prducts.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Adolph_Bernanke,2,Wed Jul 8 02:33:47 2015 UTC,They definitely sell authentic. I've checked the codes.  FYI everything comes from China these days so you may as well get the best price.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,kintyre,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:24:53 2015 UTC,"I just heard of fasttech a few days ago.  A lot of stuff coming from China that says authentic, frankly isn't.  I'm glad to hear this site is legit and clearly labels what is and isn't authentic."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Wilibus,3,Wed Jul 8 02:59:53 2015 UTC,"$65 plus $10 for shipping. Or if in the GTA you can pick it up for free at their flea market on the weekend: https://www.canvape.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=Subox  Canvape's customer service gets a lot of bad press but the trade off for that is very low prices. Depends on what you value more I guess. Personally I would spend a bit more for one of the other vendors listed here who have exceptional customer service (thevaporist, Dash)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Hubatola,2,Tue Jul 7 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"I got mine from Canvape just recently, took exactly a week to reach me in Manitoba. There should be a little notification that you can sign up for that alerts you via email when they come back in stock. I notice with the Black and Red model it doesn't take very long for them to get it back in stock. However for the White and Black model it never seemed to come up, so I finally emailed them, and they got back to me with something along the lines of they were having issues with that specific model but were planning to carry them once it resolved. Sure enough a few days later I managed to snag one of the black and white models."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,porcelainpulse,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:59:06 2015 UTC,"The white one was recalled due to chipping issues I believe, which is why it seems to be gone everywhere."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,karmapopsicle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:18:20 2015 UTC,I noticed them earlier but both colours are out of stock. I'm probably going to go with dash because I think they may have the best value and their e-juices sound amazing.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Hubatola,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:13:17 2015 UTC,"Aww you are correct, both out of stock. And great choice on selecting Dash!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Winter_knights,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"as long as it doesn't have batteries with it, it should ship just find with the epacket. If you order batteries it could take a very long time."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Winter_knights,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:00:45 2015 UTC,Lol yeah nope. Time is money. I'd pay extra from a B&M instead of that kind of wait. A week or two is fine. Anything more than a month ain't worth it.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Wilibus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:41:04 2015 UTC,"Why do batteries make a difference in shipping?  I'm in Regina, SK and I was considering ordering a velocity clone and some various RDA supplies like a coil jig, resistance tester, wire, etc.  Will e-packet really cut the shipping time down to a week?  Is there anything besides batteries to avoid to experience this wicked fast shipping?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,guntherslunt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:22:47 2015 UTC,Just make sure you get e-packet shipping. Everything from FT lands in BC and is pretty damn quick from there.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Wilibus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:35:15 2015 UTC,Sweet.  What do batteries have to do with e-packet shipping?

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,yoonique_sound,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"Of course fasttech will always be cheaper, just don't get too excited about that too often. You will want to look into the product forums in regards to certain products to see how they really are, especially if its something that has a million different versions listed on their site.   But $120 is nuts. I haven't seen it that high in Canada, just around the $88.99 mark. Where have you been looking?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,VaporChunks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:04:54 2015 UTC,I've only really looked at b&m's and some american vendors but I'm nervous about shipping from the states because I've heard stories about packages being seized at the border. I recently noticed the vaporist has it in stock and I may go with that.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,quazy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:59 2015 UTC,KangerTech has come out and said fasttech is NOT a confirmed redistributer. Watch out for fakes.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,TheVaporist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"im skeptical; there are probably some kanger fakes but fasttech is generally honest about authenticity and sometimes accidents happen. got one from gearbest and it's pretty darn genuine. ordered another for a friend from the vaporist and it's the same. his pricing on July 1 was so good, only 3 bucks more+tax than what i paid for the first from gearbest (ie straight from china like fasttech)!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Beardharmonica,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:37:48 2015 UTC,"If Fasttech says it's authentic...it's authentic.They simply don't buy direct from the source but from another distributor, so they don't have to respect the MSRP.

Canadian_ecigarette,3cgmva,Brown_eyed_pea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:55:47 2015 UTC,I honestly would just buy it from /u/thevaporist and toss on a double pack to get the free shipping. You can't beat that. Phil is solid. He will fix you right up. Plus he ships insanely fast. You'll have it in a few days

I contacted they're support and the told me that I should expect it to be shipped within the next 10 days, so hopefully next week it should be shipped!  Just make sure you get the epacket shipping option, it could mean the difference between waiting a week or waiting a month.  Good.luck!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cbrph,Stormcrow21,9,Mon Jul 6 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"They are always restructuring and never getting better. Nobody was/is buying their e juice so now they are selling it as flavoring for other stuff.  Everytime they post in here it's about some sale, they have always had some kind of crazy sale going I assume to purge inventory. They get called out on their bullshit and always have the same ""we're restructuring/changing formulas/working to serve you better"" canned response - yet nothing changes except their name.  I really wanted to see a Canadian company do better, I gave them a chance once against the advice from this community and was burned just like you. Top rated juice on the site ""creamsicle""  tasted like orange glo furniture polish.  So I'm calling you out Brett Faucher of /u/CraveeJuice, I've asked you before what you have actually done to improve the juice. Do you still use alcohol based flavoring? Do you still dilute with a TON of distilled water and call it ""100% Organic VG""?  I'm not one to get wound up very often, but I'm getting sick of seeing your promos pop up, you don't deserve our or anyone else's business with all the smoke and mirrors behaviour.  Brett and team, prove me wrong.  -Robert  Edit: spelling  Edit 2: Paging /u/CraveEssence"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cbrph,Hubatola,3,Tue Jul 7 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"Hello,  I would be happy to address your concerns as they are valid and deserve a respectful answer. The reason you have received ‘canned responses’  (your words, not mine) is because the matter has been of a personal nature. Crave is a family owned/operated company. Though this is typically not the kind of information I would generally put on the Internet for the world to see, I feel strongly that this response needs to respect your collective intelligence.  Crave’s vision always has been, and always will be, to focus on the culinary aspects of the industry. As well as, expanding and diversifying our product lines to include more than electronic cigarette based products. Many of the “restructuring” responses you’ve seen in the past have been a result of changing regulations or attitudes/Terms of Service (TOS) of supporting services. Many vendors don’t disclose the roadblocks they face when dealing with import/export, financing, merchant accounts, and the standard things that general businesses need to operate. Many supporting services have bought into the “no-ecig businesses allowed” philosophy.  Two examples that come to mind are the 9ish merchant accounts we’ve had cancelled due to changing TOS agreements that no longer allowed ecigs; and when we have food extracts held for inspection at the border for undisclosed amounts of time due to Customs waiting for a Health Canada Rep to come and clear the packages.  We’ve been restructuring Crave to look/act more like a Culinary Company because that is what Crave is; A Culinary Company. The first bottle of eJuice was made in a commercial kitchen for my staff and I using ingredients we had on hand in the kitchen. Crave started in a kitchen, and now you are starting to see some of our culinary development enter the marketplace. We are shifting our single flavour eJuice over to our expanding DIY section for those who like to make their own eJuice, and replacing our existing line of eJuice with blends that are more complex. Crave has also been active with the CVA (http://canadianvapingassociation.org/) working towards strategies and solutions for vapers in Canada, and I have been listed as the Provincial Rep for BC. If you’re not a member, you should be. Please check them out and show your support for the cause!  As for the recent challenges that were mentioned to be of personal nature, there are two, and both have now been addressed; First is my recent divorce.  As you can imagine this required a significant amount of time and legal work to ensure that the business survived the divorce. I removed myself from a 12 yr relationship to continue to pursue what I believe to be a technology that can have/has had, a positive impact in the lives of many. Dealing with this took me away from Crave for a significant amount of time, but it was needed both for myself to recover and to protect Crave from my personal situation. This matter has been addressed; and I am back working at Crave full-time.  The second challenge is our production crew went out boating one evening after work, which resulted in a boating accident. While the injuries are non-life threatening, this accident caused us to lose a number of key players. Our production manager received life-long damage to one of his wrists and has lost the function of one of his hands. This has left us dramatically understaffed in an instant.  The suggestion that no one orders our eJuice is off base and couldn't be further from the truth. We’ve posted a significant growth rate every year for the past 4 years and counting. The reason for slow responses and shipping delays is because Brett and I have been running our butts off trying to fill the gaps created from the loss of staff (boating accident).  The suggestion that our eJuice is watered down is also off base and couldn’t be further from the truth. Adding a drop citric acid (commonly found in lemons, limes, oranges, etc.) to VG changes it’s molecular structure from a complex sugar to a simpler version. It’s an old culinary trick used when working with high sugar concentrations such as sugar sculpting, or as in this example making caramel (http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/555/how-does-adding-lemon-juice-to-sugar-make-better-caramel).  Citric acid was added to our old recipes in low concentrations (<0.01%) to allow 100% VG based eJuice to be vaped in the popular pen technology of the time. Now that the market is more focused on mods, boxes, etc. and 100% VG or Max VG eJuice is more common in the marketplace, we’ve revamped our recipes and removed any alterations to the sugar structure of our VG. There was a time over a year or so ago when we had distilled water in the recipe but that was a long time ago.  To date, the back orders have been caught up and we are working on hiring/training replacement staff as quickly as possible. If these issues have impacted your order, please send us an email and we would gladly add credit to your account.  Whether or not you choose to try us again is up to you. However, at least now you know why things have been the way they have, and we are working day and night to continually improve. Once fully staffed again, we will be adding in live support features to the website to provide on the spot immediate responses to your questions and enquiries.   Thank you for your understanding and we hope you will give us another chance again in the future.  Cheers,  Chef Matt Crave Essence www.craveessence.com info@craveessence.com  /u/Stormcrow21 /u/RobertDF902  /u/VlRU5 /u/Hubatola"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbrph,CraveEssence,3,Wed Jul 8 22:14:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, Matt.  I can appreciate that bad things happen and are beyond our control. Hopefully there won't be any more roadblocks ahead, speedy recoveries all around.  Thanks for addressing the make-up of your product. I'm not too proud to admit I've learned a few things today. Hopefully once things get up to full speed ahead for you, crave will be a company we can all be proud of. I've said many times that I love to see Canadian companies thrive.  Everyone deserves an opportunity to redeem themselves and I will look forward to a day where I can say I was completely wrong about you as a company.  All the best, /u/CraveEssence.  Cheers!  Robert"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbrph,RobertDF902,2,Thu Jul 9 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Hi Robert,  Thank you for the kind words and your understanding! We have just launched a few new flavours and would love to hear your opinion of them. Send me a PM with your contact details and we'll ship you out some samples to try. Love to hear your feedback! We  collect all feedback we receive and enter it into a database. We use them as notes when we review our products. We value the feedback the vaping community gives us! We have put a lot of hard work into our products and care about vapers. Without vaping, I'd still be smoking like a chimney (FYI: Smoking is a huge problem in the hospitality industry). It changed my life. Heck, I had one customer drive 2 hours to shake my hand and say thank you; Converting to vaping using our eJuice saved his marriage. He said his wife wouldn't go near him and they were always fighting when he was a smoker. Since picking up vaping, they rekindled their romantic fire and have never been more connected and in love. He was using our Funky Monkey flavour and said his wife remarked how she loved kissing him because he tasted like chocolate and banana instead of a dirty ashtray. It's stories like this one that provide us with the drive and motivation to continue the up hill battle to have vaping become accepted here in Canada. The social shaming strategy that was used in Canada to reduce smoking rates, while yielding results, is a highly problematic social strategy to execute on a population (without their consent). I say this because of how it was received by the general public. In downtown Vancouver, I have personally witnessed people spit on, and cus out smokers. I've even seen people throw rocks at smokers while waiting for a bus (Yes this really happens). While I personally feel that it would be better if people didn't smoke, these actions go well beyond what I feel is acceptable. Vaping provides smokers with a healthier alternative to tobacco, as well as removes the social stigma that they have been labelled with, while providing positive re-enforcement for their commitment to stop using tobacco.  We're not just in it to make money, we'd actually rather make a difference. Crave will eventually become a social enterprise with profits being transferred into a fund for community development and small business start-up financing. Starting a business in Canada is a challenging task and we've learned tons over the last 4 years. One of our goals is to eventually be able to help remove some of the roadblocks we faced on our journey, to make it easier for others to take the journey themselves. The Canadian economy depends on small businesses for sustained economic growth. Emerging markets (e.g., the electronic cigarette industry) provide Canada with the opportunity for significant economic growth and to establish ourselves as global leaders in these new arenas. You will be seeing more of our long term strategies coming online over the next few months.  Hope you have an awesome weekend!  Cheers,  Chef Matt www.craveessence.com info@craveessence.com"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cbrph,lumpy420,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"That's really unfortunate. That means that things I've ordered from China have arrived before they have started to process the order. (On very rare occasions has it been this quick, mind you.)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cd72m,thatwiztidkid,2,Tue Jul 7 00:13:33 2015 UTC,"I really suggest diy-ejuice.com for your first orders. There based in BC but there shipping is fast, there prices are good, and there selection is HUGE. If your ordering mainly TFA or ordering TFA in bulk order through TFA directly. Other flavors like FA, FW, inawera etc are pretty much on par with the manufacturers cost through diy-ejuice.com  I really suggest starting out by mixing by weight with pipettes. It's much easier and more accurate then syringes but the downside is you got to buy a decent scale first. I recommend http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B005UGBG20?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 as its pretty cheap when you factor in its accuracy and it has a ac plug that disables its auto off function.  Nicotine, if you just wanna get small quantity of nicotine i recommend eastcoastvapes. If you want bulk hydavape is good."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cd72m,Vendeta44,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:54:19 2015 UTC,I second this scale. Ordered a cheaper one and a weekend of mixing later i purchased that one... Moral of the story don't cheap out !
Canadian_ecigarette,3cd72m,reay01,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:08:50 2015 UTC,That scale is actually pretty cheap already for the accuracy it give.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cd72m,BooksofMagic,2,Thu Jul 9 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Just bought 100 mls of nicotine from east coast (I'm in Toronto). Took 2 business days with their normal shipping! Highly recommended. I'm also just starting diy, so far its pretty fun!  Make sure you look up recipes before you make your first order. I didnt and whenever I looked up recipes I was always missing one or two ingredients. Good luck btw, it's so much cheaper and you can find awesome recipes including clones online.   50 10ml dropper bottles are 8 bucks on amazon, and 50 30ml are 20 bucks. Only downside is you have to wait a month since its free shipping from China"
Canadian_ecigarette,3cd72m,thumpx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:05:29 2015 UTC,hows the quality of that nic?
Canadian_ecigarette,3cd72m,NATEMCWN,2,Tue Jul 7 19:07:41 2015 UTC,It seems good to me..but my opinion doesnt mean much considering this is the only nic I've tried other than whats in premixed juice sold in stores. I just started DIY
Canadian_ecigarette,3cd72m,thumpx,2,Tue Jul 7 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"We must insist you are careful with your Nicotine. If you get pure nicotine, one drop on your skin can kill you. You can get Nicotine that has already been mixed with PG, so you only need the Nic/PG mix and VG, plus flavor. This is much safer for you (and for the delivery guy!.. imagine if it spilled? he'd die too)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3cb7b1,CuBu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:37:33 2015 UTC,I might be wrong but I thought I read either online or in the manual that locking it in its required for the temp control to function correctly.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cb7b1,Sliparoon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:42:20 2015 UTC,Mine was doing the same thing with my Mutation x V3 if I'm using nickel.  Not pleasant at all.  Haven't had it happen with the joyetech head.  Good idea in locking it in.  I'll have to remember that next time I play with nickel.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cb7b1,SwedeShooter,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:38:39 2015 UTC,Better than my issue with the nickel kanger heads lol. Fine for a bit but last it down for any length of time and the device thinks they are super hot (this is apparently an issue others have had even on other devices).  I was to the understanding you should always lock in the resistance on tc devices.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cb7b1,Sliparoon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:44:44 2015 UTC,I haven't noticed that!  I do use the sun tank mini as well... It is easily my 'most convenient' tank because of how easy it is to fill and until recently the only 'stock' nickel coils.  But I just don't get anywhere near the flavour.  Maybe this is why.... The temp control is kicking in way below where it should.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cb7b1,Sliparoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:32:59 2015 UTC,It's your resistance changing after sitting for a while? I've just taken to turning up the heat 35-45C
Canadian_ecigarette,3cb7b1,Sliparoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:40:09 2015 UTC,I haven't used the kanger on the evic yet so I'm not sure.  On the SX mini it's impossible to know.  You set the resistance when you attach the tank and it only ever displays the resistance you set.    I'll have to give it a try on the evic without locking and see what happens.

Canadian_ecigarette,3cfr0p,Tamarnouche,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"I want to come out in the defense of Crave.  I was very pissed off months ago, when they changed their website and their name and product line and everything and it took them more than 6 weeks to get my order done.  Then, my order came in and 4 juices sucked (the cherry tobacco was horrible and the other 3 took more than 2 months to steep to an acceptable vape).  But, I decided to give them a chance, to make it up to me for the juices and for the delay.  They actually gave me an apology and store credit.  And I ordered and 2 days after, my order was ready to go, arrived in 2 days.    I steeped my liquids (as I've done with all the liquids I've received online: Crave, FlavourCrafters and VistaVapors) and 2 weeks in, they were ready to go.  I can personally say that this time I had no regrets and they have bought me back.  Crave is a Canadian vendor.  Does that give them the right to suck?  NO.  But can we be less intolerant and more communicative with them?  YES.    They know they live off people's reviews.  They know (I'm pretty sure they do) that they have fucked up.  But... if they work double as hard and they take each incident and bring back these customers... I see a business coming back because they are not as bad as other liquid vendors out there.  So they have me back.  Only my next in line to purchase are Flavour Crafters because their juices are great and their customer service is fucking awesome, but Crave is my #2.  So don't fuck it up again, Crave.  I'm not forgiving the 2nd time.  TL;DR:  Crave fucked up, I gave them a 2nd chance because everyone deserves one, especially a Canadian Vendor and they scored.  But don't fuck up again."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cbld4,lilfunky1,3,Mon Jul 6 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"How do they expect people to test this out at that volume?  Testing juice really sucks, nobody tells you how much money you will waste trying to find something that doesn't make you gag.  I really wish online vendors would offer some better testing options, like several bottles of like 3 ml or maybe even smaller, just enough to get the taste in a dripper or something for a few hits, if I like, I'll step up my order. Nope, they ALL want you to buy massive bottles or overpriced sample packs. Don't they realize this just angers customers? I can't tell you how many 10/30 ml bottles I've paid for, juiced up a wick once, and put it in a cupboard, and eventually the trash can because it's difficult to even resell if you don't like something."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbld4,_Nymphae,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm betting the reason companies don't offer anything smaller than 10ml or even 30ml bottles is because a 5ml, 10ml and 30ml bottle probably costs literally the exact same thing, and outside of probably shipping costs, the packaging is the most expensive part of the product."

I dunno, I get that they need to make money, but you look at what DIY costs, and the  prices some vendors charge are criminal."

Canadian_ecigarette,3cbld4,Solace_ffl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"This seems like a cool idea, but it looks like they're more about just selling premium e-juice. When you click on ""Sample Size Available"" to filter your choices, only 10 flavours are available."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbld4,uhpcolin,2,Tue Jul 7 19:48:23 2015 UTC,I've really wanted to try their Milkman but I'm not ready to fork out a bunch of money for a 180ml bottle that I may or may not like.
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbld4,obzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:02:55 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it only comes in 180ml. I bought a bottle from Dashvapes about a month and a half ago and I'm nearly finished it now.  It is a decent juice but it's a coil gunker. I have been using it in a lemo drop with a nickel build on a dna40 and after about 20ml it starts to loose flavour quickly. I'll be giving MilkMan a try sometime in the next few months.

Have had milk man for less than 2 weeks and I'm down to my last 30-40ml on that bottle.  Only downside to these juices is there is some sweetener so they will gunk up your coils quick. I usually get 3 days on my Starre coils but I vape alot, so others will probably get more out of em."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbld4,vape360,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"My local B&M (e-cigarettes.ca / Yonge & Eglinton area) carries both Milk Man and Muffin Man in 30 ml bottles - link  Higher price/ml relative to the bulk 180 ml option. On the other hand, paying a few extra dollars for the 30 ml option is cheaper than buying the 180 ml option - especially for a first try or as a gift."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbmue,ikerplunkk,3,Mon Jul 6 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"Of all the flavors you've mentioned, none share an ingredient amongst them all, but I can point out a couple of similarities:   King Custard, Runny Runny and SY4 have one shared ingredient Country Faire and Pom Pomme share two ingredients beyond that, there are no shared ingredients   There's obvious similarities between Cobblestone Cream, Lemonlight, and Pom Pomme, since I use more or less the same cheesecake foundation (with slight alterations, generally 3-4 shared ingredients). Same for Lunar Dust and Mean Frean (same cookie foundation, 3 shared ingredients). Some consider SY4 and King Custard very similar, but there's only one shared ingredient.  As for wattages and setups, here's a list of things I primarily used in making the flavors:  Kayfun Lite @ 1.8ohms & 15W Lunar Dust, SY4, Amaro Borealis*, Runny Runny, Triple P, Country Faire  Origen RDA @ 0.5ohms & 35W King Custard, Cobblestone Cream*  Quasar RDA @ 0.5ohms & 35W Flan Plan*, Vitis Wrath*  Quasar RDA @ 1.5ohms & 20W Lemonlight*, Mean Frean*, Pom Pomme*, Cerious*  You'll see I personally prefer lower watts and drippers. I do try every flavor on a myriad of devices, but my options are limited. I don't notice a big change in flavor between atomizers except in the ones I did mostly in an Origen (if you get a chance to try Cobblestone Cream in an Origen, I suggest it).  I'm not sure how to pinpoint the issues you're having. Have you had a friend try them out and give their thoughts? This is the first I've heard of someone finding many flavors tasting the same.  edit; I wanted to add that I use sweetener sparingly. I've put an asterisks beside the flavor above if it contains sweetener. I don't like to use sweetener, but some flavors really demand it."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbmue,setzRFD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's my set up, I'm not entirely sure. I'm going to give them some steeping time, I think they'll probably improve."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbmue,psychedeliduck,2,Mon Jul 6 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"what setup are you running on?  vaping cobblestone cream, dont get much strawberry but definitely cheesecake atm  lemonlight definitely comes through, cerious is alright blueberry cereal but a little harsh for me, king custard comes through good too at high wattage, nice cinnamon custard havent had much luck with mean frean and pomme pom, but i havent really vaped them too much, runny runny same thing  country faire is a good apple pie  so basically im saying i can taste them, not sure what the issue is :("
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbmue,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Alternating between a MutationX V3 with a parallel build and a sub-tank mini with 0.5ohm coil. Both taste the same tbh, vaping around 30w for each, not exact."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbmue,kkeeiiggaann,2,Mon Jul 6 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"Wow...that's really interesting. I've not had this experience. I've vaped almost nothing but SZVapor for quite a while now.   There are a few flavours that have similar bases, and it is noticeable. For example, the cheesecake bases seem similar, but not identical (they very well may be identical, but the variance in effect from the fruit flavourants produces a different intensity in the cheesecakes for me personally). The pastry/cookie components in some seem similar.   Sweet/tart is a good way to describe the raspberry overtones in Mean Frean. Depending on what kind of power you're putting through it (as with pretty well anything I've ever vaped), you're going to get some flavours coming through over others.  For example, and relevant to /u/psychedeliduck's comment, I've tried Cobblestone Cream in a relatively high-resistance, low-wattage configuration and found the cheesecake to be prominent, and in a low-resistance, high-wattage setup I've found the strawberry overtakes the cheesecake -- especially with a lot of airflow. I've found that if I'm not getting the kind of balance I like from Cobblestone, I can drop the wattage a bit to boost the cheesecake presence in the flavour on whatever build I'm using.  In tweaking my power output on any given setup, I can produce a noticeably different flavour balance...so while I haven't had the experience you've had (I can definitely tell the difference between SZ flavours), that's the recommendation I'd make. Try adjusting your power settings slightly, gradually, and see if you don't see some of the more subtle notes coming through more prominently at one setting or another."

I think I found that eventually with the Country Faire flavour vaping at higher wattages brought out the apple taste in it. I'm not sure if this was does intentionally but it sounds a bit annoying for people that don't meet high wattage requirements."
Canadian_ecigarette,3cbmue,adzsask,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:22:33 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't say there's a requirement. I'd say depending on the power you're putting through the thing, different flavours are more noticeable over others. I certainly never had any trouble tasting the apple flavour in CF at any power setting/build. Very curious that you're experiencing them so differently! What did you taste instead of apple?

Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,Famoosh,5,Mon Jul 6 02:33:39 2015 UTC,A++ for Sadie and the customer care level of this business. I for one respect the total honesty in her bringing this out. Thank you /u/evaperated
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,ihatethinking96,2,Mon Jul 6 04:04:05 2015 UTC,I'm a new vaper and I'm extremely impressed with how the majority of Canadian vendors conduct themselves. I actually just placed my first order with /u/evaperated and very much appreciate this type of communication and transparency. It refreshing to see quality and safety placed over profit. That's how you treat people.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,9host,4,Mon Jul 6 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you <3  My customers are very important to me, and I started this to help people, not harm them.  Though there is no proof either way, I like to stick to some form of guideline (ECTA's to be exact) so that there is some control and some self regulating to help minimize any risks down the line.  The very very very least I can do is always be honest, open and transparent with people.    Thank you for your support!  I love you guys!!!!!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,evaperated,4,Mon Jul 6 14:26:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the love and the support you guys!  I was super sad to see the results on those three because they are sooooooooooooooo so loved by so many.  I don't care about money loss at all, but what I do feel bad about is that I'm getting so many private messages and emails with sad customers begging me to still sell them some.  HEART BREAKING.  I'm still torn with allowing some go while I reformat as long as I have touched base with those that want it and fully disclosed that they don't meet ECTA levels of acceptability.  Leaving them on site is a 100% NO NO because it would enable new customers to just purchase the flavors with zero ability for me to communicate with them before hand.  I could email before shipping, but that would still be too risky and still leave room for the information to not get through to them.  I'm tossing it around still and DEFINITELY welcome your thoughts on this particular thing.  Mana Biscuit and Zomberry are not bad and will probably be able to be very close to their initial flavor profiles once we've reformatted them.  I'm pretty sure I already know the culprits in those two and can probably get them back sooner than later, and have them be good still.  Patient 'Zero' I have always been weary of because... well, custard.  It, surprisingly, wasn't terribly high in Diacetyl, but was pretty high in Acetoin.  This one is going to be the hardest to reformat and keep true to it's flavor.  SAD PANDA.  I promise my best to do my best for you all though.  I'll be discounting the newly formatted flavors a bit, or offering a free sample of them in every order so that I can get you guys to give me your feedback on if they are ready to sell again in your opinion, or if you think they need more work.  I do this with all of you in mind and REALLY want you guys to be as happy as possible in any big move I choose to make, or in this case, have to make.  Thank you again for the support during all of this.  You guys give me hope and happiness :D"

Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,setzRFD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:37:46 2015 UTC,Alpha Blood was tested too :)  It's fine other than needing to disclose so we will be leaving it as is and posting results once we get a few more tested.  YOU ARE SAFE SIR!!!! <3
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,evaperated,2,Mon Jul 6 14:40:01 2015 UTC,Would a hidden option via comments on orders work regarding the original formula? Then rename the new formula to something like Patient Two and discontinue the former.   At least if it were reserved to comments then they'd have to know to ask for it and more than likely know the reason why it was discontinued.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,anxdiety,3,Mon Jul 6 14:29:23 2015 UTC,"I was thinking something like that, like... putting a memo on them while they are not for sale and being reformatted.  Something like:  'This flavor recently tested above maximum levels for ECTA standards and is being reformatted to meet their requirements.  If you would still like to purchase the origional flavor while we reformat, you would be doing so at your own risk and with full knowledge that it tested high in list  the areas that it tested high in'  I'm going to hold off though until I've heard from more people on if this is something they would like me to do or not.  I just want zero chance of someone not having full disclosure when ordering it.  A message like that, and having them have to go through a bit of a round about way of getting it would ensure they have read the disclosure at least.  Also making them leave 'I understand my risks with vaping enter flavor they still want' to make sure they've read the rules.  MORE IDEAS/FEEDBACK guys, thank you so much.  See, I don't know why vendors don't just talk with the community and let them in.  It's so much nicer to be able to communicate about this than have nobody to talk to that can speak for the community.  I'm going to be taking as many opinions as possible before I make any decisions on this though.  Have to make sure I've thought a lot about it and talked to as many people that want to weigh in as possible.  <3"
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,evaperated,2,Mon Jul 6 14:46:01 2015 UTC,The other crazy idea would be just to release the formula and those of us addicted hard enough will find a way. But I fully understand why the magic should be kept hidden from us.   I do hope something is in place for the beginning of next month as that's about when I'll need to re-up. I certain the new formula will be as awesome as the current one even if a bit different.

Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,vi0lent,2,Mon Jul 6 16:12:08 2015 UTC,I don't have any suggestions for a good system to sell the old versions of these flavours to people who know about the high levels and don't care. I just wanted to say that Patient Zero is my ADV and I would order it regardless of how it tests.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,anxdiety,3,Mon Jul 6 18:43:06 2015 UTC,It's great that there's such transparency. I'm highly annoyed with the industry's self created bogeyman that's food for the feds. Primarily because now I'll have to search for a new ADV in the meantime.   Any recommendations for a good custard that's around $0.30/ml after shipping?
Canadian_ecigarette,3c9bd0,obzilla,3,Mon Jul 6 05:10:35 2015 UTC,"http://dsvcreations.com/products/g-money   Different than PZ but a really good custard, and it will hit your price point depending on how much you get."

In the meantime I am allowing those that are absolutely unable to live without it to get some while we reformat.  To do so, order any flavor but in the comments specify which flavor you want it replaced with.  You absolutely -must- write this in the comments as well:  'I fully understand that flavor name failed to pass ECTA standards and I am fully aware of the potential risks.  I am choosing to vape this flavor under full disclosure'  ^ That is just so that I know there has been communication involved, and so that I know you are fully aware of things :)"

High ceilings, wide space, honestly perfect for VapeCan.  With the worries of Bill 45 let's try to make the most out of this one, because .... We never know.  But I am so hyped for it, it's all I've been thinking about this whole month. I'm going to be bringing a hefty amount of cash for this. I have my fingers crossed that DSV will have my EDV, Jedi Slayer in 500 mls just so I don't have to pay shipping as I always do.  I'm realllllyyyy hoping for either the Dogecorn and a tiffany blue Dynasty mod and drip tip at a reasonable price!!  I'm so incredibly picky with juices that I've got my fingers crossed for a juice that'll sweep me off my feet. Right now I only have 3 main juices, I really do wanna expand.  If you guys are going on Saturday, look for the Asian girl wearing a Sailor Moon dress, that'll be me!! I hope you guys will also be competing in the CloudChase comp. I'm kinda hoping we can use our own juice though. I also wished that VapeCan would give us some sort of details on the CloudChase comp, like what time does it start, if we can use our own juice, is it tube or are box mods allowed to? etc"

We went last year and I have to say the best part is just trying a bunch of brands, and flavours. Also we don't make a ton of money so we never blindly buy any flavours. If we can't try it, and don't fall in love with it at store. We never buy it.  So yeah, vapecan is amazing for letting us try brands and flavours we'd never normally get to."

This is due to testing that was done and some of the levels were higher than what ECTA likes.   Personally I don't give a shit what ECTA thinks with their food for the feds. I smoked bagged native smokes for years and nothing I vape could come close to those gastank smuggled death sticks.   I seriously hope there's an option to continue to order the existing formula and the new one is renamed Patient One or something else. Otherwise I hope that the original formula is posted so those of us that live on the stuff can make it ourselves.   I placed an order on Friday that hasn't moved for 3x140ml.

Canadian_ecigarette,3c8sn2,Beardharmonica,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:02:52 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that since they're asking the proper way to clean a tank, they're probably new to vaping and are using a pre-built disposable coil like a kanger dual coils or aspire BVCs or something..  Tap water is conductive so getting the coil wet (i.e., coil and wicking material) will result in water soaked into the coil head and could short the battery.   If you're rewicking a rebuildable and running the coil under water after a dry burn it's all good.  You won't be trapping water in your coil head with those obviously."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c8sn2,D3adkl0wn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:12:59 2015 UTC,"yes, dont wet you protank/subtank coil if your reusing it, that make sense"
Canadian_ecigarette,3c8sn2,Beardharmonica,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:24:29 2015 UTC,"The way I have been cleaning my subtank mini has been how others have suggested. Warm water to clean all the parts, accept for the coil. Then, I either let it air dry on a paper towel, or aid it by using some compressed air to dislodge out some of the water, and either paper towel or q-tip the rest where I can.  I do not wet any of my replacement coil heads, if there is some juice still lingering on the cotton, I will fire it up on my mod 2-3 times, just to heat and vapour off the excess. Don't over do it though, you don't want to burn up your cotton, just enough that you see most of the juice has evaporated off of it."

This is an amazing and relatively cheap three post RDA(especially if you aren't big on clones). Lots of build room and deck space for building and wicking. It's got bottom airflow that comes in right under the coils. Great flavor, great cloud production, adjustable airflow and the juice well is deep. Outside of a little residue, no leaking through the airflow(certainly nowhere near dripping down into my mod). I've had mine for a little over a month and could not have asked for a better RDA to learn on. It comes with two premade coils, a bit of cotton, spare o-rings and a wider bore mouth piece.

I was also going to order a coil jig and a resistance tester.  Anything else that might be useful for a first timer?  I already have a collection of tiny screwdrivers that go down to PH000 I can't imagine needing anything smaller for rebuilding."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,Wilibus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"I started with 26ga kanthal, a decent starting point. I like the japanese cotton for wicking material, it comes in pads usually. I got myself a universal tools coil jig set ( http://www.lightningvapes.com/products/universal-tools-coil-jig ) and that works pretty damn amazing. I don't have a resistance tester as my smok m80 has one built in. I just estimate the resistance of my build on steam-engine and toss it on. I may get one in the future, but i'll just use the one at work if i have to."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,morbidangel27,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:50:02 2015 UTC,https://m.fasttech.com/products/3033/10008276/2073700-authentic-kanthal-a1-resistance-wire-for this wire?   10m should be plenty I would assume. That should make me 100+ coils (guessing ~10cm per coil) and I'm sure I'm bound to screw the first few up.  And even at 2 coils per week this should last me close to a year.  https://m.fasttech.com/p/2126500 this cotton?    Roughly how much cotton do you use per coil?  Does this stuff keep for extended periods of time?
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,Wilibus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"I've had the same cotton in my RDAs for about a week and a half now, using the same juice. Yes and yes to your questions. I personally just buy the stuff at a local shop (its relatively cheap either way). As for how much cotton you use, depends on the coil. peel the cotton pad in half, and cut 1.5x the width of the coil. So if the coil has a 3mm inner diameter, i cut a strip about 4.5mm. Might need to look up some videos on how to do it, it took me a few tries to get it down well enough."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,morbidangel27,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!  I was at my B&M yesterday looking at RDA's when I went in to pick up some juice yesterday.  I picked out 2 heads, coil jig, resistance tester wire and wicks for less than the single RDA I was looking at.  Granted that is clones vs authentic but I'd rather learn (ie. ruin) on the cheaper stuff before I spend $80 on a high quality piece."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,Wilibus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm all for clones. I have a dark horse clone and a plume veil clone. Nothing wrong with getting some cheap gear my friend. Though if you do end up liking a particular clone, getting an authentic can only be better usually. Some auths are near the same price as clones. Like the Mutation x v4 is something like 35 bucks for an authentic, which is pretty awesome considering a clone is like 10-15."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,morbidangel27,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"And even at 2 coils per week this should last me close to a year.   If you take care of the coils in your RDA, with periodic rinses and dry burns, you can use the same coils for months. In one of mine the coils are 3 months old now, and good as new after cleaning. Once you get a build done that you're really pleased with, it's just a matter of being gentle when changing the cotton, and it'll last for ages.  Cotton I change every day or two usually, depending on the flavours I'm vaping. Some gunk it up more than others."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,on_a_moose,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:02:52 2015 UTC,My other concern (or desire I guess) would be new coils/cotton every time I change to a new flavour.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,Wilibus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:54:04 2015 UTC,"No need to do that. Your general cleaning/maintenance regimen would go something like this:   Gently pull the old cotton and dispose of it. Invert the RDA and give the coils a swish in a bowl of water. Dry the RDA a bit with a paper towel, just so it doesn't drip on your mod. Dry burn in pulses, til the coils glow. Quench the hot coils in the bowl of water, swish, dry burn again and repeat.   If you do this when changing flavours or perhaps every 3 days to a week (depending how gunky the juice you're using is), your coils will last forever and you won't have a problem with flavour cross contamination."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,on_a_moose,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:59:52 2015 UTC,Sweet.  Thanks for the tips.  Don't suppose you have any secrets on making my Maganus coils last forever.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,Wilibus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"No idea, sorry. I'd never even heard of that one til this thread. Looking at pictures of the coil heads I'd guess they could be rebuilt, but I'm not sure if they could be rewicked without totally disassembling them. Maybe search Youtube for a tutorial."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c6ul4,on_a_moose,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"I just picked up the Haze from my local B&M. It was $20 and it's a Tobeco clone.

Canadian_ecigarette,3c67ag,morbidangel27,2,Sun Jul 5 11:13:25 2015 UTC,"I won't bother with the risk anymore. It's really a roll of the dice. When I can get 150ml for 50.00+tx I see no reason to go across the border for juice. We have lots of great Vendors in Canada selling juice for great prices and once you add the exchange on the dollar and add shipping, also adding risk of losing the shipments, its cheaper or the same price to buy in Canada."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c67ag,Lampburglar,2,Sun Jul 5 11:58:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. Vapornorth sells 120ml for 55 shipping/tax in. Vaporist is near the same. Among other vendors too. Getting good juice in canada is a cakewalk.

Really good in the mornings.   The CTC Cereal is very good. I've tried the Enemy Spotted juice from CS Vapes (also a cinnamon toast crunch flavor) and I get less sweetness and cinnamon but more of the cereal flavor.  Milk of the Poppy is a good one as well.   I'm not sold on the Dot's Custard yet but my friend really likes it. I'm giving it a bit of steeping time.  Mars is good if you like orange creamsicle. I'm giving that one a steep as well.

Make sure for your next mod to be super gentle when inserting and removing it, I think the ports on mods tend to be less durable than say on your cellphone.

Hate to voice such a negative opinion and I'm sure to get downvoted.    But going to nicotine gum and lowering your dosage until you're down to excel winter green is really no different than reducing the nic content until you get to 0mg."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,Wilibus,3,Sat Jul 4 18:11:32 2015 UTC,Except for the (very powerful) hand-to-mouth habit that smokers develop.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,DAL82,2,Sat Jul 4 20:27:35 2015 UTC,"It's not just the hand to mouth action. There is so many more sub habits.  The time factor of taking a break and actually doing something with that time.  I never realized just how much of my daily routine was tied to smoking prior to vaping. Start the car, answer the phone,  sitting on the toilet."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,anxdiety,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"For sure, but slamming those other solutions because they continue to perpetuate a nicotine addiction and leaving vaping off the list is pretty biased.    But that habit is more powerful than a lot of people realize.  Another habit I find hard to break out of is not constantly stopping at convenience stores.  A lot of times I'll just pull into the parking lot before I realize I don't really need or want anything."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,Wilibus,2,Sat Jul 4 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"It's disgusting that that drug is still on the market. Pfizer settled a lawsuit as a result of 600+ suicides caused by Champix in the U.S. for ~$280 million, yet it's still being produced, marketed and sold. It really goes to show that the only thing the FDA and Health Canada are interested in protecting are corporate profits for companies they financially benefit from."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,on_a_moose,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:15:04 2015 UTC,"I've only known 2 people to have taken Champix in my life.  First was a guy who worked at the pizzeria next to my shop.  We discussed how well it was working over cigarettes which I thought was strange after spending so much money on a quit smoking drug.  But apparently that was the plan, to slowly ween yourself away from them.  Then came the most disturbing situation of my life.  Pete asked if it was strange to have violent dreams about his coworkers.  I laughed and said I've had my share and told him to think nothing of it.  Then he started having dreams about coming to work and being murdered.  Then he just stopped coming to work, and then I got the news that he had passed due to a complication from some internal bleeding.    The second was a drywaller buddy of mine who after a week of use developed a temper that eventually led to a broken hand and the nickname studfinder.  Several years later he is a vaper and still breathing.  Fuck Champix."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,Wilibus,2,Sat Jul 4 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"Ya, for the first three weeks for me it was great. It basically blocks the effects of smoking... so you can smoke but there's no point because you don't get that nic buzz/relief.   The around the third week I couldn't sleep, then I started crying (and I haven't cried in 20 years, I'm NOT a crier), then I started feeling like my brain was splitting apart and then I started thinking jumping off the balcony was the only way to end this feeling.   Stop taking it the next morning and within a day I was fine and back to normal.   Never reported it, simply stopped using it. I suspect a LOT of people don't report adverse reactions to it."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,Wilibus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure the thought never occurred to Pete.  Apparently strange dreams are a huge warning sign, and from the conversation I had with him I seriously got the impression no one sat down and explained to him what to do if experiencing these side effects.  Such a fucking waste."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,iama_newredditor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:17:49 2015 UTC,"While I'm not going to disagree with it being dangerous, I feel I have to mention that Champix worked like a charm for me. It was my own stupid decision to smoke on vacation 7 months later that made vaping necessary to quit again, but that drug worked exactly as advertised for me with no adverse effects whatsoever (actually elevated my mood at the time).  I still think vaping is a much better and safer way yo quit, but I don't think Champix should be grouped with patches and gum."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,Wilibus,2,Sat Jul 4 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"yep, see my comment to the other poster. For those it works for, it's great (and it worked for me for the first three weeks). But for those that have adverse reactions (like I did), that shit can kill you."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,iama_newredditor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:31:40 2015 UTC,If it worked so well the first time why didn't you use it again?
Canadian_ecigarette,3c2pan,Wilibus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"Company's insurance only pays for it once in a lifetime, too expensive for me to afford on my own.  Edit: Also, as I already mentioned, I do think vaping is safer and didn't know about it when I used Champix."

Canadian_ecigarette,3c1qh5,remember_987,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:05:42 2015 UTC,its not so bad if you're in a room but if you vape in the car it can build up a sticky layer on your windows after a while
Canadian_ecigarette,3c1qh5,anxdiety,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:08:52 2015 UTC,Depends how heavily you vape but there most certainly is. There is a major difference between the tar of smoke and the residue of vaping.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c1qh5,Sliparoon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:39:27 2015 UTC,Honestly I only notice it with my car - but my wife wipes down the windows in the house every second week. Edited spelling.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c1qh5,kemekokitten,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:33:48 2015 UTC,My partner and I never noticed either. Nearly a year into vaping I noticed the glass on some pictures we have are foggy. It does leave a little layer of grease. I think if we were in a more open area maybe wouldn't notice. But we love in a small 1 bedroom basement apartment. So we notice the haze. Also to smoke alarms one directly above us where we vape the most. Never have we set it off. =)

It's been a long Saturday - we are running the American July 4th Disrupter contest now and I have a lot of things to do for the Disrupter marketing push. (Anyone know WebGL .js?)  I am going to go Random.org this up and then head out to a HipHop party where I might pass out from excitement and dancing. Really wish there was a club in Shenzhen that played Deep House.   We had about 366 Canadians enter and will be giving away 14 so the odds are pretty good that you won. Stay tuned. I will not go dancing until you have won!!

Canadian_ecigarette,3c1zur,HeyCarpy,5,Sat Jul 4 00:49:27 2015 UTC,"Hey! Unfortunately, no pre-orders have been shipped out yet.  We have been pretty much ready with everything for the past week, but we ran into some problems with one of our suppliers and they are holding everything back. We're doing everything we can to get things moving but at the same time we're working on alternative arrangements.   I'm a man of my word and I'll do everything in my power to get all orders out by the promised date, which is July 13th. However, there are always unexpected things that can go wrong and it's important for us to prepare for the worst case scenario and be open about the situation to our customers.   In case I do see that a delay is likely to happen, I will be emailing everyone that pre-ordered and we'll be working on a solution with each and every one of our customers. I would hate for this to happen, but it's an unfortunate possibility when relying on other people.    If you do run out of juice before we ship and have to go buy a bottle from somewhere else, PM me or email me at andrew@safarijuice.com and I will personally find a way to compensate you for it."

From what im hearing on here 35amps continuous is really dangerous and some say it doesnt even exist. I want to go return this battery but what do i tell the guys in the store? Can one of you explain why this battery is a fake or is dangerous to use. Thanks!
Canadian_ecigarette,3c21fi,MacHater420,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"Go back to the store and tell them that you would like to exchange your batteries for Samsung 25R or LG HE2. Politely tell them that you would prefer to stick to trusted batteries that have been tested thoroughly.  If they asks anything more, explain to him that you can easily find the spec sheet and several tests of the Samsung 25R battery, where as you can't find anything about these proving that they are rated for what they say they are.  If even after that they won't exchange it for different batteries, leave the shop and never come back. Without unwrapping the batteries, you have almost no way of knowing if they are rated for 6 amps, or 20 amps."

Canadian_ecigarette,3c21fi,Awesummzzz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"That's very true. I don't trust my knowledge enough to go with a mech yet, I'll stick to regulated for now and not give vaping another horror story haha"
Canadian_ecigarette,3c21fi,joeyxl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"I mean mechs are pretty safe as long as you're not stupid and push a battery too far. I would say if you want to start build no lower than a .4 and use a good battery (Personally I use SubOhmCell).   If you're going to ask what a good battery is, to be honest I'm not sure. I've only ever used SubOhmCell but google helps =p lol I will have to do some research soon on batteries for a video I'm making."

But I support that CECR went private, and I would continue to support if we remained private. Thank you mods for not turning a blind eye to reddit as a whole and participating in the blackout even if for a short time."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,Vendeta44,5,Fri Jul 3 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"yep, we were prepared to go a long time if that's what reddit as a whole did. But as other reddits started coming back online you enter a point of diminishing returns, where you're just hurting the subscribers more than affecting change.    Personally I think reddit took their foot off the gas far too early, but it is what it is."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,demon1102,2,Fri Jul 3 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'd have loved to see the blackout stay in full force for a few days. But unfortunately allot of users felt like there unimpeded access to one of billions of sites on the internet was more important then standing up for the rights on millions of users."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,Vendeta44,3,Fri Jul 3 19:13:47 2015 UTC,what has been achieved because of the blackout?
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,anxdiety,3,Fri Jul 3 19:19:00 2015 UTC,"As of this time the effects are not clear. The desired effect was a change in how reddit is run by the admins.  That change will be seen in the coming months if we were successful. If we weren't you will be and already are seeing a large amount of members leaving reddit, moving to sites such as voat.co"
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,TheVaporist,3,Fri Jul 3 19:27:09 2015 UTC,From over in other subs there's been some back and forth between the mods and admins. Basically they gave in to the admins and brought things back online with the hopes to reevaluate things in 6 months.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,anxdiety,3,Fri Jul 3 19:42:03 2015 UTC,"it's reddit, does anything ever get achieved? :P  but seriously, it's just one event in an on-going emerging battle between the reddit community and reddit the company and the different views each has on ""what"" reddit is and should be in the future.   So what was achieved is that hopefully reddit the company realizes there are limits to how much they can screw with the reddit community."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,Vendeta44,2,Fri Jul 3 19:43:46 2015 UTC,Agreed..I think they were forced to reopen them. Would make sense.
Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,anxdiety,2,Fri Jul 3 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"You're not alone in the support. Things have been trending this way for a very long time. Little bits being chipped away over time that got a lot of ""whatever... they were shitbags anyway""."

Canadian_ecigarette,3c0r37,MaddogBC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:51:39 2015 UTC,Another side effect that is not being talked about is a lot of the minor subreddits that made the front page in place of the closed defaults. It's actually going to spread more of the userbase as well.

Canadian_ecigarette,3c1iy5,VaporChunks,2,Fri Jul 3 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"^ This exactly. those batteries are re-wraps, who knows what they are actually rated for. Do yourself a favor and get some Samsung 25r's."

Canadian_ecigarette,3c1iy5,joeyxl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:52:27 2015 UTC,Also found it on another website being tested and they describe it as the basen 18650 but in brackets it says samsung 25r cell lol so i guess it is just a rewrapped battery

Canadian_ecigarette,3c1iy5,joeyxl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the eFests are going to be B or C bin batteries while the LG branded HE2s are going to be A bin and thus, higher quality."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c1iy5,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:20:34 2015 UTC,Yes. Have both he2 and purple efest. The efest has more sag than the he2
Canadian_ecigarette,3c1iy5,majorvapes,3,Sat Jul 4 19:42:34 2015 UTC,VaporChunks is right..be careful with the batteries. Don't build below 0.5ohm!   From what I can see you have a Kbox... Do you have an ohm reader? An old MVP or regulated device that shows the atomizer resistance?  If not PLEASE DO NOT BUILD YOUR COIL! GET AN OHM READER FIRST! SAFETY FIRST..ALWAYS!

Canadian_ecigarette,3c150w,Catmandingo,2,Fri Jul 3 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"Juice is still less expensive than tobacco. If you can afford cigarettes, you can afford juice. It may not be the best, but it's still better than smoking.   Edit* buy a stronger juice at 50pg/50vg and cut it in half with vg from shoppers or Walmart. It cuts the flavour, but can get you through in a pinch. 30ml of 12mg can become 60ml of 6mg ect...that's what I do when I'm stuck financially."
Canadian_ecigarette,3c150w,konkatenate,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:25:17 2015 UTC,Yes. That is a true statement.

I wonder if it was vegetable based ?
Canadian_ecigarette,3c150w,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:05:35 2015 UTC,"Since you are moving towards DIY, and you have both tobacco and glycerin [and if you like tobacco flavours] you could consider doing a sacrificial test by extracting some tobacco in the glycerin.

I haven't done this myself, but it could prove to be an interesting distraction while you wait for your materials to arrive. Search on NET [Naturally Extracted Tobacco] on /r/DIY_eJuice"

Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,TheGrumpyVaper,3,Thu Jul 2 16:17:39 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm okay with this. The ECTA is the closest thing we have to ensuring safe standards in vaping in Canada. Although I wish they would use impartial third party studies instead of relying on the company to test themselves.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,joekerr37,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:19:14 2015 UTC,awesome. ty. would be better if it was independently tested though.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,MacHater420,2,Fri Jul 3 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"This is great to see. People should know what they are vaping.   This is part of the reason I got into DIY (that and cost obviously). But at least with DIY I know exactly what is going into my ejuice. The only component that is ""sketchy"" is the nic base (partly while you'll see me rant now and then over the nic base situation in canada)... as I generally have no idea where it was sourced or how it was made.   But here's what I can tell you for sure: when I got into DIY I kept it simple, just PG/VG/nicbase/flavouring.   And what I noticed was my atomizers lasted FOREVER. Like seriously, even today I can vape an atomizer for an entire year (with a dry burn say once every week or two) without rebuilding it.    When I was vaping vendor juice, my atty's would gunk up after 3-4 days and would outright die after a month or two (of dry burns).   I have no idea what vendors add to their juices, but they add something beyond just flavouring, because when I make my own juice my atty's last forever.  This is also what makes me laugh about Health Canada. There was/are legitimate areas of vaping that they should be regulating, but instead they regulate the stupid stuff like ecigs must be kept under the counter and stuff."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,Robbie-R,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:04:48 2015 UTC,Gunking of coils can be caused by added sweeteners.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,joekerr37,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"I can't believe they posted those results in defense of themselves. Those numbers aren't as bad as Cloud9's test results, but they are still really fucking high. I would not be surprised to see numbers that high from cheap Juice made in China, but from Five Pawns,,,,,Are you fucking kidding me??? This is supposed to be ""Premium"" American made juice."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,DotModThrowaway,2,Thu Jul 2 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"but there's no such thing as 'premium'.  No one has ever defined what exactly ""premium"" is. Given everyone uses the same ingredients, I don't see how one juice can be premium over another, other than in taste I suppose.... so in essence you're paying for a premium recipe, not ingredients though.  In fact, I'd actually expect a ""premium"" juice to be at MORE risk for ingredients that shouldn't be in there as if those ingredients give them a ""flavour edge"" then they'll use them."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,on_a_moose,-1,Thu Jul 2 23:28:01 2015 UTC,ECTA shouldn't be dictating what vendors should or shouldn't be allowed to sale. As long as the levels are disclosed adults can make their own decision whether or not they want to take the risk with these liquids. Very unprofessional move by the ECTA they aren't the FDA or Health Canada. Get real.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,purrp,2,Thu Jul 2 22:31:10 2015 UTC,"This is deeply concerning, but I'm not really surprised. I smelled this kind of thing coming. The biggest issue that I can see is that ECTA doesn't appear to have done any testing themselves to verify diketone levels in this line of juice. This means they are potentially opening themselves up to liability for lost sales by making these demands of member vendors based on speculation or hearsay.  They cannot blindly trust a test published by any vendor, and especially not information that has since been retracted. It is imperative that ECTA replicate any concerning test results (through an independent and unbiased lab) before making these demands, if they want to have any credibility in the industry at all.  I sincerely hope that if they do not shape up immediately that Canadian vendors have the sense to abandon ship to a degree that ECTA becomes irrelevant quickly. We can't have our regulatory or lobby groups going off on knee jerk reactions to every allegation made."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,DotModThrowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:34:45 2015 UTC,ECTA sent this email based on the numbers published by Five Pawns itself.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,l33tdude,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:23:26 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you 100%. For example a lot of the lines on the Vapor Shark test list I personally called the companies and asked about the results and a lot of them had noted that the test results are from older batches and that all their newer formulations have non detectable levels. Its really concerning that such a small irrelevant group believes that they have the authority to make these demands let alone trying to damage the reputation of a company that has done a huge amount of the vapor industry especially in regards to vape conventions and helping vendors.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvxhm,DotModThrowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:00:22 2015 UTC,Agree.  And their 'member pricing' for vendors is absolutely ridiculous and self serving.  Don't support these people.

But, lets say that just the day before, and every day before that since your office opened, you were allowed to smoke at your desk.  Would you not get a little strung out if it were busy and you wanted just a puff off that cigarette?  Yeah, they'll get used to it but there will be that period where you just want to have a haul off your vape when you normally would, but can't for fear of getting your business shut down.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bvhsk,lilfunky1,2,Thu Jul 2 14:14:55 2015 UTC,I have noticed that my 50/50 juice is starting to slowly seep out of my Sub Tank mini now that the temperatures are getting warmer. It has not been a problem with my higher VG juice yet. I am going to replace my seals and see if it helps because the ones I have in are 3 months old.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvhsk,Robbie-R,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:58:52 2015 UTC,I have noticed that my 50/50 juice is starting to slowly seep out of my Sub Tank mini now that the temperatures are getting warmer.   GAH! I'll have to check on my subtank mini as well then! I don't use that one nearly as much since it lives with my 30w which is like a back-up for me.   Maybe I should just empty it until I'm going to actually use it...
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvhsk,ZorroElite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"Leaking can be influenced by a lot of things (fullness of tank, wicking, viscosity, etc).  And certainly the higher the PG (lower viscosity) the easier to leak.   With all of my tanks I've gotten into the habit of just closing off the airflow when I'm not using them.  That eliminates the leaking issue regardless of whether they stay upright (for most tanks, including the Delta 2)."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvhsk,Swordinwall,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:25:16 2015 UTC,I've gotten into the habit of just closing off the airflow when I'm not using them.   Ah... that would make a lot of sense!  I have both my juice flow thing and my air flow thing wide open right now.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bvhsk,CuBu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"Mine will leak if I go from inside my house which is cold to outside where it is really hot. What I do is just keep it upside down in my pockey when I leave the house. My theory is the air pressure changes slightly and makes it leak, along with the heat."

Canadian_ecigarette,3br1pk,BudzJr,2,Wed Jul 1 13:33:20 2015 UTC,So 4x 30ml bottles is $39.96 and 1x 120ml bottle is $39.99?
Canadian_ecigarette,3br1pk,ScotyDoesKnow,2,Wed Jul 1 19:44:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the point out in the pricing. It has been fixed at $38.99 :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3br1pk,br4d24,2,Wed Jul 1 20:29:43 2015 UTC,Scotty did know :P
Canadian_ecigarette,3br1pk,br4d24,2,Thu Jul 2 09:33:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm may have to grab a hefty 120ml of the Kings custard or the hazelnut! Those two flavours are the only ones I've tried from you guys but damn, they were phenomenal!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3br1pk,majorvapes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:32:25 2015 UTC,"That's a great price for 120mls, will have to try some of your stuff. Any suggestions?"

Canadian_ecigarette,3br1pk,demon1102,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:15:07 2015 UTC,so the better deal is still buying two 30 ml bottles then getting 2 more free? so the 120ml is useless for now

Canadian_ecigarette,3boyca,mightyprometheus,-1,Thu Jul 2 21:57:05 2015 UTC,$15 shipping is way steep.
Canadian_ecigarette,3boyca,Lampburglar,2,Wed Jul 1 16:49:56 2015 UTC,Grab a sampler or a pack to get free shipping on your complete order :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3boyca,mightyprometheus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:07:59 2015 UTC,It's not steep if you grab a multi pack. Than the shits free bud. Literally the best deal around.
Canadian_ecigarette,3boyca,Lampburglar,-1,Thu Jul 2 00:03:14 2015 UTC,Isnt the multi pack like 40 dollars?
Canadian_ecigarette,3boyca,mightyprometheus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:13:42 2015 UTC,You can get a two pack for 29.99 with free shipping. The super sampler is 49.99 with free shipping. You won't find a better deal for amazing liquids.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpkez,GoldenEarsVapours,2,Wed Jul 1 03:06:14 2015 UTC,Damn your shipping costs more than from the states :S

Canadian_ecigarette,3bpi1m,elitexero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:29:14 2015 UTC,I  haven't tried it yet its currently breathing and I'm going to let it sit for at least a week before I do. Its $80 for 180ml so its a great value.

Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,GrimReefer_420,2,Tue Jun 30 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem overly hard to stop minors buying online. As a matter of fact, there is a shipping option that the shipper can select that makes you require ID in order to get your package. Example: Eastcoastvape does that the first time you order. My first order the postlady asked for my ID. She was as confused as i was at first, she'd never done it before aha. So it's possible, if you don't have ID, then you don't get your package."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,morbidangel27,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:04:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't know Canada Post offered that service. That would be an excellent tool to stop minors from vaping ""IF"" the vendors actually care who they are selling too. I imagine most do, but there will always be a few who don't and teens will know witch ones don't care LOL"
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,Robbie-R,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"canvape never did that, ECV did. Evaperated did not. It's a service that can be well utilized. It should be standard for all canadian e-cig businesses, those are the only places i've ordered from."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,morbidangel27,2,Thu Jul 2 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"Theres nothing you can really do. Its the same as with kids that drink at a young age and smoke cigs. If someone will buy it for them, they will do it. Regardless of what you want to try and do, it won't stop it. Id much rather a kid has someone buyin him a vape then a pack of smokes tho."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,chiggmo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:39:49 2015 UTC,"True, B&Ms can check ID and whatnot. The problem is online. Since they are minors the parents are responsible.  There is a big issues with this;  Kids for some reason have access to their bank accounts so the can do EMT transactions or get prepaid Visa cards.   You can control local stores online purchasing but not all of them.   There is a reason sites ask if you are age of majority, to cover themselves for the online session. In the end minors on the site = parent's responsibility."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,greekdude1821,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Stupid question, as I don't have any small humans in my life. But how do they keep small humans from porn sites (free ones obviously no way except net filters), online gambling, and other adulty websites?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,obzilla,4,Wed Jul 1 01:48:46 2015 UTC,"A friend of a friend of mine told me to access those websites you just have to click a "" i am over 18 "" button."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,CuBu,-5,Wed Jul 1 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"I mean the pay sites and gambling sites, smartass. They have age verification processes, do they not?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,obzilla,6,Wed Jul 1 02:10:48 2015 UTC,Don't be a dick I misread your question. Credit card age verification is the answer you wanted.
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,CuBu,-5,Wed Jul 1 02:47:47 2015 UTC,"You were being a smartass, I called you smartass. I didn't slash your tires. Relax."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,obzilla,2,Wed Jul 1 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"They don't.  ""Age verification"" amounts to ""click the I am over 18"" button and enter your credit card (which was pretty worthless as age verification even before pre-paid Visa cards were available at the supermarket checkout.)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,Pardoz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:17:57 2015 UTC,"crazy, and no one is concerned about these nefarious activities."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,obzilla,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:22:27 2015 UTC,"I'm like a super huge nanny dickhead when it comes to letting minors vape...  but you can do fuck all to stop online sales, it has to be on the parents.  I know the idea has been floated around to have ID cards tied to your online activity...  i don't think anyone wants that.  And I'm sure such a thing would be easily circumvented by those crafty kids."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,demential,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"All my b&m's are very strict and card before the kids even in the door.

Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,TSmashVapes,0,Wed Jul 1 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"There is nothing we can do about it because of online sales. Any kid can walk into a Walmart and buy a pre-paid credit card, with that they can buy all the vaping gear & juice they need online. The age verification systems used by online retailers is a joke. Its only a matter of time before the Canadian Government shuts down all online vaping sales because of this."
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,Robbie-R,2,Wed Jul 1 01:12:53 2015 UTC,canadian govt can only shut down canadian online sales not elsewhere
Canadian_ecigarette,3boxpc,Winter_knights,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:59:07 2015 UTC,"Very true, I imagine they will ban Canadian online sales in the next couple years.   Sooner or later the Federal & Provincial Governments are going to tax the shit out of E-Juice. That is when on-line sales will be banned and they will actually start enforcing the import ban. They will use the same tools they use to stop us from importing cigarettes and alcohol to stop us from importing e-juice.  When that happens lots of vapers will start making their own juice, but once the government realizes they are loosing tax revenue to the DIY crowd they will strictly regulate the sale of Nicotine Base. AT this point it will be more difficult for minors to get vaping supplies & it wont be because the government cares about minors vaping, it will be about protecting tax revenue."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,demon1102,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:42:05 2015 UTC,For a flashlight sure. Not for a vape.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,Vendeta44,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:47:56 2015 UTC,But they are all 18650 batteries  Any difference?
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,Vendeta44,5,Wed Jul 1 03:51:04 2015 UTC,Yes amp rates. Vaporizers require high continuous amp capacity batteries. The best and cheapest battery on available right now is the Samsung 25r and it has a 20amp capacity with 2500mah. The next best option is the LG HE2. Both widely available in Canada for less then 10$ a battery.   Anyone who tells you a battery has more then 30 or more amps continuous discharge is straight up lying. The only battery with 30 amps is a sony VTC 4 and I would not recommend buying them because of the prevalence of fake sony batteries.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,JDOGG8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:55:28 2015 UTC,Thank you :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,br4d24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:00:20 2015 UTC,Illumn.com has authentic VTC 3/4/5 and the Samsung/LG cells!
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,JDOGG8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Sony states that they no longer make vtc4's or 5's and any authentics that may be for sale are going to be old stock. Old batteries are not good batteries from what I understand, regardless if the have been used or not (obviously not used will be better than used... But don't expect a ""new"" vtc to work like a new vtc would have back when they were still being produced)."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,br4d24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:37:48 2015 UTC,They have new batches manufactured this year and late last year? Lol
Canadian_ecigarette,3bpohb,PifPifPass,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:37 2015 UTC,Not sure of the timeframe but I thought they stopped production on the earlier than this year - I could be wrong I'm just going off what I've read around here.

I guess since it's buy 2 get 1 free I could do 12, 0, and 0 and mix... wait, no, that'd be 4mg. Does the buy 2 get 1 allow one to mix flavors, or is it per  flavor?"

Canadian_ecigarette,3bmjwu,CuBu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"A side question for you... have you had any issues with your eVic VT popping out of VT mode into VW mode?    I have the sx mini m class which is awesome, but am thinking about grabbing an evic VT as a second/backup temp device and got a little worried about that one aspect of some of the reviews."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bmjwu,CuBu,2,Tue Jun 30 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"im gonna jump in and answer this one;   I've had mine for a couple of days now and mine has never popped out, also if you put your wattage in power mode down to 1 then go about your business in temp mode even if it popped out you'd have no problems whatsoever and notice right away because of the lack of power."

Canadian_ecigarette,3bmjwu,Sliparoon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:22:11 2015 UTC,Safety percussion really; but mine never has popped out like I said and I've never experienced the firing on startup (which is wattage mode only anyway) I'm enjoying the device especially with my delta 2.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bmjwu,TSmashVapes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:42:46 2015 UTC,Honestly I haven't had a single issue with it. I've heard of that problem as well as a VW one where it goes full blast for a few seconds when coming out of sleep or some other scenario. I can't seem to recreate either of those problems maybe I've just been lucky so far.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bmjwu,CuBu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:06:17 2015 UTC,I can't agree; if anything give it an n/a with the explanation (as you did) - rather than 0/10 which could dissuade people who are into those flavors from ever trying them.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,ishrubicus,14,Tue Jun 30 03:15:49 2015 UTC,This is actually a fairly reasonable law. I think most non douche vapers abstain from chukin tits in most places cigarettes aren't allowed anyways. Allowing vape stores exemptions is actually a nice touch.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,youngmeezy69,-1,Tue Jun 30 03:39:29 2015 UTC,"It's not a law to save anyone's fucking air quality. It's to mold public opinion.  ""Must be bad if it's banned right?  Yeah, I mean sin-taxes, makes sense to me!"" -- is what the public will be saying soon.   Fuck laws based on nothing but some emotional appeals and no actual proof of harm. We don't ban things because they can annoy someone."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,tet5uo,3,Tue Jun 30 06:48:36 2015 UTC,It's a side effect of the participation trophy generation. Everyone thinks the world should cater to themselves.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,Classturbate,6,Tue Jun 30 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'm perfectly fine with such a ban. It has no bad implications. I'd never vape in a public building besides a B&M with or without consent anyways. If anything I see this as good for us because it now forces people to not be douche-nozzles and gives less credence to the ""its completely unregulated"" bullshit everyone spews."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,Vendeta44,2,Tue Jun 30 05:13:01 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, vape shops can continue as they are. Unfortunately, vape-friendly businesses will be excluded like bars and other shops."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,signious,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:17:24 2015 UTC,What if a bar decides to sell a couple vapourizers as well as their drinks?  edit for those who do not know: Their is a bar in London that gets around the smoking ban.  Smoking is allowed during theatrical performances only - so when you walk into the bar you are actually walking into a live theatrical performance of a bar.  Enjoy your beer with a smoke.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,chiggmo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:41:12 2015 UTC,Well too bad nova scotia is too stupid to let vape stores do their own thing. I hate this province sometimes lol
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,Sens420,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:42:49 2015 UTC,I think patio's should be able to choose if they want a vaping section or not.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,joekerr37,0,Tue Jun 30 12:23:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Really, anywhere outside should be fine for vaping.   I vape inside around people who HATE smoking, and they have no issue with the vapor at all. So if they are ok with it indoors, I really can't imagine who could possibly be offended in an outdoor environment."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,cloudposts,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:25:58 2015 UTC,This is better than some recent legislation in the states which banned vaping in stores. At least this way Calgarians can still utilize juice bars in shops.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,Vendeta44,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:49:33 2015 UTC,or ya know bill 45 that banned vaping in stores in Ontario? And bill 12(i think) that did the same in BC?

Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,phumduq,2,Tue Jun 30 14:35:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from the journalists at CBC being on average poor writers, this is all part of a PR campaign to create a parity between vaping and smoking. Once that is done the public will leap on sin taxes."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bl8bi,tet5uo,3,Tue Jun 30 15:13:05 2015 UTC,And most vapers being selfish idiots are thinking to themselves that this isn't too bad and we should be happy they didn't restrict it in vape-shops.   They're delusional if they think it will stop here. This is step one in the plan to tax the everloving shit out of vaping.   7 Billion dollars per year in tobacco taxes is a lot of incentive to create some propaganda.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bl081,DotModThrowaway,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:18:30 2015 UTC,GC/MS is an inaccurate method of testing for e liquid. Also a lot of these tests are from older batches of the formulation as many companies have been altering their formulas in the last few months. I wouldn't doubt that Five Pawns results are accurate.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bivay,SLIGHTLY_UPSETTING,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"First off I would recommend building an unregulated mod wired in parallel just to get the feel for building.  If you're building a regulated mod, like one with an SX330 chip, you won't need a mosfet or a resistor because the chip regulates everything.  If you were building an unregulated box, you would need a mosfet and resistor to protect your switch, which is only rated for a few amps."

Canadian_ecigarette,3bicmr,awkward10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:45:11 2015 UTC,Are you sure these are the proper coils for that particular tank? I haven't used a Genitank so can't speak for which ones are correct but there are many options available.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bicmr,Hubatola,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:07:30 2015 UTC,I'm sure they are the right ones because they're the same ones I used before. The kanger dual coils are the ones I'm using
Canadian_ecigarette,3bicmr,Hubatola,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:08:47 2015 UTC,I see. If it's reading zero ohms there is possibly a connection error or product malfunction. If the coils are new then they are likely (but not guaranteed) not the problem. Sometimes the pin on the iStick gets 'stuck'. Try gently prying it back into the mod and see if that helps. Do you have any other tanks you can try to see how they read on the iStick?
Canadian_ecigarette,3bicmr,Dervie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:18:05 2015 UTC,I think it's the pin on my istick as well because my tank worked on my friends mod. How would I go about fixing the pin? Someone told me I could try taking a screwdriver and try prying it up. Is that what I should try? I don't want to break it. I don't have any other tanks to test on my istick sadly
Canadian_ecigarette,3bicmr,Dervie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:35:11 2015 UTC,Do you still have your 510 adapter that came with your iStick kit? Try attaching that.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bicmr,Hubatola,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:39:35 2015 UTC,Oh I still have that. Thanks for the suggestion!

Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,jaymef,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:24:04 2015 UTC,Soon! I've been working on fruit loops flavors since i started mixing. I've just never nailed one down quite right. But soon :D
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,joshuaauger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:54:28 2015 UTC,They seem to be pretty tricky to get right! I've been researching diy and all the recipes for a good cereal juice have a ton of different flavours in them so I guess that's why a lot of people don't make it. It looks like something you'd have to spend a lot of time tweaking to get right.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,GoldenEarsVapours,2,Tue Jun 30 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"ya its really tweeky. And since it has so many flavors the generally require long steep times, and waiting 3 weeks before i can test a flavor slows down development time drastically."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,joshuaauger,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:16:32 2015 UTC,Huh I never even thought about the steeping time. No wonder not many people make this kind of juice and the ones who do charge more. It really does require way more thought and effort to get a finished quality result.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,joshuaauger,2,Wed Jul 1 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"messaged you, would like to order one of each flavor to try out thanks!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,joshuaauger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:24:11 2015 UTC,I gotcha :)

Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,joshuaauger,3,Mon Jun 29 19:29:52 2015 UTC,Over a liter of juice is being sent out today. So far I'm pretty busy :P As long as I can keep on track with the orders without much stress I don't plan on stopping any time soon. But I don't wanna cause myself to go crazy. There's surprisingly allot of steps that go into bulk mixing :P
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,joshuaauger,2,Mon Jun 29 19:48:11 2015 UTC,Upvoted!  I don't know why some people seem to get offended at someone selling well priced juice.
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,nanosec,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:46:08 2015 UTC,Some people just wanna watch our mods burn!
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,nanosec,2,Tue Jun 30 06:19:09 2015 UTC,"Got mine in, needs some steeping but loving the peaches and cream so far. Next order can you do double flavour for a few bucks more?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,SuminderJi,2,Mon Jul 6 22:43:41 2015 UTC,"Peachies definitely benefits from a few weeks steeping, but doesn't require it(at least in my opinion).  Double flavors is kinda a odd subject. I wouldn't feel comfortable doubling up peachies n cream because of how heavy the flavor base is, 2x flavor based on PC would end up with too much flavor and it would be very thin, harsh, and over powering. Some flavors like barrys cream could potentially work double flavor but may suffer the same over powering flavor. If you really feel like the flavor is lacking you can just note you'd like a extra shot and I'll bump it up to the highest I can mix the base without compromising the liquid, But again it wont be twice the flavoring because IMO it would ruin the ejuice.  Unless your intent is to be able to thin it with VG to make it go farther. In that case, my prices are already really low just buy 2 bottles and support development of further flavors :)  Side note: if your using a tank you will lose some flavor, PC is pretty bland i find on a subtank and all my flavors have been designed on and for drippers, although most of them do work nicely on tanks, they don't fully shine until you drip them."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,SuminderJi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"pretty bland i find on a subtank and all my flavors have been designed on and for drippers, although most of them   Actually I just got them and threw them on the dripper, P&C is pretty much as flavorful as I want, Grape as well it's the barry's cream and the dragons' toast that I find might be a bit low on the flavor. Might just be me adjusting I have to throw on some new cotton to see. Doing .6 ohm @ ~ 22W but I'll throw it on the vv mod* and bump the watts to see if it changes. Thanks V"
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,SuminderJi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:06:56 2015 UTC,"Both BC and DT are low flavor base, but i personally find them to have strong flavors. DT is very much a beta flavor right now and i'm been struggling to have it maintain some of the flavors after steeping. BC is a prime candidate for a flavor boost though."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,SuminderJi,2,Tue Jul 7 00:04:27 2015 UTC,"I like the DT, could do with something coca-ish in it and I think it would complement well."
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,SuminderJi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:11:47 2015 UTC,"Ya, it's been a learning curve :P it's my first real attempt at a non fruit flavor and every chocolate i've tried has been over powering and ruining the grahm, and the grahm has been my favorite part. I've got a few new chocolate flavors on the way though so hopefully I'll find the golden ticket!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3bh0ho,jaymef,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"Just threw them on the dripper on @60W and it was better. The peaches and cream, can't get enough of that."

Canadian_ecigarette,3bgd6i,tommytw0time,2,Mon Jun 29 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"I ordererd the mutation xv4 from him last night, its likely more of a cloud chasing rda than flavor.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bh6it,Winter_knights,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:43:57 2015 UTC,I would go with what everyone else is saying and get the Zephyrus. Only issue I see with it is losing that top rubber seal on the juice fill hole. But it's like a subtank crossed with a goblin. But I haven't seen the cost of the prebuilt coils yet. They seem like they could be expensive.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bfkyi,TheVaporist,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"Nah...PG is the gluten free. Just like gluten, everyone thinks they are sensitive to it, when in reality 1% of the population is.  Diacetyl is the glucose-fructose of the vape world. Its extremely bad for you and you know it (of so they say with diacetyl, we'll know eventually), is found in 80% of the flavors, but we still eat it and don't care."

Canadian_ecigarette,3bfkyi,TheVaporist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"Of course! The select few who are truly allergic to it benefit from the fad, which is great!

Canadian_ecigarette,3bfkyi,obzilla,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:38:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know about 1%, I think it's definitely more. I don't know if I'm allergic to it, but I know that more than just a little makes me feel like shit and I don't like it (PG that is, viva la gluten)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3bfkyi,damchini,2,Sun Jun 28 23:34:34 2015 UTC,I would suggest getting into DIY then. One of the main reasons I make my own juice is because I can actually look at a full MSDS list of what's in my juice. The Perfumers Apprentice lists everything that is in their flavorings.

The DX versions of some concentrates don't have those molecules but really taste bad.  Assume there is some in every flavor you vape. Until the verdict is out (not within the next few years), we don't even know if it truly is harmful. Just be moderate.  And just to make it clear...Vaping is NOT safe! Inhaling anything other than oxygen is bad. Period!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3bfkyi,downvotemeufags,2,Mon Jun 29 01:31:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, Oxygen (O2) can be deadly. The air we breath contains many different elements (other than Oxygen) that can also be considered 'bad', depending on context.  As such, I don't feel as bad about vaping :D"

I love fruit flavours and this one just blew my face off. It's the newest review on the page but i'll post it. It's passionfruit candy basically. Very sweet. Very delighful. Try it!! She is awesome, will be ordering more from her soon.  ""I don't even know how to describe this amazing juice. I got my first order from here a little over a week ago, and just got the chance to throw this into my dripper. If you like flavourful fruity candy juices, this one has taken the cake for me. It's so good i wish to bathe in it and sacrifice small animals to appease the cloud 69 gods, then take a draw and get a lightning bolt right to the face. If you're going to try any juice, make it this one. Worth every penny."""

Going to get a bigger bottle next time. they do a free 30ml once per week per order and a 10ml sample. So you could certainly make it your sample to give it a try

Fusionflavours gets mentioned as being good (although any time I go to their web site I can't find the nic so I give up). allecigsolutions is 'ok' (once again, I dislike recommending them, but if you are hard up they do sell it.) a couple new places were mentioned here a while ago (forget their names, but a search for ""nic base"" would probably pull up those posts)   There unfortunately has yet to be a vendor that everyone can point to and say ""THAT's where you go for good quality affordable nic base.""

Hydavape has decent 100mg base in pg or vg but it has a slight color and smell to it, undetectable in a flavored mix. Sites confusing, customer serves isn't the greatest.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bcs2l,anxdiety,0,Sun Jun 28 03:05:16 2015 UTC,If really tight and you need a lot of juice. Pick up some 24mg juice at your local shop. Then get some VG from the local pharmacy. You can turn a 15ml of 24mg into  30ml of 12mg 60ml of 6mg 120ml of 3mg 240ml of 1.5mg  Just by doubling the amounts with VG.

Canadian_ecigarette,3bakf1,ilikeycoffee,2,Sat Jun 27 10:29:49 2015 UTC,"Phil, after getting information in his youtube comments on his eVic-VT from Joyetech review, discovered a serious flaw in the eVic. Apparently when in wattage mode, if you fire your atty after a) changing attys, b) coming back from the 3-min sleep mode, or c) power it off or on, it will fire at 30+w in a surge for up to .6 seconds. Several early adopters have reported getting burnt coils, burnt wicks, burnt tasting vapes.   I usually vape in around the 20-22W area with kanthal, so this is not good for my style of vaping, and obviously a serious flaw in the eVic. What makes it even more of a flaw is that Joyetech didn't make this eVic-VT firmware upgradeable, which could have easily fixed the problem.  I have a pre-order in with Happy Vapor, which hasn't shipped yet. I just cancelled that order via email (or at least I hope they will honor the cancel and refund my CC)."

Canadian_ecigarette,3bakf1,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:12:12 2015 UTC,Lowering your airflow setting to the min would help increase the heat as well as the draw strength you wouldn't get as much vapor but could replicate the mouth to lung better.

Canadian_ecigarette,3b9arw,Catmandingo,5,Sat Jun 27 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"Fuck Canadian! I know, blasphemy right. Well, I founded this reddit so pretty sure I'm not anti-Canadian :P   But there is no point buying flavourant in Canada if you ask me. Canadian vendors charge you $4-5 for what US vendors charge $1.6.  And while that may not seem like a HUGE difference, when you factor in buying a lot of different flavors its a big deal. It means you can buy 5 flavors from a Can vendor, or 15 from a US vendors for the same price.   I mean, for the amount you'll spend to get 10ml from a Canadian vendor you could spend LESS and get 30ml from a US vendor.   Case in point:   30ml of a FW flavor off ecigexpress AFTER a 30% exchange rate is $4.35 cents.  The vendors mentioned in this thread charge that much or MORE for 10ml   Plus, shipping costs are the same ordering from the US.   My suggestion would be to look at some US sites and keep your eyes peeled for a sale as well.   As for nic base, we've yet (to my knowledge) to find a Can vendor with universally positive reviews."

Canadian_ecigarette,3b9arw,TSmashVapes,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"ya, especially for DIY newbies the key is trying lots of flavors as cheaply as possible.  Even if you get recommendations for flavors at /r/diy_ejuice you'll still want to try 20+ flavor at least.   So if you get 10ml for $1.66 thats around $30 (for 20 flavors). But if you pay $4.50 with a CDN vendor, that's $90 bucks.  Price difference is significant."

I passed on some juices early in my vaping life that I now know didn't get the proper opportunity to steep.   I now try to wait a few weeks before initially trying (not always, I am super impatient) and always go back to at a later date. Patience is indeed a virtue with juices."

Canadian_ecigarette,3b937q,kintyre,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:23:08 2015 UTC,Yep and depends on the juice as well some juices I like it right around 37-40 and some 24 is more than enough.

Make sure you wet your cotton a bit with the juice before you start vaping. Another tip the guy who sold me gave was to start at a low wattage, like around 10 and then work up. High nic juice (above 9 mg) I vape between 10 and 15 watts. Lower nic juices I generally vape around 18-22 watts."

I know the TwistedMesses RDA has a single coil option and quad post, the Royal Hunter does too I believe. There's quite a fewquad post options out there and most have a single coil airflow option"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e6g,Awesummzzz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:41:05 2015 UTC,why not upgradeto the X v4?
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e6g,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:19:51 2015 UTC,Have you had any issues with yours? I've been eyeballing the v4 but those bottom airflow holes make me nervous about leakage.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e6g,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:45:57 2015 UTC,"0 leakage while vaping for me, i unwick mine before storing though, just because i dont like old juice being out overnight or such and a new wick is always nice in the mornings."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e6g,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:02:08 2015 UTC,Any issues with resistance jumping around on your istick? Also where did you get yours from?

Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e6g,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"Got mine 2 days ago from JGVapes. If you use the bottom airflow, expect leakage. You can't just drip in it, it WILL leak, you have to paint on the coil. Else if you just want to ""chuck clouds"", plug the bottom holes (assuming they come with one, I got the authentic)  Else it's a very nice piece. I like it. Taste is good, but not veritas good;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e6g,karmapopsicle,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:01:18 2015 UTC,"This could actually be why I don't have leakage, I prefer a smaller wick in mine rather then just stuffing the base, and almost always paint my wicks with it; I drip almost exclusively when I'm watching tv, so for me to take a second to just wait the wick isn't a big deal."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e6g,WhiteRussian13,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"Do you want something more on the flavour side, or do you prefer trading flavour for huge clouds?"

In defence of our nicotine pricing, if you compare our pricing with another vendor's in this review - VaperBC, you will find that ours is cheaper and in addition to that you almost automatically are qualified for free shipping with your purchase. Finally, Reddit users can use discount code ""REDDIT"" for 10% off.  All in all, it does not sound too bad, does it?"

I've run group buys at Nude and I've also sold a few bottles of it to DIYers in Canada. I don't see myself doing that much anymore, the first few bottles sold fast but the last couple were slow."

Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,Tramd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:13:06 2015 UTC,Ohm lock on the evic.  The temp of the coil will not change the resistance.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,Tramd,2,Sun Jun 28 04:03:40 2015 UTC,"Should it do that at all anyway? But woah, really?   I mean the resistance shouldn't change at all unless something is wrong. But on my subtank it constantly jumps unless I have it tightened or positioned jussssssssssst right."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,Tramd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:12:38 2015 UTC,Nickel jumps all over with the different temperatures.  Kanthal should not do it so much.  What are you running?
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,Tramd,2,Sun Jun 28 04:15:47 2015 UTC,"At the moment I went for a higher build than usual. 28g kanthal with 7/8 wraps micro coil fashion. Aiming for 1.5 ish, stable at 1.7 on my subtank. However it will jump to 2+ and back down once fired regularly. I had the same issue with even the stock prebuilt coils. This is on a istick 50W. My russian is fine though.   Seems very finicky."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,dienah13,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:26:16 2015 UTC,Just for shits and giggles you should throw a clapton or a braided build in there.  I did a 26/30 clapton in mine and it was awesome.  Took a bit to cool down but the flavour was on point.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,Awesummzzz,2,Sun Jun 28 04:33:46 2015 UTC,"I really should. I don't own a drill though...  I've been wanting to try a vertical coil for shits and giggles though. Such a deep deck for where the coil mounts seems to invite it.   I see I wrote ""for shits and giggles"" not even realising you used it as well, since it's something I would say anyway. The power of subliminal suggestion!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,majorvapes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:38:03 2015 UTC,Vertical clapton is the last build I had before the nickel.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,Awesummzzz,2,Sun Jun 28 04:51:37 2015 UTC,What is all that around your tank? O-rings?
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,majorvapes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:31:58 2015 UTC,Correct.  Works quite well and I get them for free.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b8qwm,Awesummzzz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:12:07 2015 UTC,Twisted up some 28g nickel and crammed as much as I could in the subtank mini rba.  Damn does it ever vape nice.

Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,KapnKroniK,2,Sat Jun 27 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"For 89ish dollars your best bet would be a smok m80+ from /u/eastcoastvape  http://www.eastcoastvape.ca/product-p/m80.htm  The shipping and taxes will bring you slightly over 80.   Your options are really limited, as most of the other mods would have required you to buy separate batteries and a charger aswell driving the price up a fair bit."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:44:03 2015 UTC,The iPV Mini 2 is 70w. The Smok m80 comes to mind. Also the Sigelei 100w+ and 150w. What's your budget?
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,Awesummzzz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"these are the ones that came to my mind aswell, budget is important as batteries have to be factored into most mods and charger."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,CuBu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:43:18 2015 UTC,I'm looking at about 80 bucks with some wiggle room.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,Awesummzzz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:43:50 2015 UTC,"You could probably find the iPV Mini 2 for around there. The Sigelei's are at about $100 and above so that's a little too high. Not sure the price on the Smok M80 though, also has some failures but I think the issues were resolved"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,morbidangel27,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"If you only got about 80 bucks to work with, try the smok m80 from canvape or eastcoastvape. Both roughly around that price, I would go with ECV because they're pretty awesome when it comes to customer service. You wont be able to afford a sig 150, or and ipv mini because you need a charger, and batteries. which will run you 40 bucks by itself, or more."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,n-senada,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:50:30 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely suggest the ipv mini 2 as a solid device. though, I've never taken it above 30watts (regularly). that's a lot of watts. you probably don't need that many watts, really."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b9e0y,TheVaporist,3,Sat Jun 27 06:58:46 2015 UTC,"Reminder for the mini 2, it is not a buck device! This means you can't hit a voltage lower than your current battery level. Important factor to take in consideration."

Those are the two that jump out at me but hopefully someone a bit more involved in the business side of the industry could chime in :)  Please keep us posted if this turns out, I for one would be thrilled to try your juice, but the combination of shipping cost/shipping times & customs horror stories has me wary of ordering from out of the country."

Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,The_Stiffness,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:53:51 2015 UTC,This is key on the subtank. Less cotton is favourable and you MUST clear it back from the juice channels so it can allow the juice into the chamber properly.  Hopefully their version 2 of the RBA helps with most of these known issues.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Hubatola,2,Fri Jun 26 09:47:16 2015 UTC,"A few things could make it taste burnt. If you have a hot spot or hot legs, if your cotton isn't making good contact with your coils or you're not wicking fast enough to keep up with the coil.   Pull it apart check it for hot spots/hot legs.  Rewick it and make sure you got enough cotton but not too much. Lastly try not screwing the chimney base all the way down when you put it back together. It will help the juice get to the wicks better."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,majorvapes,2,Fri Jun 26 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"managed to make it work, thanks yall :) EDIT: nevermind I was wrong, I have a feeling it's because i'm missing a bit of cotton on one of the side, I been burning it and I feel like it's really only burning on 1 side so i'll replace the cotton for a new 1"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,TheVaporist,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:08:41 2015 UTC,"Grats on the first build!  The cotton can be tricky, but with time you'll get the feel of it.  I'd recommend you lower the wattage to 15W at first to get used to it. See how long it takes for the wick to dry out (with less power you lower your dry hit chances and get a better feel of when it is about to happen). Figure out a config where you can chain vape. Then start upping the voltage gradually.  Remember..practice makes perfect :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Sliparoon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:38:14 2015 UTC,I've found that 15-18 is the sweet spot for that rba base.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Gathax,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"The subtank mini RBA has been known to cause dry hit issues. The juice channels are just too tiny for especially high VG liquids.  Try the ""pancake"" wicking method. I've been using this method ever since I saw the vid, and it's been mostly successful for me besides the occasional failure I still encounter.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpaCa2o9DE"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,vi0lent,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:51:14 2015 UTC,I used to have that problem too. People say it's because of the small holes so I started using less cotton.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Lampburglar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:56:04 2015 UTC,"Also, file the juice channels larger with a small traingle shaped single cut file. It worked miracles for mine."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Hubatola,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:53:56 2015 UTC,Howdy Lampburglar! Is there a particular size file you used or would recommend? I don't own any and would need to buy one. I am very tempted to try this but also concerned about screwing up the threading near the channels.
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Lampburglar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:25:26 2015 UTC,It's just a small triangular shaped file. Nothing too big. Worked perfect for me anyway. I think most people use the triangle shape. Just gotta make sure you keep rounding it out and not file it into a triangle lol.

I got a good one in there now a pretty thick piece of cotton but cut down like pancake method it seems to be doing ok. best feeding build I've had so far hope I can do it again :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Lampburglar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:02:33 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha well the idea was to make it bigger,as long as you achieved that than that is all that matters my man."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4wyo,Jadall7,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:29:31 2015 UTC,I will eventually get a knock off clearomizer version to try out with the new rba head and a new style rba head I'll try on my current one. Along with o ring set and some other gadgetry from FT I guess. My thicker cotton seems to be doing alright in my magma but I built it a little too high ohm for my mech mod. But it was too hot at .3 ohm and seems to be a little too weak on .4. maybe switch to smaller wire a quicker heat up time I think I need.

I have one bottle that's been steeped about 3 months now - simply incredible!  For those of you looking for larger bottles of Vapemeet juices: about once a month they offer 120 ml ones for $50. You probably want to join the Facebook page or keep an eye on their website as it happens quickly and usually ends in a day or two."

I find I can't use it as an all day vape, I'll go out for break and the first hit is harsh, few hits later I can barely taste it - unless I'm drinking milk. Milk makes the flavor absolutely explode."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b499f,Robbie-R,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:27:12 2015 UTC,Yeah i've vaped morning glory for days and i know exactly what you mean. Yes it will lose almost all flavour rather quickly but like you said enjoy it with milk or for me coffee!

I haven't loved any cereals yet I think because of the citrus. OMC (as my taste buds have come back) is really one that I enjoy. Mild but tasty. Great review and much appreciated!

Yes the 4nine gets its name from the size of it in its smallest configuration (49mm), but it should still come with 2 extentions, 1 for an 18500 + another for 18650."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4e2c,CuBu,3,Thu Jun 25 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review!  I'd definitely like to add, all my flavors are ever evolving, I don't wanna get stuck in a rut after all.  Couple comments to shed some light on your comments and concerns:  Peachies N Cream - This flavor imo is a love hate relationship, its my personal ADV and something I really enjoy. However I've never once enjoyed it on my subtank as the cream is truly muted with a tank, Put it on a dripper and 65+ watts and the cream starts to come out much more, over 100 watts and the flavor changes dramatically it's pretty neat. Something I've been trying to narrow down is the perfect cream base for it, and it's still something I'm not 100% satisfied with.EDIT: I've wondered if peachies n cream is the wrong name for it, because it's not what you'd expect when you read the name peachies n cream, it was just the best thing my dull mind could create when I named it :P And yeah the peach in it is a bit more candy like then real peach, I love fuzzy peaches so that's where my inspiration came from  Barry's cream is pretty conflicting. It's got a very diverse and heavy flavor base so the end result is almost distinguishable from any one fruit. But i will say you bang on with one of the main flavors being raspberry.  Your thoughts on tainted grape are pretty much bang on what I wanted the flavor to be. It's nothing super special but has a special place in my flavor rotation.  Midnight blues definitely appeals to the menthol crowd, although it doesn't contain any menthol i feel like those who enjoy menthol juices are more likely to enjoy it. But its in very early beta form so it may change very drastically in the coming months.  Bottles may change in the future, however it's hard for me to find the right bottle since I don't want to sell 30ml or 60ml bottles. Not many bottles come in 50ml variants. What I may do since you mentioned it is find a alternative tip for my bottles and include both the snub and a smaller tip for those who prefer it. But i suppose if you wanted you could order just the tip... No? bad joke? okay....  I mix in bases, so my flavors blend together for about a week before mixed with nicotine and vg when the order is received, steeping times are generally pretty low on my mixes I find, peachies n cream benefits from 2-3 weeks i find though.  Just want to note to, I am officially taking orders again I just haven't posted my for sale thread again (happening tonight or tomorrow) and I'll be releasing my new flavor 'Dragons Toast' a toasted smore mix I've been having a love affair with for the past 2 weeks. If anyone's interested to order you can PM me directly with what you'd like to order along with your paypal email and I'll shoot you a invoice. Shipping is a flat fee of $14 unless you in alberta and then its $10. If I sell out again I'll be surprised because I have 4 liters of vg and 150 bottles on hand for this sale!  phew... okay I'll stop talking now.... Don't get me talking about juice... I can talk about juice for days..."

Fast shipping and excellent communication.  I received the juices just before I went away on holiday (thanks for rushing them to me) and had been meaning to also do a review upon my return.   I had pretty much an identical user experience as /u/CuBu, except I haven't tried the grape. I very much like the flavour mixing of the juices and overall subtler tones. Nothing too fancy but overall a near perfect blending and not an 'in our face' flavouring like a lot of juices these days. Which was a refreshing change. I have been vaping Peachies N Cream almost daily (for a flavour change) but really like Midnight Blues. It seems a bit more complex than the others and I seem to find something different every time I use it. Higher wattages definitely bring out different attributes.  Good job /u/Vendetta44! Exceptional juices for the price. I look forward to your new flavours!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3b4273,NerdyNThick,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:56:46 2015 UTC,"Have you ordered from them before?  Do they import 0nic and add their own?  Is their nic quality?  I am just wondering why they're almost half the price as MBV from Dashvapes ($33 for 120ml).  Are costs being cut somewhere?  I've been through hundreds of juices over the years, and I always come back to the dirt cheap brands as an ADV."
Canadian_ecigarette,3b4273,Iamjmax,2,Fri Jun 26 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yes I've ordered from them a few times. I'm assuming they import 0mg juice and add their own nic in house. Nic seems good though in my opinion. Haven't noticed any cons with it.   The only catch is, you can only get a set vg/pg ratio (65vg/35pg if memory serves) and no options for extra flavour shots. I know dashvapes allows you to customize your vg/pg levels.  Hope this helps."

Canadian_ecigarette,3b10ji,CanadianLatitude,2,Thu Jun 25 06:15:45 2015 UTC,"Evaperated has 140ml bottles, if you buy a 3 pack it's a really decent price ($140) and the juice is well loved here.   Of the 4 I've tried, I personally loved Mana Biscuit, Blue Sky is pretty popular but I only enjoyed it sparingly, Patient Zero is a solid vanilla custard and Alpha Blood is an interesting caramel pear, but a bit on the sweeter side of things.   The Muffin Man by One Hit Wonder is phenomenal to me, tastes like an apple cinnamon muffin, but only sold in 180ml bottles and is an 80VG juice. I picked one up from NYX and have no regrets, and I believe Dashvapes carry it as well ($79.99)  Vapor North sells 100 ml bottles and Lullaby and L'Anse Amour from their new premium line are both delicious. The former a nice summery Strawberry and Cream, the latter a honeydew & pear that I could drink if I didn't know better.   I believe the Vaporist now sells larger bottles of their line as well. I still need to try their Grape Escape and Apricot but I haven't been disappointed by anything from them yet. Would recommend if you enjoy fruity flavours!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3b10ji,Popeye_needs_spinach,2,Thu Jun 25 03:22:00 2015 UTC,Alpha Blood is probably my favorite juice ever.

Canadian_ecigarette,3awpzn,kurtiscaston,3,Wed Jun 24 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"MVP, MVP, MVP. There are other mods, but if you're between those two...MVP!  The majority of vapers don't need to rebuild at any point, but I'd still say you might be better off future-proofing yourself with the ST Mini vs. the Nano. The option of the RBA insert is there, at least. And, while you do prefer a smaller tank capacity, you're not forced to fill the ST Mini completely every time...but if you choose it over the Nano, you'll always have the extra space there if you need/want it at some point. While many vapers won't get into wrapping their own coils, having the option is an excellent idea. Many of us said we would never get into rebuildables, but later discovered the perks and never went back.  Also, don't forget to grab a juice sampler with your order. I prefer the high-VG versions of Hidden Dragon and Grape Escape, but no matter which you choose, the free shipping is an awesome deal and a great perk of ordering from The Vaporist!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3awpzn,kootenaygal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:12:11 2015 UTC,Another vote here for the MVP!
Canadian_ecigarette,3awpzn,thumpx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:26:37 2015 UTC,Just a quick piece of advice..if you don't like warmer vapes stay away from the nano. It doesn't have as much airflow so you can't get the vapor as cool as you would with the mini.
Canadian_ecigarette,3awpzn,Lampburglar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:08:35 2015 UTC,I'd go with the mini. I swore if never rebuild. I loved the convenience of pre fab coils. I got through 7 coils before I broke out the RBA. Now I'm strictly using an RTA. So much more control over your coils and wicks. I found the pre fab coils weren't great. They didn't wick well enough and dry hit to often.
Canadian_ecigarette,3awpzn,SuminderJi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:40:03 2015 UTC,"MVP like others have said, they are built really well.  Subtank Mini though you don't have to fill it up fully you can vape 3ml at a time but the RBA section is extremely useful.  You may be fine with buying coils but its always good to have an option and trust me its very very easy to build on that deck.  In fact they toss you a couple of coils with one installed which could theoretically last you months on months just by rewicking every week or so and you'll save a bunch in the long run."

Canadian_ecigarette,3avpw6,BassFeuille,2,Tue Jun 23 21:53:01 2015 UTC,What vg% is your juice? Might also have better luck with the newer vertical coils if you are using high vg juice. As for the older coils you can poke a hole in the cotton to help wicking.
Canadian_ecigarette,3avpw6,neveroutgunned,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:12:54 2015 UTC,Mix between 70/30 (vg/pg) and 60/40.  http://i60.tinypic.com/287ztyd.jpg <<< coil i'm using rn

Canadian_ecigarette,3avpw6,karmapopsicle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:41:59 2015 UTC,Just read on the coil ( 15-30W ) Guess they're not built to go more than 30W which is maybe why It starts to taste like shit at 26.6W haha :D?
Canadian_ecigarette,3avpw6,TheVaporist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"Best thing you can do is take a pin or a small screwdriver and tweak the wicking from the ports on the sides. The reason it starts tasting burnt is because the wicking can't keep up with the power.   Alternatively, until the much improved vertical coils become more generally available swap your mod to wattage mode (three quick clicks) and run it around 22-23w or so."
Canadian_ecigarette,3avpw6,AFC9,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:59:52 2015 UTC,"I read that if you take a pin or whatever and run it through the middle of the cotton through the other side would help, but I fucked up my cotton/wire thingy really badly everything is moved now and I just have so many holes now in my coil and barely any cotton left on the sides of the coil and every time I take a puff there's a crap ton of liquids falling out my vape haha, Vaped for maybe 5 minutes seeing if the cotton would fall back in place but had no chance, had to clean my vape like 10 times and put some more liquids twice ( 2 full 7ml tanks ) because of the liquid loss. I'll try to fix the coil later but for now i'm using their 1.2-1.3 ohm coil"
Canadian_ecigarette,3avpw6,dienah13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah some people take a pin and poke through the middle, but I find just gently poking through the holes to make divots on both sides tends to do the trick with minimal chance of issues."

Canadian_ecigarette,3auwsj,eakin01,2,Tue Jun 23 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"It's because VTC4's are 30a continuous while VTC5's are really 20a. VTC5's have less sag and higher mAh, but aren't really meant to be pushed to 30a continuously; they can handle it but it'll ruin the battery faster."
Canadian_ecigarette,3auwsj,saient,2,Wed Jun 24 00:15:26 2015 UTC,VTC5s have slightly more sag than the VTC4s due to higher internal resistance.
Canadian_ecigarette,3auwsj,karmapopsicle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:00:47 2015 UTC,Ahhh okay thanks! 25r's have really low internal resistance too right?
Canadian_ecigarette,3auwsj,saient,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:07:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty low, yes, but slightly more than the VTC4/5."
Canadian_ecigarette,3auwsj,karmapopsicle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:12:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on what better means. I think I remember reading about them either having higher total amp output, or that the sag performance was better. I can't remember which, but at the end of the day the VTC5 has more mAh, and hits pretty high when it comes to the amps. Hopefully someone else has the details on that, but indeed I remember there was at least one spec where the VTC4 was better. It probably depend on what you are doing. In a regulated mod the 5s should be better due to more capacity in general."

In any case the cells we're getting in are going to be shipped out to an independent battery expert for testing to make sure they meet specifications, if not they won't be sold and that's okay too.

Seems to be par for the course though, I think it always trips Montreal early on the tracker due to the amount of transfers from USPS to CP they get there."

I pretty much exclusively vape their juices because I haven't found another good juice company in Canada yet.   Funny story: a few MONTHS ago I had an order from MBV refused and I just got the letter yesterday. At first I was confused and then I remembered I never got any notice from the border about it.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aut7m,tedsmitts,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:16:24 2015 UTC,Customs is definitely learning - better to shop from vendors in Canada who import. I think Dashvapes carries some Mt Baker products.

Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,Vendeta44,2,Tue Jun 23 05:14:01 2015 UTC,I just started enjoying your Barrys Cream.  Its good! A decent mix of fruits (kinda a fruit punch) but a bit heavy on the peach.  Which I don't mind just its similar to your Peaches 'n' Cream.   If you could whip up something like Forbidden (from 705) (green apple and strawberry) you'd have a customer for life...or until I get sick of it.
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,SuminderJi,2,Tue Jun 23 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"Phantom peach syndrome.  Idk why but that's the second feedback of peach in Barrys cream and I swear there isn't a drop of peach in it lol  And I have experimented with any apple ejuice yet, I'm not a huge fan of apples so it never really occurred to me.  Next flavor order I'll be sure to order some apple flavors and tinker."
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,SuminderJi,2,Tue Jun 23 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"A tart flavour with green apple, pear and strawberry."
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,SuminderJi,2,Tue Jun 23 21:30:24 2015 UTC,I'll see what I can do _^
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,SuminderJi,2,Tue Jun 23 21:45:18 2015 UTC,Can't wait.  I loved Peaches and Cream btw.  I'll be getting that again off you.
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,TheVaporist,2,Tue Jun 23 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"Glad ya liked it :) peachies has defiantly been my most well received mix, when I'm vaping it I'll go through easy 120ml in a week or two.. Haven't had it in two weeks tho, been betaing a new flavor ""Dragon Toast"" it's a bit off the beaten path of my normal fruit flavors and is very reminiscent of a smore. It's really good so far but I feel like its missing something. I wish there was a carmel or butterscotch flavoring that didn't taste awful lol"
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,TheVaporist,2,Tue Jun 23 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"Don't get me started on caramel and butterscotch.  Either they are wayyy too strong or taste like chemicals.  Not to mention the flavour stays for days.  Dripped for a hour or so and even with changing the cotton it wouldn't go away, and I always dry burn before changing the wick.  Had to change he whole coil."
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,downvotemeufags,2,Tue Jun 23 22:47:43 2015 UTC,Yup. It's a shame to because there such awesome flavors they just don't work in eliquid
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,SLIGHTLY_UPSETTING,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:58:06 2015 UTC,Been slowly amassing flavors over the past few weeks and I've finally hit my goal. There's close to 200 50ml bottles in the box besides the flavoring and the VG and nicotine to fill em :) V-juice is finally back in stock and ready to take orders!
Canadian_ecigarette,3asqem,SLIGHTLY_UPSETTING,2,Tue Jun 23 05:19:33 2015 UTC,"Sexy!  I would tell you which bases you should add but then I'd have to vape you ;)  Your next order try the non-DX Bavarian and taste that acetoin difference!! (check your pms!)  Only thing that makes me cringe is that USP label on the VG. Unless they simply slap their sticker on top of a sealed bottle, it's not USP. As soon as the container is opened, it loses its USP rating."

The 4 liter bottle I ordered just comes in a over sized milk jug lol. Obviously, I don't and have never claimed to mix in a lab room clean enviroment and I've tried to make that very clear to anyone who buys my juice. If I keep buying in this volume however I'll probably be inclined to source out my own USP grade supplier."

Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,_Nymphae,2,Mon Jun 22 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"Vapenjuice play hers.  Its a tobacco flavour that's my AWV.  Yes thats right all week vape.  For some reason, I can keep vaping this and rarely have to switch flavours due to getting too used it.  And it's cheap too. Get it at canvape.  My other non sweet juice that is like crack to me is green leaf by liquid ejuice premium listed here.  It lists it as menthol and even though I like menthol it barely has any if at all.  This is a juice that also smells amazing.  Any time I vape it people who don't vape or smoke comment on how good it smells.  You can get that here:  www.theecigflavourium.com/ejuice-1.html  But I've been spending too much on juice lately and taking a second crack at making juice myself.  But I've only made good strawberry and apple that's ok.  The supposedly tobacco flavours I bought are awful.  We need a Canadian clone thread.  If anyone can clone the above I would be eternally grateful.  How do people even begin to clone a flavour?  Are they cooks by profession and already use flavours in their work?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,sark666,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:33:24 2015 UTC,You can get that here: www.theecigflavourium.com/ejuice-1.html   No online store?
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,sark666,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:13:07 2015 UTC,I believe this is that juice makers online site  liquidejuice.com/product/green-leaf/  Just curious have you cloned juices or just wanted to try it.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,sark666,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to try, still looking for that perfect ADV.   Bought some flavourless after work today, honestly I think it might do the trick better than anything else. I'm mostly just looking for good consistent throat hit, something not too overpowering...EVERYTHING seems to be all about the sweetness or rich flavouring, I just want something I can ignore, if that makes sense. I never really ""liked"" the taste of cigarettes, just put up with it to get my throat hit. After a while you just ignore the taste, I did anyway. I find that a lot harder with all this sweet crap."
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,groovejumper,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not really into sweet either. And no ejuice actually tastes like cigarettes, none that I tried anyway.

Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,Gottovape,2,Tue Jun 23 03:11:25 2015 UTC,"Black cherry and pomegranate shouldn't be very sweet, black cherry for sure isn't sweet at all. Honeydew is very mild and is more fragrant than sweet."
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:43:38 2015 UTC,I actually don't know if that flavor description is at all accurate. The description at my local b&m describes it as an apple Danish. I find it tastes like the Apple Pie shot you would order at the bar. Nice full smooth apple flavor with a hint of cinnamon and vanilla. So far my favourite flavour I've tried exactly because it isn't overly sweet. Pairs beautifully with my morning coffee.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:58:36 2015 UTC,Try some custard flavors. There not to sweet.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:03:42 2015 UTC,"I've tried G-Money from DSV which is a very popular ADV.  Has a really nice peppery quality on the exhale, but waay too sweet, kind of put me off of custard flavours."
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:27:12 2015 UTC,If you like non sweet juices you might want to check out the Electric City line from Mojo Vapes. I did a review if you want to check it out.   I found them to be mature flavours that aren't overly sweet at all. Definitely worth checking out http://www.mojovapes.ca.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,dienah13,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"I was looking at those last week, some of the descriptions are annoying as hell, they expect you to take a chance on a 30ml bottle of something and they can't even give you a simple description of the flavour?  I like the sound of the ""Just Right"" one, but seriously....this is how they describe it:  Everyone’s reaction to trying I Shan’t Tell for the first time is “What is this?  It’s damn good!”.  What is it?  Pretty darn good e-juice.  Not too sweet, not too fruity, not too anything; an adult vape for adult tastes.  You want to be trying this one in different atomizers and at different wattages.  Yeah but what the fuck does it taste like?  Edit: Reviewers are often no better lol - this is the review on the page for that juice:   I have no idea how to describe this but I can say its pretty damn delicious. Its a taste i recognise but I just can't put my finger on where I recognise it from. Defiantly worth a taste test. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Might just be your new all day vape."
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,Mango2013,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:58:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I have to agree I'm not a fan of ambiguous descriptions or 'blends'. I like to taste what it's supposed to taste like and not guess. I couldn't really add anymore to that description either unfortunately but overall they were pretty good juices.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,kkeeiiggaann,2,Tue Jun 23 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"Your reviews were good, appreciate the link. Might try a couple of them out at some point, still looking for that perfect light ADV. Any thoughts on Jokesmoke Classic from Mojovapes?

Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,VaporNorth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:27:14 2015 UTC,Sorry I have yet to try any of Jugheads stuff but I hear it's pretty different. A sort of tobacco effect without any actual tobacco.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arddg,ZorroElite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm curious because tons of people say it's a perfect ADV. You see tobacco sometimes, other times people say cotton candy, like wtf? Probably gonna take a chance on it at some point."
Canadian_ecigarette,3arjpa,Lampburglar,2,Mon Jun 22 22:50:53 2015 UTC,You'd be better off with a delta 2. Honestly the mega is one of the worst performing tanks I've tried yet. Just posted a 'fix'.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arjpa,majorvapes,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"Delta is the much better tank, especially considering the Rba options. Enquirer about the coils coming with the delta, if it's the nickel / titanium it's a fairly alright deal.   Not like the best deal in the world as to be expected from a local shop today I got the kit with ego one, and a pack of 5 delta 2 nickel coils for just under 150 with shipping.   Edit. To expand they definitely ordered the express kit, but they make titanium and nickel could for the delta 2 as well and a overstock of them wouldn't be a bad thing and they're a top tank to have."
Canadian_ecigarette,3arjpa,CuBu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:11:25 2015 UTC,Way too overpriced. Saw it in Toronto for 120. Full kit. 95 for just the vw battery.
Canadian_ecigarette,3arjpa,doobie83,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:06:01 2015 UTC,That price is definitely on the high side. vapemeet.ca is selling the complete kit for $99.00. They do free shipping on $120.00 orders so you can order a couple bottles of juice with it and get it shipped to you for less money.

I don't care about waiting for shipments, I never let myself get that low on juice. Phil's price on samplers is almost unbeatable. Vapor North's bulk pricing is really good and their Lullaby is on my ADV shelf next to Tree of Life and Custard Accents. I haven't tried SZ Vapors line yet, but I plan to. I'll be having a 2000000000L bottle of Tree Of Life first though."

I'm not familiar with TC mods but I've had to turn my airflow down before for juices that were just too thin/low in flavour"
Canadian_ecigarette,3ardnw,CuBu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:02:47 2015 UTC,Yup even down to a tiny pinhole and mouth to lung hitting like crazy. 50/50 worked a bit better too but I like higher vg. This little fix seems to help a bit but really the flavour is pretty weak still so barely worth it. Get way better performance out of nearly any other tank.
Canadian_ecigarette,3ardnw,CuBu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:18:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's a shame, I was hoping to at least get a spare tank out of it, I got one today should be here sometime this week, I decided on getting delta TC coils, but was hoping I could use this as a spare but I use max vg juices because I'm sensitive to PG to much 50/50 can even have a bad effect on me."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,ijoijo,2,Mon Jun 22 17:42:00 2015 UTC,Similar has happened to my lullaby I've got 45 ml that seems almost dead I can't get any flavour from low wattages for some reason and have to really restrict my airflow and crank my watts to get a little bit of taste.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,Lampburglar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:39:06 2015 UTC,No steeping here and I got loads of flavor from all of them.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,Hubatola,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:59:57 2015 UTC,Same. Just blew through 50 ml's each of Lullaby and Lady M within the last two weeks. No noticeable flavour change.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,joekerr37,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"steeping won't increase flavor. What it can do (in rare occasions) is some flavors that are too strong will calm down a bit and taste a bit different.   Given cubu is reporting the same thing, it's possible someone made a mistake when mixing the juice up. Flavourant is usually 10-15% of the juice, so if someone accidentally calculated 5% instead of 10% then you'd have a batch that tasted very weak."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,raisedbytuttles,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:43:45 2015 UTC,"Got the new lineup from a giveaway, max vg lullaby around 32W .5ohm on my cthulhu was the best flavour wise. 80/20 l'anse amor around 25W. Both tasted better after a week, ADV for sure. The other three flavours are unvapable for me going on 3 weeks."

Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,RobertDF902,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:22:19 2015 UTC,It was may 18th. They were sending the sample packs along with it too. Funny thing is I just tasted the lullaby sample and it has waaay more flavour than the actual bottle I ordered.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,CuBu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:45:09 2015 UTC,Mine was May 21st awfully close in dates perhaps there was a error in the mixing of the liquids around that date or an error in the flavour concentrate by /u/vapornorth

Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,sansaset,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:43:32 2015 UTC,I bought a 120ml of L'anse Amour and had the same issue.  First 3/4 of the bottle were fucking fantastic but when I got down to about 40ish ml the flavor became muted and nasty. I was vaping it straight out the bottle and it tasted great but now after steeping it nearly 2 weeks it's only getting worse :(
Canadian_ecigarette,3aqej9,x-manowar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:24:46 2015 UTC,I just got an order in the other day and everything tastes like I assume it should. If anything its getting better as Lady M grows on me. Wasn't fond of it the first go round.

It's my first white mod ever and it looks slick. All of my other tanks work great, the issue is the coils for the mega, the wicking holes are tiny. Even using a 35/65 blend it's having a hell of a time keeping up and just produces weak vapour and flavour. I'm going to try and mod them tonight and I've go the clr heads on their way, hopefully one or the other fixes it otherwise this tank will be sitting in a drawer.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aq4sy,XTerribleX,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:07:13 2015 UTC,It was pretty reasonably priced at $120. I know they only had one orange left when I was there yesterday and a few whites.

We label our products as ""Shampoo"" in the declaration and sometimes it'll go through but other times they will just rip open the package. If they rip open the package, they will usually put ""Health Canada"" stickers and other warning stickers, and then they send it back to us.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aray3,DotModThrowaway,0,Mon Jun 22 22:14:58 2015 UTC,I don't see why people are having so many problems. As long as its packaged probably customs has no legal precedent to seize these items. The only time I ever had something stopped at customs I called and they released it.  I order my juices from ShopMVG and GalacticVapors and havent had a single problem and have ordered over 60+ bottles of juice.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aray3,SpaceKittyMan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:17:20 2015 UTC,I have no proof other than personal experience. The very first juice order i did was sent back by customs in early 2014. About 4 months ago I started ordering from the states again and from the same site and the orders made it through. A great deal of it could just be luck. But the exact same thing happened to a vape buddy of mine. He was really skeptical about placing another order from an American juice vendor but all orders so far have made it.

Canadian_ecigarette,3alen1,majorvapes,2,Sun Jun 21 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"Hey man no problem! Recognition where its due! I am indeed a father, to 3 amazing kids. Taking a break from building and tinkering today to just relax with the kids before another crazy week of work. Happy fathers day to you and to all!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3alen1,majorvapes,2,Sun Jun 21 13:32:24 2015 UTC,"Got to say, this right here is a pretty nice Father's day gift, feeling pretty good. Hope you have a wonderful day with those amazing kids. I've got two awesome little monkeys myself that keep me young! Thanks again man!!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3alen1,TSmashVapes,2,Sun Jun 21 14:02:03 2015 UTC,I fully agree! Tons of knowledgeable info and great straight up reviews. Thanks :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3alen1,Aepko,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:52:41 2015 UTC,I have vaped the entire 12 monkeys line (Minus primal pipe)  Have to go to spryfield to get it though :(  Best juice ever

Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,BassFeuille,2,Sun Jun 21 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"Well worth learning to rebuild but wouldn't recommend bulding that low unless you know what you're doing. Also not usually the greatest idea in an rta like that. Spend some time reading and learning and start with something like 26g if you want to build sub ohm in an rta. And aim for around .5 to .8 to start, it's a good comfortable vape in those rbas for the subtank."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,majorvapes,2,Sun Jun 21 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"For now, build 1+ohms coil until you get the hang of it. Watch build video on YouTube. Practice makes perfect here, there is no magic formula.  As for the wire you want to get some Kanthal A-1.  Welcome to the world of rebuilding :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,TheVaporist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:49:55 2015 UTC,The 0.5 OCC is great but I love the rebuildable base. That cotton is my favourite and can be bought from shoppers drug Mart $12ish for  a lifetime supply. 5  wraps of 26 gauge kanthol is my sweet spot on the subtank mini it's about 0.5 ohms.
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,The_Stiffness,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"Just tried to do it myself, rebuilding my Mini RBA Base, never, never, ever doing that myself again, worked for 5 seconds then saw some fire and istick stopped working, though it was over and I killed the istick, after 20 minutes my battery still wouldn't work then had the idea to plug it into the charge and it's been working again since then hahaha.. i'm just gonna wait for my friend to do it for me I guess"
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,CuBu,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"You had a short and it cut out, happens to me from time to time to be honest, More common then id care to admit. My bet is you didn't have the screws down far enough on the build.   Also I have a preference to not fire a crazy wattage when first heating my coils, even though I vape at 40 ish I first fire my dry coils at about 10."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,RobertDF902,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:33:38 2015 UTC,I keep this picture on hand for these types of posts. I personally don't care for the occ coils for the subtank. I find the vapor production to be lacking but the flavour to be pretty good. I always use the RBA base in mine and still have the original occ coils in the box. Get yourself some 26 gauge kanthal and try this build  Rebuilding is tough to master but once you get it right you'll never go back. Hang in there buddy it gets better.
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,Lampburglar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"You have to make sure none of the coil is touching the deck,it will cause a short . Use YouTube as a resource. I watched dozens of videos when learning how to build. I'd recommend getting an ohmmeter they're pretty cheap and can save you from frying your mod. There's really no reason to build down as low as you stated..unless you just really want to. A good start to building is 26g kanthal as it is nice to work with, you can pick up a lifetime supply of Sheseido cotton from Shoppers for 12 bucks. Practice is all I can say, I shorted my first coil...but that was the only time it ever happened. I just paid closer attention to what I was doing after."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,Famoosh,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"I also have the subtank plus, and it can be somewhat finnicky to build on just starting out. I really don't recommend building it at anything less than .5 ohms, especially with your iStick. I find that 50 watts isn't really a lot to work with when you're looking at .2 or less ohms.   On to actually rebuilding your tank. You're gonna need some kanthal and while the cotton they give you isn't terrible by any means, it really won't last long and you'll definitely need more, so might as well grab some organic cotton while you're at it. I'd say go with 26g kanthal to start off, should put you in the .7 - .8 range which is pretty prime for the subtank.   The biggest part about rebuilding the subtank isn't the coil, it's how you wick it. If you don't wick properly, you'll most likely end up with a lot of dry hits. I like to use the pancake method. Some people say to stuff the cotton through the juice holes on the bottom of the base, but I much prefer this way of doing it.  Biggest things, don't build low resistance until you've had some practice, always stay within a safe wattage and if you half-ass everything else, make sure you wick perfectly and it should turn out fine."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,danz_man,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:46:02 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the Subtank can't handle anything lower than 0.4Ω builds.  It just doesn't wick fast enough.
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,dr_sergen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:04:58 2015 UTC,i dont think the istick 50w will fire at that low resistance.
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,w00ten,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:44:04 2015 UTC,The Istick only goes down to 0.2 ohms... stick to around 0.4 @ 40w and you'll have clouds for days and the battery won't die within a couple hours. I find 0.3 to drain the battery too fast.
Canadian_ecigarette,3amkks,ProfHex,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:48:42 2015 UTC,"There needs to be more clarification. Lower resistance builds aren't always the way to go..many sub ohm builds are such because of the thick wire and massive surface area, i could throw a 2 wrap 24 gauge get something like .1 and have a terrible vape. It's about efficiently using surface area. I run 2.5 mm 7wrap 25 gauge in my zephyrs and it is a dense flavourful vape at .35 ohms."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,killerkittyn,3,Sun Jun 21 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe check out the evic vt. Charges via usb so no charger needed, goes up to 60w, has a 5000mah battery built in and has temp control in case you want to get in to that. Comes with a tank and replaceable coils so you can go the no hassle route too. I'm thinking if getting on myself."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,majorvapes,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:42:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion!  I'll see if any of the B&Ms that I can get to carry it (I don't really order anything online, long story)."

Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,Lampburglar,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"I'd personally let the eVic VT reviews flow in a bit more before jumping. I've seen a few posts..some pretty bad ones. Apparently they lied about the batteries..they're lipo and only 4500mah..dishonest. I still want one, I'm just going to sit back and wait first. Everyone got screwed on the ipv4's!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,TheVaporist,2,Sun Jun 21 20:22:22 2015 UTC,Honestly...just stay away from Eleaf and Joyetech...seriously! P4U is also not far from joining them.  Wait a bit for the new DNAs and Innokins.
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,majorvapes,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:14:02 2015 UTC,"I replied to your comment down below and thanks for the input (again)  :)  I'm okay waiting it out so I make sure to get something that's an upgrade and that I'll enjoy for awhile.  I mean, I'm excited to get a new mod and wish I had it right now but lack of funds/budgeting is stopping me from impulse buying at least.  It's kinda like getting a new cellphone; you want something shiney and new yet want to make sure it'll keep you amused for at least a year or 2."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,morbidangel27,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"Good point. I haven't really heard anything much about the evic vt just a whole bunch of gushing so far. But you're right, early adoption has it's risks."
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,morbidangel27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:10:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input!  I'm not planning on my next mod purchase for at least another 3 months.  I kind of want to see more reviews on the Subox kit and my next paycheque is going towards more juice.  I will definitely keep researching and checking out reviews.
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,TheVaporist,2,Mon Jun 22 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"Been having a blast with my m80 so far. It's a great device, has some weight to it. Seems to be solidly made. The only qualm i have with it is the charging port being on the bottom. I wants to get an evic vt and a subox as upgrades/need more mods. Lots of good devices out there."

Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,danz_man,2,Sun Jun 21 19:15:50 2015 UTC,the smok m80 could double as a bludgeoning weapon :D It's not a bad device for the money that's for sure!

Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,ChoofKoof,2,Sun Jun 21 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"Today: Subbox or DNA depending on your budget.. Sigelei if you want to buy a charger with it. Else Innokin is also good.  Next Month: New Innokin devices will be announced and more details on the DNA200. If Evolv plays their card right, the DNA200 will be the last device of it's generation until a new innovation comes along (in the same way as TC came along).  Ignore Smok/Eleaf/Joytech/P4U and all other unknown brands, it's all crap. Save a few bucks to get x watts more at the cost of lies and QC...not worth it!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3amjj1,bdbkush,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:22:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions!  I've been trying to find more reviews on the VaporShark DNA40 (Pocket Sized) and the Subox.  I feel like I might end up with a Sig (or similar, depends what is out by then) but not for maybe 6 months-1 year.  I basically want something that's a step up from my eGo but still fairly easy to use.  I'm willing to read up and learn though it's a bit overwhelming at this point.  I feel like I had to at least pick out what features that would be ideal for my needs and narrow it down from there until I get way more comfortable."

Canadian_ecigarette,3aksq4,tjc103,2,Sun Jun 21 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"Caught this on the news - a vape shop in Langley BC was targeted with a fellow placing a timed bomb (as per the video evidence) in front of the store. At first I thought ""insurance scam"" but it's the owner himself who released the video etc. Place is called All Day Vapes. The bomb was left right next to a gas main line, it's damned lucky the explosion wasn't bad enough to cause a bigger explosion. Watch the CTV report - there's footage of the saboteur / arsonist doing the deed.  pure speculation: disgruntled employee? pissed off competing shop? someone who really, really hates vaping?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aksq4,morbidangel27,2,Sun Jun 21 04:24:58 2015 UTC,"TBH. It could be targeted. But i don't think the shop was the target. The gas line itself could have been the target, if that thing had been blown up, that entire block could have went up in flames. Buddy didn't build a good enough bomb to do it though. Just a thought. Hope this little asshat gets caught."

Canadian_ecigarette,3aksq4,morbidangel27,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:25:29 2015 UTC,I'd assume a disgruntled ex-employee or someone who feels jaded by then (another store employee). Shit like that doesn't happen randomly (usually anyway)
Canadian_ecigarette,3aksq4,MellaCarabina,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"That's what we thought at first too, because we had robbery from an ex employee, but it wasn't the case. Somehow, the one camera facing the exterior of the store which is owned by the gas station in front was ""faulty"" and didn't record it all.   After months of looking into it, owners still claim it was another store on the block that wanted us gone."

Canadian_ecigarette,3ah97c,Brown_eyed_pea,5,Sat Jun 20 04:06:19 2015 UTC,fasttech. they're authentic. $10. add the $2.50 express packet shipping and you're golden.
Canadian_ecigarette,3ah97c,ijoijo,3,Sat Jun 20 10:36:53 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer. Also make sure you get the authentic ones 5 pack rather then the 10 pack of ""styled"" ones. They're the rip off version"

Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,OriginalWake,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"Cotton is finiky,   if you use not enough you wont get enough liquid and it will dry and burn almost instantly, if you get too much it chokes the wick and drys and burns,   if you get just a bit too much you wont burn but you will definitely taste cotton. (in this last case after a few hours it will go away)  that said try and try again. but DO NOT VAPE BURNT COTTON it can be dangerous."
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,antaios256,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:01:14 2015 UTC,what kinda of coil are you running? how many ohms? as far as when to change your cotton when it looks burnt and gunky you should dry burn your coil and put some fresh stuff in.
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,powerofsteel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:05:06 2015 UTC,5 wraps of 26g kanthal around 0.86 ohms
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,majorvapes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:07:01 2015 UTC,Another thing that causes a burnt taste can be hot legs or hot spots on your coils. Before wicking are you pulsing your coils to make sure they glow evenly?
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,powerofsteel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, was pulsing really evenly."
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,ZorroElite,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:11:58 2015 UTC,my best advice would be to just build something new and put it in. your gonna have to build a few different kinds of coil's till you find something that suits your taste.
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,tet5uo,2,Sat Jun 20 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"So far I like single coils, because you're not using a lot of juice, good vapor production and so far I've liked being in the 0.8-0.9 ohm area since it's a nice and cool vape. Do you know of any good single coil builds that fit my criteria?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,ConstantlyOnFire,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:33:35 2015 UTC,So... I'm going to suggest something that I almost never see anyone else suggest but it worked really well for me especially in some single coil tanks (like the subtank mini).  Build a standard coil.  (spaces between the wraps instead of squeezed together)
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,powerofsteel,2,Sat Jun 20 13:48:24 2015 UTC,Wrap around the threads of a machine-screw for a nice even spaced coil.
Canadian_ecigarette,3agwlp,danz_man,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:56:17 2015 UTC,Glad that worked for you. I'm just going to be getting into building with my new Subtank mini when it arrives this week and I was planning on following the Rip Trippers video. That's the build he uses.

Canadian_ecigarette,3agrnu,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:32:29 2015 UTC,It is very sexy. Guy in my town makes them and the new shop that opened up sells them. I love it. Downfall is it has the raptor chip in it and can't fire anything under 0.3 ohm.
Canadian_ecigarette,3agrnu,NOT_A_FIRETRUCK,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:21:19 2015 UTC,The centre tank is really growing on me. How are you liking the Atlantis? I just got mine yesterday and I don't know how to feel yet. I loved my Subtank but I was having leaking issues and I got too frustrated.
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,ijoijo,2,Fri Jun 19 20:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yep takes a week for me too, it's the best option."
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,CuBu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:36:48 2015 UTC,My last package got to me in 5 days from the day I ordered.
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:53:10 2015 UTC,I've ordered once. Late Thursday night. Within a few hours I got a ship notification and was delivered the next Thursday. I'm happy.
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,TSmashVapes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:58:46 2015 UTC,The $2.50 for me means the difference between it actually being delivered or me going to the post office to pick it up. Well worth it!
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,majorvapes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:53:04 2015 UTC,Being in Vancouver and ordering from Fasttech is the greatest. <3 Cheap RDAs
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,GoldenEarsVapours,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:57:16 2015 UTC,What's the typical wait time if you don't pay the extra charge? I've been curious to order from them. Just curious of the wait without the extra 2.50
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,Mighty84mike,2,Sat Jun 20 04:09:09 2015 UTC,Pay the $2.50 it can save you weeks of shipping time.. had things take 6 weeks regular shipping... around a week from ship date with the 2.50
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,CanVapes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"I had batteries in my last order, so couldn't use the epacket.  Ordered May 30 (saturday), shipped on June 2nd (tuesday), and arrived on the 17th in Ontario.  Was pleasantly surprised, though I'd still suggest the epacket if you can use it."
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,hrmdurr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:18:14 2015 UTC,Completely agreed. Surprised how well that epacket option works.
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,DotModThrowaway,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:53:35 2015 UTC,Fasttech & the $2.50 e-packet is amazing! I recently ordered with a different Chinese vendor & they charged me $6 for shipping & sent it fucking slowjo Singapore post.   For Canadians FT & e-packet is definitely the way to go.
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,buttfukitlists,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:07:39 2015 UTC,My current ft package (freemax coils & a rda) has been in the mail for almost 3 weeks with the epacket. However my previous order only took a week to ship. Still better then the 6 weeks regular shipping.
Canadian_ecigarette,3afubb,Chris1077,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"Ha. I ordered a nemesis mod, paid the extra $2.50. Things were great until it got into Canada. It ended up 'out for delivery' in Edmonton (I live in Ontario). Before that it was redirected to customers new address about 3 times.   Having said that, the past orders I've done with fasttech have arrived in a timely manner, so I won't let one hiccup sour me.   Edit: down votes? Really? For what!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aghgl,buttfukitlists,2,Fri Jun 19 23:23:11 2015 UTC,Had my mech mod held up at customs for 4 days. Nothing to worry about.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aghgl,JDOGG8,2,Sat Jun 20 04:18:16 2015 UTC,"I had my box mod get through customs in 40 minutes, it was the B.C customs facility.. Everytime my package goes through Mississauga it takes 1-4 days.. Don't worry it will make its way to you soon! Also to don't think they operate over weekends. Downside of being Canadian lol"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aghgl,JDOGG8,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:28:31 2015 UTC,Lol ya weekends off! (For checking tracking)  Very very accustomed to that...the more stuff I get shipped the less rage I have towards customs/CP...it's (unfortunately) just the way it is.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aghgl,yoonique_sound,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:47:46 2015 UTC,They've had some impressive ship times for me and others not so much.. For example keeping my package in the CP sorting for 5+ days in BC while only needing to transit to Alberta
Canadian_ecigarette,3aghgl,Lampburglar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:50:12 2015 UTC,"Ya like I said this is a first for me...usually pretty prompt, through customs same day/hour & in my mailbox in a few more days...although last few packages had some random fuckery...  One package arrived in Calgary & was due for delivery next day but for some reason was sent back to Richmond. CP said the sorting machine fucked up lol...I enjoyed that one - ""the machine fucked up.""  Meh...first world problems eh? Hahaha"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aghgl,antaios256,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:19:15 2015 UTC,I did recently order a much more expensive (unrelated to vaping) item & didn't fancy waiting 2 weeks for CP to deliver so instead went through UPS...I know I got dinged bad what with brokerage fees & other random made up charges but man was it fast! 48hrs from placing the order (from the US) item was at my door!

Canadian_ecigarette,3aghgl,obzilla,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:35:37 2015 UTC,Ya it's crazy! I've called customs (they were actually very nice lol) & they said to call back if there hadn't been any updates by the end of June!  In my dozen or so orders for vape shit this is the first time I've experienced the misery of a held package...

Canadian_ecigarette,3aesyx,Swelton,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:19:34 2015 UTC,"I've always been curious as to the legality of claiming copyright ownership over things like visa's or Canada Post's logo.   I find National Post's copyright tooltip on text highlights annoying as hell, but they did create or pay to create all of that text.    It may be prudent to use a module like Sears or Ali-Baba that just disables the right click when hovering on a picture.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aesyx,_Nymphae,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:58:23 2015 UTC,Thanks i wanted a freemax and box of coils but even with your discount your still more expensive than canvape :(
Canadian_ecigarette,3aesyx,BluShirtGuy,2,Fri Jun 19 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"I order from canvape regularly, but I recently ordered from jgvapes and the customer service was top notch. No freaking way you will get the level of service from canvape that Jason provides. I would way rather support a smaller company for a few bucks extra than some dickheads that don't care about your experience one bit."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,mightyprometheus,3,Fri Jun 19 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"If you like fruits, you should definitely try our sampler pack. I'm sure you'll find more than 1 juice to your liking :)  As for RDAs, are you looking for flavor or vapor? The mutation v4 is a nice contender since it can have airflow beneath or on the sides."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,TheVaporist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"I should have mentioned, I'm more of a flavor guy. :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,TheVaporist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"Then I'd go with the Veritas (greatest RDA ever!), Freakshow (full size) or N22 by Ivogo. We only carry the authentic Freakshow.  Sadly FT stopped selling the good clone of the Veritas :("
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,anxdiety,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:13:09 2015 UTC,Could always go with the Marquis instead of the Veritas. Extremely similar and comes with posts to make building much much easier.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,TheVaporist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:26:29 2015 UTC,Marquis is for dual coils if I recall. Single coil on the veritas directly aligned with the airhole :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,anxdiety,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:34:13 2015 UTC,"You can use the Marquis with single coils as well. Using a single coil you can use the middle hole on the top cap for single air, or direct air from the single hole and at the side of the coil from the two outer air holes.   Build is easy for either vertical or horizontal coils as the rods included fit and lock in to either the deck or the air channels.   The trickiest part for the Marquis is wicking. But once you figure out how much cotton to fold over it's really easy.   I got mine from Focal Ecig and haven't put it down since."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,TheVaporist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"True, but your coil will not be in the center. There is nothing wrong with that, but with the veritas, you can simply tilt the atty  in the opposite direction to resaturate  your coil in between hits."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,karmapopsicle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:13:14 2015 UTC,KickAsh has the authentic Veritas on sale right now. Worth picking up given how good it is.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,TheVaporist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:14:23 2015 UTC,At 100$ I still find it expensive. 50$ I would jump on it.   My 5 clones from FT do the job. Had to drill a hole on one of the negative sides so that I could easily setup a clapton coil in it. I would feel like shit doing this and messing up on an authentic ;)
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:28:15 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely it isn't a cheap atty, but I think if you like the design enough to own 5 clones it's reasonable to purchase one of the authentic ones to support the original designer :)  At this point in the game though there's so many great affordable authentics coming on to the market it's getting more and more difficult to justify buying clones. I used to be a die-hard clone buyer, but I recently switched over to using all authentic gear."

Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,obzilla,3,Fri Jun 19 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"Another plug to Evaperated! If you like fruits, try Alpha Blood. Sweet pear, some caramel. They have another one that is the same sweet pear with a touch of citrus if caramel is too desert like for you."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,spacepilotblastoff,0,Fri Jun 19 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"I keep checking them out, but their prices are wayyy too steep. It's at like 80 cents a mL."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,pancakemixes,2,Fri Jun 19 16:43:16 2015 UTC,You gotta buy in bulk ;)  Try out a sample pack then snag some 140mls. 3x140mls is like $150 and she always tosses a couple bonus bottles in.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,evaperated,2,Fri Jun 19 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"It would take me years to kill 3x140 mls, and I'd probably get tired of the flavors.  If they upped their size to 15 ml and kept their $8 price I'd be all over it. Maybe one day I'll give them a shot. Hopefully they're at vapeCAN."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,pancakemixes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:32:45 2015 UTC,Not always! I have yet to get a bonus. Don't set the expectation people will always get free juice because it's disappointiiiing.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,evaperated,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:54:28 2015 UTC,We always send a free 10ml.  For orders over $30 you get a free 30ml on top of that as long as you comment with the flavor you want.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,pancakemixes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"I think what he meant was ""extra surprise bottles."" I've seen lots of people post on here with the surprise extras they've gotten from lots of vendors."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,evaperated,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:01:34 2015 UTC,A lot of vendors have premade juice which is super easy to just grab and throw in.  We hand make every order fresh to order so we do our best to send freebies.  Sometimes upgrades to 140ml sizes as well.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,obzilla,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"And that's great! The point I am trying to make is that vendors ""sometimes"" do this, as you said. Not always!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,Lampburglar,2,Sat Jun 20 21:29:50 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, I was just trying to clarify since they said they never got anything free from us and we always send at least a 10ml :P  ONE DAY maybe I'll have premade joose!!  Though I have a lot of customers that love the fresh made orders.  Thoughts to ponder rubs chin"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,danz_man,2,Sun Jun 21 03:48:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you buy. A 30ml sampler (3x30ml) is $45, plus they give you a free 30ml on orders over $30. So 4x30ml = 120ml/$45 = $0.375 per ml.  If you buy the 140ml bottles it gets really cheap. Friday nights the do freebees as well. Check their facebook.  For a single 10ml bottle, MOST juices are very expensive per ml."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,eastcoastfog,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:27:49 2015 UTC,Phil at /u/thevaporist also has free shipping on his multi pack juices. Toss an RDA on there and use his coupon FREESHIP(I think) and its all free shipping! Amazing deal!
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,karmapopsicle,2,Fri Jun 19 17:24:50 2015 UTC,"Marquis is definitely a great RDA for flavor.  You could also look into the CLT v3 or Lancia if you like a more wide open airflow.    For fruit flavours, you can give Mother Earth Organics a shot.  I've got Strawberry Lemonade right now, and it's amazing.    Or you could just quit vaping altogether.  As long as you don't go (back) to smoking.  For me, the whole point of vaping was to change my lifestyle of smoking by replacing cigarettes.  So if your first instinct in the future is to go for a puff off a vape rather than buy a new pack of smokes when you get a nicotine craving, it's done it's part in changing your lifestyle."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,eastcoastfog,2,Fri Jun 19 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"I never really smoked before. I tried it a few times and it wasn't for me. Here and there I'll have a bit of a cigar if I'm having drinks with friends, but that's like a once a year thing. I used to love shisha though, and that's originally why I got it.  Perhaps I need a new RDA. I loved my magma, and the change to the tank was nice. The lemo is really amazing, but I just don't get the same feel / fun I used to have with my magma.  I have a mother earth organics sweet unicorn farts, and I agree, it's really good."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,karmapopsicle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:26:35 2015 UTC,The mutation v3 is probably the rda your looking for as far as juice goes evaporated has great juice and good prices
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,eastcoastfog,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:41:41 2015 UTC,The Mutation X V3 is pretty much exactly the opposite of what he wants.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:13:19 2015 UTC,How is that?
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,eastcoastfog,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"Mutation is a fog machine, but severely lacking in flavour."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:56:20 2015 UTC,That is not true it's a versatile rda it can give you both.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,eastcoastfog,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"Flavour in the Mutation is abysmal compared to basically any true flavour atty.  It's a stellar cloud blowing atty, don't get me wrong, but flavour is severely lacking."

Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,x-manowar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:00:15 2015 UTC,What's your idea of a flavour build?
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,joekerr37,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:07:15 2015 UTC,I generally use twisted coils but it's more about wicking and airflow
Canadian_ecigarette,3aev2d,obzilla,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:41:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of flavour is based on airflow, chamber size, surface area, etc. Chamber size and directed airflow are two of the jogged reasons the Mutation just doesn't compete very well."

Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,CuBu,2,Fri Jun 19 12:25:00 2015 UTC,"Okay... We'll I don't have time for a long drawn out review, but here is what I can contribute.  I bought the SX mini m class a couple of months ago and at this point I'm rarely using anything else.    I mostly use tanks (multiple so I can change flavours easily while driving etc.  Initially I kept kanthal in a couple tanks and put nickel in a couple of others.  Was running a sigelei 100+ for the kanthal.  I found that I was getting significantly better flavour from the nickel... Primarily because I can crank it up without worrying about dry hits or burning.  For tanks, I'm using the Delta 2, subtank mini, and now a Lemo 2.  I find that single coil tanks are perfect for nickel.  Of those 3, I get the best results fr the Delta 2, followed by the lemo, with the subtank in last place.  However, the subtank is the easiest to use and super convenient, especially with OCC stock coils.    Nickel is a bit harder to build with than kanthal, but you go much longer before you have to recoil since the cotton is staying intact much longer."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,ZorroElite,2,Fri Jun 19 13:27:02 2015 UTC,"Does it really not give dry hits? What happens if you fire on a fresh unjuiced coil? Coils glow but no burning or anything?  I have an eVic VT en route. I got it to use as a regular device since it looks snazzy and big internal battery. It was a steal at $60. I'm going to try TC to see how it is, but I don't have high hopes."

The coils will not have the opportunity to glow.  You can see this here with the SX Mini. PBusrdo (in this vid) displays Smok's pathetic attempt at temp control."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:27:09 2015 UTC,I actually am able to vape a tank dry... The device will actually cut power if it sense the coil is too dry.  The only dry hit I've had was when changed tanks and forgot to reset the base ohm reading.
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,ZorroElite,2,Fri Jun 19 23:53:57 2015 UTC,"I have 2 rDNA40s. I've used the temp function a max of 3 times.  I find nickel affects the taste of the flavor and I dislike it.  I never get dry hits with kanthal because of lack of juice. Unless you take 15 second puffs, you can taste when the wick is starting to dry out and act accordingly :P  The only time I get dry hits is usually with my Kayfun 4 when the POS DNA40 bugs out and thinks my kanthal coil is a nickel coil and fires at 40W (even when configured for 20W! stupid spring!). I hope they fix this with the 200. Both DNA40s I have do this. If I disable TC on it, it bugs out instead of firing and says ""temperature protected"" until I reseat the atty.  I think if done right, TC is not needed. I also agree no one should ever EVER have to taste a dry hit, so TC is justified :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,TheVaporist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"I've got a Sigelei 150, had a Vaporshark DNA40, and a Zero clone (CNA60 chip).  What I've noticed:  RTA's really shine with nickel builds, since you're limited by airflow and juice flow.  With all this limiting, it just makes sense to limit temperature as well.  That way, the vapor coming out of the RTA is consistent.  I'm loving my Lemo2 with a claptoned nickel coil.    RDA's.... not interested.  I haven't managed to find a nickel coil I want to use in an RDA.  Probably because I like a warmer vape.    Get tempered nickel.  Annealed nickel is a bitch to work with.  Almost as easy to work with as Kanthal.    Titanium wire is... interesting.  Ramp up time is nearly instant.  Hard to manipulate.  Haven't played with it enough to get a good feel of it yet.    DNA40 is much more refined than the CNA60 chip.  When the DNA reaches temp limit, it's much more gradual in letting off the power.  The CNA is like a bad driver - hard on the gas, hard on the brake.  Still gets the job done, but sometimes, you can really feel it pulse.    I can't speak for the Yihi SX350 chip though."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,danz_man,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"TC is basically ABS braking for the vaping world.  It's nice once in a while, but if you have any ounce of experience building and know your setups then you won't need it."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,greekdude1821,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:54:30 2015 UTC,No. More. Dry. Hits.  I picked up an rDNA 40 about a month ago and I've had one dry hit because my dumb ass didn't screw down the post screw.  You can hit and hit and hit until you're blue in the face and the only thing that will happen is less vapor.
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,elitexero,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:47:32 2015 UTC,"I've have both the yihi chip and the Dna40 , I even have the clone dna40 , they all have there quirks . I've had more dry hits from user error screwing around with temp control than I've ever had with kanthal . When it's used properly it can be great but there is a learning curve and if you rush into it your gonna get some dirty hits. Yihi seems to have made the better chip in my mind but once you learn the correct usage of the dna40 it functions nicely . Someone already mentioned using tempered nickel and that's true as its stiffer and easier to use.  I honestly don't find the nickel enhances flavorfor me , it may be because I'm used to great kanthal builds like claptons that pump out flave. Even though it's been out for quite a while I think temp control is still not perfected ."
Canadian_ecigarette,3ae9mq,ry4life,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:24:55 2015 UTC,"Pros; no dry hits. better battery life, more economical with juice, you can choose a temperature and hits should be consistent throughout the day.  Cons; nickel wire is a pain to wrap (soft). you need a temp control device. You can't really ever put it on 'blast'. One more wire or coil type to keep around.  Worth it? For you to decide, kind sir. I'm glad I have temp control devices, and I use them on the regular for tanks. But for me nothing beats a good, high wattage kanthal build at home. Nickel has been more practical for work and on the go. YMMV."

Canadian_ecigarette,3acuje,A_st_J,2,Fri Jun 19 01:58:29 2015 UTC,"I had the same problems when I used my EVOD 2's, I found it helps if you just hold the button down for a few seconds without taking a puff.   It could be how hard you're pulling on it too. Seeing as there's very little airflow, if you pull too hard when you take a puff, more juice will get pulled into the coil head. This is happens more often with PG based ejuices. I would recommend a 50/50 PG/VG blend ejuice if you have access to it"
Canadian_ecigarette,3acuje,Awesummzzz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, glad to hear it's not an isolated issue.

Canadian_ecigarette,3acuje,majorvapes,2,Fri Jun 19 03:13:44 2015 UTC,"Wife had those. For a quick fix cover the mouth piece with a piece of tissue and swing the thing down towards the ground mouth piece end down a few times to shake the juice out. The tissue is there to catch the excess juice. You'll want to do it with some force. Like when you're trying to get an old pen working. Pulling too hard can cause some juice to build up in the atomizer head, that and condensation build up."

Canadian_ecigarette,3acuje,morbidangel27,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"Don't suck too hard, the unit isn't build for long hauls.

Maybe widen the air holes in the base of the tank for more airflow. Or pick yourself up an adjustable airflow tank if your into taking larger hauls."

I freaking hate watermelon flavoring since I was a kid. I would have to tell people to get away from me or move if someone was chewing like watermelon bubble gum it would make me want to puke.   They are all almost fruity except for the grandma's (cookies) and date night(ice cream sundae I think) feck off (mocha coffee?) They have good consistancy in flavors as far as the juice they seem to have the same VG concentration.
Canadian_ecigarette,3ab3fc,DotModThrowaway,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:03:47 2015 UTC,I think flavour crafters new line was alright . Instead of pumping out a pile of new flaves they should have focused on making a handful of vapes perfect . We want custards and cereals and creams ..yes they have supposedly bad Chemicals in them but it's our decision ! The most delicious vapes I've tried have probably been loaded with diacetyl and acetoin but we all used to inhale thousands of bad chemicals so can it be much worse? Just my opinion

Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,leehoezitto,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:32:06 2015 UTC,Is that the 150w? I didn't realize it was so small. I have to save up for this now.

Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,SpyderVapes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:50:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I googled it after and was disappointed to find out that it's not as small as it looks in this pic. I'm considering going with the Sigelei mini instead since it looks smaller and is significantly cheaper.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,dienah13,2,Fri Jun 19 03:02:10 2015 UTC,Go with the sigelei you won't regret it
Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,MacHater420,2,Thu Jun 18 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"Sigelei definitely worth it, especially if temp control isn't your thing. Are you planning on building coils?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,Gathax,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:27:06 2015 UTC,Yes. I build now on my dark horse. Sig it is then! Thanks everyone.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,jungleismassiv3,2,Thu Jun 18 17:18:51 2015 UTC,I say Sigelei as well!  Still haven't regret getting it.
Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,dotvapes,2,Thu Jun 18 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"If you want a regulated device, go with the Sigelei. You could also get a nice custom box mod for that price."
Canadian_ecigarette,3aaqou,RangerRick61,2,Thu Jun 18 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"I've had the Sig 150 for 4 months now. It has never had any problems whatsoever. A solid device. If you're not looking for temp control, go with this and a pair of Samsung 25Rs."

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,Vendeta44,4,Thu Jun 18 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"Unless something has been changed I don't know about, which I don't think it has, Bill 45 will impact B&M's significantly. As far as I'm aware online sales will be unaffected but that may change as the bill is flexible either way.  The TLDR of it all is that e-cigarette's are being treated like tobacco products. Which means that it is illegal to display them or promote them in any way. B&M's won't be able to have any products for viewing, handling, or discussion. You will need to know what you're looking for as if you walked into a gas station and asked for a pack of Players. Vape shops won't be allowed to recommend brands or set ups. Vaping indoors is also banned so sampling flavours is gone.  The very very TLDR of it is B&M's are being crippled, online sales currently seem unaffected."
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,VaporNorth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:42:38 2015 UTC,You sure? I thought one of the conditions of the regulations were no online sales.
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,setzRFD,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:05:01 2015 UTC,There are no regulations for online sales in the bill no. They focus entirely on B&M.
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,VaporNorth,2,Thu Jun 18 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"Bill 45, Schedule 3 basically allows the sale of vaping devices at specific vendors that have to follow display regulations in order to sell, but it limits them to not being able to allow customers to sample flavours indoors on commercial property. It will make it so that gas stations and convenience stores can no longer display that they carry any vaping stuff (which are usually of poor quality, IMHO) and actual B&Ms will have to follow strict regulations of signage and how they advertise what they sell. Other than that, basically as long as the juices aren't seen as marketing to minors, nothing juice-related will change for now."
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,Naiser_,3,Thu Jun 18 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"The loss of sampling is a huge blow. Most smokers are skeptical (I was), walking into Dash when I lived in T.O. and trying out stuff let me see that I was going to be OK. It's a horrible inclusion to the bill."
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,obzilla,2,Thu Jun 18 13:43:56 2015 UTC,buying juice without sampling it is very risky.
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,dr_sergen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"I remember when i first walked into a vaping store to try out the different liquids, i went through around 20 flavors before i found one i actually liked/loved.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,dr_sergen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:44:10 2015 UTC,atleast maybe we will still be able to smell the liquids.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,tet5uo,2,Thu Jun 18 15:20:10 2015 UTC,They don't want people trying it and liking it.   Too many people quit and there go the billions in tobacco tax revenue.   Better make it a higher barrier to entry so they can slow down how many people are quitting before they get all their propaganda in place to start the sin-taxes.   It's fucking obvious what it's about.
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8yq1,obzilla,2,Thu Jun 18 13:56:02 2015 UTC,I'm not confused about that. Just disappointed.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8gqm,tarbonics,2,Thu Jun 18 01:34:59 2015 UTC,Th rules are against nicotine. There shouldn't be any issues with importing 0 nic.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8gqm,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"Even if they did inspect your package at customs, The should have no reason to take the juice. Regarding flagging a package... I really doubt they have time for it. They may take a second look at depending if there is any evidence on the outside of the package that there may be nicotine in the package. (ie: From: Vaporshark)."

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8gqm,demential,2,Thu Jun 18 10:31:01 2015 UTC,"How long? The customs backlog is pretty shitty.  My experience is 6-8 business days before it gets on its way, nicotine or not.  If they sent you a letter saying they jacked your shit... then I'm sorry that you are the unluckiest person on earth, and its probably not worth your time to fight with them, because bureaucracy."

It gets breezy as hell up there with the wind off of lake Huron.  Driving south home I hit 3 of the things within a week because they would always try to fly towards the lake directly into the wind, getting nowhere.  So i guess the moral of the story is that I can't shit on a gull, but I'm not dumb enough to get hit by a truck."

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8gqm,konkatenate,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:49:33 2015 UTC,I had a 0mg nic juice held at customs for over a week. They probably wanted to test it to make sure it was actually 0mg.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a85g5,demential,3,Thu Jun 18 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion, which does not reflect that of our company; is that people screaming at the top of their lungs are on the receiving end of a poor test.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a85g5,kkeeiiggaann,4,Thu Jun 18 01:23:46 2015 UTC,I would love to see Vendors releasing test results in Canada.
Canadian_ecigarette,3a85g5,Lampburglar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:52:33 2015 UTC,"Samesies. I often wonder, but I don't go so far as to worry due to the fact that I am able to get by without tobacco now. Would I switch flavours if I were to discover one/some of my regulars weren't particularly good for me? Sure. Would I give up vaping immediately if they were all bad for me? Nah.  Still, it would be nice to see results."
Canadian_ecigarette,3a85g5,kkeeiiggaann,3,Thu Jun 18 02:52:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean either way it's still better for you than formaldehyde. Or any of the carcinogens that are in smokes.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a8rjf,Peterkizz,3,Thu Jun 18 03:09:24 2015 UTC,MVP imo. The ipv 2 suffers from some quirky wattage and the paint wont last 3 months unless you keep it wrapped in cello and only set it down on bubble wrapped surfaces.  EDIT: I assumed you were speaking of the ipv mini 2. But if your speaking of the ipv2 i don't know if anything majorly wrong with it
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8rjf,Vendeta44,2,Thu Jun 18 03:56:00 2015 UTC,"First off, I have no experience with either mod, basing my opinion solely on what I've seen and read.  It seems like everyone that has an MVP 3/Pro loves it. Classic Innokin reliability.   As for the iPV (Mini?) 2, Pioneer4You seems like they put out good mods with a few cut corners. A lot of people swear by them, but I can't give any personal insight"
Canadian_ecigarette,3a8rjf,Awesummzzz,2,Thu Jun 18 05:38:00 2015 UTC,I have a ipv mini v2 and absolutely love it.  But given the choice I would go with the mvp.  The ipv does not step down voltage.

I went into the closest store looking for my current favourite (Captain Olivers Gibbons Grog), and they were sold out, again. However they just got some ""Fucking Awesome"" ejuice in. One smell of Isabella and I had to have it. It has a familiar custard smell with just bit of lemon. It took me a day of vaping to figure out the flavor. The taste reminds me of a timmies lemon poppy seed muffin. I wish it had more vg though, the liquid seems to be not as thick as my regular ejuices. However the taste makes up for this. I would recommend it if you are looking for something a little different. I looked into the company a little bit, and it they are Canadian. Other then that I don't see much about them. Their website isn't finished yet.  8/10 would vape again"

We worked our asses off to have it all shipped by about 2 weeks of launching for preorders, but by the looks of it now it will be closer to 4 weeks. Everything is set-up and almost ready to go, except we encountered somewhat serious issues with one of our suppliers. We have tried pretty much everything to get it moving but our hands are kind of tied at this moment. We've been waiting for them for about a week now and will wait a bit more, but we're also making alternate arrangements just in case.   If we do see that the ship date might be pushed past 4 weeks, we will be emailing all customers as soon as we find out. We would hate for this to happen and we're trying everything to prevent it, but it's important to prepare for the worst and be open with our customers about it.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a4n5t,MacHater420,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:54:39 2015 UTC,"Just curious , how much does it cost to DIY a mod?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3a4n5t,demon1102,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:24:28 2015 UTC,"Depends what you are looking for. For unregulated dual 18650 mods (like the 3 in the middle) you can buy kits for around 60-100. Regulated ones are more expensive because you have to also by the regulating chip.  You can also buy all the parts individually from sites like Digikey and Mouser, but shipping in Canada tends to be pretty expensive unless you buy lots.   Me and my friend do build mods and sell them for around $100-120 if you don't want to build it yourself."
Canadian_ecigarette,3a4n5t,karmapopsicle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:37:08 2015 UTC,Digikey shipping in Canada is $8 flat rate for FedEx overnight. That's cheaper than most vape shops for CP regular.

Canadian_ecigarette,3a7jqs,CraveeJuice,2,Wed Jun 17 21:07:45 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone,  So we can understand how most people perceive the term ""Organic"" to be a sales pitch to charge more money, or to persuade people into buying it as opposed to regular products.  Our view of Organic is different. We are looking at the taste perspective of it. Our eJuice allows people to experience the true taste of the flavor. A good example would be peach. As opposed to having our ejuice taste artificially sweetened or like candy from when they were growing up... we want people to experience ejuice that allows them to experience taste like a FRESH peach that was just picked. True taste instead of artificial taste.   To reiterate, we focus on the Organic giving people true taste as opposed to artificially made taste. Not just using the word to try and pick off those that are organic-minded.  Have a good week :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3a7jqs,TheVaporist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:37:09 2015 UTC,"It's BS marketing. I can give you 100% organic poison extracted from a venomous spider! Organic is not always synonym for good.  Worst part is they don't even state if their VG is USP Pharmaceutical grade. Seeing how they also produce liquids to add to your coffee, with no USP information, it is probably food grade VG, which is not suitable for vaping.  There were discussions on ECF or ECR about the purest VG available being 100% synthetic."

Good thing about this is that you will lower your nic.   The best RTA IMO remains the Kayfun 3 or 4. For drippers, I'd suggest a Magma or Freakshow (be carefull though, it leaks very easily). Keep in mind this is coming from someone who likes flavor a lot more than clouds.  I honestly would have recommended the nautilus for an easy to use tank but you dislike it. As others have suggested, you could look at the other offerings from Kanger prior to the Subtank. If you were to grab a battery, I'd recommend the MVP20W over the istick30. It's a little biger, but sturdier.  Or you could just say F it all and grab a subox with a battery. It's a great all in one kit, but you won't have the best flavor and 12mg could be harsh on it."
Canadian_ecigarette,39zh6v,TheVaporist,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:12:03 2015 UTC,"Good suggestion.   Just have to say though.  I started with my nautilus then got my subtank mini and fell in love.  Since then I have tried a atlantis v2, a delta 2, and a smok vct.  Non of them compares to my subtank mini for flavour.  Every vaper is different."
Canadian_ecigarette,39zh6v,littleb2017,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:30:14 2015 UTC,If you're ready to drop your nic and move to full lung hits on sub ohm then a subtank is good. I went from 12-6 and didn't skip a beat when I got my subtank but if you still want the same experience then there's probably a better tank than sub ohm stuff.
Canadian_ecigarette,39zh6v,jungleismassiv3,2,Tue Jun 16 13:39:42 2015 UTC,I do agree with you.  I was just stating every vaper will have their own preference in tanks.  The original subtank mini mouth to lunged very well for me while I made the transition to straight to lung hits.
Canadian_ecigarette,39zh6v,littleb2017,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"of course...different strokes for different folks :)  The subtank is the general recommendation since it can fit most needs. I just think it performs poorly for MTL, so if that is what the person is aiming for, I wouldn't personally recommend it."
Canadian_ecigarette,39zh6v,TheVaporist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Had the same set up as u before I started to sub ohm  I'd go with the istick 30w (50$) and a ""Gemini"" tank (25$), Not sure on the spelling but it's made by kangertech.  Great tank and battery.  Way better than the Nautilis and cheaper coils.    But if u want great battery life get the Istick 50w.  It's got 4400 mah and a friend of mine got one to use with the Gemini tank.   He's had it for a month using 12mg all day.  And he has charged it 3 times!"

Canadian_ecigarette,39zh6v,Robbie-R,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:27:33 2015 UTC,I use a 30 watt Istick with a Kanger Subtank Mini. Its the only device I own so I use it all day every day & its been very reliable for the 3 months I have owned it.  I vape 12mg Juice with the 1.2ohm coil and I love the vape I get from this combo. The 30 watt Istick battery lasts me 2 solid days and The Subtank Mini tank is large enough to get me through the day without having to refill it.  A new OCC coil lasts me 7-10 days and you also have the option of using the RBA that is included. Some people just re-wick the OCC coils with fresh cotton and say they are like new coils after re-wicking but I have not tried it yet.

I don't think a 3mm would fit at all, just based on looking. Maybe that RIP Trippers guy will tackle interesting builds in the CLR heads... ;)  I've never built a vertical build in anything yet; I don't think it would work well in this as again, very tight space, and you'd have to make sure the wicking worked (ie liquid travels well to the coil)."
Canadian_ecigarette,39zz2z,reoshinjuki,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"I think the trickiest part of a vertical on this thing would be the legs, but I suppose that's true of any vertical. The CL heads, as I'm sure you noticed, use vertical builds, so I was thinking if he were to fashion one in the CLR it might improve airflow a bit (as I've noticed has been the case with my RTAs). However, this is his first device and first build, and I'm not there to give it a go myself, so we'll start with the standard build and he can go from there as he pleases.   Thanks for the info!"

Canadian_ecigarette,39yunu,ronndilla,2,Mon Jun 15 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"The goblin is a pretty straight forward rta without too many pieces that could mess up. If you can't fill it, it's possible there is some machining debris in the fill hole. Try running a piece of kanthal through it. Also make sure your orings are seated in the right spots and the lower one isn't out of the ring blocking anything. Other than that there isn't much it could be. Ask your friend to take a look at what you're doing maybe he can give you some tips."

And if so, was there a way to fix the issue without having to go through an exchanging process with the store."

Half way down the threads stop... I'm guessing that shouldn't be like that haha.  Hopefully tomorrow the shop I go to is good about exchanging it, they do say they have a 1 month in store warranty."

Canadian_ecigarette,39yunu,kkeeiiggaann,0,Tue Jun 16 03:17:14 2015 UTC,"This tank has a trick to it. You need to leave adequate space between the glass and the chimney at the side where the fill hole is located. When assembling, make sure the glass is shifted to towards the fill hole side a little, so that there's a bigger gap on that side in the chamber than the other. You still need it to form an adequate seal on the o-rings, of course, but you want it tilted/shifted slightly so that the gap is greater on the fill hole side.  Thicker juice is going to give you trouble if you don't do that, as it seems to collect at the lip where the chimney attaches to the build deck chamber piece. When you don't give it time to run down into the tank, you'll notice it collects at the top around the build deck chamber. Forcing it in then pushes it into the juice flow holes, into the build deck/chamber, and it runs out the chimney. Turning it right-side up when you've flooded it will cause it to exit the airflow holes.   The fill hole is just a hole through one component. A lip hangs over about half that hole. Disassemble, look through the hole...if you can see through it, it isn't defective...it's just a little tricky to use."

Not a fan of:   The big massive images for each juice.  It's awesome the photos are somewhat descriptive, but IMO they don't need to be this huge.  ... The size of the images on the sample pack page would be what I would have preferred. The fact that you need to scroll left/right to see all the juices.  I just always hate these because my computer(s) either scroll too slow or too fast and there's no control over it.  I like the more simple (but probably somewhat more boring) grid with an up/down scroll that I can use my scroll wheel on my mouse for.  ... Basically your sample pack page is how I would have wanted the entire juice page to look.  3 or 4 columns then scroll down as you add more juice options. That if I click on a juice, I'm at a dead end.  I have to click back (or home), then scroll left (without it running away and scrolling right to the end by mistake) then click the next juice to see what it is.  It just feels like too much work in order to spend money.... The pricing being in USD but not indicating that on each price on the website.  I think it would make sense to see ""$5.00 USD"" or ""$25.00 USD"" on each product instead of having the fact that you charge in USD buried in the ""Payments"" section of the website."
Canadian_ecigarette,39wkhj,demon1102,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"All I can say is 'WOW'! Thank you for taking the time to offer us such detailed feedback, we really appreciate it! I'll try to cover your points in the order you listed:   We really wanted to juices to pop out at you, but several people have mentioned that they're too big so we'll consider reducing them. I think horizontal scrolling is a neat and manageable feature while our juice line is still small, but once we start adding more juices it'll most likely have to go. This is a unique point that no one has ever brought up. I'll take a note of it, thanks! We have the prices in USD listed in 3 different places: FAQ, Payment Policy, Checkout. But I see your point about adding it to each product. I'll talk to my tech guru about it.   Good luck with the giveaway!"
Canadian_ecigarette,39wkhj,Lampburglar,3,Mon Jun 15 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your website launch. I like the logo, the colours, and the menus. I think you could open with the sample pack page layout grid... we really don't get more or better or more enticing responses from the increased scale. Horizontal scrolling has never really been an intuitive interface, people balk at it for that reason. Really, you want your customers to be as comfortable as possible when they are about to spend money online... interface confusion can trigger a tiny mistrust. As you know, e-juice is a very competitive market.  I am finding clicking deep for descriptions kind of aggravating...  I can see the effort that has gone into making the images reflect the flavours -- which is a fast and effective method to communicate... but it can also make your liquids look like they might be single flavour mixes... but tbh, I don't find the image of tobacco appetizing, [it makes me wonder about a round section of dry tobacco leaf and the watermelon bits are hard to distinguish with the grapefruit-- not sure I would have recognized them without the text. The little bits of pith on the cut grapefruit aren't particularly delicious -- it makes me wonder about shooting a cross section of a grapefruit, with a triangle of watermelon placed with its point on center and its base at the edge... or a completely pithless section of grapefruit laid on a cut of watermelon [then cropped to a circle] -- all that aside, the visual arrangement is harmonious, because you are putting slightly disparate images into circles, the visual layout works really well. Sounds like nice flavours, I hope to try them soon!!"
Canadian_ecigarette,39wkhj,Lampburglar,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thank you for a very detailed response, we appreciate every bit of insight that we get! I don't have really strong objections to anything that you said, I more-or-less agree with everything and have noted it for a more thorough review later on. You're the first person to criticize the pictures of some of our products, and I think you hit the nail on the head because the points you mentioned were the points that I was concerned about when designing the product pics. I'm afraid we're going to have to keep the photos as is for the first month or so, after that we'll definitely get better ones!"

I assume you'll have more flavours available eventually? And as for the last part, do we need to provide our email in these comments?

I like the simplicity of the site, but as there are only 6 juices, on a 1200x1920 screen, just give me all the options instead of having to scroll left and right once juice at a time."

Does that mean that a second order would need to be placed to use that coupon or can it be used on the initial order?  I'll echo what others have said, those pictures are too large.   Description under the flavours would help rather than having to click into all of them.   The overall look of the site is nice though!"
Canadian_ecigarette,39wkhj,MIKKEEYC,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"Great question! You can't use 2 coupons per order, so right now we're offering a 10% discount coupon but once we launch we will email all the customers that pre-ordered a coupon for a free bottle that they can use on their next order.

I don't mind having to click on the pictures to find flavour profiles as there are only 6 juices to go through, also the pictures give you a pretty good idea what the juice is like.  Will be ordering a sampler pack for sure, but I'll have to wait a bit as I'm moving to another province and the last thing I want is to have my juice lost somewhere in transit!  Ha!"

""The Lion is our best selling juice"".."

A 30mL bottle is half the price of shipping which is unheard of from the majority of Canadian Vendors.  Somethings I would change though * The images are huge, try to show around 4-6 products per page * Not really a big fan of the orange or yellow and your logo blends in with the background P.S. I'm colourblind * You implement a feature where you hover over a juice to see the description"

I don't not like the yellow, its a nice color but could use some sort of bordering to take a bit of attention away from it.  Your logo could use a bit of work. More or less the lines on it need a bit of darkening.  Another visual issue may be the size of the juice pictures. They are a bit overwhelming.  Functionally it hits all of my markers and seems nice and smooth!  Good luck with your business!"

I would stay away from the clone...I have seen it and the post holes are not 2.8mm like the authentic...much much smaller...the whole idea behind the Atty was to have lots of build space and massive post holes to fit any conceivable wire.

Canadian_ecigarette,39xox4,VlRU5,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:27:50 2015 UTC,"Isn't it though?? Omg. Best juice in a while!  Hmmm, flavour profile was fruits, desserts, Apple...I checked a lot of boxes. Damn near most of them  I got Nana Cream which was a nice ADV until... Bae, Kilo cereal milk which will be my last to try out of the three. I did try a little and the other two were just more appealing.   15ml bottles of all 3. Bae is my first yogurt too. I don't get much yogurt flavour, just smoothness and the lychee is perfect. Sweet but not overwhelming. I blew through that bottle in 2 days.   I def think it's worth exploring, plus no commitment. Cheaper to pick up in person, of course but I just read they changed shipping costs so it's gone down a few bucks from the $10 I paid."

Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,Mighty84mike,3,Sun Jun 14 22:53:43 2015 UTC,"It all began on April 21st, 2015. My first visit to a local B&M Vape Shop to inquire about vaping. Being a pack a day smoker, I had no intentions of quitting. I actually liked smoking. Money isn't an issue, I wasn't strapped for cash, wasn't feeling ill, although always in the back of my mind, i wondered when i would stop smoking.  My internet gaming friend had a vape and always talked about it and how awesome it was. I was always interested in electronic cigarettes, but knew absolutely nothing about them. Finally, after being given a huge lesson on vapes and possible choices to get, I visited Spyder Vapes on April 21st. Spoke with Dan there, who probably wanted to punch me after all the questions i had asked.  I intended to vape and smoke simultaneously to somewhat curb my smoking habits. I walked out with an iStick 30w and a Nautilus Mini and my life changed. That same day, i only smoked 3 cigarettes. Never intended to cut down that drastically, it just happened. The next two days, i found myself only smoking 3 cigarettes a day without any desire to smoke any more than that. In the upcoming days from that, it was 1 cigarette a day, then within the week, zero.  I haven't had a cigarette for over a month and it's amazing!   Fast forward to last week, I was in the Dominican Republic, worried about vaping, transporting my setup, etc. It was surprisingly easy. No questions about my gear and everyone seemed to ""eye"" my setup in a sense of curiousness.   I have since upgraded my setup to an iStick 50w and Subtank. I rock the spydervapes band on my tank not only to protect it, although to support the shop that will save me money (yeah right) and save my life!  Thanks Spyder Vapes."
Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,muchvape2000,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:53:54 2015 UTC,I have the istick 50w and I'm getting a subtank soon. I ordered the nano but I still have a chance to chnage the order. Is that the mini or the nano?
Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,muchvape2000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:28:14 2015 UTC,I actually have both. In the pic is a mini. My girlfriend has the nano. I prefer the mini as it holds more juice. Isn't that much larger tbh and has the rebuildable base which is a great feature. The mini also sits nice and flush on the mod. Oh. And more airflow!
Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,muchvape2000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:30:55 2015 UTC,Does the nano still look okay on a 50w or is it noticeably too small?
Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,ShitBrixOfSteel,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:34:10 2015 UTC,To me. It looks real dinky. My gf has it on a 30w istick and it looks fine. It's not that bad really. I just prefer the mini as it has more benefits for a marginal price increase and siZe increase. Photos sometimes makes it look huge but when you actually see it. It's not that bad.
Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,DazVape,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:36:18 2015 UTC,Okay I think I'll cancel my nano order and switch to a mini
Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,ShitBrixOfSteel,0,Mon Jun 15 04:45:26 2015 UTC,"Be careful with that iStick, they have been known to autofire and even burst into flames."

Canadian_ecigarette,39unwg,MrC0oL,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:19:38 2015 UTC,Same with the m80 and now with the IPv4. I think people have too many expectations with China products and 50 dollar price tags. Thst being said. House fires are definitely something to be concerned about although it seems as if every week a new device is exploding. I am aware of the dangers regardless of the mod I own. Thanks :)

Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,ISellGroceries,4,Sun Jun 14 01:09:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend charging 18650 cells via USB in a mod.. Save yourself any problems and pick up a spare set of batteries and rotate
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,JDOGG8,2,Sun Jun 14 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this exactly. Look over on /r/electronic_cigarette at all the posts about exploding/malfunctioning Istick 50 Watt, Clouper Mini, IPV4. Smok Mx80s."

Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,Famoosh,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:32:49 2015 UTC,Same with istick 50w
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,muchvape2000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:30:46 2015 UTC,I think he was pointing out the faulty charge boards rather than the internal/external batteries
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,Awesummzzz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:21:03 2015 UTC,istick 50w LIPO internal (cheapass battery)   M80 LIPO internal (cheapass battery)  Cloupor mini was blowing up while idle not charging - it was definitely a dangerous device but noone is sure the charging circuitry was related to the issue.  IPV4 internal short unrelated to charging. Does not charge via USB at all.  smok M65&M50 and BT50 external 18650 battery with USB charging no issues reported as far as I know. I used my BT50 on USB for 6 months solid no issues.  People really need to stop spreading misinformation. 3/4 of those cases are not relevant to what OP asked for (external battery with usb charging capability) and the one that is was a general firebomb not specifically related to charging.
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,Vatigu,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"Just for future reference,  the iStick 50w has 2 18650's in it, not a LiPO pack"
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,Awesummzzz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"huh just found a tear down you're right, still - it's two internal batteries solders together with a poorly insulated wire and it autofired istick failures weren't related to USB charging."
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,Vatigu,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"True, just wanted to let you know. I never had autofire issues, mine just shorted out"
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,Awesummzzz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"The autofiring issues were related to the weak fore switch assembly on the original units. Any produced in the past few months have a much improved firing button (sticks out more, sturdier, stiffer) and doesn't suffer from the autofiring issues."
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,karmapopsicle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:13:47 2015 UTC,Yep but who I originally replied to blamed the USB charging when it was a totally different fault for all of the devices he listed.
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,Vatigu,2,Tue Jun 16 17:02:28 2015 UTC,"iPV2. HB-Mini. Subox KMAX. HANA mods. The list goes on, almost all regulated boxes will charge via USB."

Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,kkeeiiggaann,2,Sun Jun 14 06:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'll throw my vote in with /u/abacacus ...carry spare 18650s. You can't really go wrong with a 2x18650 or 4x18650 case, stocked with freshly-charged backup batteries before you leave the house. You don't want to leave high-drain batteries in your car on a hot day, but you probably already knew that.   As /u/JDOGG8 mentioned, the alternative is just a little too worrisome to responsibly recommend it at this point. Do so at your own risk."
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,SlovenianSocket,2,Sun Jun 14 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"Ipv mini 2, I've been charging mine through USB for 2 months now and it's still going strong."
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,muchvape2000,2,Sun Jun 14 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is common knowledge, but why is it considered dangerous to charge with USB? What exactly is it that causes harm to the batteries?"
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,obzilla,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:44:19 2015 UTC,I believe from reading on Reddit that many mods don't have high quality chargers and they aren't properly regulated so they sometimes screw up and cause issues.
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,abacacus,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:31:44 2015 UTC,If you can live 40 watts most DNA40 devices charge via USB.
Canadian_ecigarette,39rgxq,SuminderJi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:42:18 2015 UTC,"Why? It's faster to just swap them out, and carrying 1-2 batteries isn't that difficult. My battery case (holds 4 18650's, I usually carry two spares) is smaller than my wallet."

Canadian_ecigarette,39nebu,kintyre,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:34:53 2015 UTC,"Shoot me your order number, I'll ship you a 30ml! :)  The device is almost smaller than an rDNA....soo tempting! No zip charging though...that's a godsend."

Canadian_ecigarette,39nebu,Lampburglar,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:36:08 2015 UTC,"Haha, at this point I'd just like to get my subtank to have some nice flavour in it. I wrapped a new .5 coil, though, and it seems to be doing better. I think I may have just burnt the juice that was in the tank before.   But warm cheesecake tastes weird. :("
Canadian_ecigarette,39nebu,Peterkizz,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:45:16 2015 UTC,"IMO the subtank is sub-par for taste.   Your .5 coil, multi wire or simple macro coil?  Are you in Montreal? If so I'll lend you a Kayfun to experience the difference :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,39nebu,Coldshower39,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:01:28 2015 UTC,"Just a macro coil. 24 gauge kanthal, 6 wraps. Cotton bacon, not that it makes any real difference.   I feel like everyone is like ""but the subtank is soooo great"" and I'm like ""my protank had better flavour :( ""   I am in Montreal area - NDG."

Canadian_ecigarette,39nebu,ydm6669,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Hey Phil! I recently bought a subtank mini from your store, is there a way to only purchase the box itself? I'm not sure why but they are only sold in kits from what I've seen up until now."
Canadian_ecigarette,39nebu,lilfunky1,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:20:09 2015 UTC,Unfortunately Kanger doesn't sell the box alone yet. It will come eventually.

Canadian_ecigarette,39n3vk,CuBu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:37:52 2015 UTC,I just toss mine in my spare cup holder it's got a little slit that fits the tank which stops it from moving around
Canadian_ecigarette,39n3vk,golden_rhino,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:47:48 2015 UTC,"If you want to impress me, airbrush a wizard holding a mod on the side of the van. Shag carpeting on the dashboard is also a nice touch."
Canadian_ecigarette,39n3vk,D3adkl0wn,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:23:13 2015 UTC,Find someone who will do it for me! I'd really love a space scene though. It had shag carpet on dash but it needed to be removed. I cant find a good deal on new carpet. I want hardwood floors and shag walls. But I have to wait until the I do body work first. Everything will come together eventually.
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,Filiab,4,Fri Jun 12 20:20:59 2015 UTC,Most stores use 0 nic for their sampler. If you buy the same juice with nic it may skew the juice profile a bit.
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,HappyDude1111,3,Fri Jun 12 21:24:49 2015 UTC,Can you describe exactly what you think the problem is? I've been using the same set up and i'm loving it.
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,gotlieb1993,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"Whatever ejuice I use, seems the flavour becomes mute and is non-existant after the first few inhales.   After that, just feels like warm vapour with not much flavour."
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,TheVaporist,2,Fri Jun 12 20:39:44 2015 UTC,"When you test it in the store, what atomizer is used, what mod and what power setting and finally how much nic mg in the tester in store and what you purchase?"
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"Testing with subtank and ileaf, which is actually what made me switch over.  Testing usually is 3mg, which is the same that I buy.   I really feel like I'm just going to end up going back to analogs :("
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,oler,2,Sat Jun 13 05:21:57 2015 UTC,"When testing in the store, which coils are they using? are you using the exact same? what about the airflow?  Honestly, I'd suggest you go to the store with your setup and juice, and compare both. It's possible you are simply getting used to the flavor or have the ""grass is greener on the other side"" syndrome (which happens to all of us at some point).  Where are you located?"
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,oler,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:39:20 2015 UTC,"Montreal. I'll give that suggestion a shot as well, thanks"
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,Winter_knights,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:44:46 2015 UTC,What PG/VG are you vaping?
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,VapeEscapeMTL,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:39:12 2015 UTC,Max VG
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,VapeEscapeMTL,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I do max VG as well. I get great flavour out of my 30w, but using an Atlantis (max air intake), vaping around 13W. Are you maybe buying cheap juice or subtle flavouring?"
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,greekdude1821,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:06:01 2015 UTC,What wattage are you vaping at? Subtank tastes like shit over 25. Maybe try a different tank like a Starre or Maganus or Arctic. They allow for much higher wattage.
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,dvanha,0,Sat Jun 13 06:05:14 2015 UTC,I play around between 20-24.5
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,kintyre,2,Sat Jun 13 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"Could be a few things, you've been vaping for a year, so you may have already tried these things out, but if not, maybe this will help.  1) With the Subtank, I put a few drops in the coil head and a few drops around the side so that it absorbs the liquid and reduces wicking time.  2) I'll close the airflow at the bottom and take a few primer puffs to speed up wicking. Try not to puff too hard or you'll get juice spitback.  3) Juice in tanks in the store sit for a while and the demo bottles are usually pretty steeped as it could take some time before they need to be refilled. Also, with the same atomizer in there for a long duration to absorb the flavour, it's possible it's more pronounced because it's been sitting in the same tank and atomizer for a longer period of time.  4) It shouldn't necessarily be the case, but sometimes, you may just have to steep the juice. There are many different ways to do it. Often times just take the top off, let it breathe in a cool, dark place, shake it up and try it. With glass bottles, occasionally I will let them stand open in hot water for about a half hour, breathe for 2-3 hours, and keep in a cool, dark place overnight. Shake it up in the morning and more often than not, the flavours that were muted become way more pronounced. Don't do the hot water thing with plastic bottles, I would think the plastic would deteriorate and compromise the flavour of the juice.  Sorry for the long post, hope it helps or you find a solution that works for you!"
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,Catmandingo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:00:07 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the detailed answer!   I pretty much have just been leaving my juices out on a shelf of my TV stand.  Maybe my storage is an issue as well.   Thanks again! Will report with my results!
Canadian_ecigarette,39mlad,Famoosh,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"No problem at all, I hope it works out! Just make sure that you don't leave bottles in direct sunlight. It will deteriorate the flavoring and nic and make your juice taste like arse!"
Canadian_ecigarette,39n97s,sansaset,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:19:14 2015 UTC,This is the first time I've heard of this tank. Any particular reason you're looking for this over any of the other sub ohm tanks?

Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,KabamaWekesa,3,Fri Jun 12 17:50:39 2015 UTC,40-60 is a little low once you factor in the price of a tank and a mod in Canada. I think the subox by kangertech is ~70 but you still need to buy a battery and some juice. That's probably around the cheapest you'll get for sub ohm though.
Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,jungleismassiv3,3,Fri Jun 12 17:53:33 2015 UTC,"I've been to Dash Vapes in Richmond Hill, and they have a Toronto location as well.  I can vouch for the RH location being awesome, I assume the Toronto one is equally so.  Also I've been to two different Vape 29 shops (one in the beaches, one Queen & Spadina-ish) and they're awesome too.  But I gotta say my favourite e-juices so far are coming out of www.TheVaporist.org in Montreal.  Free shipping on double/triple packs/super-sampler packs makes it not so horrible to order :-)"
Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,lilfunky1,2,Fri Jun 12 19:20:34 2015 UTC,Vapor North is off Brock Rd in Pickering. The side bar should have a link to a list of other vendors
Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,va3zai,2,Fri Jun 12 18:05:38 2015 UTC,I'd get started on the new subbox and subtank mini starter set. You need to up your budget a bit trust me.
Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,The_Stiffness,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:37:03 2015 UTC,What would you say is a good budget for a decent mod?
Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,The_Stiffness,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say put around at least $120 into a tank ($40) + battery($60). You sound like me 6 months ago when I started. I picked up an istick 50w and a Subtank mini for just under $120. I wouldn't recommend the Istick as people are having major and dangerous issues with them, I wish I had spent a bit more actually as you don't wanna mess around with cheap mods. The subtank I'd highly recommend as you can buy the prebuilt coils for them. It also comes with a rebuildable deck, a bit of cotton and a few coils to get you into rebuilding. It took me about 4 months to want more than 50 watts of power, as I'm getting into drippers and more  interesting  coil building so I'm looking at picking up a sigelli 150w which is about $130, and unlike the Istick I have to buy my own 2x $10 batteries for it."
Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,The_Stiffness,3,Fri Jun 12 19:35:21 2015 UTC,If I had started vaping today I would grabbed this
Canadian_ecigarette,39lzbv,The_Stiffness,2,Fri Jun 12 19:49:09 2015 UTC,I found out about this the day after I had already bought an istick 30w with the subtank mini. Still can't go wrong with the set up but this combo is just beautiful.

I don't think it's way more. The ipv4 is having problems venting, failing, exploding etc. I'm happy to pay $75 to avoid that. Even if that werent the case, the build quality on the Snowwolf makes it worth it to me. I'm a sucker for solid construction. The ipvs have always felt cheap to me. That might not matter to you, or you might not have the spare money to be able to justify it. I have no idea.  So, it's up to you. I'm happy with my purchase and I feel like I got what I paid for.

I wanted one to be honest but then I really though I had no need at all for one, it's not any more powerful or useful then devices I've got and doesn't have the temp control or power I want from my next device.   All in all I don't think people would be disappointed with it, I must say it is very visually appealing and I like the sunk in fire button as well."

Canadian_ecigarette,39hq65,majorvapes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"I definitely suggest the delta for like a sit at home laze around tank, not so great for driving where you can't track you juice levels and such, but the flavour is top notch, comparable to basic builds on a rda the chimney style juice control could are awesome.   I'll probably get the Rba deck from FT along with some more coils soon"
Canadian_ecigarette,39hq65,majorvapes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:55:47 2015 UTC,The fact that it has an rba deck is one of the only reasons i considered it. I don't buy replaceable coils so almost all of my tanks are rta's or have an rba head. If you do get the rba let us know what you think of it when you get it.
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,HardWorking4Pennys,6,Thu Jun 11 21:20:14 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a rebuildable equivalent piece of gear, a single-coil RTA might be your best bet. You could run a dual-coil RTA on your device as well, and build as low as 0.5 (IIRC), but if you're satisfied at resistances of the Nautilus coils at 1.6/1.8, a single-coil tank would do the trick and is quite easy/comfortable to build.  You'll also need some kanthal and wick. I purchase mine from Lightning Vapes using promo code ohmsweetohm for 17% off. Even with the exchange rate and shipping, their prices are still better than Canadian vendors I've seen (unfortunately, I suppose). I use Cotton Bacon for wick, which I've also purchased from LV.   Other wicking materials include Japanese organic cotton pads or cellucotton (rayon) from beauty supply stores or online vendors. People vape with pretty well any unbleached, untreated, organic cotton. It is generally dirt cheap...my preference for Cotton Bacon is simply that I haven't used other stuff because a pack lasts me for months and months and it works perfectly for my purposes. Haven't had a need to try other stuff as yet, but it definitely isn't the cheapest option.  A couple other optional tools I'd recommend getting would be the Coil Master coiling tool and ceramic-tipped tweezers. I picked both of those up from LV as well, but they're available all over the place. The Coil Master makes wrapping coils extremely, unbelievably easy and comfortable. The ceramic tweezers make it possible to pinch coils while they're hot and/or firing. Neither is totally necessary, but they've both been incredibly useful to me.   I would suggest strongly that you invest in an ohm reader, but I've seen so many people who just use the internal reader on their mods that it feels like this is an optional tool. I still use mine, but many don't seem to bother anymore. If you're ever going mechanical, however, you need one.  Here's my build kit. Not pictured are the spools of kanthal and my ohm reader. I picked up the zipper case at a dollar store. They're old pics, though, and I now have a flush cutter rather than nail clippers for snipping wire. If you're away from your build station (desk, table, etc.) often, you might want to seek out a little kit like this to store everything. Atomizers come with spares and screwdrivers and the like, so it is convenient to keep it all in one place."
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:47:56 2015 UTC,Alright So what type of Kanthal should I use if I go with the Lemo 2?
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"I'd watch some reviews before settling on the Lemo 2. I've heard some unfavourable stuff about that tank. I'd say you'd likely be better off with a Subtank Mini and the RBA section, but there are plenty of options out there for RTAs, so shop around a bit before you spend your money. If you like a tighter draw, you might be more into a Kayfun. If you like more airflow, the Subtank Mini is probably the way to go.  For a single-coil RTA, I'd say 26 or 28 gauge would be your best bet."
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:41:49 2015 UTC,lol so many options .. to be franks I have not seen any bad reviews of the Lemo 2 .. if you have any plz share as I'm really tempted to buy this ..
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,CuBu,3,Fri Jun 12 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"Tons and tons and tons of options out there these days. It's great, but it can definitely get confusing. I guess that's why we're here! :)  Reviews from reviewers I trust:  Phil Busardo, VapinGreek, Ruby Roo  There are plenty of reviews out there, but these guys are pretty thorough so I tend to take their information a little more seriously than most. They're not hating on it by any means, but there are some factors mentioned that are worth considering.  Personally, I avoid Eleaf products after having some very bad experiences with them. They really aren't my kinda company in general. They hit the mark in specs for price, generally, but they're not good at quality or service.   The Lemo was my first RTA, the Lemo Drop was my 2nd. They mostly did what they were supposed to do, and the Lemo 2 theoretically solves the shortcomings of its predecessors. They don't seem to have given it more airflow, however, as is evident in Phil's measuring of the hole beneath the coil -- that's one area I wished was improved in the originals. That said, it should be substantially more airflow when wide open than your Nautilus.  If/when you get it, from everything I've seen, there will be lots and lots of machine oil. It is real obvious in Phil's review that someone washed it before shipping it to him. Other reviewers weren't so fortunate, nor have any owners been that I've seen here or in other communities online. They all report that it needs a very thorough cleaning before use, but I suppose we should clean everything before we use it anyways. That's not really a make-or-break detail, but it does show that Eleaf is cutting corners...the first two versions didn't have a speck of machine oil out of the box.   The top fill seems a little half-assed, as Phil gripes about in his video. They did what vapers wanted and made it more convenient to fill, but they didn't go all the way and make it super user-friendly. Follow the instructions and it should work out for you.  Every tank has its own little eccentricities that one must accustom oneself to in order to vape it satisfactorily, the Lemo 2 seems to be no exception. It isn't the worst purchase you could make, and I'm sure you'll be so in love with the performance from any rebuildable tank that the potential negatives will soon be overshadowed by the positives.   I just plain don't like, respect or trust the brand that makes it. They simply do not treat their customers and vapers with respect, and so they don't get my money anymore. Don't let my bias stop you, though...what matters is that you're vaping and you're enjoying the experience. How much you care about how the company handles their business is totally up to you, and I have no business telling you how to spend your money.   Bottom line, you've got options and in this industry where everything is unfamiliar and constantly changing, you always want to shop around and get as much info as you can before dropping your hard-earned dollars on gear.  If I were shopping for a dual-coil RTA these days, I'd probably go with something like a Kayfun v4 or an Erlkonigen/Erlprinz (more likely a clone, though, given the artisan pricing on the originals is well beyond my budget). I've personally found more satisfaction in dual-coil RTAs of late (vaping a Goblin as I type this), and am curious about the Goliath, Billow v2, and others. Airflow and flavour seem substantially more to my preference in the dual-coil RTAs I've tried, but the Subtank Mini compares very well to those.  Oh, last point...ST Mini has greater juice capacity than the Lemo 2 in a smaller profile. If that matters, it's worth considering. Also, I can't tell for sure, but I don't think they improved the wicking channels over the original Lemos, so higher VG stuff isn't terribly chainvapable in my experience. A few hits dries the original Lemo wicks no matter how short I keep them, or how wide my coil. But that's all subjective, and it's all going to be better than replaceable atomizer heads anyways."

Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,CuBu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:26:13 2015 UTC,Probably just a tank for RBA since I already have the nautilus mini that i can get pre built coils.
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,HappyDude1111,3,Thu Jun 11 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is the Lemo 2, definitely considered to be one of the best, and great bang for the buck, it is a bigger tank (5ml I think) then you wanted   Another option would be the Subtank mini which is very nice and a common tank for people to build on. (Also features the pre built coils )"
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,raisedbytuttles,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:42:57 2015 UTC,Alright So what type of Kanthal should I use if I go with the Lemo 2?
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,HappyDude1111,2,Thu Jun 11 23:07:56 2015 UTC,"I think that a little 26guage comes with it, you'd be best off with that size or 28, I wouldn't go to much higher with your device as the resistance might get too low. I've used 28 in my Subtank before and it works well, I find 26 easier to work with starting out though I must say."
Canadian_ecigarette,39i1gs,raisedbytuttles,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:15:56 2015 UTC,Yup sounds about right just watch a video and the guys was using 26 gauge and 28 gauge. With the Lemo.  Thanks

Canadian_ecigarette,39dfzg,dvanha,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:37:56 2015 UTC,Oooo let me know how cotton tail taste.
Canadian_ecigarette,39dfzg,kemekokitten,2,Thu Jun 11 22:54:47 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat with Thug Juice..... But I have to say added to any other fruity flavour it adds just a hint of juicy menthol that I love.   When I run out I'll definitely pick up more just for mixing.
Canadian_ecigarette,39dfzg,kemekokitten,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:59:12 2015 UTC,It's so true! I generally don't like fruit flavours. I love fruit but I drip and I find most of them hurt my throat. But thug really rounds it together.

Both great in an rda cause they're 100%vg. Wrath by Vaporus was really interesting with a solid green tea on the exhale, vury nice but 50/50 so probably best in an rta or clearo! I have mixed emotions on Bandit's Breath from VaporNorth but enjoyed it for at least the first little while and it comes in max vg and was nice in an rda. Haven't found a good fruit tobacco that didn't taste like a car freshener. Let me know if you find one!"

Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,obzilla,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:23:10 2015 UTC,"I love love love them, maybe too much because I've become accustomed to it and find many other vapes not sweet enough.   I do know that if you ask that they'll jack the flavor up, perhaps they would do the opposite, a 'tone it down a notch' special. Would be worth asking."
Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,Swelton,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:33:14 2015 UTC,When I first started vaping I absolutely loved evaperated. I was using an aerotank. When I moved up to my subtank mini they just didn't taste the same. Not sure why but I just can't vape em anymore. Which is a shame cuz I loved frosty's breath. Maybe I'll try it again max vg in a lower nic.
Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,sansaset,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:36:11 2015 UTC,"this is why.  personally I couldn't vape anything over 6mg nic subohming..  I love Evaperateds flavors and they taste great, but unfortunately there is too much sweetener to the point where I'll gunk a coil up bad after one tank."
Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,Swelton,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"I dropped my nic immediately after I started subohming. 12 to 6, now I have like 15 bottles of 12 mg juice that I keep trying to pawn off on the guys at work still using aerotanks and nautilus'."

Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,jungleismassiv3,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"I found that once you go to subohm, the sweetener becomes unbearable. Evaporated, Dr fog, and halcyon vapours are all bad for it. I've got a bunch of nearly full bottles that I can't touch. It leaves the worst exhale/after taste and it destroys coils."
Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,morbidangel27,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:10:31 2015 UTC,"My order should be coming in about a week from evaperated. Two week shipping sucks, i'll be getting the xpress next time. Hopefully canada post is lying to me about the shipping time."

Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,vi0lent,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"I find it satisfies my sweet tooth, so I really like it, but the majority of the ones I've tried have been very sweet."
Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,karmapopsicle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:21:43 2015 UTC,"I found their stuff pretty sweet too after I stepped up to a subtank mini. Steeped Dreams was almost sickeningly sweet, and I'm the kind of person who would live off candy if I didn't care about my teeth. If my next order seems too sweet I'm gonna dilute them with some VG."
Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,orgy84,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"They use a lot of added sweetener (sucralose), like a few other popular brands (Twelve Monkeys for instance), to get that very prominent sweetness. Personally that's all I can taste and it makes the juice unvapeable for me.   I do know that plenty of people absolutely love it though. Definitely recommend using it in rebuildables though, as sucralose is an absolute coil mangler."
Canadian_ecigarette,398c7y,setzRFD,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"I found the same with evaperated and twelve monkeys. I still have over 240 ml of evaperated that is just too sweet. I cant even give it away to friends. Love the flavor, hate sweetener."

If you are interested in going to the office I would  email liza.magcale@eliaise.com to let her know so that someone is there to help you . She is the owner.

They always sell out decently fast. Ive tried both and I love splode the most. The only downside is they only sell 120ml and I dont want to pay 60$ for juice lol

I have the Sigelei 150 and I love it, I've held the 100 and it's frigin awesome too. I hear nothing but good things about all the mvp devices, I've never actually held one though. I'd say it depends if you wanna wait man, by the time vapecan rolls around there will probably be some new cool mods out with tc completely worked out (like the one theyre making that will work on kanthal woooo).

Canadian_ecigarette,396oap,setzRFD,0,Tue Jun 9 19:42:34 2015 UTC,"It is nice, but not for its flavor in my opinion. As /u/frnzy points out, it doesn't have much of a taste. It's sweet and a little bitter. Some say it's just cotton candy, when others say just tobacco. To me it's like if you took A LOT of cotton candy, so much so the sweet turns to bitter (like tobacco). It feels like tobacco even though doesn't taste much like it. It's an unusual flavor to say the least, but very enjoyable."
Canadian_ecigarette,396oap,frnzy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:57:09 2015 UTC,Also because of how mild it is I think nic level changes the flavour more than other juices.
Canadian_ecigarette,396oap,setzRFD,0,Tue Jun 9 20:01:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. I always found the TH to be much more in this flavor. At the time I alternated between 12mg and 18mg, and in a clearomizer the 12mg bottle I bought felt above 18mg. It's got an oomph to it."
Canadian_ecigarette,396oap,frnzy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:24:49 2015 UTC,"slightly sweet, doesn't have much of a taste. Thats why I like it, goes with everything.   Also good at cutting other juice if you want."

Canadian_ecigarette,395nz6,SteepedMonkeyBrains,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:38:05 2015 UTC,"Sovereign actually re-tooled their flavours and managed to make them even better, so the sale is to clear out the original versions. It will last until they sell out, then they're back to regular price after I restock the new versions."
Canadian_ecigarette,395nz6,DotModThrowaway,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:26:19 2015 UTC,I didn't like the ones I received so I guess I'll have to try the new ones :0
Canadian_ecigarette,395nz6,604,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:57:23 2015 UTC,I thought Sovereign was really gross. I don't know why it just tastes really bad to me. Though ya one day shipping from Alberta to Ontario got me too. Incredibly fast.
Canadian_ecigarette,395er6,Ghoulsfrank,2,Tue Jun 9 11:22:33 2015 UTC,"When you get your package, throw the batteries on the nightcore d2 charger. Surely the display will provide you with your answer quickly."
Canadian_ecigarette,395er6,Adolph_Bernanke,2,Tue Jun 9 11:48:06 2015 UTC,99% of the time they come about half way charged. I would suggest you fully charge them before using them. Usually takes several hours so it's good you bought extras. I store mine fully charged but they never sit for more than a day or two without being used.
Canadian_ecigarette,395er6,majorvapes,2,Tue Jun 9 11:54:33 2015 UTC,"These batteries don't like to be stored with a charge more, or less, than ~40%. It will diminish the battery's life."
Canadian_ecigarette,395er6,Sens420,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:56:09 2015 UTC,All the batteries I have ordered came basically dead. You will need to charge them but good thing you ordered the d2 charger!
Canadian_ecigarette,395er6,dirtychopstickz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"I may suggest that you use a volt meter to read the voltage on your batteries. A voltage of between 3.5 and 3.8 is considered low volts and most batteries will arrive like this. Charging your batteries to full will give you a charge of about 4.16 to 4.2 volts. When the charging has finished let the batteries rest for 30 minutes before you use them. It may be a good idea to number your batteries, and record their voltage to keep track of how they are performing."
Canadian_ecigarette,395er6,V8per,0,Tue Jun 9 22:29:38 2015 UTC,"Every battery I've received has come with a minimal 3.6 volt charge on it. Which is to say, basically dead and in need of charging."
Canadian_ecigarette,397jv6,CraveeJuice,3,Tue Jun 9 20:43:16 2015 UTC,Have you done anything yet to improve the overall quality of your juice? I keep seeing coupons and promotions pop up. I also see that you go by crave essence instead of gourmet e juice. So what else has changed?
Canadian_ecigarette,397jv6,RobertDF902,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:58:54 2015 UTC,"Yep we sure have! We have removed a lot of flavours that we were having flavour balance issues with, as well as revitalized old recipes to ensure that what is going out still works for the new equipment that is constantly being released!  We have changed our name to Crave Essence so that our branding is not JUST targeted towards the ecig industry. We have found a lot of difficulty and speedbumps/detours we've had to go around to be able to properly function in Canada so we are broadening our market into the food industry as that was our plan all along as well :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,397jv6,setzRFD,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:27:38 2015 UTC,flavoring for coffee   What?
Canadian_ecigarette,397jv6,Jack_Lad,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"Why not? They are food flavourings, after all, and what they were originally designed for - and in a world where e liquid might end up banned, I could see people buying ""coffee flavouring"" and nicotine separately.   Really no different from the Mio drops you can get for water now."
Canadian_ecigarette,397jv6,setzRFD,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"This is exactly it! We are on track to release several products... the coffee flavouring, alcohol flavourings, imported & local coffee beans, and well.. anything you can add flavour to! It is similar to Mio as you mentioned, but we are continuing on using organic ingredients to offer a chemical free flavour experience!"
Canadian_ecigarette,397jv6,Jack_Lad,0,Thu Jun 11 18:29:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, nothing wrong with it, just odd seeing an e-liquid vendor branch out into this kind of thing. I guess it's not so odd when Vapemeet has lip balm and I contemplated scented candles at a time."

Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,TSmashVapes,3,Tue Jun 9 01:06:12 2015 UTC,I'd say an MVP V3.0+ or a Smok M80+ would be good choices. Many better options than the istick50 at the moment :)
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,dotvapes,2,Tue Jun 9 01:32:57 2015 UTC,"I should have asked you first! Plus the Delta Ii only works on the IPV and I kind of hate it. So ugly. The IPV I mean. I've read some concerning things about the Smok, no?"
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,dotvapes,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:34 2015 UTC,"Well, truthfully, it will only take so long for any device to receive some kind of kickback due to a mishap or misfire, it is only a matter of time. All regulated devices use chips and all chips can have an issue from a factory. The problem starts being much more extremely concerning when this failure rate is very high. I think the M80+ is a great and future proof device as an upgrade. I run a rotation of 3 of them with no issues :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,TheVaporist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:35:09 2015 UTC,That's true. I guess I started vaping at a time when the istick50 is just a collassal failure and it's scary.

Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,thumpx,2,Tue Jun 9 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"Ive said it before and will continue to say it. Sigelei all the way. the 100 or the 150 w. Not very compact, but makes up for it in power, quality and battery duration."
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,Adolph_Bernanke,4,Tue Jun 9 01:32:53 2015 UTC,I love my seglie. I bought it a couple moths ago and have never had an issue with it. I have the kangertech sub tank mini so I can still have a really basic build but I love both of them.
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,thumpx,3,Tue Jun 9 02:14:43 2015 UTC,Also second the sigelei. Only thing that gets me is sometimes damaging my batteries putting them in...why in the hell are there 2 sharp pieces right by where the batteries supposed to go in. Other than that though it's an awesome device !
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,obzilla,2,Tue Jun 9 12:31:52 2015 UTC,"hmmm. not sure what you mean by the 2 sharp pieces. I know the batteries are a tight fit. But since I started inserting the batteries in the mod perfectly straight and even (NOT putting positive first then pushing down on negative. What I do is Insert both ends at the same time), I have not had any issues with my wraps."
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:53:09 2015 UTC,"Ooo thanks for the tip! I put positive then negative heh. There's a small rectangular piece where each end of the battery goes. It's not really sharp if you touch it, but to a battery wrap I'd say it's pretty sharp heh :p I'll try your method next time I insert my batteries though, thanks!"
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,obzilla,-1,Tue Jun 9 17:21:49 2015 UTC,Bit of a jump from an istick 20' especially for someone not chasing that kind of power.

When I see this I assume shes a bit worried that 50w might not be enough. What do you take from it?  Besides, many people have a sig 150 and vape at very low wattage. They use it for quality, battery power and that piece of mind that they have the wattage."

Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,Robbie-R,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:17:23 2015 UTC,I may possibly vape a lot? 10-12mls a day in two Nautilus. Two flavours. Plus maybe naut mini at night with a third flavour depending on mood.
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,dvanha,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:27:48 2015 UTC,I do just shy of 2 nautilus mini tanks in mine a day but Im at 15w.. i've been looking at the mpv 3 myself but i dont have a reason to pull the trigger unless i wanna go subohm
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:59:51 2015 UTC,I dropped to 10w to extend battery life and found that I don't mind it. A few watt drop saves me and extra hour or two of battery.
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:31:17 2015 UTC,"I have a subox, rebuilding my heads at .5 - .8 ohms. running between 20  - 22.5 watts, medium to heavy vapeing.

It makes no sense, but the subox seems like a battery hog."

Its only been available for a couple days so we don't know if its a fire hazard yet, but the eVic-VT  looks like the best bang for your buck mod on the market.   This is likely going to be my next mod (I use a 30 watt Istick) but I am going to wait a few weeks just in case they have any issues."
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:55:36 2015 UTC,That ones really nice too. And I'll hold off too lol.for a month unless I decide MVP or sigeli

Local B&M sells them for 159,99 CAD.   http://www.vaporcube.com/sigelei-150w-variable-wattage-apv-box-mod.html"
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,thumpx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:25:17 2015 UTC,Whoa nice! Thanks. I'll def look into that.
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,thumpx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"Have you tried any sub-ohm vaping? Are you thinking you're gonna want to go that route?  I gotta say, I know it sounds like a bitch to use removable batteries and a charger, but now that I've tried it with the Sigelei 150w, I could never go back. If you're dead-set against it, though, you might wanna consider an MVP. I've never owned one, but they've got a seriously great reputation for quality. They've got 20w, 30w and 60w versions and will be dropping a temperature control (with KANTHAL NO LESS!) version at some point.   Subox kit is going to need a little time before I can start recommending it like so many are doing...it really hasn't been on the market that long, and when recommendations start flooding in for mods that are brand new on the market I just look over at my useless iStick 50w to remind me of why I probably shouldn't join the hypetrain. Kanger is pretty solid, though, so who knows...maybe it's awesome.   If 50w isn't gonna cut it for you, I think you're pretty well going to have to go the removable battery route. The better manufacturers don't seem interested in releasing a non-replaceable >50w box. Yeah, there's the Smok m80...note that I said ""the better manufacturers."" There are quite a few boxes out that do micro-usb charging with replaceable batteries, but so many reliable people have said that it isn't a great idea to charge via that method that I'm personally just going to avoid doing so. Got me a Nitecore and I'm happy."
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,morbidangel27,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:26:24 2015 UTC,"I did get a Delta 2 to start learning lung hits. It's a bit of a learning curve as it's not natural for me but I doubt I'll ever rebuild. Shaky hands and no patience lol. That damn hypetrain! It's just so pretty! But yes, I've been holding off waiting for reports to come in as well.   What about leaving batteries charging overnight? Seems to be a no-no but I'm notorious for forgetting stuff."
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,kintyre,2,Tue Jun 9 11:28:41 2015 UTC,"Lung-hits just kinda happened, for me. I started doing them first with vaping, and it just became the thing I do. Not for any real reason, mind you. Just the way it went.   I always said I'd never get into rebuildables, but then I did. Shaky hands and no patience aren't problems of mine, mind you...I was just tired of poor-quality coils. The market has changed considerably since then, but I stand by it. The cost difference is a huge factor for me.   I can't emphasize enough that I don't know what I'm talking about when I say this, but my personal feelings about overnight charging are as follows: I trust a dedicated charger much more than on-board charging for unattended use. Is it actually any safer to leave 18650s charging on a Nitecore or the like? I honestly have no idea...but that's what I think, and that's what I do.   Either way, if it is a serious concern of yours, err on the side of safety and put the mod or the charger/batteries in a fire/explosion-proof container. Metal, ceramic...something like that. I've heard a lot of talk about LiPo charging bags that are fireproof, but I've also heard that some of them are totally ineffective. If I were seriously concerned about it, I'd use a metal container of some sort.   Battery safety tips abound out there if you look for them, and if you're ever in need of clarification about anything, there are many knowledgeable folks around here who are always happy to answer questions. Don't hesitate to ask...your safety is worth it.  Edit: I assume I earned a downvote by badmouthing Smok. I haven't owned an m80, so I really can't speak for the device. They did, however, earn their poor rep before the m80 was released, and then they dropped that device with temperature control that doesn't work. They did wisely allow for software upgrades, though, which is definitely something I'll credit them for doing -- more manufacturers should do so. I would absolutely recommend searching the various vaping subs for user experiences before you decide to buy one, though...and that goes for any device."
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,obzilla,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:13:30 2015 UTC,"I've been careful to not overnight charge. But it's a pain in the ass when you only have a few hours in the evening to do so. I have no trust in the bags lol. So you make total sense in that removing them and having them in a dedicated charger seems safer and more reliable.   Right now, I'm debating between the MVP and seigeli 100. I'll have to hold them both. Smok is out of the running judged only by what I've read in ECR. IPV4 is too new for my taste. I like older stuff that's been around and had user experience.   I really appreciate you taking the time to run things down for me :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,Lampburglar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:21:05 2015 UTC,Someone on another forum suggested the Ceramic Flower Pot (Without a hole in the bottom) just the other day for Istick 50 watt & Clouper Mini Users.  Sounds like very good advice considering how many of these mods are melting down.
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,obzilla,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:28:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid. I don't need to bring potential problems into my house for the sake of vaping, you know? Not worth it."
Canadian_ecigarette,393p2l,morbidangel27,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there...the IPV4 isn't for me. The Sigelei 100w+ is the one you want, not the 100w...but I'd say you're better off with the 150w if you're gonna get either. Price difference is pretty much negligible. Only downside: no swooshy logo lines on the side. Sigelei evidently had an issue with the lip of the button assembly catching the button surface sometimes if it was pressed on an angle, causing it to stay pressed. That'll be different in the 100w+/150w. They might still be selling the 100w with the improved button (no idea), but you may as well go with the updated version just to be sure.   The MVP and the Sigeleis are fairly different beasts. Price for watt is never a great way to judge a mod, though. A decision between those two would come down to whether or not I wanted internal or swappable batteries. To have a couple spare batteries in a plastic case, for me, is super convenient...but my Sig 150w is a bulky beast, and I just upgraded my belt to keep my pants up for when I've got it in my pocket. Decisions, decisions...buy them both. ;)"

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) administers more than 90 acts, regulations, and international agreements on behalf of other federal departments and agencies, the provinces, and the territories. We examine any imported item that comes into Canada by mail that is suspected to contain goods mentioned in the Customs Tariff or any goods that are prohibited, controlled, or regulated under any act of Parliament.  For the majority of mail items, the CBSA will release them as they are presented by the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) to our officers. Should further processing be required either by the CBSA or by another government department in order to make a release decision, or during periods of significant mail volumes, processing times may increase. Once an item has been released, it is returned to the Canada Post for final delivery.

Canadian_ecigarette,393gzi,wtfAlouette,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:38:44 2015 UTC,I've had packages go through in as little as a few minutes or as long as six weeks. You can never tell with cbsa and there's nothing you can do while they hold your mail hostage. If it's juice and it gets caught it'll get sent back and you'll eventually see something like 'origin post is preparing for shipment' on your tracking and then you can watch as it makes it's way back to wherever it came from. Expect a letter in the mail around two or three weeks later. If it helps I've only ever had one shipment sent back out of many many dozens.

So, here I am, a potential client demanding to a vendor, you demand it from the distributor, and voila, supply and demand. Honestly I bet you make a killing if you got 120s in. $1 ml is just too much to be spending on the regular."

Canadian_ecigarette,393f0j,Lampburglar,2,Mon Jun 8 23:47:34 2015 UTC,"Twisted in an RTA is pretty ambitious. I wouldn't even try. Get yourself a dripper to experiment with that.  You might be able to do it with 26 or 28, but seems like it'd have to be small diameter with a lot of wraps to fit and not toast your soul."
Canadian_ecigarette,393f0j,obzilla,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:53:26 2015 UTC,"You can make twisted 26 work, but it has to be around 2.4mm in diameter at most. It also reqires a lot of tweaking to keep from shorting out.   The best i've done is 2.4mm 28g wrapped in 32g claptons in my cuthulu and it was a really tight squeeze."
Canadian_ecigarette,393f0j,EL400,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:09:34 2015 UTC,Twisted works in RTA man. I have a twisted 5 wrap 2mm dia build on my Zephyrus RBA which is fken tiny.  I also put Clapton and twisted builds into my Cthulhu so it will fit.  The only thing is you will probably melt the insulator. I melted mine with the Claptons I think but it could've been the twisted build too since I put so much wattage through it.
Canadian_ecigarette,393f0j,sansaset,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:23:05 2015 UTC,Dual 26 becomes a 22 in diameter.  Dual 28 on 2mm inner diameter should fit.
Canadian_ecigarette,393f0j,greekdude1821,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:56:39 2015 UTC,I use 3 strands of 30 gauge twisted in my Subtank RTA all the time. It works really well and it's not difficult to build small with it. Mine come in at about .5 and they are the best coil in a tank I have ever tried. Great flavour and vapour.

Canadian_ecigarette,38z8sy,SteepedMonkeyBrains,3,Mon Jun 8 14:56:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of vapers are people who previously didn't think they could kick their smoking habit, who then had a wonderful experience with a product they didn't know much about previously. A lot of vendors on a daily basis see this experience first hand, and previously experienced it themselves as well.   There's something powerful to be said about what E-Cigarettes can do for people, the potential to save lives or at the very least change lives and this of course has a ripple effect with anyone who's interest is piqued by exposure.   I believe this strongly influences a lot of people to feel like they've received a gift that they can provide to others and to empathize. The product and experience makes for a community of people who feel like they've been a part of a war for a long time, and look out for each other on the battlefield.   Also, Canadian."

There are two boxes:   Mystery Box DashPak   The Mystery Box lets you choose flavor profiles you are fond of, and then we match three juices, which make up  45mL or more based on a super complex algorithm which filters out not only which juices match your profiles, but which juices you've previously purchased from us (so you never get the same juice twice), and how likely that juice is to match your profiles. It's pretty sweet :D.     The DashPak is three juices that we choose every Friday at great savings. For example; this weeks' DashPak includes Bae by Underground, Vazilla by G2 Vapor, and Mystery Flavor by LostArt for $24.99 (retail on those three is $36.xx).  Hope that helps! Let me know if you have questions and I'll be glad to answer them :)"

I THINK it comes with only 3 juices. But he told me it's only ejuice, and it comes once a month. He said the juices will be in random order, but you won't get the same flavour (ex: orange one month, and orange again the next)  Or you could enter their weekly Cloud Chase comp on Monday's and the price is an ejuice of your choice. (unsure if that's the prize all the time)"
Canadian_ecigarette,390mr4,TSmashVapes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:56:43 2015 UTC,Dashbox is different than the mystery box. For the mystery you order it and put in what flavour profiles you'd prefer and nic strength and they choose based on what you choose for your profiles.   The Dashbox is 3 preselected flavors (different every week) at a discounted price.  It shows what flavors they chose that week and you can order. I actually just ordered this weeks box!
Canadian_ecigarette,390mr4,rush68,2,Mon Jun 8 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"Well, my understanding is that there's two options. ""Mystery"" will include a minimum of 3 x 15 ml bottles of high end juice.   Then there's the other one, that I can't remember the name of. Dash box? Lol. That they announce what flavours the package contains. It's weekly? but there's only 100 boxes per week...check the items on their site to make sure I'm not lying lol.   I ordered for fun. Surprise me! I'm tired of looking for juices, profiles, reading descriptions all night. At this point most are starting to taste the same (with the exception of a few) and DIY is still too complicated for me.

The Standard's F.U.E.S @ 30 ML (Been wanting to try this forever) Bombie's Kiss The Ring @ 15 ML Underground's BAE @ 15 ML    Well worth it, and each juice that came was one I really wanted to try. Best part is next time I order I'm sure to get flavours I haven't tried before from them as they look at my prior juice purchases to ensure you don't get the same one twice. Side note to it, the packaging is definitely decent and a classy touch though a bit over-sized for whats included. Can't wait to put in a new wick and try F.U.E.S or BAE first."

First, I would like to tell that I'm very surprised about the quality of the juice even without tasting them all, I already ordered juice that at the moment I smell them I knew it will be gross. I hope I'll be able to buy these juices for a long time. I'll edit my post as I vape different flavor (I'll vape them on my Zephyrus @ 45 watts at 0.6 ohm)  1st flavor : Meow Meow cream. Like the description says, it taste like banana candy, most likely like ""Runts"" candy banana with a little touch of cream. It reminds me TheVaporist Funky Monkey with a little less throat hit (funky monkey is 70/30 pg/vg).  Next flavor I'll try will be Jim Jones, that would be one of my first cereal vape, only other one I have tried is o-rangz by twelve monkeys in my b&m with a dead subtank mini coil 😜 . It tastes awful but behind the burnt hits I have taste something that was too lemony for me. Jim Jones smells very good"

Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,GTAWisSweet,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:06:02 2015 UTC,I'm interested in ordering just because you spell vapours like a Canadian :)  Edit: Do you have a website?
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,obzilla,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:25:49 2015 UTC,No sadly we don't yet. We're literally less than a month old and lack the capital to have one for now. Please PM me if you wish to place an order.
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,GTAWisSweet,0,Wed Jun 10 00:27:11 2015 UTC,I recently bought the entire line-up that these guys are offering and I enjoy all of them. Jim Jones is an excellent cereal e juice and is my favourite alongside Bahamut and Melon Ballah.   The prices are great and they are easy to deal with. I can easily recommend these juices to anyone who wants to save on their e juice costs.
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,obzilla,0,Sun Jun 7 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"Would you say the jim jones is lemon/lime heavy? I'm having a hard time finding a fruit loops vape that gets that right. Also how is it on milkyness? Very milky, or dry cereal?"
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,Lampburglar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:07:06 2015 UTC,I haven't had the opportunity to try too many cereal vapes. I have sampled looper and cereal killa in the stores but never bought any. I've also tried Dr.Fogs fruit loops flavour and I would say Jim Jones is not as lemony as Dr.Fog. As far as milkiness goes its not a strong presence but its there.
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,Lampburglar,0,Sun Jun 7 19:15:22 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,demon1102,0,Sun Jun 7 19:30:57 2015 UTC,What's the cost of shipping to Nova Scotia?
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,demon1102,0,Sun Jun 7 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"We've never shipped to Nova Scotia before, but the cost calculator is telling me $16.91. Canada Post is pure evil. I certainly understand if that is too expensive :/"
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,thatwiztidkid,0,Sun Jun 7 19:12:08 2015 UTC,"It is, however I wouldn't mind so much if I was ordering a sample pack instead of one or two flavors in 30ml. Do you do/plan to do 10 or 15ml samplers?"
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,thatwiztidkid,0,Sun Jun 7 21:06:22 2015 UTC,Quite possibly in the future!
Canadian_ecigarette,38xn98,Power5lide,0,Sun Jun 7 21:38:24 2015 UTC,how much is one bottle?

Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Lampburglar,2,Sun Jun 7 21:04:42 2015 UTC,I buy my Japanese cotton at shoppers. $12 for a lifetime supply. My kanthal I just get from the local B&M.
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Iamjmax,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:17:26 2015 UTC,this. A package of cotton pads could fuel nearly infinite vaping.
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,obzilla,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:20:38 2015 UTC,I bought my pack probably like 5 months ago and I've barely made a dent in one row. Infinite cotton for sure.
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,pancakemixes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, shoppers has some great Japanese cotton. Will last forever."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,icecoldius,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:23:13 2015 UTC,"Mojovapes has the best prices for kanthal that I've seen.  $4.99 for 20 meters, regardless of gauge.  Like others have said, shopper's for the cotton."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,javagnome,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:22:04 2015 UTC,I user rayon instead of cotton and got a 500 foot box of it for 13 bucks from sallys beauty supply. Will last forever.
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Sidelia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Organic cotton can be found at Walmart, Shoppers, etc, for $2-$12 for a big bag.  Kanthal is best bought straight from Temco. About $4-6 for 100m. Otherwise Amazon and ebay, where it's just a bit more, but takes awhile.  DIY supplies can vary depending on the quantities you are ordering. Example: 500mL VG @ $14 or 4L VG @ $40. I think most people's first DIY buy is close to, if not over $100, but you could get by with less if you only want to make a couple recipes. There's a lot of trial and error."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Maelmord,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:24:52 2015 UTC,Temco doesn't ship to Canada I thought.
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Vatigu,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"They do, although I used a US Mailbox to get free shipping, so I don't know how much it costs.  I did have to call their toll-free number since their online site won't accept Canadian payments, but my order was completed within minutes.  I ordered about 300m of various gauges of kanthal last summer for about $20."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Maelmord,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:02:23 2015 UTC,Interesting I'll be looking into this next time I need to order
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Vatigu,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:44:54 2015 UTC,Amazon is pretty quick for stuff like this. I always throw a roll on with every amazon order and one time it came up with Lightning Vapes as the cheapest option.
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,MaddogBC,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:20:09 2015 UTC,I see you've got some NS flair -- a buddy of mine at VapeCity in Moncton gave me these guys' card; hope it helps!
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,deadcell,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:19:30 2015 UTC,"I always get Kanthal from Lightning Vapes. Go with their actual site instead of their eBay: it's cheaper, plus you can use coupon codes (I think there's a permanent 15% off). Shipping to Canada is pretty fast, I never wait more than a week.  As for cotton, I always suggest Swissper's (Walmart in cosmetics, green bag for $2 and has 80 balls) and Shiseido (Shopper's Drug Mart in cosmetics, translucent bale? box? cube? for $12 and 168 pads). You'll find more value in the Shiseido, as it's quite literally years worth of cotton, even if you wick every day. Personally, I prefer the Swissper's."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,setzRFD,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:33:29 2015 UTC,Is it Lightning Vapes that has the ohmsweetohm code for 17% off?
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,vi0lent,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"I don't recall their coupons, I think I've always used something like LV10 or LV15, something in that format. I only order maybe once a year since a 50ft roll of Kanthal lasts me roughly that long."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,setzRFD,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  If you're using swisspers and you're putting your own juice through it than it must be good. I've never used cotton balls, are they difficult to work with? Thanks for chiming in!"
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,setzRFD,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:44:53 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of good or not good, both are great! I personally prefer Shiseido in my tanks, because wickability is an absolute priority. Shiseido is grained and makes juice transport easier. It's just easier to wick with cotton balls, so I go with Swissper's in my drippers. I only use drippers, so Shiseido doesn't get used much."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,Awesummzzz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:28:25 2015 UTC,"My start up for DIY is gonna pull $200+ from my wallet. And I'm still looking at flavors and bottles etc.  Look at Hydavapes and EastCoastVape for nicotine, Hydavapes is a little controversial but a lot of people swear by them, as EastCoastVape is tried and true. Both companies are Canadian, I believe.  http://www.diy-ejuice.com/ is where I'm gonna get my flavours from, DIY veterans suggest TFA/TPA, Capella's and Flavor Art generally. Plus these guys are based out of Canada too.  You can get more info over at /r/DIY_eJuice but they're generally Americans over there so their stores are a little harder for us to order from with conversion,  shipping etc."
Canadian_ecigarette,38y5lv,konkatenate,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:24:14 2015 UTC,"Muji, which is a new store in downtown Toronto has Ecru organic Japanese cotton. I think it was ~ $4 CAD. for 140 pads. The store price is higher than the online price [exchange?], but it cost less than shoppers, and imho, nicer."

Other than that, there's not much outside of the city and online is probably easier.  If you want cheap online and don't mind non-canadian vendors I'd suggest checking out Illumn.com. That's where some shops order from. The 25r's are on sale for $5/each right now."
Canadian_ecigarette,38wmo5,Adolph_Bernanke,2,Sun Jun 7 14:12:58 2015 UTC,Yes Illumn is cheaper than anywhere I have found even with exchange and shipping.

Evaperated will make just about any level and ratio if you email and ask for it.  Mlv is pretty  pricing if I recall. I only buy my juice from vape meet.  Charlie does wonders. 15/30 ml will get you to 18 roughly  with tax. They sell 140ml once a month for about $50~. I haven't tried a lot of stuff in Canada,  mostly in gta region."

You will have a very hard time finding any of the ""highly revered"" juices on the cheap. Dashvapes & Dragon Vapes sell some of the big name American Juices, but  they are not cheap. They go from $22.00 to $30.00 + for a 30ml bottle.   I have bought some of the big name American juices at ridiculously high prices and was not really impressed. The Juice was good, but not any better than some of the Canadian Juice I by for $16.00 for 30ml from vapemeet.ca"

Evaperated is my Canadian favorite. Amazing juice at great prices, the 'choose your own sample packs' are affordable in small volume and a great way to get to know the juice. DSV is on my list to try, but prices get really good at 120 or 250 ml. Jugheads, a bit of a crazy guy with a crazy site, but some great juice, and really great prices. Unfortunately you can only order 'occasionally' (once or twice a month) as he is only open when he is open. You have to watch his site for when he is going to put the site online."

This is an issue that the vaping community is whining about. I would hope that kanger has made it so their tank that comes with the kit fits perfectly.

Canadian_ecigarette,38rb6w,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:37:43 2015 UTC,Your subtank can be an RTA (rebuildable tank atomizer). Sub tanks are great and i do use them (such as my mini) on occasion.  But ill never get the satisfaction that i get from a good dripper or RDA (rebuildable dripping atomizer). The vape and flavour from a dual coil build to me is top notch.
Canadian_ecigarette,38rb6w,D3adkl0wn,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:21:44 2015 UTC,I rebuild only. I started with my mini protanks and I'll be doing the same with this subtank. I have a mild complaint with the subtank that the flavours just don't seem to be as good as with a mini protank for some reason. I'm wondering if a dripper would suit me better.
Canadian_ecigarette,38rb6w,obzilla,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:39:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for writing your initial thoughts on the device!   Personally I'm quite disappointed that they began to use a vertical coil thing with the subtank, I hate vertical coils.. but that's personal preference.   I assume the older OCC coils still fit?   The box looks great though, I'm looking forward to getting a white one as soon as I can possibly justify it to my wallet lol"

Canadian_ecigarette,38q54f,Maelmord,2,Fri Jun 5 22:40:44 2015 UTC,If you're just starting... was that a kit?  I don't see any PG/vg base or nicotine or anything... not sure how this stuff works.  I want to eventually get into it but I got a lotta juice already... but wanna get set up somewhat before it runs out and before taxes or something hit.  It'd be nice to know wtf I need without spending a week researching... though I have already spent hours and have a general idea what's involved.
Canadian_ecigarette,38q54f,Silverlight42,2,Fri Jun 5 23:28:52 2015 UTC,Those are the flavours that are added to the pg/vg/nic.  /r/DIY_eJuice is the best resource but you should read all the stuff they have first before asking questions. Chances are your answers are in the info there somewhere.
Canadian_ecigarette,38q54f,beekermc,2,Fri Jun 5 23:35:03 2015 UTC,yeah that's what I was remarking on...  where's the rest of the stuff if he plans on making his own juice?
Canadian_ecigarette,38q54f,Silverlight42,2,Fri Jun 5 23:37:43 2015 UTC,They made 4 orders from 4 different places. Chances are they wanted to get different things from different places. Sometimes you can save on nic at one place and pg/vg at another for instance. It's best to shop around when DIYing.
Canadian_ecigarette,38q54f,beekermc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:41:18 2015 UTC,"ah is it? even with shipping?  for me, sometimes it's just way more convenient, plus extra shipping costs just don't make it worth it to save $5."

Customer service to me usually only factors in if there's a problem... and i'd rather there not be a problem... yknow.  I just wanna order stuff and have it get here sometime.... as long as it isn't too long.   as for quality yeah for sure... but hard to tell that with stuff like just a raw flavouring."

Canadian_ecigarette,38qp60,br4d24,2,Sat Jun 6 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"Like already mentioned, it's made in Canada so that adds a lot of cost right there - also it's made from 316 grade stainless steel which I believe is better than what most rdas are made from (304?)  Also it seems to have peek everywhere, places that most rdas use Delrin this has peek. Seems like it's made specifically to withstand super hot builds from the way they are marketing it."

Mine spins and has what seems to be like rust forming on the sides. also the insulator melted with a 2mm dual Clapton build.  loved this little thing while it lasted a couple months though.  check if the center post is properly in position and try screwing the 510 pin in tighter.

My only complaint is the screen is a little small, but that doesn't bother me. It does have a slight button rattle but again, doesn't bother me. Just like the MVPs the build quaility feels amazing."
Canadian_ecigarette,38nckw,icecoldius,2,Fri Jun 5 09:35:37 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for the review. I've heard of some issues with the TC of the snowolf and that has been my only hesitation on this device. I would likely never go over 100-120 watts so the pulse won't be a problem. I still have some time to decide so having input like this really helps. Thanks /u/icecoldius!!!
Canadian_ecigarette,38nckw,majorvapes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:40:09 2015 UTC,"No worries man! I'm glad I could help. I have to say though, I wouldn't get this mod solely for TC.  It's a great all in one box with high wattage and TC. If you can wait, I'd wait for the IPV3 LI. I love my ipv3 box design, so I'll probably pick up the LI too, when it becomes available."
Canadian_ecigarette,38nckw,majorvapes,2,Fri Jun 5 18:31:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip. I grabbed an ipv4 strictly to play with tc to see if i'd like it. Planning on a second device next month for my bday so still weighing my options. Was a little dissapointed to hear the tc wasn't that great on it. Convicted vapes gave it a thumbs down on tc too. Will definitely take a look at the Li when it drops. Thanks dude!
Canadian_ecigarette,38nckw,damchini,2,Fri Jun 5 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"Looks like a solid mod, but the reivews I've seen also advise of poor(er) battery life.    Missed out on the Gearbest deal ($95 USD), but I'll probably wait for the Whiteout."
Canadian_ecigarette,38nckw,obzilla,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:26:33 2015 UTC,"The battery lasts me around a day and a half to two days. I'm a pretty heavy chain vaper (when I have the time for it anyways).

Canadian_ecigarette,38nckw,obzilla,2,Fri Jun 5 18:20:55 2015 UTC,"I'm jelly! Mine are in the mail, hopefully Monday.  I saw about the temp control in the Convicted Vapes review, but I fully intend to use mine on kanthal builds, and in the 100 and lower wattage range. I have never been able to get myself to buy a sigeli or ipv because the ones I've held have felt like cheap crap. So I've been getting by with hammond box mods (hexohm, truck 120,etc) and they have suited me fine. Problem is no battery info minus the truck 120 which is my go to... Also I'm gravitating to .15 ish builds which works on my mods, but it's technically out of their range and is a no no for long term use. Snow wolf being the same size with a better chip and proper screen info and the ability to build lower seems like a no brainier to me.  Would you say it's about the same size/weight/density as a hex ohm? Are the bottoms solid and clicky, or do they have a hollow plastic feel? I went a little nuts and bought... More than one, sight unseen, so I'm really hoping I didn't sign up for a plastic crap box.  Thanks for the impressions, dude!"
Canadian_ecigarette,38nckw,AceVaper,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"I can't compare it to a hexohm because I've never used or held one before. Buttons feel nice and clicky, they don't feel cheap. I wish the power button was bigger, I've found myself hitting the up/down button when I wanted to fire the mod. You will not be disappointed about the build quality, that's for sure."

Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,SlovenianSocket,11,Fri Jun 5 02:16:45 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who would rather see a minor vape than smoke? Even back when I was a minor it was really easy to get smokes. I mean I know the media and reddit views but still. Edit: unless this is only the case in NL? And I know I'm asking for a lynching saying this.
Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,Sliparoon,7,Fri Jun 5 11:11:59 2015 UTC,"You are definately not alone.  Of course it'd be better if they didn't o either, but everyone who is so against it comes off as selfish about the ""image"" of vaping that they'd prefer kids smoke than vape...  Anything to get ANYONE off smoking is my opinion. Anything to STOP someone from picking up the habit."
Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,AnarchoElk,3,Fri Jun 5 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'm only 18 and I started vaping a month ago. I know a lot of you may not like this but I started vaping to quit smoking cigarettes and since i started vaping i haven't touched a cigarette or even had a craving for one. As much as i wish the legal age was 18, i still agree that shops should ID and not sell to minors. Its not something kids should be getting into considering all the precautions one should take when it comes to rebuilding and mech mods and such. The last thing this community needs the heat because of 14 year old blowing their hand off."
Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,MrAlsador,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:43:35 2015 UTC,the idea is that we don't want to condone minors to engage in any activity that could normalize inhaling anything but air. imo it makes sense and vaping should be 18+
Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,quazy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:57:01 2015 UTC,"I agree vaping should be something adults do. But kids are idiots, and want to be as ""adult"" as they can whenever they can get away with it because it makes them feel cool and mature.  I'd rather they be idiots vaping than idiots smoking. Saying letting kids vape is condoning it is the same argument that teaching kids about safe sex is condoning kids having sex at a young age. It's not, it's just trying to keep them as safe as possible knowing that kids are dumb.  MrAlsador has a point with battery safety. Blowing up a battery is a bit more of an immediate concern than a lifetime of a shit habit that slowly kills your body until you die prematurely from avoidable diseases.  I'd still prefer kids vape to smoke though, if they have to do one or the other."

Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,antaios256,2,Fri Jun 5 15:58:36 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I do not agree with it being a general rule that those under the age of majority be allowed to purchase freely.

Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,zolofftt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:41:44 2015 UTC,"Update: I joined the group, it looks like a lot of people won't sell to minors on there.   There are a lot of kids in the group. I'd say the majority are, based on their behaviour and language.   I want laws in place because of shit like this. If they're selling to minors, it should be the same applicable crack down as it is for alcohol or cigarettes."

Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:36:56 2015 UTC,I think my opinion on the topic is pretty clear. Still waiting to hear your alternate solution.
Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,cursed_be_iron,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Your initial solution was and still is terrible. You're basing a list of potential B&Ms that serve underage off of the word of a very untrustworthy source. Even if you test this method, it's too late as everyone is on the lookout.  Why the hell is everyone in BCV so hung up on this and taking what this little shit says as fact? And what are you guys going to do when/if a shop you admire is listed as serving minors? Defend them, that's what. Everyone is so frenzied based on what these kids are doing that they're making total asses out of themselves and causing more harm than good. You'll downvote me and disagree, but that doesn't change the facts. Ya'll are acting like the children you're attacking."
Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not downvoting anything, friend.  For a little clarification, I live in Ontario. I have no stake in your corner of the vapeworld. I am not so dedicated to any retailer that I would defend them if they were demonstrated to have participated in practices that would damage the reputation of vaping.   To offer you some perspective, we've just had legislation sail through our provincial parliament that effectively treats vape products and vendors the same as tobacco. I am all for age restrictions, but I think we all know kids aren't stupid and they're gonna get their hands on whatever they set their mind to obtaining. That's obvious. What we don't need, what BC doesn't need, what ON doesn't need, what VAPING doesn't need, is vendors taking advantage of the regulatory vacuum. When they come to regulate and have irrefutable proof that vendors are in fact marketing and selling to minors, well...watch what happens.   If the industry and the community doesn't patrol itself, we're leaving it in the hands of those who don't respect, understand and/or need vaping."
Canadian_ecigarette,38lzyy,cursed_be_iron,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"Judging by your response you don't have anywhere near a clear understanding of what is actually going on. This is merely a setup. To put things into perspective -- The group OP linked, in retaliation, is making an effort to slander local B&Ms making numerous false claims. This was expected and why the boat shouldn't have been rocked in this manner. It goes far, far deeper than that though. Perhaps you should do a little research into the matter before commenting."

I never really got a vanilla flavour from it myself. To me it's more like a caramel custard with notes of real banana through it. From what I gather though it's a love it or hate it. I love it but when a friend tried it he hated it. Pulling my last half bottle of it out now!!
Canadian_ecigarette,38lze6,majorvapes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"Hola!  Custard accent has some vanilla custard and vanillin in it, but not in huge quantities. The banana overtakes it for sure, hence the accent :P  Hidden Dragon: Let it steep. As it ages the Dragonfruit comes out. Bit by bit, you will taste it more and more. If you like Dragonfruit, you will be very pleased. Put it aside for a week. The juices are fresh :)  Tree Of life: I've been vaping it for the past 2 months through its iterations...I just adore it. As it ages the Apricot blends in more with the rest and the mix becomes more balanced. For me personally I prefer it fresh as the apricot flavor really outshines the others.   Phil"

Is it just supposed to be a fruityish flavor?    I definitely pick up dragon fruit flavour when I vape it.  But I've also eaten a lot of actual dragon fruit.  Friend of mine who's never had dragon fruit mentioned ""It kinda tastes like watermelon..."" and ever since then I could taste a combination of both.  (It's also helpful that Palm Bay came out with a dragon fruit watermelon vodka cooler this month too. haha.)  So... do you think you might be getting a watermelon kinda taste?   Tree Of Life:Apricot..holy hell this is one damn good bottle of liquid..I killed the sampler in a few hours, it was so good!

Canadian_ecigarette,38m94q,beerawk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:55:52 2015 UTC,I have a dark horse clone that is around $30. The only real negative I can find is the shallow juice well. Big post holes and somewhat easy to build on (single or dual) and the absurd amount of airflow options make it very adjustable to what you like. The plume veil is another good one. A word of warning: most rdas are made with straight lung pulls and can get a little hot doing mouth to lung. The magma is an amazing mouth to lung rda but it's more for flavor than clouds due to the restrictive airflow.
Canadian_ecigarette,38m94q,beerawk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:05:06 2015 UTC,Is this the right kanthal? http://www.temcoindustrialpower.com/products/Resistance_Wire/RW0157.html - Also do you know where I could get the 18650 battery and charger for a good price?
Canadian_ecigarette,38m94q,zolofftt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:48:04 2015 UTC,Yeah that should be the right wire. My charger and batteries I got in a store. I stick to samsung 20r or 25r. They're fairly cheap so I have 2 sets of 2 for my sigelei. I use a nitecore i4 I got at the same place as well.

You can get Bacon Cotton but it's kind of expensive. (either $8 or $11 I think)  A huge bag of organic cotton is like $2-4. Walmart carries it. Fasttech carries cotton but I wouldn't bother buying it.  Fasttech also carries Kanthal, you can pick up a 10 meter spool of it for around $3 depending on gauge.   Personally, I'd pick up a Subtank mini from FT and order the Kanthal from them as well. Probably 24 or 26 gauge."

It'll be near unpoliceable to run around and tell people they can't vape on this or that trail or within so many feet of something...
Canadian_ecigarette,38kero,drkstrm1976,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:03:41 2015 UTC,There are many places that people should not vape but do vape so therefore laws are needed to stop people from doing it in such places.

I got mine at a B&M but if you're up for ordering online they can be found for around $70 in Canada. For a few more $ on Fasttech you can upgrade the shipping and get it much much quicker. A charger is not an absolute requirement for a Subox kit as it has a USB charger.   Sorry about your MVP.

Canadian_ecigarette,38kfxm,WhiteRussian13,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:42:01 2015 UTC,yeah I really like that option. Keep in mind the 2 amp mode is only for the larger batteries. .5 amp takes about 5 hours to charge my vtc4's and 1 amp is roughly 2 hours. 1 amp will reduce your overall battery life if you charge it at that rate all the time but its saved my ass a few times when I have forgotten to charge batteries before a night out.

Canadian_ecigarette,38l7td,icecoldius,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:50:59 2015 UTC,I think it's just the best working 60w temp control right now. At least until there's more testing with all the new mods coming out

My suggestion of the magma was primarily around the single coil ease of setup. Looking at what jg has in stock I might suggest the Manta be the next closest thing. Dual post for easy single coil setup, top airflow and reasonably small chamber so flavour should be good."

Canadian_ecigarette,38k40l,V8per,2,Thu Jun 4 20:15:50 2015 UTC,I can recommend the Marquis RDA from JGVapes. I own one and it is a great MTL.  Wonderful flavor.It is a very well built clone. Easy to build. I use mine with a single .7 to .8 ohm coil or a dual .3 ohm. The price is good and you can not beat JGVapes for service.
Canadian_ecigarette,38k40l,anxdiety,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:17:37 2015 UTC,Most definitely the Marquis.
Canadian_ecigarette,38k40l,RobocopSuperfan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"I got an N22 from JG, it's similiar to the magma in that it has under-the-coil airflow, but 2mm post holes on a three post deck.

Canadian_ecigarette,38h3zo,Thaxxas,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:18:58 2015 UTC,Depends a lot on your juice but I've personally only had a problem with it sticking to windows when it's cold. It causes some problems when driving in the dark since headlights get a halo around them and can make it very hard to see.

Canadian_ecigarette,38izut,Lampburglar,8,Thu Jun 4 15:16:59 2015 UTC,"Some giveaways try to do that, a typical rule is only accounts that are at least a month old and have comment history. Others say no giveaway only accounts.  However some argue that it isn't fair to new members and it's hard to police. New members not having much to comment on as they are lurking and building knowledge.   My issue lately has been the downvoting of everything. I see the most innocent comments or posts getting downvoted for seemingly nothing. I also notice a lopsided number of upvotes for certain users/vendors while others hardly get any for doing a nice giveaway or trying to contribute to the community. I know certain vendors have their fans but it's pretty obvious what some of those fans are doing. Makes me sad as I upvote tons and only downvote when someone is being a jerk or putting out bad info. I find people are much nicer and more likely to upvote in the main ECR or other subs which to me is nuts. I thought us Canadians were nicer than that. I know I learned the hard way myself when I was still new to this sub and have been very careful about what I say or post in here since then, which kind of defeats the purpose of an open forum."
Canadian_ecigarette,38izut,majorvapes,3,Thu Jun 4 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"I really agree with everything you said, especially about the new members.

Canadian_ecigarette,38izut,majorvapes,3,Thu Jun 4 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"Strange, I find the reverse. Every post I see here gets upvotes, it's seldom I see anything below 80%. Contrastingly, virtually every post on ECR gets downvoted to hell, but sometimes you can break through, so much so there's a couple threads a month of people asking why everyone downvotes everyone for no reason on ECR.  I think for vendor posts it's different for this sub, though. Almost every time I make a thread, it's downvoted to 0 but sometimes creeps up. I don't know why my Tweaker review was standing at 20% a couple hours after I posted it, but it's gone back up. Lots of times I see vendor posts having every comment downvoted too, it's weird."
Canadian_ecigarette,38izut,setzRFD,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the time it might be specific to certain users. I always considered you one of the popular vendors on here and your posts/comments usually get decent votes. I was surprised too on your review of tweaker that it didn't get more(you had mine). I know myself I rubbed some people the wrong way a while back so I'm not totally surprised that I get downvotes in here but almost anything I post outside of cecr gets decent votes. I'm sure some of it has to do with number of subscribers but still I would like to see a little more love around here, not for me for everyone!  I was just looking at the three recent giveaway posts, the one I did for Vaporus, the one Vaporus did and the one you did. Mine had the least votes and least comments and I saw it go up and down quite a bit. Vaporus' has the most comments and is in the middle for votes while yours has less comments than Vaporus but much more votes than either of the other two. Is it because of popularity or preference? I personally don't know but I just wanted to share my thoughts on it."
Canadian_ecigarette,38izut,majorvapes,2,Thu Jun 4 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe it varies on person. I've had friends tell me a post has +2 when I only see +1, even after refreshing.

Canadian_ecigarette,38izut,rush68,0,Thu Jun 4 16:41:53 2015 UTC,I don't think it's about shrinking the pool more like encouraging participation.
Canadian_ecigarette,38izut,majorvapes,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture) most websites don't work that way, while reddit's stats aren't available it's safe to say the rule follows.    the 90/9/1 rule, we mean the hypothesis that 90% of Reddit users simply read, 9% upvote/downvote, and 1% actually comment. This is slightly different from the rule as it relates to other online communities (where the 9% refers to commenting, and the 1% to creation). Posting new threads/creating subreddits themselves is likely a significantly smaller proportion of Reddit's userbase, one that might be harder to estimate.]   Basically drawing out the 90% of people who just lurk is quite rare, smaller subreddits like this usually already get slightly higher participation because it's a narrowed interest. Contests are a great way to start their participation. Threads like this are just negative to the majority of readers in my opinion."

Canadian_ecigarette,38ehge,rocksteadymachine,2,Wed Jun 3 18:03:19 2015 UTC,"I have an SX Mini and an IPV4.  Lots of temp limiting experimentation going on.  I enjoy the Lemo 2, but had an issue with liquid leaking into the air hole and onto the contact where the tank screws into the airflow base.  That lead to some widely fluctuating resistances and some super dry hits.  The Subtank mini is also working well with nickel, but I need to mod the RBA had to increase juice flow.  Never a dry hit, but the vapor production is not up to snuff. My Tobeco Kayfun 4 performs as you would expect.  I've also had success with an Infinite Plume Veil clone and an authentic Youde Hunter dripper.  Next I'll probably try to build a dual coil in the Goliath or the Goblin.  I've got my eye on the single coil capability of the Goliath 2."
Canadian_ecigarette,38ehge,tommytw0time,2,Wed Jun 3 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"You should take a look at the derringer rda. I got a clone from eastcoastvape for 16.99, and I've put aside all of the tanks i own since then."
Canadian_ecigarette,38ehge,Raztrop,2,Wed Jun 3 22:25:07 2015 UTC,"Taifun GT2 is a pure flavour tank so it's more restrictive compared to the airy tanks.  If you want good flavour to air ratio with a single coil than go with the Youde Goliath, even though it's a dual coil deck, the proper wicking will allow single coil.  Or you can go with a Gus Estia, more pricey (140 euros) but you can work up to 3 coils in it.  As for a dripper,  Atmomixani Anima or Striker   or the Hazematic Revolt"

The Goblin is even smaller. I just keep telling myself it'll be worth it, which it always is!  But it's not the most fun to wick, just the really small space is hard to work with, but I really try to jam in whatever cotton I can! Pro tip, use tweezers."

Canadian_ecigarette,38ehge,majorvapes,2,Fri Jun 5 02:19:57 2015 UTC,"I bought a second Lemo 2. The Drop was an awesome tank for my first RTA but the 2 is much better.

Canadian_ecigarette,38ehge,dennistein,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:31:36 2015 UTC,"For the taifun? I do a basic 8-9 wrap 28g spaced coil on a 2mm bit. I put enough cotton in it to fill the coil and I cut it just outside the chamber base. What I do is I wrap 8 or 9 loose wraps on screwdriver, then I push the whole thing up against the base of the driver to compress it and it springs out to a perfect spaced coil. Comes out around 0.14ish depending on how tight you make it. If you mean the magma it's pretty much the same build. On my way to work or I would post a pic."

Canadian_ecigarette,38dbtc,Chris1077,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:21:14 2015 UTC,"SonwWolf200w   Well looks like I waited too long for that price. The coupon code no longer works. I did find a couple though on Amazon of all places, for $175CDN each, that were in stock so I went for it. There will probably be a better price out there somewhere, but, impatience is expensive :) Shipping was free, so that's nice. I reckon they'll be here Monday or Tuesday.  EDIT: Web page is confusing, you have to select the item to which to apply the coupon. So it does work. I canceled one of my fully priced SnowWolfs (SnowWolves?) on Amazon, but kept one and placed an order for one on GearBest.... so, now it's just a race to see who comes through first."

Sometimes this can come off as lazy, or uninterested.   They'll ease in to helping you, as to not be overbearing, and they'll never push a product on you that isn't something they whole heartedly recommend.  I can see why you thought they laid back, that's how our atmosphere is meant to be :)  I'm super glad you are enjoying your selections, and am glad you would shop with us again!  <3"

They have a good selection of US juices at a fair price.  Most other vendors put insane markups on US juices and local B&M prices are laughable for the most part.   Funny enough I just ordered a 180mL of Muffin Man from them that came in today.  Does yours have an aroma of alcohol to it?

Canadian_ecigarette,38agh2,greekdude1821,3,Wed Jun 3 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"I recently dealt with an issue with my customer's iStick and man, what a procedure, really kind of turned me off of their products. Here's the rundown:  -the iStick began autofiring with his Goblin atomizer attached. He managed to turn it off. Then it would turn on by itself and keep firing. He removed the atomizer and brought it back to me.  -contacted my distributor, who said due to cosmetic wear and tear, there is nothing that they would be able to do. I told them of the numerous issues, and posted a number of reddit posts describing this issue to raise awareness to the fact. Still decided to overlook the technical aspect and said will only accept a DOA  -finally decided to contact eLeaf directly. They gave me the runaround, telling me to go back to the distributor. I told them I already did and that I wanted them to step up and acknowledge the issue with their product. I linked a number of reddit threads to again bring it to their attention. They finally decided to do something, but had to go through eLeaf US for the exchange.  -I get the iStick in last week, and he was very happy to have his iStick back, but now it cuts off when he presses the fire button before the 10 sec cuttoff. He's saying he's see what comes down in the pipeline for new mods and we'll discuss his options from there. But it's just insane. I really hope they step up the QC."
Canadian_ecigarette,38agh2,VapeEscapeMTL,2,Wed Jun 3 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"This is why I stopped buying joyetech/eleaf products. They don't want to take responsibility for creating a faulty product. Even on their home page they try to blame ""counterfeits"" for the problems they're having:   In recent months, many eLeaf iStick counterfeits have appeared on the market. We have analyzed these and believe them to be of poor quality and unsafe. It has constituted a serious infringement on our legal rights as well as the legitimate interests of our customers. Moreover, it casts adverse impact on the eLeaf brand image and reputation. Accordingly, we have taken legal measures against counterfeits, and have also taken some possible methods to control the extension of the infringement acts.

You probably know all the features already so I'll offer some caveats. The paint on the body is a nightmare. Mine is covered in scratches from daily use. It needs a skin and they have not been released. YiHi claims only the black models are affected but I have a grey model. Changing the battery is a huge pain at first but it does get better. The battery cap wears in and it gets easier to use.  Anything specific you want to know about it??  If I lost it, I would buy another in a heartbeat."

I have the iPV4 which is a solid device for the money and very similar with the sx330 chip. Was thinking about getting a m class for my bday next month but there are so many TC options coming out now that the m class seems a bit limited. It's single 18650 and only 60w unless you use the extension tube. Price might also be an issue as you can get dual 18650 and double or higher watts at half the price. Here's just what GB has atm for temp control http://www.gearbest.com/electronic-cigarettes-c_11281/fdf12_temperature~control~mod/.

You're comparing apples and oranges here. Show me a device as well built and performs as well as the m-class that's dual 18650 and half the price. You can't be comparing devices based on wattage. It's also 85W with passthrough. Extension tube isn't the only option for higher wattage.
Canadian_ecigarette,388lsf,cursed_be_iron,2,Tue Jun 2 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"It'll actually do much higher than 80w in bypass mode. 85w is listed as the 'official' limit, but it will still let you fire down to 0.1ohms with an amp limit of 40A.

Canadian_ecigarette,385e5n,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"I stole this right out of the email Mark sent me to explain the Cthulhu.   It was a challenge to get this built right only because it was brand new to me,the concept of dual coils that is. I got a build on it and after a day of using it,its crazy how much flavor this thing puts out and the vapor is huge. I would highly recommend this to anyone.  (The Cthulhu is a dual-coil deck rebuildable tank atomizer, whereas the Lemo and Lemo 2 are single coil. The big thing that sets it apart from all of the competition is that the wicking channels are humongous, 2.5mm diameter, four channels. So if built right, you simply don’t get dry hits. And the airflow is great, as well as it being dual-coil you end up getting crazy good flavour since it’s always so saturated in liquid.)"

Canadian_ecigarette,384zxd,icecoldius,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:33:02 2015 UTC,"Flavour is the same. And I highly doubt youll be able to melt the acrylic. Acrylic has a melting point of 200f but the closest point to the coil on the cap is the chimney that reaches into the top of the coil head, and doesn't touch the coil. So in order for the acrylic to melt your coil body would have to reach 200f consistently and the coil body is cooled by airflow and is encased in liquid. If you melt the cap theres something wrong with your device essentially lol."

Canadian_ecigarette,383t2v,Catmandingo,2,Mon Jun 1 21:44:39 2015 UTC,But seriously don't most vape shop samples already have 0mg? And why has no one weighed in on this?

If you want to sample you will be asked to hand over your identification , then you can freely go outdoors to test and redeem your identification whenever you are done testing.

Canadian_ecigarette,383t2v,bongafied,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:55:49 2015 UTC,It was quite clear in defining the ban applies to Tobacco products.  I don't think 0mg qualifies under that legislation.

What I do think will happen is the need for smaller sample bottles.  Most stores only sell 30ml bottles and a few have 10ml bottles.  A 5 ml sample might be in order.  That or people will just ""step outside"" to sample stuff.  I like the patio idea, that's cool."

Canadian_ecigarette,383t2v,golden_rhino,0,Mon Jun 8 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely not, a small pain but nothing major, you just can't vape it in the shop it's not to say you can't step outside after having a little put in your tank, or dripper, and in some cases many people do not sample juices before hand.   I think the shops are still in good condition and the regulations are not to bad."

I asked where the heck is this ceramic cup and why do none of our IMPs have it?!?!  Their response was that after lots of the vape shows they went to, customer feedback was that the ceramic insert was reducing the juice capacity of the well, so they decided to simply remove it, but left it in the booklet.  Can't comment on the burning of the insulator or not, but from Youde's response, the ceramic part is not there by design.  Hope that helps  Cheers"
Canadian_ecigarette,386axr,dashvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:31:38 2015 UTC,I jumped to a conclusion without being informed. ps. I was the customer who brought up the ceramic cup not being included. Should have just gone with the Aromamizer and probably been a happier customer. I'll see if I can trade it with someone who is into cloud chasing. Too much airflow for me.

Canadian_ecigarette,385o1h,Fine-Day,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"All atomizers will get hot. Some quicker than other and they all depend on how high you're running it, air flow and the attys heat dissipation abilities. Are you mouth to lung hitting by any chance?  Edit: also for the throat hit what are you using for juice and nic level."
Canadian_ecigarette,385o1h,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"I was just vaping it straight to lung, then I put on a different drip tip and mouth to lunged it. I'm vaping cola gummy by cosmic fog 6mg which I think is 50/50. it doesn't say the pg/vg ratio on the bottle."
Canadian_ecigarette,385o1h,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:23:33 2015 UTC,"50/50 and 6mg in a powerful subohm tank like that might be too much and will give quite a throat hit. Try a higher vg and lower nic like 3mg or lower, that's my pref. Also like the other guy says if it's only getting hot once in a while it could be a possible short. Try replacing the coil if taking it apart and putting it back together doesn't help."

Try disassembling everything (and remove and reinstall the coil), it almost sounds like its shorting out on itself, 15w is way to low for that to happen."
Canadian_ecigarette,385o1h,Chris1077,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:50:16 2015 UTC,well alrighty I will try this later and report back. thanks for the advice!
Canadian_ecigarette,385o1h,dienah13,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:37:25 2015 UTC,"The Freemax Starre (Maganus) does tend to get very hot.  I think they used some cheap SS or something because once you start vaping it at 60W+ (I usually vape around 70) the tank gets very hot after chain vaping. especially hot days in the car it gets really hot to the touch if you take like 4-5 big vapes one after the other.  love the throat hit though, this thing produces massive vapor on the OCC coils."
Canadian_ecigarette,385jkc,Lampburglar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:26:24 2015 UTC,The lower you build it the more power it uses so it will drain your battery quicker. You have to find a balance. Adding more wraps will increase you resistance using less power but also increases the mass of the coil affecting the ramp up time. What gauge wire are you working with?
Canadian_ecigarette,385jkc,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:46:14 2015 UTC,26G which I believe is the problem. Anything past 10-11 wraps seems to be a bit too long. I was thinking I need to get some 30G. I'd like to be somewhere around .7 - .9
Canadian_ecigarette,385jkc,majorvapes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"30g is getting real thin and becomes a bit of a pain to work with. Grab some 28g and try building around 1ohm. Use steamengine to figure out how many wraps and what size, I can't remember off hand as I tend to build much lower, but I have more watts available."
Canadian_ecigarette,385jkc,sansaset,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:02:54 2015 UTC,try to aim for like a .8 build if you can.  find a resistance calculator for kanthal to figure out what guage/wraps you'll need.
Canadian_ecigarette,385jkc,dienah13,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"I find anything under .8 or .7 kills the battery real quick.   And for the juice consumption, I don't know much about the Cthulhu but I know it's compared to the Goblin a lot. I think awesome flavour and juice consumption go hand in hand. Always worth."
Canadian_ecigarette,383z3f,JynxedKarma,2,Mon Jun 1 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in something like an IPV4 you should look into a tank that also has temperature control options. The subtank mini has a temperature control coil head you can purchase. It also has an RBA base that you could do your own builds on. Otherwise, there are a lot of great tanks that you could use with the IPV4. I currently have a subtank mini and i think it's awesome. You could also look into the Delta II, the Atlantis II, the Arctic or the Herakles. If you're interested in a tank with just a rebuildable section, i've heard good things about the Lemo 2. Whatever you decide on, make sure you do a bit of research and you should be able to find a great tank no problem!"
Canadian_ecigarette,383z3f,gotlieb1993,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:44:55 2015 UTC,IPV4 is a huge jump from a Kanger Evod lol. Lots of power. Probably lots of power you wouldn't use at first.  I suggest looking into the Kanger Subox 50w instead. Vapor North has a pre-order + 1x Free 15ml juiice as well. All you need is to purchase 1-2 18650 battery and you are ready to go. It includes premade coil cartridges and a rebuildable deck with the Subtank Mini tank.  You say you want to upgrade. What do you want to upgrade? Do you want experience and have more flavour and/or more vapor? What resistance/wattage/volts are you using to vaping now? Do you want to get into subohming? or stay above 1.00 ohms?

The tobacco I use is very light, and is a sweeter, almost rose-like tobacco. Vaping just the tobacco flavorant on its own reminds me of freshly cut grass and rose. You can see some reviews on the page above, many comment it's very far from a traditional tobacco taste but still has a little bit of that bitterness that complements the rest well.  As for other vendors' tobaccos I like: Boba's Bounty is a given, but I haven't had it in like 2 yrs. Jugheads Jokesmoke is also good."

Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,setzRFD,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"Can you describe Jokesmoke a bit? People descirbe it very differently, some say it has no flavour at all, others say light tobacco, others are saying cotton candy? Sounds like it's a lot of people's ADV, but I don't want something too sweet."
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,setzRFD,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say it contains zero tobacco. To me, it's a full blast of cotton candy: so much so it's a touch bitter and resembles tobacco.  It's not my ADV personally, it's way too sharp to be a daily driver. Nevertheless, it's quite good."
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,majorvapes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"So confusing lol, I don't see how cotton candy and tobacco can be similar at all."
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,majorvapes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:26:45 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have a tobacco ""taste"", but it has a tobacco ""feel"" if that makes sense. Tobacco is bitter, cotton candy is sweet. Too much of a sweet thing can be bitter."
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,Lampburglar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to order some from Mojovapes, thanks for the help!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,sansaset,2,Mon Jun 1 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"I just did a review on Wrath from Vaporus, it's a pretty grown up taste. Not sweet, tastes like a dry tobacco and on the exhale I get a lovely green tea flavour. Not sure if that is something that would appeal to you but I've been enjoying it."
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,RobertDF902,2,Mon Jun 1 15:30:57 2015 UTC,"That sounds really good actually, thanks!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,sansaset,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:41:19 2015 UTC,np!
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,ihatethinking96,2,Mon Jun 1 15:50:27 2015 UTC,Not really cigarette tobacco but /u/vapornorth makes a hell of a cigar/bourbon called Bandits Breath. I honestly didn't think I'd like it but instantly loved it. I killed the 5ml sampler in like an hour.
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,ihatethinking96,2,Tue Jun 2 01:39:32 2015 UTC,it's pricy but the best tobacco juice I've ever bought is Boba's Bounty.
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,winfinite,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"I wish I still liked it, the last time I ordered it I got a 100ml bottle direct from alien visions. Got about half way through it before it lost it's allure. That juice single handedly got me off cigarettes."
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,CuBu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah it really kicks ass, too bad it lost its magnificence half way through the bottle!  I had the same problem recently though. I bought a 100ml of L'anse Amour from Vapour North, one of my fav juices ever. About half way through the bottle it started tasting like complete ass. Rebuilt my tank, shook the living crap out of the juice bottle, but it still tastes shitty. Thought it's vapors tongue so put it away for a week, nope, still sucks. I'm heart broken because it was one of my top juices and ADV lately but now I can't even take a few pulls without gagging."
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,Robbie-R,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:12:17 2015 UTC,I would recommend either vapor norths bandits breath or Jugheads joke smoke. Both have some other subtle added flavors but they are tobacco flavors that I liked. Taste is subjective. But you may enjoy them as well :)
Canadian_ecigarette,3836m8,ColdHeart95,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard good things about Joke smoke, but when I tried to order in the past the website was a pain in the ass, you could only order during a really small window of time."
Canadian_ecigarette,3840ec,dr_sergen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"An ohm meter is necessary when you are building your own coil, for safety. It tells you how much resistance is going through your wire. Resistance based on wire length, wire material, and wire gauge. Based on what resistance you want, you need a certain wire, at a certain gauge, and a certain length.   Does that help?"
Canadian_ecigarette,3840ec,rocksteadymachine,2,Mon Jun 1 18:20:51 2015 UTC,I think he means this particular ohm meter. It's rechargeable but other than that looks pretty standard.
Canadian_ecigarette,3840ec,majorvapes,2,Mon Jun 1 18:22:31 2015 UTC,i know its necessary but im asking about the one linked in particular. i have never seen this one before and am looking for someone who's used it.
Canadian_ecigarette,3840ec,brutuswar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"I've actually purchase that one from Vapor North. It random stopped reading after a month. It had power and was fully charged, but it wouldn't give a reading at all.  So I ended up purchasing another one, and I went with this one from Fasttech.  It has a battery installed in it already so it will take sometime to ship or get pass the borders."

Canadian_ecigarette,383zsq,rocksteadymachine,3,Mon Jun 1 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"So you can absolutely do dual coils with temp control, that's not an issue. It's just that lot of people find single coils easier to build at that low of a resistance. Personally I would say get a rebuildable of some sort so you're in control and don't have to purchase expensive TC coils. For ease of building get something like a lemo 2 single coil rta or almost any rda that supports single coil builds or dual if you're comfortable with building.  edit: also I would recommend staying away from titanium, it's a dangerous metal to play with"
Canadian_ecigarette,383zsq,majorvapes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I wanna keep dual coil tanks for temp control. I wanna get down to around .1-.2, which I've read is tricky."
Canadian_ecigarette,383zsq,majorvapes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:32:53 2015 UTC,Really it shouldn't be that tricky. With 28g I built one with 16-17 wraps around a 3mm and it came to around 0.12ish.

Canadian_ecigarette,38021u,Drfacialphd,2,Sun May 31 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"I had a few coils with my Freemax Starre 5 pack that had this taste.  It was literally an ""organic cotton"" taste but also chemically like you described, since I can taste some of the juice along with it.  Next time you put a new coil saturate the shit out of it (side holes will be very juiced too) and let it sit for like 30 minutes. Did that on my last 2 coils and they were fine."
Canadian_ecigarette,38021u,sansaset,1 point,Sun May 31 21:58:07 2015 UTC,Will definitely try that. Thanks

Canadian_ecigarette,38021u,sorennordstrom,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:24:05 2015 UTC,Would you suggest 5 or 10 watt increase increments?
Canadian_ecigarette,38021u,sansaset,2,Mon Jun 1 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"Take it easy, no reason to rush it if you're just going to trash coils.  I know some people may think this too cautious a method, but this is a surefire way to break in your coils and definitely not damage them."
Canadian_ecigarette,38021u,ihatethinking96,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:32:26 2015 UTC,I had the shitty taste even ramping up wattage from 30W to 60W.  I don't think its so much ramping up wattage as it is letting the cotton saturate all the way through and through. Only way you'll get that is dropping juice all over it and letting it sit in the tank for a while.
Canadian_ecigarette,38021u,TheVaporist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:58:28 2015 UTC,Drop some juice right on the coil. if u have enough juice soak it in it in a bottle cap or shot glass. Another option you could try to re-wick it with some of your own cotton. Not too complicated should be some videos on YouTube to show you how.
Canadian_ecigarette,38021u,TheVaporist,1 point,Sun May 31 22:10:39 2015 UTC,You don't have to worry about over saturation?

If the prospect can see your excitement and passion for what you're selling than 9/10 they are going to buy in. One thing I learned in sales was at any given time when you're meeting with a prospect is that a sale is always happening, either you selling the person on why they need your product or them selling you on why they don't need it, it all comes down to who is the better salesman! I also never back down unless they tell off or threaten my life ahah. I'll keep going back until I get that inevitable ""Yes""  EDIT: I meant to say that I absolutely love what I'd be selling.

Canadian_ecigarette,37yv7w,joekerr37,1 point,Sun May 31 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of time and effort that I think most vendors would rather put into online social marketing to be honest.   Plus, you'd definitely run into issues with the law. Not saying its illegal, but they would be very quick to move you along.   Also, it may actually be illegal with the new advertising/marketing rules applying to vaping (I think they are being treated the same as cigarettes in this regard).   It's why you don't see beer buses or cigarette buses driving around. Yes, you can serve beer from a bus, but I'm sure there are a ton of permits you need to get first.   Good idea, but probably not practical."

I got them in 0mg and had to dilute down so I could up the nic to 12mg, so I can't say how they are as produced. I like a couple of them, but some of the flavors seem very bold, like in-your-face, even after diluting.  I'll say I'm not a fan of the bottles. Mine were sticky and hard to uncap, they're also not the same bottles that are commonplace (like the ones I use, Evaperated, Vapemeet). Otherwise they're okay!"
Canadian_ecigarette,37wovd,Robbie-R,1 point,Sun May 31 09:04:36 2015 UTC,Yes I found the same. Pain in the butt to open for sure. Most flavours were waaaayyy too much for me to handle. Many were very perfumy.
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Lampburglar,3,Sat May 30 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know about people who are buying premium juice in quantity from the states. Most of the people I have heard of who order from the states are ordering vape wild and mbv. While I agree that we have some excellent vendors in Canada, its difficult for them to compete in price with these companies, especially after you factor shipping cost."
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Catmandingo,2,Sat May 30 18:55:04 2015 UTC,Don't forget about that 25% exchange rate on the dollar currently. That pretty much brings it back up to Canadian vendor prices which seem to average at around 17.99per 30mil (b&m average anyways).
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,OBVIOUSLY_NOT_NSA,3,Sat May 30 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"No way. I ordered 2x120ml and 3x20ml from vapewild. Total was 56.94USD shipped. That's for 300 ml. (not even counting the freebie juice they ship with every order.)   Even with the exchange, that's way less than an imaginary Canadian merchant who would only charge 10 bucks for 30ml. And believe me, the average price in Canada higher.   I have tried some great Canadian juices, but when you are going through a lot of juice, it is really expensive."
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Catmandingo,2,Sat May 30 22:01:02 2015 UTC,EastCoastVape does $10 for 30ml...
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,ShitBrixOfSteel,3,Sat May 30 22:44:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but one vendor of how many. And even then, the order would have cost 100cad. Still more expensive.   I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't buy Canadian, I'm just saying that the price isn't comparable for cheap juice."
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Catmandingo,0,Sat May 30 23:02:28 2015 UTC,Stole the comment right away with me. A 17.00 Canadian premium is equivalent to about 14.00 US. Plus if you're into ordering volume most vendors offer free shipping after 100 or so. Plus there's no chance of your stuff getting confiscated.
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Sliparoon,3,Sat May 30 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"Anticipated ""customs took my juice"" post, was pleasantly surprised. Support your local businesses folks. It's the only way vaping will grow up here.  Edit: even I've started supporting local business, which is weird to me. But I realized waiting vs $15 extra, and more local acceptance are two big plusses."
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,demon1102,2,Sat May 30 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"some US juice is much cheaper , even including international shipping fee"
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Tramd,2,Sat May 30 19:09:30 2015 UTC,I don't know where you're looking at prices but it's almost always cheaper from the states. You just get so much more for your money. Not that I bother because of shipping across the border but I can see why.
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,orgy84,2,Sat May 30 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"I find I prefer us made juice, everything I buy in canada seems way to sweet. Not sure if its just me but what is up with evaperated, twelve monkeys ect having so much sweetener in the juice?"
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,joekerr37,2,Sat May 30 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"I'll play devils advocate here and say shouldn't Canadian vendors be ""patriotic"" as well and price products fairly?  Now yes, some do, but there are a TON who do not.   I'm all for buying Canadian, but only if a vendor deserves it. I don't mind a mark up, but within reason.   I buy all my DIY flavouring state-side now because Canadian vendors charge double. I don't want to buy from the US, but I'm not going to pay twice the cost (with less selection to pick from) just to support a Canadian vendor.   [also, I put a lot of blame on Canada Post... they just make it even harder for Canadian vendors to be price competitive).   And let me also add, I don't like how almost no vendors support DIY. I mean, I get it (why support DIY if your profits come from juice)... but this brings us back to are Canadian vendors in any way being patriotic or are they looking out (only) for the bottom line?"

Besides lots of Canadian vendors carry US brands. and I won't pay more than $15 for 30ml. Actually, I'm finding that I don't even want to spend that and looking into DIY.   Edit: and you're totally right. The Canadian vendors are way beyond. I've tried MBV and yuck. Everything I've tried Canadian is pretty damn good!"
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,entity2,2,Sat May 30 19:27:00 2015 UTC,"When I see the posts about asking how to get American juice, I keep quiet but kind of think the same thing. I've bought from plenty of Canadian vendors, and other than a dud here and there, they've all been fantastic blends.   Canada Ejuice and Evaperated are both superb, and I picked up some Gold Seal, Darkside Creations and Juicy Ejuice from local B&Ms as well; all great stuff.  Shop local, motherfuckers!"
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,zolofftt,1 point,Sun May 31 00:08:56 2015 UTC,"I hated Juicy Ejuice, but we got it from a less than reputable vendor.   I come from a family of people who make their living at crafts, arts, etc so the    Shop local, motherfuckers!   is something I totally agree with. Do it when you can, because if the rules about importing get stricter and you can't order American juice, what's going to happen?

Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,zolofftt,1 point,Sat May 30 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of US juices are cheaper than Canadian. You can find some comparable ones, though, in price.

Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,zolofftt,1 point,Sat May 30 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"However, due to import issues I'd much rather pay the $20 for 30ml at my B&M. We don't go through a lot of juice, so that lasts us a week or two.   Also, I have completely fallen in love with a lot of Canadian vendors."
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Pardoz,1 point,Sat May 30 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"Even of you say ""well I really like this juice by such and such a company"" how do you know there's not something being made in Canada that's not pretty much the same thing?   Because I've looked.  There isn't, or if there is the company that makes it is doing a pretty damn good job of keeping it a secret.  Canadian juice companies have really stepped up their game in the past couple of years - we're no longer getting MBV-quality juice at Five Pawns prices - and a lot of people still seem stuck in the mindset that ""US-made=premium"" (protip: it ain't necessarily so), but at the end of the day the US market is so much bigger that there's a wider selection of stuff available there, and for some of it there's just no Canadian equivalent.  I buy my liquid based on how it tastes, not where it's made.  (Even price is a secondary consideration - if I'm going through less than $12/day in juice I'm still coming out ahead financially.)"
Canadian_ecigarette,37veds,Lefty2GunZ,1 point,Sun May 31 06:07:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest... I fully support the Canadian ecig industry and actively buy from several Canadian vendors. BUT, I buy the majority of my juice in bulk from Japejoose in the states purely on a cost basis. When there is extra room in the budget I put an order into SZ or get me some of that Wonderland goodness from Dashvapes. I just go through so much juice now that buying cheap juice in bulk, DiY-ing, and then nursing the Canadian made juice has become (what I feel) necessary... Of course I would love to vape strictly SZ, Dashvapes and other great local juices, my wallet just can't keep up with my consumption. Of course when I get people into vaping I point them in a red and white direction rather than stateside, but they will be going through significantly less juice than me to start.   Just my two cents and me feeling guilty I guess..."

Sure, I can buy american imported or Ontario imported produce from the grocery store for real cheap..but I'm going to go to the farmers market every time and buy fresh local produce for 100% more than at the grocery store. It helps out local business, allows them to continue to do business and what they love, it puts money back into OUR economy and keeps jobs in OUR country. It will be a cold day in hell when I help pay someone's wages and operating costs in the USA. It benefits our country in absolutely no way. I only vape about 60ml a week so maybe for me the cost wouldnt be as impacting as someone who vapes considerably more."

Canadian_ecigarette,37tapf,dashvapes,2,Sat May 30 06:16:46 2015 UTC,I would 100% order it from vapor north. They also toss in a free bottle of liquid. Plus their service is stellar.   EDIT: Also in my experience canvapes service is absolutely terrible. I've never had one good experience with them and I've read around dealing with them when hardware malfunctions is comparable to beating your head off a wall. /u/vapornorth will go to the end of the earth to make sure you're happy.

Canadian_ecigarette,37tapf,mrgravity15,1 point,Sun May 31 21:43:02 2015 UTC,If you think you can wait about 2 weeks. I bought mine from here http://www.eciggity.com/sigelei-150w-box-mod/. It's in perfect condition and they have more colors than black and silver. Also its cheaper and you might still be able to use the 'reddit' or 'reddit10' coupon to save a few on shipping cost.

Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,Lampburglar,1 point,Fri May 29 03:12:05 2015 UTC,Ive been browsing vapor north for a while and wanted to try their new flavours. I just got a sub ohm setup and am looking for some really nice flavours to try. Im hoping this one will be an adv!
Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,Lampburglar,2,Fri May 29 03:13:54 2015 UTC,"I would HIGHLY recommend Sleeping Giant as well  I tried it in the little sampler they sent and it was insane. I don't know how they get that much flavor in there. Vapor North is easily one of if not the best juice maker I've come across. I'd vape any of their flavors long before any so called ""ultra premium"" brands."

With a side of delicious dessert!"

Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,majorvapes,3,Fri May 29 03:43:21 2015 UTC,I received a small sample of Lullaby as a bonus in my first order with Vapor North. I just love it and I will definitely be ordering a larger bottle soon! I was very pleased with all of their premium juices but Lullaby is really special!
Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,kemekokitten,3,Fri May 29 03:29:15 2015 UTC,I did a review on their new premium stuff recently and lullaby came out on top for me. Amazing stuff!! Creamy creamy strawberry!
Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,SesameBigBird,2,Fri May 29 03:49:27 2015 UTC,Yours was one of the reviews i read to make a decision on lullaby!
Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,Thaxxas,2,Fri May 29 03:55:14 2015 UTC,Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Went through it very quick!!
Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,Kherani,2,Fri May 29 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"I recently won their latest give away, the sigelei 150 and all 5 of their new flavors. They all taste good in their own way. I happen to really not like tobacco flavors, so unfortunately that's the only one I don't like, but it's not awful it's just not for me. Lullaby is amazing and so is Giant and the l'anse...  (the lovers). Sorry on phone and don't have them near me atm. So can't remember it's name. So far those three are the best (to me). There is also lady M I think it is and it's like a dessert liquor taste good too but find I can't vape much of it before I find it a little strong. Really enjoy their stuff and I think you will too. Enjoy!"

Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,VaporNorth,1 point,Fri May 29 08:32:15 2015 UTC,Tigers Blood. I'm a vaping newbie and haven't tried many juices but this tigers blood flavor i got off them last week is light and delicious.

Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,JustFucIt,1 point,Fri May 29 16:18:33 2015 UTC,I might be crazy /u/vapornorth might confirm or deny this for me but the liquids in the glass seem to be a different color than those in plastic. Perhaps they have been steeping longer? I might just be crazy though.
Canadian_ecigarette,37odag,konkatenate,1 point,Fri May 29 21:31:22 2015 UTC,Color of the liquid will change depending on the nic strength and how long it's been steeping. Lullaby turns a nice strawberry blonde color at about 12mg. Less strength is more clear and more strength is even darker.  It might look different in the glass bottles as the light refracting will light it up and make it sparkle more. Trick of the eye!

I've tried Innovape Solutions, and it was decent but still had a little too much flavor coming through, though not too objectionable of a taste, just noticeable mild sweet tobacco flavor in it. I think this would be great nic in some blends, but in others you can taste it too much.   I have some on the way from a couple other sources that I'm going to evaluate soon."

Canadian_ecigarette,37lrqy,joekerr37,2,Thu May 28 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"Now imagine they implement a tax/mg of nicotine.  100mg/ml at .5 cents per mg is 50 cents per ml of DIY nic 1L of 100mg/ml goes from $100 to $600 overnight if applied at time of customer sale it only works out to $2.70 for a 30ml 18mg/ml juice, not bad right? Gets the taxes from everybody. DIY'ers included only misses non-nicotine ejuice.  The above is the route I expect them to go - as a DIYer I hope they don't."
Canadian_ecigarette,37lrqy,Vatigu,1 point,Thu May 28 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is though that it still wouldn't come close to offsetting lost revenue from cigarettes (in a world where people vaped instead of smoked).   1L of 100mg would last most people 2 years of vaping if not more.   Plus, would the cost of nicotine patches and gums then be six times more expensive?   It's really hard to implement any kind of tax on vaping (without it being obvious that you're punishing one group of people - say vapers - while not punishing another group - say nic patch wearers- who are both using the same product but paying different prices)."
Canadian_ecigarette,37lrqy,Vatigu,1 point,Thu May 28 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't come close at .5cents/mg But they always start the taxes low. .8 next year 1 cent the year after slowly jacking the cost over time eventually just as profitable as cigs.  Also they have the easy defense that bulk nicotine not used for ""approved cessation products"" is to be taxed.  As much as we know ecigs stop us from smoking they're not medically a ""cessation device""  They're a recreational alternative to traditional cigarettes."

HC knows that they wouldn't win in court so it hasn't been taken to court - if you threaten litigation they just let the package through unscathed.   Provinces wouldn't be regulating their use if they were just illegal. Everyone including politicians understand that HC has no leg to stand on regarding that ruling.
Canadian_ecigarette,37lrqy,winfinite,1 point,Thu May 28 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, that's how they could do it.  But then you could drop $100 on the day they announce it, order 2 years worth, and be done with it.    If they base themselves on the pattern in the US, they'll tax by ml."
Canadian_ecigarette,37lrqy,anxdiety,2,Thu May 28 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"Just throwing this out there, vaping is perhaps the only nicotine delivery device you can realistically stockpile supplies at a huge discount and have them last for years. Can't do that with snus, snuff or cartons of cigs.  It's all a non-issue, stock up and don't worry."
Canadian_ecigarette,37lrqy,MacHater420,1 point,Thu May 28 21:47:43 2015 UTC,The largest problem with all the potential work arounds is the future of vaping. It's great that we can figure out how to DIY and build our own mods. But for someone looking to quit smoking or make the switch the barrier to entry is getting raised exponentially.

Canadian_ecigarette,37mykg,joekerr37,1 point,Thu May 28 22:39:38 2015 UTC,"You tested fate with a reddit name ""lampburglar"" :)  That sucks that all your stuff got stolen. Whatever happened to the old days where cops would actually do an investigation. Now it's like ""You don't have video of them and their address where we can go to arrest them? Sorry, nothing we can do then.""  On the positive side stuff like this only happens once in a blue moon in life... so you should be in for some smooth sailing in the years ahead.   This is also a good lesson for folks to always have a cheap evod battery tucked away in a drawer somewhere for emergencies.   Worse case you can pick one up tomorrow to hold you over until you can afford to replace the stuff they stole."
Canadian_ecigarette,37mykg,joekerr37,2,Thu May 28 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"Its pretty sad to be honest man. The officer that showed up was pretty honest, he outright told me that with nothing to go on, no witnesses or any evidence of any sort, the chances of getting anything back, or finding out who it was was going to be difficult. As much as I hated to be told that..its true I guess. It could have been worse, its all material..the value isn't huge but I'm on a really small budget with having kids and a wife haha.

Every time I had one they would make me feel sick, I hated that I smelled like them, and they were a huge inconvenience by always interrupting everything. They also were draining me financially and I didn't want that anymore either.  I wanted to be rid of them, so I bought a crappy ego clone from a convenience store and tried it out. Went from over half a pack a day, to nothing, as soon as I bought it. I've never felt better since I started smoking over 10 years ago. Been vaping for about a year and a half, and the only negative thing about it for me is that I want to buy everything and try out all the cool stuff that companies keep releasing. Thankfully I've practiced some restraint in that lol. Istick and RDA nowadays."

A gaming buddy of mine who smoked the same as me switched to vaping and talked to me about it. He told me about how he could walk to the corner store again without getting winded, how he's rediscovered food and how he can smell things again in a way he hadn't for years. After listening to his bullshit for over a year, i had a few extra bucks and went and bought everything i'd need to get started. I haven't had a smoke since the day i bought in. 1 month and 2 days ago."

You're Nautilus Mini was the first Vape product I ever bought!    I switched to vaping because I was having troubles staying off the cigs. Been smoking since I was 14 and have been trying to quit for a number of years with no luck. My wife is incredibly asthmatic so once we got married she asked me to stop for both of our health. Again it was increasingly difficult to quit. A friend purchased a small vape pen set up that helped for a bit. I almost went back to the pack after the carto died until I went to a local B&M to ask for help they suggest your products. I picked up the mini and never looked back!  Cheers

Canadian_ecigarette,37gpxc,raspberry-19,1 point,Thu May 28 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't get lost in the pile of successful Canadians who quit smoking with the help of ecigs. I was a smoker for at least 10 years and my addiction was increasing week after week. My once active life was becoming lethargic, grumpy and unhealthy. I am a tech enthusiast and I saw something online about ecigs. At the time, it was just the ""blu"" brand of disposable ecigs which didn't totally excite me but when I found a site that sold e-go style ecigs I knew it was my chance to quit. I was at about a pack a day when I decided to place the order with a local online shop. The prices seemed reasonable so I bit the bullet.  That was 482 days ago and I haven't looked back since. I saved almost $3000 dollars and days of time that I'd spend out on smoke breaks at work and at home. I no longer stink like an ashtray and I'm returning to my healthy weight/lifestyle. My peers are so impressed that I've managed to stop smoking and some have even started to switch over. I donated the first few e-cigs that I acquired and even bought them some tasty juices. They love it! That is the spirit of the Canadian vaper. Benefit from ecigs over analogs and pay it forward.  Recently, I acquired an Aspire Atlantis and I have to say that it's so much better than any of the Kangertech gear that I've used. The carts last so much longer and at high Watts, they don't taste burnt. I don't know how they do it but they are amazing. If I win this contest (fingers crossed!), I wouldn't keep or sell my bounty. I would pay it forward to someone who really needs it and help them get off of cigarettes. I'd even kick in the ejuice! I never win anything and I'm sure this won't be any different but I'd be thilled if I could win something like this and help at least 1 person redeem their life like I have. I'm glad you've found your way across the border. Aspire, you make a superior product and I'm converted for life.  Sukoto99 PS. Pick me!"

I tried quitting a couple of times but always ended back smoking cigarettes. A few months ago a buddy of mine showed me his Kanger vape pen and after taking a couple hits I realized I can actually quit cigarettes if I had one of these devices. I went home that day and did my research watching endless youtube videos and along the way found this reddit forum and realized there were thousands of people like me trying to quit cigarettes by switching to vaping. After a couple weeks of researching and debating on which mod I should start with, I went and bought my self an IPV Mini v2 a kanger subtank and some juice and haven't had a cigarette since. 2 months in and now I have a desk full of vape gear and empty juice bottles."

Nicotine  degrades from sunlight  and air exposure.  If you can't keep/ store in a freezer.  You  can keep it in a dark spot and in a glass bottle it'll be fine. Plastic is okay for short term storage. But depending  on the strength/ amount it might not matter where u store it and how  often you actually  use it

Canadian_ecigarette,37k17f,setzRFD,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"Nicotine doesn't necessarily ""go bad"" as far as I know. It might lose potency and develop an odd taste (esp. if suspended in PG, where it'll develop an acidic taste not unlike vinegar) with time, as well as change color. Consensus is one year is the turning point, but less so if refrigerated.  FWIW, it's the Liberal government which is behind Bill 45."

Hands-free mode allowed  (3)  Despite subsections (1) and (2), a person may drive a motor vehicle on a highway while using a device described in those subsections in hands-free mode.

Canadian_ecigarette,37hi4r,deathdragon5858,1 point,Wed May 27 19:20:41 2015 UTC,Its 50/50. Majority of the time you will get it. Most vendors are great as discreet packaging and labeling. I've ordered plenty but now days the deals you cab get in country are quite comparable.
Canadian_ecigarette,37hi4r,demon1102,1 point,Wed May 27 18:44:13 2015 UTC,I order from the US all the time and have only had one issue ever and even that was resolved with a reshipment from MBV.

Canadian_ecigarette,37hi4r,ThreeAnneFranks,2,Thu May 28 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"That is pretty sketchy.   I'm used to paying the $20 for 30 ml as well.  There's a couple of companies I can vouch for, though.   One is Flavour Crafters. They are $20 for 30ml as well.  SZVapor is amazing. He gives discounts for reviewing juices as well. His pricing is $15 for 30 ml and around $45 for 100 ml.  I've heard excellent things about The Vaporist. They have a sampler pack for $45 with free shipping and it's 5 bottles of 30ml, but you don't get to pick the flavours. Their regular flavours are $16 for 30 ml or $50 for 120 ml.  Got a chance to try La Vape Shop and they're pretty good as well. $9 for 30 ml for a few basic flavours, but most are around $16 for 30 ml."

Canadian_ecigarette,37hyhj,Vatigu,1 point,Wed May 27 19:44:37 2015 UTC,there's no flavouring restriction yet for eliquid. (Although legislature can easily add flavours to the list later but no flavours are currently on it as banned.)
Canadian_ecigarette,37hyhj,tet5uo,1 point,Wed May 27 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"Usage restrictions are bullshit as well.   The only reason cigs got banned was because they actually are proven to kill people.   There are already means for places to decide for themselves if they want to allow their visitors or customers to vape or not. No one needs laws for this when we already have trespassing laws to remove people who don't listen to your rules.   The only reason for these usage restrictions is to make sure that the public at large equates vaping with smoking so that the sin-taxes won't be argued against. No one fights for smokers, so make sure that vapers are rolled into that group and you have much less work to do."

The Liberals are completely ignoring any studies from reputable health organizations that found E-Cigarettes are FAR FAR Safer than analog cigarettes, and possibly have NO significant threat to the users health.

Canadian_ecigarette,37dp51,dr_sergen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:19:49 2015 UTC,I think lady m is a dessert liquor. Also monkey paw was rhe first juice I bought from them as well as tigers blood. Those used to be my favorites.   What is ice berries flavour? It sound good?
Canadian_ecigarette,37dp51,dr_sergen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:23:48 2015 UTC,ice berries is okay   its not my favourite but it could be someone else's.   i find it tastes of menthol with a hint of lemonade and i'm not a  huge fan of the menthol flavour. it was okay just to strong for me.

Canadian_ecigarette,37faas,beerawk,5,Wed May 27 05:06:46 2015 UTC,"I can only speak on behalf of myself, but I stick to ""non-normal"" flavors if just because it differentiates me. The ingredients we use are finite: one vendor's Peach could very well be identical to another if just because there's only so many Peach flavorings. The appeal to making more complex flavors is in having something that's difficult to replicate or mimic.   Why make a plain single-note flavor when someone can get it from anywhere else? If someone wants ""Peach"", they have several dozen options; if someone wants ""Lemonlight"", there's only one place. This isn't to discredit the merit of plainer flavors: there's definitely a market for it. There's just a lot of places like this already."
Canadian_ecigarette,37faas,setzRFD,1 point,Wed May 27 05:44:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. That helps explain the need for companies to create a great flavor that others can't replicate. I never thought of it that way.
Canadian_ecigarette,37faas,Robbie-R,3,Wed May 27 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"We carry both at vapornorth.com, it's a big diverse market. When people are getting in to vaping we've found that it's better to give them simple flavours they're comfortable with and know what to expect.   Mom hesitant to get into vaping? Get her a strawberry flavour so it's something familiar. Grandpa super stubborn? Maybe a tobacco flavour will make it easier to transition over. This is how a lot of people start vaping.   The problem is that any vendor can carry these flavours in reasonable quality. So now even if I have the best Raspberry around, if you can get another one elsewhere for $1 cheaper that's almost as good you probably will. This causes prices of the e-liquid to progressively become lower and lower making having a wide selection that's taking up space in your shop less and less worth carrying. Especially since everyone is carrying these flavours so you don't sell very many of them in a market that's become incredibly saturated.  How do you combat that? You focus on making complex flavours that only you have the recipe to. If you're a manufacturer worth your salt at all you'll have a wide knowledge of how to make good flavours and what blends well together, as well as being able to spend a lot of time on research and development.   These flavours are usually very popular because they're specially crafted to be a complex blend that the manufacturer has spent many months working on (presumably.) Some vapers use these flavours exclusively, others bounce between the two. It's rare to find someone who's a year into vaping still only on traditional flavours but they are out there.  So why do some shops only carry these complex blends? Space and profit. If a vendor is redistributing flavours, they don't want to waste space on flavours that they have trouble moving. Everybody loves Strawberry, but chances are 10 vendors within as many kilometers carry Strawberry as well. You want to pull in that market so you carry brands of e-liquid that people can't get anywhere near your shop, or at the very least only a couple nearby competitors also carry.  It's unfortunate for sure as traditional flavours sometimes hit the spot just right and are a much safer choice since you'll know what to expect. Buying a ""premium"" e-liquid is a leap of faith and can get discouraging super fast if you have a specific flavour profile you're into. This is why reviewers in our community are offering such a valuable service, mostly for free out of their own time and money.   Hopefully that was clear, I ramble sometimes. If I missed anything or was confusing let me know!"

I do love SZ though. :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,37faas,zolofftt,2,Thu May 28 06:18:39 2015 UTC,Most of our flavors do not contain custards or creams.   Give our super sampler a shot. Its the best value/price you can find atm (30cents/ml)  www.thevaporist.org

My boy friend says it taste like black halls. I say it taste like refreshment. It's not to strong, and day 1 out of the bottle is more fruity, 2 weeks in its more menthol. I buy the 120ml bottles of it but I can't remember the exact price, but it's not expensive."

""Normal"" in this sense is basic fruit, I'm finding complex flavors and dessert flavors come across tasting horrible. Could be my taste buds healing, I dunno. Thug juice is okay,  hawk sauce when the menthol dies down a bit was decent as well."
Canadian_ecigarette,37faas,Robbie-R,1 point,Wed May 27 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, many of the complex liquids end up with the same muddled flavor. I don't need to taste apple pie,,,with caramel sauce, ice cream and cinnamon all at the same time."

Canadian_ecigarette,37faas,ADrunkCanadian,1 point,Thu May 28 22:34:27 2015 UTC,I do buy and vape a lot of custards and more complex stuff. Sure vendors want to try and avoid people stealing their recipes. Although it can still be pretty easy for someone to pick out certain flavors and go from there so in that i see your point (as i can do that quite easily in some cases )people  wish to create more complex things rather than just  strawberry  or coffee etc. When I make myself liquid  I prefer fruits as they require  little to no steeping time compared to custards or tobacco's. I tend to stick to something  more rich and flavorful  as I'm diving deeper into the hobby side of things.
Canadian_ecigarette,37faas,Tramd,0,Mon Jun 8 05:49:52 2015 UTC,Check out customejuice and fusionflavours. You can get 100mls+ at the latter in regular flavour mixes for around $22 before shipping. Customejuice will let you build a flavour (copy a recipe) for $10/30ml.

Such as orange, strawberry, black licorice etc. If that is what you are looking for.  We currently sell our bottles for $17.95/30ml which is $0.59/ml. Another cool differentiation is we used alcohol based flavors as opposed to PG in case of sensitivity.  I've PM'd you a coupon code, let us know if you have any questions!"

Canadian_ecigarette,37d5vj,eastcoastvape,2,Tue May 26 23:15:08 2015 UTC,Hey raztrop. We've tested our nic consistently and compared it with other vendors. We've even had an independent review from a redditer. Our nic is almost bang on. We advertised 50mg and he tested 48 something. While others fell short by at least 5-10mg. This is probably where the short fall is. We also store all our bases in commercial refrigeration to slow degradation of the product.

Canadian_ecigarette,37eeyp,Dubrockn,9,Wed May 27 00:50:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have to be able to state the chemicals in flavouring to state that vaping is still far safer than smoking and certainly doesn't have 4000+ chemicals.  Regarding flavouring:   Generally people add the caveat that some flavors may have health hazards While we don't know about inhalation, the flavourants are GRAS, so they aren't carcinogenic or anything. So unless something special happens to them when vaporized that turns them carcinogenic, any negative health effects are likely not going to give you cancer.  While not empirical, we've got millions of people vaping and so far zero evidence that flavourants cause any kind of negative health effects. Additionally, the body shows zero signs of rejecting the vapor (ie. the lungs don't create mucus and try to cough it up to get toxins out of the lungs like they do with smokers).    There is a point where you can be too strict in terms of safety. I mean fruits have insecticides on them... should we not argue fruits are safe unless we know everything about the insecticides used?  At this point I think the onus is on others to prove that vaping isn't safe because no one is showing any negative health effects from it."
Canadian_ecigarette,37eeyp,joekerr37,3,Wed May 27 00:58:28 2015 UTC,"well, there's this  http://www.dashvapes.com/ejuice-testing"
Canadian_ecigarette,37eeyp,Tramd,3,Wed May 27 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"You are on to something, sort of.  As someone who does DIY, I take a big interest in flavorings and like to know exactly what I am vaping. That is why I order most of my flavorings from well known vendors like The Perfumers/Flavors Apprentice. They have a full MSDS sheet on every single one of their flavorings. Here is the MSDS sheet for a Green Apple Flavoring  where it states the chemical ingredients and says it is not reactive or particularly dangerous.   However, there have not been sufficient studies on the the effects of these chemicals when heated and inhaled. I do know several people that vape only VG with nicotine for that reason."
Canadian_ecigarette,37eeyp,MacHater420,2,Wed May 27 08:36:58 2015 UTC,"I have wondered about the flavorings myself, but until there is proof vaping is bad for me I will continue to believe that vaping is a MUCH safer alternative to smoking.    Most vapers smoked cigarettes for years KNOWING they are really really bad for us. Your not going to scare an ex-smoker off vaping with a little concern about the flavorings :-)"
Canadian_ecigarette,37eeyp,Robbie-R,2,Wed May 27 19:26:41 2015 UTC,Well that's awesome. But the thing is you can back up your information and I dig that.   I'm way into that.   Most people cannot.   Not into that.
Canadian_ecigarette,37eeyp,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Wed May 27 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"A more coherent argument for vaping would be that it contains nowhere near the number of known carcinogens and toxic chemical byproducts found in cigarette smoke, most notably tar. The lack of combustion makes it a no-brainer, but just in case you're still wondering, there are some chemical byproducts that are common between vaping and smoking. In every single instance, they've been demonstrated to be an order of magnitude lower, at levels that are (by scientific and medical consensus) pretty well negligible in comparison to smoking.   The comparison between tobacco combustion and vaping is essential to the argument, because we're not vaping for kicks...we're vaping to quit. Let's see someone list the chemical byproducts found in tobacco smoke from memory!"

The Liberals promise a lot of crap, and in turn take our money.  Exactly where are they going to get $130 billion dollars to pay for ""infrastructure""?  The GDP of Ontario is ~$740 billion, the provinical debt is ~$289 billion and growing.  How to they expect to pay for all of it.  Hudak may have shit the bed and did not properly explain himself, which caused the unions to vote Liberal (after they had made over ~$13 billion disappear and no one paid the price for it), but now those same unions are fighting the government they voted for.  Ontario has no more money.  Expect higher taxes by this time next year, if they aren't making money, its deemed unfit for the public until they can figure a taxing strategy for it.

Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,Lampburglar,2,Tue May 26 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"Diy-ejuice.com and flavourfog.com for flavourings, East Coast Vape for nic base"
Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,guntherslunt,2,Wed May 27 07:36:32 2015 UTC,"Diy-ejuice.com best source for flavorings vg/pg. Despite what other commentor said, diy-ejuice is cheaper for vg/pg and is better then the stuff you'll get elsewhere."
Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,Vendeta44,0,Tue May 26 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"Claiming it's the best source is sort of misleading. While i agree that diy-ejuice is cheaper than most competitors ( I ordered most of my flavors from there), ordering directly from the source is still cheaper. Claiming their PG/VG is cheaper and better is pure BS. First of all PG is 1,2 Propandiol, a simple chemical. Same applies to VG - there is no better or worse unless you dilute it. Second, Diy-ejuice sells 500ml for 14$ and shoppers drugmart sells it for 7$"
Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,MeLurker,1 point,Tue May 26 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"He's not planing to buy in volume. So that would make ordering from the states probably out of the question. diy ejuice has the cheapest flavoring in Canada I have found, and even decent volume prices.  I've had VG from wallmart tasted like absolute trash, it had a overwhelming flavor of rotten fruit. That was with no flavor or nic added. So my experience tells me that VG isn't equal. Never had shoppers so i can't say if there's is any good, but what i get from diy ejuice is solid.  If your order 500ml from diyejuice your doing it wrong. 20$ for a liter or 40$ for 4 liters. Plus when your ordering from DIY ejuice adding a liter of vg to your order can most of the time put you over the 100 mark and get your free shipping. Netting you a bit more savings.  plus something can be said about having all your stuff come from one order. Its convenient especially for me since I don't live in a town with a shoppers and don't like going shopping."
Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,Vendeta44,0,Tue May 26 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really convenient to get all the stuff in one order. I've never tried walmart's VG, though I bought mine at superstore. Can't really compare to others since that's the only one I have ever tried. It's odorless and neutral in taste so I have no complaints."
Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,MeLurker,1 point,Wed May 27 05:38:58 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Canadian who does DIY, I would recommend All E Cig Solutions, FlavourFog, FusionFlavours. I have ordered from all of them and they are all great vendors in Canada. My favorite is All E Cig Solutions as they have a good price, great shipping, sometimes throws in samples, has great customer service, and the owner is also an active member of Canadian DIY E Juicers group on Facebook. (Very good group, would recommend going if you're on Facebook.)  As for Nicotine, I have only ordered 36 mg from All E Cig Solutions so I don't have a lot of information on other nicotine suppliers. All I can say is avoid NorthernNic. They have terrible quality nicotine which has been confirmed by lots. I received a sample from them it was very brown (Oxidized) and smelled like wet ashtray.  /u/BooksofMagic did a great review of Canadian Nicotine vendors that you should check out if you're going to make an order. Do not order nicotine from US vendors, as it most likely will not get through.  I have ordered straight from TPA twice and have had mixed success. My first order was delayed in customs for over 2 months. (Might have been because of the Mary Jane flavoring, but I found it smells more like pine than weed.) My second order wen through without a problem though.  If you have any questions, I will do my best to answer them. Good luck, and have fun mixing!"
Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,MacHater420,1 point,Wed May 27 08:38:15 2015 UTC,Coop coco for vg. Diy-ejuice.com you can get the rest.

Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,ADrunkCanadian,0,Mon Jun 8 05:55:52 2015 UTC,Do not order PG/VG over the Internet the markup is about 100% of what you can get at shopper's drug mart. You need to go the pharmacy section and probably ask them to order it. Just make sure they order USP grade.
Canadian_ecigarette,37ddrr,MeLurker,1 point,Tue May 26 20:31:37 2015 UTC,I never knew you could do that. I don't have a shoppers herd but have Lawton's I'm sure they could do it as well. Thanks for letting me know that

This thing hits like a champ, temp control from what I can tell works flawlessly. I will say, pictures make the mod look big, but its smaller than my buddies Sig 150w (a bit shorter, but a bit wider). The mod feels high quality, has some weight to it.   Shoutout to Hugh from Electric Fog (Regina, SK) for picking it up for his store. Super friendly guy who knows his shit when it comes to vaping!"
Canadian_ecigarette,37code,Vendeta44,1 point,Tue May 26 17:44:01 2015 UTC,Hows the price compared to the sig150?
Canadian_ecigarette,37code,crazyleggs,1 point,Wed May 27 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"Electric Fog is selling the Snow Wolf for 200$ + tax, included with 2 batteries (red AWTs). You can find a few vendors selling the Sig 150 for around 130$ + taxes. For the deal I got, I felt it was worth it. IMO, the snow wolf feels higher quality when compared to the Sig 150. If I had the choice between the two, I'd buy the snow wolf. Does more watts (I only use it at 100w max), and the best temp control I've had so far (compared to heatvape invader mini, and hcigar DNA 40)."

Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,kootenaygal,6,Tue May 26 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"Looks good. I mean you could probably get it cheaper by buying stuff individually.   you don't need a blow torch, I use a lighter ($1) ohm meter is fine, but you can just as easily buy one at canadian tire for $10 (if on sale). It's a generic type though (not specific to vaping), but I prefer that as you can use it for other things. kanthal - buy from them for $5.99, that's a fair price  tweezers - walmart  ($2) organic cotton - walmart ($2) the coil jig looks cool, havent seen that before. but you could buy that by itself from them for $5.99 flush cutters - I just use toenail clippers (but i work with 32g kanthal, which is pretty thin). But you could probably find something identical to this at canadian tire for like $10 or less.  tobh atty - buy from them, they have standalones on sale for $12.99 (but do you even need one? I assume you already have an atty you are rebuilding for)   So you could basically get the same kit for $50 getting it from different places. But the basic essentials (ie. no flush cutters, no tobh atty) would only cost you $27.   As for rebuilding, youtube is your friend for that :)  I rebuild just basic evod atomizers and it's really simple to do. I havne't bought an atomizer now in at least a year.   edit: oops, it also comes with a kayfun tank. So that's $15 (so $50 should be $65 and $27 should be $42)... but once again, do you even need a kayfun tank if you already have a tank?"
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,joekerr37,2,Tue May 26 05:06:08 2015 UTC,Blowtorch is really handy if you ever venture into genesis builds. A normal lighter doesn't quite oxidize the mesh as effectively.   But other than that this is 100% true.
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,Dubrockn,3,Tue May 26 07:15:37 2015 UTC,agreed. If money is no issue the kit is nice in that it's everything you need.   But OP could dabble in rebuilding his current atty's for about $27.   Really just a question of whether he wants to go full on or dip his toe :)
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,joekerr37,2,Tue May 26 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"I've seen some people use blowtorches in some builds, but I never really got why they use one? I just burn the coil till it's glowing brightly then squeeze them together with pilers."
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,I2ecreate,2,Tue May 26 09:55:06 2015 UTC,Can depend on what your building. For example rebuilding subtank coilsheads. You can't dry burn them due to the rubber grommet that might melt due to a hot leg.
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,neveroutgunned,1 point,Tue May 26 12:09:26 2015 UTC,Some crazy builds need to be torched before they can be wrapped. Also it helps take the springy-ness out of the wire so some people heat plain Kanthal and Nichrome 80 before wrapping
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,Awesummzzz,1 point,Wed May 27 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much Joeker37 for taking the time to go over each component in the kit, I really appreciate it! Money IS an issue, but I live in the boonies where the nearest Canadian Tire is an hour and a half away and the nearest Walmart is also an hour and a half away but in the opposite direction, lol, so I may indeed save some money ordering this kit when you consider the gas and time factor.  I do not yet have either a rda or an rba...  Are the ones they include in this kit okay for a beginner? I didn't realize you could actually rebuild basic atomizers! That is something I would definitely like to learn!"
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,joekerr37,2,Tue May 26 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"kanger areo tank  protank mini  aspire bvc  I couldn't advise you on an rda/rba as I've never used one. I rebuild my kanger evod atomizers.   I hope you've been saving the old atomizers you have and not throwing them out :)  You'll still need the metal casing to put the fresh coils and wick into.   I'd take a few days and watch some youtube videos on rebuilding atomizers.   tobh atomizer  and rda (I think) is basically only required if you want to get into sub ohm vaping. Like creating atomizers with a .5 ohm resistence, this will produce much bigger clouds and what not.   But if you are happy with the generic vaping experience, there's no need for an rda/rba, you can just rebuild the attys on your existing models.   They will vape much better as well. Like I'm using just very basic ego batteries (3.7v constant, not variable)... using 1.6ohm atty's with organic cotten for the wick... and I get great vapor and taste (much better than the stock atomizers you'd buy from the store that use silica wick).   Some people want to be able to blow out a giant cloud of vapor, but if you don't care about that then there's no need to get into rda's as far as I'm aware."

Any drill head or even a tooth pick can be used to make generic wraps)."
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,dr_sergen,2,Tue May 26 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"you can get a 510 resistance meter cheaper than the multipurpose one you've listed. I know you enjoy being able to use it for other things but a dedicated meter also acts as a stand to build on. A dedicated meter is also far easier to use to check for shorts. I find this with rebuilding protank heads especially, as the if you don't snip the positive or negative lead on the bottom close enough they can short over the little rubber grommet. Or when you replace the chimney and you've got a larger coil in it the chimney may cause a short you cannot account for.   The tweezers you linked are not ceramic. That is a factor if you want to squeeze your coils while firing them and not cause a short."
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,joekerr37,1 point,Tue May 26 19:16:57 2015 UTC,what is the blow torch / lighter for ?
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,dr_sergen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:02:06 2015 UTC,to heat up the wire and make it more malleable so you can wrap it easily.
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,joekerr37,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:22:17 2015 UTC,okay so could i do this to pinch the coil as well to get rid of the space between my wraps. . .im having problems with learning to wrap coils.
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,dr_sergen,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:25:25 2015 UTC,I think it depends on what you are building.   Like I just build simple evod attys and I don't really need to pinch them.   I think if you are using a thicker gauge and creating sub ohm attys then you do the whole pinch and blast them with the torch thing.
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:35:18 2015 UTC,i have the mutation v3  and using 26 guage wire.  trying to get between .5 and 1 ohms.
Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,joekerr37,3,Mon Jun 1 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"I was considering ordering this kit when I got into RBAs, but I opted to pick up everything from Lightning Vapes instead. Cheaper that way, and I didn't get anything I don't need/want.   My kit in a dollar store case. Not pictured: kanthal & meter.  I got Cotton Bacon (I like this stuff. Others will scoff -- they should try it first!), kanthal (100' spool...still some left after 6 months of wasteful use), ohms meter (doubles as a nice little atty stand while building)...  I added a mini screwdriver that came with my atomizer(s), nail clippers to snip wire, mini scissors to trim cotton, and a Coil Master jig.   I'd HIGHLY recommend the Coil Master. I really can't say enough good about it. Makes wrapping a perfect coil a breeze.  IF you were to take my advice and get the ceramic tweezers, ohm meter, 100' of 28ga kanthal, the Coiler Master and a pack of Cotton Bacon (v2), you'd be looking at ~$57USD before shipping. Subtract 17% using the code ""ohmsweetohm"" and you're down to 47.16. Then you're adding $7 USD for shipping, and converting to Canadian dollars. All in, $67.29 shipped to your door.  That's about the most I'd recommend spending, and you absolutely don't need the Cotton Bacon...the $2 option will work just fine. You don't need the Coil Master, but I really love mine. You don't need the ceramic tweezers, but they're handy. You definitely need the kanthal, though, and LV has the best price on that.   Edit: just finished reading your conversation with /u/joekerr37, noticed you're probably going to be rebuilding your old heads rather than RTA/RDA use. Good on you! I went the RTA route because I found it a little ""finnicky"" to rebuild into such a small case, but power to you...you'll save a bunch of money over buying replacement heads! I'll leave my comment up in case you have use for any of it."

Canadian_ecigarette,37a6bo,onions_can_be_sweet,2,Tue May 26 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"I'm very far from an expert, but once I watched just a couple videos on youtube I was able to build a decent coil around 1 ohm.

Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,Vendeta44,3,Mon May 25 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"It seems fine to me by the looks of it visually, having nicotine handling experience myself. The use of hot glue on the cap is something I've dealt with before as well, I think it's less that the bottle may be leaky so they hot glue it, and more that the hot glue should help ensure that the bottle doesn't actually crack open during transit as you can imagine how terrible that could be. A shame yours came with a bunch of residue, it should have been double sealed imo."
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,IridiumForte,1 point,Tue May 26 00:15:58 2015 UTC,Appreciate the confirmation. A taste test seems to verify what everyone's saying. Perhaps I jumped the gun because of the smell. I'd love to see vacuum seal packing like diy-ejuice.com does and better locking lids on there bottle. Those two things would really make me feel better about purchasing from them agian.
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,IridiumForte,2,Tue May 26 00:28:16 2015 UTC,"Yes without a doubt. Proper packaging, labelling and information should be a requirement, not an exception. Especially in the case of DIY nicotine."
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,setzRFD,2,Tue May 26 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"100mg nic should be relatively odorless. Don't sniff directly from the bottle, but waft it a bit and it should have a slight starchy scent. Starchy like bread and potatoes, but very slight. Nicotine I've handled has a very, very light scent, difficult to notice. It should not stink up a room through the bottle or even when opened.  As for the color: I'm judging the small amount you poured in the cap in the first cap photo (not 2nd). I'd say this is almost on point. Fresh nicotine is a very light beige color. I can't say how it looks right after production, the earliest I've handled was two weeks after manufacturing, and it was a very light slightly-off white eggshell color. As it gets older, it tends to get to a dark red almost brown. I'd say yours is within acceptable color. This eggshell color I mention you can get an idea of by looking up ""#FFF5EB"" on Google. It's my best comparison.  I would exercise caution when handling this nicotine. To be honest, I wouldn't even bother trying it if it's that pungent. Who knows what contaminants may be in it. It also looks a little bit sudsy from your photos, but I don't know the PG:VG ratio. Just FYI, you can dispose of toxic/poisonous wastes no questions asked at some dropoffs. I don't know where you're located, but a police station or hospital might be where to inquire. Please dispose of properly if you end up not wanting the nicotine."
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,beerawk,1 point,Mon May 25 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"Good to know about the smell. I resmelled it wafting at about 6"" and its not nearly as bad but defiantly not nice, and makes me scrunch my nose pretty hard. The color in the cap was about 50% darker in person. To me the smell and color of it seems to fall under what really old non frozen/refrigerated nicotine would be. Compared to the 50mg bottle from ECV that has no coloring or determinable smell after a month of sitting in my mix box non refrigerated.   it's suppose to be 100% vg base and by the consistency of it i'd say its maybe 10-15 % pg.  A picture would be much appreciated thanks :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,on_a_moose,2,Tue May 26 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"I'll say this, I'm a very critical person when it comes to my DIY supplys. Taking that into account I would say there worth trying, I just wouldn't suggest jumping in head first with a 1liter bottle like i did. Just encase you find the smell/taste/color to off putting.  also If hydavape changed there bottles to a more secure bottle that didn't leak my recommendation would be much stronger. But with 100mg nic the biggest thing I'll look for is safety. I'll be moving mine to smaller safer bottles because I don't trust the one they sent it in."
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,tet5uo,1 point,Tue May 26 00:16:34 2015 UTC,I'm going to be starting with 250 ml 100 mg and see what I come up with. I vape about 3-10 ml per day at 6 mg so I guess this would be a decent sized amount. I figure I will go thru flavoring faster than anything else.
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,joekerr37,1 point,Tue May 26 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"The main red flag for me is that the seller tried to bullshit you about it. Bleached? Seriously? Nic develops a deeper colour as it ages, or if it's exposed to light or heat. It's probably not a real fresh batch. It'll probably be more peppery as a result, and will get worse in less time than a good batch would. Keep it in the freezer to try to prolong it, if you're going to go on using it.  You absolutely do need to be careful about dermal exposure to this strength of nicotine, and the way he brushed that off is both irresponsible and unprofessional. My biggest concern is that with the way they communicate, god knows how they go about sourcing their product, if they use proper mixing and bottling techniques to ensure the nic is evenly distributed, or if they even have the first clue about what they're selling.  Also, shake the living hell out of it before use, even before testing. Nic in VG separates quite easily, with the nicotine layering at the top. If you're considering going with this, you should also test it to see what the strength really is. You can get test kits, or look up what you need to DIY that, too.  Based on their responses to you, there's no way in hell I'll be using them."
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Tue May 26 03:02:46 2015 UTC,"Not to show a bias either way, but bleaching nicotine solution is a thing. And does effect the color of the solution.   When it comes to nicotine extraction the distillation process is the preferred method of removing the natural impurities from the plant based liquid.  Most pharmaceutical grade manufacturers prefer this method and this is the method used to extract the nicotine sold at MyFreedomSmokes. An alternative practice is to utilize salt processing to turn the liquid into a sulfate. This process requires a bleaching agent to remove the impurities and then it is reconstituted with a liquid to turn it back into a useable form.  Due to the bleaching agent introduced in this process, the nicotine sulfate product is often mistaken as being more pure.  This is a common misconception because the bleached liquid appears more clear in appearance in comparison to the slightly tinted freebase derived from the more refined and preferred distillation process. Freebase nicotine is also a very reactive chemical and it will often change color in solution. In freebase form it tends to be clear with a slight yellow or brown hue. Once mixed, the range of colors it turns depends on what it's mixed with, though pink is typical in PG, and yellow in VG. source: https://www.myfreedomsmokes.com/tips-info/about-nicotine   This would leave me to believe hyda uses a distilled freebase nicotine that retains more color then the alternative bleached liquid that I presume ECV uses.  But the rest of your comment I mainly agree on. Although I would say after testing it in a unflavored solution that its not as bad as I had anticipated and well it's not on the same level as ECV I'd say its perfectly fine to use. Especially when you factor in the price. The company's practices on the other hand are the main reason I doubt I will be purchasing from them again. Bad bottles, bad communication, bad advice = no bueno."
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,tet5uo,1 point,Tue May 26 03:21:47 2015 UTC,I tried some Hydavape nicotine and would not order again.   Strong smell and left a similar taste to that smell in all my mixes even as low as 2mgs.   Too much terrible nicotine in Canada :(
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,beerawk,1 point,Tue May 26 03:06:31 2015 UTC,"East coast vapes man, that nicotine is as clean as I've ever had. No taste, no smell, no color. It's a bit pricey but well worth the price."
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,beerawk,1 point,Tue May 26 03:23:33 2015 UTC,amen to that brother.   I'd really like to know where these guys are getting their nic.   There's should be some kind of industry standard as to what nic should look/smell/taste like.   I'm damn ready to throw up my hands with Canadian nic suppliers and just order from the US and hope it makes it across the border.
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,beerawk,1 point,Tue May 26 03:28:37 2015 UTC,"Ive ordered from multiple vendors and I consider Hyda's nic to be on point with any other high quality nic out there. It smells the way it should and it looks the way it should. To me, it is one of the best places in Canada to purchase from.   100 mg should have a light  smell to it. The way you describe the smell is not the way I experience it to be. Think maybe your just not used to smelling 100 mg nic? The nic I have received from them smells very similar to any other 100 mg nic I've gotten from other vendors. I would definitely recommend Hyda's nic.   Anyway Ive had multiple experiences with many vendors and I'll keep going back to Hyda (personally)."

You're doing a service for us all!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,Frock_Donghammer,1 point,Tue May 26 20:12:13 2015 UTC,Actually im from small town alberta. Canada post was on there a game with this package i guess lol.  If you can give a small bottle a try. Then order big once your sure its good for you.
Canadian_ecigarette,3793gn,tet5uo,1 point,Tue May 26 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"As many others, my experience with Hydavape has been very good. And as someone pointed out, a 10% solution is not toxic to the touch as people seem to think it is - I mix without gloves, I drip it on my skin all the time, I just wash it off and despite my very sensitive skin, I have never had even the slightest reaction. I mix for a family member that uses 12mg and as I'm at max 3mg for myself, it's hard for me to test it at that level, though I do just to make sure it tastes alright. I find that the nic is very strong and tastes awful but my family member doesn't complain about it, so I'd argue any juice at 12mg would make me go ""yuck"" and it has nothing to do with that nic, while I detect no taste at 3mg. It smells like a nicotine patch, though not overly strong.  What I do and what I suggest is to get it OUT of the plastic bottles, put it in glass amber bottles, you're probably best off to dilute it down as well. I don't much care about the packaging because it's tossed as soon as I get it anyway, it will be better and last longer in glass bottles.  I've also found Jason to be very good in terms of customer service, he answered my questions. I suppose everyone can have a bad day or just not have time for long email responses, I really can't answer to that one though, as any communication I've had with him has been good (then, I know him from a Facebook group, so that may make a difference). The price is right, the product is good, I will continue using Hydavape for my nic."
Canadian_ecigarette,379nvo,setzRFD,1 point,Tue May 26 00:24:44 2015 UTC,holy smokes 2.2ohms? I think the last time I vaped above 1 ohm was my evod 2 lol.  Good review :)
Canadian_ecigarette,379nvo,Vendeta44,1 point,Tue May 26 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"What's really important to me currently is battery life and flavor. Higher ohms = lower amps = longer battery life. Also higher ohms = larger surface area = more flavor. I've done the whole subohm thing and fooled around with builds and came to 1.5-2ohm as my mainstay. 2.2ohm was a build error, but works great!"
Canadian_ecigarette,379nvo,MaddogBC,1 point,Tue May 26 02:30:37 2015 UTC,"Wow our tastes are similar. I've tried all but 1 or 2 of her flavours and only thing I would add to that top 6 would be steaped dreams. It's great stuff.   I would like to get a vape a little closer to what your getting, I could use a little more root beer. I go max VG with low ohm zipper coils and lots of airflow. Might have to try something like your setup to go for that candied root beer. I get more of a ""foam of the top"" flavour presently. Which happens to be my personal favourite part of one of my favourite desserts :)  I could care less about chuckin' clouds but it turns out that I really like a big thick warm inhale. I use a 26650 mutation xl with either max airflow or a big chuff. I'm dusting off my lil guy right now."
Canadian_ecigarette,379nvo,MaddogBC,1 point,Tue May 26 02:38:40 2015 UTC,"More surface area means more vapor and flavor, so you don't have to pick one or the other. At 2.2ohms, it's not really a hot vape (I'm only at 25W), it's about room temp. I do like a tighter draw: I'm using about 1/3rd of one of the Quasar's airholes (other blocked). Subtank Mini with 75% of the smallest airhole open on both sides is also a good comparison.  Zipper coils a bit too advanced for me: I like 'em plain. I usually do 1.5-2mm ID microcoil, about 13-15 wraps of 28ga. Flavor is unreal in everything I've tried. The most adventurous I've ever got with coils are parallel builds, but the Quasar is far too small for these."
Canadian_ecigarette,379nvo,Lampburglar,1 point,Tue May 26 02:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of mech mods. I tried 1-2 ohm early on but couldn't find a sweet spot. Not sure I even could without adjustable wattage. The zipper coils look like a lot of work but once you've built a couple it's real straightforward, and wow, what a difference in density. It's completely ruined vanilla coils for me. It definitely brings out flavours more. But the big seller for me is thickness of vape, the heavy smoker in me craves it."

I scarred myself early on with some chocolate/coffee flavours that I can't seem to shake. I can still taste, and almost smell them months later. This has ruined these flavours for me. I enjoyed the first couple of pulls off achocalypse but after that all I get is something that reminds of that horrible B&M swill I tried way back.  Let it steep for sure, but if you were expecting cadbury's I think you will never be happy. All these flavours are approximations, I don't see chocolate ever getting close to the real thing in vapes. But my experience is limited still to a handful of manufacturers."

Canadian_ecigarette,379psa,nitelifedj,3,Tue May 26 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"A couple factors here, changing your setup and moving to sub ohm vaping usually requires a change to you nic and vg ratio. Typically higher vg and lower nic. However vaping is a journey and especially if you've quit smoking. Your tastes and taste buds have and will change also. I'm always changing things up to keep from getting fatigued with a certain flavour or profile. It's not uncommon to love something one day and hate it the next, tastes change, moods change, seasons change. All these things and more can play a factor. Hopefully the max vg works for you in this case!"

Not exactly muted, not exactly anything but different. I haven't been able to put my finger on just how.  I DIY my juice, and have made some higher % flavouring juices just for the Atlantis.

Canadian_ecigarette,379psa,psychedeliduck,1 point,Tue May 26 15:25:40 2015 UTC,"Yah, I thought I would do that too.  Turns out that the EVODs work better with different juice (more PG, more nic) than what works good in a RDA (more VG, less nic) or sub-ohm tank (more VG, more flavour, less nic).  So keeping them around becomes less of an option over time.  I'll probably vape forward my EVODs at some point, when I trip across some deserving soul."

If you had sent them an email to cancel and they would have still shipped it afterwards, then yes you should keep it and not pay. Since you didn't cancel, they trusted you and sent you the package.   Talk to them. If they make you ship it back, pm me and I'll ship you some free samplers.  As a vendor, I sometimes ship juice orders before receiving payment. I have a few clients that ask to have juice sent to them to be paid later. It's all about trust.  I've had a few cases like this when I started. It made me want to stop sending before receiving payment. I decided I'd take the risk for juice, but not hardware. There are a few bad apples out there...don't be one of them :)  Phil"
Canadian_ecigarette,379x3h,TheVaporist,2,Tue May 26 04:59:34 2015 UTC,I've contacted them. As a business owner myself I would like my customers to be honest as well.
Canadian_ecigarette,379x3h,Vendeta44,6,Tue May 26 17:00:09 2015 UTC,contact the vendor and explain your situation. Your both at fault a bit so chances are they will tell you not to worry about it. Or if not you can at least tell them you will send payment when you can. Or you can write RTV on the package and have it sent back to them at no cost to you.
Canadian_ecigarette,379x3h,ihatethinking96,2,Tue May 26 01:44:23 2015 UTC,I had this happen also. Vendor emailed back saying keep it on the house. Needless to say I ordered again and sent a bit more on the etrasfer for that order. Vendors here are extremely nice. I suggest you email them and inform them.
Canadian_ecigarette,379x3h,Lampburglar,2,Tue May 26 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"Pay for the goods. Its all about good character and honesty. Like Phil said, don't be one of the bad apples!"
Canadian_ecigarette,379x3h,setzRFD,2,Tue May 26 09:25:28 2015 UTC,"While I can understand why they might have shipped first, since it's hard keeping track of everything on busy days, I think the vendor had thought you already paid and shipped out instead of knowingly shipping before payment.  I'd say shoot them an e-mail, at least let them know. Eventually they'll find out, and might assume malicious intent on your end (worst case scenario). It'd be best to clear the air. Ask them what you should do, I'd say chances are high they'd let you just keep the order without paying if you are honest and forthcoming.  Please don't mark it as return to sender, since the receiving party has to pay the return shipping upon receipt to clear it. I've had people mark RTS and personally I'd prefer if they just kept the order, since once e-liquid is shipped out, it cannot be resold. Anything returned needs to be destroyed."

Canadian_ecigarette,379mmx,Catmandingo,1 point,Tue May 26 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"Heatflux is measured by the surface area of the coil, the conductivity between the multiple strands and the amount of wattage(or voltage) pushed through the coil. You can have to completely different coils provide the same warmth of vape and different wattage's because one may have less surface area to heat then the other or the path the electricity takes is more open.  Easiest way to describe it is imagine a snowy highway, a 2 lane road is 32g and a 6 lane free way is 22g. Your goal is to melt the snow on the highway but not cause traffic jams because of to many cars. Each watt is a car. if you put 20 cars on a 2 lane road its busy but not congested and the snow on the road will melt nicely. 20 cars on a 6 lane free way the highway is largely unused and will take a long time for the snow to clear. I Now on the other hand if you put 130 cars on a 2 lane road, it's going to be to congested and the cars will have trouble moving down the road, causing jams and the road to heat up to much. But 130 cars on a 6 lane freeway will very nicely take up all the lanes of traffic and keep the snow melted without causing any traffic jams.  It makes sense in my mind that way at least lol. Also the same is true if instead of 32g its 2 strand twisted and instead of 22g its 4 strand twisted"

Never again, it was a nightmare to use. A lot of pastries might use a very subtle apricot glaze to them, and this is what I wanted to recreate, but it was next to impossible. I'll have to give this a try when I get a chance.  For those curious, the one I tried was FlavorWest Apricot. As a standalone, I found 3-4% flavorful, even if the taste didn't agree with me. In combinations, it drowns out everything else so much, even at 0.5% in a 20% flavor e-liquid, the apricot is a strong punch to the throat."

Some quantities are limited so please place your order on-line and state in the comments what market you will be picking up at if you are looking for something in particular. Prices at the market are 10-20% higher typically to represent the included HST as well as higher operating costs."""
Canadian_ecigarette,375z2y,neveroutgunned,6,Mon May 25 06:08:29 2015 UTC,"There is overhead at the market.  And of course the market stall is affiliated with Canvape.  Buddy was probably just some guy hired to run the market stall - obviously not hired for his brains.  It's a bit sleezy, and certainly stupid....  Still, you're supposed to be able to order online and pick up at the Market instead of having stuff shipped, and just pay the online price.  Canvape's service is a bit lacklustre, but they do have tonnes of stuff in stock and their prices are hard to beat.  I'm not dying to dismiss what happened to you at the market, but I for one am still shopping at Canvape."
Canadian_ecigarette,375z2y,onions_can_be_sweet,4,Mon May 25 06:15:16 2015 UTC,"Canvape generally prices things at a very minimal markup over wholesale cost for a lot of things, which is made up online by volume and only offering free shipping on order >$150. And they even have a disclaimer on their site that buying direct at their flea market locations will run 10-20% higher. Covers HST and the cost of renting the stall space.   But then again that's basically the tradeoff. Rock bottom prices, but mediocre service. For some that's just peachy, but it always bugs me a bit when people expect to pay just over wholesale cost and still get A+ customer service.  Though I will say from my own experience that I've found EastCoastVape to offer prices that are pretty competitive with Canvape, but paired up with some pretty stellar customer service."

Canadian_ecigarette,3769g6,saient,1 point,Mon May 25 06:55:08 2015 UTC,"The first and only 'fancy' coil I've made. Clapton on a plume veil. Can't remember what I wrapped it with tbh, I think both were 28g kanthal, came out to around .25 I believe.   Honestly, took too long to make and too long to heat up. More of a gimmick imo. I stick to normal coils now."
Canadian_ecigarette,3769g6,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon May 25 07:28:40 2015 UTC,"The reason your clapton was lackluster is mostly due to the fact you were using the same gauge for the inner and outer wires. Basically, you just added a huge amount of coil mass without increasing the power to compensate for it. Ideally you want a 6-10ga difference between the core and wrap wires for optimal claptons. Personally I prefer 34ga x 26ga, 34ga x 24ga, and 32ga x 24ga.   Basically, you want it to look something like this. Large core wire to carry the heat, and a fine wrap of outer wire that wicks juice via the capillary effect and acts as a heatsink vastly increasing surface area."
Canadian_ecigarette,3769g6,VaporNorth,1 point,Mon May 25 07:45:57 2015 UTC,I might add it's good to be able to bring your wattage up as well to compensate the speed of heating the coil up.
Canadian_ecigarette,3769g6,saient,1 point,Mon May 25 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"Hah, I actually made the first one with 24g and 28g around it, but the coil was fucking massive and didn't fit into any post holes :( Unfortunately I don't have anything smaller than 28g, but it seems like i might need to pick up a bit to experiment :P."

Canadian_ecigarette,3769g6,setzRFD,1 point,Mon May 25 07:42:50 2015 UTC,"It has more to do with the length of the coil, especially is long pulls are taken. The juice can't reach the middle of the coil since its being vaporized at the edges. That causes the center of the coil to dry out :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3769g6,TheVaporist,1 point,Mon May 25 14:58:37 2015 UTC,Yup..its definitely not made for huge surface area coils. That's explains the dry hits galore ;)

They don't actually sell their juices online, but for the past couple of months they've been having trouble getting their juices across the border to B&M's because of Canada's (?) tight regulations right now. As to why Toronto is having a bit of an ANML's drought atm.  Makes me wonder if we will even see any American juices at VapeCan this year with nicotine in it.

Canadian_ecigarette,3767ns,Mollygrubber,1 point,Mon May 25 13:06:53 2015 UTC,"? It's not misleading at all IMO. There are plenty of stories about nic juice getting seized, hell, it happened to me (3x140mL bottles :( ) It really depends on how the shipper labels it. If the label states that it's nic infused ejuice, chances are pretty good you will lose it. Some of the cannier vendors use creative labelling, that seems to do the trick IME.  As far as bringing it across yourself, how's your poker face? Personally, I'm not willing to lose my (and my wife's) nexus card by getting caught lying. I buy Canadian, and also mix my own."
Canadian_ecigarette,3767ns,Sens420,1 point,Mon May 25 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"OK well don't ship a bloody liter. There aren't many stories of it at all. Most of the labels on mine clearly state ejuice. Never actually crossed the border myself.  Buying Canadian sourced juice and mixing your own is 100% the best way to go. If you have a taste for American juice, buy from the source because there is a 95+% success rate (just don't buy by the liter"

Canadian_ecigarette,37509h,RobertDF902,2,Mon May 25 02:27:20 2015 UTC,I never had any issues with it but you have to be fairly spot on with wicking. If you do drill or dremel the juice channels it's a lot more forgiving. Looks like this new one will be a lot more beginner friendly. Or leak to high hell on thinner juices.

Canadian_ecigarette,374os9,setzRFD,1 point,Mon May 25 01:44:02 2015 UTC,I'm loving Temptations Devils Pudding which is a raspberry custard.

Beats the limited selection I've had (Captian Oliver's, Toronto ejuice co, local companies, Dr Fog, Ruthless, blind pig, sovereign). I just can't get enough of the stuff plus it's decently priced.   Edit:stuff"

Anyway what RDA is that?"
Canadian_ecigarette,373vkb,CuBu,1 point,Sun May 24 17:24:34 2015 UTC,It's the mutation v3 and the jack is on the a frame probably the most solid place to jack on the front end. The factory jack points are on the rocker panels and they are pretty weak
Canadian_ecigarette,373vkb,CuBu,1 point,Sun May 24 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, makes sense!   And as for the rda, how do you like it I just ordered one the v4 or 5 I forget, won't be here for 2 weeks or so. I like the 4 posts rather then 3 that was a good selling point for me"
Canadian_ecigarette,373vkb,goatah,1 point,Sun May 24 17:37:33 2015 UTC,I've had all of them so far and the 4 is on the way they have all been great and I have a bunch of rdas and now of them have compared to the mutation series

We will do our best not to send duplicates in packs for the same customer (unless you order so many packs that we simply don't have enough variety to send you flavours you haven't tried before). This will also take to account flavours you've previously purchased from us, we will try not to include those flavours in the mystery boxes so that you get to try some new flavours in that are close to what you may like.  So short answer, if you order 2 boxes and they're both under the same account, it will be all different juices."

Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,Beohh,1 point,Sat May 23 17:39:19 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add, I am asking because I have a friend who is looking into switch from cigarettes to vaping and he wanted to get a mech mod. I know it is not regulated and requires knowledge on ohms law and such and I would like to have the proper information to give him as I do not know a lot about mech mods myself. Any information would be helpful. Thanks again."
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,anxdiety,1 point,Sat May 23 11:56:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend your friend starting on a mech mod as it requires a little more know how and you can't use tanks on a mech. It's not really the best place to start vaping these days especially if you don't know what you are doing.   The reason people use mech mods is because there was a time when regulated mods just didn't have high wattages without forking over your first born, if you wanted a hotter vape you basically had to use a mech and build a low ohm coil. People still love using them though, they hold a special place in the vape community despite being basically obsolete. There is so much variety in mechs when compared to regulated devices and a lot of them are beautiful works of craftsmanship so it's hard to not want a mech, but like I said I wouldn't start with one."
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,anxdiety,1 point,Sat May 23 12:27:49 2015 UTC,"I concur on not recommending a mech to start with. You can most definitely use tanks on a mech, but that is part of the learning curve as it would depend on the 510 connection of the tank and if your mod is a  hybrid or not.   While they are most definitely becoming obsolete I do feel mechs will outlast almost any regulated device. It's a metal tube with a switch, there's no chip to fail.   The reason I'm still on my mech is mostly for the form factor. I don't want a box in my pocket and I much prefer the small size."
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,drifterramirez,1 point,Sat May 23 12:57:41 2015 UTC,I hear that. What would it depend on if someone were to run a subohm tank on a mech mod? Thanks for the quick response!
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,drifterramirez,1 point,Sat May 23 16:19:34 2015 UTC,Start with the mech. If it is a hybrid then the 510 on the subtank becomes the issue. If the mech is not a hybrid then it's pretty much the same as any tank.   By hybrid I mean that the pin on the 510 of the atomizer makes direct contact with the battery. See mods like the SMPL and the 4nine for examples.
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat May 23 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"look at the connection in the pin on your tank.  if the middle metal disc protrudes visibly past the threading on the connection, it is safe for any mod, mechanical or regulated (assuming you resistance is safe).  if the pin is flush with the threads, it CANNOT BE USED WITH A HYBRID, unless you are metaphorically unattached to your fingers and wish to be literally unattached."
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,unfortunateleader,1 point,Sat May 23 17:05:53 2015 UTC,Haha. Oh okay I see what you are saying. I have 2 tanks. Kanger sub tank mini and aspire atlantis v2. Safe to say you cannot use the atlantisv2 on mech mods then?
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,kraptor,1 point,Sat May 23 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"i've never examined one, but i remember the original atlants is not safe for a hybrid."
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,unfortunateleader,1 point,Sat May 23 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"This.  A Mech mod requires an understanding of electricity and constant maintenance.  It is really not recommended for someone starting that does not have the patience and time to learn how to properly use one.   With all the devices available today, I would see no reason to get one. I still have and use mine at home, but it is only for the form factor and looks."
Canadian_ecigarette,36zas2,TSmashVapes,1 point,Sat May 23 15:35:12 2015 UTC,Ah I see that makes sense. Yeah they do look a lot better compared to regulated devices. What i still dont understand is why you can build sub ohm coils on a mech but not use sub ohm tanks. Thanks a lot for the quick answers by the way!

Canadian_ecigarette,36yqoz,VapeEscapeMTL,3,Sat May 23 07:13:04 2015 UTC,"This is me wishing success! When I got my first mod and sub ohm tank I passed my evod kit over to my grandfather, he's 82 and smoked since he was 8 years old. He has since completely dropped analogs and has continuously been asking me about getting ""something a little bit better"". It always awesome to help your family members get off the death sticks!!"
Canadian_ecigarette,36yqoz,Lampburglar,3,Sat May 23 10:13:59 2015 UTC,Yay!! 1 day turns into two then a week! Good job on you for doing all that for him. You're awesome! Tell your brother to keep pushing. It's not easy but vaping makes it totally possible.
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8np,MacHater420,3,Fri May 22 21:38:38 2015 UTC,Congrats man!!
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8np,majorvapes,3,Fri May 22 22:09:30 2015 UTC,Congrats
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8np,demon1102,2,Fri May 22 22:13:42 2015 UTC,Congrats! How do you make your own juice? o.o
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8np,windowswill,1 point,Sat May 23 02:20:43 2015 UTC,"You purchase flavorings,  nicotine, and vegetable glycerin/propylene glycol and mix together and certain percentages. It is much cheaper then buying juice."
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8np,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat May 23 02:55:07 2015 UTC,Congrats!  The real question would really be: Could you please show us your mods? I am intrigued becuase this is really cool:)
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8np,Hubatola,2,Sat May 23 15:36:27 2015 UTC,Wow - huge achievement! Congrats!!!
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8np,HardWorking4Pennys,2,Sat May 23 02:21:13 2015 UTC,Congrats on the 1 year! I'm on my 4th week and have Zero cravings for a cigarette :)  How much Nic do you use? I started off at 18mg and i'm down to 12mg. Once my 50ml bottle is done I plan on bring it down to 8 or 6mg.
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,bubbzie,2,Sat May 23 05:54:04 2015 UTC,"yes, here is one: http://www.elegomall.com/joytech-evic-vt-full-kit.html, i ordered one, you can ask them for a 5% discount"
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,bevapemonster,2,Sat May 23 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"Don't bother ordering from them. Wait until the thing actually ships out of China to vendors, because I can pretty much guarantee at least a few places will have a better price in CAD, by a solid margin."
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,karmapopsicle,2,Mon May 25 07:58:04 2015 UTC,We should have the evic VT and kanger subox available soon for pre-order.
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,VaporNorth,2,Sat May 23 16:22:38 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,dashvapes,1 point,Sun May 24 02:28:13 2015 UTC,We've got em on the way.  They'll retail for ~ $74.99 for the battery only version (without the tank)
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,Lampburglar,1 point,Sat May 23 06:13:26 2015 UTC,Damn thats a damn good price. I saw them advertised in a few spots for 99+
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,dashvapes,1 point,Sat May 23 10:15:02 2015 UTC,Are you guys going to have the full kit option?
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,karmapopsicle,1 point,Sun May 24 02:27:58 2015 UTC,Unfortunately we won't
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,dashvapes,2,Sun May 24 03:44:59 2015 UTC,You guys are at least going to pick up the matched eGo One Mega tanks and ni200/Ti coils right?
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon May 25 07:56:02 2015 UTC,yep :) we will have the coils.
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,Vendeta44,2,Mon May 25 15:00:18 2015 UTC,Good stuff. We're getting on these immediately too. Hello iStick 50w destroyer.
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,GTAWisSweet,1 point,Mon May 25 21:18:02 2015 UTC,Any update when you'll have the evic for sale?
Canadian_ecigarette,36yntn,Vapetastic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:58:05 2015 UTC,The yellow one looks really sharp. Think it might be time for an upgrade
Canadian_ecigarette,36xhp0,Swelton,1 point,Fri May 22 22:50:54 2015 UTC,"Remember that wide open airflow does not allow for the best flavour mine is probably open a third on a doge v2 clone I'm only at .8 ohms and 30 watts though!   Oh and remember to line up the airflows with the coils, and when you're running a single coil to use the single cool airflow option"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xhp0,CuBu,1 point,Fri May 22 22:56:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! closing the airflow does help the flavor a lot!
Canadian_ecigarette,36xhp0,CuBu,1 point,Fri May 22 23:00:22 2015 UTC,"It also helps for vapor density, the more air the colder the vape and while you can take a longer drag that doesn't relay to a stronger flavour hit or better cloud you gotta find the best airflow for you and the current build. Experimenting is key and it's different for everyone but in general unless you're firing insane wattage the airflow can't be wide open in my experience with my doge anyway"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xhp0,SN1PE_PL,1 point,Fri May 22 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty Clean. I', still chasin the throat hit so 28ga 8 Wraps , gets me at 1.6ohm and thats my sweet spots."
Canadian_ecigarette,36xhp0,GrimReefer_420,1 point,Fri May 22 23:44:30 2015 UTC,"Nice even coils. Looks way better than my first attempt haha. Don't forget to use Steam Engine, it'll really help out. You can put in your desired ohms, the drill bit size and the thickness of your wire and calculate how many wraps you need. For me at first the hardest part was making the wicks even and identical. Too loose or too tight youll end up with a dry hit feeling. I started with single coils until I got the hang of it"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,SuminderJi,4,Fri May 22 21:59:07 2015 UTC,"The June 8th ship date is just in case :) It should arrive sooner than that, but we like to give plenty of time for delays which are sometimes inevitable."
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,dashvapes,1 point,Sat May 23 01:41:38 2015 UTC,Completely understandable.  I'm moving some funds to paypal right now and will place the order tomorrow.  Do you have any specials like tossing in a bottle of juice or something of that like?
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,dashvapes,1 point,Sat May 23 01:43:02 2015 UTC,The price point is the special for the pre-order. It will go up at least $15 once they're in stock
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,drjigarn,2,Sat May 23 01:44:36 2015 UTC,Any updates on the 510 connection? Is it fixed or spring loaded?
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,trev_f,1 point,Sat May 23 06:11:15 2015 UTC,Fixed
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,Hubatola,1 point,Tue May 26 22:32:34 2015 UTC,Awesome.  I'll probably pick up a few bottles regardless.   Hope it lives up to the hype.
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,SPAM-IN-A-CAN,1 point,Sat May 23 01:46:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, available so soon? Excellent! I'm kinda impressed with the price, expected it to be at least $20 higher."
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,dashvapes,1 point,Sat May 23 02:37:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, just curious, what kind of warranty does this kit have? Because I really want to preorder but I am a bit worried of any problems a newly released mod may have. Btw, I really want to order from you guys :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,SPAM-IN-A-CAN,1 point,Sat May 23 14:15:30 2015 UTC,"We offer a 7 day warranty on devices in-store. After that, Kanger you have Kanger's 3 month warranty. (device only)"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,SPAM-IN-A-CAN,1 point,Sat May 23 17:06:57 2015 UTC,Sounds great! I just placed my order today with some juice. You guys have such a great variety of flavors for cheap! :)
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,SPAM-IN-A-CAN,1 point,Sat May 23 19:34:16 2015 UTC,I just ordered Wonderland (and the Subox) and I went all in and got 120ml.  I really hope I'll like it.
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,SPAM-IN-A-CAN,1 point,Sun May 24 19:35:45 2015 UTC,What flavor is that supposed to be? Seems exciting haha.
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,Brown_eyed_pea,1 point,Sun May 24 19:52:53 2015 UTC,Funnel Cake! If you have been to Canadas Wonderland apparently thats what it tastes like.  I actually haven't tried the juice but I'm going by the reviews and me personally loving funnel cake.
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,dashvapes,1 point,Sun May 24 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"I've never had funnel cake, but this seems delicious! Wish I had seen it before placing my order. Oh well, maybe next time :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,Lampburglar,1 point,Sun May 24 20:02:10 2015 UTC,Well since you won't be getting the Subox for another 10 days or so I'm sure you can add it onto that order.  Shoot them a PM. They seem very helpful.
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,ConstantlyOnFire,1 point,Sun May 24 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"Oh true, ty for the advice!"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,Hubatola,1 point,Sun May 24 20:09:35 2015 UTC,Do you guys still have them available for pre order?  I ordered one from ft but I'm skeptical about the shipping and might cancel if theres a better option around.
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,SPAM-IN-A-CAN,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, we do :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,X-Kid86,3,Mon Jun 1 04:00:55 2015 UTC,Godamnit I only want this for the black tank. Arghhhhh
Canadian_ecigarette,36xb6o,lilfunky1,3,Sat May 23 00:17:24 2015 UTC,Great! I was looking for a new box mod to replace my borrowed MVP2.   Can anyone suggest batteries to go with this? Does it need a separate charger or is it okay to just charge it via USB and a wall adapter (I have one from my crapped-out istick 20)?
Canadian_ecigarette,36x8y9,augustinet,2,Fri May 22 21:41:12 2015 UTC,You'll want ni200. Tempered is preferable as it's a tad bit easier to work with I believe.   Edit: nichrome is not for temp control the other two are.

Canadian_ecigarette,36v1zv,jettscythe,1 point,Fri May 22 10:28:02 2015 UTC,Yeah The east coast guys are pretty cool. Their dyi stuff is top notch. Although the were supposed to send me a vape band on my last order. It wasn't in there and I never got a reply back when I emailed them :(
Canadian_ecigarette,36v1zv,Tript-G,1 point,Fri May 22 17:35:19 2015 UTC,I completely forgot vape bands even existed until you mentioned it. I should purchase one.. I take it you recommend them?
Canadian_ecigarette,36v1zv,Tript-G,1 point,Mon May 25 04:00:52 2015 UTC,People use them as a novelty item. I strictly wanted one to protect my tank. As fate would have it I dropped my mod and shattered my subtank mini yesterday:( Thank god for the spare glass
Canadian_ecigarette,36v1zv,eastcoastvape,1 point,Mon May 25 13:41:49 2015 UTC,"Hi Tript-G,  I didn't receive the email. Can you pm me your address and I'll send one out?"
Canadian_ecigarette,36v1zv,abacacus,1 point,Mon May 25 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ECV has become my go-to for a lot of stuff. I prefer Evaperated for liquid, but when I need hardware I check there first. Hopefully my order from them (couple mech/RDA setups and building supplies) should be here Monday, which is very exciting."
Canadian_ecigarette,36v1zv,eastcoastvape,1 point,Sat May 23 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"Nice review! give stormborn a try :) you'll have to put it in the search bar to find i believe unless they've updated that but it's my all time favourite liquid.   I wish /u/eastcoastvape carried IPV3/4's as well as some other mods. I also wish they'd make a section with just building items so it's all easy to find just things like cotton, wicks, wires, tools etc.. also would be nice to see them make rebuildable tool kits like vape29 does http://vape29.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=40_67&products_id=55   but yeah i love ECV, a fantastic vendor and fast shipping to me so thats a plus!  edit: the chuff enuff tip fits only a few RDA's the stillare and a few others depending on the model of chuff enuff you bought"
Canadian_ecigarette,36v1zv,eastcoastvape,1 point,Mon May 25 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"Hello Cubu,  IPV 3/4's are on their way. We take customer requests on mods that are coming out. With so many new products weekly, sometimes it is hard to keep up. Let us know and we'll accommodate!  I will work on that dedicated RBA section for ease of navigation through the website.

Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,CuBu,1 point,Thu May 21 22:25:40 2015 UTC,I almost fainted. I love it.. serious upgrade from my istick thats for sure!   Thank you!   Edit: the screen is dim but I found tutorials on how to fix that issue. Right now it hasnt bothered me but I havent gone outside during the daywith it yet.
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,CuBu,1 point,Thu May 21 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"Someday it will be my upgrade for sure, I was gonna go with a smok m8 but I seen the reports ipv have a clean record.   I'm happy for ya though! What a present for sure!   I seen the rubbing alcohol tutorial I would go with that one, I seen someone who tried to grind it down on the other sub and just ruined his screen so don't go with that one haha.   I couldn't see a dim screen being a issue for me, as I use the same settings most days and you can always just hide it from the sun like you would a phone"
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,CuBu,1 point,Thu May 21 22:45:11 2015 UTC,"It took me a long time to get my list down to two, my 2nd was the sigelei 150w. After reading about the istick 50w and the m8 I was hesitant about built in batteries. I got everything I needed, charger and 2 sets of batteries were included!  There are 5 memory options so even if you want to change it its super quick and easy. I dont see the dimness being a big issue for me either."
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,Vendeta44,1 point,Thu May 21 22:53:21 2015 UTC,Honestly I've got mine down to a ipv 4 or a sigeli100w plus and I'm not sure on which I'm leading towards the ipv4 though I like the features and the pass through charge if I wanna use it sometime. Like when I'm driving or something or when it's in my hand I think I will end up normally charging the batteries in the charger though as it's safer.
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,salladsss,1 point,Thu May 21 23:53:24 2015 UTC,"I don't plan on charging my batteries in it at all. I'm glad I have two sets for that reason - plus my istick as back up if need be. It was a really hard decision, glad I had some help with it!"

Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,salladsss,1 point,Fri May 22 03:44:36 2015 UTC,Just FYI the ipv4 does not have charging with the USB port or pass through.
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,demon1102,1 point,Fri May 22 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not positive on the pass though, but the batteries can be charged in  the device."
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,MrBank513,1 point,Fri May 22 08:49:14 2015 UTC,With like a 9v charger but if you don't buy the one they make you're not covered by warranty if anything happens while charging. I personally wouldn't risk it.

Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,congeequeen,1 point,Thu May 21 23:38:30 2015 UTC,It is! I picked it up at a b&m yesterday along with a bottle of Funksauce. So yummy!
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,Seaofpain,1 point,Fri May 22 00:42:01 2015 UTC,It's my favourite! I have to limit it to 1 bottle every grocery or I'd probably overdose on it.  Thank you!
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,VaporNorth,1 point,Thu May 21 23:47:01 2015 UTC,Grace Soda for the win! Haven't tried the banana but the pineapple is straight fire lol! Setup looking nice though!
Canadian_ecigarette,36t4uc,dienah13,1 point,Fri May 22 00:41:23 2015 UTC,The banana is my all time favourite soda. I used to get the Pop Shop version of it when I was a kid but it's hard to find here now. Thank you! I'm really enjoying it :D
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,SPAM-IN-A-CAN,2,Fri May 22 01:14:22 2015 UTC,100 including juice or without? There are lots of good set ups to be had that's for sure 100$ for equipment alone could get you a great starting setup
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,CuBu,1 point,Fri May 22 01:19:48 2015 UTC,"I can get cheap juice at my local shop, so without :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,greekdude1821,2,Fri May 22 10:21:47 2015 UTC,sub box kit is on preorder for that price
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,frnzy,1 point,Fri May 22 02:46:38 2015 UTC,I already am past the subox but it looks amazing for someone getting into the game.
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,zolofftt,2,Fri May 22 07:26:56 2015 UTC,"If you want something now, I'd say an iStick 30w and a Subtank Mini or Subtank Nano. The iStick 50W has issues with it misfiring that don't seem to occur on the 30w.   The Subox kit is also on preorder for the price you're looking for - I'm going to pick one up for myself (my first mod!)  A ""budget build"" would be a Vision Spinner II battery and a Mini Protank II, which is what I use and would recommend highly if you just want a stick battery. Great flavour. The Mini Protank II is around $10-15 and a Vision Spinner II will run you $25-30. I find them INCREDIBLY low maintenance in comparison to my boyfriend's subtank or Emow Mega."
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,malfunktion,1 point,Fri May 22 03:04:18 2015 UTC,I started 2 weeks ago and this is pretty much what I did. Only I actually got the 50w. More than happy with the setup
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,zolofftt,1 point,Fri May 22 04:04:19 2015 UTC,How has the 50W been? So far so good?
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,malfunktion,1 point,Fri May 22 04:16:21 2015 UTC,"I dont have anything to compare it to - first mod and tank- but I do love the temperature control, vaping at 30w with the subtank mini is quite nice - lots of flavour on all settings with this tank. And it lasts ages between charges!   I'd like to give the rba setup a go one of these days and see what that's like.   I'm a complete noob at this, up until two weeks ago I had no idea what a mod was. Been watching indoorsmokers and rip trippers and lurking on reddit for info as I go along. It's keeping me off the cigs, thats all I really care about. So far so good!  edit: Also, for OP, changing occ coils are easy if you dont want to rebuild. They're like 15 bucks for a pack of 5. Just unscrew old one out, screw new one in."
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,zolofftt,2,Fri May 22 04:27:31 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you're off of cigarettes, hopefully for good. :)   Some of the prefab coils are also pretty easy to dry burn/rewick to get some added coil life. Sometimes rewicking is all it takes."
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,drjigarn,1 point,Fri May 22 05:35:45 2015 UTC,"Do you know when the subox will be coming out? It seems really nice and cool for the price.  Also, I saw that it said something about drip tip on the page though. Does this mean I need to drip a few drops of juice everytime before I start vaping?? Or can I just fill the tank and vape away for the day without worrying?"
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,drjigarn,1 point,Fri May 22 10:29:56 2015 UTC,"Just fill the tank and you are ready to go.  Edit - If you want to try out something cheap and really simple, look into the Joyetech EGO ONE. I like that with the subtank nano rather than the original tank. You can buy just the battery and a nano separately instead of the whole kit. Much cheaper setup than your budget but it is amazingly portable and has plenty of power."
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,zolofftt,1 point,Fri May 22 11:53:41 2015 UTC,Do you know when the subox kit is gonna be released?
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,Lampburglar,1 point,Fri May 22 14:00:44 2015 UTC,Within the month but I think you'll get it in Canada early next month.
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,King0fthejuice,1 point,Fri May 22 19:12:59 2015 UTC,You can just fill the tank. I find that you need to prime it if you don't put juice directly onto the wick (a few draws on it without any power will work).   The Subox is on preorder right now. I think it will be available late June ish?
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,frnzy,1 point,Fri May 22 17:14:06 2015 UTC,Subtank Mini and say an MVP 3.0 or an istick 30w. Great setup IMO..although I know I'll get downvoted for suggesting an istick lol.
Canadian_ecigarette,36tpkn,unfortunateleader,1 point,Fri May 22 01:38:49 2015 UTC,"For a starter vaper I really wouldn't suggest sub ohm right away.  The Istick 30w or a vamo v5 are the mods to start on and slap on an aspire or a aerotank on it.  If you find you want bigger clouds after a little bit of time, upgrade to a subtank or something."

Canadian_ecigarette,36tztr,beerawk,3,Fri May 22 02:44:36 2015 UTC,I think some of them are getting the flavors shipped over and then mix in their own nicotine here.
Canadian_ecigarette,36tztr,ThePare,2,Fri May 22 03:24:31 2015 UTC,My only issue with that is how sanitary is that? Any joe can add nic in his kitchen or in his basement but who know what kind of contaminants are exposed to the juice when they do it?I guess im just a stickler for quality control and accountability.
Canadian_ecigarette,36tztr,WhiteRussian13,1 point,Fri May 22 18:03:31 2015 UTC,... Cause the Original juice manufacturer is certified and regulated in the US right?  If you don't trust your vendor don't buy it - but seriously whose to say the American mfg isn't creating it in a rusted bucket in the basement?   More to the point do you know that every kitchen in every restaurant you've eaten at is 100% squeaky clean and free of cross contamination?   There's different grades of QC required for different industries. Considering there are fewer ingredients involved in adding nic to an already mixed ejuice than there are involved in making a coffee I think you'll be fine in the vast majority of cases.
Canadian_ecigarette,36tztr,Vatigu,1 point,Fri May 22 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly! If you don't trust your vendor find a different one I buy a lot of vendors who make their own juice, I think I can trust them to add nicotine"
Canadian_ecigarette,36tztr,CuBu,3,Fri May 22 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"The way they ship american juice into Canada  is by paying a BROKER to get it across the border, just like most other international items, such as clothes, food,medicine, etc etc. Same thing as paying a lawyer to defend you, paying a realtor to sell ur house etc etc.  Edit: gf has a clothing business that she gets her merch manufactured in Poland and pays a broker to make it a smooth trip through customs without hold ups or delays..."

There was some drama between shops , which led one shop to stop carrying mad mikes and the other to pick up it's wholesale account. It was actually retarded. The shop that made a fuss about the other shop that was selling american juice ""illegally"" was the ones who are now selling it."

Canadian_ecigarette,36trfa,Renslip,2,Fri May 22 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"I ordered myself a Lemo2 from DashVapes. I had been using a Kayfun Lite Plus (v2), but was growing frustrated with the poly tank, and wanted a more open draw.  I use a Provari P3, so I'm obviously not into high wattage vaping. That said, I wanted something with a more open draw so that I could vape straight to lung around the 15 watt mark. The Lemo2 also has a pyrex tank which is great considering how many of my preferred flavours are tank crackers (picture has it filled with 'Nana Cream).  The Provari decided that the prebuilt coil was too low in resistance, so I wrapped a 1.2 Ohm macro coil out of 26 gauge. Mounting the coil was extremely easy, I love the screw down mounting holes. The included wicking material is organic cotton, but I went with Cotton Bacon since that's what I'm accustomed to. I wicked it in essentially the same way I would a Kayfun.  Flavour is light (expected considering the wide open draw). I've had no problems with leaking. The tank is simple to refill, I'm already in love with this tool-less feature. Cloud production is IMHO very good for a single coil at 14 watts, but that isn't really the object for me anyway.  Machining quality is very nice, and I think this piece is good value for the money. I had no problems with it not being properly cleaned of machine oil as I received it. The glass was slightly fogged at one spot, but a quick wipe with rubbing alcohol solved that.  All in all, I'd recommend this product! Easy to build, easy to fill.  DashVapes processed the order in a timely fashion (as they have always done for me before), and it arrived on the earliest day of the shipping window."
Canadian_ecigarette,36trfa,beerawk,1 point,Fri May 22 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"It's a decent tank, easy to build and wick. Jury is out on the top full for me though. Did you get the Nana Cream from dash as well? Tried some my friend got from dash, name is misleading, tasted super artificial and not so creamy. I like the lemo 2 but I much prefer the goblin, although that forces you to build dual coils."
Canadian_ecigarette,36trfa,frnzy,2,Fri May 22 02:48:04 2015 UTC,gotta steep the nana cream. yea it's from DashVapes.
Canadian_ecigarette,36trfa,frnzy,1 point,Fri May 22 03:02:22 2015 UTC,Exactly. My local B&M carries bombies via dash vapes and they recommend 2 weeks steeping for most flavours.
Canadian_ecigarette,36trfa,dienah13,1 point,Fri May 22 07:11:19 2015 UTC,every banana flavour I have ever vaped requires min 12h hour sitting out with the cap off. Strong artificial flavours 9/10 are fixed by letting the juice breathe.

Do you happen to also have the first Lemo? I just wanted to know the comparison.  I own the first Lemo, and I love love love it! I just wanted to know if the Lemo 2 was worth getting (i hear mixed reviews).  How difficult is the top fill? Or if not difficult at all with say ... A unicorn juice tube, or even a simple dropper."
Canadian_ecigarette,36rgc1,VaporNorth,2,Thu May 21 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"this works for a ton of tanks as long as the bottom pin is adjustable, it allows for the best connection as not all 510's are at the same depth, always a good idea to give it a little push out when screwing it on to a different mod, once it hits the connector even if you keep screwing it in then the mod will push in the connector back in while making tight connection."

Canadian_ecigarette,36p7yf,umbrlla,3,Thu May 21 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"Silica doesn't catch fire at higher temperatures, and if you're using it then it's advised that you should give it a vicious dry burn (preferably with a butane torch) to clean it off. It's why they used it for both tests, because with enough wattage and insufficient wicking you can overheat ejuice with it. Cotton combusts, and fairly easily too so you couldn't really do this experiment without getting very different results. It's a demonstration of how, with a simulated condition that would never occur in real life, they were able to achieve a specific, scary result. They couldn't have done this with cotton because if you take a 12-second draw on a cotton wick that has insufficient wicking, at a high wattage then it would destroy the wick before it was able to combust the propylene glycol. The silica wick was a mandatory part of the first experiment because they were essentially, vapourizing the VG while combusting the PG which results in tons of formaldehyde. Couldn't achieve that result with cotton."

Canadian_ecigarette,36p7yf,rush68,1 point,Fri May 22 01:53:44 2015 UTC,Yeah it kind of sucks he used silica wick since most (if not all) tanks these days use organic cotton wicks..

The EVOLV chip had some display issues but I believe they have been solved now. Also VS is very prompt with any type of warranty coverage. Cheers."

Canadian_ecigarette,36p6jy,Robbie-R,1 point,Thu May 21 16:53:47 2015 UTC,By built in batteries do you just like it for the fact it can be pass through charged?
Canadian_ecigarette,36p6jy,unfortunateleader,2,Thu May 21 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a convenience thing for me, that why I'm thinking I'm gonna go for the IVP mini V2, because it still allows you to charge the battery internally."
Canadian_ecigarette,36p6jy,zolofftt,1 point,Thu May 21 20:36:35 2015 UTC,If that's the case then you likely just enjoy pass through charging. I'd suggest the IPV Mini 2 with a Samsung 25R for your battery.
Canadian_ecigarette,36p6jy,Jack_Lad,2,Thu May 21 20:37:48 2015 UTC,This is what I'm rocking and it's great. Get the silver one though my black one looks horrible after having it for a month.
Canadian_ecigarette,36p6jy,NATEMCWN,1 point,Thu May 21 22:33:40 2015 UTC,Ugh. I didn't hear about how easily they scratch up and bought a black one. It's already got a little scuff.
Canadian_ecigarette,36p6jy,Jack_Lad,1 point,Thu May 21 23:35:06 2015 UTC,I would second the suggestion of the IPV Mini 2. It's great!   I also would suggest looking at a mod that does not have built in batteries because once the battery starts going in it you've just lost your entire mod (unless you're technically inclined to be able to replace it.)
Canadian_ecigarette,36ns4h,Lampburglar,4,Wed May 20 18:58:07 2015 UTC,Considering the building in front of you I’d guess zero.

Canadian_ecigarette,36j6a2,Ykram13,2,Tue May 19 20:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah Sunday could end up badly if it were taken seriously.  I'm not great with catchy names, but Sunday's could maybe be a day to show off your favourite juice? Or yourself vaping on a lazy Sunday afternoon (or something relatively close to that).   Or just maybe leave Sunday as a free for all! Maybe post a pic of your vape shelf, a new store you discovered, or maybe a coil you've been working hard at."
Canadian_ecigarette,36j6a2,dienah13,2,Fri May 22 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/dienah13, sunday as a free-for-all would work well, sorta like trees 'slack post saturday'."

I'm finding it hard to source a good printing company (or a decent printer to do it myself).  I'm hoping by end of year to have full-color waterproof+heatproof labels and begin heatshrinking whole bottles since sometimes the labels I have now do arrive damaged or peeled."
Canadian_ecigarette,36ihgg,setzRFD,2,Tue May 19 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the big SZ really sticks out to me, I hope that's incorporated in the new one, perhaps the minimalistic approach just agrees with my eyes.

Canadian_ecigarette,36g0md,zolofftt,0,Tue May 19 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"I've also heard, though, that certain food flavourings are not safe to inhale (those that contain alcohol?). Maybe someone else can confirm."
Canadian_ecigarette,36g0md,thisratwouldlikepie,1 point,Tue May 19 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"Ones with diacetyl, diketones (which turn into diacetyl when heated) are considered somewhat hazardous to inhale. The ones with oils are completely unsafe to inhale. All the flavouring companies that people use tell you about that though. They have ones that are safe to vape, and ones that aren't, and they make it very obvious which is which."
Canadian_ecigarette,36g0md,AnarchoElk,1 point,Tue May 19 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"Oils aren't necessarily bad from what I've heard. the danger is in lipids, which not all oils have.  Diacetyl has als been pretty much overblown, as you'll be getting more out of a regular cigarette than you will from vaping creamy flavoured juice.  It's like saying vaping any juice with nicotine is bad because if you drank 100mg/ml flavourless base you'd die. The amount of diacetyl people working in popcorn factories were inhaling was far more than in a cig or in creamy juice."
Canadian_ecigarette,36g0md,StoneNL,3,Sun May 24 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"ZERO respect for these vaporxs shops. Originally they were setup like pot paraphernalia shops, with bongs all over the place, massive selection of roll papers and weed pipes up the ying-yang. One little glass case with a few evods in it (in the one I was in). And they only sold Dvine Ejuice at a ridiculous price, and I dont even know where that came from.   Looks like they've made some changes since I was in there, but first impressions are everything. I don't buy there, and I don't recommend them to anyone else either.  https://www.facebook.com/vaporxs"

Most employees I've spoken to are knowledgable, and they carry more premium juices brands like Twelve Monkeys. They've also started carrying better mods like the Sigelei 30W and 150W, the KBox, iStick 50W, etc. A bit overpriced but everything is in Newfoundland."

I'm a bit partial to these guys as they took care of me in a big way and I found myself going back and back just to visit and try the tasting bar. This is the one vendor that I like multiple juices from. I really like L'Anse Amour, I think for it's ADV capabilities. I love honeydew but find others to be overwhelming after a little while and I need to change flavours. It's one of my ADV's for sure. Sounds like  have to try Sleeping Giant in my next order, I haven't tried this one yet."
Canadian_ecigarette,36eoa0,TSmashVapes,2,Mon May 18 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"Very glad to share and I can totally see why you're partial to them. I have to say I was extremely impressed with the new line. I know what you mean about honeydew vapes and I like that this one has that mellow feel to it. I really think anyone should be able to find at least one adv in this line as they are all pretty amazing. It was pretty hard for me to rate them all and still sound impartial. When I was rating I really had to reach to find anything wrong with them, well with the exception of Bandit's Breath, that one I debated mentioning the off note cause it was really good and I'm sure others won't taste it that way."
Canadian_ecigarette,36eoa0,TSmashVapes,2,Mon May 18 23:03:39 2015 UTC,"You did a great job of being impartial, I wouldn't worry about that, your honesty comes though clearly. It's funny about honeydew because I actually don't like the fruit lol. I've never touched a tobacco flavour that my original two that are still sitting here almost full lol."
Canadian_ecigarette,36eoa0,TSmashVapes,2,Mon May 18 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"Haha I never touch the fruit myself either but love the flavour for some reason. If I could find a honeydew bubble tea flavour I would be done looking!! Tobacco is the same story for me, got a few full bottles but I can honestly see myself vaping Bandit's from time to time. Thanks again for the kind words!!"
Canadian_ecigarette,36eoa0,TSmashVapes,2,Mon May 18 23:41:02 2015 UTC,"Whoa, bubble tea!! Fantastic idea! That screams ADV, when you find that, you let me know!"

Canadian_ecigarette,36dziv,Lampburglar,3,Mon May 18 20:08:07 2015 UTC,I've tried 4 flavors so far..melondramatic is the one I've taken to the most. I really disliked feck off..tasted like eating coffee beans. Berry Royale was a no go..very typical berry blend. Fat Elvis was capable but I think will be great with time. The strawberry kiwi one to me tasted very chemically.
Canadian_ecigarette,36dziv,DJ_Chaps,2,Mon May 18 21:14:08 2015 UTC,"Red Green is nice, I'm a sucker for strawberry kiwi.  Have dripped a handful of others that I knew would fit my normal profile.

However, now I'm 2nd guessing myself and leaning towards the Freemax!  Going to do a little more research but it's definitely between the two.

I'm currently vaping Bandit's Breath and I have to say this is the very first e-liquid I really like! I'm quite new to vaping but I've already tried a couple of liquids.  Note that I'm not that much into fruits/candy flavors. I like darker flavors like caramel, tobacco, coffee, etc. The vapor of Bandit's Breath is full and satisfying. It tastes like pipe tobacoo, sweet but not too much. Very nice!  I can't wait to try the other ones!"

Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,Veinshot,4,Mon May 18 01:56:02 2015 UTC,The US reddit...ECR? is super unhappy with them. Talk about cancelling issues and shitty juice. There's that Canadian one mentioned below that seems to be ok? There's a recent thread here somewhere...
Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,TSmashVapes,2,Mon May 18 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"Absolutely correct. A quick search on here will tell you to run far away from Zamplebox. Substituting house juices as brand name ones, making it very difficult to cancel and lying about all of it blew up in their faces on several threads on ECR. Zamplebox - not even once!"
Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,Hubatola,4,Mon May 18 04:31:57 2015 UTC,I personally recommend Craft Vapery over Zamplebox any day if you can swing the difference. Also hi fellow PEI vaper.
Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,sniper257,8,Mon May 18 02:35:43 2015 UTC,No. Just no.
Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,Vendeta44,2,Mon May 18 03:31:18 2015 UTC,"So strange. I've read all the bad reviews and don't doubt them. But the strange part is a friend here in Ontario has been getting the Zamplebox and it's been nothing but pretty neat each month. Never a problem getting here, nothing broken, a good variety of juices, no house juices replacing premiums, etc. A few in each box aren't to his tastes of course but satisfied with the service overall for sure. I wonder why such a large difference between experiences. Glad to see some other services suggested in this thread."

Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,pancakemixes,2,Mon May 18 02:30:51 2015 UTC,"I used it for a few months. I got a few duplicates. Only found a couple of brands that I really liked. If you're trying to find new brands from around Canada it's kinda fun, but it's just as easy to order sample packs from different companies."

Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,Hubatola,1 point,Mon May 18 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"I have tried FreshAir Box and cancelled after my first month. I'm usually a pretty tolerant guy, but I could not honestly recommend.  Three of the four juices I received were totally unsuited to my tastes (their flavour profile didn't allow for much specifics). Also received the minimum amount of 40 ml's (stated would be between 40 - 60) and zero mg nicotine bottles while being pretty fresh off smoking.  All of the above was probably still workable with myself moving forward, as I was very interested in a subscription service at the time. But their total lack of communication, poor customer service and a dash of arrogance told me to not send them any more money. Received zero response to several emails and only contacted me after I cancelled, with too late an effort to try and save a subscriber.  Running a small business myself I am well aware of the demands on your time. But without consistent customer care and timely communication you won't have to worry about customers for very long because they will go elsewhere, as I have."

Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,Hubatola,1 point,Mon May 18 12:11:41 2015 UTC,"I'm glad your experience has been better than mine. I was very disappointed, as I said, because I was interested in a local subscription service.   I was going to do a review on here, it wouldn't have been a positive one, but thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt. It left a sour taste in my mouth but I have since moved on."
Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,nothing_of_value,1 point,Mon May 18 13:23:05 2015 UTC,"I've used it the last three months, not personally that impressed and will probably cancel this month. I did find a good every day juice from 705 though.  Overall the juice was alright, nothing special. All brands I have tried before. I got a few repeats, last month I got the same flavour profile in multiple bottles.    The biggest disappointment was the brands I have been getting. If you go to their site and look at the brands, there are quite a few good premium brands, but I never got any of them, only seemed to get the same four brands over and over again (none that I would class as premium either). I specifically said I wanted Max VG, and I would estimate, out of the 30 bottle I have received so far, only 5 have been max VG.  Brands from Freshair store/brand page and what I have received over three months listed below, not much variety. out of 25 brands they ""carry"" I have received bottles from eight, with the bulk being from only four.:     Brand Bottles Received    705 2   Badlands by Redux 1   Bangerang -   Canada E-Juice -   Blind Pig -   Charlie's Standards -   Cold Turkey -   Dark Side Creations 8   Dr. Fog 2   Evercloud 6   Five Pawns -   Flavour Crafters -   Maple Leaf Vapes -   Moshi -   Pacific Vapour 5   Premium Labs -   Ruthless -   Sovereign Premium -   Stinky Canuck -   Thera Vape -   Vapeur Express -   Vape Classique -   La Vape Shop -   Vapor North 5   West Coast Clouds 2"

Canadian_ecigarette,36bn78,Lampburglar,1 point,Mon May 18 03:53:39 2015 UTC,I'd personally never use zamplebox...too many bad reviews out there. You can't go wrong with just picking up some /u/vapornorth premium liquids!!

They don't follow flavor profiles at all, lie about origin of their juice and give a shitty customer service. Another downside is IF you find some good juice, well then you have to order juice from 4-5 different places. I would stay away from them."

Canadian_ecigarette,36bd81,dotvapes,3,Mon May 18 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"This kind of thing is so subjective that it's never going to work out.   Different people prefer different takes based on how they vape. The Subtanks for example provide a great option for people who enjoy a cooler flavourful vape in the 15-25w range. It's a completely different experience from pumping 70w through a Starre.  Or what about different coil heads for example? You've got the Smok VCT and GCT in different tiers, yet the coil heads are interchangeable, and there are 4 different types (in addition to an RBA) available to both of those tanks."
Canadian_ecigarette,36bd81,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon May 18 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"That comes down to quality control, the VCT and GCT are separate designs (using same coils). The GCT is much sturdier and well built. The VCT's O-rings are really flimsy, the coils are actually quite good.  As for RBA heads, I have added the *'s :). Nobody will agree 100% but it's a start for someone getting into the vaping world."
Canadian_ecigarette,36bd81,karmapopsicle,8,Mon May 18 01:30:21 2015 UTC,"The biggest issues is that you haven't explained at all what kind of criteria you're using for classifying these tanks. Another glaringly obvious issue is that you've got the Freemax Starre in tier 1, but the Vapeston Maganus, which is the exact same produce with a different name on it, is down in tier 3.  If I were to make a list based on my own experiences it would look completely different, because what I like clearly very different from what you like.  I think if you're trying to put something together for those new to vaping, you'd be better off making categories for different types of vape styles and sorting the tanks out into those, then perhaps going into pros/cons for each."

Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,D3adkl0wn,2,Sun May 17 16:41:01 2015 UTC,They made a slight inline change. The airflow is much better. As is the flavour. :) enjoy.
Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,dicktoronto,1 point,Sun May 17 16:46:47 2015 UTC,Can the airflow really be better? My understanding was that the choke point was the coil itself since the air hole on the coil is smaller than the wide open setting.
Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,RobertDF902,2,Mon May 18 02:00:15 2015 UTC,You most likely bought the Subtank Mini 2.0
Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,ThePare,1 point,Sun May 17 16:49:47 2015 UTC,"You have received version 2 (V2) of the Subtank Mini. Now has dual airflow on both sides, as you mentioned. Should be a benefit to most.  They also upgraded the insulator on the OCC coils a little while back. While some may still receive the original ones with the white insulator, the newer versions are red. You're as up-to-date as can be!"
Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,Hubatola,1 point,Sun May 17 22:41:00 2015 UTC,This is a normal change. This is the same feature that they already implemented on the subtank Plus. It increases air flow by quite a bit.
Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,RonBeastly,1 point,Mon May 18 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"hmm strange.  I always thought: 1.2 ohm OCC = white O ring, .5 OCC = red O ring.  That's how it's always been in my experience."
Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,sansaset,1 point,Mon May 18 03:54:47 2015 UTC,They changed the RBA deck's juice channels after the first batch too. The red o-rings on the OCC's are because the white ones weren't handling the heat very well. And my Subtank Mini came with black replacement o-rings and I ordered mine a couple months ago now.
Canadian_ecigarette,369p5j,Awesummzzz,1 point,Mon May 18 06:50:40 2015 UTC,I'm assuming it has to do with the slightly newer Subtank that they have shown with the new Kbox.

Canadian_ecigarette,3697xz,CuBu,2,Sun May 17 12:09:27 2015 UTC,"I've got the Atlantis v2. great device for chucking clouds. you have so many options for airflow. at the mouthpiece, below the drip tip. only flaw here is that you can not use your own drip tip. I think the device has too much airflow. more airflow gives you less flavour and I personally like a warmer vape.  coils come in 0.3 or 0.5. you can run eleaf melo coils on it. the juice holes on melo coils sit lower than Atlantis coils, which means you can get dry hits but get more flavour.  again, it's a good device for chucking clouds but not the best for flavour. I would personally recommend the subtanks by kangertech."

Canadian_ecigarette,3697xz,tommytw0time,2,Mon May 18 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"I've only tried the Atlantis and the Subtank. Here are my thoughts:  Pros:    Vapor production: It produces a lot of vapor for what it is.   Cons:    Flavor:  I dislike the flavor profile they give. I think it's because the coil heads are not concave. Same can be said about the Subtank RDA base. It's better than the coils, but still far far from a Kayfun. Airflow: I dislike how they give you all the options for a huge airflow, yet do not provide tight ones. When I played with the Subtank Mini, I would close down half of the smallest hole. I think  this makes it a bad starter device as smokers usually like a tighter draw. Security: I dislike the idea of selling someone a starter kit with a 0.5 ohm coil. I think it makes the new vapors skip a step in security and knowledge. I've had cases of people buying an ego battery as a backup for their Subtanks.   I think Sub-ohm tanks are a trend. They are not for everyone (not for me at least, I'll stick to my other RTAs/RDAs). I really hope it will end soon, because it is pushing people to buy more powerful devices without considering their safety. Add the current China mod QC problems and we simply have a ticking time bomb for something to happen.  Sidenote: Were they able to prove the M80 caused the house fire?"

I love the subtank but Dry Hit Society doesnt like me :c. The actic was a pretty decent tank, I find it gave a pretty good flavor, which IMO was better than the subtank.  The Atlantis and atlantis 2.0 are amazing tanks aswell, although the non rebuildable part of it makes it a no thanks for me.  My favorite tank is by far the Delta II. I find it gives an extremely satisfying flavour. I didn't try the rebuildable coil yet but I can't wait to because the Delta II is just really good (for me anyway)!"

Canadian_ecigarette,3697xz,DJ_Chaps,1 point,Sun May 17 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"I've got a Subtank Mini and an Arctic.  Personally, for me, the two aren't directly comparable. The Mini is a flavour monster, the sorta thing I'd run 50/50 juice in and go for nothing but deliciousness, and it does it very well. AMAZING flavour.  The Arctic is a completely different beast. You like power? Well, this thing does too. Throw 50 watts at the .2 ohm coil and it just kinda laughs and waits for you to actually start hittin' that shit. I run it at 70, as high as my mod can go, and it really wants another 20 watts on top of that. The .5 ohm coil was better at 70 for me, I should have bought those instead of the .2's, but live and learn. The flavour isn't bad at all, but it's not on the same level as the Mini. I love the power handling though, so it's my daily driver. The massive airflow is nice too, I like big 'ol lung hits and I find clouds deeply satisfy my inner child."
Canadian_ecigarette,3697xz,abacacus,1 point,Sun May 17 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"Regarding sub ohm tanks, these are the ones I have/have tried:  Subtank/mini, Delta II, Freemax Starre, Herakles, Arctic, Smok VCT, Smok GCT, Smok VCT Pro, Atlantis, Atlantis V2.0, E-Leaf Melo, Maganus  -  These are all so similar I would probably put them into this tier list:  -  Tier 1: Smok VCT Pro, Freemax Starre  Tier 2: Arctic, Delta II, Atlantis V2.0  Tier 3: Subtank/Mini, Heracles, Maganus, Smok GCT  Tier 4: Smok VCT, Atlantis, E-Leaf Melo  -  Where I feel as though Tier 1 is the best and Tier 4 is the worst. The largest difference being between the Melo and the VCT Pro.   This opinion does not include the RDA deck in my consideration. I feel like there are better atomizers for rebuilding if you are interested (Goblin, Goliath etc).   I think the VCT pro and the Freemax Starre have this on lock at the moment. They have great juice capacity, good airflow and great flavour (especially the VCT Pro, AMAZING airflow).  I feel like all these tanks are very close in terms of flavour, all of these are VERY close, the Atlantis actually being the worst in my opinion. The best tank in terms of flavour, for me personally is the Arctic, that or the Starre. They both have great flavour.  Cheers!  DTV_John"

Currently using a Cthulhu and a Subtank Mini, but with the higher VG/max VG juices I've been getting into the Subtank Mini just isn't cutting it (and I lost my RBA section, fml).

I told him that I was looking for distribution and I want to do a vaping contest And that i will need the liquid by THIS friday (the 17th) ( the website stated 3 day in processing 3 days and then canada post (I was supose to get by the 10th)  ... He said I'll put it in overnight shipping so you'll have them by friday... TODAY he send me an e-mail about refund... How Am I supposed to find these premium US brand... In less than 72hr???  The guys is a really good guy no offense... But he is not taking responsability ... Always because of the website and Timespan.... I've receive mother's milk 6mg instead of 3 but the bill in it was stating 3mg... Would that be because of the website...  So basically he does have a big selection... But he doesn't have most of them in stock... You can't rely on the webiste itself for quantity and all... And most of all I'm the living proof you can't rely on him... (so for the 3rd time today (usually he always answer is phone) ... I'll try to join him... And if you see this message it is because he did not answered...  (ho... and i ask him if he have some of the bottle i ordered... that was 48hr ago.. he send me an e-mail about refund... but not about what he had in stock...)

When you placed your order on the website this was explained to you that we had just added those items and some products are not ready yet.   In appreciation for your business we did send you 3 x 30ml bottles for FREE, as well as a $10 store credit (for a value of $94).  We are sorry about the inconvenience and in the end have given you a full refund as you requested."

You should here theguy telling me I should not sell something I don't already have... (i setup a vape contest and a price was a bottle that I order from him)... While he is saying that i was waiting for a bottle that HE DIDN'T HAVE IN STOCK... OH and by the way no one asked you for a website... it is your responsability ... not our ..."

You didn’t get charged for the mother's milk, if you check your refund you only were charged for the Melo atomizer and delivery charge….   Ps. we rather lose customer like you and not deal with this nonsense.  And those bottles that we gave you weren`t a samples.  Regards!"
Canadian_ecigarette,36a6av,littleb2017,2,Sun May 17 18:06:16 2015 UTC,I've heard the delta 2 is pretty mediocre. So many tanks being developed for higher wattages and more cloud production over flavor. Might as well just start vaping straight VG
Canadian_ecigarette,36a6av,Lampburglar,1 point,Sun May 17 19:26:09 2015 UTC,I am willing to try anything.   Just sad that the atlantis was such a let down.
Canadian_ecigarette,36a6av,karmapopsicle,1 point,Sun May 17 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"Delta II has some really great flavour in the 35-40w range. Definitely shines best with creamy/dessert/custard flavours though. Personally I find the main downsides to be the 3.5ml capacity and small juice windows, but the performance is there."
Canadian_ecigarette,36a6av,pancakemixes,1 point,Mon May 18 01:26:22 2015 UTC,Awww yea.  Delta 2 blows the atlantis 2 away.  So tasty with a much thicker cloud.
Canadian_ecigarette,36a6av,Winter_knights,2,Mon May 18 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"You should give the Freemax Starre a try. I got one after my Atlantis smashed to pieces and am soooo happy with it. You can get .5 or .25 coils for it. So far I prefer the .5. Huge flavour, huge vapour production and you can crank that baby up to 60watt. The .25 you should be able to push to 100w, but my mod doesn't go that high. Soon! Anyway. I'm really happy with it. I like it waaaaaaay better than I ever liked my Atlantis."

Canadian_ecigarette,369819,BooksofMagic,1 point,Sun May 17 15:22:38 2015 UTC,I had a pretty bad experience ordering Nic from these guys. Short story is they took my order and my money and didn't ship within two weeks. Pretty big waste of time. I would not recommend. The only positive thing I can say is that they did refund me.
Canadian_ecigarette,368cof,raspberry-19,2,Sun May 17 03:49:14 2015 UTC,Face should survive.  Try taking everything apart and giving it a cleaning.  Give your 510 a swab with a q tip as well.
Canadian_ecigarette,368cof,littleb2017,1 point,Sun May 17 04:41:19 2015 UTC,Thank you!  It's all cleaned up.  Do you happen to know if there is there a reason the ohm reading would jump around pretty wildly?  The coil that came installed always said between 2-2.2.  This new coil is jumping from 2.4-4.6.  I'm freaked out a little.
Canadian_ecigarette,368cof,littleb2017,2,Sun May 17 04:48:35 2015 UTC,All I could think of is a bad connection between the center pin of the 510 and the base of your tank.  Or between the base and coil.
Canadian_ecigarette,368cof,abacacus,2,Sun May 17 04:51:27 2015 UTC,"Something is wonky. If it's a week and a half old, return it.   It's probably won't blow up, but wonky resistance readings will throw off the amp limiting safety features. That's not good."
Canadian_ecigarette,368cof,n-senada,1 point,Sun May 17 04:42:23 2015 UTC,Shit!  This is not what I wanted to hear!!
Canadian_ecigarette,368cof,tet5uo,2,Sun May 17 04:48:56 2015 UTC,"The mvp 2 has a stationary 510 that you may have to pry up to make a proper connection with some atomizers. But, that usually doesn't cause an inaccurate ohm reading. I would guess that the coils are the issue."
Canadian_ecigarette,368cof,tet5uo,2,Sun May 17 07:06:37 2015 UTC,"THis actually does give inaccurate readings when the pin gets pushed in a little. You'll see the resistance jump like that because it's not got a solid connection to the atty.   Pry it up on the edges with a little tiny screwdriver. It should connect properly again, and make sure you don't screw the atomizers on too tightly or you'll just push it down again."
Canadian_ecigarette,367yhz,joeyxl,2,Sun May 17 01:14:09 2015 UTC,I saw one in a shop today. It's a baseball bat. If you're a really big guy it would probably work but for most people it'll be massive. Dudes at the shop were joking about it attracting the ladies just by keeping it in you pocket ;)
Canadian_ecigarette,367yhz,majorvapes,3,Sun May 17 01:17:50 2015 UTC,"So i can have a vape and compensate....nice.  But the size is what attracts me most. Im 6' 4"" with bear hands so it would be perfect for me. Which store?"
Canadian_ecigarette,367yhz,majorvapes,1 point,Sun May 17 01:51:39 2015 UTC,Lol yup! If you've got bear hands it'll probably suit you. Looks good paired with the atlantis mega!!

Canadian_ecigarette,367k39,OLIVERHEART,2,Sat May 16 22:50:12 2015 UTC,around 60 bucks I'd got for either an istick 30w or an istick 20w. I think the 30w is much better thought since it allows you to use subohm tanks. It's 2200mah so on a 1.6-1.8ohm coil it should lasts you about two days.
Canadian_ecigarette,367k39,iKyNeverEnds,2,Sat May 16 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Two real options I would suggest either the Istick 30 which is small and compact, packs a good punch too or you could get the MVP 3.0, which is a even  bigger battery and allows you to charge other devices off if it.   Both are great devices, I use the I stick and my father uses the MVP 3.0.   Both of those have built in batteries and won't require you to  buy them separate.  Check out EastCoastVape they tend to have the best hardware prices in the country I've seen.  Or consistently good anyway"

Because I mostly drip and use sub ohm tanks evaperateds stuff although max vg I think is still better suited for a clearo/kayfun.

Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,Swelton,4,Sat May 16 13:43:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I've got a bunch of 6-8mg juices sitting around also. I'm in the same boat as you.
Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,nitelifedj,3,Sat May 16 14:04:32 2015 UTC,Oh I forgot to add they are 12 mg. I hope to one day find that one juice I can order a big bottle of. Evaporateds frostys breath is the closest I've come to so far. I think I might get sick of the mint though. I've got a sample pack of lost art and some bombies nana cream on the way. Hoping there's a good one in there.

So far Frostys breath, tropi candy from evaperated and grand beach from vapor north on my short list. Just not fully convinced that I could get through a full big bottle without getting tired of it. I really want to find a perfect banana. Tbh I'm enjoying the hunt."

Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,TSmashVapes,2,Sat May 16 22:13:16 2015 UTC,"Wow that really sucks, it's the only vapor north juice that actually tasted good to me! Well, monkey paw is good for a little bit. How you found any substitutes for Grand Beach?"
Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,majorvapes,1 point,Sat May 16 22:53:33 2015 UTC,"L'ase amour or something like that French sounding. It's a new juice they're working on and I got a sample 15ml in my last order.  It's like juicy fruit or some kind of awesome bubble gum I went through the entire 15ml in one day and I can't wait to get my hands on a 120ml.  I'm not a huge fan of Tiger's Blood, but it's a really good flavor. Ice Berries is really good too if you're into Menthol. I think it kicks ass especially on the hot days we're having. Ice coffee + Ice Berries is the shit haha.  I've been bouncing back between the Schwartz and Kilo for ADVs lately though."
Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,Coldshower39,2,Sat May 16 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem.  I saw something floating around here a few months ago.  Basically people signed up and a box was packed by the first person with a bunch of unwanted juices and then they send it to the next person and so on.  Each person can try/take what they want from the box, put in their unwanted juices and send it along.  For some reason you couldn't join after they set up the order and all that.  Anyway, I've been thinking about setting up a new one since I have lots of juice I just don't vape anymore."
Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,dirtychopstickz,2,Sat May 16 15:11:06 2015 UTC,That actually sounds like a great idea. Like a pass around. I would be in if it had a good planner and kind of researched the people it was going to. Like a certain post history qualifier or something. Id hate to see a box full of juice go missing because of one greedy person.
Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,gregariousmstar,2,Sat May 16 15:35:50 2015 UTC,I'd be down to join a box share. I vaped a bottle forward and the damn shipping cost me $13. For one bottle. I've got a few I'd like to trade/share but for shipping money someone could just buy a new bottle.
Canadian_ecigarette,365y4r,OLIVERHEART,2,Sat May 16 18:15:50 2015 UTC,I suppose the logistics wouldn't be that hard to figure out. I would start it but I just work too much to even think about heading that.

Canadian_ecigarette,3668dc,thumpx,3,Sat May 16 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"I don't mind spending the extra few dollars because their supplier can stand behind the product (hence the return) and they are a great shop. If I wanted to get cheap hardware, I'd just order online."

Canadian_ecigarette,3630c3,SirTimmyTimbit,1 point,Sat May 16 09:35:28 2015 UTC,Notice I did edit it and dropped it down to a 7. That was after vaping it a couple hours straight. Too much cinnamon to be all day. Perfect after dinner vape though. Very unique!
Canadian_ecigarette,3630c3,zolofftt,2,Sat May 16 00:18:28 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'm not a huge cinnamon fan but I may order a small bottle to sample.

Canadian_ecigarette,3630c3,tet5uo,1 point,Fri May 15 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"Just saw the announcement that Cerious has been released, might have to put an order in sooner than later ;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3630c3,sonz,2,Fri May 15 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"I'd say if you didn't like the cinnamon in King Custard, you probably won't enjoy Cerious (or Runny Runny) at your current build. I'd try something like /u/dragon-pet suggests and try a tank or higher ohms, since quite a few people are now saying higher watts + drippers accentuate the cinnamon a bit more. I love cinnamon flavors, and a lot of my early stuff used it in good amounts: after King Custard I toned it down to where not many contain it and if they do, in much lesser amounts.  To give an idea of relative cinnamon content, I'd say Cerious is more than King Custard, but Runny Runny is equivalent. I don't use the same cinnamon in these flavors, but some are derivative (eg. I'd classify gingerbread as a cinnamon, pie shell as a cinnamon, cereal as a cinnamon, and so on). I use the same cinnamon as seen in Country Faire in Triple P and at roughly equal amounts if you were curious about that one. Don't mean to dictate or anything, just my thoughts.  Something curious to note: Pom Pomme contains zero cinnamon, but I do taste it. It might be the intermingling between flavors causing it, maybe the apple + graham is making it more sour and resembling cinnamon. Interesting to hear you (and everyone else) reciprocate the idea!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3630c3,SirTimmyTimbit,1 point,Sun May 17 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the explanation and no worries I don't take it as dictation, you've got loads more experience than I do. Don't know about you but I've been enjoying the open dialogue that's been going on with everyone contributing these reviews lately. I'm guessing it's the graham giving it that cinnamon effect. I know in other juices graham has come off spicy to me.  And to be fair I only bumped it down a bit because I found it a tad too much cinnamon to be an adv. I really enjoyed that one and I love cinnamon vapes too. Kings is perfect for me as an after dinner vape!"
Canadian_ecigarette,3630c3,oops-anal,2,Sun May 17 19:13:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review. SZvapor is my last great hope, still haven't found the courage to place an order yet.

Canadian_ecigarette,3630c3,dragon-pet,1 point,Fri May 15 20:04:46 2015 UTC,Glad to share my thoughts. That's sort of what my review campaign has been about. 99% of the time I don't buy the hype and for good reason. I find too many people kiss vendor butt trying to get freebies and stuff. I'll be honest I was a bit skeptical but so far SZ is one of the better all around ones that I've tried and I wouldn't have any trouble recommending you give him a try.

Canadian_ecigarette,3633id,NATEMCWN,1 point,Sat May 16 13:14:44 2015 UTC,I might get one for curiosity.  I've been vaping for 7 months and kicked a pack a day smoking habit.

It massively reduces the chance of leaking out the air holes. I don't buy the juice control thing as it's only useful for refilling especially if you use max vg juice like most people using these types of tanks would be. Plus the goliath is ugly.

Canadian_ecigarette,360k07,TheVaporist,2,Fri May 15 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the honest review! :)  Let the Fruity Limy and Grape Escape steep a bit. The flavors in fruity limy become more detectable and the tiny hint of cream in Grape Escape comes out (I think you'll enjoy it more, but it is still a candy grape).  Deer's Delight, Fruity Limy and Hidden Dragon are VERY hit or miss. You either love it or despise it.   I personally can't vape Custard Accent Banana for more than 1h. I find custards in general to be nauseating. I think it's because of the cultural differences (I'm Lebanese) and different palettes due to our lifelong diets. But then again I knew people wanted one so I took one for the team and made a few. Seeing how people are going crazy over custards, I will work on them more ;)  I've had the opposite experience with Funky Monkey: the ex used to despise the smell of it and would complain non-stop in the car!!! lol. Just goes to show that taste is so subjective.   Believe me I am trying hard to make the high PG juices 50/50 or 70/30, but it is extremely hard to preserve their flavor profile. DD looses it's fruity punch, FL becomes a lot flatter, and FM looses its inhale/exhale balance. I will eventually get them right, but working on so many things right now...   I will be shipping a select few our new flavor coming out next week. It's an apricot flavored 70VG/30PG. I'll reveal the name soon.  Thanks again! And expect a package next week :P     Phil  The Vaporist  EDIT:: Forgot to ask, what was the setup you used?"
Canadian_ecigarette,360k07,majorvapes,0,Fri May 15 06:05:59 2015 UTC,Oh yes please work on those custards some more!!
Canadian_ecigarette,360k07,cbg79,2,Fri May 15 10:57:12 2015 UTC,"Hey now, don't be trash talkin my deers delight! It's probably my favourite flavour ever, and the first 120ml i ever bought. People always tell me how great it smells too haha..  But yes, I'm a high PG guy so i could understand how that might not be someone's ideal. Anyways, just kidding around..thanks for the reviews!"

They both smell amazing but, to me, are totally unvapeable (before and after steeping). I feel like im eating playdoh (or at least the smell) when vaping those"
Canadian_ecigarette,360k07,majorvapes,1 point,Fri May 15 13:52:25 2015 UTC,"The 2 flavors do not share any ingredient (besides PG/VG). This is where your tastebuds are identifying a shared molecule in there and  telling you ""playdoh!!"". Gotta love the brain :)"

It's great and Phil is a solid dude.  I also got an SZ review and a few others coming but want to spread them out a bit and some things still need steeping. Once again I really enjoy your take on things and appreciate your honesty. Looking forward to your next review!!  Edit: sorry didn't even say great review!!"

Canadian_ecigarette,35zcsd,CuBu,2,Thu May 14 20:36:57 2015 UTC,Lemonlight - Lemon zest with cheesecake. My ADV.  Pom Pomme - Tart apple cheesecake.   SZVapor really nails it and is quality juice. Check em out.

Canadian_ecigarette,35zcsd,tet5uo,2,Fri May 15 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"(Note: excuse my ape-like formatting, on mobile)  1. Pom Pomme - a nice cheesecake with apple crumble. Has a very nice cheesecake flavour and a ""real"" apple taste and tang. 2. Vitis Wrath - Cream Soda w/ Grape Ice Cream float. Again, more of a real grape taste, which I prefer over the typical candy grape flavour. Nice creamy finish. 3. Lemonlight - Lemon cheesecake, tastes more like a lemon meringue pie to me, which is by no means a bad thing. 4. Cobblestone Cream - cheesecake with a strawberry preserve, you can really taste a nice graham crust in this one, my favorite strawberry cream flavour to date. 5. Mean Frean - you know those delicious raspberry cream cookies? Tastes near identical, and it's awesome. 6. Triple P - plum peach pear perfect. I guess that's Quadruple P. 7. Runny Runny - pecan buttertart, has a nice light nutty taste to it with a very genuine buttertart taste. 8. King Custard - throw out your idea of the typical custard flavour, this my new standard."

I live in Toronto, usually packages always pass by Mississauga and stays there a day before getting to me. Here's an order I got a few days ago.  Here's a package from FastTech (I can't wait, hope I get the whole weekend to mess around with it!) that has expected delivery as tomorrow."

Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,Robbie-R,4,Thu May 14 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"The /u/mtbakervapor stuff at /u/dashvapes is totally worth the price.  I like the strawberry.  In fact I use it as a base for a Moshi clone.  It should also be noted that the Dash house line of juices is really good too, and is variable vg/pg and is also nice on the wallet.  Dash also carries /u/bombies stuff...  And you can get 50ml bottles."
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,sorennordstrom,3,Thu May 14 22:03:21 2015 UTC,We would love for you to try our juice! If I had to suggest flavors I would go with Banana Cream Pie and Honey Berries :)
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,mtbakervapor,3,Thu May 14 21:23:58 2015 UTC,"After about 2 years of vaping, hawk sauce is the only flavour I use consistently. I have bought 50ml bottles from dash vapes many times.   If you find a flavour you like you can always order the concentrated flavouring from mtbvapor and mix it your self.   I have been doing that with hawk sauce and thug juice for the last while."
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,didnt_I,1 point,Fri May 15 01:35:03 2015 UTC,I also DIY hawk sauce and thug juice using MBV Flavors. The last bottle of thug juice I got from dash was a pink color. The MBV flavor is yellow. Seems to taste different as well. Any idea what's going on there?
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,tommytw0time,1 point,Tue May 19 09:02:14 2015 UTC,All the thug juice I've got is always a amber  pink kind of colour . I find both hawk sauce and especially thug juice seem to get darker over the course of a month or so as they steep. I mix both at %15 flavouring.
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,didnt_I,2,Tue Jun 2 03:29:37 2015 UTC,"I love their Green Apple, tastes exactly like the fruit! It's currently my all day vape since it's so cheap. I did have to let it steep for a week and air out a bit so the strong scent in the beginning would go away. Now it's just lovely!  If you're heading to Dashvape, they have a whole tasting bar to try all their flavours. I'd recommend Nana Cream by Bombies there, it's not as easy on the wallet as MBV's stuff, but it's easily one of my favourite all day juices."
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,I2ecreate,1 point,Thu May 14 22:52:26 2015 UTC,Taste is subjective but mbv does have some decent stuff. I would recommend you go and spend some time tasting them. It'll be worth the drive!
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,majorvapes,1 point,Thu May 14 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"Ok so, MBV is a fairly known good cheap juice company from the States, however it's hard to get big nic orders cross the states so Dash get's it with 0 nic, adds his own nicatine into it and rebottles into more fitting volumes ( such as 15ml bottles etc.) some people complain it's not the same, and in all fairness it probably isn't. just thought you should know this before buying some.  anyway there are plenty of vendors that offer cheap small bottles in variety packs where you can save a dollar or two that way and see if you like the flavours before committing to a full 30+ml purchase."
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,CuBu,2,Thu May 14 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"I thought I was the only one. I have tried 2 different juices from Dashvapes, Kilo Cereal Milk and Wonderlust Smitten and both taste very bland. The flavor is mute on both juices. Probably won't buy juices from them again."
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,dirtychopstickz,0,Fri May 15 05:02:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that!  What setup are you using? (Tank, dripper, etc). If you're near one of our stores, come in and sample all the flavours!"
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,dashvapes,1 point,Fri May 15 05:14:19 2015 UTC,I don't mind if dashvapes is adding their own nic to the juice as long as it still vapes and tastes good. I understand a few Canadian sellers do this with American Juice.
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,CuBu,1 point,Thu May 14 19:12:00 2015 UTC,"fair enough, just thought you should know!"
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,CuBu,1 point,Thu May 14 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks Cubu, I appreciate the input.  Is there anything wrong with Canadian companies adding nic to American Juice?   BTW I also use an Istick 30w & Subtank Mini, very happy with this set up!"
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,lilfunky1,1 point,Thu May 14 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"in my opinion absolutely not, it's exactly what i would do if i wanted to get american juices, but i prefer to shop Canadian.  if you find some MBV juices you enjoy, then perhaps for bigger quantities you can check out Vape29 they sell 236ml bottles of MBV juice for 39$  I'd suggest trying hawksauce btw heard great things about that and one of their apple flavours i forget which.  and i love it, some times i wish i had more power for dripping and i could get .3 ohm coils, at the end of the summer ill probably get a IPV4 perhaps we will see, but for now i couldn't be happier with my setup! it suits it's purpose perfectly! and is so easy to carry/conceal"
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,lilfunky1,1 point,Thu May 14 20:34:15 2015 UTC,Dash vapes has a tasting bar(?) that you can try the various flavours they offer before committing to buying bottles of it.  And the guys in the RH store are super awesome & friendly.  Hubby's ADV is Thug Juice by Mt.BakorVapor.  Got one of my other friends onto it too after testing it in store.  G'luck!
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,lilfunky1,1 point,Thu May 14 19:05:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will put Thug Juice on my short list.

Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,Tramd,1 point,Thu May 14 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"It does not taste like space jam in the slightest. I'm not a big fan of thug juice at all, but my girlfriend loves it. To me, it tastes more like vaping a halls (the throat lozenge) more than anything else. But hey, we all like different things.   My personal suggestion would be hawk sauce. MBV is good juice for the price point. If you can find a juice you like, you can grab a lot of juice for a cheap price to last you forever."
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,mtbakervapor,1 point,Thu May 14 20:25:29 2015 UTC,Yeah.... Big fan of HawkSauce as well.  Picked up Thug Juice 'cause I liked HawkSauce so much and it was WAY too minty for me..... Pretty much all I could taste.   I DO love adding it to other flavours though so I'd actually buy it again when I run out..... Usually 25% to whatever else fruity I happen to be vaping.  Goes great with any melon flavours!
Canadian_ecigarette,35z4p2,Ykram13,1 point,Fri May 15 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"Have you tried hug juice? It's thug juice without the menthol. It's very mild, but if you like using thug just for mixing, it might be worth trying. I got a bottle by mistake and ended up enjoying it."

Canadian_ecigarette,35yqzd,remember_987,1 point,Thu May 14 19:51:07 2015 UTC,That's a good idea.   Absolute max $100. This whole vaping experience has been a huge money sink.
Canadian_ecigarette,35yqzd,zolofftt,1 point,Thu May 14 22:42:43 2015 UTC,Keep in mind the money you save from vaping over smoking. :) But I totally agree. My boyfriend spent almost $200 on a kit and it lasted four or five months. He's now got a 70W iPV Mini II and it's great.

I got my blue cap juices from the guys at DashVape and I absolutely love Nana Cream (bottle's almost empty!) which was recommended by one of the guys working there and the Green Apple. The Green Apple had to be steeped for a week before getting any good which was what the guy at the counter said, but now it's my all day vape!

Honestly almost all of them needed a month to steep before they really started to taste right.  After the steep though... I very quickly ran out!  I just started in on my 140ml of Sinister Grape.  I have no idea what this tastes like after steeping because it was my favourite from straight out of the mail!     Thanks for taking the time to review.

I've never been a fan of the Atlantis personally, but they've also released the Atlantis 2 if you're an Aspire fan.  The sub-ohm tank selection is ridiculously vast these days. Arctic, Herakles, iSub-G, Delta II, and on and on... Most of the better reviewers have the better ones covered by now. I'd recommend checking them out.

Spend a bit more money and get something that everyone knows is reliable.  That being said...keep hearing good things about the arctic.

When I got my iStick 50w, I started seeing some stories of it blowing up and got kinda worried. Everyone kept recommending the Smok m80 as a replacement because it's much better quality and I almost went to buy one. Now I'm seeing reports of it blowing up too. Am I gonna hear stories of the IPV4 blowing up in a few weeks too?   Not trying to hammer your advice, but with devices being released so quickly there's really no device that's been 'tried and tested' enough to know that it's reliable as far as I've seen.  That being said, I've only charged my iStick when I'm in the same room. Never overnight."

Some of my flavors cost up to 5$ a bottle in flavoring alone. I suppose if you were making basic flavors with TFA flavors you could keep costs around there. But I digress :P If you like creamy fruit flavors you should try peachies & cream at the next sale. It's been my ADV since the first bottle and I get nothing but great feedback on it :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,35uy4j,abacacus,1 point,Wed May 13 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"Currently all my mix is max vg, depending of flavor approx 77- 90 % vg to pg.

Honestly should charge a little more, so you can gain more monies to invest in your operation! Even like 10 or something. That would half the cost of my 1x$20x50ml a week even still."
Canadian_ecigarette,35uy4j,morbidangel27,1 point,Thu May 14 01:58:28 2015 UTC,I never really intended to make to much on it. I know how hard it was to afford juice when I was unemployed and broke so this is my way of possibly helping people who need some help. And of course those who just simply want cheaper juice so they can spend more money on the other things they like. Plus it gives me valuable feedback on my flavours and encourages me to keep trying new things. If i didn't want to make new juices to sell I'd probably just sit here vaping peachies & cream for the foreseeable future lol.

Once I got the idea of what some of the flavors I was using tasted like and what they paired nicely with and how much to use I started fabricating my own from scratch. The way I did it I rarely ended up with juice I found unvapeable and I feel like it really fast tracked it because I wasn't banging my head against a blank wall with nothing but bad juice to show for it. I always had at least something someone else had made and proved to be good. Sometimes I use sweetners/additives like smooth and sour. But that's about it. Smooth is a great additive, really helps blend a mix together. www.Diy-ejuice.com is top notch for Canadian diy'ers. And www.eastcoastvape.ca has the best nic I've found in Canada. Give it a shot sometime, It's not as daunting as you may think :)"

I saw that they had the nic, i got half a gallon of VG my mother had kicking around but im wary of how old it might be. I already have my DIY shopping cart all set up for my first try. I'm gunna take a look at some of the recipes, i wanna try my hand at ""frozen"" flavours, so whatever flavour+menthol to give it that coolness. And try combining monster energy flavour with various other kinds. Can't seem to get my hands on pre-made monster flavoured juice anywhere. Thanks for the tips! I hope i can get the funds together soon to get it going. But i need an RDA and a better mod first i think. Taste testing in a subtank would be annoying."

Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,x-manowar,3,Wed May 13 21:33:02 2015 UTC,There is no right or wrong. Do what works for you. That is the whole point of rebuilding. Find that sweet spot that you enjoy it most at.   With 30g wire you'll have extremely little ramp up time. There's also a lot less surface area by comparison to 26g or 24g wire. So yes it may be starting to burn as it's more of a concentrated hot spot.  Check the heat flux on steam-engine.org   There's a whole host of other variables as well. From how you inhale to how you have the airflow set and the liquids you are using. But as long as it works for you then there's nothing wrong with it.
Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,anxdiety,1 point,Wed May 13 22:29:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I'll play around with that app and likely order some bigger gauge wire.
Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,unfortunateleader,2,Wed May 13 22:43:47 2015 UTC,"For 30W I suggest 26ga, it's what I used when I had a istick 30W. If you plan on upgrading to a higher wattage box mod get 24 ga"
Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,tet5uo,1 point,Fri May 15 06:48:45 2015 UTC,I'll have to try both I guess.
Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,tet5uo,2,Fri May 15 14:11:32 2015 UTC,You can't vape that high on the tiny coils you get from 30ga wire. Not enough wire mass. Your build will ramp up too fast and scorch the wicks/juice.   If you built the same resistance with 24 or 22ga you'd have a much more massive coil which can take the wattage without becoming immediately overheated.
Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,mind_circus,1 point,Wed May 13 22:27:35 2015 UTC,Okay that makes sense. My coils do heat up extremely quickly so maybe I should look into some thicker wire. Thanks for the feedback.
Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,RobertDF902,4,Wed May 13 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"You could also try twisting some strands of the wire you do have with a drill. 3 strands of 30 ga would probably get you some nice flavor, too."
Canadian_ecigarette,35vjjl,Vatigu,2,Wed May 13 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"This advice is gold. The twisted 30 will lower your resistance, still ramp up fast and give you a noticably better flavor. Give it a shot if you own a drill"

Canadian_ecigarette,35uppt,Vendeta44,0,Wed May 13 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"The m80 was always a faulty device. So to me that itself warrants it being pulled from shelf's. You say you wont carry P4Y products because they don't support there products, how about the fact smok released a temp sensing product that did not work and still does not, and is now streaming in with reports of lighting on fire. Don't get me wrong I don't have the right to dictate what any vendor carry's or does not carry. I just find it a bit strange that you wont carry P4Y products but continue to carry smok and eleaf istick products that have an arguably worse track record.  edit: to clarify removing smok product from your website would not be knee jerk as these problems have been apparant for over a month now. Only now are more increased number of  incidents starting to surface."
Canadian_ecigarette,35uppt,dashvapes,2,Wed May 13 23:24:55 2015 UTC,"We've previously had personal experience with P4Y, and found their customer service and after-sale support to be horrendous, hence we no longer deal with them. So far, we have had no issues with after sales support on defective eleafs, hence we still carry them. Smok is still a new product for us so that is still to be decided.  Cheers!"

Any and all e-liquid can be imported if a metered dose does not exceed 4mg: every puff of an e-cig you take, even at 24mg, will never exceed this (or even come close to a fraction of it), so I don't see how their ""rule"" affects e-liquid at all."

As far as I understand all inboud mail must be presented to the cbsa, they randomly select a bunch to be 'inspected', some of it I'm sure is also targeted(i.e. known bad sources). The selected mail is then put on carts/skids whatever and await inspection. Even then 'inspection' might just mean they look at the label and send it through. I've had an order sit in customs for 4 weeks and eventually get released un-examined. MBV doesnt hide anything on their labels or manifest so it's easy pickings for inspectors.

The owner/person empowered by the owner(security) can Trespass you from the property, if you refuse to leave, they can place you under citizen's arrest for trespassing and promptly hand you off to an officer of the peace.  The answer is not to ignore the rules but to speak with the people who can change them and as another poster suggested ask for a designated vaping area away from the smokers area. Or a change to the rules that allows vaping in outdoor spaces other than the smoking area.  Security don't make the rules they enforce the rules. Speak to HR."

Canadian_ecigarette,35u88c,dienah13,2,Wed May 13 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, I've encountered this at my workplace recently. Indoors on their property they can tell you no, however outside and doorways is a federal policy, which in ontario at least is not a law yet. Bill 45 passed, however it has not received royal accent yet, so outaide even on their property you are not doing anything wrong in terms of policy and such.   There is a good rule though that we shouldn't push it and to follow what they want, however breathing in second hand smoke IS and WILL affect your health, whih in my opinion is the most important thi g especially as a vaper now. Maybe find a new spot that's not near the door? Even if it's still a no smoking area?   I think a more than fair argument is that you don't want to be exposed to those chemicals while you are working, if they really want you to go outside o designated areas, maybe you have enough vapers that will step up for their health and demand that if forced to go outside and away from doorways, they need to create a safe vaping space for you away from smokers.   It's a personal peeve of mine that I quit, am doing myself and everyone around a solid, yet in forced to still take those smokes in... I find that a breach of my rights as a canadian  Sorry for the wall of text, but it's something that bothers me. Good luck with it all."

Canadian_ecigarette,35rwf6,pancakemixes,2,Wed May 13 03:53:54 2015 UTC,I pre-ordered a black one from Ace Vaper a few weeks ago. They asked if I wanted a silver one instead as they were being shipped first. So mine should be here on Tuesday. Woohoo! I hope you find one!

Canadian_ecigarette,35rwf6,Winter_knights,1 point,Wed May 13 01:16:54 2015 UTC,A lot of people had pre-ordered it and shipments were shorted. Best thing you can do is probably buy it from an online store like gearbest or somewhere and have to wait till inventory comes in.

I would like to participate in a study that would help move the debate along. I DIY juice tonight as I want to see what really goes in some juices. I love loopers but found I started wheezing after a day. I do think there are some issues with some ingredients so studies are needed.  Good or bad, I am a happy vaper but the wild west juice sorta scares me a bit. I can live with the results good or bad, I just like to be educated."

There's another underground activity that's becoming quite common in Canada... when people visit other people's house they often eat food that is cooked without ANY regulation or governmental standards. People are handling RAW meats like chicken and exposing guests to potentially life-threatening illnesses.   The people doing this say it's not a big deal, that their guests can ""trust them"" in the preparation of the food (that it is cooked properly and what not), but we're talking about MILLIONS of people eating food that is being cooked by NON PROFESSIONALS with ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY to governmental regulatory bodies? How safe can this really be?   This trend of people doing things for themselves which could potentially kill them has to stop."

Canadian_ecigarette,35p2n6,toytoy18,2,Tue May 12 11:36:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I just got it yesterday. So far so good. Loving the battery life, it's a huge upgrade from my iStick 30W in that regard. I vaped it for about 15 hours non stop and still have 60% battery left. It's a lot heavier than the iStick but I like how it feels. I haven't ventured into building my own coils yet so I have no opinion on the temp control. All in all my first impression is very good. I haven't used any other box mods yet so I don't really have anything similar to compare it to. Rocks the shit outta the sub tank with the .5 coils in it. I'm a happy camper at this point."
Canadian_ecigarette,35p2n6,Winter_knights,1 point,Tue May 12 14:00:11 2015 UTC,Good to hear hear. I'm thinking about picking one up after reading about all the istick 50w horror stories. Where did you pick yours up from?
Canadian_ecigarette,35p2n6,dotvapes,2,Tue May 12 20:50:35 2015 UTC,Got it from canvape.com. They kind of have a bad name around here but it was the cheapest at the time. I would say go for it man! Not a huge investment and it works pretty damn good on a standard setup.
Canadian_ecigarette,35p2n6,dotvapes,2,Tue May 12 21:38:41 2015 UTC,Mine lasts 3 full days. Takes about 3-5 hours to charge so that's the only downsize I've found. Which coil are you running in your subtank? I've got the M80 and subtank and I'm also vaping BSB loving it. Just finished my second 30ml gonna have to buy a 140ml next time I order from her.
Canadian_ecigarette,35p2n6,dotvapes,2,Wed May 13 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"I've tried the .5 and 1.2 coils in it. I like the .5 better. I'm loving the subtank, such an upgrade from my aerotanks.  As for bsb, I'm on the fence about it. Sometimes I get that nice blue ras flavour but most of the time I get like a watered down blue freezie flavour. I've let it sit for 2 weeks but it hasn't changed. Im really into mana biscuit, so freaking good."
Canadian_ecigarette,35npo4,EskaVape,2,Tue May 12 00:18:40 2015 UTC,"It's illegal to purposefully mislabel product being shipped across an international border.   This could get the shipper in serious trouble.  Lying to Canada Customs is not good, those folks can be rather unpleasant at times.  I believe that e-liquid being a product that is consumed/inhaled it would fall under the food and drug act which means it has to be approved.   If it's not approved by Health Canada then Canada Customs has the right to refuse it.     This is one side to vaping that I tend to agree that the government should implement regulation.  There needs to be control over internationally shipping products meant for human consumption.  E-liquid vendors are required to have insurance to sell their product.  I'm curious if this insurance would cover a case where someone from a different country became ill after purchasing a product that was shipped illegally."

Hell, I know people who have had their flavouring orders held while they ran nic tests on them (eventually passed the tests and the order did arrive).  Basically, at this point in time it's really just not worth risking customs to get juice from the US. Most of the big premium US brands can be found here through various distributors, and there's a big world of really great Canadian makers producing some really fantastic juice."

Nicotine is on a list of prescription drugs that users can't import. There are exceptions, and for us vapers, it should be exempt under the following clause:  ""in a form to be administered orally by means of an inhalation device delivering 4 mg or less of nicotine per dosage unit""  The problem with that argument is ""dosage"" is a medically defined term. As our vaper argument is ""this isn't a medical device"", then we can't have a ""dosage"".  This has gone to court and lost. Search Zen vs Health Canada"

It seems as though if the ejuice has a lot of nicotine it gets refused. My 3mg bottles from Craft Vapery have never been refused."

Threaten that this will be taken to the press, other media, etc. HC will likely settle. Lawyer gets a portion of the settlement, you get paid, everyone's happy."

Both times HC backed off immediately and the package proceeded to delivery.  I think they're afraid of losing in court and setting a precedent.

I said I wanted to try some juice, so he told me to have a seat at the juice bar where two employees were helping customers. So I sit down, neither of them acknowledge at me. Their customers leave so they both get up and go over to the rest of their coworkers to stand around and chat. I was pretty disappointed as I had heard great things from friends and this sub."

Look at the milk man that shit was nasty. I have not had any flavor at Burnaby vapes I dislike, the key there is to try the blend because they have so many and it's not as pompous and playing rich as the other shops you walk in you get a great meet with the staff they have a staff member for every type of vapor. It's cheaper and your done you pay 30 bucks for a 30 ml at east side because they have to pay for the location and all the stupid billboards and fancy things that adorned there shop"

Super nice staff at all three, price for hardware is a bit more than what it costs to ship from the US, but they've all got fair priced premium juices. If you haven't yet, try chupa tits & peech from vaporologie (it's available at all three shops I mentioned) - by far the best yoghurt + fruit juice I've tried. It sells out super fast though, new stock comes in thursday evenings or early friday."

Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,nitelifedj,3,Sun May 10 23:23:34 2015 UTC,Your issue could be occurring because of your pg/vg ratio. I've found with thinner juices like the 70pg/30vg I get the same kind of spitting in my subtank. I normally run 30pg/70vg of higher in mine and it doesn't spit for me.

Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,dienah13,1 point,Mon May 11 19:38:59 2015 UTC,I get this sometimes with various juices. I usually up the wattage a few notches until it goes away. Depends on the coil/wick. It doesn't always work.
Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,beekermc,1 point,Mon May 11 01:12:09 2015 UTC,"My bet is being too much pg for a sub ohm. I don't know why I have this understanding, but it's my understanding that subohm works best with high vg juices. I don't use pg and I have the same tank and get no juice splashes, but I don't have the brand of juice so I could be entirely off."

Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,IridiumForte,1 point,Mon May 11 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"You are getting liquid in your mouth, it's not normal but something I've experienced solely with evaperated flavours as well. It sputters as it vapes. As for if it's harmful, I wouldn't think so. More studies have been done on PG/VG ingestion than inhalation, and nicotine would operate more or less the same via absorption to the blood stream."
Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,radiodog,2,Mon May 11 00:01:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info. I will try that.
Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,vapestashtips,1 point,Mon May 11 06:24:57 2015 UTC,"Cool story bro  Can you cite any sources?  You state that ""If you drank a whole 12mg bottle in one sitting, you'd be dead in a few hours."" Which is interesting, because you don't cite the SIZE of the bottle. That's pretty damn important given the LD50 of nicotine. Which is pretty well understood  Because there's the key factor that the oral mucosa are more critical in absorbing nicotine that the lungs themselves.  Additionally, PG isn't seen to be harmful even when inhaled as a medical delivery method  So, props for trying."
Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,karmapopsicle,1 point,Mon May 11 11:42:20 2015 UTC,"""Half a teaspoon"" of pure nicotine (1000mg/mL) is a completely different ball game.  I don't know any vendors working with anything remotely close to that, let alone selling it. LD50 is 50-60mg/kg, not total.  21mL of 24mg will be enough for a 10kg child; totally possible and it's why we stress the importance of child proof bottles."
Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,NATEMCWN,2,Mon May 11 08:35:56 2015 UTC,"A couple juice labs will buy their nic in high purity bulk, but when those come in they're immediately handled by staff in full safety gear and diluted to 50-100mg/ml strength for use in mixing.

Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,radiodog,1 point,Mon May 11 09:32:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, read the actual report that came out later and not the news line hypes.   The kid drank an unknown amount of 100mg/ml nic base that was left uncapped while the parents were looking in boxes for a remote.   If you get 100mg nic on your skin you need to wash immediately and will get the spins, if it's in your eye go to a doctor.   Please stop spreading misinformation, and do more digging than biased new line hype stories. There has been lots of research done in Europe about the ingestion of eliquid, and they now classify its toxicity as similar to any warning label household cleaners."
Canadian_ecigarette,35jfcz,Vatigu,0,Mon May 11 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm not looking for fights, I'm just rather amused at your position.  No one disputes that high doses of nicotine will make you sick/dead. The issue is that there's a pretty huge difference in dosage between getting splatters in the face-hole VS chugging a bottle of fluid. Even accounting for the sizable difference between of mass between a 1 year old and an adult, even at the highest doses it is pretty damn unlikely that one would get anywhere NEAR a dangerous dose of nicotine due to said splatters.  I find it interesting that you state a person's lungs are "" biologically capable of handling this kind of stress "", yet a stomach that can handle all manner of stuff that one eats cannot deal with a squirt of nicotine fluid.  Hence my whole point about oral membranes. It's not hitting the stomach, it's being absorbed well before then...  And yeah, you're right. My PG link was pretty useless. I can't recall why I added that. Sorry about that one."

On the other hand though, it's still a quite solid 80w device with a lot of battery capacity.

Canadian_ecigarette,35itzk,Farlek,1 point,Sun May 10 20:13:44 2015 UTC,I can't really speak to the ceramic wicking coils as I have never used them. I do know that some people complain of blue sky being a bit of a coil killer. It's a pretty sweet juice and cotton is a bit of a slippery slope with it. I have vaped blue sky in a dripper as well as my subtank and each time I found that when I use a little less cotton - it doesn't seem to gunk up. I've literally gone for days without rewicking blue sky and the cotton is still nice and clean. The trial and error period with it determined (for me at least) that less cotton is better for it. Since the cotton pre built coils are pretty dense and typically don't fluctuate in the amount of cotton I suspect they may be more prone to clogging with sweeter juices or those with LOTS of flavor additive in them. I have also heard that the added blue coloring could have a role to play in this as well.

When something is super popular then it makes sense that we hear about it when things go bad. Even the survey done on the istick showed that more than approximately 70% of owners experienced no issue whatsoever. I suspect that the m80 is the next one in the spotlight simply because it is very popular as well.

It's just that they generally have some of the better prices out there and I keep going back.  Doesn't help that they've been sweden post regularly now too and tracking rarely gets updated."
Canadian_ecigarette,35ijtl,neveroutgunned,0,Wed May 13 20:41:14 2015 UTC,Eciggity is having a sale the 12th probably worth waiting and ordering from them. Works out cheaper and you'll also get it way faster. https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/35g8eg/eciggitys_customer_appreciation_sale/
Canadian_ecigarette,35ijtl,Hubatola,1 point,Sun May 10 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"While I can't say I check them out a lot, I have never found their pricing that competitive. Once you add on US exchange rate, it's a total deal breaker for me - even at 25% off. Or am I missing something??"
Canadian_ecigarette,35ijtl,cashman187,1 point,Sun May 10 22:15:06 2015 UTC,eciggity is way overpriced with exchange rate and -25% + the 20$usd shipping its way more expensive
Canadian_ecigarette,35ijtl,MaddogBC,1 point,Sun May 10 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, paid for an authentic from them a few months back. last cross border order until the exchange comes down. was hefty..."
Canadian_ecigarette,35ijtl,karmapopsicle,1 point,Sun May 10 22:49:52 2015 UTC,"A while back when they had Canada shipping at $9.50 they were worth ordering from during some sales. I picked up a Sigelei 100w Plus on Black Friday for $101.45CAD after exchange rate and shipping.   Now that they've switched to the $20 priority shipping as the only option to Canada though, generally it's not worth buying through them. Seems to be a relatively common tactic for American vendors who don't really want to ship to Canada though. I've seen rates as high as $50!"
Canadian_ecigarette,35ibay,bubbzie,2,Sun May 10 17:32:10 2015 UTC,%70 VG will be fine.
Canadian_ecigarette,35ibay,adzsask,2,Sun May 10 17:49:51 2015 UTC,70-80. It really all depends on how you vape. Chaining may present an issue after 6-7 steady puffs of high VG but sub ohm coils are getting better every day when it comes to wicking. I personally use the RBA deck in my subtank for high and max VG juices and never have an issue.
Canadian_ecigarette,35ibay,RobertDF902,2,Sun May 10 18:11:25 2015 UTC,My arctic runs a max vg with no problems on the hits the only issues is that it overheats like crazy
Canadian_ecigarette,35ibay,Elneto,2,Mon May 11 01:55:48 2015 UTC,I met someone last night who runs 90vg in their herakles with no issues at all. I'm sold
Canadian_ecigarette,35ibay,NATEMCWN,2,Mon May 11 16:04:30 2015 UTC,I've run 100% vg in most of my setups for a long time and never had issues people talke about.   I even ran 100vg in my Nautalis with my adv and only a close to dry hit wen it was cold out.   These new sub ohm tanks can handle 100 no problem if setup correctly and not running like 40+ watts. Except for the subtank mini unless wicked right.
Canadian_ecigarette,35ibay,HomoeroticDog,1 point,Mon May 11 17:52:25 2015 UTC,I run Max VG DIY juice in my Herakles an have never gotten a dry hit even when I went up to 100 watts

Canadian_ecigarette,35ibay,XxMegatr0nxX,1 point,Mon May 11 17:23:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info guys. I figured around 70 would be fine. That's what I run in my subtank with next no issues
Canadian_ecigarette,35i5wo,CraveeJuice,2,Sun May 10 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"IIRC they use ethyl alcohol-based flavors so as to not have to use PG in their juices. They market the juices as 100% organic VG when in actuality it's probably more like 60% VG, 30% distilled water, and 10% flavoring.  I placed a small order after posting a question about them a while back. I asked what the public opinion on them was and they got absolutely PANNED. I ordered some anyway since taste as we all know is subjective. I ordered creamsicle which was the single most highly rated juice on their site - and even after months of aging and breathing, it still tastes like orange-glo furniture polish.  I really hope they can get a good product offering going since I really want to see Canadian companies thrive, because right now I have no intentions of ordering from them again."

Canadian_ecigarette,35fly4,sansaset,2,Sat May 9 22:15:06 2015 UTC,I also didn't take too many notes on the first 30mls I burned through and the new bottle I got needs some more steeping time before I get full flavor again haha

I saw nothing in the bill that banned the sale of nic base, flavorings or hardware in Ontario or otherwise.  B&M's were not ordered to shut down, cats and dogs won't start living together... no hysteria.  The parts that prohibit displays in stores and basically treating ecigs like tobacco totally sucks but it won't stop people from buying ecig products entirely.

Canadian_ecigarette,35ckhf,turkourjurbs,1 point,Sat May 9 12:56:26 2015 UTC,It was more to do with banning the sales of the flavouring in the juice as it appeals to younger people that I was worried about.

As you can see, the legislation was composed without any genuine understanding of what vaping is, what the components are, etc. It is basically a stab-in-the-dark attempt at covering all their bases.   That portion (#8, Flavoured electronic cigarettes) to me seems as though it was thrown in just so the word ""flavour"" would be in there somewhere in an attempt to tie it in with HESA's proposed regulatory framework, which includes the suggestion that flavours that appeal to kids should be banned."

Canadian_ecigarette,35cu41,raisedbytuttles,1 point,Sat May 9 02:12:22 2015 UTC,"I received the wrong coils from Vapor North. I emailed them and they sent out the proper ones the same day. They even threw in a free 30ml bottle of vanilla custard. I asked for a shipping label to send the other coils back and they said to keep them or pass them on, so that's what I'll do.   It's 2 5-pack aspire BVC replacement coils. I'm not sure what they'll fit in as I have the Nautilus Mini and they're too small for it. One of the coils has been removed from its blister pack but not used and put back as soon as I realized it was too small.   If you'd like them, just pay the shipping and they're yours.   Also, I highly recommend shopping with Vapor North. I've enjoyed all of their juices that I've tried and their customer service is fantastic."

There is no conspiracy here. They deal with millions of packages day with a ppm defect rate of ~4000.  You were unlucky. The post code or bar code (depending on where it was in the supply chain was difficult to read. The error was fixed manually when it was out for delivery and redirected to your local delivery center.  Addendum: Canada post just kinda sucks. They are more concerned with profit than delivering a decent product. Discriminating against a vendor without specific legislation in place is not a wise business decision. They don't do it. I'm not trying to defend Canada post, but we should at least get upset at them over genuine concerns (price, delivery time, quality of service, customer service, reduced level of service)"

Canadian_ecigarette,35bwjl,unfortunateleader,1 point,Sat May 9 08:10:35 2015 UTC,Probably got picked up by the wrong carrier due to similar address on their route. Usually the route number is clearly labelled on the delivery label. Mistakes happen though. Sometimes packages get sent to the wrong depot and have to be sent back to the proper depot. Happens all the time with packages of all types. Once a package is in the Canada post system they don't care what it is. Only time a postal carrier cares is when it poses a risk to deliver it such as A) powdery substances outside the package  B) strong smells like weed or gas  C) liquid leaking out or saturating the package D) ticking like a bomb or clock  Source: ex carrier

Canadian_ecigarette,357z3y,Jack_Lad,3,Fri May 8 04:41:23 2015 UTC,"Now that's service!  The vendor I bought my first one from (a fairly well known vendor, I think) asked me to send it back to him so he can take it apart and see if he can fix it.  That's just not acceptable IMHO.  What's he think he is, some kind of authorized iStick repair center or something?  I just said screw it and accepted my losses.  I bought a second one (from eciggity, a much better vendor) before the onslaught of failed iStick posts.  Thankfully I must have gotten the mythical second batch because this one is working fine so far...  Too bad there's so many problems because other than some minor or gripes, it really is the perfect size, shape and power for me."

Canadian_ecigarette,357gj3,ilikeycoffee,1 point,Thu May 7 21:19:19 2015 UTC,"yeah, nope. Recent stats show that all three levels of govt (fed, prov, municipal) profit about $800-$1500 a year minimum from a 1-2 pack a day smoker; calculating tax income vs their added costs to the health care system. And this was using HC's own published numbers, which you can bet are heavily biased towards max costs associated with smokers.   Do you think our governments would operate their cigarette tax monopoly at a loss? ;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,357gj3,Kuwshi,1 point,Fri May 8 00:48:46 2015 UTC,I would like to see this study.
Canadian_ecigarette,357gj3,ilikeycoffee,1 point,Fri May 8 01:41:58 2015 UTC,it's not a study. It's economic fact. Google is your friend.
Canadian_ecigarette,357gj3,ilikeycoffee,1 point,Fri May 8 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"edit, I did the googling for you (though I read this info thoroughly in 2013). Smokers cost entire health care system, absenteeism, UI, anything the govts pay extra for, $14.2billion (and dropping) each year, as of 2012.  Estimated revenue from all tobacco taxes in all three levels of govt, 2013 is just a hair under $20billion. Proof https://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/31122/1/Norouzi_Mahta_2014_researchpaper.pdf  Considering the costs a smoker ""costs"" our govts has not changed much in last three years, but the feds, provinces etc have all raised tobacco taxes quite a bit since 2012 (fed $4/carton recently, Ontario same) the 2015 number is probably closer to $22billion. A 1 pack a day smoker paying $12 a pack is contributing $9 to federal, provincial and municipal coffers, every day. That's $3,285, just in taxes paid. Avg smoker cost all of us (via govt payouts) $2,500 a year. You should thank the next smoker you see for paying some of your taxes. Then help them quit with vaping."

Canadian_ecigarette,356rn8,Flavourcrafters-Tony,2,Thu May 7 16:01:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for your compliments. We owe everything to the vaping community and would love to hear about your reviews of all of our new flavours!
Canadian_ecigarette,356rn8,Hubatola,2,Thu May 7 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks Tony. I know you got a bit of heat on here last week for this not being an official ""Reddit"" giveaway.   But what you guys have done is simply amazing! The amount of free juice you have put into the hands of Canadian vapors is absolutely incredible. Can't wait to tackle my mail man tomorrow :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,356rn8,konkatenate,2,Thu May 7 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"All sides measure 6.5"".. and it did come with my regular mail. Hopefully it does! I've dripped 5 flavours so far and out of the 5 I'm leaving two to steep. Date Night and Melon Dramatic are my favourites so far."
Canadian_ecigarette,356rn8,konkatenate,2,Thu May 7 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for measuring! It looks like I am SOL unless they try to deliver directly, my mailbox is 15” high x 5” wide x 6” deep... so it won't fit :(. edit: really looking forward to Date Night and Melon Dramatic ... and Tiger Tailz..."

Also, in case anyone else is wondering, they said on fb: 3mg testers were mailed by XpressPost Tuesday night, the 6mg, and 12mg samples were mailed by XpressPost Wednesday night, and finally the 0mg and 18mg samples are leaving by XpressPost today."

Sadly, she can't use 2 of the flavours, because peanut allergy, so I might snag them off her to see if 3mg is enough for me after being so used to 12. Should also be arriving tomorrow!"

Canadian_ecigarette,35563u,dicktoronto,1 point,Thu May 7 14:11:08 2015 UTC,Also strongly recommend the VCT Pro tank :) Equal airflow but can take the GCT nickel coils ;)  Enjoy the new hardware!

Canadian_ecigarette,35563u,eastcoastvape,1 point,Thu May 7 16:10:26 2015 UTC,So far I can only go to 50 watts since I only have an istick 50 but I tried it at 70 watts with an IPV4 and its still a cool vape not too warm. I can't wait to buy a new box that can actually handle the 0.3 ohm coils
Canadian_ecigarette,35563u,eastcoastvape,1 point,Thu May 7 17:45:10 2015 UTC,Lots are coming out for that purpose!
Canadian_ecigarette,35563u,karmapopsicle,1 point,Thu May 7 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"Not a fan personally, but I know a few people who are in love with it.   I think they made a mistake stuffing a single 22ga coil into the 0.3ohm heads, as you really have to pound them with wattage to get them singing. On the other hand, if they had gone with a parallel 24/26ga coil they could have kept the resistance while significantly lowering ramp time.   I do think the 1.0ohm heads are very solid though, especially for anyone with an original Atlantis. If I were going to use one though I'd probably be using either a V1 or V2 base with the 5ml tank extension and the 1.0ohm heads. I can't stand the silly wide tip they went with, and the capacity is a bit of a joke."
Canadian_ecigarette,35563u,ExitMusic_,1 point,Fri May 8 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"Just got one the other day myself and while there are a few cons, I generally love it. Holy mother of airflow. But the capacity is just blegh without the extender ( which I do have on my OG Atlantis)  I already had an original Atlantis and wanted to get another sub tank so I could swap out flavors as I wanted. I was having trouble deciding between the Atlantis2 and one of the Kangers. The convenience of only having to buy one pack of coils at a time won..."

Tell me how you pay for shipping and it's free to the the first low income/beginner to the making your own coils and it's yours. Not moving to quicly so be very specific on how you pay for shipping.

Canadian_ecigarette,3551gz,zolofftt,2,Thu May 7 19:20:42 2015 UTC,That's awesome! We too vaped it forward by giving a friend our old kit. Few Vivi Nova tanks and some batteries we'd outgrown that were still good. Plus some good juice that we had left according to his tastes.
Canadian_ecigarette,3551gz,unfortunateleader,2,Thu May 7 05:45:04 2015 UTC,"Right on, I just gave my istick 30w away and once my goblin shows up I'll be giving away my melo as well :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,3551gz,vi0lent,2,Thu May 7 22:06:51 2015 UTC,Jfc $100?! I got my evod kit online for $50 with free shipping.   The best part about vaping is giving things to friends to help them to quit smoking. I plan on doing this once I get a new set up.
Canadian_ecigarette,3551gz,vi0lent,1 point,Thu May 7 23:16:41 2015 UTC,Yea I was really not impressed.   Can't believe people still pull stuff like that.
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Mauledbyaseal,5,Thu May 7 02:06:47 2015 UTC,ive yet to visit my local shop (sir vape-a-lot) as i get most my juice from Evaperated. I would have gone in to buy some kanthal from them but i can't justify buying 1m of kanthal for $1.50. Maybe i will check them out if they get the lemo 2 in at a good price.  I have how ever checked out dashvapes and the vapeshore in toronto. Both are AMAZING shops with great gear and juice. I highly recommend visiting them both
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,reed89,4,Thu May 7 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are in the city, go see Ron at Clear Sky Vapes (621 Somerset West) instead. Best service in the city, tons of premium juice at quite low cost (most of it is $17/30ml, some stuff like the imported American stuff is a little more), and just a nice place to hang out.  There's vapemeets there about every second Saturday too. Join 'Ottawa Vapers' on Facebook to find out when various events are!"
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,karmapopsicle,2,Thu May 7 09:36:09 2015 UTC,thanks for the tip :)
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,reed89,2,Thu May 7 16:11:01 2015 UTC,I had a tough time swallowing 20 bucks+ for 30'. That's freakin outrageous.
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,MaddogBC,5,Thu May 7 14:31:51 2015 UTC,"/u/dashvapes and /u/vapersonbloor in Toronto.  My two go-to shops.  Edit: I guess I should say why I love them.  They both have great staff and an easy atmosphere.  Vapers carries two brands I really like, Moshi and Velvet Cloud.  Dash carries Bombies and Kilo.  I really love hanging out in both shops.  10/10 would recommend both to anyone."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,sorennordstrom,3,Thu May 7 03:19:39 2015 UTC,The folks at Canada E-juice in Oshawa have always treated me very well. Their prices are fair (in my opinion) and they have the product selection that I'm after.
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Woodguy2012,2,Thu May 7 02:28:41 2015 UTC,Thank you for the kind words :)
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,CanadaE-juice,1 point,Thu May 7 21:36:43 2015 UTC,They make the best goddamn tobaccos on the planet
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,entity2,3,Thu May 7 05:07:53 2015 UTC,Clouds boutique in Vancouver.  Very helpful and great guys that work there with a great juice bar! And if you wanna try a flavor that isn't out they will drip some on their rig for you.  Juice isn't cheap but it's quality.  I am in love with jazzy boba.
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,waitwhet,2,Thu May 7 07:41:32 2015 UTC,"Think I'm gonna head there on Sunday, broke as shit, but I'd like to see what they're all about.  From their FB page it looks like an amazingly nice store."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,waitwhet,3,Thu May 7 07:43:46 2015 UTC,Yea I had no intentions of buying anything but I did....  It's just a nice place to talk vape and try juice.   I didn't feel pressured at all which is number one for me.  Let me know what you think!
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Power5lide,1 point,Thu May 7 07:53:22 2015 UTC,"I've been there and wasn't to stoked about their prices (juice and hardware). They're definitely one of the more expensive places around. My go to is EastSide Vapes on Kingsway. Decent prices on hardware and their juice selection is the best around, no question. Friendly atmosphere as well. They stock Lloyd's Typhoon which is hands down the best juice I've ever had."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,majorvapes,2,Fri May 8 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"Love these guys too bad I'm in Ontario! And that Jazzy Boba is amazing!  Edit: I recently did a review of their shop and I don't think it got the love it deserved, too many haters downvoting. Oh well."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,vi0lent,1 point,Thu May 7 11:15:21 2015 UTC,Damn I was just in Vancouver (saw Sleater Kinney) but didn't get a chance to check out any vape shops.
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,siixer,3,Thu May 7 23:18:48 2015 UTC,"Blue Vapes in West Kelowna. Their juice and prices are excellent, and their owner is a great guy. If anyone lives in the area I absolutely recommend checking them out. They just opened up last month and have been great since day one.  $8 for a 10ml, $13 for 30ft of kanthal, etc. They have the best prices I've seen in the Okanagan and I strongly suggest trying their Max VG Strawberry Custard its incredible. They're active on Facebook and you can order their stuff online at www.bluevapes.net  I make the drive from Vernon to Westbank almost every week simply because of how welcoming and awesome they are."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,MaddogBC,3,Thu May 7 08:52:16 2015 UTC,"I live and work in Westbank and have never heard of these guys. That spot is one of the most hidden spots for retail in town I bet. Didn't even know there was stores there.   Thanks, I'll pop in."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,siixer,2,Thu May 7 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"They have a really odd location, but they use the parking lot for bbq's and other events occasionally. :) tell Dillon that Alex says hi!"
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,MaddogBC,2,Thu May 7 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"He knew who u were as soon as I mentioned Vernon.  They seem like a great bunch, just getting started. Certainly my new favourite B&M. Have some 30 ml bottles steeping. Wish they had 10ml for their house juice. Seemed a little sweet on first impressions. My first taste of a UM clone, pretty stoked.  They certainly seem to ""get"" the culture and the importance of being smart about the hobby. Was very happy to hear about some social events, I've been pushing Valley Vapors towards that for months.  But that location... Man I've turned my RV around there a few times so I knew exactly where google maps was pointing...Still had to peer around like a tourist to find their hiding spot. I understand retail is stupid to rent in this town, but they have zero exposure and failed to attract my notice as an avid enthusiast. They are really going to struggle to bring in the amateurs and the noobs where all the money is. /shrug"
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,siixer,1 point,Fri May 8 05:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah their location is quite a well kept secret, but everyone needs to do their part! I've been in the process of helping them get their juice line into a couple stores in the area, and doing as much as I can to get people to check them out. I have a buddy that works at petro around the Glenmore area that's getting word around too, so I have faith that they will gain a following. :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,vi0lent,3,Fri May 8 07:43:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I live in Kamloops so I need more shops in BC to order from."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,zolofftt,2,Thu May 7 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"Vapeurs de L'Ouest has been by far the best shop. (Vaudreuil-Dorion, QC) We are always going in with questions and concerns and they are patient and help us every time! I've yet to check out any of them in downtown MTL."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,ZorroElite,2,Thu May 7 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"I actually have visited a lot of shops around the GTA... and like them all for different reasons.  Rather than list them all... here's the one I went to today:  TheVapeshore.com - located on Lakeshore near the Longbranch GO station in Etobicoke.    Their 'house' line of juices comes in 30ml glass dripper bottles... and also in 120ml plastic bottles.  They are easily comparable to 'premium' US brands, and only $16 for 30ml.  (I challenge you to find a difference between their 'End of the Bowl' and ANML's Looper.)  Today I stopped in and didn't have much time.  I went primarily to grab 120ml of End of the Bowl.  The guy working the store told me they unfortunately didn't have any pre-mixed at my nic level and asked if I'd be okay with taking 4x30ml at the same price as the 120ml.  I said absolutely... and he threw in a 5th bottle as well.  Awesome!"
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Naiser_,1 point,Thu May 7 04:55:16 2015 UTC,"Seems like there are a shit load of awesome shops in the GTA, too bad I'm on the other end of the country.

And on payday I planned on getting some End Of The Bowl as well as a couple of the Captain Oliver's."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Naiser_,2,Thu May 7 05:04:31 2015 UTC,Captain Oliver's Gibbon's Grog and Rumrunner are my absolute favourite from their line! (Edit: spelling on bad keyboard)
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Naiser_,1 point,Thu May 7 05:21:06 2015 UTC,Tried Gibbon's and Admiral Cavendash from a buddy and grabbed half a tank of each during the day.  Was gonna buy them this pay period but my car had issues I needed to fix.  Getting worried because all I have is 1/3 bottle of Cupapeech and 1/4 bottle of Vanilla Sin.  Might have to go whore myself out for vape money :p

Sounds good, but I've heard mixed things about lemon vapes."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,ZorroElite,2,Thu May 7 06:38:01 2015 UTC,"I've tried it, yeah, and it's decent. All of Cpt. Oliver's is, for sure. But the Gibbon's and Rumrunner are ones I want to buy 120mLs in, and I never say that about juice, usually. Some people like tart lemon, some prefer sweet, and I find that the lemon custard is a bit muted, but still a good vape, nonetheless. I'm actually going to a party tomorrow hosted by the guys who distribute Captain Oliver's."

It's a bit out of the way, but the local place that sells them may be able to hook me up for a fee."

Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Jordinary23,2,Thu May 7 05:06:23 2015 UTC,"My B&M is Kick Ash Vapes.  When I first got an e-cig, I bought an ego battery with some shitty cartridge-tank-things that leaked like crazy from some website I found. I went back to smoking for a bit because I was pissed I spent $100 on a leaky pain in the ass. I saved up another $100 and went to Kick Ash to buy ""a new e-cig."" I had no idea what I was looking for.  Foolishly enough, I didn't bring my shitty vape with me, but the guy behind the counter had me look at a couple of batteries in order to figure out whether my battery had eGo threads. (It did.) He recommended I buy an iClear 16 for $8 because it would work fine with my battery. (It did.)  I had no idea what I was doing, no idea what I was looking for, and I went there with the intention of spending $100 on a whole new setup. Rather than make the big sale, the guy helped me out and saved me a ton of money. Now I buy 95% of my vape stuff there. Definitely a great way to earn repeat customers."

Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Sliparoon,3,Thu May 7 05:22:18 2015 UTC,I've been hearing about a Hamilton store since last year.  I hope it opens soon.
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,iama_newredditor,2,Thu May 7 09:44:24 2015 UTC,"Where I am, there's certainly a lot of them, all things considered. I have yet to visit at least 3 of them, if not more, but of the ones I've visited here in Hamilton and even in Burlington, they're usually pretty good. The last few times I went out and about to visit them people were definitely off their game, but generally they do very well. So, to Sovereign E-Cig Lounge, Crown Vapor Boutique and The Vapor Bar, kudos! You guys are great at what you do!"
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,midelus,2,Thu May 7 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"Vaporbar is nice, the hardware is a bit too pricey for me, but CoCo the owner is great so I like going there. Sovereign didn't really win me over, one of those places I felt like I was bothering them, couldn't stop working on a coil build to properly greet me or assist. Nice enough guys though once you got past that. Haven't been to Crown yet but realized I'm very close so I'll stop by soon."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,deltrisej,2,Thu May 7 11:57:35 2015 UTC,"PonyBoy isn't bad, but the juice is crazy expensive (22$ for 30ml). It is really, really good juice though, so I usually buy a bottle and double it with some VG. Makes the juice even better in my opinion, lasts me waaaaaaay longer too. Win-win."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,mind_circus,2,Thu May 7 07:38:21 2015 UTC,"I go to Digital Vapor in Surrey, these guys are pretty cool, always helped when I had questions, and I've sent a few people there way they helped get started as well...pretty laid back there. I'm not there often, but I've enjoyed each visit...I always miss their Sunday vape meets, darn work....ah well, but that's the place I support locally, trying different websites here and there...mainly looking for big orders at decent prices here lately..."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,MarioVapes,2,Thu May 7 09:41:49 2015 UTC,I was going to go there today but they don't open until 11 and we were leaving town at 10:30.
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Ykram13,2,Thu May 7 23:35:11 2015 UTC,In St. John's and surrounding area there are apparently 5-6 B&Ms... I have never seen anything listed about them and they appear to have no online presence. Can I just show online love instead?
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,neroth,2,Thu May 7 11:40:36 2015 UTC,"Avalon Vapor just opened a B & M, they have a website (avalonvapor.com) and a FB page (which seems to get updated more than the website).  Anyway, I'm a big fan of their juice."
Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,theferrousarchive,2,Thu May 7 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"I am a large fan of my local Planet of the Vapes, I like their reasonably priced juices (50mls for $20, with a double flavour shot), and I really like their customer service.    I got a co-worker to start vaping a while back and sent him there.   They sold him the Evod 2 kit, and that's all he wanted.  He started using juice that is a known tank-cracker and he moved up to a Mini-Protank 3, then moved up to a Vision Spinner battery.  After one day of using the Spinner the damn thing died on him after 4 hours of vaping (should have lasted 1-1.5 days with the amount he vapes) so he went back in to ask for store credit to move up the the IPOW 2, they just swapped it out.    This is the third or fourth time I've heard that kind of story (happened to me as well) and I really respect that kind of service, to the point where I'll do my purchasing there for a bit more money because I like it.   Lots of love to the people there, Brett, Eric, Pam, Karina, and Rachelle.  Good people, great service, pretty good prices.  (No I do not work there)"

Railway City Vapes is great for gear/mods and juice like darkside creations, they are now starting to get in Captain olivers, TJC, and a new one called Toque ( how canadian of us)  A shop in london ontario i would reccomend anyone go to is the vaper store. They are a great bunch of guys have really good ejuice for normal canadian costs. They have a tester bar, bring your dripper and try any juice at any nic lvl. They helped me make my first coil and a great place to hang out."

Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,Winter_knights,3,Thu May 7 02:29:34 2015 UTC,"That was not the experience I had when I went in there. They carry some decent juice, and I was hoping for a bit of recommendations, but the place felt a bit grubby and there were some dudes dripping pretty aggressively in there, and the guy behind the counter just seemed to rush me out. Wasn't impressed and I was really hoping for a reliable b&m to impulse buy at. Ah well, reddit's always pointing me in the right directions anyway."

Canadian_ecigarette,354oxy,vi0lent,1 point,Thu May 7 06:59:35 2015 UTC,"Living just outside of Vancouver there are a lot of vape shops quite close, but my local go-to is called Burnaby Vapes.  Small shop, awesome people, decent price on surprisingly good tasting house juice.  I went in when my iStick 30w just had a complete freak out and just wouldn't turn on, Got me set up with an IPV Mini2 and battery for a decent discount.  Gear prices aren't super cheap, but they have helped me figure out where to start on each foot of my vaping journey, from my EVOD2 to my IPV and Mephisto."
Canadian_ecigarette,355pwy,ilikeycoffee,2,Thu May 7 09:35:01 2015 UTC,"Ouch... I'm definitely going to give TC a shot when my IPV4 eventually comes in, but if I find it as annoying as you have, I guess I'll go back to Kanthal.  I wrap micro coils almost exclusively... It's pretty hard to mess those up.  Really, I just wanted a 2 battery mod ;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,355pwy,iCat3GS,2,Thu May 7 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"In my experience, I guess I have had a lot of good luck with my TC builds for my DNA 40   Running a lemo drop at .17 and a goblin running at .1    Temp set to 410, no burnt hits to date.  Resistances jump around +/- 0.02 ohms, but nothing burnt or underpowered.  A thing to keep in mind is how much wick you're using in your builds.  If both tanks have been sitting for a while and the wick is saturated the first hits are amazing.  The Lemo drop I built a 3.0 mm coil and basically it's me that can't keep up with the amount of vape it produces.  With the goblin and its small build deck, currently I have dual 2.4 mm coils.  Hits just as good on the first 3-4 hits or so then TC steps in quick after that.  There is less wick so it'll dry faster and TC kicks in waaay sooner than in the lemo drop.  Building with nickel and using TC is a bit of a hassle but totally worth it right now."
Canadian_ecigarette,355pwy,reoshinjuki,2,Thu May 7 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"But even when it works... it flutters. Hard to describe, but what's going on is the rDNA40 is constantly adjusting wattage to keep the coil at your set temperature (which may or may not be the real temperature, but that's secondary). The vapor draw is fluttery because of this - almost like an up and down pulse.   The reason for this is that to put it simply, you're using the technology wrong. As Evolv has said time and time again, what they do is temperature limiting, not temperature control. The reason for this is exactly what you're describing.   When you're running a nickel build, you should never be hitting your temp limit under normal vaping conditions. The only time it should be hitting the limit is when your stop drawing, or the wicks run dry, or whatever abnormal condition is happening.  If you're constantly hitting temp limit there are a few things you can do: lower your wattage, increase airflow, improve wicking, or raise temp. If those solutions cause your vape to be too cool or otherwise unsatisfactory, the best solution is to rebuild with more surface area.    When I do this, the Evolv chip is always supposed to pop up the message ""new coil? Y/N"" message (which the rDNA uses to recalculate the resistance vs temp algorithm); but sometimes, it doesn't do that.   I believe if the device has been left sitting without an atty, it won't ask when you put a new one on since there is no 'same atty' data to re-load. If it doesn't ask, that means it assumes it's a new atty being attached.    The problem is, if that build is anything other than perfect (spaced coils, coil locked completely rigid and unmoving into the posts) your temp control is like a roller coaster. It's not just a problem with RDA/RTAs either. I've noticed my OCC Kanger Nickel coils (factory ones) jumping around a few 0.01's on the ohm reading throughout the day.   Slight resistance changes throughout the day like that are normal on the DNA40 board. This is due to the refinement feature Evolv implemented, which kicks in after the device has been idle for a period of time. It sends small pulses to the atty to more accurately measure the resting resistance."

If those solutions cause your vape to be too cool or otherwise unsatisfactory, the best solution is to rebuild with more surface area.   Se this is where I completely agree with Phil Bursardo. It's too complicated, too finicky and dependent on weird variables. Phil questioned why even have wattage control when in temp control mode on the evolv boards; he said ""I know why they included it"" (faster heat up times for people who want to hit their heat target right away) but the devices should just go into a ""we'll set the wattage since you set the temperature"" and leave that option off the table.  Temp control has a ways to go, IMO."
Canadian_ecigarette,355pwy,karmapopsicle,1 point,Fri May 8 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"Again, not temp control, temp limiting. That's why we still have wattage. The original concept behind the technology was to find a way to limit the formation of harmful compounds that can come from high coil temperatures.   The temp you set is not a target, it's a limit. That's why I never refer to temperature limiting devices as ""temp control"", because the use of that term has cause a huge number of people to misunderstand the whole point behind the technology."

I just wanted to warn that if you're using a carto-tank (which are typically plastic), Pom Pomme might damage it. It contains some cinnamon which can break down common plastics used in tanks. I can't confirm it just yet, I'm doing tank-cracking tests this week, but it'll be up on the site later in the week. In the interim, I suggest using a cartomizer on its own, a glass/pyrex tank, or a steel atomizer instead for Pom Pomme. If I were to hazard a guess, I'd say it doesn't crack tanks, since it contains less cinnamon than other flavors which also don't, but just to be careful."

Passing smokers in public and finding out how I used to smell...  The gradual disappearance of my cough...  The day I realized I could take a deep breath without a rattle/cough...  The gradual lightening in colour of the matter ejected from my lungs until that stopped completely...  The ease through which I was able to transition to lower nic levels...

Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,Jadall7,2,Thu May 7 02:25:30 2015 UTC,"You'll need a dry herb vaporizer for leafs.  And an oil vaporizer for hash or oils. You could probably make your own extract for regular ecig juice, but I doubt you'd want to invest the time and money on learning how to make a natural extract.   There's lots that'll fit a regular EVOD battery. I can't remember but I think this was the Canadian sub. If so, canvape had a large selection of dry herb stuff. Snoop doggs vape pen sucks so don't get fooled."

Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,ml_canadavapes,2,Fri May 8 00:31:08 2015 UTC,You can get different tanks for oil extracts or dry herb but there are some great vaporizers out there specifically for marijuana. I own an Arizer Solo myself and love the thing. Its for dry herb and you only need .1 of a gram each session. 1 session is good enough to get me nice and stoned. The price of it has paid for itself with the amount I save on weed. I have heard great things about others such as the PAX as well.
Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,GTAWisSweet,-1,Thu May 7 00:19:39 2015 UTC,Do you think this lot is good enough to try weed vape? It includes everything except grinder to try the process?  May be some cheaper option or Canadian vendors one could find on eBay?  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Titan-2-II-Hebe-Portable-Dry-Kit-with-Temperature-Control-New-Complete-Kit-/251949795397?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3aa960c845

Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,deathdragon5858,-1,Thu May 7 16:53:20 2015 UTC,Honestly the cheap ones are cheap for a reason. I've tried other peoples cheaper weed vapes and the quality just isn't there. I never heard this brand before so I googled it to read some reviews and most of them are quite negative. You should head over to /r/vaporents or even do a bit of research yourself to pick one that suits your exact wants and needs.
Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,GTAWisSweet,-1,Thu May 7 03:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I asked the question there  But could you tell me, that kit got everything I need to try the weed vape?"

Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,deathdragon5858,0,Fri May 8 00:34:00 2015 UTC,"The systems recommended there are hundreds of dollars, titan 2 is about as cheap as it gets. People swear by the expensive ones and bash the titan 2, but I am not sure if a lot of it isn't snobbery, like the people that only buy high end authentics and piss on clones. The titan kit on FT, all you have to do is charge it, break up the weed and pack it. No clue if the ones on ebay would be the same.  Oh,I can't speak on the more expensive ones, but the titan2 you can still smell it's pot. Not as strong as if you were smoking it, but anyone that know's what pot smells like will know it lol."
Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,TheVaporist,0,Thu May 7 03:40:38 2015 UTC,Thank you! This fully answers my question.
Canadian_ecigarette,354al1,deathdragon5858,0,Thu May 7 03:47:57 2015 UTC,Its really the same thing for my solo as well. You can still smell it. I have this thing called a smokebuddy that I bought and its a filter you blow into. It takes away the vapor and smell fairly well.   The main difference between the cheap ones and the more expensive vapes is the smoothness of the vapor. I like to be able to take long lung hits and with the cheaper ones its hard to do. Ive also had a couple cheaper ones in the past where they have broken. Just speaking from experience

Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,nitelifedj,6,Tue May 5 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"Give it time. If you only quit smoking 3 weeks ago, your sense of smell and taste will take some time to come back. Some say it happens in days. For me it took a while.   When you vape a flavor too much, you can get vapors tongue. You know when you wear a cologne and can't smell it anymore? Well the flavor in vaping has a lot to do with your sense of smell. It's the same thing. You have to switch it up.  If you don't like a flavor, let it sit (that's called steeping). Don't throw it out. Flavors can get better (or worse) over time. Also, if you get sick and your sinuses are blocked, you won't be able to taste anything. That's the time to vape the flavor you least like. Only throw out liquid if its been sitting for over a year.  Lastly, don't give up. I smoked for about 20 years. I am an EXTREMELY picky eater and went through the same thing as you. Tried a flavor at the store, got home and it didn't taste the same. I found that letting flavors steep helps. Remember, vapeshops want you to taste the BEST flavor, so they let their samples steep. Lowering your nic also helps. I'm STILL going to any vapeshop I can to try new flavors.    I don't have an ""all day vape"". I have an ""all day medley"". I leave for work every morning and take 3 different bottles minimum. Some I vape more than others, but I can never vape 1 flavor all day.  Once gain, don't give up!"

Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,majorgooseturd,2,Wed May 6 01:52:26 2015 UTC,Vapor North has some fantastic premium juices. Sea Captain and Tigers Blood could easily be my ADV
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,sansaset,1 point,Wed May 6 00:55:39 2015 UTC,"I could use both these as my ADV's aswell i love them both, but at the same time not everyone would agree with us we just have similar tastes alot of my friends do not care for either."
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,TSmashVapes,1 point,Wed May 6 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Vapor North. Great prices and really good juice.  Their 15ml 5 pack is affordable and you'll be able to sample a few different juices. Even if you don't find an ADV (unlikely, their flavors kick ass) the juice won't be sitting there to rot. You'll definitely finish each bottle even if it's not exactly what you were looking for.  Otherwise I recommend hitting up some B&Ms with testers. Dash has a lot of flavors to choose from and you can sample pretty much every single one of them."
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,Robbie-R,2,Thu May 7 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"The struggle is real. I also carry a few tanks around all day. I've only found a few that I can vape all day. And that's work day. By evening, I need something else. Sadly I have buckets of stuff I don't like or still can't taste properly, but I have to vape them cause...money. I started with one tobacco bottle and never again. I've got a Naultilus and only go 8-10w.  My favourites:  NYX milk and honey (ADV for sure) Juicy peach Vapor North Monkey Paw, pink lemonade, Lullaby, L'Anse Amour Evaperated Patient Zero Vaporist Funky Monkey  I figure, as not good tasting as most of what I have, it's still not a cigarette...good luck to you!  Edit: I quit two months ago and just recently started tasting better. If you're 3 weeks in, it might just be that. Smoked for over 25 years so i figure it will take some time to heal?"
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,TSmashVapes,1 point,Wed May 6 01:15:58 2015 UTC,Try getting a bottle of unflavored Juice and mix it with the Juice's you don't like. Diluting the flavor of some of my Juices made them tolerable.
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,Robbie-R,1 point,Wed May 6 01:20:39 2015 UTC,You think? It won't be just air with a slight hint of something? Or is that the point? I have some MBV that I wouldn't mind turning into air lol.
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,TSmashVapes,1 point,Wed May 6 01:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yes it is ""just air with a hint of something""  that whats great about it. If you have a bunch of juice you don't like it dilutes them to the point they are tolerable. It does not improve their flavor, its just less of the flavor you don't like."

Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,TSmashVapes,1 point,Wed May 6 01:43:54 2015 UTC,If you try it just mix a little bit of each in your tank. Like 1ml of each. Just enough to get your coil saturated. There is no point in mixing more if you still don't like it.
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,Robbie-R,1 point,Wed May 6 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"True, good plan. I'd love to have a meet up/juice swap lol, but not a single vaper lives near me. Or I've never seen a single person vape around here."

Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,evaperated,2,Wed May 6 04:25:04 2015 UTC,"Like many others who have commented, I have multiple tanks, all containing different flavors, one Kanger Emow mega (my favorite by far), 2 Aspire ET's and 3 Aspire K1 Glassomizers. I usually have one stronger (24 mg) nic tobacco flavor for when the cravings hit hard, one minty flavor (Frosty's Breath from Evaporated), 2 dessert flavors and one or two fruit flavors  going at a time, when one bores me I switch to another. Other than the nic flavor I've been doing 12 mg so far. What floats my boat one day seems to lose it's appeal in a few days so I am continually changing it up. That is the nice thing about having some cheaper tanks for trying out new flavors a little at a time. I have 30 different flavors of e-juice at present (about 1/2 of those I consider pretty good, 1/4 unvapeable and 1/4 so-so) and have more on order... As of last Friday I have not smoked a cigarette for one month and counting so I guess my method is working for me. Best of luck to you :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,entity2,2,Wed May 6 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to speak as a vaper and consumer here and not a vendor as I had a completely similar experience to you when I started vaping and I was beyond frustrated.    I was trying all kinds of flavors from fruits to cakes to tobaccos.  I could not find one I could stand all day, and I REALLY wanted a 'go to' flavor because I had just quit smoking and needed something that was my 'friend' like cigs were.  Part of that frustration is actually what got me started on making juice.  I found some I liked but they were too rich or too muted or too this or too that.  I found a couple of flavors from Flavour Crafters that I loved, and could vape all day for the most part, but most flavors do gunk up clearo coils pretty fast.  My current all day vape, and has been my ADV for a year and a half, is Frosty's Breath.  It's subtle enough that it doesn't make me sick to my stomach if I vape a lot.  It's got that 'cold' feel and a slight mintyness that keeps my tongue from getting vaper's tongue.  And it's got a bit of sweet to it to make it pleasant.  This allows me to use heavy flavors in my sub style tanks which tend to handle richer flavors better.  multiple setup styles can help (regular clearos, sub style tanks etc) so that you can have a variety."
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,frnzy,2,Wed May 6 02:31:55 2015 UTC,"I wasn't impressed with Juicy Ejuice's tobaccos. Like you, their cherry tobacco seemed alright in the test unit in the B&M, but once nicotine was added and it was put on a better mod, it's got an undesireable taste.  That said, their chocolates and coffees are quite good. I'm not a huge fan of the candy flavors, but their vanilla cappuccino is to die for, and something I could use all day.  For tobaccos, I'm an enormous fan of Darkside Creations' Coffin Nails, and Canada Ejuice's Royal Oak. It should be noted that no tobacco is going to taste like a cigarette (which was my original intent to find) just due to how a cigarette's flavor is made by burning things.  And you're going to find that as time goes on, flavors change as your tongue and nose correct themselves. I liked an RY4 when I'd just quit smoking, but as my shit cleared up, I've found it doesn't taste that good anymore and the sweeter/minty flavors are more my thing."
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,deathdragon5858,2,Wed May 6 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"If you have any B&M's near you with a dripping bar: I recommend you pick up an RDA to go with your mvp3, build a single coil and taste the various juice they offer."
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,Robbie-R,2,Wed May 6 16:19:28 2015 UTC,"The only juices I don't get sick of after a few puffs is strong mints.   http://vapewild.com/ice-cold-e-juice/  That's the one I use now, I usually have 2 or three older tanks with sweet or fruit juices, and my main tank is a K1 filled with that minty goodness.   I tried east coast vapes, like 5 juices, I had the same experience. Love their customer service and attitudes, their juice just tastes mediciny to me. So far only found a few juices that were OK besides the minty one, I am going to start making my own this summer, even with cheap juices, it gets expensive for me to vape lol."
Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,Hubatola,1 point,Thu May 7 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"So far the ONLY juice I have found that I can vape for days, and not get sick of is Maven Liquids ""Canadian Tobacco"" Its a tobacco based juice with a hint of maple syrup and vanilla. I have been vaping it for 2 weeks solid and still love it. I also tried Maven Liquids ""NX Light"", its similar to the Canadian Tobacco, but a little sweeter. I plan on picking up a bottle of it this week.  Another good one is ""Oh My Custard"" from Toronto Juice Co.  So far those are the only juice's I have found that I really like. I also have a collection of Juice's that tasted great in the Vape Shop but I hate after 30 minutes at home."

Most places sell it for $24.99. Even Maven Liquids sell it for $24.99 on their website. I have no Idea how vapemeet can sell it for less than Maven."

Tried tons of menthols/mints (because I was a menthol smoker), discovered I didn't much like them either. Right now I'm just having fun trying a little bit of everything, although I do wish juice makers were a bit more clear about the flavour notes - anything licorice, absinthe, wintergreen or rootbeer is completely wasted on me."

Canadian_ecigarette,34zvm1,dienah13,1 point,Wed May 6 01:15:02 2015 UTC,"As far as juices are concerned, I always recommend Evaperated and Vapor North. Evaperated's Blue sky bitch is a coil gunker, it will kill your coil fast, which explains the color and muted taste. This also means youll have to replace your atomiser more often, which was likely your issue.  I have never tried Mana biscuit, but your problem might be your atomiser spitting. Higher PG juices are prone to more spitting, and moving to a 50/50 blend could help in that regards.  I would also recommend you Vapor North. Monkey Paw and Grand Beach are my personnal favorites. Monkey Paw makes a great ADV, while Grand Beach is a very summerish vape.  You could also check out Dash Vapes, who carry a few popular american brands like Bombies and Mt Baker Vapor. Id personally recommend you the infamous Bombies' Nana Cream.  Finally there's always the option to go down the DIY route. Since I started myself, Ive never bought a bottle again. Of course its a bit more trouble in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it its pretty simple and fun. You can find lots of good recipes on /r/diy_ejuice , aswell as a lot of information to get you started.  Good luck in your search!  Edit: Forget the idea of the one ADV, chances are youll never find it. Instead, look for a few mixes you enjoy, and switch regularly. Taste as much juices as possible and youll find a few you like. And even if you adore a flavor, vaping it for a few days straight will bore you out of it. Keep them on rotation!"

I've got about ten bottles of juice behind me on my side table. Got like three to four tanks filled up with various juices and I'm switching between them. Got Vape Mail ""in transit"" with a bunch of new juices coming.   What are your fave candies or snacks? Do you like a certain soft drink? A certain Popsicle? A favourite mint? Switch it up. Have fun with it. As an ex smoker myself I did the tobacco flavours at first to. After about a month I just found them disgusting. I work in retail and when a smoker comes in now it just smells disgusting. I took a drag of a smoke the other day and wow I can't believe I enjoyed smoking that shit for 18 years. Sorry for the tangent but maybe it's time to give up on the tobacco type juice and have some fun. There's so many vendors on here. You've joined a great community. Plenty of them have deals they advertise on here."

You might be like me, just a little picky and still discovering other great juices. Think of it more as an adventure than a struggle.  I do feel though in my own experience, building my own coils and wicking my own stuff gives me a better flavour and richer experience. I only use a Lemo for my Jedi Slayer, and a Goblin for my Looper. But the weird thing was ... When I switched the juices into the opposite tanks, it tasted terrible. I can't explain why, but it did.

Canadian_ecigarette,34zeah,greenbud420,3,Tue May 5 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"This worries me the most. The last thing I want when quitting smoking is tobacco flavor. How is this not common sense?   The bill extends the scope of the Act by considering electronic cigarettes to be tobacco and sets rules for tobacco use in certain places, in particular by determining standards for outdoor smoking shelters.  Standards applicable to the tobacco trade are tightened by, among other things, prohibiting the retail sale or distribution of tobacco products having a flavour or aroma other than that of tobacco"
Canadian_ecigarette,34zeah,Sidelia,5,Tue May 5 23:29:55 2015 UTC,"CTV news says this about it:   ...The bill seeks to prohibit the sale of all tobacco products having a flavour or aroma, including menthol cigarettes and cigarillos. Electronic cigarettes are exempt because they're used by smokers seeking to end their addiction. ""I do not want to take away the opportunity for people to use this product to quit smoking,"" said Charlebois, herself an ex-smoker...  I hope that's correct.   edit: ok so at home now and actually had a chance to read more then the preamble. It's correct.  Heres the actual:   The Act is amended by inserting the following sections after section 29.1:   “29.2. It is prohibited to sell, offer for sale or distribute a tobacco product that has a flavour or aroma other than that of tobacco, including a menthol, fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa flavour or aroma, or whose packaging suggests it is such a product.  “29.3.

They need to clear up that grey zone imo before implementing any legislations regarding ecigs
Canadian_ecigarette,34zeah,samzorio,1 point,Wed May 6 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"This happened in Nova Scotia, now they can't sell non-tobacco flavours, as well they banned flavoured tobacco."
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,rocksteadymachine,5,Wed May 6 01:19:48 2015 UTC,"order without the food coloring, it'll still gunk up quickly but maybe you'll get an extra day out of it or something.  people acting like this is unique to evaperated juice are wrong. any sweet juice will gunk up your coils.  try looper in your RTA and see what happens."
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,sansaset,8,Wed May 6 15:34:22 2015 UTC,Honestly i had to stop using their juices because they were killing my coils fast
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,dpetes123,4,Wed May 6 02:41:57 2015 UTC,Fairly certain it's the added sweetener

Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,iKyNeverEnds,3,Wed May 6 01:24:15 2015 UTC,Every evaperated juice I've used has destroyed my sub tank occ coils. They last like 2 days before burnt taste. A shame really.

Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,anxdiety,1 point,Wed May 6 12:25:25 2015 UTC,I just read a mixed review on it so I'm not holding my breath. Here you go.
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,frnzy,2,Wed May 6 12:33:13 2015 UTC,One thing with Evaperated's line is that a lot of the juices will taste drastically different based on your setup.
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,mind_circus,1 point,Wed May 6 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"Very true. Between dripper and tank, every one of my evaperated juices have tasted different."
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,javagnome,3,Wed May 6 23:23:22 2015 UTC,"I have not had that issue with the various flavours from evaperated in max vg. I tend to change my wick every 2 days or so. Dripping on 24g kanthal, 3mm ~.3ohms."
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,dingus_mcginty,3,Wed May 6 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"Had a bottle of BSB using my usual .35 dual coil 24g build on my Plume Veil. No issues at all.   That said I do dry burn my coils, rinse them and rewick every 4-5 days.   It was pretty decent juice."
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,lilfunky1,2,Wed May 6 19:57:13 2015 UTC,Did you have the blue food colouring added to it? I'm pretty sure I've read that food colouring has that affect on coils. I didn't get the added colouring and I've never had that issue with it.
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,dingus_mcginty,0,Wed May 6 01:33:07 2015 UTC,I did ask to have the colouring added. The plot thickens.....
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,lilfunky1,4,Wed May 6 01:47:40 2015 UTC,Why would you want food coloring added?
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,AnarchoElk,1 point,Wed May 6 04:13:49 2015 UTC,Just wanted to try something new.
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,abacacus,0,Wed May 6 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"Why would you want food coloring added?    Because it looks cool!  (I haven't actually ordered any BSB yet but I'm 95% sure I'll say ""yes"" to the food colouring.)"
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,MaddogBC,3,Wed May 6 15:12:48 2015 UTC,Uhh... I mean ya i kind of feel like I'm taking crazy pills here with you  both actually wanting an additive that 1.does nothing to the flavor 2. Gunks up coils (any juice that is darker in colour especially with a food coloring additive will have this effect) 3. Introduces more useless compounds to inhale. Not trying to be a dick or anything but it just seems really weird to me
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,tet5uo,4,Wed May 6 15:24:55 2015 UTC,I agree with all of your points on why food colouring isn't a great idea.  But sometimes childish glee for a novelty item beats out adult logic and reasoning.
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,nitelifedj,1 point,Wed May 6 16:09:27 2015 UTC,I noveltied so hard. My shipment with a turbo clone just passed customs. I'mma be revving up my turbine until people beat me half to death over the noise.

Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,evaperated,3,Thu May 7 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"Why add chemicals to your juice that aren't needed?  It does nothing for the flavor, and it adds extra gunk to mess up your wicks and coils.   You're better off without color."
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,abacacus,2,Wed May 6 15:29:56 2015 UTC,Darn. I just ordered two 30ml bottles too :(
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,evaperated,2,Wed May 6 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"All of the juice I've got from them gunks up coils really quickly. If it weren't for rebuilding I'd have had to stop ordering from them long ago. Their juice tastes really good, but it has its drawbacks."
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,abacacus,2,Wed May 6 14:31:44 2015 UTC,Shit. I just spent money I technically don't even have on a variety pack from them and won't have enough money to replace my coils for a while in the subtank I also bought with money I don't have. If this happens to me I'm totally fucked.
Canadian_ecigarette,350bw1,evaperated,3,Thu May 7 06:28:33 2015 UTC,"We use a lot of flavor in our juices which is why they can be coil haters.  A lot of our juice doesn't have sweetener in it, so I would say it's more that our flavors are rich.  I have a lot of customers that have no complaints, and others do.  I find, personally, Aspire coils do way better than Kanger coils, but the Nautilus coils are exempt from this rule as any juice I've thrown in my Nauti tanks that has a lot of flavor tends to not be able to handle it (my line, and others)"

Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,btcfun,2,Tue May 5 22:29:40 2015 UTC,Look for a local soap making supply store. Get your vg / pg around $5/L (or less if you buy by the gallon).
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Wed May 6 04:29:07 2015 UTC,i wont order from walmart... there a a few Canadian DIY sites that sell heaps of it.
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,Vendeta44,1 point,Wed May 6 00:44:35 2015 UTC,why get it from walmart when diy-ejuice sells 4liters for 40$?
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,Vendeta44,1 point,Wed May 6 01:43:54 2015 UTC,cuz i dont need 4L :)  how much do they sell 500ml for?
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,Vendeta44,1 point,Wed May 6 02:28:34 2015 UTC,14$
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Wed May 6 02:31:31 2015 UTC,see that's $4 more + the shipping costs. Although if at some point i can't get PG at shoppers (which won't surprise me eventually) I might just load up and buy 4L and be set for 2 years :P
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,br4d24,6,Wed May 6 02:52:08 2015 UTC,a liter is only 5$ more at diy ejuice. Plus instead of supporting a faceless multibagillion dollar corporation that abuses its employees and suppliers you are supporting a local Canadian owned and operated business within the vape industry. That alone to me is worth it.
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,00Dan,2,Wed May 6 02:57:32 2015 UTC,So nice to see that someone else cares about this issue more than they care about saving $5. Have an upvote.

Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,CuBu,1 point,Wed May 6 05:43:02 2015 UTC,In Nova Scotia I get mine from PharmaSave.  Shoppers wouldn't order it for me.  Approx $10-$12 for 500ml of VG or PG.
Canadian_ecigarette,34zrua,ilikeycoffee,1 point,Wed May 6 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"but you've ordered 500 7-8 times :) shelf life is 2 years, probably still good after that to be honest that's just shelf life. and you're paying about twice the cost getting 500ml"

Canadian_ecigarette,34z0vz,Adolph_Bernanke,2,Wed May 6 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, and I hate saying this, don't order from within canada. Everyone is expensive here.   Check out various US vendors and wait for a sale. I used ecigexpress at x-mas and it was about 80% cheaper than if I had bought the stuff here in Canada. (mind you they had an x-mas sale, but even their regular prices are about 40-50% cheaper).   If you are using flavour apprentice, ordering directly from them is crazy cheap. visit /r/diy_ejuice I think they have info in their sidebar. Or just ask folks where they get it.   As long as you aren't ordering nic base, flavourings go through customs with no problem."
Canadian_ecigarette,34z0vz,joekerr37,2,Tue May 5 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, DIY-Ejuice is da bomb.  Unfortunately, they do not sell nicotine. I recently reviewed a few vendors and will be reviewing at least one more very soon."

I've tried several hundred different coils and always come back to the zipper coil. IMO claptons go through more juice and have less flavour than the zipper.

Canadian_ecigarette,34xr7z,OntariEnt,0,Tue May 5 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't, i might give it a shot here soon. It smells delicious though."
Canadian_ecigarette,34xr7z,OntariEnt,0,Tue May 5 17:27:28 2015 UTC,It's definitely sour. You can feel the sour in your throat after you vape it. It's pretty great
Canadian_ecigarette,34y642,lilfunky1,2,Tue May 5 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"Go for authentic name brand VV/VW mods.  For mechs and RBAs, clones are fine, just read the reviews and forum to make sure it's a decent knockoff."
Canadian_ecigarette,34y642,kaje,1 point,Tue May 5 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"Some RBTA (Billow and Silverplay) are good and ~40$ cheap authentic, *(have a 15$ SP clone that works but is poorly built-threads worn/posts funky but is still a daily driver).   Certain high wattage box mods I'd stick to authentic (My Sigelei 100w has seen many drops and is still trucking along)  But for mosfet box mods / Mechs, I still stick to 1:1 or Value added clones - like fixing the throw on an otherwise perfect button (My SMPL clone mech).  It's always best to do a little research first despite how shiny that new item is."
Canadian_ecigarette,34y642,CubeXombi,1 point,Tue May 5 16:05:30 2015 UTC,I've bought Vision Spinner batteries from FastTech and I honestly don't think you need to purchase authentic. I've tested the batteries and they are the correct voltage.   Definitely your replacement attys are fine purchasing whatever. Never had any issues with them.

Canadian_ecigarette,34y642,unfortunateleader,1 point,Tue May 5 19:27:54 2015 UTC,"I've bought both Mini Subtank and Nautilus Mini clones from Fasttech.  The Mini ST is a 100% reproduction and I can no longer tell the difference between the clone and the original. Even the packaging was identical with all components as the original included. Flawless!  The Nautilus Mini was great starting, and performed great out of the box, until I had to change the coil. A new coil will not fit properly inside the chimney. So it has become essentially useless.  TLDR: 50/50"
Canadian_ecigarette,34y642,Hubatola,1 point,Tue May 5 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"Always try to go for 1:1 clones - and from what I've heard ""black box/packaging"" clones are of higher quality because they are (from what I've heard) infinity or sxk clones."

Canadian_ecigarette,34xz39,limewire_,3,Tue May 5 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"They could stop using the red coloring, imo. It adds nothing to the flavor and wrecks coils, not to mention the questions regarding inhaling red#40.   Lorann watermelon is the obvious flavor they're using in there, due to the color and you can request it without coloring if you're getting it in bulk quantities.   I don't think they'd sell less of it if it was clear in color."
Canadian_ecigarette,34xz39,tet5uo,2,Tue May 5 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is really good, he recently changed up the recipe though I honestly liked the older version better, a bit more creamy.  The new version I'm almost 100% sure the recipe uses Lorann Watermelon flavoring. I did some DIY stuff earlier in the year and created a flavor that tasted spot-on like king's cream with lorann watermelon and TFA sweet strawberry + a hint of vanilla custard, even had the exact same deep pinkish reddish coloring. I wish I saved the exact recipe but I stopped DIY cause it's tedious  EDIT: lol looks like it is lorann flavoring, I didn't see the post above until after I posted"

Canadian_ecigarette,34xrzs,evaperated,1 point,Tue May 5 13:49:51 2015 UTC,It's okay. I vaped some of the custard one. The others I find them too high on VG and the vape just becomes too thick and you get that oozy feeling down your throat really fast. And the taste is amazing but too much to mix it with other juices.
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,elitexero,4,Tue May 5 07:52:33 2015 UTC,I just won one of those Flavor Crafters giveaways and one of their new evolve juices is apparently sour.  After I get it and try it out I'll let you know how it is!

Anyways my favorite is called smurf juice/sour black raspberry. I don't know if it's sour enough. I more consider it a ""dryer"" taste like dry vs wet wines etc."
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,Jadall7,2,Wed May 6 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"If you haven't tried Pez Off from Evaporated, it's got that tart flavour. I love it, tastes like pez candy or sweet tarts."
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,Drfacialphd,2,Tue May 5 09:20:23 2015 UTC,"Is it a flat tart similar to the candy's powder taste?  Not sure if I'd like that - looking for something more citrus-y.  Nothing to kill the lungs, but something like eating a grapefruit or even a lemon.  I think I'm walking a fine line..."
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,Drfacialphd,2,Tue May 5 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really does have the candy side more then anything. But it does have a some citrus under tones"
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,setzRFD,2,Tue May 5 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"+1 to Pez Off. It's both sweet and sour, more sweet to me personally. I dilute it down 10-15% because it's a bit much, but I don't generally like sweet flavors to begin with."

Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,SoftSell89,1 point,Sat May 9 06:06:39 2015 UTC,Just picked some up today as well.  I'm vaping it at 50W (they recommend vaping over 50W for some reason) and it has a very slight sour taste. either way really nice juice at the price!
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,Robbie-R,1 point,Sun May 10 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"I upped it to 40 cautiously since I'm using a Subtank and didn't feel like playing dry hit roulette.  You're right, the flavors are more pronounced.  On a side note, are you using the OCC coils on your subtank mini or do you use the RDA deck?  The reason I ask is because I have a subtank mini as well and I typically keep it to 17-20W to avoid inhaling what I can only describe as vape hell.  It seems to happen after I rebuild and go through a full tank - once I re-fill nothing wicks properly."
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,Winter_knights,1 point,Sun May 10 03:37:48 2015 UTC,"I have to update that, I'm mainly using my Cthulhu RTA now with a .3 build @ 50ish watts.   With my subtank I accidentally threw out my RBA so I've been running the .5 (lol never are actually .5 it seems) OCC coils either 22W or 24W. It's an 80vg juice so I won't even bother trying to vape it in my subtank since like you said, it probably won't wick properly and I'll just have a bunch of devil hits.  definitely try to build a lower resistance coil if you can because for whatever reason it tastes awesome at 50+ watts"
Canadian_ecigarette,34x413,D3adkl0wn,1 point,Sun May 10 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"See now I was sold on a Youde Goblin and was about to order and now I'm looking at the Cthulhu.  Based on your dry hit experiences with the subtank, has the Cthulhu ever given you any trouble?  I'm just sick of dry hits and inhaling burned cotton."

Canadian_ecigarette,34wiiy,bubbzie,2,Tue May 5 09:19:11 2015 UTC,"I spoke to Joel from Flavour Crafters yesterday. He said between the contest and show giveaways, over 400 boxes will be shipped out - 400! And sending by Express Post.  By my math that's almost 300,000 milliliters of FREE juice delivered to people's houses. (400 X 20 X 35 ml's). Absolutely incredible!"

I like a lot of their regular line's flavours because of the stronger flavour, which I'm always a fan of, so I can't wait to see what they have in store for this line. Too bad I'm a 12mg myself, requiring more steeping time, or else I'd be sharing the juice."

Canadian_ecigarette,34vxub,Aaronvapes,2,Tue May 5 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"SW Ontario checking in. I'm a MASSIVE fan of SZVapor's lineup. Every single juice I've tried has been exceptionally well-made. The stuff is artisan-quality. Before this line, I thought nobody made a decent cheesecake flavour. I never thought I'd vape something that actually tastes like butter tarts. I couldn't vape banana flavours. And on and on. This brand really raised the bar, for me. /u/setzRFD is a master of his craft. Spectacular juice, spectacular customer service, spectacular prices...I can't say enough good about SZVapor.  Ponyboy Vapes redefined the term ""house brand"" for me. It was my first vaping experience, and I have been feeling spoiled ever since. Little did I know I was vaping some of the best juice I'd ever vape in those first few bottles...and I haven't managed to make it back to the shop for more yet. Fortunately for us, their line is now available online at JGVapes. /u/PonyboyVapes and /u/JGVapes are some of the best guys in the business...you're guaranteed superb customer service and an excellent vape.   Between these two lines (and other Canadian brands), I contend that Canada has juice that could go toe to toe with any premium juice from anywhere else in the world. I've vaped a few other solid Canadian brands, but these ones stand out to me in terms of selection, quality, consistency and value.   Also, I'm looking forward to trying out Flavour Crafters' new high-VG line ""Evolve"" when it launches."
Canadian_ecigarette,34vxub,kkeeiiggaann,2,Tue May 5 04:28:54 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting on some stuff from SZ Vapor but I like what I've heard so far.  I'm in Montreal, QC.  I can't recommend Flavour Crafters enough. I'm also in love with Fusion Flavors but I think that they only offer their stuff in stores."

Canadian_ecigarette,34vxub,RobertDF902,2,Tue May 5 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Bang for buck I don't think anyone can beat /u/EastCoastVape and Stormborn by them must be tried by all vapors in my opinion.   /u/VaporNorth has a great premium line, my favourites being Tigers blood and Sea Captain, also lullaby by VN is really good  My /u/evaperated order is on it's way, I've heard great things but I'm really skeptical if it's just a ongoing trend or if it's really that good. Kinda pricy but does have a good deal where if you spend 35$ before taxes and shipping you get a free 30ml once per week. Also have been said to gunk coils a fair bit. And very sweet.   /u/Canada-ejuice was my first online buys a couple were good, but lacked real standout flavours, like they have done well making things like gingerbread, ry4, cinnamon hearts, things like that but I'd like to see them expand into developing their own brands and flavours. I've ran across a few of their flavours I really don't like and are sitting mostly full in a cabinet. They really should develop some premium stuff.   There are many other quality vendors I havnt had the chance to try yet, but am looking forward to getting my hands on all different kinda of juices. If you look through my submitted post history I've done reviews on all my juice orders since joining this subreddit."
Canadian_ecigarette,34vxub,CuBu,5,Tue May 5 13:30:31 2015 UTC,"Can never say enough good things about evaperated. Widely regarded in this community as the best ejuice in Canada. Seriously, I have yet to get a juice from her that I don't like.  I've developed a particular liking for the cheesecake based flavours from SZ Vapor, lemonlight and Cobblestone cream. I haven't tried them all, but every one I've tried is good.  I really like the selection of various brands from Dashvapes. Their in house brand is pretty awesome, especially wonderland and St. Cherry De Ha-Ha.  I recently got the collection sampler from The Vaporist and I have only tried the grape escape, and funky monkey so far. Both fantastic!  Vapor North has a great selection, their premium line is also pretty special. (Monkey Paw and Tigers Blood in particular)  I haven't ordered from Canadaejuice in a while but that's only because I only ever ordered the RY4 Double from them, and that's when I was first starting out and only wanted tobacco flavours. It was IMO the best RY4 available.  Hopefully some more people comment as I'm sure I've missed some honorable mentions.  I prefer high VG blends and these vendors all offer various PG/VG ratios so it's nice to have that selection. I've tried quite a few different Canadian brands and these ones really stand out for me!"
Canadian_ecigarette,34vxub,RobertDF902,1 point,Tue May 5 00:45:54 2015 UTC,Damn good advice right here. I would certainly put in my vote for Evaperated being at the top of an impressive list. I have my first order from SZVapor on it's way because he's a close second.   I'm in BC

All the PL flavours I've tasted were not worth dripping ever again. I've read positive things about Dr Fog a few times now but only tried one flavour.

It tastes exactly like the name suggests.  A sweet apple pie with vanilla and a hint of cinnamon. It also smells amazing. A lot of my non-vaping coworkers have given positive comments. It's quite sweet though, so it may not be for everyone."

I've got picky taste, and don't like many profiles, but these two impress again and again. I'll admit of the stuff I've had between them, less than half are personal ADVs, but a couple here and there standout as some of my personal favorites.  Evaperated Alpha Blood is one of my favorite flavors bar-none. Her Hannibal Nectar is also excellent. If you go with Evaperated, I'd give those two a nice look. Vapemeet's Twist and Morning Glory are also swell."

Use code: REDDIT for 15% off your online order and try them out!  http://reduxvapers.com/collections/redux-originals I also have been vaping for over two years and my serious all day vape is Pearl Necklace from Funksauce - I can't go a day without it! I'm really diggin Coco Moloko from Kubrick because he got the chocolate just right!  I am all for Canadian vendors and am proud to call them my friends - its good to know where your juice is coming from! I just ordered from Flavorsnobz and got the Splode and Carney Breakfast - just sayin but when you market your juice in 120ml bottles it better be damn tasty - and its beyond tasty! Hopefully you don't mind me posting as a vaper instead of a vendor - it is a fine line but I am a huge supporter of all Canadian vapers :)

Canadian_ecigarette,34vxub,karmapopsicle,2,Tue May 5 12:45:07 2015 UTC,When was the last time you bought it? At this point all new Juice by Kubrick and Retro Juice Works juices are produced by a contracted juice production lab. Previous to that he would blend large batches of the flavouring concentrates and ship them off to a different lab that would mix them down and package them. And previous to that (before he was in stores) he was mixing and bottling everything himself.  I can assure you that the stuff coming out of his current manufacturing lab is very good - the nic is as clean as it gets.

This gent was nice enough to share his recipes on here about a month ago and I saved his post. http://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/306ild/vape_mail_customejuiceca/  I ordered versions of Nana Cream, Honey Pearry, Placid and Astro.

Canadian_ecigarette,34ve2u,Winter_knights,3,Mon May 4 21:46:00 2015 UTC,I believe it is from heated sugars on your coil discoloring the wick and leaking back into your tank.

Canadian_ecigarette,34ve2u,CuBu,2,Mon May 4 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"Their juices use a lot of sweeteners and flavoring as well as that one having food coloring in it.   It's gotta be a coil-killer. He's seeing the coil residues washing back into the tank, I agree."
Canadian_ecigarette,34ve2u,tet5uo,1 point,Mon May 4 22:13:47 2015 UTC,It most certainly is a coil killer. Every 10-15ml of the magic sauce that is Evaperated's juices I need to rewick. BSB is most certainly at the top of the list of coil gunkers.
Canadian_ecigarette,34ve2u,anxdiety,1 point,Tue May 5 07:10:39 2015 UTC,It's the wick for sure. BSB is pretty rich and gunks up a bit at high temp. I tend not to go above 4.0v (regardless of coil resistance) as high temp for it isn't necessary.

Dashvapes does use different nic than MBV, but it is good nic nonetheless (they link to the supplier on their site, if I'm not mistaken). Perhaps you had gotten a bad batch, a lot of things in this industry are open for human error. I found Dashvapes has excellent customer service, however, so if your batch seems off, try giving them a shout."

I really like dashvapes for their community involvement, initiatives, helpfulness, and everything a good B&M should be.   However the adding nic later really bugs me, and I've had inconsistent results. Nic needs time to steep with everything else, and when I'm buying premium juices I want to be able to vape it asap. It's rad though that I can get some juices Id never want to gamble on getting across the border, which is why I get a bottle from them here and there to support their other good works."

Canadian_ecigarette,34wi7s,WhiteRussian13,0,Wed May 6 02:32:23 2015 UTC,Dude do not get mt baker at dash vapes!! Trust me i got mbv at dash vapes first time and it tasted like shit. What they do is buy mbv extract flavours and mix that shit in house in the back its bullshit! I got an order for juice direct from mbv and it is GREAT!! That is why i dont go to dash vapes anymore fuck their house juice it taste like shit. Get it from the source and u will be happy.
Canadian_ecigarette,34wi7s,Pardoz,7,Tue May 5 04:42:31 2015 UTC,There are good reasons for this - juice containing nic can get seized at the border.  Importing extract and adding nic on site just makes good sense for vendors.
Canadian_ecigarette,34wi7s,MaddogBC,3,Tue May 5 05:29:11 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with doing it like this. It's a widely accepted practice in the business. Coolvape does the same thing and does it well. I haven't tried anything from dashvape yet.
Canadian_ecigarette,34wi7s,WhiteRussian13,-5,Tue May 5 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"Ok...well from MY experience it seems like its a shady practice  especially  if u dont mention this fact and cut corners. This is why it shows in the juice u buy. I dont care who else does this im just saying that dash vapes does what they do bad. And this is coming from some1 who tried both... so i dont even  know why ur defending them, and clearly im not the only one that was dissapointed with their ""mbv"" juuce"
Canadian_ecigarette,34wi7s,WhiteRussian13,2,Tue May 5 05:21:41 2015 UTC,Ps. I took my friend to dash vapes to get his first setup there.

Anything you order online is mixed and then shipped to you. Do you think MBV is doing anything different other than adding nicotine to their flavours? Sometimes juice just needs to steep.

Canadian_ecigarette,34tyb2,dienah13,3,Mon May 4 15:18:27 2015 UTC,Agree with /u/dotvapes  You can live without it right up until you have it.  I got my temperature control device a few weeks ago and LOVE it.  Handcheck!  http://imgur.com/86JZr0y  I still run both temp control and normal in part just to have flavour options without juggling tanks.
Canadian_ecigarette,34tyb2,ZorroElite,2,Mon May 4 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yes they are, you can really dial in the flavour, coils seem to stay cleaner and you never get dry hits or burn cotton."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tyb2,frnzy,2,Mon May 4 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't used another device since I got my vaporshark,  I run temp control 95% of the time.  It's worth it."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tyb2,eetbum,2,Mon May 4 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's one of those ignorance is bliss things though, in my opinion. Once you use a dripper with it, or a tank with it, you get used to it :) It's a luxury. having the same pull, same flavour, every time. No dry hits, cleaner coils etc. Also as mentioned before you can really dial in your flavour. Set your peak temperature depending on the flavour you are using and desire, really really cool to be able to do that :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,34tyb2,dotvapes,2,Mon May 4 17:29:20 2015 UTC,since i got my dna 40 smogbox i have barely touched my ipv mini. Once you get used to dealing with the ni200 wire it is amazing
Canadian_ecigarette,34tyb2,reed89,2,Mon May 4 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"For me, it's kind of hit and miss. I have a Vaporshark rDNA40, I use Kanger Subtanks (with the temp control blue-ring OCC coils), and a Plume Veil 1.5 on it.  When it works, you won't get a burnt hit at all, and you can dial up or down the heat from the vapor. But even when it works... it flutters. Hard to describe, but what's going on is the rDNA40 is constantly adjusting wattage to keep the coil at your set temperature (which may or may not be the real temperature, but that's secondary). The vapor draw is fluttery because of this - almost like an up and down pulse.   It's been hit and miss though. I've followed directions and made sure my device was unused for at least 1/2 hour or longer before swapping rigs - going from the Subtank to the Plume Veil for example. Sometimes, I get the ""new coil? Y/N"" message (which the rDNA uses to recalculate the resistance vs temp algorithm) sometimes I don't. When I don't, anything could happen - I could get barely a wiff of vapor, or overheated vapor.   But even when I do get that question, choose yes, and fire away, say at 400F set, I could get barely a wiff of vapor production, or overheated (or just right - it's a crapshoot).  Also, you have to be REALLY REALLY REALLY good at wrapping coils and have REALLY REALLY REALLY good RDAs (perfect mount screws with flat bottoms etc) to make RDAs work. The nickel wire is very soft, must be a loose coil design (gaps between the wraps), and locked in super tight to the RDA's mounting screws, which means you run the fine line of cutting the wire, or having it too loose. If that wire is moving in any way, shape or form in the mounts, your temp control is like a roller coaster.  This tech has a long, long long way to go. The current methods envisioned by Yihi and Evolv (they both do it slightly differently, but along the same lines) ain't working universally (ie foolproof) well."

Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,Vendeta44,1 point,Mon May 4 15:56:36 2015 UTC,I'm thinking bi-weekly RDA/mech clone orders will be a part of my life once I start getting paid.
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,abacacus,3,Mon May 4 18:36:19 2015 UTC,Yea if they say authentic they are fast tech has no problems selling clones and telling you they are. I would put a battery on a separate order just in case
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,eastcoastfog,3,Mon May 4 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"Hello /u/lilfunky1, Yeah, if fasttech says something is authentic, it is. The subtanks on there are, etc etc.  Usually if it is a clone it will say something like "" _____ Style RTA/DRA""  Cheers,  DTV_John"
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,dotvapes,1 point,Mon May 4 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"Um, I'm pretty sure kanger tech and aspire have both said fasttech does in fact NOT carry their authentic products."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,bongafied,2,Fri May 8 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Fasttech orders them in a very large bulk and keeps a small margin, relying on sale quantity for profit. Their kanger products are real. I have bought one previously (not a subtank) and confirmed the authenticity slip."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,dotvapes,1 point,Fri May 8 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"Ill have to try this myself, I just dont see how two ""authentic"" products can differ in quality so much."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,bongafied,1 point,Fri May 8 19:49:35 2015 UTC,have you bought one of the authentic kanger products from fasttech? They have kanger styled ones and real ones :)
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,dotvapes,3,Fri May 8 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"Fasttech is a legitimate company.   If they say it's authentic then it's authentic. If it's ""styled"" then it's a clone. Nowadays they carry clones from a few popular companies too. So if it's says it's SKX then it was made by SKX.  Their customer service is amazing. I always get quick replies, and any problem I've ever had were dealt with to my satisfaction. I had to return a Magma once, I just shipped it to their warehouse in Miami and they refunded me for the shipping + product. I'm sure they'll be very helpful if you have any issues with it.   Don't order a battery from them if you can't wait for it. My friend's MVP2 (which has a lipo battery) took 70 days to get to Toronto. Like everyone said order it separately and go with the free shipping option. DO get the paid epacket upgrade for the rest of your stuff. The quickest I've received a package was 9 business days.  FT has been my go to hardware place for a year now lol. Last time I got 18650s were  from Viper Vapor and Illumination Supply."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,SirTimmyTimbit,2,Mon May 4 22:24:46 2015 UTC,"batteries definitely should go in a seperate order.  I would suggest trying the new option for shipping batteries Sweden Post Airmail.  I used the Hong Kong post surface mail option and it took 60 days to get to me. If it's a mod with a built-in battery though, the battery shipping restrictions don't apply (more shipping options) and you can use what comfortable with."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,dennistein,1 point,Mon May 4 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"If it's a mod with a built-in battery though, the battery shipping restrictions don't apply (more shipping options) and you can use what comfortable with.   Ooh.  Yeah everything I'm interested in buying has the batteries built in.  So that might speed things up.  I'll probably still order separately (cuz why not) to make sure hubby isn't waiting any longer than necessary for a bigger fancier shmancier tank."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,Winter_knights,1 point,Mon May 4 14:58:56 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that anything with batteries is shipped by sea.  They don't like big changes in air pressure.
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,dennistein,3,Mon May 4 15:59:17 2015 UTC,I think Malaysia air does batteries now.
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,MaddogBC,1 point,Mon May 4 21:37:50 2015 UTC,I would suggest trying the new option for shipping batteries Sweden Post Airmail.    Any particular reason for the Sweden option?  Just because it's new?  (I noticed the box mod I want can't be shipped via epacket so I will have to separate my order.)
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,CuBu,1 point,Mon May 4 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"well, batteries only have two options, hkpost surface mail or sweden post airmail (like 2 months ago, there was only surface mail).  Judging from what I've seen on the fasttech forums, sweden post it seems quite speedy compared to surface mail option.  For box mod with battery , i think there's two additional options, singpost or malay post. In this case, I would use singpost but this is only because I've had a lot of packages come via singpost, and they are for the most part reliable (average around 4 weeks)."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,majorvapes,1 point,Mon May 4 21:26:57 2015 UTC,Read somewhere it was a new deal FT had worked out with an air carrier specifically to speed up battery shipments.
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,CuBu,1 point,Tue May 5 00:08:19 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, if they say authentic then it is the same product you would get if you bought them here, however you wont get the sticker or whatever that says it is real in most cases.  but yeah when it says authentic rest assured it's the real deal. and i think you should place two separate orders just incase on the battery/mod."
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,bubbzie,2,Mon May 4 13:44:40 2015 UTC,Maybe that's the case sometimes but I've received a number of authentics from FT and they all came with authenticity stickers/tags/qr codes.
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,SN1PE_PL,2,Mon May 4 14:46:06 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, I havnt ordered from fast tech in some time perhaps they've truely stepped their game up.  I'm actually quite happy to know they have the stickers now. I might order some RBA's from them soon"
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,DJ_Chaps,1 point,Mon May 4 15:06:38 2015 UTC,Yep. All of my cold I've purchased have had the authenticity check stickers
Canadian_ecigarette,34tlxn,bongafied,1 point,Wed May 6 05:52:47 2015 UTC,Never had an issue buying authentics. I often checked the serial codes and never had problem.

Canadian_ecigarette,34sr8b,the_snorps,1 point,Mon May 4 11:27:37 2015 UTC,"1 week plus shipping time. I'm a freak though and need my first impression to be as positive as possible. My bottle hasn't changed at all in the week I've had it and my gut says tweaker is less affected by steeping than some of the richer flavours.  Don't wait a week on my account, few people do. My favourite flavour, Mana Biscuit does change significantly in the first month IMO. I still really love it the first week, it just seems to get thicker and almost ""buttery"" the darker it gets. Likely plenty of placebo effect in play but I really enjoy it all the same."

If every vaper called their card of choice in the same week we'd see an immediate response of some kind I'm sure. They like making money."

Canadian_ecigarette,34sdpf,littleb2017,2,Mon May 4 04:10:58 2015 UTC,Do you know how to lock the wattage or turn off/disable the memory mode? It always switches to 70W in my pocket and I've almost vaped my melo at 70w a few times. Its going to happen soon and I know it and I'm terrified haha
Canadian_ecigarette,34sdpf,Mauledbyaseal,2,Mon May 4 04:39:20 2015 UTC,Hold the wattage up/down buttons at the same time.  Locks the device and it will not fire until you hold them down again to unlock.
Canadian_ecigarette,34sdpf,littleb2017,1 point,Mon May 4 04:50:42 2015 UTC,Lol I have no idea.  I always lock the mod before it goes in my pocket though.  I have sat on the button before and warmed my leg up pretty good a couple times.

I noticed right away the power drop vs like 30 watt istick is way different it seems to hit the same much lower settings on the power.   So I got batteries on the way someone told me were crappy efest 1600 30 amp coulda done better but they will work.

Canadian_ecigarette,34rrjw,dotvapes,1 point,Mon May 4 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks! I guess I can trade in my MVP 2.0 for a little discount if I go there. I don't believe they have their pre-owned products on the website though so I'd have to pay them a visit. The eleaf 50w and eleaf 30w sound perfect for me and my gf respectively, but I'm just very weary of the whole battery exploding thing, especially since she's never vaped before and I want it to go as smoothly as possible for her."
Canadian_ecigarette,34rrjw,dotvapes,2,Mon May 4 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"Hello /u/Big-Science ,  If you are on a tight budget but still would like a super enjoyable vape experience, without worrying about difficulty of use etc, I'd recommend an Ego-One for your girlfriend. It's super easy, small, and comes in a nice variety of colours (oh man that sentence is going to get trolled).   As for VV/VW devices, I think that the SmokM80+ is just a star in it's current environment, bringing all the features of $200+ mods with a low price point and a built in battery  (great for newer vapers).  For tanks there are a few options. On a tight budget, the Melo is a great tank! Alternately you could buy the Delta II or the Subtank.  The choice I recommend is the Smok VCT Pro , as it can take the GCT Nickel coils but maintains an outstanding airflow :) Best of many worlds!  For those who aren't aware, smok is killing it right now :)  For juices, Always gotta give a shout to /u/evaperated, sadie will set you in a good direction. Also /u/setzrfd from SZVapor and 705 E-Liquids are among my favourites in the ~15-16/30mL price point.  Cheers!  DTV_John"

However, trying to google SmokM80+ only came up with a bunch of instagram links and fasttech doesn't seem to carry them. Is there a specific vendor that sells them?  Edit: Also, great suggestion on the Ego-One. I'm looking at reviews and videos and it seems to be very easy and powerful while not looking too strange, which I imagine is something she might like (she found my MVP 2.0 very weird looking)."

Canadian_ecigarette,34rrjw,CuBu,3,Tue May 5 03:00:42 2015 UTC,"I personally really enjoy my eleaf 30w running a subtank mini. Great flavor and vapor. Its cost effective. I run the 1.2 ohm coils, I also rebuild the coils as well. Saving money! The subtank also comes with its own RBA section(albeit it can be a challenge at times)  I'd avoid the 50w eleafs as they are flawed..they auto fire and nearly explode. With this setup I run through about 3-5ml a day. I'm don't feel I need high wattage devices if I'm happy with what I have now. High wattage leads to increased juice consumption. I'm poor. As far as juices go there are lots of Canadian vendors selling great stuff. I've tried almost all of flavour crafter's line and they are all very good. I recently got into high VG with the Blind Pig line(The Capone is my favorite flavor) /u/evaperated is probably the absolute Best to look at for price, service and absolute top notice quality ejuice. You can't go wrong.   Vape On!"

Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,eastcoastfog,1 point,Mon May 4 00:04:32 2015 UTC,I feel that it would be a bit underwhelming. Maybe a tugboat or something but 20W is way too low a cap. at least in my opinion.
Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,dotvapes,1 point,Mon May 4 00:08:51 2015 UTC,is there a decent regulated good value mod that you might recommend for this purpose? I'm toying with istick50 but all the alarm about the autofire has me rethinking things.
Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,dotvapes,3,Mon May 4 00:17:31 2015 UTC,"A smok M80+ would be a good go-to, in my opinion :D"

Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,dotvapes,1 point,Mon May 4 09:32:07 2015 UTC,I started dripping on a 30 watt mod and run 20 watts to conserve battery life like I said no clouds but more flavour then you will ever get out of a tank
Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,Jesse_J,1 point,Mon May 4 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"I was told that the istick 20W is too low powered to handle RDAs. I'm thinking i may have to go up in battery power. Any suggestions for a good value battery? (not too pricey, girl on a tight budget)"
Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,dotvapes,3,Mon May 4 00:04:47 2015 UTC,Vaping and budget rarely mix
Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,dotvapes,2,Mon May 4 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"This. It usually goes like this:   I'm going to use vaping to quit smoking I've quit smoking so I'm saving money, may as well get a better clearomizer/tank I have still quit smoking, and I'm still saving money, but I would like more vapour, lets get a dripper and a high VW device ??????? links images to table full of every high end juice, 3 100+W mods, 10 drippers, 3 mech mods, 2 rta's, 2 clearos, and that ego you started with that you never touch"

Canadian_ecigarette,34rnza,dotvapes,1 point,Mon May 4 06:46:17 2015 UTC,What guage wire are you using? 28guage 7-8 wrap over a decent bit should provide good flavour. perhaps you don't have the necessary power (25W or so)
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,ronndilla,5,Sun May 3 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"Sigelei 150W + 2 pairs of 25R batteries.  RDA (clones are cheap, you can get one or two or more depends what you're looking for out of your RDA)  2 different gauge wires (26 gauge and 24 gauge seem to be the most popular I guess)  Japanese Organic Cotton  Ohm Meter, which you don't really need with a regulated box mod like the Sig 150W.  Tweezers, wire cutters, screw driver set.  That's probably the basics of what you'll need to start with and should run you under $300 depending on which RDA you choose.  I would recommend a Derringer clone (I have the ciggreen one and it works great) and a Mutation X3 authentic both will run you about $60ish. Derringer for flavor and Mutation for chucking clouds.  Gl!  edit:sorry format was fucked"
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,sansaset,2,Sun May 3 23:28:01 2015 UTC,Good recommendation.  I would also add 28AWG wire to start with and a charger for the batteries!!! ;)  I'd remove the derringer. Grab a Magma/N22/Freakshow instead. The derringer might make you hate dripping with the spitback. I don't think it's a starters device.
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,TheVaporist,1 point,Mon May 4 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay. I've heard of the freaks how but not the other ones. I'll look into them, thank you!"
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,floss-daily,1 point,Mon May 4 00:53:15 2015 UTC,"If you want a cheap and good quality authentic RDA take a look at the Mako. Also, Flawless (they make Tugboat) is coming out with the Production RDA which is on the cheaper end of an authentic RDA as well."
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,ZorroElite,1 point,Thu May 7 15:01:46 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I was actually looking at the Derringer clone on eastcoastvape and wondering how it was compared to the original. Any input on good vendors to buy from? I would like to buy it online seeing how I live on vancouver island and my town only has two overpriced shops.
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,sansaset,2,Sun May 3 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"I like /u/sansaset recommendation.  Just a couple of additional thoughts.  You can skip on buying japanese organic cotton and grab a package of Shiseido cotton from your local Shopper's Drugmart (or Pharmaprix if you are in Quebec).  Almost every RDA you buy will come with a mini screwdriver, and you can actually wrap your coils on that when you are starting out.  If you go with tweezers, recommend the ceramic tip so you don't accidentally burn your fingers.  I actually use toothless needlenose pliars which I find works better for me.  (Which I got at Canadian Tire for about $8)  Also, nail clippers work really well as wire cutters. =)"
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,GrimReefer_420,1 point,Mon May 4 00:18:58 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for the help :)

Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,Winter_knights,2,Mon May 4 00:52:10 2015 UTC,"I don't nessecary think you need a new mod to start dripping, unless you want to really subohm. Dripping at 1ohm has great flavor and vapor production, all while eliminating the cost of buying prebuilt atomizers."
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,dotvapes,1 point,Mon May 4 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"Totally understand, only thing is it limits me if I want to in the future. I would like to upgrade to something that gives me the option if I ever feel like delving into sub ohm."
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,CuBu,2,Mon May 4 00:14:57 2015 UTC,"300 is a lot of leeway. I would recommend you pick up a smokM80+ or an IPV4, then pair that with a couple of dripper clones, mainly ones of different styles (a plumeveil for flavour and an airek or a DogeV3 for Vapor Production), then a spool of 24ga Kanthal and 26 Ga Kanthal.  (i recommend the M80 as a dripper's starter because you don't need to spend that very treasured coin on 18650's and a charger right away, see if you like dripping first, 80W is more than enough :))"
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,SpeshulSnoflake,1 point,Mon May 4 00:07:31 2015 UTC,"Haha after your last comment you left on my post I've been leaning towards the m80. I feel like 80 watt will be enough for me to get into it and if in the future I feel the need, I can upgrade again. Thanks for the info!"
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,SpeshulSnoflake,2,Mon May 4 00:18:04 2015 UTC,"For sure :) I think that the fact that it offers temperature control as well makes it a REALLY heavy contender at that price, especially as an entry level. 80W down to .2 ohms is lots :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,unfortunateleader,1 point,Mon May 4 00:37:45 2015 UTC,How does the temp control work? I've seen a few people talking about it on Reddit but haven't looked into it myself to be honest.
Canadian_ecigarette,34rjw1,CuBu,1 point,Mon May 4 00:55:50 2015 UTC,I have the M80 but it came with 006 firmware. The 004 firmware was the one with the shitty temp control. If you find one with newer firmware then it should work but it's not perfect according to some reviews with a lot of ramp up time. I haven't started building yet cause I just got mine on Wednesday. I bought it and started using right of the box and only had to charge it for the first time on Sunday night. So far I am very happy with it. Buying some wire and an RDA this week to start building.

I find myself visiting that sub only when I need to buy something quick and locally. Perhaps we can promote that sub better here to encourage more subscriptions, or even a widget here showing classifieds posts from there. Not sure if reddit makes it possible to have that sort of things.   Also this sub generally gets about 10-12 posts a day, which is not much at all. I figured posting the ad here would add to this subs content while being seen by more people. Win-win :)  But I do understand how it can be a slippery slope to this sub turning into a giant ad fest, but IMO we're not quite there yet."

Canadian_ecigarette,34qvhy,Drfacialphd,3,Sun May 3 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"If you're exclusively going to be rebuilding on it, I have the Lemo 2 and I'm in love with it.

The RDA section saves the subtank IMO.  If you absolutely need a sub-ohm tank backup, grab the Atlantis 2 since it's the second most popular one and readily available everywhere."
Canadian_ecigarette,34qvhy,TheVaporist,2,Sun May 3 19:49:47 2015 UTC,I have yet to try the RDA section of the subtank. Did you need to open up the juice channels at all?
Canadian_ecigarette,34qvhy,Lampburglar,2,Sun May 3 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"There's no mechanism to manually adjust the juice channel width. I've personally had very little luck with the RBA section (or the OCC coils for that matter). Leaking, gurgling, dry hits galore. Some have taken dremels to their juice channels or punched holes in the chimney base to get more out of their Subtank.  I'd look at the Delta II. I don't know if the RBA section is available yet, but it has adjustable juice flow and the juice channels themselves are designed better. I don't have one, but I will when the RBA section comes out."
Canadian_ecigarette,34qvhy,setzRFD,2,Sun May 3 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Leaking, gurgling, dry hits galore   Leaking I would check if the tank itself is properly sealed (if you want I can ship you replacement o-rings to test).  For the rest, I would check the airflow and how hard you inhale when taking a puff.  Unless you received a dud it shouldn't have all those problems. If you were close i'd offer to take a look at it."
Canadian_ecigarette,34qvhy,TheVaporist,1 point,Sun May 3 21:48:36 2015 UTC,This is why I did a chimney build.  Max vg and no dry hits at all.  Very good flavor as well.

Canadian_ecigarette,34orgj,napkinolympics,2,Sun May 3 18:41:31 2015 UTC,One of my favorite juices is Corsair. Another good one I've tried recently is Key West. The only problem with Key West is the 50/50 blend was amazing but I wasn't impressed with the max VG version.
Canadian_ecigarette,34orgj,antaios256,1 point,Sun May 3 19:30:46 2015 UTC,Kind of wary of lemon... tried some today and it tasted like perfume. The lime sounds delicious though! Thanks.

I would recommend it to anyone  Also from ECV, the After 8 is really good, and accurate and i've got Pepermint hot chocolate and Cocolate mint P.I.C on it's way so i can give opinions on them later in the week.  That's all i've tried that really seems to match what you're asking for, but i know http://vape29.com sells MtBakerVapor at a good price and they have alot of fruit flavors and if you found one you liked you could get 236ml for 39$ so that's a fairly good deal."

Canadian_ecigarette,34o76w,Adolph_Bernanke,4,Sun May 3 12:36:00 2015 UTC,Vapewild are one of the sneakier vendors. They usually label their shipments as motor oil or shampoo so they usually get through customs no issues. Others like mbv don't try to hide anything so are more likely to be turned back.

Five Pawns is supposed to be a premium brand, but I far prefer Fusion Flavours or Flavour Crafters over anything I've ever had from anyone else. Their flavours are amazing.   By contrast, Fusion's juice is available in 120ml format for around $30 if you want them to custom make you juice. (one flavour only, though.) Their own juice I've only ever seen in B&M and not online but if you can find it, they truly do some wonderful stuff.  Flavour Crafters is $20 for a 30ml at our B&M. We've probably tried every single flavour in the shop and keep trying them as they come in new and every time we end up picking up a Flavour Crafters."

Canadian_ecigarette,34p131,Winter_knights,1 point,Sun May 3 16:53:33 2015 UTC,"Clones are just copies of an RDA. Companies such as Cigreen and Tobeco make clones of RDAs and sell them at a much lower price.  FastTech has a lot of clones (some authentics), at a much cheaper price than you can get them for if they were authentic.  Just because they're clones doesn't mean they're bad. Some are worse, some are the same, and others are even better than the authentic. Just make sure you look at the reviews or discussions of a clone before buying one.  Compared to a kanger subtank, RDA's provide more clouds, gives you the ability of making coils that suit you, and require dripping every few hits. You would want them if you don't want to keep buying replacement coil heads, want to start building, or the like.  I found dripping to be more enjoyable since I can make different coils at different resistance, and my derringer gives me the best flavor I ever had (haven't vaped in a while though)."

It's just hard for me to justify paying 19 for a home brand liquid, that's what i'd pay for the premiums i use from well known brands. and for like home brand ECV sells 30ml for 9.99 or 11$ depending on if it's the  normal or premium line."
Canadian_ecigarette,34o7gk,CuBu,1 point,Sun May 3 01:12:52 2015 UTC,"Hey CuBu! Captain Black has been moved out of our Signature Line after we've decided to settle for only 4 flavors.

There's also our second promo going on for a free 15ml bottle included on orders over 50$, free 30ml on orders over 90$. Give it a try if these prices are closer to your price range. I am guaranteeing you, in front of fellow redditors, that I will personally refund your bottle if it's not up to your expectations :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,34o7gk,vapor_aromatics,1 point,Mon May 4 08:17:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the Review :)  As for the pricing you redditors mentioned, it's a business decision that had to be taken in order to keep the brand's integrity. We focus mainly on distributing wholesale to Brick and Mortar Vape Shops, and therefore cannot have a price difference between online and in-store. Also, other points that might not be as obvious is that it might look like a simple setup to make e-liquid, but running an incorporation is so much more costly than just renting a place and mixing. Incorporating and trademarking the Brand cost us well over 2000$, a year of sampling and playing around with all the possible flavorings available on the market was another grand (not counting the time of course) we have over 10 grand invested (self-funded) in furnitures, equipment from sterilizers to precision filling machines, labeling machines, capping machines, etc.  One shipment of nic out of three being seized at the border means a 33% increase in nic price. European flavorings, which are what we mostly use, also end up costing near four times as much as what regular - let's say TFA - costs. Four liters of flavoring ends up costing 1000$ after import duties and USD-CAD conversion.  We're trying to implement an efficient batch numbering system, which means changing some of our machines once again. We're trying to follow ECTA's guidelines and eventually start sending samples out for testing at Enthalpy Analytical - close to 300$ per sample tested.   Expenses add up very quickly when you try to push for perfection without cutting corners. Especially in an industry where people will only believe in you AFTER trying your product. Our startup has been very encouraging so far - we made it to Four stores and one enormous Montreal wholesaler in just under two weeks - But there's still so much to be covered. And that's mainly because we can actually show up and make them try the flavors.  We do however try to make it up with a free 15ml on orders over 50$, and a free 30ml on orders over 90$. On top of that, there's a 20% off using coupon code ""Brickquidonly20"". Both these promos combined I think the end price is very reasonable (13.6$ per 30ml, without counting the free 15/30ml bottle)  If redditors would like to chime in with any suggestions on how to spread the word on Reddit about Brickquid, feel free to do so! I'm personally unfamiliar with Reddit. Perhaps a contest? Giveaways in hopes of getting reviews? What usually works with redditors? Thanks  for any input!  *edit: added end price for a 30ml"
Canadian_ecigarette,34o7gk,vapor_aromatics,1 point,Mon May 4 08:07:20 2015 UTC,Wow Montreal has so many vape shops now. I'd be worried about opening one because Vaporus appears to be dominating everything.
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,RobertDF902,5,Sat May 2 03:53:30 2015 UTC,"We have sold a crap ton of isticks in the past 6 months. Here is my take: I stick 20w had some bad threading issues to the point where I would have to go through 2 or 3 to find one that I could put a Nautilus on, but no other real issues to speak of as far as the electronics.   Istick 30w had minor issues here and there with the charge port, but at least they fixed the damn threading.   The 50w, I have seen a few issues with them, but only 1 so far that the customer said it autofires. 1 out of the hundreds and hundreds we have sent out. (That we were made aware of I guess) They do seem to have the most issues though of all the isticks, but only one so far seems dangerous and we got them to ship it back immediately for a replacement. I havent looked at it yet, as it hasnt arrived, but I didnt want to take any chances and am replacing it regardless.   With many of these devices, user error plays a part as well. Nearly every issue with isticks that we can fix centers around the atty being way too tight, dirt in the 510, dirt everywhere else, etc.   With all this in my head, the question is: Am I worried about the istick 50w in my pocket as we speak?  Maybe a little. But not enough to stop using it for now."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,eastcoastvape,2,Sat May 2 11:48:18 2015 UTC,"Same here..we don't have the same volume, but few 50W came back.   Being a tinkerer I always open them up to see what the problem could be. We had a return for an autofire that really scared me. The device would autofire at 50W no matter ON or OFF, as long as an atty was connected to it. There wasn't any eliquid inside, and there didn't seem to be a short on the PCB (from what I could figure).  It's normal for devices to to have a defect rate, but it shouldn't be something that can be dangerous. My 2 rDNAs have the exact same sporadic problem (""temperature protected"" bug with temp control OFF), but in no way that is a dangerous problem (it simply won't let me vape).   I never took any iStick for myself, as small and sleek as their are, I simply don't trust them."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat May 2 13:29:55 2015 UTC,I got mine from you guys in the contest win.  I'm a bit worried now as well do you have any suggestions? Would that L bracket they had for the 20w make it less scary?
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,SuminderJi,2,Sat May 2 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"For that specific problem yes that would resolve it.  My recommendation for it would be to never charge it unattended. If you aren't using it, remove the atty."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat May 2 16:22:06 2015 UTC,Its my daily driver so take out the atty at night. Charge it only when I can look at it with a glance?   Do you sell that L clip thing? I'm about due for another order from you anyways.   Edit: Checked your site couldn't find it.
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,SuminderJi,2,Sat May 2 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would only charge it when it's close.  Unfortunately we don't have the bending adaptor :("
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,TheVaporist,1 point,Sat May 2 17:13:57 2015 UTC,Cools thanks for your help!
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,SuminderJi,3,Sat May 2 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"No issues, 2 of them here. Ya theres a problem and I am worried about them but you can look at a survey on /r/istick and 70% of people have voted no problem whatsoever. It seems a very small percentage of people have a major catastrophe and that's about as comparable as everything else I've seen fail.   I've looked almost every day and expect to see thread after thread of failures they way people are talking about it. It's not there though."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,Tramd,2,Sat May 2 04:04:48 2015 UTC,"I think there are too many variables. A lot of threads say it was after juice leaked in to the unit. I also see on the survey that a lot of people are using the incorrect charger. I also know there are a lot of 1:1 clones out there. Not to mention you can type ""(insert mod name here) auto firing/burning issue"" into Google and always get results. The people that have issues are always the most vocal on the matter, and taking in to account how many units have sold and how popular it is - there's bound to be more reports by default.  I'm very careful with my stuff and have never had anything leak in to it. I check the internal temperature during use and charging and it never goes over 35° (protection kicks in at 70°)  Fingers crossed."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,Tramd,2,Sat May 2 04:22:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly think there is a shockingly low amount of posts for how outraged and crazy people are acting. For every post I've seen someone talking about a problem there are 5 just talking about possible future problems. Obviously it's not good but I don't see it being much different from other devices failing. Not to mention the link spam comments people keep pasting always seem to start with ""I dunked the thing in juice this morning and...""   I mean mine has gotten warm while charging, and while using it at 25-30W. So has my cell phone though. Time will tell if it fails or not but I doubt the failure rate of these is any greater than anything else. These just happen to be the first widely popular high wattage device."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,Hubatola,1 point,Sat May 2 04:26:55 2015 UTC,I saw one post there today which was (apparently) a post from ELeaf saying the problem was corrected and only was a factor with an earlier production run. I have no idea if it was verified.

Apparently eleafus has nothing to do with eleaf either. The fact that no one has found anything to point to be like ""here, this right here is why it's failing"" is suspicious as well. I mean these devices are either damaged easily or defective if that's the case. I'd like to see exactly what it is."

Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,Tramd,1 point,Sat May 2 10:46:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is my first time hearing about the issue... and juice leaked all over my istick 50w last week, then wouldn't turn on.  It's currently in a ziploc bag of rice and silica packs.  I got mine as a pre-order, so I believe it would have been from the first run of devices.   Should I be worried about it?   Now I'm scared to take it out of the rice and try firing it, lest it burn my face off."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,Michlerish,1 point,Sat May 2 11:24:30 2015 UTC,It's not something that will just happen immediately and explode. It would fire repeatedly and eventually heat up enough for the batteries to vent. Then it could possibly catch fire. If it starts to malfunction and autofire I would get rid of it.

Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,CAVaper,1 point,Sat May 2 23:54:41 2015 UTC,"After a quick google I am still pretty sure that the Istick 50 INTERNALLY sets a limit of 1 amp. I'm no EE, but am pretty sure battery current draw while charging is only affected by the chargers upper limits, providing the voltages are compatible.  All I have to back that up is some other internet discussions, but I'd bet a days wages that I could compare internal temps with a 1 amp charger and my 1.8 amp and see identical results. FWIW"

Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,Tramd,2,Sat May 2 14:10:03 2015 UTC,"Though those with actual 50W issues are really angry when you bring this up, it seems a lot of the actual problem 50w's out there are related to extreme use (running super low ohms, chain vaping it) and/or messy RDA use.   One person brought up a comment - these issues have only started appearing in the last month or so. Ironically, during that same time period, 1:1 (cosmetic at least) clones already hit the market and have gotten into peoples' hands for at least a month. This seems plausible - it could be that the problem 50w's are the clones that people either knowingly or unknowingly bought.   If you try to get a poll of accurate, no bullshit information on who is actually having 50w problems, how they used the device, what they were running on them, you'll just get downvoted in the main ecig reddit. Thing is, this kind of info would be very valuable to other iStick 50w owners, who would gauge what trends lead up to the devices having problems.  I'm not excusing eLeaf here at all, if their devices are faulty. But I know, from a lot of experience, that we always hear the negatives, rarely hear the positives, and rarely get the naked truth about the failures (if someone dropped their iStick 50w hard before use, for eg) so it's hard to get a gauge on how frequent these problems are, how they happen, and if the product is 100% legit eLeaf."
Canadian_ecigarette,34lab5,eastcoastfog,1 point,Sat May 2 23:28:19 2015 UTC,The problem with the istick issues isn't the amount of them it's the type lots of mods will have problems but not all of them will burn your house down.

There's a big difference between talking shit when you can't do anything about it and taking action when it would involve hurting an industry which contributes a significant amount of tax money, and makes a ton of campaign contributions. The Rhinoceros Party promised to tow the country to the tropics. You can talk all kinds of shit when there's no possibility of being able to do anything about it. Doesn't mean you'd do it in the same circumstances. As I say, look at the current budget. They patched it up with tobacco taxes. How would the Conservatives make that up? Would they be willing to hurt a major industry (although, not a major employer amusingly) in favour of the long-term (more than their term of office) savings in the form of health care?"

But with Hudak gone, and people like Hillier fighting for us, I'm much more inclined to vote conservative provincially.

He contacted one of the persons from Canvape to see if he could have it replaced, and Canvape was exceedingly rude to him and told him he's SOL. Mike then said he would be posting it on Facebook at which point the Canvape Facebook page had a couple posts calling Mike out by name, poking fun at him, etc. They even went so far to make a coupon that was something like ""mikeisadick"" and plastered it everyone. It was a catastrophe of customer support to say the least. I've personally only had a couple issues with Canvape with my own orders. Things missing, wrong item, damaged item. Usually I'm told I'm on my own and they decline responsibility. These are pretty minor considering I wasn't buying expensive stuff to begin with. However, in the last year I've heard innumerable stories of their poor customer service, and this thing last week only cemented this idea."""

Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,setzRFD,3,Thu Apr 30 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"I think the odds of you getting a defective product is slim: remember, those who have negative experiences with vendors are much more vocal than those who have positive experiences. While you might hear a lot about their poor customer service, I don't doubt the times they pulled through outnumbers them. Not to downplay the issues, however.  I think it's up to you.

Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,D3adkl0wn,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:34:05 2015 UTC,I've ordered from them a couple times. No issues there. Nothing i ordered from there has broken yet so i haven't needed to return anything so i don't know anything about that.
Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,joekerr37,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:58:50 2015 UTC,I hear so many conflicting experiences so I think I'll err on the side of caution and just wait until eastcoastvape gets restocked.
Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,joekerr37,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"If you really really want it, this place has it: http://www.happyvaper.com/product_p/ipv-mini2.htm , i have no idea how good of a vendor they are though."
Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,SuminderJi,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:12:30 2015 UTC,Eh they're selling it for $90 which is $10 more than eastcoastvape. I'd rather order from a well known vendor anyways.  Tbh I wouldn't be so impatient normally but I'm out of coils since the vendor I ordered them from sent me the wrong ones.
Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,SuminderJi,2,Thu Apr 30 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding?  HappyVaper (in Vaughan) is probably one of the very first Canadian vendors!  They are ROCK solid... But often expensive. Not always, but often.  For example... Their ipv4 pre-order was $10 less than the next cheapest Canadian vendor."
Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,Fubar_AngerCrank,1 point,Fri May 1 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if you want perfection in CS, go to HV. They might be a few dollars more (and really, I think most of us can afford the extra $10), but they ship incredibly fast. They also have a live Chat and I've dealt with Katharine there a bunch of times, absolutely HILARIOUS! (And hot!)   On the other side of the coin, I actually overheard Adam of Canvape saying that he'd started, undercutting every other vendor, in hopes of driving them out of business, then he'd be 'THE Canadian vendor and everyone would have to deal with him.   What a douchebag."
Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,umbrlla,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"Ouch. That sucks man. Are they sending you back the proper ones? I haven't had an order screw up yet from anywhere i've ordered. ECV is by far one of the best priced vendors for hardware and liquid. I need to get a pack of subtank coils next week from them, way cheaper than anywhere locally and a lot of other vendors. Halfway through my bottle of dragon blood ;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,34fiku,CAVaper,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:24:07 2015 UTC,I replied to my order email and left them a comment on Facebook (vendor is Haze Vape Co) so hopefully they reply soon and ship out the right coils. Unfortunately I popped one out of the packet just to double check they were wrong so I doubt I can send them back.
Canadian_ecigarette,34hgh4,beerawk,2,Fri May 1 04:33:31 2015 UTC,well given what you have said i would consider trying:   nevermore - an apple fritter kind of flavour   blue sky bitch - tastes like a blue freezie or a blue raspberry pushpop  pez off - tastes just like pez (even has a kinda powdery after taste like pez)  Mana biscuit - taste like a sugar cookie with a hint of sweet cinnamon sugar (my ADV)  hannibal nectar - a lemon cookie with icing in the middle and raspberry drizzle on the top (havnt tried this one)  some other flavours i recommend are:  Meloncholy - a creamy honeydew melon (My other ADV)  Zomberry - a delicious take on strawberries an cream  Patient zero - great if you like custards  Tweaker - tastes like an A&W root beer float

Canadian_ecigarette,34efmh,asmitha123,3,Thu Apr 30 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's common place.   There's a handful of professional operations out there if you ask me. Most are the equivalent of ""flea market"" vendors who simply sell online.   The use of EMT for payment doesn't help matters much either. At least with a credit card you can get the payment cancelled, but with EMT you've paid and there's not much you can do to get your money back"
Canadian_ecigarette,34efmh,joekerr37,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:00:35 2015 UTC,Seriously? Alright so I'm not the only one. I'll see if either of these two places make it right.
Canadian_ecigarette,34efmh,evaperated,3,Thu Apr 30 14:05:39 2015 UTC,"As a vendor, mistakes do happen, especially if the staff is limited it's a busy time.  However, most places will quickly right a wrong if you email them.  I've missed a juice, or sent the wrong size, but I do my best to make it up to my customers.  If a vendor takes your money and doesn't give you exactly what you ordered and refuses to correct it, well... the best you can do is let others know.   The vape community is pretty tight knit which is good because it keeps vendors honest if they care about their customers and their business at all.  Word spreads quickly, so hopefully they realize that and send you what you ordered.  Best of luck to you!"
Canadian_ecigarette,34efmh,evaperated,2,Thu Apr 30 15:52:07 2015 UTC,"I agree mistakes do happen, no one is perfect. Like I did with my eastcoastvape post.

Thankfully though, you can report companies for fraud, or attempt to get your money back if they have taken money and not sent product.  I've actually done this successfully once for an order I made online (not vape related) and my bank investigated and returned my money.  I'm not sure what bank you go through, but you could call and see what they do in those instances.  It took a while for me, but I did get my money back :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,34d56t,mind_circus,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:23:00 2015 UTC,I have tried a twisted 28g in my drippers and they work great. I wrap   2 coils - 2.4mm with 6 wraps it ended around 0.30 ohms. Use your nemisis clone with a minimum 20 amp battery.Be careful with the 0.30 build..Know what your battery is  capable of..and enjoy.
Canadian_ecigarette,34d56t,V8per,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:24:47 2015 UTC,I will try this and report back. Im using a VTC5 and an Efest 35A so I should alright but good looking out.
Canadian_ecigarette,34d56t,V8per,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:28:38 2015 UTC,"Those batteries should be OK. The twisted coils take  some time to heat up..and they cool slower..but they a give warm, dense vape with great flavour. Single coil twisted .28 is also very nice..that may fit into the Subtank..but the iStick will only go to 30w, not the 40-45w that you need..my iStick will fire a .40 build..but it will not give me the extra wattage.Cheers."
Canadian_ecigarette,34d56t,MaddogBC,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:35:59 2015 UTC,Best build ever...  Seems hella complicated at first but it really isn't. Once you've made one it's pretty quick and easy to do. I can't really enjoy vaping on standard coils anymore...

Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,extremethickness,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:47:14 2015 UTC,I was going to upgrade to a 50w as well next pay cheque and now I'm terrified of this happening in my pocket or in the work truck. Issues of it auto firing and by passing the 10 second cut off.  Eleaf has yet to respond to any of this which also makes me wary of their products now. Looks like I'll have to save up a few cheques and buy something a little more reputable.   Even if no one responds to this thread with issues I want to help spread the word so this doesn't hurt anyone.
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,remember_987,2,Wed Apr 29 06:56:10 2015 UTC,I just posted a thread a few days ago asking for alternatives to the Istick 50 watt. Got lots of recommendations for the smok xpro m80 plus and the IPV mini 2. Both of them are worth checking out as an alternative.
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,Mauledbyaseal,2,Wed Apr 29 08:05:40 2015 UTC,"Lots of replies from people recommending the m80 so I think I'll do a little research on it, thanks man!"
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,Mauledbyaseal,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"I'm running the IPV Mini 2 with a Subtank Mini as well as a Mephisto Clone.  It's an amazing little thing, can handle down to .2 ohms and fire up to 70 watts.  Bonus is the replaceable battery so when I'm at work I just bring along an extra charged up battery and swap them out.  It's a bit more pricey, but I love it so much.  Will I ever need the full 70 watts? Probably not, but she puts out.  Plus the goat head on it is METAL AS FVCK."
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,Jadall7,2,Thu Apr 30 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"Haha that's rad. I'm still fairly new to vaping, started out with a Kangertech EMOW on an iStick 20w about two and a half months ago to quit smoking. Wasn't happy with the EMOW after a couple weeks so I did some research and bought a Nautilus Mini to replace it. Been rocking that and I'm happy with the set up for now. I do see myself upgrading in the near future though and getting into sub ohm and building my own coils."
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,dotvapes,2,Thu Apr 30 02:41:55 2015 UTC,"The rabbit hole it never ending.  I figured the istick 30w and subtank nano would be enough.  Then I figured to get a subtank mini, then i didn't like how big the mini was on the 30w, then I tried a buddy's Doge and then bought myself a dripper.  It doesn't end, you think it will, but it doesn't."
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,dotvapes,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:37:48 2015 UTC,My istick mini 2 is a solid device the power works properly on it (I think) like the stepdown thing where you have it a 7 watts and you get a burnt hit on a .5 ohm kanger subtank coil. I was almost OCD with leaving it plugged into the charger and dropped it off like nightstand bed height bent the charger port and a few days later it broke off. (got an external charger today). It's solid and pretty heavy too.
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,dotvapes,2,Fri May 8 01:42:20 2015 UTC,"Strongly recommend a SmokM80 Plus instead :) That's just my $.02 though :) The temp control is super impressive, works very interestingly, at least in my opinion."
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,RobertDF902,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:18:01 2015 UTC,Seems like a lot of people are recommending it. I'll have to do some research and see what best suits my needs right now. Thanks for the info buddy :)
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,dotvapes,2,Thu Apr 30 00:52:50 2015 UTC,"I would also say the extra 30W of leeway is really nice. Makes drippers more of a thing :) No prob.

Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,abacacus,2,Thu Apr 30 01:50:23 2015 UTC,Thanks man!

Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,Jadall7,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:54:25 2015 UTC,istick 20w and 30w might stop working but they don't seem to burn up.. I ALMOST bought istick 50w but since I just wrecked the 30w I went with different brand.
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,D3adkl0wn,2,Fri May 8 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"My 30w gets warm with excessive use and sometimes if I charge it when it ""low powers"" while using it, which can be a concern, But I've had mind since Feb with no major issue. No autofire, screen issues, buttons not working, or anything.  Biggest complaint is sometimes the up and down buttons are inconsistent when I want a specific wattage/voltage"
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,javagnome,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:00:54 2015 UTC,Good to know. I have a few friends with the 30 watt so I wanted to find out for them. Thanks man!

Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,morbidangel27,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:23:41 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned that in here as well. Never noticed until now but I do think mine are wearing down a bit. I had been judging how tight to put my tank on by doing it finger tight and the airflow hole would line up with the LED screen perfectly, and now it's not getting tight till past that by a few centimeters. Thanks man"
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,D3adkl0wn,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:37:46 2015 UTC,"Mine seemed to wear first at the top of the threads. So when I'd set the atomizer in place, it'd visibly fall in a little bit before I could thread it down. Eventually, they all went, and it won't hold an atomizer at all anymore.   They released the ""bending adapter"" to protect threads and give the user a spring-loaded 510 connection, and as a weird added bonus it allows you to open it and fold the tank down over the side of the mod for ""portability"" (shrug)."
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,morbidangel27,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:16:23 2015 UTC,"on my 30w it would do that I don't know if I had the button down or not. I THOUGHT I pressed it. You are not always looking at the screen either if it might have said ""no atomizer"" or something."

Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,dotvapes,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to start reading up on battery safety... I know a few things but not enough. Sigelei is at the top of the list, I'm just not sure if I should go 150w or 100w.. Right now I'm starting to push my istick 30w to the limits and I didn't think I'd do that, lol."
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,CuBu,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"Battery safety is a must.  I'd suggest trying to track down some 30A batteries (probably 4 as you'll need two married pairs) and a good charger and you'll be golden with a sigelei   But as far as pushing your istick, I was doing the same, but I'm still only using aroubd 25-30w on my sigelei..  But the battery life is days long and that in itself is amazing..  I really only ever kick up my wattage when I use a RDA and I don't use them much as I prefer a decent tank for a trouble free vape..    Right now my setup is awesome and I couldn't be happier, subtank mini and my sigelei is just perfect as far as I'm concerned."
Canadian_ecigarette,348yfd,dotvapes,2,Wed Apr 29 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"Battery life is exactly why I'm upping my mod. My istick needs to be charged a couple times a day now with vaping between 25 and 30w. Some days I use mostly my subtank mini, some days I use my RDA more.. and I'm waiting on 2 more RDAs to come in the mail in the next few days so I see using those alot in the next bit.   I was looking at the ipv mini 70w for awhile, but honestly... I don't want to buy it and be ""I should have gotten..."" and regret my decision. I'm just going to jump in and pick up a 150w device.. and the Sigelei is looking better and better.   Thanks for the tips, I'm price checking right now... my birthday and 5 month smoke-free anniversary are later this month so I think I'll be treating myself.."

Fusionflavors gets good reviews but is pricey and seem to be out of stock a lot.   But be warned... if you sell bad nic word will get around like wild fire after NicRus and Northernnic.

Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,Catmandingo,2,Wed Apr 29 00:20:26 2015 UTC,"What battery are you building on? When you start getting into thicker twisted coils they take longer to heat like you surmised, it's good to crank up the wattage to compensate in those cases."
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,IridiumForte,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:38:18 2015 UTC,In using an istick 20w until I can get something better. I have it cranked to as high as it will go with this coil. 5.5v which is 18.9w according to the display.
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,Solace_ffl,2,Wed Apr 29 01:18:23 2015 UTC,3 Strands is a ton of wire for only ~20w to heat up. It's going to heat up quite slowly so you will have to have a longer draw to get the same vapor production as the 2 strand build.
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,Solace_ffl,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:21:52 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I didn't think it would matter. So I should just stick to 2 strands or even one with less wraps? Then I will have a really tiny surface area, no?"
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,RobertDF902,2,Wed Apr 29 01:25:11 2015 UTC,"For lower Wattage devices I'd probably stick with single strand builds simply because the ramp up time on a twisted build will be quite long. That is unless you enjoy taking long draws, then by all means continue using a 2 strand twisted build because flavor on those builds is top notch ;P"
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,toad772,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:36:54 2015 UTC,Ok. Thanks for the advice.
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,TheVaporist,2,Wed Apr 29 01:47:15 2015 UTC,"The sweet spot for the 20w istick is ~1.3 ohms. As for the wire: twisted is using more wire therefore taking more time to heat up and more power is required to reach the proper temp.  One of my early setups was a 20w istick and a kayfun lite +. My favorite setup was with 28awg kanthal, 2mm inner diameter (little blue screwdriver), and 8-9 wraps. Good surface area, quick heatup, and great flavour/vapor."
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,NATEMCWN,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:20:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I guess I will get some thicker wire. I was just using this because it was free
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,EL400,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:26:39 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I run in my kfl+
Canadian_ecigarette,347vqd,EL400,2,Wed Apr 29 05:08:34 2015 UTC,"You are correct. The new coil takes longer to heat up.   As simple as it may sound, try a single macro 4-5 wraps over a 2.5mm bit. Should reach 1.6-1.7ohm. Try that at 15-18W (max your istick should hit).   Are you in Montreal? If so we'll pass by and drop you some 28/26AWG kanthal on our delivery run. If time allows we'll even help you out with a build!  Welcome to the Kayfun world of flavor :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,Rudigerger,2,Tue Apr 28 23:31:28 2015 UTC,"I personally LOVE my smok m80 plus. Also has some cool hidden features :) (it has some sort of temperature or dry burn resistance with kanthal, not sure why, was going to post a video soon!)  The IPV4 will not be out for a while, but a Sigelei 150 is definitely an option as well!"
Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,dotvapes,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"Wanna see that video forsure! And some IPV 4s are already landing in Canada.. A few Facebook vape groups I'm in have been showing off but not full reviews and I do wanna wait a little bit after release to see how it holds up. And I've also used the IPV mini 2 and really liked it so had high hopes for the 4.. But hear a lot of good things about the Sigelei, not so much the Smok 80 but it looks really decent an 80 watts should be more than enough for me.. I don't know what to do haha maybe just buy em all lol"
Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,eastcoastvape,2,Wed Apr 29 00:13:57 2015 UTC,"Tough call. I agree with /u/dotvapes, I love the M80 as well. Same battery life as the istick, but feels more solid. We have them for $70, so its a bargain for sure.  I haven't got a chance to play with the temp control. I chose to go with Sigelei 100 plus recently, only because I test a lot of the sub ohm tanks and RDA's that come through the door and I wanted 100w at my disposal. Great so far, very solid, but priced higher.  IPV mini 2 is a great 70w option. Small, but for me, 1x 18650 isn't enough life, but again, also solid build.  Waiting to test the IPV 4. I think it will be much more expensive so it depends on your budget if its worth the wait.   Hope this helps!"
Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,eastcoastvape,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:02:30 2015 UTC,"so far i've been able to find pre-orders for the IPV 4 at $100, might increase in price upon full release thought i guess… i think I'm gonna go with a Smok M80 and try for the IPV 4, could always sell or trade one if it doesn't suit me… got any discounts on the M80 ;) lol"
Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,Naiser_,2,Wed Apr 29 01:55:35 2015 UTC,We sure do! $72...cheapest I could find in Canada. (We always try to make sure we are the lowest price.) I will say that we are down to 3 silver as we speak. More coming soon though.  Edit: I have learned from MANY experiences that pre-orders suck. You pay...and wait. Release date pushed back...you wait. Something better gets released in the mean time...still waiting and now regretting.
Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,Naiser_,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm gonna grab the M80 while I wait for the pre-order.

Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,mind_circus,2,Wed Apr 29 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"I have the Sig 150 and it's probably the best piece of vape equipment I have ever owned (been vaping almost a year and a half). It's essentially the same as the Sig 100Plus. It's a very solid mod. It just works... all the time.   If budget is a big concern, the m80 is probably your better bet. It's less expensive and the Sig will need two 18650s and a charger if you don't already have one.  In terms of power, 80w is more than enough for most people. I rarely fire my Sig over 55 watts. I do, however, like knowing that the power is there in the future. It wasn't so long ago I didn't see a reason for more than 15w. ;)"
Canadian_ecigarette,347pr2,Adolph_Bernanke,2,Wed Apr 29 04:18:26 2015 UTC,"When I need above 40W (DNA40), I pull out the Sig 150.   I definitely don't need above 80, but between Smok and Sigelei, I put my trust in Sig.   I don't understand how it doesn't scare people that they released a device and touted a feature that didn't work. How did they test the feature?? What else was neglected?? Fixing the problem with updated firmware does not remove the fact their testing and QC is extremely questionable."

Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,evaperated,2,Tue Apr 28 14:52:29 2015 UTC,Oh ya. I love vapemail from Evaperated. It's just.....the best thing to get in the mail.
Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,rocksteadymachine,3,Tue Apr 28 01:10:53 2015 UTC,So far its the only vendor other than Dashvapes that I have ordered from on more than 1 occasion.
Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,rocksteadymachine,2,Tue Apr 28 01:25:03 2015 UTC,My first two bottles were honestly to help me quit smoking. Then I got slurm from a place in Texas. Everything since then has been this.
Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,dirtychopstickz,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:29:52 2015 UTC,Whats your favorite flavor from evaperated?
Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,br4d24,2,Tue Apr 28 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"If I had to pick just one I would have to say Nevermore. Easy ADV for me. Thus far: there isn't a single flavour I have gotten from them that wasn't awesome. If you are thinking about placing an order - I would suggest trying Nevermore, Blue Sky Bitch!, Mana Biscuit, and Patient Zero.  I recommend trying everything, but the ones I listed are on my Re-Order list.  So far from this new order I have tried cloud 69, tropi-candy, sinister grape, and Bluchie. All of which are great. I can only imagine what a couple weeks of steeping is going to do."
Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,dotvapes,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:23:07 2015 UTC,Well shit... I guess I gotta try some out when I got some extra cash to buy some juice online (local shop hooks me up nicely so online is more pricey)

Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,demon1102,2,Tue Apr 28 02:23:36 2015 UTC,Right out of the mail it is really good. The flavour definitely matches the description. The cheesecake aspect is just enough to give it that back-end sweetness. Overall I am happy I ordered it - time will tell if it becomes a re-order. I run a different flavour every day so we'll see where it lands in the rotation. I'm still going through all my stuff from SZ Vapor (shoutout to /r/setzRFD) and I'm having a tough time putting Lemonlight down.
Canadian_ecigarette,343jvm,abacacus,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:32:57 2015 UTC,Bluchie only gets better and better. That and Hannibal Nectar are my favorite. But I love all of Evaperated juices.

Apparently better without milk* Gen.Grunts Vanilla Custard (Veryone raves about this, imho it's good but maybe a little over hyped * Moocho Grande (Like this one the best and I reordered again) * Big Tasty (As a freebie and also enjoyed this one a lot.)  I also bought Mutha Jugz and Queenside which are both quite good. All in all I haven't had any that I think are ""unvapable"" If you see something in the flavour profiles you like, I dont think you're not going to like it. All have great flavour and the price is right 30ml 9.99-10.99 60ml 18.99-19.99. These juices are now my go to.

Canadian_ecigarette,3424ek,dotvapes,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:36:20 2015 UTC,Plastic tank is a deal breaker imo. Not to mention it's all one piece if your tank does break you'll have to replace the whole unit.

Canadian_ecigarette,33y3on,TheVaporist,2,Sun Apr 26 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"One great thing about vaping is that you can really taper down your nicotine intake at your own speed. If you measure carefully enough, you could cut that 18mg down in such small increments and so gradually that you'd probably never notice the dosage lowering. Just a thought, if that's something you'd still like to try to accomplish.   Congratulations!"
Canadian_ecigarette,33y3on,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:11:24 2015 UTC,That is the best route to take if you want to quit nicotine.   An upside from all those new sub-ohm tanks is that you start a lot lower than you would if you were on good old clearos. Downside is you consume more juice.
Canadian_ecigarette,33y3on,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"I managed to get down to 3mg without any pain or suffering using last-gen clearos, but others have not been so lucky. Higher-wattage, lower-resistance vaping certainly would make it easier to transition to lower-nic juice as in the kind of builds I'm using these days, I definitely don't vape as often as I used to on lower-wattage, higher-resistance atomizer heads."

Canadian_ecigarette,33ysaj,SteepedMonkeyBrains,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:49:34 2015 UTC,The only thing that worked for me was vaping something completely different from my typical preference. I tried to 'shock' my taste buds. I love sweet vapes so I picked up a somewhat bitter cherry vape and used it exclusively for a day. That worked for myself but YMMV.  I love to keep changing flavours so hopefully that is at least part of the reason I haven't experienced it now in over 3 months.

I loved it, it was fantastic. Then one night I went to bed, woke up in the morning and grabbed my vape and it was like white noise in my mouth. I couldn't make out anything whatsoever, and everytime I tried coming back to that flavour it was the same deal. Others would try it and taste it just fine and enjoy it, but I simply couldn't taste the blood anymore tear  I don't know what happened to the bottle, I may have given it away. I tried at it for weeks."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ysaj,IridiumForte,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:21:22 2015 UTC,Wow that's actually pretty strange. My vape tongue is for a whole array of different flavours though which is what I don't understand.

Anytime my vape tastes off I usually brush my tongue with my orabrush and/or go to a different flavour.   Let us know what helps you!
Canadian_ecigarette,33ysaj,kemekokitten,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:52:24 2015 UTC,I actually can taste my vape again today! I dont know if it was just timing or something but I took a fairly hot and steamy shower and right as I got out I tried my vape again and I could taste it.

(not what I taste) anyways few days ago I was vaping it and getting nothing everything tasted bland or off. It went away after a few days, I switched what I was vaping too.

I used to get it a lot when I first started vaping. For months. It only happens now if I'm congested (sick/allergies) or too many beers to taste anything, lol.  Try switching your flavors up throughout the day. Can also try coffee. Or high-citrus juice (this worked well for me). Maybe some menthol."

Canadian_ecigarette,33x8pb,kemekokitten,4,Sun Apr 26 14:46:02 2015 UTC,I own Eleaf iStick 30w and have never had this issue. I will do my best to help u !
Canadian_ecigarette,33x8pb,yuqixing,2,Mon Apr 27 03:38:37 2015 UTC,Do you happen to work for that company? You seem to post about it a lot
Canadian_ecigarette,33x8pb,rush68,3,Mon Apr 27 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"I had an iStick 30w and started experiencing pretty much the same issue you describe. It wouldn't turn on, despite having charged battery, until it was connected to USB power. However once that started happening to me, I also started getting a lot of autofiring issues (iStick would fire without fire button being pressed). I also found if I repeatedly did the 5-press of the power button over and over, the device would randomly turn on, on like the 50th consecutive attempt.  In my opinion, the issues began shortly after I had a subtank leak on me. I've read a lot of people having issues when e-liquid gets into the device, specifically because the electronic components / fire button housing are directly underneath where the atomizer sits, so it's like the first contact for any leaking juice.  I've heard that cracking it open and cleaning the circuitry with a qtip & alcohol resolves the issue, but I just gave up on the iStick and got a Sigelei Mini and haven't had any issues since, even with the odd tank leak or two."

Canadian_ecigarette,33x8pb,RobertDF902,2,Mon Apr 27 22:03:45 2015 UTC,I think its a protection function for shorts. It's happened once or twice with my 50w when I accidentally shorted a coil while firing. Just plug it in and it resets the board.

Canadian_ecigarette,33uxon,Hubatola,7,Sat Apr 25 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this Hubatola.  Reading this is incredibly depressing, I can't even try to sugar coat my emotions. We've all come so far and many of us have fought hard to show our struggle and how e-cigarettes have liberated us from analogs. It's disheartening that regardless of the amount of evidence, personal testimonies, or even just common sense have no effect on the liberal government.  Randy Hillier has been amazing to watch and follow during these discussions, I hope we can all keep pressing forward any way we can. It will be incredibly difficult to bring others into our community if this bill passes without amendments.  For all of you who living in Ontario who are still just waiting to see what happens, please let this be your wake up call. This bill will make your local B&M unable to discuss or help you with your products or show newbies the best way to set up their first e-cigarette. We will all be delegated to online only sources for our information, and a big group of people do not feel comfortable making online purchases. This alienates many Canadians who we won't be able to reach out to unless they actively seek us out, which may lead to avoidable smoking related deaths.  Take the time to follow Mr Hillier's advice. If you need any help wording your opinion or with anything else please send us a message, we'll be here to help you any way we can."
Canadian_ecigarette,33uxon,VaporNorth,3,Sat Apr 25 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same way. Let down by the very people who are supposed to have our best interests at heart. Common sense is obviously not that common!  I only recently was able to walk away from 36 years of smoking servitude ONLY because of vaping. Nothing else worked for me! And now I fell like the carpet is being pulled out from under my feet. Not to even begin to mention the smokers who may never get the same opportunity that I had in dealing with a patient and knowledgeable B & M. It's really discouraging.   For all of you who living in Ontario who are still just waiting to see what happens, please let this be your wake up call.    This is your time folks - make sure your voice is heard! It's so incredibly easy today to contact any of the above mentioned. Take Brett up on his offer if you need any assistance in making sure the message gets through loudly and clearly. Please don't let this be an 'I wish I would have done something' moment in your life!"

I started vaping in December and from the moment I bought my first vape I quit smoking (without actually intending to or trying at all). I would be extremely disappointed and would feel very little trust in a government who would deny others the same opportunity that I had."
Canadian_ecigarette,33uxon,VaporNorth,2,Sat Apr 25 23:15:42 2015 UTC,"The decision does affect all of Canada as other provinces might use Ontario's legislation as a base for their own. Nova Scotia has passed the most e-cigarette friendly bill to date but it seems like Ontario didn't care.  You'd be best to get your own movement started in Alberta getting friends and family to contact their local MPP's. There's not much you can do for Ontario without living here as you don't belong to any MPP's riding so they don't speak for you.  Do your best to get the ball rolling in your province, short term we can't help each other but if Federal legislation becomes involved who knows what changes we'll see."

It's overtaken our personal lives, but that's okay!  I don't do anything but work anyways twirl  I'm on the prowl for future locations which will allow me to have room to hire employees and have much more space on hand.  Funny thing is I already have a handful of people that want to work for us when we get there, so it should be a fairly smooth transition to bigger production."

If you like a STRONG licorice/menthol flavor, (like me) roid rage is good, pretty intense juice. Vader pudding was pretty good vanilla custard. On the caramel side there's slippery Irishman and the DSV RY4. Tobacco, I've tried maple leaf blend, which is kinda menthol tobacco mix and wildfire tobacco and the latter has become my favorite tobacco flavor"

I'm like, ""Well, in Canada it is...""  But yeah, I'm assuming the majority of people search for ""vapor"", so it makes sense to spell it that way to be more relevant in searches."

If i could see more people commenting on Tweaker, not just wanting it but giving solid reviews of it i'd feel more keen on paying for it. but most /u/evaperated reviews i've seen are for other flavours and very few vape mails i've seen have it in there."
Canadian_ecigarette,33qm3j,dotvapes,2,Fri Apr 24 20:42:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you wanted to be cost efficient, you could always grab a 5x10mL sample pack which qualifies you for the free 30mL  ,then grab 5 flavours including 4 popular ones and that, then a 30mL of a flavour of your choice that you think you'd enjoy no matter what :D. Cool promotion they have going on!"

Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,augustinet,2,Sat Apr 25 06:00:37 2015 UTC,http://premiumlabs.ca/  Premium Labs offers the DR Fog line of MAX VG. I've only had the dragon fruit and it was super amazing flavor and vapor. Blind Pig Vapors is also a great HIGH VG line. The Capone is my favorite from them.

Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,demon1102,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:16:00 2015 UTC,"Their business was wholesale only  Due to lots of requests, they start selling their to the public only two weeks ago.

Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,Adolph_Bernanke,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:54:23 2015 UTC,how are they overall? i really want to try they're juices but before I commit to buying 5 bottles just want to be sure they are at least decent. Would you recommend the flavours you got?
Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,demon1102,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:38:14 2015 UTC,I'm satisfied with my five bottles (The Big Vape; The Docks; Nothin' but the Toque & Straight Outta Kamloops)  I think it's worth to buy  (flavor is subjective)

Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,sonz,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:28:12 2015 UTC,Well if you browse this sub you may have noticed there is a huge hype about Evaperated. You can choose the ratio for those and all of them I have tried so far have been good. In fact I have another order on the way.  Another vendor you should definitely check out is Vancouver Island Premium [vipejuice.com] Their juice is a major hit on the island and I highly suggest checking them out. They just rolled out the max vg line and they have knocked it out of the park once again.
Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,zechsterror,1 point,Sat Apr 25 08:04:15 2015 UTC,I've actually tried the evaperated juice and liking the patient zero juice a lot. The only downside of that's is that it pretty much taste like half the juice that i own atm. But thanks for the advice! I'm going to head over to the vipejucie right meow!
Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,pixiedustvapes,2,Sat Apr 25 08:57:29 2015 UTC,"Try SZVapor, really unique flavors in my opinion. Just placed a second order. Took some steeping (Mean Frean) and me adjusting to them, but damn, now I really like them. I liked Lemonlight instantly.  Lemonlight, Mean Frean and Cobbletsone Cream Try em. www.szvapor.com"
Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,demon1102,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:57:10 2015 UTC,btw have you tried the max vg line? if so what flavor and what do you think about( pros and cons please =p)
Canadian_ecigarette,33sni8,CuBu,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:04:59 2015 UTC,The Blueballer is the only blueberry I have tried that won't gunk up my coils in a few hours and still tastes great.  KV2 is a major favorite out here. I went through a 30 ml in 48 hours flat.  Port Renfrew Pudding is another good one. Butterscotch caramel pudding and delicious.  Nanner Bread is as close as you can get to banana bread it's unreal.  He should also be rolling out a ton of new flavors soon. He was at the local vape meet last night and had about 5 new flavors that aren't online yet. All of them fantastic.

I suppose I'll eventually break down and go that route but was hoping to find a case that would not involve assembly when I wanted to vape.  Or maybe just use something like a cigar tube maybe.

Canadian_ecigarette,33ofvp,kootenaygal,2,Fri Apr 24 04:48:51 2015 UTC,I'd probably get one of those portable solar powerbanks. ~$70 though.
Canadian_ecigarette,33ofvp,RobertDF902,2,Fri Apr 24 04:52:03 2015 UTC,My friend just bought one of those power bank things so he can take his vaporizer camping with him.  (Also for road trips on his motorcycle since there isn't a thing to plug in like inside of a car.)  Personally I would want to get one of the solar powered ones.  It makes more sense to me.
Canadian_ecigarette,33ofvp,lilfunky1,2,Fri Apr 24 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"I've put a lot of thought into this. Campground trips will be easy so long as you conserve what you have and monitor your batteries voltage. 12.6v is a fully charged car bat. Drop much below 12.2 and your not going home... YMMV  My wife and I have recently got heavily into canoe camping. This will be our first summer vaping and I am very concerned about being limited by my current lithium dependence. I currently suck a 26650 flat in a day. My appetites have grown to 5+ ml's per day and for week or longer trips that kind of weight is prohibitive over long portages.  The best hope I've found so far is this I don't place much hope in solar yet, all reasonably priced panels I've seen simply don't give enough charge to justify the hassle. Seems to me if you're traveling during the day, or the weather is poor, you are SOL. I'm backing Blue Freedom and highly suggest you do too if this could work for you. This thing is pretty awesome and charges at a rate far more interesting to me.  Asides from that I plan to only use 18650 and higher resistance coils to conserve as much as possible. I don't use tanks, looks like I may have to settle. My wife doesn't go through near as much juice as I do and her istick 50 goes weeks between charges."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ofvp,MaddogBC,2,Fri Apr 24 14:58:01 2015 UTC,"If you can charge your device through USB, get one of the charging bricks for cell phones.  I have  dual USB one, and if i charge it fully, i can charge my phone up twice fully.  Im sure it could charge a vape pretty easily too."

If you have an 18650 flashlight (camping right?), you have extra batteries for it also. Acts as a battery case If it no longer hold a charge, change the battery only."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ofvp,TheVaporist,2,Fri Apr 24 22:28:48 2015 UTC,I'm going to the tall tree music festival so I'm buying a mod next week and just bringing extra charged batteries.

Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,kootenaygal,2,Fri Apr 24 06:22:26 2015 UTC,"I saw some sage advice from a fellow redditor once that has stuck with me. When it comes to vape setups, one is none and two is one. If you're tempted to go back and concerned that you'll be without a functional device, a spare is absolutely not a bad idea. Be it an eGo or an MVP 2.0 or a Sigelei 150w...whatever suits your preferences, vaping style and budget is the right one for you."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,kkeeiiggaann,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:07:12 2015 UTC,"First off - good for you! You are past the toughest part and now just need to fine tune what works best for you. For a lot of us I believe this means increased and dependable battery life.   one is none and two is one   Words of wisdom right there! The only times I have come even close to smoking, in my four months without, is when I didn't have my vape ready to go. What's most important to me now is not putting myself in that situation ever again. I don't leave home today without two sources of battery power and also several tanks as I like to change flavours frequently. Seeing as I can actually taste them now."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,Hubatola,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:28:48 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you except it's been about 10 days for me so congrats.   I've wasted alot of money on the evod starter kit then a not so good battery and a bunch of money on juices but in the long run I will save alot of money and the end result is off cigarettes.   I recently bought two nautilus mini tank and love em. Yesterday I bought the mvp 3 and that seems amazing so far.   Good luck and here's to being smoke free forever.
Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,nitelifedj,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:53:54 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean! It is always good to have a spare, I have 2 50w devices 2 sub tanks and an MVP with a 2 nautilus as a back up. If you think you might venture into subohm I might try and find a device 30w and up. That being said an MVP is a good device, easy to charge, battery last for days and it has all the settings you need.   If anyone is looking for a new device that 11w fits there needs I would totally suggest getting one."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,RWTF,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, an MVP 2.0 would be a solid purchase for you I think, along with a spare tank if you don't already have one. Makes it far easier to quit when you aren't worried about your battery dying and leaving you vapeless."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,abacacus,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:14:52 2015 UTC,"Dooooo it :) MVP's are great devices and built like tanks. An MVP 20W is also very good, higher max wattage and flush mount 510 connector and similarly priced."

It's like having a backup mod but for only 10$"
Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,Tript-G,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:56:28 2015 UTC,"this hobby can get quite expensive but how much is your health really worth?  My moments of relapse came when I didn't have any coils or a functioning device so I always make sure to have a backup and have gone into rebuildables so I don't have to worry about keeping a steady supply of prebuilt coils. You will make mistakes and purchase stuff you won't use for long, but the good thing is you can always give that stuff away to people who want to try vaping.  The MVP2 is a good device and you certainly won't be replacing it until you get into subohm low resistance builds."
Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,sansaset,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:27:16 2015 UTC,"If I were you, just for ease of use, I'd buy a nunchaku (up to 18w twist device). I am not sure what you are using now but it is a great looking battery and similar price.   Also, the istick 20 is a popular go to :)"

Canadian_ecigarette,33ooi8,Sens420,0,Mon May 11 22:25:04 2015 UTC,I'd skip the v2.0 and get something that is 30W and can fire down to 0.5ohm. Just to save yourself another purchase in the very near future.

Canadian_ecigarette,33nnc5,arberbeq,3,Fri Apr 24 02:25:44 2015 UTC,Sure I'll share my thoughts about them!   Ice Berry - Very minty and cooling inhale and lots of berry on the exhale very good juice!  Skittles - Tastes exactly how it's named like a handful of skittles. Very good fruity juice.  Hawaiian Punch - Another juice that tastes exactly how it's named. Very good but the worst of the 3 I ordered.  I've only tried one of the two unreleased samples I received and I forget the name of it but like I said it tastes exactly like watermelon jolly ranchers.  I don't review juices that much but I hope this helped. Another good juice vender with good juices is DSV Creations from Saskatchewan.

Canadian_ecigarette,33mr2g,XxMegatr0nxX,4,Thu Apr 23 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's already passed. but If I'm reading this act correctly they just banned ovens and soup.  By defining e-cig as anything /capable/ of of vaporising an esubstance and then classifying anything that can be vaporized regardless of nic content as an esubstance... I think they have technically banned everything capable of producing heat... because if you use your oven indoors you are vaporising your soup... sorry e-substance.  So maybe it can be challenged and repealed.  ""e-cigarette"" means the following:  (a) a product or device, whether or not it resembles a cigarette, containing an electronic or battery-powered heating element capable of vapourizing an e-substance for inhalation or release into the air;  (b) a prescribed product or device similar in nature or use to a product or device described in paragraph (a);  ""e-substance"" means a solid, liquid or gas  (a) that, on being heated, produces a vapour for use in an e-cigarette, regardless of whether the solid, liquid or gas contains nicotine, and  (b) that is not a controlled substance within the meaning of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada);  ""vapour product"" means the following:  (a) an e-cigarette;  (b) an e-substance;  (c) a cartridge for or a component of an e-cigarette."

We started talking after I noticed a crappy ""ego kit for $69.50 from a B&M"" at his work area so I asked. He sheepishly said he's trying to quit smoking (remember, he has access to all the pharma stuff - champix, patches, gums etc, and he's using a vape stick!) and said it wasn't quite working for him and that the ego / clearomizer rig he was running (and paid WAY TOO MUCH FOR!) wasn't great, neither were the B&M's juices.  I pulled out the iStick 30w, Subtank mini rig I was running, took his drip tip, put it on mine, said ""have a go"". Eyes poppin' ;) Got him to buy a nice kit from Vaporist (iStick 30w, Subtank mini, coils, juice sampler) and we'll see how that does him.

Canadian_ecigarette,33n4n9,sansaset,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:04:03 2015 UTC,Yeah dude that's the main problem with the Goblin I got. The screw has a fucked up last thread and I don't think it sits flush in the fill port. It's fucking brutal how badly it leaks on my Sigelei and I really hope the shop I bought it from will replace it tomorrow.  Yeah the posts on the Goliath are a bit strange but I was hoping the machining and QC would be better on it so it wouldn't leak!

Canadian_ecigarette,33myv8,ilikeycoffee,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:14:31 2015 UTC,"Agree with @robertDF902 on the e-rolls. I'm not a fan of the lower end Joyetech stuff myself (I think it's overpriced) but it'll still be cheaper than long term use of Blu, and you have options (like using much higher quality juices).   I get liking the experience of a cigalike - it's how I quit smoking 4yr ago! - but man... those flavors in blu - didn't like them 3+ years ago, would probably retch if I tried them today. So many more fantastic flavours - even realistic tasting tabacky flavours if you want (I can give you a list to try!) and with an e-roll (or also look up 808D systems) you can refill yourself!  Here's another suggestion though that maybe you haven't considered. Another Joyetech product - the ego ONE in the 1100mah size. It's about the length of an analog cig, but fatter. Huge, huge taste improvement though, and if you don't want to sub ohm and get all huge clouds and stuff, they have 1.2ohm coils too, which still taste fantastic. It's the setup I bought my highly resistant (to quitting, or adopting vaping) brother who smokes, and I think it may work with him. You can find them for around $50ish (try Eastside Vapes, out of Vancouver, they do mail order). Buy a box of 1.2ohm coils too, that setup should last you like 2-3months or longer, especially if you take care of the coils (pre-juice them before firin' up).  Best of luck in your search mate! Anything to keep the analogs away."

Canadian_ecigarette,33izpi,abacacus,6,Wed Apr 22 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"""the studies show that the youths who are already as risk of smoking, such as growing up around other smokers, are the ones most likely to use e-cigarettes anyways.""   This and a few other reasons are exactly why I started vaping without ever being a smoker. I knew I liked smoking from my experiences with smoking weed but I didn't want to ever touch a cigarette due to having seen my mother quitting them and the fact she always smelled of them.   Thus I started vaping. I can't imagine why I'd ever touch a cigarette when I can do oh so much more with vaping."

If you decide to start playing with RDAs in the future, you can always get a cheaper box mod that makes use of your batteries.  In Canada, I know that www.canvape.com and www.dashvapes.com sell them.  Good luck, let us know if you have any more questions.  Not sure of shops in your area, but you can find it online from"
Canadian_ecigarette,33l0tq,metricvaper,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'd would definitely agree! I went from a set-up like yours to a 30 watt iStick just looking for longer battery life. While it was definitely better, it still wasn't lasting me through the day. I have a very mobile job so charging on the go isn't always a practical option for myself.  So I grabbed a 50 watt iStick about 2 weeks ago and am delighted with the battery life! I have gone 3 days without charging and it just chugs along. While Eleaf certainly doesn't have the best reputation for build quality or customer service, it fills my requirements perfectly.  I have completely stopped worrying about running out of battery power and I am grateful to have one less thing to worry about. On to the flavours!"
Canadian_ecigarette,33l0tq,Hubatola,2,Thu Apr 23 12:29:51 2015 UTC,"I know you asked about the battery, but you'll need to look at the tank as well.  The coils on the nautilus mini have a voltage limit that is going to max out at between 15-17 watts.  (they may still work above that but you'll burn them out fast.)  You should look at grabbing a Kayfun of some sort, or, if you'd prefer to stick with stock coils, a subtank mini, Delta 2, freemax starre, Atlantis etc"
Canadian_ecigarette,33l0tq,ZorroElite,2,Thu Apr 23 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"I'd point you at the MVP 2.0 ot 3.0. Internal battery, plenty of power for your tank.  Avoid the iStick 50. It has major issues with QC that can result in the mod autofiring until it starts a fire."
Canadian_ecigarette,33l0tq,abacacus,2,Thu Apr 23 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, be very careful with the Istick products until you can get assurances that they won't autofire in your pocket and hurt you.   Spend the extra couple of dollars and get something reputable.   For you, the MVP 3.0 might be enough."
Canadian_ecigarette,33l0tq,midelus,2,Thu Apr 23 17:10:06 2015 UTC,I know you said locally but if you can wait a few weeks I'd recommend the following....I have all three and can vouch they work great. *Protank 3 *Subtank Nano *Smok xpro-m80  I actually have the Smok m45 but for less than $10 you get another 35 watts and double the battery life...
Canadian_ecigarette,33l0tq,Deeewayne,0,Thu Apr 23 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"If youre from halifax i would suggest dropping into vapor hub, theyre quite friendly and would likely be happy to help you out. I personally used the istick 20w for quite some time with no issues at all and the istick 50 has treated me well since i bought it, which would have some serious battery length if you're running at low wattage."

Looks like you are using almost the minimum amount of wicking? And then 'fanning' it out on both ends?
Canadian_ecigarette,33j0d6,floss-daily,2,Wed Apr 22 23:13:49 2015 UTC,Exactly! The cotton itself a is fairly dense in the sense that it is nice and snug in the coil - then I just trim the wicks short and fan it out so it fills the space above and around the juice channels.  I unroll a ball of cotton in to a strip and use about 2/3 the width of the strip. This coil is 3mm so it takes a lot of cotton.

That being said if it was scanned in to Richmond on Friday, there's a chance it didn't leave until Monday. Do you have an Estimated Delivery Date in your tracking information?"
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,cbg79,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"No, I've been waiting on my first evaperated package since april 8. Yes, you read that right. Expected delivery date was the 17th, which is ridiculous enough in the first place, but it still hasn't arrived and shows as being in Richmond on the tracker.  Canada post is such an absolute embarrassment, why do vendors keep using them??"
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,pancakemixes,2,Thu Apr 23 17:18:08 2015 UTC,I'm going to blame Richmond. Because Richmond.
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,omgvivid,2,Thu Apr 23 17:34:15 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you. Mine still has the Richmond status and delivery standard was April 16.

They have tons of the premium US brands, and you can sample all of them for free. Also, most of their prices on hardware are the cheapest in the city, and sometimes even matches US online prices. It's wayyy in the NE though.  Oh also, evaperated is seriously good juice (they also sell it for the same price at digital imports, which is nice so you can try it first)."

Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,paleking2,3,Fri Apr 24 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Flavour is so subjective that I am hesitant to make recommendations. Having said that, I can vouch for quality, consistency and popularity among several brands that I've vaped. In no particular order, a couple vendors I would highly recommend:  SZVapor  Ponyboy (available onine at JGVapes)  As far as these vendors go, they're among the very best Canadian juice I've ever sampled. They're simply head and shoulders above the rest, and you really can't go wrong. If you're looking for suggestions in specific flavours to try, I'm happy to help...just ask...but as I mentioned before, flavour is extremely subjective. What I love, you may not enjoy.   Also, these vendors all have a reddit presence (/u/setzRFD, /u/PonyboyVapes, /u/JGVapes).  I highly doubt that you would find either brand to be sub-par, and all of those vendors have spectacular customer service in every experience that I've ever had with them. If you can't find what you're looking for in their selection, I'd be very surprised...but I'd also be happy to provide further recommendations. Quality and variety are next to none in these brands, though, and as such I suspect that if you were to sample their lines (as /u/setzRFD has so generously offered to allow you to do on the house -- the man is a saint, I tells ya), I am confident that you will find yourself extremely satisfied."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,joekerr37,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:03:40 2015 UTC,I like raspberry and strawberry types. Citrus types. Nothing liquorice. Fav candy is fuzzy peaches. I did check out the website and flavour they offered some do sound pretty good. I'm a bit scared they'd be a bit sweet for an ADV. I am gonna take them up on the offer of course. Not huge on overly sweet flavours when it comes to anything really.   A good fruit lemonade would be good. With lemon being more dominate.
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,ilikeycoffee,3,Thu Apr 23 09:13:06 2015 UTC,"I love raspberry, strawberry and citrus vapes too. Especially citrus. SZVapor's citrus/licorice blend caused me some apprehension before ordering, but now that I've got it in my hands I'm absolutely smitten. I wish I ordered 120ml...my 30ml only has a bit left and I'm conserving it greedily. I absolutely do not like black licorice, but this is an accent...an undertone that delivers an intoxicating complexity on the exhale that really takes the citrus notes to a whole new dimension. I will be vaping this one for a long time to come.   Don't take my word for it, though. Go with your gut...if you don't think you'll like it, I would hate to think you tried something you weren't interested in because I gushed over it. I really, really love it...it is a grown-up vape, complex but subtle and intricately balanced.  On the lemonade front, I would suggest seeking out Premium Labs' lines. A shop has been stocking them in my city for the past few months, and I've vaped through tons of their flavours. Some of the first that I vaped were their Ever Cloud (60/40 vg/pg) Strawberry Lemonade and Dr. Fog (70/30, I believe) Freckled Lemonade. They're both quite nice, though if memory serves, the Ever Cloud version had a more prominent lemonade flavour than the Dr. Fog.  As for Ponyboy, these guys sold me my very first hardware and juice. They really set me off to a great start in vaping, and I was spoiled for having tried their line first. Make Out Point was my first ADV, and I had the pleasure of finally vaping it again recently. It is exactly as I remembered it...delicately sweet melon flavour that seems to have subtle, soft accents that make it even sexier than melon alone. Not too sweet by any means. If you have a chance to sample it, I'd highly recommend you do so...unless you're not a melon fan. Given that we have berry and citrus in common, though, I figured I'd put it out there for your consideration."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,AnarchoElk,2,Thu Apr 23 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"With lemon being more dominate.   Then you must try Lemonlight from SZ! The lemon is obviously the main highlight, but it's wrapped expertly around a buttery cheesecake. I usually hate all things lemon, but have been devouring this.   Fav candy is fuzzy peaches.   SZ's Triple P is a combination of peach, pear and plums. To me the major one coming through was peaches. Another extremely well crafted juice!  And how cool is it that our vendors make these amazing offers? There isn't a more welcoming, warm hearted sub-reddit on this entire site, in my experience."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,joekerr37,3,Thu Apr 23 10:28:38 2015 UTC,"I've since made my recommendations, but am posting here to second the vote for Lemonlight. I'll see that nomination and raise you a Mean Frean, raspberry in perfect harmonious balance with buttery cookie and soft, creamy filling. Both are spectacular and in line with /u/Winter_knights' preferences."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,theferrousarchive,0,Thu Apr 23 20:14:20 2015 UTC,"""The Shocker"" by Cosmic Fog is the best lemonade juice I've had.  Strawberry / Lemonade - and the lemonade is by far the dominant flavour.  I get it from Switch in Beaumont. (admittedly a 3 hour drive from you)  http://www.switchvaporhouse.com/"
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,Hubatola,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"are you sure it's not your atty thats the problem? Like do you have other juices that vape fine?  Also, when you smell the ejuice does it smell good? Usually smell is a pretty good indicator of how it will vape.   I make my own juice and if they smell good they almost always taste good.   With vendors though they add other things to the juices, so that could be an issue if those ingredients dont vaporize properly."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,deathdragon5858,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:49:01 2015 UTC,Yes I'm sure I have a nautilus mini and a aerotank v2 for tanks. I've tried new coils just to make sure they weren't burnt. The raspberry lemonade was good just seemed to need more lemon flavour. My fav juice was Wild West by Vaporous but it's 20 bucks per 30 ml bottle at a B&M that I refuse to support because they are overpriced on everything and their website doesn't advertise prices.
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,sansaset,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:56:10 2015 UTC,"are you pre-saturating your nautilus coils? Those need them. The aerotank coils not so much, but couldn't hurt either."

I've heard conflicting suggestions about lower/higher wattages.  Any suggestion? I came into vaping thinking I'd love the creamy flavours the most, and I'm almost all fruity/mint because creams are scaring me off. Steeping didn't seem to help much either, since I know that can be an issue with creams."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,Lampburglar,2,Thu Apr 23 07:58:21 2015 UTC,"ya creams are a bit different than other flavors in terms of smell equaling taste. There are a lot of bad tasting creams out there for some reason.   I don't have any vendor selections, but lorann's cheesecake and FA's french vanilla  and Flavor West Vanilla bean are all good ""creamy"" flavors in the DIY world. But even then, they are just ""good"" not mind blowing or anything."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,Lampburglar,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:58:09 2015 UTC,"It takes a bit of hoarding and planning but the best juice is all online, basically. That generic stuff from most b&ms (at least the few I've ventured in to) is all really sub-par."
Canadian_ecigarette,33k7zr,TheVaporist,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"What's your nicotine level?   In my experience, all B & M's samples are at zero nic. So, anything above that will definitely hit harder and somewhat change the taste. It can also have a peppery, burnt taste if it's not of the highest quality.  Also if you have recently moved into sub-ohming, lowering your nicotine level is an absolute must!"

It's juicy fruit gum. 75/25 is the ratio but a couple of the east coast flavours may become my new go to ones."

Apparition has pleasantly surprised me. I got it as an extra 10mil(Evaperated are super awesome for this crazy deal they have) as an oddity. The only other coffee flavour I've tried was Cappuchino from DVine, which was unvapeable. I thought the flavours might not mech well but they do.  Zephyr I'm going to give some more time to. At first I forgot what it was supposed to taste like and couldn't figure it out. I checked online but the store was down for maintenance. I could definitely taste an orangey taste, but I wasn't sure.

Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,Hubatola,4,Wed Apr 22 20:33:40 2015 UTC,"naaaaah, and i totally dont do this all day when its out for delivery"

Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,MaddogBC,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:48:57 2015 UTC,LMAO I've actually taken the day off work and sat home quietly listening for his van...  That's a great gif.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,javagnome,2,Thu Apr 23 05:36:36 2015 UTC,Im really bad for that. I dont close the tab on my computer and I sneak back to it several times during the day to check. I had a package due to be delivered this morning and I got tired of going back to refresh so I sighned up for email notifications to come to my tablet.... and then I just kept refreshing my email.   Edited for spelling.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,abacacus,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:53:05 2015 UTC,That sounds painfully familiar.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,Raztrop,2,Wed Apr 22 18:02:51 2015 UTC,Yep. That's me.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,MaddogBC,2,Wed Apr 22 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"I'm completely obsessive with that. I will literally check that tracking page like 4 times an hour, even while at work."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,autourbanbot,2,Wed Apr 22 18:11:22 2015 UTC,There is something more to the ritual. I often place a few orders together and this behaviour is normal and pleasurable. First thing I look forward to when my eyes open. I suffer from shinyitis. Hello my name is Maddog...
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,dennistein,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:34:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of Shinyitis :      When you feel a compulsion to acquire a new and shiny gadget. Of course you don't need it, you already have lots and lots of gadgets. But you want something new and you want it in your hands now, to turn over and admire and fondle.  The term originated on the vaping forums. Vaping is the (sometimes obsessive) utilisation of electronic cigarettes.     Examples, each and every one a genuine quote from the forums.  1) Just watch out for the ""new"" illness... shinyitis... early symptoms creep up on you when you see a nice new shiny bit of kit and suddenly paypal appears on your screen, you lose all control of your finger hovering over the mouse button and then spend the following days wondering why the post is so late as you pace up and down. Beware, there is no cure!  2) That looks good! And it's got the same kind of curved tube as the Picollo, which means the Kayfun should sit nicely on it... Aaarrgghhh! Mad shinyitis!  3) Shinyitis is a disease and a constant flow of shiny tube mods is the cure.  4) Ohh, no. Shinyitis, another excuse to buy a Mech mod.  5) Been vaping for 4 weeks and I am having circulation problems in my bank account......oh hang on, that's shinyitis.  6) I just ordered & am waiting for the chrome one, don't know why... like the idea of the dark chrome also... Ahhh, think I caught shinyitis.  7) Then the shinyitis starts kicking in... amazing how much more pleasure it gives you... waiting for the postie to bring your new purchase.  8) God! Shinyitis is creeping up on me. It's hand is on me shoulder......too late!  9) Shinyitis is addictive... it'll cost ya a bloody small fortune... if you catch the dreaded shinyitis.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,AnarchoElk,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:35:19 2015 UTC,There is a name for it. We should create a support group. Shinyitus Anonymous. Helping vapers not obsess over new gear.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,dennistein,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:08:31 2015 UTC,"Normally I don't care, it comes when it comes (especially if package is coming from overseas).  But this battery order from fasttech is killing me!  Been two months and I'm checking the tracking number atleast a dozen times a day hoping to see an update."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,REOCrackwagon,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"I heard battery orders were terrible for fasttech(something about not allowing them to be shipped via air?) , so I found a Canadian company to buy the batteries and bought the mods from fasttech lol. So now I have some batteries, but I'm waiting on those mods."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hy0a,Lampburglar,2,Wed Apr 22 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"LOL, i'm in the opposite situation.  Bought batteries ahead of time.  Figured I'd have tons of time to figure out what mod I wanted to get.  Well, ordered and received all my stuff.  Batteries still not here."

Canadian_ecigarette,33hr34,SpyderVapes,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"probably clones since they are cheaper, not looking for anything high in the price range maybe $40 tops all together hopefully with a battery"

Canadian_ecigarette,33im44,ZorroElite,3,Wed Apr 22 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think I'm the only one that doesn't go crazy for Evaperated. It's too sweet for me, and the lacks subtlety. My wicks are almost always destroyed after a couple hours of vaping it. It's affordable, and the vendor is a good member of the community but it's not the best juice I've ever had."
Canadian_ecigarette,33im44,tommytw0time,2,Thu Apr 23 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"Many of the juices I don't particularly care for, but I have a very picky palette.  However the ones I do love, I love them ALL DAY LONG!  Try others..."

Canadian_ecigarette,33im44,MaddogBC,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:16:55 2015 UTC,If I'm lucky... this size bottle might mean some of it has time to steep.

Canadian_ecigarette,33im44,sansaset,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yes me too, I haven't given it a fair shake though, it was rapidly tossed into the ""not alpha blood"" pile. :)"
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,javagnome,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:50:43 2015 UTC,My last few orders have been quick. I placed an order on the 17th it's already clearded Canadian customs and the expected delivery date is the 27th so they seem to be getting better
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,eastcoastfog,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:54:58 2015 UTC,That gives me hope. I ordered a couple of rdas and a cellphone stand for my kid. Everything said it was in stock - I made sure of that. I ordered a silver rda instead of black for example. Your comment gives me hope!
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,reed89,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:20:09 2015 UTC,as long as your order didnt have anything in it that contains batteries then you should be fine. With epacket my orders take about 7 buisness days to arrive
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,kdvjcv,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"Nothing with batteries, just a couple of rdas and a cellphone stand."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,reed89,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"Why does an order with batteries take longer?  Just ordered two iStick 50's from fasttech, assume they count as batteries."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,kdvjcv,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"because they cant ship the batteries by plane, so they have to send them by boat i think"

Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,lilfunky1,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"I've ordered quite a bit from them, some have been quick and some not. The ""Ships in 5 days"" thing is often wrong. I waited three months for a Kraken Genesis. Still worth the wait. They are faster when they already have items in stock."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,didnt_I,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:02:28 2015 UTC,I put my first Fasttech order in on March 20th and picked it up yesterday (been sitting at the post office since Thursday/Friday though.)  I didn't pay extra for the epacket shipping.  Just the regular free shipping.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,Sens420,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:13:20 2015 UTC,My lemo2 just showed up today. Ordered on the 10th. Fastest order yet from fasttech
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,Makir,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:58:27 2015 UTC,10 days
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,greekdude1821,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:28:01 2015 UTC,Usually only 2 weeks waiting. Not to bad. Have had longer getting things shipped in Canada.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,dirtychopstickz,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"I had something shipped from Hong Kong once that took 6 weeks to get here... with a note inside saying once of my items was on back order. It would be shipped out asap. I should be able to survive fasttech, lol."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,Hubatola,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:07:05 2015 UTC,I heard FT is stepping up their shipping game. Aliexpress on the other hand I just finally received my drip tips that took 4 weeks
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,AnarchoElk,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:48:43 2015 UTC,It's really hit or miss in my opinion. I've received my last order from fast tech in 10 business days. It was mailed out on april 10th and I received it April 20th. However I have another order that was mailed April 13th and still has not arrived in Canada. Shouldn't take more than 2 weeks if you use the Epacket though.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,happinessanddisaster,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"I have placed about 6 orders with them at this point, all within the last 4 months. All have been trouble free and arrived very quickly. I am receiving to ON within an average time of 10 days from date of shipment. Pretty damn good in my experience!  I have also had to make a few changes along the way and have been delighted with their customer service. Yes, they are 12 hours ahead so the interaction timing can get a little difficult, but overall I personally give them a high rating.  Also, Customs on our end seems to be extremely fast lately. I have had items cleared through in mere minutes recently, where a while back it could take days. I am unsure if this has anything to do with the Epacket, but regardless, I will continue to happily pay the $2-3 for the expedited service."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,Rudigerger,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"My latest order had some issues. I had to pay an extra 2.50 to split the shipping becaus they said the one mod I ordered would be ready to ship in a few days, then it went to restocking...  So now my shipment sans the mod is on it's way, and it's still sitting in restocking waiting to get shipped as well."
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,happinessanddisaster,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Mine says it left Malaysia en route to Vancouver on April 2 and there are no further updates. I ordered coils, drip tips and o rings. =/"

Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,happinessanddisaster,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:05:16 2015 UTC,I'm just irritated seeing several people here have had orders actually delivered within two weeks and mine hasn't even gotten into customs yet.
Canadian_ecigarette,33hywf,Rudigerger,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"In the same boat lol. Mine was 04-04, still says dispatched to oversees. It's my coil shipment, it really needs to hurry up."
Canadian_ecigarette,33eshl,VaporNorth,2,Tue Apr 21 22:58:42 2015 UTC,I just googled for my MPP. Could someone fill me in on how I should approach the situation so I can try and help out?
Canadian_ecigarette,33eshl,reading_dysfunction,2,Wed Apr 22 00:50:43 2015 UTC,I have her email. I was wondering about what kind of information I should provide and how I should structure my e-mail. I've heard making an appointment and seeing her in person would be a good way of doing it?   Are there any studies that would be good to provide? I don't have a lot of time to start a case from the ground up but if I could give my experiences and decent studies to back my opinion it would help even if a little.
Canadian_ecigarette,33eshl,reading_dysfunction,2,Wed Apr 22 02:42:16 2015 UTC,"I would suggest wording things very formally. I think an in person meeting if you were well spoken and dressed would be an amazing idea due to the greater impact that things said in person have, doubly so when you consider most politicians are old school. I personally didn't cite any studies but it would be a good idea. I did mention the fact that VG and PG are commonly used in many food items though."
Canadian_ecigarette,33eshl,tet5uo,2,Wed Apr 22 04:05:13 2015 UTC,"Hey! Firstly let them know your name and where you live. If they don't know you're in their riding your opinion will be irrelevant to them.     Explain your views on e-cigarettes and make sure to let them know that you feel they aren't representing the values of you and your friends/family in the legislative assembly. Our MP's careers are based on us feeling like we are well represented so it is important to stress the fact that they are going against your wishes, and without directly saying it implying that they don't have your support next time elections are running. Of course be polite, be fair, you're an ambassador for our community. But we need to be firm and let our voices be known with no room for interpretation."
Canadian_ecigarette,33eshl,Hubatola,2,Wed Apr 22 04:10:11 2015 UTC,I'm so depressed. It's clear they have made up their minds and are just waiting for us to stop annoying them so they can make their rules as they want to anyhow.
Canadian_ecigarette,33eshl,iCat3GS,2,Wed Apr 22 14:13:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for the incredibly detailed post!
