beetle,3e6etq,speedfreak27,10,Wed Jul 22 08:48:59 2015 UTC,A classic beetle is only as reliable as the person who maintains and repairs it.
beetle,3e6etq,richcreations,4,Wed Jul 22 08:53:12 2015 UTC,I'm 18 and I used a '72 Beetle as my first car. I think it's fine to do as long as you fix it up correctly and look after it well. I drove mine every day for over a year and only had a few problems over the course of it. I think it's just a great experience and great car to own.
beetle,3e6etq,cosull,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:04:38 2015 UTC,"I'm also currently driving a 72 Super L , although its not my first car I've had it for 7 months now with only minor problems. You just have to look after em and be patient. Honestly the best experience I've had with a vehicle and I wont be selling ti for  along time. As long as you are patient and attentive it should be fine"
beetle,3e6etq,sisman61,4,Wed Jul 22 15:02:20 2015 UTC,Sounds like a grand adventure to begin.  Got any photos of the girl ?
beetle,3e6etq,_moist_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:36:18 2015 UTC,"It could, sure. About any car can make a good, reliable daily driver if you put enough into it. Some just need more than others.   Good news is if there's still a fair few on the road in your area then you've got mechanics who are familiar with them -- which is great.   You'll want to check all the major systems (brakes, the front end, fuel, engine, clutch, brakes, etc). Beware the cheap replacement parts, there's a reason they're cheap and if you want reliability you don't want them.   Pick up a copy of the Bentley (link), maybe the Idiot's Guide (link), and have at it."

I only hit the wall 4 or 5 times before I got it past that point. Good luck."
beetle,3e20ct,having_a_blast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:17 2015 UTC,It's a pain in the ass. There are blockages in there of gunk from over the years. I say spray a lot of wd40 in there. That's what I did to loosen everything up. Just keep working at it. Spin the cable while you're pushing it through.

I love that the electronics have completely cleared out the distributor mess (never knew the distributor in it's stock location was a mess until I saw that system you installed) and left that beautiful open bay!  One question though, I don't see a belt between the pulleys, that is not some other new technology that you rigged up and is just not on yet, right?  That would be amazing although I cannot see how it would work or why it would be needed, but I used to think you needed a distributor where one no longer is on your build too."

beetle,3dg8v5,LipsAre,2,Thu Jul 16 01:00:24 2015 UTC,"This leak at the head, where is it? Intake? Exhaust? Oil dripping? Compression leak at the cylinder/head mating surface?  If it is intake, exhaust, or oil, no big deal, just a new gasket, but if it is a compression leak, it could cost some real money to fix, as it might need a new head (this is not uncommon, especially if the motor has ever been overheated).  You could almost rebuild your engine for $750 btw, but 10 days is short notice...   Can you tow the bug to a friends/parents or something to give you some more time to sort this out and/or save a bit more cash?  EDIT: If it is not a compression leak, go for it, but expect to spend a couple hundred extra (gaskets, oil, etc)..."
beetle,3dg8v5,richcreations,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:16:48 2015 UTC,thanks for the reply:  I'm not sure where the head leak is coming from.

beetle,3dg8v5,richcreations,2,Thu Jul 16 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"What is it leaking I meant? Is it oil leaking? Exhaust Gasses leaking when running? Vacuum leak? Perhaps just ask the guy to clarify what he meant by ""Leaking"". If it passes a leak down test, go for it, and replace the gaskets (perhaps pushrod tubes as well, they often leak oil)"
beetle,3dg8v5,richcreations,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, I misunderstood your question. I'm sorry. I moved the engine (about 3 feet) and under the right head there was an oil spot. He said the engine had been sitting there since April, so about 2 months. I would say in total, it leaked about 1/4 of a cup, or Apx 2-3 fl oz... so not much. but it was oil... hope that answer's your question!

beetle,3dg8v5,windetch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:03:20 2015 UTC,I suggest the best thing you can do now is buy that engine and chuck it in. Have you heard it running? I don't think it would be to bad to fix the oil leak on it as the engine will be out of the car it's a lot easier to diagnose and fix on a work bench. Either way you are spending money or losing money so this car sounds like a bit of a white elephant.

beetle,3d5ohb,JahKewn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:17:18 2015 UTC,Make sure the plate is mating with the metal of the tunnel directly. The PO of mine has the carpet in between and my shifter was trying to grind into reverse from first to second. I cut the carpet interference and it shifts perfectly now.
beetle,3d5ohb,chaz345,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:54:44 2015 UTC,Sounds like your synchros are shot. They were weak to begin with on the early transmissions.  Your choice at this point is to rebuild the transmission or find another one to our in there.
beetle,3d5ohb,FlareVW,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"Just check your shift coupler bushing in the maintenance panel under the back seat. If the rubber is busted on that you can have shifting issues. Also, as lbs_ft said, adjust your shift shifter column. While you are there, also feel around for the shift rod bushing, if that hasn't been replaced it will most likely be disintegrated."
beetle,3d64ic,Ghawblin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:40:57 2015 UTC,"That's just a vent line, I used a 10' section of NAPA's quarter inch fuel hose and routed it up, around, back down, and out.  Not exactly ideal handling of the tank's emissions, but, you know, it works.  I've got wolfsburgwest's 5mm cloth covered hose in my engine bay, it's decent stuff. 's better to run the proper size line for obvious reasons, but for the vent...  /shrug.   Vapor lock wise, please post a pic of your engine bay. I'm going to hazard a guess your fuel line is running a bit too close to the heat risers, or you've got something else going on."
beetle,3d64ic,windetch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:30:04 2015 UTC,"I've toyed with this bug for a bit, but I've never had to mess around with the fuel lines too much to really know how it works.  What's the vent line for? Obviously for venting I imagine, but why would it be so wet/leaky?  And I'll have to snap a pic tomorrow! I tried to keep the line away from anything and even wrapped them with thermal tape. I'll get a pic when it's bright outside."
beetle,3d64ic,windetch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:01:14 2015 UTC,"The stock gas cap is not vented, so the tank needs a way to relieve pressure. The newer bugs used a charcoal canister to filter the tank emissions, the older ones dump straight to the air.  A lot of people discard the charcoal canister and just dump to the air. One way is a bit better for the environment, but it doesn't affect how the engine runs -- as long as the tank can relieve pressure.    With your leaky hose, that damaged section is low enough to be exposed to fuel when the tank is full.  The cloth allows it to travel up a bit.    One thing you might try next time the car seems to vapor lock is to pop the gas cap off and see if it makes a noise, then see if it'll restart.  The vent system could be plugged / not routed correctly."

beetle,3d4juk,kuppajava,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:19 2015 UTC,"The fuel gauge stuff is actually easy to put right (if you're still running a stock speedometer), it's three separate parts and each are currently available new or you can buy used off theSamba's classifies, ebay, etc.    The parts are:    The sender, sits in the tank and gives a resistance value based on fuel level.  (link) The vibrator, sits on the back of the gauge, I think it's just a small voltage regulator.  (link) The gauge itself, slots into the back of the speedometer.  (link)   First make sure the sending unit is connected to the gauge and the vibrator on the back of the gauge has power.  If that checks out you can test the resistance of the sender.    's not terrible to replace all three, and that's a fairly sure way to get a working fuel gauge, but a little diagnostics and you'll only have to replace what's broke.    btw, we want pics. Esp. of the body damage, some front end dings are easier to fix than others."
beetle,3d4juk,windetch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:37:04 2015 UTC,"Agree with windtech: The non-working fuel gauge is usually a contact problem somewhere and not actually broken gauge.  The gauge itself is basically a volt meter (and as such, breaks rarely) so you can feed directly to it anything less than and up to 12 volts. Like 1,5V from a battery or 4,5V from another battery or 12 from car battery. If you get needle movement at least with 4,5V and 12V shows full tank, then the gauge is probably OK, it just doesn't get signal from sender.  The resistance of the sender should be almost zero with full tank and tens or hundreds of ohms with an empty tank. if it's more than that, there's the fault.  The sender is simple to disassemble and clean: It has either contact problems or broken wire (see pic). http://kharon.suomiforum.com/www/ghia3/IMG_0788.jpg  The wire in mine was so dirty it was showing infinite resistance: Some cleaning of the wire and the contacts (in the float) and it was working fine again, showing zero ohms with float at the top."

I was wondering if anyone knew of an alternative to the white or black plastic ones, as they seem to break really quickly and I don't trust them any more!  On earlier Beetles they are metal for instance but they don't fit my model ('72) with thinner trim.  Thanks anyway though :)"
beetle,3d4nx6,windetch,2,Mon Jul 13 17:25:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, sure.    What brands of the plastic ones have you tried? I had a piece of trim fall off my '70 when I closed the door (convenient, at least it didn't fall off on the road).  Replaced the brittle original clips with the above from WolfsburgWest and they've been fine.    If your trim is bowed out and you're relying on the plastic pieces to hold it against the car you might try (very) gently bending the trim piece back to the proper shape so it lays flat against the car. The clips aren't really designed to hold a bunch of tension."
beetle,3d4nx6,EdgarAllenWoe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"Something breaking at a moment of convenience?! You're blessed!  Well I've not actually tried any yet, just going off of what I've heard and the white ones on mine at the moment breaking for seemingly no reason. I'm not sure which brand is on there as it stands, they could be originals for all I know as the guy who repainted it also refitted them.  You make a very good point about the bent chrome, maybe that's the main problem. I've been unwilling to risk breaking any more clips trying to remove the trim to bend it back into shape without replacements, but it's a bit of a catch-22 so I guess I'll have to bite the bullet and just get some.  I'd love to be able to take your recommendation but I'm in the UK (something else I put in the missing text from the original post) so I suppose I'll find some over here that have the same o-rings on them, I'd assume they're made in the same place anyway!

Engine build suggestions? my feeling is to either go 90.5 or 92 thick walls..The thick cyldinders just make me feel like there's an extra level of reliability.(Also I'm in the desert and it gets about 110F for a few months in the summer.)  I think I have a engle 110. 74mm crank 5.325"" I beam an 90.5 cylinders. a bit of self done head cleanup and a set of Kadrons, came out to 120hp at the wheels.

The flamethrower 2 works but so do others, a bosch blue will not work so well.  Also stock plug wires will not work with this distributor, you will need a set of either pertronix 804202 wires or you might be able to get by with some universal kit.  If you have the cast aluminum flamethrower distributor with the stock looking cap, please look at what module is in it before you get a coil and see what specs it needs.

I had oil leaks all over and my 74 and that drove me to school everyday just fine. The threads on the crank pulley could be dirty and this would allow the oil to run down it and spin off. It could be some serious blow by but i doubt that. Or the oil pressure sensor can be the source of the leak, and the oil will pool and run down behind the crank pulley.

beetle,3cy8yb,Iksaiah,2,Sat Jul 11 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"There are always various ways of approaching a performance twist on air-cooled engines. If you are a budget-minded person I would suggest the following:   Get two solex 32, get them restored to top quality and well adjusted to your 1600. Get a 2ag camshaft, it will improve tork on lower rpm. Get electronic ignition and a blue Bosch coil if not yet installed. get a pair of empi air filters   As for exaust, I would strongly suggest the same you showed us, the empi gt. You can choose the stainless or regular one, depends on budget.  Of course you could go fancier with a funkier camshaft or empi 34s. You could even put Weber 40s. Some heavy work on the engine would do good as well, all depends on how much money you got available."
beetle,3cy8yb,redbug74,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help. I don't want to restrict the budget too much. I am thinking of spending about $1000 on the car this summer. Take out a chunk for carpet kits and the rest should be able to go to the engine. I think I will get that exhaust and coil.  I still have some questions about the carb system. Should I buy individual parts or would a kit be ok? These kits are pretty cheap but i believe EMPI is a good aftermarket brand. Why is the dual port a bit cheaper?  http://www.jbugs.com/product/47-7411.html?Category_Code=1969-vw-bug-performance-carburetors  http://www.jbugs.com/product/47-7401.html?Category_Code=1969-vw-bug-performance-carburetors  Here are some questions I have... 1. What does an electronic ignition do? I watched some videos but what are its benefits? 2. When you say Heavy work on the engine, what do you mean? what could be done to modify it from its current state?  Thanks again"
beetle,3cy8yb,redbug74,2,Sun Jul 12 05:17:03 2015 UTC,"With this budget you shouldn`t have much problem on doing some light performance work on your engine, especially in the US where parts are quite cheap. That exhaust is really a great one in terms of performance and sound. Check this video for a demo of how it sounds on an 1500 stock engine. A symphony.  Regarding carbs, a kit would be optimal really. Brand-new and it comes with all you need. I don't want to sound propagandistic here but indeed EMPI is a very good brand in my opinion. EMPI parts are very expensive here in Brazil.  The dual port is cheaper because it's more common. I believe the single port is for 1300-1500 engines while the dual is for 1600 and bigger. Not too much people install those kits on such small engines, that's why its more expensive I guess.  If you plan on investing on a kit like that, the electronic ignition is simply a must. It's easier to adjust and produces a much stronger spark, burning fuel better and improving your engine's performance significantly.  Your engine also deserves a better camshaft. it will raise the max rpm it can achieve, and also provide more hp. Camshaft choosing is not an easy task since there are lots of them and each one produces different effects. Engle W100 is a good starter point, start researching a little more about it and you`ll be able to choose the one that fits you best.  When I said heavy work I meant changing the compression ratio of the engine mainly by doing grinding work on engine heads.  If you`re doing all that I would also reccomend that you get a dislocated oil radiator and maybe a better oil pump so your engine can cool and lubricate itself more efficiently. Not mentioning changing spark plugs and cables of course."

beetle,3cunoo,windetch,2,Sat Jul 11 10:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yea, I kept looking twice a week. And it just  popped up. It was one of those deals you just don't pass up. Floorboards were solid. Running boards were rotten, but it came with a set of new ones. I got 2 totes full of spare parts that included a carb rebuild kit, extra valve cover gaskets, and many more goodies. The engine smoked but it was the  valve cover gaskets, someone put them on wrong so we put the new ones on. Had trouble running at the lights, so we rebuilt the carb with the kit that came with it. It had a speed wobble so I had to replace the tie rods and steering stabilizer out of pocket. It had a 1600 in it and it was loaded.

beetle,3cunoo,GustoB,4,Fri Jul 10 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"Well its got rust issues for sure. Got a welder? Floor pans aren't a big job, heater channels (that form the outer frame of the car) are a headache.  And it probably needs them, if not more.  There's always more rust than you hope, and this one has a fair amount of obvious rust which means there's likely more lurking. That rear window rust could be fun to deal with..  rain gutters have some spots too, and along the bottom of the doors.      If you don't have experience working with aircooled VW engines that one could take you a while to get sorted.  It's been messed with, that oil filter and external oil cooler are not stock.   Could be fine, but eh. It's in pieces for a reason, if it was easy to fix the guy would just do it."
beetle,3cunoo,n0exit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:16:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm going to check it out, I'm hoping the rust is mostly just surface rust and can be sanded down and patched or something before painting over. The bit about the engine is pretty alarming, do you think its a bad thing? And also the vent below the rear window, what would we have to do for that?

beetle,3cunoo,windetch,2,Sat Jul 11 00:16:04 2015 UTC,It's not just surface rust though. You're going to need new floor pans and probably rockers.
beetle,3cunoo,richcreations,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:46:01 2015 UTC,Oh yeah absolutely. The owner has said already there are no floor pans. That's gonna have be the first purchase. Then whatever it takes to put the engine in order. Then body work followed by interior. I think. I just made that up now

beetle,3cunoo,GustoB,2,Sat Jul 11 01:01:41 2015 UTC,"With the rear window area, I guess if you're skilled you could fabricate the rotten parts.  More likely you'll need to find a donor, cut out and weld in a replacement section. You might find sections on, say, theSamba.com's classifieds   Here's an example of rear metal repair - (link)  Engine wise...  meh. People do weird stuff, that could be an aux oil cooler or it could be a hack replacement cooler.  The stock cooler is fine for stock, if it was added for additional cooling 's probably no longer a 1500cc engine. The oil filter isn't in a great spot imo (drips onto the top of the engine..) but 's nice they added a filter; they only came with a very basic metal strainer.    I'd ask when was the last time the engine ran and what's been done to it recently.  The front pulley and generator are missing. There's a few pieces of engine tin missing as well, get them if you can.  There's a list here - (link)"

IRS rear ends are just better for daily use.  The bullet proof torsion bar front end of a standard does not perform as well as the struts in a super beetle.  IMHO a 69 up standard performs better, looks largely the same as a 68.  A 67 down will get you some classic styling.  .... That said my 68 was a beater that I absolutely loved...

beetle,3ct2gq,Whoviantattoo,3,Fri Jul 10 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"That's an easy fix. It's interesting that it already had a fiberglass fender. A few bolts and some wires, a headlight and some matching paint and it's good as new.  Radio is an easy swap and you get to build the soundsystem you want from there. If it doesn't have them already, the speaker boxes that mount just forward of the doors are the best thing ever."
beetle,3ct2gq,gh0stmach1ne,2,Fri Jul 10 15:33:40 2015 UTC,That seems pretty cool. I have a good feeling about this beetle.
beetle,3ct2gq,DeVosDesigns,2,Fri Jul 10 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"The fender could have been dammaged without any frame issues, however the combination of water getting to the radio (likely hood to body seal issue), the original hood release being replaced with a pin and fiberglass fenders suggest a poor DIY front end repair to me so I suspect this is not the first front end damage this bug has received.  That said what 45 year old driver hasn't shaken hands with another car or done some unintended landscaping...  If their are no major rot issues (heater channels, frame head etc) then don't be scared off by a fender.  Nothing bolted on to a 1970 was overly expensive because they made millions of them.   When inspecting open the hood and check alignment.  Also check where the fenders bolt to the body when the hood is up.  If the fiberglass fenders were an upgrade to ones with minor dents I would expect to see most of the original square nuts.  If the car was in a more extensive accident you are likely to see hardware store nuts and washers.  Check for deformed sheet metal and welding throughout the front luggage compartment to see how and when it was pushed about."
beetle,3ct2gq,n0exit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:46:02 2015 UTC,It's more likely to be a windshield deal I think.  What ever body damage there might have been looks to have been repaired pretty well. The bonnet has a really good fit. There's no way you'd get a fit that good with a shoddy repair job.
beetle,3ct2gq,DeVosDesigns,2,Sat Jul 11 00:25:41 2015 UTC,The weak point in bug windshield seals is usually at the lower corners due to body curvature and the seal being stressed there.  I think that it is unlikely but possible to penetrate into the cabin in a way that would damage a radio.  I would suspect water getting behind the dash via the hood or fresh air seals when the car is in motion.  If all looks good check the condition of the air box and its drain.
beetle,3ct2gq,n0exit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:55:27 2015 UTC,"If there's a water leak that got into the dash, that should be easy too. Window seals are pretty cheap, and I think there's a seal on a cover on the back of the dash, where you access the wires under the bonnet?  The fender is super easy. The engine swap is also no problem. It's probably a dual port, which is nice.  There's no body damage. If there were, the bonnet wouldn't fit right. That looks perfect."
beetle,3ct2gq,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that about the bonnet, great insight, thanks!   How easy is it to pull the dash out?"
beetle,3ct2gq,mdmiles19,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"Nothing on this car is too difficult. I'm not sure there's actually a seal back there. The only seals I know of in that area are the windshield seal and the trunk lid seal, both of which are easy.   The current windshield seal on there is Cal-look which is aftermarket, so it has been replaced before. Could be that they've already addressed the issue or didn't seal it right the first time somehow"

beetle,3ctkut,Bermwolf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:59:17 2015 UTC,this one. Then I bought a bosch rotor and wires to top it all off. Like a whole new car.  Do you have points? One dumbass thing I did when I first got electronic ignition(not this dizzy) was that I left the key on while the magnet was engaged. Electrical fire. SO the moral of the story is to try to start your car OR turn the motor ever so slightly the first time you run things.

beetle,3ctkut,Bermwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:12:27 2015 UTC,Don't sweat it. It's only an issue when you first install it or if something else crazy happens. The reason is because when the engine runs and stops it won't ever stop at top of strock because of resistance and compression.  If it happens however it's immediate. Like within 5 seconds

But 95% of the 1776 motors running around out there just got jugs and pistons. I think you may be like me and anything you do you do right/over build. But the stock internals are a lot tougher than you are giving them credit for.   Also I'm not sure why you are picking on the crank I've had crank failures come through the shop but the real weak point is the valve train. More often than not they drop a valve into the cylinder and beat the crap out of the head and piston.

beetle,3c9vp1,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:40:53 2015 UTC,only conceivable obstacle I can think of is just fitting the engine into the back compartment. I do believe some body work will need to be done to accommodate
beetle,3c9vp1,n0exit,3,Mon Jul 6 09:28:25 2015 UTC,Is the new motor 6v?
beetle,3c9vp1,n0exit,2,Mon Jul 6 09:52:11 2015 UTC,its built for a v12 electrical system. it has an external oil cooling fan
beetle,3c76uf,ShartVader,6,Sun Jul 5 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"Check ignition wiring, and check the actual key switch. That's pretty much the only way that your car would exhibit that kind of behavior."
beetle,3c76uf,curtquarquesso,5,Sun Jul 5 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"And you're exactly right!  I was just about to post that.  I noticed all of a sudden i wasn't getting juice at the coil, so i went and realized the idiot lights weren't on.  After some wiggling and jiggling I can get it to run as long as I hold the key in exactly the right place.  So that's just the ignition switch then.  Delightful."
beetle,3c76uf,Fweaka,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:39:59 2015 UTC,Which is easy to replace.
beetle,3c76uf,Fweaka,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:08:15 2015 UTC,Is there any way to determine switch vs lock?  Or is it pretty much  always the switch?
beetle,3c76uf,Fweaka,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:01:52 2015 UTC,I'd replace both if I were you. It's probably the switch. Any ignitions I do on any bug I just replace both. They're not too expensive. But if you just want to replace the switch only then you can. Good luck bud :)
beetle,3c76uf,XUD9TE,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:30:23 2015 UTC,So bonus question - any way to get it started temporarily to move the car other than bringing a friend to hold the key halfway between where the start kicks over and where it's supposed to rest once it's started?

beetle,3c4bd2,kuppajava,2,Sun Jul 5 22:38:53 2015 UTC,What a clean and beautiful engine build!  I forget just how much the dual intakes clear out the center of the engine bay.  What are you doing for a distributor?  Any new ignition technology going in? Oil filtration? Coil?
beetle,3c4bd2,kuppajava,2,Sun Jul 5 05:47:21 2015 UTC,I am using a cb performance crank trigger system for ignition so there will be no distributor. There is a coil pack mounted on the driver's side of the firewall but it blends in with the tar paper. The engine is done in the pic we're just adjusting the linkage before we start it so I can answer any questions.
beetle,3c4bd2,Fweaka,2,Sun Jul 5 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"No questions, just going ""gllllglglglllg"" for a while over how awesome that is.  Any chance we can get more pictures?"

beetle,3c2yy4,FLAMINGCUMBOX,2,Sat Jul 4 07:25:50 2015 UTC,I drive my 73 super daily. What did people do that bought them new in the 70's ? drive them like you would any other car. Make sure you carry tools with you at all times spare bulbs fan belt and a spare throttle cable. A car like this will need a lot more maintenance than a modern car. Be sure to keep on top of oil changes and adjust tappets when needed and this will probably run for another 40 years.
beetle,3c2yy4,XUD9TE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:02:23 2015 UTC,Looking into this beetle. I eat to know the though a quirks and of it would be a good daily driver. I'm in Michigan also so it would be a winter car too.
beetle,3c2yy4,Nintenzo,6,Sat Jul 4 07:07:22 2015 UTC,"Another Michigander! Hi! What part of Michigan are you in?   Anyway I daily drive my Beetle. They're great dd's. I haven't been stranded yet. But every car is different....  Let me just say though, if you plan on driving this in the winter, make sure it's undercoated or at least take it to a self serve car wash and spray off the underbody once a week. Because if you don't, the road salt WILL destroy your car.   I drove mine all last winter and the cancer is already starting to grow on my fenders and my front apron. It's all surface rust though.   Also they're pretty damn cold unless every single part of the heater system is present. If there are some tubes missing, be prepared to scrape ice off the inside of the windshield with a credit card.   These cars are a fucking BLAST to drive in the snow though! I've never gotten stuck."

beetle,3c2yy4,TheJadedStoic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:04:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it really depends on what you are used to and where you live.  If you live somewhere very cold with salted streets during snow-days, then no.  Otherwise, if you have driven an older car before and can do work that comes up yourself, it is worth considering."
beetle,3c14mk,pantlesshippo,5,Fri Jul 3 20:23:09 2015 UTC,I didn't
beetle,3c14mk,gh0stmach1ne,5,Fri Jul 3 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, IMHO you should invest the paintjob money on some badass off road accessories. I'm not a fan of shiny bajas tbh. The bug looks great the color it is! However, if you hate this color some matte army green would do the trick. Good luck bro!!"
beetle,3c14mk,redbug74,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:47:57 2015 UTC,Not a bad idea. This is my first car so I have a lot to learn. What accessories are you talking about?
beetle,3c14mk,FunDiggle,2,Fri Jul 3 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"Also have a baja as my first car. First and foremost get it reliable, sometimes they don't run great, I needed a new carb. Mine is a '57 so I'm not sure if the upgrades I bought are already in your car. New steering, stinger exhaust, disc brakes, buttery suspension, and if you have all that work on your cosmetics or save up for a new engine if you like em fast. Mine is canary yellow but mechanic-sensei says red baja bugs go faster ;). I intend on getting either a retro colorful 80's paint job or going with straight red and chrome."
beetle,3c14mk,tcruarceri,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:58:44 2015 UTC,New brakes are at the top of my list! Thanks for the suggestions
beetle,3c14mk,redbug74,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:41:29 2015 UTC,This. Forget the paint and keep it reliable. Good exhaust maybe. lots of gas for lots of miles/smiles.
beetle,3c14mk,ORGrown,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"Well, despite admiring all sorts of beetles, I don't know much about the baja universe. However I can think of some nice improvements that can be done to meke your baja better:  Adittional Headlights, so you can see better at night trails (Hella 500 for example) Elevated exhaust so your engine doesn't flood when crossing rivers A top rack for carrying some gear, ropes, chains, extra fuel, etc Some minor engine improvements to make it tougher such as bigger oil pump, air filter, dual carbs if not already installed, and so on  As the bug is a highly customizable car (and that's what it makes so nice) the sky is the limit here."
beetle,3c14mk,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly what redbug said. A rack, some off road lights, dual carbs, and a baja exhaust on that and it will be perfect. Honestly, you have my dream bug right there. You've already got the suspension, lift and tires taken care of, the rest is easy peasy. If you want to get rid of it ever let me know :P"
beetle,3c14mk,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:30:15 2015 UTC,You already have that tow bar I've been looking at getting on mine. Can you maybe take a picture of that so I can see how it's attached?

beetle,3c25kc,fatalifeaten,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:22:25 2015 UTC,69mm is stock. You can go to 74mm without having to do any machine work to clearance your case. Longer stroke than that and you're into machining work to keep things from hitting.

Did a quick search for giggles, This thread on theSamba (link) indicates the vacuum on a 30/31 is too weak to run a SVDA.. Can give it a shot and see how it runs though.    Also, a note on the Pertronix -- Do Not leave your key in the 'on' position without the engine running, you'll burn it up.  They made a tier 2 (and 3) edition that's a little smarter, but 's a bit more expensive (ex)    I've run the original version for around a year and a half now (with a 34-PICT3), ~ 8k miles and it's been great.

Aircooled.net talks about an SVDA that works with the 30/31, but i can't it anywhere on the site.  The petronix was honestly bought out of frustration because I can't figure out what freggin points and condesor to buy.  I've had it a month and run around town in it with no problems.  Suddenly out of the blue it won't start.  Then it did start, but bogged down under acceleration.  So i figured i'll do a full tune up and just go through it.

beetle,3bf6vl,WEINER_SCHLAP,3,Mon Jun 29 02:48:51 2015 UTC,Could be a lot of things. Your car will lose power noticeably before its damaged by heat. Are your heater box intake hoses sealed up? Did it rain recently? Water that falls into the heater boxes can sizzle and boil from a hot engine. It's unlikely you are burning oil (the only other fluid that is back there)
beetle,3bf6vl,teninchtires,2,Sun Jun 28 19:13:06 2015 UTC,OK I'm a dumbass there was a giant puddle in my driveway. Thanks guys x__x
beetle,3bf6vl,Fweaka,3,Mon Jun 29 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"You can usually smell an overheated engine. Touching the dipstick is a good indicator too. Check your belt tension and make sure you have all the engine tin in place, (they put every piece on there for a reason), and check that the engine compartment gasket is OK. You want the hot air to exit out of the bottom, and not get re-circulated back into the cooling fan. I hope it's OK! Good luck!"

beetle,3bb72e,windetch,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:32:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly it looks like you've got a decent handle on it. Engine is nice and clean, pan looks mostly rust free. Some of those patches are a little... patchy.  But look solid, so hey.   Your '76 Standard is roughly the same as the other '68+ models, if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.   If you plan to keep the fuel filter over there on the side in the engine bay (or even if you don't) you might want to safety wire (pic) the carb.  That brass fitting can pull out, esp with the extra weight of the fuel filter. The fuel filter waay over there on the side is okay, imo it's best if it's completely out of the engine area (under the tank, or in the short run between the tunnel and engine). Engine fires are no fun, I recommend a Halotron (clean!) fire extinguisher.    I'm thinking all crescent window bugs suffer the death foam issue, your '76 is def. late enough to have it. In the previous years VW used a loose fill insulation in the enclosed areas between the engine bay and passenger compartment, in the later models they filled it with solid foam...  which can trap water against the shell, causing rust.  Yours doesn't look too bad now, while you've got it stripped down you might want to go ahead and deal with it. Relevant theSamba thread - (link)  ...also, the spare tire goes up front :P"

beetle,3bbg2y,elsilbon,3,Sat Jun 27 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"If you're rebuilding an engine its likely that you're spending lot of money on it and want it to last. If this is the case you want to go with a stock doghouse shroud. That is the only shroud that will cool your engine adequately. The vw engineers had a lot of time and money to design the best shroud for cooling the engine. No aftermarket shroud will cool your engine as well as a stock shroud. if you use the low profile shroud you'll save yourself a few bucks now but your engine will overheat and wear out much quicker. If you're trying to build a dirt cheap engine for a weekend cruiser the low profile shroud would be fine, the engine would be underused and un-strained anyway. Therefor it wouldn't need the extra cooling of a stock shroud as badly. If you're trying to build an engine that you want to be more reliable and have less problems put on the stock doghouse with the accompanying tin."
beetle,3bbg2y,dwee370,3,Sat Jun 27 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, use the stock one and then sell the Puma/Brasilia shroud on thesamba for ~$150."

Need to sort out heater flaps, blowing heat into cabin. Needs some more: hood lock not popping, fuel indicator showing wrong info, has to be checked by a professional electrician because main lights dim a bit when braking (might be ground, might be regulator). Some rust spots.  Best is: totally rebuilt engine (all tooled out, new cylinder bores, Mahle pistons, new rings, new valves, new valve seats, new bearings, new oil cooler, new gaskets all around, etc, etc; no leaks!), rebuilt tranny (mainly needed seals and bearings). Brakes are great.  Learnt a lot here and in other sites, like The Samba. Thank you, guys!!!"

Yep indeed :P  Honestly, I'd invest in a cheapie multimeter (Walmart, HarborFreight, Sears, HomeDepot (I like my midtier Klein), etc) then go and check the grounds yourself.  Voltage regs are relatively cheap, Bosch has a solid state one (link). You can find wiring diagrams in the Technical section on theSamba.     And instead of hiring someone to diagnose your crappy old wiring (serio, it's over 40 years old) just buy a new harness and put it in yourself.  There's not all that much to it, relatively speaking.  There's no way you're fitting a modern car's full wiring diagram on an 8.5"" x 11"" sheet of paper (pic)  Kinda thinking you've fixed the left air tube on the engine already, but if not you need one of (these) and the paper hose (this).  ((these) are good too) The heaterbox expects air to flow through it, as it looks like (this) inside -- the heat it pulls of the muffler needs to go somewhere (into the car or out the bypass), not sit there and bake. ...also, that hole in the breastplate tin (originally hooked up to the oil bath air filter) can just be plugged.    's a pretty car, congrats and I hope you have fun with 'er"
beetle,3b0gii,windetch,2,Thu Jun 25 03:38:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :)  And thanks for the links though they are not much use to me, I'm in Europe (Portugal). ;) Still, good to have references and images of parts.  As for the wiring, complete replacement will be in a couple years when I'll strip it all and repaint. It looks ok in the photos but the paint job is really poor (you can notice that the trim clips on the door are painted... shoddy work). Right now it'll be a quick fix, cleaning up contacts and checking everything. I had the turn signal's fuse blown one night, replaced it and it has hold until now. Already cleaned and fine sanded the fuse contacts before it happened. Might have been an old fuse.  As for the air tubes, already have all the parts but the J tubes intakes don't align right with the breastplate holes. I'm going to check the exhaust assembly. I'm really trying to keep it fairly stock and straight, so the pre-heat tube will be placed although it's not much use here since rarely gets very cold in winter, usually never goes below 3º C, 37º F. Yeah, rainy winters... It might help a bit in colder days though.  It's not my daily driver (gasoline is expensive here and it's insured as a classic so officially I can't do much mileage on it) but my main concerns are rust and electrics. Mechanics are all good now, had the carb replaced and tuned. I have another engine around since I have another dismantled 1303 with a damaged front wheel panel, and took its 30 PICT 2 and replaced the faulty 34 PICT 3 this one had (could not hold idle). I think the 34 wasn't the original carb...  So yeah, I'm planning having fun driving it. :) It drives great now that the engine already broke in some."
beetle,3b0gii,kuppajava,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:41:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, whelp. WolfsburgWest will ship internationally, but for the cost you might be better off finding a local supplier.  Not sure what the aircooled VW scene is like in Portugal  Sounds like you've got a plan for it though, great! I can sympathize with poorly done paint, the PO on mine painted the fender beading, oversprayed on the dash, and did zero prep work in the vent area so that's peeling off now; still, she's a decent ten footer.    btw, I call (these) j-tubes, they're plain pipe replacements for the heaterboxes.  I believe you're talking about (these), and there's actually a couple different types that each slot in a little differently. For it to work correctly there's a little flap on your oil bath unit, depending on year it might have it's own thermostat or (more likely) link up with the main flaps system in the fan shroud.    I suspect your 34 PICT-3 was just a bit worn, if that 30 PICT-2 is working then run it. I defer to others more knowledgeable in carb / dist. choosing, this seems a reasonable summary here - (link)"

I live in an area that gets up to 100+ in the summer and my bug is a daily driver. Two years ago I vapor locked daily.   First my air-cooled only mechanic said that a slightly higher idle will help. It sounds like it would run hotter but it needs to be a little higher to move enough air. Mine is around 900-950rpm.   Second I pulled the fan out and cleaned it, and cleaned the engine top to bottom with a little pressurized water and got all the grim off.

beetle,3b0amv,beefgravy,2,Thu Jun 25 11:13:20 2015 UTC,"This should answer most of your valve related questions. http://www.vw-resource.com/valve_adjust.html  TLDR - Valves let gas in and exhaust out of the cylinder.  They're at the top of the cylinders, under the valve covers (go figure).   Crawl under and you'll see the covers on either side of the block.  It's a long rectangle shaped thing with a clip running the long way across it.  You can shove a shop rag under the clip and give it a solid tug it should pop open.  A little oil will dribble out.  Don't do this unless you have a new gasket to put it back together."

Putting everything back together is a little tougher. If you do it I seriously suggest a friend to help, since the engine is 300+ pounds.  Get plastic zip loc bags to keep screws and bolts in and label them with a sharpie. In example ""engine mounting studs and nuts"". That way you will never get mixed up. While everythings out is the perfect time to look everything over and even put a tune up kit on your car. If you drain your tranny oil it will make it a little lighter and help keep it from leaking oil on you from the breath hole. It's all pretty straight forward. Just lining everything back up is a pain. Remember, always use jackstands to properly support the vehicle (and so you can use the Jack to drop ever engine safely) and wear eye protection when you're under the car. Look up a video on how to. I think Chris vallone has a video on his website/YouTube on how to drop an engine. :)"

beetle,3awtlq,soapandsoup,3,Wed Jun 24 03:26:37 2015 UTC,"You're making this harder than it needs to be :P    I don't think it's actually possible unless you've removed the rear apron, and even then it'd be a pain. iirc, on an IRS (and I think swing too) where the axles mount up sticks out a bit too far to fit between the frame horns (pic), so it'd have to slide at least that far forward before dropping down.    Swapped the transmission on my '70 about six-ish months ago, it's honestly not a bad job. Replace all three transmission mounts plus the rubber bit the shift linkage goes through. A new coupler and shiftrod bushing are both good ideas, you've got everything apart anyways.    If this bug is an IRS model be sure to eval your CV joints, pull 'em and clean 'em.  The grease is kinda awful, but get all the old out and repack with CV-rated grease if all looks good. If you see some major wear now's an easy time to replace."
beetle,3awtlq,windetch,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:18:22 2015 UTC,"So those shift-rod bushings, how the heck do you change those. The pans underneath the car seem to block access to them???  Btw...that's a beautiful transmission and pan!"

beetle,3aqzvd,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"What does the rust condition look like? At least from that angle it doesnt look too bad.    A nice body like that could reasonably be complete enough that the work you were going to do on it anyway ends up being easier with all the parts that would most likely have been crap being gone.  Also, you don't have to worry about how much after-market is too much and can really have fun with it.  I could see stuffing it with high-end interior tech and super clean wiring since there is no old rat's nest to get in the way, really nice new seats, a really sweet engine build with electronic distributor and ignition and additional oil filtration, high-end fuel cell instead of regular beetle gas tank, more receptive steering and suspension, new transmission, LED lighting on the interior, dash, exterior and headlights.  Also, instead of a radio you could have speakers and a aux port (or bluetooth) so you can use your phone for music and GPS, etc.  With a project like this there are unlimited possibilities and since you will have to tear down to the pan anyway, a good chance to get everything the way you want it on the body before even getting to the internals and mechanical which can come one bit at a time."
beetle,3aqzvd,kuppajava,2,Mon Jun 22 22:51:27 2015 UTC,I plan to put a Subaru ej22 in it. I wanted to do that to my last one but wasn't at the skill level yet and I feel confident now so we'll see how that goes. The car still needs a lot though basically a roller with a trans. Looks to be all surface rust.
beetle,3aqzvd,kuppajava,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:32:06 2015 UTC,"Man, I have always wanted to try out a Subaru Beetle project!  That will give you some serious power and enable a much stronger and more modern electrical system, which is exactly what I was thinking when I saw that beetle.  With a good shell that is otherwise empty, I think this will be a great opportunity to create something amazing!"

beetle,3ap7ny,kuppajava,2,Mon Jun 22 18:23:17 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Can't wait to see some pics of that rebuilt motor.  While you were rebuilding, did you make any modifications or clean/strip/paint anything?  Carbs are always the second hardest for me, next to distributor.  Everything else can be done by just being precise and following instructions, but those two require loads and loads of experience and having an ear for when it is right, which would be different if I worked for a shop but for a normal guy working on only one at a time you just never get enough practice."

beetle,3an9xt,richcreations,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:32:26 2015 UTC,Same shape up to 67 so at least you have a big range unlike 71/72 super folks.  The trim holes are smaller for 67.
beetle,3anpim,ShartVader,3,Mon Jun 22 00:29:42 2015 UTC,"You can't squeeze it in I tried. The only way to do it, well I mean without wanting to kill someone from the frustration of trying to get it squeezed in there, is to pull it out. It's easier with two people, one to guide it in the bushing hole, and one to feed the rod through most of the way."
beetle,3anpim,AVANT96,3,Mon Jun 22 03:36:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's enough clearance around the hole to squish the bushing in and out.  What year is your bug? If it's not a Super, it's pretty easy to get the rod in and out. While you do it, you may want to replace the bushings at the linkage too (you'll be looking at them when you disconnect to get the rod out).  If it is a super, you've got to remove the crush plate thing in addition to the plate over the access hole.  Here's a link for a guy doing it on his Ghia: http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=436432"
beetle,3anpim,ponchoboy,2,Mon Jun 22 00:48:26 2015 UTC,There's gotta be room.  If you can fit channel locks in to inch it back you gotta be able to slip the rubber over.   I did pick up a new cage and urethane bushings for the back.   It's a 69.  So standard.   Looks like 3 access plates to pull.  Only had it a few weeks.   Wanted one since I was 8!  I love it!!
beetle,3anpim,ponchoboy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the tricky bit is the metal ring - good luck fishing that out of the tunnel when it goes flying off trying to put it on. :)  But yeah, if you are doing the linkage bushings in the back, inching the rod forward may give you enough room. There's definitely no way to do it without disconnecting it at the rear and moving it forward.  I just remember trying some tricks with my '71 Super before just saying ""aw screw it - let's pull the access plates and the rod""."

beetle,3akhfr,Flowers14,4,Sun Jun 21 02:15:37 2015 UTC,"Kinda neat, ish.  You did alright for $150. Year wise she's a 1971+ Standard judging by the dash vents and spare tire well.    How are you with a welder? I don't really like what they've done with the shell, it's roofless and looks cut off at the rear windows?  Kinda wondering what the plan was there.    If you like it then hey, roll with it; consider adding the convertible reinforcement rails (they're welded to the heater channels).    If you don't care for it then workable beetle shells can be found for typically not all that much -- which might be worth while if the pan is in good shape.  Title follows pan, so a cheap bill-of-sale-only bug would work great, or find someone building a buggy (etc) who doesn't need their shell.    Last registered in 2004 means she's been sitting a while. You said in another comment you've already turned the engine over, but I'd throw a little oil down each sparkplug hole, replace the sparkplugs, and change the oil. Carb probably needs a good cleaning, that's not too bad. Air filter, you can grab a new filter or put an oil bath back on. Fuel pump might need changing out (the diaphragm dries out and cracks), all rubber fuel lines do need replacing (incl. the one under the gas tank). Transmission could use new oil. Tires likely have some age on them as well.    Most important are the brakes though. Get a full set of pads, check the drums and see if they need machining, and flush the brake fluid; if you're lucky that's all it'll need.    Def a project, but if there's minimal rust and it's something you're interested in putting a little effort in it could be fun."
beetle,3akhfr,windetch,6,Sun Jun 21 04:11:10 2015 UTC,"I would say now that you have bought it for such an incredibly low price, consider how much money you want to spend on the rebuild.  1000?  2000? 5000? What you do in the long term is going to be based on that, but your next steps are going to be the same no matter what:   print out a large ""map"" style diagram and put it on the wall, marking out projects and rust as you go bucket wash the whole thing marking out rust on the map   print out a master plan (like this but more detail) as a checklist so the job doesn't overwhelm you   Clean the whole interior like a maniac after taking out the seats   as you clean, take note of rust and mark it on a printed out map of your car check molding around windows, this will most likely need replacing on some of them, leaks mean rust and rust is the real enemy here so seal what you can (this matters even without a roof)  New battery and battery cables     Put it on jack stands and take off the wheels   Drain all of the fluids   take off the trunk-lid and check that wiring, it looks pretty nasty, clean it up and tie it off to get rid of the ""nest"" look   check the electrical system-by-system to find shorts and miswiring, replace wiring as you go   empty, remove and check gas tank, check for leaks and rust and if it is good, reinstall it after cleaning area    check fuel lines, change fuel filter, move fuel filter away from engine if it is in the engine bay   check heating channels for rust     check head covers to make sure they are secure    clean or replace air filter   rebuild carburetor if this is within your skill set   replace oil-screen (get the full oil-change kit)   check hoses and replace generator/alternator belt   replace oil and oil spark-plug ports, replace spark plugs     check distributor and remove and distributor cap and points, clean and reinstall or replace cap   change spark-plug wires out unless they are new    refill transmission fluid    take down wheels to spindles and clean the hell out of every part all the way down   lube wheel spindles and check for damage    check brake lines, shoes, drums, cylinders, and then reassemble, flush, fill and bleed    check and fill, or replace bad tires after cleaning up rims   reinstall tires and check studs and lug nuts while doing so and pull off jack stands     check and fill or replace spare, reinstall trunk lid    reinstall seats after cleaning them and possibly covering them    Put in a few gallons of gas and run her around the block half a dozen times, pay attention to brakes and listen for rattles, check for even acceleration and solid breaking, take note of where rattles are coming from and sounds, flat spots, etc...   If you do all of this your Beetle will be ready for the more advanced servicing on steering and transmission and engine that you will absolutely need to do, but this will get you to the ""up and running"" base line and also give you a much-needed first-time orientation with your new beetle letting you know what you need to do next and helping you learn the quirks of your new 40 year old car.  Next will be engine rebuilds, trans rebuilds, body work, window replacement, upgrades, and the filling of every weekend you have for the next five years or so.    Welcome to the brotherhood of Beetle owners!"
beetle,3akhfr,kuppajava,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I appreciate the help, I've begun draining all old fluid as well as cleaning her out. I've run across a problem. How do I remove the driver and passenger seats?"
beetle,3akhfr,kuppajava,2,Sun Jun 21 22:21:54 2015 UTC,"This video is not accurate for that year but they come out exactly the same way.  There is a spring underneath the seat, and a small tab next to the tunnel. Take the spring off, roll it forwards on its tracks, hold down the tab next to the tunnel and slide forwards off the rails.   If this is NOT the case, then your Beetle is from after 1972.  Come back and let me know if that is the case, but it just means the spring is in a different location.  One more thing, and this may be un-asked-for advice but well, here goes:    Wherever you are now, once the seats are out, stop!  Get a technical diagram of your year online and print it out and post it, make a couple copies to use for documenting different things  Cut and paste my steps from my first post here and put it in word with bullet points  Work that into a checklist of jobs in word and print it out with some corrections to make it more accurate for your plan Cross off what you have already done and going forward stick to the plan   The reality here is that all big car jobs are about organization and keeping on track and knowing what you have and haven't done and having a exit strategy for the project.  Do all of your jobs on this car this way and not only will you actually get it done and have inspiration to get and keep going, you will have a documented list of everything you have done (take pictures) that you can use for planning your next project.  If you decide to sell, or just really want to get into this car and make it REALLY nice and restored, it will be a big help!"
beetle,3akhfr,kuppajava,2,Sun Jun 21 23:28:07 2015 UTC,Will do. I've got my printouts of the car under body as well as a diagram of the  engine and have a general consensuses of what I need to do and what has to be done. Thank you greatly!
beetle,3akhfr,kuppajava,2,Mon Jun 22 00:23:13 2015 UTC,"Fantastic!  My car work was always such a mess and with so many stupid mistakes and lost parts until I started doing my projects this way.  Since I have started keeping everything organized into projects-jobs-steps and keeping track of where I was with checklists, I have not had those kind of problems with any car work I have done since.    This and getting a couple of boxes of the large heavy-duty Ziploc bags and putting all loose screws, bolts, studs and nuts in them labeled to where they go have fixed that situation completely for me, and can't ever hurt for anyone working on a problem with many pieces which are not interchangeable with similar pieces.  Last unwarranted advice, do the brakes after you do everything else because they are the most important part of the job.  Everything else does not compare to being able to stop the damn thing once it is rolling!  I even suggest that most people get their brakes inspected by a shop before driving it any real distance even if they know it's done and done right, since just one mistake with brakes can actually literally kill people."

beetle,3afpua,emcee_el,3,Fri Jun 19 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"I'd like to shoot down most 'safety'-related arguments: Drums have enough power to lock up the front wheels and you don't get any more power than that from any brake.  But there's a catch on this: Misadjusted shoes might cause ""snake trails"" as shoes don't grab all at the same time, basically missing maintenace. Also drums overheat faster than discs, usually a problem only on race track.  'Ease of maintenance' is totally something else: Disc brakes in dry climate or summer car are quite maintence free. In a light car, like Beetle, pads last almost forever.  IMHO the real reason the newer (a relative term here) Beetles had disk brakes.   Those also had 'maintenance free' ball joints and other stuff which basically was 'use and dump' stuff instead of maintenance free: You just couldn't service them unlike king pin models.  Disks (with legal speeds) are currently more like personal prefence than obvious technical choice: Cost vs. what you like to have."
beetle,3afpua,Kharon8,2,Fri Jun 19 23:07:17 2015 UTC,"Needed?  Nah. Most of the aircooled bugs sold came with drum brakes, they work. You do need to adjust them occasionally as the pad wears, but they're simple and function fine.    Disc brakes do work better and are a nice upgrade, but are entirely optional.    My '70 is still running drums (and it's a daily driver), front discs are on the upgrade list but not a priority at the moment.    Pretty bug btw, looks in nice shape."

Otherwise the drums are perfectly capable as long as you keep them adjusted. It's not a heavy car.
beetle,3afpua,8SKIN8,2,Fri Jun 19 21:44:05 2015 UTC,I have a slammed 67 that has drums. They are fine. I have had them for about 15000 miles and 6 years. It has a single port 1500 for comparisons sake.

beetle,3afpua,Warningwaffle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:44:08 2015 UTC,"I own a 1974 Brazilian Standard as my daily driver, which is pretty much the same as your 69. However, mine runs a stock 1300cc engine at the moment.  I converted to disks, and here's why: First of all, I was already restoring my bug, so it was easier to make this decision. I'm restoring mine in parts, so last year was the chassis time. We strip it down to bare metal and applied several coats of paint for protection, while replacing floor panels and all needed suspension/brake systems. The front part of the chassis was cut off and another one (from a newer model) was put in place.  Drum brakes work fine, however if you have the opportunity to upgrade with a quality service, i'd say do it. If you want to upgrade your engine in the future (even long term) that will come in handy. Dual carbs, new crankshaft, etc... The will to pilot your bug will be greater than your safety concerns and you'll already have some nice breaks.  Good luck mate"
beetle,3afpua,richcreations,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:54:08 2015 UTC,When I acquired my 67 it had sat for so long the drums were out of round and the pedal bounce under my foot when the brakes were applied.  I got new drums for the rear and converted to disc in the front at the same time.  Replace the hose with braid and make sure you have a two circuit master cylinder.  Many kits include a new master cylinder.  The car stops well now.  The downside is brake dust builds up quickly on the front wheels and they squeal sometimes.
beetle,3afpua,Blagger1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"the only issue with drums is fade, do you live somewhere with lots of hills, do you road race, or autocross with a hot motor? If you did not answer yes to any of the above, disks won't do anything for you."

beetle,3adbbt,ShartVader,2,Sat Jun 20 05:44:37 2015 UTC,"I just did my horn on a 69. Trace your wires.  Start with the ground and work backwards.  There's a ground wire that runs through the center of the column and comes out the bottom.  My problem was there.  The connection was loose and corroded.  For the path it's power off the fuse block, runs down along the tank and out the fender to the horn. Then back from the horn up again through the trunk to the firewall.  Sometimes there's a connection here. After that it's through the firewall and then up the column to a bearing. Wire attaches to the bearing which has copper contacts that run along the steering column.  That's how the column gets live. You'll see the two copper rings in the horn ring and the column and a ground wire that i spoke of earlier.  Pushing the horn connects the two rings and the connection here  runs to ground and completes the circuit.  Check that ground wire first.  I bet that's your problem.  If that's tight grab your test light and with your key on start disconnecting the wires one at a time, grounding and looking for the light. So figure out which of the two leads on the horn is direct from the fuse block.  Disconnect, and put the test light on a ground.  If it lights, move on up to the next connection all the way up the change."

He said it took a pretty big bed of very hot coals from a wood fire to get one started but once it did, there was litterally no way to put it out. It didn't throw sparks everywhere, just burned VERY hit and bright. Since the reaction releases it's on oxygen, you can't put it out with water or even by burrying it in the sand."
beetle,3aco9b,Kharon8,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"Only very old ones, pre-60-something were (partially) magnesium: Much easier to cast that way.  They used magnesium-aluminium alloy  as aluminium casting at that time was very hard, mostly because of pure aluminium alloys weren't too good yet (for casting).  But anyway, sandblasting is way too harsh for engine block: Try soda blasting or high pressure water washing: Both are giving nice smooth surface while removing dirt and paint and whatever there is.  For just dirt & grease the dishwasher is a good choice (as suggested earlier).  Dish washer detergent eats aluminium like cookies but in this case it doesn't matter much."

Also pick up a pack of shims (ex) and reset your endplay.    The seal does just pop out, don't scar your case though.  A seal puller is handy.    Can pick up one of these - (link) to help with the install; there's various ways to do it, but that's one of the easier."

You obviously wont need one to pull it off, but you'll want one for putting it back on.   That and, as mentioned, a dial gauge if you don't have one.

beetle,3a847g,richcreations,2,Thu Jun 18 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""mad""?  Do you have to retap the crank because the glandnut was loose, the pin holes are oval shaped, or  endplay is toast, etc?  If the engine is out and the flywheel is off the best thing to do is to replace it.  Why put it all back together with an old seal and run the risk of having to do it again at a later date?  They are fairly cheap.    When you remove it, a pick would be best as to not scratch/gouge any mating surfaces like you could do with a screwdriver.  Here's a simple how to from the sidebar"

beetle,3a37kl,JahKewn,4,Tue Jun 16 21:39:48 2015 UTC,There is a few suspects in this area. To completely nail it down give it a good clean and then start investigating. The order I would investigate is as follows:-  Overfull transmission oil (there is the vent hole on top of the transmission here)  leaky reverse sender switch (most likely candidate) Nose cone to transmission gasket  Hockey stick bushing (inside the car see if you can move the shift shaft at the nose cone up and down or side to side ( 2nd most likely candidate).

beetle,3a3mqb,BarryTheBonobo,3,Tue Jun 16 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"Well, stock config has a trunk release in your glovebox (manual page). And you can buy locking glovebox latches if you don't have one (ex).    If your bug is missing the trunk release cable you can buy everything needed to replace it.    My bug was whacked on the front sometime in the past and it's a bit wonky; trunk doesn't line up quite like it should so I disabled that latch (the main one holds it down fine)."

beetle,3a3mqb,Highlander-,2,Wed Jun 17 10:30:59 2015 UTC,"I knew about the latch in the glove box, but I never did figure out how to use it to lock the bonnet."
beetle,3a3mqb,windetch,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"The latch in the glovebox releases the bonnet, it'll lock on it's own when you close the trunk (if everything is working properly). It's basically the same as most modern vehicles, you pull the release inside and the hood pops up a little, allowing you to go back to the front and operate the release that opens it the rest of the way.    There's various reasons for disabling that latch, one I mentioned above (front end damage, parts not quite aligning anymore), another is the cable broke and the previous owner never repaired it (if the cable breaks with the trunk closed you basically have to take a hacksaw to the front handle (pic).  You can see why it might stay broken in that case.    Anyways.  If you're curious how it's supposed to work there's various topics on theSamba that cover it fairly well.

Going home we left around 7am Monday and got home around 8pm.  Our only issues were; a bus running out of fuel, because the filler nozzle slipped off the gas tank during the trip.  Some hard starts due to temperature.  And a bad oil pressure sensor.  Everyone's cars were getting pretty tired near the end, but we made it!

beetle,398x4q,LipsAre,9,Wed Jun 10 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"1500 to pull a motor and re-attach the flywheel is absolute robbery. There's 3 hours of labor tops in that. Even at 150/hr you're still looking at 450 bucks, plus some small parts. Where's that other grand coming from?   Have you tried manually turning the engine over? Get a big crescent wrench on the lower pulley and turn it over clockwise. (put it in neutral just in case). If it spins, at least the engine isn't locked up.  Also, your mechanic would be hard-pressed to correctly diagnose that unless he's already got the engine pulled back away from the trans or he pulled the starter out (so he can either see or feel that the flywheel is out of place.) If he's done no work on the car other than turn it over and listen to the starter engage, he can't possibly make that diagnosis. There could be a fault in the starter (I want to say the bendix unit, but that might be incorrect), so all you hear when you turn it over is a little whine like a small RC car motor spinning  Assuming it's just that the flywheel was torqued incorrectly (which isn't great but isn't catastrophic), you can easily do this work yourself for tons less cash.  253 foot pounds of torque is the correct spec for the flywheel gland nut. If it spun loose, save the stress and just buy a new one for the 12 bucks it'll cost you. You'll need a flywheel lock (10 bucks), a torque wrench (that will do high enough torque to get to 253 foot pounds), and a couple of friends to hold the engine down (or some place to wedge it up so it won't move while you torque it). Most auto parts stores will rent you a torque wrench if you don't have one as well.  If it did more damage (and I suspect you'd know, it would have made horrible noises and thrown up all over itself when you drove it), then you may have to replace additional parts. 1500 bucks is enough to replace the entire longblock in most markets, and I strongly suspect your mechanic is trying to take you for a ride."
beetle,398x4q,fatalifeaten,3,Wed Jun 10 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"thanks for the long and insightful advice. My guy pulled the engine, or so he told me. I saw him raise the car.   I pulled the starter myself and looked into the bell housing. Like I said, I tried a number of things before going to the lengths of towing it to Tony.  Thanks for the info about the torque foot pounds for the gland nut. I'm seriously considering replacing the crank-shaft myself. I can't afford to spend 1500... it really leaves me with no other options."
beetle,398x4q,fatalifeaten,3,Wed Jun 10 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"Hold up there. Is the crank damaged or the flywheel? Your initial post said flywheel had come off. That's very different than the crank. Flywheel is the toothed wheel at the front (car front) of the engine where the clutch and pressure plate live that connects to the transmission. The crank lives inside the engine and is where you hand the connecting rods and pistons. If the crank is damaged, you're rebuilding the engine. This isn't crazy complicated but it's something you are going to want to do some research on and have a friend around to help with the first time. If you have to rebuild the engine, plan on a weekend to do it the first time.  Did the flywheel damage the dowel pins on the crank, or perhaps damage the thread bore for the gland nut? From your description, it sounds like it was running and driving OK the short time you drove it, so I'm kinda surprised to read that you're talking about a crank now..."
beetle,398x4q,eric_fri,3,Wed Jun 10 04:20:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks. All I know is that Tony, the mechanic, told me the flywheel came off and the crank would need to be replaced. That's what I'm going on at this point.   I'll head down to the shop tomorrow to get my beetle and I'll get as much info from Tony as I can at that time. thanks to you and everyone for the help so far!"
beetle,398x4q,fatalifeaten,3,Wed Jun 10 04:30:04 2015 UTC,"You can drill 4 new holes into the crankshaft where the flywheel attaches.  I've dealt with this issue myself, what I did was get a new flywheel with 8 holes (common with higher output engines) and used the four original holes to hold it in place.  Then drill the four new holes, when you're done you now have 8 holes in the crankshaft.  I used oversized dowels since I damaged the original four holes, they were longer and wider, allowing more contact and removal of the damaged area."

I'm guessing you've found this topic - (link); I followed that when taking mine apart and it snapped back on fine, didn't have to re-crimp the edge.    I'd take the worse of the two rings and play with it, see if you can't gently persuade it back into shape.

beetle,38y8dv,thelastraconteur,6,Sun Jun 7 21:26:07 2015 UTC,Sounds like a bad ground.  Check the ground strap between chassis/trans (sometimes they are 40+ years old)   Check ground between battery and chassis.  And make sure the VR is grounded well.  Are you using the new Bosch Solid state voltage regulator?
beetle,38y8dv,Cookaacoo,4,Mon Jun 8 13:59:44 2015 UTC,"Agree Agree Agree my friend. I bought a 40 inch battery cable and ran it straight from battery to transmission strap also. This fixed me right on up.  EDIT: GROUND CABLE, NEGATIVE SIDE"
beetle,38y8dv,CultOfEight,2,Mon Jun 8 14:45:32 2015 UTC,This is the voltage regulator I've bought all three times now. And I know that the ground from the battery is original. The wiring in it is ancient. The car is my dads (I drive a 65 Ford Falcon) and he's mentioned that the wiring appears to be all original. What exactly makes the Bosch's so good? Everyone seems to love them and I'm just now hearing about them.
beetle,38y8dv,windetch,2,Tue Jun 9 05:41:35 2015 UTC,"The original style voltage reg works like this - (pic).  They're actually mechanical, with all the limitations that brings.    The solid state Bosch voltage regs (link) have no moving parts and will deliver a more reliable output.    The old style generally works fine, people have run them for years, but if you're replacing it anyways you might as well go for the better model (which isn't much more expensive than that Import Direct model). btw, you can pop the top off the old style and see what's up, they're relatively simple things.   But yeah, if those grounds are original replace them.  Make sure the mounting surfaces are clean bare metal.    The rest of the wiring, /shrug.  If it works you can leave it for now, but old, brittle wiring will give you headaches (as you're finding out).  Can order a full wiring harness from jbugs etc, there's not much to it (relatively)."
beetle,38y8dv,windetch,4,Tue Jun 9 13:42:32 2015 UTC,"What type/brand of voltage regs are you using and are you sure they're dead?  Bosch makes a solid state one that works well.    Curious what debugging steps you've already tried besides throwing replacement parts in, have you measured the voltage coming off the generator vs the regulator?    Might replace the ground strap on the battery and transmission, funny things happen when you've got a bad ground."
beetle,38v4rx,curtquarquesso,2,Sun Jun 7 02:22:29 2015 UTC,"So a weekend or two ago, I asked you guys some transmission questions, and /u/Lighter_Klepto really came through for me. The bad pressure plate was causing the lurching and rough shifting. Many thanks. :)  My next issue: I replaced the copper crush washers under the intake manifold intakes, and tightened it down best I could. In hindsight, there was nothing wrong with the intake manifold, but I figured why not while I had the engine out. Those two nuts on either side are impossible to get at.   I ran the car, and I can't get any power out of it. Barely runs unless you put the pedal to the floor, and even then, no actual power. Symptoms point to leaky intake manifold. I obviously don't have the things tightened down enough to crush the copper crush washers.   I need to remove the nuts, and put on fresh ones that aren't rounded off, but more importantly, ones I can tighten and loosen without driving myself up the wall. Any recommendations for new nuts, or methods to getting the intake clamped on there good and tight?"

They are only 6mm threads so they will strip easy.   From memory 7ft lbs is all it should take to tighten them. Check your manual to be sure.
beetle,38v4rx,having_a_blast,2,Sun Jun 7 04:46:13 2015 UTC,"Will do. If I get them all the way to seven ft-lb, and the issue persists, is it possible that I picked the wrong crush gaskets in the intake? They seemed to barely fit on the larger side. I've never installed those, so I don't know how they're supposed to fit from experience. I suppose when I yank the things, I'll know whether they crushed and deformed properly.   Is it possible to get them torqued down with the engine in the car? My aircooled mechanic buddy says he always does it with the engine out."
beetle,38v4rx,fatalifeaten,2,Sun Jun 7 04:56:16 2015 UTC,"It can be done with the engine in. I normally take the engine seal out but leave everything else intact. If your engine to body seal is not in perfect shape, dont remove it. Either way with the seal in or out it is going to take some patience.   The crush washer should be a little tight in the hole in the head. I have had good luck with putting the joint of the crush washer towards the head rather than the intake manifold"

beetle,38v0af,TheBotanist,2,Sun Jun 7 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like RetroSound is what you want, they have  usb + aux, but run a little on the pricey side.  (link)  With a stock, unhacked dash your options are basically RetroSound or a used older shaft-style unit (Pyle makes one too, but it's a little on the crappy side).  I went to a you-pull-it auto salvage place and found an Alpine unit (pic); not exactly period correct, but functional (even without it's knobs).  I run a separate amp, so when I want to plug in my phone I just swap out the input cable.  If you just want the ability to listen via an aux port that's an option, and keep the existing radio for aesthetics only.    If your dash is already cut, or you don't care about cutting the radio opening wider, your options for radios is wide open.  Pick something you like."
beetle,38v0af,windetch,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly  the 60s & 70s Blaupunkts and Beckers had aux input. Of course it was 5-pin DIN connector but you can put signal from any headphone output into it and it will sound ... well, not perfect, but as good as the radio can. A friend has a 6V Blaupunkt from 60s in his bus and an stick-style mp3-player pushing signal into it. Works like a charm. But mono of course, no stereo at that time.  Funny thing is that many radios in 80s or 90s didn't have any aux inputs. ( A Sony and a Blaupunkt checked: No inputs.)  If you really want to go into 70s, you need an 8 track player and a AM/FM-module for that.  Check these (random pics from Google picture search): http://www.brucesallan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8-track-car-stereo.jpg and radio for it (sorry, best pic I could find): http://beforeitsnews.com/mediadrop/uploads/2014/29/e393a5b1f5a480d5bd113b49caff57f92d8833b1.jpg  USB input is harder, for that you need a modern radio. But beware, Beetle doesn't have standard sized hole for a modern radio, it's almost 1/4"" lower.  Retrosound is so small it will fit but many others will be a problem.  A thing I noticed once again when I tried to put a few years old Sony into my 412: No, doesn't fit. Not even near."

Replacing the pin usually requires a special tool and probably getting the Wolfsburg West oversized pin.  The method performed looks great and goes with the styling of the year.  I owned a parts 68 vert and it had the threaded factory hole for a mirror on the passenger side door."
beetle,38izxp,winewagens,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:48:35 2015 UTC,I didn't know that the post 67's came that way. I think the door mounted mirror looks very good for the later cars. I just didn't know that was the standard mirror location for those later year cars.
beetle,38izxp,dwee370,2,Fri Jun 5 01:36:05 2015 UTC,The mirror moved to the driver door from the hinge in 1968.  Passenger doors didn't get one from the factory on sedans in the USA.  The doors should be the same on LHD and RHD cars so the inner structure has the hole.  The paper  template helps locate it for installation as done by the OP or probably also by dealerships in the 70s.

Might as well see what they look like.    There's a gear box on the other side of the motor which likely has it's original ~50 year old grease in it.  Would be good to get in there and repack it. The arm on the end of the motor shaft comes off somehow; bravo1616 over at theSamba has the same wiper motor (link), might PM her and see if she ever got it off? Shouldn't be that bad, but without poking it I donno (my '70's looks like (this), works the same but goes together a little different).  's possible someone here knows, theSamba wasn't much help in the above topic.    Good luck!

I've followed this tutorial when rekeying some locks.  It isn't very hard.  It just takes a few extra door handles (which you can get off Thesamba or at a swap for cheap) and patience.  The ignition tumbler has a pair of flathead screws that make it easy to remove after you pull the wheel (27mm nut) and turnsignal stalk (4 flathead screws).  You'll have to put the key in the tumbler to lock the wafers in place to pull it out after you remove the tiny flathead set screw that holds the electrical portion of the switch in place.

beetle,37j2jn,ToxicTacoCat,2,Thu May 28 00:11:27 2015 UTC,"So I am selling my first car because its just too much.    Please clarify. If your current car is a 90's+ and you think it's too much work you're in for a bad time with a bug.    Low mileage is an interesting request.  The speedometer only has 5 main digits, so after 99,999.9 miles it's gonna roll back to zero. (And it can be very easily tampered with (illegal! but people do it))  An old bug can be legitimately low mileage, but it'd have to have the paperwork to verify it is...  and even then.    Just fyi, seems like these aircooled VW engines are good for ~ 100k miles before they need a rebuild.  Some get more, some get less.    As far as engines, the 1971+ 1600cc DP engines are reasonably peppy.  As you get older you get slower and less and less power. Fuel injection started in 1975.    All the rubber hoses I'd change out regardless of what they looked like anyways. Fuel hoses, brake hoses, etc.  All cheap and fairly easy to swap out.    Rust is your biggest enemy.  Unless you have a welder and experience using it rust can be very expensive to take care of. There's a link on the side bar for a general buyers' guide."
beetle,37j2jn,windetch,2,Thu May 28 13:42:07 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks and no it's a 7,000 lb suv that sucks gas like a truck. I'm mechanically savvy. I don't mind a little work and a rebuild is fine I plan on doing a some internal stuff to it like new rods, pistons, crank, cam, exhaust, intake."
beetle,37j2jn,windetch,2,Thu May 28 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Cool. ""I'm mechanically savvy.""  Wish people would start with that, it's relevant :P  As an additional note, if I had the choice between restored vs mostly unmolested I'd go for the latter myself.  Some people are great and do everything properly, but I'm afraid those are in the minority...  especially if it was restored for the express purpose of selling.  There's a number of cheap aftermarket parts out there with less than stellar quality.   Price depends on location, you'll get a nicer bug for less money in California than, say, Michigan. It's not all that uncommon for people to buy a rust free Arizona car and ship it to their state. $4k should get you a decent starting point wherever you are, unless you really want an early 60's or older."
beetle,37j2jn,Fweaka,2,Thu May 28 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I have a guy my buddy is related to I met the other day and he can source me a good one in my price range.

You can probably google all of this or if you're set on get a bug then buy the John Muir idiots guide. It'll tell you what to look for."
beetle,37j2jn,Fweaka,2,Thu May 28 08:08:38 2015 UTC,Alright sweet thanks. That's the first time I've actually never heard of that magnet thing. But I can replace all panels if need be.
beetle,37j2jn,Fweaka,2,Thu May 28 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just hard to find quality replacement products. Yeah just wrap a magnet in a thin cloth so it doesn't scratch the car. Then just run it over places of the fenders, hood, doors, etc. If it doesn't stick or very faintly sticks then there may be bondo under there."
beetle,37irvu,TangoDown13,3,Wed May 27 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"Every time I pull VW heads, I put in new exhaust valves. It's cheap insurance as they are notorious for dropping exhaust valves, and THAT ain't pretty."
beetle,37irvu,teninchtires,1 point,Thu May 28 00:43:17 2015 UTC,Any recommendations for valve brands?
beetle,37irvu,teninchtires,1 point,Thu May 28 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"Not particularly. Just get them from a local parts house that specializes in air-cooled VW's, if you are lucky enough to have one nearby. If not, I have always liked Mid America Motorworks.  http://www.mamotorworks.com/VW/   Stainless steel valves are best, but a little more expensive. Again, it's cheap peace of mind compared to trashing your entire engine. Years ago, I was passing a truck on the interstate highway when #3 exhaust valve separated from the valve stem. It was amazing. It destroyed every part in that engine! I ordered a long block engine outright from Mofoco, and had many miles of smiles till I sold it.  http://www.mofoco.com/category/Engines/c46  A quick test I do is, with the heads on the bench, and the valves still in, I fill the ports with water and see if the water seeps past the valve seat into the combustion chamber area. If there is no leakage, you should be able to lap the new valves in. If the water leaks past the seat, you need a valve job. Then take the valve springs off and check for excessive valve guide wear. There should be just a little side to side play, similar to the play in the intake valves. If there is noticeable play in the exhaust guides, that's another indication for a valve job and the engine machinist will replace them for you. You can use their parts if they do the valve job, just request that they use stainless exhaust valves. And check your crankshaft end play. It's another ""Go-No go"" test. If the thrust play is within specs, that's a good sign your crank bearings are in pretty good shape and you may not have to split the cases, but if it has excessive play, you're going to have to go further down the rabbit hole with align boring the case, and all the stuff kizzlebizz mentioned. It can be a slippery slope! An experienced engine machinist is worth tracking down. Hopefully it won't be too bad if your crank thrust and guides are tight. I'm just paranoid about those used exhaust valves! Good luck!"
beetle,37irvu,teninchtires,1 point,Thu May 28 05:52:46 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that when I pull and tug on the belt pulley in the back of the engine and there is no movement, I do not have to split the case and change the bearings? They are good?"
beetle,37irvu,kizzlebizz,1 point,Thu May 28 21:48:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda sorta. The fore and aft play should be .003 - .006"" (three to six thousandths of an inch). Since it had been running, it is at least .003"" or it would have seized. What I would check for, is excessive play. If you grab the crank pulley and push it towards the flywheel end, then pull it back, and you feel (or even hear) a clunk, you need to split the cases, or you are throwing good money at a bad case. If it's within specs (less than .006 or .007) that is a good indication your main bearings are good, because the thrust bearing usually goes bad first. It's not a guarantee, it's merely a good indication. And with the pistons removed, gently rock the connecting rods from side to side to feel for bad rod bearings. There should be just a little side to side play and NO in and out play. If those two things seem OK, I would be reluctant to split the case especially in a 'do it yourself' setting. Here is a good overview of the procedure using a shop made tool and a feeler gauge. I find it easier to use a dial indicator, and for this purpose, a cheap (~$30.00) one with a magnetic or clamp on base is good enough.   http://www.aircooledtech.com/end_play/  The John Muir book ""How to keep your Volkswagen alive"" is a delightfully written and informational book of step by step procedures for all air-cooled VW's. If you own a VW, it's a must have manual.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/How-to-Keep-Your-Volkswagen-VW-Alive-Step-by-Step-Manual-for-Complete-Idiots-/121660164313?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c5382c8d9  Just relax, take your time with it and enjoy the learning experience. Part of the fun of owning a VW is being able to work on it yourself. Happy wrenching!"
beetle,37irvu,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Fri May 29 00:34:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. You've been a big help. As far as I can tell, there's hardly any movement at all. I'm certain it's about as solid as it can get in terms of end play. I'll have to check the rod bearings, though."
beetle,37irvu,fatalifeaten,2,Fri May 29 03:28:24 2015 UTC,"Stock engine? Goals? Daily driver or weekend warrior? How long has the engine been together? I ask these questions to help. If you have a stock engine, daily driver, and need it back together, just replace the parts, lap the cylinders into the heads, re-set the valves and go to town.   Opposite that, if the engine has been together for a while, and something caused an issue enough to crack a piston, AND you have time and money, it is cheaper to replace parts and refresh a running  engine than to wait til it fails and have to replace something major. This will require a machine shop align boring the case, polishing the crank, replacing crank and rod bearings, re setting end play, and re assembling. At this point you would be good to add a small cam and replace lifters as well. Mind you this may be in vain if you find that the engine was rebuilt recently, or if you find the case needs more work than can be done (too many thrust cuts usually get the bucket from me). Hope this helps!"

Honestly though, the cars earned a reputation of being ridiculously easy to service and can take a fair bit of abuse.  With that said, they attract a lot of people who aren't competent mechanics with a false sense of confidence and tiny budget.  A huge number of the 'problems' encountered are simply kludges from previous owners.  If you use original (or high quality) parts and service it according to official procedures, it will be just as reliable as they were new.  That comes with the caveat that they require more frequent and slightly more involved service than a modern car."

I am fortunate enough to live only 2 miles from where I work, have some flexibility in hours, and other guys that work there who are willing to pick me up etc. That being said, once I got all the ""bugs"" worked out, and replaced ALOT of things, needed or not, my 75 super b convertible is pretty reliable these days. That being said, here are factors to consider. How far you are driving. Is this your only transportation. Are you able to call in and get either the day off or enough time to handle whatever may arise.   The second part of that demon being, how mechanically inclined are you? It took me some time and dedication to learn all the things I needed to know to get ""in synch"" with my car. I carry a variety of spare parts and tools. So that when something does come up, I know enough to know where to go to and how to start the evaluation process.  Every one of them is different, and you may be gravy to drive yours daily to work, just plan on educating yourself. I have heard over and over that it takes either time or money. If this bad boy has sat for a long time there is no telling what condition all the systems are in friend and until you know. It is likely that they will present themselves to you in the form of breaking down, not starting up, and frustrating the HELL out of you. You will get there if you stick with it. Just don't lose your job over it!!! Two GREAT things you have going for you: the community is strong and supportive. I LOVE fellow beetle owners. Greatest brotherhood that ever existed. Bikers wave. Beetle owners stop and get under the hood with you. Second, parts EVERYWHERE. I doubt you will ever have a problem finding parts as the resources are everywhere.

I know a few guys who have only owned bugs their whole lives who are very willing to help out. I'm a young guy working two jobs to pay for school and a car, but an opportunity arose where my parents offered to pay for the bug initially in return for their entire house painted inside and out which I took, and now I'm picking the bug up on Saturday or Sunday if the insurance works out. I'll be living with a bus stop right outside my front door and my roommate with his truck in case I really need a drive. I will be borrowing my grandfather's suv for the winter if we decide keeping a car around is necessary, so I think it I can work around the wonders of an antique.   Definitely mechanically inclined, I live and breathe this stuff it seems. I think I know what I'm in for, just not sure what to expect for keeping the thing going all the time.

beetle,36hd0s,kuppajava,2,Tue May 19 14:52:41 2015 UTC,"As long as you are good about at making repairs when an old part wears out and performing routine maintenance, there is nothing that makes an air cooled VW a bad daily driver. There is a more that you have to do than on a modern car: much more frequent oil changes, and grease points mostly.  If it's a Super Beetle, watch for worn struts and rubber on the front end. This causes the dreaded ""Super Shimmies"", and if you let it persist, will ruin your steering box.  I daily drove my Beetle for a few years. Since I never could afford a good engine, I just kept a cheap spare around. I broke a crank and blew a rear main seal, but both times I had a spare ready to swap in, and was back on the road in a couple hours. Sounds like you're good in that department though.  The thing is, those last two paragraphs sound super scary to people who are not mechanically inclined. It's not though. And the only reason I had to deal with those things was that it was a super shitty car to begin with, and I was the first person to preform any maintenance on it in a long time."

Since it seems that you have experience working on old metal and since you have access to secondary transportation, you should not have any issues."
beetle,36hd0s,windetch,2,Tue May 19 18:12:55 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is, 40+ years ago (my bug is almost 50), cars were not the same as cars today. They all broke down somewhat frequently, but were designed to be easily fixed. Today cars rarely leave you on the side of the road, but are a lot harder/expensive to fix when they do.  I own 3 cars, the newest of them is a '67 triumph (it was never reliable enough to consider transportation, even when new, it is just a toy), my daily driver is a '65 ford econoline, and I have a modified '66 bug with a 180HP 2175cc engine in it.  All of these cars need constant maintenance, repairs, and general looking after, but unlike a ""modern car"" they are all still going nearly 50 years later.  So it comes down to this: Do you want a car you can depend on almost 100% that you discard after a few years, or a car you can depend on 95%, but will last forever...   I made my choice, and am happy with it.  EDIT: VW engines will never last like a toyota, you don't get 300,000 miles out of one... 100,000 is about all you can expect for a stock engine (much less if not maintained well, or abused)"
beetle,36hd0s,kurazaybo,1 point,Tue May 19 21:08:20 2015 UTC,"Tbh, they're about as reliable as any other 40+ year old car.    The older cars need more care. These need their valves adjusted and oil changed ~ every 2 - 3k miles.  Brakes need adjusted regularly as the pads wear.  There's various grease points that should be hit occasionally.    A 90's + Honda, Ford, etc if you just keep the oil changed every 5 - 6k and they're usually happy enough.  They come with proper oil filters (your aircooled VW engine came from the factory with a screen mesh strainer).  Valves are hydraulic, and the brakes self adjust.    Unless the car has always been owned by someone you trust you don't really know how it was taken care of. Many, many of the aftermarket parts are just crappy.  Poor fit, poor performance.  But cheap!  So people buy them, especially right before a car is sold.    As long as you come in with realistic expectations, plan to do the maintenance, and are able to just sigh when the accelerator cable snaps and strands you...  you're good to go. Congrats on your new bug."
beetle,36hd0s,funkmachine7,1 point,Tue May 19 14:08:14 2015 UTC,I've been using my (mexican) 1999 and things rarely fail without warning. Most times when something fails enough to leave me on the side of the road it's either something super simple (like a bad spark plug wire or a faulty battery). When it is properly and regularly serviced  it's still a very competitive commuter and super easy to find where to park.
beetle,36gh0w,JahKewn,1 point,Tue May 19 05:05:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a Mesa guy, and even in winter you really don't need the choke. We just don't get cold enough (even the rare below freezing mornings), to need it. I'd suggest adding a degree or 2 of advance, making sure your plugs and points are correctly gapped, and then maybe push your idle up a hair. It'll still take a few minutes to get it warmed up, but at least you won't have to give it the beans to keep it from stalling out on startup. I ran a 34 PICT-3 on my stock d/p 1600 with the choke wired open and, while it was a little rough at idle until it warmed up, it wouldn't stall out, even in the coldest weather. By this time of year, I was on the road in 30 sec or less."

If/when I do I'll put together a short picture walkthrough.    's not bad though, hardest part is getting the wiper assembly out as VW really tucked it up in there (on a Standard, Supers are easy). On a Standard just start pulling stuff out till you can see the wiper assembly.  Fresh air box, radio, some of the vents.  I've read where some people don't remove the glovebox, but do it anyways as that bit of extra clearance is handy and it comes out easily. There's a bolt at the motor and at each of the wiper arm mounts.  Get it free then start wiggling.    When it's out just start unbolting things, take pictures as you go if you'd like a reference when putting it back together.  Be careful not to lose the springs in the motor; they're light, flighty little things. Here's a pic of the inside of a motor I scrawled on earlier - (pic); the green arrows point at the brushes, these will spring free (literally) if you pull the center spinny bit out.  The brushes rub on the shiney coppery part (communicator) and they do wear out.  If it looks like there's plenty left leave 'em alone, if there's just stubs you'll want to replace.    Where you see any old clumps of grease remove and replace with new, and any other place two parts will be rubbing together apply a thin coat of grease.    Assembly is just the reverse. If you run into issues feel free to ask, I might be able to help point you in the right direction."

Just a short little blue piece off the end of a wire lead. Upon further inspection, I believe my license plate light got torn to bits. Bad news all around. Also see oil in the right side intake.

Infact, you probably need to shave a little more out, if that was a 6v transmission you'll need to clearance it. Link for you - http://www.thebugshop.org/bsfq12v6.htm  If you're using your old throwout bearing with whatever pressure plate came mounted on your late model engine they may not be compatible.

If you concern more for the enjoyment of your car than for originality, I would surely recommend  using a vw paper filter enclosure with your choice of filter. It'll fit."
beetle,35phg9,redbug74,1 point,Tue May 12 16:37:48 2015 UTC,"Oil bath all the way, man. Even a partially complete oil bath is better than any aftermarket paper filter as long as it has the hose nipple for the crankcase ventilation hose. Plus it has a built-in velocity stack.. what's not to love?"

beetle,35hx6q,fatalifeaten,3,Sun May 10 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"So I actually got to Michael via google plus, it's not a 1300, it's a '56 correct 36 horse (1200). he said all the accessories are 100% correct, and nothing on the car is newer than '56. Just makes it all that much sexier, IMO. :)"
beetle,35hx6q,fatalifeaten,2,Tue May 12 16:30:31 2015 UTC,Well observed indeed! This just doesn't stop getting better!! This car is the closest to a perfect bug I've ever seen.
beetle,35hx6q,kippen,4,Tue May 12 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"Thing of beauty. Speedo is in KM, so a lot of that run was between 60-90 kph. On my side of the pond, that's 35-55mph. Even at those relatively low speeds, you feel like you're flying watching this run. Then there's that gauge pod clamped around the steering column. So very. Much want. Same with the tach. Craploads of period correct old speed racing parts on that car. You can tell he's picking up the inside rear wheel in the corners too by the steering correction and the engine revving because a wheel's off the ground. Swingaxles don't like to slide out unless you strap them down (think camber compensator)  Great share OP."
beetle,35hx6q,wiso4,2,Mon May 11 02:46:58 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right. This video is as good as it gets: The atmosphere is unique: leather jacket, hat, vintage sunglasses and awesome driving gloves.   Anyways, Michael`s driving is really classic, without forcing the car beyond its limits, however using well all it can offer.  Minor suspension arrangements were made according to the video`s description (and was probably lowered as well) to guarantee a smoother drive when the tires recover grip after the harder curves. A common feature of RWD and short axle distance can be noticed: slight tendency to understeer when entering and progressing the curves, which is reversed in oversteer in the exit. All natural, controlled and without any pain. Pure fun.  The Okrasa engine kit is a masterpiece. The company is considered today as the oldest VW engine tuner in the planet (you may now know it with its current name: Oettinger Sportsystems). The kit installed on Michael`s car consists of a couple Solex 32 PBIC (same used on the porsche 356 at the time), Fram air filter, new oil radiators, chrome-molybdenum crankshaft and new cylinder head as well as dimensioned exhaust. This kit supposedly raises the engine power from 36 to 48 cv which is quite significant on such a small engine.  Nowadays, the original kits are extremely rare and outrageously expensive. However, luckily there are companies that manufacture them with original okrasa specs. For those who live in the US I guess Wolfsburg West makes them in there.   For those who seek more high-quality bug orchestra, check this out: Okrasa TSV 1300 first start - video of the same car."

beetle,35k1dz,Fweaka,6,Mon May 11 02:54:22 2015 UTC,"That's water vapor in the oil. Normally, as the engine heats up it burns off as steam through the breather hose. If you: Dont have a thermostat, Or take short drives. or have stronger oil cooler springs (routing the oil to the cooler ALL the time) which causes the engine oil to never really reach operating temp, that moister builds up, mixes with oil and you get that. Send me a photo of your engine so I can check if your hoses are on right."

beetle,35hcdm,k_spencer,2,Sun May 10 11:13:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure yet. Haven't done a rebuild, so I'm trying to figure out my options..."
beetle,35hcdm,dadsbug,3,Sun May 10 11:51:28 2015 UTC,"If you are doing a rebuild I have suggestions based on budget.  Electronic Ignition - Replacing the points with this lessens maintenance and does improve performance.  Header - This will help breathing a lot.  If you are changing internals...   Engle 110 cam and 1.25:1 rockers. This improves breathing and power. Counterweight crank. Necessary if you want to rev. Heads - 40mm intake, 35.5 exhaust 90.5mm bore cylinders. This takes it to a 1776cc engine Weber carbs. Either a single 32/36 pregressive DFV or, a pair of 34mm ICTs or, a pair of 40mm IDFs   I am not a fan of chrome engine tin, it holds heat and is likely not as good quality as the original. Clean the original tin and re-use.   Next time, place that fuel filter before the fuel pump. It is bad to pressurize those filters only to have it fail, spray fuel and cause a fire."
beetle,35hcdm,k_spencer,3,Wed May 13 10:12:31 2015 UTC,"Good choices... but if you do the 110 cam and 1.25:1 rockers, be sure to have dual hi rev springs installed on the heads. A 110 cam is designed for stock rockers and the additional lift of the ratio rockers puts a lot of crush on the valve springs.   With a set of mildly ported 40x35.5 heads and compression around 8.5:1, a set of well tuned 40IDF and a good exhaust - you can plan of a solid 80HP or more at 5K. For the same money you can go 94mm pistons (1915) and get over 100hp.   So begs to ask - How fast can your budget afford to go?"
beetle,35hcdm,k_spencer,1 point,Wed May 13 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"Heh, probably not that fast. I'm just looking for reliability over performance I think at this point."
beetle,35hcdm,k_spencer,1 point,Wed May 13 22:45:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips!  I'm thinking of going with the 87mm bore so I don't need to do any machining of the heads or case.  Other than that pretty much keeping the internals stock.
beetle,35hcdm,redbug74,2,Thu May 14 12:16:53 2015 UTC,"Avoid the 87mm slip in pistons. They have thin walls which can warp and have a problem sealing. I have them and wish I did not.  I suggest getting 90.5mm, getting the machine work done and having a 1776cc. Otherwise, stick with 85.5mm stock bore and get a quality set of pistons/cylinders."

beetle,35hcdm,wintertash,2,Fri May 29 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"I am going to suggest this kit and, get a counter-weighted crank so you can rev.

beetle,357rpu,Bermwolf,1 point,Thu May 7 20:37:42 2015 UTC,Excellent thank you. Would hate to spend the time and money and not fit
beetle,357rpu,winewagens,1 point,Thu May 7 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"Make sure the pressure plate is the same style after you redo the spare engine.  There are two different types, and I forget offhand what year they changed.  12V bus engines 67-71 and bug engines 67-79 are all 200mm clutch and interchange.  12V Ghia engines also interchange.  The tin work is the same on them other than the bellhousing tin on an early bay bus.  T3 engines have different overall cooling and tin, but can be put in the others as long as they are converted to upright fans and the tin is swapped.    If stock the 68 engine will be single port and have a generator, your 75 super will be a dual port with alternator.  The alternator vs generator thing will be a bit of an issue for you when going to do a direct plug and play swap.  Edit:  Since your super is a 1975 it came from the factory with fuel injection.  Maybe somebody converted it to carbs in the past?  You didn't say.  The engine compartment of a FI beetle is different in dimensions than that of a non FI dp bug.  The cylinder head tin has extensions on it to seal the engine compartment properly.  I have a few of them in my junk, but haven't poked around on thesamba for a photo yet to show you the difference."

beetle,353zn8,BlueBeetle73,1 point,Thu May 7 13:24:48 2015 UTC,Its an odd year. Hard to find specific parts.  For me the heart ache is mostly about the steering and the electrical.  Steering rebuild is like 1000$ on a super vs max 500 on a regular.  Electrical because 73 is a specific year with specific stuff. Diagrams and rebuild kits dont exist for this year.  Got a picture?
beetle,353zn8,jjjboy,1 point,Thu May 7 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't had issues finding parts. You just need to know if it's early or late 73.  Thats a problem with all supers though. And it's not that bad, you can do it bit by bit. And even then a full front steering kit is a few hundred max. I've seen full rebuild kits for like 400 or so iirc.   Electrical? Again, I've got a Haynes manual and it's got all the stuff I need for mine. Plus the electrical system in Beetle's is so simple compared to anything else I'm used to working on its nothing to just kinda figure it out. Plus Google let's you find some good wiring diagrams."
beetle,353zn8,BlueBeetle73,1 point,Fri May 8 03:07:38 2015 UTC,The electrical thing is more my failing than anything else :( I am terrified I will start and the car will never run again.

Replaced Bad Starter Solenoid (it wouldn't start on me :'( ) Steering gearbox (it was broken) Ball Joints (broken and made in China) Master cylinder, Wheel cylinders, and Brake Shoes!! (VERY IMPORTANT) Rebuild Front Suspension, everything but tie-rod ends (not broken but improves handling) New Intake Manifold and 34 Carburetor (you won't regret it, best replacement imo) Timed it with a light and set the timing advance Head Adjustment, Valve cover seal replacement, and Firing order check (best to do all at once) Comprehensive Maintenance. Oil change (Valvoline VR1 Non syn racing oil 10-50 or 25-50 works the best), Transmission oil change, new Bosch spark plugs and plug wires, replacing and setting points, replaced fuel filter, and replaced oil screen. A good cleaning. (this is honestly the most important) Complete seal replacement (I was leaking a lot of oil) Replaced starter solenoid Again! (Arced my battery with my backseat. Oops) Replaced Small Battery with Giant Battery (in case my generator breaks) Replaced engine tins (mine were missing, they're essential to cooling) New Distributor Replaced Cooling Fan (mine was cracked) Replaced Engine and Transmission Mounts (broken) Replaced J-tubes with Heater Boxes New alternated fuel pump and fuel line (mine broke) Electronic ignition (improves start up) Full Set of New tires Fixed some general electrical issues including replacing my voltage regulator New Gas Shocks New Axles    From here I plan to take out my stock 1600 engine and rebuild it into an 1835 and add and oil coolers at the same time. After that duel carburetors, a performance exhaust, then freeway flyer bus transmission.   Edit* I should also mention that I work in a shop that restores Volkswagens, occasionally other German cars also. I've seen some pretty amazing bugs."

beetle,353zn8,winewagens,1 point,Thu May 7 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"Get yourself a duffle bag so that when you start replacing things you can put the old ones in it and stuff it in the trunk. This gives you some roadside spares that may rescue you. Also, if you don't have one already, start up a toolbox to keep in there. As you are working on it take note of what you use and put one in the box!"
beetle,3537rs,spacehogg,1 point,Wed May 6 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yes the line should have fuel in it and it will pour out. What I do is split an old piece of fuel line and wrap it around the outside of the existing fuel in. An inch or so will do. Then clamp the line with a pair of vise grips to stop fuel from running out. The piece of old rubber line on the outside will protect your existing fuel line from the teeth on the vise grips. The vise grips don't need to be super tight  Just enough to close the line. I normally just replace the whole pump. I don't think I've ever done a rebuild on a fuel pump.   Edit: what is the problem, exactly?"
beetle,3537rs,14_year_old_girl,1 point,Wed May 6 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"Fuel isn't coming out after removing the pump, but it was when I had the front of the car jacked up so my concern is that the fuel line has blockage. Or possibly the car is on a down slant?"
beetle,3537rs,richcreations,1 point,Wed May 6 20:17:06 2015 UTC,"it will gravity feed with a full tank, or when the front end is lifted, but not all the time, otherwise there would be no need for a pump..."
beetle,3537rs,windetch,1 point,Wed May 6 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"Fuel should be flowing through the line if the level of gas in the tank is higher than the end of the hose. Simple gravity flow thing. Got a fuel filter?  Checked it?  If gas came out in a steady stream when you had the front of the car lifted 's probably alright. Using an air compressor and blowing through the line shouldn't hurt anything though, just limit the pressure.    The fuel pump push rod does not need to be replaced, but make sure you get the appropriate fuel pump.  There's two main types, and mismatching can cause damage or the pump wont work (different length rods). Skim this post here - (link)  If you haven't replaced your rubber fuel hoses in years now might be a good time, since you're messing with the fuel system anyways.  Consider buying proper sized cloth covered hose from an acvw supplier."
beetle,3537rs,14_year_old_girl,1 point,Wed May 6 20:45:25 2015 UTC,"I can't see why jacking the car up would help it come out. It normally flows well just by pulling the line with the car level. If the tank is low on gas, raising or lowering the front would stop it from coming through the line because it t drains from the center of the tank. At least it does on 67 and before, which is what I'm most familiar with."
beetle,3537rs,windetch,0,Thu May 7 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"Gravity? The tank is at the front of the car, the fuel pump where OP is removing the hose is at the back. You'd have to be very low on fuel before the angle of the car affected whether gas was able to flow out the bottom (given the car isn't upside down, but then you've got other issues).    Here's a good diagram - http://i.imgur.com/gSGv14G.jpg The tank outlet is basically level with the fuel pump. If the tank doesn't have much fuel or the nose of the car is angled slightly downwards you wont get much flow at the back. But if the front is raised you'll get a better flow."
beetle,3537rs,14_year_old_girl,1 point,Thu May 7 17:32:53 2015 UTC,So what I said is correct?
beetle,3537rs,windetch,1 point,Fri May 8 11:52:47 2015 UTC,"Defensive much?  If you'll re-read my post, I agree that the angle of the car doesn't really affect if gas comes out of the tank. But the OP isn't seeing if gas flows out there, he's looking at the back where the fuel pump is.  The angle of the car absolutely affects if gas makes it to the back. Please see the above picture.    If you have to, rotate your monitor so the front of the beetle in the picture is raised up and then observe the height of the tank relative to the engine. If you're still having issues with   I can't see why jacking the car up would help it come out.     I will make you another picture."
beetle,3537rs,winewagens,1 point,Fri May 8 12:38:26 2015 UTC,"If there is fuel in the tank it typically does leak out to some degree in a bug when removing the hose from the fuel inlet side of the pump.  If it doesn't come out then the line could be partly plugged or the wire mesh sock in the bottom of the tank could be plugged.  If you are putting on a new fuel pump just make sure its the same version (straight vs slanted) as what is on the car already.  The metal pushrods are different lengths and can cause problems if incorrectly paired.  You only need to remove the bakelite/plastic  under the pump if it's broken/cracked.  I've had no real issues when putting a new pump on with needing extra gaskets.  Just removed the old, installed the new, and didn't over-tighten it."

beetle,34l513,WWJLPD,7,Sat May 2 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"If it runs/drives/stops that's a great place to start. Get yourself a Bentley book to guide you in repairs and have at it. I wouldn't worry about the cosmetics until you have it mechanically sorted. For that price you could flip it for more and make a profit without doing anything, assuming something about it made you give up immediately.   Other than the obvious id check the floor pan to see how solid that is, check for leaks of any kind underneath, a little oil won't kill you but it's something to look at. Also if all 4 wheels seem like they're relatively where they should be. The left side of my torsion bar is bent and I had to get creative to work around it. You could tell by the terrible camber my left rear wheel used to have.  I hope this works out for you! Between here, the samba and a Bentley manual you have pretty much all of the resources you need to work on one."
beetle,34l513,gh0stmach1ne,3,Sat May 2 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, thanks!  So basically: floor pans, major leaks, major alignment issues."
beetle,34l513,gh0stmach1ne,3,Sat May 2 03:37:40 2015 UTC,"Basically. Also if there's any truly cancerous rust in the body work that will be terrible to deal with. Stuff like severe rust that's actually eating all the way through the pillars. In fact just behind the rear windows is a good place to check because those spots hold moisture really well.   Also if the car has been sitting for a decade as the ad says, be prepared to have some work done to the gas tank. There's no good way for you to actually check this one when going to buy it, but Volkswagen gas tanks weren't coated on the inside like all other gas tanks are, so when they sit for a while they tend to build up rust. If it's not too bad and the fuel filter is doing its job you may be able to drive it home no problem, but expect the possibility of having to remove the tank and get it cleaned/sealed at a shop. Doesn't really break the bank, just something to look out for."

beetle,34l513,ArtiSci,2,Sat May 2 05:08:51 2015 UTC,"Well it has a MA licence plate, so it might has seen a lot of salt in the winter. I would check the lower 4 inches and the inner fenders for rust. Maybe take a rubber hammer with you and check for holes and how solid the car really is."
beetle,34l513,kuppajava,1 point,Sat May 2 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"Good Lord, absolutely yes!  Any automobile that runs is worth 500 in parts alone unless it is currently on fire while you are negotiating the deal!  The minute you get it home, drain out all of the fluids and clean the whole car top to bottom like you had a disorder, checking everywhere for rust and damage and marking it on the body map that you should print out and have with you.  Clean it as hard-core as you have ever cleaned a car before so that you can at the end know EXACTLY what you are facing and also have it documented!    Once you have done  all of that, get your Bentley out and do a standard maintenance to it, checking plugs, points (if it has them, this is one of the first things I upgrade early on because I hate messing with points!), filters (check to see that the fuel filter is not too close to the engine and if so move it to closer to the tank) and look at all hoses and belts and document your findings.  Now, replace the oil strainer under the block (get the full oil-change kit and get it all sorted out right now while you are doing it the first time) and then refill your fluids.  Now, start that puppy again!  Now check brakes.  Now check them again!!!  Now drive your new old baby out and get gas and then take her to a brake place and have the brakes checked by a pro.    After all of this, your new project (a.k.a. all of your free time for the next decade) and you are ready for all sorts of fun in the adventure of Beetle ownership!"

Maybe one returning to earth...  but trust me, you don't want that kind of project.    My recommendation is to find a 68+, even (and esp) a Super, and use it to learn on.  Then later if you really want a sub-'66 you'll have the experience and know-how to work on it.    Vintage dealerships and Hemming's are mostly going to have collector's cars in great shape.  Your budget does not allow for that.    Keep an eye on your local craigslist.  If you're not in a hurry watch it for a while and learn about the trends for your area.  It'll become fairly plain what moves quickly and which cars are the same ones you're seeing month after month. I see you've already found theSamba's classifies :P  Can you weld, or do you want to learn? If you have no interest in welding prioritize a rust-free body above all else.  'cause most everything else can be repaired fairly easily, but if you can't weld the shop fees will be killer (I've seen heater channel repairs estimated at $1k/side, that's your entire budget in one go). I mean, get the most rust-free car you can regardless 'cause a lot of the new patch panels are kinda sucky.  But you get where I'm going with that.    Good luck in your search."

As for welding and the years go..I'm willing to learn how to weld and my dad would be a decent teacher for me.

beetle,348yk8,Ravewolf,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:18:20 2015 UTC,"I've talked to some VW restorations shops, they were pretty adament that the bug tranny could hold its own to a point. Unless you are hammering at it day in day out you aren't constantly hitting it with all the torque and HP that the motor could muster.   I think most sand rails scoop them up because of the durability concerns and they probably hit harder more of the time.  Never done it just from talking to people face to face at VW Shops about it my impression."
beetle,348yk8,khartster,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:40:03 2015 UTC,people say about 150 HP max.  But its what I've heard for the past 5 years.
beetle,348yk8,Cookaacoo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:50:42 2015 UTC,"I heard the transmission itself is tough, but the differential can't. But this is just me regurgitating what I've read online. I know some company sells a super diff, it's got 4 teeth or whatever rather than the stock 2. I'd say what the name of it was and what company but I was drunk when I read it all lmao. It was all too expensive for me to remember it, I ended up just buying a used trans for 300."
beetle,348yk8,AVANT96,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:34:14 2015 UTC,What's the rest of the car look like?  I may need parts for my 67 if you decided to chop up a decent one year only car.  Adding in a bus trans will require a bunch of fabrication.  You would be better off spending the money and getting a bug one built to handle the Subaru engine specs if you decide to not be gentle.
beetle,348yk8,winewagens,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"I would call rancho performance transaxle, they can build you a gearbox for just about anything. I have one of their ""Pro Street"" swingaxle boxes in my '66, with a 180HP 2175cc motor bolted to it."
beetle,348yk8,richcreations,-1,Wed Apr 29 22:27:34 2015 UTC,"I might get rid of the 2.5 in lieu of a 4g63 turbo engine. I want to clear, 250-280. Easy with this engine. Rancho is kinda on the expensive side. Not as bad as some of the boxes out there, but not cheap"
beetle,348yk8,richcreations,2,Wed Apr 29 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"not cheap, but you don't want cheap, you want a vw gearbox that can handle 250+HP, and that won't be cheap. Rancho is one of the best VW tranny builders out there when it comes to High HP VWs.  As others have said, the tranny is actually fairly tough, the diff will need upgraded (do you even need a diff in a baja, or will it be street driven?), a spool or super diff (super diff has 4 spider gears vs 2) should deal with that. You will want hardened keys, and perhaps a late super beetle input shaft.  Are you going with IRS, or Swing? Swing boxes are known to be stronger, and that is what came in your car, IRS handles better...  One thing to remember, that suby is likely to make it's power at higher rpm then a vw engine, so you will prob not have all that much more torque then my 180HP VW motor, and torque is what breaks things, not HP.   I autocross and drag my bug, and really tend to abuse my tranny, 50k miles later and no issues."
beetle,347uc6,Highlander-,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:09:19 2015 UTC,Yes but it is $400 plus oversized shipping  Finding a cutting from a donor car may be a better bet.  They used to be approximately $200 when I was in undergrad.  Then they weren't made for awhile and prices spike and never came back down.  A friend had a bunch of heater channel/floor rotten bugs but the luggage shelf was good.  He said he made a mint off them.
beetle,347uc6,winewagens,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:42:34 2015 UTC,Wolfsburg West has it for less than $400  still pretty expensive. I might have to get one from them if I cant find one locally (PA) and cheaper than $375
beetle,347lew,fwainwright,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh from my experience checking them out of the car without driving is mighty hard.  You can use a shift linkage T and vise grips on the nosecone shaft to move it between gears and then rotate the flanges on IRS to see if it will shift.  Probably try to rotate the axles on a swing in a similar manner, but if there aren't any, not a clue.  However you really won't hear the loud grinding issues you would when driving.  There is probably a samba link somewhere that could be useful."

Rented a dolly to tow it home, rear axle nut decides to loosen and break the cotter pin. right rear wheel falls off while on the dolly, does a fuck ton of damage, have the cop that stops call a rollback....

It was undetectable with the car sitting on the ground as the cotter pin was still in there. Local mechanical hit the fuck out of it with an impact until it wouldn't turn anymore.

beetle,33x10z,rot_in_peace,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:31:37 2015 UTC,put the pulley at TDC on #1 cylinder. loosen the clamp on the distributor and rotate it so the notch on the distributor body is centered on the rotor. if you're looking at the rotor from the top it should be pointing to about 4 or 5 o'clock at TDC on #1 (rear of car is 6 o'clock)
beetle,33x10z,beardedbast3rd,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"YouTube will be your friend, seeing it many times helps with what's already been said here, and sometimes you might catch things you may miss doing it too.  Plug 1 needs to come out of the block, turn the crank until your straw, or zip tei or whatever you use moves back into the engine, back it up a tad, mark it TDC, put the distributor in and put the wires in appropriately.   Also, if the rotor on the dizzy isn't right where the mark is, everything might be right where it should be, just advanced slightly, if you set your crank to it's TDC mark, the rotor should be slightly after the terminal for the closest plug wire, this would mean there is a level of advance on the distributor.  You didn't mention why you were adjusting timing, is there an issue you are trying to handle?"

beetle,33v0uc,fwainwright,2,Sat Apr 25 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"Are you running the stock 1500 and stock distributor? if so, you need to time it at TDC, not 5ATDC.  If you're running a rebuilt or otherwise modified engine, let us know what dizzy it is and what ignition setup you're running (points, electronic, or other)."

beetle,33v0uc,fatalifeaten,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"OK, so an 009 you time differently, because with most stock carbs they get an ugly flat spot just off idle.  Get your light all set up, then rev the piss out of the engine (over 3000 RPM). When you wind the sdvance curve out in the 009 (at high rpm it will stop advancing), set it to somewhere between 28 and 32 degreees BTDC. I like 30, but YMMV depending on your location (I'm in the desert in AZ). Let the idle timing fall wherever it lands after you time it at full advance. Usually it'll be in the 5-10 range. Try about 7 degrees to get the car started. It may idle like a plate full of wet pasta, but once you get the timing set it should settle down.

Rob and Dave's valve adjustment guide is handy - http://www.vw-resource.com/valveadj.html Valves must be checked dead-cold.    And you need to change the oil every 2-3k miles. The stock engines (except the later mexibeetles) don't have a proper oil filter, just that screen, so you really do need to change it that often.

I did my master cylinder a few months back and it made a world of difference. Bitch to bleed though since you have to bleed it on the car.
beetle,33ft25,BlueBeetle73,2,Wed Apr 22 05:13:20 2015 UTC,"THIS. Honestly what I did was install everything, fill it with fluid, fail at bleeding it, take it(using handbrake) to a close by brakeshop who bled it and adjusted everything professionally  I know this is a cop out but I just couldnt get all the air out and its brakes. Safety first."
beetle,33ft25,Bermwolf,2,Wed Apr 22 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, agree with BlueBeetle  Seems like with a lot of aircooled VW parts it's not so much the 'who' but the 'where.' Chinese-made parts are almost always iffy. Brazil / Mexico parts are usually at least workable. German / Europe parts are usually decent.    Check the standard suppliers (wolfsburgwest, aircooled.net, etc) and compare prices.    Also, please skim this - http://www.vw-resource.com/bench_bleed.html It's highly recommended you bench bleed the master cylinder before installing."

beetle,33auhz,knagl,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"That depends. Do you want a car that you only fill up with gas and get the oil changed? If yes then dont get a 40 year old car. Even if every single bolt, nut and rubber was replaced the day before you bough it, any classic beetle will require maintenance and most likely repairs. If you cant do these yourself they are going to get costly.  Having said that I love my beetle and accept that sometimes he is going to require some upkeep and sometimes no matter how much I do he is going to let me down."
beetle,33auhz,having_a_blast,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"Price varies by location and condition.  Photos are necessary to determine any scope of value.  What is $1000 in California with no rust could be $4000 on the east coast/rust belt due to road salt exacerbating rust.  What is $2000 in the midwest could be considered a parts car in Texas or New Mexico.  Supers aren't as coveted and as valued as pre 1967 bugs, though they are increasing somewhat.  1974 has a bunch of one year only parts.  Supers have a lot of bushings in the front end as compared to a standard.  When they are worn the car shakes at 40mph or so.  They can be a PITA to replace and $$ as well.    Do you have ANY mechanical aptitude or skills with tools?  Do you have metric tools?  Can you read internet forums like thesamba and technical books like the Bentley to work on the car since mechanics who actually can competently work on them are few and far between?  Do you have a contingency fund if something breaks like the brakes that are new due to a bad master cylinder?  Will this be your daily driver or secondary car?  New paint could be just lipstick on a pig.  Does it pass any sort of magnet test for filler?  Are the shock towers solid, frame head solid, heater channels solid?  If the first two aren't solid then it isn't worth the dime bag of stale weed left in the ashtray from the 80s.  Those are more of a pain to replace than heater channels, though those are also a costly endeavor if you don't have time/$$/experience to do it yourself."
beetle,33auhz,winewagens,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:43:15 2015 UTC,What's the cheapest area to buy one?
beetle,33auhz,mist91,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"New paint is actually a negative imho, pretty paint can mask a lot of defects.  And if it was a cheapie paint job with negligible prep effort it may not last very long. New carb is also a little iffy.  If it's a new Bocar, cool.  But nearly all the Chinese clones are... iffy.  's better to get a rebuilt original that matches your engine. New brakes and tires are a plus.    If I had to guess, your family is disagreeing because it's old and unsafe.  Which, you know, it is. No airbags, no abs, minimal crash protection, and it's rather light.    You didn't state the price or where you are, so letting you know if it's a good deal is a little hard.  Condition (especially rust!) and location will determine price. Supers, in general, aren't worth as much as a Standard -- and the older you go the more expensive the bug.  If you just want something to have fun with a '70's bug isn't a bad choice. The Supers have a McPherson front end, which can wear a bit and cause a 'shimmy' at certain speeds.  Google this problem and understand it, 's fixable but you'll want to be aware.  If the car shows signs use it to bargain down.    Just realize that these cars are old (this one is 41 years old!) and the maintenance requirements are sky high compared to your standard '90's+ Honda. You must check and adjust the valves regularly, it needs oil changes much more frequently, and stuff will just break from time to time.    If you're willing and able to work on it, have at it. I took mine on as a project and have enjoyed working on it."
beetle,3381z0,dantheman94,2,Mon Apr 20 11:37:34 2015 UTC,"It's the framehead and beam from a type 3.  Edit: not so sure about the framehead, finding differing photos on google."

beetle,3381z0,Devduino,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:20:07 2015 UTC,"They probably used that beam because of the shock mounts on the towers, ball joint beams had the vertical bolt style ones. Opens up better shock options (hence the nice [spax?] shocks.) Also type 3 drums have bigger slave cylinders I think so have better stopping power."
beetle,3381z0,_moist_,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"I would consider keeping it on there except for the fact that the chassis is rooted and if you look in the last photo you can see under the tie rod that the tunnel has been notched for the tie rod to go into when you turn hard right, which blocks the access hole so you can't get the shift rod out. I think it would be safer in this case to build it the way it was meant to be."
beetle,336to5,winewagens,2,Mon Apr 20 02:09:58 2015 UTC,Awesome tip. Did you happen to take any pics of said repair?
beetle,336to5,fatalifeaten,2,Mon Apr 20 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/jXGsRBy  It doesn't really get much simpler.  Run both free ends through the stop, then crimp it.  I just have the extended cable threaded through the hole in the car at the moment.  I probably should have bought ""music wire"" (that's what the old employee said it was called) from the wire department to have a closer diameter, but it was more expensive.  The smallest diameter braided metal cable was $0.49 per foot.  Next is shortening the cable and determining how to reattach the original handle.  For now I just wanted to be able to open the gas door without opening the trunk and pulling on the remnants of the cable."

beetle,334he5,winewagens,3,Sun Apr 19 14:59:10 2015 UTC,This. Any speaker on a '69 that isn't the single speaker up front firing through the dash is aftermarket be some PO.
beetle,334he5,fatalifeaten,2,Sun Apr 19 16:10:07 2015 UTC,I've never understood cutting the rear panels for speakers in these cars when you can put a lid over the trunk and get a poor man's speakerbox on the cheap. Cutting the front panels is often unavoidable for speakers but there's no reason to cut the rears.

beetle,332f12,fwainwright,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:39:35 2015 UTC,The transmission mounts and nosecones interchange between bug and T3 depending on the year ranges.  There are multiple styles of IRS and multiple axle lengths for swing.  That makes it a bit more complex.  Verify that the gearing is the same between both vehicles before buying a replacement by using thesamba to look up the code.  The fully automatic transmissions from the T3 WILL NOT fit in a beetle due to entirely different mounting systems.

beetle,32zkjs,Bermwolf,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:30:18 2015 UTC,I got too excited today when I was replacing my coil and spark plug wires. When I put the new distributor cap on the rotor was touching one of the points. As you can imagine this caused my little fire from the picture. And I feel like an amateur.  At this point replacing the point system is almost as expensive as a new distributor. I was going to do SVDA and the pertronix is only 121$(vs 74 for the new new ignitor)  Thoughts?

There's a few (some less than ideal) places to mount a temp sensor, here's a topic for you to skim - (link)  A voltmeter is generally a better choice over an ammeter, it'll tell you as much or more about your car's electrical system and you don't have to funnel the car's electrical load through the gauge (volt meter can sample anywhere, ammeter must be in line with the flow you're measuring).

beetle,32cd19,Minister_WGA,4,Sun Apr 12 16:18:01 2015 UTC,Best thing you can do is get a birth certificate from Germany.  It's only going to give you the build information though.
beetle,32cd19,veedubdan74,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:46:00 2015 UTC,X2  OP will have to do the track down the earliest owners from the more recent ones.  It can be very time consuming with dead ends or dead people.  I got lucky with my 67 bug.  The older couple who owned it in the 1980s were still alive and happy to speak with me on the phone.  I didn't delve too deeply but do keep in touch with them from time to time.
beetle,32cd19,winewagens,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"Most of this information about your car was probably kept on paper and then discarded after expiration instead of transferred to an electronic format. With no effective means to filter data, no one saw the value in hoarding it like they do today."
beetle,32cd19,piemat,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"Very old VINs (actually serial numbers in the days before VINs) often aren't distinct enough across all brands for modern online tracking. You may be able to find information in special VW sources, maybe even paper books, of series of serial numbers (factory, year, etc).   Additionally, old American cars would have build sheets, often pasted inside the glove box, that would have all the build codes to tell you how the car was originally equipped. Does VW do this?"
beetle,32cd19,Tripplite,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can actually get a ""birth certificate"" from VW."

beetle,32b4hi,97Bo-Red13,4,Sun Apr 12 05:48:13 2015 UTC,"If you ran it low / dry on oil, guaranteed you've fried some bearings. Usually a rod bearing welds itself to the crank first, though you can destroy main bearings as well. Only way to know is to tear the motor down to see how bad the damage is.   Before you consider a motor swap (to something not Type-1 Volkswagen based), you need to take a long hard look at what your budget and skillset is. If you ""don't know"" what an engine rebuild entails, then it's pretty safe to say you're not equipped with the mechanical knowledge needed to swap a motor. The old ""my buddy had a 911 motor in his beetle"" wive's-tale is told at every gas station, but rarely if ever done. Would require reworking all the sheet metal in the back of a bug, and it would never look remotely close to stock. Type-4 based Porsche motors are quite popular, but you need deep pockets as performace and replacement parts are far more expensive than Type-1 based builds.   A 1776cc based Type-1 or 2110cc Type-1 can be made to be quite reliable and streetable. I've got over 56,000miles on my 2110cc, and that includes rallying and racing. But to build it right, isn't ""cheap"". There's about $6k into the motor, and then on top of that there is additional oil and cooling work needed to make the motor last.  If you're not doing the work yourself, the labour costs go up significantly.   What's your budget for a new motor? Will you be using a shop to pull your old motor, build a new one and install the new one?"
beetle,32b4hi,CCA-Dave,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:16:16 2015 UTC,"Just to add my experience for some frame of reference. I rebuilt my motor on as much of a budget as I could (did all the work myself, reused what i could, etc.) and put about 3.5-4k into a new engine. I ended up building a 1904cc dual barrel motor. very street able power, and should last a while. the cheapest way to save your bug is to put another engine in, if you can find a running one."
beetle,32b4hi,WEINER_SCHLAP,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:52:16 2015 UTC,"OK, I probably should give a little more background. My experience with engine work is with American cars, mainly an old 327 in my dads Camaro. I'm not really oriented with this car yet. As far as books go my bibles are how to keep your Volkswagen alive, and a haynes manual. I can read those all day and probably put something together, but I'm not experienced with the 1600cc vw motor. It really is a whole new animal. As far as budget goes I'll get the money for my baby. and I can pull and dissemble the thing no problem. have more than a full garage and a lotta good guys to help. Can you explain a type 1 2110cc motor? I'll look it up also"
beetle,32b4hi,WEINER_SCHLAP,3,Sun Apr 12 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"A type 1 motor is stock for beetles.  a 1600 type 1 is actual something like 1584cc's but they call it a 1600. a 2110cc type has been bored and stroked, or in other words, the case has been machined, larger piston jugs (cylinders) have been fitted, and the stroke, or travel distance of the crankshaft, has been increased. It seem simple at first, but changing this geometry of your engine brings in a LOT of cost. a stock motor rebuild, not including labor, can reasonably be anywhere from 500 to 1500 dollars. when you change the geometry, you start needing: new heads to fit new cylinders. machined case to fit crank and cylinders. New carbs to keep up with the demand for fuel ($$$) external oil cooler to keep temps down (highly recommended, not req.) new valves, new valve springs, new pushrods. a new cam to make use of the new engines potential. and the list goes on but those are some of the main things.  Heads and carbs are the two most expensive parts of my build, and are pretty much vital to get any kind of performance from a custom engine. a 2110cc engine could reasonably put down 120-140 hp. my 1904cc engine puts out around 95. a stock 1600 type 1 is rated at 44 hp.   Mechanically, these engines are fairly simple. this book will tell you everything you need to know, step by step, to rebuild your engine entirely. also check the samba for build threads if you want to follow a guide for a particular motor. the 1904cc is not a super well documented build so if you have questions, feel free to ask me.  edit: I left out a lot of details, like cylinder bore and stroke dimensions and compression and all that, since there are so many. this must be researched for any individual build."
beetle,32b4hi,Blagger1,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:55:52 2015 UTC,For a quick fix find a running engine and swap it in and take your time with a rebuild imo double cheack that you do everything right and use quality parts
beetle,32b4hi,piemat,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:34:42 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the dark side. You will learn a lot along the way, sometimes the hard way. In comparison to your experience with other vehicles you will find these engines very simple and appreciate the engineering behind them. Parts are certainly not as cheap as they used to be, but much easier to find. It helps to have an aircooled VW mentor in your area that can teach you everything."
beetle,32b4hi,kuppajava,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"In reality, if all the worst things come to pass, you seized the moving pieces in the block and maybe a piston in the cylinder (or more than one, but any pistons seized in this way is unlikely), but you still have a transmission and carburetor, engine tins, oil cooler, heads, head covers, exhaust, intake headers, fuel system, etc.  Just changing out the engine block and cylinders with a rebuilt, same size and year block and cylinders is really easy for a car guy used to American cars.    If you have the money, interest, ability, location and time, you can pull out the engine and transmission and replace the block and cylinders while cleaning, restoring and rebuilding everything else in the drivetrain, making sure you have all of the rust fixed, fresh paint on the things that can rust (tins, head covers, block, some exhaust parts) and have a build that you can really be proud of!  This stuff is more fun than you can imagine for a car guy who has worked on old metal before.  Do this with a same size motor before you start beefing up the engine, just to be running and running right with everything fresh and rebuilt.  Once you do and you are confident, you can put in a damn Subaru motor (Youtube it, you will like what you see) if you want!  Once you are done with this same-size rebuild, you will completely understand your engine and you will be in the club, so I hope you don't have any other interests or things to spend your money on!"

beetle,3228b3,Ontopourmama,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"Using top quality parts is the first key. But other than that, I'll be running an intercooler to keep intake manifold temp at bay, and as for case heat, I'm using a deeper oil sump, full flow case, and a 20 pass oil cooler. Research is key.   Believe it or not, overheating isn't my biggest concern. Pre-ignition is the thing that haunts my dreams. Nothing will turn a boosted motor into scrap faster than pre-ignition."

beetle,322u0f,FlareVW,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, there'sp compound, and polishing wax. The compound basically scratches and moves the paint around to blend everything together, and the wax gives it a nice polish. I can't remember if that's right, but I have both parts in my garage somewhere from when I did it on my bug.  But definitely do some research. Search some YouTube videos of guys with bugs, or better yet, hit the samba!"

beetle,31yk35,n0exit,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"I just replaced the plugs with new NGK's. The old plugs were Bosch and 1 odd one. They were carbon black not wet. I leaned out the carb a bit.  The wires I havent changed because unless they have cracked I dont see how that could impact it.  The dizzy is a 009 with petronix electric fire. The cap looks fine, no scoring or black.  I am thinking of going to SVDA because I have never had good luck with the 009. Thoughts?"
beetle,31yk35,Bermwolf,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:44:58 2015 UTC,"I've heard that VW's generally like Bosch plugs? I have no idea if that's true. I always used Bosch in my VW, and NGK in my Honda motorcycles. Wires can still degrade without having visible degradation.  Everyone likes the SVDA now. In the 80s, everyone liked the 009. I honestly couldn't tell the difference when I swapped my 009 for an SVDA."
beetle,31yk35,n0exit,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:53:21 2015 UTC,I suppose that gives me reason to believe my 009 is usable and that something else is out of balance or wack.

I built it in the driveway of my duplex with a sawzall and a JC whitney catalog. I think I paid $1500 for the bug (way too much) and probably $500 in parts.  It got bashed by a hit and run, who cares. It got pieces ripped off of it, whatever. It had beer poured all over it, here, do another. Someone want's to cut ME off, LOL go for it you got a lot more to loose than me.

beetle,316yzt,winewagens,2,Thu Apr 2 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"One bad bump or jump, etc offroad and the strut could go through the body/break on you/etc.  The link pin (up to 65?) and balljoint beams (66+) of regular bugs don't have this sort of issue."
beetle,316yzt,jbrandt01,0,Thu Apr 2 16:42:39 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/uD-tgS6rmHs  I have NEVER seen any instances of a strut puncturing the tower.
beetle,316yzt,winewagens,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:05:38 2015 UTC,Those are some of the reasons I have seen on thesamba.  If the shocktower is rusty bad things could happen offroad.  Maybe not the strut through the tower if it's solid (the only thing you focused on when I also mentioned parts breaking).  I miss reading HBB's new posts (RIP.)  http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=200928  http://sandlizrd.baja.org/superbad.htm
beetle,316yzt,jbrandt01,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"The only failure you specified was the strut coming through the tower.  Ball joints can break on anything, in fact its common enough that most people switch to thing spindles.    If you're building a beam for any abuse you need to gusset the shock mounts, cut and turn (or add adjusters that will inevitably fail), gusset the spindles and add limiters.  This is a fair bit of work.  I'll agree that a standard CAN be stronger than a super if retaining stock style suspension but 1:1 bone stock they're equally as adept."
beetle,316yzt,fatalifeaten,2,Thu Apr 2 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"Supers are strut front ends and because of the way they're constructed, your options are more limited in terms of how much you can modify the suspension in order to make it more durable or provide more lift. In a torsion beam car, you can install a widened beam, you can install longer trailing arms, and you can just re-index the torsions to push the suspension up and raise the car. You can't do any of these things with struts. The top mount of a strut on a SB is through the top of the fender well, so even if you alter the remainng suspension components, you're still forced to triangulate back to that point unless you build a tube chassis (and then you're not really running a super any more). Is it doable? yes. Is it going to cost a lot more than a torsion beam pan? yup. I've seen discussions about how struts break more easily in offroad use, but honestly, if you're running a strut designed for a street car offroad, you probably are doing it wrong.  Best setup for a baja is to get a king and linkpin frame head, and weld it to an IRS pan. K/L beams are more durable than balljoint beams (balljoints fail and break all the damn time offroad), and you can buy all the parts needed to do this conversion on the aftermarket. A weekend with a swazall and a welder, and you're rolling on a very good base for baja action. From there, the rest is up to your imagination and wallet."

beetle,316am8,fatalifeaten,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:17:17 2015 UTC,"Internally, yes, those H blocks would have been the same from the factory, (up to the longblock) and only the serial number would tell you whether it was originally for a bug or a bus. The air cleaners were different because the typical oil bath used in the bug wouldn't fit the bus engine bay so they had it sit off the the side by the generator) and maybe the carbs were different. My type 2 king fu isn't as good as my type 1, so not 100% sure of all the differences. Use that page from the samba I linked to see where the full case serial number lines up. That'll tell you whether it originally was in a bug or a bus.  Keep in mind that it is likely that they've been rebuilt over the years and are no longer what they started out as from the factory. 1300/1500/1600 cases are all commonly rebuilt into something they weren't originally. When I bought my '67, the original H case was in the car, but it had been rebuilt to a 1641 (and was locked up) It had already seen 2 rebuilds and couldn't be cut again, so it got tossed.

beetle,30dcdc,DrCockenstein,2,Thu Mar 26 18:18:50 2015 UTC,You should be able to push on it and get about a half inch of movement before it fights back. Going too tight is going to trash the bearings in your alternator and possibly loosen the strap that holds it to the engine. If it has the play it should then run it for a bit and see what happens. It could just be squeaky because it's new.
beetle,30dcdc,Fweaka,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:50:04 2015 UTC,Same thing here (alternator though). Just replaced the belt a little while ago. It has about 1/2 an inch of play but it still squeaks. I think it's just because it's a new belt.

beetle,2zn73p,soapandsoup,2,Fri Mar 20 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"So I did a drunk purchase on eBay, thinking I was buying these. Turns out, I wasn't. I bought dual port not single, and since their carbs, seller wouldn't take them back. Now I got dual port carbs with no dual port engine, and a single port engine without dual carbs. Oh how sober me hates drunk me sometimes."

beetle,2zn73p,DrCockenstein,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:21:16 2015 UTC,I agree the Weber's may be better. But I tried ITC carbs and had very poor luck. You may have better luck with dual 36 drla dellorto.
beetle,2zn73p,fatalifeaten,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:33:48 2015 UTC,You need to get one of those carb checkers with the balls in it if you don't have one before you do this. You'll need to use it in order to get the flow right on the carb. Also as InfiniteWut said you might have troubling getting this kit to idle. Two dual barrels with one barrel feeding into each pot will give better idle and power but is much harder to set up. Good luck and have fun jetting!
beetle,2zn73p,alexanderjoiner,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"Dual ICT single port setups are a nice modest little kick in the ""go"" department. Dialing them in isn't all that hard honestly. They should be jetted for a small displacement engine right out of the box (assuming  stock SP heads and a mild cam) and only need minor adjustments to sync. I actually like a snail gauge meter for these, like this http://vwparts.aircooled.net/Snail-Type-Syncrometer-Carb-Sync-Tool-GERMAN-SK-p/ste-sk.htm  You can usually find them for less money, but that's a great synchrometer for single and dual throat carbs.   Dual singles without a balance tube are going to idle on #4 and #2. It's just that way the firing order works out. If you have a balance tube between them, you can scavenge some fuel for #1 and #3 and even the pulse out. Set your idle with a balance tube a bit higher, and then you're probably good to go."

beetle,2zjgcs,Bermwolf,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"They are actually dellorto 36drla. And it runs very nice. The reason for the change in oil filler was because he liked how it looks, and it doesn't interfere with the carb linkage."

beetle,2zeikd,comfortador,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:45:01 2015 UTC,Never kick the windows. Either do it the hard way and lube under the inside lip then slowly work around it with a putty knife until you (hopefully) get the window out or simply cut the old molding from the inside then push away gently. It should pop right out once you cut the molding.

beetle,2zfh8f,Fweaka,2,Wed Mar 18 06:51:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, many websites you can look up to see how to do it exactly. You'll need a timing light. Also get the idiots book by John Muir. It's great help."

beetle,2zfh8f,Cookaacoo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"Well, static timing is that simple. If you have a 009 (no vacuum advance) you might can get away with that.    If your distributor has vacuum advance you should use that method to get the car running, then fine tune (at ~3500rpm) with a timing light.  And really, 009 or not it's good to verify with a timing light that your engine is at ~30 degrees advance at 3000+ rpm, as that's where you're gonna be running."
beetle,2zfh8f,Cookaacoo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:12:59 2015 UTC,a FI bug will not run well at all unless it has the stock DVDA distributor.  It times at idle to 5* ATDC at idle.
beetle,2zfh8f,Fweaka,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"Gave it a go using the method in the video. Even set it to 5 atdc, but its still backfiring. Forgot to mention the backfiring is when I'm decelerating or take my foot off the peddle to coast down speed."
beetle,2zfh8f,Cookaacoo,1 point,Thu Mar 19 08:52:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a vacuum leak somewhere then!  Send me a photo of your engine bay.  Can you confirm that the vac can is still good on the distributor?  Check both ports on the vac can, make sure they are still good and hold vacuum (no leaks)  I have a feeling the retard port on the vac can is bad."

You're not likely to get much response for a '72 Super like that at that price, and tbh I'm not sure I'd list your age in the ad.    I'd also trim down the ad.  It's wordy. You really just want two lists, things done to the car and the things the car needs yet to be able to run.    Good luck with it. If it doesn't need a whole lot (just a voltage reg?) you'll get significantly more money for a running and driving car.  Oh, and post to theSamba classifies as well."

The other option would be re-skinning your current door, which would be a TON of work. If you had an oval or a split, it might be worth it, but a 1969 should be common enough to just grab a new door."

beetle,2z61pk,soblime,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:08:32 2015 UTC,"Good on ya for marking the parts with masking tape. Make sure the nuts and bolts are organized similarly. Even if you are replacing with new hardware, you'll know the pitch, size and length. Some nuts are special, like the exhaust nuts.   How were your threads from the head studs coming from the case? I've seen the case need case savers since torquing is impossible of they are stripped which eventually leads to leaks and loss of pressure."

beetle,2z6xew,curtquarquesso,2,Mon Mar 16 02:43:00 2015 UTC,"Had my heart in my throat earlier today in the car on my three-hour trip back up to school after break when I heard all hell break loose in the back; thought I'd sucked a valve or thrown a rod. Much to my relief, it was just the tire. Didn't have much trouble maintaining control and getting her off the road.   The big disappointment here is that the treads coming off dented and chipped my rear fender. I think I may have comprehensive coverage for this, though I don't know what good it'd do. I don't believe it's nearly severe enough to warrant major work.   Anyways, I was really close to an exit, so I did the tire change in the safety of a gas station. I've heard horror stories of people getting taken out on the side of the road in freak-accidents, one incident with a Beetle specifically, so I'm glad I was able to pull off somewhere safe.   Be extra safe out there, and make sure that Bilstein jack works!"
beetle,2z6xew,windetch,2,Mon Mar 16 02:52:05 2015 UTC,"eesh. Were the tires just old?  Looks like they had a fair amount of tread-depth left, before the tread made a run for it."
beetle,2z6xew,CCA-Dave,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure. It's Florida, so we get dry-rot here, haven't changed them since I bought the car. They had hardly any wear on them, but they may have been older.  I did top off the air in the tires about a week ago. Did about 34 psi all around. I have a feeling that was a factor."
beetle,2z6xew,personalityprofile,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:19:12 2015 UTC,"Correct tire pressure for your car is 16psi front, 24psi rear when running bias ply tires. Increase to 18-20psi front, 26-28pis rear when running radials.   All four tires, as well as the spare, should be replaced on your car. Those tires are very old, and very unsafe."

A semi related story: make sure you have fresh axle nuts as well. a wheel/tire/drum coming off will also mess up your fender... Had one actually strip out. sheared the safety pin, and wheel was rolling down the street after it destroyed the fender."

beetle,2z2ape,hnmc,4,Sat Mar 14 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"For future readers, here are the beetle pics OP posted: http://imgur.com/a/rvWpM  Taking a look at the photo of your engine, your car does not have heater boxes installed, so there are a couple of changes to the tin that you require. Using the following diagram: http://www.vw-resource.com/images/engine_tin_numbered.jpg you need the following: #30 for sure, probably #6,10,9. You will need to confirm if you have #23, 20 & 17 as they are not visible (in front of the engine, towards the front bumper). For the #30 piece of rear tin, because your engine is not running heater boxes or a factory air cleaner, you can simply buy this http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ACC-C10-6217 piece of tin. It's aftermarket, but actually fits pretty well. Don't worry about buying a factory part for #30, as it has three large holes which you will need to worry about plugging. The unit I have linked is a much better choice. When you go and install heat down the road, simply find a factory VW part for the rear tin.  To replace your engine seal, you will need to drop the motor out of the car. I highly recommend you buy the orange bentley, and have some knowledge of beetles / mechanics before you start. If not, contact a VW club in your area and get someone to help you on the first time. It's super easy, but if you don't know the 'tricks', you can damage things.   For the parts compatibility question, it's not an easy answer for a '72 Super Beetle, as there are lots of mixes on that particular year. In general you can trust the following information. Listed as ""Part on your car - compatible year parts"":  Front suspension, hood, front fenders = 71 & 72 superbeetle only.  Brakes, all corners = 1969+ all beetles (north america)  Rear suspension = 1969+ all beetles (north america)  Body work from door hinges back = '69-72 all beetles  Rear taillights = Technically '72 one-year only part. '71 units work if you glue the 72-only reflector on the side. (north america)  Engine / Transmission = 1969-1974 (with varied changes on the engine if you're doing a stock restoration). Generally any 1600dp compatible parts apply with your vehicle.  Interior = 1969+ beetle, with the following exceptions: Headliner, vents inside beside rear window ('72 one-year only), dashboard ('72 one-year only), dash switches ('72 configuration of particular switches is one year only, each individual switch is actually available across many years), front seats (70-72 have unique headrest shape).

beetle,2z27gy,Highlander-,3,Sat Mar 14 21:53:52 2015 UTC,"Use a pair of pliers to gently crimp the loose terminal connectors, you don't really want loose wires behind your dash.    The sender is a rheostat, outputs a variable resistance depending how high the float is.  I'm not sure what it should be reading (can check mine tomorrow if you want), but if you pull it and the resistance varies evenly as you move the float arm 's probably alright.    I'd suspect the vibrator before the gauge itself, but the gauge can go bad (I accidentally killed one messing around with it)."
beetle,2z27gy,windetch,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"So you think the arm maybe stuck? I tried to snug up one connector during my ""testing"" but to no a vale."
beetle,2z27gy,windetch,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:07:17 2015 UTC,"Somewhat unlikely, the float is relatively heavy. And the arm being stuck would give a reading, but just one reading (so it might read 3/4 tank all the time).   There's an electrical rheostat in the sender that gives a resistance value based on the position of the float, these can burn out.    Went out and checked, I've got an almost full tank and my sender is showing 5.8 ohms."

beetle,2z08tq,Onomacritus,2,Sat Mar 14 09:56:44 2015 UTC,The adjusters sound frozen and should be checked when replacing shoes so you don't have this issue. The best way is to take it all apart and use PB Blaster or heat on them to loosen them to rotate freely. If you use  a hammer and  punch through the access hole to make them rotate you run the risk of breaking or stripping the teeth. Clean them and use a TINY dab of never seize on the post end if you wish (not the gear end.)
beetle,2z08tq,winewagens,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:40:16 2015 UTC,"+1 winewagens, did you check the adjustment stars for free movement before reassembling?  Never-seize is indeed helpful.  Drum is going to be a bear to remove if the pad is seized against it, maybe tap the outside of the drum with a hammer to see if it'll free itself. Before you re-installed the drum you had to adjust the stars for the new pads, how stiff were they?  After it was put back together did you go back and adjust the stars one more time? Both springs and pad retainers are installed right?  Should look like (this) all together, wondering if something isn't installed right for a pad to get stuck that bad right after installation.    Another note, those rear axle nuts must be torqued to at least 217 ft-lbs or you'll strip the splines.  I've been using (this) method (15""/12"" = 1.25ft x 190lbs = 237 ft lbs), but a better idea for the future is to get a torque meister or similar (link)."

beetle,2ykwwk,winewagens,2,Tue Mar 10 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"^ That.    Looks like you're running an electric pump anyways, there's no real reason to have the filter in the engine compartment (other than convenience).  Put it in front of the pump, which will get chewed up from any tank rust. Also, get a proper Wix (NAPA Gold) or metal fuel filter, that one looks like the one they have in the lawnmower section.    Generator is also 90 degrees off, need to unbolt it and rotate it so the terminals are on the right side (pic).  This is generator cooling related.

These metal pieces direct air where it needs to go and keeps the hot air below the car separate from the cooler air the fan sucks in.  If you look into an aircooled VW's engine bay and see the ground it doesn't have all it's tin.  Here's a pic - (engine out, seal)  Bajas get around this by having the engine completely exposed, but a standard bug needs it's tin or it risks overheating."

The intake fan is actually mounted on the other side of the generator, and there's a large intake hole there on the other side of the shroud (the big red cover).

We haven’t had the opportunity to do this for the past few years, but now we think it’s time to get it started again. Each year, before Christmas, we donate diecast cars to the U.S. Marine Corp Toys For Tots Foundation. The last year we collected for the die cast drive, we donated over 4800 die cast cars and even a few Barbie Dolls. Each year we sponsored the drive, it was very successful, even landing us a spot on the local evening news. We’ve had collectors from as far away as Germany and Australia donate to the cause and we’re hoping that this year will be just as successful. We accept die cast cars in all shapes and forms, any manufacturer, etc. We only ask that they remain in their original packaging, no loose cars. If you’re interested in donating, please visit our web site for more information. We’d love to add your name to the growing list of people who have donated over the years.

How to do it is in the Rob and Dave link in the sidebar  36mm socket  flywheel locking tool or homemade tool  torque wrench  tool to set and measure endplay  new rear main seal  new flywheel o-ring seal  shims to set proper endplay 0.006 is usually deemed too much  Edit:  Can you also maybe try to have a title that isn't a single generic word that is the name of a part?  Some of your posts have titles that are somewhat descriptive, but the majority of them are not."
beetle,2xag51,winewagens,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:38:43 2015 UTC,"Well I'm getting a pretty big shake when I start out in first. John Muir says it's a distorted flywheel. I believe it is, because I also get a grind on startup pretty often. Ok, I have the tools on the list, but, what tool should I use to measure end play? Feeler gauges? I'll order the parts today. Thank you.  Sorry about the title. I hate coming up with titles. So I usually choose something easy. Didn't think it was a big deal. Thanks :)"
beetle,2xag51,windetch,2,Fri Feb 27 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Eh.  Could you describe the problem a little more?  There's a bunch of things that can cause engine vibration, most of them easier to cure (and more likely) than a warped flywheel. Something as simple as needing a tune up and valve adjustment, maybe a vacuum leak, or the transmission mounts could be shot.   With the flywheel replacement:  Can use feeler gauges with something like this - (link)  Proper tool is a dial gauge, a magnetic base helps here.   Also consider a torque-meister (link) or similar if you don't have one.  The last thing you want is that flywheel coming loose, and the only thing that holds it is the gland nut.    also, the grind on startup is likely the starter."
beetle,2xag51,winewagens,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:10:53 2015 UTC,Agreed!  Plus at times using the Muir book as the sole diagnosis of the issue can lead down the wrong path.
beetle,2xag51,windetch,1 point,Fri Feb 27 23:01:29 2015 UTC,"I just replaced the starter. The grind isn't all the time but when the flywheel stops at a certain spot. The flywheel could be damaged from the old starter (Jesus, what a mess that was!). The transaxle mounts look to be in good shape. Maybe the previous owner put New ones in before I got it. But John Muir says that the problem mostly happens on take off (mostly in first). That's exactly what's happening for me. If you have the book it's on page 207, near the bottom of the page."
beetle,2xag51,Sqwill,1 point,Sat Feb 28 04:47:07 2015 UTC,"A rough idle with excessive engine vibration could be a bunch of other things... But hey, a new stock flywheel isn't horrifically expensive and you'll get a chance to check and set the endplay.    Once you drop the engine it'll be readily apparent if the flywheel is missing teeth.    Two more things you might want for the flywheel swap - A seal installer (link)  (can use a piece of wood as in Rob and Dave's article, but this makes it easier) And if you're not replacing the clutch atm, an alignment tool - (link)  (a Sachs clutch kit should come with one)"

beetle,2x83cg,winewagens,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:49:59 2015 UTC,Yes it needs the regulator.  The photo you posted before shows the plug style alternator hookup (externally regulated 1973.5  and 1974).   It is NOT the same regulator as the one for a generator.   If you want to replace the alternator with a higher amp one for your radio buy the internally regulated one and do some wire splicing.
beetle,2x83cg,Charlie802,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:43:07 2015 UTC,1200? Maybe 1600? If it is a '77 engine I would assume it to be an alternator http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/1977bug/1977_VW_Beetle_Owners_Manual.pdf

So what you do is you open your engine bay and poke a stick into the foam. Keep poking until you break apart the foam then you can use a metal brush of some kind to clean it completely. Maybe something that you would use to clean your chimney made from brass. That will clean it out, it will also make a huge mess in your engine bay and if you do not clean every bit of it, it might smell funny, because foam melted onto your hot engine.

beetle,2x21c8,Highlander-,3,Wed Feb 25 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"I would probably jack the car up and start off seeing about any noise while spinning the tires that would possibly indicate a bad bearing or something off in the brakes. A fter that, check for play in the tire indicating a bad ball joint. Once the car is back on the ground, have someone move the steering wheel back and forth while you watch for play in the tie rod ends. This way may not be perfect but it will give you some idea of any gross abnormalities.  I would almost lean towards a bad wheel bearing that you can only hear while slowing down since the noise of a motor may drown it out while accelerating."

You'd need the little scoop that goes below the tin, a stock oil bath aircleaner, and some kind of working thermostat.  Some oil baths came with their own little thermostat built in, most relied on the cooling flaps thermostat.  Probably want to just fill the hole, easiest is to cut a small piece of sheet metal to size and screw it in.   Side note, that fuel filter would be better placed outside the engine compartment.  Under the gas tank or where the hard line exits the tunnel are two alts. If nothing else, safety wire your brass connections (pic).  Those fittings can pull out, and the extra weight of the fuel filter isn't doing you any favors.    Congrats on your new bug btw, looks like you got her home safe."

Kind of a weird looking pair of pliers that grasps the wire and twists -- used more on airplanes and motorcycles, though VW did safetywire the transmission coupling.

beetle,2wdpow,richcreations,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:37:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit leery of condemning the starter straight off. Reason being it's really strange you turn the key and absolutely nothing happens, no click, no clunk, no lights dimming. Yet you burnt a screw driver trying to short the solenoid so the starter motor has enough amperage supply to melt a screw driver. I'm thinking your solenoid is either burnt up, the trigger voltage isn't there, or the loosey goosey spade terminal is loosier than normal.  First I'd make absolutely sure the solenoid is getting voltage from the key in the start position. Hook up your test light to the appropriate terminal and have someone turn the key for you. If you've got really long leads for it you could do it yourself. IIRC the supers used the same ignition switch guts as the bus, and i've had nothing but yearly switch failures in my 76. YMMV on that end.  Regardless, test for trigger voltage to the solenoid with a test light. If that's good, then use a jumper wire from the always hot terminal to the spade connecter with the red and black wire hooked on. It should snap closed if the solenoid windings are good. Next use a pair of needle nose pliers you dont care for or a big fat jumper wire and short the two big terminals together.   If shorting the two large terminals together (and you're sure you're not just grounding the end of the screwdriver, its pretty tight in there) results in tons of sparks and heat you've developed a shorted armature in the starter (not sure how that's possible, never seen it before myself) more likely the armature is siezed up and not able to turn anymore. If you short the two large terminals and nothing happens you've got an open in the armature in the starter and it's an indication your starter is cooked or on the way out (you might get a start of of it bashing the starter with a hammer or a rock and retrying the key). If you short the large terminal to the red and black terminal and nothing happens you've got a burnt up solenoid. Which is replaceable and far cheaper than a new starter.   Good replacement acvw starters are actually pretty expensive, and they don't fail that often. The solenoid is quite easy to replace, but the starter motor itself isn't serviceable, by the public anyway."

beetle,2w9vua,popmarazzi,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:45:20 2015 UTC,As for the sway bar it does help handling but only if you have done some modifications to the front end. I have a strut tower brace up front and a bigger the stock sway bar. I also have disk brakes on all four corners and sport springs up front. I would not recommend a rear sway bar unless you have done a bigger sway bar up front.   Adjusting the valves with the oil lines has never been a problem. And with the new muffler it is a little cramped but doable. I am not going to take the muffler off to do the valves as it was a pain to put on.
beetle,2wa8ru,InfiniteWut,6,Wed Feb 18 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"Adding boost to an aircooled VW engine gets expensive fast, a stock motor is not going to take it...

I am getting 180HP out of my motor, naturally aspirated, and most of the mods I did, would need done anyway (forged stroker crank, h-beam rods, forged pistons, cam, ported heads with bigger valves, etc.) plus the price of the turbo/supercharger.

First and foremost, you aren't doing it with carbs, you need EFI with wideband O2 correction.  You also need computerized ignition, you need to constant tweak advance as the needs aren't perfectly linear with engine RPM.  I run methanol/water injection as well to keep detonation further at bay.  Truthfully though, the engine can hold up to some abuse, its the rest of the driveline that usually grenades.

beetle,2wa8ru,richcreations,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:17:02 2015 UTC,I know a guy who builds bullet proof transmission for a price. So I am not concerned about that. I understand that I need to build an incredibly strong high rev low compression motor. And I am willing to find the right supercharger.  I want this to be a fast street engine as well as an engine that I can take to the track and auto cross.  Are there any inherent problems with superchargers. Other then they rob Peter to pay Paul.
beetle,2wa8ru,jbrandt01,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"I think they add additional loading to the crank snout where the bearings aren't really made to take it.  Aside from robbing Peter to pay Paul, Robin is also dropping half of it along the way.  They're inefficient.  Thats my main gripe.  The blower is also going to end up in the engine compartment and add that much more complexity and subsequently heat.  If you're favoring a blower because of some preconceived notion of better response, I'd dismiss it.  You can get a ridiculous assortment of hot side housings to spool up extremely quick.  I was running a .46 hot side that started getting attitude at 2600.  I'm now switching to a Borgwarner BV50 which is variable geometry and should come on and stay on until everything else runs out of headroom."
beetle,2wa8ru,jbrandt01,2,Wed Feb 18 15:22:45 2015 UTC,Step 1. Budget 50% more than you think it will cost. Step 2. Double that.  Superchargers have been done but by and large turbo is the way to go.  I question the long term effect of loading at the crank snout and the moment imposed by a larger pulley.  I also prefer turbos as they are more efficient and easier to implement.  The main steps for a reliable turbo engine basically consist of building a bulletproof NA engine with slightly lower compression (or very complex chamber work and precise fueling).

So, if you want to put in the time and research to fit a supercharger on a beetle engine, please do so. And keep me updated because I would be very interested in a project like this."
beetle,2wa8ru,funkmachine7,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:40:21 2015 UTC,"In addition to what's been mentioned, availability of a charger that will adapt to an ACVW engine may be an issue. I've seen some older roots-style blowers designed for VW engines from the late 50's, 60's and 70's, but I don't think they're manufactured anymore. (Landy kits on ebay are running 5 grand plus.) You may find a centrifugal unit that would work for an ACVW engine but you probably have to custom fab all the mounts and figure some way to splice the brain in (and again, likely need EFI with a modern compressor charger too)."

These aircooled VW engines are slightly different beasts, I'd be concerned about that goop getting stuck somewhere it shouldn't -- say, the oil cooler bypass. That, and unlike the vast majority of cars the engine can be dropped almost trivially.  It's better to just do it right, imho."

beetle,2vmfd5,gh0stmach1ne,2,Thu Feb 12 05:16:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you're at and what kind of shape it's in. A good stroker turnkey can run a couple grand and up depending on what's inside of it. Unfortunately bajas are not worth as much as uncut sedans, and you will probably never see all the money you've put into it. Based solely on what you've said about the motor and this one photo, I'd say you could ask at least 3 grand for it and expect it unless it's rotten underneath that paint.  Now, if you've got decent documentation on the car showing what work was done and when / by whom, and it's in good shape, that number could go to as high as maybe 7k to the right buyer. These are guesses because I've got so little info about the car, so take them with a HUGE grain of salt. I know Barret Jackson sends busses and really nice sedans across the blocks for huge and stupid numbers, but the simple truth is that those are exceptional cars, and the massive majority of VW's are never going to be worth that much."

Grab or mallet or hammer with an insulated handle. Tap the starter a bunch of times, and crank it again. Also check to make sure the battery is getting charged enough.   Also push/roll it a bit, and pop it into gear. Might budge the starter enough to let it work again. If you push-start it, that means everything else is ok, and it's likely the starter."
beetle,2vhawm,windetch,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"There's two main parts to your ignition system, the key switch and the solenoid mounted on the starter. Probably one of those, though you can crawl under the car and look for loose connections on the starter as others have recommended -- it should have a large gauge wire (power) and a small wire (signal) on it (it grounds through the chassis).    Would then start where rich pointed you, the wire under the rear seat that goes out to the starter solenoid (pic). If that has no power when you turn the key your ignition switch is broke.  Replace it. If it's still sending a little power but not enough to engage the solenoid you might get by with a hard start relay (link).  If that wire looks alright and you're now questioning the starter you can test the solenoid fairly easily.  Car in neutral and e-brake on please. Disconnect the starter wire under the seat, then tap the lead that exits the car on the positive battery terminal (use a short piece of wire to extend it).  Starter should engage."
beetle,2vhawm,richcreations,2,Wed Feb 11 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I would start with the key switch, make sure it is putting out  12V at the small wire connected to the starter when you turn the key. if you have 12V there, it is prob the starter, otherwise it is the switch or wiring.  Another test is to turn on the headlights, and try to start the car, if they dim, without the engine cranking, you could have a bad battery, loose connection, or burnt starter."
beetle,2vhawm,Eblumen,2,Wed Feb 11 01:11:16 2015 UTC,Do you hear any kind of click sound when you try to start? It sounds like your starter may have decided to die. You can try whacking it with a wrench and see if that gets it to work temporarily.

Previous owner apparently had a bad voltage regulator, and rather than replace it for 25 bucks, he bypassed it. After blowing fuses, he replaced them with higher amp fuses and melted the harness. He mixed up a bunch of wires at the fuse box as well. After 10 hours and a friend who loves doing wiring, everything works as it should. Well, almost everything.   TL;DR - Replace your voltage regulator instead of bypassing it."

beetle,2v8ijn,Cookaacoo,2,Mon Feb 9 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"If you are running a external regulator, with a internally regulated alternator, you are going to have all kinds of problems.  Depending on your new wire harness, You will need to bypass the spot in the harness where the external regulator would be (solder/splice some wires)  Or, switch to a later wire harness (the main loom) that supports the internally regulated alternator. Call the supplier, they can hook you up. I prefer Wiring works harnesses.  What year is your bug?"

beetle,2v5cva,Firechicken90,3,Sun Feb 8 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"/u/winewagens has commented on this exact thing when I had this problem with my 73 Super  Honestly what I did was * Drain tank from underside * Remove all hoses * Remove gas tank and clean internal rust with ""The works"" toilet cleaner * Use loop of clear hose and zip ties to close off the 2 holes on the driver side * Purchase new filler neck tube * Purchase thisvented gas cap.  And now no smell! I just periodically open the vented cap when I drive to equalize pressure. Even over 300 mile trips, no problems."
beetle,2v5cva,Bermwolf,2,Sun Feb 8 03:53:40 2015 UTC,On my 73 there was an outlet for small hose on the filler neck and an outlet for small hose on the tank. I connected the two with a piece of fuel line then used a vented cap. This allowed me to remove that yellow strip and the charcoal canister (both were actually missing when I bought the car) and just run a fuel line right from the tank to the carb. Since there's no return line this worked well.  Turns out that hose that goes from the small hole on the tank runs to the charcoal canister then vents to fresh air and that small connector on the filler tube. So really as long as the cap allows for venting the pressure should stay normal and the fuel pump will pump like it's supposed to. Worst case is you could run hoses from the small connectors on the filler tube and tank to little air filters under the fenders. All those lines do is give the tank vents.
beetle,2v5cva,DrCockenstein,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:13:45 2015 UTC,When I found your post and went to link to it I didn't see how you resolved the problem.  Good to see it's fixed.

Its the cheapest at walmart ($14 if i recall) its $25+ at auto part stores.  Also, the rebuild kit you will want is a WALKER KIT #15282C  It has the best gaskets (thick) and a good needle valve.  Oreilys has these."
beetle,2uw4ga,Fenks,2,Thu Feb 5 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"To add to this, break the carb down and get all the jets, valves, gaskets, floats, etc off of it. remove as much nonmetal as you can, Chem dip is a solvent. Dunk your carb in the bucket and seal it overnight. Scrub it with a wire brush the next day and rinse well with water. That should get any gunk and debris out of the small passages within the carb body. Blow them out with compressed air as well if you can to make sure you get all the water out.  Re-assemble being careful to not cross thread the jets. I like to put some fuel in the bowl before I close it up so it takes less time to prime once you have it back on the car. The usual ""be careful and don't light yourself on fire"" warnings apply here. You're going to have to re-tune it once you get it on the car, with a 34PICT-3 it's not too difficult.  You can forego the overnight bath if you are time constrained. Get soe B-12 chemtool (all auto parts stores carry this) and spray the hell out of the carb with it. Won't get it as clean, but it'll help.  Not including soak time, this is a less than 2 hour job, even the first time."

beetle,2uubmg,angierhafai,2,Thu Feb 5 15:54:09 2015 UTC,I love how it all fits together. Nice and tucked up in there but still looks like replacement is fairly easy.  Unfortunately due to the exhaust on mine had to go with a pump like this. The oil lines wrap up under the frame and into the driver side fender well where the oil filter sits. A bracket keeps the lines from shifting around too much and they tuck up nicely. A bonus of having the filter there is replacement is nice and easy.

beetle,2ug2bs,northin,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"You may want to check your compression, on the note of a lack of acceleration and power. I had an engine built that sat about a year before I was able to install it, and it ran like crap. It turned out to be a few different things combined. The major cause was  very low compression from seized rings. The carbs were also out of tune (Kadrons, and admittedly I'm bad with carbs, and had removed/reinstalled them to mount the engine), do you know the last time those were fooled with?  As far as shifting goes, you're probably better off listening to someone else. I know my gear changes are a bit stiff from my shift rod not being perfectly aligned. It's a bit of a special case, though, because it's been shortened. Maybe a problem with the throwout bearing arms?"
beetle,2ug2bs,5hameless,1 point,Mon Feb 2 00:57:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm. They could be related. If you are having transmission issues it could definitely impact your top speed. Did your dad inspect and replace the clutch and pressure plate when he rebuilt the engine?  Does it sound like it's missing or running rough? Have you done a simple tune-up on it since it was rebuilt?  Have you checked the level of the gear oil in the actual transmission? If it's getting overheated due to being low on gear oil and the metal is expanding, it might explain some of the difficulty with gear changes (and the fact that if you let it sit it goes away sort of supports this idea as well).  Also, how badly out of adjustment were the tappets (We call them rockers in the states, but same thing). If they were badly off, it would absolutely run like garbage. If they were off for a while, you could have damaged the lifters or cam, causing loss of power. If you change the oil and find metal particulate in it, that's bad.  Try the easy stuff first. Do a full tune-up and check the level of the gear oil in the transmission, Double check the clutch cable, and if those don't help, may be time to pull take it to a shop or pull the motor and start digging."

If the radio is turning on and acting normally, just with no sound, that suggests it's getting power but not sending any signal to the speakers.    Can try pulling a speaker out and directly connecting it to the back of the radio with a short length of wire.  If that fails the unit's internal amp may be toast.  Kinda doubt it's an issue, but may want to use a multimeter and see how much voltage the new engine's generator / alternator is putting out.  Voltage regulator may not be doing it's job."

beetle,2tnhoz,Ghosthunter858,7,Sun Jan 25 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"Being small, and designed to be very easy to maintain and repair, it's an ideal first restoration project. The fact that it's aircooled also means you have less extra systems to mess about with (water cooling system and air conditioning, for example), which just sweetens the pot.  I'm biased, because my first real car and project was a ruby '67 with a black interior. When I bought it, I had never worked on anything more mechanically challenging than a bicycle. I was basically a rolling shell with a couple families of packrats living inside. It had spent at least 15 years in a field after the PO had run it into something and smashed the front end up. Needed an engine, complete suspension and brakes, some interior love, new front apron, hood, and fenders, new headlight and signal assemblies, wiring, new trim, new glass all around, and exterior paint. I spent a summer getting it running with some help from family friends, but did as much of the work myself as I could. I rebuilt the engine myself using the Muir idiot book as a guide. Figured out the suspension and brakes myself. Did all of the body work myself (after having a friend who could weld replace the panels and some rocker rot), fixed all the electrical myself, and did all the prep for anything I had to send out or have done because it wasn't something I had skill in. By the time I had to sell it, everything was done except the exterior respray and a new headliner.  Every bit of work I did on that car was a new skill or a a different use of a skill I already had. I wasn't even really into cars at the beginning of that project (I was 17 or so when I bought it), but I knew I had to have it when I saw it and was willing to get dirty to make it mine. Every skill I learned while fixing that car up has served me well in the more than 20 years since I first picked up a wrench to start tearing it down.   The real key is to fully understand what needs to be done, and have a general idea of what you're going to do before you start tearing things down. You will undoubtedly find things along that way that you didn't initially see. You'll have to adapt your plans accordingly, but don't lose your vision in the minutia. Do as much of the work yourself as you can, and for things you just can't tackle on your own, find skilled labor you trust to do it right, and take the hit to your budget accordingly. Don't try and half-ass things, you just end up paying for it long term when they fail again and you have to redo them. Be prepared to spend 3x what you think it should cost for paint and body. the labor adds up quickly for minor little things, and it's the single biggest thing people will notice about your project once it's done. Buy quality German parts wherever you can, and try not to skimp out with Chinese aftermarket stuff. And finally, document and label the crap out of every part you take off. You make know where that bolt goes 10 minutes after it comes out of the car, but will you still remember which one it was a month later when it's in a big box with hundreds of others? This will drive you insane eventually.  TL;DR Beetles are awesome first cars and first restoration projects."
beetle,2tnhoz,fatalifeaten,5,Sun Jan 25 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the response! I'm quite aware of how easy bugs are to fix and put together so I figured that they would be a good first car.   If you don't mind me asking, do you have any tips on finding an older bug for sale? Craigslist and eBay have been a cruel mistress."
beetle,2tnhoz,fatalifeaten,8,Sun Jan 25 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"The 2 best places to look are within your local VW community and the samba (http://www.thesamba.com). I picked up my '66 literally on the corner of my neighborhood (after screaming across 3 lanes of traffic and making a U-turn when I saw it), and my '63 and '60 were both word of mouth finds from friends in the community. CL is ok as well, but you have to be looking at the right time and in the right market. I've never had much luck with ebay, people seem to ask really high prices for utter crap when it comes to VW's.  How old are you thinking? The earlier they are, the easier they are to work on, obviously, but the more expensive and scarce the parts become. Later US cars with emissions and safety stuff will be cheaper but because of the safety and emissions stuff may be slightly harder to work on.    DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY A SUPER! You're adding 40% to your costs to try and restore a super because everything is more expensive and harder to source.  Depending on your budget, you can still pick up '58 -'67 cars for reasonable cash, and you can never go wrong with a split or an oval if you've got a bit deeper pockets. keep in mind that with anything other than a stock engine, it can be hard to get them to pass emissions, so if you have laws about what age a car has to be to be exempt from emissions, that might also play a factor in your choice.  (edit: I am a guud spelr)"
beetle,2tnhoz,fatalifeaten,5,Mon Jan 26 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"You are the most helpful person I have ever come across on reddit.   I was trying to keep in the 60s as it seems that anything from the 70s is a rust pile.   Also, thanks for the tip about the supers. I had no idea. Glad you said something too be cause I saw some super cheap supers around my local area."
beetle,2tnhoz,Bermwolf,6,Mon Jan 26 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"Heh, thanks. I think that means I'm failing at reddit. :)  Since you're looking 60's, you've got a couple of options. '58-'64 cars are ""small window"" cars, meaning that they literally have smaller front and rear glass, and the door frames are thicker (making the side windows smaller as well). '65-66' are ""big window"" cars, meaning there's more glass and less sheet metal all around. Now, we're talking a couple of inches. If you don't know the difference, you probably wouldn't even notice it if they were sitting side by side.  I would suggest trying to find a nice workable '62-'66. The earlier ones will probably run at least a grand more, and that can go up depending on options (for example, an original sliding ragtop body will be worth more than a hard top from the same year, and likewise, a convertible body will be nearly double the other 2). If you're going to internet shop, look for one from a dry state (AZ, NM, CA, UT, NV, TX), and do some research into the common areas for rust and rot. We're talking cars that are in their late 40's to 50's now in age, and there will be years of unexpected surprises under every hood or carpet kit. The odds are that even with the cost of having one shipped to you from the Southwest, you're still coming out ahead in the long run if everything near you is a rusting pile. Even if shipping is 1500 bucks, that's parts +8 hours of panel repair labor in a body shop. bets on getting major work done in 8 hours? Not likely, unless it's crappy work. The better your foundation, the less you're going to end up paying loong term.  Try and locate one that will play to your strengths from a skill perspective, or that will fit your overall budget if you're planning on sending a lot of the work out.  As an example, when I bought my '66, I did so because the bodywork was all done and it had a fresh coat of paint and decent interior. I'm competent mechanically, but my body skills are still not the the greatest in the world. So for me, that car was perfect. Cosmetically it was done, and the mechanical issues were things that I had zero concerns about taking on myself. Even going on 12 years later, the paint's still in excellent shape and it turns heads every time I roll it.  Now, if you want to have a bit more of a challenge, here's an alternate.  '67 is the first 12 volt model, the first model with upright sealed beam headlights (vs earlier sloped style), front fenders change, decklid changes, tons of stuff changes. 1967 has a LOT of very hard to find one year only parts, but if you can track them down, this is one of the best of the '60s. This year is very collectible, so you're going to pay more up front for one. People know very well the value for these and the odds of one showing up for a steal aren't great. It happens, but...  Hope that helps."

Floor pans aren't a big deal if you've got a few tools (welder, air compressor, air hammer tool thing (gotta break the old welds)).  There's a great Bug-Me video on pan replacement, and you can do it body-on or body-off.  I did mine body-on and it went smoothly (few pics); used WolfsburgWest floor pans, shipping wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be -- ~$50 iirc to US East Coast.  Where are you?  Thing that would scare me the most on that project is your subi swap. There's a lot of people who start these then abandon them when they realize just how much work it is.  Go forth and search theSamba.com, there's a few people who have documented their swaps; make sure it's something you're prepared for. Otherwise, really, a 1971+ 1600cc DP aircooled VW engine is pretty okay."
beetle,2thyhk,windetch,2,Sat Jan 24 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"71 standard.  I'm in the Midwest, and have all the tools needed to do the pans. My only concern was sourcing.  I know how much work goes into the swap. Lot of hunting down parts (radiators a bitch), wiring, lots of wires. Etc. If i can get it running, I'll put it off until i have everything sourced and out of the subaru to go it. If not it'll become a slower project."
beetle,2thyhk,windetch,1 point,Sat Jan 24 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"Cool. If you've done the research and understand the effort involved with a subi swap that's great.  The good thing about VW Beetles is so many were made and are still around you won't really have any issues sourcing parts. One of the problems is a lot of part production has shifted to China (etc) and the quality on a bunch of stuff is rather lacking. Buy from places like wolfsburgwest.com, aircooled.net, cbperformance.com etc and you'll do alright. You can also get a bunch of used stuff from theSamba.com's classifies, original German parts are nearly always preferred when possible.   But yeah.. you may already be familiar with one, having previous bugs in the family, but get a tow bar for the car. Bugs pull real easy with one (given good tires and wheel bearings) and you wont have to rent a trailer or call and wait for a tow truck."
beetle,2thyhk,winewagens,1 point,Sat Jan 24 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you know what you're talking about, which is good.  Just an FYI, there are some 71 parts that are one year only.  I.e. the turn signal switch (had to replace mine and it was a PITA to find the right one that wasn't shit quality.)  The Midwest eh?  That's my neck of the woods.  MAM is overpriced.  Your wallet will be better off sourcing from many other reputable vendors mentioned, as well as a few not listed.  Your eventual Subaru swap should make use of this samba thread about an autocrossed 58 to get some info about parts to use, etc.  I haven't looked at that thread in a few months but have read most of it over the years and am fairly impressed."

I like smaller businesses, but unless these are NOS or made of gold I'm at a loss for words.  There were supposed Lobro bus CVs on this site though, which is interesting.  The parts photos don't seem to be NOS parts, just generic stock photos with the site name added on top in some photo editing program.  I'd be curious if we actually got a reply, especially since the account has been around for a year, yet has little activity until now.  If it was some sort of social media marketing wouldn't they be a bit more active?

beetle,2t4lkp,Bandgreen,1 point,Wed Jan 21 02:50:19 2015 UTC,"Nearly all 12v car heaters that plug into the cigarette lighter aren't worth it. There are some heaters you can hook directly to the battery (ex), but they tend to be expensive and if you still have a generator on your engine it wont keep up with the draw -- so it'll drain your battery.  A high amp alternator could handle it, and that may be an option.    Just realize that Power = Volts * Current, so even if a heater draws 50A (a lot), 50A at 14v = 700W.  Or around half the amount of a small 120v space heater.  This topic describes your bug's stock heating system rather well -- (theSamba link)  I just got through rebuilding the heating system in my '70 (flaps, heaterboxes, defrost system) and it was worth while.  It doesn't move much air at idle, but if you're cruising it does fairly well.    Biggest thing is going to be your heater channels (what the running boards bolt to, there's a pipe in there to run heat to the front of the car).  If they're not in good shape they're a pain to deal with (cut out and weld in replacements). A pair of good original heater boxes is also needed.  Compare - (stock) vs. (aftermarket). Flaps allow the engine to warm up much quicker giving you heat sooner (its also better for the engine). A few other pieces involved, but if those three are present you can make it work.  If you post pics of what you've got we can tell you what you're missing."

beetle,2t096z,richcreations,2,Tue Jan 20 02:50:54 2015 UTC,found the culprit :)  http://i.imgur.com/RWh5rJH.jpg
beetle,2t096z,windetch,2,Tue Jan 20 08:18:33 2015 UTC,"Have you changed out the rubber fuel lines?  'cause that's where I'd start. There's ~ 4 of them; one under the tank, one from the tunnel to the engine, one to the fuel pump, and the last from the fuel pump to carb. There's a metal line that runs through the engine's front tin, be sure there's a grommet there else you'll eventually get a leak.    The rust in the first pic by the tank looks like one of the brake reservoir lines leaked at some point.  That stuff kills paint.  From the pic it just looks like surface rust.  Clean, sand, and paint it.    If the tin in the engine pic is damp from gas don't drive the car again till you figure out where it's coming from.  Beetles don't do well with gas flying around in the engine compartment, tend to burst into flames. If that's just oil, /shrug.    But yeah, I mean, these are simple little cars.  If you're leaking gas it's going to be fairly obvious where.  Shine a flashlight around and look for a damp spot that smells of gas. Do you have a fuel filter?  'cause if it's one of those little plastic see-through ones and it's not full of rust flakes your tank is likely alright.  If you don't have a filter it may be a good idea to have one; under the gas tank or in the line that runs from tunnel to engine are decent places."

beetle,2sqsp2,mist91,1 point,Sat Jan 17 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"A word of caution about online engine ads. You might see rebuilds advertised for a grand but that's probably a stock 1600 longblock (no carb, intake, tins, fan, generator/alternator, clutch, etc...), and that's kind of a bargain basement rebuild price. A solid rebuild from most reputable shops for just a longblock will run closer to 2 grand with a core exchange. You definitely get what you pay for when looking for cheap VW parts online.   Think about it this way.  The rule of thumb is to mark stuff up 100% for resale, so a 1000 dollar rebuild is 500 bucks to the seller in parts and labor. Good quality German parts for a rebuild are about $650 PLUS the labor to rebuild the engine (which is 4-8 hours depending on how good the builder is and how complicated the job.) So let's say A shop is 4 hours to do a rebuild. At a cheap rate of 60/hr. So that's another 240 bucks in labor and you're looking at 900 for the rebuild, parts and labor. Now double that for resale and for a quality stock rebuild, you just hit 1800 bucks. So what's really in that 1k rebuilt engine, eh? Assume the same 4 hours minimum, you can't really do them much faster than that. So for 260 bucks (500-the 240 labor), how good do you think those parts really are, and/or what are they replacing?  If you want to DIY, you need to take your parts to a machine shop and have them cleaned and inspected to make sure that what you have now is even usable in a rebuild. Make a list of what you can keep, what you're going to need to replace/upgrade, and get all your parts. Get a Bentley manual if you don't have one. (Honestly the Muir idiot book will get you through a stock rebuild too, but if you're going to build something beefy, don't use this.) They have the torque specs, build procedure, and clearance tolerances you're going to need. Then start your rebuild. Take it slowly and make sure you completely understand each step before you commit. notching sucks worse then bolting the case halves together and finding out your mains weren't seated correctly and are now ruined.  TL;DR inventory your parts, get a manual, build carefully and to spec, and be wary of 1k engine rebuilds."

beetle,2sqsp2,fatalifeaten,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on the shop. Find a machine shop that does Aircooled VW work. Not all of them do. Give them a call, explain what you've got and what you'd like to do and ask them for options. My machinist will break cases down if that's what you want, at the normal shop labor rate (usually 60-90 per hour). I usually save myself the dough, assume than any engine I get that is not running needs to be gone through, and break it all down before I take it in. My usual machining (align bore, full flow, and a thrust cut if needed) typically runs 120-140 bucks from my machinist.   Most shops have rates for things like inspecting suspect parts, so just be sure you ask and that you and the machinist both agree on the work and the rates."

Your odometer may be a bit inaccurate, especially if you have different sized tires than stock.   Best way to get a more accurate mpg read is to use a GPS, most of the automotive ones have an odometer of sorts built in.  Reset it when you get gas, then next fill up you'll know roughly how many gallons you put in and how far you got. Or if you're going on a longer run, use Google Maps to measure the distance between the gas stations you filled up at.  At 5mpg you're only going to make it 50 miles on a 10 gallon tank.      It'll vary a little depending when the pump cuts off, but averaged over a few fillups you'll get a fairly good idea."

I originally thought I'd get this car for my 18 year-old son for his first car, but after some thought I decided it wasn't very safe for a driver with no experience, so I decided to restore it and sell it. I got my son a 2000 Land Rover Disco 2 instead...the thing is a tank.  1970 VW Bug 1600cc Dual Port  What was right:  Great floor boards, zero rust, great running 1600 dual port single carb, one piece windows, new sound system, good clutch, almost new tires, nice interior, rack, wheels.   What was wrong: The front has been hit, front beam was cut and turned and is now bent, all ball joints and tie rod ends are shot, the oil cooler is and has been leaking, valve covers are leaking, heater has been unhooked, needs significant body work and paint.  What my mechanic and I did: Swap out the front beam that was welded with a adjustable beam w/disc brake upgrade, pull the motor and do the oil cooler and clean everything up, new heater tubes, paint, various details."

beetle,2s8u7m,lost-in-the-world,2,Tue Jan 13 04:02:44 2015 UTC,"Buy a complete, good, used set of real Italian or Spanish Weber 34ICTs off thesamba. Or a set of good, used Kadron 40/44s.  Make sure to get throttle shaft verification of them not being worn out or make sure they have been rebushed.  Let's do an edit:  My 71 bug has a mystery dual port motor in it.  Previously it was in a car I bought to fix, then realized it was too much for me.  I got it to run off a gas can but it had no exhaust.  The carb was a stock 34pict3.  I kept that, then threw on a stock exhaust before installing it in my bug.  It ran well without issues (minus the ugly chrome tin that is peeling.)  I got my hands on a set of 40 Kadrons from my friend's shop, then got a used header with a phatboy muffler.  After that I lucked into a Bosch 010.  So I installed all those parts and it drives entirely differently.  Though I will say that the muffler hangs a bit low on my stock height bug so at times it can scrape on bumps.  If you do an upgrade to dual carbs make sure you have a matching distributor (tapped carbs that can run with vacuum can and a T fitting or just stay with a good centrifugal only distributor.)  An exhaust upgrade is always a good idea due to less restriction.  Mine resembles this one or is this one, I can't remember anymore.  My header is just black steel though.  http://www.jbugs.com/product/3201w3102.html?Category_Code=vw-bug-super-beetle-mufflers-headers-system  The exhaust you posted seems to be backordered.

The button on the right will light up if your brake fluid system loses pressure, and when it's not lit up, you can push it and it will light up to confirm you have pressure in the brake fluid system.  Fun VW prank: I told my GF that button was the ""auxiliary horn button"" and was there so passengers could honk the horn if they saw something the driver missed. I kept my left thumb on the horn button on the steering wheel, and reached out my right finger, pressed that brake button and honked the horn when it lit up. Then I had her try it and did the same thing. She didn't notice my left hand at all. Weeks later, she saw someone she knew as we drove by and started hitting that brake button to try to honk at them. When nothing happened, she looked at me confused, and then I said, ""Oh! Try it again!"" And this time it ""worked"" because I knew to honk. She caught on quickly, and we both had a good laugh."

If you want a chrome fan shroud or other tin I think it would be too much but that's just my opinion. Just be aware that if you buy chrome tin it likely won't be the quality of your stock tin if you still have it. And the reason the tin was originally painted black was to keep the engine as cool as possible, chrome reflects heat and would likely make your engine run hotter. So all in all a few chrome accessories could be nice but I wouldn't recommend  chrome tin."

beetle,2ry073,ORGrown,1 point,Sat Jan 10 07:04:21 2015 UTC,"Start with the things that changed while you weren't driving the car. If the battery was weak when you started it (to the point that you had to push start) then only driving a few blocks wouldn't be enough to charge it back up. I would check your battery with a multimeter after a long drive (at least 15 minutes) to make sure that it didn't die on you. Also, if you changed the alternator belt, make sure that the belt isn't slipping (look for shiny spots on the belt) that would lead to power problems also.   Is your choke engaged? Keep in mind that in most places, it is a LOT colder right now than it was a month ago. The choke will help a bunch if set properly. Also making sure the car is nice and warm before you are really getting the rpm's up on it will help it run smoother.  I would HIGHLY suggest checking everything that you did to the car in the month it hasn't been running before you go making other adjustments. If the car was running fine a month ago, but now that it has a new belt and low battery it isn't running well, would it make sense to adjust the carb? While it might need that adjustment, odds are definitely that it isn't the problem you are looking for. And a carb adjustment should be the very last thing you do after every other part of your timing and regular maintenance (dist, points, valves, plugs, oil change, filters, etc..) If you adjust your carb without those other things perfect, your will not be running the proper fuel/air mixture, which is not good for your bug at all."

beetle,2ry073,DoubleHawk4Life,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"Just set your meter to voltage and touch your leads directly to the battery. I forget exactly what you should get for a reading, but that's easy enough to Google. The only other thing I might do is check the plugs again. Maybe replace them of you only gaped them before. Other than that it sounds like you are on the right track."

We timed the vehicle, adjusted the carb (was idling a little low and it was running rich). Took it on a few spins and everything seems to be fine now. Just for sh*ts and giggles I will put a multimeter on the battery to see what it does read."

beetle,2ry073,ORGrown,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:17:07 2015 UTC,"well, depending on how cold as fuck it gets. When we were down in the single digits a little while back, even adjusted properly it was a little tough to start. There should be some marks on your choke and carb that when lined up should be in the right spot. You may have to move it back or forward a little to get it perfect. You can check it by starting the car from being dead cold, give it one pump on the gas pedal to activate the choke (do that before you start it) and then go look at your carb. You want the throttle arm on the carb to be resting on the top notch of your fast idle cam, but keep in mind, that should only be for a little while, while the car warms up. After a drive, check it again and it should be not resting on any notch on the fast idle cam.  Also, make sure you drop down to a little thinner oil if it's really cold, that'll help with the cold starts"
beetle,2ry073,IWillfuckingKillYouM,0,Sat Jan 10 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'll dig into the choke tomorrow morning. Thursday is my next tune up, what kind of oil do you recommend? I'm using 20w50 currently."

You have to be willing to go thru little extra steps to keep it running and on the road. Cold temps mean you have to really let the engine warm up before you drive. No coolant, remember? Oil takes longer to heat. Rain, well its tires wipers and seals.   I have owned many including a 67 standard and 63 convertible. Both rebuilt and semi-restored.   I do not reccomend it as your first beater. Especially with no mechanical knowledge.   But! There are always communities of aircooleds willing to help out a new driver.

Those are old enough to be cheap and new enough to have all the wonderful things like hydraulic valves, anti-lock brakes, airbags, etc. btw, no power steering on the bug, but it's light enough to not need it.  Most aircooled bugs you're going to find are 40+ years old now.  That's a fairly long time, and most of them (esp the ones in your price range (assuming), and esp some of the bajas) have had very questionable maintenance.  People do some weird things (ex).  If you're willing to buy some tools (give this post a skim - (link)) and put up with the various frustrations and limitations of owning something this old...  sure, why not.

beetle,2rhc47,pandabassoon,2,Tue Jan 6 04:34:22 2015 UTC,"Snow wont hurt it, sand wont hurt it, but the salt will kill it.    Since you're in NY be aware that Bugs are known for somewhat lackluster heat.  If the heating system is complete (every last bit) you can get by. They did make auxiliary gas heaters as an option, one of those little torpedo turbine-looking things mounted in the trunk above the driver's side front tire.  Most people who live in the salt-zones that like their bugs and want to keep 'em park it in the winter at the first sign of road salt.    If you search theSamba.com you'll find a few recommendations like yearly coatings with fluid-film and weekly washes.  Can clean it up and apply POR15 or similar, prep is the biggest thing there.    But yeah...  I'm sure you've seen the rust up there. Best thing you can do for a bug is to get a winter beater."
beetle,2rhc47,windetch,3,Tue Jan 6 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"The heating in a Bug with the heating system complete and functioning is excellent. I don't know why the misconception that Bugs have bad or inadequate heating persists – probably because many Bugs had the heating partially or entirely removed or not properly reconnected after taking the engine out. Also, if the heat exchangers or the heater channels are rusted and have holes, obviously the heating won't be very good.  I wholeheartedly agree with your comments about salt."
beetle,2rhc47,dagovix,1 point,Tue Jan 6 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"Ish.  I'd say it's mostly workable instead of excellent.    There was a topic a month or two back on theSamba about a guy with a complete, working heating system that regularly got stuck in slow traffic on the way to work.  Guess how well he was rating his heating system.    If the stock system was excellent there would have been no need for dealers to fit on the aux gas heater (which apparently do work very well). And again, that's stock.  These things are 40+ years old and a lot of times have aftermarket parts -- including the heaterboxes.  It's a shame that, afaik, none of the aftermarket heaterboxes work anywhere close to as good as the factory ones.   /shrug.  But yeah. In New York he has a halfway decent chance of finding a bug where someone kept the heating system functional, but a lot of times people just let 'em go and he'll end up Frozen."

beetle,2rgsri,RamblingMutt,3,Tue Jan 6 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure about your engine description.  A 1974 Type II bus in the USA had a TIV pancake style engine (shared with the 411/412 car and Porsche 914, then introduced in 72 to the bus and continued in some iteration in them until 1982.)  European buses had an upright 1600cc like in a bug as an option.  If it's a stock 1600cc from 1974 and you're in the USA then the engine was originally in a beetle and somebody put it in a bus at one time.  Easy way to tell is to check the serial number below the generator pedestal.  AH is 1974 bug dual relief 1600cc dual port.  Anyway, the easiest to understand way to do performance upgrades without splitting the case is in the side bar.  The link entitled Aircooled easy bolt on mods.  A larger exhaust and dual carbs are the simplest starting bolt on modifications.  Weber 34ICTs, Kadron 40/44s, and the EMPI knockoffs are the better options.  You can use Weber 40s on a bug but you have to make sure the jets are right (well you have to on all carbs) or you wind up with terrible performance issues."

beetle,2re7wq,Cannis_Yasei,3,Tue Jan 6 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"Mine has a bit of a fuzzy past.    At some point she had a front end collision, I know this from the orange paint on the inside of the hood (bug was originally green and is now red, never orange), fairly sure the passenger side fender is also a replacement, and there's a very slight crimp in the sheet metal below the gas flap. No frame damage appears to have been done though.  After that I'm thinking she sat outside for a while, her luggage area and floor pans were rusted from the inside out and there's evidence of a rear window leak.    At some point a guy wanting to do an EV conversion found it, fairly sure it was then that it got patched up.  Replacement hood, hood strut, fender, maybe the front clip, a coat of red paint, and he also 'repaired' some rust with caulk, rivets, and random bits of metal.  He then swapped in a US military surplus aircraft generator for the electric motor, threw 12(ish) lead acid batteries where the back seat was, and put a backup generator in the trunk.    A friend of the family bought it thinking it'd be a fun thing to play with, as he only lives a few miles from work.  Unfortunately he couldn't do any of the repairs himself and got tired of having it towed in to a garage.  The last straw was someone he had poking it miswired the battery pack, killing most of the batteries.    That's when I was asked if I wanted it.  Said 'sure' and went out to meet the AAA tow truck. Got it home, evaluated the EV system, and determined that if I wanted to leave it as an electric car it'd cost me around $4k to redo the lead-acid battery conversion (basically nothing salvageable).  Which would only give me a ~20 mile range.  A lithium conversion would run ~ $8k+ and wasn't in the budget.  So back to gas it went.  I'm now ~ 2.5 years in playing with it.  First year went real slow, gathering parts and learning about the car.  But now she's mostly functional once again.  All traces of caulk and rivets have been removed, rust cut out and patch panels welded in place.  Been using her as a daily driver between the times when her butt is in the air.  Fun car.  But yeah.

beetle,2rcqdb,Hillfood,2,Mon Jan 5 01:17:18 2015 UTC,That car would at best go for about $2000 in Washington state. Maybe $2500 if the floors had no holes in it and the body had little or no damage.  (Edit more information) I don't know if they salt the road in the winter where you live. Or the going prices in your area. But if you would be willing to post some pictures. Tell us the condition of the floors and the heater channels we could give you a better price.
beetle,2rcqdb,InfiniteWut,1 point,Mon Jan 5 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"They don't salt the roads much, if at all, mostly just sand for traction. There might be a bit of salt mixed in though, I have no idea. If the seller doesn't mind me taking some pictures I'll bring them here, but it's their property for now so I'm not going to do anything shady. I will bring the information here though, once I've got more, and I'll gladly take advice on whatever I do come back with. Thanks!"
beetle,2rcqdb,khartster,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:50:40 2015 UTC,"Check the underside for rust or if its been sealed recently, take a look at the replacement pans to get an idea of what they should look like stamped wise so you can see if there is any patching. Any patching near the rear tires is bad, 4 inches from the back of the pan is probably the battery which is common. I should probably take pictures of my 72 literally everything that could be wrong with the body is, luckily I bought it for the frame.  You live in OK so do you want heat, make sure the heater channels are working if you want it.   Rebuilt long blocks are about $1100 Transmissions are about $800-900 for nicer rebuilds.   If you want to learn the ins and out quick by Jon Muirs book for decent read on what to look for and how to check things. Otherwise its a used car and take it to a mechanic for engine related inspection.   What do you want to do with the beetle? Just a classic driving car or do you want to modify it/restore it? Its good to have a primary car, not that I wouldn't trust the engine to start most mornings but sometimes shit just brakes and it takes a day or two to figure it out and get a replacement part."
beetle,2rcqdb,teomcdohl,1 point,Mon Jan 5 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"I'd already planned to look underneath and at the heater channels since those are the number one things everyone says about buying an older beetle, but thanks for the suggestion of looking at replacement parts to give me an idea what it's supposed to look like. I hadn't thought of that.  I definitely want heat, it does get pretty cold here around this time of year up until about March.  I want the car because I've always wanted an old beetle. I love the way they look and the fact that it's a specific type of person who owns and drives one, especially after all this time. I'm probably not going to do too much restoration to it since it looks like it's in pretty good shape, but there's always the chance that I'll catch the bug and start wanting to make it look even better. I do have a primary car, this would be something that I drive every day to and from work unless weather is too bad or it was acting up and I'll still have my Jetta for longer trips and backup."
beetle,2r9qps,wintertash,2,Sun Jan 4 04:11:42 2015 UTC,"Easiest to check and fix is bullet point #3 -  No power at coil with the ignition in the ""On"" position.    If you don't have a multimeter go get a digital one, even Walmart carries a halfway decent model. Use that to check the voltage at the coil with ignition on.  The coil's power wire was originally not fused (for whatever reason), power runs straight from the ignition switch.  Here's a wiring diagram - (link) If you've got the original wiring that wire or it's connectors could be getting old and brittle and not passing on the amount of voltage the coil needs.    On the Pertronix electronic ignition, I don't think I'd worry too much about the cold.  They rate it to -50F (link).    With your other not-starting problem, that's more than likely an issue with your ignition switch.  Here's a quick fix guide - (link)    Also, stick that battery on a charger if you haven't already.  An already weak battery left out in the cold will substantially harm it's lifespan."
beetle,2r9qps,windetch,1 point,Sun Jan 4 06:21:10 2015 UTC,"It didn't look like I was getting any voltage on the multimeter, but I'm having a hard time accepting that result, and want to keep user error on the table there.   As to the earlier issue, while it sounds similar, I'm not so sure. I did have lights and everything, but the car couldn't even be bump started, which would seem independent of the connection between the ignition and starter.   Between the two though, I have been wondering about just bypassing the ignition entirely and seeing if the car starts. The downside is that hotwiring a car can be hazardous for its health and yours, but on the upside, if the problem is in the ignition mechanism, that would make it clear."
beetle,2r9qps,khartster,1 point,Sun Jan 4 07:07:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe youve done this. Take the coil output line that ties the coil to the distributor. Remove it from the distributor and hold it very close to the engine case and have a buddy try and start the car. You should see fairly prominent sparks and frequent. If it looks like they aren't consistent sparks it could be the coil died. 1cm distance should show them.  Try a spare Bosch coil $20 amazon Run a spare wire from the battery to the input power on the coil just get it long enough to go around the car.  Had to replace.my coil last year, had turned over but just refused to after I had just rewired."
beetle,2r9qps,windetch,1 point,Sun Jan 4 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"That's the exact test I did, and how I determined I was having a spark failure issue. There was NO visible (or audible) spark from the coil wire, and I did the test at night even.   The fact that the incoming line to positive on the coil seems cold makes me think it's wiring rather than a bum coil, but trying a replacement is also on the list of options."
beetle,2r9qps,wiso4,1 point,Sun Jan 4 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"It didn't look like I was getting any voltage on the multimeter   Ah, you mentioned the battery getting low so I thought maybe you were using a 12v test light.  The ignition switch will send whatever it can from the battery to the coil, be that 12.8v or 11.5v. If you're seeing zero volts make sure you ground the multimeter's negative lead securely (carb works well) and put the positive lead on the coil wire; can disconnect it from the coil to isolate it.    If you can't get any reading on the coil try up at the fuse panel, the coil wire is connected to the non-fused side of the switched-power fuse.  If stuff is lighting up when you turn the key on you should have power there. If there is power at the fuse panel but not at the coil that points towards the wire inbetween as the problem.    But yeah, for diagnostic purposes you can run a wire from the positive terminal on the battery back to the coil. The wire from the ignition that switches on the starter solenoid runs under the rear seat then exits where the brake line exits the car.  If you take this wire (or run another) and tap it on the battery's positive terminal your starter will engage.  Please make sure the car is in neutral and handbrake applied before attempting. Also, the Pertronix doesn't like to be 'on' and not running, so limit the time the coil is hooked up but the car not starting or attempting to start."

beetle,2ph3se,windetch,4,Tue Dec 16 15:26:02 2014 UTC,"I submitted a pic of my EL wire'd speedometer when I posted my dash ~ a month ago. A few people were curious about it, so when I tore it down and re-did it over the weekend I took a few more pictures.  I believe the old setup suffered from a short in the EL wire power connection, which melted my inverter.  I previously had two strands connected in parallel, one for the speedometer and one for the fuel gauge.  This time I only used one continous strand, so no soldering.  As long as the Adafruit connector was done properly (can't imagine it wasn't) and my new inverter doesn't melt itself, this should last a good long time.  Here's hoping anyways"

My engine came with a sealed pump that failed and dumped gas into the oil.  Replaced it with a rebuildable Piersburg pump, but with the rebuild kit from WolfsburgWest (confirmed to be what they believe is the correct kit) I was getting 10psi -- waaay too much.  I followed all the steps including pre-loading it, then tore it apart 3x trying to fix it. After a good bit of downtime waiting on parts I said screw it and put in the electric. Couldn't be happier.    There's since been a few topics on theSamba of people having the same problem with the new rebuild kits, I'm disappointed WolfsburgWest chose to sell such a crappy product. So yeah, if you rebuild your pump be sure to check the pressure."

beetle,2p4nvf,Fweaka,2,Sat Dec 13 00:20:24 2014 UTC,"Depends on which one.    The CB Performance one may require you shave just a hair off the unit itself (basically just one of the top molded fins) or it'll hit the pulley tin.  Why that did that who knows, doesn't affect the unit at all (it's thick metal). It otherwise just plops in. Pic - http://imgur.com/IlT4ey0  Just a note, be careful with the mexi filter off aircooled.net (this one).  It's pump is running 30mm gears instead of the stock 26mm, which is really a lot more pressure than a stock engine needs."
beetle,2p4nvf,windetch,1 point,Sat Dec 13 03:48:54 2014 UTC,Why would it be bad to get 30mm?
beetle,2p4nvf,windetch,1 point,Sat Dec 13 09:11:01 2014 UTC,"Oil pressure.  The larger the gears on an oil pump the more pressure they put out. Your engine was designed with certain pressures in mind, see this topic - (link). One of the more important pieces is the oil cooler bypass which keeps cold, high pressure oil out of the cooler.  When the oil warms up it allows oil to flow though the cooler, but if you're running too thick an oil with your 30mm pump the pressure may never get low enough while you're driving and so the oil wouldn't get to the cooler.  But yeah, basically just search ""26mm vs 30mm oil pump"" on theSamba and you'll have your answer.  Your engine was designed for 26mm, use 26mm."

beetle,2p4nvf,jbrandt01,1 point,Sat Dec 13 17:46:27 2014 UTC,"Probably, depends how tired your engine is. If it's otherwise running good 10w 30 Rotella is great.  20w-50 is fairly heavy, depends how warm it is where you live. You'll want to run a lighter oil in the winter.  I put on my filter pump from CB Performance a couple months ago, just as it started getting cooler, so I'm running a 5w-30 synthetic and it appears to be perfectly happy (got an oil pressure gauge in the dash so I can watch it).  Will re-evaluate come spring, ran 15w-40 Rotella in the summer 10w-30 in the winter previously."

beetle,2ozgg7,winewagens,1 point,Thu Dec 11 22:30:19 2014 UTC,60-73 were the same splines.  A 71 super and a 71 standard have a steering wheel that is dished with a chrome horn button and the wiper switch on the dash.    A 72 super has a giant black plastic horn button on a flatter wheel and the wiper switch on the column.  The dish of the 71 and earlier wheel does not work with the column mounted wiper switch.

If it's just the nut/bolt that tightens the clamp then any nut/bolt combo that fits will work, no need to take out the dizzy. If it's the bolt that holds the clamp to the engine block you'll need to get the remains of the old bolt out, there are reverse thread tools that can do that cheaply. If you need to replace the whole clamp then yes, you'll need to remove the dizzy. Take the cap off, loosen the clamp (I assume it is already!) And gently pull it out, a little twist back and fourth helps. Make sure you don't lose the little spring inside the dizzy hole. Bolt new clamp onto the engine and loosen the timing bolt, check the rings are in good order on the shaft, add a bit of grease and reinsert gently, keeping in mind It can only go in one way. Look in the hole and line up the gear on the bottom of the dizzy with the notch in the hole. Do your timing, tighten the bolt (doesn't need to be torqued hard, hand right with your ratchet is fine) and you're away."

Wondering why I can see the driver's side tire from the inside, wouldn't appear to be rust damage - looks like that hole was cut.  Haven't seen the movie in forever, but I can't think of a reason to put a hole there.  Also wish the engine was more complete, especially since they claim it's a driver.  Generator is installed wrong, 's missing the breast plate tin, only got one of the air hoses hooked up (and the airbox's is just missing), and a somewhat dirty fuel filter is just chilling directly above the distributor with no clamps. Nothing huge (visible anyways), just sloppy.  And a shame someone let the interior go, driver's seat is straight torn up.  Ah well, very cool nonetheless. Fun to think this was probably someone's daily driver before 1972 when Disney bought it, hacked it up, stuck some stripes and stickers on it, and made it iconic."
beetle,2optvn,windetch,2,Tue Dec 9 15:32:32 2014 UTC,"Maybe the hole was in part to help the person driving see where he's going? (not sure how...

beetle,2olefx,Runnyn0se,2,Sun Dec 7 23:37:28 2014 UTC,"Between .003 and .005 is definitely where you want to be. Did you use the same shim stack you took out or did you change some of the shims? When you say it won't turn over, do you mean installed, or even pulled and on the stand? If it wouldn't turn over in the car, make sure it wasn't binding on the starter or somehow wedged up on the bellhousing.  I'd pull it back out, pull the flywheel, make sure that rear main seal is FLUSH to the lip on the case. Try and use the same shim stack you took out, and only use 3 shims. Also make sure the little oil gasket in the flywheel is correctly installed into the groove in the back side of the flywheel or you're going to end up oiling down your clutch, even if you replace the rear main.  The shims in a shim pack have different thicknesses, so you might need to try different combinations in order to get the right play. Once you have the end play within spec, pull the plugs and turn it over by hand with a big spanner to make sure it's able to rotate freely. Then reinstall. If it turns over by hand out of the car, but still seems like it's wedged when you reinstall, check to make sure you have correctly installed the clutch plate, that the throw out bearing and shifter fork are not perished, and that the starter is not stuck.  Best of luck."

beetle,2ob5d6,Sandusky_D0NUT,2,Thu Dec 4 23:28:04 2014 UTC,"Yep.  You'll want to pull the wiper assembly out of the car and check it over.  The wipers on my '70 were okay for a while, then one day they stopped.  The outer joints were completely frozen, had to soak in PBlaster for a few hours before they even considered coming apart. Greased everything (including inside the gear box, all the old grease was bad), plopped it back in and so far so good.  The motor has three little brushes in it, look something like this - (pic).  Those are wear pieces and eventually need replacing.  If you want, you can test the motor connections with a multimeter just to be sure it's getting power before you pull it, but odds are decent it'll need to come out."
beetle,2ob5d6,windetch,1 point,Fri Dec 5 05:06:42 2014 UTC,Check and lube the linkages. Make sure nothing popped out of place. Make sure nothing is stopping the linkages from moving (like a jam). It could possibly be your wiper motor. Also make sure you go over the wiring again (check grounds and power).

beetle,2o7cct,richcreations,2,Thu Dec 4 11:55:58 2014 UTC,"Chromeoly pushrods don't expand nearly as much as stock Aluminum pushrods, and therefore don't need the clearance for expansion, so if you run them at .006, the valves will always be pounding on the valve seats, eventually causing the dreaded sucked valve.  Scat (they built my motor) made it very clear the .000-.001 was very important."

The '71 and 72' Super Beetles had the same dash as the Standards, the '73+ Supers got a curved windshield and the new dash.  Now, some people have done custom (usually one-off) dash mods with varying amount of success.  This one (link) is probably the best I've seen.    But like longboard said, you're better off just finding something you can live with. If you hate the dash pads but are otherwise okay with 68+ you can pull the pad and run plain metal, I believe that was stock for a few years longer in Europe."

It's vinyl with padding, not plastic. A fair few people do remove them though, for example - (link).  A few holes to fill, vents that need swapping out for the non-pad versions, glovebox lid, ashtray, and maybe the knobs.  Not a huge deal.    Good luck in your search"

My dad's Baja developed this problem earlier this year. It ended up being points, so we put another distributor in it to get it going until we were able to get a new set of points. So you may try a little emry cloth to remove any residue or new points/condenser.  The correct term I was looking for is an idle cut off valve. It should be a cylinder with an electrical spade on the right side of the 30pict or left if it is an h30/31. Make sure first your carb and then your cylinders are getting fuel."
beetle,2o0p5r,superbeetle71,1 point,Tue Dec 2 16:30:45 2014 UTC,It may be something as small as the distributor having to much advance. Try twisting the distributor to the left or right.

Also try checking the resistance through your coil to see if the coil is still good, or check the coil to ground spark by taking the end of the plug wire running from coil to distributor, and holding that about 1/4"" away from a chassis ground. A big blue spark is desirable. a weak orange or yellow spark is bad.   edit: resistance between + and - terminals; should be between 2 and 4 ohms."

They're the gold standard for spindles. CIP1's are Made by EMPI, who have a long track record of mediocre manufacturing and poor quality control in China. To EMPI's credit, they're making improvements, and in some areas (like carbs) they're actually a competitive alternative. I just don't know how good their spindles are, and if it were me, I wouldn't think twice about spending a bit more for CB's spindles.  Ask yourself if saving 60 or 80 bucks is worth the potential safety risk if they fail or cause other steering / braking components to fail because they're not up to snuff."

beetle,2n4w4h,rlyx6x,1 point,Sun Nov 23 03:06:18 2014 UTC,sounds like it needs tuning- flat spots can often be tuned out. what distributor are you using?
beetle,2n4w4h,WEINER_SCHLAP,1 point,Sun Nov 23 03:27:19 2014 UTC,Whats you distributer? it's likely that you have a Bosh 009 distributer or a copy of it. There common on bugs but where meant to run at fixed speeds and don't have the advance curve.  Or it could be fuel related.
beetle,2n4w4h,funkmachine7,1 point,Sun Nov 23 13:03:44 2014 UTC,"009s have a flat spot, just off idle (not at all what OP describes) with certain lean burn carbs of the 70s, they really get a bad rap because of this...  this could be an accelerator pump or mixture issue/adjustment with the carb, stuck ignition advance, wrong timing, vacuum leaks etc..."
beetle,2n4w4h,richcreations,1 point,Sun Nov 23 23:05:23 2014 UTC,"Which brand carburetor did you get? Most of the new carbs are rather iffy -- especially the cheap made in China ones.  It's better to get a rebuilt original German carb, but you might be able to make yours work with enough poking."
beetle,2n4w4h,windetch,1 point,Sun Nov 23 13:54:25 2014 UTC,"Ya I got a euromax carb, and I think they are made in china"
beetle,2n4w4h,windetch,1 point,Sun Nov 23 15:00:04 2014 UTC,"I looked at those last year, ended up getting a rebuilt from Tim at Volkzbitz (link).  Was about the same price and Tim gives a 3 year guarantee.    There's various topics on theSamba about the euromax carbs, ie (link). In that one most people were happy with it, just that it may need a rebuild or mixture screws swapped from your old one."
beetle,2n4w4h,gratsoy,1 point,Sun Nov 23 16:10:38 2014 UTC,"I've had my carb rebuild through Tim, fantastic work. He replates everything so it looks brand new. Functions perfectly too.  Anything Euromax is shit, your car will run so much better if you ditch all the euromax related fuel equipment and switch back to genuine VW."
beetle,2n3xaf,Runnyn0se,3,Sat Nov 22 20:56:49 2014 UTC,"Removing the engine is possible for one person, but so much easier with two.  If you can recruit a helper it'll make your life easier.  Engine is held to the transmission by four bolts: bottom two are easy, top driver's side a bit cramped, and top passenger side annoying (bolt goes through the starter mount and is held in with a nut behind the shroud).  There's various videos on youtube of people dropping their engines, watch a few of them.    You'll want to have a few special tools on hand for this, including a flywheel lock (link), a seal installer (link), and a dial gauge (magnetic base is handy) to check end play (might as well, you're right there).  If the end play isn't quite right (.003"" - .005"") you'll want a pack of shims to set it.  The Bentley Service Manual is also nice to have on hand.  btw, did you buy this (link) or another?"
beetle,2n3xaf,windetch,2,Sat Nov 22 23:07:02 2014 UTC,"Hi, thanks a lot for your helpful reply. Yes I bought the cream bug, I'm in love with it!! Although a few days after getting it home it started to leak oil..  I'm going to do the seal, and give it a service (from the book) it's a bit slow to pick up at low revs.. I'm keen to learn more about the car so I can do any bits myself....  I'll grab the bits you suggested and the Bentley book!"
beetle,2n3xaf,windetch,2,Sat Nov 22 23:48:50 2014 UTC,"Ah well, it is a nearly 40 year old car. Glad you otherwise like it.  Guessing it's dripping from the transmission bellhousing? Make sure it's engine oil and not gear oil, there's a transmission seal in there as well that's a little easier to swap out.  Should be obvious which it is when you drop the engine.  Another tool you might find useful is a torque-meister (link).  Not necessary if you have a large torque wrench, but it makes things easier.  Make sure that gland nut is torqued to spec, it's the only thing holding on the flywheel which you really don't want getting loose.  Fix the leak, check the valves, carb, and timing and you should be good to go Good luck with her"
beetle,2n3xaf,fatalifeaten,1 point,Sun Nov 23 01:18:18 2014 UTC,"You're going to want that torque meister. You have to torque the gland nut to 253 foot pounds / 343 newton meters. you can do it with a cheater bar and some math too, but it's easier with the torque meister. You can also use a piece of wood and a rubber mallet to set the seal and make sure it goes in straight. Just be careful and take your time."

beetle,2n0po3,stuckin1985,1 point,Fri Nov 21 23:31:30 2014 UTC,"Well, in short I've restored this poor bug whith the help of some friends during two years. It's my car but I couldn't have done it without them.   Anyways...  What's been done is that we changed most of the metal underneath the car, with prefabricated floor pans while the rest was of our own making. The engine has been restored with a refurbished engine case, crank shaft cam shaft as well as cylinder tops. All the electrical wires to the engine (all 5 or 6 of them) has been swapped for new ones.  The car was also stripped down, deprieved of all paint and given an acidic coating before it was painted in the original color.   The interior is the same but with new mats. However I made some new door panels in order to not make a hole in the originals.  All this has taken me, with the help of ny friend, about two years while also going to school.  I think that's all the details."

After $1200 I'd done the engine and the electrics, but decided to paint it and change all the dried out rubber parts. I ended up spending about $4500, including the cost of the car ($50) so in total $4550."

beetle,2mwi33,bug442,6,Thu Nov 20 19:14:04 2014 UTC,"That looks really, really good for being in a barn for nearly 30 years!    Would recommend a few things: - Pull the spark plugs and put a little oil in each cylinder.  May smoke a bit on startup but it'll clear out pretty quick. - Fuel pump's diaphragm is likely toast, hardened beyond usability.  If it cracks it'll send fuel directly into the crank case, which sucks.  Replace or rebuild if it still has the original style pump; note, most of the new rebuild kits are just bad -- poorly fitting parts and a diaphragm that'll deliver waaaay too much pressure to your carb (~3psi is what you want).  The Brazil sealed pumps are okay, and a low pressure electric pump is also an option, Carter makes a decent unit. - Gas tank you can tackle now or later, depending how bad the rust is.  If it's really bad replace/coat it now (the lines may clog and starve the engine).  If it's just a little bad throw a filter on it and roll for now. - Change the oil and clean the strainer that pretends to be an oil filter.  The little acorn nuts hold it on and it'll drop down, you'll want new paper or silicone gaskets.  Acorn nuts are torqued very lightly. - Edit: Brakes!  If it really hasn't been touched in 30 years you must flush the brake fluid and probably want to put on new pads before you drive it anywhere. - What shape your carb is in will be apparent pretty quick, I'm leaning towards it needing a rebuild but it's worth a try to see if she'll start up.  Timing will also need to be verified, easiest with a timing light with advance (you change timing by rotating the distributor).    There's two books for you, one that shows the shade-tree mechanic's version of things and the official service manual.  Get both.  The Idiot's Guide by John Muir and the Bentley Service Manual for your year.  If you want, post a picture of the engine bay. Can let you know if there's any visible issues or hackery that should be resolved. As it's an aircooled engine it's best if all the original tins are in place to properly direct airflow.  Good luck with her, looks like a fun car."
beetle,2mwi33,windetch,2,Thu Nov 20 19:52:37 2014 UTC,"One thing I've found decent for rusty tanks that keep clogging lines, just put some kerosene and loose gravel into the tank and shake it pretty good for a few minutes. Rinse out the kerosene and gravel and flush with water to get any loose crud out. Then reinstall and refill.   The kerosene dissolves the varnish/gum/crap gas out and gravel knocks any flaking rust out."
beetle,2mwi33,kizzlebizz,2,Fri Nov 21 00:45:19 2014 UTC,"WOW, that thing is fantastic looking!  I would start by cleaning up the points in the distributor, putting a hot battery on it, spray a little starter fluid in the throat of the carburetor and see if it will fire. If it does don't run it long. From there if the engine sounds healthy, move on to replacing all of the ignition parts (cap, button, wires, condenser and plugs) and rebuild the carburetor (or find a good used one real quick off the craigslist), as well as an oil change and adjust the valves.  I would replace all the brake lines, master cylinder, wheel cylinders, shoes, and tires. Take the fuel tank out and clean it up, and replace all the fuel lines and a new fuel filter. Put a new fuel pump on it, and go from there.   This all sounds real easy, and is all best case scenario, it could be a money pit as well. It probably needs a clutch, throttle cable and clutch cable. All things that go on an average vw, that are now 30 years old. Looks like too much fun though, wish you the best of luck!  Edit for identification- From the pics, it looks to be a barrien t bucket buggy body, on a 67+ beetle pan. The pan looks to be stock length, as most buggies use a shortened beetle pan (take 14 inches out of the back seat area.)"

beetle,2mxl4r,CiscoKidd72,1 point,Fri Nov 28 03:02:17 2014 UTC,"You should really buy a hard start relay kit. With the old setup of the wiring, the power has to go through 20 feet of wiring to get to the starter. With  a hard start relay the power is coming straight from the battery to your starter, totally bypassing the 20 feet of wiring. Look it up on Jbugs.com or Mamotorworks.com. that's what I did when I got the infamous click along with a new starter. That's great! I still have to figure out my fuel gauge. I think I have to bend the floats down some more. But that's a summer job. Here in Oregon it's raining a lot. The only wiring harness they sell for my year is the main harness (the rear)."

beetle,2msf4k,old_po_blu_collar,1 point,Wed Nov 19 21:15:48 2014 UTC,"I've done POR-15 and it's awesome. Buy the system which comes with the cleaner, rust converter, and paint then follow the instructions online. You want as much loose paint and rust removed as possible but surface rust is fine. Once you have it all knocked down (use a wire brush on a drill/grinder for this) clean it then apply the metal prep. The parts will turn white as the prep converts the rust. Once all the rust is converted slap POR-15 over it and you're done. Since POR-15 has really poor UV protection you'll want to spray it with some chassis black once it sets up in 48 hours.  Note that the rust converter works best when it's applied to a wet part at 70+ F. Also don't wear any clothes that you care about since the POR-15 is hardcore stuff and does not come out. It also likes temp above 70 when applying and curing."

beetle,2mid3q,Nintenzo,1 point,Sun Nov 16 23:59:11 2014 UTC,Double check all of your wires using a wiring diagram. Also make sure your bulbs are grounding correctly against the housing.
beetle,2mid3q,Unicornecstasy,1 point,Mon Nov 17 00:26:06 2014 UTC,The bulb grounding thing is important. It threw me for a loop a few times.
beetle,2mid3q,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Mon Nov 17 03:33:18 2014 UTC,"All right, how do I check this?"
beetle,2mid3q,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Mon Nov 17 15:39:16 2014 UTC,I twisted my bulbs in their sockets a few times to get them to come on. If it's too much of a hassle you can rough em up on the contact surfaces with steel wool or something. Just make sure you get it all off. Also make sure the little prongs they slide into have a tight enough grip.
beetle,2mid3q,windetch,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:56:07 2014 UTC,"What Unicorn said, check that they're seated right and have a good ground connection.  Mine only wanted to work in one particular position (slide the holders in and out).  Easy to double check though, just turn on the lights and test the power connection where it connects to the bulb with your multimeter.  If it has power it's a grounding / bulb issue.  If no power then that part of the light switch is probably dead -- it can still send power to the headlights while not powering the gauge lights. The gauge lights run directly from the switch, no fuse, so if something isn't quite right it'll blow the switch and/or the thin wire that runs to the bulbs."

If you actually want to make a near stock car then buy a new wiring harness and install it in a clean car, it will be way easier (in most cases) than trying to replace or remove the random shit previous owners put in.

Then I've done quite a bit of research in building the heads and cam according to the turbo specs, which I will be running 14lbs of boost.

I love working on stuff like this, so I would prefer to do it myself and I have no problem doing so.  I just need to gather some tools and knowledge before I do that though.

beetle,2lphk7,fatalifeaten,8,Sat Nov 8 22:03:41 2014 UTC,"Actually, the Muir book has a list of tool sets somewhere in the front that's honestly pretty good. There was like 3 levels (I'll have to reread it), but covered the tools you'd need to have in most everyday and emergency situations pretty well. I'd agree with /u/windetch that some of his ideas were a bit out there, but this one he was pretty sane on.  Windetch gave a pretty solid listing of what you'll need as well. I'd add in a few things I don't see mentioned already:   Flywheel lock Feeler gauges. Every 3k miles at the minimum you'll need them to adjust your valves. You'll also need them for things like gapping the spark plugs (they come close out of the box, but not perfect, so you need to gap them) Snap ring pliers (for axle shafts and fulcrum plates) Torque buddy like this For making sure you have the correct torque on your rear axle nuts and flywheel gland nut. (CRITICAL to get those torque specs right) I really like a motorcycle / ATV jack for working on a beetle at home as opposed to a floor jack, especially for pulling the motor. More stable, but not necessarily required. Timing light is a must-have. Here's an inexpensive one  That will get the job done. You need a timing light to correctly set the ignition timing on your engine in order to get the best performance and fuel economy out of it (and keep it from running hot / crappy and eating itself. Basic tune-up stuff. A good pair of wire cutters / strippers. Odds are you'll be working on the wiring. A big and small crescent wrench. These come in handy more often than you'd think. A good set of magnet parts trays like these. Losing nuts and bolts while you're working on your car sucks. Also a good telescoping magnet for getting said nuts and bolts when you do drop them. A couple of good pairs of gloves, and a big box of latex or neoprene disposables. Dial indicator like this. If you get into rebuilding your engine (and eventually you will), you'll want one of these babies for checking all kinds of precise tolerances. Various tubs, bins, and buckets for storing parts, tools, and things like oil changes Grease gun for chassis maintenance (front suspension, rear suspension especially) Cleaning supplies for your car, your workspace, and your bod. I like simple green for the car and the garage floor and fast orange brand for my hands and other fleshy bits. I'd suggest some coveralls too, you're gonna get filthy for a while as you jump in and tackle a 57 year old car's needs.   A bunch of these tools are things that will live in your garage, but many will also be things you keep in the car to cover roadside emergencies, so a decent tool box you can fit under the trunk or behind the seat will also be nice to have."
beetle,2lphk7,inserthumourousname,2,Sun Nov 9 04:21:33 2014 UTC,"Then perhaps the list had fallen out.  The copy I have of the Complieat Idiot guide is unfortunately quite old, and some pages are lost, including the index.  I will give it a closer look to find those lists though.  Thank you.  Also thank you for compiling a list of other tools."
beetle,2lphk7,windetch,7,Sun Nov 9 17:22:01 2014 UTC,"Wow, what a great looking beetle! Don't sell! I'd say buy your basic tools (socket set, spanners, wrenches, screwdrivers, car stands, a hydraulic jack) and then pick one job to do and if you need specific tools then buy them as you go. Then move on to the next job, again buy what you need for that job. In no time you'll have everything you need. You will find that most jobs can be done with the basic set though."
beetle,2lphk7,fatalifeaten,4,Sun Nov 9 00:10:33 2014 UTC,"Heck no, I'm not selling  That seems like a good idea; getting tools as I go along.  Perhaps that is the best course of action.  Time to hit up a hardware store.  Thank you!"
beetle,2lphk7,windetch,4,Sun Nov 9 03:16:15 2014 UTC,"Nice looking bug, congrats.  Gas tank being left full isn't necessarily a problem, drain it and see what you've got.  Tool wise, start with the standard socket and wrench sets. You (should) only need Metric for this project, but I'd get one of the SAE and Metric kits.  Craftsman, Husky, Kobalt, whichever. For the wrenches, I like the kits that roll up, helps keep them together.  The larger socket sets usually come in their own case.  Some of the socket sets will come with sparkplug tools, but if not there's only two or three common sizes and a lot of time they'll come in a pack.    Set of screwdrivers, various sizes.    Allen wrenches.  Vicegrips are nice to have, get a small and a large size.  You can get an electric impact wrench if you think you need one, but you can get by without. Use a proper torque wrench for putting things on and a cheater bar (length of pipe) for those that don't want to easily come off. Air compressors come labeled with the types of tools they support.    You'll want a solid pair of high-lift jack stands.  Buy as heavy-duty as you can find (within reason); I bought a normal high-lift pair but ended up borrowing my family's pair which is sized for a full-sized van.  Nice to keep the car as stable as possible when dropping the engine.  A low profile floor jack (like this).  Not one of the tiny ones, though if you want you can get a small bottle jack to keep in the car.  CostCo was carrying those red ones a little while back (Arcan?), not sure if they still do.  I got one and I like it.   Get a digital multimeter.  Doesn't have to be Fluke, even Walmart carries one in the automotive section that'll work.  Craftsman rebranded a few halfway decent ones as well.  Eventually you'll want a timing light, the digital ones with advance are neat.  If you're keeping the points a dwell meter is handy.    There's a few more tools you'll find out you needs as you go, depending on what part of the car you're tackling.  May have left out something, but that's some of the more common use stuff.  The Haynes isn't all that useful, and be careful relying solely on the Idiot's Guide (Muir has some odd ideas). You want the Bentley guide for your model year (link), there's one on Amazon for a few bucks cheaper.  Still pricey, but it's what you want.  Good luck and have fun."
beetle,2lphk7,max__power,2,Sat Nov 8 23:34:16 2014 UTC,"Thank you.  How high lift should the stands be?  There's a wide range of sizes about the internet.  What is a timing light and a dwell meter, or the points?  Google gave me a million different things and wasn't particularly useful.  I have never heard of such things or their uses.  If they're electrical things, I am going to keep it as original as possible, down to the 6V system, which some people ridicule me for.  Thank you for the information."
beetle,2lphk7,fatalifeaten,3,Sun Nov 9 03:22:11 2014 UTC,"I use 3 ton stands on my car. Way overkilll, but they get the pan up high enough to clear the engine when I need to drop it out."
beetle,2lphk7,fatalifeaten,2,Sun Nov 9 04:24:15 2014 UTC,"On the jack stands, this is one of the things you'll be doing - (link) You need enough height (and stability) to pull the engine out from under the rear apron.    Timing light is exactly what it sounds like, it helps you set the engine's timing -- which is crucial to how well the engine runs (the 'timing' of when the spark is delivered to each cylinder). Keeping her 6v is fine, you'll just need a spare 12v battery (or another car near by) to power the timing light.  I settled on this one (link), it'll tell you RPM as well.  Dwell meter helps you adjust the points, this is all old tech.  The points are in your distributor and tap along as the engine runs, sending current to the spark plugs at the appropriate time. I changed mine over to electronic ignition so I don't have to deal with them, but 's not a big deal."
beetle,2lphk7,WarCleric,2,Sun Nov 9 04:21:44 2014 UTC,"Excellent, I'll continue searching for some then.  While we are talking about dropping engines, what kind of Engine Dolly would you recommend so that I can get the engine safely from car to jack to engine mount?  Would any basic one work?  I know the engine is a tiny thing in this car, so I don't expect something over the top that's needed, but which one is a good one?  Between the million threads on TheSamba, I've seen equally many dollies.  Does it really matter which one I use? (Within reason of course)  I will have to read up on points and distributors more before I get into those.  Thank you for the information."

beetle,2lpm0r,Nintenzo,2,Sat Nov 8 22:24:23 2014 UTC,"They should. My dads bus is the highest of the Volkswagens in our club (mine is one of the lowest, funny that) and his have negative camber. It's so when you go round a corner your wheels don't go into positive camber under load, that would be very dangerous.    Edit: Best pic I could find online, you can just see the camber at the rear."
beetle,2lpm0r,Devduino,1 point,Sun Nov 9 11:22:11 2014 UTC,"Here's a quick picture explaining why it happens. Your gearbox and rear axle set up aren't an ""IRS"" set up like 1302/1303 Beetles and modern cars. (It does have independent rear suspension, we just don't call it that to distinguish between the two types.) Your rear setup is ""swing axle"". This means that instead of the axle pivoting at the gearbox and the wheel, it only pivots at the gearbox.   At stock height the point on the gearbox where the axles join it is slightly lower than where the axles join the spring plates. (The spring plates do the springy suspension work and control ride height.) this causes the top of the wheel to go in towards the car, giving slight negative camber.  See attached badly drawn picture.  If you really don't like negative camber you could raise the rear. This would make it more ""Cal"" look, already got the right wheels (see my friends cal look beetle), just gotta slam the front end!"
beetle,2lpm0r,Devduino,1 point,Sun Nov 9 11:59:47 2014 UTC,"Haha, it was already pretty low when I bought it. Didn't care for that look too much. I'm a sucker for stock. :P"

beetle,2lpm0r,Devduino,1 point,Tue Nov 11 13:56:40 2014 UTC,"Need a picture and which transmission type you have. Rob and Dave's site says IRS on the manual beetles started in 1969, but in autosticks in 1968. The 'start year' for changes can be a little misleading as some changes were mid year, but there's a good chance you have an IRS.  btw, congrats on tracking down the wiring issue. Glad it was something simple."
beetle,2lk9dk,darthandroid420,2,Fri Nov 7 08:03:35 2014 UTC,What advice do you need then?
beetle,2lk9dk,fastdub,2,Fri Nov 7 08:16:49 2014 UTC,Its my first bug i've done alot to it. Its my first body swap too. I guess i can lay out my plan and you can tell me if i'm crazy.  Sand and prep the shell for paint  Paint the shell  Paint the pan while its off and fix what rust i can.(side question: is riveting a decent solution for sections of floor pans?)  Swap the wiring haness  Windows and interior panels and what not.  Will i have to polarize the voltage regulator?  Hmm.....anybody know how to remove the windows(windshield and rears)?
beetle,2lk9dk,fastdub,2,Fri Nov 7 09:03:10 2014 UTC,"If I'm honest there's probably a decent YouTube channel to run you through it. I'll see if I can remember what I did tho.   I'm gonna assume you've unbolted and the fenders and bonnet bumpers etc.   Take out the petrol tank. Uncouple the steering column. Inclip and clamp the front brake lines. Unbolt the rear suspension from the body. Unbolt all bolt from the underside sills. Unbolt all bolts from the rear interior. Unbolt the larger bolts from the underside of the frame head(or thereabouts). If you're replacing the wiring loom just clip it and rip it out.   Stand inside your hopefully bare interior and rock and push the body up, sometimes the seal will have almost bonded the two together but it should come loose fairly easily.   You can lift the body off with a couple of chaps but best with three or four.   Window rubbers will almost certainly be a pita to get out and reuse so cut them out and bin them. If they have the chrome trim take care and salvage that.   Repair and prep. Do not rivet the pans together. Do things right the first time and you don't do them again.   Once the shell is off and bare I'd say getting it media blasted, but ask them to avoid the roof and the exposed rear quarter so they have no chance of warping.   Regarding the floorpan. Once you have the body shell off you'll see how simple it all is. Drop the engine and box out as one, and unbolt the front beam/brakes too. Then accept you're gonna replace everything on the pan but salvage what you can(honestly once its painted you won't wanna bolt on that scabby old master cylinder). It should take only a couple of hours to strip it bare and again get it media blasted. Pick a decent welder to replace what needs replacing obviously.   Once you've got that freshly repaired pan you won't believe how quickly things will start moving."
beetle,2ljrn7,Nintenzo,3,Fri Nov 7 04:14:14 2014 UTC,"So I'm going to assume you have a copy of the manual page, but here - [link]  You've got the turn signals, horn, brake lights, brake warning light, and the rear defogger (not an autostick right?) on that circuit.  One of those isn't happy.    How's the rest of the wiring?  Standard VW mouse-nest or is there evidence of severe PO hackery? What, if anything, have you changed recently?  When you say 'random amount of time' do you mean min, hours, days, or weeks between fuses blowing? The shorter the amount of time the easier it is to diagnose.    Try each of the above to make sure they're functional with a new fuse (turn signals etc) then disconnect what you can live without. To begin with, I'd nuke the horn, rear defogger, and fuel gauge (if that's indeed on this circuit). You know roughly how long you can go between blowing fuses, if you drive it a while and the fuse is intact start hooking things back up in order of preference.  Lather, rinse, repeat. Once it blows you know where to look. If it blows with just the brake lights and turn signals, eh.  If you're comfortable driving without turn signals that's one way to isolate the problem.  Random shorts suck as they're the hardest to track down.  Could be where some insulation got rubbed off a wire and it's shorting out, or the old wiring is breaking down and shorting."
beetle,2ljrn7,windetch,1 point,Fri Nov 7 05:04:41 2014 UTC,"It's not an autostick, but I'm pretty sure it was at one point because I can see a faint ""Stickshift"" outline on the deck lid. :P  Rear defogger doesn't work. The wiring is a rat's nest for sure, random shit not connected, all tangled to hell, the usual. Haven't changed a thing on it.   Anywhere from minutes to days. I've replaced it 3 times now. Last time I replaced it, which was yesterday, I was literally backing out of my driveway and it blew.   Thanks for all the advice man! It really helps a noob out.

beetle,2ljrn7,spuliafi,1 point,Fri Nov 7 04:36:41 2014 UTC,"Had this issue too, but with the fuse for my radio. Ended up being that the wires were just so haphazardly put together by the shop that when you were driving and hit some rough terrain, the wire would bounce and hit something and ground out. So it could be as simple as that. Alternatively, (because I was 17 and oblivious at the time) I just bought boatloads of fuses for a couple bucks and just replaced them over and over again."

I looked at a 66 bug for sale with fiberglass in the heaterchannels and the guy said that was normal and done by the PO.  I just agreed and walked away.

beetle,2l73ap,windetch,2,Thu Nov 13 18:14:40 2014 UTC,"With regards to your other question, Bugs are fairly good cars to learn on (was the goal with mine as well). No computers, no fancy vacuum line stuff, and an engine that's light enough to be easily dropped (it's held in by 4 bolts).  Not to mention that, because so many were made, parts are easy to come by for reasonable cost -- both used and aftermarket. 's also why the price isn't too bad compared to some of the other cars from that era (that, and they were economy cars even when new).  I'd aim for a solid late-model (1968+); they run a little cheaper, have a few nice safety upgrades, and a peppier engine (1971+ 1600cc DP engines are nice). The early models are more collectable with corresponding price tags, but if that's what you're looking for by all means.  If you don't have one in mind yet, use roadhaus.com to see if you can find a local aircooled shop. Check out potential cars, then if you're happy with one let them look it over, they'll know what to look for."

beetle,2l73ap,khartster,1 point,Mon Nov 3 21:45:04 2014 UTC,So do you feel 7k is reasonable in expecting one with No Rust and zero bodywork needed? or is that probably a dream...
beetle,2l73ap,WarCleric,2,Mon Nov 3 21:45:44 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't guarantee every car in that price range is legit but I'd guess a majority of them. Maybe find a mechanic who you trust and ask if he would mind taking a look. Usually 100 bucks but adds piece of mind. Just tell the mechanic what you expect and hell take a look at the car. Receipts can go a long way so see if the seller has the the recent service records, brakes, oil change, etc.  Look up main rust areas with vw bugs and that'll be a start there will be a reason why they are the common areas for rust. Usually its around the heater channels into the bug (back end by the rear shocks and upfront under the gas tank. There are some plates that thed to hold water. Just angle out the tire on one side and take a flashlight."
beetle,2l73ap,Cookaacoo,1 point,Tue Nov 4 00:02:50 2014 UTC,Very year dependant. A 65-67 7k is going to get you a nice bug. After that the quality should increase dramatically for 7k. Before that the quality will decrease dramatically.

beetle,2l4vll,winewagens,1 point,Mon Nov 3 07:16:20 2014 UTC,"Brake fluid will also inhibit new paint from sticking, so don't use it for removal.  I kind of like wire wheels for paint removal."

beetle,2l4vll,winewagens,1 point,Mon Nov 3 19:18:33 2014 UTC,"There are two kinds of flap wheels. One is a disk with flaps of sandpaper tight against each other. I use then for gentle grinding. As the paper wears away, fresh paper is exposed. The other is more of a wheel of sandpaper strips attached radially. I've never used one, but I'd expect them to be pretty gentle on the metal, only removing paint.  Edit: I guess the distinction is flap disk vs flap wheel.  Flap disk used for grinding  Flap wheel"

beetle,2l4vll,memberzs,1 point,Sun Nov 16 03:53:50 2014 UTC,I second the sander.  The entirety of my '73 Super had the paint removed by a dual action sander. Takes time but it lets you get familiar with the metal under the paint.

beetle,2l23lu,jdonnel,1 point,Mon Nov 3 09:20:20 2014 UTC,"It sounds like its running hot, which would cause higher than normal cylinder head temps (not that the air cooled cylinder head doesn't already run hot) which causes detonation of the fuel by heat instead of the spark plug. This would be caused by retarded timing, or lean fuel mix. I assume that you have a 30/31 pict, I would start by turning the volume screw (small one) out a half to a full turn and see if that helps. Better to run a bit rich than lean, I usually try to have a small puff of black smoke from the exhaust when I hit a rev, but not all the way through the rev of the engine.   Check your timing, I understand you set it, but check it again. I set my timing using a timing light, somewhere around 30* BTDC (between 28-32). Others maintain that you should set it with a test light, putting it to fire at TDC with the engine off. Both should get you very close in the ball park.   Another thing you can try is looking for intake leaks. Spray some starter fluid around all the seals of the carburetor, as well as where the intake meets the ports on the cylinder heads, listen for any change in the idle of the engine. That would cause a lean spike and over heating.   Hope this helps!"

beetle,2ksmqf,beatleshelp1,3,Thu Oct 30 16:37:32 2014 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, the tl:dr version appears to be: ""Took new-to-me bug to an aircooled mechanic, he didn't like the way the radio was wired and put a switch on the constant 12v side.  Why?""  First, your bug originally came with a very simple analog radio with one speaker.  This radio only had one power connection, a ground, the speaker wires, and the antenna.  That's it, none of the gigantic harness a modern radio comes with.  The main difference (for this purpose) with a modern radio (which I assume this is) is it needs both a constant 12v and switched power. Switched power turns on the radio with the key, the constant power keeps your presets and time.  Your mechanic is probably worried the constant power connection to your radio could drain the battery.  It won't, in any appreciable manner (very low current draw when off).  All digital radios are wired like this or the time and preset stations wouldn't stay set.     Generator wise, eh.  That's a power question, answered by what exactly is in your car.  If you have four speakers and a sub you're probably asking too much from your gen.  Two speakers you're likely okay.    A generator puts out 30 or 38A, an alternator 55 - 95A Wattage is V*A, so a 100W amp would require 7A at 14V -- that's on top of whatever the car needs.  btw, your '74 originally had an engine with an alternator.  It's not at all uncommon for a car to have a replacement engine, but make sure you know what you have gen vs alt."
beetle,2ksmqf,windetch,1 point,Thu Oct 30 19:03:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and the tl;dr, probably should have done that myself. He put the switch on the ignition side and wired that into the constant. The car already had a modern ISO connector (I believe a previous modern radio had been stolen) but the ignition pin was connected to the constant.  It's the original engine so that was bad wording in my question and would be an alternator. It's only two speakers in the back and the stereo claims 4 x 50w outputs. I presume this would mean 100w being drawn with two speakers connected? If so thank you very much indeed for your help and I will get on with enjoying the bug.  EDIT: Just checked the manual for the stereo and input is max 10A at 14.4V, sounds like it should be fine. Thanks again :)"

There were a few times however where I had to pull up the back seat and either replace a fuse back there or reattach a wire. My car was 'restored' but they just kind of connected wires anywhere and everywhere, but even so, this diagram helped me tons:  Wiring Diagram  As far as the gas gauge, same thing. Sometimes it would fill up to half or 3/4 full even though I topped up the tank to 100%, and other times, no read at all. I had asked on the Samba but they all seemed to say that the sensor or float might be faulty so I'd have to take it to a specialty shop to have the tank taken out and washed etc etc. or I could just live with it. I ended up just living with it, but I think something could've been done at home.   Sorry if this doesn't help much, and I hope the problem gets squared away!

Pic of my test setup - http://i.imgur.com/2RdAAnF.png EL Wire doesn't get hot, always stays cool.  Very simple stuff, lasts a long time.  It's a little tricky to solder (check youtube for videos) but 's not too bad.  I got mine from Adafruit (search their EL Wire section).  Funny enough, I think I just burnt up my inverter. Took it on about an hourish drive at night (during which it did fine), the next time I tried it it sorta flickered then went out.  It's fuse (inline, only thing on that line) was blown and the plastic case was a little melty.  New fuse, it still doesn't work. It did have a voltage regulator protecting it, but /shrug.

The cable [link] then goes from the speedometer down through a hole in the body (need a new grommet?  [link]) then through the back of the wheel (second grommet [link]) and the end of the cable locks into the hole in the grease cap.  When the wheel turns the square hole in the greasecap turns the cable, giving you speed and odometer readings.  btw, your GPS will give you more accurate speed measurements, but the speedometers tend to be good enough."

beetle,2k4w6l,fatalifeaten,2,Fri Oct 24 01:59:20 2014 UTC,"In most cases, the seals fail, not the cooler. Or the wrong seals are used for the cooler installed. There are several differences depending on the case you're using and the cooler you're using, so if you get it wrong, leak city. Early cases had an 8mm passage for the cooler, and later cases had a 10mm. Seals are cheap, buy a set of 8mm, a set of 10mm, and the 8-to-10 adapter seals (they're green). Then you're covered no matter what for about 8 bucks.  Unless you can see some obvious damage I'd bet on seals. A new cooler is about 80 bucks, so you can replace the whole ball of wax and know it's done. I guess it depends on what your time is worth to you if you get it wrong the first time and have to tear down again.  FWIW, in 20+ years, the only time I've seen a cooler blow was due to foreign object damage (fan exploding in the shroud, something gets sucked in and punches through the cooler, etc...) It's always the seals that let go first, they're the weak link in the pressure chain (by design)"

beetle,2jr6kc,spuliafi,1 point,Mon Oct 20 15:39:42 2014 UTC,it's eerie how closely your damage resembled the one on my '69. We just replaced the hood and a body shop pulled out the right fender (although it wasn't quite as bent up) Is all the electrical OK? In the end it cost something like $1500 to match the paint and pull out the fender and the bonnet (slightly) as well as a tune-up.

beetle,2jqdwc,mist91,1 point,Sun Oct 19 23:00:41 2014 UTC,"One option is to check the aircooled parts suppliers and see what year ranges they list for a part.  For your example, this outer door handle will fit 1968 - 1979 Bugs (ww link).  So...  probably.  Problem you may run into is transition years.  Sometimes VW changed parts around mid-year, so an early '68 and a late '68 may not have had the same door handle.  Some of the differences are mainly cosmetic, others it just won't work."
beetle,2jqdwc,windetch,1 point,Mon Oct 20 02:54:30 2014 UTC,"There's an engine interchange manual   For other things you will have to check parts catalogs, thesamba, and the archived copies of Progressive Refinements.    Supers and standards are essentially identical from the A pillar back, thus the doors can interchange.    67s are one year only handles.   Doors can interchange as well, though early 60s ones and later 60s/70s ones have different locking/latching mechanisms and are more involved for a swap over.  68+ outer door handles are the same."
beetle,2jqdwc,winewagens,1 point,Mon Oct 20 02:59:58 2014 UTC,"If suggest reading the archives on thesamba.com. And learning the year groups and major changes.  Like 58-64,65-66,67,68-74ish.  There are changes within those year groups but knowing generally what years had major changes helps."

beetle,2jp8g5,richcreations,2,Sun Oct 19 21:07:59 2014 UTC,"A vacuum leak can cause the engine to run lean, to check, get some carb cleaner or such and with the engine running spray a bit near where the carb meets the manifold, the manifold boots, and the heads where the manifolds attach, if there is a leak, you will notice a slight rpm difference when you spray the spot, as the liquid will seal the leak/add fuel.  timing issues could also cause this.

Salt is the biggest Beetle killer, and it WILL destroy your car. Realistically, there is no such thing as complete protection against salt, you would merely delay the inevitable.  It's a shame, really, 'cause Beetles are said to be quite fun to drive and to have a noticeable advantage as opposed to FWD vehicles in snowy (unsalted) conditions.  I live in Vienna, Austria, where they also use way too much salt as soon as a single snowflake dares to fall on the road. My Beetle is always parked outside (I live in the city center) and that's already quite bad for the car, because other cars going by spray all the salty grime onto and under the body. But believe me, actually driving it in those conditions is much, much worse."
beetle,2jg88s,dagovix,2,Fri Oct 17 06:55:09 2014 UTC,"With regards to your edit on heat, /shrug.  Looks like you've got a '69, which will be the same setup as my '70.  There's a few pieces that have to work right, any one of them failing means no heat.   I'll start at the back and work forwards then. Engine first, you need to have a factory muffler, heaterboxes, and those two big tubes that go from the fan shroud to the base tin.  Quick image to demonstrate air flow - (linky)  From the fan through the tube into the heaterboxes and then out to the car.  If your heaterboxes are in good shape and your engine seals are all installed you shouldn't get any exhaust smell in the car, maybe just a little; the air to heat the car is kept separate from the exhaust air. You must have working linkages to the flaps on the front of the heaterboxes, the control arm is by the parking brake, passenger side iirc.  When you pull the lever up it opens the flaps on the heaterboxes allowing hot air to flow into the car. From there there's two tubes that connect the heaterboxes to a Y junction under the back seat.  This is what the second lever beside the parking brake is for, controls if air gets sent under the back seat or pipped up to the front.  Check for any air flow here as it's the closest to your engine.  Now the heater channels...  oh, the heater channels.  If your car has always been a northern car they may not be in good shape.  Here's a picture of the pipe that runs inside - (pic #2).  If this is rusted you'll lose most of your heat.   If air successfully reaches the front of the car it can come out the base vent by the driver's feet or be sent up to the defrost vents.  Defrost vents are a whole 'nother topic (image c).  ...That ended up being a little longer than I intended, was hoping to just distill down to the basics.  Here's two more in depth analysis of the Beetle's heating system - (Rob and Dave's site, Paul's post on theSamba)  You'll hear a lot about how terrible the Beetle's heat is, but if the system is working properly it's really not that bad."

Spray on undercoating you can get away with a little less prep and might help resist the salt.  There's mixed opinions on undercoating, but if you clean the bottom of the car and make sure you're not just coating over any serious rust it'll probably help.  My car came with old, flaking off undercoating and under the flakes was clean metal (bottom of the tunnel was in excellent shape due to it, floor pans rusted from the inside out). So when I replaced the floor pans just recently I started by coating each side with POR15 and gave the bottom a good coating of 3M undercoating.  Took about four cans to fully cover the underside (pic) The inside got a coat of Rustoleum truck bedliner spray (pic)  Michigan winters are just rough on cars.  My grandparents lived up by Huron and we visited yearly, so many rusted cars.  So many.  But then, I probably don't need to tell you that do I?  :P Getting a cheap winter beater would be kindest for your bug, but /shrug.    Keep it clean and drive safe. Hope you've got the heat working"

As for heat for the windshield, if you are going electric make sure you use new wires from the battery and put in the proper size fuse. If you try running high current on the stock wiring you are likely going to have a fire (I did but I had an extinguisher on hand).  I am doing a subaru swap and so, will add a heater core."

beetle,2j7vkk,fatalifeaten,1 point,Tue Oct 14 15:47:39 2014 UTC,Thanks but I think those are way too small. :D I'm looking to have the tires all be around the same size.
beetle,2j7vkk,Devduino,1 point,Tue Oct 14 16:15:25 2014 UTC,You can't get the same width on front and back as your wheels are different widths. Go to your local mechanic with your wheel widths and your desired sidewall height and they can recommend a set that will give you the same sidewall height front and back. fitting a 185 width tyre on a thin wheel is dangerous and will look stupid.
beetle,2j7vkk,Dreamscarred,1 point,Tue Oct 14 17:04:30 2014 UTC,Mine has a set of 195/60 R15 under it right now the previous owner put on.  [I'm not entirely sure if it'll fit in the well for the spare tire though.]

beetle,2j6kt3,14_year_old_girl,1 point,Wed Oct 15 00:22:48 2014 UTC,"Depends on what sized card and what quality you have it set at.  This one records at 15,000kbps max (specs), so a 32GB micro sd card would hold about 4.75 hours ish of video (think I did that right).  When the card fills up the camera just loops, deletes the oldest file and carries on. Can set the camera to record in 1, 3, or 5 min time chunks (keeps the file size reasonable), I left mine at 3."

beetle,2igdek,DoubleHawk4Life,4,Mon Oct 6 15:25:26 2014 UTC,"My Beetle had one on it when I bought it.  Basically, in order to to move the shifter left and towards the rear to reach the reverse gear, you pull the T-handle up. You can pull it whenever you like, but the only effect it has is on getting into reverse.   More or less, it eliminates the need to push the shifter down before moving it left and back. You just pull the T-handle instead.   Hope that helps."
beetle,2igdek,lbs_ft,2,Mon Oct 6 15:47:28 2014 UTC,"This. Normally when you select reverse, you have to push the stick down (in) and then select reverse. If you're shifting hard or your rod or bushings are sloppy, you can accidentally shift into reverse when going for second with a stock shifter. The T-handle shifter has an actuator that does the ""push down"" part. I've got one in my '66, and after going at it with a dremel to deburr the ball when I first got it (the casting was really rough, and it made for a grinding feel when shifting) I've loved it. Solid, short throw shifts, and no unexpected trips into reverse in traffic."

beetle,2igdek,richcreations,1 point,Mon Oct 6 18:18:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I gotcha. I figure if it's already on the car and it's not a total piece of shit, I might as well figure out what that goddamn 2nd handle is for, haha."
beetle,2igdek,jbrandt01,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:05:56 2014 UTC,"Mine was a very recent one and most likely was the victim of cheap manufacturing.  You might luck out and have an older and higher quality one. The design is solid, when it worked it was great.  There is a pin that acts as the reverse lockout mechanism.  Mine was pressed in and somehow managed to work its way out and basically trying to shift in 2nd would land you in reverse.  The trans won't actually engage, but missed shifts on an engine with a hot cam mean you'll be on the wrong side redline in a hurry."
beetle,2igdek,richcreations,1 point,Tue Oct 7 22:44:30 2014 UTC,"This is a really good reason for an MSD box (with rev limiter), missed shifts should not happen, but they prob will happen now and again.

You'll find out pretty quick how well it's going to work.  I do have a suggestion for a relatively cheap, not too too kludgey audio solution.  Buy a small amp and a pair of cheap speakers, will run you ~$50, here's the pair I chose - (amp, speakers) You can then play music off your mp3 player, phone, or whatever. In the future, if you get a replacement radio with amp-out you can hook it in and roll.  Mounted my amp under the dash for ease of access to the input ports.  Speakers are in front of the back seats pointing forward.  Couldn't find any kickpanels I liked so that's where they are, works alright.

One option is to run a new positive wire from the voltage regulator up to the trunk.  Use an inline fuse and you're good to go, power whatever you want without poking the original (or not-so-original) harness.  Ground is your chassis, pick a mounting bolt, throw a ring terminal thing on it, and tada.  's what I did for my gauges, amp, radio, electric fuel pump, and cigarette lighter.

The most absurd thing I've ever done is swap an old '57 body onto a '72 chassis all in one weekend. The poor old gal had been in a front end collision. Daily driver that was sorely needed on Monday, so we burnt the midnight oil there.  Cheap n dirty trick, and the thing handled much better with more modern suspension under it, but oh crap, never again, not in 2 days. I think we never did get the front pan bolts to thread in tight. o0 I miss that old jalopy.  Had a lot of help for that one, about 5 friends and plenty of pharmaceuticals. :)  Sounds like you guys did stuff up right though, and for FUN, not necessity.

Tell me you had drop spindles up front instead of hacking the tension bar in to pieces. ;)  And we'd have done serious crimes to get our hands on that carb setup! (homer simson level drool here too)  Had a custom built 2Liter with racing cams, special pistons, crazy compression, trick headers, extra oil cooler, the works... all on pretty bog-standard single carb system. haha What a waste. It was still snappy as hell though!  That thing didn't live very long. Didn't help that he ran it with like 30° of advance the first weeks 0o  Showed him the aluminum flakes in the oil and we re-tuned it. Kinda a disaster and waste of money, but all good fun and a learning experience. Holy shit was that thing fun to sling round corners! Huge go-cart, basically.   Those old VW's are such a dream to work on. Can yank the motor out in an hour, throw it on a skateboard and roll it through the apartment into the back yard. bahahah  shhhhh! don't do this during the day when the manager is awake. I'm sure she was wise to us really, we did that so often it woulda been hard NOT to notice, and everyone knew there was mad science going on. Good times.

beetle,2i7caf,Terminal-Psychosis,6,Sat Oct 4 19:47:29 2014 UTC,"Volkswagen Kübelwagen:       The Volkswagen Kübelwagen (literally translated as ""bucket car"", for its resemblance to a metal bathtub on wheels  ) was a light military vehicle designed by Ferdinand Porsche and built by Volkswagen during World War II for use by the German military (both Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS). Based heavily on the Volkswagen Beetle, it was prototyped as the Type 62, but eventually became known internally as the Type 82.  Kübelwagen is an abbreviation of kubelsitzwagen, meaning ""bucket-seat car"" because all German light military vehicles that had no doors were fitted with bucket seats to prevent passengers from falling out.  The first VW test vehicles had no doors and were therefore fitted with bucket seats and so acquired the name VW kubelsitzwagen that was later shortened to kubelwagen. Mercedes, Opel and Tatra also built kubel(sitz) wagens.   With its rolling chassis and mechanics built at Stadt des KdF-Wagens (renamed Wolfsburg after 1945), and its body built by US-owned firm Ambi Budd Presswerke in Berlin,  the Kübelwagen was for the Germans, what the jeep was for the Allies.

beetle,2i07x1,Whoviantattoo,2,Wed Oct 1 16:59:46 2014 UTC,"You're looking in the right place, geographically speaking. Dry, desert cars will have minimal rust and less body rot than cars in other parts of the country. For a first, I'd look '69-'71 standard (not super beetle) They're more commonly available, so a 5-6k earlier model car will run you 3500-4500 in that date range for a comparable condition car. You're also not cutting up or otherwise molesting an older car while you learn and potentially make mistakes with your first bug. That means more money to throw at it to really make it your own. If you can fix a lawnmower, you can wrench on a bug (except maybe a transmission, they're a bit more complex than most non-specialist mechanics want to tackle).   I would avoid supers as a first bug at all costs. The sheet metal costs more, the suspension components cost more, the curved glass of the windshield costs more, the front suspension is notoriously finicky (google super beetle death wobble), and that classic beetle body line is blurred in the super beetle (my opinion, on that last, mileage varies)."

Honest question."
beetle,2i07x1,tcruarceri,1 point,Thu Oct 2 14:13:04 2014 UTC,"not an expert here but...id buy a 70+ standard with an irs with a straight body and as good of brakes as you can for as cheap as possible. Things worth paying extra for would be working disk brakes, well tuned motor, good tires.  Supers are nice for the more comfy suspension but limit your choices in the long run.  If you decide to go volksrod, baja or heavily customized it will be easier with the standard beetles front end.  with a 70+ you can swap in a bus tranny easier if power is on your mind."
beetle,2i07x1,windetch,1 point,Fri Oct 3 12:51:02 2014 UTC,"Sure, collector-wise the older the bug the better. It's unusual to find a bug with it's original engine.  They just need the occasional rebuild, or shit happens and the engine gets swapped out.  Four bolts and out comes the engine. Agreed though, focus on the body.  Rust free 's the way to be.    If you just want a car you can play with, get a late model.  1968+ You'll get really nice improvements like a collapsible steering column that won't spear you in a collision.  Depending what you're doing with it, IRS is generally a nicer transmission type.  Starting in 1971 the 1600cc DP engines are decently peppy, you're going to find the early model engines to be a bit anemic.     Supers are a matter of preference, they're a bit fatter than the Standards appearance wise but the front end handles better.  From the front door pillar back though they're the same as the Standard.  On the plus side, Supers tend to be shunned by the collectors so you can find very decent ones for not too much cash.    But yeah.  It really depends on what you're looking for. If you want a collectable show piece, go for the old. If you want something to play with and drive go with the late models."

Quite honestly i don't think it makes a blind bit of difference if someone does or doesn't cut their dash though, it's their car at the end of the day and i'd sure as shit rather see them happy with it and using it (butchered dash and all!) than for it to sit in their garage as some kind of museum piece.

Modify as you wish, but try to do so in a way that does not preclude later restoration.  EDIT: I drive a heavily modified '66, but I did not do anything that can not be un-done later...

By all means, keep them in as good a shape as possible but don't let it become a museum piece, at least not while you own it. There's so much more enjoyment to be gotten out of a bug by having adventures in it than by admiring it from afar. In my opinion at least.   To be honest, i don't really mind what anyone does with their bug, it's totally up to them. I just know what i want out of mine so i'll make the necessary modifications to get that out of it."

beetle,2hs382,Kpayne78,1 point,Mon Sep 29 16:56:11 2014 UTC,"Well the factory systems do have a separate, external gps antenna. GPS systems generally need a clear view of the sky to work and recessed into the dash isn't ideal for signal strength.  If you use a window-mount Garmin (etc) then you don't have that worry, though it may lose signal if you hold it in your lap.  Does your bug have a cigarette lighter to charge it with? It was a dealer-installed option, but you can find them either in theSamba's classifies or wolfsburgwest, cip, etc carry them.  Easy install."

Car does appear to have issues with the fuel system, solvable but just fyi.  The Plastidip would be a drawback for me, would have to take the time and effort to peel it all off.  Depending how it was done, Plastidip can peel right off or you'll end up taking it off bit by bit. If you like it, hey.  Bonus, and to each 'is own. Note that since parts of the body have been filled in (fender indicator mounting holes, rear bumper holes) you may be looking at a repaint should you remove the Plastidip; also, who knows what condition the paint under it is in.  If it's rust free 's still not a bad deal, esp since the engine was rebuilt 36km ago.  Most of the visible downsides can be fairly easy remedied (steering wheel, missing door panel, missing radio).  Fender-mounted indicators, tail lights, and bumpers would be on my list as well, but I just like stock.  Here's a short buyer's guide for supers, but really rust is the major thing.  Look for it everywhere, crawl under it with a flashlight and look around."

I seriously thought about getting a new battery pack for it, but eh...  12 lead acid batteries adds up, and would only get me a range of 20 miles (give or take).  A LiPo pack will get you a decent distance, but expensive."

beetle,2hjia4,dagovix,3,Sat Sep 27 01:02:27 2014 UTC,"Basically, yep.  In all fairness though, the guy who did it didn't hack the car at all. The generator cradle was mounted in the gastank hole using the tank's mounting screws.  Popped that out and the new tank plopped right in.  He repurposed a few wires, but left the majority alone -- the old voltage regulator was still hanging out under the seat (well, where there would have been a seat).  I did miss one of his stray bolts in the engine compartment (it was just there, not sure why, but it was) and it wore a hole through a brand new engine seal.    But otherwise, really, no harm no foul. I don't mind at all that he did a somewhat... unusual conversion.  The unfixableness of it all was what got me the car for free!"

If you're happy with the price quoted (assuming you've done your research), have your friend take their camera (phone camera is okay, as long as it has a flash) and a flashlight and go look at it for you.  They get to go rust hunting; it's a nearly 50y/o VA car, it's rather likely to have some.  Question is how much and where. Ask them to peek under the carpets as able, under the battery (which is under the back seat), the luggage area, floorpans. Look under the car for the same, under the doors, check the heaterchannels that run along the edge of the car. Engine wise, /shrug.  Could ask said friend to take a video of it running.  Can (s)he drive stick?  If so, test drive!  Even non-car people should be able to tell if something is amiss.  If not stick-capable, ask them to go with the owner on a test drive.  If it shifts cleanly between gears with no crunching or growling the transmission should be fine.  If the engine runs and the owner has kept up on maintenance then that's about all you can ask for.   Alternatively (or in addition), if you want to make it as easy as possible for your friend, find a local automotive shop that'll do aircooled vw's (check roadhaus if you don't have one in mind).  Call the shop, ask how much they'd charge, and schedule a time for your friend to take the car."

As for the price, a friend I made on /r/beetle made the point that either way, I'm looking at an investment of around 10k for what I'm looking for: a dependable daily that looks/sounds great, and that I can baby the shit out of. If I buy a 4k car, I'll end up spending around 6k to get it to where I want it, so why not cut the cost now?

I had a similar issue and it turned out to be crimped lines that ran to the back wheels. This created a pressure problem and occasionally would allow me to put my foot to the floor with no brake pressure applied to the wheels. Other times two quick taps on the break and then it was ""normal"". I bled the breaks and all seemed normal, but then it happened again so I had a break guy look at it. He found the crimped lines. He replaced them with metal lines and I haven't had that problem return."

Not the best, but def. workable, car doesn't weigh much.   May try another pass at bleeding the brakes, make absolutely sure you've got all the air out of the system.  Did you follow something similar to - http://www.vw-resource.com/bleed2.html, or were you using one of the pressure bleeder things?"
beetle,2h9ub5,windetch,3,Wed Sep 24 00:10:24 2014 UTC,"Good working stock brakes work fine, and while they don't have the feel of modern power brakes, they should be able to lock up all 4 wheels. The only issue with drums is as they heat up, they tend to fade (become less effective). with a stock engine, our cars are too light/slow for it to be an issue, unless you drive on some very long and steep hills.  I have 4-wheel disk on my '66, but mostly only because I also have 180HP of engine, and race my car on weekends (once your bug does 130+mph stock brakes start to be an issue)  EDIT: if you are used to driving modern cars, remember these cars have no power brake assist, which means you really have to push on the pedal (nothing to do with disks vs drums) find a parking lot, or other safe space, and try to lock them up, you may find they actual will.  People blame the issues with single circuit, manual brakes on the drums, hence drum brakes have a bad rap (yet they are still sold on new cars, at least on the rear, though with modern power boosted master cly, so you don't notice)"
beetle,2h9ub5,richcreations,1 point,Wed Sep 24 00:16:51 2014 UTC,"are still sold on new cars, at least on the rear,   That's because the front brakes do 80 percent of the work anyway. Even with 4 wheel disks, the front's do a lot more of the work and wear a lot faster."

beetle,2h9ub5,JMcFly,1 point,Sun Oct 26 21:55:19 2014 UTC,"I had a 73 super that I used to drag race and drive to school. It wasn't the fastest (by far) but I could run the 1/8th mile in 9 seconds at 65 MPH with full interior. I ran drum brakes til the day I sold it and they would lock up easily, so much so that I flat spotted both front tires after I rebuilt the brakes.   Personally I believe that on a stock car, drum brakes should be fine. I would look into bleeding them again, and then taking it out and really mashing on the brakes. The pedal should be quite firm and harden very fast; IE there shouldn't be much travel from top of the pedal til it becomes firm. If it feels spongy then you need to bleed again. Make note to check the lines running to the master cylinder. There may not be pressure on that side, but you could be allowing air into the master cylinder through a poorly connected or busted line, meaning no mater how many times you bleed the brakes you will always have air.   You may also want to sit in the car not running, and press the brake pedal and hold it. If it slowly falls all the way to the floor it could be an indication that your master cylinder is bad. Lucky for us a new Brazilian one can be had quite cheap.   Hope my advice helps! Keep on dubbin champ!"

beetle,2h9ub5,funkmachine7,-5,Sun Nov 23 13:25:29 2014 UTC,Very bad. Most VWs I've seen with drums in the front have to park in gear because the parking brake doesn't hold (I personally don't know the exact reason)  I would highly recommend upgrading to disc brakes.
beetle,2h9ub5,Dick_Whiskey_,5,Wed Sep 24 00:06:21 2014 UTC,"that is an easy adjustment to the cables at the e-brake handle (under the rubber boot), drums hold fine, and disks won't even fix this issue (cables would still need adjusted)"

beetle,2h9ub5,richcreations,3,Wed Sep 24 02:32:59 2014 UTC,"The only reason the parking brake wouldn't hold is that the cables are not adjusted correctly. This also has nothing to do with normal braking since normal braking is hydraulic, not mechanical."
beetle,2h9mit,Creampioneer,7,Tue Sep 23 21:21:15 2014 UTC,"I had this problem when i was at the early stages of my pan off resto. There are several ways people say to fix it such as removing the hinge pins to bore the holes to a larger size and put in an over sized hinge pin, putting a jack under the door with some sort of pad and jacking it up, adjusting the latch plates( this does little to nothing but can fix very minor sag), and finally what seems to be the most professional way to do it is precision door alignment http://www.hotvws.com/content.php?contentID=73 . I ended up following the linked guide and  made alot of progress, (this was mid restoration so there was no carpet or wheels in the way). It ended up making a huge difference but it still was not enough as when i opened my doors they would still sag down and be hard to close. I hate to admit it because it cant be good for the car but i ended up fully extending the door going to the out most corner and lifting it for 10ish seconds, that ended up making the finishing touches i needed and now my doors close pretty well. Where your door is rubbing on the sill when you try to reclose it will need a different remedy and id be happy to help you with anything else if you have any more questions about it."

So I'm really just trying to get the car back in working order to sell her. Removing the body is unfortunately out of reach for me.  I'm trying to weight how much work is worth improving the value. 'As-is' I'm thinking I'd get about a $1k. Running, the max I would probably get is $2k. So how much time and parts should I spend on her to get a return. I could throw cash at her and spend months restoring her and only end up getting $1-2k more when I sell it.  EDIT: Wow, maybe they're worth a bit more now after looking at TheSamba.

So the hood has a large dent in it (from someone jumping on it) and someone keyed the right rear panel.   So part of me is saying do some work (although I'm not physically able to do a large job like remove the body). The other part of me is saying just do minimal work to sell her and stop having it be a sore spot in my mind and get the cash to help with medical bills.  The tough thing is the engine was very recently rebuilt and she WAS running amazing. But with the body damage and the lack of running for a few years, I don't know how much effort I should put into it.  Thanks for any input you have."
beetle,2h62yz,windetch,2,Tue Sep 23 03:23:48 2014 UTC,"Careful how much you put in it if your plans are to immediately sell it.    For instance, if the tires hold air and look fairly decent, leave 'em.  By all means mention to the buyer you think they should be replaced, but you're probably looking at, what, at least $400 between tires and install fees.  And the new owner may want something different than what you put on anyways.  Battery is probably dead, they don't like being discharged for years. Some auto salvage yards sell used (but perfectly okay) batteries, may be worth looking at.  Just need something that'll fit under the rear seat.  With the fuel pump, sure.  It may have dried out and cracked the diagram, and if it leaks it could get gas into the oil, which really sucks.  Took me three oil changes (each a couple hundred miles apart) to get the smell out of mine when the fuel pump decided to crap out.  Oil change and drain the gas, definitely. I'd go by the autoparts store and get a length of 1/4"" hose, two clamps, and just cut / replace the hose between the gas tank and tunnel.  If you're feeling spendy throw a $5 Wix fuel filter under there. If you pull the passenger side tire it's fairly easy to access the bottom of the tank.  Otherwise, the tank is held in with four bolts. Or, just syphon the gas out of the tank with a hose and get what you can.  Fill with new and she'll be alright.  Consider pulling the sparkplugs and putting a small amount of oil into each cylinder, then gently turning the engine by hand for a few revolutions.  It'll smoke a bit when you first start it up, just let it run out.  Check your local craigslist (LA?) and see what people are listing their bugs for, then price from there. Edit - I would at least try to get her running again though, even if poorly.  Every step you take towards making her a running car opens up a new buying audience.  Very few people will buy a pile of parts, a few more will buy something that was running but isn't now, a lot of people will look at something that just needs a tune up, etc.  Best of luck with everything"

I have no connection to this company, but let me say that if you're using mechanical points in your distributor, replace them with the Pertronix Ignitor Ignition. I struggled for years with the points on my 69 before I wished up and got this. It didn't turn the motor into a super powerhouse, but it made it so I didn't have to struggle with setting the points any more.

beetle,2h03ga,windetch,1 point,Sun Sep 21 02:36:08 2014 UTC,"timing affects many things, and sometimes timing and fuel issues can seem like the other.   Setting the timing is not that hard, you will need the tools though, including a timing light (strobe) and a wrench. you should prob change points/condensor/cap/rotor as well, the points gap need to also be set, and needs to be kinda exact, this can be done with either feeler gauges (ok), or dwell meter (better).  you will need the specs it needs adjusted to (I won't be of help, as I have a heavily modified '66)  If you are not mechanically inclined, perhaps a shop is in order?"
beetle,2h03ga,windetch,1 point,Sun Sep 21 02:43:04 2014 UTC,"Well a shop is accessible but I wont to take that route until my bug isnt running, I really want to learn for myself also. I've checked out a few videos so I think I will take on adjusting the points/valves/timing real soon. Thanks for all your input, its a major help. any quick advice you can give me for this or a good start for set of tools I can purchase?"
beetle,2h03ga,richcreations,1 point,Sun Sep 21 02:50:43 2014 UTC,"I went with an Actron digital timing light, its a decent unit and reasonably priced.  It has a built in rpm meter which is helpful in setting the timing and it has the advance function (which you want). Careful with the ubercheap timing lights, some are decent but some won't give you an accurate reading.  Like, at all.  All you need for valves is a set of feeler gauges, and you should be checking them every oil change (ish) anyways.  Some do more, some do less; they're easy to check, and it can be rather bad if they get too tight.  With the posted issue, you may also need to up your idle speed just a touch.  Use an rpm gauge and set to ~800 - 900 rpm at idle. Consider getting an oil temp dipstick (save-my-bug, aircooled.net also carries one) to make sure you're not getting too hot."

(it may very well be the same size as above, I can't remember)"
beetle,2h03ga,Fweaka,1 point,Sun Sep 21 03:16:54 2014 UTC,How do you adjust the points with a tach dwell? I've always used a feeler gauge (now I have electronic ignition)
beetle,2h03ga,DoubleHawk4Life,1 point,Sun Sep 21 06:19:52 2014 UTC,"ok, so a dwell meter tells you how long the points are open at a time (degrees of rotation) you crank the motor with the distributer cap off, and adjust the points while doing so until the number on the meter is the same as the spec. and as it is measuring degrees and not a gap, it makes up for worn lobes in the dizzy.  feeler gauges will get you close, but with the dwell meter you get perfect, and points will last longer, as there will be much less arcing.  I also have electronic, and love it, Pertronix dizzy, and MSD box, make for happy spark, and almost no adjusting."
beetle,2h03ga,richcreations,1 point,Sun Sep 21 06:50:58 2014 UTC,"Oh OK. That's cool. I love the electronic ignition. I have had 3 condensers go out on me in 2 years. Being stuck in the side of the road sucks, so I bought the electronic ignition, never had a problem with it."

beetle,2h03ga,richcreations,1 point,Sun Sep 21 21:04:19 2014 UTC,It's a little box that sits in the bottom of your distributor. It eliminates your points and condenser. You no longer have to readjust points. It hooks up to your coil.
beetle,2h03ga,DoubleHawk4Life,1 point,Sun Sep 21 22:54:52 2014 UTC,Really? Just hooks up and you're good? The one I'm looking at is installed already obviously. Does one still require regular timing checks?
beetle,2h03ga,richcreations,2,Wed Sep 24 17:34:37 2014 UTC,"Takes about 10 min to install a pertronix module, it bolts into the same holes that the points used.  You won't ever have to mess with it, as for timing, it will only need adjusting as the distributer drive gears wear (very slow), vs points that cause timing drift as they wear (much faster).  Basically it means you will prob only have to adjust it a couple times in the life of the engine with electronic, vs all the time with points.  I have 40k miles on my engine with electronic ignition, have yet to have to adjust the timing after installing it."
beetle,2h03ga,nismowarrior,2,Wed Sep 24 17:57:36 2014 UTC,"Yes, always do regular timing checks. But there is no more points or condenser, so that stays perfectly tuned. :) hope that helped."

beetle,2gyk6r,richcreations,1 point,Sat Sep 20 17:26:18 2014 UTC,most likely the amp in your stereo died if all 4 speakers quit at the same time.

If it's a reasonably nice unit it may have the red/white rca jacks for an external amp hookup.  The left channel is completely out on my Alpine, but I'm using a cheap BOSS amp with the rca ports and it works fine.  If you're positive your speaker wires are in good shape that would be a cheaper solution to replacing the unit.    If you want to be sure it's the receiver, pick an easy to remove speaker, take it out and wire it directly to the back with a short wire.  Disconnect the other speakers,  if no sound then there's something wrong with the receiver.  If you get sound there's something up with the wiring.  ...that said, do make sure you didn't accidentally hit ""Mute"" or something."

The more work you put into the car (even if it's something non-vital like the stereo) the more it becomes your car, the more it becomes an extension of YOU.  Check the VW fuses. If not that, check the amplifier to see if it has any fuses, and if they're blown. If it comes down to it, borrow a friend's comparable amplifier, install it and see if that solves the problem (be warned though, whatever blew out yours might blow out theirs).  Get yourself a multi-meter and measure your voltages at every point you can. See where you're getting juice, and where you're not.  Keep you head up! Don't give up the ship!"
beetle,2gv3pv,Nintenzo,4,Fri Sep 19 14:33:37 2014 UTC,First thing is you need to figure out if this was lowered with drop spindles or an adjustable beam. If it's an adjustable beam you can use the adjusters to set whatever ride height you want. If it's spindles you'll need to swap back to stock height spindles.  Since these cars don't have a lot of adjustments when it comes to the front end I'd say your alignment is off and that's causing the tires to wear. Take it into an alignment shop and pay them the $100 to align it first. They'll tell you if they find anything weird/broken in there which will make your life easier.  How did you fix the speedo?
beetle,2gv3pv,DrCockenstein,2,Fri Sep 19 15:01:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I fixed the speedometer by lubing the hell out of it with lithium grease.    Also, I'm a complete noob with cars so how do I tell if it's drop spindles or not?"
beetle,2gv3pv,DrCockenstein,1 point,Fri Sep 19 15:12:01 2014 UTC,"See the bolts right in the middle of this beam here? Those are adjusters for an adjustable beam. If it has those it's on an adjustable beam, otherwise it's on spindles. If it's on an adjuster beam you might want to take it to a VW shop and have them set it up. If you're on spindles don't change them. They're expensive and spindles are the ""proper"" way to lower the car. The beam is a hack/el cheapo lower.  I figured the speedo itself was making the noise. These things are gear driven and do need to be lubed up every so often to kill the noise."
beetle,2gv3pv,HDTech9791,3,Fri Sep 19 15:29:25 2014 UTC,"Or it has spindles and an adjustable beam. His problem is alignment, counter steering a car that is pulling to one side is doing nothing but wearing tires! I don't know about beams being an el cheapo way to lower. My beam was more than my spindles by a long shot."
beetle,2gv3pv,DrCockenstein,0,Sat Sep 20 12:21:08 2014 UTC,"The beam is known as el cheapo because the good spindle/disc kit can be upwards of $800. Good beams are usually $500-$700 but then you have to deal with nonsense like caster shims and difference in steering geometry. Spindles keep everything under the car exactly the same and just lower the height of the car so unless you want to go 3""+ lower spindles are the better choice.  EDIT: I haven't actually owned a Bug in a good 4 years so prices could have gone nuts. I know steel prices went way up a few years ago and these parts do get more expensive now that Mexico doesn't make new Bugs.  EDIT 2: Since I'm being downvoted a CB Kit for 2 1/2"" dropped spindles and disc brakes kit is is $369 and it's bolt up and done. a new cheap adjuster beam is $300 and you still have to deal with shims, ball joint issues, tie rod issues, shock issues, and caster shims depending on how low you go. Unless you want to go 3"" or lower stick with the spindles. A lot of people think ""oh well I could spend $400 to go 2 1/2 and stop or I could spend $300 and go as low as I want"" and it's totally wrong. That's what I mean when I say el cheapo. It traps people who think they're getting a ""deal"" and they screw up the car."
beetle,2gv3pv,_moist_,2,Sat Sep 20 21:10:02 2014 UTC,You most likely need a pair of these  http://www.aircooledparts.com/CAMBER-ADJUSTERS.html
beetle,2gv3pv,richcreations,2,Sat Sep 20 10:41:41 2014 UTC,"I doubt your tire wear is from lowering, more likely worn ball joints/tie rods throwing your alignment off. I run 195/60/r15 up front."
beetle,2gv3pv,fatalifeaten,3,Fri Sep 19 22:36:38 2014 UTC,"This. If you're wearing on the inside only, your front tires have negative camber. You need to check your steering and suspension components for wear or improper alignment and have that corrected. Get the car's front end up on jackstands, and hold your tire at 12 and 6 o'clock. Wiggle in in and out (top to bottom) and check for slop. If there's excessive play, stuff is broken and you need to get it fixed. If it's pretty firm, then the odds are your alignment is wonky somehow and needs to be corrected. If you can do it, then do it, but if not, take it to a shop that has a good rep for aligning lowered cars and pay them to do it right. It's not generally the lowering the car that causes improper wear, it's the not having it aligned correctly after you lower it that gets you.  I run a 4"" narrowed adjustable beam, with drop spindles. I'm 2"" off the ground running 195/50x15's just like /u/richcreations does. I have zero issues with improper wear, and my car drives and handles better than it did at the stock suspension height. I'd respectfully disagree on a beam being an ""el cheapo"" solution, as well. Most good beams cost more than spindles do, and they're not really intended to be the only part of a lowering job. Don't blame the beam for the stupidity of people who don't understand how to correctly build and set up suspensions. The beam isn't ""el cheapo"", the jackass who hacks one together and drops his car improperly is."
beetle,2gv3pv,HDTech9791,1 point,Sat Sep 20 05:55:28 2014 UTC,"Agreed, replace ball joints get an alignment. He will probably need the larger eccentrics when replacing ball joint if it is lowered."
beetle,2gv3pv,Devduino,1 point,Sat Sep 20 12:23:17 2014 UTC,"I doubt camber is the issue, camber gives very little tire wear, especially as the front end doesn't gain camber as you go lower. It's most probably incorrect tracking."

I'd replace all those fuses so you know for sure.  Sounds like you had a short and it took out some of your wiring. If there was smoke you burnt some wires, gotta find out which ones and replace.

It's not going to get better on its own, though it will continue to melt your wiring harness.  The arcing could be where a wire passes through metal without a grommet -- or just a bit of insulation got worn off somewhere.  When you turn the key it sends voltage through this wire and that voltage goes directly to ground through the broken insulation.  Find and replace, it should be easy to spot because it'll be charred black.   If you don't have a soldering iron consider picking one up.  It's dead easy to solder and heat shrink and will give you a much better repair.  HomeDepot carries Weller brand (bright orange) which is my personal pref."

If so and you just want to get the car home (or to a shop), you can bypass the keyswitch pretty easily.  Lift up your rear seat, on the driver's side you'll see this (pic).  Disconnect the starter wire and run an extension wire that's long enough to reach your battery from the end that disappears to the outside.  If you tap this wire to the positive terminal on the battery your car should start right up (keyswitch does need to be in the 'on' position).  There may be a few small sparks, only hold the wire there for the same amount of time you'd hold the key to start.    You can also use a small jumper between the big terminal on the starter solenoid (under the car mounted to the transmission) and where the small cable connects, but the above accomplishes the same thing and you're not under your car starting the engine. All the same, car in neutral and ebrake on please."

For reference, this is my '71 engine - (pic)  Does your filter still have a clamp at the base?  If so, have you tried tightening it?  If no clamp, get one. Is the top of the carb damaged, or is the filter prevented from seating down all the way?    What's preventing you from re-attaching the hose to the oil filler?  If the hose is ancient just replace it, I got a nice cloth covered hose from WolfsburgWest, but NAPA (etc) should have something that'll work.    Here's the page from a '71 manual for the filter - (link) Your other hose probably belongs to the charcoal canister, which may or may not still be in your car. Or you're talking about the large diameter hose that runs down to the breastplate tin and brings up hot air to the carb.  I had one one mine (pic) but removed it and capped the hole in the tin.  Most of these old filters don't have a functioning valve that selects which air (ambient engine bay air or hot engine air), so it's not doing much good."

beetle,2gf6zc,windetch,6,Mon Sep 15 02:10:45 2014 UTC,"Kinda funny, this all started on a quest for defrost. Wasn’t getting much air up front, it was mostly spilling out the bypass on the heaterbox.  Dropped the engine and tested with a shopvac, heaterbox was fine.  Problem was a mouse nest in the Y under the rear seat…  so ah well.    But while it was up on jackstands anyways there were some deferred projects that needed attention.  Floor pans had about reached critical.  They were rather awful when I got the car, previous owner was very fond of his caulk and rivets.  I bought myself some time with expanding foam while I ironed out some of the other issues with the car, but it was always the plan to do a proper repair.  The bottoms of the heater channels were trashed, but the pipes that ran inside were solid.  So a bottom patch worked.

beetle,2g7mfk,Nintenzo,2,Fri Sep 12 16:16:34 2014 UTC,Install it in the speedo first then put it in the wheel. It's a lot easier to spin it and line it up if it's attached to the speedo than it is if it's attached the wheel. Spin in the same direction as wheel rotation so you don't mess the gauge up. It shouldn't because your car can reverse but I'm always paranoid.
beetle,2g7mfk,DrCockenstein,3,Fri Sep 12 16:31:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I got the cable in. It's still making an awful noise but not as bad. Think it could be something in the speedo then? Or should I get some oil and lube up the new cable?"
beetle,2g7mfk,DrCockenstein,2,Fri Sep 12 16:53:16 2014 UTC,Is it the cable or the wheel bearing? My guess would be the wheel baring is going out or it's too loose and that noise is traveling up the cable.
beetle,2g7mfk,DrCockenstein,1 point,Fri Sep 12 18:23:48 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's the wheel bearing, I disconnected the speedo cable and the noise stopped entirely."
beetle,2g7mfk,DrCockenstein,1 point,Fri Sep 12 18:43:27 2014 UTC,"Huh, probably not then. Point the wheels straight, grab the tire by the top, and shake it real good just to be sure. There should be little to no play in the wheel when you shake it.  I had an issue where my wheel bearing would hum a little bit while driving down the road. I never did figure it out. The wheels stayed cold and the bearings looked fine when I pulled them and repacked them. You could try more grease in the cable but I don't think it's going to do anything. Maybe pull the front wheels and inspect and repack the bearings and adjust the brakes to make sure they're not dragging or too loose and causing vibration.  Also try spinning the cable outside of the wheel and see if it still makes noise. The noise could very well be coming from the speedo itself."

beetle,2g7mfk,Fweaka,1 point,Fri Sep 12 19:29:33 2014 UTC,"All right, thanks. Should I grease the entire thing or just the head that goes into the speedo?"
beetle,2g7mfk,Fweaka,1 point,Fri Sep 12 19:31:34 2014 UTC,"The cable is a flexible metal rod inside the outer black housing.  From the factory these aren't really lubricated well anymore.  What you did with the cap of oil is correct.  Make sure your LF wheel is off the ground with a jack and properly supported (when you do this in the future).  Add a bit more oil from the the speedo end and spin the wheel to draw the oil downwards.  You can also spray some of the liquid lubricant I mentioned in from the top (speedo) end if you have it but oil works too.  For the love of your favorite deity do not listen to Fweaka and take the speedometer apart if you haven't before.  It's a pain to reassemble if you mess up. The grease inside is old, but it isn't going to be causing this new noise you have.    Edit:  I have rebuilt a handful of speedometers in my time in addition to resetting them to zero.  A few I have refreshed the grease inside, others I have not.  None have had issues.  I've also done a few wiper motors.    The 67 bug I bought last year had a snapped speedo cable (original German.)  The new one made strange noises similar to yours.  After lubrication it has had no issues."
beetle,2g6x02,Fournokate,4,Fri Sep 12 11:23:27 2014 UTC,"Got a few options actually.  The most common is a roof rack.  If you get the rain gutter mount towers (Yakima 1A, Thule makes a set too) they'll mount right up.  Check craigslist, you'll occasionally find a set.  They're extraordinarily expensive if you buy new.  For occasional use, the Allen trunk mount carriers (sold at Amazon, Walmart, etc) are alright.  They will damage your trunk lid with extended use. I use my bike to go the mile between where I park and where I work (university, parking is miserable).  Used the Allen for a few months, then started looking for something better.  (pics)  This is what I eventually settled on (pic, build), receiver mount.  I just didn't want a roof rack, so I found an old beetle hitch on craigslist, made the missing parts, and added a receiver tube for a Yakima hitch mount rack.  If you're not up for welding Curt makes a rack that'll work with a standard beetle hitch -- and they sell the beetle hitch.  A theSamba member posted hers (hitch, rack). Could also buy a Curt hitch, a 1.25"" receiver tube (Amazon sells them, Curt brand as well) and take them by your local welder."

beetle,2g4qv1,JP147,2,Thu Sep 11 19:57:58 2014 UTC,"If you haven't been rev matching when downshifting, the synchro is probably worn out. Maybe don't downshift to second or match the revs if you do. Worn synchros are not a big problem, as long as you can change the gears without grinding them."
beetle,2g4qv1,JP147,1 point,Thu Sep 11 20:17:54 2014 UTC,"I feel like I've been rev-matching pretty well, but from people are saying, a worn syncro sounds like the issue.  9/10 times it happens, it happens at speed bumps. For example, I'll be approaching a bump in third gear, I'll press in the clutch, slow down to a comfortable speed, coast over the bump. As soon as I clear the bump, I'll go to shift into second, and I'll get the nasty grind one or two times before it'll go into second without barking at me."
beetle,2g4qv1,richcreations,1 point,Thu Sep 11 20:28:53 2014 UTC,"Try putting it in neutral, taking your foot off the clutch and revving the engine up before pressing the clutch and putting it in 2nd. If you can do it without grinding, you can get by with no synchro."

beetle,2g4qv1,Cookaacoo,1 point,Fri Sep 12 00:47:24 2014 UTC,"double clutching is an advanced technique, that manually brings both shafts in the tranny to the same rotational speed before engaging gears (the job of syncros), from the days before transmissions had syncros.  How it works:  Part 1 Upshifting:   Accelerate till ready to shift, push in clutch and release throttle as normal, shift to neutral, release clutch, push clutch back in, shift to next gear, release clutch and apply throttle.  Part 2 Downshifting (the hard part):  decelerate until ready to shift, push in clutch, shift to neutral, release clutch, quickly rev motor to RPM that matches speed/gear you are shifting to (this takes practice), push clutch back in, shift, release clutch.  It is called ""double clutching due to pushing in, and releasing the clutch twice per shift vs normal ""granny shifting""."
beetle,2g4n3o,DoubleHawk4Life,3,Thu Sep 11 18:56:50 2014 UTC,"Some random bits of advice. Not being there where I can crawl over the car, it's hard to get really detailed, so I'm going to just fire some things at you to consider. TL;DR here at the top, the rest of the story below  TL;DR find out how long ago the engine was rebuilt, crawl all over the car looking for rust, make sure the beam won't kill you, and then decide whether you want to buy it or walk away.  Find out how many miles are on that engine since the rebuild, and whether the case can be align bored or cut again. I'm making an assumption based on how that ad reads that the current owner likes to put their foot down on an 1835, and if it hasn't been loved it'll die fast. Also ask them if it's thick wall 92's or regular ones (and if they can prove it). A thick walled 92mm jug is actually a 94mm liner that's been cut for a 92mm piston instead of a 94mm, giving you a thicker piston wall (and better heat management and longevity) If they're thick wall 92's have fun. if they're not (and it'd bet not), that engine may not live very long depending on how the current owner drives it. They say it's got a brake issue too, so they're having trouble maintaining it properly... Ask for service records and receipts for the things they've done. odds are they won't have them, but if they do, at least you have some record of the work and maintenance.  If it's been a while since the rebuild and the case is already align bored 40 thousandths or had 2 thrust cuts, you're building a new engine from scratch with different case (block) when it dies, which (likely) will be sooner than later. Generally you can get away with rebuilding  a VW case twice, and after that you're throwing the dice on whether it'll last past the initial fire up.  Check the door sills, rockers underneath, down the side channels in the trunk, under the battery, around the window sills, along the roof gutters, and in behind the rear window vent grills for rust. That chrome shit on there looks good but traps moisture and it WILL rust. Make sure the 1 piece windows roll up and seal properly. Rain and snow IN the car sucks.  Look carefully at the front beam, Check the suspension components for signs of wear. (it should be king and linkpin, so check for slop) Check the welds. Do they look like they're solid or do they  look like a hack job? If that beam fails, you run the risk of dying in the car as the front end comes apart. Don't take the risk on iffy work. If it looks sketch and you're not a competent welder (or know one you trust), walk away.  The photos in the ad look nice, but they're all taken from a distance and don't show really common problem areas. That always sets off warning bells for me. If you have a friend who knows bugs, take them with you to look over the car. or have the owner meet you at a mechanic you trust to look it over. 4500 is a reasonable price in my neck of the woods for a car that's a nice looking weekend driver but isn't up to snuff for a daily. That translates to a couple G's worth of love to get it up to snuff to be used as a daily driver, assuming the engine isn't toast or nearing toasted status.  Drive it. Make sure you understand how it handles, and how it turns, especially with a 6"" narrow. it's going to rub if you turn too sharp, and you'll likely end up making 13 or 14 point turns to make a U turn. Make sure the shifter finds all 4 forward gears and reverse easily and isn't grinding or feel loose or sloppy. Be aware that pot holes, speed bumps, and even protruding manhole covers and road reflectors will be your mortal enemy. Make sure you're OK with that, it's a part of the admission price for rolling low in a Bug.  In all seriousness, if you can fix a lawnmower engine, you can handle wrenching on a bug. It's all about prep, taking time to understand what you're doing, and doing it right the first time. Then regular maintenance like any other car. be prepared to put some money into this one right away, whether it's just for carbs and some brake love, or whether it's to fix some more serious issues like a dying engine or a failing beam. decide if that's what you want to do, and then either buy it and make it yours, or find yourself another one."

beetle,2g4n3o,richcreations,1 point,Mon Sep 15 09:03:53 2014 UTC,"LOL my VW eats 5.0s for breakfast.  180HP-2175cc in a VW means 1/4 mile in just over 12sec on street tires (doing so involves front tires leaving the ground for most of first gear).   With the weight (engine) in the back, you can really put that power to the ground (compared to say a 5.0), the launch is insane...  Plus, that VW motor sounds really good at almost 7k rpm ;-) (don't skimp on crank/rods/balancing if you wish to try that)  I am not sure what the top speed is, as starts to get too squirrelly after about 135mph, but it still has plenty of pull, I would guess it might do 150 or so if I lowered a bit more, and added a rear wing.  I do have this engine bolted to a rancho pro street tranny, with custom gear ratios, that helps too..."

beetle,2g4n3o,richcreations,2,Mon Sep 15 09:33:35 2014 UTC,"The reason this sort of engine requires constant care is because it has been bored so wide that there is only a thin layer between the cylinders.  So the rule with these sort of engines is to take it easy and maintain it very regularly. There was a thread on this sub about a guy who had a buggy with this sort of engine, abused it and didn't maintain it and it blew.  It will be an expensive thing to replace if it goes wrong. If the engine blows, it is around $2000-3000 to fit with a good standard engine. But as long as you follow the rules, I guess it looks like a nice bug.  Edit: found the link. Looks like it was a bigger bore than the 1835, so you might not be too bad with that one.  http://www.reddit.com/r/beetle/comments/1sqyqw/a_warning_about_the_lifespan_of_performance/"
beetle,2g183n,Nintenzo,5,Wed Sep 10 19:33:44 2014 UTC,"Rebuild your carb.  If I had to guess, either you have a leaking float bowl or a clogged idle jet.  Or it could be a sticking butterfly that your choke can't overcome.  Or a minor vacuum leak (check your manifold bolts/gaskets).  Anyway.  It's something in/near the carb."

If you think about it, it's just screws, gaskets, and a metal puzzle :)  Just don't take it apart, clean it, and then decide you'll put it back together ""tomorrow"".  You'll forget where all the little pieces go.  IMO, you need to make it a single-day project no matter what.  If you really want to hedge your bets, buy a new one and rebuild this one as a spare.

beetle,2g183n,Fweaka,1 point,Wed Sep 10 20:51:13 2014 UTC,This. KISS. Choke adjustment is a couple minutes. Easy to do and easy to eliminate as a cause once you've done it. Rebuilding a carb is more work that you may not actually need to do.

beetle,2g0ouh,potato208,5,Wed Sep 10 16:45:13 2014 UTC,Stock rebuild? Make sure you're really at TDC when you start to set them up and not 180 out. Set them like this: Also make sure your distributor isn't 180 out. Your timing mark for #1 in the dizzy should be around the 5 O'clock position (rough position depending on how your timing is set). If the rotor is pointed at your timing mark and your pulley is at 0 (or just left of the timing mark) you should be at TDC.  1 @tdc  2 180 counterclockwise  3 Another 180 counterclockwise  4 One last 180 degree rotation.

If I recall correctly, I had this same problem where the rockers were adjusted all the way out and still touching the push rod, took it somewhere and the guy stuck two washers under where the rocker arms mount, got the clearance and called it good."

beetle,2fv2c7,Fweaka,1 point,Tue Sep 9 01:09:12 2014 UTC,I would go with a normal bug and I would buy one with some issues so you could learn. That's what I did at 16 (18 now) loved every moment. 2K later and I'm still working on it and loving every waking moment of it.
beetle,2fv2c7,tcruarceri,1 point,Tue Sep 9 01:25:16 2014 UTC,"That sounds like a good idea.  Do you happen to know how long it would take to convert to a baja? Body kit plus suspension is what is changed from what I understand. I won't be converting it for at least a couple of months after I get it so I still get the feeling of a normal beetle, but it wouldn't hurt to be prepared."
beetle,2fv2c7,Fweaka,1 point,Tue Sep 9 02:00:00 2014 UTC,I hear it is extremely expensive to convert over. If you want a Baja you should buy a bug as a Baja. But you will need to learn how to work on them. I knew nothing about a bug and I bought mine non running so I had to learn a lot and it is the greatest car a man could ask for. Could get expensive at times and it can kill your hopes once and a while on certain things but just keep working at it when you get one and you will enjoy it.

beetle,2fv2c7,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Thu Sep 11 01:53:02 2014 UTC,"I'd find something as mechanically sound as possible.  Ignore the interior, focus on rust, the engine, transmission, brakes, etc. Rust may not be as big of a deal where you are, but check for it anyways -- heater channels that run along the side of the car, floor pans, battery area (under rear seat), luggage area. Price will depend on location, but find something that's ready to go and not a basketcase.  If you're lucky you can find one with a somewhat shabby interior that the owner has kept up all the maintenance on.  Because interiors are easy to swap out, but to drive it a thousand miles then have to do major engine repairs will burn you out pretty quick. Esp. if its' your only car.    To your original question, I'd go standard over baja.  Someone who took the time and effort to make it a baja is slightly more likely to run the snot out of it. A baja engine has also been sitting out in the weather unless the car was garaged.  Zero protection from the elements.  Then again, if you're going to convert it to a baja anyways go ahead and find one already converted.  The supply of nice, clean standards is getting smaller every day.  Just sayin'"

beetle,2fv2c7,fifty_five,1 point,Tue Sep 9 02:16:48 2014 UTC,"I agree with the last part of this post. If you want a baja, it is better to get one already done. It is much easier to create a baja, than to turn a baja back into a beetle. It would more than likely involve thinner, poorly fitting metal to do so, if anyone ever does it. If it's a baja you want, find a good one. If you're in HEB territory, rust and rain probably aren't too much of an issue for you. If you get dead set on building your own, try to find a bug with problems in the areas you are cutting off. No sense in destroying a beetle when other options exist. But, I'm somewhat of a purist and probably outnumbered here, hehe."
beetle,2fv2c7,fifty_five,1 point,Tue Sep 9 02:51:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I think with everyone's advice I'll probably just save a little more for the initial buy to get a good baja. It'll delay the purchase by a month or two, but it'll still be done before the end of summer which is my goal anyways. I would've enjoyed using it all summer, but weekends are for adventures too so yea. Thanks again."
beetle,2fv2c7,fifty_five,1 point,Tue Sep 9 21:25:25 2014 UTC,"Beat up on the outside doesn't mean the car isn't mechanically sound.

beetle,2f7iyg,winewagens,1 point,Mon Sep 1 23:54:15 2014 UTC,"I saw this I am just really struggling to figure out what I need to do. There are also a lot of conflicting pieces of info on here.  I dont have any of the evap system. I dont have the original air cleaner. I  just took the tank out and found the 2 vent opening on the top right were just venting into the trunk. So I plugged those.  I also ordered the Stant Cap which I believe goes on the 73. I am just not sure if having ONLY that is enough venting. Some say it is, some say its not.   I am hesitant to open a vent to just the atmosphere because IDK if it will leak fuel. No one has a good picture of their setup without aircleaner or canister."
beetle,2f7iyg,winewagens,2,Tue Sep 2 00:57:09 2014 UTC,I understand.  Do you have any photos of your current setup?  My sister and husband has a 73 super and from what I remember about the last time I worked on it is that their car doesn't have the charcoal canister or the plastic evap rectangle.  The vented cap is your simplest and easiest bet.  That's what is on their car and they've had no problems.  They've owned it for at least seven years now.    Also make sure you replace the rubber line under the tank and the one under the car by the transmission before it goes into the engine compartment.  The worst case scenario is that the metal line inside the tunnel has a pinhole causing the gas smell in the car (PITA to replace.)
beetle,2f7iyg,winewagens,1 point,Tue Sep 2 01:33:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah I am hoping its not the metal line but I am confident its coming from the front. I do need to relocate my rear fuel filter to behind the firewall.  I have 2 shots of the left side near the filler. Sorry for the potato pics  The other side had NOTHING attached which I think was part of the smell since the 2 vent openings were just open. I have short circuited that by looping some tubing.  My only thought is if somewhere I should attach a line that runs to the outside. Currently the first half of the charcoal system exists so I could run a line from one of the vents or something to this, which means vapor would come out inside the front passenger wheel well.  However my car is indoors in my shop a lot and part of this is prevent dangerous fumes in my shop :)"
beetle,2f7iyg,fwainwright,2,Tue Sep 2 01:40:15 2014 UTC,If I recall correctly the side that you had nothing on is connected to the plastic rectangle that always breaks.  The closed loop between the two holes you did should be an acceptable setup.
beetle,2f7iyg,squaretobehip,1 point,Tue Sep 2 02:48:51 2014 UTC,Sweet so based on that then the only vent I will have is the gas cap. Hopefully that doesn't cause any issues.
beetle,2f5pwz,lukas_vv,1 point,Mon Sep 1 10:10:23 2014 UTC,easy place to start is to check for developing vacuum leaks. spray carb cleaner around the vacuum ports and main intake gasket and listen for rpm increase.

beetle,2f3v1r,WEINER_SCHLAP,2,Sun Aug 31 20:32:47 2014 UTC,can you get a buddy to help you test for current from the sensor at the master cylinder? its good to test these even though it sounds like it is not the problem. If I were you I would definitely be looking for shorts or bad connections in the wiring between the light fixture and the sensor. (since you say there was a spark at the sensor wiring upon testing.)

beetle,2exh3h,Dreamscarred,3,Fri Aug 29 16:19:34 2014 UTC,"Nice one! Looks like it's in great shape.  One quick note, your fuel filter isn't in a terrible location tucked up on the side, but consider moving it out of the engine bay entirely -- about a foot back on the other side of the engine tin (after the hard line exits the tunnel) or down under the tank.  Given I don't see a fuel pump it probably has an electric up front, may want the filter pre-pump to protect it from tank debris.    Issue is that sometimes the filters leak, the extra weight can cause the hose to pull free, or the connector on the carb can pull out (consider safety wiring that bit).  All of these have the potential to spray gas all over a hot engine."

beetle,2exh3h,Bermwolf,3,Mon Sep 1 23:10:15 2014 UTC,"Dash was more than likely cut for that radio install.  By that I mean the metal part, you don't have to hurt the dashpad.    The older model radios were called ""shaft style"" and will fit right in, no cutting of anything required. I found an old alpine unit while wandering a you-pull-it style autoyard.  You can find various models on eBay (JVC made a nice looking unit as well) but they can be almost as expensive as buying a brand new one.  You can find brand new shaft style radios, but they're quite pricey.   Well, except for the the Pyle, which very few people recommend."

Other than I'm going about this all wrong.  Get two matching washers that fit the rocker stud,install oring (donut) then washer on each side, put rocker assy on.if still not enough add another washer on each side or get thicker ones.

beetle,2er9hz,FaultyTowers,3,Wed Aug 27 20:15:54 2014 UTC,"Typically idling problems center around a faulty idle cut off, choke, or a vacuum leak.     The easiest way to make sure it isn't a vacuum leak is to buy some plug ends and plug all vacuum connections. Then you can spray carb cleaner around the usual trouble areas (throttle shaft and intake manifold)."
beetle,2er9hz,corenfa,1 point,Thu Aug 28 12:35:49 2014 UTC,"This is your likely culprit. I had the exact same issue on my '66 with a 34 PICT-3. The idle cutoff solenoid is failing or failed. It will run fine at speed, but as soon as you get out of it and are running on the idle circuit again it'll stall. This is a 9 dollar fix and you can do it yourself. The ICS is on the lower left side of your carb (as you stand behind the car facing the engine bay ) It's a cylindrical grey metal or brass colored unit with a wire coming out of it going over to the coil. Remove it and replace with a new one, or if the wire's not connected, I'd bet just reconnecting the wire will make it happy. (goes to coil + side)"

EDIT: also you could add an external oil cooler at this point as well.  EDIT: also I doubt your pump is ""weak"" more likely your main/rod bearings are loose (read shot), do I remember you having an oil loss/pressure issue?"
beetle,2enyzb,windetch,1 point,Tue Aug 26 23:19:42 2014 UTC,"Curious, why would you say they suck? The mexi bugs later got this exact style filter pump.  CB Performance claims theirs ""guarantees total filtration of all engine oil before it reaches the bearings.""  It makes for a very easy install (if you have the muffler heat riser tube on the passenger side).  I looked at mounting a filter remotely on my bug, there's really no good spot for it.  Be curious what you'd recommend.  The lines go everywhere, usually have to go past the hot muffler.  More connections is more places to leak.  These are simple one-piece units that most users give high praise.  Agreed though, low oil pressure might not be the pump.  Fweaka, how's the endplay?  And what oil weight do you run?"
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Wed Aug 27 00:05:53 2014 UTC,"Well, at least for high performance, they don't flow enough oil thru the tiny passage required to reroute and return the oil all thru the pump, also having the filter that close to the muffler just adds more heat.  I have a header, and one of those billet filter brackets empi sells, and as for the lines, I also have a big oil cooler, and two smaller ones as well (the small ones are in my custom heaters)  EDIT: AN fittings almost never leak btw."
beetle,2enyzb,winewagens,1 point,Wed Aug 27 00:47:23 2014 UTC,"Just put heat shield around it and you don't have to worry about it. Just like they do with the headers around the starter, they do this mostly with the big turbos."
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Wed Aug 27 02:16:22 2014 UTC,Have you checked the oil pressure relief sytem to make sure it's functioning properly?
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Wed Aug 27 18:28:13 2014 UTC,"I don't know what that is. This is my first car, been learning as I go. Had it for 2 years."
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Thu Aug 28 20:12:40 2014 UTC,"on the bottom of your engine, there are two largish bolts, one in front, one in the rear, under them is a spring and plunger, those are your oil pressure relief valves, they sometimes stick and such, should just fall out when you remove the bolt, and move freely in the hole."
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Fri Aug 29 01:57:51 2014 UTC,Are they both the same size or?
beetle,2enyzb,windetch,1 point,Fri Aug 29 05:33:36 2014 UTC,"the bolts/plugs yes, the plungers/springs, no"
beetle,2enyzb,windetch,1 point,Fri Aug 29 06:08:01 2014 UTC,Do I have a single relief or a dual relief?
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Fri Aug 29 05:34:15 2014 UTC,I am sure it would be a dual
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Fri Aug 29 06:07:31 2014 UTC,If I remove those bolts will oil run out of it or is it something I have to do at oil change?
beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Fri Aug 29 21:55:44 2014 UTC,"some oil will come out yes, but if you suspect oil pressure issues, I would deal with it before driving, I.E. don't wait till scheduled oil change time..."

beetle,2enyzb,richcreations,1 point,Sat Aug 30 09:48:27 2014 UTC,15w 40 shell rotella t. What do you mean by end play? Also how do I remove the pully? Do I need a puller?
beetle,2enyzb,windetch,1 point,Wed Aug 27 02:14:06 2014 UTC,"Decent oil. You can get a rough idea of the endplay by pushing the pulley in then then pulling it out quickly.  It should have a barely perceptible amount of play (generally set to .005).  If you can see it move 's a bit much.   But yeah, you need a pulley puller to get it off.  If you look online various shops carry a low profile puller that can be used with the engine in the car.  I made my own sorta crappy version, it did work though. You'll also need an oil pump puller to remove the old oil pump, it's in there very snug."
beetle,2enyzb,windetch,1 point,Wed Aug 27 02:45:33 2014 UTC,Yeah I heard on reddit that oil is what I should be using. Is there a specific kind of pulley puller I need? I knew I needed a oil pump puller ($5 on jbugs). Is there splines in the pulley where I have to line it up the same? Just trying to prepare myself for this task when I get the money for it.

beetle,2emgcn,DrCockenstein,1 point,Tue Aug 26 13:10:20 2014 UTC,"If you get one and the vinyl is messed up you can buy some SEM Color Coat and apply new vinyl in any color you want. It is expensive but it goes on easy, dries fast, and is vinyl once it's on. I'd recommend a mask if you're spraying this stuff since it smells really, really bad."
beetle,2el3ef,PEAJAYDEE,4,Tue Aug 26 01:24:39 2014 UTC,"This is the air splitter that goes from the heat tube coming off the heater channel to the defrost vents and heater box. It's going to be a fun job trying to get that back on there, just warning you now. Get ready to touch whatever crap is in the black holes on the sides of the trunk."
beetle,2el3ef,DrCockenstein,5,Tue Aug 26 01:43:28 2014 UTC,"Just did this on my '70, wasn't too bad.  Saw a post on theSamba I can't find atm, but electrical conduit (from HomeDepot etc) works really well for the part that goes down into the chasm of darkness.  Can't remember size, just take the splitter with you.  Get four of the couplings (2 each side) and some gasketmaker (or silicone etc).  Use a shopvac to clean what you can, if it's a little rusty down there maybe spray some rust converter.  Can't hurt. I had to take my hood off to get clearance, 's only 4 bolts.  Mark the position so its easy to put back on.  The conduit coupling slots over the heater channel outlet near perfectly, use a little gasket maker (etc) and it makes a satisfyingly snug connection.  Anyways, just an idea. Wolfsburgwest (etc) sells the paper tubes to connect everything back up, pay attention to sizing."

beetle,2el3ef,_moist_,2,Tue Aug 26 09:37:00 2014 UTC,I was replacing my antenna and noticed that none if the hoses were connected to anything. It came from the Drivers side front below the hinge for the hood.  My guess is heat?
beetle,2el3ef,curtquarquesso,2,Tue Aug 26 01:29:03 2014 UTC,"While you have it out of there, do yourself a a favor and buy the correct hoses, and hook it up right. If it were an older car, I wouldn't bother, but the Super actually has a decent fresh air ventilation system. Get a shop-vac with a pointy nozzle, suck all the crap out of the abyss, and be patient getting it back down in there. Small hands help?"
beetle,2elbrj,AntIis,3,Tue Aug 26 02:51:28 2014 UTC,"Ah, a mexi beetle?  Should be the same general concerns as any other bug -- mostly, rust. Peek under the carpets as you're able; under the battery (which is under the back seat), the luggage area, floorpans.  Look under the car for the same, under the doors, check the heaterchannels that run along the edge of the car.  The engine should have all it's tin, the engine bay is designed to be airtight.  If you can see the ground it's missing tin which can lead to overheating.  Good luck with it"
beetle,2elbrj,windetch,2,Tue Aug 26 04:20:06 2014 UTC,thanks this has been very helpful.   I can't wait to check it out this week then.  just in case heres the link 1980 VW
beetle,2elbrj,curtquarquesso,2,Tue Aug 26 04:53:36 2014 UTC,"/u/windtech is spot on. Check everywhere for rust. Poke the heater channels and listen for crackling.    Check for a firm brake pedal, and and check the condition of some of the brake lines and hoses.  Check under the back seat, in the battery tray. Make sure the floor is still good there.    Does the Mexican beetle come with an A/C unit?"
beetle,2elbrj,curtquarquesso,2,Tue Aug 26 14:26:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks and sadly no...ill have to do something for that as monterrey is rather hot, I am thinking swamp cooler,  however what could I do for the winter??"
beetle,2elbrj,curtquarquesso,2,Tue Aug 26 22:07:57 2014 UTC,"If your heater boxes work properly, heat will be a non-issue. When I got mine, the heater box flaps were stuck open, and boy did they work. Had to get underneath and shut them manually. Not a big issue since I'm in South Florida.  From what I've heard, swamp coolers are totally ineffective in humid climates, like South Florida, and I assume Monterrey. Apparently they rely on dry climate to operate properly, which basically limits them to the southwest region.   EDIT: Wait, which Monterrey? If you're in the dry SW, a swamp cooler may work out alright."
beetle,2elbrj,curtquarquesso,2,Tue Aug 26 22:24:36 2014 UTC,"MX, monterrey, swamp cooler is where you put frozen bottles in a cooler, make holes and put a small fan on it right?"

beetle,2eesso,lawrnk,3,Sun Aug 24 01:33:43 2014 UTC,"Fuck no, never in 100 years. The beetle is an icon, one of the most amazing cars, Elio motors is pretty close to a scam."
beetle,2eesso,rudesasquatch,2,Sun Aug 24 02:31:29 2014 UTC,"How so? The hedge fund and capital is impressive.  Even the 150m for the former hummer plant.  Off the shelf parts, 90% locally made.  A simple car.  The board of directors is a culmination of frankly, the best. Why is it a scam, and what don't you see as far as this having a similar goal to what Ferdinand Porsche and Hitler imagined? Outside of the 4 passengers and such."
beetle,2eesso,rudesasquatch,3,Sun Aug 24 02:40:38 2014 UTC,"Firstly, the bug is a car, this has 3 wheels. Why you may ask? well its because a 3 wheel vehicle is able to not be classified as a car and thus circumvents safety regulations. The bug played by the rules and it was a good car, elio is trying to weasel their ways out of safety restrictions and with that in mind 84 mpg is rather pathetic. A modern day bug would be much closer to a kei car."
beetle,2eesso,windetch,5,Sun Aug 24 03:45:04 2014 UTC,"Eeh.  Saying the beetle played by the rules is a bit of a stretch, the rules were pretty lax back then.  From a safety standpoint the VW Bus should never, ever have happened.  Look at this.  No, seriously.  You can see the back of the headlight enclosure, there's just a thin sheet of metal between you and other drivers.  Head-on collisions were miserable. The bugs aren't much better.  I guess that may be the biggest difference, awesome deathtraps like our beetles are no longer able to be sold, they have to actually survive a crash.    The Elio, on the other hand, is promising high crash test results.  It hasn't been officially tested yet, but it is going to be rated and the company is highly optimistic.    84 mpg is steller.  Most motorcycles can't achieve that, and it's using a standard ICE engine.  Slightly confused why you think it's poor."
beetle,2eesso,windetch,2,Sun Aug 24 04:17:51 2014 UTC,"The bug was meant as an all purpose family sedan, the Elio is firmly positioned as a commuter for one person.  I guess it technically seats two, but that rear seat looks cramped.  Given the vast majority of everyday use can be accomplished with this style vehicle 's not a bad idea at all. It's at a fairly impressive price point, the car could actually end up paying for itself in gas bills alone -- esp. if someone transitions their family SUV from daily-driver to trip-driver.  I'll be right with you watching how it does and hoping for the best.  But as this generation's Beetle?  Prolly not. I suspect most people are going to look at the Elio and just see the utter lack of utility."

beetle,2e4x5c,inanecathode,1 point,Thu Aug 21 17:54:25 2014 UTC,Its a couple of things. they do not dampen on one side and they also have leaked fluid.  I also am replacing them with coil overs since I want to raise the rear ride height a bit. I have bigger tires and they rub under heavy suspension travel so....my coilovers arrive today :)
beetle,2e4x5c,inanecathode,2,Fri Aug 22 15:05:45 2014 UTC,"Kewl, cool overs are ok temporarily, but the shock mounts will bend down eventually. Best way to go is to re index the torsion rods"
beetle,2e4x5c,inanecathode,1 point,Sun Aug 24 00:26:54 2014 UTC,Thats what I said to my mechanic(shout out to Henry from Houston Bugaholics) and he said that it would end up raising the rear ~2inches if I did that.  I am going to give it a shot with the coil overs but not super tight. Maybe the fact that it will now have WORKING shocks will help my issue in and of itself.

beetle,2e5ejt,winewagens,1 point,Thu Aug 21 04:05:37 2014 UTC,"Try pressing the gear shift ""too hard"" in either direction (either past 4th or past third). If you get a lot of whining and groaning its likely one of the shaft bearings inside the tranny is cooked. If its moaning when you're just barely accelerating it's most likely one of the carrier bearings in the trans.  If the moaning gets louder if you turn the car either way its likely a wheel bearing. Most likely it's a trans bearing. Good news bad news with that, good news is you dont have to worry which one it is, because bad news is the trans isnt serviceable by you."
beetle,2e5ejt,inanecathode,1 point,Thu Aug 21 04:52:58 2014 UTC,"Why would you say the tranny is not serviceable? Not an easy job, but it can be done."
beetle,2e5ejt,richcreations,1 point,Thu Aug 21 05:39:10 2014 UTC,Unless its a horizontal split tranny (ie very very old) the amount and cost of tools and learning how to use them right outweighs what just exchanging the unit as a core for a rebuilt one. The trans in these things is pretty much the only part i can think of you cant just whip apart in your garage and get it back together reliably.

beetle,2e0f7e,Holiace,2,Tue Aug 19 19:26:50 2014 UTC,Any 30amp 12v vw generator will  work.  You may just need a brush kit though.  Are you sure the voltage regulator isn't dead?   An internally regulated alternator is an easier swap if the whole generator is dead in my opinion.    Edit: don't get a 38amp one from a 71 bus (one yr only) and mate it to your current voltage regulator or you will have more problems.

Your best bet is really to put it back together and check it with a voltmeter.  When running it should be  approximately 14.4v.

beetle,2e0f7e,richcreations,1 point,Wed Aug 20 05:08:29 2014 UTC,I suggest looking at the charging system troubleshooting part of the Rob & Dave site.  It provides easy to follow instructions that essentially everybody will repeat over and over.  If their how to check it is what you did and your value is 0 then you probably do need a replacement.  The alternator conversion is normally sold in a kit for around $130US.  I don't know what it would be in Scandinavia.  A guy I know is an EMPI dealer (mostly junk parts) but the alternator kits have been decent.

There was a company that sold just the wheel, but their website is currently blank except for an email addr.  (Current site, Archive.org).  Last time the full site was recorded was March 29th, 2013; might be worth an email.    There's a post on theSamba that has some good pictures of how an original singlewheel trailer functioned.  Infact, it's a pretty popular subject on theSamba, go figure eh?  I'd think the wheel mechanism wouldn't be too hard to make, two wheel hubs then decide how you want the suspension to work.

Sounds like a wire in your turn signal circuit may be damaged and grounding out when you turn 'em on.  Do the turn signals work properly otherwise, including the gauge light? Dirty connectors can cause odd electrical issues as well, use fine grade sandpaper and clean 'em up.  Quick test is to use a voltmeter to watch the battery voltage.  With engine off your battery should be ~12.5v, while on and charging ~14.  If this is true you should be fine.  If the fan belt is tight and everything otherwise looks good go for it, might avoid using your turn signal during your drive tomorrow if possible. Diagnose properly when you have time."
beetle,2drjca,windetch,1 point,Sun Aug 17 02:20:23 2014 UTC,"Both lights do come on with just the key, as usual. I imagine it is wiring.

I did clean all of the connectors last week to try and get my radio and horn working but now my wipers don't work. Ill have to get back in there to see if I failed to connect something. Side note: I recently replaced my fuel filter and after drives, the gas in the filter is bubbling up. So the vacuum is no longer sucking fuel, but it seems like it the fuel is going down and filling a void. Not sure if it just started, but I just started noticing. I have a video for reference if required."

's not too too bad, fairly simple little car.  Fuel filter wise, if you see a stream of bubbles coming up your hose clamps may be a bit tight (esp if you're using 1/4"" hose).  Most aircooled VW shops carry the original style braided fuel lines, if that's not what you're using it may be worth a shot to switch it out.  If your fuel filter is in the engine compartment I'd recommend relocating it, 's one of the reasons so many bugs have burst into flame.  Below the tank or after the hardline exits the tunnel are both decent places."

If ever the two should conflict, choose the Bentley's way.    The bugme videos are very helpful as well.  You bug lacks a proper oil filter (unless a previous owner added one), it just uses a screen to catch the larger particles.  This is okay, but realize you need to change the oil every 2,000 - 3,000 miles and you should check the screen ~ every other time, if not every time.  You'll want new gaskets for the plate (or buy a pair of silicone gaskets) when you change it out, any aircooled vw shop carries them for cheap.  Also, if you want, companies like CB Performance make an oil pump with a spin-on filter (MAXI 2).  It's reasonably easy to change out, I'm doing that now on mine.  Oil wise...  heh.  There's a hundred page topic over at theSamba.com debating which oil weight and brand.  I run 15w-40 Shell Rotella, but search around a bit, 's sort of an interesting subject.  Do keep an eye on your valves, they're easy to check.

I'd be more comfortable with a welded pan, but /shrug.  If you search around you'll read varying opinions about whether to replace the floor pan with the body on or body off, but most agree that aligning the pan properly is easier with the body on -- even if you just put it back on briefly to check.  I ordered a pair of floor pans from WolfsburgWest just yesterday and plan to do it body-on.

beetle,2da596,WEINER_SCHLAP,1 point,Sat Aug 16 14:25:18 2014 UTC,"So, I am going to be brutally honest. MONEY!  First things what engine do you currently have? If its a single port and its old and tired, converting it to dual port and a fresh set of rings and lap the cylinders into the head well would be a good start.   If its already a dual port, with a stock engine, the best thing you can do is exhaust and a set of ICT webers as InfiniteWut said. A nice merged header and the carbs would help that thing breathe for sure. From there is where price goes up, and it goes up exponentially depending on what you wanna do with it.   If your feeling frisky, then my advice would be to split the engine open for a rebuild. See what it is like, have it align bored, new bearings, and while its apart put a engle w110 and maybe some light pocket porting on the heads below the valve seat. A lightweight clutch and full balance would not only add to the longevity of the engine, but probably be good for a 5500 RPM rev (I have revved the stock crank to a little over 6k, but wouldn't recommend it) But this is all depending on your level of expertise and if you can afford to have the car down for a while. The combo listed above with the dual 34 webers would net you about 70-75hp, maybe a bit more, but I am quite conservative.  edited for spelling...its still wrong."
beetle,2da596,kizzlebizz,1 point,Tue Aug 12 00:08:43 2014 UTC,"What are you comfortable doing and how reliable do you want it to be?  To get the most power, you need to package things together. Dual carbs are great, a new exhaust, clean the heads up, polish and match port the heads and intakes, and you'll have a nice runner.

This is by no means an bolt in operation, but since it's been done by so many people, the information is out there on what wors and what doesn't.  But 135 hp with better heat and the possibility of AC for $2 to $3k at the very most isn't bad."

Hopefully you are just missing a running board securing bolt and the heater channel isn't toast causing the running board to only be connected to your fenders there and leading to the gap that I think I see.    Edit:  OK, so I'm looking on a computer now and it seems that in photo 2 there is a bolt missing that should be holding the rear fender in place (the bump where your finger is pointing appears to be the welded in nut for fender attachment.)  Fixing that would make the fender beading fit better.  Photo 3 looks to be that the running board attachment panel of the heater channel has a hole due to the ~1"" of slightly rusty brown by the fender, then a few inch gap, then the brown metal again.  If that is the case it they sell a patch panel for that area (same with the bad fender retaining nut area.)"

beetle,2ct5gs,n0exit,1 point,Thu Aug 7 00:34:05 2014 UTC,Now that you're firing right with gas it's one of the following:   Closed choke Vacuum leaks Timing/timing advance Dirty/clogged jets/carburetor   You're not dying anymore so it's getting there but you've still got stuff to check. Work that list above in order since rebuilding the carb is the hardest job. Don't do it unless it's needed.

beetle,2ct5gs,DrCockenstein,1 point,Thu Aug 7 05:46:31 2014 UTC,How do you know it's right? Put a light on it and make sure so you don't have to worry about it being part of the problem.  Also this is a vacuum advance dizzy so as the RPM's rise the timing advances. It's hard to see this work without a timing light. You should have vacuum off the carb that advances the dizzy. When you put a light on it and rev it up the timing mark should move according to manual specs.

beetle,2cqcid,winewagens,2,Wed Aug 6 01:25:07 2014 UTC,"I don't know of one, however I just wanted to point out, unlike many older cars, a beetle is almost sure to not have it's original engine. Air-Cooled engines have a fairly short life."
beetle,2cqcid,richcreations,2,Tue Aug 5 22:57:11 2014 UTC,"A ton of engine swapping happened as mentioned so OG pairings are fairly rare.  My now deceased friend and boss told me they swapped engines (loaner motors) at his shop during people's lunch breaks during the 70s/80s.  They did the rebuild and had it back in about 2 days.  Sometimes folks just kept the loaner and bought it.  A very short life is common if poorly maintained and beat on, especially since a lot of balancing was not done back then.  If my memory serves me well they typically lasted around 100k before they needed head work.  Luckily for me my 70 bus still has the OG engine with 60k or so.  My 67 bug has the OG engine with around 101k. I suspect it has been apart though it did sit for a long time in NE.  My friend who has his shop listed in the Muir book went 200k on the original T4 in his Westy before touching it (though T4 are a lot more robust.)  I.e. a few rarities."
beetle,2cqcid,winewagens,2,Wed Aug 6 01:37:25 2014 UTC,"200k is a lot for an air-cooled, but when '60s volvo b-18/b-20 engines regularly go 500k+ (while getting beat on) I stand behind the short life comment, 100k is about all you can expect. and since cases fret/warp they often get replaced during rebuild. At least air-cooled engines are cheap to rebuild.  Edit: I will be happy to get 60k out of my 2175, but it does have almost 5 times the original HP (my car came with a 1300)"

beetle,2cpvry,Bermwolf,2,Tue Aug 5 19:55:26 2014 UTC,"Congrats! Nice looking car.  Two small recommendations (I'm paranoid about engine fires) -   move your fuel filter out of the engine bay, 's an unnecessary fire hazard as is.  You can put it about a foot back on the other side of the sheet metal or below the gas tank.  's relatively unlikely the filter will leak, but if it does you'd rather the gas drip onto the ground and not your engine / exhaust. make sure your fuel line isn't resting on the preheat tube.  That thing gets hot.  It's recommended that you run a hard line (1/4"" steel brake line works fine) from just before the fuel line enters the engine bay through the tin (grommet plz) up to the fuel pump.  Helps with routing."
beetle,2cpvry,windetch,1 point,Wed Aug 6 15:03:20 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations! Always helpful.  I bought the engine as a rebuild from a local guy(Henry at Bugaholics, amazing dude). Unfortunately when driving it home I noticed a pretty good size oil leak. I think that the gasket behind the pressure plate is not in properly, and when I stop oil comes out between the engine and transmission.  I am taking the car back today to have him fix the leak(15K warranty on engine) Once thats done I gotta start the list of minor/moderate repairs to the rest of the car"

beetle,2cnael,thefuckdidieat,3,Tue Aug 5 01:37:46 2014 UTC,"Safety first. Brakes, wipers, lights, new seat belts, windshield washer reservoir.  Mechanical next. Make sure your engine and trans-axle are solid and reliable. Check all suspension parts and replace all worn pieces. If you are going to drive it in cold weather, make sure your heater boxes are in good shape. Maybe invest in the fan boosters for the heater.  If you already have the car taken most of the way apart, paint it while the car is more pieces. The paint will look better when all of the rubber and fender bead is out of the way.  Make sure all your doors and hood close correctly. Don't underestimate the difference a solidly closing door can make in the feel of your car. Sound deadening material really helps the car sound ""solid"". I put it on the roof and it made a huge difference in the hollow sound and also the heat from the sun beating down on the roof of the car.  Don't skimp on the rubber. Buy German when you can. It is more expensive but the fit and finish is better and holds up better.  Don't bother with one-piece windows. They are a pain in the rear and rattle like crazy.  Wait on carpet until you can afford nice carpet. Cut pile cheap stuff looks good right after it is installed but gets worn areas a lot faster than more expensive carpet. It just ends up looking crappy.  After that, cosmetics. If you have any money left. $3000 sounds like a bunch of money until you get into the project.

beetle,2cnael,stupid_trollz,1 point,Tue Aug 5 03:59:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I wish I had spent more money on disc brakes and a bigger engine, than on looks! I'm going through mine and updating it right now also."
beetle,2cnael,windetch,2,Tue Aug 5 04:06:35 2014 UTC,"Depends on the quality you're after, neh?  I mean, you can drop $3k on paint alone fairly easily.  Priorities wise, function over form imo, so the wiring harness first (if it needs it).  That's $250 - 300.  Just kinda assuming you've got the engine and transmission already sorted since you didn't list them.  Those are your biggest worries, the rest of your list is just clean up (given no major rust areas).  Sound proofing is a good idea.  I started out with my bug stripped down to bare metal, it was deafening.  Around 50sqft of sound deadening will cover just about everything you want to in the bug, $110 for 50sqft of FatMat Rattletrap (Amazon etc), Dynamat is a little more expensive, or some people have reported good luck with some roofing material from HomeDepot.    Headliner can be a bear to install and make look good (also, all your glass has to come out); watch a few videos and see if you want to have a go -- iirc shops will charge at least $200 in labor alone.  I declined a proper headliner (for now) and stuck a $20 roll of utility carpet from Walmart up there (pics); it works and looks decent enough.  Headliner kits can run you $60 - 200 depending on material.  The rest is mostly body work (which I've avoided so far).  If you decide you want new pieces of metal original is, in general, superior to aftermarket.  Most of the new stuff is too thin and just slightly the wrong size and/or shape.  You can make it work most of the time, but eh.  Try theSamba.com classifies, maybe keep half an eye on your local craigslist and see if anyone is parting out a bug.    Paint wise...  tbh, I'd try a wash and wax.  It may surprise you how well it comes back.  If you hate the color and/or the body work screws it up then hey.  Go for it. Careful cheaping out on paint though, the generic cheap paint shop jobs only last a few years. If you're feeling ambitious check this guy out.    Have fun finishing her up! JBugs seems to have decent headliner kits, along with a wiring harness for your '68."

beetle,2cc3bi,Gaddpeis,3,Fri Aug 1 13:59:45 2014 UTC,"An alternator has a larger diameter than a generator, VW modified the fuel pump for easier fit.  Some people have put a standard generator-style fuel pump on their alternator engine and it works fine, tight fit though. There's a couple different style generator pumps, you don't have to use the one with the top port -- though it should fit -- they make generator pumps with both ports on the side (I'm pretty sure those are more common than the top ports).  As you noted, on the generator pump the little foot that works the pump is tucked up inside the housing, on the alternator version it sticks out of the bottom.  So there are two different push rod lengths, the alternator being slightly shorter.  The generator push rod will thus stick up higher than the alternator version.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a fuel pressure gauge (low pressure), you can find them for ~$15.  You want your new pump to deliver ~4psi to the engine.  Some of the new aftermarket pumps put out entirely too much pressure, and even the new rebuild kits for the rebuildable fuel pumps are iffy."

I would buy used original parts where possible, and new rubber / metal pieces from shops like wolfsburgwest.com as there's a disappointing lack in quality for much of the aftermarket parts.

If you can get away with a patch panel on the bottom WolfsburgWest does sell those, see part #10 - https://www.wolfsburgwest.com/wolfsburg_new/body_sheet_metal/bug_sheet_metal/bug_body_sheet_metal.cfm  But I'm leaning towards you needing #4  If you can't weld I'd get someone who can to look at them and see what they think before buying parts, if the bottoms are really torn to shreds you're probably looking at replacing the whole thing...  If you google ""beetle heater channel replacement"" there's a fair amount of info out there, it's not a real fun job.

If it has the original engine in it (unlikely) and little to no rust on the original sheet metal, then it suddenly becomes it a great deal and an excellent restoration project car (a fully restored '67 with orig engine is worth around $25k). Both of those things are highly unlikey though, especially considering the location (rust belt).

beetle,2c3yko,sdguero,1 point,Wed Jul 30 23:29:52 2014 UTC,"It's all original and driven around but has ehh paint.  I have 7 total acvws plus spare parts in the barn.  The hail dings can be fixed fairly easily.   I can patch the heater channel that's starting to rust, buy some seals/carpet, and pay my friend to shoot it in his shop's paint booth.  I'd guess maybe I'd be in at a max of $5k to have it looking brand new again."

beetle,2c1u5y,FrankiePoops,1 point,Tue Jul 29 15:59:54 2014 UTC,Only when it's in gear. I can't get it out of second
beetle,2c1u5y,FrankiePoops,1 point,Tue Jul 29 16:12:10 2014 UTC,"Have you tried shifting while the motor is off? If that works, then its most likely your clutch is shot and you're just stalling the car by dropping it into second at too low of an rpm range."
beetle,2c1u5y,FrankiePoops,1 point,Tue Jul 29 16:36:49 2014 UTC,What do you mean shifting when thr motor is off.
beetle,2c1u5y,FrankiePoops,1 point,Tue Jul 29 16:50:51 2014 UTC,You can shift gears in a car when the motor is off without using the clutch.   It is a manual right?   Edit: Off as in not running.
beetle,2c1u5y,FrankiePoops,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:23:30 2014 UTC,"Just tried it, shifted butter smooth without the clutch pedal depressed"
beetle,2c1u5y,Holiace,0,Tue Jul 29 17:36:38 2014 UTC,"Sounds like your clutch is out of adjustment and/or shot. If it was a fuel issue / vacuum leak / etc. it would do it anytime you revved the motor, not just while in gear.   Edit: Unless you have some serious engine issues and the motor no longer has enough power to move the car.   Edit 2: Its been awhile so I looked it up, but you should have 3/8"" - 3/4"" of play in the clutch pedal. More or less and the clutch is out of adjustment. http://www.vw-resource.com/clutch_adjust.html"
beetle,2c1u5y,Holiace,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:42:19 2014 UTC,I just drove it for like 10 minutes and had 0 issues. Im really confused
beetle,2c1u5y,Holiace,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:45:29 2014 UTC,That's very strange. I'd still check your adjustment. For the few minutes it takes its a lot simpler than burning out your clutch because it wasn't catching completely.
beetle,2c1u5y,fatalifeaten,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:50:19 2014 UTC,"When you say freeplay, is that when you start to push the clutch in, and the distance you have before resistance? Or is that when you have it depressed and are reengaging it?"

Good guy. give him a call.  Personally, I'd buy the other upgrades first, pedal shaft, and Speed Ball Accelerator Upgrade. will make more of an actual difference in drivability.   I suspect the year distinction is because later master cylinders use 2 pressure switches for the brakes. so if one stops working you still have brake lights. The earlier just have one. so it's good to have a more reliable switch system."
beetle,2c10p1,Cookaacoo,1 point,Tue Jul 29 18:26:19 2014 UTC,"Call the manufacturer and ask.  Personally, I just use ATE OEM brand brake light switches and have no issues.  Get quality parts."

While the original method my not be the best, its been used for 60-70 yrs with no issues. The real issue with old brakes are visibility.  Old wiring + 6 volts = impossible to see.   Either wiring needs fixed or a lot of people are moving to LED brake lights -  which I'm using and it's night and day difference."

beetle,2bv6x5,winewagens,2,Sun Jul 27 17:16:05 2014 UTC,"The breaker in the distributor was set to .4mm, this made it misfire a lot. It's now set to 0.7mm.  The ignition coil started overheating after running for a minute or two so we changed that. all the gaskets were completely shot so we changed all that, now the carb doesn't leak.  All in all pretty much everything was shot. I had to hand it over to a workshop, $180 later they had bought new sparks, set the timing more correctly and so on.  However the idle is still too high and it doesn't like hard acceleration at low rpm's."
beetle,2bv1qr,fwainwright,1 point,Sun Jul 27 15:19:19 2014 UTC,"Fit - probably since the dimensions are essentially the same.  Work - potentially not well due to the filler neck location being different.  It should not really interfere with the hood closing though.  68 fills via a gas door above the passenger fender.  67 you have to open the hood and take the cap off the neck.  Some, if not all, 68s had an oval shaped filler neck that isn't repoped due to progressive refinements.  You would have to just buy a 68-74 aftermarket tank and use it.    Source: owned a 68, now have a 67."

No rear seat, just a piece of wood where the seat would be and a rubber truck mat  -- http://i.imgur.com/3H1e14D.jpg Works great for my two pups, throw a blanket back there and they've got a nice place to ride.  But it'd be a lot more exposed metal to cover.  What I didn't want was a shiny silver sound deadener headliner (with XXX), so I was reluctant to put that up without a way to cover it.    Now that it's up I can tap the roof and get a dull thud instead of a hollow sound.  's nice."

Took it on the highway for the first time since I installed the headliner + sound deadening today and it's significantly better.  Don't have to crank the radio as loud to hear it.  I've got a pair of 6.5"" Pioneers under my rear seat ( http://i.imgur.com/LaeRYOi.jpg ) and a 200W amp.  Your kickpanels look like they'd direct sound better (pretty baja btw); where'd you find those kickpanels?  I didn't see any I liked when I was setting mine up.

Just take it to your local vw shop and have them look at it. I know you don't really want to spend money on having a guy look at it, but if you put the clutch kit in the right way it shouldn't be making that noise. If it's in wrong it will make all kinds of noise. Why don't you drop the engine out and look at the clutch plate. If I remember right the clutch plate, clutch spring, and throw out bearing are in the kit. The plate goes against the flywheel flat side. So the springs on the top are facing the transmission. Then the spring part that bolts to the flywheel then the bearing goes on the transmission shaft flat side towards the back I think. I could be wrong. Well that's a long winded post. Goodnight."

beetle,2bczpr,richcreations,1 point,Tue Jul 22 18:07:51 2014 UTC,"Discounting those, I meant in terms of the curved windshield and padded dash, and maybe I'm wrong but I remember reading somewhere that the reworked front end was a bit stronger."
beetle,2bczpr,Nokarm,2,Tue Jul 22 18:27:02 2014 UTC,The super has the strut front suspension attached the body sheet metal.  An accident even at lower speeds is more likely to tear it apart and/or total the car.  The torsion beam style front ends have a bit more rigidity due to them being mounted to the frame instead of the body.  The later bugs do have a collapsible steering column unlike early ones which can skewer the driver in an accident.    On a bus the front frame was reinforced I believe in around 1973 and later for better crash protection.
beetle,2bczpr,winewagens,1 point,Tue Jul 22 19:00:05 2014 UTC,"no, the old front-end was stronger, by a lot, hence their use in baja."
beetle,2bczpr,richcreations,1 point,Tue Jul 22 18:33:46 2014 UTC,definitely safer.  not all super's have shimmies and its correctable.  meanwhile the older they are the more death trap they are.  older are better if you can take care of it.  as a first car with no experience (no offense to anyone) but thats a bad idea in most cases.

I thought of this due to gameswap and to keep things separated from technical and photo posts.  They'd all be consolidated into one sub.  My understanding is that after 6 months individual threads are archived and locked? If that's the case and they were all kept in one thread in the comments section then that could cause a problem for new submissions past that deadline.

beetle,2aysif,fatalifeaten,2,Thu Jul 17 17:13:30 2014 UTC,"Baja's usually run truck tires and many have suspension mods to extend the track out (plus less interference from the baja fender kits).  Same up front. On street cars, you can get pretty much any width you want, but you're going to have to mod your fenders to clear them once they get wider than about a 245 series tire. Those cars you see with the fat smoothies on them are usually custom widened to about 8"" and then they have to also widen the fenders by a couple inches (you can do it in metal or order 2"" wider fibreglass fenders). Widening steelies is pretty common, and any good fab shop can do the job."

beetle,2aysif,gh0stmach1ne,1 point,Fri Jul 18 03:34:26 2014 UTC,It's mainly totally the fender kits. Mine has no rear fenders so there's nothing to interfere with the 31x10.50s at all. Everything else is bone stock.

I can get away with 225's or even 245's because of the neg. camber I'm running and the fact that '66 swingaxles are shorter than '67 and on (and IRS shafts). The wheels/tires are pulled closer inboard by about an inch. 225's will completely fill up the fenders on a super, and could potentially rub in hard cornering or situations where you bottom the suspension."

beetle,2aumjn,Ilostmypasswordtwice,2,Wed Jul 16 11:39:05 2014 UTC,"Hi all,   I'm relatively new to the /r/beetle Subreddit but I'd like some help if anyone has the time.   I've got an old engine I'm trying to refurb and put back into my beetle for selling. The engine has been outside for a little while and carbs/engine are a little crusty. The engine turns over ok and the valves are still moving so I'm working on the expensive carb-y bits while I clean the engine. I'll post engine pics if anyone's interested too.   The Carbs have been removed (there's two of them, One pictured here though) and I've been soaking them in Parafin for about a week so far. I'm trailing any fixes on just one for the time being but cleaning with a scotch pad and tooth brush has brought the outsides nice and clean but still no movement from the butterfly valves yet.   Anyone have any suggestions how to continue or any good sites to help me progress?   I'll post progress pictures and steps depending on how I get on for anyone else who might be interested.   I think these are webber 45's but not DCOE as far as I know. If anyone knows how to identify them that would be really handy too! Mini Edit. Looks like a 44 IDF Webber + Exploded Diagram of one of these found online too"

There are several products out there, but I don't know what's available in the UK. Then you're probably going to want the parts that have rusted zinc plated, or they'll rust again.  It's probably easier, quicker and more cost effective if you don't have the equipment to do it yourself, to pay someone to rebuild them or just exchange them for an already rebuilt set. If they weren't as bad as they are, then simply cleaning them and replacing the seals is really easy."

Never use the A/C. Let the aroma of the muggy Summer outdoors be your friend. Take a bunch of wire, run way to much voltage through it all, and stuff them somewhere near the dash. Boom.

beetle,2akr5w,mist91,6,Sun Jul 13 10:33:18 2014 UTC,"The 'best' Beetle depends on what you're actually looking for.  If you want a more classic, desirable Beetle 1967 and before are what you're looking for -- and significantly more expensive.  If you just want an aircooled bug to play with the 1968 and on Standards and Supers are great -- and get cheaper as you get newer (the collectors are mostly interested in pre-1968 and, in general, are not at all interested in Supers). You also get a more powerful engine as you get newer, the 1971+ 1600cc DP is nice.  Supers got a number of updates, the most obvious of which is a larger trunk.  It allowed the spare tire to be mounted horizontally instead of vertically (as in a standard) and it greatly increases available storage room.  One of the most important updates was the front suspension change, which will give you better handling if it's in good shape and adjusted correctly (Google Super Beetle shimmy).  If you go to look at one be sure to drive it at highway speed; if it exhibits the shimmy just build that in to the cost of the car in your offer. The 1973+ Supers got a new dash and a curved windshield.  Be very careful about rust on any Beetle you look at.  Some areas are easier to fix than others, all are expensive if you can't weld in patch panels yourself.  Peek under the carpet and look underneath the car, if you see a little rust there's always more to find.  If you find a solid, mostly rust-free car just about everything else can be repaired and/or replaced -- the engine drops free with four bolts. On the engine, make sure all the tin is there.  These aircooled engines need every scrap of tin they rolled off the line with for proper cooling.  I know it varies by state, but in mine (NC) my '70 doesn't need emissions or safety inspections.  Which seems crazy to me, but hey.  Not complaining.  If your state will require it, just make sure the car has passed recently or make it a condition of sale that it will pass."

His Odyssey is close to 130k, but it's had engine mount & transmission problems so who knows if it'll get to 200k. I actually saved that car, he was gone on a trip and it was leaking oil like no tomorrow(drain plug messed up). My mom didn't notice it at all. I caught it right at the fill line.

I either hear praise, or horror stories. Another family friend of mine had the thing in for transmission work twice. Something to do with it's engine that switches from four to six cylinders at cruising speed or something? Apparently it was a real nightmare."
beetle,2a6512,curtquarquesso,3,Thu Jul 10 02:56:20 2014 UTC,"It wasn't actually the transmission, some sort of sensor about the transmission. But yeah my dad was pissed that it's needed like $1400 in repairs already, he's used to more durability than that from honda.   I've posted 2 photos a while ago, but painting is in progress and I've hit some speedbumps. I never intended for the paint to look nice and smooth(I'm rolling it on to give it a rough, unfinished, tough sort of look)but this roller is a real POS. Need to get a new one. Also it's been sitting for a couple of months(I'm still not 16 so I have to have someone drive with me, dads been on a business trip and mom is too scared =D, I started it up pretty often though to keep it in good shape)and the brakes have totally gone. The pedal will stay indefinitely wherever you leave it, and it is hard to move. So I need to get that sorted. Luckily we redid the entire brakes on my dads VW so I know how to troubleshoot it. I'm quite happy with it though. Bought it with the only issue being a shimmy and a weird clutch, fixed the shimmy with brand new tires. Then the clutch got worse and it shakes hard in first gear. Thinking it might be either the engine mounts, clutch, or both. Fortunately both are cheap but you have to pull the engine. And now the brakes, but the engine and trans seem solid, and the body only has one little hole + a few minor holes in the heater channels. Well worth $1000 for a solid engine, body and trans with a bunch of new parts like a carburetor, starter, generator, sway bar, voltage regulator and a bunch more."

The club is long gone, they tend to come and go as people drift in and out. The memories though, I'll have those forever, and tons of photographs to go with them.

beetle,29z2dp,Bermwolf,2,Wed Jul 16 01:54:07 2014 UTC,"UPDATE   Got the Tri-Mil 2 tip ceramic coated muffler today and while it looks good, there are a few disappointing things, all concerning the heat riser tubes.  1-Poor design- the heat riser tubes aren't supposed to pull directly from both of the rear cylinders. On the original exhaust the driver's side riser actually returns to the body of the muffler. http://bobhooversblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/vw-heat-risers-education.html  2-The tubes aren't even drilled out.  3-The mother fuckers are a pain in the ass to drill out. I've broken one drill bit, and ruined two more, all mid to high grade bits, not crap bits. The problem is that to drill the holes you have to do so at an angle that does not give you a solid surface to drill into and the bit wants to walk. I grabbed the dremel tool and a little diamond grinder and made an indention where the hole needs to be and it STILL isn't going well.  I just want this bug running dammit"
beetle,29z2dp,Bermwolf,1 point,Wed Jul 16 01:53:27 2014 UTC,I hate to say this but it sounds like you ordered the one without the proper heat risers. There is a version where the risers are blocked off.....mine didn't come like that :(

Until today, I have never heard of the same fix and now I see there are at least 3 of us!   I have tons of parts boxes and unsuccessfully tried to find my old carb quickly for a pic so I hope you'll trust that perhaps the one distinguishing feature for my rig is that I used a dime from 1966 in honor of my bug, also from 1966.   Regardless, OP, I daily drove my car like that for at least two full years so I concur that this is a legitimate fix to your problem."

They're the ones who mostly provide stuff for Wolfsburg West.   Everything is made right out of their factory in So Cal and everything they have is custom fitted specifically for each vehicle.

In addition, with a stock bug you can be sure that all of the many mechanical parts, from the biggest to the smallest, will perform in the best possible interplay, because they have been designed by German engineers decades ago to do exactly that. There is beauty in a stock Volkswagen!"

I've got 3, and they're all different. My '66 is a resto-custom (stock body with modded suspension and mechanical). The '63 rag will be even more customized, along the lines of the old DRKC cars from around 2000. Show quality looks that will compete all day on the track as well. The '60 will be a pan-off full resto.  My favorite customizations are actually the very subtle ones you don't recognize unless you really know the cars. Things like  rounding the door corners, leading the roof gutter seams for a smother roof line, stuff like that. I also dig old school accessories and mods. Things like Abarth mufflers for splits and ovals, 6v expresso makers, swamp coolers, Judsons, Okrasa stuff, and other vintage speed stuff."

I have both of my bugs insured with them for about $125 a year (I'm over 25, no accidents or tickets). If you're in an accident, they will pay to fix it (assuming its repairable) not just total it out immediately like most insurance companies. They also have roadside assistance and send a flatbed tow truck, which is nice."
beetle,298p51,scubaaron,1 point,Fri Jun 27 18:33:22 2014 UTC,Doesn't Hagerty limit the miles you can drive? He wants to use it as a daily at times.  The top $ tier AAA has saved many folks I know with breakdowns due to the 100 miles of towing.

I'm in BC, Canada and I got my '67 beetle when I was 22 and put regular insurance on it while I waited for collector status to be approved. It was just like insuring a regular car, only I'd say it was cheaper because it's older and parts are relatively easy to come by and cheap.  I now have collector plates on it which runs me about $200 per year; but you can't put collector insurance on a daily driver car (pleasure use only). I think it was maybe $800-900/year with regular insurance.  hope that helps!"

beetle,298p51,danamos666,1 point,Sat Jun 28 09:51:36 2014 UTC,the reason they cant usually quote it is because it falls behind their database of valuations on vehicles.  they run about the same as any small car to insure.
beetle,298p51,winewagens,1 point,Fri Jun 27 14:54:33 2014 UTC,It depends on a myriad of factors.    Before I put my 67 on a collectors policy with State Farm it was around $60 per month if I remember correctly.  Since I only drive them in the summer I now pay that much for six months.
beetle,298p51,winewagens,1 point,Fri Jun 27 15:57:45 2014 UTC,That's not bad as far as price. Are you over 25 though? As I understand insurance rates drop a lot after that age.
beetle,298p51,fatalifeaten,1 point,Fri Jun 27 18:05:22 2014 UTC,Full coverage on my daily SUV dropped ~$10 a month when I turned 25.  So it's not really a giant drop off. I was 25 at the time of having my one bug on a regular premium.
beetle,298p51,fatalifeaten,1 point,Sat Jun 28 00:58:31 2014 UTC,My girlfriend went from paying x amount for liability to paying like x+10 for full coverage when she turned 25.
beetle,298p51,millero,1 point,Sat Jun 28 02:41:07 2014 UTC,"Many insurers will not offer collector policies to anyone under 25, and many collector policies restrict drivers to those over 25, as well as placing restrictions on mileage.  Something else to look out for is that a lot of ""normal"" insurance policies will end up hurting you because of the whole ""car is older than our valuation tools can handle"" thing. Effectively, if you get in a wreck and it's totalled, you'll get a pitiful amount back, because to them the car is worth nothing.  Ask your insurer how their coverage works, and if they offer agreed value policies, which are more like an appraisal and will pay out on the value agreed upon in the event of a total. A/V policies typically cost more and many insurers won't offer them, but they're a better way to protect any money you end up putting into your car. Hagerty does a lot of collector insurance, and they offer policies for folks who DO want to DD their classics. They aren't the only one, but they're usually the one that most people think of for collector car insurance. Most the the ""normal"" insurance carriers offer various plans as well, so check with your insurer and see what they can do for you. Don't be afraid to shop it around if they can't or won't offer you a policy you're comfy with."
beetle,295ssr,pamdb33,1 point,Thu Jun 26 16:28:26 2014 UTC,"Someone on thesamba classifieds should have a used one for way less though shipping may be a hassle.    For less than $140 you can save yourself the headache and just get an internally regulated alternator if it comes down to it.    I sold all mine for $15ea to one guy at a swap meet when I was young and dumb.    www.cip1.ca has them for 124 Canadian.    Edit: also check www.rockauto.com  They have aftermarket alt regs for $40 US or less and shipping to the part of Canada I just sent parts to is $27.  It takes 4 days.  Look for 73 and 74 as your years but watch out because early 73 had generators, at least in the States.  In 75 the internally regulated alt was introduced."

beetle,295ssr,winewagens,1 point,Thu Jun 26 19:27:26 2014 UTC,No problem.  I hope you find one for a reasonable price.   If I hadn't sold all mine about 6 years ago I'd give you one for shipping (had a dozen or so.)    A USPS flat rate medium box to the region of CA I just shipped a bay westy canvas to was ~$47 with a lot of insurance.  The customs form is the short version if the value is under $400.  It's pretty simple to figure out if the local US Postal employee is competent and nice.  I know all of this customs stuff because I asked a friend who sells custom built split bus suspension parts all over the world and followed his advice for what I did.  It takes about 5min to fill out the form.  Normally you can write something along the lines of antique auto restoration parts on the form.  I can check my memory and correspondence with my friend if needed.
beetle,295ssr,curtquarquesso,1 point,Fri Jun 27 03:46:17 2014 UTC,"You mean, like this?  I took it off my '66 when I had an alternator put in. Find out what shipping is, and it's yours for $10. I'm fairly certain it's good. I'll find a way to test it."
beetle,295ssr,winewagens,2,Fri Jun 27 04:07:59 2014 UTC,No.  73/74 alternator regulators have a plug style connection.  Yours is for a generator.  They are very different beasts.

My last two bugs had front disk conversions without beefed up rear pads and adjustments when I got them, so the front wheels braked harder and sooner than the rear, making this tendency even more pronounced."

There's this curve I take most days on the way to school, and it had just rained. I'd been watching my mpg's the week prior, so rather than slowing and taking it in 2nd for extra torque and traction, I took it in 3rd assuming I could still power out of it like I usually do. I ended doing a 180º and nearly flipping the thing. Taking a turn in 3rd really reduces your ability to change your velocity, so now on every turn of a normal radius, I coast into, downshift from 3rd to 2nd, and power out in 2nd."

beetle,294w6f,curtquarquesso,2,Thu Jun 26 16:28:18 2014 UTC,"You can start the drift in two ways, have a good amount of torque and just turn while flooring it, or tap the e-brake to start the slide."
beetle,294w6f,Cagra,1 point,Thu Jun 26 16:44:41 2014 UTC,e-brake still starts the drift even if it's RWD and the handbrake is only hooked the back wheels? Repeating what Curt said.
beetle,294w6f,7cardcha,1 point,Fri Jun 27 02:16:09 2014 UTC,"Yes. To drift AKA powerslide, you need the rear wheels to lose traction. You can do that by adding lots more power (easy with a big engine, or a standard one on a slippery surface - it's easy to make my stock 1300cc Beetle slide on a gravel driveway, in fact it's basically irresistible.)   An alternative way to break traction is using the handbrake (emergency brake on USA). A quick tug on that as you're starting to turn will send a jolt through the back wheels and make them start to slide, then you release the brake and keep the slide going by balancing the amount of power, which is where most of the skill is in sliding.   If you watch videos of rally drivers, they often use the handbrake to break traction so they can take tight corners more quickly.   If you search YouTube for Tiff Niddell and powersliding / drifting, he gives good explanations of different techniques of starting slides. He's an ex-Top Gear presenter and well known in the UK for doing half his car reviews while driving sideways."
beetle,294w6f,tenpastmidnight,1 point,Mon Jun 30 20:28:34 2014 UTC,"Hmm interesting. My dad tried to slide when it was a little icey(tons of snow, a little ice). He couldn't get it to slide at all(he did not use the handbrake, just added a bunch of power downhill and then would jerk the wheel side to side. I guess he should have handbraked. Next time.)The tires were brand new though so maybe that played a part in it."

beetle,2924r9,Team16reddit,1 point,Wed Jun 25 14:23:29 2014 UTC,According to the previous owner it's a '67 body with a baja kit and I found out a super beetle 1600cc dp engine. It's a father son project with my father and this is really my first and favorite classic car. Only had it for a couple of weeks and we already fixed most of the electrical and engine problems and removed a huge subwoofer that was supposed to be a rear seat and replaced it with a rear seat out of what we think is a vw bus. Now we just have to finish up the exterior and put better bucket seats in it and it'll be perfect.

As for the ""banging around"" yes it's 2 inches narrower so the strut towers are going to be very close to if not right against the body. He shouldn't have to clearance for 2"" narrow, that sounds more like a 4"" narrow issue.  Has this guy done this before?

Well it seems the fresh air box was not connected to anything so it was intaking right next to a gas line(this is advice for a super beetle, they have weird lines running back and forth for overflow or something). Stuffed it with rags and gas smell is gone. If you have a super beetle check it out."

Might be cheaper and or more economical long term to try and score an engine on craigslist.   That really sucks, because your bug should get better when you touch it. It does most of the time for me :)  9.25 bar is 134 PSI and 8.5 is 123 PSI. The 8.5 is probably cylinder #3. Good figures but I can't remember if the spread is bad.

Prices vary enough just state by state in my country so I would guess they are way different in Europe. I'm not suggesting your engine is shot or anything, but maybe labor costs are huge in Europe and if you can't fix it yourself you'd be be better off just buying a different  engine(unlikely I'm just pointing out you should consider all options). And maybe you could save a bunch of money if you just keep plugging away at it."

Helped him get it running and get a sound system installed, and decided I wanted one of my own. He knew where there was a '67 in a field that the owner would let go cheap. 250 bucks later I had a project '67, and that included the farmer towing it from his lettuce field to my house. Car didn't run, but it had enough there to be worth putting a little money into in order to get it back on the road. Had to replace the front apron, front fenders and hood, but lucked out in that there was another '67 in a salvage yard that had been in a rear-end collision, so OE hood and fenders were a 50 dollar score. Rebuilt the engine (as a 1641 with a 2bbl carb, 1.25 rockers, 010 distributor that I wish I'd kept, alt, and some funky s/s street exhaust that was crap in retrospect). Interior just needed a good cleaning and a couple  floor mats. Did the brakes and shocks, and rolled it for 2 years. Eventually ended up getting hit while parked at my house by a kid who couldn't drive her daddy's expensive hotrod, and I sold it on. last I knew about it, it had been converted into a baja."

beetle,28x7l5,winewagens,1 point,Tue Jun 24 20:41:42 2014 UTC,"At the time, not at all. When it got hit, it was kind of an oblique t-bone right at the rear driver quarter. The whole rear quarter on the driver side was mangled and the shell wouldn't have been able to be correctly straightened using the tech available at the time (this was 1993). The damage was significant enough that it soured me on the car completely, and I sold it to a friend who parted out the good sheet metal, straightened out the shell as best he could, cut it up, and bolted a baja kit on to it. In my head, it lived on, and so I was OK with that.  Now, If could do it over again today starting from the accident? Not a freaking chance I'd let it get cut up. With current tech, that damage was fixable, for not a lot of money, and '67's in decent shape are getting harder to find."

After I replaced both the alternator pulley and the crank pulley during a minor rebuild I never saw the problem again.  I think it had to do with the alignment.

It'll never go as easy as it goes in the albums you see online because the guy/gal cuts out the boring stuff, or that entire weekend he spent just on a single brake caliper because he a rusted bolt broke off...

beetle,288as1,ArtiSci,4,Sun Jun 15 22:06:24 2014 UTC,"Harbor freight tools.  Buy WD40 (As much as you want, you will need it for a lot of things) a nice hammer : http://www.harborfreight.com/16-oz-claw-hammer-with-fiberglass-handle-60714.html a punch set. Not to punch holes, but to get a hammer blow to hard to reach spaces http://www.harborfreight.com/12-piece-industrial-punch-and-chisel-set-4885.html And when you have these three items you go back and buy more WD40. And no matter how much WD40 Cans you have right now, just double the amount!"
beetle,288as1,FedexSentMeAHead,3,Sun Jun 15 22:27:36 2014 UTC,"Ha,  well in honesty,  if you don't have anything, a simple multiple piece metric craftsman set of tools will do you nicely. Pb blaster is also recommended for anything that you want to make unstuck."
beetle,288as1,NeverPetABurningK9,3,Sun Jun 15 22:15:52 2014 UTC,"I second this advice.   PB Blaster works miracles on rusted frozen parts. Also, spray the seat track/rails and let it absorb for a few minutes. Sit in the back seat and push with your legs.   If it is a bolt, spray it and let it sit for 5 minutes. Loosen it until it gets hard to move, stop and respray. Now, with fresh Blaster on the exposed threads, tighten the bolt a few turns. It should now be easier to extract the bolt farther. You may have to repeat a few times for the same bolt, but once i figured this out this process I never broke another bolt. (The bolts will get hot from friction) Go slow and take your time."
beetle,286j5r,FaultyTowers,7,Sun Jun 15 04:25:57 2014 UTC,"Are you trying to start this like a fuel injected car? This is a carbureted car so you'll need to prime the carb and reset the choke linkage before it can be started. How to do this:   Push gas to floor Hold for half a second Release the gas count to 5 try to start   If you have to pump then attempt to start more than 3 times you probably have something wrong with the fuel pump in the carb. If the car starts but then floods itself or dies then there's probably an issue with the mechanical pump bolted to the engine, dirty filters, or bad idle settings. I don't think you're flooding the engine, if you were it wouldn't start. A flood refers to when there's so much gas in the engine that it won't start. If your car starts it's not flooded.  The best bet is to replace all your fuel filters, drain and clean the gas tank, blow out and replace all fuel lines, and get the carb rebuilt or buy a new one if it's still the original.  Also my 73 always smelled like gas no matter how hard I tried to stop it. Remember there's a bowl on a carb which is really nothing more than a tub of gas with drains (jets) that handle gas delivery. If you have an aftermarket carb, or someone removed the charcoal canister (common) it's going to stink like gas a bit. Make sure nothing leaks and learn to love it.  EDIT: Here's a good picture of the screws you need to mess with on the carb to get it idling correctly  http://members.trainorders.com/android/VW11/34PICT-3IdleAdjustScrews.jpg  Use the guide curtquarquesso linked to adjust  http://www.vw-resource.com/34pict3.html  EDIT 2: IMPORTANT If you notice it's losing gas the fuel line going between the tank and the back could be rotten. If I remember correctly VW runs this inside the hump so it's a real bitch to replace if it is rotten. I'm not 100% on this but you should be able to plug one end then hook up a vacuum pump on the other end and test for vacuum. If it doesn't hold vacuum it's leaking gas into the cabin area somewhere in the hump."
beetle,286j5r,DrCockenstein,1 point,Sun Jun 15 15:28:34 2014 UTC,Honestly I just bought the car today and the previous owners didn't know much about it. How can I check the fuel pressure?
beetle,286j5r,curtquarquesso,0,Sun Jun 15 04:54:43 2014 UTC,"Your carb is likely set incorrectly. Read this: http://www.vw-resource.com/34pict3.html  If a tuning doesn't fix it, you made to give it a good cleaning."

beetle,27upve,Charlie802,2,Wed Jun 11 12:27:50 2014 UTC,"very cool. how hard was the dash to do? I have a 73 that has a ruined dash, this looks like the ticket."
beetle,27upve,skybunny1500,5,Wed Jun 11 16:02:42 2014 UTC,Not to hard all I did was remove the old pad and made patch panels for the defroster vent holes and smoothed everything over. The glove box door was the tricky part. With the original door it stuck out too far and had a big gap between the door and the dash so I ended up cutting the front off of an early door and welding it to the back of the 71s glove box door.

Is this actually in Michigan, or somewhere close?  http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/registry/  But this is good news, because we found older ones!!"

beetle,27uhl3,veedubdan74,1 point,Wed Jun 11 19:01:44 2014 UTC,I wonder if that finish of paint is available anywhere. That semi-gloss is just fantastic. Totally a unique look.

beetle,27qxbm,VWnewbie09,1 point,Tue Jun 10 01:07:10 2014 UTC,sounds like bad splines on one of the rear brake drums (from not properly tightening the 36mm nut)
beetle,27qxbm,richcreations,1 point,Tue Jun 10 01:19:22 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much! I was scared it could be a big transmission issue.  I ran out and double checked, its only the left swing axle spinning.  Most likely a bad spline!"
beetle,27qxbm,Devduino,1 point,Tue Jun 10 01:28:17 2014 UTC,"If you're lucky it's just the splines on the drum that've sheared. If you're unlucky the splines on the axles have gone as well, and replacing them is probably a gearbox out job, not sure how accessible it all is on a buggy. In that case you'll need to work out what size axles you have, short/short, long/short or long/long."
beetle,27qxbm,richcreations,1 point,Tue Jun 10 01:39:05 2014 UTC,"a new axle and drum will likely be needed, not cheap, I had this happen to a bus once."
