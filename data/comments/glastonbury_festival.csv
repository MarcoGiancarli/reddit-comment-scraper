'Hello I am going to talk a lot about something I know nothing about.' I went to Glastonbury A LOT before I moved to the US, my first one I think Elvis Costello and the attractions headlined. Two stages and a lot of not much else. I have watched it grow and change from a (smallish) politically motivated festival, to the massive commercial thing it is now and at no time during it growing and changing and me turning into an old fuck did I ever think 'Oh noes out doors and noise! It's not for me anymore.' TBH Glasntobury is one of the last places left you can feel free of ageism that permeates almost every aspect of music culture."

Deaths at glastonbury are a weird thing, statistically you are much less likely to die at glasto than anywhere else, especially considering the amount of support there is, but with that many people it is bound to happen to someone."

From my minor contact with it over the years there's a few problems I can see. First is that once there is a bit of mess people stop caring and litter more. Second, picking litter in the huge crowds is impossible. Third, even if they could the tractors that go in and pick up the bags can barely cope with what's already there due to the massive crowds. They do their best with a monumental task.  If you go round the less busy areas and looked you'd notice they stay quite nice.  I would point out as well that most of this focus goes on the camp sites and main stages. These places are always going to be minging. If you squeeze 150000 people into that small an area that isn't inherently setup to cope there's going to be mess. These 150000 people have also brought largely disposable goods with them and after a long festival do exactly what you would expect. They leave it behind. Not to defend them too much but only takes each person to leave a little to create a shit storm.  It's easy to sit there in judgemental disbelief and accuse people in general of being disgusting but it's not that clear cut."

Others must of been doing the same, as most bins appeared to be full throughout the day.   The littler is still terrible, but unless they start to ban people bringing in their own booze, and put deposits on cups I don't see how they can stop the destruction. It's shame, and I'm sure most of the Festival goers wouldn't just drop litter in the street. However,  all-day drinking tents to effect people's judgement and behaviour."

I can't suggest any rental companies myself but I know that all the VW companies I looked at had price hikes around that time of year. Like 500-800 per week... So paying for a Glastonbury tipi at £750 might be worth doing instead since you can share that with a bunch of people.

My friends joined me for the start but planned on leaving half way through to make it for Annie Mac. After staying for half an hour 3 of them decided to stay for all of Kanye.  His set list was great. He has so many big songs. The light show was an awesome effect and really added to the ""one man show"" feel. Only problem I had with the show were the long awkward pauses in between songs. Especially when he disappeared for a long two minutes before reappearing back on the cherry picker (which I thought was awesome).   I don't really understand people complaining Kanye couldn't sing, as if they thought he could sing before he started. He used auto tune in the original version of the songs he performed that it only made sense he would do it again then.   The performance was far from perfect but definitely no where near as bad as many of people have claimed. But personally, it just seems to me that it's popular to hate on Kanye"

Kanye fans might have loved it, but as someone who came along hoping for another Jay-Z moment (in 2008 I saw him just to see what happened, and was genuinely blown away), I was left confused and underwhelmed.  By the end he had most of my group laughing at his ridiculous 'greatest rock star' statement.  Like Guns n Roses at Reading in 2010, it was so bad it was very nearly quite good."

Thought id give it a couple of songs and see how it went, ended up watching the whole set. I still dont know what i thought of it, the atmosphere was pretty good where i was (between the soundesks) and he kept me there for the whole set so couldn't have been that bad. Definately more entertaining than the who on sunday, but on reflection it was just average and felt a bit under rehearsed"
glastonbury_festival,3buk9h,mrmazola,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:00:54 2015 UTC,"I really liked it. Could have played a couple more of my favorites but still really enjoyed it. The stopping and restarting was a bit annoying. Out of the two headliners who I saw, The Who and him, I thought he was the better of the two, the atmosphere at Kanye was miles better."
glastonbury_festival,3buk9h,DutchOvenDistributor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"Thought it was amazing. Best set i saw all weekend. Loved it from start to finish, it did dip slightly in the middle though.  The set did nothing to convince haters but for big hip hop fans it was good. All the hate about singing is stupid, the autotune is included in the song in the first place...  The rockstar comment, thats part of who he is and i think he has a perfectly good point with that statement."
glastonbury_festival,3buk9h,LIFTSHIT,-1,Thu Jul 2 19:24:17 2015 UTC,GRANTED i only managed 2 songs. Terrible. He can't sing. And that set up was pretentious.

glastonbury_festival,3buk9h,Thisisnottazbailey,0,Thu Jul 2 10:45:38 2015 UTC,"It seemed really split, the crowd closer to the front seemed to be loving it, but stood near the first row of satellite speakers most people weren't very impressed.  I'm not a fan, and personally thought it was a pretty bad performance with the overuse of autotune and stage mishaps. The crappy bohemian rhapsody bit followed by him claiming he was the biggest rockstar in the world gave everyone a good laugh. The last part was actually kind of entertaining because it was almost like he was parodying himself.  I loved the light setup, and thought going in the cherry picker was amazing. If that had been someone I liked I would have really enjoyed it, and I can see why the Kanye fans would have enjoyed him.  Worst headline I've seen, but I'm still glad I went to give it a try."

glastonbury_festival,3bqr6c,mocoworm,6,Wed Jul 1 11:41:43 2015 UTC,The drugs help the most. The amount of drugs consumed at Glastonbury is so phenomenal that Michael Evis refused to allow a research project to analyse the human waste for drugs and metabolised indications of drugs.  He knows.
glastonbury_festival,3bqr6c,nickryane,4,Wed Jul 1 20:08:38 2015 UTC,Depends on how many Square Pies and Dirty Burgers you eat.

glastonbury_festival,3bqr6c,box_of_scraps,2,Wed Jul 1 15:15:49 2015 UTC,I lost 4.6 kg during the Glastonbury week. Staying out partying til 6am every night probably helped...
glastonbury_festival,3bqr6c,_somebody_else_,2,Wed Jul 1 19:40:20 2015 UTC,That's 9lbs !! Did you eat anything? How is this possible?  3500Kcals is 1lb ... this means you either had a 31500Kcal defecit over 5 days (impossible) or you lost muscle mass and not fat.
glastonbury_festival,3bqr6c,_somebody_else_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:16:18 2015 UTC,"You're not obliged to believe me, but it is what it is!! I weighed nude at 66.6kg the Monday before leaving and 62 on returning Monday night... To be fair, I have been really ill for the past 2 months as well so my digestion/metabolism has been totally out of whack and I had been rapidly losing weight over that period as well.  I'd guess that a lot of the Glastonbury weight loss was due to water mass through dehydration, because I know for a fact I wasn't drinking enough. But I was also eating maybe 1000 kcals per ""day"" (I was up from 9am til around 6/7am every day), which certainly wasn't enough to cover my energy expenditure sitting around in that heat - let alone walking or dancing all night. I wasn't on any drugs either so I was trying to power through my exhaustion to stay out with my pilled-up friends...  Anyway I'm back up to 64kg today (I have been stuffing myself with food and drinking as much as possible over the past few days). I'm normally about 70 so still a way to go to regain my health but on the way upwards :)"
glastonbury_festival,3bqr6c,dellwho,2,Thu Jul 2 15:34:34 2015 UTC,You should be eating way more than 1000Kcals a day. You will definitley be feeling worse if you do that. Hope you feel better soon.

Besides everybody has a baseline metabolism/ weight that it can be really hard to stray from (ie how weight loss or gains can be rapid at first but then slows to a crawl).  The important thing is that you are active and hitting the streets running which is going to do wonders for your health regardless of how much you weigh :)"

Once you have a ticket I would recommend flying out to the UK a few days before the festival and maybe stay in a hotel quite close to the festival, maybe Bristol or London. I wouldn't bother bringing get too much stuff from the US, buy all your camping gear and clothes over here. Then you can sort out how you're getting to the festival, I would suggest a coach as they are quite easy to sort out and quite cheap."
glastonbury_festival,3bqxs9,PlopDropper,2,Wed Jul 1 13:15:37 2015 UTC,"Canadian here. Flew from Toronto for 2013. I bought a tent while over there and brought it back with me (lashed haphazardly to my backpack). Spent a week and a half in Belgium/London beforehand. Other than the obvious overpacking that was necessary, I wouldn't say there was any hardship. Packing smarter next time would eliminate some weight. Like the bare minimum of clothes, gear, etc. I left my passport and some other valuables in a lockbox in my hostel as well. Didn't want to bave that go missing.  The ticket buying was a damn hassle even then. Stayed up late, and the site continuously crashed. F5 key took a beating that night, but I secured tickets fornmyself and two friends. As others said, they sell out in moments, so be prepared to fill shit out in a hurry.  Also, the bus trip from London is shit, I would recommend finding another option if possible."

glastonbury_festival,3bqxs9,Reflekting,2,Thu Jul 2 08:30:55 2015 UTC,"Just got back from my first Glastonbury, I'm from California. A few tips: -it makes more financial sense if you do more than just the fest in Europe. Spend a week in England, take the train to Paris, etc. I'm backpacking Europe right after the festival. -agreed on whoever said buy your camping gear once you get here. -read all the info online about getting tickets! I got mine in the spring resale but that seems to be pretty rare. I made plans to be in Europe and left the weekend of Glasto open. That being said ABSOLUTELY DO IT!!! Worth every penny. I've been to all the U.S. fests you mentioned and glasto is a million times better. :)"
glastonbury_festival,3bqxs9,brochella14,2,Wed Jul 1 21:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'm from Canada, but I luckily got my first ever Glasto tickets in 2013. We brought a tent from home, but other than that packed pretty light. We stayed in London for a week afterwards, but we flew over to London from Toronto on the Monday, stayed in a hotel on Tuesday night near Paddington Station so it was easy to get to the train on Wednesday morning.   Getting tickets was pretty hard, but we expected that. I think we got them like 15 minutes before they sold out.  We were trying for tickets this year, but we missed out by seconds."
glastonbury_festival,3bqxs9,BautistaBomb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"How hard is it to get tickets?   You need to pre-register online and then you can purchase them usually on the first Sunday of October. The amount of people who try and get tickets means most people don't even get through to the ticket purchase page, I think this year all 150k tickets sold out within 20 minutes. So good luck!"

glastonbury_festival,3binmd,Tjgibbs,2,Mon Jun 29 18:05:59 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the entire cleanup is done with people who worked there for their tickets. A popular option for students!
glastonbury_festival,3binmd,HawkUK,4,Tue Jun 30 09:25:29 2015 UTC,"Good:   Jack Garratt - didn't expect to be so blown away by a 5 song set early on Sunday by a guy I'd barely heard before but he was the highlight. Wolf Alice - such a great band. Grandmaster Flash - although 1 hour was way too short. Skepta - I'm not even a Grime fan but it was insane in there. Matthew and Me Sleeping mask + earplugs General good vibes all around.   Bad:    It's just way too fucking busy everywhere all of the time. Seemed like whenever I wasn't watching bands, I was in queue somewhere. Took me 40 minutes to get away from the stage after Kanye. A guy in front of me at Flyiong Lotus Facetimed his mate to show himself doing MDMA. What a dick!   Ugly:   The state of my feet after 5 days of standing up. Jesus Christ, I was in agony this morning."

glastonbury_festival,3binmd,ox_,3,Wed Jul 1 08:42:37 2015 UTC,"The Good: Hot Chip and Caribou were fantastic. The Bad: fucking queues everywhere in the SE corner. Thought we'd try out the secret piano bar. Not so secret, another queue to get in. Just too many people and queues. The Ugly: saw a fight break out at the stone circle between some pretty sketchy looking guys. Not cool."
glastonbury_festival,3binmd,lhommedeverre,2,Mon Jun 29 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"The Good - Some really good stuff all over the site, I find it hard to pinpoint any exact moment where I went 'WOW' but there were no moments where I thought I would want to be anywhere else.  The Bad - People peeing over the floor, I saw a girl pee next to a cube @ the old cubehenge only for one poor unsuspecting guy to sit in it about a minute later.    The Ugly - Crush into Kanye after Pharrell was pretty terrible, as was the set that went before it."

glastonbury_festival,3binmd,erics75218,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think during the sets were a problem. I saw people peeing up in silver hayes area, inside the fence at urinals but not into the actual urinal (its not hard). I don't think people appreciate it could really shut the festival down. Then they would be sorry."

glastonbury_festival,3binmd,limegreen1992,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:36:35 2015 UTC,"The Good- The Cabaret tent was incredible this year. Lots of good stuff with only a couple of meh performances.  The Bad- Having to walk for 45 minutes to get from the campervan field to the site. But saying that I had busted my knee before arriving.  The Ugly- Saw a lot more twattish behaviour this year from people. Barging into people, peeing right next to the toilets, throwing stuff on the floor, etc."
glastonbury_festival,3binmd,wildeaboutoscar,2,Tue Jun 30 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there were quite a few knobheads there this year compared to previously. Saw loads of people pissing right next to the urinals too - couldn't they wait 30 seconds??!"
glastonbury_festival,3binmd,thesonglessbird,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:38:51 2015 UTC,"The good - agree on FFS, and thought Everything Everything have discovered a new level of showmanship. Also really enjoyed a Q&A with Steve Lamacq and Danny Goffey up in the Crow's Nest yesterday morning.   The bad - I know he's divided opinion, but I went along to Kanye with an open mind and hoping for a Jay-Z moment. I thought his show was terrible, aside from the first ten minutes or so. It was completely disjointed and confused.   The ugly - the litter. I thought it was a little better this year, but still not good enough."

glastonbury_festival,3bfl7v,Yeah-BUDDY,0,Mon Jun 29 13:20:10 2015 UTC,I hated that they did that  but at the same time I feel like Kanye deserves it because he is a total megalomaniac imbecile. He needs to humble down a bit.
glastonbury_festival,3bfl7v,SlaveAmbient,2,Mon Jun 29 13:32:43 2015 UTC,Imagine someone took a tape that you had privately filmed with a partner and leaked it and then years later someone turned it into a flag and displayed it to millions globally. Bit much I think.   Not to forget that there are a lot of children at the festival. Think it was too personal but not at all towards Kanye. It doesn't effect him in any way.
glastonbury_festival,3bfl7v,SlaveAmbient,0,Mon Jun 29 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"in fact I didn't say that I agree with what they did, poor taste at best, what I said is that him being the cunt he is, he deserves it, he deserves a little humiliation, he actually needs it to get off that pedestal he's put himself on."
glastonbury_festival,3bfl7v,LIFTSHIT,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"Do you think he even noticed?  They only pedestal he is on is one that has been set up for him.  He is no different from the Jagger, Presley or Lennon of his time."

Super furry animals were excellent as well, django django ""secret"" gig up the crows nest was good but a little too busy and their John peel tent set was unreal."

We were all going ballistic down the front. But the buzz seems to have been negative.  He completely surpassed all my expectations.
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,diracnotation,6,Mon Jun 29 12:55:51 2015 UTC,"It seems fans loved it and everyone else hated it. Im glad he went this route though, he has nothing to prove and why should he pander to people who dont like him?  /r/hiphopheads seem to have responded very positively to the performance."
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,LIFTSHIT,6,Mon Jun 29 13:46:56 2015 UTC,Had a really good start was then the middle dropped a bit (should have brought on a guest I think) and then end good so overall just a bit better then OK but not great for me
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,limegreen1992,3,Mon Jun 29 15:38:20 2015 UTC,He had Justin Vernon as a guest for quite a few songs.
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,SlaveAmbient,4,Mon Jun 29 17:10:16 2015 UTC,I wanna give the camera crew mad props. They were working with an exceptionally difficult set up with all of those lights and yet they managed it. The Pyramid camera crew in general were exceptional this year. Some shots during Florence's set were like they were straight out of National Geographic.

glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,Mr_Rottweiler,6,Mon Jun 29 10:20:01 2015 UTC,"The lights and smoke are part of the performance.  Bad lip synching, did lip sync?  I didnt feel the technical hiccups were too bad, then again im a big fan of the guy, was near the front and surrounded by fans who were also up for it.   Im sure people will have different opinions but he definitely met and exceeded my expectations. Great performance."
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,LIFTSHIT,-7,Mon Jun 29 10:23:23 2015 UTC,The lights and smoke are part of the performance.   You couldn't hardly see any of his performance. He might as well have sat in a black box in the middle of the stage.
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,Mr_Rottweiler,9,Mon Jun 29 10:27:57 2015 UTC,"Did you not see him on the cherry picker?  Regardless, we probably just have different opinions on what makes good showmanship. I liked it."
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,LIFTSHIT,2,Mon Jun 29 10:30:14 2015 UTC,"Twin Atlantic smashed it, was probably most surprised by them! However, being at the very front barrier for Florence just absolutely made it for me, incredible weekend."

glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,Conorrrrrrrrrrb,2,Mon Jun 29 16:25:05 2015 UTC,Hinds was a great start to the music half of my first glastonbury. Great fun but also strong musicians. Nice harmonies that didn't take themselves too seriously.

I've watched the Anthology, and some books and based on that, they've got the whole Beatles period dynamic spot-on.  And I blubbed during Hey Jude."

glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,FanOfFlan,2,Mon Jun 29 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"Kanye was possibly the most immense of all acts I've seen live. Was surrounded by some really great people in the crowd which really made it special, everyone having a sick time together. Raleigh Ritchie killed it on Gully stage, only got to see the second half of his set though because Jamie T was too good to miss. Run The Jewels were great and; as if it needed to be said, Lionel got everyone dancing!"
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,TornadoHorse,4,Tue Jun 30 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"Highlights from my sofa,   Florence, Clean Bandit, the Chemical Brothers and Lionel all excellent in their own way.  No new really stunned me this year (though Slaves were good, and what 8 saw of Hoozier was good too) so not a classic Glastonbury for me.  Kanye really more ego than talent on Saturdays showing. He has a lot of good material, but very poor vocally and while the lighting rig was pretty damn spectacular, it needed a bit more variety, and dare I say some humility to accept he needed something/someone else on stage to carry such a big gig.(I say this in the sure knowledge that I run the risk of his devotees down voting me to death!)"
glastonbury_festival,3bfr9d,TheFatNo8,2,Sun Jun 28 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"Having missed Motorhead in Plymouth it was awesome to see them live, fantastic set. I stumbled across a band called Mad Apple Circus playing on the small stage in the theatre field and bought their album after their set as they were awesome. Caught the last couple of songs from Frank Turner in Leftfield, although I work in a stall 100 yards behind anyway, that was awesome. Beans on Toast was epic, ran into him by West Holt and he let me get a picture which was amazing.    10/10 will work again next year."
