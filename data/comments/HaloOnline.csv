HaloOnline,3e3itv,iwiggums,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:21 2015 UTC,That's cool! Glad to see added functions to forge.
HaloOnline,3e3itv,Jasper250,6,Tue Jul 21 20:01:51 2015 UTC,Yeah this is gonna cause way too many problems. You should have just sent me those tags. Now this is gonna split the community. People are going to create maps with this mod then when an official update adds these kinda things their maps will no longer function.
HaloOnline,3e3itv,Gamecheat13,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:41 2015 UTC,"If it does split the community, it will probably only be until a new update is released, right?"
HaloOnline,3e3itv,Goatandbanjo,3,Wed Jul 22 01:19:27 2015 UTC,Yes but then people are gonna be bitching because their maps no longer work.
HaloOnline,3e3itv,Gamecheat13,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:20:10 2015 UTC,Shouldn't you make a post about this issue to let people know so there is less bitching?
HaloOnline,3e3itv,Jasper250,3,Wed Jul 22 01:28:56 2015 UTC,Doing that now.
HaloOnline,3e3itv,Gamecheat13,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"Why not look at adding this then? It needs a small amount of fix up, but it makes custom maps some a little more feasible."

HaloOnline,3e0fy1,Lurking4Answers,16,Tue Jul 21 02:11:14 2015 UTC,It looks even worse than Halo 4 armor in my opinion.
HaloOnline,3e0fy1,Alan150003,14,Tue Jul 21 02:20:26 2015 UTC,"It's too aesthetically busy. Too many things going on. If you look at older Halo armor, the best stuff had this feeling of ""it wasn't made to look cool, but it turned out looking cool anyway"". This stuff is clearly just made to look cool, with no rhyme or reason for any of it. Even Bionicles didn't look that ornate, and their gimmick was fucking MASKS. (Not hating on Bionicles, love those things)"
HaloOnline,3e0fy1,Lurking4Answers,2,Tue Jul 21 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love the beauty of form from function. I love it when something looks like it was designed for a specific function or solve a specific problem or accomplish some goal. I hate superfluous design that adds no function or accomplishes anything.  I loved the H3 armor designs and many of the designs in BL:R because they all had a design that looked like it was supposed to do something.  These armor designs just seem ""lets tack on lights, edges, and shit till it looks cool""  I think these are more ornate than many of the Warframes."
HaloOnline,3e0fy1,CToxin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:08 2015 UTC,"I think these are more ornate than many of the Warframes.   Y'know, at first I was like ""I've seen some pretty ornate looking Warframes, I think this guy might be wrong."" But then I went and looked around, and even the most ornate looking Warframes still had that ""form from function"" air about them. I've heard people say that modern Halo armor sets look like toys, and I really see what they mean now."

HaloOnline,3e0fy1,94CM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:36 2015 UTC,You just summed up exactly how I feel about it. Even looking back at Halo Reach (which had great armor if I say so myself) the armor is so geometrically simplistic. It's streamlined and minimal like real armor would be.
HaloOnline,3e0fy1,Alan150003,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:11 2015 UTC,"Well hey, at least it has the normal cock piece still.   I really do miss full Spartan armor though. :/ R.I.P"

HaloOnline,3dzmti,Hohshua,5,Mon Jul 20 21:58:50 2015 UTC,Permission to add it to This?
HaloOnline,3dzmti,A13x231,2,Mon Jul 20 23:28:32 2015 UTC,Go ahead.
HaloOnline,3dzmti,A13x231,2,Tue Jul 21 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Your name will go somewhere, and you'll be the file author :)"
HaloOnline,3dzmti,devDorito,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:22 2015 UTC,Well done. This looks like a blast to play.
HaloOnline,3dzmti,Belsfir,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:51 2015 UTC,"There were some spots where the humans could jump off and get on the cliff side edge, making it hard for the zombies to get to them."
HaloOnline,3dzmti,oArctic,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:02 2015 UTC,If you sprint and jump at a perfect spot you can get around the teleporters and out of the map. They need to fix that.
HaloOnline,3dzmti,Hohshua,2,Mon Jul 20 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"After spawning so many teleporters, the teleporters stop actually working. Waiting for some new (bigger) items to be added to help fix this issue."
HaloOnline,3dzy9o,A13x231,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:53 2015 UTC,So what does this mean for us who have not played Destiny? I'd imagine we are many here.
HaloOnline,3dzy9o,Descatusat,4,Mon Jul 20 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"Basically Destiny gametypes have a scoring system that rewards assists, melees, grenades, basically non standard kills.  Control is a gametype in which players contest 3 zones, capturing zones scores points. Killing also scores points.  Salvage is a bit like KoTH mixed with territories.  Clash is 6 v 6  Combined Arms is Control with vehicles, more power weapons etc.  Rumble is free for all. 6 Players.  Inferno is basically no radars, only basic kills score.  Doubles Skirmish is 2v2 with Revives (probably won't get it working fully).  Skirmish is the above with 3v3  Rift is like a fast moving CTF  Mayhem is lots of power weapons  Elimination is 3v3, 5 rounds, revives, no respawns."
HaloOnline,3dzy9o,Descatusat,4,Mon Jul 20 22:28:02 2015 UTC,"What a cool dude taking the time to write this. I was kind of jokingly asking and fully expecting a ""Google it dumbass"" response. Lol. Sounds pretty awesome though. Very much looking forward to it."
HaloOnline,3dzy9o,PATXS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"Nice, haven't played destiny but this sounds like an awesome idea for H:O! Will you make another post here when you release it? Cause I've been finding gamemode after gamemode, and even messing around with my own custom settings, and when I finally port forward(I won't be at home for a while so I can't right now), I'll be hosting lots of variety stuff, to take a break from all the games that are already being hosted and that we all already play a lot.  Also, are there actual revives in this game? I haven't seen any in the forge menu and stuff, but I'll wait and see.  Also, I would love a proper fast moving CTF, instead of just increasing run speed. Changed placements, etc."
HaloOnline,3dzy9o,Hohshua,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:00:22 2015 UTC,This made me be thinking about how to make a League of Legends sorta thing (Summoners Rift) but I wonder what to do for the towers and nexus though...
HaloOnline,3dzy9o,PATXS,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:38 2015 UTC,LoL
