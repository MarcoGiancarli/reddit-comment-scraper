orioles,3e3jt3,Limond,4,Tue Jul 21 21:01:27 2015 UTC,Anything down on the farm.
orioles,3e3jt3,TheBaltimoron,7,Tue Jul 21 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about him for 2016.  He won't be cheap, but cheaper than other OF options like Upton/Heyward.  Facts are, we will have money to spend in 2016.  Davis, Wieters, Chen, O'Day, Pearce gone, trade/release Matusz/Hunter and thats what, almost 30-35 millionish freed up?  I kmow arb raises and all, but we should still have lots of cash on hand."
orioles,3e3jt3,romorr,14,Tue Jul 21 18:57:48 2015 UTC,god I hope angelos at the LEAST pays for O'Day. :(
orioles,3e3jt3,dkannen,4,Tue Jul 21 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"The thing that worries me is, why haven't we signed him yet to an extension?  He has been great for us, so why let him get to FA where some one might overpay him?  Of course, he could be looking for Andrew Miller money, but I can't really say for sure, just speculation really.  Real quick, maybe O'Day is waiting to see what we do with all our FAs before re-signing?  Another bad offseason and the Orioles will look like a 4th place team reallly fast."
orioles,3e3jt3,romorr,3,Tue Jul 21 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"I am incredibly worried about what Peter Angelos will do. I have zero faith in him opening up the pocket book for anybody. We only ever do well because Duq and Buck are incredible at making due with what they have. If we had a less thrifty and conservative owner, we'd be much better competitors in my opinion."
orioles,3e3jt3,chiv,6,Tue Jul 21 19:24:05 2015 UTC,Mark Cuban pls
orioles,3e3jt3,chiv,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:46 2015 UTC,Mark Cuban would be a dream for the O's! Or a nightmare. I dont know which. Essentially I want the pocket book and the passion for the game but still want Duq and Buck to manage the team without any owner interference.
orioles,3e3jt3,chejrw,4,Tue Jul 21 20:18:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't realize that Cuban was making personnel decisions for the Mavs, only thought that he was used to recruits players during FA. Honestly, I would love to be a part of an organization that has passion from the top down."

orioles,3e3jt3,owlbrain,4,Tue Jul 21 19:01:39 2015 UTC,So what do we give up for him?
orioles,3e3jt3,TheBaltimoron,5,Tue Jul 21 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"I know, right? Like who the fuck do we have that somebody would want and we would be willing to part with?"
orioles,3e3jt3,romorr,10,Tue Jul 21 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"""Listen Tigers, your bullpen sucks. Anyone is better than what you've got. That's why we're willing to package Hunter and Matusz for Cespedes. You know what, we'll even throw in Bud Norris. You can use him in the bullpen or even as a replacement for Verlander."""
orioles,3e3jt3,chiv,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:27 2015 UTC,I thought you meant Hunter Harvey at first.
orioles,3e3jt3,romorr,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:42 2015 UTC,Verlander is a high-priced unreliable mopup man. And I don't mean the bullpen kind. I mean the back of house kind.
orioles,3e3jt3,G_I_Joe_Mansueto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:18 2015 UTC,Id have to think Sisco and 1 of Wright/Davies/Wilson/Givens would get it done.
orioles,3e3jt3,cptcliche,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:54 2015 UTC,I doubt we give up Sisco with the possibility of losing Wieters after this season.
orioles,3e3jt3,romorr,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"Well, there are dobuts he sticks at catcher. He also didn't start catching till senior year, so he is at least 3 years away if he sticks at catcher."
orioles,3e3jt3,serasarahhhh,0,Tue Jul 21 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"There has to be some combination of bullpen help and prospects that could get that done.   Considering Avilla is hitting a cool .190, and they're occasionally starting a first baseman hitting .130, they have to have some desire for catching or first base help.  So....some combination of Brach, Hunter, Clevenger, Joseph and Walker?"
orioles,3e3jt3,RawHamful,2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:54 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that we're gonna need catching and first base help next season.
orioles,3e3jt3,simply_there,2,Tue Jul 21 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"You are giving junk for a good player.  Brach is decent/good, but no way the Tigers give up Cespedes for any combination of those players.    If the Tigers sell, they are punting 2015, so why would they need first base help?  Also, McCann is their catcher, so doubt they are looking for help there.  Hunter, with his salary is DFA material next year, so why trade for him and pay millions of dollars?  With the second wild card now, more teams are technically in it, so its a sellers market.  Cespedes will cost either ML talent or prospects, like Reyes, HH, Cisco."
orioles,3e3jt3,slinkymaster,2,Tue Jul 21 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think we need Brach too much as a long reliever, and he's been really good this year.  And there's no way we get rid of Joseph when we're probably going to lose Wieters.  But any of the rest, plus maybe another pitching prospect from the minors?"
orioles,3e3jt3,itsernst,3,Tue Jul 21 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"He isn't young. He's 29. He's also the kind of player that makes flashy and impressive plays that stick out in your memory- Huge HRs, cannon arm- but in the day to day he isn't a star contributor."
orioles,3e3jt3,I_am_the_birds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't help but wonder if all the trades are more about him or the need to find the right situation.  EDIT: Obviously free agency is a factor this time around, so maybe I'm reading too much into things."

orioles,3e3jt3,chiv,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:46:03 2015 UTC,I don't want this to happen but what do you all think the chances are that we end up trading Davis for him? I think with Davis' agent and his past few years that we won't be able to resign him at the price that other clubs are going to offer. I wouldn't be suprised to see management try to get ahead of the 8 ball there.
orioles,3e3jt3,TheBaltimoron,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:06 2015 UTC,Nice idea but Detroit has zero interest in Davis.
orioles,3e3jt3,chiv,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"That ends up not fixing our outfield situation though. He's played well in right field, passing stat tests and the eye tests. We get one outfielder back for (what is currently) another."
orioles,3e3jt3,PrimeImplicant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:51 2015 UTC,Could end up being a four player deal or something though like how Cespedes ended up in Boston IIRC. O's could trade say Davis and a pitcher for Cespedes and an OF and move one of our many flavor of the months in OF to 1st base?
orioles,3e3jt3,chiv,4,Tue Jul 21 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"We're not giving up Davis to get Cespedes.  That makes no sense.  EDIT: Both players are free agents at the end of the year, and both are playing corner outfield spots.  We wouldn't sell Davis to get Cespedes as there's no gain for us, and the Tigers have no interest in acquiring Davis as he'll leave at the end of the year.  Makes no sense."
orioles,3e3jt3,PrimeImplicant,0,Tue Jul 21 19:39:10 2015 UTC,not giving up Davis to get Cespedes. That makes no sense.   I sincerely hope you are right.
orioles,3e3jt3,slinkymaster,7,Tue Jul 21 19:39:02 2015 UTC,"A team will not trade for Davis if they are in ""sell"" mode. They are looking for prospects to rebuild. Davis is in his contract year. It indeed makes zero sense."
orioles,3e3jt3,romorr,0,Tue Jul 21 20:00:31 2015 UTC,I agree with you mostly. Part of that Cespedes deal between Oakland and Boston included a contract year Jon Lester though.

Something needs to change, but who knows what.  I think it's really up to what we have on the field now to pull this season off.

Sisco is nice, but there are lots of doubts about his ability to stick at C.  Reyes is nice, but so, so far away.

Thing is even with 2 or 3 wins here I can't seem to justify making a big move. Of all the names floating about I suppose I'd take Jay Bruce but how long is he under team control?

Ray Lewis, for example, was one of the greatest to take the field. He was also the emotional core of the team for so many years. Gino Marchetti was amazing, but he was never the vocal core of the Colts. Nick Markakis was a leader, but he was the opposite of Jonesy's more outgoing style as a public face."

orioles,3dvcma,romorr,7,Sun Jul 19 21:12:24 2015 UTC,Who do they move tho?
orioles,3dvcma,eternallurker,9,Sun Jul 19 21:56:30 2015 UTC,"Orioles?  Depends on what SD wants really.  Upton will be desired by a lot of teams, so the asking price will be really high.  Do they take Bundy or HH?  Both are promising, both are hurt.  Do they take quanity over quality?  Sisco or Reyes with 2 of our pitchers that are close to the ML, like Wilson/Wright/Davies.  I am very against Sisco being moved, he could be a C who hits .300 with great patience at the plate with discipline.  Every scout I read talks about his ability to hit, and hit well.  Personally I don't think we have the starting pitching to win the WS, so we shouldn't be making big moves for players like Upton.  Our farm is shit, and it would take 2 of our best prospects to get Upton.  Edit: This is why I love Sisco so much, look at his age, the level hes at, and the K/BB ratio.  I have doubts he sticks at catcher though, but there is no reason to move him yet to RF/LF.  On the 20/80 scouting scale, his hit tool is 60.  Basically means he should hit .300 at the ML level.  With his eye, that probably means a .380ish OBP as well.  http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=sisco-000cha"
orioles,3dvcma,romorr,8,Sun Jul 19 22:02:11 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm of the mindset that they should be prepared to be sellers depending on wjere they stand at the end of the month.

orioles,3dvcma,eternallurker,7,Sun Jul 19 22:18:01 2015 UTC,"Thats kind of the way I lean too, though these next 6 games will be telling.  I rather trade Wieters, Chen, Davis than get a QO for them.  Add on our bullpen and we can rebuild/retool for a push in 2017."
orioles,3dvcma,romorr,5,Sun Jul 19 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind buying or selling. Even though the team as we see it right now doesn't really look like a contender, you just don't know if the team will be better a year or two from now with guys like Walker, Alvarez, Wright, Wilson, and Davies on the team. It's still up in the air at this point.  On the other hand, we've seen many players on the current team contribute to great seasons for the O's. And it's our last shot with them. So if there's ever a time to trade a lot for a half season rental, it's now"
orioles,3dvcma,SimplyAJB,8,Sun Jul 19 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"That kind of thinking dooms teams for years.  Orioles need to be smart, and think past this season.  We could sell on 3 players that have Boras as their agent, get some decent pieces on the cheap, make some nice signings in the offseason and be ready to compete again in 2017.    As far as those 5 players you mentioned, not a one of them is exciting in any way.  I see a bunch of 4s and 5s with a 4th OFer and a backup 1B/DH."
orioles,3dvcma,romorr,6,Sun Jul 19 22:54:07 2015 UTC,I could be wrong here but I'm not seeing the value of bringing in Upton. His numbers are average and the Padres are going to want some quality prospects. I hope this is nothing more than a rumor

But that's just so crazy to contemplate. I want Manny in an Oriole uniform for life. He sure seems like a once in a generation type player. It's gonna be awful rough though to carry that contract.

If he stays healthy for the next 2 years then he's 100% worth 200 mil but with surgery on both knees by the time he's 23, I really think he'd have to take lesser money if he wants the security of an extension now."
orioles,3dufhq,BaltimoreBirdGuy,7,Sun Jul 19 18:45:18 2015 UTC,I think it's about time we try to buy out at least 2 of his free agent years. He'll be arbitration eligible this offseason.
orioles,3dufhq,I_am_the_birds,2,Sun Jul 19 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"what do you mean by buy out his free agent years exactly? I understand the basics of arbitration but it still confuses me time to time, haha"
orioles,3dufhq,I_am_the_birds,5,Sun Jul 19 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"A recent trend is to give players more money during what would be their arbitration years in exchange for some of the years after arbitration that they would become a free agent.  Take for example, Mike Trout's extension. He was due to be arbitration eligible at the end of last season and due to become a free agent after 2017, but they gave him 6 years, 144.5 million, which included 3 free agent seasons. So for his arbitration years, he got 6 million, 16 million, 20 million, and for those three free agent years, he's going to get 34 million each year. So an extension like that for Machado:  16: 5 million 17: 15 million 18: 20 million 19: 30 million 20: 30 million    Now, I am no expert on player value, so this 5 year, 100 million deal may be too low. But you can see how he's getting more money than he would in arbitration and similar money to what he would in free agency. Both sides have to examine the position they're in. Manny would probably like to become a free agent in his 20s still, and the Orioles probably don't want to give it ALL away for a player with 2 knee surgeries behind him at 23.   It's hard though. Some projections are suggesting that Manny will be behind only Trout in production over the next several years. As I said, that would be a hypothetical guideline. I think he could be getting an average of 2-4 million more per years."
orioles,3dufhq,owlbrain,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Instead of going through the arbitration process for the next three years (each side submits a salary for the season, an arbitrator picks one of them) you could agree to a multi-year contract. That's called buying out arbitration years. So if we give Manny a 7 year deal this off-season. We would have bought out his three arbitration years, and would have gained 4 more years of control."

IMO the games we play against them almost feel line exhibition games just because it feels like s forced rivalry and MLB does it just because the cities are so close. I feel more rivalry with my friends who are nationals fans rather than the team itself.   Not to mention, a Nats v O's World Series would be glorious."

Here's the thing though, I can easily defend my support of the Nationals because they're in the National League and are rarely in direct competition with the Os'...but if the 2 were ever to meet in the WS, I'm afraid it would spoil all of that.  Over a 7 game World Series round, rivalries would intensify greatly...too much animosity grows from these situations...and heaven forbid the Nats were to beat the O's in a WS, it would definitely be impossible to continue rooting for them."

First, its a league where TV revenue can make or break a team's ability to pay for talent, and the Nats are trying to cut ours in half (despite already having a massive payroll).    Also, its symbolic of how Baltimore perpetually seems to be an afterthought in professional sports.  They told us to ""just root for the Redskins"" when the Colts left, and then once we finally got a successful football team, they had to go give DC a giant fucking existential threat to the one consistent piece of Baltimore's modern History, because clearly, DC couldn't just root for the Orioles, right?

First, its a league where TV revenue can make or break a team's ability to pay for talent, and the Nats are trying to cut ours in half   It's a fair point to some extent, though many would argue that the Orioles claim to such a large TV market was a privilege they held for years, but not necessarily a right (especially in such a densely populated area).    This is a tough one for me to choose a side with because frankly I hate the way MLB classifies ""home teams"" and blackout areas to begin with.  I don't believe that either team's payroll should have anything to do with it, but I agree that the Nats shouldn't whine about a TV rights arrangement that they agreed to when they moved in.   Also, its symbolic of how Baltimore perpetually seems to be an afterthought in professional sports. They told us to ""just root for the Redskins"" when the Colts left, and then once we finally got a successful football team, they had to go give DC a giant fucking existential threat to the one consistent piece of Baltimore's modern History, because clearly, DC couldn't just root for the Orioles, right? It's a bit of insecurity, but I think it's somewhat justified.   Who are ""they""?  I really don't see how a Washington baseball team is any threat to the Orioles existence.  For most of the 20th century, Washington has had a baseball.  2 franchises have already left DC...they seem to be the ones that can't hold onto team.  Personally, I think both cities have the ability to support their own teams."

orioles,3dspd5,clipperw2014,19,Sun Jul 19 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"GOOD CHOICE! First, welcome to our sub. Second, look on the main page of /r/orioles and click the wiki button up top to see our visitors guide. That has some of what you want to know. Now, here's what I think you should know.  Recent history: After a couple playoff appearances in the late 90s (protip: look up Jeffrey Maier and Armando Benitez if you want to have your heart broken) and a messy split with then-skipper former Oriole Davey Johnson, the Orioles went into a 15-year tailspin. We lost with Ray Miller as manager, with Mike Hargrove, with Lee Mazilli, Sam Perlozzo and Dave Trembley.  Our GMs included the late Syd Thrift, whose infamous 2000 fire sale sent fan favorites B.J. Surhoff, Mike Bordick and Harold Baines among others out and brought in a bunch of lottery tickets, one of whom turned out to be the pretty good infielder Melvin Mora. There was also the two-headed GM of Jim Duquette and the late Mike Flanagan. Someone somewhere thought that was a good idea and yes, he's related to the Duquette we have now.  Then came Andy MacPhail, who engineered heists to get J.J. Hardy, Adam Jones, Chris Tillman and made other quiet deals and drafts and signings and hired us a new manager, one of our best: Buck Showalter.  He left at his contract's end to tend to family matters (he's now the president in waiting for the Phillies) and enter Dan Duquette. Buck has mellowed since the Yankees days, but his baseball mind is sharp as it always was, and meshes pretty well with Duquette's penchant for dumpster diving. Using the pieces MacPhail put in place and supplementing them with hidden gems like Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez, we got a wild card spot and advanced to the ALDS in 2012, where we were beaten by the Yankees in five games.  The Orioles have remained competitive since, making it to the ALCS against the Royals last year powered by slugger Nelson Cruz and career years from UTIL Steve Pearce, pitcher Chris Tillman and others. This despite missing catcher Matt Wieters (Tommy John surgery) and star 3B Manny Machado (another knee surgery) for much of the year.  About our players:  -Adam Jones is the face of the franchise. We acquired him, Chris Tillman and three others in a 2008 trade that, were it not for the Frank Robinson-Pappas trade, would be hands down the best heist in Orioles history. A former first-round pick, he's played in five All-Star games. A San Diego native, he's really adopted Baltimore as his own. He married the daughter of former Washington NFL player Jean Fugett and settled in a Lutherville home once owned by former Ravens OC Cam Cameron. He likes food. One year, he got a birthday cake made to look like a box of Popeye's.  -Ubaldo Jimenez is pitching like the guy we thought we were getting when we inked him to a big money deal last year. He had one of his worst career years last year, but he's lighting it up this year thanks to some mechanical tweaks made while working with Ramon Martinez, brother of Pedro.  -Chris Tillman has something to prove. He and the Orioles couldn't come to terms on a long-term deal last year so he has to pull a Joe Flacco in the back half and prove he's worth the money, I guess. The first half of the season has been...not the best from what we've come to expect from the ace.  -Manny Machado has the best ears in the game, but also a better glove than anyone else in the hot corner. His power is really coming out of nowhere this year, and earned him an invite to the Home Run Derby. Manny had a much-publicized outburst in a series against Oakland last year involving Josh Donaldson, but he's kept his head down and played the right way since.  -Chris Davis and Matt Wieters are both Scott Boras clients in contract years, but the comparisons end there. Crush is coming off a bad year and having an iffy year at the plate, though he's been playing a lot more right field than his natural position at first, so at least he's versatile, and that's important. Matt Wieters calls a great game behind the plate, and puts pitchers at ease. He's coming off elbow surgery, so to an extent we didn't know what we were going to get, but the power he showed early last year is still there, even if the fabled arm has been a little off point from time to time.  -Quick takes: Zach Britton (Great Britton, King of the Brittons, etc.) has a filthy slider he throws in the high 90s. Chaz Roe: great hair, physics-defying pitches. Darren O'Day: No longer underrated submarine setup man, now All-Star submarine setup man. Bud Norris is terrible now. David Lough is ripped. Jonathan Schoop has a cannon and power. Ryan Flaherty is criminally underrated. I think that's all you need to know about the players.  As for this season...we're still in it, I suppose. But the standings mask serious concerns with our inconsistent starting pitching and bats. One day we'll make it rain on the Phillies, the next we'll get blown out by the Tigers, the next Chris Tillman tosses a gem like he did tonight. So much is going to be decided between now and the non-waiver trade deadline at the end of the month as to whether we are buyers or sellers on the trade market."
orioles,3dspd5,aresef,7,Sun Jul 19 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"Wow I was not expecting such a great response,thank you. Manny machado's work in the field is one of the things that attracted me to you guys. Time zones aren't the best for me but I caught the ninth today and yeah Tillman looked great. Was surprised he only took that innings (admittedly I'm still learning the sport as well)   We've been in a rut since I started looking at the orioles so sorry. Hopefully we see more games like today now that I've made my  choice"
orioles,3dspd5,aresef,6,Sun Jul 19 03:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, Tillman tonight pitched eight innings, but threw 105 pitches, which is generally around how many pitches a starting pitcher will throw in a game, more or less. Zach Britton, a former starter who moved to the pen a couple years ago, closed in the ninth.  The bullpen has a number of informal roles. You have your long men like T.J. McFarland who can give you two or three innings easy but only pitches every few days maybe. You have your LOOGY (left handed one out guy), awful draft pick turned awful starter turned that guy Brian Matusz. You have middle relievers like Tommy Hunter or Chaz Roe who might give you an inning in the 6th or 7th. You have your setup men like Darren O'Day who you might bring in between the middle reliever and the closer in a close game.  Of course, since Tillman was cooking, O'Day was only standing up ready to warm in case someone got on in the eighth then sat down while Britton warmed instead."

orioles,3dspd5,aresef,3,Sun Jul 19 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Just to cover some stuff about baseball in general, because /u/aresef did everything about the Orioles...  Baseball is the land of unwritten rules. You can't talk about no-hitters when they're happening, you can't argue balls and strikes, and HBP retaliation is a more complex and delicate subject than the Greek economy (not actually). Sometimes you'll see people get very pissed off on Reddit or sports programs when players don't follow the rules — and it would make absolutely no sense if you weren't aware of what rule is being broken.  If you're still new, there are probably a variety of obscure written rules that only show up every once in a while  in games that you don't yet know about. I'm on mobile, so I can't link or give definitions, but I'd suggest you look up balks (not a typo), the infield fly rule, ground-rule doubles, and designated hitters and their involvement in inter-league play.  Also, as you're probably already aware, when talking about how good players are, baseball is a game of numbers and statistics. There are the direct results stats, like AVG, OPS, RBI, HR, etc. which tell you exactly what a player has done. Then there are the more general results stats, WAR being the most-loved, which will tell you overall how much a player is producing based on some pretty complicated formulas. Then there are peripheral stats, like BABIP or Contact%, which mean jack shit on their own but can indicate if a player is over or under-performing. And I've just used batting stats as examples — similar stats exist for pitching, and, to less of an extent, fielding. Batting and pitching metrics are generally accepted as very accurate ways to gauge a player's strength, but the jury is still out on whether or not the more complicated fielding stats are reliable indicators of how good a player is in the field."

orioles,3dspd5,tom7171,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:37:28 2015 UTC,Up next: the Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. 1024 of the largest pages ever used for a book.
orioles,3dspd5,tom7171,3,Sun Jul 19 13:26:06 2015 UTC,"The first Baltimore Orioles began play in 1901 when the American League decided to reform from a Minor League to a Major League. At the time there was no MLB or MiLB so leagues were either considered a minor or major league. In 1903 however 15 of the 16 Major League owners voted to allow another team in New York to compete with the Giants, that year the Orioles would ironically become the current Orioles rival The New York Yankees.   Now our current Orioles started as the Milwaukee Brewers in the Western League, The precursor to the American League. After playing one year as The Brewers in the American League, a suitable owner for the team was found in St. Louis, Robert Lee Hedges. In 1902 the team began playing as the St. Louis Browns. The Browns rebuilt Sportsman's Park in 1909 and the Cardinals would also join them there in the mid 1920's. In 1941, interest in Las Angeles approached current owner Donald Lee Barnes about relocating the team.   They got tentative approval from the league, which went as far as to draw up a schedule accounting for transcontinental train trips, though the Browns suggested that teams could travel by plane, a new concept at the time. The deal was slated to receive final approval at a league meeting on December 8. In a case of disastrous timing, the attack on Pearl Harbor took place on December 7. After league officials expressed concerns that travel restrictions would be too stringent for a prospective Los Angeles-based team to be viable, the Browns' proposal was unanimously rejected.   In 1951 Bill Veeck bought the club, he believed there was only room for one baseball franchise to succeed in St. Louis. Just as it looked as if the Cardinals would move to Houston Texas, Anheuser-Busch bought the club with the intent of keeping them in St. Louis, where they still reside today. At that point Veeck realized there was no way he would beat the Cardinals out of town. In 1953 attendance plummeted, Veeck then sold all of his owning of the club to a a group of Baltimore investors for $2.5 million. In 1954 the Baltimore Orioles once again opened shop. In December of 1954 the Orioles completed a 17 player trade with the Yankees, sending away most of the remaining former Browns.    The seeds of long-term success were planted on September 14, 1954, when the Orioles hired Paul Richards to become the ballclub's manager and general manager. He laid the foundation for what would years later be called the Oriole Way. The instruction of baseball fundamentals became uniform in every detail between all classes within the organization. Players were patiently refined until fundamentally sound instead of being hastily advanced to the next level   Winning the A.L. Pennant 7 times throughout their history The Orioles have won all 3 of their World Series titles in Baltimore. 1966, 70, and 83. In 1992 Oriole Park at Camden Yards and immediately became a hit, spawning the return to the classic style of ballparks such as Sportsman's Park. There is much more to the Orioles than what I put in here so I'll include some links.   Orioles Wiki St. Louis Browns Historical Society Cal Ripken Jr. ""Baseball's Iron Man"" Brooks Robinson ""The Human Vacuum Cleaner"" Nicknamed for his superb defense. Frank Robinson   Quick Question though, where do you live? Luckily for me I live in Atlanta so the timing works great for me to watch my beloved Braves and Orioles."
orioles,3dspd5,BaltimoreBirdGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 05:36:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I live in Australia so I'm probably not gonna be able to catch most games outside of weekends. I'll follow along the scores and watch highlights mostly. Here seems like a great place too to follow along
orioles,3dspd5,Louie_Being,4,Sun Jul 19 05:40:36 2015 UTC,"Well thank you for your interest in baseball, especially the O's. I have been to all but 4 ballparks and I must say there is no atmosphere like the one at Camden Yards when the Orioles are in town."
orioles,3dspd5,MattHoppe1,2,Sun Jul 19 05:44:01 2015 UTC,"Let me suggest you see if there are any softball leagues in your area.  The rules are roughly the same as baseball but the ball is bigger and is pitched underhand.  In rec leagues it's typically pitched pretty slowly.  It's a great way to get into baseball and learn how the game works and it's a ton of fun.    FWIW, I surprisingly enough found that there are at least 3 different leagues in London after moving here so it wouldnt surprise me if you could find something nearby even in Australia."
orioles,3dspd5,Nevermore60,2,Sun Jul 19 13:09:14 2015 UTC,"Aren't you ignoring the NL Orioles of the late 19th century? I won't give an encyclopedic addendum but they add a few bits to the story of the current team and baseball in general.  In particular I think they are responsible for the ""Baltimore chop"", a batting tactic where the batter deliberately hits the ball into the ground in front of home plate, trying to bounce it so high that the fielders won't be able to do anything with it by the time it comes back down. These days, the term is still used but I don't know if anyone does it on purpose.  Also, the manager of the original AL Orioles, John McGraw, had been a star of the NL Orioles. (The NL team won several championships but was contracted out of existence before the turn of the century.)  Another part of the prehistory of the modern team is that there was a minor league Baltimore Orioles team) which (I've read) attracted such large crowds in the '40s and '50s that it was a factor in bringing MLB back to Baltimore.  EDIT: the link is messed up because I'm not an expert in reddit formatting. But it will get you there anyway."

orioles,3drndv,OsStrohsAndBohs,2,Sun Jul 19 01:58:59 2015 UTC,What else could it be? The railing is a home run if it's hit in the air so it can't be in play. We have the same thing in right field so if a ball somehow bounced that high it would be the same thing.
orioles,3drndv,ECU_Drummer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"You'd think it could be in play when it's...not...hit in the air.  Since they can still, in fact, make a play with it, haha."
orioles,3drndv,OsStrohsAndBohs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:58:45 2015 UTC,Haha yea but you can't have different rules like that. Anywhere that is considered a home run has to be out of play. Like if it hit a flag at OPACY and bounced back onto the field.
orioles,3drndv,ECU_Drummer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no idea."

orioles,3drndv,Rockonfreakybro,3,Sun Jul 19 01:09:15 2015 UTC,Tilly gives us a lights out start and we give him one run of support. No wonder he doesn't like doing this often.

orioles,3drndv,cassiekt,3,Sun Jul 19 01:04:03 2015 UTC,So think of how many games could've gone our way if our RISP numbers werent 2-51 or whatever it is right now. That number changes and all of a sudden we'll be surging in the east going for that pennant.
orioles,3drndv,Zephaerus,3,Sun Jul 19 01:03:30 2015 UTC,9/97 or something go like that
orioles,3drndv,cassiekt,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:39 2015 UTC,"I mean the law of averages has to change right, the number has to start swinging our way and when it does, we'll be more than alright. I have faith."

orioles,3dkc6e,Kallamez,3,Fri Jul 17 06:45:39 2015 UTC,"Miguel Gonzalez, Ubaldo Jimenez, and Wei-Yin Chen are all noticeably out-performing their FIP.    I always take issue with the sabermetrics' guys because of statements like these. They basically say ""Ah, Gonzo has been outperforming himself as of late, but it's just a period though...of almost a year now ""  When do they stop saying that he is just in a phase and admit that the player actually improved?"
orioles,3dkc6e,Kallamez,2,Fri Jul 17 03:38:10 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear I'm not saying its a fluke. With a good fielding team, their ERA should be better than their FIP. That's the concept.   I agree that people miss-use the stat. There's nothing about FIP that suggests that a pitcher that is outperforming their FIP with a good defense behind them should regress so long as they continue to be surrounded by a good defense unless they are out performing it by some obscene amount. Even in that case the ""Regression"" should still result in a lower ERA than FIP.   FIP exists to attempt to quantify a pitcher with fielding variables removed. Therefore, in theory a pitcher on a good fielding team should have an ERA lower than their FIP, and one on a bad fielding team should have a higher era.   Of course there are outliers (pitchers that can't throw strikes, small sample sizes, etc) but after three seasons of Tillman outperforming his FIP, and his team-mates doing the same, we can say that it is a definite statistical trend and evidence that his results should improve going forward."
orioles,3dkc6e,Heartless_Tortoise,2,Fri Jul 17 09:27:25 2015 UTC,Well he's still been outperforming his FIP this year. I think most would agree that he's proven himself as a pitcher who will outperform his FIP. The problem is that his FIP this year has been worse than ever. I'm confused by your comment though because it's not like fans of sabermetrics think a guy can't improve. But if a player isn't showing anything that looks like more than luck based on data gathered from thousands of other players it's hard to just assume a guy is doing better rather than just going through the normal ebb and flow of the season.
orioles,3dkc6e,Louie_Being,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:45:54 2015 UTC,"I don't get this. The point of FIP is that it's theoretically independent of fielding--a way of comparing pitcher performance isolated from the quality of the defense they have behind them.  Ergo, put a good defense like the O's behind someone with a mediocre FIP, and that pitcher will probably have a good ERA.  Now maybe Gonzo is outperforming some other peripherals, but if you're only wondering why someone's ERA is better than their FIP, you can just start by looking at what the abbreviation stands for.  That said, a pitcher can certainly outperform their FIP by getting lucky, or depending on your philosophy, being ""clutch"".  However you only need to fall back on such an explanation after you've exhausted the effect of defense quality and the baseball parks he plays in. (Oakland Coliseum makes pitchers look better just by having lots of foul territory and decent distance to the fences all around. The latter of which I'm pretty sure was also true of Memorial Stadium, by the way.)"
orioles,3dkc6e,Heartless_Tortoise,2,Fri Jul 17 06:09:11 2015 UTC,"The problem is that even a defense as good as the Orioles over the past few years shouldn't be making enough difference to bridge the gap between ERA and FIP for Gonzalez and Tillman. That pretty much leaves luck and rare skill. Johnny Cueto is another who will always outperform his FIP regardless of defense. FIP in the absence of proof of exceptional contact management should be taken as true talent level. That said, inducing popups is a skill not taken into account by FIP. Popups can drive down ERA in relation to FIP because they're effectively strikeouts, yet in FIP they're lumped in with actual fly balls that can turn into home runs. A difference of .25 runs between FIP and ERA would be totally explained by defense. Three times that difference is harder to explain over multiple seasons."
orioles,3dkc6e,Louie_Being,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was looking for more extended reasoning and you delivered."
orioles,3dkc6e,Heartless_Tortoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:32:15 2015 UTC,"Defense having an impact on results is the point of FIP, and arguably one of the major strategies of the Orioles' team construction. Its why David Lough is still on the team, why Schoop and Machado got called up early. Why Caleb Joseph is up instead of Clevenger.   The idea that skill = outperforming FIP doesn't match up. I see what you're saying about pop-ups, but how often are pop-ups actually dropped? Not often enough to create a serious swing I would think.   For example Randy Johnson's career ERA .10 runs higher than his FIP. He was on several bad fielding teams such as the 2005 Yanks (Shefield/Matsui/Williams OF...ooof)  Where-as Maddux DID constantly out-perform his FIP, but had a pretty decent fielding squad being him.   Johnny Cueto also has benefited from some very good defenses to bolster his results. Very solid infield.   Which, isn't that the point? Its a team sport, you have to go play defense for your pitcher.    (I might be totally misunderstanding what you're saying though)"
orioles,3dkc6e,Heartless_Tortoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:48:25 2015 UTC,"I think there is some misunderstanding here. Popups being dropped has very little to do with my point because it happens so little that they can be treated basically as strikeouts. They aren't measured as a FIP component though, so pitchers who do have skill at inducing popups will do better than their FIP suggests they should.  Defense is the 2nd most likely reason a pitcher has a FIP-ERA discrepancy in a small sample, the most likely is luck. In a larger sample those flip as luck runs out, but no team defense is good enough to create a discrepancy the size of the one Miguel Gonzalez has seen over his career. The Royals have led the league in defense the last couple years and even they have only saved 0.4 runs per game over the league average defense. Cueto has a difference of 0.6 over 1300 innings. The Reds have had good defense, but not that good.  Pitchers having the skills to outperform FIP are rare, but it is widely acknowledged by the sabermetric community that they do exist. At that point it's a question of how many of these pitchers are there, and what sample size do you need from them to prove it? Miguel Gonzalez is closing in on a pretty definitive sample size. His only issue is that unlike Cueto, who has a solid FIP and outperforms it, he has a mediocre FIP baseline which is harder to overcome."
orioles,3dkc6e,Heartless_Tortoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"Every pitcher has runs let in by the bullpen and every pitcher catches bad breaks from his defense. I hope Tillman improves in the 2nd half but I can't say I agree with the reasoning here.  And yes, Orioles pitching has tended to do better than their fielding independent statistics suggest, but they can only be expected to do so to a certain level."

orioles,3dj3dd,FaysOne,7,Fri Jul 17 00:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think the MLB should have a mid-season tourney. The NBA could too due to its lengthy schedule  I was thinking about this earlier today.  It's single elimination but you still play if you lose. So we'd eliminate teams getting rest by losing.   15 AL teams play vs 15 NL teams (with DH) on an inverted ranking in a bracket style tourney. 1 vs 15, 2 vs 14, etc. Every team will play 5 games.  The 15 winners plus the losing team wildcard (least run diff + record if tie) make the final winning bracket. Now we have 16 teams in our winners bracket. The losers bracket will play out the same. 14 teams play 7 vs 7 based on original seeding I guess, etc.  The 16 team winners bracket now has 8 playing 8, 4v4, 2v2, 1v1 championship.  *Round 1   *  1   Kansas City Royals  vs  15 Philadelphia Phillies  2   Minnesota Twins vs  14  Milwaukee Brewers  3   New York Yankees    vs  13  Miami Marlins  4   Los Angeles Angels  vs  12  Colorado Rockies  5   Houston Astros  vs  11  Cincinnati Reds  6   Tampa Bay Rays  vs  10  San Diego Padres  7   Baltimore Orioles   vs  9   Atlanta Braves  8   Detroit Tigers  vs  8   Arizona Diamondbacks  9   Toronto Blue Jays   vs  7   San Francisco Giants  10  Cleveland Indians   vs  6   New York Mets  11  Texas Rangers   vs  5   Chicago Cubs  12  Chicago White Sox   vs  4   Washington Nationals  13  Boston Red Sox  vs  3   Los Angeles Dodgers  14  Seattle Mariners    vs  2   Pittsburgh Pirates  15  Oakland Athletics   vs  1   St. Louis Cardinals  LETS MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

You can get them right to your smart phone, and that will allow you to play them in the car while you drive.  Also, I have really enjoyed the MLB Network on Sirius/XM. I realize you have to pony up to listen to satellite, but they often give out cheap deals (X months for $20 or something), which can be a good way to get better sports content for pretty cheap.

Davis is knowledgeable but also an arrogant prick too.   Rob and Vinnie:  Very entertaining to me. Rob is starting to get a little full of himself I think, but he's good. Vinnie is hilariously bad. He really has no idea what he's talking about except for football, and even that is questionable for a former GM. He's funny as hell sometimes though.  Scott and Jeremy:  Definitely the best all around. I find Jeremy hilarious, and I also think he's the least biggest homer of the bunch.   Bruce Cunningham is the biggest blowhard I've ever heard in my life. How that man continues to get work in sports broadcasting is beyond me. He has no idea what he's talking about."

However, if I recall correctly from my college days.....MARC ends around 10:00 or 11:00pm. You may have to take AmTrak (more expensive) because of an extended schedule. I would look up the schedules for each train (I would post links if I could, but it seems they're in PDF). I recommend using Lyft/Uber/taxi to get to the train station cuz it is your fastest way to get there.   You never really mentioned if you needed a ride back to DC, so all this info I'm giving you depends on if you plan to stay in B-town, or need to get back. If you dont need to go back, then you're fine w/ MARC. Lol, sorry for that."

orioles,3dec54,aresef,2,Wed Jul 15 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Sure. That's probably good. May be cheaper to split a cab/car than each pay for an individual train ticket. Uber has a fare estimator. Could estimate the cost to go from Balt. to DC. At that hour, traffic would be low, which helps."
orioles,3dec54,aresef,2,Wed Jul 15 17:33:49 2015 UTC,I'm maybe thinking about going to this game with my roommate. She would kill to go - Markakis was her favorite Oriole and she wants to be back for his return. If I do I could give you guys a ride if you don't mind sitting in the backseat of my Mazda 3 and will be cool with going and coming when I go and come. I live in Silver Spring so you'd have to get up to me but it's an easy metro ride up.

orioles,3dec54,jwseagles,2,Thu Jul 16 02:28:23 2015 UTC,"Marc and Amtrak are not good options for night games, at least if you want to watch the whole game. You would have to get to Penn Station by helicopter to have any hope of making it to the last train on time. Check Amtrak to be sure. You may have to leave the game early. The light rail does have a shuttle train that will take you the six stops from the yard to Penn Station. It will say PENN-CAMDEN SHUTTLE.   MARC, if it is running, is $8 to Union Station. Amtrak is $15-27 depending on how early you book and for what train. MARC does have a Camden Line that will take you from Union to Camden Yards, but it only runs rush hours.   There is a B30 bus that WMATA runs from BWI to the Metro stop in Greenbelt, but that sunsets early too, and factoring in the time to get to BWI by light rail, that's also not the best idea. That picks up...on the main concourse level, I believe, as well as at the BWI Business District light rail. The fare, last I checked, is $7, payable with a SmarTrip card. You can get one of these at a number of Metro stations. It costs a couple of dollars but it's worth it and it's accepted for Baltimore local transit, but not MARC. If you use paper fare cards on DC metro, they charge a dollar more per trip.  There is a hostel downtown, near the central branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library. Maybe a 10 to 12 block walk. I do not know what their access hours are or what their rates are like. But that's an option."
orioles,3dec54,flannel_smoothie,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the in-depth information. We would stay the entire game so looking like taxi/Uber is the route we are going to take.
orioles,3dec54,flannel_smoothie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:14:43 2015 UTC,"If I may offer another bit of advice, don't take a taxi back to DC. Baltimore cabs can only pick people up in Baltimore and you'll make them have to drive all the way back on their own dime. Uber that shit if you must. Uber, of course, lets you split fares on the app to limit the damage. But expect that ride to be around $50, unless there's surge pricing in effect, which there very well might be."

orioles,3dajq9,ZackMorris78,3,Wed Jul 15 02:47:15 2015 UTC,15 year contact now ... even then he may still end up in pin stripes
orioles,3dajq9,Elios000,6,Wed Jul 15 03:28:03 2015 UTC,"Option 1: Play out the season, give QO to Wieters, Chen, Davis, try and rebuild through the draft/FA.  All 3 of those guys are Boras clients, so the chances of them re-signing here are pretty slim.  The only thing that makes me believe one or two would be possible is, we have a good amount of money coming off the books.  DFA or trade of Hunter/Matusz will net us even more money.  Option 2: Go full rebuild, trade Wieters, Chen, Davis, Pearce, O'Day, etc for minor leaguers.  Maybe get some guys that are close to ML ready, retool in 2016 and come back and compete in 2017.  We still have a strong core with Manny, Adam, Schoop, Hardy with Ubaldo, Tillman, Gonzo, and Gausman rounding out the rotation.  Hell, we don't even have to call it a rebuild, just a retooling of the roster.  Also, just to give you an idea of our minor leagues, Bundy/HH are question marks to this point, no idea when they can be starters in our rotation.  We have a bunch of depth, but most of those are 4/5s.  Hitting wise, there isn't shit coming soon that is worth talking about.  Sisco and Reyes are the top hitting prospects in my opinion, and both are years away."
orioles,3dajq9,romorr,3,Tue Jul 14 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"I love our team, but I'd vote for option #2. We could really set ourselves up to contend for years to come by forfeiting this season."
orioles,3dajq9,Walk_SC,2,Wed Jul 15 02:24:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with trading is that we have to convince teams to give up more value than a first round pick for each of rentals. I could see it working in a trade or two but I'd be skeptical we can move everybody. I'd rather see us stick with what we have than partially rebuild (unless we are getting big league ready pieces who can step right in). I'm still unsure what I want to see but I'd lean towards ride it out with our guys this year and take the draft picks. Worst case with that, I believe the supplemental picks are tradable so the off-season could be interesting."
orioles,3dajq9,BaltimoreBirdGuy,5,Tue Jul 14 22:19:16 2015 UTC,"I think we could get better, and the thought process there is, these guys would be closer to helping the ML team than some draft picks.  Guys like O'Day could net a really nice piece.  With KCs bullpen last year, rental relievers are in high demand, especially ones like O'Day.  Also no, those draft picks are not tradeable.  Only competitive balance ones are, like the one the Orioles gave the Dodgers to take on Ryan Webbs salary.  If that is the way the Orioles value draft picks, I am quite happy more aren't tradeable."
orioles,3dajq9,romorr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:26:06 2015 UTC,Alvarez and Walker can provide some short-term help from the minors - not going to be stars but can be role players during a rebuild/retool.

orioles,3d4l7o,chuck_yeaa,3,Mon Jul 13 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"Keeping the FAs around until they decline a QO nets us draft picks, right? So it's not like we get nothing when they walk.  This team can win, an upgrade or two would help us do so but for the most part we are looking at the 2015 O's right now.   As far as FAs go, Darren is the only one we should aggressively pursue IMHO. If we can afford Chen I'm for it too. Davis walks for sure."
orioles,3d4l7o,saw_square,6,Mon Jul 13 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"I really don't think we really grasp how valuable a pitcher Chen is. If he was putting up these numbers in a Yankees or Dodgers uniform his face would be a fixture of ESPN. Buck even said that would not entertain trade offers for Chen, you won't get a top-ten left hand pitcher in trades.   So yeah, Chen probably has the biggest upside of any of the free agents. I fully expect him to land a ridiculous contract next year."
orioles,3d4l7o,stackolee,5,Mon Jul 13 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"Agree that Chen is SERIOUSLY undervalued around here. He's the kind of guy that LAD, NYM, TOR, etc are gonna be looking for. Cueto is Cueto but after him? I'd take Chen over Shark"
orioles,3d4l7o,xajii,3,Mon Jul 13 21:48:59 2015 UTC,We can use the picks to restock. We should sign Darren and that's possible. Chen is represented by Boras so there's no way he's back next year (Zach Davies anyone).
orioles,3d4l7o,xajii,7,Mon Jul 13 18:12:52 2015 UTC,"Just don't see it this year. Tillman losing it for too long and Bud devolving into utter shit was the nail in this team's coffin. Making up ground is an uphill battle when at least 2 and probably 3 teams in the division are flat-out better than us.  Too many upcoming free agents to fuck around right now. The O's need to sell while they can. Come next year, there'll be nothing left to shop. Our farm is empty. It's a shame, but you have to think about the future. I don't want another 15 years of trash."
orioles,3d921d,ctor9,11,Tue Jul 14 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"No way. We all know how much Buck values defense over offense. Hardy is possibly our 2nd or 3rd best on defense (tied or behind Jones), not to mention that he isn't awful on offense either. I just don't see us shipping out a proven veteran with years left in the tank for some prospects."
orioles,3d921d,ravenspiano24,2,Tue Jul 14 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"I think he is arguably our best defensive player and definitely our best infielder (Yes, better than Machado and Flaherty). I've heard multiple comments on how Machado attributes almost all of his defensive improvement to Hardy. Schoop also said that he learned how to tag properly from Hardy, which is how he got Michael Taylor out on that steal a few games ago versus the Nats.   I think Hardy is one of the least likely players to be traded and I look forward to having him on the team for the next few years."
orioles,3d921d,hcshock,8,Tue Jul 14 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"this sounds like classic baseball fan trade proposals. ""let's trade a guy that's over 30 and on the decline and we'll get some useful prospects back, especially if we include a back-of-the-rotation starter"""
orioles,3d921d,I_am_the_birds,2,Tue Jul 14 14:04:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree, hence why I said that we'd potentially be getting prospects and asking for your thoughts instead of outright declaring that we should do it. I think we're in a tough spot where we have a couple cornerstones in place in Jones and Machado (hopefully getting an extension soon) that we're not bad enough to get desperate and sell to get the stud prospects a la Addison Russell from last year. But we're also too dry in the farm system to make a big splash for a piece to help us down the stretch dramatically."
orioles,3d921d,Colebert_herbst,2,Tue Jul 14 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"Erik Bedard would be almost a valid argument, but he was 28 when we traded him and got AJ and Tilly (And George Sherril haha).  In more recent years though is Koji Traded by the Baltimore Orioles to the Texas Rangers for Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter. Koji was 32, and only had a year on his contract I think.  Or... Remember Miguel Tejada?! He was 32, had 2 years left Traded by the Baltimore Orioles to the Houston Astros for Matt Albers, Mike Costanzo, Troy Patton, Dennis Sarfate and Luke Scott  Or Guthrie, a decent mediocre pitcher traded when he was 31: Baltimore Orioles to the Colorado Rockies for Jason Hammel and Matt Lindstrom  So i think this was completely valid question. I can list more examples if needed"
orioles,3d921d,ss33o23,3,Tue Jul 14 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"Erik Bedard had just gotten 2nd for the Cy Young. His value was not at all comparable to Hardy's, regardless of age."
orioles,3d921d,Colebert_herbst,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"If by 2nd you actually mean tying for 5th in the AL with 1% of votes, then... Yes   JJ in 2013 was a Silver Slugger, All Star, and a Gold Glove. And in that year his WAR was 3.9, in 2015 it's only 0.7...   Bedards WAR was 5.7 in 2007... still solid in 2006 at 3.7, not mentioned in the CY Young talk though.    I think that is completely comparable and I also note that you ignored all the other examples I provided."
orioles,3d921d,I_am_the_birds,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"Erik Bedard was traded during the offseason with one year on his contract. He had an ERA+ of 146 and struck out a MLB leading 10.9 K/9. Seattle got fleeced, but not comparable to JJ Hardy's weak offense and half-injured season.  Koji had pitched 1.5 incredible seasons for us as closer, a 1.72 ERA, and he still had 1.5 seasons left on his deal. He was one of the best relievers on the market.  Miguel Tejada was one season removed from his 3 straight all star games, and didn't even have a bad season before he was traded, just an average 2.3 WAR season. He could at least hit. The centerpieces of his deal were Troy Patton and Luke Scott. Patton was top 100 prospect, and a worthy pick up at the time, but Tejada was a lot better than JJ Hardy. A lot better.   Guthrie was an average pitcher one year removed from a 4.8 WAR season that we traded for a middling pitcher and an average middle reliever. Not prospects. A pair of men his age.   My point was not that guys over 30 don't get traded, but guys like JJ Hardy who are having down seasons with injuries that already showed signs of decline before that are not worth much in trade value. JJ Hardy's trade value is at a low."
orioles,3d921d,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,6,Tue Jul 14 22:16:58 2015 UTC,I just dont think there will be enough return on an aging SS thats had a huge drop off in power the past 2 years. I think his defense and contact are needed on the Orioles right now more so than what little we might get back.
orioles,3d921d,BaltimoreBirdGuy,3,Tue Jul 14 13:36:44 2015 UTC,The only way we'd move him is if we lose every single game between now and the trade deadline and we have a massive firesale where we just trade everybody with value but Manny and Jones.  So pretty much it's not going to happen and I definitely don't think it should.  The only way it would be remotely a good idea is if we had a super promising young SS or 3B in the minors who could pair with Manny on the left but there is just no reason to move someone who is more valuable to us than he is to other teams.
orioles,3d921d,indabasszone,2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"Hardy isn't someone we would move, and he + Norris/Tilly isn't gonna command much of anything significant prospect-wise."

The place feels like an extension of the city rather than a sanitized enclave. The brick and steel blend it in not only with the existing warehouse but with decades of city architecture.

orioles,3d269q,xajii,10,Sun Jul 12 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I think they're still totally in it. Yeah  it's been a bad couple weeks. With a good couple weeks we're back in first. There's no team in the division that's gonna walk away with the title. It's there for the taking. I still think we've got a good team here.   I'm also not optimistic about the coming years nor the franchise's ability to rebuild. This is the last year of the bubble. We're well within reach. I say go all in."
orioles,3d269q,onioning,8,Mon Jul 13 01:55:58 2015 UTC,Go all in now confirms shit for next decade. Start the rebuild now and we can get valuable pieces for our future. Manny and Adam are worth building around.
orioles,3d269q,orioles0615,5,Mon Jul 13 04:43:38 2015 UTC,If you build around Adam you have to build quickly because he is 29. However I agree with you.
orioles,3d269q,onioning,2,Mon Jul 13 12:30:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just have zero faith in their ability to rebuild."
orioles,3d269q,JustJoeKing87,7,Mon Jul 13 04:50:25 2015 UTC,"I think we should be reluctant sellers. That is, let the market decide. Don't actively seek out deals but if people are banging the door down for Chen or Crush and they're desperate then DD should listen.   Making one trade isn't going to tank our season. The Red Sox traded away Nomar in 2004 and look how that worked out for them."
orioles,3d269q,lanboyo,5,Mon Jul 13 12:47:57 2015 UTC,"We are only four games out. With 80 to play. I think we will end up standing pat.  We shouldn't be buying, but we have exactly four upcoming free agents with trade value, Wieters, Oday, Davis, and Chen.  We are unlikely to trade these guys unless we drop the the rest of July.   I assume we try to resign Wieters. Chen and Oday will be cost prohibitive.  I still think we should trade Chen now, and then try to make a package for Cole Hamels.   Astros and Mets need pitching."
orioles,3d269q,eternallurker,3,Mon Jul 13 05:46:46 2015 UTC,"To me that sounds like contradictory points. If we're still in it and we go for it this year, we need Chen,  we need pitching. I don't think there is a package we can put together to get a guy like Hammels unless you throw in Gausman. I want this to be a good year and they are still in it at least as of right now. But to me, they just don't look like a team that is going to put it together. They feel very much like the 2013 team. Had a lot of talent, but never got.over the hump."
orioles,3d269q,lanboyo,3,Mon Jul 13 12:16:16 2015 UTC,"I think the proper move is to wait it out, making no big moves. Move Norris if we can. We have lost the last bunch of games when our offense has gone uncharacteristically ( and statistically unlikely to continue ) cold. We have gone from hitting extremely well in the clutch to not hitting at all in the clutch as our pitching has performed decently. We are better than we have been playing.   We are not good enough to get far in the post season though.  Chen, Oday and Davis leave at the end of the season (we make qualifying offers perhaps) and are  replaced internally. We try to sign some marquis free agents to go with our existing pieces."
orioles,3d269q,eternallurker,2,Mon Jul 13 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"If you think we won't make it in the post season then why stand pat instead of selling? We are going to lose these FAs, it's better to trade them now than let them walk. Get something back to build with."
orioles,3d269q,hideisalive,6,Mon Jul 13 17:34:22 2015 UTC,"It pains me to agree with you. Should they just blow up the whole team? Let's be honest,  it doesn't look like they will put it together this year and after this year so many key guys are set to walk. Long term, it probably would be best to unload what you can for prospects. I have a feeling they won't and this team could end up being mediocre at best for the next decade."
orioles,3d269q,onioning,4,Sun Jul 12 23:05:16 2015 UTC,I give it two more weeks
orioles,3d269q,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,3,Mon Jul 13 04:32:45 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that regardless we're going to be mediocre or worse for the next decade. Gee, I wonder why we feel that way?"
orioles,3d269q,kilgoresalmon,2,Mon Jul 13 01:56:54 2015 UTC,"We're probably going to stand pretty pat overall.   No way we get rid of our best pitcher while we're still in the race. We get another 10-12 starts from Chen before he's no longer an Oriole, lets use them to win a division. If not, give him terrible matchups and sink his free agency value and try and get him on the cheap (that's my evil backup plan)  I think Wieters is staying put. If we can afford him, we'll try and get him back here. You can win games with Wieters, Jones, and Machado. I dont care who the other pieces are. The problem is we cant over spend on Wieters as we are going to have to back up the money truck to pay Machado very soon.  Overall I see us trying to move some stuff to try and see if someone else will work out here. Maybe Norris, Tillman, Riemold, Pearce."
orioles,3d269q,MattHoppe1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:32:50 2015 UTC,I sadly agree - would rather get some good prospects than see what this team can do. The pitching is really falling apart and we can't fix that easily.

At worst its 2-1. That's on AJ and and Buck for having AJ in CF and not DHing  I know players are coy about injuries but if you can't throw, or god forbid make it worse, that doesn't help anyone.   But I can't be mad a the bats today. Scherzer is just filthy this year. Oh well. They say you win 50, lose 50, and the other 60 are toss ups.  Sucks to go into the break like that though"
orioles,3d1ocb,hideisalive,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:17:02 2015 UTC,are you seriously implying aj can't throw?  he threw an inaccurate throw.  it happens.  he misplayed the bounce and had to rush the throw.  again it happens.  and i know we hold aj to this godly standard but people do make errors regardless of injury status (unless they're nick markakis and they just don't make errors and you accept that).  i'll take my chances with jonesy making that throw over lough 100 times out of 100

orioles,3d0m0f,hideisalive,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:15:06 2015 UTC,With three days off and Chen's propensity to get hit 3rd time through the lineup I feel like we should be in the bullpen right now playing matchups.
orioles,3d0m0f,OleSandlotSlob,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"In past years, he tired at about 90 pitches.  That's usually about 6 innings and maybe a little over 2 times through the lineup on a good day, so yeah, agreed.  It took forever for Buck to catch on to that.  This year he's had several games where he went deeper and was effective, maybe he's a little better conditioned or something; so the past may be over.  But you're right, there doesn't seem much need to push it with the break coming."

orioles,3d0m0f,buddygroomsstache,6,Sun Jul 12 18:56:13 2015 UTC,All three runs came with 2 outs.  Two came on a 2-strike count.  Said this in the game where we got walked of: It just isn't fucking good enough.  You need to do the easy things. When our hitters get down in the count they are helpless.  That's how it is supposed to be.  You can blame the offense all you want (and they deserve it) but the rotation has given up a bajillion homeruns and are comically inept with two strikes.  These are things that have to get corrected after the break because this team can be good enough to make the playoffs. We've seen it.

orioles,3d0m0f,hideisalive,-4,Sun Jul 12 18:36:42 2015 UTC,Its a PED. It definitely can help performance.   Its a controlled substance.   Don't be like what?   Oh no I pointed out the irony of the timing of a statement an announcer made.
orioles,3d0m0f,lanboyo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"Adderall is banned because it is methamphetamine, and tests identically to crystal meth.  It is on the banned substance list because it is impossible to separate it in tests from recreational illegal substances. Not much of a PED.   It should be noted that every player in baseball took amphetamines 1950-1980."
orioles,3d0m0f,hideisalive,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:13:04 2015 UTC,It should be noted that most of baseball took steroids between 1990 and 2005.

orioles,3d0m0f,aresef,2,Sun Jul 12 18:40:18 2015 UTC,It is not a performance-enhancing drug under the JDA.
orioles,3d0m0f,hideisalive,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:31 2015 UTC,"And until 10 years ago there was no punishment for being caught taking steroids, and even then it was just 10 games.   MLB drug policy isn't exactly something you want to point to for standards.   Adderall enhances performance. That's why its banned. Do they have it classified as a PED? No. But it is banned because its a performance enhancer."
orioles,3d0m0f,WholeLottaGlove,2,Sun Jul 12 18:44:15 2015 UTC,Cmon it was fucking adderall
orioles,3d0m0f,hideisalive,-2,Sun Jul 12 18:35:51 2015 UTC,Adderall is banned for a reason.
orioles,3d0m0f,aresef,2,Sun Jul 12 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"Because it helps focus, not because it makes you hit the ball harder. He applied for an exemption he had before that was denied and then didn't apply last season. Now he's taking a similar drug WITH that approval."
orioles,3d0m0f,hideisalive,0,Sun Jul 12 18:40:55 2015 UTC,Focus in baseball definitely doesn't enhance performance.

As far as another bullpen arm, that doesn't even interest me because it doesn't move the needle enough.  For the Orioles to be WS contenders, only a Cueto or Hamels does that, or maybe an Upton + a mid tier pitcher, like, Mike Leake from Cincy.  I rather the Orioles stand pat, I am having a hard time seeing this team as a WS favorite.  Our farm isn't that great, and further depleting it for this team would just further ruin our chances for the future.  Though I do wonder if DD will go for it this year since we have so many FAs next year.  I just hope we can retool a bit for 2016, then come back strong in 2017."

orioles,3ctnr0,reservoir_hill,3,Fri Jul 10 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"the blurb on Manny: Hitting MVP (so far): As with Washington Nationals right-hander Max Scherzer, Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Goldschmidt is the top fantasy provider among his peers -- the lone fellow in baseball on a 30-homer, 30-steal pace -- but he was also selected fifth overall in ESPN ADP, so we expected greatness. We love him, but I think the MVP is someone stolen in later rounds, or no round at all, providing near top performance. Nothing against Goldschmidt, Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper or Mr. Trout, but Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado is the pick. A 10th-round pick in ESPN ADP and eighth at his position, Machado is hitting .301 and on pace for 36 home runs, 91 RBIs, a preposterous 25 stolen bases and 105 runs scored. He missed half of last season and was perceived to be a huge risk due to knee problems. Well, he’s great. The guy who was 6-for-13 on stolen base attempts in his one full season is 13-of-15 in 2015. The leadoff hitter has doubled his walk rate from 2013. It’s all real, and it’s glorious. Kudos as well to 17th-rounder A.J. Pollock; the Arizona outfielder went seven rounds later and has similar numbers to Machado. Why Machado over Pollock? I lean toward the extra power rather than speed, and infield eligibility helps as well."

At the hot dog joint on the north end of Eutaw under the roof bar, you can get a crab-mac dog. Serious.  For booze, Dempsey's has house brews in the warehouse. Flying Dog has a stand on the first level, and Heavy Seas has a cart up top. The Free State Pub has regional brews like Heavy Seas, Dominion, Fordham, understandably upcharged for being crafts.

In fact, parking in the neighborhoods where you might do that is restricted during stadium events. You're going to want to get a parking pass online through the Orioles or Stubhub or something or, failing that: parkingpanda.com. They have an app and more and many garages have scanners. Looking at their website, you can park at University of Maryland Medical Center or Days Inn for $26. Full disclosure, my wife works for them.  Another viable option is parking for free at a light rail lot then paying the $3.40 for a round trip. Not sure if you have a SmarTrip, but MTA ticket machines take those. The light rail does run after the game for up to an hour.  Tickets: I'm confused when you say Flite Deck. That's a specific reserved party area on the club level. I'm gonna assume you mean roof deck in center. Anybody with a ticket to the game has access to that, the statue area above the pens, maybe the picnic area and the flag court. The exception is the two rows of seats on the edge of the roof deck. They used to be open, now they're not.  In any case, I'd recommend looking at our guide for seat recommendations. Can't go wrong with 336."

orioles,3cj0xk,avery_crudeman,4,Wed Jul 8 08:02:20 2015 UTC,Need to bring up a bullpen arm too.
orioles,3cj0xk,Imsortofabigdeal,5,Wed Jul 8 08:37:49 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how little this move actually means... Our pitching is a hot mess that needs to be figured out. Outside of Gonzalez and Ubaldo I never feel safe. Then with the bullpen I'm loving Roe, O'Day, and Britton, but sometimes they pitch a lot of great innings and then I don't see them for a while, idk. Buck knows more than I do about rest time and stuff, obviously, I just get confused by our pitching situation and also frustrated by our lack of a fifth starter. As much as Tillman pisses me off at least we know he can start. Same with Chen."
orioles,3cj0xk,shortycraig,12,Wed Jul 8 11:55:16 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Chen has been the best pitcher on the team this season. Swap him with Gonzalez and I'd agree with your above comments.
orioles,3cj0xk,Jaysauras,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:49:43 2015 UTC,If only Tillman got his crap together I would feel great about our rotation. I'm so over him.

Gonzo is young and promising though (EDIT: Not as young as I thought, sheesh) , so hopefully he can be an option going forward. Who do you want to see in the five spot? And do you agree with the way we manage the bullpen?"
orioles,3cj0xk,owlbrain,5,Wed Jul 8 13:02:28 2015 UTC,Gonzo is 31. He is who he is. A good #4 pitcher.
orioles,3cj0xk,Imsortofabigdeal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:10:01 2015 UTC,for real? I always thought he was younger than that.
orioles,3cj0xk,owlbrain,6,Wed Jul 8 13:12:25 2015 UTC,He was a 27 year old rookie from the Mexican league when we signed him.
orioles,3cj0xk,shortycraig,3,Wed Jul 8 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"I think Gonzo is up there in age actually near 30. The five pitchers I want to see are Jimenez, Tillman, Chen, Gonzalez, and Gausman. I'd even be fine with Norris in there from time to time.  The defense and hitting were just bad this last stretch of games, it'll turn around.  The bullpen management is impeccable actually. You can't throw O'day and Roe every day, thats now how it works, its not a video game. Their arms will fall off. Throwing the baseball is an unnatural motion and even though they are professionals, they aren't built with different ligaments than any of the rest of us."
orioles,3cj0xk,hcshock,2,Wed Jul 8 13:14:45 2015 UTC,Can't forget to mention Brach out of the bullpen. He has been so solid and has been able to pitch multiple strong innings when out SP has a rough start.
orioles,3cj0xk,tallNDawkward,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:43:42 2015 UTC,Our pitching has t been bad at all. It's been the hitting almost every single game that doesn't show up
orioles,3cj0xk,owlbrain,4,Wed Jul 8 17:23:22 2015 UTC,Looking at Gausman's pitchFX data he just had no accuracy yesterday. Fastball was all over the place and he didn't have control of his splitter which is his one good offspeed pitch. He needs to get the extra work in the minors this week.
orioles,3cj0xk,soapdealer,-7,Wed Jul 8 13:35:38 2015 UTC,"Gausman cannot fail, he can only be failed. Pitching prospects who can't throw breaking balls always work out!  It can only be because they kept him out of the rotation for that bum [whoever had the worst last start in the rotation]! HE JUST NEEDS STABILITY AND HE'LL BE CLAYTON KERSHAW!   Keep repeating this during his next 5 ER in 3 IP outing and you'll sound like all the fans I know.  Maybe he's just a relief pitcher long-term and we should start learning to accept that."
orioles,3cj0xk,xajii,7,Wed Jul 8 12:46:12 2015 UTC,"What are you on about? He's 23 and had 6 straight 5+ IP, sub-3 ER before yesterday. People have bad games. Gimme a break with this shit"
orioles,3cj0xk,soapdealer,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"He has a 5.00 ERA and a 4.35 xFIP in 2015 playing in front of an elite fielding team, despite half his innings this season coming in relief. I could buy the ""he needs to start, not relieve"" if he didn't have the repertoire (good fastball and changeup, no other above average pitches) of a reliever."
orioles,3cj0xk,xajii,6,Wed Jul 8 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"He's pitched 27 innings total in 2015, let's not get too ahead of ourselves with xFIP and ERA after what amounts to 3 full games of work.   In 2014 he had 9 QS in 20 appearances, and out of the other 11 games, only gave up over 3 runs 4 times. He has an absolutely nasty fastball and a highly effective changeup because of that. He's young. Writing him off at this point is one of the silliest things I have seen on this sub in a long time"
orioles,3cj0xk,Imsortofabigdeal,6,Wed Jul 8 14:49:17 2015 UTC,Is learning a third pitch a reasonable expectation for someone at this point in his career or no?
orioles,3cj0xk,soapdealer,4,Wed Jul 8 13:03:29 2015 UTC,Scouts say some guys just lack the ability to throw good breaking pitches and it's something you can't necessarily teach if the ability isn't there. Maybe Gausman is just a fastball/changeup guy.

orioles,3ch1x3,the2belo,3,Wed Jul 8 01:54:01 2015 UTC,Some in here really disappoint. This is a team with some glaring issues and trying to find its way forward. This is also a team only 1.5 from first place with an improving starting rotation and almost half of the season to play. Some of the comments in here seem like from the dark years. This is so far from that.
orioles,3ch1x3,SenatorGovernment,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"The O's are on a bad skid.   They have lost six of their last eight while hitting .095 with runners in scoring position.   The rotation has stopped improving. Norris and Tillman are struggling. Gausman has not proved he can be relied on.  That they are 1.5 games back in a division where everybody else is also struggling to pull away is nothing to get excited about. If they don't turn it around by the time they go to New York and Tampa, that 1.5 games back is going to turn into a much uglier number."
orioles,3ch1x3,the2belo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"Its been an ugly streak, that's for sure. I feel as though until they get   the roster settled, this team will sit in limbo. I just love this team, and this fan base and this sub."

orioles,3cf9fh,owlbrain,3,Tue Jul 7 13:58:01 2015 UTC,"Delmon Young's production at a 71 wRC+ means he was providing 29% less run production than the average major league hitter. I don't know what you were watching, but that's pretty darn terrible. 2 HRs and an atrocious glove doesn't exactly make for a guy you should be missing. He racked up -0.5 fWAR, meaning a scrub from Bowie would have been better in his spot.  Eight total extra base hits for Young in those 180 PAs. Parmelee? 10 already in just 71 PAs.  This isn't meant to jump down your throat on your opinion, but unfortunately there is just no argument out there than Delmon was worth a roster spot."
orioles,3cf9fh,onioning,2,Thu Jul 9 13:11:37 2015 UTC,Well Parmelee did get robbed of a easy double by Hicks last night. I'm not sure delmon could hit the ball that far anymore.

orioles,3cf9fh,onioning,2,Tue Jul 7 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"Parm is 2 years younger than delmon. Let's not pretend he's some rookie phenom.  Delmon is a better hitter in just about every category this year (ba, obp, slugging, ops) and had played a surprisingly nice right field this year whereas parm is apparently so bad in right they'd rather play cd there. Plus del has ice in his veins as a pinch hitter which is invaluable.  Not even a competition imo unless parm can step it up"
orioles,3cf9fh,tallNDawkward,3,Tue Jul 7 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Hes not so bad in the outfield that theyd rather have Davis in right, hes just that good at first base"
orioles,3cf9fh,avery_crudeman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:11:44 2015 UTC,"Chris is playing right because they think Parm is too good at first to not play him there.  Delmon's offensive stats are not good. FoR a guy who pretty much only brings offense, that's bad. Yeah, he's not as bad in right asa we feared, but he's still somewhere between ""bad"" and ""very bad."" There's really no spot on this team for him, and he was easily the least valuable player under the circumstances.  And yeah, Delmon is real chill as he grounds the first pitch he sees to short."
orioles,3cf9fh,tallNDawkward,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:27:21 2015 UTC,delmon's offensive stats aren't very good but they're almost all significantly better than parms.  and yea his defense isn't great but it's better than what davis has been bringing to the table in right.  much better.  so i still don't see why we didn't cut parm and keep davis at first and play del in right...or snider...or lough...or reimold...all of which are better than parm this year
orioles,3cf9fh,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,0,Tue Jul 7 21:50:10 2015 UTC,Where are you getting these numbers? Delmon was not better in SLG or OPS and that was the problem. All but eight of Delmon's hits this year were singles. Chris has already eclipsed that number of extra base hits in a little more than a third of the PAs Delmon got.

orioles,3cg0ix,Zes2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"It is unlikely that anyone around me will want it, but if they do I'll have to give it to a family member first. However, assuming that doesn't happen (and it won't), and that I do get there early enough to get one, I'll send it to you. Seems like your daughter's baptism is an okay reason to miss the game."

Even after I showed it to her and she agreed that she didn't like it, she still wants one. So I think I have to give it to my mom :/ Sorry to tell you the night before but I thought I'd give you as much notice as I can.

No prospects for that contract, we need what we have. Agree on a true stopper, although without one I'm of the mindset that that should be Britton, and the closer could be whoever (which will never happen)"

orioles,3cgafl,Mugtown,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:42:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's just about using him as stopper (like when the bases are loaded with one out in a close game) instead of closer (where he comes in anytime it's the 9th and you're winning by 3) so that you use him in the most advantageous situations."
orioles,3cgafl,Oriolesphilly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:56:06 2015 UTC,Cole has been one of the best pitchers in the game consistently and never had any injury issues.

orioles,3ci4ia,ThManW1thNoName,9,Wed Jul 8 02:21:27 2015 UTC,"I almost went off until I read your first sentence again. Buck Showalter is a terrific manager. And I'm not saying that because he manages my team. He truly is, and always will be one of the greatest tactical managers the game has ever seen.  It's hard to see now with this ""skid,"" but this man's mind is what I try to follow in steps to becoming a collegiate baseball coach. Baseball is hard because you don't get unlimited substitutions like football. So when someone makes a mistake, you have to let them play it out. And you only get 25 guys. So if multiples start screwing up, you have to think deeper...  ...Like 3 days in advance. For example, Buck may not use Norris out of the bullpen today, because he may need him to face a string of lefties in the next series. He may be in a save situation tomorrow night, but not use Britton, because he wants Britton to pitch in all the situations facing them against the Nationals.  No one has foresight like Buck Showalter, which is why I would leave the fan base if they ever relieved him, granted the team not have back to back 100-loss seasons. I mean this is a man who is rumored to sit in his office pre-game and flip through flashcards composing possible scenarios that he'll face, and logically think of the best ways to tackle that situation.   Recent managers to be in those situations you talk about:  Ryne Sandberg? The Phillies are a dumpster fire and he's not that cut out to be a full manager anyway.  Ron Roenicke? The Brewers go into every season thinking they're going to win the whole damn thing. If the manager isn't .750 by July every year and 8 games up, toast.  Bud Black?.......Well the Padres front office was just dumb for that move...  TL;DR, I can't name one manager in the AL who has better job security right now than the wickedly logical Buck Showalter."

orioles,3ci4ia,hideisalive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"This is not the right place for a Buck Showalter conversation unfortunately.  But the short version is no, he's not going to be fired this year pretty much no matter what.  If they went off a cliff this year he'd still rightly get at least a few months next year to fix it"
orioles,3ci4ia,aresef,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:10:18 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.   Long answer: No. Buck is one of the best minds in baseball, expertly moving the chess pieces to give us the best chance to win. Is it working out right now? No. But every team has slumps where nothing seems to be working. We are still in this thing, that's important. Buck has pulled up a team from a lot worse. He's pulled this team up from a lot worse.   Secondly, who would you possibly get to replace him? Would you work from he scrap heap of the year's fired or resigned managers? I look at Buck and I look at, say, Sandberg or Roenicke, it ain't even a contest."

orioles,3cck45,FlannelBeard,2,Tue Jul 7 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"4 straight seasons of 90+ losses is one reason. Another is that papa johns isn't popular in Minneapolis. There are 3 or 4 local chains that make so much better pizza in Punch (Neapolitan), davannis (traditional), pizza luce (traditional-ish), and mesa (crazy pizza that's fucking great). Add in the national chains, and papas barely cracks the top 10 for pizza in Minneapolis. And at 50% they probably still make a profit."
orioles,3cck45,EllieMayT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:13:05 2015 UTC,It's not much different for baltimore but orioles still have to score 5 or more runs AND win for us to get 50% off

The loss is completely on the offense and Tommy Hunter's complete unclutchness but you cannot give up homers on 0-2 pitches.  The O's lead the majors in 2 strike homers let up.

There are a bunch of ballhawks who go to most of the games and hang out there.  One of them caught 8 homers 2 years ago.  A few weeks back, 3 of my friends got homeruns in a 2 game span(having a 8 homer game helps).  I've caught one out there, but I've been real close a few other times.

orioles,3cd1iy,NotTooConcerned,2,Tue Jul 7 00:18:52 2015 UTC,Maybe try getting a seat out in CF bleachers.  I just checked stub hub and section 98 has a seat in row 3.  Definitely a chance of getting one there.  Righties will even hit it there.  You can then spend some time on the flagcourt as well.   Be forewarned though.

orioles,3c9mx6,jodatoufin,3,Mon Jul 6 13:12:08 2015 UTC,What makes you think Schoop is going to hit .300?  He might be able to hit 30 bombs but .300?  He profiles to peak more like 2011 Mark Reynolds. Which would be fine.
orioles,3c9mx6,hideisalive,3,Mon Jul 6 10:20:13 2015 UTC,He's batting 250 this year in what is his 2nd fullish year in the bigs. He might get to 300 but he could very easily be in the 280-290 range.
orioles,3c9mx6,jodatoufin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:51:12 2015 UTC,11 games is not a predictor of batting average.   Adam Jones hit .400 for April and no one assumed that was what he was going to do for the season.
orioles,3c9mx6,theoldbillybaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:10:49 2015 UTC,"I thought he had more games this year, but even so he's shown more potential as a hitter and its nut unreasonable to expect him to bat between .240 and .260 this year and have an even better year next year."

orioles,3c56cq,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,2,Sun Jul 5 18:34:22 2015 UTC,So what happens if Hardy needs a day off or gets something in his eye and has to come out of the game? (dont want to jinx him)  MACHADO TO SS!!!  Schoop at 3B  Pearce at 2B
orioles,3c56cq,onioning,3,Sun Jul 5 12:45:44 2015 UTC,Schoop at 3B was an experiment that didn't go well. I think Davis goes to 3B (an experiment that went alright) but everything else works out.
orioles,3c56cq,TweetPoster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"I know what you're sayin', and why you're sayin' it, but I think Schoop gets the shot at third before Chris. It's a pretty small sample size with each, and I think Schoop gives you the best defensive option at this time.  Mostly though, Hardy can't get hurt for the next couple days."

orioles,3c56cq,PrimeImplicant,11,Sat Jul 4 22:21:38 2015 UTC,They don't have options

orioles,3c56cq,GoodMolemanToYou,3,Sat Jul 4 22:36:27 2015 UTC,Anything extraordinary?? Take a gander at Snider's OBP.
orioles,3c56cq,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,0,Sun Jul 5 02:27:22 2015 UTC,It really boils down to Flaherty vs Parmelee going to AAA. Buck chose to replace Flaherty since its for Schoop. This gives him flexibility at first base (its obvious Parmelee > Pearce at 1st base) and allows him to have Davis in RF playing in the lineup as well.  Its a toss up overall. He'll be back im sure. I think it will come down to Lough vs Pearce here in a few weeks.
orioles,3c58ng,JanuaryJoe5,5,Sat Jul 4 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"""Options"" is such a misleading word as it implies a player can be sent down only so many times. It's shorthand for option years in which a big league player may be optioned down to a minor league team. A player's first few years on the major-league roster, they can be optioned to the minors at basically any time. Example: we have optioned Dylan Bundy to the minors each year since 2012. Since we called him up to toss an inning and change in 2012, this is the last year he may be optioned and he cannot be sent down next year.  If a player is optioned, he may not return to the big league club for 10 days except if someone on the 25 goes on the DL.   DFA is designated for assignment. This is how you remove a player from the 40-man roster. A team then has 10 days to do one of the following: trade him, waive him, outright him to the minors or release him. A player may be outrighted just once in his career without his consent. If a player is released, the club is still on the hook for that contract. Theoretically, you're right that a player can re-sign, but I would imagine that doesn't happen often.   Example: Delmon Young was out of options and the Orioles needed an arm, so we had to DFA him. Because he has been outrighted before, we would need his consent to do it again. However, Duquette is exploring trades and still has a few more days to figure something out.   Edit: accidentally a few words about 10 day rule for options"
orioles,3c58ng,aresef,2,Sat Jul 4 23:21:21 2015 UTC,"Just a little nitpick, but it didn't matter for Bundy if he was called up in 2012 or not because he was signed back when major league contracts were allowed in the draft. That's why he was on the 40-man the whole time and burning options."
orioles,3c58ng,Heartless_Tortoise,2,Sun Jul 5 07:34:24 2015 UTC,Good point. Old CBA
orioles,3c58ng,aresef,3,Sun Jul 5 15:13:12 2015 UTC,Every player begins their career with 3 (IIRC) options. If an option is used during the season it is pretty much unlimited on how many times the players goes up and down (however when sent down you have to wait a certain amount of time before calling them up again) but at the end of the season that player loses an option
orioles,3c58ng,EllieMayT,3,Sat Jul 4 23:20:27 2015 UTC,"This is from a previous comment I've made:   A player has three minor league option years that start once they're placed on the 40 man. If you option a player to the minor leagues, call them up later, and then send them back down again later, they've been demoted from the 25 man roster twice but it only counts as one option because it was the same year.   When a player is DFA'd, they are ""Designated for Assignment,"" get removed from the 40 man and placed on waivers where teams have 10 days to place a claim on him or the original team can move him back to the 40 man. If a team claims him, they're on the hook for the remainder of the contract. Claims are handled with the worst team getting priority.  If no team claims the player after 10 days, the player can be sent to the minors or released. If a player has been DFA'd before, they can refuse the minor league assignment and become a free agent. A player with at least five years of major league service time can also refuse the assignment, even if he's never been DFA'd before.   Now, regarding your questions.  Options:   As mentioned above, you get three options, starting when you get placed on the 40 man roster.  Once those three are used, there are no more options for the player in their career. They're only relevant to a player's rookie contract. Nope, you get just the three for your career. Nope. It's for as long as the club wants.   DFA:   As metioned elsewhere, it's getting Designated for Assignment. Yes, this happens.  An example from this year.  The Rays DFA'd Grant Balfour on April 18th and released him on April 29th.  On May 5th, he signed a minor league deal with the Rays.  He was released again on May 29th. Yes, they have 10 days where they're in ""DFA Limbo.""  So if you DFA a player because you have a better option behind them but then in that 10 day span, their replacement gets injured, you can bring back the DFA'd player, provided there's room on the 40 man roster.  Remember, there are two types of DLs.  The 15 day DL removes the player from the 25 man roster but keeps them on the 40 man.  Players on the 60 day DL don't count against the 40 man but need to stay on the DL for at least 60 days.  You can move someone from the 15 day to the 60 day but not the other way around.  So, let's say John Doe hurts his leg and is put on the 15 day DL.  He's on the DL for 10 days when the club decides they want to promote a prospect to the team but need to add the prospect to the 40 man.  They don't want to DFA someone so they move John Doe to the 60 day DL.  Those 10 days count against his 60 day DL time so he can be activated in 50 days. Because the club might want that player or they don't want another team to get that player.  As mentioned above regarding waivers, the worst team gets first crack at them, then the second worst, and so on.  You don't know which other teams have submitted claims so if you can gamble that no other team will claim them.  Or you can submit a claim and ensure you get them. Best case scenario for the club when a player is DFA'd is they're able to trade the player and get something in return.  It's never anything good, but whatever.  Next best would be someone claims the player and they are relieved of their salary.  Ideally, the player doesn't end up on a division rival and go on to destroy the initial team."

orioles,3c58ng,yesthismessismine,2,Sun Jul 5 04:23:36 2015 UTC,Just wanted to also mention that in some cases a player can get a 4th option year if they miss enough time in a season.
orioles,3c58ng,Heartless_Tortoise,-5,Sun Jul 5 07:38:35 2015 UTC,"DFA stands for Designated For Assignment, which essentially means they're moving a play from Major to AAA/AA/A or vice versa"

orioles,3c56k0,aresef,2,Sat Jul 4 22:10:03 2015 UTC,No reason we should have 6 outfielders on the roster and option Flhart.
orioles,3c56k0,eternallurker,3,Sat Jul 4 22:30:28 2015 UTC,Not really anybody to option out there.
orioles,3c56k0,eternallurker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:55:30 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love Jonathan Cano more than anyone, but Flhart is an asset up here. He's also been hitting. Tough to see from my perspective"
orioles,3c56k0,kdizzle10,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"Is he consistently hitting? I am not a big fan of Flaherty, but I'm willing to hear an argument in his support... Can someone actually prove he's worth keeping around?"
orioles,3c56k0,hideisalive,2,Sun Jul 5 03:20:45 2015 UTC,He plays every postition on the field while being a replacement level bat.  Done. Proved.
orioles,3c56k0,kdizzle10,0,Sun Jul 5 16:56:21 2015 UTC,"There are other players (Machado, Davis, Pearce) that can play multiple positions as well. Granted, some of their bats aren't there right now. However, Flaherty has only recently been producing consistently."
orioles,3c56k0,hideisalive,0,Sun Jul 5 18:04:55 2015 UTC,He's a utility player.
orioles,3c56k0,ChosenGSR,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:18:31 2015 UTC,Is JS consistently hitting?  It's not like he was batting 300 before his injury.  I mean I think his ceiling is far higher than Ron Flattery's but I don't think he'll just step in and we'll see far elevated level of play for that position.
orioles,3c56k0,kdizzle10,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:04:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant Flaherty"
orioles,3c56k0,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"He hit very well to start the season and has hit well in rehab, and it's not very common that a knee injury makes you see/hit the ball worse.   It's almost like a Wieters / Joseph dance all over again. Schoop is our 2B, he's back and he's there now.   In regards to Flaherty he chose Parmelee for now so he can have Davis and Pamelee with power in the lineup. Pearce and Paredes will be our backup IF."
orioles,3c56k0,hideisalive,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:43:57 2015 UTC,Schoop platoones last year. He was never able to seize the position until Flats had to play third because he can't hit
orioles,3c56k0,eternallurker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"Look at Flharts utility to play almost every position,  his average and his average with RISP. While not flashy, he's a very solid player."
orioles,3c56k0,hideisalive,-2,Sun Jul 5 15:50:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't see what Schoops adds right now. Especially since he's struggling at AA
orioles,3c56k0,bruce540,2,Sat Jul 4 23:01:50 2015 UTC,A homerun on his first at-bat...
orioles,3c56k0,hideisalive,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:35:10 2015 UTC,Too bad there are hundreds of atbats in a season
orioles,3c56k0,bruce540,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:47:30 2015 UTC,Just more opportunities for him to hit HRs.
orioles,3c56k0,hideisalive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:32:29 2015 UTC,There's a lot more to if someone is productive or not then homeruns.
orioles,3c56k0,bruce540,2,Mon Jul 6 10:35:00 2015 UTC,But they help. Not sure why you're such a downer on Schoop.
orioles,3c56k0,hideisalive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:37:34 2015 UTC,"He graded out as one of the worst hitters in all of baseball last year. I believe it was the lowest OBP of anyone qualified and an OPS of just 67. (where 100 is baseline)  Struck out 10 times more than he walked.  He actually got worse as the season went in those departments, as well  This is why I'm down on Schoop"

orioles,3c25or,seekadviceelsewhere,4,Sat Jul 4 10:21:27 2015 UTC,Just cut Bud and let him find work somewhere else to try to get a good deal in the off season.  Making him a reliever isn't doing either party a favor

orioles,3c0u1c,TheBaltimoron,10,Fri Jul 3 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"I really think Showalter's most under appreciated asset is the mastery of the post game interview. He always speaks to an ideal of his players. Whenever one of them screws up, he never throws them under the bus. It's always stuff like ""we all know he's a better player than what we saw last night.""   I compare this to Trembly, who's interviews were entertaining as hell. Trembly called it straight more often than not, but it was almost if he was talking behind the player's backs to the media as if the players don't watch interviews. The lesson of Showalter is that he's a manager 24/7 and his true thoughts are deeply guarded."

orioles,3c0u1c,the2belo,9,Fri Jul 3 23:50:26 2015 UTC,"I've read in a few interviews that Buck Showalter changed dramatically after spending years in the wilderness on ESPN. He use to micromanage everything dealing with the teams on the field and off and it burned out a lot of his players.   When Showalter came in with the Orioles he was a lot looser and more tolerant, especially in terms of clubhouse culture. For instance, many have noted that the Showalter of the 90s would've burned the clubhouse down rather than allow ping pong, now he encourages it. He also bends over backwards in interviews to praise the players, deflecting all accolades for himself."

Maybe it has something to do with living in the area and having lots of fans, but IMO the fans are the good thing about going to an A's game.  Stadium is shit though. Kinda reminiscent of Memorial, which makes me all nostalgic, but still shit.  You wanna see shitty fans at a baseball game? Cross the bay."
orioles,3by5ys,onioning,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:39:50 2015 UTC,Really? Every Giants game I've been to has been great. Different experiences I guess.
orioles,3by5ys,TofuMignon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"It's a cool stadium for sure. The crowd just reminds me of the old days at Camden when the Yankees were in town. So much corporate showmanship.  Also, ten dollar beers offend me. The Giants have one of the most commercial stadiums. Oakland has one of the least. I mean, dollar dog night, or some twelve dollar nachos?  And it's not like I even eat ballpark food. It just makes the environment all wrong. Seems more like an amusement park than a ballgame.  Though yeah, just as far as the structures themselves, the Giant's stadium is like fifty thousand times nicer than Oakland's slab of concrete...  Edit: Just FWIW, I'll add that I'm far more into the Giants as a team than the A's. I'd just rather see a ballgame in Oakland."
orioles,3by5ys,onioning,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:25:26 2015 UTC,"Fans are fine.  You'll find the people at A's games are not the same people that give Oakland a bad rap.  You're more likely to see someone from Piedmont at the game than someone from the Acorn.   The stadium is truly the worst you'll ever see though.   I like to park over on Hegenberger and walk over for Raiders games because of the traffic, but for A's games you're usually fine.   (also it depends where you're staying - if you're close to a BART station, just do that - there is a BART stop right at the Coliseum)"
orioles,3by5ys,thelawtalkingguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:56:20 2015 UTC,I had a great time there as Os fan! Lots of great banter with the As fans   It's certainly true that the stadium is ugly though

Fair warning, the Coliseum is nothing compared to Camden Yards, and rather dirty, so don't come with high expectations for the stadium itself. As for the A's fans, they're pretty awesome. Great bunch of hecklers, but they mean well. Just don't get bleacher seats because that's where it gets rowdy. Beers are fairly cheap too (well compared to the Giants game that is)"

Though I stand by my stance that I think its hilarious when uninformed people make baseball trade proposals.

orioles,3bwfkv,tdw96,3,Thu Jul 2 18:59:53 2015 UTC,I also think it's interesting how Buck has him start against the Jays and now the Rangers.  He certainly isn't giving him any breaks.
orioles,3bwfkv,Miguelpaco,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"Right? I recall a tough start or two against the Tigers as well. Every time he gets the ball I think that it's going to be the defining start that cements him in to the rotation, and he always shows flashes of dominating stuff. He just needs to show more consistency inning after inning."
orioles,3bwfkv,Tophersaurus168,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:55:26 2015 UTC,All he's gotta do to be better than Bud is not give up four homers.
orioles,3bwfkv,tdw96,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:08:08 2015 UTC,True. I'd like to see him absolutely dominate tonight.
orioles,3bwfkv,romorr,2,Thu Jul 2 19:10:56 2015 UTC,"I think its fair to say that Gausman is probably the better starter going forward anyway.  The reason Norris keeps starting I think is to increase his trade value.  There has to be a breaking point though where the Orioles winning games wins out over increasing a trade chips value.  July is as good as time as any to me.    At some point, there aren't enough starts left for Norris to increase his value before the 31st.  Don't expect much if we do trade Norris, he is still owed millions."

orioles,3bszyp,hannahmadamhannah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:20:36 2015 UTC,Definitely. I can see myself jumping around as the ball rolls to wall.
orioles,3bszyp,cptcliche,7,Thu Jul 2 13:02:06 2015 UTC,"well with Chris Davis a regular in right field in favor of parm at 1B and snider in LF with lough, reimold, and Pearce on the bench this seems to make sense."
orioles,3bszyp,EJayDoubleU,6,Thu Jul 2 02:04:38 2015 UTC,i don't really get this.  delmon young is better than pearce imo and has proven it over his ten year career whereas pearce has proven to be a subpar player with one good year.  even this year delmon is playing better than pearce.  kinda sad to see him go cuz there's no way somebody wont pick him up
orioles,3bszyp,tallNDawkward,21,Wed Jul 1 22:18:25 2015 UTC,Pearce can play multiple positions. Delmon Young can't play any positions.
orioles,3bszyp,G_I_Joe_Mansueto,2,Wed Jul 1 22:36:19 2015 UTC,SHHHHHHHHHHH!
orioles,3bszyp,tootall34,4,Wed Jul 1 22:39:56 2015 UTC,i hate to say it but delmon hasn't been half bad in the of this year.  what is it 8 of assists?  he may look like a little leaguer when a fly ball is hit his way but he's adequate.  as good as davis or pearce anyways
orioles,3bszyp,tallNDawkward,2,Wed Jul 1 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"He's also big on the Cespedes assist, where you create an opportunity for the assist by playing the ball poorly in the first place.  Not that he's that bad, but he's clearly subpar. If he really hit he'd be adequate. He doesn't though, so that's kinda that."
orioles,3bszyp,onioning,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:28:52 2015 UTC,Yeah except that's the only place he can play.

orioles,3bszyp,tallNDawkward,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:12 2015 UTC,alright if we trade him i'll understand it.  nobody would want pearce del is probably the easiest to deal
orioles,3bszyp,ECU_Drummer,2,Wed Jul 1 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why noone would want Pearce when he's proven he can play corner OF, 1B and 2B.  I feel like he would be the easier piece to move over Delmon because of his flexibility."
orioles,3bszyp,tallNDawkward,3,Wed Jul 1 22:26:23 2015 UTC,you need to prove you can hit which he's only done for one year
orioles,3bszyp,ECU_Drummer,4,Wed Jul 1 22:39:02 2015 UTC,Let's not pretend like either of these guys are valuable for their consistent bats.  The versatility Pearce offers would make him a more valuable player since he can sub in and out of multiple positions.  I haven't seen Delmon have the same abilities.
orioles,3bszyp,tallNDawkward,0,Wed Jul 1 22:44:25 2015 UTC,"delmon has proven he can hit way better than pearce.  look at their career batting numbers.  pearce is .250 delmon is .280.  he may be inconsistent in the field, he won't draw walks, but he'll hit"
orioles,3bszyp,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,3,Wed Jul 1 22:47:28 2015 UTC,Delmon has a career .737 OPS and 98 OPS+. Steve Pearce has a career .755 OPS and 106 OPS+. Pearce has also been a much more valuable fielder than Delmon.
orioles,3bszyp,ECU_Drummer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"I get it, I really do.  Where does that fall in when you have a guy like Buck that values the defense?"
orioles,3bszyp,tallNDawkward,0,Wed Jul 1 22:50:59 2015 UTC,"delmon's played the field as well as pearce this year.  keeping a guy around cuz he's an adequate second baseman (when you have schoop coming back and flaherty) and plays first (when you have reimold, parmalee and davis who all have experience at first) just isn't worth a 30 pt drop in BA.  imo"
orioles,3bszyp,PrimeImplicant,2,Wed Jul 1 22:55:39 2015 UTC,Batting average is useless. Case in point: Delmon is batting about 50 pts higher this year yet they get on base at roughly the same rate.
orioles,3bszyp,ECU_Drummer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"We'll have to agree to disagree. Pearce is a slightly less flexible version of Flaherty when Flaherty has had horrible offensive years.  I'm not saying he's a sure bet to stay on the roster, I'm just saying IMO he would be the better tool to hang on to in this situation."
orioles,3bszyp,PrimeImplicant,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:58:10 2015 UTC,Never look at average.  Just OBP
orioles,3bszyp,jerryt113,2,Thu Jul 2 02:56:17 2015 UTC,Average matters when there's runners in scoring position. Is there a stat to measure RBI opportunities lost?
orioles,3bszyp,soapdealer,3,Thu Jul 2 13:00:15 2015 UTC,Steve Pearce has had horrible BABIP luck and still has a better wRC+ (81) than Delmon Young (72) in 2015. It shouldn't have to be said that he played MUCH better than Delmon Young in 2014.   Add to that the fact that Pearce plays multiple positions very well and Delmon Young can't play a single position at an average level and the choice is easy.
orioles,3bszyp,itsernst,2,Wed Jul 1 22:57:52 2015 UTC,He could be traded even though he got DFA'd.  Honestly...he and Reimold are redundant.  Pearce can spell the outfielders and play out there as well.  It doesn't make sense to keep both.
orioles,3bszyp,PrimeImplicant,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:28 2015 UTC,He will be. Duke's in talks with other execs.
orioles,3bszyp,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:51 2015 UTC,He'll get a bag of balls for Delmon at this point. The red sox could actually swoop in here and snag him since they'll have a relatively early opportunity given their record.
orioles,3bszyp,tallNDawkward,2,Thu Jul 2 02:55:09 2015 UTC,Delmon has easily been the worst player on the team. He has a -0.4 WAR this year and Pearce has a 0.5 WAR.
orioles,3bszyp,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:08:41 2015 UTC,this is why i hate war.  if i look at baseball reference del has a positive war and pearce has negative.
orioles,3bszyp,idrivetherapevan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:11:22 2015 UTC,Ok Steve Pearce has a higher OPS than Delmon even though his average is 50 points lower. Pearce is easily a better fielder as well.
orioles,3bszyp,iBeReese,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"Delmon is a better hitter, Pierce is a better defender and has way more versatility."
orioles,3bszyp,MarcoPolo10,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"Buck has said you need to be a solid defender to play on this team. Steve isn't a gold glove, but he is reliable in four different positions. Delmon has a cannon for an arm, but also runs like he has a cannon on his back."

orioles,3btp92,Tophersaurus168,5,Thu Jul 2 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"As far as indicators for regression go, the two things that stick out are his .392 BABIP and his 78.2 Z-Swing% (the percentage of pitches swung at inside the strike zone) which is up from last year.  However, aside from this season he saw his most plate appearances in 2011 and 2013. In those seasons he posted a 78.2, 76.1 Z-Swing%, so it's plausible that it won't drop much at all.   Hopefully that means his line drive percentage stays up and he can pull a Steve Pearce and keep his BABIP above league average for a whole season."
orioles,3btp92,socsa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:34:33 2015 UTC,"So, like usual, sabermetrics made you sound really knowledgeable, but didn't really tell us anything useful."
orioles,3btp92,Tophersaurus168,4,Thu Jul 2 11:39:01 2015 UTC,"No, it means that all things considered, these numbers are unlikely. BABIP is fairly consistent. When you hit about it, it's likely to come back down. What it implies is luck when you're hitting. Things are going your way. However, it is possible to ""cheat the system"" and sustain being above it for while. But, on average, that doesn't happen.  His Z-Swing% is high, but we don't have a lot of data on him to be able to make a determination. That's how sample sizes work. You need data points to be able to draw conclusions.  This is how all statistics work, in everything, across the world, wherever they're applied. We can see things outside the normal range, and looking at all the data we have for these topics, we can infer that these are the things that regularly happen, and at what rate, and what the chances are for those things not happening as well. So we can see ""he's getting hits on balls in balls at a higher clip that usual, which usually means it'll come down. He specifically has never this many plate appearances, so it's hard to say for sure against his own numbers, but league-wide, this is the most likely scenario."""

FIP, for example, is a straight statistical oxymoron.  I mean, just look at Chen's interview where he says that having guys like Manny playing behind him gets his head straight.  I understand the desire to isolate intangibles, but you can't make statistically dependent variables independent just by saying they are."

I wouldn't hold it against him, despite how wreckless these comments are. I really don't think HoF pitcher Jim Palmer is influencing too many people in this regard.  I think it's important to note people that hold these views truly are few and far between. This shouldn't detract from his baseball acumen, which is superb. He's baseball player, not a doctor or scientist. Many of us can't begin to imagine what it's like to be the parent of a child with ASD."
orioles,3brvhg,yesthismessismine,2,Thu Jul 2 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"I think the broader problem is that these parents and others look for something to blame, find the vaccine claims and latch onto them, disregarding all substantial credible evidence to the contrary and looking at everything to that narrow lens. All the regulators must, therefore, be corrupt. All the pharma cos are trying to hurt children, all the researchers are bought and paid for. It's like dealing with truthers, steel beams and all that.   Autism onsets in children around the age they are recommended to get the shot but correlation is not causation. A world without these vaccines would have the same rate of autism diagnoses and plenty more kids dead of easily preventable diseases. That's the real danger here."

orioles,3bsimz,Musicalcurves,3,Thu Jul 2 01:19:33 2015 UTC,Close game and who knows Chen could be gassed even though he only threw 87. I'd rather be safe than sorry. We need this W.

There's an old, defunct Pizza Hut near where I live and people just drop their cats off at it (there's a small wooded area behind it).  Makes me sad but a lot of good samaritans feed them... but that also keeps the cycle going and people think it's fine to abandon their cats.  Sometimes when you're driving down the road and look over you will see like 20 cats just chilling at Pizza Hut.  I'd go pet them but I've heard they're in bad shape physically. :("

orioles,3boicr,HappyMan420,15,Tue Jun 30 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"Flash is probably the obvious answer, but I'm gonna throw a wildcard in there and say   Christopher Lyn Davis.  We all know what he can do at 1B, as he puts up totals of 126 HRs and 341 RBIs .  He hits .272 while playing at 3B.  He had a .922 fielding percentage at LF in the minors.  He has a perfect SB% when he plays in RF (maybe it motivates him to run faster) and has only 1 career error at the position.  He also has his best BA at .278 and put up 60 RBIs in only 85 games when DHing.  Plus the biggest thing he has over Flash is a perfect 0.00 ERA over his career and has struck out both the powerhouses of Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Adrian Gonzalez on only 3 pitches each.  So 1B, 3B, RF, LF, DH, and a true lights out Closer.  Flaherty can do some stuff too though. (I think he's probably more versatile though, just fun to look at Crush's numbers)  Edit - And yes, he is 1 for 1 with steal attempts while playing RF."

orioles,3boicr,mrb11n,2,Tue Jun 30 22:52:54 2015 UTC,Delmon can almost play DH.
orioles,3boicr,AshamedGorilla,8,Wed Jul 1 06:11:03 2015 UTC,"As /u/ngatachance said, Flaherty is the obvious choice.    But I would like to throw another player out there,    Steven Wayne Pearce  Last year Pearce did a great job for filling in for Chris Davis at 1B. While at 1B for 51 games, he had a fielding percentage of .998. He set his career high in BA (.293), Home Runs (21), RBIs (49), Runs (51), and doubles (26). Throughout the whole year last year, he also played LF, RF, and DH.    This year, his batting has certainly dropped a fair amount. However, when both Schoop and Flaherty were hurt this year, he did a fantastic job of filling in at 2B. He has played 18 games at 2B for us this year with 0 errors.    Also, back in 2011, when he was with the Pirates, he played 3B for 10 games. Although his Fielding percentage was .895, I do believe he would be able to be a decent third baseman now.    Even though last year may have been a fluke with his bat, I feel like Pearce has the potential to fill in at 1B, 2B, 3B, LF, RF, and DH. This is pretty versatile compared to many other players on our team. He may not be the best player available, but when talking about versatile players on the team, his name needs to be thrown in there."
orioles,3boicr,JanuaryJoe5,0,Tue Jun 30 23:55:57 2015 UTC,"He's probably #2, but it's a distant #2. Flats is excellent all over the diamond. Pearce is somewhat below average to somewhat above average at a few spots. Don't think he could hold down 3B. Doesn't have the arm for it.   I wouldn't be surprised if Pearce was the third catcher up though. Seems like he could handle it in a pinch. Probably not very well, but he'd pull it off."
orioles,3boicr,onioning,0,Wed Jul 1 06:10:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I completely agree that Flaherty is easily our most versatile player, I just wanted to throw something else in instead of just seeing Flaherty by everyone. And even though Pearce isn't the most versatile, he's still pretty versatile."

orioles,3boicr,Dharma_Lion,-1,Wed Jul 1 00:23:10 2015 UTC,"Parmelee has three spots. 1B, RF, LF. He excels at none.  Flats has seven. He's very good to awesome at at least six of them."
orioles,3boicr,onioning,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:13:48 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you came to this conclusion.    Parm is a + defender at 1B and has been ""very good"" in the outfield this year."

Maybe he is a plus defender. Doesn't really change anything.  In any event, he's a corner OF and 1B. That isn't great versatility. It's not horrible, but definitely not great, and certainly not even in the ballpark as Flahts as far as versatility."
orioles,3boicr,onioning,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"In the context of OP's question we can agree, Parmelee shouldn't be in the versatility discussion.    You said ""Parmelee has three spots. 1B, RF, LF. He excels at none."", which is a false statement."
orioles,3bn5ix,aresef,14,Tue Jun 30 15:45:52 2015 UTC,Even ERod is still far from a proven commodity so far
orioles,3bn5ix,BaltimoreBirdGuy,6,Tue Jun 30 16:32:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but he's sure flashed some upside."
orioles,3bn5ix,BaltimoreBirdGuy,6,Tue Jun 30 16:34:50 2015 UTC,True but so did Daniel Cabrera. I just don't think it's rational to make any judgments about the results of that trade until at least 2017
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:08:26 2015 UTC,"I think its laughable to say Cabrera flashed some upside like ERod has.  Go read some scouting reports and see if anyone thought Cabrera had upside similar to Eduardo.  Sure he threw hard, but he never had anywhere close to the control Eduardo has."
orioles,3bn5ix,BaltimoreBirdGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:14:35 2015 UTC,I definitely remember there being debate over whether Bedard or Cabrera would turn out better. He was dominant for a couple of months and even finished third in rookie of the year voting despite struggling late in the season. If anything Cabrera showed way more flashes than ERod has so far.
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:00:37 2015 UTC,"He was ROY because his record was 12-8, not because he was good.  Go look at his ML stats and minor league stats and its easy to see why he never amounted to much.  But you throw 98+ and people fall in love with that even though he walked 5+ a game.  Then go look at what Eduardo has done and take into consideration his age at the level.  You wanna hope Eduardo fails?  Wanna compare him to someone of equal standing?  Try Matusz.  Number 4 prospect who had a stellar second half during his rookie year."
orioles,3bn5ix,BaltimoreBirdGuy,2,Wed Jul 1 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"Eduardo had no control before he went to boston.  He showed flashes but no consistency in our minor league system (which is pretty much what everyone good enough to be a prospect does, including cabrera).  His control seems to have largely developed when Boston coaching changed his delivery but it remains to be seen if this change will lead to sustainable control for him.  Cabrera's first two months: 12 starts, 2.9 ERA and 6.5 innings/start.  Rodriguez so far: 7 starts, 3.92 ERA and 5.9 innings/start.  Of the starts, Cabrera had 4 dominant starts, and 2 disasterous ones.  Of the remaining 6, I'd say for 5 were good and 1 was mediocre (5 IP, 3 runs, 2 ER).  Rodriguez had 3 dominant starts and 2 disastrous ones.  The other 2 were both solid.    Cabrera looked damn good the first time that teams saw him and while it's easy to say he only got hype for being tall and throwing hard, the reality is that he put up crazy numbers when he first came up.  He was 3rd in ROY largely for a dominant first two months regardless of record. His early career numbers are similar or better than ERod's but it just turned out that teams figured him and he couldnt adjust so he's remembered as being crap.  Ultimately he had one of the better starts to career that I've seen and that's why I compared him to Rodriguez."
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:36:40 2015 UTC,"You realize he had a 5.0 ERA and walked more than he struck out his rookie year?  And during his minor league games he had the same issues, walking about 5 per 9?  Cabrera was never, ever in the same  league when it comes to Eduardo.   Eduardo is Maddux when compared to Cabrera, walking only 2.8 per 9 in the minors.  I can't believe I am still debating this.  Sure, Eduardo might have struggled a bit in 2013, but he was only 20 years old in Double A.  He still only had a 4.22 ERA, while walking 3.8 per 9 with 8.9 Ks per 9, at 20 years old.  I heard this shit before, oh he was struggling in 2013, and then he struggled in 2014.  Do people even know he was hurt to start 2014?  He didn't pitch for a month and when he started to pitch again, according to outside scouts, he was still favoring the knee.  Most people didn't know much about Eduardo before he got traded. All they knew was that he was a prospect.  Its annyoing, Ive followed his career for years and to hear fans dismiss him once he got traded is really irritating."
orioles,3bn5ix,BaltimoreBirdGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"As I said, Cabrera was brilliant for 2 months and then showed what he really was.  However, his first few months in the majors were better than Eduardo's.  I'm not really sure why you are ignoring that.  I get that you seem to be personally invested in Rodriguez but you need to take a step back.  No prospect is guarenteed and while he has been very good so far, he's also been a bit inconsistent and is anything but proven, which is all i said.  Somehow you interpreted me saying it's too soon to make a judgment of what ERod is as I 'wanna hope Eduardo fails,' which is not even remotely what I said.  You then said that Cabrera never showed flashes like ERod has but in truth, Cabrera showed more flashes in the majors than ERod has so far.  The entire point I was making is that it's too soon in Rodriguez' career to make a judgement about him but you seem so personally offended by other fans talking about ERod that you are ignoring everything I said.    I never said ERod will or should fail.  I never even said he's a better prospect than Cabrera.  All I said was that Cabrera was one of the top prospects with the O's and then came up and showed flashes of brilliance in the majors.    As a sidenote, considering 2013 was teh first time he pitched above A ball, I'd say struggling in 2013 is pretty relevant if 2014 was injury related then that makes 2013 even more relevant.  If you judged him as a can't miss prospect before that when he had only seen low A batters then I'd argue that was insanely too early to make that kind of a judgement.  That being said, the best basis to judge his major league ability is on his major league performance so far.  That tells me has potential but is nowhere near proven.  I'm not sure what about that is controversial to you..."
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:39:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think we are going to change each others mind.  My stance will always be that it was a horrible trade that will haunt the Orioles for years to come.  Usually when these things happen, and I have seen it elsewhere, people turn on the traded player, and its unfair.    In trades with prospects, its all about value, and Eduadro had more value than 3 months of Miller.    Anyway,  I am sure you are just as tired of this topic as I am, so take it easy."

orioles,3bn5ix,SquishSquash81,6,Tue Jun 30 17:13:20 2015 UTC,"Why? If the reason is because our coaching wouldn't allow him to throw his best pitch, that's a really, really good reason to change how your coaching or development works, because we missed out on one of the best talents in the majors because of it."
orioles,3bn5ix,Heartless_Tortoise,8,Tue Jun 30 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"I don't get why everybody thinks the cutter is banned in the majors. We have multiple pitchers who throw cutters. The focus in development is on strengthening breaking pitches because they're usually more effective than cutters (and because it can be a crutch), so they ban the cutter for young guns. But Arrieta is succeeding because of more than the cutter, he's retooled his mechanics in a style that he likes, yet is a style most guys can't or don't want to use. He's talked about adjusting his mechanics mid-delivery I believe, and relying on athleticism more than mechanics. It's great for him but not the kind of coaching most organizations use."
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,3,Tue Jun 30 18:04:36 2015 UTC,So we had him for years and couldn't get his delivery straight and in a matter of weeks it happens with the Cubs?
orioles,3bn5ix,Heartless_Tortoise,2,Tue Jun 30 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""a matter of weeks""? 9 starts of 4.94 FIP in 2013 and some time in the minors to start 2014? He definitely took some time for the Cubs to iron out. And I don't know what's so strange about the concept, there's a lot of fine tuning involved to get to the top, maybe he needed to be with this specific coach to realize what he needed to do. Sure we could develop better, but sometimes it takes very specific circumstances."
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, we had him for 6+ years, they had him for a few months, allow the cutter and he turns into an all star type pitcher.  The Orioles fucked up with Jake, the Cubs didn't.  This is a trend with the Orioles, Matusz, Britton, Arrieta, are just the latest round of starters that have failed in an Oriole uniform.  We could go back and continue to add names to the failed starter list, but why, its depressing enough.  And now this shit with Gausman, I really wonder if the Orioles are even able to correct a deficiency in their own system.  Edit:  The last pitcher the Orioles took out of HS that they developed was Sotrm Davis, who had a career 17.1 WAR.  So not even a great pitcher, just a servicable one.  There is something wrong with the way the Orioles develop starting pitching.  Seeing Jake fail here and succeed elsewhere is just frustrating.  Its getting to the point where I hope the Orioles change philosopys and draft bats."
orioles,3bn5ix,Heartless_Tortoise,2,Tue Jun 30 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"I don't dispute developmental issues with the O's, I just think Arrieta and the cutter is really off-base. Duquette is the one who implemented the policy on cutters in the minors, so why didn't Jake throw it in 2010 or 2011?"
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think our averison with the cutter started with DD, he just further reinforced the idea.  Though I have no idea if I am right with that.  Whether or not we had a no cutter policy then, Jake went from 0% cutter usage with us, to 30% with the Cubs.  Why didn't we see that a new pitch, like the cutter could add value to Jakes arsenal?  We traded Jake Arrieta, Eduardo Rodriguez, Pedro Strop for Scott Feldman and Andrew Miller.  I wont add the years and salary because that would depress further."
orioles,3bn5ix,Heartless_Tortoise,2,Tue Jun 30 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"Because it's not even a new pitch per se. He just kept fiddling with his slider and it became a cutter sometimes. Maybe we gave up too early, maybe it's not reasonable to expect teams to give guys a 5th chance at age 27. This article tells a pretty good story of his change, and I don't see any way the O's could have known he'd suddenly figure it all out."
orioles,3bn5ix,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,2,Tue Jun 30 20:47:19 2015 UTC,Britton's problem was he was brought up too early and then had major shoulder problems.
orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:38:11 2015 UTC,"Well, bringing him up too early just reinforces my idea that the Orioles pitching developmental process is in need of a rework.  I don't know if he was brought up too early or not, he just might not be good enough to start in the MLs."
orioles,3bn5ix,SquishSquash81,2,Tue Jun 30 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"If you think I was over simplifying, fair enough. But either way it was a horrendous failure on our part, and one that it took the Cubs very little time to fix. We need to be better."
orioles,3bn5ix,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,3,Tue Jun 30 18:22:34 2015 UTC,Because he was a headcase who needed a change of scenary.
orioles,3bn5ix,SquishSquash81,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"This seems like a whole lotta post hoc. He needed a ""change of scenery"" because our coaches weren't letting him throw his best pitch. And while I dispute he was ever a headcase (headcases don't dominate in the bigs like he does) gee, I wonder if not letting you throw your best pitch would have some sort of mental ramifications of your confidence?  This had nothing to do with Jake. It was 100% the O's fault."
orioles,3bn5ix,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,3,Tue Jun 30 18:18:42 2015 UTC,He was definitely a headcase. He would cruise threw 2 or 3 innings and then he we just stop throwing strikes the second he gave up a couple of baserunners.
orioles,3bn5ix,SquishSquash81,-1,Tue Jun 30 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"Do you have any proof of this, or are we resorting to the ever reliable anecdote?  Also, what happened to this incurable case of headitis he had?"

orioles,3bn5ix,SquishSquash81,0,Tue Jun 30 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"Although, it was not the long ball that killed Arrieta as an Oriole; it was his mid-start meltdowns that left everyone scratching their heads wondering what in the world happened to the guy who was just pitching so well.  Start after start, Jake would show flashes of brilliance and then all of the sudden completely lose command of all of his pitches.  His BB/9 ratio was absolutely atrocious in his time with the O’s – 4.31 (2010); 4.45 (2011); 2.75 (2012); 4.90 (2013).  The frustration and confusion was clear on Arrieta’s face as even he could not figure out what was going wrong.  At one point there were even rumors that Jake had sought out the help of a sports psychologist to try to figure out what was causing his catastrophic meltdowns on the mound.  Jake was a head case.  He had electric stuff, but couldn’t keep it together on the hill. Everyone tried to figure out a solution for Arrieta’s mental lapses, but the only solution was the one thing all Orioles fans feared it would be – a change of scenery.   Oh yea! More anecdotes with zero statistics to back anything up about being a ""head case"". The one stat they quote is walk rate. Not walk rate with runners on. Not walk rate in high pressure situations. Walk rate! I'm flabbergasted. Oh hey, but let's add ""rumors"" to prove our points."

orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,0,Tue Jun 30 17:35:01 2015 UTC,It makes me question if someone really knows a player if they can't even spell their name right.  Like imagine someone coming in saying Wetiers is overrated.
orioles,3bn5ix,BaltimoreBirdGuy,2,Tue Jun 30 18:51:39 2015 UTC,I agree about looking at the pitcher development system a bit but I also think it's gotten much better over the last few years. Gausman was projected as a remote possibility of being an ace but more likely ceiling was number 2 and that seems to be exactly what he is becoming. His floor was back of rotation and he definitely seems to be a lot closer to achieving his projected ceiling than floor. Mike Wright was a nobody before his first year in our minor league system and looks promising now. ERod was a nobody till our minor league system worked with him and then he became a top 100 prospect all of a sudden. Bundy obviously is looking bleak but if you consider he and Gausman our two top pitching prospects then 50% bust and 50% reaching potential should be the best outcome to reasonably expect. The fact that Bundy has only had issues due to health actually makes me think our pitcher development is improving.  Ultimately I think a lot of people have unreasonable expectations of prospects and also have been burned by our shitty pitching development for too long.  Even when we brought up Cabrera and Bedard around the same time people used Cabrera busting as evidence that we couldn't develop pitching even though Bedard became a legit ace. Obviously we had a long run of pitching prospects busting but I'd say things have been looking average to good since Duquette took over.
orioles,3bn5ix,ccritter,2,Tue Jun 30 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had my thoughts about our pitching staff bringing up arms. Considering Wada and Arrieta, they both seem to be doing well and in the case of Arrieta, exceptionally well. Maybe our staff doesn't like to think outside of the box and are set in their ways or maybe the Cubs system pitching system is better? I really don't know, but when you have guys that have the potential and don't pan out, do you keep the blame on the pitchers time and time again?"
orioles,3bn5ix,Louie_Being,2,Tue Jun 30 19:31:01 2015 UTC,good point on the system

orioles,3bn5ix,romorr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:00 2015 UTC,Dunno. They have a thread over there for tracking options if you are curious.  Basically the idea was to unload some of our unoptionable lower-end OFers and use Hoes for depth.

orioles,3bkfwr,AristocratPhoto,8,Mon Jun 29 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"Warning: Opinions Ho!  I remember hearing during the double header that Buck really likes Parmelee's glove at first and that Davis actually enjoys playing right field so it was an easy switch. Davis has looked like he's been having a lot of fun out there too. It may be as simple at that this time.  Young or Lough would be the odd-man out for me. I don't really see the O's going for a flashy trade - it's not really their style. I think we're weakest in the rotation and most weakest at Norris. I would have said this before tonight's shelling as well. my gut tells me last year was an aberration for Bud and he's back to his mean now. Still, the guy won 15 games last year and Buck has long leashes. He probably has until a week or so after the All Star break to turn it around.  Hypothetically Bud doesn't turn it around: Gausman or Wilson. I would like to see them both pitching in some form in the majors this year though. I still think Wright has something, but he needs more polish.   I think the way they've handled Weiters, and the way he's played, shows he's being resigned. Davis' contract? Shit I don't know what to do with him."
orioles,3bkfwr,bishopghost,2,Tue Jun 30 04:05:57 2015 UTC,"Agree with all points. Hope the leesh is a lot shorter on Norris though. It's obvious Gausmen is the next man up, so I wouldnt be surprised to see him move in as #5.  I think Davis depends on how well Parmelee finishes the year and also how much he's going to ask for after the season. I can't imagine us trading either, especially being in the thick of the race here and discussing leading our team RBI leader.  I think Buck loves Weiters and we're prepared to pay the man. He's a pitchers catcher and a coaches player and he's also pretty damn good.   I think we'll try and get Chen back but after the whole AAA assignment he might refuse us at this point."

He also plays a better 1b than parmalee, but the gap between Parms and Chris's rf is much more significant than 1b. We saw Chris play an awesome hot corner at the end of the season when manny went down. Let's not forget he can pitch too! Fact is, Davis is oozing with defensive talent when it comes to versatility.   Imo lough goes. Reimold can play cf and he's hitting. Even with loughs speed, he's not stealing bases and that's a problem. Delmon could be valuable in a pinch situation. He's proven it before, so I feel like that is the one thread holding him on. Mvpearce is too valuable as a plug and play guy regardless of his bat that I want him to have a forever home here with the birds."

Always my go-to if lower level stuff is out of my price range.  Also seconding sections 80-84 for the chance to catch home runs. Watched a game from there about 2 years ago and the crowd and vendors in that area were great fun :)"
orioles,3blaif,suzusarah,2,Tue Jun 30 17:12:44 2015 UTC,Section 80-84 are also great outfield seats for the money. Bonus chance of snagging a HR ball. I'm also bias towards section 66 on the third base side as that's where my seats are.
orioles,3blaif,tootall34,2,Tue Jun 30 10:46:40 2015 UTC,"Okay my favorite are the terrace boxes or lower reserves between the bases, and I just personally prefer first base side (that's where I've got my season tickets. It's also covered if it rains). So that's 19-53. You can get first couple of rows for $36, higher rows for like 19, and should have no problem getting them at the stadium if you don't want to pay convenience fees. You can go to the website and see views from each seat, btw.   The thing is, if you're chill and you go on a weeknight, you should have no problem going and sitting where you want from like the 4th or 5th on. Just don't be a dick and don't draw attention to yourself and you could sit in the lower box seats."
orioles,3blaif,hannahmadamhannah,2,Tue Jun 30 13:37:34 2015 UTC,Sit as close to the Crab Chipper stand as possible. Make reservations for the hospital due to inevitable artery blockage.
orioles,3blaif,seanaber,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:28:15 2015 UTC,Where is this? Also I heard there was a crab pretzel somewhere but have never been able to find it. Any idea where that is?
orioles,3blaif,OsStrohsAndBohs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:47:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the crab pretzel means nothing now that the crab chipper exists. It's somewhere near section 60ish"
orioles,3blaif,seanaber,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:06:10 2015 UTC,"If you can get the 1st or 2nd row seats in a terrace box on the lower deck, they're money. 55,59,61 and 65 all give you coverage in case it rains, a great view of the entire stadium, foul ball territory, and all the best food is hidden on the lower levels. Chesapeake Fries (crab dip on waffle fries) are a must. They'd be at the Freestate Fries kiosk near those sections.  Just make sure to try and get one of the first few rows (lower numbers) in those sections. If you go too far up, you'll still see the field, but you'll start losing the view of the stadium and scoreboard under the awning.  EDIT: Section 65 still has 2 seats in the location I was just mentioning for Thursday's game"
orioles,3blaif,tomkvideo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love the upper deck. Great view of everything and they're the least expensive. Save some money, buy Boog's BBQ.  If anywhere I wouldn't want to sit? Eutaw street bleachers out in right center. There, your back is to all the cool stuff."
orioles,3bk3qq,raven513,19,Mon Jun 29 21:38:47 2015 UTC,Will we ever develop another ace pitcher?  The only one in the 27 years I've been a fan is Mussina. We are cursed.   I have zero hope now of Bundy ever being a star.

orioles,3bk3qq,Woggums83,4,Tue Jun 30 00:13:39 2015 UTC,I do. He's essentially a child still.
orioles,3bk3qq,TheWeebbee,3,Tue Jun 30 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, injuries suck, but hes so young that its foolish to say hes done.  Good/bad thing, we will see next year because he has to be on the Orioles roster.  Start him out in long relief, and go from there."
orioles,3bk3qq,romorr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"My worry is his ability to stay healthy for a whole year. I think he's more likely to turn into a dominant bullpen arm to avoid injuries, but I'm REALLY hoping still he can fully recover from this. It's just not looking good seeing as he's going on a third year lost to one injury."

orioles,3bjszo,buck_naked248,6,Mon Jun 29 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"For those without Insider:    When fellow ESPN Insider writer Dan Szymborski tabbed Manny Machado with the No. 6 pick in ESPN's franchise player draft, no doubt some of you out there raised an eyebrow. Although Machado has shown plus defensive ability since arriving in the major leagues and his offensive upside has been long heralded, he has ""only"" a 104 career OPS+ entering this season, and on the morning of May 31, 2015, he was hitting .261/.327/.433, not exactly the stuff of which stars are made, even 22-year-old ones.  I, for one, was not surprised by Szym's pick. I also participated in that franchise player draft and had slotted Machado into that very same No. 6 slot on my board. The thing is, I might rank him even higher if that exercise were being conducted today. A .375/.420/.644 tear since May 31 can do that. Has Machado reached the next level, and what is his ultimate true talent upside as this wunderkind becomes a man?  Machado was the third pick in the 2010 draft, a Florida high school shortstop who didn't turn 18 until a month after the draft. In all of those aspects, he was comparable to, though not as quite as major league-ready as, Alex Rodriguez, the top pick in 1993. The one attribute of Machado's game you needed to dream and wait on a bit was his power production. He wasn't A-Rod, but he could be looked at as, perhaps, his 15-year-old younger brother, on draft day.  He was consistently one of the youngest players at each minor league level, performing well, but not in nearly as dominant a fashion as a player like A-Rod. He put up a .269-.349-.442 line in 942 minor league plate appearances, hitting only 23 homers overall, 11 apiece in both of his full minor league campaigns. He played all but four of his minor league games at shortstop.  As I've noted in this space before, each season, I compile my own ordered list of top minor league position players prospects based upon OBP and SLG relative to level and adjusted for age. It basically functions as a master follow list, with traditional scouting techniques then used to tweak the order. Machado ranked 16th and 21st in 2011 and 2012, respectively, before any adjustment for defensive value. This too marked him as a future star, one whose brightness would eventually be defined by his ultimate power upside.  And although Machado has been an above-average major leaguer, almost from the first day he set foot in Baltimore, much of that was thanks to his stellar defense, which translated seamlessly to the hot corner. Entering 2015, he was a .278/.313/.434 hitter. Certainly, physical development would bring improvement, but how much?  Let's first take an in-depth look at his 2014 plate-appearance frequency and production by ball-in-play (BIP) data to see where Machado stood entering this season. Bear in mind that last season was cut short by August knee surgery. First, the frequency data. Per usual with my tables, the ""REL"" column stands for ""relative"" and presents his plate-appearance frequencies on a scale, with 100 representing the MLB average. The ""Pct. rank"" column represents this data in percentile-rank form, so, for instance, Machado's K rate in '14 was in the 56th percentile of major league regulars, or higher than 55 percent of his peers.  Machado Frequency Data, 2014 STATISTIC   PCT. OF PAS REL PCT. RANK Strikeout   19.2%   103 56 Walk    5.6%    72  23 Popups  7.3%    91  40 Fly ball    22.8%   80  9 Line drive  22.4%   106 71 Ground ball 47.5%   113 78 This one small table offers plenty of insight into Machado's overall offensive profile entering 2015. Machado's K and BB rates increased from 2013 levels and were very acceptable for such a young player. His popup rate was below league average for the second season in a row, and his liner percentile rank of 71 in 2014 was actually lower than his 91 mark the previous season. Liner rates are more variable than other BIP rates, and few players have a true ability to square up the baseball at a high rate on an ongoing basis. Machado appears to be one of those few. All really good stuff so far.  Then there's that low fly ball rate, including a fly ball percentile rank of 9, which was actually a step up from his 2013 fly ball percentile rank of 5. It's pretty tough to tap into your power upside when you struggle to hit the ball in the air. The kid's fundamentals were very strong, but his ultimate upside would depend on his ability to address this one deficiency.  So let's complete our picture of the pre-2015 Machado by examining his production by BIP-type data for last season, which will give us a better feel for his BIP authority. For the purposes of this exercise, all SH and SF are counted as outs, so his overall seasonal rate stats don't exactly match up. The ""REL Prod."" column compares his actual production on each BIP type to the MLB average of 100. The ""Adj. Prod."" column adjusts that figure for context; it measures how he would have performed if each of his balls in play were hit in a neutral park.  Machado Production, 2014 STATISTIC   AVG OBP SLG REL PROD.   ADJ. PROD. On fly balls    .339    --- .898    159 105 On line drives  .638    --- .897    99  99 On ground balls .276    --- .293    124 105 ALL BIP .346    --- .536    116 99 ALL PA  .275    .316    .426    110 95 OK, so Machado got a bit of help from Camden Yards on fly balls last season, as his actual REL Prod., or contact score, on fly balls dropped from 159 to 105 after adjustment for context. When you get down to it, his authority on all BIP types, after adjustment for context, was squarely in the average range: 105, 99 and 105 on fly balls, liners and grounders, respectively. So what you had, basically, entering 2015, was a strong foundation -- few popups, plenty of liners -- with average BIP authority at the tender age of 21. Physical growth, and an increased fly ball rate, was all that was needed to take Machado to the next level.  Contact Scores, 2013-14 STAT    2013    2014 FLY 73  105 LD  98  99 GB  125 105 ALL 93  99 With K & BB 92  95 In the corresponding table, we show his context-adjusted contact scores for 2013-14, to get a better feel for his BIP authority trends entering this season. This shows some growth in fly ball authority, but the grounder authority backslid a bit, mostly because of a higher number of topped, rollover (pulled) grounders in 2014. But for a 21-year-old to have above-average fly ball authority, and a positive trend, is a very good thing. Now he just has to hit more of them.  That brings us to 2015, and there have been some big, positive fundamental changes. You want more fly balls? His fly ball rate percentile rank is in the upper 60s, way above his single-digit marks of 2013 and '14. I'd expect some regression there, but the progress is very real. You want harder fly ball authority? Well, if you assume his liner and grounder contact scores have held constant, then his fly ball contact score is in the 200 range. That's the neighborhood that Jose Bautista, Miguel Cabrera and Andrew McCutchen live in. And that's without anything resembling an overt pull tendency.  Just as importantly, his K and BB rates have improved. A strong relationship exists between players' unadjusted contact scores and OPS+, based on their K and BB rates. In 2014, Machado's K rate was in the average range and his BB rate was more than a half standard deviation below league average. Going back to 1901, such players had an average contact score multiplier of .956 (i.e., their contact score times .956 would approximate their OPS+).  In 2015, his K rate is more than a half standard deviation below league average and his BB rate has risen into the average range. Again going back to 1901, such players have a contact score multiplier of 1.072. That's a big jump, simply by pushing the K and BB rates in the correct direction. In other words, Manny Machado is 22, and he's already displaying plate discipline wisdom beyond his years.  One last, and fairly stark, way to chart Machado's future is to identify some player comps. I searched for the most comparable players in terms of: cumulative number of standard deviations above/below league average in OBP and SLG, and a similar OBP/SLG profile (below average in the former, above in the latter as 21-year-olds with two years as MLB regulars). And the four closest comps were ... some guys named Hank Aaron, Miguel Cabrera, Ron Santo and Adrian Beltre.  Comparing Machado To Greats PLAYER  YEARS 1-2   YEAR 3 Aaron   125 151 Cabrera 121 151 Santo   113 74 Beltre  108 91 Machado 105 140 There are more similarities than you might think among that group. Santo and Beltre qualify as exceptional defensive third-sackers, like Machado, but Cabrera came up as a third baseman, and even Aaron was exclusively an infielder -- at second base -- in his last full minor league season. In the corresponding table, you'll see their OPS+ rates in their age 20-21 seasons, as well as their age-22 campaign:  Aaron and Cabrera were better than Machado in their age 20 and 21 seasons, but took Machado-style leaps forward at age 22. Beltre and Santo's ascent to the next level didn't happen until later in their careers.  Manny Machado = Miguel Cabrera Jr.? AP Photo/Carlos Osorio I would venture that all five of these guys will eventually be in the Hall of Fame. Beltre's candidacy likely will be hotly debated, and Machado obviously has many chapters to write in the book of his career. I wouldn't expect him to approach the offensive exploits of Aaron and Cabrera, but he'll likely exceed those of Santo and Beltre while bringing as much or more cumulative defensive value to the table.  Folks, that's a pretty special player who is taking it to the next level as we speak. Consider yourself forewarned."

orioles,3bipj7,MajorSuccess,5,Tue Jun 30 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"Andy MacPhail orchestrated much of the playoff run that happened the year after he left. He pulled off the Erik Bedard heist that got Chris Tillman and superstar Adam Jones, along with trade bait that led to Steve Johnson and Mark Reynolds. He got JJ Hardy for lunch money.  He was hit or miss in drafts, with first round picks Brian Matusz (projected starter fallen to iffy LOOGY), mistake Matthew Hobgood (in a draft that included Storen, Shelby Miller, Mike Trout), Bronze Jesus Manny Machado and Dylan Bundy. Jury's out on Bundy, but he has a high ceiling.  He wasn't actually fired. His contract came up and he had some family medical issues. I don't speak for all, but I'm happy he's back in the game.  Bonus: The MacPhail name has a bunch of baseball legacy to it."
orioles,3bipj7,aresef,2,Mon Jun 29 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"Jury's out on Bundy, but he has a high ceiling   His injury and subsequent TJ surgery (and subsequent recovery, etc), as unfortunate as they are, cannot be scouted.  He was progressing as expected until that happened, so you can't fault the scouts or suggest it was a ""bust"" of a draft pick... it's just one of those things.  Hopefully he's able to fully regain his form and become a regular with the big club, but even if that doesn't happen you can't really blame that on anyone. Just my 2¢."
orioles,3bipj7,PaintDrinkingPete,2,Mon Jun 29 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"Right, all I'm saying is we haven't seen the return on him yet. He got hurt again a few weeks ago. Since we called him up to toss a couple innings in 2012 last year, however, one way or another he's gonna have to be up here next year because he'll be out of options. I'm just not writing him off as a bust like Hobgood, though, because we know what he can do. Shit just, well, happened.  Hobgood though. Jesus fuck. Least he's not Billy Rowell."
orioles,3bipj7,aresef,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"He was hit or miss in drafts,   Wow.  He couldn't draft players that all became Major League superstars?  Well then, I guess he sucks.  And Trout was the 25th overall pick, not picking him isn't an indictment on anyone.  Hobgood wasn't a reach where he was picked it's the reality of drafting, not all players work out.  The fact he got what's considered 2 near superstar but definitely above-average MLB players for you guys in that short time period says a lot more than missing out on Trout."
orioles,3bipj7,TheSubversive,5,Tue Jun 30 12:25:24 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with most people in this thread. I think they're looking back with rose colored glasses. Yes, MacPhail got a lot of the pieces for our recent success but we would never be winning if he was still running the show.   Yes he got us Jones, Tillman, Davis and Hunter but if you look at all the contributors to our success MacPhail would never have signed them or given them a chance. Mclouth, Ford, Pearce, Paredes, Parmalee, guys like that with low risk and high upside were never signed or given a chance.   He would put together a team of 25 and that was it. If anyone got hurt or didn't perform we were sool because there was no depth. Go back and look and some of the teams he put together, some of those guys shouldn't have even been in the majors but would stick around all year because there were no other options. Like Matusz when he had a 10+ ERA and kept getting starts or Millwood and his 4-16 record or Daniel Cabrerra's career.   Maybe he's learned the importance of depth by now but there is no way we would have had the success we've had if he was running things. Like last week, sending Chen to single A and promoting Parmalee so he's not lost. That's a Duquette move not a Macphail move."
orioles,3bipj7,seekadviceelsewhere,2,Mon Jun 29 22:48:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We had sooo many bad players getting tons of PT on MacPhail's teams. Cesar Izturis, Julio Lugo, Jason Berken, Felix Pie, Guillermo Quiroz, Danys Báez, etc. Freaking Luke Scott leading the team in HRs. A fair share of failed draft picks. Stuff that would be absolutely unacceptable to Duquette and Showalter."
orioles,3bipj7,hattmarrington,0,Tue Jun 30 14:45:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah...Duquette is awesome.  I mean, he brought in Nelson Cruz!!!  What an awesome move.  Say, how's he doing for you guys this year?"
orioles,3bipj7,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"You blame Duquette for not bringing Cruz back? It was a masterful signing last year and if anyone's to blame for him leaving, it's him for performing so well and Angelos for not spending the money. Not to mention Baltimore is 5th in total runs this season... and Seattle is dead last."

A masterful signing gives you a great player for many years at below market value."
orioles,3bipj7,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:30:17 2015 UTC,I still think he was a steal then and although it was a pain to see him go may have been in the best interest of the ball club. That or Duquette had his hands tied with the Blue Jays thing lol :/
orioles,3bipj7,BigOlRig,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"It was a steal but it was short term.  It would have been masterful if there was a team option or it was multi year, something that kept him an Oriole.  And I've got no problem with Duqette but it's fucked when some of your fans say MacPhail didn't do anything and I look at your team and it's core is entirely built by the guy.  It's that core that's winning games and making the team what it is.  I do think Duquette has not done a good job at getting the team the pieces at the deadline it needs to make a strong postseason run.  Bud Norris and Scott Feldman aren't the difference makers you need to get at the deadline; good pickups - yeah but not World Championship acquisitions.  He's over-valued what's in your system to the point where he's passed on some decent mid-season trades....and I think he under-valued Strop and Arrieta.  We had to trade Michael Bourne in 2007 to get Brad Lidge.  You think we wanted to do that?  No, we had to in order to get a piece we needed to put us over the hump.  Sure we lost out on a great CF'er for 5 cheap years but we won the big ring and no one in Philly laments that move."
orioles,3bipj7,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"I feel ya and I definitely agree. Definitely when it is hard to keep bigger caliber players around when money is involved! Duqette has done a lot with the current pieces we have going. I like him a lot, but no one can truly deny that big McP set us up for the future while having free agency issues is really an awesome table-setter for future years. I am looking forward to seeing the Phils competitive again :)"
orioles,3bipj7,BigOlRig,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"Yes he got us Jones, Tillman, Davis and Hunter but   LOL.  And Hardy and Weiters and Machado and Showalter, who he had to convince to come out of retirement.  Yeah, he really didn't do a good job for you guys...All he did was get you every major piece you have that makes you competitive.  What a loser.  And how dare he not pick with 100% accuracy players that would perform or even over-perform like McClouth and Pearce.  You should be a Phillies fan.  They all think that every single move should be absolutely flawless too."
orioles,3bipj7,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:19:09 2015 UTC,"That is your takeaway from what I wrote? I'm just offering valid criticism while everyone else fellates him for the Bedard trade. I gave him credit for getting some very good players and especially Showalter. The Showalter thing wasn't that popular at the time as people thought he would clash with Angelos or be too gruff with the players. That was far and away his best move.   My point was he would surround Jones, Markakis, Weiters etc with guys like Millar, Vlad, and Derek Lee and no backup plans if those guys got hurt or underperformed.   Did we catch lightning in a bottle with McClouth and Pearce? Yeah, but look at all the guys Duquette stockpiled and Buck gave opportunities to. We started with Riemold and Endy Chavez as the 4th outfielder. Pearce, Avery, Hoes, Hall, Tolleson, and Ford all got a chance to play and perform and take that job.  Also, ftr Weiters was drafted before Macphail got here. His first rounders are Matusz, Hobgood, Bundy and Machado. That is a pretty piss poor return on 4 top 5 picks. And there is a reason we were drafting in the top 5 every year.   In fact his whole philosophy on the draft was ass backwards. He wanted to 'grow the arms and buy the bats'. Statistically, good college hitters are the most likely to make the majors with high school pitchers the least likely. A ton of high draft picks were burned on guys with little chance to make the majors while we were also spending money on over the hill batters. Givens last week was the first pick from 2009 to make the majors and he was a converted shortstop.   I wish him the best and hope he turns the Phillies around but I'm expecting more of the same things he did in Baltimore."
orioles,3bipj7,seekadviceelsewhere,4,Tue Jun 30 22:24:24 2015 UTC,There were a lot of things that needed to fall into place for the O's to  go from a perennial loser (14 straight sub .500 seasons) to a playoff contender that they are right now.  A lot of those pieces were put in place by MacPhail.

orioles,3bipj7,lanboyo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"How much of your success is really due to him   This gets heavily debated here. I give him 50% credit. He had a very strict ""grow the arms, buy the bats"" philosophy very much in the mold of Tampa Bay. But the Orioles have had a lot of difficulty in developing their own pitchers. The best pitcher drafted and developed in house was Jake Arietta, and he didn't find success until he left town.   Starting pitching aside, MacPhail found competitive players for everything else. He personally destroyed Seattle for a generation with his savage Bedard trade. I don't know if he can take you guys all the way but he'll definitely build a lasting winner"

And such an obvious position switch with Parm playing 1B and Crush in RF for BOTH games raised a red flag, like a team is interested in parm or crush but wants to know if Parm can play First or Crush can play RF before they make a trade. Usually you don't play ppl out of position for both games of a doubleheader"
orioles,3bifvr,PrimeImplicant,6,Mon Jun 29 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"Parm is a first baseman, but he was just playing in the outfield some in AAA b/c Christian Walker was at first. You might be looking a little too much into this."

Maybe Parmelee is more comfortable at 1B than RF and Davis doesn't mind the OF. Or maybe Buck is just trying to figure out what he has.  What Davis does have over Delmon and Reimold 100% of the time is that left handed bat. And in the AL East with a ton of right handers, the more lefties, the better."
