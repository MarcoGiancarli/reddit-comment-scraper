The owner was the original owner and had a life time warranty on the vehicle. Got a brand new exhaust almost for free.

Toyota,3e2gub,UnstableFlux,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:56 2015 UTC,"Those parts are over a decade old if they are original, so they should probably be replaced anyway. However, the smell test to check struts is to park the car on a level surface, set the parking brake, put it in park and shut it off. Get anything abnormally heavy out of the car, but it doesn't need to be immaculate. Then, go to each corner of the car, place your hands wide on a stiff part of the body like an upper fender crease, and using your entire body weight ,push  down sharply on that corner. Don't push on a flat body panel, it might bend or dent. Good struts will only let the car bounce once, if the struts are shot, the car will just keep bouncing 3 or 4 times. This is not going to diagnose all defects possible, but is an easy way to tell how worn they are. Again, if it were my car, I would replace them anyway. They're pretty old, and the whole point of struts is to help keep your tires in contact with the road surface."

Toyota,3e2gub,finally_joined,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:48 2015 UTC,"I believe you can buy a uni-strut, which has the shock, spring, mounting flanges etc, all as one unit.  In my experience, that is cheaper than just doing the shocks because of the extra labor to just replace the shocks because you have to deal with removing them from that same assembly anyway.    That is what I did on my camry."
Toyota,3e2gub,finally_joined,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:48 2015 UTC,Did you replace them yourself or have a shop do it?
Toyota,3e2gub,finally_joined,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"I had a shop do it.  I bought the parts from Rock Auto.  I have a connection at a shop, so they didn't mind me bringing my own parts.  Not always possible though.    The thing with not buying the whole assembly, is that you need to compress the coil spring to get it apart.  Then replace the shock and compress the spring again to assemble it.  That takes time and a tool / machine, which adds to the cost, and is sorta dangerous.  I think shops prefer to replace the whole assembly so they don't have to deal with that part of it."
Toyota,3e1vl6,Shiftngo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:00:41 2015 UTC,"Since all MR2s are long discontinued, your chances of finding a new rack are slim. You might find one used if it were ever made. If this were my car, I would proceed in one of two ways- get someone handy ( or diy) to design and build a cargo rack to go over the engine bay, or get a custom trailer hitch made and get one of those cargo baskets. If you have the time, money and energy, see if you can get a rear half of an identical MR2, and convert that to a cargo trailer. You have a unique problem and need an equally unique solution."

Then when you put your brand new key in your 19 year old door locks and ignition, they probably will have difficulty turning because the whole time the key was becoming worn, so were the tumblers inside the locks. You definitely want to talk to an experienced locksmith, and have them regrind new keys from the one you have been using."
Toyota,3dw1yv,ET2-SW,2,Mon Jul 20 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"I make lexus keys every day off original codes. Even for the 90-92 original models. Sometimes the new key has trouble, but most of the time it's okay. If there is difficulty, it sometimes helps to smooth out the edges of the key a bit with a wire brush. I do know a toyota key is a little bit different style, but the concept is the same. Since you have the code, you should also be able to get a key pretty cheap from a locksmith."
Toyota,3dw1yv,kshadhavar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"This is anecdotal of course, but I recently had some new keys made for my 92 Land Cruiser cut from the VIN number. The old keys were severely worn and the locks were quite difficult to turn over. The new master worked perfectly. My local dealership even cut the blank I provided at no charge. The cost is inconsequential, so I say OP should at least give it a try. If he doesn't like the results, he should definitely take your advice."

Toyota,3dw1yv,cbullins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:10 2015 UTC,For a 2015 Corolla S it's a very different story. Old school cars with no chip or fob the key cost is about $2 and a quick cut on a machine they have on hand.   The new Corolla has a chip that needs programmed to the vehicle and possibly a laser cut key that usually needs ordered from the factory as most dealers don't have laser cutting machines yet.

Computer is looking for a clean throttle body & it sees a gummed up one. Takes a while for it to compensate. Like driving it for a few days. Or you can disconnect the air intake tube & cleaning the thottle & plate with some brake clean. Should make it idle correctly again.

Toyota,3djzkp,AppleTurnovers,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"For daily driving, put it in D. It will be the best mode for optimum gas mileage and will be a smoother drive. The S stands for ""Sport"" - at least I'm assuming so (that's what most auto manufacturers call it), that's why it locks it down to 4 gears so you have more power through each gear. Use S for when you feel like driving like Ricky Bobby (because racecar) or if you're driving up steep hills/mountains where you need better power."
Toyota,3djvii,chipsnsalsa13,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"3 - hybrids have extra weight and generally run fuel efficient tires which are less comfortable and have higher-than-typical recommended running pressures. The stiffer the tire the better the fuel efficiency, but it means a bumpier ride. It's also possible the suspension is stiffer to compensate for the battery, which again would contribute to a bumpier ride. You could also just be used to the old Camry's worn suspension. The old ones handled like boats. (I had a '99)  4 - hybrids have two braking systems. If you stop too quickly you will feel the transition to the friction (""regular"") brakes. The other braking system allows the hybrid system to capture energy while you're slowing down but doesn't offer good braking control in emergency situations or low speeds."
Toyota,3djvii,shihchiun,2,Thu Jul 16 23:02:20 2015 UTC,Thanks. I didn't know about the tires. We might look into that. My boyfriend has tried to explain the braking system to me but you explained it simpler and I think I'm starting to get the picture. I honestly could learn to adjust to most of this stuff.

Toyota,3d9q8e,Suirez,9,Tue Jul 14 16:31:22 2015 UTC,Get a can of battery terminal cleaner from an auto parts store or just use baking soda. Any shop can do a battery service for you if you choose not to do it yourself.
Toyota,3d9q8e,tyguyS4,10,Tue Jul 14 16:44:03 2015 UTC,No get that off it will eventually  damage your battery...  disconnect the terminals and pour coke cola on it let it sit for a oil bit

Toyota,3d9q8e,bruddahmacnut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:50:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I would only use coke for emergencies. A degreaser or battery cleaner solution will clean the battery just fine. I would recommend getting the battery and terminals inspected, you may need to replace them."
Toyota,3d9q8e,MaxD33,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:48:22 2015 UTC,I've always used warm water.
Toyota,3d9q8e,Custard1506,4,Wed Jul 15 07:49:57 2015 UTC,just use baking soda and water and scrub it off and rinse. It is just corrosion and will eventually slowly drain your battery by making a short in between the poles.
Toyota,3d9q8e,inb4op,3,Tue Jul 14 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"So the battery is fine and doesn't require replacement? I'm concerned as to why the center retaining bar is corroding as well. Also,  what might be the  cause of something like this?"
Toyota,3d9q8e,CodiP,10,Tue Jul 14 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"Corrosion builds up on battery terminals and the hold down bar over time as it ages. Don't want to get too technical about it but it's just a chemical process that you can read more about if interested with a simple google search. Anyways just take clamps off battery and clean it all with a mixture of baking soda and warm water. I normally submerge the clamp in a container of it and scrub away and use a brush to get everything else, rinse with water. If your battery starts your car fine summer and winter then save your money and don't replace it. Can always get it tested at a shop to get the actual cranking amps it is outputting. There is also battery cleaning sprays you can buy but IMO nothing beats baking soda and water."
Toyota,3d9q8e,GeckoDeLimon,5,Tue Jul 14 17:07:48 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I was pretty concerned but now I have a good approach
Toyota,3d9q8e,trippinholyman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"I would recommend removing the battery from the car while you're doing your cleanup work. It's the only way you'll get the tie down bracket clean.  Remember, the ground lead should always be removed first and put on last."

Located in a southern state, just last week I was able to order a few dashboards for Camry, solara, and Avalon (sienna and 4runner aren't ready yet). They take about two weeks to come in. If your dealership says they can't order them, call around to a few more dealerships in your area. Warranty pays well but these aren't paying as well as others, thus prompting the service managers to hold off. They do take about 4 hours to complete. And keep in mind they are a pain to get in stock! Just keep calling and be patient with your dealer. Hope it goes smoothly for you! Those sticky/melting dashes are dangerous. AND just to note, Chevy has the same dash problem...they are not addressing it or fixing it. VIVA LA TOYOTA!"

Toyota,3d2iph,Alabaster13,13,Mon Jul 13 00:24:46 2015 UTC,Full tank will take you 600 miles in a prius.   So it breaks down like this 10000/17=588 so 588 gallons a year used in the 4runner 588(2.90)= 1705 so $1705 a year on gas. As for the prius 10000/50= 200.  200(2.9)= $580 so then 1705 - 580= $1125. So you save that much by switching to a prius. Just to take it a little farther 580/1705=0.34 and 100-34= 66 so you get a %66 savings on gas.  Edit: also the 5 yr cost on maintenance for the 4runner is $4132 while the prius is $3225 so you save another $907 there.   That all being said... driving a 4runner...priceless.
Toyota,3d2iph,D-Rictus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"Great info! You also mentioned 5 year maintenance. Where did you get those figures from?  I was considering waiting for a Tesla Model 3, but starting price will be $35k....forget that.   I bought the 4Runner last year, it has great resale so I shouldn't lose much after a year. Why did I buy it?  I guess it's a mistake I'm paying for now after always wanting a bigger suv.   Another concern is the depreciation of Prius after the EV's really start taking over.   Options: do I stick with the Prius Two or go with the solar roof, Nav and Softex seats....I noticed Prius has hubcaps. How reliable are they?  I never had a vehicle with hubcaps on them.   Your figures show 50mpg, but that will dip to 36-40mpg in the winter wouldn't it?"
Toyota,3d2iph,D-Rictus,3,Mon Jul 13 01:27:22 2015 UTC,I pulled that information directly from Edmunds.com they are usually pretty reliable. As for springing for the extra goodies that's up to you I personally feel like if I'm getting a prius I'm doing it for the economic reasons not for flash I would probably only bump up to the package 3 and get the Navi cause it has some features with it that I like. And don't get the solar sunroof it's a joke. As for the wheels the prius actually has black alloy wheels on it the hubcaps are only there believe it or not to reduce drag for efficiency you can take them off though and it won't change things much honestly and I feel like they look a lot better without the caps on anyways. And no the winter should never affect the gas mileage that bad if it does then it's defective. At most you might dip to 45 and that's if you are trying lol. I drive my girlfriends prius c sometimes and i drive like a bat outta hell and I usually average 47 overall and that's with me stomping on it.
Toyota,3d2iph,D-Rictus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"Really? Can I see pics of yours without the hubcaps on?  I never knew that. Thanks!    I don't really need the Nav since my iPhone is always used for that. Cloth seats are not favorable, but Softex seats aren't great either."
Toyota,3d2iph,D-Rictus,2,Mon Jul 13 02:01:45 2015 UTC,The prius c like she drives has steel wheels since it's not as weight sensitive the standard prius has the alloys. And if you don't like either option get the package 2 and have the dealer put leather in it shouldn't cost you more than $1500 depending on where you live.

Still 26 years old, but it has all of its original bells and whistles.  However, every so often, I end up driving my parents' Prius. That car is... so... different. For one thing, throttle control and braking are completely drive-by-wire (computer controlled rather than a cable to the throttle body or brake master cylinder from the pedals), and the power steering is (I think) electric assist, so steering takes almost no effort. Basically, the prius (gen II and up) is completely different to drive than most older cars.   On the topic of fun new gadgets, the stereo system is probably the best of the bunch. It's designed for very different music than older cars. Lots of bass, if you set the equalizer right.  I'm not sure how much the voice recognition software has improved in the new prius, but if you're going to tell a GPS where to go, stick to shouting ""OK GOOGLE"" in the general direction of your phone or however you activate siri."

Toyota,3cp6e0,Krabsmoney,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:50:11 2015 UTC,I highly doubt the sequoia or tundra will get one. GM tried it and it failed miserably.

Toyota,3cnb3s,RParasi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"The Prius C feels exactly like the economy car that it is. Hollow-sounding doors, loud highway driving, etc.  Financially, the used car is actually somewhat more expensive if you look at it from a total useful life perspective. Figure you can get 10 good years out of a car - that gives you $1800/year on the C. The standard Prius will be anywhere from $2100-2500/year depending on purchase price (only 7 useful years, because it's already 3 years old). Difference in maintenance would be negligible over that amount of time. All the big stuff you'd end up doing no matter what (suspension mainly)."
Toyota,3cnb3s,shihchiun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:39:33 2015 UTC,"I would get an 09-12 Prius. They are much better cars and are about 5 grand cheaper. With 60-70k miles they are hardly broken in. You can get a one owner Prius for 15k and it'll last you 10 years under normal driving conditions. I just don't see the point in the Prius C when you only get a few mpg extra, but lose a TON of space and comfort.  Go to a reputable dealer and drive both. If you absolutely think the C is right for you then go ahead with it. I think you'll like the normal Prius much better, though."

Toyota,3cmjx2,Ashinjuka,2,Thu Jul 9 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"The Pontiac Vibe is basically the same as the Matrix, but they are usually a little cheaper.   I am the king of high buying high mileage Toyota's. My current truck had 193,000 on it when I bought it and now has close to 220,000 and still no major issues beyond needing a set of tires and a tune up. I have bought several with far more miles than the one I currently have and I still have yet to send one to the scrapyard. 400,000 miles on an original drivetrain is pretty common for a car that has been maintained. I would just shop for a car that has been maintained and not worry too much about the mileage. If you can find a private party that has the maintenance records, I would go that route vs buying off a lot. It's probably worth paying a trusted mechanic to look it over if you aren't mechanically inclined and an honest seller won't bat an eye at that. Even if a problem is discovered, you could still negotiate a fair deal that would allow for you to get the problem resolved. Toyota's are really about the only manufacture I would say that about with the only other one being Honda. Both are just excellent vehicles, especially if you are on a tight budget and just need reliable transportation.   The only thing that kills Toyota's is poor maintenance and RUST. If you live in the rust belt, be sure to check underneath for signs of serious rust."

Other than gas, oil every 5000 miles, and transmission fluid changes every 60,000 miles, my only major repair was the head gasket which cost less than $300 by a Toyota dealer to fix.  Everything else has been wear items like brakes, tires, spark plugs, air filters, etc.  The ECM was replaced for free by Toyota under a recall.  It has crank windows and only the most basic of options so there is little to break.  Today it has almost 160,000 miles on it, and it just keeps going. I have no doubt it will hit the goofy odometer limit of 299,999km and won't stop there.  It is finally starting to show some body rust on the front edge of the roof, but it's a 10 year old car that is driven throughout the harsh winters, so that's excellent.  I can't say enough good things about this car.  I would buy another Toyota in a heartbeat.

After 2 repair attempts they are required to open a TAS case, a kind of hotline who help techs that can't figure problems out.  I've diagnosed a lot of these, and I can tell you from my experience that 6/10 times its operator error or environmental.  2/10 because the battery was killed on the lot before it was sold because storage procedures were not followed.

Toyota,3c20ci,STS-135,2,Sat Jul 4 03:56:31 2015 UTC,There is a fuse diagram on the underside of the fuse box lids. There are two fuse boxes in your car; one in the engine bay on the driver's side just behind the battery and another under/behind the dashboard just inside the driver's door.

I have a 1986 2wd 22r pickup and it had the original engine, that my dad just rebuilt after 120k. It has towed a couple of cars and has gone from SoCal to Seattle towing said cars. Other than a couple of suspension mods (air shocks and leaf spring helpers) and cosmetic stuff (wheels, hitch, and bumpers), it is completely stock as far as the engine goes.    Mine sounds like a little Japanese tank rolling down the road and I love it. As long as you wait for them to warm up, keep on feeding them oil, and just do regular maintenance they will last."

Toyota,3blk2s,tunersharkbitten,3,Tue Jun 30 05:11:35 2015 UTC,"damn dude,   thats a friggin steal right there.   i have worked on a couple of that generation and the repairs arent TOO bad."
Toyota,3blk2s,-RdV-,5,Tue Jun 30 06:15:00 2015 UTC,"I thought so to. a little background. when my buddy picked up a 04 Wrangler,she didn't like the fact he had a newer car then she did. so she bought a 2013ish Subrau. so the celica was parked for a while,and I knew form previous experience with this car the belt tensioner tension bolt was rounded off.   I was bitching to my body how I needed to replace my VW,he said well ex still has the celica for sale. 600 was the price I threw out there."
Toyota,3blk2s,-RdV-,3,Tue Jun 30 10:51:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, great price! Does this have the 2zz?"
Toyota,3blk2s,MisterChao,3,Tue Jun 30 05:36:00 2015 UTC,yup. my understanding the GTS has the 2ZZ. (and the main reason why my first round of buying parts for it backfired)   down side it's not mated with the 6 Speed manual. it's mated with a 4 speed semi auto set up.
Toyota,3blk2s,Weissmanneitor,4,Tue Jun 30 10:53:07 2015 UTC,I'd have paid that for a good 2zz with loom/ecu etc.  Still a good buy imo. The transmission can always be swapped.
Toyota,3blk2s,Litonja,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:33:42 2015 UTC,Isn't the auto in a gts a 5 speed?
Toyota,3blk2s,keeb119,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:59:55 2015 UTC,nope 4 speed. it has a 1-4 setting in drive. then a 2/L setting.
Toyota,3blk2s,dirtisbad,2,Wed Jul 1 01:14:49 2015 UTC,That's some crazy price! Car dealers here usually re-sell a car that old and looking like that here in Costa Rica for about $8000 or even more. I hate the idiots who populate my country :(

Toyota,3bj507,CivilTechYYC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:04:25 2015 UTC,I ordered from Autopartway and got a Go Rhino product for my Rav. Try looking there. Came to $350 with shipping to Alberta. Install was pretty easy overall. Sometimes you can find a decent deal on Amazon as well.   http://www.gorhino.com/RC2-LR http://www.gorhino.com/Bumper-Replacements
Toyota,3bj08x,papersailboat,4,Mon Jun 29 16:54:13 2015 UTC,"Check the ground where you park your car for the next month or so, most of the undercoat material they use will harden to a really solid texture however some of the more intricate nooks and crannies require a very slow curing rubber material which may fall off and stain your driveway/parking area.  If you want to stick with the recommended service intervals prepare to be slammed in the butt HARD. All the new cars use high quality synthetic oil so I would do first oil change at 5000 miles, second at 10000miles, then from there I would just check my oil each time I fuel up and just note the color changing from a lovely honey gold to darker.  Checking your engine air filter is easy, literally 2 small clips. Take it out, look at the bottom, is it worth $30 to replace it? Probably not. They recommend at 12000miles but the chances of it being dirty or clogged then in almost nil.  These cars are built to last. Good luck."
Toyota,3bj08x,dabu222,2,Tue Jun 30 02:25:08 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Toyota,3bj08x,badmana,2,Tue Jun 30 21:00:17 2015 UTC,I'd actually check with Toyota on the cost of the oil change. Around here (in Ontario at least) Toyota has made the price of the 0W20 oil change very reasonable at $65 (tax in).   That's only about $20 over the cost of the parts and they do it in 20 minutes or less.   They will try to sell you everything from new tires to blinker fluid but just say no thanks.
Toyota,3bj08x,dienah13,2,Wed Jul 1 13:07:17 2015 UTC,"I've got the 2014 Corolla S, I'm not 100% sure what the differences are in terms of technology. I'm assuming the exterior of the car is the same?  Here's small little things in my one year of driving my Corolla:   The undercoat I'm not too sure on, since I got mine done outside of a Toyota dealer. There will be random times where my Bluetooth to my music would disconnect while driving, or just not connect. Ever since I bought a new phone, it stopped doing that. The display button on the steering wheel, play around with it. I personally keep the amount of remaining KM's I have. It's nice to know how far of a limit I can push. The backup camera is awesome. I own a white Corolla. With that, I've gone through 2 touch up pens. Don't push the Corolla too hard when accelerating. It's a nice looking car, but at the end of the day it's no Ferrari. As told by my sales person during delivery, 6 bodies can fit in the trunk. I got a little creeped out, and asked him how he knew that. He said he just did. Welp. I regret not tinting my windows. You can see right through the car.   If I think of anything I'll come add more to the list!"
Toyota,3bj08x,de_mint,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:49:54 2015 UTC,Hey thanks very much! Good to hear that it has been working well for you!
Toyota,3bj08x,kampalah,2,Tue Jun 30 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"Undercoating is nice but not necessary. Don't worry about it if you purchased it. It's not snake oil and does protect your under carriage a bit.  The 0w-20 Synthetic oil is good for 7.5 to 10k miles. My local dealership uses mobile1and a high quality filter. The intake and cabin filters are cheap and will last up to 25k miles. Just pop it out and clean it every 10k and save. It's simple, no tools required.   Read your maintenance booklet on what you need to do at specific mileage. Follow that like it's a NASA instruction manual teaching you to build a rocket ship. You won't need everything done at the specified mile. But don't just write things off, that booklet will help your car last more than 250k miles.  Also make sure to fill that out if you decide to resell your car people will want documentation of it's service."

Toyota,3bhilk,Anon_Omis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:07:50 2015 UTC,"Ok that's a little different then American corollas but here's what I'm seeing, leave the vents alone that's not where it's going to be attached, the black bezel around the stereo should come off behind it there should be four screws to the left/right holding the headunit into the dash, remove these screws  then remove the brackets from the stereo you'll need these to put the new one in, then it's as simple as pluging up the right harness or cut/splicing and heat shrinking the new harness to the cars existing harness."
Toyota,3bhilk,Goingdef,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:42:09 2015 UTC,"Okay so that black part around it should be removed. It's just not coming off easily and I don't want to force it.  I'll be trying again today, thanks for your reply"
Toyota,3bhilk,Goingdef,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:33:33 2015 UTC,"That's the only thing I can figure my dash looks different but the idea is the same you pop off the whole surrounding piece on mine which includes the clock and center vents, but any aftermarket head unit is going to mount either with a cage or the factory brackets and so far it's always been cages on American made cars and mounting brackets on foreign cars, so that would put the screws behind that trim ring.  After searching the web I can't even find a picture of a Corolla like yours, what model is it exactly?"
Toyota,3bhilk,Goingdef,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:37:35 2015 UTC,Here's a link to a pic of my car http://imgur.com/fP8VTdV  I'm pretty sure the official term is AE112 1998 Corolla It's got the circular headlights. Most of the ones I see out and about have different headlight but the same body.

Toyota,3bfh15,lemonchickentellya,2,Sun Jun 28 19:27:02 2015 UTC,I would try the late 90s dodge dakota. It is a really bulky bench seat that is 60/40 and you also have a pull down arm rest. I flipped one and thought it would've been perfect for my tacoma (IF I HAD ONE!) but I had sold it to get the wife a minivan. :\
Toyota,3bfh15,enternets,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"where are you located? I've got a 98 with bench seats and would consider trading you for the buckets, depending on condition and proximity. If you are taking seats from something else, expect to do a little work adapting the sliders and brackets, but it shouldn't be too bad. Just make sure it all ends up solid."

Toyota,3bcl22,ibang12,2,Sat Jun 27 23:00:08 2015 UTC,"I have a similar one for my 06 Matrix, a Grom USB2.  It connects to the CD changer port.  Does your JBL have one?  You can run the wires through the dashboard and into the glove box when you have the dashboard pulled apart.  You'll need to figure out where you want to keep the connected audio device and try to run wires to suit.  I have problems with my Grom unit from time to time.  It basically fools the head unit into thinking you have a 99 CD changer with CDs that can hold 99 songs.  But this deception doesn't always work, and my factory head unit will end up freezing or doesn't see the connection anymore.  Then I have to pull a fuse to reset.  It's still worth it, though, since I don't have a CD changer."
Toyota,3bcl22,coreynolds,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:44:16 2015 UTC,I didn't even think of the glove box. I'll have to remember the fuse trick in case my aux cord starts acting up. Thank you for your help!

Toyota,3b4x60,Narissis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:56:09 2015 UTC,"Mine had several issues, the latest being a steering column knocking sound that they want 1.5k to repair. So I said fuck it, paid off the remaining 2k of balance due on the loan, and went straight to Subaru for a test drive.   I don't mean to rant, but from about 6 months after driving off the Toyota lot, that car had problem after problem. I fixed a lot of it myself cause I'm good with technical stuff and have friends with car related skills, but damn if I ever so much as hear about anything Toyota now, it makes me gag thinking of how craptacular that matrix was.   80,000 is at the point where my windshield wiper assembly failed. They wanted 300 for the part, 200 labour. I opened up the plastic covering the assembly and found a single plastic cap had broken. I called and asked for the part. They of course don't sell them. Have to buy the whole damn assembly. Well fuck you Toyota I fixed your shit with a $1 hook that I already had laying in my random crap drawer http://i.imgur.com/zKfBrvF.jpg  Sorry I'm kind of bitter toward them now.

Toyota,3b4x60,Narissis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:30:30 2015 UTC,"After much research and thought I've somewhat concluded that Toyota as a brand generally relies on purchases by people who are less informed. I can't even believe that variable wipers is considered an upgrade option.  My matrix has a ""sport"" mode with the shifter where I can select the gear I want, but it's more of a limiter in the sense that even if I set it to 1, at a full stop, it will still pick which ever gear it wants. I set it to 1, then switch it back to normal drive, and back again and it will say 3 or someshit. It's a total joke.   I ordered the touring package for the impreza I'm picking up. Didn't care much for the sun roof, larger wheels, or fog lights, nor spoiler. I get a backup camera, symmetrical AWD (Which is actually the main reason why I'm buying subaru at all), bluetooth is standard, paddle shifters, heated wipers (variable intermittent of course). It's a no brainer for me, I'll never buy Toyota again."

Of course if you set a gear, then shift it back to fully automatic, and then back again, it'll return in whichever gear it chose while you had it in the normal mode for a moment. :P  It does have an auto-override if the engine revs are too high or too low; it's not really meant to be a fully manual function. I use it for engine braking downhill and in the winter, which is the same thing I'll use the paddle shifters for in the Forester."
Toyota,3b5ddi,Cananbaum,3,Fri Jun 26 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds rather counter intuitive, but the hybrid drivetrain on a Prius puts less stress on the drivetrain than a non-hybrid vehicle. The gasoline engine of the Prius is under less stress than a non-hybrid vehicle, and the electric motors that work in conjunction with the gasoline engine have very few moving parts compared to a gasoline engine, so they are very reliable.   As for the battery pack, they're not known to be susceptible to failure, as Toyota has engineered the battery to never fully discharge or overcharge. The battery pack has a 8 year 100k mile warranty. There are now enough hybrids around that there are companies that refurbish and install cycled hybrid battery packs at reasonable prices, if one was to ever go bad out of warranty.   Oddly enough, a sophisticated vehicle like the Prius has some of the lowest operating costs in the current Toyota lineup. I'd buy one without hesitation, but I'm looking for something larger.   Good luck on your search!"

Overall though, the maintenance costs are much lower than a comparable auto. Brake pads routinely last over 100k miles, newer models have no drive belt  (only 1st gen Highlander HVs have a timing belt), no power steering fluid or pump, synthetic oil changes every 10k miles. On top of that, Prius is probably the most reliable Toyota."

Toyota,3b5ddi,Bravo_Oscar_Tango,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"Agree with all the above mentioned. Occasionally at the toyota shop I am in, we get problem prius cars. Very high mileage ones if they have problems will be battery packs. Word is it will soon be possible in the states to replace individual batteries instead of the entire pack...although most of the techs here have reserves about that. So yeah, very reliable and safe. Wouldn't worry about the two systems being more expensive. They are probably one of the cheaper ones maintenance wise in toyotas lineup as of now. Ive seen them go 200k miles without needing brakes. Rarely have I seen the rotors get machined because they were warped."
Toyota,3b5ddi,caymancider71301,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"I drive a Chevrolet Volt and my mom has a Prius.  The electrical portion of the drivetrain is very low maintenance unless something is actually broken. You'd probably need to replace the battery in 8-10 years if you still have the car (depending on mileage, operating temperatures, etc. - batteries degrade the more they're used and eventually it won't be able to hold a usable charge). You actually have to replace brake pads/rotors a lot less often because of the regenerative braking systems on hybrids. On a hybrid like the Prius, oil changes are going to be on pretty much the same schedule as a normal car. The rest of it (suspension, tires, etc.) you're not going to see an appreciable difference with.  The market value of the car will in large part dictate the cost of insurance. If you spend an extra few thousand dollars on a Prius as opposed to something else, you're going to pay a little more in insurance. It won't cost you more because it's a hybrid. However, everyone's situation is unique, so I would suggest getting some quotes if it's really important to you.  While it is undoubtedly much more fuel efficient than a traditional car, I find the Prius unpleasant to drive. It lacks power (though I suppose that is relative depending on what kind of car you're coming from) and the engine drones. It is the epitome of the car as an appliance - but most people don't have a problem with that. The Prius also has a certain image and depending on where you live that may come into play to a greater or lesser extent (see: coal rolling). My mom loves hers though."

Toyota,3alz46,zero2heero,3,Wed Jun 24 03:44:14 2015 UTC,"Usually best way to tell is jacking the rear off the ground and spinning one tire to see if it spins the same way or opposite.  LSDs did not come stock with the 7.5in in the standard 2wd rear ends, so if it does have it then it is modified. There aren't many LSD options out there for it, either one built for a 7.5in 4wd IFS or one from a couple of different cars from that era that had a 7.5in IRS.  The other thing that could have be done is someone swapped an 8in from a 4-speed or V6 2wd. It bolts right up and the 3rd member can be interchanged with the 4wd 8in rear ends. So if this has been done it's a stronger axle and it could have any number of the 4wd locking devices."

So not only does that bottom notch need to be perfect but the top 2 on the cams need to be spot on, make sure your mounting plate is secure because this can cause it to be off a notch or two. once you get the timing belt on properly hand crank the motor 2 full revolutions and watch the teeth on the belt every rotation should move the teeth one notch (I hope i explained that ok) after that put everything back together and try starting it and check it with a timing light also your distributor needs to be spot on or the motor will not start.

If you gotta do all that work in the older gen you might was well go bigger for cheaper. I have a 350 swap too, it barely fits but it is awesome."
Toyota,3agld2,IronSlanginRed,2,Sat Jun 20 04:00:42 2015 UTC,It's a very simple swap from a 3.0 to 3.4. Not so much the 2.4 to 3.4. It can be done but it's just a lot more work. And I do think the body needs to be lifted 2 inches or a hood scoop cut into the hood so that you can clear the intake. And you'll need an r151 transmission. Preferably a engine/trans combo with the harness/ecu. Yota tech has a lot of write ups on 3.4 swaps.

The pump is moving the coolant if it's dropping when the fans kick on, I would look at the cap since its the only thing between the overflow and the cooling system. other then coolant escaping it doesn't sound like you have a problem."

Well, jack up your car, follow that pipe from your engine, to that header, to the cat (either one or two cats), to the muffler and out. If you see anything missing in between, or if you find some screws fell out holding two pieces together, then you have found the problem.  It's definitely a DIY project. You can find used ones from junk yard, buy gaskets to put on both ends, and screw it on. That's it."

That said, I'll gladly recommend the Michelin LTX AT2 (in the heavier load rating = 10 ply sidewalls for strength) I have on my 4Runner at the moment.  Great tire, albeit expensive."
Toyota,3a3kup,Johnnyrad904,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:17:55 2015 UTC,"I have them on my 85. I had been eyeing them for about a year and finally pulled the trigger a few months back. Fist impression, I was very impressed. The tires balanced out very well and I could not believe how well they ride on the pavement! As far as off-road performance I am equally impressed. Beach driving and sand they are very good and have excellent flotation (even in 33x10.50r15). In the mud they have been pretty good but I haven't really had them in anything too crazy. I did not expect them to excel in this category when I purchased however. As far as longevity I cannot personally say due to mine being very new but the tread is deep and one of my customers is over 25k on his with some life left in them(ford ranger). Due to the size of the truck I expect about the same. The price was reasonable to me as well at $200 each for mine. Your tire is the only thing holding your rig to the ground, definitely not a place to skimp. Hope this helps!"

Toyota,39zsii,Adamas_Mustache,6,Tue Jun 16 02:52:21 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly I feel like it's just a bone thrown to the Sporty market because the don't make Camry's with manual transmissions anymore (Not to say the SE ever had one). The transmission will pretty much do what it wants to anyway;it's rev limited and like the other comment stated, the number really means ""max gear"". Only time I ever use it is if I need, to accelerate fast, I'll downshift quickly with the paddle. Beyond that, pretty useless in my opinion."
Toyota,39zsii,ET2-SW,2,Tue Jun 16 04:28:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the LE is any different, but on the SE model if you flip to the sequential shift mode, 4th is just the gear it automatically limits itself to to start. The gear it shows is not necessarily the gear it's in, the car just limits itself to that gear, so it's not operated as a true manual, and it's not a ""sport"" mode either. I use it in winter driving, put it in low gears to get more torque down. As I'm sure you've figured out, you can either shift up or down from there with the shifter (or paddle shifters if you're equipped).   Edit: I just looked in my manual, I guess Toyota refer to this as ""sport mode"" as well as ""s"" or ""sequential shift"" - I was imagining a full ""sport"" mode, trac control, engine timing, and suspension don't change as some other cars do. My mistake."

The transmission is built with comfort, reliability, and not aggressiveness like the IS, so perhaps it can't take it. The SE badge on my Camry makes it better to look at, but doesn't make it any less of a sleeper car.   My next car's probably gonna be an IS350 or IS-F, I'm gonna bug you (cause you're a lexus technician) with questions soon."
Toyota,39zsii,techie825,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"haha,  i agree with number 1.  number 2 im going to say that due to the fact that the majority of toyota vehicles are also FWD, it is indeed a different transmission BUT the programming of the PCM(powertrain control module) is that of safety to the engine.    think about it this way.   if you were pulling onto the highway and this old fogey is in front of you, refusing to accelerate to freeway speeds(something we have ALL experienced) and you need to jump on the throttle to pass.  well, if you switch over to sequential shift mode, and you were at 3500rpm, think about where the RPM are going to go.     1st= 3.938:1         2nd= 2.194:1  3rd= 1.411:1  4th= 1.019:1  Reverse= 3.141:1  Final= 2.814:1  your RPM is going to quadruple if not more if it goes directly into 1st gear.   you will blow your engine in a couple seconds."

Toyota,39zsii,rookie_one,2,Tue Jun 16 05:37:10 2015 UTC,"it is like that on ALL toyota and lexus models.  4th gear is usually direct drive.  basically it is putting you into the safest gear ratio. you have to physically downshift if you want to pass or engine brake.  the engine WILL start slowing the car down below 4th.   gear reductions and such.   also, that isnt SPORT mode.  that is sequential shift mode.    sport mode changes throttle response."

Toyota,39x871,DingusDeluxe,2,Mon Jun 15 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"You're going to have to troubleshoot the system with a multimeter to even have a chance to figure this out. Something might not have power or something might be grounded out, fuse blown, etc. You need to make sure each functional component has a good input and a good output. If it has a all the inputs it needs to work, then that's where the fault lies. By the way, how did your transmission fail?"
Toyota,39x871,ET2-SW,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:18:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response man it means a lot to me, and as for how the transmission failed I lent out my car to my sister to use for a couple days while her Nissan was in the shop, and next thing I knew when I got the Camry back you could tell the RPM would almost double when you would touch the acceleration. Next thing I knew when I was on the way to the dealership to get it checked on, the RPM would hit 7 almost every time you touched the acceleration and only go about 20mph. I had to get off of an extremely busy city road so I had no choice but to keep lightly touching the acceleration until I could find a safe spot to park, but by that point the battery cut out and I was stranded until Triple A could tow it an hour later. There was no official explanation as to how it died out other than the Camry already having some 180,000 miles on it which I guess stresses out a v6 faster then it would a 4 cylinder or so I was told.    As for the JBL system though, I read on a Toyota forum that there is a fuse underneath the hood and might be located near the transmission. I was told to replace the power amp underneath the passengers seat first, but it would seem more likely that this fuse that I've never even seen before could be the culprit. Seeing how you have a substantive knowledge about the JBL system, what other functional compenents are vital to the system aside from the amp and radio head? Is there a diagram of the system?"
Toyota,39x871,ET2-SW,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know JBL, I just know electronic troubleshooting. First thing is to visually inspect all of the speakers and confirm if they are blown or dried out or not. Then test if each speaker is getting signal or not, probably best tested with another speaker with alligator clips. If your test speaker sounds better than the mounted ones, you have bad speakers. If the levels are the same with a test speaker, then its something driving the speakers. Testing the amp is harder, you'll have to first confirm it's getting 12v, then confirm it's getting signal from the head unit. You probably have to disassemble the amp to reach the test locations. If the amp has all good input signals but it isn't driving the speakers, you have a bad amp. If it's not getting 12v, someone probably pinched a wiring harness during the trans job, in which case you'll need someone really flexible to get down between the firewall and the trans to locate and repair the wire. If the audio into the amp is screwed up, the the head unit has a problem. Bottom line is, you pretty much need to take a weekend, strip the inside of the car down and logically and procedurally troubleshoot the system. If it were my car, I would make the time to do that, BUT If I couldn't definitively locate and fix the problem that day, I would just install an aftermarket sound system. Taking apart car interiors generally suck ass. By that point you'll already have sunk the time into taking it apart, and there is no point in putting it back together broken just to take it apart again later to fix it again. Crutchfield has reasonably priced quality parts you could put in and the problem is fixed until you move on to your next vehicle. It all really depends on which resource you have more of: time or money."

Toyota,39uh8j,LABerger,3,Sun Jun 14 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"Word of advice, use quickstruts.  The all in one assemblies that are assembled with springs, perches, boots, etc.  it's just a matter of removing the wheel and 6 or so bolts after that.  Compressing the springs can be dangerous, and your 15 year old car most likely needs all the accessories.  Add to that possibly misalign ing the front bearing plates during reassembly.  I threw a pair of the cheapest assemblies that eBay had to offer in my older Camry 2 years ago and have been very happy."
Toyota,39uh8j,bpodskalny,2,Sun Jun 14 23:29:55 2015 UTC,I like your reasoning--mostly because the tops DO need to be replaced at this age. Would the original springs be reusable? Yes.

Toyota,39uh8j,GeckoDeLimon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:57:29 2015 UTC,2 things. 1 explain misaligning the front bearing plates and 2 do you think the spring REALLY needs to be replaced? I can rent the compression tool and just purchase the struts and save a lot of money versus the complete assembly.
Toyota,39uh8j,bpodskalny,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:58:04 2015 UTC,"When you compress the spring, you then must line up the strut cartridge with the top ""bearing plate"" meaning lining up the notches, then tighten the nut.  It's difficult because the spring is waiting to slip off the compressor and remove you cock, and the fact that what you are tightening a part than needs to stay aligned.  Once tight, it is very difficult if not impossible to tell if it's right.  In my shop, with a nice wall mounted compressor, we usually try to have someone come over and zip the nut on using a pneumatic gun while another tech holds everything just right with both hands.  Yes it's very possible to do, but it's not easy and can be dangerous to boot, 2 indicators that it is not a good idea for someone lacking experience.  Quick eBay search shows a pair of quickstruts for the front of your car for $80.  You cannot get just the cartridges and bearing plates for that little, even on eBay.  Like I said I have done it both ways, in your case the quickstruts save both time, risk of injury, and money."

Toyota,39v2ap,Sazereak,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"Toyota definitely put more software control into their drivetrains after the whole acceleration thing. Big difference from my 05 Sienna to my 14 Camry. For example, the ecu is now supposed to recognize when the brakes are applied and automatically slow the engine. It also downshifts on its own more readily. It takes some getting used to, but I doubt there is anything wrong if the dealer evaluated it."

They had issues with the power sliding door cables but I am pretty sure they extended the warranty on those so you wouldn't have to pay out of pocket. I'm not exactly sure though.   Other than that it sounds like a great buy!"
Toyota,39uc0h,cbullins,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:32:40 2015 UTC,"I read about the door cable. Doesn't sound that bad if it goes, I think you can still manually close the doors.   I would have the water pump changed at the same time, no sense not having it done since they would already be right there."

Toyota,39uc0h,tyguyS4,2,Sun Jun 14 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the awd version comes with runflat tires due to lack of a place to put a spare. Runflats are expensive and yes, you can put regular tires on it, but if you get a flat with them you will have to call a tow truck or figure out how to fix your flat tire right there on the spot. Just something to think about. If awd isn't something that you really need, I would try for a fwd one instead. Just my two cents there."

I cannot remember specifics on that year motor but you should look at doing the timing belt if there is no record of one being done.  Also if you go to Toyota website you can make a profile and enter your VIN number. It will give you all the history of the vehicle that was services at Toyota dealers.

I probably won't buy another forester just cuase I loved my impreza way more but between the rav and forester...forester."
Toyota,39bpzh,PowerInSerenity,0,Thu Jun 11 02:19:00 2015 UTC,"Have you even driven a Forester?? It drives like a tin can compared to the RAV4 and CRV, are you kidding me?!  You sure you aren't confusing the Forester with an Outback?? The Outback drives much better than the RAV4...  ""no power, feels and looks cheap"" is the perfect summary of a FORESTER lol."
Toyota,39bpzh,haggeant,2,Wed Jun 10 22:50:15 2015 UTC,"If you can wait I strongly suggest getting the 2016 forester opposed to 2015. It will have the Starlink Infotainment, the old infotainment is complete garbage, unless you plan to upgrade to aftermarket.  http://www.planetsubaru.com/2016-subaru-forester.htm  Also, have you looked at the Crosstrek? That is a another nice ""small"" suv."
Toyota,39bpzh,haggeant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:51:19 2015 UTC,I think I can wait but I thought it would be a good time to pick up a 2015 at a discount.  I don't think I am very concerned with the entertainment system I may be a bit ignorant to it but as long as I can connect phone via blue tooth im not sure what else is needed. Could you provide more inisight on why the 2015 version is garbage?  Thanks
Toyota,39bpzh,crustysenor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"issues with bluetooth connectivity, plus it has no support now, at least with starlink there are chances of updates.   If you wait until the '16s are on the lot you will probably be able to get a '15 at a reasonable discount. Do more research see if you are willing to live with the infotainment on the '15s."
Toyota,39bpzh,facon12,2,Wed Jun 10 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"I work for Toyota and drive a CR-V - here's my opinion: get the one you like. They're both great vehicles for a similar price. It's all about priorities. If you're looking for an off-road lifestyle, go with the forester. If you like two years free maintenance and a very reliable track record, go with the rav. Now, have you looked into the '15 CR-V? It may have that x-factor if you haven't looked at it."

If there's a way to disable it, most likely it will be the same way as it was when I had my turn signal settings switched. (If you bump the turn signal stalk up or down, it will flash three times and turn itself off. I had mine set to 5 times.) Unfortunately, the dealer has to do it. They were more than happy to change my setting, but I don't know if they can disable that warning beep. Definitely worth asking, though. Also, I find toyotanation forums to be a bit more useful with stuff like this. It's how I found out that the turn signal setting could be changed. Enjoy your new car!"
Toyota,395jp4,trunkz99,3,Tue Jun 9 12:14:53 2015 UTC,"Pros: Lots of cargo room, excellent fuel efficiency and accessibility, stellar reliability, good in any season, roof racks (on LE upgrade package and up).  Cons: AWD is only part-time, touchscreen tends to glare, some buttons and a cupholder are annoyingly hidden under a 'shelf' in the dash, suffers a bit from Toyota's tendency to use hard plasticky interior materials, need to go all the way up to XLE for alloy wheels.  I would suggest, if you do go for the Rav4, to look for a 2015 or 2016 (which isn't out yet but will be before too long). This is because the 2013 and 2014 don't perform well in the small-overlap IIHS crash test, and the front end was adjusted for the 2015 model year to address the issue and improve safety in this kind of collision.  I'm looking for a small SUV myself to replace my Matrix when the lease is up in the fall, and I've narrowed it down to either a Subaru Forester or the Rav4... so I've been researching both of them pretty heavily."
Toyota,395jp4,Narissis,3,Tue Jun 9 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"Part time awd is a plus in my opinion, only when you actually need it will all 4 wheels have power which helps save on fuel and where and tear."
Toyota,395jp4,fribblemetimbers,2,Wed Jun 10 04:25:55 2015 UTC,"The Forester's fuel economy is actually slightly better than the Rav4 despite having full-time AWD.  In fact, the difference in the AWD systems is the main reason I'm leaning more toward the Forester than the Rav4 at this point. In shitty winter weather, I don't want to have to begin slipping before my rear wheels get power. I'd prefer that it always be there."
Toyota,395jp4,Narissis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:47:41 2015 UTC,"That has a lot more to do with the CVT and moving to a 2.0L engine. The new foresters get great mpg for being full-time AWD (Just had one as a rental car in Portland, i averaged almost 30mpg! I was blown away), but man did they get slow. The new ones with the 2.0 are a full second slower than the older 2.5s with the 4spd and you can really feel the lower torque curve on the 2.0  Getting better gas mileage is always great and all but most subaru people I talk to prefer the older models with more power and perceived to be more reliable.  Edit: Wow did not realize the forester still has the same 2.5! I swore they went down to the 2.0 like in the Impreza because it felt so weak, I guess I just REALLY hate the new CVT, but the improvement in MPG is probably worth it to most people. My old Forester would average 18mpg my rental got 29!"
Toyota,395jp4,PowerInSerenity,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"Well, my first impression of the Forester was that it was quicker 'off the line' than my (2.4L, 5-speed) Matrix. So that's good enough for me. XD  Of course, I'll be test-driving again before I make my final decision."
Toyota,395jp4,Narissis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:53:16 2015 UTC,"If you drive in REAL weather then honestly there's nothing better than a Subaru.  I push the RAV4 a lot here in Socal because despite people claiming they would use the AWD of the Forester the truth is they go to big bear once a year, in the spring, when the roads are already clear. The other 99.99% of the car's life is spent in traffic in LA so getting a Subaru is kind of stupid.  However I'm from the pacific northwest and for people up there I recommend Subaru and pretty much nothing else unless you need a truck (sounds like you live in an area with similar weather)"
Toyota,395jp4,PowerInSerenity,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"I'm from Atlantic Canada. I was actually considering buying out my Matrix... then this winter happened.  I want to be able to tank several inches of snow. There are a few reasons I'm leaning toward the Forester... full-time AWD obviously. X-Mode. The additional ~2"" of ground clearance compared to the Rav4. Fog lights. Variable intermittent wipers. Paddle shifters, which will let me downshift for hills without having to put it fully into manual mode.  I do like the looks of the Rav4 a lot more than the Forester, but Subaru definitely seems like the stronger vehicle in terms of overall practicality and winter-readiness.  The one perk of the Rav4 would be windshield wiper de-icers; I'd have to go a trim up from what I'm willing to go on the Forester for those. Unless it changes for the 2016 model year, anyway."
Toyota,395jp4,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:45:33 2015 UTC,"Atlantic Canda? Yeah Subaru all the way, I'd probably get a set of winter tires as well I hear you guys got BURIED earlier this year :(  The RAV4 AWD works good enough in rain/general bad weather. But if you're actually seeing real snow on the ground the Subaru system is way ahead of the game with their torque distribution.   Like you already said the RAV4 system will be entirely reactionary, where the Subaru system will be proactive."
Toyota,395jp4,PowerInSerenity,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:01:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, winter tires are a must. A Subaru with winter tires is unstoppable, even in our winters.  The Rav4, or any other on-demand AWD, would still be great and certainly better than what I have now... but I want the best thing I can get.  If storage space didn't matter, I'd get an XV Crosstrek. It handles a lot like my Matrix (quite a bit less power, though). But I transport large quantities of stuff for events several times a year and the Crosstrek has slightly less room than the Matrix, which is a deal-breaker. I'll only go up in cargo capacity."
Toyota,395jp4,Narissis,2,Thu Jun 11 01:24:24 2015 UTC,"I live in a similar situation and own a '13 XLE. I absolutely love it, and in Sport mode, it's amazing in snow. Fuel economy is solid (keep it in Eco Mode) for an SUV, and the hatch is plenty big for whatever you need. Go for it. (I have two kids and a dog, plenty of room in the back for all.)"
Toyota,395jp4,Unwind23,2,Tue Jun 9 16:36:01 2015 UTC,Awesome that what I wanted to hear. I had narrowed my choices down but I like Toyotas Dependability and looks over the mazda or Honda competitors.
Toyota,395jp4,Hoosagoodboy,2,Tue Jun 9 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"I have a '13 Rav 4 LE AWD, had a minor issue with a dealer installed remote starter, but it was a simple unplug, plug it back in, and problem was solved. AWD is awesome in the snow as well with winter tires installed. Road noise is a bit of an issue, but is easily remedied by turning up the radio.  The only major downside for me is it can't tow much (up to 1500lbs) which is too bad because I was thinking about getting a tent trailer, and ones that weigh less than that are few and far between."
Toyota,395jp4,Hoosagoodboy,2,Tue Jun 9 18:05:34 2015 UTC,Yeah my 05 tacoma was like that was a bit noisy in the cabin. I'm really leaning towards the rav4 can't wait. no real negatives so far.

But really my plans were to put tires on it, cut the springs to lower it (but not slam), body work and paint. Hoping the motor lasts long enough to get all that done then swap it.

Toyota,38w4us,Sadukar09,2,Sun Jun 7 19:33:26 2015 UTC,Well the reason deer usually go through windshields is because they try to jump right before they are hit. If you hit it while it's mostly unaware it tends to deflect better. You definitely got extremely OP

Toyota,38powo,randomasker,4,Fri Jun 5 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"OK, so DO NOT replace your O2 sensors. There is no fault code saying they have failed. The fault code is simply stating that the catalyst isn't scrubbing the exhaust as well as it should. Your upstream A/F sensor is working correctly as is your downstream O2 sensor. Imagine a graph where the signal from the upstream sensor (we'll call it S1) is going up and down and up and down in a wave. This is fuel trim switching from lean to rich and back. This is normal ""closed loop"" operation. What the downstream sensor (we'll call it S2) is reading is the supposedly cleaned air exiting the converter. On a properly functioning system S2s graph would be a straight horizontal line. So what is happening for the P0420 code to set is that the S2 graph is not a straight line as it should be, it is mirroring the graph for S1. The catalyst isn't cleaning the air as it should, so the rich/lean conditions are showing up on S2 as the same up/down rich/lean waveform. This is what sets the code and turns on the light.  So how did this happen? Well, one of two things. 1) the media inside the catalytic converter has deteriorated to the point where it is no longer effective, or 2) the media in there is coated in oil/soot/nastiness which prevents it from reacting with the air passing through. So what can you do?  Most dealerships or repair shops can do what's called an ""induction service"" or ""3 part cleaning"" or ""top engine clean"" or ""3stage"" ; all different names for basically the same service. Count on about a hundred bucks. A manual cleaning of the throttle.body and throttle plate, an additive into the fuel tank, and most importantly a kind of detergent fog introduced into a vacuum line that cleans the intake runners and the combustion chambers. What this CAN do is clean the crud off of the guts of the converter so that it starts to react with the exhaust correctly. I have fixed quite a few this way. And if it doesn't work? Well, the service is usually needed anyway: only helps, can't hurt. Your other option is to replace the catalytic converter in question which can be quite pricey.   There's always the chance that the downstream O2 has failed, but generally you would have a different fault code.   Hope this helps."
Toyota,38powo,stewy97,2,Sat Jun 6 02:39:28 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.  If your area doesn't do emissions testing, you can ignore it, though you really shouldn't.  This code is basically saying your car is worse for the environment than it should be, but beyond that, it won't affect much.  I've been ignoring this code for 3 years because the part costs about 1/4 of what I paid for the car, and we don't do emissions testing in my county."
Toyota,38powo,The_Dingman,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"While you're right in theory about the ramifications of this fault, in practice leaving this unattended for very long periods of time can cause other problems. For example, if the cat.converter is slowly clogging then one day it will become so restricted that it will affect engine performance. Also, running around with a check engine light on all the time could cause you to not realize you have other newer problems because you assume you know why the light is on. There's a couple hundred codes that can show up, with a thousand possible causes. If you are willing to leave the light on, at least have it checked periodically."
Toyota,38powo,stewy97,2,Sat Jun 6 05:55:54 2015 UTC,Very true.

Toyota,38powo,GayBoysLoveMySubaru,2,Sun Jun 7 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"The code doesn't mean that the sensors aren't doing anything, more likely they're just giving readings that are out of range. I don't think the system goes into 'open loop' mode because of this trouble code, so you should be okay to drive a while.   My understanding, is that the first O2 sensor is the one used by the engine mgmt system to maintain air/fuel ratio, so it's the most important sensor. The post-converter sensor is there to check up on the converter. It may still give a trouble code if it goes out of range, but it's most likely the first sensor in your case."
Toyota,38powo,fudgeyouman,2,Fri Jun 5 21:56:20 2015 UTC,Thank you. I figured it was fine. But right now I need to save and replace one at a time until everything is good to go.
Toyota,38powo,fudgeyouman,2,Fri Jun 5 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"My old 4Runner made it to over 420k kms before I sold it, and I only ever replaced the front sensor.   I also didn't buy a Toyota sensor. Most components in the emissions system should only be replaced with Toyota parts, but the O2 sensors are pretty basic, and I remember it was quite a bit cheaper. I probably put about 140k on that aftermarket sensor."
Toyota,38powo,fudgeyouman,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"I might replace the front sensor first then the back sensor as time and money allows me to. Just drove it to class (I arrive early) it doesn't feel any different than normal with some minor things , the fault causes the vsc to turn off and on because it's not performing at its optimal so i can feel the difference in that it's small but I've had this car for 5 years so I know how it rides."

Use the brake booster vacuum line to suck in about half a can of seafoam into the engine when it's idling.  Pour the other half in the gas tank.  When the seafoam is sucked up, shut off the engine and re-attach the brake booster hose.  Leave the car sit for 10-15 minutes.  Use this time to warn all of your neighbors that your house is in fact NOT on fire...no shit.  Start the car, and watch the smoke show.  Rev it up a few times and when it's done smoking, shut it off, let it cool, change the plugs.  Have a coke and a smile."

Toyota,38lmik,MikeMc709,3,Fri Jun 5 11:33:05 2015 UTC,I agree. But I'm surprised that the Corolla has LED headlights standard but can't even option HID or LED on the loaded Camry.
Toyota,38lmik,yibo829,3,Fri Jun 5 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"You can't get them on the 4cylinder and hybrid camry. The V6 Camrys come standard LED low AND high beams (Corollas are only low beam).  Just have some patience :) Toyota IS rolling it out more on other models. First it was standard on ALL Corollas, now its standard on ALL Prius C, and it available on Camry and Avalon.  The new Scion iA and iM will both have standard LED as well as the new 2016 Prius and possibly the new 2016 Tacoma as well.  I actually asked this exact question to our regional Toyota rep, I said ""how much could it possibly cost to have LED instead of Halogen? With economies of scale it would only be like $10 a car and people would love it!""   His response ""in an industry where saving pennies on each car amoutns to millions of dollars, $10 per car is HUGE""   So for now they aren't redesigning current models to fit LEDs the cost would not make sense. But as they introduce NEW models they incorporate LED headlights into the design from the get go which is more cost effective.  So over the next 5 years you'll see more and more models have them :)"
Toyota,38lmik,PowerInSerenity,2,Sat Jun 6 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"I worked at a plant that made the aluminum panels for various makes and models.  They get contacts from different companies where Toyota will not change the body style for a particular model for 5, 7, or 10 years.  So the company is guaranteed that long to make the parts.  It takes a lot of money to alter or get new machines to make a slightly different shaped ridge.  So that is why body styles remain the same from year to year for 5-10 years.  So their other choice is to redesign the headlights, but they probably have similar contacts with headlight manufacturers... so that's why some models will get different or better headlights for example before another model by the same manufacturer, they each have their own contracts and have to wait til they expire."

Some prefer their cars in the weeds with big wheels, others a car restored to the state in which it off the showroom floor in. This one is a pretty good balance between the two, I'm not one for crass body modifications or suspension that'd make it undrivable on the street.   Even if it is a tidy car, there really is no escaping the dumpy styling that resulted in the 'change-over' period between nicely rounded and heavily chromed early 70's cars (like this crown) and the overtly 80's squared off lines of the next gen Coronas."

I would not personally want to get in a car accident in this - reasons not to get it for a first time driver.

My uncle has a 2001 tacoma that got a new frame. It depends on the dealership really when it comes to extra stuff and what not. My uncle is the original owner of his truck with 178,000 miles and  is a loyal toyota customers at the parts department since he, like myself, will only use toyota oem parts. The guy at the service department said ""oh don't worry this is one of our trucks you'll be getting a new truck practically."" I saw the receipt from the work since my uncle demanded it for his records on the vehicle, they did around $11,000 worth of work and parts to the thing all covered under the recall. They did not how ever align the truck after getting a new frame and he had to go buy two new tires and get it aligned afterwards, but that's not a real big deal in my eyes.   From the sounds of it your tacoma is barely broken in... I doubt the frame has any real rot problems currently,  which is a bummer since no new frame but they should give you another undercoat I would imagine."

I feel bad for him, a simple recall would have saved 3 lives and a lot of suffering.   Aside from that, shutting the engine as soon as he lost control of it would have done it. A little hard to think in that situation, but if any of you find yourselves in that same situation, try to reach for the key and shut the engine off."

What upgrades can be done to it? I'm assuming you mean an engine swap? Any specific engines that would be easy/easier to swap in? Goal one is to get it running as is (it's sat for 15+ years) and then figure out how to eek out as much power as possible.  I couldn't inspect the car too much, but the body seemed to be in good shape with no dents and virtually no rust. It's my understanding that it was a Florida car and when they brought it up to Michigan that it basically sat garaged.

In this case, KE30 breaks down to; K = K series engine, E = Corolla, 30 = Series and body style. There were other variants with other engines and body styles. The 1.6 you're referring to is a T series, usually found in the TE37 hardtop in North America. Being essentially the same car across all trim levels, driveline/suspension/brakes etc swaps from the 'sportier' models is literally a bolt-in proposition. They're not worth huge money unrestored (so you can be that guy who turns up at car shows with a retro roof rack and rusted cooler/picnic basket hipster combo muttering something about patina) So cleaned up and tastefully modified wouldn't hurt its value at all."

I fade the radio about two notches to the back. Otherwise, the sound seems pretty front-heavy.

You'll need to get the s premium to get Navi and the entune (if you are going auto). Entune only comes with cars that have navigation.   Edit: for clarification the whole radio system is called entune but only cars with Navi get the accompanying application for android or iPhone. Windows phones don't have access to the entune application at all.

Check if there are any signs of it around the edges, paint bubbles indicate that the metal underneath is already rusting.   Look at the exhaust smoke after a cold start. It shouldn't be too white or blue-ish.   Check the radiator cap, there shouldn't be any gunk under it.  Check the brakes, see if the discs are worn evenly.   Google around to see if you'll be able to find water pump and a timing belt, change those right after buying the car, if you will buy it.   Ask when the oil was last changed. Then ignore whatever they say and change it yourself, if you buy that car. Better safe than sorry.  Putting it on a lift at some local shop would be a really good idea.

Toyota,37qx7w,spleop,2,Fri May 29 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"OK, I do these t belts multiple times a week so let me give you the skinny. If you MUST do it yourself ( which I don't really recommend unless you're familiar with it) be sure to purchase a Toyota brand factory replacement belt. They have marks on them indicating their correct position on the crankshaft and camshafts which are important since getting a good look at the timing marks on the rear bank is quite difficult. Ideally you would replace the cam and crank oil seals when you do the belt. If they are original, they will be very hard by this point and are getting more and more likely to leak. Plus, you'll remove the shield behind the gears to replace them, which you need to do anyway for my last point.  Water pump, replace it. No excuse not to. These things leak, the bearings go bad, etc. This is just as likely to fail as the belt and all of the labor would be wasted if you have to go right back in there when it fails. A lot of people replace the tensioner and it's pulley as well as the idler puller. I personally don't believe in replacing them unless the tensioner has become weak or the bearing in one of the pulleys is loose or noisy. Honestly, this is extremely rare. Be prepared. Although professionals can do this job in 2-3 hours (we Toyota techs range from 45 minutes to 1.5 hrs) you will likely take most of a day.  Sorry if the formatting is screwy, I'm on mobile. Let me know if you have any questions."

Toyota,37qx7w,stewy97,1 point,Sun May 31 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"No way to really check the condition of it without removing it. But, if you'll call your local Toyota dealer, using the VIN they can give you a service history of any time it was in any dealer and check for open recalls at the same time."
Toyota,37qx7w,stewy97,1 point,Sun May 31 11:50:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I already called them to see if the recalls were dealt with (which they were apparently) but I didn't ask them about service records because I didn't think they'd have any personal mechanics or anything on file

Toyota,37qx7w,fudgeyouman,1 point,Sun May 31 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's an interference design.   Unless you're very comfortable with a timing belt replacement, don't do it yourself. Also, I would assume that doing this work on a van would be even more difficult than any other body style.   Also, replace the water pump with this timing belt. It's not that much more labor, and the pump isn't that expensive. But the labor to replace it on it's own, is huge.   Edit: Also, be prepared for replacing things like the tensioner or a pulley. At 177k, they might be near the end of their life cycle. This isn't the time to scrimp on a repair bill.   When I owned a 4Runner, I would tell my mechanic to replace anything to do with the timing belt, or cooling system, if it looked bad. I sold that truck with over 250k miles (km equivalent), and never had a problem with it."

I have a decently equipped garage, I've always done my own maintenance (even considerably invasive repairs) and I took it to an independent mechanic. Most cars are not conducive to timing belt maintenance, vans just add a pit of alligators beneath it. Very little clearance, high probability of bumping a cam out of place, and unless you replace everything in one go, the labor is wasted. I also ran into a huge problem tensioning the accessory belts as well. Save yourself the time and aggravation and pay an independent mechanic with a good reputation. Do it once, do it right."

Also, update: I took a bit of the cover off to take a peek at the belt to see what it's condition was and it looked very nice, dark, seemingly fresh rubber, I'll get a pic for you guys when I get the whole cover off and maybe you guys can help me determine how detrimental it is I get it done soon.

You already have the window tint so thats nice, you can keep an eye out on craigslist for the 18"" V6 wheels which would be a nice upgrade but will make the ride harsher and tires will be more expensive when it comes time to replace. I'd honestly just black out the stock wheels they're nice 5-spokes already and the perfect 17"" size for that car.  Throw in a $50 HID kit from DDM Tuning, will increase your nighttime visibility, looks great, and since you have factory projector lenses you can aim them slightly down and not blind everyone.

Toyota,37m5zx,DutchessArcher,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:27:22 2015 UTC,"Nope super easy. Just youtube ""plasti dip badges"" and you'll get instructions on how to do it. Just need:   Can of plasti dip Automotive masking tape (get at any auto parks store) tooth pic or something similar to carve out the extra dip.   You basically just blockoff the area you want to black out, spray the whole thing a few times (3-4 coats), let it dry, then peal away the plastidip on the parts you don't want.  Edit: Best part is if you mess up you can just start over! The stuff isn't permanent so you can ALWAYS take it off later if you don't like it or decide to sell the car."
Toyota,37m5zx,Broken_Goat,5,Wed Jun 3 00:29:17 2015 UTC,"Tint the windows, change the wheels to something else you like. It honestly changes the look of the whole car."
Toyota,37m5zx,CavalryScout19D3,1 point,Thu May 28 17:38:41 2015 UTC,The windows are tinted. And yeah the wheels are something I've been thinking about. Either having the stock ones powder coated matte black or swapping them out altogether.
Toyota,37m5zx,grady08,3,Thu May 28 17:45:26 2015 UTC,Painting the wheels is the cheaper way to go my last bit of advice is for the love of god please don't pinstripe the car. Looks awful when someone does that.
Toyota,37m5zx,mkhockeygeek,2,Thu May 28 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"Haha I feel you. Luckily I have no desire to pinstripe the car, or add hood scoops or an obnoxious spoiler etc. I just want to make a couple of changes that look nice and take away some of the mom look."

Everything else, like big wheels, big drops, body kits IN MY OPINION look silly on a car like this. YMMV"
Toyota,37mwqv,Noskajj,1 point,Thu May 28 20:19:45 2015 UTC,Is it possible you have bad motor mounts causing flex on the joint and tearing up the gasket?

Toyota,37mwqv,Goingdef,1 point,Thu May 28 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"I gave that a shot just now. After rocking it pretty hard in 1st gear I saw a small amount of play in the engine.

Toyota,37mwqv,Goingdef,1 point,Thu May 28 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"Yea that doesn't look bad at all, I think the next thing to check might be the exahasut pipe hangers and make sure they're all in place, I've never seen a exhaust donut gasket burn through but I've seen plenty wear through excessive movement within the components."

Toyota,37jn6a,theloraxe,3,Thu May 28 03:52:02 2015 UTC,Traded in my Camaro for the 2015 Corolla S Plus last weekend. Got a new job and with that a 50 miles round trip and 20mpg in the Camaro wasn't cutting it (also the numerous problems I had to take it back to the dealer for). I'm getting 43mpg on the highway and 36mpg on the streets. Also haven't been to a gas station since I purchased it lol

Toyota,37e8bq,ET2-SW,2,Wed May 27 12:17:56 2015 UTC,I used to have a 1980 2wd. Wasn't sure if I loved or hated those bodylines. Now I just miss it.
Toyota,37fg0i,Dappersnapper420,2,Wed May 27 06:07:17 2015 UTC,"Im not quite sure what you mean? what does your car redline at? mines at 7800, and i wont take it over 8000, so what ever your car says, anything below that is the safe amount for RPM.   But for daily driving i rarely take it over 3000"
Toyota,37fg0i,BelievesInGod,1 point,Wed May 27 12:28:03 2015 UTC,"Well 2wd Toyota pickups don't have a tach and I installed one so I don't know the redline, I know its rather low mabie 5500 rpm"
Toyota,37fg0i,BelievesInGod,1 point,Wed May 27 14:52:06 2015 UTC,"didn't know they never came with tachs, you might have to look into this further, but The ECU shouldn't let you go over the redline, it will cut fuel and stop you, you should have 2 limiters, a redline, and a top speed one (which can be altered easily). Although, hitting the redline too much causes excess wear and tear.   I did a quick search and found this ""5750 redline on my 93 22re"" This is a slightly different engine, but the difference is minimal    And a few other searches i found people saying the redline from factory is 5500.  So if you are still worried, i wouldn't take it over 5000, that being said the 22r makes most power at low rpm anyways   http://board.marlincrawler.com/index.php?topic=13744.0 http://www.yotatech.com/f120/22r-red-line-164557/"
Toyota,37fg0i,fcastle,2,Wed May 27 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"while you may rev a 22re at a standstill to redline, in gear, it's very hard to get there past 2nd gear. the 22re makes its power pretty low and i was never able to get either my 2wd or 4wd to redline in third. it would almost get there. but only almost.   and the 2wd came with the tach if the truck was well optioned."
Toyota,37fg0i,dj_z00l4nd3r,1 point,Wed May 27 15:53:52 2015 UTC,OK so 3000-3500 rpm around town should be perfectly safe then? :)

Toyota,37cwqy,Spadeykins,1 point,Tue May 26 21:45:23 2015 UTC,I would bring a mechanic with you when you are dealing with the coupe. Make sure that both of these dealers have a title on hand! I'd go with the coupe.

Toyota,376uom,sprocketous,2,Mon May 25 10:36:31 2015 UTC,"Don't know about the 4x4 model but my family had an 86 and we abused it for around 12 years before it was sold, it had around 300k miles on it and still running strong. Tough little car. Tough little car to pick up dates in when you're 16. When I was in high school several of my friends took their driving test in it, it was an easy car to drive.  edited to add; the main issue we had with the car was that it was a bit noisy to drive, didn't seem to be a lot of sound dampning material in the car so road noise and engine noise was hard to ignore."
Toyota,376uom,bellmanator,2,Mon May 25 13:22:18 2015 UTC,"Only 130k? That seems very low.   Some Tercels had auto trans issues, but I think that was more in the early 80s, and fwd models.   As long as you're not spending too much on it, it's probably risk free. If your jurisdiction has auto inspection requirements when registering an older car, there might be some downside there."

Toyota,374qsg,Troniar24,2,Sun May 24 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"Most likely the gasket in the rear hatch needs to be replaced, you can usually tell if theres a hole underneath from water sitting. Check the struts by bouncing the car as those are usually shot. Look for leaks all over, and check the dipstick for coolant by taking a lighter to it. If it sizzles it has coolant in it, if it just thins out its just oil. Really just go through the car and check that the headlights flip up etc.."
Toyota,374qsg,CrowzNarbin,1 point,Mon May 25 13:57:47 2015 UTC,"When purchasing a used car I usually ask and check to what they have replaced. And base it off from there to see what comming up maintenance is needed.   Let him test drive it to see how he drives and when you have cash on hand go test drive it yourself.   If the original owner doesn't floor it I always asked them to floor it on the highway on the way back to his house.(not before the drive just bring it up on the way Back)   Either from that is should be your usual routine oil change, spark plug, change if it's been well maitain."

Should I trust what dealerships know at this point, try calling Toyota corporate or just give up and punch myself in the face with a bunch of shrapnel? I don't like the approach of ""wait and see"". I'm reading about how Honda and Subaru are offering to have someone come get your car if you don't even feel safe driving it to the necessary location to have it fixed.

Toyota,3753nb,tunersharkbitten,1 point,Mon May 25 03:19:39 2015 UTC,"honestly, if you dont feel comfortable driving it in, ask your local dealership if they have a door to door service available.  basically, what we do at MY dealership is we have a valet drive out to your house with a loaner car, have you sign the loaner contract and they drive your vehicle back to the dealership and do whatever repairs are necessary and authorized by yourself.  recalls usually come with a free tank of gas(in most dealerships) as stated by TMC mandate.  when the repair is complete we will drive the car back to your home, OR if you want to come in to the dealership and drop off the loaner, we do it that way.   it MAY vary from dealer to dealer, but any dealership with a service department concerned with CSI(customer service index) will go out of their way to make the experience comfortable for you.  i hope everything works out for you and your family, and drive safely."

And 90% of the time I'll end up with a few new dents and dings but nothing really broken or failed. Even when something does fail it will still get you home. I once blew both front CV axles and was able to drive it 30 miles home. The tundras are just as dependable, and very capable in work and play. Plus they are actually very easy to work on, and anything you might have a question about can be answered by a slew of forums. Lastly don't let age or mileage scare you. Mine is 11 years old with 100000 miles and I don't see it going away anytime soon.  Edit: plus in situations where Toyota screws up they usually rectify it. My generation of 4runner had a faulty soft touch dash and guess what, I get a brand new one for free 11 YEARS later through a factory replacement program. And I'm the 1st generation Tacoma that had improper frame rust prevention those owners get the entire frame replaced no charge.

Toyota,36sl1v,winteriscoming014,2,Fri May 22 04:56:03 2015 UTC,"Regardless of Toyota's reputation, the Tundras do have some known issues (I own an 07 Tundra):  Cam tower oil leak. It's a difficult leak to see, and is usually first noticed by a burning rubber smell coming from the front fender wells after the engine has ran for some time. The parts to fix it are not expensive, but the labor is extensive.   Front differential howl. I'm unsure of the long-term effects of letting this problem go, but I can't imagine that a differential that isn't clearanced properly is good for anything. You might want to double-check this on some of the Tundra forums, but I believe the check for this was to drive about 50 km/h on a straight, flat road, and let your foot off the gas pedal. Listen closely for a noise that could be a low hum or a noticeable howl. Put the truck in 4WD mode, and if the noise goes away, you've got diff howl.   Again, they are great trucks, but do your homework first.

Toyota,36s71x,tyguyS4,2,Thu May 21 23:23:06 2015 UTC,"Look up the Camry fluid change procedure. Similar drivetrain, similar sans dipstick unit. I believe the concise procedures is warm the car up, get it on stands. Remove driver wheel and splash guards. Their is an inlet and return to the radiator from the trans. Isolate the flow leading to the radiator from the trans and disconnect it; immediately put the end in an empty 1 qt container. Have a partner start the car. Let the container fill, shut the engine off about 3/4 from the top. Locate the fill nut on the top of the trans and clean it. Make it immaculate. Remove the nut and fill the trans with the same amount you just removed. Replace the nut finger tight. Remove another quart, lather, rinse, repeat. After you do this about 10x, the fluid should be as clean coming out as is was going in. Look up the Toyota tech manual for more ( probably important) details. Oh, and only use the exact Toyota fluid your manual calls for. I love Toyotas, but removing the dipstick and calling it lifetime was a pretty dick move."

As long as body rust is not severe, it is almost never a w aste of money to repair this era Toyota. My Celica was totaled, but I finally traded my corolla because it was to small for my needs. There is even more value in doing the maintenance yourself, because labor isn't cheap. If it's just the radiator and the starter, go for it.

Toyota,36f1kb,Malolo_Moose,1 point,Wed May 20 04:39:53 2015 UTC,I would assume that the torque number is more worrying.  Going from a 4.0 to 3.5 would make that metric suffer the most I think.

There are also inlets around the sunroof. Easiest way to find it is to take out the passenger seat (for room), get in the car and close everything up. Have someone use a hose or sprinkler to continually wet the car, while you look under the dash for the source of the leak. And get that water out with a shop vac and fans pronto, or it will stink in a hurry."
Toyota,36f87o,ET2-SW,1 point,Tue May 19 00:01:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I was thinking along those lines. My concern is, how would you get those unclogged if that's the problem?"
Toyota,36f87o,ET2-SW,3,Tue May 19 00:24:38 2015 UTC,"Depending on where it is, a lot of times you can snake out a clog with a straightened coat hanger or wire. Also, the ac sometimes has a condensate drain that can clog. If it turns out to be a bad weatherseal or gasket, just replace it. My Sienna had a bad weatherseal on the wiper cowl when it was only a year old. Never leaked, but the sun dried it in such a way that it could only be fixed by removing the windshield. UV radiation does some weird things to black plastic and rubber."

Toyota,3687by,freethecoconuts,2,Sun May 17 02:50:01 2015 UTC,"Check windshield seal and front grille. Windshield seal coming loose and producing a kazoo-like noise is relatively common issue; in 2012 and newer models the redesigned front grille also apparently causes this issue at times.  Failing that, my next suspect would be the front differential needle bearing which is known to float due to differential design oversight by Toyota.   As you can see, East Coast Gear Supply has developed a solution (I have it in place in my 2009), but it requires differential replacement or rebuild to be implemented."

All hoses are fine, no poor connections fans are great. Thinking maybe temp sensor? Anyway to tell and if so best place to buy? Also personally recommendations for radiators? Thank you"
Toyota,365xpx,CartoonPenis,1 point,Sat May 16 13:40:13 2015 UTC,Most likely the water pump if you haven't changed it in a while. Do it with the timing belt as preventative maintenance.
Toyota,365xpx,TheyWereAllTaken,1 point,Sat May 16 14:09:55 2015 UTC,Get an IR temp gauge if you haven't already and check inlet/outlet temps. See if your gauge is reading correctly. My sender unit went bad and I thought I overheat at the track.
Toyota,365xpx,2jzge,1 point,Sat May 16 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"Stock Radiator?  Also as another member said have you changed your water pump?  My thinking is your IC is dumping a lot of heat  to the ambient air and your cooling system isn't capable of handling the decrease in efficiency from 40+degree C air.   Some countermeasures could include a remote oil cooler mounted in front of the driver side wheel well, an electric booster water pump, or an improved radiator.  First confirm you cooling system does not have any issues. Check the water temp sensor by running 12V through the circuit and putting it in 0Degree C water and read the resistance from an Ohm meter.   Also are there any other issues? Power loss? If so you could check the engine compression. Change the oil and check if it's milky."

Toyota,360zg8,alquduri,1 point,Fri May 15 04:29:12 2015 UTC,I have a 2010 Corolla that I'm leaving stock for the most part. I won't do anything with the wheels or suspension because I live in eastern Canada and the roads and winters are terrible. I have a K&N air filter installed and plan on tinting my windows at some point but other than that it's a reliable daily driver that works fine the way it is. I'd rather get a 4Runner and put money in that. :)
Toyota,360zg8,GroovyHippie,1 point,Fri May 15 09:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my curiosity was because if you just Google about Honda cars, you'll see how people regularly customize them vs Toyotas on the road. Don't know the reason for this but perhaps the newer ones are more eligible to customize given their overall features and exterior look."

Toyota,360zg8,badmana,1 point,Sat May 16 00:35:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably self selection. If you want big fart can exhausts and big wings you probably will be looking at a Civic. While both the Civic and Corolla are very similar I find modders lean towards Civics if only because it's easier to find parts.  I've done a little work on my 2013 Venza, adding LED marker lights to the rear bumper, converted all the interior lights to LED and added footwell LED lighting.  I plan on adding some LED lighting under the hood this summer (I do lots of my own work, would be nice to have a small hood light)."

Toyota,3606s2,LionOfBabylon,1 point,Thu May 14 23:58:55 2015 UTC,I'm constantly amazed at how well Toyota takes care of their customers.
Toyota,35sk6j,NavySeals,9,Wed May 13 03:45:01 2015 UTC,"Beyond easy, and parts are cheap and easy to get.  $1300 seems awful steep though. I paid $300 for mine which only had 150k, which was a steal yes but not $1000 off.  And for what it's worth, don't think Subaru invented the Japanese rally car. Toyota was doing what Subaru used to do before Subaru was anything more than just a few stars."
Toyota,35sk6j,jpoRS,1 point,Wed May 13 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I know subaru didn't start it lol, but they've done one Hell of a job continuing it. I guess I thought that $1300 was too little, but the way you explain it, I should start looking for ones that aren't that expensive. Would the Celica be a good candidate as well?"
Toyota,35sk6j,jpoRS,3,Wed May 13 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"If you can find an old Celica sure, but most you'll see on the market now are going to be last-gen models with very unfavorable ground clearance.   Let me get some perspective on the cost issue. Are you looking for something that is daily driver worthy that you can also tinker with, or are you looking for a rally project that you're going to gut and probably wind up destroying in the woods somewhere. Because if it's the former a $1300 Corolla might not be bad (assuming the vehicle is in good enough shape to justify the cost) but if you're looking for a project car you can do a lot better.   The thing with 90's Toyotas is the drive train is as durable as anything could be expected to be, it's just the bodies were rust magnets. But if you're going to be bouncing off trees anyway, who cares what the body looks like?   Sorry if I'm rambling, it's getting late here and I am not be making the most sense. I promise I have a point, and if you can't find it I'll try and make it in the morning."
Toyota,35sk6j,Broken_Goat,2,Wed May 13 04:14:56 2015 UTC,"No no, you're good. My DD is a 2003 Forester. This would be just to learn how to rally on 2wd. I'd probably use it for a year, before trying something else or getting my dreamcar bugeye wrx. I'd probably drive it on occasion, but wouldn't gut it or anything, just take out ABS fuse if there is one, and any other little things like rear seats. Just so I could sell it later on...assuming I don't destroy it lol."
Toyota,35sk6j,Broken_Goat,1 point,Wed May 13 04:22:58 2015 UTC,"the celica has the rally history behind it. Look at the celica altrak rally cars. awd, turbo, 5spd. things of beauty. Even back to the 70s they were rallied. awesome history there."

I know the corolla also came in the altrak trim for a few years, but thats useless info since you want fwd.   Honestly though, both would make excellent little rally cars.

For TPAT it was different, we had cars that the teachers bugged, but we got a much larger variety of cars, most of which were brand new and straight from the manufacturer.  personally, i would recommend going thru t-ten due to cost and real world applications.  I learned a ton due to the fact that i had great teachers and i didnt fall asleep in class like other people in my class.    then again, i did get a job with lexus so there is a testiment to the system.  tpat is basically a highly compressed, largely interactive and VERY hands on version of t--ten.   tpat is 12 weeks, t-ten is much longer.  also you are required to complete ALL of your toyota certifications and obtain 2 ASEs to graduate."

ASEs get mighty expensive and i was able to get 4 of them on my schools dime.   also they signed us up for DELMAR learning center and my account is still active so that is a plus.    how is the in class dynamic?  what is the lab to lecture ratio?  for us it was 30% lecture, 70% lab."
