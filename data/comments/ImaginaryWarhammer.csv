ImaginaryWarhammer,3bn14t,Meatshield,3,Thu Jul 2 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think Khorne and Slaanesh are much worse than Nurgle.  Nurgle grants you nigh immortality, the ability to create and sustain life, and you feel no pain. You're also filled with an intense sense of euphoria and happiness. Nurgle is also the only Chaos Lord that legitimately cares about his follwoers, in his own horrifying way. His followers accept death, and the ultimate deterioration of all things, but in an optimistic ""circle of life"" sort of way.   People corrupted by Khorne are filled with a neverending stream of adrenaline and an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed. They can't think straight, they're in constant torment, they can't rest at all. Only the most heinous acts of mass murder can sate them for a fleeting moment. It's endless torture for all eternity.   Slaaneshi corruption is even worse. You become obsessed with sensations of all sorts. You need constant sensory overload and agonizing levels of pleasure to be even remotely satisfied. No matter how hard you try, you always need more. Eventually, only the most degrading, disgusting, masochistic, humiliating and sadistic acts can satisfy your sado-sexual lust. Only the loudest noises, the most eye-bleeding colors, and the most painfully intense tastes can satisfy your senses. You're constantly on the hunt for a greater thrill. Constantly trying to experience everything just to feel alive for a short time. In the end, even death is just a new experience to be enjoyed in one final orgasmic act of hedonism.   Nurgle is interesting because the consequences of worshipping him are only horrifying from an outside perspective. Once you're under his sway you're loving every minute of its, so in a way there's no downside.   Personally, I prefer Tzeentch, but Nurgle is attractive to many people. It's also worth noting that most people don't join Nurgle willingly. Typically they're infected by one of his illnesses and swear fealty to him for relief."
