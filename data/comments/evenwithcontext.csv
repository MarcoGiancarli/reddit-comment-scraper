I understand the reference and I'm a huge Thomson fan, but how is it relevant to the proposed notion of ""dogspotting"", aside from merely being a reference to popular fiction? To juxtapose the content of the book to the commentary context, the story referenced involves the protagonist, Raoul Duke, requesting that his drug-addicted attorney and villanous sidekick, Dr. Gonzo, purchase some golf-shoes because the carpet was making mobility difficult in his drug-addled perception. In the context of the commentary, it would seemingly have nothing to do with explaining how dogspotting is like /r/aww if the Nazis had won the war.  It beside the point to say that Thompson's fiction is disputably exaggerated autobiography. Further beside the point, the concept of speculating how something goofy might be different if Nazis had won is possibly also a reference to Philip K Dick's The Man in the High Castle.
