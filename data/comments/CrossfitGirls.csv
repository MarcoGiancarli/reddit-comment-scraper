CrossfitGirls,3bvw89,BubbaScarecrow,2,Thu Jul 2 16:08:35 2015 UTC,Yikes that is some ugly starfishing from a beautiful lady.
CrossfitGirls,3bvw89,coltpython,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:57:13 2015 UTC,I'm not very familiar with Olympic lifts. What is wrong with her form? The spreading of her feet?
CrossfitGirls,3bvw89,Dynoman,2,Thu Jul 2 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"That's right. It's awfully bad to spread your legs outward because 1) it's not a strong position and 2) it's biomechanically disadvantageous, putting a ton of lateral stress on your knees and hips. We all did jumping jacks as kids in school, but imagine doing a jumping jack with the most possible weight you could heft up to chest height.  I've actually wondered why people do this at all. I think it may be fear of putting yourself completely under a very heavy weight - they naturally 'diversify' their footing so-to-speak. It may also be naturally faster to split the legs laterally rather than front-back or directly under, since that uses the larger gluteus medius muscles rather than relying on hip flexors. It may also be more instinctual for people to do that since they don't have to bend forward as much -- they can keep their backs more upright, which is something I totally understand having had my own back problems.  Since I'm typing, there is a little bit of foot spread that's expected in the clean (what she did here) and moreso in the snatch; but only when you're dropping down to the ground and need that width for strength and to follow the natural path of the hip girdle. Doing it for a power clean or power jerk, and doing it too exaggerated, will only lead to weakness and injury.  Anyway she's a beauty and obviously highly accomplished. This is probably like the one time in the past year that she starfished. There's another gif on here of her rowing and she has perfect form. Thanks for posting."
CrossfitGirls,3bvw89,coltpython,2,Fri Jul 3 01:05:58 2015 UTC,I saw someone at the gym teaching his kid to starfish (only learned the name now).
