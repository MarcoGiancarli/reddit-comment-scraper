K_gifs,375r14,pnewell,2,Thu Jun 11 01:33:11 2015 UTC,I love all of his movies so much
K_gifs,375r14,pnewell,2,Thu Jun 11 01:33:53 2015 UTC,"Me too! Just the right amount of style to his fighting.   Check your TV and see if you have the El Rey channel. It's a weird channel that's mostly kung fu movies and stuff from the 80s, but branded around Mexican wrestling because that's the only original programming it does."
K_gifs,375r14,pnewell,2,Thu Jun 11 01:47:30 2015 UTC,I like the sound of that. Another great movie that falls into this genre worth checking out is a Jackie Chan movie called Fearless Hyena.   It's pretty funny actually. Especially for being a late 70s kung fu movie.   Ooh another one I really like is The Big Boss. It has basically the same story as most of the Bruce Lee movies where he's an unassuming average joe pushed to be a badass. But for some reason this one sticks out to me.
K_gifs,375r14,pnewell,3,Thu Jun 11 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Young Jackie Chan is the only person who's more entertaining a fighter. His Drunken Master is great just by itself, but a whole lot of fun to watch in action."

K_gifs,2v02s4,blazeitian,9,Mon Feb 9 13:09:03 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

K_gifs,2o22t2,fuckduck,3,Wed Dec 3 00:40:56 2014 UTC,"Ha!  I definitely understand that.  I think most people do.  What I think, additionally, though... is that you miss the tension built up here, and the subsequent comedic affect is lost on you because you seem impatient.  The payoff is WELL worth the wait.  And I made this for one exchange with one person, then shared it here as a gift.  You don't have to like it... but to claim that it's not ""good"" because it doesn't fit into your ideas of how to use a gif on the internet is not only haughty... it's wrong.   I think you meant ""to put people's elaborate comebacks in their place"" maybe?  Anyway, your sentiment is kind of trite... as if people don't know how to ""use"" gifs.  LOL!"

K_gifs,2h7fvb,carb0nxl,2,Wed Sep 24 03:43:14 2014 UTC,"I never understood why. Even though the Brits and Americans speak basically the same language, our signs are quite different. I've only seen so much BSL but a lot of words and letters appear completely different. When I try and watch a video of someone speaking BSL I really don't know what they're saying and I am fluent in ASL (I'm deaf).  I haven't really studied much in the history of the sign languages among different countries though. But keep in mind that just because ASL is widely popular, it is NOT the universal language. The A stands for American after all. So try to remind yourself that a language/country will probably have their own sign language variant.  EDIT: Check out the difference in the alphabet for yourself.  ASL version  BSL version"
K_gifs,2h7fvb,jehran,1 point,Wed Sep 24 04:27:22 2014 UTC,The reason is that ASL is actually based off of French Sign Language. Galludet created ASL with the help of the French Laurent Clerc and so there are more similarities between those two than BSL and ASL.

K_gifs,2gmvv1,I4gotmyoldpassword,2,Sat Sep 20 14:27:21 2014 UTC,"Section 7. Controversy of article  Night Trap:       Night Trap was cited in the 1990s Congressional hearings concerning violent video games. Night Trap, Mortal Kombat, Lethal Enforcers and Doom are considered to be primary factors in leading to the development of the ESRB game industry ratings system.  Two weeks before Christmas 1993, the Sega CD version of Night Trap was removed from store shelves at the United States of America's two largest toy store chains, Toys ""R"" Us and Kay-Bee Toys, after receiving numerous complaints that were suspected to be part of an organized telephone campaign.  A journalist for GamePro noted that both Toys ""R"" Us and Kay-Bee Toys continued to stock Mortal Kombat.  In January 1994, Sega withdrew the game from publication in direct response to a December 9, 1993 joint Senate Judiciary and Government Affairs Committee hearing on video game violence, announcing they would later release a censored version.  The hearings were covered heavily by the media and were co-chaired by Senators Joseph Lieberman (Connecticut) and Herbert H. Kohl (Wisconsin), during which Night Trap was cited as ""shameful"", ""ultra-violent"", ""sick"", and ""disgusting"", encouraging an ""effort to trap and kill women"". Contrary to such claims, players are not trapping or killing women, but saving them from harm.  The Congressional hearings were covered in major newspapers including USA Today, The Washington Post and The New York Times.  In particular, a game over scene in which the character Lisa is wearing a nightgown while captured by Augers attempting to drain her blood was found to be very offensive. In defense of the game, Tom Zito (President and CEO of Digital Pictures) attempted to explain the context of the nightgown scene during a hearing session, but he claims he was silenced.  In the short documentary Dangerous Games (included with the PC version), the producers and some members of the cast explain that the plot of the game was to in fact prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood draining device was intended to look very unrealistic and would therefore mitigate the violence.  Despite scenes in which the girls are grabbed or pulled by enemies, no nudity or extreme acts of violence were ever filmed or incorporated into the game.
